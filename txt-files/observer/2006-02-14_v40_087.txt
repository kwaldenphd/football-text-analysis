INSIDE COLUMN 


Don't stop believin' 
I know the situation looks bleak. After 
a promising 10-2 start, Notre Dame bas­
ketball stumbled their way to becoming 
the greatest 1-8 team in Big East history. 
It felt like I was having deja vu every 
time I had the mis­

fortune of watching Greg Arbogast 
the Irish in the last 
five minutes of a 

game. I mean, how Sports Writer 
many of you just 
knew that that 

prayer of a 3-pointer by Taquan Dean 
would somehow find its way to the bot­
tom of the net at Louisville? Watching 
the reaction of the Notre Dame bench 
after that shot went in made you ques­
tion not only whether this team could 
take anymore, but quite possibly the 
existence of a higher power as well. 
There's just something about this 
team though. Something about this 
team that hasn't let me give up on them 
yet. Something about this team that 
makes me think that the seemingly 
unattainable idea of an NCAA tourna­
ment bid is still a tangible possibility. 
Allow me to draw on the immortal 
wisdom of Bluto Blutarski when he says, 
"Was it over when the Germans bombed ·Pearl Harbor?" No, it wasn't over then, 
and it isn't over now for the Irish and an 
NCAA tournament bid. 

'Why?' you ask. Well, first and fore­
most, I'm a strong believer in the "You 
can only lose so many games where you 
walk back to your dorm wanting to cry" 
theory. Although this might be a little 
painful for some, here's a recap of such 
moments from this school year: football, 
Michigan State and USC; basketball, 
Georgetown and Villanova. I mean, how 
much punishment can the sports gods 
possibly expect us to endure in one 
year? 

That theory in mind, I come back to 
the idea that there's just something 
about this team. A weak team would 
have rolled over and died after the 
Villanova game. The majority of teams 
would have packed it in after the West 
Virginia heartbreaker. Even a mentally 
tough team would have decided this just 
wasn't their season after the Louisville 
loss. 

If, however, the Irish had packed it in 
for the season already, like most teams 
would have in their situation, they 
would have come out against an under­
manned Rutgers team and proved to a 
noticeably less than enthusiastic 
Leprechaun Legion that the team felt 
their season was over. 

That's just the thing, though. Chris 
Quinn and company don't feel that this 
season is over. Whatever their reason­
an undying spirit, a superior mental 
toughness, a possible subscription to the 
aforementioned "close game" theory­
Notre Dame believes they can turn those 
heartbreaking losses into emotional 
wins in this season's remaining games. 
The Irish haven't given up on this sea­
son, and until they do -ifthey do -we 
owe it to this year's team not to give up 
on the season either.

CORRECTIONS 

In the Feb. 13 edition ofThe Observer, a news arti­cle about "The Vagina Monologues" stated Notre Dame/Saint Mary's Right to Life opposes the YWCA and the SOS receiving funding raised by "The Vagina Monologues" because the groups on a national level have an anti-life sentiment. However, Right to Life believes SOS is an acceptable recipient of funds because the group has an established rela­tionship with the University and because it does not counsel women to have abortions. Right to Life does find the YWCA problematic because ofits national pro-choice stance. The Observer regrets the error.

Couple reunites after sixty years 
ADRIAN, Mich.-Willard Mason and Ilah Ost are giv­ing new meaning to the phrase: "Love is patient." More than 60 years ago, the couple were engaged to be married, but life's cir­cumstances got in the way. 
Now, after they each married others, raised families and their spouses died, the two are together again. 
"Ilah was my first girl­friend," Mason told The Daily Telegram. "I first met her when I was a sopho­more at Blissfield High School."

The two began dating and got engaged. 
But in 1941, Mason moved to Ypsilanti to work at the Willow Run bomber plant. There, he met a woman named Helvi, and broke his engagement to Ost. He married Helvi in 1942. 
Ost later married her husband, Marvin, and had three children before he died in 1974. 
Mason's wife died in 2003, and by chance, he ran into Ost's brother in Blissfield in 2004, and he encouraged Mason to call Ost. 
The two started dating, 
with Mason driving from his home near Houghton Lake to Adrian, where Ost lived. 
On one of his trips to Adrian, Mason blacked out and struck a tree with his car. Tests showed he need­ed a new pacemaker, Mason said. 
He then moved to near Adrian and invited Ost to move in with him. 
"We get along perfectly," Mason said. "We've never h'!td an argument. She's a great cook, and she takes care of me."

Famous author kicks 


off Literary Festival 
By WILL KEARNEY News Writer 
The annual Notre Dame Literary Festival, once host to distinguished writers such as Kurt Vonnegut and Norman Mailer, continued its tradition 
of drawing acclaimed authors Monday night with a lecture by J a m e s Salter. 
Salter, the renowned 

novelist and Salter 
short story writer who· has been hailed as "one of the best writers in this country" by critic Robert Burke, was the featured author for the first day of the festival. Salter shared some of 
his critically esteemed work along with insights on writing with an audience in the Oak Room. 
Salter began the lecture with a reading of his short story "Common." The story was meant to highlight Salter's distinct style of using the relationships between men and women to explore the intricacies of human desire. 
Following the reading, Salter spoke about why sue­

. cess among literary critics does not always translate to popular success. "Fame is a vapor, popularity an accident," Salter said. "You can only write what you are." Salter drove home the point that although an author's writing can and should devel­
op over time, the essence of his or her writing always will retain. its own identity. The 82-year-old Salter, who still has not received widespread popular acclaim, was upbeat about the prospect of success for himself and all aspiring writers. 
"You always have the possi­bility for success, even if you have never succeeded before," he said. 
Salter, an ex-fighter pilot and veteran of the Korean War, also discussed the importance of drawing from personal experience when writing. 
"In 'Common' alone, there are twelve people who I can think of that gave me ideas for parts of the story," he said. 
Salter explained how his writing is sustained by a well of life experiences combined with self-confidence -a quality "they don't teach you in the classroom." ft is this motivating and sustaining self-confidence that Salter said he wished to impart with his audience. 
The author also said the spirit of the Literary Festival and of his own motivation to continue to write is encapsu­lated in his favorite quotation from writer Samuel Johnson: "The chief glory of every peo­ple depends on its authors." 
The lecture series of the Literary Festival continues tonight at 5:30 in LaFortune Ballroom with Tasha Alexander and runs through Thursday.

Play 
continued from page 1 
instead of the DeBartolo Center for the Performing Arts after University President Father John Jenkins required that it take place in an academic setting. Jenkins' compromise for this year's event -he has not yet issued a formal long-term policy affecting future performances ­also meant organizers could not charge admission to the "Monologues" to raise money as they had in previous years. 
"It makes it a little less slick [having it in a classroom]," said Glenn Hendler, director of under­graduate studies and associate professor in the English depart­ment. "I think there are, in some ways, some good things about that. There's kind of a rawness and everydayness about it that I don't think other shows have. 
" ... [But] you're talking about not having the legitimacy that the theatre has. You're talking about not being able to raise money for the charities that are losing $15,000 they were expecting to get -that's not good. There's nothing good about that." 
The audience, more female than male, was enthusiastic and participative, singing along with songs played between individual monologues, laughing at appro­priate times and even yelling an expletive term for vagina when prompted by a monologue. 
Dean of the College of Arts and Letters Mark Roche was in atten­dance Monday, and he said it was his first time seeing "The Vagina Monologues." He also said he attended the play on his own accord -not at Jenkins' request -but declined to comment on his personal reactions to the event. 
Discussions with Roche helped initiate a departmental vote to decide whether the English department would sponsor "The Vagina Monologues" again this year, Hendler told The Observer for a Jan. 26 article. The vote to sponsor the play was unanimous among the 30 professors who attended the meeting, out of a department of about 40 people, Hendler said. 
Junior Madison Liddy, this year's director of "The Vagina Monologues" -who delivered an impassioned moiming perform­ance of her own as one of the play's fmal acts Monday -said she was pleased with the turnout on the first night and reinforced the importance of having the play on campus. 
"I think we are a determined bunch of girls and we're dedicat­ed [to the cause]," Liddy said. "If that means we have to get cre­ative in our ways, we will. No one is scared -we are vagina war­riors." 
Senior Lauren Williams, who attended Monday's showing and also saw "The Vagina Monologues" as a freshman, said she thinks the play brings impor­tant perspectives to campus. 
"The controversy made me want to support it more, having seen it and realizing that I sup­port the cause," Williams said. "Yes, absolutely [it belongs at Notre Dame]." 
Jackie Smith, a professor of sociology and peace studies who also served on the discussion panel following the play, said that after conducting much research on violence against women and seeing the performance for the first time, she thinks "The Vagina Monologues" needs to be per­formed at the University. 
"I think it should be here, it needs to be here," Smith said after the performance and before the panel. "I think the Church needs to be much more open to hearing the voices of women, and the fact that they're giving us such a hard time about perform­ing is exactly the message that this play is about. And by denying space for this kind of perform­ance on campus, we're really not doing our duty as a University to provide students with lots of dif­ferent perspectives on the world and on experiences of people, [and] we're also contributing to the continued silence and oppres­sion that comes from that." 
Freshman Chris Hall, who saw the play for the first time, said he enjoyed the performance and identified some academic aspects. 
"I thought it was a really good show," Hall said. "There were a lot of interesting points, different perspectives. I guess you could say it was educational." 
Freshman Jessica Keppel said her first experienc.e at "The Vagina Monologues" was a posi­tive one, although she was at times taken aback by its frank­ness. 
"I thought it was really awe­some," Keppel said. "I definitely wanted to go see it; I had heard all over about the whole academ­ic freedom thing. And violence against women is an issue really close to my heart. At first it shocked me at how frank they are, especially [the monologue entitled "Reclaiming (expletive)"]. That was just really frank and out there for me." 
Notre Dame Right to Life, which has demonstrated against the play in the past, decided not to protest Monday's event, saying the group instead would pray for those involved in the play. 
"We will continue to pray that those involved will realize that the play is an explicit, sexually provocative and inappropriate means of making a point about ending violence against women,'' club president Arina Grossu told The Observer in an e-mail. 
"The Vagina Monologues" will take place again tonight and Wednesday at 7 p.m. in 101 and 102 DeBartolo Hall, respectively, followed by a panel discussion at 9:15p.m.

Associated Press 
WASHINGTON Vice President Dick Cheney has been given a warning citation for breaking Texas hunting law by failing to buy a $7 stamp allow­ing him to shoot upland game birds. 
The warning came from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department after it investigated Cheney's accidental shooting of a fellow quail hunter Saturday on the private Armstrong Ranch in the south part of the state. 
The department found the accident was caused by a "hunter's judgment factor" when Cheney sprayed another hunter while aiming at flying birds. 
The report said the victim, prominent Republican attorney Harry Whittington of Austin, was retrieving a downed bird and stepped out of the hunting line he was sharing with Cheney. "Another covey was flushed and Cheney swung on a bird and fired, striking Whittington in the faee, neck and chest at approxi­mately 30 yards," the report said. 
Cheney, an experienced hunter, has not commented publiCly about the accident. His office said Monday night in a statement that Cheney had a $125 nonresi­dent hunting license and has sent a $7 check to cover the cost of the stamp. "The staff asked for all permits needed, but was not informed of the $7 upland game bird stamp requirement," the statement said. 

Whittington also received a warning for failing to have the stamp. A department spokesman said warnings are being issued in most cases because the stamp requirement only went into effect five months ago and many hunters aren't aware of it. 
Whittington was in stable con­dition at Christus Spohn Hospital Corpus Christi-Memorial and was moved from intensive care to a "step-down unit" Monday. Doctors decided to leave several birdshot pellets lodged in his skin rather than try to remove them. 
Katharine Armstrong, owner of the ranch where the shooting occurred, said it happened toward the end of the hunt, when it was still sunny but as darkness was eneroaching and they were preparing to go inside. She said Whittington made a mistake by not announcing that he had walked up to rejoin the hunting line, and Cheney didn't see him as he tried to down a bird. 
Armstrong said she saw Cheney's security detail running toward the scene. "The first thing that crossed my mind was he had a heart problem," she told The Associated Press. 
She said Cheney stayed "close but cool" while the agents and medical personnel treated Whittington, then took him by ambulance to the hospital. Later, 
originally had 
planned to have a 

strategy meeting for what they thought would be a whirlwind week of campaign­ing and debating for a run-off election, Shappell and Andrichik instead celebrated a victory last night in the student government office. 
The last time a ticket for stu­dent body president and vice president won the majority in the general eleetion was in 1999, when juniors Micah Murphy and Michael Palumbo won with 54.67 percent of the vote against nine other tickets.

She'll inevitably face diplomatie struggles with the University administration and the citizens of South Bend. And judging by the way this semester is going, I wouldn't be surprised if another obstacle were looming on the horizon. 
But the one thing Shappell won't have to worry about is whether she has the student body behind her, and after last night's voting, she can confi­dently stick it to whatever or whomever stands in the way.

FEMA ends hotel payment program 
NEW OHLEANS -A judge let the federal government Monday drop some 12,000 fami­lies made homeless by last year's hurricanes from a program that has been paying directly for their hotel rooms. 
FEMA has promised the evacuees from llurrieanns Katrina and Hita that they will still rnceive federal assistance that they can use toward hotel stays or fixing their ruined homes, although the agency will no longer pay for the hotels directly. 
Attorneys for the evaeuees tried to get U.S. District .Judge Stanwood Duval to issue a tem­porary restraining order, saying the fortheom­ing money from FEMA won't be enough for reasonable living accommodations or for hotel stays. 
Senate prepares $70 billion tax bill 
WA.'-;1 IINGTON-Senators argu11d Monday over the Bush administration's tax euts for investors while sending a $70 billion tax bill into final nngotiations. 
Although the bill makes no mention of tax eul'i li>r capital gains and dividends, Democral'i lined up motions to attack the tax reductions and H1~publkans rushed to defend them. 
The elnetion year dnbate proved a mostly politi­cal display. The motions under debate don't bind lawmaknrs who will hammer out the final ver­sion of the tax bill. They ean only make sugges­tions to nngotiators.

Fannie Mae misses housing goals 
Associated Press 
WASIIINGTON-Mortgage giant 
Fannie Mae last year fell a bit short 
of some of the government-set goals 
for making home ownership afford­
able as it worked to untangle its 
accounting in an $11 billion scan­
dal. 
A preliminary analysis by the gov­ernment-sponsored company, which finances one of every five home­mortgage loans in the United States, shows that it "fell slightly short" ­by less than 1 percent -of two housing "sub-goals," a Fannie Mae official said Monday. 
Bush administration officials have 
said in recent ynars that Fannie 

Mae and Freddie Mac, its smaller rival in the $8 trillion home-mort­gage market, must do more to help low-and moderate-income families become homeowners. In 2003, the companies met the government-set goals only because three unusual multibillion-dollar deals were counted toward the targets. 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mae have been under intense scrutiny and political pressure sinee their aecounting scandals surfaeed in September 2004 and June 2003, respectively. Legislation pending in Congress would tighten federal oversight of the two companies. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission, which has ordered Fannie Mae to restate earnings 
back to 2001, and the Office of Federal !lousing Enterprise Ovtlrsight are investigating the eom­pany's accounting. The Justice Dnpartment is pursuing a criminal investigation. 
"It ... appears that we fnll slightly short" of tho two sub-goals, Chuek Greener, Fannin Man's snnior viee president for communications, said in a statement. "We are fully com­mitted to working with IIUI> in an effort to meet these goals." 
The Department of !lousing and Urban Developmont sots tho annual affordable housing goals. II UD spokesman Lemar Wooley said the agency had no commnnt on tho matter because it hadn't ynt SIH~n Fannie Mae's loan data.

Sho-w relllembers dogs of Katrina 
Westminster Kennel Club show features video montage tribute 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -When he was a boy, Hiram Stewart took a bus to Virginia, put a puppy in a paper bag and cradled it all the way home to New Orleans. 
For more than three decades, he's cared for dogs in the Big Easy. Usually champion dogs, the kind that will reach the Best in Show ring this week at Westminster. 
Still, nothing prepared him for what he saw happening to pets around town after Hurricane Katrina hit. Like that pair of lit­tle beagles with the pleading eyes, chained inside a garage. 
"Every time a car would drive by, they'd come out, hoping it was their owner," Stewart said. "I knew the situation better than those two poor dogs did. It wasn't going to be just a few days." · 
Stewart believes those beagles came out OK. But thousands of their companions didn't, and America's most prestigious dog show remembered them -and those who helped -with a moving tribute Monday night at Madison Square Garden. 
Hours earlier, the Westminster Kennel Club show started a day after the biggest snowstorm in city history blan­keted New York. A total of 2,622 dogs in 165 breeds and varieties were entered -some didn't make it because of the bad weather, though there was no exact count. 
A colored bull terrier named Rufus, the top-winning pug ever, a Rottweiler led by a for­mer Florida State linebacker and a Dalmatian called Boomer were the big winners Monday night. 
In a show featuring lots of underdogs, Rufus beat a favored Norfolk terrier named

There was hardly a dry eye in the building in 2002 when 20 German shepherds and retriev­ers came onto the Garden's green carpet to honor search and rescue dogs for their tire­less work at the World Trade Center and Pentagon after the Sept. 11 attacks. 
The Katrina tribute, featuring dogs and those that saved them, brought a standing ovation. 
A video montage on the score­board showed images of injured and abandoned dogs, accompa­nied by a song from Jackson Browne. Moments later, a half­dozen dogs with Gulf Coast con­nections were introduced, and left Covington, La. 
Her husband stayed behiqd with a horse and two Basenjis; one of the dogs ran away when the winds blew and was killed. 
"I saw some terrible things along the drive. People just let­ting their pets out on the side of the road. I don't see how any­one could do that," she said. "The things people did to their animals during Katrina are inexcusable." 
Lashes, a champion Chinese Shar-Pei, is now with Myers at Westminster. 
"I thought about not coming this year, but this continuity, it's a rite of passage," she said. "If I didn't do this, I've given in to the adversity." 
Stewart, one of the most high­ly regarded handlers in the business, was set to attend Westminster again. His mother died last week, and he stayed home in Kenner, La. 

IRAN 

Newspaper requests Holocaust cartoons 
Contest responds to Muhammad cartoons 
Associated Press 
TEI-IHAN -An Iranian newspaper's contest for car­toons about the Holocaust, launched Monday in response to a series of caricatures about the Prophet Muhammad, has already drawn at least one entry, the paper said. 
Hamshahri, one of Iran's top five newspapers, said its con­test was a test of the Western world's readiness to print car­toons about the Nazi slaughter of 6 million Jews in World War 
II. It called for cartoons under the title: "What is the Limit of Western Freedom of Expression?" 
The caricatures of the prophet, which first appeared in a Danish newspaper and were reprinted in several European newspapers that cited freedom of expression, have outraged Muslims and generated protests worldwide. 
The first entry in the Iranian contest depicts a man smoking a cigarette and wearing a blue and white striped prison uni­form, with a tall wall and guard tower in the back­ground. 
The man, with a mustache and several days growth of beard, is wearing a white kef­fiyeh and is holding his right hand over his forehead and eyes. 
On his chest is a red Muslim crescent with a letter "P." Below that is the number 7256, the significance of which was not immediately clear, although Israel is said to be holding about 8,000 Palestinian prisoners. 
The Brazilian artist listed as the author of the cartoon could not immediately be reached to confirm the entry was by him. 
Masoud Shojai, chairman of the committee that will judge the contest, said an Australian was among those who sent entries to the contest last week before it was oflicially opened. 
But Michael Leunig, one of Australia's best-known car­toonists, on Tuesday denied entering two of his works in the contest, saying he was the victim of fraud. 
"I learned last night that some of my cartoons from a few years back have been sub­mitted as an entry in that com­petition," Leunig told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio. "This is· a fraud and hoax emanating, we believe, from Australia." 
Leunig said had been con­tacted late Monday by a con­cerned editor at Melbourne's The Age newspaper, which publishes many of his car­toons. 
The cartoons were pulled from the Iranian newspaper's Web site after he contacted their editors, Leunig said. 
"A reply came back, they were sorry, they removed the cartoon instantly without a qualm and with an apology," he said. 
An Iranian Web site for car­toonists carried a reproduc­tion of the Brazilian entry and printed a notice at the top of the page that indicated it might also be connected to a conference sponsored by Iran's Foreign Ministry to examine what it called the sci­entific evidence surrounding the Holocaust. 
An English-language notice on the site warned that it "possibly will be closed by United States." It then provid­ed links to three other sites.

The talks with Hussia had been slated for Thursday but were postponed indefinitely because of the "new situation,"· said Iranian presidential spokesman Gholamhossein Elham. He was referring to the IAEA's decision this month to report Iran to the U.N. Security Council because of uncertainty over its nuclear intentions.

bomb. 
Moseow had proposed that Iran ship its uranium to Russia, where it would be enriched to a level suitable for nuclear reac­tors. It would then be returned to Iran for use at the Hussian­built Bushehr plant, which is due to begin operating this year. 
The plan, backed by the United States and the European Union, was an attempt to avoid international objections to Iranian uranium enrichment by providing oversight so no weapons would be made. Iran had said the plan did not fulfill its requirements but was worth pursuing. 
Despite resumption of enrich­ment, uranium gas must be fed 
into hundreds 
of centrifuges 
warheads. 
Iran is years away from running the 50,000 centrifuges it says it wants to operate as a souree of fuel for its Bushehr plant. 
But even small-seale enrich­ment is significant because it represents symbolic determina­tion by Tehran to go ahead with a technology that most nations want it to give up because of fears of misuse. 
In Washington, White House press secretary Scott McClellan said Iran's restarting of enrich­ment shows its "continued defi­ance of the world." 
"The regime in Iran knows what it needs to do," he said. "So far, they're continuing to choose defiance and confronta­tion over cooperation and diplo­macy." 
Also Monday, Tehran issued its third veilnd threat in as many days to withdraw from the Nudear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
If the intnrnational community does not agrne to Iran's right to enrich uranium under the NP'I: "there is no reason to continue our current nudear policy while we are deprived of the positive aspects of the treaty," said a spokesman for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. 
North Korea -the world's other major proliferation eon­cern -quit the treaty in January 2003, just a few months before U.S. officials announced that the North had told them it had nudear weapons and may test, export or use them depending on U.S. actions. 
Iran had warned it would resume large-scale enrichment of uranium al'ter it was reported Feb. 4 to the U.N. Security Council by the 35-nation IAE/\ board. The resolution indirectly linked the referral to breaches of the treaty and eonecrns that Tehran's activities representnd a threat to world peaee. 
The lAEA is to issue a report on Iran at its Mareh meeting. After. that, the Security Council is expected to consider taking steps against the country. 
German officials expressed disappointment the Moscow meetings were postponed. 
Canceling or postponing the talks means the time before the March IAEA meeting "would not be used as efl'ectively as is possi­ble and neeessary to push on toward a diplomatic solution," German Foreign Ministry spokesman Jens Ploetner said. 
On behalf of the European Union, Germany, Britain and Franee had conducted lengthy but essentially fruitless discus­sions with the Iranians hoping promises of civilian nuelear technology and other economic incentives would lure Iran away from the nuclear path that could produce weapons. 
Associated Press 
TEHHAN -Iran notched up the brinksmanship over its dis­puted nuclear program Monday, abruptly postponing talks with Moscow on a plan to enrieh Tehran's uranium on Russian territory to allay fears it is build­ing an atomic weapon. 
Diplomats in Europe said Iran had started small-scale enrich­ment of uranium, a process that ean produce fuel for an atomic bomb. 
"Uranium gas has been fed into three machines," said a senior diplomat in Vienna, Austria, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment on the matter. Another diplomat confirmed

I have a confession to make. 

I, Scott Wagner of the College Libertarians, am a feminist. Yes, it is true. In my intellectual pursuit of practical libertarian philosophy, in opposing oppression and coercion in its myriad forms, I have developed quite the infatuation with the female lib­eration movement. Indeed, American feminist author Marilyn French said it best when, in her novel "The Women's Room," she pro­claimed: "Whatever they may be in pub­lic life, whatever their relations with men, in their relations with women, all men are rapists and that's all they are." 
Wait a moment. Perhaps I'll take off my "boys are stupid, throw rocks at them" T-shirt for a second and ponder that quotation. I mean, such misandry seems somewhat counterproductive to the primary goal of feminism: equali­ty. 
So as Susan Brownmiller, author and historian, said: "[Rape] is nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear." 
Okay, now I am confused. Or how about former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan: "I believe that women have a capacity for under­standing and compassion which a man structurally does not have, does not have it because he cannot have it. He's just incapable of it." 
Maybe my point has been made. Feminism has, in many ways, correct­ly or incorrectly become synonymous with misandry; I vividly remember hearing Rush Limbaugh on my grand­parents' radio ranting about the "fem­inazis." Ideas of "lesbian separatism" and "testosterone poisoning" are aspects of an intellectual field that

has, in many ways, lost sight of its own importance. Instead of building support, much of feminist theory iso­lates it from the mainstream. Even "moderate" feminism, such as that espoused by the National Organization for Women, is anything but moderate. All of it is slanting left (unnecessarily, in my opinion) to some degree. 
Radical feminism emerged in the late 1960s. In many ways, not merely politically, it still shares a fundamen­tal mentality with Marxism: oppressor vs. oppressed, us vs. them. Many femi­nists associated the existence of Western patriarchy with class divi­sion, and Marxism became fairly pop­ular within many radical feminist cir­cles. Much of feminist ideology is con­comitant with left-wing principles of economic redistribution, centralized state power and pseudo-egalitarian­ism. 
Despite what you may be thinking, however, I stand by my first two sen­tences. In using the term "feminist" to describe myself, I also choose to reject the socialist sentiments that gave birth to much of today's contemporary feminism. 
The important question now becomes: is it even possible to disas­sociate feminism from the left? 
In fact, it is. A newly energized movement within feminism is gaining popularity; it does not build itself around a collective, sexual identity that fosters "gender war." It is termed (appropriately enough) "individualist feminism," and its roots go back to the 19th century when many female aboli­tionists found themselves in an uncan­nily similar struggle against their own legalized repression. Why fight for the rights of slaves when, for all intents and purposes, you were still a slave yourself? . 
Wendy McElroy, editor of the web­site www.ifeminists.com, is a major force within the ifeminist movement. She defines ifeminism in the following way: "The 21st-century feminist is anyone -female or male -who rejects gender privilege and demands real equality for men and women under the law. She makes her own choices and takes personal responsi­bility for them." McElroy identifies at least three major goals of ifeminism: 
1) The removal of all laws that distin­guish between men and women; 2) defense of all lifestyle choices, whether they be to "stay at home" or run a multinational corporation; and 
3) inclusion of males in all aspects of feminist discourse. To quote the ifemi­nists' website: "It is folly to 'solve' a human problem without consulting and co-operating with one-half of the species." 
Those of you who are in the least bit acquainted with libertarianism may find the idea of ifeminism somewhat dubious. The fact is, ifeminism -at its core-is libertarianism, though specifically focused on the "role" women have within it. But like I said, if you are already familiar with liber­tarianism, you know that the philoso­phy makes absolutely no legal or polit­ical distinction between men and women. So the female "role" in society is, elementally, the same as the male: make your own choices, deal with the consequences and harm no one. 
There is no "damaged chromosome" theory. There is no massive "anarcha­commune" necessary, nor a reevalua­tion of gender roles on a civilization­wide scale. Instead, there is the sim­ple notion that men and women are equal, and justice must be "gender­blind." It does not get any simpler than that, or more beautifuL 
So that, ladies and gentlemen, is the story of my love affair with feminism. Have a happy V-Day today, whatever that may mean to you.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Lack of vote troubling 
I'm a first-generation darner, and this is my first year. I couldn't wait for Feb. 13 to come by: it was election day on campus. I had read up on every candidate, looked at all their platforms, and I was ready to vote. Imagine my surprise when I was told I'm not allowed to vote. The reason? I'm a grad student. Now, I know there is an organization called the "GSU" for a grad student like me (which, incidentally, doesn't represent all graduate stu­dents-sorry MBA and law students!) However, when someone is representing Notre Dame as "Student Body President," should not the entire student body· be able to vote for him or her? I have a student ID card. It's the same card everyone else uses for Domer Dollars, to get into the dining hall or to go to pep rallies. When I watch home games, I'm standing in the student section. Heck, I even get the student discount at Cafe de Grasta. 
Why is this so important? The very issues that affect undergraduate students also affect us grad students as welL The (undergraduate) student government has com­mittees on minority affairs and diversity. Did you know

that the graduate student population is more diverse than the undergraduate population? A great many of us come from outside the United States and have many dif­ferent backgrounds (I myself am a Canadian-born Muslim with Bangladeshi parents-how much more of a minori­ty can I be, eh?). 
The student government also has voting representa­tives from dorms on campus. Yet, Fisher-Graduate and O'Hara-Grace are not included. Don't grad students have rectors too'? If we violate DuLac, are we not in trouble as well? Heck, there are also senior undergraduates living there-will they not be represented? But the biggest reason why this is important to me is because of some­thing I learned very early on after coming to Notre Dame. We are one big family. We are ND. And when we all grad­uate, we join one governing association. Isn't it fair to do the same before we graduate?

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Carry out simple fact-checking 
My f'rinnd and eollna).{un in philosophy, Fritz Warlinld, wrotn a pin!:(~ ("Contesting aradnmie ~~quivaiPnce") in tho Fob. I 0 Vinwpoint sodion of'Thn Obsnrvnr critiml of' a mmnwnt madn by Univnrsity President Fatlwr John .Jnnkins in a Catholic: News Snrvicn (CNS) rdnasn of' Fob. 3. Warliold quotnd Jnnkins lL'i having said that acadnm­ir f'rnndom at Notrn Damn "is tho samn aca­d!Hnic f'rnndom that is enjoyed olsnwhere." lin tlwn ehallongml Jnnkins and his minions to invnstigate this daim hy asking "prnsi­dnnL'i and departnwnt chairs at m<\jor uni­vnrsitins wlwther acadomic f'rnedom at thnir institutions pnrmits academic dnpart­menL'i to sponsor nvnnL'i as they see lit. Thn <mswnr ono can oxpnd to w~t is an unam­biguous yns." Warlinld pointml his readnrs to tlw lJnivnrsity of' Michigan as a particular nxampln. 
tJnlin'lunatdy, Warlinld's lnttnr litils to providn a eontnxt for Jenkins' rnmark and appnars to pnrpntuatP tlw myth that secular univnrsitins arn in !W!~ry rnspod f'rnnr than Catholic univnrsit.ins. 111~ would have rnad­Prs hnlievo .lfmkins was making a broad gmwralization about 1wnry facet of acadmn­if' lili~ at rw~jor univm·sitins, or at lnast that .Jenkins was making a claim about academ­ic dnpartnwnL'i. Otlwrwisn what acadmnic dnpartnwnL'i at othnr univnrsitins do would not posf' tho counterexample that Warfield would likn. 
And ynt tho actual eon text of Jenkins' rmnarks rnported in the CNS story makes it dnar that he was not making any sueh broad claim. I In was simply describing the academic freedom enjoyed by students and scholars to think a<> they please, publish the n~sull<> of their research and speak about thnir rnspective spm:ialties. CNS para­phra'ind Jenkins a'> holding that "At Notre Dame. scholars and student<>-including non-Catholics-have the right to think what they like, publish their researeh and speak about their field of expertise." The story then immediately quoted him as say­ing "It is the same academic freedom that is enjoyed anywhere else." The pronoun "it" in the direct quotation from Jenkins dearly refers to the preceding daim about the frnndom of students and scholars to publish and spmtk about fields of' expnrtisn. It makes no reliwence to departments and other academic units within universities, or to the issue of their eapaeity to sponsor evenl'i. 
I lowever. the story then immediately reports that Jenkins himself raised the question of the role of academie dopart­menL<> and their sponsorship of events in his examination of questions of academie free­dom. Thus the story describes him as sug­gesting that "a university may want to look critically at what events are being spon­sored and seemingly endorsed by its aca­demic dnpartmen ts" in light of thH mission and r.haraetnr of the university. Anyone who listmwd to.Jnnkins' talk with tho fiteul­ty knows that he highlighted this as a cen­tral issue li1r the academie community to think through. As Jnan Portnr pointnd out in her comnwnts at the talk. it is perhaps the most challenging issue we confront, a point that .Jenkins readily eonceded. For my colloaguo to insist that the behavior of departments at other institutions snttles the caso against Jonkins' quotation in the CNS is both snloctivnly to quote Jenkins out of context and to beg the very question that he has raisod and that everyone attnntive to his discussion knows that he has raised. 
WarliHid suggests that it is a simple "fact­checking exerdse" to determine that at other major universities, the University of Michigan bHing his ehosen example, "aca­demic departments [are free) to sponsor events as they see fit." The University of Michigan is an ironic choice. In the late· 1980s, it tried to impose a speeeh eode upon the university community so broad that not only was it thought by many to be in eonllict with academic freedom, but was struck down by the courts as violating the Constitution of the United States in Doe v. University of Michigan (1989). 
Irony aside, on Jan. 27 of this year, the departments of philosophy and theology at tim Univnrsity of Notre Dame sponsornd an event, a Homan Catholic Mass to celebrate the vigil feast of St. Thomas Aquinas. Given that St. Thomas is the patron saint of' uni­vnrsities and students, this was not only a liturgical event but also an academie (Went. induding an erudite homily about the nature of Catholic intellectual life and uni­versitins, as well as prayer li1r thn University, its students, faculty and stall'. Several hundred students, fiu:ulty, stan· and community members filled the Basilica of the Sacred I lnart. Such an event perf(~ctly exemplifies the Catholic refusal to sehrrngatn the worship of God from the intnlleetuallife, or to divorce faith from reason in <H:admn­ies, in contrast to prevailing secular norms like those at the University of Michigan and elsnwhern. Or does my colleague rnally bolieve that the department of philosophy at the Uniw~rsity of Michigan is frne to spon­sor this type of event "as it sees lit?" 
This past autumn. thn department of phi­losophy at the University of Notre Damn sponsored the annual meeting of the American Catholic Philosophieal Association. At the request of the leadnrship of the dnpartmnnt. the College of' Arts and Lettnrs provided several thousand dollars to underwrite the activities of the Association. In order to bring this association to Notm Dame, the department had to commit itself to oflieial sponsorship so that the A<>soeiation's regular daily Ma<>ses eould take place on campus. This commitment was required by the Association in order to meet here. Again, does my colleague believe that if we asked the chair of the department of philosophy at the University of Michigan, he would claim that his department is free to sponsor this profes­sional gathering of philosophers, as part of its freedom to sponsor events "as it sees fit?" The University of Michigan and its department of philosophy could sponsor Roman Catholic Masses "as [they] see fit?" I doubt that a claim that they do not endorse what they would be sponsoring would cut it in this ease. 
Of course. tlw same is tnw or all secular universitif~s. Tlwir norms and values. including assumptions that n~ligious wor­ship and acadmnic. lit(~ bn rigorously divorcnd. constrain tlwir frnndom to host nvenL'i such as the annualrnnnting of tlw Ameriean Catholi1: Philosophical A'isodation. So much liJr the myth that sec­ular universities ipso faeto have grnatnr aeadmnie rreodom than Catholic univf~rsi­tins. 
Notre Damn is f'ren to draw within iL'ielf that which is best in thn sm~ular acadmny, particularly thn ).{ifts and talonto.; of thoso who may not sham the animating rnligious lhith of iL'> mission. But it is also fron to go beyond and abovo that sonrlar frn1~dorn to placn what it dons at the serviee and in thf' hands of tho Sacrnd. As with any frendom, thnn are partkular rosponsibilitios that attend the grnatnr frnndorn pres1mt at a Catholic univorsity, and particular dillinrl­ties that will arise bncausn of it. as tim com­munity tries to protm~t and promote that frnedom. But in our discussion of' those problnms, it is worthwhile nmwrnbnring that they am diflinrltins that arisn and ean bn considerml horn proeisnly bneausn of' our grnatnr frnmlom. 
.Jnnkins deserib1~d aeadnmie frendom <L'i "sacrnd." But it is diflicult to soo how it can be gmminoly so in communities that posi­tively exelude any hint of the gmmirwly sacred from entnring into thoir midst. If academie unil'i sueh as the department or philosophy at the Univf~rsity of Michigan are unable to sponsor a mHeting of a profes­sional association of philosophers. tlwir aeademic freedom could hardly bn deseribed a<> "saered," and Warfield's daim that they am able to sponsor "evenl<> a'> they see lit" is falsH. It would appear that he has failed to earry out the simple faet­cheeking he urges upon Jenkins and his minions.

University profits vs. student losses 
A<> an avid hoekey fan, I was more than willing to arrive early at this weekend's hockey game. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by ushers who informed us that we were to sit at least three rows up from the ice, as the University was selling tickets in the student sec­tion to the general public. As disappointing as this was, we were appreciative of the pre-warning from the staff, as it allowed us to get seal<; where we were assured that we could enjoy the game without having to move. Shortly after we were seated, the first row, then the second and then the third row filled up. At this point, we expected that the staff would have eonveyed to the box office that the section was filled and tieket sales would havH ceased, but this wa'> not th1~ elL'>fl. 
Soon, student<> in the fourth row of the student section were asked to move. By this point, the aisles were teeming with seatless stu­denL'i. An usher approaehed our group and asked us if we had tick­Ill'>, which we did, and then asked to see them. The group complied with this request and wa'i greeted with the sarcastic response from the usher of, "Well arnn 't you the smartest group of students that I have ever seen. You didn't pay fi1r this seat, and you have to move." We calmly explainml that we were told that we were allowed to sit whom we worn by one ofthe other ushers. Even if we wHre to move, where wore we to go, seeing as how the stands and aisles worn packnd with pnople'! The "professionalism" of one member of the .JACC stall' sueeessfully managed to ruin the first period for many of the studnnts who had eo me to enjoy a night of Irish hockey. Hdlnding on Friday night's evnnl'i, I havH to wonder, what was the Univnrsity thinking? 
Obviously dollar signs were more important than the students of Notm Dame in this ease. In the futuro, I hope that the .JACC staff manages evnnLo.; with morn prof(Jssionalism and eourtcsy to all per­sons involved.

/sci~\& flhoI And the award goes to ... 
'Tis the season to be Joan Rivers. Marked by a parade of Escada, Prada and Chane!, countless specials onE! and, of course, the red carpet award ceremo­ny season, 2006 is officially underway. 
The Oscars, Golden Globes and even the Screen Actors Guild Awards offer us a glimpse into the glamorous lives of our favorite celebrities as they pay tribute to the 


previous year's most talented Mary Squillace actors. As the king of all Scene Critic award shows, the Oscars dictates to us which films we should have enjoyed. Alternatively, the Golden Globes offers us the city recreational league of film and television award shows, in that even the competitors who don't quite have what it takes to make the varsity squad get a chance to vie for shiny gold hardware. And the Screen Actors Guild forces us to look at acting as an art. However, regardless of the differences between these programs, after awhile they all blend together, each star becom­ing a beaming, faceless mass in a Versace gown. Instead, the award for best award show has to go to the Grammys -a slightly edgier and eclectic presentation. Sure, the Golden Globes effectively brings together film-buffs and couch­potatoes alike, but the Grammy Awards deliver real diversity, uniting NASCAR­watching Toby Keith fans and teenaged girls holding their breath for a Maroon 5 victory under the same three-hour block of television. The Grammy Awards' stage in itself is a melting pot. For years it has drawn artists together for collaborations that have transcended age, race and style. In fact, the vibes of euphoria on this stage are so strong that they even once moved Eminem to extend his hand to Elton John in the name of music, and, oh yeah, pub­licity. The stage is a place where acts with questionable stay-power, like Linkin Park, can earn credibility by performing with the legendary Paul McCartney and industry mogul, Jay-Z. Conversely, the Grammy stage also gives stars on the verge of washing up a chance .to prove that they have yet to kick the entertain­ment-biz bucket by pairing up with hip­per, trendier acts. In the past, Madonna's Grammy per­formance filled her with such a sense of 
effervescence that she took part in that unforgettable sorority-girl stunt where she locked lips with performer Britney Spears. This same youthful feeling must have inspired Madonna again during last week's 2006 awards, compelling her to don a leotard. 
The Grammy's wide range of nominees and award recipients also lends itself to a number of Cinderella stories. Take Kelly Clarkson, who, despite her recent suc­cess, still appears as star-struck as her own screaming fans. And while Bruce Springsteen and Bonnie Raitt probably had no idea who the girl sobbing at the podium was, they probably still can't get "Since You've Been Gone" out of their heads. 
Although Kelly represents a touching rags-to-riches story, this year's true Grammy miracle was Mariah Carey's resurrection. Her sanity may not yet be fully intact, but it appears that Mariah's career is back on track, and she has eight Grammy nominations to show for it. Now she only has to garner about four more awards and find a cure for cancer before she fully redeems herself for sub­jecting us all to "Glitter." 
Additionally, unlike the recipients of Oscar, Golden Globe, or SAG awards­for the most part-Grammy award recipients have no formal acting training. Furthermore, they deserve extra recog­nition for their efforts in trying to convey a careful balance between elation and gratitude during acceptance speeches. To add to their challenge, recording artists also have to preserve their deviant musi­cian reputations by saying something radical -typically, approaches that pro­mote a political cause or are completely self-promoting work. 
Not to mention, regardless of seat assignment-which could place some­one anywhere from sandwiched between Eminem's entourage or next to this year's nominee's for best New Age album (who has a Grandparent-esque understanding of songs like "Gold Digger") -artists have to maintain those made-for-TV smiles while seated. After all, no one wants to appear on the Grammy big screen broadcast with a gigantic gri­mace. 
So while we may be knee-deep in the fanfare of award shows with the Oscars just around the corner, don't expect the others to live up to the antics that the Grammy's and its collection of eccentric performers brought last week.

BooK REVIEW 
'Arthur and George' 
By ROQUE STREW Scene Critic 
While Julian Barnes' work is generally feted for its oh-so-clever innovations and clanging forward motion, his new novel is ­both in milieu and manner -an august voy­age backward. 
Like "Flaubert's Parrot," Arthur and George enlarges and bedecks a moment of history with the ornaments of his imagina­tion. But shorn of that book's souped-up, highbrow experiments, "Arthur and George" gains a warmth and humility that radiates from its first pages. 
Around the turn of the century, and con­sidered its version of France's Dreyfus Affair, a string of animal mutilations enveloped Britain in scandal. Named after the Staffordshire village in which they occurred, the Great Wyrley Outrages offer the spark for Barnes' two tales -a narrative double helix twisting the lives of Arthur Conan Doyle and George Edalji into proximity. 
Arthur is, of course, the famous creator of Sherlock Holmes. George is a humble solici­tor and the casualty of a vicious miscarriage of justice -wrongfully convicted and incar­cerated in 1903, he is the Dreyfus to Arthur's Zola. On its face, the book examines the route by which Doyle came to Edajli's res­cue. To his credit, Barnes is something of a trickster and the book is much deeper, enriched by a larger investigation -the ugly psychology of the zeitgeist. 
Cutting between the developments of the eponymous characters -Arthur on one page, George on the next -at times, Barnes gen­tly choreographs the final collision of their fates. Where Arthur was raised Catholic in shabby-ge,nteel Edinburgh, George was brought up in a Church of England vicarage. Arthur was a sporting ·ophthalmologist turned writer -an overnight success. George toiled in obscurity, a solicitor and author of a tract on railway law. The two men seemed destined never to meet. 
The rhetorical question that runs through "Arthur and George"-how can you make Jl sense of the beginning unless you know the fc ending? -sheds light on Barnes' self-reflexive treatment of destiny, or the way an author's hand can shape and reshape the past to suit B his designs. Barnes threshed acres of ~ research to accumulate the book's raw c material. The sturdy structure into which he p transforms it gives the whole novel an air of e inevitability -the Whig history of two des­n perate men.

VIDEO GAME REVIEW 
'Special Forces' exp_ 
.......... 
By TREVOR GASS Scene Critic 
It's the next best thing since the last best thing. 
In a world where some of the most antici­pated games are re-hashes of previous suc­cesses, developers know that the quicker they can turn out another title, the quicker they can turn a tidy profit. 
However, a recent avenue that developers have found to be profitable is something called the expansion pack. Expansion packs are traditionally cheaper than the base game and work to promote high replay value at low production cost. Entirely new game engines need not be designed in the world of expansion packs. Simply a new level, gadget or side story needs to be devel­oped, something that can easily be incorpo­rated into the current game engine. 
Enter "Battlefield 2: Special Forces." If you're wondering whether or not "Special Forces" is special enough to earn your hard earned $30, ask these questions -Do the possibilities of new maps excite you into frenzy? Does the concept of additional weaponry make your gun finger twitch in excitement? Does the idea of more complex strategy make you shake in your computer chair in anticipation? 
"Special Forces" adds a selection of five new weapons that can be unlocked through online ranked play. These include the over­powered F2000 assault rifle/grenade launch­er and the ridiculously accurate G36E. The Russian RPG is also a fun addition. Since many of these guns can be used on all servers, they can give you an advantage over players who conserved their money for other things like dates with girlfriends. 
New maps and armies have also been added. There are few real differences in the ability to play as the Russian Spetsnaz other than the starting weapons, the language they speak in-game and the victory and defeat tunes that end each round. 
The new maps do their job by keeping the game fresh and adding new elements that highlight the other additions. Beyond the new weaponry, support equipment has been added to spice up the tactical side of frag­ging friends. Night maps have made grainy

ern playfulness of the writing to which they have grown accustomed. It is, to them, unbe­coming in its straightforwardness. But they would be mistaken. Written with Flaubert's formal purity, in a stately Edwardian mode, "Arthur and George" is a luminously unas­suming return to form, solidly rooted in his motherland's fraught past -the clash of entitled imperialism and the new century's promise of a level, color-blind world. 
Quoting Doyle at one point, Barnes recites his list of writerly imperatives -"Firstly, to be intelligible, secondly, to be interesting, and thirdly, to be clever." While balancing the demands of the detective novel and dou­ble biography, "Arthur and George" elegant­ly pays homage not only to a writer, but also to a forgotten epoch and its sensibility.

"Special Forces" is a solid addition to the "Battlefield" universe, but at the price of $30, more enticing purchases are easy to find. More people still play on the normal "Battlefield 2" servers where plenty of mili­tary mayhem can be found. If you track down someone with the new guns unlocked, you can steal their weapon and play with it as your own. If you think it's worth 30 big ones, go from there. "European Forces," the second expansion for "Battlefield 2", comes out later this month.

There is no proof' that the athletes did anything wrong: Elevated hemoglobin can be caused by simple dehydra­tion or by the body getting acclimated to higher eleva­tions. But the test result raised the possibility of blood doping with synthetic hemo­globin or transfusions; the International Ski Federation routinely suspends skiers who test for high hemoglobin as a precaution. 
The German ski federation appealed Sachenbacher's case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which turned down the request Saturday.

Associated Press 

TURIN. Italy -Wayne Gretzky arrives Tuesday at the Olympics, and a nerv­ous Canada wonders if he's bringing the formula for another hockey gold medal or a whole mess of trouble. 
No matter what Team Canada does starting Wednesday, questions will accompany Gretzky throughout the games about what he knows, if anything, about a gam­bling ring allegedly fronted by his top assistant coach with the NHL's Phoenix Coyotes and sHpposedly patronized by Gretzky's wife. 
Yes, actress Janet Jones is accompanying her hus­band to Turin as the Coyotes' coach reprises his 2002 role as gold medal­winning Team Canada's executive director. But how much excess baggage are they packing with them, and will it weigh down a team that is favored to fol­low up the gold won by that Gretzky-assembled team four years ago? 
Unlike those Salt Lake City Olympics when Gretzky tried relieving the heavy pressure on a team that was slumping early in the games by charging "the whole world wants us to lose," this distraction was­n't intentionally perpetrat­ed. 
Gretzky has said he didn't bet with the gambling ring and knew nothing about it, even though his best friend allegedly ran it and his wife is linked to it. But Gretzky has said little else, and no doubt wishes to keep it that way during the Olympics. 
"The bottom line is I did­n't do it," he said. 
As much as he tries, Gretzky can't escape the questions. At a news con­ference in Ontario on Monday -his fmal media availability before he left for Turin -the NHL great repeatedly was asked about the integrity of the game. 
"That's not for me to talk about," said Gretzky, before a Hockey Canada official cut off the news conference after just 4 1/2 minutes. 
The very mention of Gretzky's name has caused an appreciable stir in a sport where his reputation and conduct have been beyond reproach. And it certainly hasn't been a wel­comed mention -especial­ly not in Canada, where hopes are high that this is the best team the country has fielded in its national sport. 
IN BRIEF 

Hughes to replace Kwan on 
USA figure si{ating team 
SYOSSET, N.Y. -Figure skater Emily Hughes practiced at a rink near her hometown Monday. How she's getting to Italy for the Olympics was still being worked out. 
The 17 -year-old younger sister of 2002 Olympic winner Sarah Hughes was told Saturday night by U.S. skat­ing officials to pack for Turin to replace Michelle Kwan, who pulled out because of an injury. 
Hughes, from Great Neck, N.Y., finished third at nationals last month but was bumped after Kwan got the medical bye onto the Olympic team. 
John Hughes, Emily's father, told The Associated Press in a phone interview on Monday that he was still trying to make flight arrange­ments for Italy. 
"It's more difficult than you think," he said. "We'll get there. I promise." 
John Hughes said he thought Emily would arrivey too late· to prac­tice in a mountain town near Turin with the other U.S. skaters, Sasha Cohen and Kimmie Meissner. 
!JSA ups~ts Norway in curl­
mg openmg round 
PINEROLO, Italy-The U.S. men routed the defending Olympic cham­pions 11-5 in the opening game of the curling tournament on Monday, scoring a whopping five points in the eighth end and forcing Norway to concede with two frames to go. 
It was tied 3-3 in the fifth when American skip, or captain, Pete Penson knocked out a red Norwegian stone and left three yel­low ones closest to the middle. Norway made it 6-5 in the sixth and was setting up for another three points in the seventh when U.S. vice­skip Shawn Rojeski executed a per­fect three-stone takeout. 
With an open target, Penson threw long with his first stone and then intentionally threw his second through the house -giving up an easy point to retain the last-throw advantage and try for multiple "QOints in the eighth. 
Johnson's crew chief eject­
ed from Daytona 500 
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -Jimmie Johnson's crew chief was thrown out of the Daytona 500 on Monday for illegal modifications made to Johnson's car during pole qualifying. 
Chad Knaus was accused of rais­ing the rear window on the No. 48 Chevrolet to alter aerodynamics dur­ing Johnson's run Sunday. The infraction was discovered in a post­qualifying inspection when the car failed to fit NASCAR templates. 
NASCAR said Knaus cannot appeal the ejection. 
NASCAR also said the Hendrick Motorsports team could be subject to additional penalties, which would be announced after Sunday's Daytona 500. 
Team owner Rick Hendrick said lead engineer Darian Grubb will replace Knaus as crew chief for Sunday's "Great American Race."

Slwn Xuc and Zhao llongbo or China won thoir sncond straight bronzo modal. 
A Hussian or Sovint pair has won tho gold nwdal nvery year siru~n 11)(14, and this one was as good as any. Go ahead, add Totmianina and Marinin to Gordnova and Grinkov and the l'rotopopovs as the top of pnr­haps the greatest dynasty in Olympie sports. 
"I can't oven explain the emo­tions because thny are vnry vnry high," she said. "It was a long, long way and it wasn't tho easinst way. I'm just thrilled with everything. We've done so Wllll, our personal best at the Olyrnpie Garnes." 
While the Hussians were untouchable, Zhang and Zhang showed incredibln courage and stamina. 
Skating last, Zhang Dan fell in a split while attempting ·an unpreeedonted throw quad sal­chow and doubled over in pain. They stoppnd skating as Zhang llao struggled to help her ofT the ice. 
After a fnw minutes talking with eoadws, she asked to con­tinue. With the fans dapping in support, the nvent rnf'ernn allownd it. 
"Wn didn't say any words of' giving up," he said. "Wn said wn could go on." 
Somehow, they nailed every element in the next four min­utes.

"I think it's a very valuable experience for competition," she said. "It's so important for rnysnlf because I made a mis­take on tho first element, but I think I can do all the other ele­ments, so why not keep going?" 
But they were far behind Tot and Max's ·personal best of 204.4H, and Marinin picked up his longtime partner and cra­dled her in his arms when the final scorns were posted. 
No one raised a voice against the scoring this time, unlike the boos that echoed throughout the arona at Salt Lake City. touching ofT the biggest scandal in Winter Games history. 
Baek then, a French judge admitted after the pairs compe­tition that she'd been "pres­sured" to put Hussia's Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze ahead of Canada's Jamie Sale and David Pelletier. 
The scandal so rocked the 


Olympics that the International Olympic Committee took the rare step of awarding duplicate golds to Sale and Pelletier. 
The International Skating Union then decided to scrap its 
6.0 scale for a more objective points-based system. 
U.S. champions Hena Inoue and John Baldwin, the only couple to hit a throw triple axel in competition -at U.S. nationals and in Saturday's short program -couldn't duplicate the magic. She fell on their signature move, and they also struggled with some spins and their side-by-side triple toe loops. 
"I didn't give her quite the 
throw I gave her in the short program," Baldwin said. "I was more cautious." 
But they were fast and, unlikli many of the other couples, did­n't tire deep into their program. That was a problem for nearly every duo that skated earlier. 
Inoue and Baldwin wound up seventh, one spot down from their short program standing but the best full-field interna­tional finish for a U.S. pair since the 2002 worlds. 
With their fans chanting, waving Chinese flags and shak­ing colorful rattles, Shen and Zhao capped their lirst compe­tition of the snason with a spec­tacular performance. The two-time world champions missnd the entire snason as hn rncov­ernd from an August torn Achilles' tnndon. lin hurried back from the injury and shownd no sign of any physical problems. 
On both of their throws, a triple salchow and a triple loop, she soared much higher than the boards. Thnir flying triple twist was immensn and they moved as one in thnir eircular steps, making "Madame Buttnrfly" come to life. 
"Today was very difficult, especially al'tnr these two months whom I got injured," he said. "We got a good result. I am very happy about that."

Courageous Chinese pair recovers for silver 
After devastating fall, the Zhangs still medal 
Associated Press 
TURIN, Italy -Zhang Dan crashed to the ice with her legs split wide, a brutal fall that drew gasps from the crowd. She limped oil' the ice doubled over in pain, seemingly finished. 
Stunningly, she recovered to win an Olympic silver medal. 
Zhang Dan and her partner Zhang Hao of China displayed as much courage as skill Monday night in the Olympic pairs free skate. 
Skating last, Zhang Dan spun awkwardly into the ice while attempting an unprecedented throw quad salehow. The skaters stopped their routine and, with Zhang Dan bent over, they strug­gled to the sideboards to talk to their coaches. 
After gathering her composure, she asked to continue, and the event referee said yes. 
The crowd roared and she even managnd a slight smile. Then the Zhangs nailed every­thing. 
"We didn't say any words of giv!?g up: We said we could go on, he smd. 
"I think it's a very valuable experience for competition," she added. "It's so important for myself because I made a mistake on the first elenwnt. but I think I can do all the other elmnenl'i, so why not keep going?" 
Skating's rules don't spndfieally deal with injuries that oeeur just seconds into a program. Usually. the refl~ree tells the skaters they have two minutes to continue from the point of interruption. 
No one could havn expected much from Zhang and Zhang after such a gruesome mishap. No one except Zhang and Zhang. 
"Gradually aftnr we rnstartnd, it bncame morn dnar in our mind how we could continue," hn said. "We were challenging the extreme pownr of human bnings [to handle paint." 
Four minutes later, the entire crowd was standing and cheering their ell'ort, whieh gave thnm sec­ond place behind Hussia's Tatiana Totmianina and Maxim Marin in. 
Sh1m Xue and Zhao llongbo of China won their second straight Olympic bronze medal. Pang Qing and Tong .Jian were filllrth, indicating the Chinese, not the Hussians, might be the pairs power of the future. 
Slum and Zhao's first competi­tion of the season was better than anyone eould have predict­ed. Zhao reci1vered incredibly fast from an August torn Achilles' tendon, and the two-time world champions were in terrific form Monday night.

Sutton takes leave of absence after DUI offense 
Coach may return to courtside next season 
Associated Press 
TULSA, Okla. -Eddie Sutton may havp coached his last game, a 35-year career possibly ending six victories short of 800 because of a traffic a<:eident in whieh he was injured and eited for driving under the inllwmce. 
Oklahoma State announced Monday that the 69-year-old Sutton would take a medical leave and that Sean Sutton, his son and designated heir appar­ent, will finish this season as coach. The school said no deci­sion had been made on who will coach next season. 
Sutton said in a statement released by the university that he nearly took medical leave after a Feb. 4 trip to Kansas State because of chronic back pain that was "making it very difficult to coach." 
"After Friday's events, l know it is best to go on medical leave the remainder of the season to address my future health," he said. "It is very diflieult to step away from the team. But l know they are in great hands." 
Eddie Sutton spent the night in the hospital with a head injury following Friday's accident in Stillwater. 
Witnesses described Sutton's sports utility vehicle as driving dangerously and erratically, forc­ing cars to swerve out of the way before he hit another SUV from behind at about 60 mph, accord­ing to police reports released Monday. 
The driver of the other SUV received minor injuries and was released at the scene. 
One witness at the accident scene told police that Sutton seemed confused, responded angrily to questions and had a "slight fruity odor" on his breath. 
The same witness reported seeing a bottle of prescription hydrocodone, a narcotic painkiller, on the seat of Sutton's suv. 
Stillwater police cited Sutton after the accident but did not jail him on a complaint of driving under the influence because of a lack of physical evidence, the city's police chief said Monday. · Witnesses told police that shortly before the accident, Sutton was unsteady on his feet and struck his head after falling in the parking lot of Gallagher­Iba Arena before entering his vehicle. Sutton refused an ambu­lance at that scene and insisted on driving, police reports show. 
The results of blood tests ­which could take six to eight weeks to receive -will show whether the coach was driving under the influence, Stillwater Chief Norman McNickle said. Sutton was not given a field sobriety test at the time because he needed medical treatment, he said. 
Police also filed complaints against Sutton for speeding and crossing the center line. 
Under Oklahoma law, driving under the influence can include a range of substances, including prescription painkillers or alco­hol. The university said it would not comment on the DUI citation because of privacy and legal rea­sons. 
When Sutton came to his alma mater in 1990, he acknowledged he had undergone treatment for a drinking problem and said "I've dealt with it." 
In Monday's statement, Sutton said he had been under a tremendous amount of stress because of "my deteriorating physical condition and other issues." 
Sutton has weathered other tough times to become the fifth winningest men's coach in Division I history, trailing only Dean Smith (879), Adolph Rupp (876), Bob Knight (866) and Jim Phelan (830). 
Sutton is in his 16th season at Oklahoma State. 

"I hope he's back next year. I mean this sincerely," Oklahoma coach Kelvin Sampson said. "I've never coached against a better coach than Eddie Sutton." 
Sutton resigned in 1989 from a Kentucky program placfJd on four years' probation. In 2001, a plane crash killed two Oklahoma State basketball players and six team stall"ers. 
The Cowboys have advanced to postseason play 14 times in 15 years under Sutton, including 13 NCAA tournament appearances. He took the Cowboys to the Final Four in 1995 and 2004. lie also reached the Final Four with Arkansas. · 
After last season, there was much speculation about whether Sutton would retire. Instead of stepping aside, he stayed on and his son became his replacement in waiting, though no specific timetable was given for the change of power. 
The Cowboys are 13-11 and 3­7 in the Big 12 with six regular­season games left. Sutton recent­ly criticized his team's tough­ness, calling it the "softest team in 16 years that I have ever coached." 
With Oklahoma State sched­uled to play Kansas at home Monday night, Sutton spoke to players twice Sunday, assistant coa<:h James Diekny said during the Big 12 coaches conference eall Monday.

Women's hockey earns win, tie against Illini 
Water polo takes two contests in Ann Arbor; figure skating finishes second; gymnastics competes in West Lafayette 
Special to the Observer 
In the best weekend showing since sweeping Michigan two years ago, Notre Dame earned a tie and a victory over Illinois at the Joyce Center this weekend. 
On Saturday, Saint Mary's Megan Mattia redirected Liz Lefebvre's shot on goal to give the Irish a 1-0 lead at the end of the first period. Aided by a pair of Irish penalties, the Illini con­trolled the second period, scor­ing early on a breakaway to tie the game. The visitors had sev­eral other point blank opportuni~ ties, but standout play by goalie Mindy Stack prevented any fur­ther damage. A back and forth third period saw each team come up empty on good scoring opportunities, and the game ended in a 1-1 draw. 
Sunday's game also featured great defense and team play from both squads, as the game remained scoreless until the third period. freshman Lauren Beuke scored for the Irish on a great cross-ice pass from senior Kate Abowd. The Irish scored another goal right away on a great play by Julia LaPointe, assisted by freshman Margaret Knoedler. Although the Illini scored with six minutes remain­ing in the game, a determined Irish squad led by' the stellar play of captains Jacky Kehler and Holly Law shut down Illinois to claim the win. 
Women's Water Polo 
The Irish women's water polo squad stepped up in competition at this weekend's Michigan Invitational in Ann Arbor, Mich. It was a rousing start for the Irish as they opened play with an 8-3 upset of the host Wolverines. Junior Bridget O'Neill scored a hat trick, while classmate Kristen Schmitt and senior Katie Lahcos each found the back of the net twice for the Irish. 
In Saturday's second game, the Irish streaked past Miami Ohio B, 14-4. Seven players scored in the one-sided contest, with O'Neill and freshman Kelly Horner each rifling home four goals. 
On Sunday, the Irish dropped a pair of back and forth games to third-ranked Michigan State, 12­9, and No. 4 Miami Ohio, 6-3. Against the Spartans, O'Neill again splashed home three goals, Lancos and Schmitt each scored a pair, and the remaining goals were fired home by Kristy Bohling and M.C. Cimino. A pair of Lancos goals and a solo score from O'Neill accounted for the Irish scoring against the Redhawks. 
Figure Skating 
Captain Bridget Purcell and her fellow seniors, Gretchen Chriszt and Miia Rasinen, com­pleted their competitive careers this weekend at the Tri-States in Dearborn, Mich. The finale proved to be memorable as the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's women excelled in their pro­gram. 
The Irish finished a very close runner-up to Michigan State. Bowling Green was third to lead the rest of the pack. 
The precision skaters will per­form one last exhibition at the Joyce Center Feb. 25, during intermission of the men's ice hockey game. 
Gymnastics 
Continued and steady improvement marked Notre Dame and Saint Mary's perform­ance at Purdue's Golden Grips this weekend. While neither the men nor the women's squads finished among the top three schools, both had strong show­ings with partial rosters. 
Anne Krishan anchored the women's team by capturing first in the vault and fifth on the beam. Cecilia Torres, Maura Steed, Kelly Pirozzi, Jacquelyn Carney, Courtney Collins and Lucianna Ravasio all earned team points for the Irish. Ohio won the women's competition, followed by Purdue and Virginia Tech. 
Brian Dunn's fourth place fin­ish in the vault paced the men's squad, with Alan Arico and Zach Gagnon also contributing points to the team total. The injury plagued squad is recovering and the club is getting closer to real­izing its potential. The Irish will next compete Feb. 25 at Indiana. 

Bowling 

Notre Dame placed No. 22 among 29 teams in the American Heartland Bowling Conference tournament in Toledo. 
Daniel Martin paced the club with a 193 average, including three games of 202, 205 and 207. 
Captain Van Koppersmith rolled a 180 average, featuring a high game of 237. Jim Talamo posted a 169 average, while Tom Talamo averaged 158 and J.B. Bertumen completed the top five for the Irish with a 140 average. 
The team will head to Indianapolis for the Hoosier Challenge next weekend, com­pleting the season. 
Equestrian 

The Notre Dame and Saint Mary's equestrians completed regular season competition with a pair of Reserve High Point fin­ishes at Saint Mary's of the Woods College in Terre Haute, Ind. 
Kelsey Ostberg finished the season as the top open rider in the region, and advanced to nationals in Harrisburg, Penn. where she will compete in both open fences and open flat for the Cacchione Cup. Indiana earned High Point honors and will rep­resent the region at the Zones. Clair Freeman garnered High Point Rider honors in Sunday's show. 
Several club riders qualified 
. for April 2 Regionals, and will join Ostberg at Purdue, including Allie Minnis, open flat; Molly Schmiege, intermediate fences and flat; Caitlin Landuyt, inter­mediate fences; Lauren Desrosiers, intermediate fences and flat, Julia Burke, intermedi­ate fences; Hayden Piscal, novice fences and flat; Brittany Gragg, novice flat; Mary Dorgant, novice fences and flat; Meghan Murphy, novice flat; and Heather LaDue, Alisha Wilkinson, and Laura Hale, advanced walk trot canter. 
Ski 
The members of the Notre Dame Ski team were powered with aspirations of Olympic Gold this weekend, and skied like champions. Week Three saw some bright spots from fresh­men Stephanie Dalton and Joel Sharbrough, and other members helped the team to top spots in the Midwest division landing them with a spot in the regional .tournament next weekend in 
Marquette, Mich. 
The men's team had quite a 
time in this weekend's races. 
Fresh blood in freshmen Conor 
Byrne and Joel Sharbrough 
helped the men's team finish in a 
solid fourth place in their 
Saturday morning slalom race. 
Sharbrough and Byrne placed 
fourth and 20th respectively. 
Following the two freshmen 
were senior Leif Pettersen who 
ripped up the course in his first 
run, ending up in 29th, Brian 
Hedges in 38th, Chris Eakins in 
42nd, Tommy Balmat in 45th, 
Pat Leimkeuler in 46th, Alex 
Gloeckner in 49th, and Jon 
Merck rounding out the men's 
finishers with a ~2nd place fin­
ish. 
The women's team built on 
their success from past weeks 
with a third place finish in the 
Saturday slalom event. The 
brightest spots for the team 
were in senior Molly Butler and 
freshman Stephanie Dalton. 
Butler finished in eighth place, 
just a spot in front of Dalton. 
Other finishers for the women's 
team were senior Lindsay May 
in 16th, Sarah Rauenhorst in 
19th, Katie Coniglio in 36th, 
Casey Dunne in 38th, Kerry 
McGuire in 43rd, Katie Paquette 
in 45th, and Mary Kate Sweeney 
rounding out the women's team 
in 48th place. 
The men's snowboard team lit 
up the course again in 
Saturday's 'giant slalom event. 
sophomore Nick Cottingham and 
senior Dan VanDerWerff smoked 
the course, finishing in fifth and 
seventh place respectively. Mike 
Weber fmished behind these two 
with a hearty ninth place finish. 
The men finished in third place to solid Western Michigan and Grand Valley teams. 
The women's snowboard team continued to be the bright spot of the Notre Dame team. Senior Nichole Mitchell donned her two silver medals from last week and cruised to a solid fourth place finish on Saturday. Mitchell was followed by freshmen Katie Rehberger in 8th place and Casey McNeill in 10th. Rounding out the women's team were Cat Dunne and Dayna Dantzcher in 14th and 20th. 
The men's team on Sunday morning finished in fifth place. However, Joel Sharbrough con­tinued to shine with his fifth place finish. Behind Sharbrough were Byrne in 26th, Leif Pettersen in 34th, Hedges in 38th, Pat Leimkeuler in 43rd and Alex Gloeckner in 50th. Again, Steve Feutz livened up the sleepy crowd with a DNF while Hedges saved himself from a disastrous fall that would have made even Hermann Maier proud. 
The women's ski team finished in fourth place, just a few tenths of a second out of third place to Grand Valley State. 
Freshmen Stephanie Dalton finished in seventh place. Following Dalton were Butler in 12th, Rauenhorst in 17th, Lindsay May in 24th, Casey Dunne in 36th, Katie Coniglio in 39th, Katie Paquette in 42nd, Kerry McGuire in 46th and Mary Kate Sweeney in 48th. 
The men's snowboard team finished their event in mediocre form, slipping a few spots to fifth place overall. The team strug­gled greatly with DNF's from all three competitors who thought that speed was a little more important than finishing the course. 
The women's snowboard team beat all of the competition except Michigan on Sunday's giant slalom, finishing in second by less than a second, Senior Nichole Mitchell finished fourth. Following Mitchell were Katie Rehberger in seventh, Casey McNeill in 14th, Cat Dunne in 16th and Dayna Dantzcher in 22nd.

routine turn during preseason 
training, ending his season 
before it began. 
Faster equipment, man-made 

snow and powerful bodies make 
for a relentless evolution of 
Alpine racing, and skiers may simply be unable to handle it. 
"The equipment ... raises the quality of skiing, but it probably does put people at more risk," 
U.S. Ski Team surgeon Dr. Richard Steadman told The Associated Press. 
Ski design has changed radi­cally in recent years. In the 1970s, leg bones were the ones most often broken; today it's knees and ankles. 
Boots are higher and more flexible, putting pressure on the knees. Skis have sharper edges and more pronounced hourglass shapes, allowing tighter turns. Bindings that release with the shock of impact in most violent crashes hold skis on the feet and increase the risk of injury with slower falls. 
Weather, specifically less snow­fall in Europe in recent years, may be a factor, too. 
"This means there is only a small covering of snow on the course," said Salomon skis race director Philippe Auer. "The ter­rain is more sharply defined and that makes it more dangerous. The snow cannons make this better, but if you make (snow) then it's very aggressive." 

Aggressive as in hard and grip­py _ like the difl'erence between grass and artificial turf. 
Man-made snow is unforgiving for carving edges. One false move and a racer's ski swoops away, carrying only one leg with it. If a skier catches an edge in the grippy snow, it can jolt the 
knee  hard enough  to  cause  
injury without a fall.  
Aggressive  snow  also  can  

aggravate a fall. A skier skidding prone on the snow can be badly hurt ifa sharp edge hits the grip­PY surface, launching him into the air. 
That's what happened to Kildow during her Olympic downhill training run Monday _ though, amazingly, she escaped serious injury.

McAlarney 
continued from page 24 
And McAlarney's statistics, along with his attitude and com­mand of the court, caught the eye of Notre Dame coaeh Mike Brey, who has started his frnshman 1ive times already this sea'ion. 
Built more like a strong safety than a traditional point guard, McAlarney showed a high degree of confidence Oct. 13 during media day -the first opportunity for media access to players. lie spoke about taking over point guard responsibilities after cur­rent senior point guard Chris Quinn's graduation. lie advertised his own explosiveness to the bas­ket. 
He wa'> sure of himself, but this attitude evolved when the Irish jumped out to a 1-8 start in the Big East. It's not tl1at he lost the confidence, but MeAlarney-who dominated his league at Moore Catholic in New York City -was now just another freshman trying to find his way in arguably the toughest league in the country. 
"Coming out of high school into a big time Division-1 college bas­ketball league, you think you know everything about the game," McAlarney said Wndnesday after his team's 90-63 win over Hutgers. "You really learn a lot land gain experience] from your mistakes. I learned a lot trom my mistakes." 
Learning from mistakes? A strange situation lor a player one season removed from averaging 
34.8 poinl<; per game. 
MeAlarney retains his seornr's mindset. lie shoots when he is open and eroates opportunities for his teammates when he pene­trates. But thn freshman point guard has learned this season there is more to basketball than simply seoring. 
"It's dnfinitely a humbling nxpe­rienco, because you realize in high school a lot ol' people get caught up with all the media and all the poinl'i and you think you're the greatost thing in the world," MeAlarney said. "But then you eome here and everybody is bet­ter than you, <iverybody is faster than you and stronger than you and bigger." 
MeAlarney has made strides in protecting the basketball. He works on staying in control and managing the floor rather than being the primary option on the court. lie said he has focused spedlically on improving his assist to turnover ratio -arguably the most telling statistic of a produc­tive point guard. 
The freshman understands his teammates with more experience at the college level must usn it to the team's advantage, so hn knows the best way he ean eon­tribute right now is by excelling in the smaller facets of the game. 
"You just have to adjust your game," MeAlarney said, "and my game at this level is just going to be running the team, running the show, and being tough out there." 
It is clear MeAlarney has not completely abandonnd the ingrained toughness that makes him the player he is. In a Jan. 28 loss to Villanova, the Irish were in the midst of a comeback when McAlarney drilled a 3-pointer from the eorner over Wildeal<> for­ward Ja'ion Frasnr. 
Before getting baek on defense, McAiarney stared his opponent down -a look far stronger than his 200-pound frame would nvoke otherwise. After the game, MeAlarney said Fraser hadn't done anything to warrant the glance, but rather, the look was just an example of him b1~ing a "dumb New Yorker," hn said jok­ingly. 
Then there was the preseason game against Lewis University. It wa'> MeAlarney's first appearance in a college ba'iketball game, and he was weleomed with a hard screen at midcourt. MeAiarney rnturned the favor minutes later, crediting his father fi1r teaching him to always play tough against bigger opponenl'>. 
McAlarney has not lost his con­fidence -both in his on eourt actions and his ability to smile about it afterwards. But he has gotten smartor, and morn mature as a basketball player, something that only ean help the Irish a'> the freshman develops in the pro­gram. 
"I thought Kyle not turning the ball over two straight games was fabulous," Irish eoaeh Mike Brny said Feb. 8 after a win over Hutgers and two days after a loss to Louisville. "lie's been really good there, and smart with tho basketball." 
M1~Aiarney's improvemont has oarned him an intnresting roln on this ynar's team. lin is the one freshman who consistently snes signifkant minutes during games. lie has beeomn a major role play­er in this year's tnam. 
But he is also rnsponsible for developing with frnshmen Luke Zeller, Hyan Ayers and Zaeh llillosland in practico, forming a eore group for the future. 
This reality boeame visible at the end of the Hutgers game, whnn the four freshmen took the court along with sophomore for­ward Hob Kurz. At that moment, McAlarney was the only member of that game's starting fivo still on the eourt. lin was running the point, and fans got a possible glimpse of Brey's future team. 
"When the other freshmen come out and we'rn on the floor tognther, I have to handle the ball more and just be a leader, because I've gotten the most min­utes out of everybody and I have the most nxperionce," M1~Aiarney said. "(Playing with the other frnshmenl is a lot of fun, becausn we know we have three more years of this and we'rn going to be playing a lot morn together. 
"It's the futuro." 
But just a minute later, MeAlarney was pulled from the gamn and joined his older team­matns on the bench to watch tho end of the 90-63 victory-a sym­bolic moment considering his eur­rnnt situation. 
"It is a big change in tho h'llard," McAlarney said about playing with tho fmshnwn and tlwn com­ing out of the game. ''I'm playing with Chris Quinn and Colin Falls, and thoy're so easy to play with. I assumn a secondary roll as I~Lr a'> handling the ball and just being solid." 
McAlarney's rolo will chango with time. When Quinn graduaks, McAlarney knows he must step in and assert himsnlf morn on oll"ense. But for now, the Notre Damn guard is mntent with work­ing on tlw little things and leaving his mark in morn ways than just by scoring poinl'i.

No. 13 Rutgers. The Scarlet Knights are hot after defeating No. 12 Penn State in their last meet of the season. And the Irish took note of their confer­ence foes' recent feat. 
"When we saw that Rutgers beat Penn State, we thought they might be trying to send us a message," Irish junior Julia Quinn said after the Shamrock Invitational Jan. 28. "[Rutgers] will probably be our toughest competition as they have some stars, but they don't have the depth we [have)." 
Notre Dame's depth is an asset, given the swimmers' past performances in the conference meet. Six Irish swimmers have collected first place finishes at this tournament before. Katie Carroll leads the way with 10 victories, five individually and five as a member of a relay team. Rebecca Grove and Caroline Johnson each have four, while Jessica Stephens, Ellen Johnson and Katie Guida all have at least one champi­onship. 
Although Notre Dame will be competitive in most events, there are a few areas the team is heavily favored to win. Notre Dame's Jessica Stephens and Julia Quinn hold the top two Big East times this year in the 100­meter breaststroke. Stephens' mark of 1:03.57 is fast enough for an NCAA 'B' cut time, and Quinn is elose behind with a time of 1:03.88. 
The 400 individual medley (IM) is another strong event for the team as Carroll holds a time of 4:15.34-the best time in the Big East and the fourth­fastest clip in the country. 
The Irish also feel confident about the 400-meter medley relay. Notre Dame has won this race seven times at the Big East Championships, and three of the four swimmers from last sea­son's first-place team ­Caroline Johnson, Stephens and Carroll -are back to defend their title. 
With two and a half weeks between their last meet and the Big East Championships, the Irish put the time to good use as Coach Carrie Nixon allowed her swimmers to taper, or rest, for the first time all season. 
That extra rest will be needed as this week's meet will last four days, the squad's longest meet of the season.

Recruits

throughout the recruiting process. "My family [members[ are huge Notre Dame fans," 
· Weissenhoffer said. ''I'm really excited to play with the girls, [see] the campus and all the good stuff that goes along with being at Notre Dame." She will step in and take the roster spot of Katie Thorlakson, who finished second this year in balloting for the Missouri Athletic Club Hermann Trophy, given annually to the nation's best player. "Everybody's going to be real­ly excited when they watch her," Waldrum said. "Offensively and defensively, she can do a lot of things for your team. I think she's going to have some similarities to Katie Thorlakson. She's built similar to Katie, and she's got that toughness to her that Katie's got." Weissenhoffer said one of the best parts about filling the role Thorlakson had last year is the ability to team up with standout forward Kerri Hanks. ''I'm really excited to play with her," Weissenhoffer said of Hanks. "Hopefully, we'll get the chemistry going and we'll gel ... I think that to play with each other will be awesome. It will be really fun to learn from her and to feed off each other." While Weissenhoffer likely will earn headlines as a goal­scorer, Rosen of Brecksville, Ohio, garnered the most nation­al attention during the recruit­ing process after playing on the Under-17 U.S. national team. Waldrum said her ball-han­dling skills make her a proto­
typical impact midfielder. 
"She's a big land for us," he said. "The one thing I really like about her is she seems to be able to see the game so well. She can [bel like your point guard in basketball. She can find people and knows how to get people involved in the game. 
Waldrum compared her favorably to junior midfielders Jen Buczkowski and Jill Krivacek, along with freshman midfielder Brittany Bock. 
"In our system and the way we play, you've got to have a player that can [control the ball] for you," Waldrum said. "I think it was really important to kind of get her in now to learn from those players and get her the experience playing so she can take the lead when those two kids graduate." 
Weissenhoffer's teammate and fellow Naperville native Clark may join Rosen in the midfield. 
Waldrum said Clark could end up as a defender or at mid­field. 
"The thing that I really like about her, she's got a mindset that's tough, kind of an enforcer type," Waldrum said. "You can be too pretty at times. What she does is she brings that element of toughness to the team. She'll be one of those that the opposition won't want to be around her." 
The other possible defense­man in the Irish class is Ford of Midland, Texas. 
"Haley ... probably flew a lit­tle bit under the radar screen to coaches across the country ... she's not going to be one that's going to be nationally as known as Courtney Rosen or Weissenhoffer," Waldrum said. "But we've liked her for a few years. As I watched her this past year, she has just continu-ally gotten better and better." 


Waldrum said Ford is versa­tile enough to play midfield, too. 
"The good thing about Haley is she can play in the midfield if we need [her to]," he said. "I think that's always good for the young ones because you can always fmd them places to play to get experience when they're developing." 
Lysander, a goalie product of San Diego, Calif., rounds out the Irish class. She will be one of three goalies on the team, along with sophomore Lauren Karas and junior Nikki Westfall. 
Waldrum said Lysander has the talent necessary to succeed at Notre Dame but may need some fine-tuning. 
"With Kelsey, she may need a little bit of time to gain some experience at the college level," he said. "She's got enough tools to compete with Lauren [Karas], but I think right now it's Lauren's until somebody beats her out." 
Outside of Lysander, Waldrum expected each recruit to see 
significant playing time next fall. 
"The four field players that we signed are all going to come in and impact us -I think they're going to play," he said. "How much, I think is kind of up to them and a little bit, too, up to the returning players ­how well they'll fight them off. But they're all good enough as freshmen to step in and play right away."

But the painful absence on Walsh the resume of Notre Dame's 2006 senior class is an NCAA Tournament appearance -a shortcoming Walsh and Driscoll are striv­ing to remedy in their last season in South Bend.

In a New York state of mind 
By BOBBY GRIFFIN Associated Sports Editor 
Irish freshman Kyle McAlarney came to Notre Dame thinking he knew it all, and he had a high school resume to back it up. 
McAlarney was named New York Class A Player of the Year following his senior season. He scored a Staten Island-record 2,566 points in four years of var­sity basketball. 
It was the fourth highest total in the history of a state that has a reputation for sending top point guards to successful NBA careers -among them Mark Jackson (retired), Kenny Anderson (retired), Stephon Marbury (New York Knicks) and Sebastian Telfair (Portland Trailblazers). PHIL HUDELSONfrhe

When the Big East Championships begin Wednesday in East Meadow, N.Y., Notre Dame will look to pick up where it left off -in more ways than one. 
The Irish have sat idle for almost three weeks but have won their last seven events this season. They also have cap­tured the past 10 Big East titles. Notre Dame wants to make sure both streaks continue. 
The No. 20 Irish enter the meet as favorites, along with
