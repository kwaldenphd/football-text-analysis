Students voice complaints 
department employs the "major" system of registration in which declared majors in the field choose courses before non-majors, regardless of class. 
Among those courses where few openings appeared at the start of registration yesterday were Professor Ernest Sandeen's "Poetry" and Professor John Garvick's "Hemmingway"--both filled within minutes. 
Senior quota 
This type of pressure for courses did not develop at other departments using the "major" system, however. Government professor John Kromkowski, undergraduate advisor in that department, noted that many spots remained available in even the most popular classes there. He pointed out that the decision four years ago to allow sophomores to carry major courses in government "has eased the pressure for registration immensely.". 
Many seniors were dismayed when only ten seats were alloted them in Russian Literature, a popular offering in the language department. Its professor, Joseph Gatto, decided upon the quota because, "the last half of the second semester of senior year seems to me to be a total waste. 
"Usually seniors have been accepted to some graduate school by that time," Gatto stated. "I want students who will work to be in that class." 
As a result, 20 seats were kept open for un­derclassmen. In addition, Gatto reserved a minimum of five spots for women. "The girls told me the boys were pushing them out of line while waiting for the course," he explained. 
Business registrations 
The degree of satisfaction with registration procedures in Business Administration corresponded to the success had in securing desired class cards. 
One junior finance major said that he used a senior identification card to get a jump on other class seekers, and estimated that several other classmates used the same methods. A junior accounting major attending a registration meeting expressed a feeling of "helplessness" as he watched his desired courses close. 
Finance students were allowed only two courses in their major. Students registering last, as determined by a Finance Department lottery, could obtain only one major course. 
The office of the dean then offered the students one additional business course each. 
"Some business students only received six of their required 18 credits," a finance major said. "Thus, four courses would have to be electives obtained outside the business college." 
By comparison, a more serene atmosphere surrounded course sign-ups in the colleges of Science and Engineering, with very few student complaints registered there. 
Athletes and CAP 

Some students felt that problems they encountered in registering were compounded by alleged "preferential treatment" afforded to athletes and to the Committee on Academic Progress members. 
However, Dr. Michael DeCicco felt that the opposite was true--that athletes were not getting a "fair shake" in registering for classes. DeCicco, academic coun­selor to Notre Dame athletes and a professor of civil engineering, said that athletes in business ad­ministration were having great difficulties in registering, because of work'i)uts conflicting with registration meetings. 
He explained that the only concession he received from Dean Raymond was that graduating seniors would be given courses needed to fulfill graduation requirements.

Bv R.H. GROWALD 
PHOENIX <UPI> -President Ford said Thursday it is time for Congress to "fish or cut bait" on Nelson A. Rockefel­ler's nomination as vice presi­dent, and urged a new law or constitutional amendment to speed up vice presidential confirmations. 
In something akin to anger, Ford said in a prepared speech to a convention of the profes­sional journalistic society Sigma Delta Chi that it took him only 11 days in office as President to nominate Rock­efeller for the vice presidency but that three months later Congress still has not said yes or no to his choice. 
Ford suggested that Congresshave a deadline set in which to confirm a vice president. 
Ford arrived here Thursday aftternoon from Las Vegas, Nev., where he announced in a speech to the National Associa­tion of Realtors a $300 million federal program to aid home buyers. On arrival at Luke Air Force Base, Ford formally placed on active duty the first of more than 700 new F15 jetfighter planes. 
Speaking as the Senate Rules Committee continued hearings on the Rockefeller nomination in Washington, Ford said: "I believe the time has come for them to fish or cut bait in this matter." 
He said House Speaker Carl Albert and Senate Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield have assured him "they will make every effort to bring the nomination to a floor vote" before the lame duck Congess ends in December. 
Ford said this cooperation is what the Constitution demands and the people want. 
"I am as convinced as ever that Gov. Rockefeller is the right man for the job and I am anxious to have him as a working partner in the govern­ment," Ford said. 
"For the future, however, I will propose to the next Congress a re-examination of the 25th Amendment, which has been tested twice in as many years, to see if the provisions of Section 2 (dealing with selec­tion and confirming a vice president when the office is vacantl cannot be tightened up either by another constitutional amendment or by public law," he said. 
Deadline suggested 
"There should be a specific deadline both for the president to nominate and Congress to confirm a vice president," ford said. 
Under the Ford plan, if Congress does not approve one nominee by deadline time, it must automatically begin con­firmation hearings on another nominee. 
Ford said it had been suggested to him that if a deadlock between a presidential choice and a congressional failure to approve or disao­prove stretches out to the deadline time, the speaker of the House -whom the Constitu­tion puts next in line for the presidency after the vice president -would automatically take over as vice president. 
The President said he is not prepared to advocate this suggestion. But he said, "In this dangerous age as the 25th Amendment attests, we need a vice president at all times. And 
I speakknow."  as  one  who  ought  to  
Veto discussed  
Ford  also  talked  to  the  

journalists' society about his veto of the Freedom of Information Act Amendments. 
Replying to criticism in the organization's magazine The Quill, he said: "I really don't think my veto suggests 'a discredited policy of cover-up as usual' or that the Freedom of Information Act, as it stands or as amended, played or could have played any part in uncovering the Watergate cover-up." 
Suggesting to Congress the type of bill he would accept, Ford said he had these main objections to the legislation he vetoed: 
-It would have given federal . judges the right to open national security and diplomat­ic secrets if the judge found reasonable the position of the person seeking the disclosures. 
Ford said judges are not experts in deciding what should

Court-ordered checkup could endanger former president 
Ry JACK V. FOX 
LONG BEACH, Calif. <UPll 
Richard Nixon, shaky and pale, went home from the hospital Thursday and his physician expressed concern that a court-ordered checkup by outside doctors could endanger the former President's recove­ry. 
Clad in light blue pajamas and a robe, Nixon was brought out a back service door in a ~heel~hair and helped into a hmousme for the drive to San Clemente with his wife, Pat 
Nixon had been r.eported close to death following an oper~~ion for his phlebitic condttiOn Oct 29, and Thursday he seemed to totter slightly on his feet as he stood for a few moments and shook hands with nurses and others who had cared for him_ 
Shortly after Nixon's depar­ture, Dr. John Lungren, the physician who has overseen his treatment. was asked about the imminent examination by three specialists appointed by Water­gate coverup trial Judge John 
J. Sirica. Lungren has said Nixon's 
blood  pressure  shoots  up  
markedly  when  exposed  to  
almost any  stress.  
He  was  asked  whether  an  
examination  by  the  team  to  
determine  if  he  were  fit  to  
U.S. 
31 ( Dixieway) North (Across from Hoi iday Inn) Bob Edwards, ND '50 



testify for the Watergate trial would constitute stress. 
"I would have to say yes, that it does," Lungren said_ "But it is a court order. I have no control over it. He has no control over it." 
Lungren said the question of Nixon giving testimony in some fashion was "his own decision." 
. In answer to another ques­tiOn, Dr. Eldon B. Hickman who performed the surgery t~ prevent flow of blood clots from Nixon's left leg to his heart and lungs. said he felt examination by the court-appointed doctors was "unnecessary." 
The Observer is published dally during the college semester except vacations by the stuaents of the 
University of Notre Dame and St. Mary's College. Subscriptions may be purchased for $9 per semester ($16 per year) from The Observer Box Q, Notre Dame Indiana 46556. Second clas~ POStilge paid, Notre Dame, Ind. 46556. 
Hickman said he would not want to risk such a step unless "I had the willingness and agreement of the patient" 
Lungren said "just honestly" he doesn't know how long Nixon should remain on a schedule of very restricted activity. 
He said the 61-year-old former chief executive would be under "watchful observa­tion" at San Clemente. 
A hospital bed has been placed in the bedroom at his home so his leg can be elevated. He will wear a surgical stocking on his left leg and has been advised to take only brief walks. 
Hickman was asked whethrr 
UJ~t atnlnnial Jfancukt ~oust 
he thought it would be possible to conduct the new examination at San Clemente or whether it might be necessary to have Nixon re-enter a hospital. 
llickman said that was up the to fhe three doctors but that he personally would not want to submit Nixon to the strain of going into a hospital again. 
Judge Sirica has instructed the tt·am to report back to the court on their findings by Nov. 
29. A spokesman for Dr. C'harles Hufnagle, chairman of the team. said Thursday, "the doctors have been iri touch with l'ach . other and are making tentative plans" as to time and place of lbe examination.

ND: Law school hosts open-house 
by Mary Egan Staff Reporter 

The Notre Dame Law School and the Pre-Law Society will hold an open-house in the law school lounge, this Sunday at 1 p.m. 
Student Bar Association President Chauncey Veatch, Co­ordinating Chairman John DePietro and Pre-Law Society President Thomas Demko will host Deans Thomas Shaffer and David Link of the ND Law School. They will all give a formal presentation and a question and answer session will follow. 
Second-year law students will give guided tours of the law building. Refreshments will be served. 
"The purpose of the open house is to help students at both SMC and ND who are interested in a law school. not necessarilv Notre Dame's, find out about one and the life of a law student," said Veatch. 
"Professional students are faced with certain time limitations, but we in the law school government believe very strongly that we should participate as fully as possible in the life of the Univer­sity," explained Veatch. 
student counsel 
'Tile Law Society is working with Brian McGinty, jui':hcuiJ coor­dinator for student government, on the possibility of having legal advocates assist in representing undergrads who face disciplinary proceedings. 
"We would try to assert an in­fluence through our involvement," said Veatch. This matter will be considered soon by SLC," he added. 
If passed, this resolution would mean that students facing disciplinary action could benefit (rom the counsel of law students, if they so desire. Law students would also benefit from the practice since the law school is prepared to give law students credit for this. 
projects 

The Law School wants to involve 
Notre Dame in nation events. The 
law school arranged for 
Georgetown law student David 
Erdman, president of the National 
Law Student Division of the 
American Bar Association to 
speak here next week. 
The school's goal is to elect 
several ND law students in sue­ceeding years to the Bar Association. The first step towards this goal was taken when Chauncey Veatch was elected chairperson of the Bar President's Association of the ABA at the National Convention. This is important because the law school had been minimally involved in the past and Notre Dame is an im­portant school in the Midwest. This circuit has always been disorganized, said Veatch. 
"The law school has cooperated with our Law School Alumni in setting up a national job placement service," said Veatch. An alumnus is in charge of each specific area of the country, he explained. 
"We also have groups working to raise money for our loan service," added Veatch. "A most helpful group has been the Law Wives Association. It sponsors a booth before football games selling quilts, pillows and dolls. 
During the October break, the law school and the Law Wives Association co-sponsored a dinner with Fr. Hesburgh. 
This year the law school is representing both the law students and the MBA students on the Academic Council. 

Hunger panel advocates more efficient use of resources to curb food crisis 

by Pat Flynn Staff Reporter 

A further challenge to students to better use world resources was issued by Notre Dame graduate Al Sondej last night before a crowd of 35 in the Memorial Library Lounge. 
"If Americans would stop eating meat, enough grain would be available to take care of the world's hunger problems for the next year," Sondej said. "It takes ten pounds of grain to produce one pound of beef," he explained. 
Sondej, a campus familiar with his dining hall food-relief collec­tions, was one of four panelists discussing the ethics of world food, population, and energy problems. The panel, which was sponsored by the Non-Violence Program, also included Fr. Edward Mallory of the Theology Department, Professor Edward Manier of the Philosophy Department and Professor Basil O'Leary of the Non-Violence Program. 
Sondej asserted that because we live in a world of finite resources, men are faced with certain limitations in dealing with the food problem. 
"We can do certain things with our money, some of which will mean people will live, others· that they will die," stated Sondej. "World ecology is a function of both population and individual impact on the environment," he said. 
O'Leary advocated an ethical principle which he termed, "purely secular yet radical by contemporary standards." 
"We have to weigh the margin of 
utility, stated O'Leary. "In­
dividuals in the developed coun­
tries must look after and insure 
their own material subsistence. 
But above that level, they are 
committed to assisting with every 
means at their disposal the plight 
of the starving nations," he ex­
plained. 
O'Leary employed two analogies 
in his remarks to make his position 
clear. If we were to walk by 
someone drowning in a pond we 
would be obligated to assist on a 
purely secular basis. 
On the other hand, world famine 
is like a number of life boats on the 
sea after a shipwreck, no one's 
interest would be served if the boat 
with the chance of surviving let a group from another boat with no chance of surviving abandon their ship and board their own. In short, in a situation of scarcity we need to weigh discriminating factors as well as moral obligations, O'Leary explained. 
Manier, claiming not to be an ethicist, asserted that his concern in the world food problem was with the moral and political question involved in building a good society. Manier described his notion of the good society as a place where all members were granted their rights to health, care, education and welfare, and where all members outside of the society were also granted these rights. 
Manier stressed that he believed these things were individual human rights, not owed in charity but as a necessary item in creating a good world. 
Malloy stated he believed that the world hunger problem was a function both of the absence '>f population control and unequal distribution of world resources. 
Malloy noted, however, that he has certain ethical doubts about coercive methods of enforcing population control. Among these methods he cited forced sterilization and punitive abortion. 
Sondej reported a number of the difficulties in maintaining the present balance of the world's eco­system. 
Energy consumption is limited by the level of heat that can be disipated into the atmosphere, stated Sondej. "If we put more heat than one percent of the solar heat disipation into the atmosphere, mass climatic changes will result." 
Sondej also pointed out that water-use is limited to the run-off rate of 100 million cubic kilograms per year. "To produce a single automobile requires 100,000 gallons alone," he noted. 
Sondej explained that deforestation is a real problem in maintaining an ecological balance.

Ombudsman successors named 
by Ken Bradford Staff Reporter 
Ombudsman Director . Bill McLean yesterday announced the appointment of his successors as Ombudsman director and chair­man of the Ombudsman Steering Committee. 
At a luncheon in the Morris Inn, MeLean introduced Jim Zorn and Tom Gibbons as the service director and committee chairman, resplctively. The appointments, wnich wtre made by Student Body l'resid!nt Pat McLaughlin, will hl'comt l'ffective February 3, 1975. 
McLean said the appointment of Ow nPv: Ombudsman executives will allow thi!m several weeks' Pxperi.(nce t-efore the SBP elec­tions m·xt st;-~ring. ··we hope the nPxl SBP ·.viii reappoint them at that time," !\~cLean noted. 
Zorn observed he would spend the next f.!W months "picking l\lcLt>an's brain" to acquaint himself with the procedures of his office. "Our service will continue along the same lines as we did under Bill,'' Zorn, a Flanner fresh­man, stated. 
"Our first concern will be to get all the new people set so we'll be ready to go in February," Zorn added. He said the Ombudsman would work through the channels of communication which already exist and also try to open up "new lines where communication is still lacking." 
Gibbons explained his position as chairing a group of four Om­budsman Executive Board members. The steering committee will deal with policy matters and officer selections. 
''My major job will be to serve as advisor to Jim Zorn," said Gib­bons. a junior management major and Stanford Hall resident. 
McLean also announced the membership of the Ombudsman Advisory Board. On the board will be Dr. Robert Ackerman, student affairs professional development director; William Berry, electrical engineering professor; Gregory Curme, economics professor; and Juan Garcia, history graduate student. 
Also. Dr. Peter Grande, assistant Dean of the freshman year; Mildred Kristowski, law school director of placement; Vincent Raymond, business ad­ministration associate dean; James Roemer, university counsel; and Fr. James Riehle, Pangborn rector. 

Also, Fr. James Shilts, physics professor; Dr. Lillian Stanton; 'ichar<U~ullivan, registrar; Joanne Szaffron, Walsh rectress; and Robert Waddick, assistant dean of 
Arts  and  Letters.  Berry  was  
selected to serve  as  chairman of  
the group.  

"These are people who cannot only give us sound advice but who can get things done," McLean stated. 
The advisory board is divided into four units: planning, award, academic and assistance. The Planning Unit is designed to lOordinate the work of the other units. 
The OAB Award Unit is designed to recognize outgoing students for outstanding work in non-academic pursuits, McLean said. "Students who contribute and sacrifice for the community often do not get the best grades," McLean observed. He said the award committee would present such student s with letters of commendation which could h~ the students in seeking positions after graduation. 
The OAB Academic Unit, ac­cording to McLean, would serve two purposes. The first function is to help keep students working for the Ombudsman service from ignoring their studies. The second is to help with Ombudsman education programs, such as workshops and briefings. 
"This will not be a grade grievance group," McLean noted. He said the unit will help "facilitate new course ideas" for the University as a whole. 
The Assistance Unit is a "catch­all" department which will help with Ombudsman projects not covered by the other units. One function of the group will be to help develop better relations with South Bend, McLean said. 
Berry stated the advisory board's primary purpose "is to lend stability and support for the Ombudsman organization." He said the members of the board have been helping the Ombudsman as individuals for a year and a half.

"This board brings some of the 
people together with whom the 
Ombudsman has worked to solve 
problems," Berry noted. "I'm 
looking forward to working with 
the group and seeing just what we 
can do together." 
McLean observed that the OAB 
is "also intended to be a safeguard 
against internal abuse or misuse of 
the Ombudsman Service and its 
resources." In this way, the board 
provides a secondary option (in 
addition to the Student Govern­
ment) for students who wish to 
complain about the Ombudsman 
service. 
McLean added that the OAB is a 
formalized group consisting of a 
few of the people who have helped 
his service through the year. He 
said that there are many other 
people he would like to involve in 
the OAB someday. 
The director said the mem­bership of the OAB contains people of diverse backgrounds and talents. He stated his hope that they will be able to help the Om­budsman service "cut through the red tape" and serve as mediators with the administration. 
Center lies in the fact that the gym facilities presently available cannot adequately handle the expanding intramural sports program. 
"Stepan Center will soon be used to handle the overflow at the Rock and ACC," explained Fr. Dave Schlaver, Director of Student Activities. Schlaver also related that court lines would be painted on Stepan's concrete floor. 
While new equipment such as basketball backboards will be needed, the source for funds to purchase these supplies is presently unknown, according to Tom Kelly, assistant director of non-varsity sports. Schlaver was likewise uncertain at this time from where the money qould come.

Cancer claims Novotny :     
by Don Reimer 
Staff Reporter 
Dr. Jerome Novotny, professor of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering, died yesterday en­ding a five-month fight against cancer. 
A memorial Mass will be celebrated at 5:15 p.m. today at Sacred Heart Church. The Mass will be concelebrated by Fr. Theodore Hesburgh, Fr. James Burchaell and Fr. Ferdinand Brown. 
The cancer which caused the 40 year-old professor's death w~s first discovered in July of this vear. Novotny was hospitalized during the summer and underwent two operations in recent months. 
Novotny appeared to be winning his battle with the disease in the months just preceeding his death. lie had returned to the university at the beginning of this semester to l'Ontinue his research and teaching, and he was gaining weight in the past few weeks. He suffered a relapse, however, early this week, and passed away quietly near 8 a.m. Thursday.

Windows shatter during campus snowball fight 
by Lonnie Luna Staff Reporter 
A midnight campus-wide snowball fight Wednesday night resulted in the breaking of win­dows of several halls. 
The south quad snowball fight ended with the vestibule windows of Dillon broken and windows of Alumni, Badin and Walsh broken also. 
On the north quad, another battle raged on with members of Keenan­Stanford, Grace, Flanner, Zahm and Cavanaugh flinging snowballs at each other. Firecrackers and pop bottle rockets added to the con~sion as they were fired into the Fighting masses. 
There were approximatiely 300 men and a handful of women in­volved in the cold war. Several windows were broken in Keenan and a door window of Grace was cracked. 
Other damages included the glasses of the Keenan Hall rector being broken as he approached a high school youth throwing snowballs at the Keenan windows. 

1963, Novotny taught at both his alma mater and the University of Delaware. His major included the areas of heat transfer, ther­modynamics and fluid mechanics. 
Novotny came to Notre Dame in 1965 as an assistant professor and was promoted in 1969 to full professor. He was very active in the College of Engineering, ser­ving . on numerous committees since 1969. The work of Novotny in the area of heat ransfer gained national recognition for the University's heat-transfer group. 
On the national level, Novotny was well-known and highly respected. He served on several national committees and chaired seven national and international meetings during his career. The professor delivered lectures at various colleges and universitiees since 1967, including Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He also authored or co-authored 36 scientific articles. 
Novotny's collegues in the College of Engineering generally described him as "hard-working, well-respected and extremely conscientious." 
Dr. K. T. Yang, department 

A third floor window had been broken and Fr. Conyers went outside to investigate the situation. 
As he went outside, he caught a South Bend high school youth throwing snowballs at the win­dows. 
"I asked him what he was doing and he said that he was 'having fun.' I then asked him for his ID card and he said that he left it in his room, so I asked him to wait inside for Security," Conyers said. "He started to get away and, as he did, I reached for him and that's when my glasses got knocked off and lost." 
Two tremendously huge snowballs were placed in front of the double-door passages of the Towers. 
There were reported injuries, perhaps not connected with the wars on the quads. A girl was rushed to the hospital that night at 
1:30 a.m. with a possible broken hip. A male student was taken to the hospital at 3:30 a.m. with a mild concussion and then brought to the Infirmary at 5:30 that morning. 
chairman of mechancial and aerospace engineering, described Novotny as, "one of the most productive teachers and resear­chers in the college. He was the kind of guy who expressed his feelings, but was willing to listen to others and agree if they proved him wrong," continued Yang. 
Yang also mentioned that a menorial fund is being set up in Novotny's name to help deserving stuents to prepare for college teaching. 
Associate Dean of Engineering Edward Jerger, who was Novot­ny's first departmental chairman, said, "he had a great deal of promise and was presently well on his way to becoming a top man in his field." Novotny was charac­terized by Jerger as "very dedicated to doing a thorough job in both teaching and research." 
"He was very hard-working, conscientious, and loyal to the university." 
A fellow professor and personal friend, Associate Professor John Lloyd, commented, "he was hard­driving. He knew what he was doing, where he was going, and he worked very hard to get there. He was a very strong person." 
Lloyd pointed out that Novotny continued working even while he was in the process of fighting the disease and sighted this as typical of Novotny's "hard-driving" nature. 
"Everyone held him with a great deal of respect both for his honesty an d his tremendous drive," noted Lloyd.

"Flight" is an eight-piece brass band, which has been together professionally for five years. After their appearance at Notre Dame, they will begin a three-month tour of Arizona and California. 
The group plays for both a listening and dancing audience, performing material from Chicago, Blood, Sweat and Tears, Santana, Grand Funk and the Doobie Bros. 
The dance will be held in the ballroom and adjoining the lounge of the Four Flags Inn. The Four Flags is located in downtown Niles, off U.S_ 31 <maps are available at the Student Union Ticket Office). 
Tables will be set up in the lounge, leaving most of the ballroom as a dance floor. Snacks will be provided and refreshments can be purchased at the cash bar. 
It is not a true "formal" dance, rather an opportunity to get dressed up and enjoy an evening of dancing, according toAugi Grace, .JUnior class presidaent. 
Tickets, at $5 per couple, are linited to 200 juniors and their guests. They can be purchased now at the Student Union Ticket Office, in La Fortune, from any junior class officer, or at Friday's Happy Hour at Kubiak's. 
Grace stated that only about half the tickets have been sold and urged juniors to buy theirs now. "If ticket sales continue slowly, we may open it up to the other classes around Wednesday," he said.

DeCicco further emphasized that student-athletes must schedule all classes before 3 
p.m. which "straps the athlete in his freedom of choice of classes." He also flatly denied the existence of academic programs exclusively for student athletes, and ex­claimed that "the image and mystique about student-athletes here is wrong." 
Still others blamed the students within the Committee for Academic Progress <CAP) for registration problems. 
Students within the CAP are allowed to preregister for some courses the night before preregistration officially begins. The CAP is given a limited number of cards by the teachers of certain courses that are usually filled quickly. These cards are di­stributed among the CAP members on a class basis. /

Tea and Rice 
Twenty million people will starve to death. Before the spring brings us Mardi Gras, An Tostal, and new academic worries, twenty million human beings shall be dead of famine. Twenty million. 
Imagine, twenty million people star­ving to death. Not the relatively quick and easy death guns or heart attacks or sudden violent acts bring. But the slow, hard death starvation brings. Then too, in famine, there is the utter despair of impotence: watching the whole of one's world die too. The anguish of seeing one's village and ultimately one's own family die. Consider the apocolyptic horror of a woman who must not only see her own life fail, but also her child's because she cannot feed it. 
Before the season is over some twenty million people will die from such suf­fering in areas across the globe. Twenty million -enough to fill the Notre Dame dining halls FOUR THOUSAND times. 
As the U.N., the World Food Con­
ference and our own government debate 
the "issue " and spin off a myriad of 
complex obstacles to any real solution, 
people die and we eat. Governmental 
inaction and material prosperity have 
numbed us so badly that most of us 
eannot fathom the suffering that daily 
,,ccurs in Africa, Asia, and even Latin 
America. Because of the bureaucracy 
of a government which subsidizes far­
mers to plow under tremendous acres of 
wheat, and which ineptly stumbles 
over its own bulk, we are virtually 
powerless to save even one of the twenty million. All that is left to us as the federal government pursues the phantom of a generation of peace is pr~yer and sensitivity to the agony and pain of those dying in famine stricken parts of the earth. 
On November 26, this community will sit down to a-supper of tea and rice. More food than many persons receive in a week. Sharing t this meal will do little to ease the hunger of millions. 
Money saved by foregoing a regular dinner will be sent to the starving. That is painfully little. Those who eat this simplest of meals will reaffirm the oldest sign of solidarity. That is painfully little. They will on the night share the affliction which daily sends thousands not to bed, but to death, hungry. One night of hunger is also painfully little. 
But it is something. 
Little as it may be, it is a start. Hopefully, it will bring a deeper com­passion and a more urgent concern for those who must die so hard a death. Perhaps, just perhaps, such compassion and concern will spread and ultimately move those holding power to a massive relief of the pain which slaughters so many. 
Release your dining hall number and forego dinner for tea and rice on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving when this nation blesses God for what millions lack. On one evening suffer minutely the affliction of hunger that slowly, tortuously takes so many lives.

Let us not fool ourselves. There is no such thing as an energy crisis, it was always easy to get gas. There is no such thing as the food crisis, it is still easy to get food. This is another trick by agroup of people who are trying to raise prices and take money from the American people. There have been times when I have been temp­ted to believe these things. They are possibilities. The power of mass advertising is a great appeal to the senses. We can be ap­palled just as easily by a picture of a starving child as we can by a decapitated horse in a film like the Godfather. It could be all a trick. 
It is a shame to say that these two things may have the exact same impact on our v ~rsion of reality. After all we have never seen anyone killed like that and we have never seen anyone starve to death. Those things are out there in pictures. Mass media is powerful but it is convenient. When we don't want to see the picture anymore, we flip off the tube, turn our heads or leave the theater. It is a nice, neat way of handling things. It is efficient. 
There is a difference, though. The film stops. The hunger doesn't. It gnaws into the very marrow of your stomach, robbing you of any thought save a piece of bread or a bowl of rice. After that it swells the stomach till it almost bursts and it won't go away--God, it won't go away! It is like a bad nightmare haunting the essence of your being, searching out your existence and dragging it down to its knees. It just never goes away--it won't, it can't, it doesn't. 
This is no television program or movie, it is life in the un­der~eveloped countries of the world. It is rotten teeth, and dying babies, and worst of all, an eternity of hunger. This is what is happening to planet earth and we can't switch it off, this is like the bad movie that doesn't go off. It is the endless succession of late night movies that won't stop--and the morning never comes. 
So what can we do about it? Well there are two things. You can refuse to admit that it exists. You can ignore it and not make it a part of your reality. If that its the case you might as well die for you were dead long ago. Atleast the starving people have despair. You don't have anything but an empty shell. 
There is another solution. Don't shut it out, don't ignore it. Deal with it, take it in, express your solidarity. And if you are there enough, mortify yourself. James Carrol says: "Mortification happens when a person takes responsibility for himself, for his actions, for his living, for his dying ... Mortification is a symbolic action that says something about mankind in concrete language ... Mortification is a form of consciousness in which my world includes yours ... Mortification is the way to question the fundamental assumptions of each age and each institution from this standpoint: do they enable or prevent human life to the full?" This is not something in a theology class, this is you and I dealing with the problem of world hunger. 
Who am I to say these things? I am a human being and I cannot deny that one half of my brothers and sisters starve while the other half close their eyes and turn on their television sets while eating a big batch of popcorn and drinking a beer. This is my solidarity and if I deny it, than I am less than human. 
There is a real dnger that those who participate in this will be claiming their share of the solution to the hunger crisis. Those who participate could be smug and self-righteous about it. Those who don't participate can say with great justification--what good will it do? For the good, we are sending the money saved to the hungry people. This is very pragmatic and it is accomplishing something. As for the smugness, it is a real danger. To delude ourselves by thinking that we are really accomplishing something big is wrong. 
Humility is required for this to be a success on all fronts. The c~oice to participate or not is yours entirely. You may not see any viable reason for fasting and eating a rice meal. It could be if you don't see any point ir, it that you should not do it. However the alternatives in this land of plenty are few. If you don't do this,' you have done worse than debunked the futility of this fast. You have done nothing.

After the recent election there was talk of massive political dislocation, of a stunning blow to Republicans and a Democratic landlside. of the signs of approaching third­partyism. Cartoonists showed us a beaming donkey and a battered elephant. And, relatively, it was a big electoral turnaround. 
The Democrats won well over twice the congressional seats normally taken back in 
presidential governors'  off chairs  years, <in plus cluding  some the  big two  
biggest>.  .  

But to say all this is merely to remind ourselves of the basic conservatism of .our electoral system. We speak of a major dislocation when we mean that roughly 10 percent of the congressional seats changed partisan custody--44 or so out of 435. Three out of 100 Senate seats changed hands-3 percent. The gubernatorial changeover was about 8 percent. Or, to take one of the major ''indicators" in the last election, we were told that the voters punished members of the House Judiciary Committee--a punish­ment that affected five members, or just over one percent of the House membership. 
I repeat this is considered an outside development, because the normal electoral displacement is only half of that, or less. Our politics is incremental with regard to elections. 
Many things make it so. Inertia, a presumption in favor of the incumbent­which is in itself a vote for the system as satisfactory or else so refractory that no step as slight as casting a vote can do much about it. 
The last judgment is by and large a valid one. No drastic alternatives are offered at election time. When drastic steps·are taken­-the initiating of a war, the tooling up of the New Deal, the imposing pf price controls-­they occur in the time between elections. Franklin Roosevelt ran for office in 1932 promising a balanced budget and criticizing the wild expenditures of Herbert Hoover. In 1917. 1941, and 1965 it was proved that the way to take this nation into war is, first of all. the get elected by promising there will be no war.

To Fr. Toohey 
Dear Fr. Toohey, 

I was very pleased to read your column November 6, to read what a nice trivial vacation you had. It must be nice not to have a care or financial worry at this time. I'm also happy you have the time to enjoy this vacation and get the chance to do many things we would all like to participate in. 
But  Father, it is just too  bad the  
students  were  not  able  to  enjoy  such  a  
break.  

It appears as if the majority of students at this university were not able to just sit back and relax during the break, and wasn't that the reason behind the break, relaxation? Ask around, Father, and see how many students were forced to take home their books to study. The students took this action not because they are overly studious, but rather due to the great amount of work given right before and iue immediately 
~;~ a r r y wiIIs 
There should be nothing surprising in all of this. Each party begins with its natural constituency more or less assured. and then tries--without losing that first constituency­to woo the uncommitted in the middle. This means they both end up saying much the same thing, aiming at the same potential voters. Both sides, of course, are tugged back slightly from full consensus by the traditions of their first constituency, but both sides try to blur these differences as the electoral deadline nears. 
Thus the vote means pracically nothing in policy terms. It reflects mood, and can give a retrospective approval (to FDR's New Deal in 1936) or disapproval (to Nixon's criminalities). But in general it affirms a rather blind faith in the mass of our rulers. We expect most of them to be returned, and talk apocalyptically when the party tur­nover edges up past five percentage points. 
Insofar as people directly affect the choice of policies, they do it more, now by way of the opinion polls than by way of election. Few candidates risked their campaigns by taking a clear-cut position on wage-price controls this autumn. But when the administration weights this necessary step, and legislators have to take a stand on it, they will respond to the opinion polls that are swinging drasticaly in favor of control. A candidate has to satisfy just the con­figuration of voter preferences that will suit his first constituency and the winnable uncommitteds in his district. Oddly enough, he is freer .to respond to public opinion across a vast spectrum when he is not facing election. 
This exactly reverses most of our political scientists' doctrines on the meaning of elections. But our politics has never been what it pretended to be And yet, by and large, our politics is not a bad thing. It works in ways it was not supposed to, in way we rarely recongize or describe well. We have a conservatism no one has identified as such--one that has nothing to do with right wing views at all; or with left wing views for that matter. 
Halls. True, the South Dining Hall pay cafe was open, but the fact stands that the quality of the food has deteriorated to the point that almost no dinner is worth the $2.50 price. Students were not even given a discount. Because of this factor, I was one of the students forced to leave. 
To help pay for this glorious "vacation", which according to the opinion polls con­ducted, the students never wanted nor needed before, I had to work from 9-6 Tuesday through Saturday. After finishing work on Saturday I then had to begin the trip back to school from Boston. I can't begin to guess where the people from the west coast went. Also, I made the attempt to work upon my thesis for history, but this type of research is a little difficult in a house with four other siblings. Due to work I did not have the time to attempt to drive to Boston to use one of their universities' libraris. When I arrived on campus Sunday night, I realized that I now needed a break to recover from the "vacation."

CANTON, Ohio--On election night millions and millions of Americans watched as the NBC and ABC television networks an­nounced that, according to their computers, Gov. John Gilligan had defeated former Gov. James Rhodes in Ohio. 
Gov. Rhodes, like all of us, was so im­pressed by the fact that two out of three networks had given the election to Gov. Gilligan that he conceded on the spot and wentto bed certain he was a loser. When he woke up the next morning he discovered that, although the network computers had declared Gilligan the winner, the real votes showed that Rhodes was ahead by 12,000 votes. 
What went wrong? 
I happened to be in Canton, Ohio, so I went over to a sample precinct 50 miles away, one that both ABC and NBC had used to decide Gilligan had won. I will call the place Bellwether because the networks like to keep their sample precincts secret. 
just to break even. 
So, in closing, I must repeat your column did bring a touch of joy to my heart, to realize at least one member of our "com­munity" did enjoy the break with no scholastic or financial worries. The only problem is, Father, is that according to Fr. Burtchaell, the break was for the well being of the students and regrettably, Fr. Toohey, you are not a student nor a teacher.

Most of the people in town had long faces. 
The man in the coffee shop told me, "We're 
not proud of it. NBC and ABC were 
depending on us and we let them down." 
Another man at the counter said, "We've 
been a sample precinct for four elections. 
We've got 10 percent Italians, 10 percent 
Jews, 10 percent Irish, 10 percent blacks, 40 
percent women and 20 percent 
miscellaneous. We were a perfect mix." 
"But what happened?" I said. 
"Farfellied to the pollsters," a man at the 
end of the counter said. 
"Who's Farfel?" 
"He runs a gas station at the end of Main 
Street. After he came out of the voting 
booth, he told NBC and ABC he had voted for 
Gilligan, when in fact he had voted for 
Rhodes. They fed Farfel's vote into their 
computers and, bang, they declared 
Gilligan the winner." 
"But why would Farfel do that?" I said. 
"Why don't you ask him? No one else is 
talking to him, so he has plenty of time on 
his hands." 
I went down to Farfel's gas station. I 
found him sitting next to his gas pump 
playing a harmonica. 
"Mr. Farfel," I said, "I hear you screwed up the sample precinct in Bellwether and .got NBC and ABC to declare Gilligan the next governor of Ohio." 
Farfel chuckled, "Yup, danged if I did-n't." "Why did you do it?" 
"Wal, I tell you, son. I'm one of these old­timers that don't like no television hotshots telling me who won an election before all the votes have been counted. I mean, you turn on the set and some sharp feller in a $300 suit says, 'With 2 percent of the vote in, we declare John J. Pumpkin the next senator of Michigan.' Takes all the fun out of election night. I don't want no computer declaring who my governor is going to be. So this year I decided to fix 'em good. I'm half-Italian and half-English, so them network boys had it figured out that if I voted for Gilligan 350,000 Italians and 350,000 Church of England had voted for him, too." 
"Mr. Farfel,the networks spend millions of dollars on computers and hire the best experts in the business. How can they run an honest election if you lie to them in a sample precinct?" 
"No skin off my nose. They should be reporting election results and not projecting winners on the basis of what some Ph.D. feeds into a machine. I want to tell you, son, I never had so much fun as when NBC declared Gilligan the winner. I liked to have died laughing because I was the only one in the wholestatewho knew Rhodes was going to be our next governor." 
"You know, Mr. Farfel, everyone in town 
s mad at you. NBC has decided that you 
:an no longer be a sample precinct. It's 
JUite a blow to the pride of the community. 
)on't you have the slightest regret for what you did?"

on tea and rice as elements of a eucharist 

And so. on November 26, we will eat our rice and drink our tea as the celebrants of a liturgy mourning hunger, and we shall feel comforted by the righteousness of our limited commitment, as do clerics promoting temperance who abstain from daret during Lent. ("See how we suffer for the Church." said the archbishop, when he hurntd his hand on the roast.) We will eat our rice and drink our tea, and only a tailoring in bamboo hats and coolies' eulottes is needed to make us feel authen­tically identified with the diet of Vietnamese ptasants. 
And indeed, I will eat my rice and drink my tea on that day, though in honesty, a doubt picks like a vulture at the shell of my mind. It is a doubt that makes me hesitant, reluctant, suspicious, resisting. It is a doubt that makes me wonder about our November fasting: have not some of us lviing on

War goes on, racial tensions continue, the planet chokes in its own garbage, and I do not know what good all the Masses, protests, rallies, and demonstrations accomplished. No one who could have changed these things seemed to be listening, except possibly God, and He didn't say much. Presidents and industrial chieftains make their decisions in councils that are remote from campus quads; racial hatreds live in places as inaccessible as the human heart, where demonstrations are not allowed to enter. Yet, we had to make those protests, or our consciences wouldhavecrackedthe seams of our mind. The great causes of our times need our agitation, season in and season out and not just when we feel like it; they are like infant children whose wants do not cease because a mother is tired or sick, or a father is out of work. The great causes of our times are the babies of all of us who require survival. Now our concern is about hunger. and I worry, because I do not want hunger to be a hobby that school boys play games with at supper. 
I don't know what your experience with hunger has been; but if you are Irish, you may have heard the old people talk about the days of the Famine, when starving women and children died in the countryside grinding their teeth on emerald green foam from the grass they had eaten because there was no food left them by their absentee landlords. In the cities of America, you can sometimes see old men and women picking scraps out of the garbage, because their pitiful little checks, if they have them, can't buy enough groceries to keep them alive.

whom I am associated. I cannot refuse their

the hungry and starving people. 
Somewhere, some one got the idea for a fast for hunger. It's a quixotic gesture, I think to myself. If the students want to do something, urge them to stay at Notre Dame for Thanksgiving, turning over the money saved in plane fares, gas, and travel expenses to an agency like UNICEF. Then their parents and friends would really notice the sacrifice they are making, and the victims of hunger for whom they are making it. 
It would be nice if it happened, but I am not suggesting it. But I think that if we are really concerned about those who starve, sterner diets will be required of us than meals of rice and tea. The resolution to care must be an affair that love arranges with the heart. One's heart is best opened to caring when one is alone, away from the demonstrations, before the public liturgy begins. Only then can the sacrament of sharing be taken in symbols of tea and rice. 
Remember, on November 26, you are taking just a first step in faith on a journey that can lead you to the ends of the earth.

"Close to the Edge" was a flawless reproduction of the studio version. Aided by a multitude of sound equipment, the in­tricate movements of the song reached a perfection. The highlight of "Close to the Edge" was the new visual feeeeffects which were incorporated into the performance. Lighting the stage wt·re elaborate com­binations of blues, reds, yellows, and pale greens. The lights added to the effect of fiberglassssss structures on the stage which were reminiscent of the graphics on their albums covers. The effect of the lights and fog added depth to the stage and created an eerie atmosphere. 
Two works from the new · Helayer have seen a family of four sick people ex­pected to live on seven dollars worth of food stamps a week, and they had no other source of income. That is why I don't un­derstand welfare systems that give food stamps to students, or students who accept them, if there are other reasonable alter­natives open, like asking wealthy old dad to write a check. Students are, to me, some of the most important people in the world, and I would begrudge them nothing that is mine, or anything else that is helpful or necessary. But when one or two of them brag of how they are ripping off the city, getting food stamps, I think of the helpless, hopeless folk for whom this welfare was intended, and I protest the shabbiness of systems. It seems especially ironic now in this university community in the face of a fast day to protest the world's hunger. 


Several years ago, there was a young man on this campus who sacrificed practically every other interest--studies, social life, peace of mind, friendships--to collect money for the starving nations. He suffered in­tensely because the resources he could gather. though he raised thousands of dollars, were so inadequate to serve the 
staggering needs of the tens of thousands who were dying. Eventually, it nearly broke his heart to think of the lack of caring he thought he found at Notre Dame ove those pathetic little bodies wasted to death by malnutrition. Because he couldn't stand the suffering--his own and those caused by the disasters of world hunger--he eventually took his own life. One person who shared Tom's commitment as a Good Samaritan, though fortunately not his despair, is Big AI, Tom's best friend, who stands at the doors of the dining hall each day, collecting money 
album followed. The new songs are the result of the progression through a spiritual change which occured after "Yessongs." "To Be Over" and "Gates of Delerium" were as impressive as "Close to the Edge" but has a more subtle effect. In­strumentally, these songs were highlighted by the impact of Steve Howe's pedal steel work and Patrick Moraz's exhaustive keyboard efforts. Moraz's work was more vibrant and better integrated than the recently departed and widely acclaimed Hick Wakeman. Wakeman's smoothness was more than made up for by Moraz's underestimated talent. 
Following was "And You and I" in which Yt>s again performed to formulated per­fection. The vocals by Jon Anderson had more feeling which lent an air of personal involvement to the song which their per­formance lacked two years ago. The sup­posedly absent Anderson also showed talent on guitar and supplementary percussion. ' The concert was rapidly building to a peak which came in the final piece played, the fourth movement from "Tales." This was the only cut played from Yes' most criticized album, but this edition rose above the problems which cropped up in the original. Yes' rhythm section excelled here as bassist Chris Squire and drummer Ala~ White attacked their instruments, enhanced by a synthesizer. Squire's bass was the dominant instrument as it rose and rell directing the band through the expansive themes. Alan White's impressionistic drum solo stood out and dramatically brought the audience to a pitch. One ball, one strike. The band then brought the erowd to their feet with the subtle impaet of their finish 
After Yes' exit, the overwhelmed audience voiced their disapproval with a ten-minute ovation whichg led to the sole encore, "Roundabout." A disappointing lack of enthusiasm by Yes in the encore left the audience confused. The vitality 

the performance of the encore was no better than typical, although it was the best song. The audience response, however, was again enthusiastic and they expected another encore. But the exhausted players felt no obligation to the audience which, previous to the end of the concert, was for the most part passive. 
The audience was left unsatisfied which furthered their apparent misunderatanding of Yes performance. This misun­derstanding was due to the emotionally involved nature of Yt>s music. At times people unfamiliar with the music relied on the visual gimmickry to provide substance where they found none. As a result some of the music was forced to stand alone, hut the more complex works could not do so as a song such as "Roundabout" can. Hence, the frenzied response to the encore was re~trained response to the longer works. 
The increasing sophistication of Yes' music will undoubtedly alienate some of their older fans, but for those who make the effort to understand, Yes' future is unlimited.

After historic U.N. visit 
PLO leader Aralat leaves U.S. lor Cuba 

Hy HHUC'E W. MUNN 

UNITED NATIONS !UPI> Palestinian leader Yasser Ara­rat. pleased by his unprecedent­ed U.N. visit, flew to Cuba Thursday, leaving a nine-man delegation to press Palestine Liberation Organization de­mands for an all-embracing state of its own. 
The burden of the Arab campaign for such a state before the General Assembly fell upon Lebanese President Suleiman Franjieh who asked dtlegates in a low-key speech to help the Palestinian people "recover fully its national rights." 
Shafiq el Hout, the PLO delegation spokesman, said Arafat was pleased by his reception in the world organiza­tion and more than satisfied with the security arrangements, the tightest in New York history. 
He said between 200 and 300 messages were received by the PLO delegation from all parts of the United States, approving Arafat's Assembly appeal Wednesday for a Palestine as "one democratic state where Christian, Jew and Moslem live in peace, equality and frater­nity." 
Hout also said a 10-member delegation of Congress con­ferred here Thursday with PLO representatives, their first offi­cial contact with United States other than security arrange­ments for their visit. 
He said the PLO, while disapproving of U. S. policy in the Middle East, sought to work out relations with the United States. 
The Congressional visitors included four senators and six representatives, including a woman member, Hout said, but he did not name them. 
The U. S. Mission said the members of Congress were in

are only 30 cents (or 25 cents per draft) at the Senior Club. 
Rick Kanser, manager of The Library said the decline in at­tendance was "expected and ac­cepted." Explaining the price difference, Kanser said, "local bar owners operate businesses 6 days a week, 12 months a year with high overheads, whereas the Senior Club which operates only 4 nights a week has no overhead." 
A Notre Dame grad, Kanser has no animosity toward the Senior· Club. "It is a great service for students and alumni," he said. 
Kanser suggested, however, that the University "revitalize their pricing structure at the Club so as to provide competitive prices. The added profit from this price in­crease could easily be used to establish a scholarship fund," he said. 
Kanser also commented that the original basis for the Club is vanishing. "Due to com­plimentary tickets more and more non-Notre Dame people are frequenting the Club," he ex­plained. Managers of Nickie's and Corby's also noted the decline but are looking forward to this weekend to see how much effect the Senior 
-Club actually has on their businesses. 

Ping pong program promoted

Inter ·hall ping pong'? That's what 1\like Meissner, a Junior ping pong Pnthusiast is attempting to organile this winter at Notre DamP. 
"In order to start the program off." Meissner said, "I am issuing a challange to the other halls on behalf of Cavanaugh, to play against our team. We've never played on a hall basis before, and I know several good players at Cavanaugh who are eager to play," he explained. 
Each hall on campus can register a 5 or 6 member team. However, there is no limit to the

Meissner hopes that the Notre Dame girls' dorms will become involved and plans to open the

The final tournament will be set up differently from last year's. "We intend to follow the procedure of a tennis tournement where three singles and two doubles play five matches, and the first to win three games becomes the champion," Meissner explained. Last year's

half-truth. We will accede to the entire truth by helping this people to recover fully its national rights.

afternoon from 3:30 to 6:30p.m. at Kubiak's. The part is entitled "Mad-Hatter's Day" and all juniors are encouraged to wear some sort of exotic cranium covering. 
The affair will be similar to earlier "Happy Hours" and pit­chers of beer will cost $1.50 "Hopefully, the juke box will be fixed and there will be more dancing," Junior Class Secretary Sue Caranci said. 
The "Happy Hours" will resume next semester for several of the home basketball game weekends. Since the junior class formal and final exams are scheduled for later Fridays this semester, this will be the last "Happy Hour" this semester, Caranci noted. 
"We're really glad the "Happy Hours" have been so successful since they are good opportunities for on and off-campus students to get together," Caranci continued. 
Tickets for the junior class formal to be held Friday, Nov. 22, at the Four Flags Motor Inn in Niles, Mich., will be on sale this afternoon at the Kubiak tavern.

NOTRE DAME FRESHMAN PREREGISTRATION FOR ARMY ROTC 
Preregistration for the Freshman Army ROTC Spring 
Session will be held Nov. 14-21, 1974. 
No military obligation is incurred during Freshman and Sophomore years, and by enrolling, you become eligible to compete for a two-year Army ROTC scholarship during your Sophomore year. It pays full tuition, for books and academic fees, as well as $100 per month subsistence allowance. Even without a scholarship, you receive $100 monthly in your Junior and Senior years. 
Army ROTC can offer you a commission as a Second Lieutenant in thr US Army Reserve concurrent with your graduation :' :>m college with a starting salary of $10,000.00 a yepr in addition to other liberal fringe benefits. 
If you then decide to leave the Army, you'll find that employers realize that a young graduate who possesses the attributes of leadership essential for Army officers is an excellent addition to their firm. 
The Army ROTC course consists of two class hours per week and is open to all Freshmen at Notre Dame or other nearby cross-enrolled colleges. Course hours can be arranged by telephoning Major Jim Musselman at 283-6264 or by contacting him at the Notre Dame ROTC building. 
Director of the CRC. This set of 
lectures will be in conjunction with 
the CRC spring conference entitled 
"Beyond Civil Rights." 
The spring confereence will be held April 17 and 18 and will focus on health, care and urban education , especially as the deficiencies in these areas bear on the economic security and the position of minority groups. 
"In particular, we would like our conference to focus on the right of economic security, a right that might be fulfilled through guaranteed jobs or some form of income supplement," Glickstein said. 
According to Wise, "A number of distinguished academic and practical experts have agreed to present papers and discuss critical 
issues at the conference."

Hard work, determination key Paul Clarke's success 
Sophomore defenseman Paul Clarke isn't much different than other collegians who play the game of hockey. 
Still, experts of the sport will notice two distinct things which separate this 19-year old Scar­borough, Ont. native from the rest of the pack. 
First, although naturally a righthander, Clarke is very adept at taking his stick and passing and shooting from the portside. This unusual skill can be and is used to Clarke's advantage when stopping incoming forwards. 
But second, and probably most important, Clarke is the youngest player in Notre Dame's short ice history to be named captain, a post usually reserved for juniors and seniors. 
This last fact speaks for the blueliner's maturity. 
"Yes, I was surprised that the team named Paul captain in only his sophomore season," Coach Lefty Smith says. "But no, I wasn't surprised they named him to the post. 
"I think his teammates saw the same qualities I have seen in Paul­-his excellent maturity, his hard­working attitude, his good common sense, but most important, his leadership. 
"Those qualities make him an extremely easy player to coach. As a coach, you just enjoy players with Paul's attitude and ability." 
There is nothing much more you can say about the sophomore's ability--he has been the glue which has held the Irish defense together much of last season and the first part of this year. . 
Still, you have to be impressed with his attitude. It is a very un­selfish one, stressing team honors over individual ones. 
"It seemed last year's seniors 

got blamed for everything which 
went wrong," Clarke comments 
about last season's eighth-place 
WCHA squad. "And that's un­
fortunate because when you lose, it 
is a team loss. 
"But because of our record last 

year, this year's squad wants to go 
out and prove themselves. The 
whole 'team feels that it has to go 
out and do the job. 
"We have the talents and some are just putting them together. 
Pep rally set 
And although he does profess to Confidence from togetherness-­be surprised by his selection as the that's what is going to determine Irish leader on the ice, Clarke does where these youthful Irish finish realize what he had to do to help this WCHA season.

team." 
Pittsburgh ready for Irish 
(continued from page 16) '.!-formation team, and with Dorsett's injury status (a banged­up ankle) hanging over our heads, we can't make any big changes." The key to the Panther offense is quarterback Bill Daniels, a high­school rival of Irish QB Tom Clements. Daniels has completed 69 of 117 passes and has thrown for nine TD's. He is also the team's fourth-leading rusher. Middle guard Gary Burley, a 6-3; 250-pound senior, anchors the Panther defense. He has been credited with 72 tackles and 37 assists in nine games this year. "Pittsburgh," said ND head coach Ara Parseghian, "is a very physical team that is well-<:oached and well-<:onditioned. And when you give a team like that runners like Dorsett and Walker and a quarterback like Billy Daniels, you .know , you're going to be in a real tug-Qf-war." Notre Dame was idle last weekend while Pitt was surviving Temple, and the respite was a welcome one for Parseghian's fourth-ranked team. "We're very hopeful,'' said Parseghian, "that (tackle) Steve Neece, <defensive tackle) Kevin Nosbusch, and <tight end) Robin Weber can be ready for the game with Pittsburgh. None of these players saw action against Navy, and I only hope the week-Qff gave them sufficient time to heal. "We're going to need them," continued the ever-<:autious Irish coach, "because this year's Pitt team is, overall, probably the best Pitt team we've faced in the 11 years I've been at Notre Dame. There's nothing they can't do. 
"Their offense is quick and versatile and their ·defense has hung in there when it's had to this year. Johnny Majors has done an outstanding job with them, and he'll have his team ready to play tomorrow, you can count on that." 
If Majors doesn't -have the Panthers ready to play against the Irish, that fact in itself will rate as the biggest upset to occur since the , 28th of September. 
"Our football team is looking very much forward to this game," said Majors. "We know that we're going to be decided underdogs, and maybe justifiably so, but we're looking forward to it nevertheless. It will be the first time I, per­sonally, have ever taken a team into Notre Dame Stadium, so the game presents a special challenge to me. All of us," said Majors, "are eager to play this one. All of will be ready." 
Kickoff for tomorrow's game is set for 1:30 p.m. 
Cagers in action 
Notre Dame's 1974 basketball team will debut this Friday evening with an exhibition game against Athletes in Action West. The Athletes in Action squad is composed of top flight amaterus from around the country and is coached by former Chicago Bulls player-<:oach Jim King. 
As a special attraction, a film of the last five minutes of last season's 71-70 upset victory over UCLA will be shown at half time. 
Tickets for the exhibition game are one dollar for adults and 50 cents for children 18 and under as well as all Noire Dame students.
