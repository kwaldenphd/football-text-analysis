Jenkins' pay remitted to Holy Cross 
President's salary among.Zowest ofnational university leaders' compensation packages 

By EILEEN DUFFY Assistant News Editor 

While some college leaders' salaries are climbing into the millions of dollars, the total compensation for Notre Dame's president was last registered at just $476,325. Whatever the sum, in University President Father John Jenkins' case, it's his religious order -the Indiana Province of the Priests of the Holy Cross ­that reaps the benefits, not his llank account. 
The Chronicle of Higher Education's annual "Executive Compensation" report lists the salaries of public and private university leaders. While reporters may access the 2006-7 measure­ments for public schools, fig­ures for private schools become available when their tax forms are released, near­ly two years later. The $476,325 number thus corre­sponds to University President Emeritus Father Edward Malloy's final year, 2004-5. 
Of the leaders in the 853 universities, colleges and specialized schools surveyed, Audrey Doberstein of Delaware's Wilmington College -who stepped down in June of 2005 -garnered the highest pay, with a total compensation of $2,7 46,241.

Engineering enrolltnent an issue for U.S., ND 
By KAITLYNN RIELY Assistant News Editor 
In today's increasingly tech­nological world, the job prospects for engineers after college are plentiful, but at Notre Dame and at schools across the country, fewer stu­dents are choosing engineering as a career. 
The critical need for young engineers nationwide and the decreasing numbers of engi­neering majors is the basis of a new guidebook for students and parents called "21 Things Every Future Engineer Should Know." 
James Merz, interim dean of the University's College of Engineering, said there has been a decline in the number of students going into engineer­ing since he attended Notre Dame in the 1950s. 

The reason for the declining numbers, he thinks, is "lack of enthusiasm nationwide for going into engineering -a perception that engineering's very hard, and 'why should I work that hard'?" 
Catherine Pieronek, the director of Academic Affairs and the Women's Engineering Program, said the enrollments in engineering schools have been declining since the mid-

smc fundraiser dinner benefits Cambodia 
By ROHAN ANAND News Writer 
During the past three days, the Student International Business Council has hosted three events commemorating Cambodian Awareness Week, shedding light on the contin­ued economic and social dev­astation the country suffered after the Khmer Rouge incur­sions and genocide of the Vietnamese during the 1970s and 1980s. 
On Tuesday night, the SIBC showed the film "S21" and on Wednesday the movie "Bomb Hunters." It also hosted a Thai/Cambodian dinner Thursday to raise money and awareness for its Protecting the Earth and Protecting Yourself (PEPY) subdivision. 
"We were so surprised and excited by the amazing turnout," sophomore member Liz McLaughlin sa~d. "It's dis­turbing when you hear people ask if Cambodia is in Africa, so we're really glad that we're educating more people about [the conditions] there." 
PEPY, which is a non-gov­ernment organization, was founded and created by Notre Dame Class of 2002 alumna Daniella Pappy, and its aim is to promote increased aware­ness of Cambodian society. 
The Notre Dame chapter was created after senior SIBC member Tim Rann volun­teered in Cambodia two sum­mers ago and met Pappy dur­ing his time spent there.

Index rates countries' assistance 
Roodman stresses need to aid development 
By EVA BINDA News Writer 

While attempts to measure just how much the world's 21 richest countries are helping the development of poor countries can often seem tainted by opinion, Center for Global Development research fellow David Roodman claims there is an objective tool to judge this -the Commitment to Development Index. 
Roodman spoke Thursday in the Hesburgh Center about the Index and the Center for Global Development, a think tank in Washington, D.C. founded in November 2001 that "focuses on what rich countries are doing to help poor countries," looking pri­marily at government policy. 
The Index takes size into account when considering countries, which explains why, for example, a small country like Denmark can rank higher than the U.S. or Canada. 
"We're interested in seeing if countries are living up their potential," Roodman said. 
Seven components go into the Commitment to Development Index: foreign aid, trade (specifically, open­ness to the exports of devel­oping countries), investment, migration, environment, secu­

Blind sophomore swimmer hopes to participate in the China games

Sophomore Ashley Nashleanas hasn't let the fact that she was born blind inter­fere with her vision -her sights are set on making the 
U.S. Paralympic swim team for the summer 2008 games in Beijing, China. 
Nashleanas has been swim­ming for a decade, and at just 20 years old, she has already competed in the Paralympic Games -the second-largest sporting event in the world, behind the Olympics.

Bleeding

Whenever I meet someone for the first time and they learn that I am from Green Bay, Wis., I undoubtedly get asked about one of the following three things: cold weather, the dairy industry or foot­ball. So let me clear a few

before I go any

not really cold 
outside until 

the wind chill hits below zero. Happy 
cows come from Wisconsin, not 
California -as a certain commercial 
asserts. And yes, I will join my city in 
mourning by dressing in black for a 
week when Brett Favre retires. 
Growing up in Green Bay, the NFL's 
smallest city, football penetrates nearly 
every aspect of life. We are the only com­
munity-owned major league professional 
sports team in America, with nearly 
112,000 people holding stock in the 
Packers. Every Packer game at Lambeau 
Field has been sold out since 1960. The 
waiting list for season tickets is 71,500 
people long. That adds up to 35 years. 
Most Green Bay residents are placed 
on that waiting list a few minutes after 
receiving a birth certificate, and it is not 
uncommon to will Packer season tickets 
to a family member upon one's death. 
School is cancelled for the parade and 
ceremony that follows a Super Bowl vic­
tory. It would be an understatement to 
say that the identity of our city revolves 
around the Packers. 

When I first came to South Bend, I had 
no idea that I could find a place so simi­
lar to Green Bay. South Bend's intense 
obsession with Notre Dame football con­
stantly reminded me of my hometown ·and I soon realized that the two teams had more in common than I thought. 
The founder of the Packers, Curly 
Lambeau, attended Notre Dame before 
he established the Packers in 1921. 
While at Notre Dame, he played under 
the legendary Knute Rockne. Lambeau 
was so fond of his alma mater that he 
chose navy blue and gold for the 
Packers' original colors. Now, more than 
80 years after the founding of the 
Packers, no other college has produced 
more Packer players than Notre Dame, 
with 50 total, including Heisman winner 
Paul Hornung. 

Although the Packers' origins have strong ties to Notre Dame, I think the most significant similarity is the dedica­tion of their fans. Through the good, the bad and the ugly, Packer and Notre Dame fans both stand by their teams to the end. We rejoice in the victories and feel the bitter sting of a particularly harsh defeat, but regardless of what happens on the field, nothing can alter our commitment. That's what makes football cities like Green Bay and South Bend so special. They are communities that support their teams through it all, instead of cities full of bandwagon jumpers who are only fans when their team has a successful season. 
The true test of fans is how they react 
during the challenging times. Green Bay 
and Notre Dame fans have yet to fail that 
test, which makes me proud to be part of 
each community.

Screen-writer lectures on success 
'Family Guy' scripter, co-star preaches persistence, discusses challenges 
By JOHN-PAUL WITT News Writer 
"Family Guy" writer and co­star Mike Henry shared a behind-the-scenes look at the life of a cartoon star with 80 audi­ence members in DeBartolo Thursday. 
"Stick to your guns," was Henry's advice to hopeful Hollywood aspirants. 
"When you're 32 and broke it's depressing, but I couldn't settle for anything else," he said. "If you can do anything else in the world besides being in Hollywood and be happy, do it. But for me, that was impossible." 
Henry's life was not one of instant success. He didn't land the full-time job writing for "Family Guy" until he was 32, and that was only after many false starts and years of poverty. 
"Family Guy" is a popular car­toon on the Fox network enter­ing its sixth season of production, and Henry attributes the show's success to the fact that each episode takes 10 months to pro­duce. 
"Being rewritten for months and months makes our jokes much stronger than a normal sit­com, which is shot in a week and can't be re-shot," he said. 
The concept which drives "Family Guy," Henry said, is both the desire to "make fun of every­thing" and the idea that each individual joke will only be understood by 10 percent of the audience -but that 10 percent "$30,000 in credit card debt." will enjoy the joke that much The success of his short films, more. however, led to an offer as a

Battle of the Bands to support local groups 
By MANDl STIRONE News Writer 

The Dance Marathon Fundraising Committee will bring four bands to Saint Mary's Saturday night for a Battle of the Bands. 
Harper's Valley, Solus and Sola, Katuius and Rebecca Schiappa will be battling it out for studio time, photo packages and gift certificates, said Frances Bruder, assistant director of Student Activities at Saint Mary's. 
The event will take place in the Saint Mary's Student Center · Lounge from 6 p.m. to 9, and costs $10 at the door. T-shirts will also be sold at the event for $10. 
The bands are primarily com­posed of Saint Mary's and Notre Dame students with one band from outside of the schools. Notre Dame sophomores Ashley Ahn and David Lee form the band Solus and Sola. 
Harper's Valley is made up of six Notre Dame students: junior Will Weicher, sophomore Chris Terschluse, senior Chris Urban, junior Chris Doolin, senior Jim Weicher and junior Rob Mineo. The band viewed this as a last hurrah since Will Weicher and Doolin are both going abroad next semester, Will Weicher said. The band played at Dance Marathon last year, and after some Saint Mary's students e­mailed group members, they decided to participate in the Battle of the Bands. The band could be classified as rock/jam and plays everything from class­ing rock to 90s pop, Weicher said. 
Schiappa, a Saint Mary's fresh­man, heard about Battle of the Bands through an e-mail sent to Saint Mary's students and was interested. Schiappa described her original lyrics as funny and "SNL-like," saying they're meant to be "just kind of joking around in an awkward way." 
Dance Marathon Fundraising chair Sarah Voss and her com­mittee are heading up the Battle of the Bands, the first big public fundraiser for Dance Marathon. The committee is hoping to raise about a thousand dollars and draw 200 people, Voss said. 
"It would be a good way to get the community excited for Dance Marathon," Voss said. 
One hundred percent of the proceeds from the event, includ­ing T-shirt sales, are going toward Dance Marathon and Riley Hospital. 
The Dance Marathon Committee plans to organize other fundraisers and events, including a dinner and a Mass at Saint Mary's. While it is also look­ing to plan an eating contest, a chapstick sale and a pasta din­ner, these events are all up in the air, said Dance Marathon chair Francesca Johnson.

Jenkins 
continued from page 1 

The highest-paid public uni­versity president was David P. Roselle at the University of Delaware, who will receive just under $1 million for 2006­7. 
Of the 33 schools classified as research universities with "very high research activity," Vanderbilt University's E. Gordon Lee earned the highest sum -and the third-highest of all private universities ­receiving about $1.2 million in 2004-5. Malloy's salary, on the other hand, was the second­lowest in the group. 
"I would say that the $400,000 level for an elite pri­vate institution is in the domain of normal, but maybe slightly low," said Paul Fain, a staff reporter at The Chronicle of Higher Education. 
Presidential compensation, Fain explained, includes not only the base salary and retirement pay, but also deferred compensation -pay set aside by the institution not available to the president until he reaches an agreed-upon requirement. Performance and retention bonuses can also be added to the mix. 
Whether the result of bonus­es or normal salary increases, Malloy's compensation did rise from $260,264 in the 1996-7 fiscal year to the aforemen­tioned $476,325, Fain noted. 
But those increases didn't mean more money for Malloy, and they don't mean more money for Jenkins. What's growing, rather, is the com­mon purse shared by the Priests of the Holy Cross. 
"It's interesting that at reli­gious institutions, the leader will donate his/her salary to the religious order," Fain said. "It's pretty unique in higher education, now." 
Like all the Holy Cross priests at Notre Dame, Jenkins took a vow of poverty that requires him to donate any money he earns from employ­ment to the order. 
"A diocesan priest, like from a parish, doesn't take those vows, so he is able to own things," said Father Anthony Szakaly, the assistant provin­cial for the Indiana Province of the Holy Cross Priests, which is headquartered in South Bend. "We don't own anything ourselves -everything we have belongs to the province, to the Holy Cross. 
"We give everything we have, and we take what we need from the common purse." 

In addition to funding the Even people who are critical of priests' personal expenditures, high presidential pay recog­money from the common nize that," he said.

"These jobs are really tough. incredibly difficult jobs ... At Notre Dame, you add the extra element. He is 'Father' Jenkins. He has to have moral leadership qualities that maybe you don't have at other universities. It's an extra role he has to play, and it makes it a really challenging job." 
The role of professor is one that Malloy continued to play throughout his presidency. Jenkins, on the other hand, taught his last philosophy course in the spring of 2003, before he was inaugurated president. 
"He's got a big job and he's still new to it, so he's got a good bit to learn," said Paul Weithman, chair of the philos­ophy department. "I would love to have him teaching for us because he's a very good teacher, but the most impor­tant thing he can do for us is be a good president. 
''I'm most happy having him devote his time, attention and energy to that." 
As Weithman noted, Jenkins' busy travel schedule and "very visible" role in the American Catholic Church might impede him from best fulfilling his professorial duties -but Weithman thinks Jenkins is finding other ways to do the very things teaching allows. 
"Given what I know of him, I don't have any doubt he has ways to stay intellectually vital because he loves to read, think and write," Weithman said. "Also, one argument for teach­ing is it helps the president to stay in touch with the student ... but I'm sure he's in touch with students anyway." 
He also is in touch with his religious brothers, Szakaly said. 
"Right now, Father Jenkins is being called to be president of Notre Dame; before, Father Malloy was called to be presi­dent; now Malloy will be back in classroom, contributing in that way. We'r.e all working together for the same goal of promoting the mission of Holy Cross in building the kingdom as God gives us the gifts to do so. Jenkins lives with us; he joins us for common meals and common prayer. 
"He's part of our community in a very real way."

Annan calls for $4 billion in aid 
UNITED NATIONS -Secretary-General Kofi Annan appealed for nearly $4 billion Thursday to help millions of people in 29 countries "whose lives have been crippled by conflict and calamity." 
He said the people in need -overwhelm­ingly women and children -"subsist on the very margins of society" in places like Somalia, the Palestinian territories and Congo. 
"These 27 million individuals seek not a hand out, but a hand up," Annan said at the launch of the 2007 humanitarian appeal. "Their names may be unknown to us, their lives hidden from view, but their cry for our attention must not go unanswered." 
Prime minister faces government revoh 
BAGHDAD -Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki faced a widening revolt within his divided government as two senior Sunni politicians joined prominent Shiite lawmak­ers and Cabinet members in criticizing his policies. 
Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi said he wanted to see al-Maliki's government gone and another "understanding" for a new coalition put in place with guarantees that ensure collective decision making. 
"There is a clear deterioration in security and everything is moving in the wrong direction," the Sunni leader told The Associated Press. "This situation must be redressed as soon as possible. If they contin­ue, the country will plunge into civil war." 
Al-Maliki's No. 2, Deputy Prime Minister Salam Zikam Ali al-Zubaie, also a Sunni, argued that the president's government failed to curb the spread of sectarian poli­tics.

Microsoft releases new Vista 
Company's first operating system since 2001 to be available fan. 30for home use 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Microsoft Corp. launched its first new computer operating system in five years Thursday, say­ing that despite delays, the product's emergence is per­fectly timed for PC users who increasingly need to coordinate information from a dizzying array of sources. 
Opening an hourlong demonstration and press conference at the Nasdaq Stock Market, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer acknowl­edged that Windows Vista should have been out long ago. 
"I should probably say it's an exciting thing to finally be here -and that's all I'll say about the past," Ballmer said, before adding: "This is the biggest launch in our company's history, that's for sure." 
Businesses that buy Windows licenses in bulk have first crack at PCs with the new operating system or at upgrade discs for installing Vista on existing machines. Consumers won't be able to get Vista on home PCs until Jan. 30. 
Microsoft and computer vendors contend that Vista will make computers more secure, powerful and graph­ically dynamic, especially when combined with other products Microsoft is releas­ing simultaneously.

"We are also facing a situa­tion where a large number of engineers who were educated in the 50s and 60s in this country are getting to the point of retirement and so there is going to be a gap in knowl­edge," Pieronek said. "That From approximately 1996 until 2000, there was a large dip in the number of engineering stu­dents at Notre Dame. 
Merz credited his predeces­sor, former dean Frank Incropera, with reversing this sharp decline. 
Incropera started a cam­paign to make engineering more interesting to freshmen who intended to declare it as their major. He created a new introduction to engineering class and the Learning Center to encourage their interest.

Pieronek has also questioned why more students are not entering the engineering field, especially women. She said the .problem is "puzzling," espe­cially since women now make up the majority of undergradu­

"Companies realize now that they need to have women involved in the engineering process, but schools aren't graduating enough women to fill their demand," Pieronek said. 
Women make up 24.6 per­cent of the undergraduates enrolled in the College of Engineering. Throughout the University, they account for approximately 4 7 percent of students. 
To encourage women to enter engineering and support them during their years in the college, the Women's Engineering Program was started with the entering Class of 2006, Pieronek said. 
The program is a way for older students to mentor younger students, Pieronek said. 
"If the younger students see that the older students have gotten through and have thrived and are getting good jobs, the younger students are more likely to believe they ean do it," she said.

percent. 

Sophomore Carol Matasci, a chemical engineer, said the support she received from Notre Dame's chapter of the Soei1~ty of Women Engineers "was actual­ly part of what helped me decide to stay in engineering." 
"As a freshman I was pretty intimidated by my classmates," Matasci said. "Talking to the older girls was kind of encour­aging, to see that I could do it." 
Matasci said she thinks there is still an expectation that women arc more attracted to an Arts and Letters major than to one involving science and technology. 
"I think women have a dif­ferent perspective to engineer­ing, and I think when you are trying to solve problems, dif­ferent ideas and different per­spectives are useful to have," Matasci said. 
Diversifying the workplace 
This diversity of thought is an objeetive that Ivan Favila, the director of the Minority Engineering Program, is trying to achieve. 
"In order for the engineering innovation to be its strongest here in this country, you will need a diversity of thought that eomes from a diversity of people," he said. "When you have such a majority of like engineers, then you lack that dynamic." 
Minority students comprised about 13.4 pereent of total undergraduate engineers in 2006. 
The reason for this low num­ber, Favila said, may be that

some minority students who come to Notre Dame don't know any professional engi­neers. 
"Since there is an under-rep­resentation of minorities in the engineering workforce, you might see that trickle down to the number of students exposed to engineers and thus we will have a lesser number of minorities go into engineer­ing," he said. 
The Minority Engineering Program encourages minority students both to enroll at Notre Dame and to stay in the major onee tiH~y enter into it. An orientation course adver­tised for minority students, but open to anyone interested in engineering, provides informa­tion about what the discipline entails. 
Notre Dame's retention rate for minority engineers between freshman and sopho­more year is slightly more than 50 percent, compared to a national retention rate of approximately 34 percent, Favila said. 
"We are doing a little bit bet­ter in terms of national num­bers, but 50 percent, at least for me, is not good enough," he said. 
The program now has a strong base of people who have graduated from Notre Dame with the help of the Minority Engineering program and who have succeeded as engineering professionals. 
Improving engineering's pub­lic relations 
The College of Engineering still wants to increase its undergraduate numbers, Merz said. But part of the problem is the type of students Notre Dame has been admitting. 
"We can't get more [engi­neering majors[ if Admissions doesn't admit more engineer­ing intents," he said. 
Part of the problem with attracting students lies in a public relations problem for engineers, Merz said. A new engineering building located prominently on Notre Dame Avenue might do the job of attracting more students, he said. 
·"Since it is right on Notre Dame Avenue, it will be a mar­velous public relations institu­tion for the College," he said. 
The new building will be loeated between McKenna Hall and the flesburgh Center for International Studies. Construction is scheduled to begin in 2008 and be complet­ed by 2010. 
Engineers will continue to do "a lot of absolutely critical things for soeiety," Merz said, and Notre Dame engineers will graduate into a good job mar­ket. 
"Every report we get is that employers want to hire Notre Dame engineers," he said.

high school at the time, mak­ing her "one of the youngest members of the U.S. swim team," she said. While partic­ipants in the Paralympics may be visually impaired or blind like Nashleanas, com­peting athletes' disabilities range from amputation to multiple sclerosis to cerebral palsy. 
Nashleanas began her swimming career free of fam­ily pressure -she doesn't come from a family of swim­mers. Rather. she first began the sport because "I thought swimming was fun and that I'd give it a try,'' she said. 
Nashleanas' competitive spirit has kept her focused on her goals, and she has been training hard in the pool ­"usually five to six days a week, three miles a day" -in order to be prepared for the April 2008 Paralympic trials. 
She hopes to qualify in the 100 back and perhaps the 400 freestyle, and said she prefers swimming longer dis­tances over sprints. 
When she is logging so much time and distance in the pool, Nashleanas said she appreciates the occasional practice with fellow hopeful Paralympic swimming com­petitor, second year political science graduate student James Fetter. Nashleanas 

said while she and Fetter have very different schedules, they both relish the opportu­nity to work out together. 
Fetter and Nashleanas are both working with Irish Aquatics master's coach Annie Sawicki, Nashleanas said. 
Nashleanas said the mas­ter's swim team provides Notre Dame students, faculty, alumni and local community members with the opportuni­ty to swim competitively. 
Notre Dame's Office for Students with Disabilities supports Nashleanas' swim­ming by providing her with "tappers" for both practice and competition. The tappers stand at each end of her swimming lane. Using a pole with a tennis ball attached, they tap her head or shoulder at the appropriate time so she knows when to make her turn or to touch the wall, Nashleanas said. 
She said this was the only modification she could think of that she needed as a blind swimmer. 
Balancing school work with her tough training schedule is "difficult, but possible," she said. 
"The biggest challenge is just working through practice when you're tired," Nashleanas said. "But if you really want it, you've got to go for it."

[Pappy's] enthusiasm for spreading awareness and developing the opportunities available for children in Cambodia," Rann said. "I felt that the diverse, 200-member SIBC could help promote PEPY at Notre Dame." 
PEPY mainly works to bene­fit Cambodian children, who are the first generation of a younger population to survive after the Khmer Rouge devas­tation. PEPY hopes to build homes and schools to house and educate the children in rural and urban areas. 
"There are more land mines than children in the entire country," sophomore member Kate McDermott said. "There are even more than the amount used during World War II. I think that the $5 donations will go a long way." 
Well over 50 people showed up for the event. Many, like freshman Cassidy Blair, knew of friends who had volun­teered in Cambodia and want­ed to learn more about the sit­uation in the poverty-stricken country. 
"My friend's sister works as a missionary in Cambodia," she said, "and I'm so impressed that the SIBC is working for such a good cause." 
The event also had a special guest, Heather Connell, the executive producer of Los Angeles-based Displaced Yankee Productions. Connell showed the trailer for a docu­mentary she has been working on for a few years, called "Small Voices: Stories of Cambodia's Children." 

"The film focuses on the plight of street and garbage­dump children," Connell said, "and explores how the chil­dren view themselves, their lives and their future." 
Connell and her fellow pro­ducers selected five Cambodian children to be the subjects of the documentary. Interviewing, interacting with and filming the children, she said, has been "life altering." 
"Standing in [the city of] Stung Meanchey," she said, "and seeing barefoot and dirty children digging through garbage, where medical waste is dumped off, was horrify­ing." 
PEPY members are also exploring the option of work­ing with Cambodian Children's Fund (CCF) and a non-profit organization that rescues abandoned children. 
''I'm looking into the option of interning with the CCF next summer in Cambodia;" junior Allison Fleece said. "It will require me to teach English to orphans, which may not be easy, but I'm definitely going to convince my mom to let me go."

rity and technology. These components are all weighted equally, which can create controversy, Roodman said. 
"The main purpose of this tool is to create communica­tion and stimulate discussion. The biggest advantage for not weighting the compo­nents is to make it easy for people to understand," Roodman said. "I've heard people argue that [a particu­lar component] should be weighted more heavily for 
each one  of these compo­ 
nents  so  I think it's  bal­ 
anced."  

When looking at foreign aid, Roodman insists that aid is more than quantity. Quality of aid is important, he said, which means looking at how democratic the governments are and whether or not the aid is "tied." 
"For example, if the United States gives aid to Uganda, there could be strings attached. 'If you take this money, you have to spend on it on American contractors,"' Roodman said. "That's 'tying' the aid, which reduces the quality of the aid because it prevents the ability to shop around. The United States is one of the worse offenders." 
Another example of the 

limitations of benefits of for­eign aid is shown through the relation to trade, which includes tariffs and subsidies. 
"In May 2005, the United States gave 90 million dollars to tsunami relief," Roodman said. "The three countries that benefited most pay about five million dollars in tariffs to the United States, so you could say the U.S. made back its money in six months." 
Ultimately, Roodman said, all of the components have their own rewards and down­sides. Although the U.S. ranked high in the areas of trade and investment, it ended up 13th on the index overall. The Netherlands took the top position this year, and Japan finished at the bottom of the list, which included 21 countries. 
"The key message is that helping is more than aid, aid is more than quantity, and every country can do better." Roodman said. "The big countries, which can make the biggest difference, are not stepping up to the plate." 
Roodman holds a bache­lor's degree in theoretical mathematics from Harvard.

New ticket policy blurs true Notre Dame family 
As an alumnus, parent of a recent grad, and par­ent of a current sophomore, I was disappointed to learn about the most recent change in football tick­et policy as it relates to parents of current stu­dents. For many years, parents have been able to purchase four tickets to two pre-selected games, typically games that are likely to generate lower overall ticket demand. 
Over the years, this has allowed our family to treat grandparents, godparents and siblings to their first experience of a Notre Dame football weekend. But parents of present and future stu­dents will not have that luxury, because the new policy guarantees only two tickets to one game -a 75 percent reduction! 
Be prepared to tell your grandparents, brothers, sisters and other relatives to watch the games on NBC, because if Mom and Dad are traveling out for a game, there won't be any additional tickets. It is curious that this change occurs at the same time that 5,000 season tickets have miraculously become available, as long as one is willing to spend $3,000 to $5,000 per year for two tickets. Even more disturbing is the fact that one need not have any relationship to the University to purchase these tickets, as long as an additional $1,500 contribu­tion is made. 
Apparently the price of admission to the "Notre Dame Family" has been set at $4,500 to $6,500. I can certainly understand that some changes to the parent ticket policy might be necessary due to increased demand, but wouldn't it make more sense to guarantee four tickets to one game (still a 50 percent reduction)? Then the true extended Notre Dame family will continue to have the oppor­tunity to experience the tradition of a football weekend.

Direction of Zahm examined, questioned 
Zahm shift unwanted, unnecessary 

My name is Mark Marquez and from 1999 to 2003, I lived in Zahm Hall. In my time in Zahm Hall, I served on the Freshman Orientation Committee my sophomore year and was as co-commis­sioner at Zahm Hall Foodsales my senior year. My years as a Notre Dame student and a resident of Zahm Hall constituted some of the happiest moments and best memories in my life. I was deeply sad­dened upon reading the article "Zahm struggles with culture shift" because the article describes the growing indiffer­ence and apathy now associated with being a Zahmbie. 
While I was a student at Notre Dame, Zahm did have the "Animal House" rep­utation, but along with that also came the Zahm Hall spirit. I do believe that Zahm was the closest thing to a fraterni­ty in terms of dorms at Notre Dame. There was a camaraderie among the men that lived in Zahm, but unlike a fra­ternity, Zahm had none of the negative drawbacks, such as the hazing that goes on in most traditional fraternities. I would hardly consider intoxicated jun­iors and seniors coming home from bars and waking up freshmen a hazing ritual. With that, I pose the question, "What older brother hasn't played a prank on a younger brother?" Now, I understand that a line has to be drawn somewhere, and I don't condone any type of physical abuse, or waking up freshmen the night before mid-terms or finals, but that is a far cry from an actionable offense wor­thy of sending students to Residence Life. 
In my time at Notre Dame, I never truly felt that Zahm was a "whipping boy." Yeah, jokes were made, but I would submit to you, the source of those jokes came from those who only wish they could emulate the Zahm Spirit, and those jokes were never taken seriously anyway. Besides a sense of community and togetherness, the Zahm Spirit also encompassed community service. While the assertion was made that Zahm Foodsales was neglected, one thing myself and the other co-commissioner accomplished in our tenure as Commissioners of Foodsales was the donation of Foodsales profits to a local charity in South Bend called, "There are Children Here," founded by Jim Langford. That is a rich tradition that seems to have died. 
The article made mention of two Zahm Hall rectors: Father Dan Parrish and Father Tom Bednar. I feel I would be remiss if I hadn't mentioned, at this point, a rector that truly embodied the Zahm spir_it. Before Parrish became rec­tor, before Bednar's tenure and even before his immediate predecessor Father Jim Lies, was Father Jim King. Rather than fighting the Zahm spirit, King embraced it. I personally have met Father King only once, at one of the famous Zahm Decade Dances, but I know him from the stories that were told about him by Zahmbies that came before me. 
One such story had King in the middle of the debate regarding which dorm to convert into an all female dorm: Zahm or Cavanaugh. As the story goes, King told the administration that if Zahm were to be converted to a female dorm, he would lock himself in his room, and let the Zahmbies have free reign. By sharing this story, I do not intend to promote complete anarchy. I simply mean to illus­trate that Zahm Hall, as a dorm, and as a community constitutes one of the strongest bonds a Notre Dame student could have, and precluding its existence is a tragedy. · 
Furthermore, if you have been accept­ed at the University of Notre Dame as a student, there is a reason for it. Every year, I read about the average SAT score getting higher every year as well as the statistics on students at Notre Dame being generally well rounded. It's not like Notre Dame has "undesirable" matriculants who are then ostracized to Zahm. Zahm Hall is not British Colonial Australia. 
Finally, the article alluded to legendary dining hall dinners, rowdiness at the football pep rallies and the running of naked males through LaFortune. While I agree with Zahm dinners and pep rallies being loud and boisterous, I don't believe the description of "naked males streak­ing through LaFortune" is entirely accu­rate; we were all wearing shoes. 
Mark Marquez alum Class of2003 Nov. 30 
Debate overblown 

As a member of the Zahm community, the very one that has cultivated my heart as well as mind, I must address the opposing viewpoints on the current state of the dorm. I start with a simple mes­sage to both parties: Get over yourselfl 
While I would like to thank Zahm Hall rector Father Dan Parrish for winning the Interhall football championship and ensuring that there are no dirty dishes in the dorm kitchen, I disagree with him when he says there is an indifference to the dorm's "unofficial traditions," the ones that are supposedly disappearing. The indifference lies far beyond streak­ing and vomiting, two traditions that are necessary to foster such a loving com­munity. The fact is that most of the resi­dents don't buy any of the rhetorical nonsense that people use to justify any "traditions" and Parrish just happens to be residing over the dorm when resi­dents are finally "waking up." 
In fact, Parrish isn't responsible for the eradication of any of these sacred tradi­tions. Has anyone given any thought that people don't like being woken up in the middle of the night? Is it possible that most would like to keep their doors intact? Could it be that vomiting is repul­sive? Sadly, most of the former residents would like to reminisce of the good old days when public vomiting and vandal­ism were encouraged. These are the same sad individuals who will roam the halls of Zahm 30 years from now, talking about how they tried to save the dorm and how they still hold a grudge against that mean old Father Dan. 
Let's face it-Parrish, as much as he would like to credit himself for providing some change in the dorm, isn't responsi­ble for anything more than a few extra weights and televisions in public areas, and the Zahm "traditions" were destined to be lost because things just change. 
The two-day article in The Observer was just another example of how every­one at this school thinks they're impor­tant, when the truth is that they just have too much time on their hands. 
Patrick Tucker sophomore Zahm Nov. 30 
Zahm Hall more than just a building 

In The Observer's recent article about Zahm Hall ("Zahm struggles with culture shift," Nov. 29), the way that Zahm Hall rector Father Dan Parrish describes what Zahm was like when he arrived in 2003 is very telling. "When I came here in the fall of 2003, Zahm was a mess, in every way," Parrish said. "We were broke -flat broke. We had no money ... Our weight room was a pigsty, carpet torn up, just tattered, black smudges all over the walls. Common spaces were just dilapidated. The Foodsales kitchen was dirty, full of rundown broken refrigera­tors, carpets -everything was just kind of neglected." The first "problem" that Parrish mentions is a lack of fmances. I would like to remind him that Zahm is a place for students to live and not a busi­ness. 
At the time of his arrival, Zahm Foodsales donated all its proceeds to a charity that Zahm had very close ties to: There Are Children Here. Unfortunately, TACH is no longer running so the Foodsales money stays in the dorm and finances are up. This might make Parrish happy, but if I still lived in Zahm, I can say that I would much rather see revenues going to kids in need than to keeping Zahm in the black. 
Secondly, his description of the dorm is clearly one of an outsider. He describes physical blemishes, something a stranger might notice upon walking through Zahm when it is empty of residents. In other words, thesf' ' all superficial ele­ments of the dorn-Lhings that might be said to constitt its image but not its identity. When I walked into Zahm for the first time in 2003 r did not notice any of these blemish· Pirst of all, I thought rundown refr,go·rators and old carpets were something I might encounter at a college. But I think the real reason I did not notice was that I was so distracted by all the great people that lived in Zahm. 
Zahm might have been old and cruddy, but that hardly mattered when its resi­dents formed such an enthusiastic com­munity. I could not take an outsider's perspective of the dorm because from the moment I walked in my peers made me feel welcomed and at home. The problem I see with Parrish's mindset is that he is overly concerned with Zahm's image, and this leads him to ignore its identity. He has to realize that the dorm is a place for students to live -they are the most important part. And they don't care about torn carpets, old refrigerators and messy weight rooms if they are with friends in a place where they feel at home. 
It does not matter if parents get the wrong idea about Zahm from some secu­rity guard. Parents are not the ones liv­ing in the dorm, and they will fmd out soon enough from their kids that Zahm is a great place. The fact that Zahm had a "bad reputation" was always just part of the fun for those of us who lived there. I always thought that people who put stock in this "bad rep" really did not know a thing about Zahm. Unfortunately, it seems like Parrish is one of them.

' ' 
Pat Terrell batting down Steve Walsh's two-point attempt. Joe Montana hitting Kris Haines for a touchdown as time expires. Two point conversion, Mirer to Brooks in the back of the endzone. Shawn Wooden knocking down Charlie Ward's desper­ation heave. 
All these moments have become part of Notre Dame football lore, though most of them haven't been seen by fans in the context of their full games. Yet all of these great moments are col­lected in A&E's new eight-disc set, "University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish -Collector's Edition (College Football's Greatest Games)." The mammoth and exhaustive set collects seven and a half of Notre Dame's greatest victories from 1966 to 1993, each presented in its entirety (with one exception). 
The games included on the set are: 
+ 
The Green Jersey Game (1977 regular season vs. USC) . 

+ The 1978 Cotton Bowl vs. Texas 

+ 
The "Chicken Soup Game" (1979 Cotton Bowl vs. Houston)

+ 
The "Catholics vs. Conviets Game" (1988 regular season vs. Miami)

+ 1989 Fiesta Bowl vs. West Virginia 

+ 
The "Snow Bowl" (1992 regular season vs. Penn State) 

+ 
The "Game of the Century" (1993 regular season vs. Flol'ida State) 

+ 
The second half of the "Game of the Century" (1966 regular season vs. Michigan State) 


A glance at the rosters of these games indicates just how powerful Notre Dame was between 1977 and 1993. Joe Montana, Rocket Ismail, Tony Rice, Bob Golic, Ken MacAfee, Aaron Taylor, Chris Zorich, Michael Stonebreaker, Reggie Brooks, Rick Mirer and Jerome Bettis all make appearances. 
While there admittedly some great games missing from this Sf1t (the 1973 Sugar Bowl against Alabama, the 1980 game against Michigan, the 1992 "Cheerios Bowl" against Florida), the contests on this set are indeed among the most classic and legendary in Notre Dame -and therefore, college football -history. 
The most entertaining game on the entire set may be the Snow Bowl against Penn State, which marked the end of the 1992 regular season. In a swirling snowstorm, the Irish, led by Rick Mirer, Reggie Brooks and Jerome Bettis, fought a young Kerry Collins-led Penn State in a defensive struggle. Trailing 16-9 late in the fourth, Mirer led the Irish down the field before find­ing Bettis in the endzone. Holtz then elected to take a risk -go for two points and the win. Mirer took the snap and dropped back almost 15 yards before finding Heggie Brooks in the back corner of the endzone for the unlikely win. 
There are at least two games on the set which reach almost epic propor­tions -the 1988 "Catholics vs. Conviets" against Miami (arguably the greatest game in Irish history) and the 1993 "Game of the Century" against Florida State. In both contests, Notre Dame. held ofT late rallies by batting down passes by the respective oppos­ing quarterbaekers (Steve Walsh in 1988 and eventual Heisman winnor Charlie Ward in 1993). Watehing Holtz and his coordinators (defensive coordi­nator Barry Alvarez in 1988 and Hick Minter in 1993) match wits against Jimmy Johnson and Bobby Bowden is a spocial treat. Additionally, it's mar­velously funny to see Bobby Bowden and Joe Paterno coaching during their heyday more than a decade ago when the young coaches were in their mere 60s. 
Oddly enough, a lot of memorable plays (particularly from the Holtz years) didn't actually come from any of these games. No Tim Brown returns, no big Bettis runs, no electrifying Hoeket returns. Yet the games present­ed were arguably more complete, and also showed how underrated Tony Rice was as Notre Dame's last Champio­ship quartmback. 
Most of the presentations were taken from their cable broadcasts, though Bob Costas' classic introduction to the Game of the Century is noticeably missing. Also, unsurprisingly, Keith Jaekson and Brent Musberger ­announcers on some of the games ­were no less annoying then than they are now. 
The most intriguing game on the set is the 19(>6 matchup between Notre Dame and Miehigan State. Though the picture quality isn't the greatest and it only eontains the second half of the game, it still stands as one of the most bizarre and frustrating ties in football history. The Irish wPre without their starting quarterbaek and tailback and fought back to tie the game at 10-10, with Parseghian's eonservative choice to sit on the ball (and thus, the tie) going down as a memorable and con­troversial decision. 

The box set itself is fantastic. Each of the games is shown in its entirety and the quality of the presentations is gen­erally very high, though the 1977 Green Jersey Game has a considerable portion of the game whieh is far fuzzi­er. The set is sparse on special features but with eight complete games, it does­n't really need any. Notre Dame's foot­ball tradition, as presented, speaks for itself. 
For Irish fans, this set is a blessing. While the Notre Dame faithful hope and expect Charlie Weis to bring the Irish back to tlw top of the football world, with this sRt they can look back at some of the program's glory days and wake up the eehoes in the comfort of their home.

PHILADELPHIA Pitcher Adam Eaton and the Philadelphia Phillies finalized a $24.5 million, three-year contract on Thursday. A first-round pick by the Phillies in 1996, Eaton is 54-45 with a 4.40 ERA in seven major league seasons. He has been on the disabled list six times in his career, but the Phillies are banking on the right-hander to fill out their rotation. 
Eaton, who turned 29 on. Thanksgiving, was 7-4 with a 5.12 ERA in 13 starts in his only season with Texas, making $4.65 million. He won 11 games

in consecutive seasons with San Diego before he was traded to the Rangers last December. 
Eaton solidifies a prom­ising rotation that includes Brett Myers (12-7, 3.91 ERA), Cole Hamels (9-8, 4.08), Jon Lieber (9-11, 
4.93) and Jamie Moyer (11-14, 4.30 with the Phillies and Seattle). 
"He stabilizes our rota­tion and will complement the rest of our staff nice­ly," general manager Pat Gillick said. 
The Phillies' only other free-agent signing so far this offseason was infield­er Wes Helms, who got a $5.45 million, two-year deal. Gillick wanted slug­ger Alfonso Soriano, but the Chicago Cubs outbid everyone else for the five­time All-Star. 

Going into next week's winter meetings, the Phillies want to upgrade their bullpen, add a catch· er and still hope to find a right-handed hitter to pro­tect NL MVP Ryan Howard in the middle of the line­up. 
Gillick wouldn't com­ment about reports that the team backed out of a deal with reliever Joe Borowski after he was given an extensive physi· cal. Borowski went 3-3 with a 3.75 ERA and 36 saves in 72 appearances for the Florida Marlins last season. 
"Medical situations are tricky to talk about," Gillick said, adding the team has made proposals to other relievers. 
Eaton's best season was his final one with the Padres. He went 11-5 with a 4.27 ERA in 22 starts in 2005 after going 11-14 with a 4.61 ERA in 33 starts the previous season. 

Eaton had elbow surgery in July 2001 and didn't return until the following September. He missed sev­eral starts in '05 with a ­strained middle finger and didn't make his first start with Texas until late July because of the same finger injury.

Gophers coach Monson 
resigns after slow start 
MINNEAPOLIS -Dan Monson resigned as the men's basketball coach at Minnesota on Thursday, one day after the Gophers' fifth straight defeat left them with their longest losing streak in more than 40 years. 
Assistant coach Jim Molinari will take over as interim head coach. 
The Gophers fell to 2-5 with a 90­68 horne loss to Clemson on Wednesday night. Minnesota's skid is its worst in nonconference play since a six-game slide during the 1962-63 season. 
Monson, who received a $1.1 mil­lion buyout from the university, said "a new voice" was needed. 
"I think at the end of the day as a coach, if you're not putting the play­ers first, if you're not putting the university first, you're not doing the job. And I'm trying to do my job here." 
Jockey Baze ties all-time 
record for victories 
SAN MATEO, Calif.-Russell Baze tied Laffit Pincay Jr.'s record of 9,530 victories Thursday at Bay Meadows, winning by 4 1/2 lengths aboard Christie's Fame in the sixth race. 
Far from the glamour, rich races and classy horses that define thor­oughbred racing in Southern California and New York, Baze got the job done in his typical workman­like fashion. 
He sent Christie's Fame to the lead .out of the gate and settled along the rail. They maintained a length lead on the backstretch. Chased by Afeelyated, Baze peeked under his left arm to check his competition before going to the whip briefly in the stretch. 
He will try to break the record Friday, with scheduled mounts in seven races at the 72-year-old track where Seabiscuit ran. 
Red Sox sign Japanesereliever OkaJima 
BOSTON -The Red Sox agreed to a contract with a Japanese pitcher ­no, not that one. 
In the midst of negotiations with potential ace Daisuke Matsuzaka, the Red Sox agreed Thursday to a $2.5 million, two-year contract with left­handed reliever Hideki Okajima, a deal that includes a $1.7 5 million team option for 2009. 
The Red Sox also moved closer to signing free agent outfielder J.D. Drew. The sides are in the drafting stages of a $70 million, five-year contract that is ­likely to announced next week, a per­son familiar with the talks said on con­dition of anonymity because the deal has not been finalized. 
Boston general manager Theo Epstein envisions Okajima as a setup man and occasional specialist against lefty batters. 
"He's going be a valuable member of our bullpen," said Epstein.

Bengals top Ravens on Houshmandzadeh TD 
Cincinnati's win means AFC North title is still in contention; Bengals defense looks significantly improved 
Associated Press 

CINCINNATI -Maybe T.J. Houshmandzadeh is right after all. 
Houshmandzadeh caught a 40-yard touchdown pass on a flea-flicker that caught Baltimore off-guard, spark­ing Cincinnati to a 13-7 vic­tory Thursday night that kept the AFC North title up for grabs. 
A surprisingly stout Bengals defense had a lot to do with it. 
Coming off a 30-0 win in Cleveland, one of the NFL's lowest-ranked defenses held Baltimore scoreless until Steve McNair threw a 36-yard touch'down pass to Derrick Mason with 1:01 to play. No Cincinnati defense had ever gone seven quar­ters without allowing a point. 
With a chance to win the AFC North title outright, Baltimore's offense came apart, crossing midfield only once in the first three quarters. 
Keiwan Ratliff clinched it by recovering the onside kick after Baltimore's only score. 
All of it supported Houshmandzadeh 's inain point: Right now, Cincinnati (7 -5) just might be the bet­ter team. 
After the Ravens won 26­20 on Nov. 5, the long­haired receiver insisted that everyone knows the Bengals are better. He repeated it again this week, getting a rise out of some of the Ravens. Safety Ed Reed suggested that Houshmandzadeh should just shut up. 
-
The Ravens were in no position to argue after Houshmandzadeh caught 10 passes for a season-high 106 yards, including the trick-play touchdown that made it 13-0 early in the 
second half and allowed the defense to dig in on a rainy night. 
The Bengals don't usually resort to trick plays _ their offense has enough firepow­er to beat teams straight­up. They did something dif­ferent against one of the league's nastiest defenses. 
On their first drive of the second half, Palmer handed off to Rudi Johnson, who then lateralled the ball back to quarterback. Houshmandzadeh was well beyond the coverage when Palmer let fly with the flea­flicker pass. 
Reed was the only player close to Houshmandzadeh when he caught the ball at the 12 and ran untouched into the end zone.

SEC commissioner balances conference with BCS 
Slive maintains that role with BCS is not a conflict of interests 
Associated Press NEW YORK As Southeastern Conference commissioner, Mike Slive's job is to be an advocate for his members at bowl time. He believes being Bowl Championship Series coordi­nator does not change that. The SEC is in prime posi­tion to get two teams in the BCS when the pairings are released Sunday. The winner of the SEC championship game between Arkansas and Florida on Saturday receives an automatic bid. LSU was fifth in the last BCS standings, right behind Florida, and will be in the mix for an at-large berth in one of the five big-money bowls. Slive said all commission­ers have a responsibility to promote their teams to bowl officials. "As commissioners, we talk with bowls about our teams, and we talk about how good we think they are and we know they are," Slive said Wednesday during a telecon­ference. "We talk about the fan base. I talk about the fact in the SEC that we had over 6.8 million people to 
our games this past year, and we just wanted to make sure that everyone knows all there is to know about the Southeastern Conference." 
The SEC champ will play in the Sugar Bowl, unless Florida can catch some breaks and reach the nation­al title game. LSU could be looking at a Rose Bowl bid. 
"I think you advocate as a commissioner, and as a BCS coordinator, my roles is to make sure that the system works properly, fairly and equitably," Slive said. 
Slive reiterated he's open to discuss changes in the current BCS systems, includ­ing the plus-one model which would set the championship game after the big four bowl games are played. 
In the current system, the top two teams after the regu­lar season meet in the BCS championship game. 
For the first time this sea­son five BCS games will be played instead of four. The championship game will be played on Jan. 8 in Glendale, Ariz., about a week after the Fiesta, Sugar, Rose and Orange bowls are played. 
Slive also said that the BCS should not influence. a con­ference's decision whether to play a league championship game. Of the original six BCS conferences, the SEC, Big 12 and Atlantic Coast championship game. So we have to put together our pri­orities and obviously we would love to win the nation­al championship, but we cer­tainly value and hold highly our (championship) game."

Conference play title games, adding an extra difficult game to their schedules. The Pac-1 0, Big Ten and Big East do not. 
"One of the premises of the BCS is that every conference has the right to figure out how it wants to determine its champion," he said. "We (in the SEC) enjoy a champi­onship game and we can't dictate to any other league that they have to have a

Bruins are USC's only title barrier 
Georgia Tech takes on Wake Forest in ACC Championship game 

Associated Press 

LOS ANGELES -The UCLA Bruins trudged off the Coliseum field following a 66-19 loss to Southern California last year with a feeling they'll always remember. 
And Bruins center Robert Chai believes that's a good thing. 
"I remember thinking as I stood in the tunnel, 'I don't ever want to feel this again,"' Chai said. "I don't want anyone on this team to forget what that felt like." 
The outcome might have been expected, but the margin of vic­tory wasn't. USC entered with an 11-0 record and UCLA was 9-1.

When the teams meet Saturday at the Rose Bowl, the Bruins will be shooting for their first win over their crosstown rivals since 1998. "Very frustrating.

Now that it's UCLA week, though, Carroll and his players are free to speak on the signifi­cance of playing the Bruins.

Win or lose, UCLA (6-5, 4-4) will oppose Florida State in the Emerald Bowl on Dec. 27 in San Francisco. 
The Trojans have a 41-27-7 record in the series that dates back to 1929, when they beat the Bruins 76-0. UCLA won eight straight before USC began its current seven-game winning streak. 
Some of the wildest games have been played at the Rose Bowl, where UCLA has played its home games since 1982. Before that, the teams shared the Coliseum. 
UCLA won a 20-19 decision in the first game the teams played at the Rose Bowl when the Trojans failed on a 2-point con­version in the final seconds. USC's Todd Marinovich threw a touchdown pass in the final minute to give his team a 45-42 victory in 1990.

Last week, the senior looked like a raw freshman in the 48th start of his career, completing just 6-of-22 passes for 42 yards in a 15-12 loss to Georgia Tech's most bitter rival. As if that was­n't bad enough, he was inter­cepted twice and coughed up a fumble that was returned for Georgia's first touchdown. 
"Reggie! Reggie! Reggie!" the Georgia crowd chanted derisive­ly. 
But Ball has been through this sort of thing before during an up-and-down career. As a fresh­man, he was picked off three times in a blowout loss to lowly Duke -the Blue Devils' first ACC win in four years -but h~ rebounded the following week with three touchdown passes to beat North Carolina. 
In 2004, Ball nearly lost his starting job when he completed just 20-of-54 with six intercep­tions in back-to-hack losses to North Carolina and Miami. He played much better in the next game, an upset win over Maryland, and coach Chan Gailey dismissed any thought of making a change. 
Ball's maddening inconsisten­cy stretched all the way to his senior season.

Belles look to shake off loss to Hope against Vikings 
Team faces second of five contests on road 
By BILL BRINK 
Sports Writer 
Fresh off a 67-42 loss to Hope in its first conference game, Saint Mary's will try to regroup in its second of five games on the road against North Park tonight. 
The Belles continued to be hampered by turnovers, losing possession 29 times against Hope. The youth of the team factored into the prevalence of turnovers, said head coach Jennifer Henley, but it was not the only culprit. 
"We need to do a better job of recognizing defense before passing," she said. 
The Belles face a tough Viking offense led by senior guards Laura Mount and Lauren Martin. Martin shoots a fiery 60 percent from three-point range, and Mount leads the team in scoring with 16.7 
points per game. Stopping them will be a challenge. 
"We need to contain Martin Friday night," Henley said. "She is a very good shooter. We will have to find her in transi­tion and make her work for every shot." 
The Belles are up to the task, however. The Saint Mary's defense held Hope junior guard Jordan Boles -who has shot 
43.2 percent from the field on the season -to just six points on 3-of-11 shooting. 
"Boles is a great player. We

the game will be a shootout. Saint Mary's must keep up on offense as well. 
"We always want to look to score in transition and have that up tempo style of basket­ball," Henley said. "We will rely on our defense and rebounding to take care of Martin, Mount and (junior for­ward Evie] Peterson."

But this season the No. 14 Nanooks (6-2-4, 4-1-3 CCHA) will encounter a bigger and vastly improved Irish team when they return to South Bend to play No. 5 Notre Dame (10-3-1, 5-2-1 CCHA) this weekend in the first two of four games between the teams. 
Alaska's size and ability to control the puck better than an undersized Irish team in the playoff series forced Irish coach Jeff Jackson to institute a heavy offseason strength program. 
"Alaska was the one that really forced us to add some girth on our team," Jackson said. "Our guys added a lot of weight, strength and a big part of that was due to the fact that Alaska is not the only team that's big. Lake Superior is a big, physical team and Ferris State has some big guys on their team. You run across VeNard said. "They're a little more sore now. Obviously there were mistakes made on the weekend, so we paid for them." 
The Irish must improve on scoring five-on-five and receive significant contribu­tions from multiple forward lines each night, Jackson said, but also to maintain the stellar defense -first in the nation with 1.36 goals allowed per game -that has launched the team into the national spot­light. 
"Part of that is not just from a defensive perspective. part of that is from we're doing a much better job possessing the puck," Jackson said. "And that's the best defense of all, when you're not throwing the puck away -when you're cycling and controlling the tempo of the game."

Knelsen is also 17 years old, the second youngest player in college hockey. 
"They do a real nice job of recruiting in my opinion," Jackson said. "They've got some talented players on their team and adding another offensive skilled player is no different than us."

Even with these two fresh­men, the Wolverines have a veteran-heavy lineup that returns all five starters from last season as well as 10 letter winners. But McGraw said Notre Dame's combination of veterans and freshmen will also be effective in Ann Arbor.

Gone to Carolina 
Irish travel -south for last two games of the NCAA College Cup 
By CHRIS KHOREY Associate Sports Editor 

No. 1 Notre Dame is 24-0-1 this season. 
The Irish have outscored their opponents 82-8 and recorded 18 shutouts, includ­ing not allowing a goal in their last three tournament games. 
Right now, however, none of that matters. 
Notre Dame will travel to Cary, N.C., for a College Cup semifinal matchup with No. 5 Florida State 6:30 p.m. today at SAS Soccer Park. 
If the Irish get past the Seminoles, they will take on the winner of No. 3 UCLA and co-No. 1 North Carolina for a chance to reach the one goal Notre Dame has focused on since August -the national championship.

NDhopes to get first road -win 
McGraw has team ready for Ann Arbor 
By JAY FITZPATRICK 
Sports Writer 

After going 0-2 with 53.5 points per game in its first two road matchups this season, Notre Dame is ready to turn this trend around tonight at Michigan. 
The Irish (4-2) are coming off a big win against Richmond Tuesday night, while the Wolverines (5-2) look much improved after winning only four games all of last season. 
"They're off to their best start in a long time," McGraw said. "They've got a new sixth player -[freshman center Krista] Phillips -who's really changing the game for them." 
Phillips has been able to take over games despite only

ND plays No. 19 Maryland this weekend 
By BOB GRIFFIN Sports Writer 

Notre Dame faces the biggest challenge of its young season Sunday when it trav­els to the Verizon Center in Washington, D.C. to play No. 19 Maryland in the BB&T Classic. 
Maryland (7 -0) has already defeated three major confer­ence schools this season with wins over Michigan State, St. John's and Illinois. Irish coach Mike Brey said Wednesday following Notre 
,-Dame's 90-45 win over Winston-Salem State that the Terrapins could be one of the hottest teams in the country. "We have a great opportu­nity against Maryland, the,y're a hell of a basketball team," Brey said. "They're men, they're old, they've [been] 
around and they're confident. But we've played well in that place down there, I'm still referring to it as the MCI Center." 
Brey said Maryland is pro­ductive getting inside against its opponents, making it important that Notre Dame doesn't relax on defense when it moves from man-to­man sets into two-three zones. 
"They get into your paint on cuts, they get into your paint on drives, they get into your paint on offensive rebounds," Brey said. "That theme that we talked about from the first week of practice as a point of emphasis will really be tested against this group on Sunday." 
Notre Dame guard Colin Falls said Wednesday that

Team tries to bear N anooks 
No. 16 Alaska swept the Irish during last trip to South Bend 
By KYLE CASSILY Sports Writer 
In the Inuit language a nanook is a polar bear, but in Inuit mythology Nanook was the master of bears -the power that determined if hunters deserved success in the pursuit of their prey, and a fitting nickname for the team that out-powered Notre Dame last season. 
The Nanooks of the University of Alaska played the role of their mythological forebear last year and decid­ed that Notre Dame did not deserve to move on to the sec­ond round of the 2006 CCHA playoffs, sweeping the Irish out in a first round series at the Joyce Center.
