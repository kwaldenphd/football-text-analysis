City elections involve student issues 
Mayoral, Common Council candidates' platforms include stances on crime rates and safety 
By KAITLYNN RIELY Assistant News Editor . 
Most of the approximately 80 percent of Notre Dame students that live on campus will not be able to vote in the local South Bend primary election Nov. 6, but Student Senate community relations chair Colin Feehan thinks the recent debate over the Common Council's party ordinance may have piqued student interest in the upcoming Common Council and mayoral elections, regardless of students' eligi­bility. 
When Feehan worked at a student government event 
geared toward getting stu­dents living off campus regis­tered to vote a few weeks ago, the turnout was disap­pointing, he said. He said he thinks student turnout on Nov. 6 will be "modest." 
"I think student interest in these elections has definitely increased, especially with all the issues with the ordinance this summer," he said. "That being said, I think it's proba­bly not at a level where it should be. Hopefully, in the coming year, or years, we can increase student civic engagement in local issues." 
The shooting of two stu­dents outside local pub Club 23 in August and frequent break-ins of students' houses 
and cars off campus may also be drawing student interest to the election, Feehan said, with many can­didates promising to drive down crime rates. 
"I think, as of late, first and foremost, students are concerned about crime and safety," he said. 
Crime rates and safety for city residents is something candidates for mayor and for the Common Council posi­tions are worried about as well. 
Current Democratic Mayor Stephen Luecke is running against Republican Juan Manigault and Green party write-in candidate Tom Brown. 
Luecke has been mayor of South Bend since 1997 and is running for his fourth term. 
~·we've built, I think, a great relationship with the University and have had excellent communications, in particular, with the last two student body presidents working on relations that affect Notre Dame and South Bend," he said. 
Luecke pointed to the start of construction on Eddy Street Commons and the freshman tours of South Bend that began two years ago.

ND average time to Ph.D. 6.1 years 
Duration two years less than national average, attributed to program policies 
ByJENN METZ Assistant News Editor 
Notre Dame's 1,300 doc­toral students at The Graduate School complete their degrees in an aver­age of 6.1 years, two years less than the national average of 8.2 years, according to the National Science Foundation. 
Terry Akai, the senior associate dean of The Graduate School, said Notre Dame's policies, such as requiring disserta-· tion topic approvals within a certain time frame, are the major mechanisms keeping the time reason­able. 
"We want them gainfully employed. We use carrots and sticks to push them out the door," he said. 
Doctoral students in 20 programs make up more than two thirds of The Graduate School popula­tion, which totals about 1 ,800. The students who are not on the path to a Ph.D. are either enrolled in Masters-only programs or working toward Masters degrees in Ph.D. programs.

Ratnadan fast ends Saturday 
Campus Minstry helps Muslims practicefaith 
By JOSEPH MCMAHON News Writer 

As the month of Ramadan draws to a close this Saturday, followers of the faith celebrate the end of fasting, while at Notre Dame, the Muslim commu­nity expressed gratitude to Campus Ministry for creat­ing a welcoming environ­ment, especially during the holy month. 
Although the estimated statistics say there are only around 30 Muslim under­graduates and graduates at the University, Campus Ministry has gone to great lengths to make sure they are able to practice their faith at Notre Dame. 
Priscilla Wong, assistant director administrator and campus coordinator at Campus Ministry, serves as a special advisor to the Muslim Students Association (MSA). 
"We are trying to provide support and hospitality to all our students regardless of their different faiths and traditions," she said. "We want to make sure they can practice their faith in a comfortable environment. It is about supporting and respecting students so that they can have a meaningful growing experience at Notre Dame." 
As it is an Islamic tradi­tion to wash before prayer,

Author speaks on capitalistic systems 
Novak describes ideal economic institution 
By DAVIS RHORER, Jr. 
News Writer 

Truth and liberation of the human spirit are at the core of modern capitalistic systems Michael Novak, author of Business as a Calling, said Thursday. 
Novak placed considerable importance on the idea of cari­tas, or the interaction of God's love and the Trinity in the world through other people, as a principle ideal figuring in the tenets of capitalism. 
"The great generator of wealth is discovery and inven­tion." Novak said, identifying the key component of freedom that is in both caritas and capi­talism. 
"The human person is the originating source of human action," he said, emphasizing the idea of protecting the right to initiative. 
Novak recognized the impor­tance of the individual to the wealth of nations as a compo­nent to a healthy economic sys-

Adventures in 

live TV 
I got a phone call on Tuesday from ESPN. 
They told me they were looking fi1r some­one to debate a Boston College student on "First Take" on Thursday. 
People who know me know I'm not much of a trash t.alker. but I agreed. Who could turn down a chance to be on live national televi­sion'? 
The producer, Mr. Gabriel Goodman, told me that my Boston College Chris Khorey counterpart was Jell'Weinstnin. Sports Editor sporl'i mlitor of' Th1~ lleighl'>, Boston College's student newspaper. Goodman also told me that this debate would not be about Xs and Os. 
"This is time for some good, old-lk'ihioned snuu:k talk," he said. 
We filnwd live at WNDU. llinmd out that my only contad with Weinstein and the host, Jay Crawfiml, would be from the headphone in my right ear. I wouldn't be able to sne tlwm. Wlwn I put the headphone on, the audio from "First Take" started playing. 
A f(~w minutes later, Goodman interTupted to say our sehTJnent was about to begin and added, "The other kid said he's ready to kick your ass." 
I lward some musk, and then Crawfiwd talking. Ill~ IL'iked me a question -Is Boston College the most overrated team in ((JOtball'? 
I had been warrwd this question would come up. And the horwst answer is that I do fi~nl BC is overrated-although not horribly so. 
So I said basically that, only I had been told I WIL'i debating and I most certainly did not want to have my IL'iS kicked. I began "obvi­ously they'rp overrated, they haven't played anybody!" I WIL'> doing my host Tony Kornheisnr impression. 
Tho next question went to .Jell"-Is Charlie Weis overrated'! This is how Jell' began-"I have a lot of rnspPct f(w Charlie Weis." 
Uh oh. Now IIHt likn a jerk. Jell'w<L'>n't trying to kick my IL'>S at all. lie WIL'i being nice. 
I WIL'i a'iked about tlw infamous Letter to the Editor by Bob Grillin and I defimded his position-rushing the field during a poor season because we beat an opponent that we defeat eonsistently when we'rn good just rninlhrees that we're bad and gives the oppo­nent status that tlwy didn't earn during the game. 
Then I wa-; IL'.;ked about if studenl-; at Notre I>ame consider Boston College a "safety school." I knew this question W<L'i corning­Goodman had talked to me about it. lie asked nm to find a "Backup College" T-shirt and show it on air. So I IL'iked one of our sports writnrs li1r his. and I showed it to the world. 
All through this, .Jell' continued to be nice. 
I ((~It like more and more of a jerk. but what eould I do'? I wa-;n 't about to sell out my frim1d Bob Griflin or lie and deny that a lot of' Notrn Dame studenl'> were admitted to Boston College a<; wnll. 
Aller hnaring me describe the shirt (I can only a-;sume he couldn't see me either), .Jell' said ''I'm very proud of' the degree I'm going to get from Boston College." 
I told him I would bn too. After all, Boston Collegn is a great school. 
So we ended on that positivll note. But the darnagt~ wa-; already done. Jelfwa'i eondlia­tory and friendly, and I came out swinging and making a ti10l out of mysell'. 
Jell' kicked my a<;s, and he hadn't even been trying to.

Condom experts told that size matters 
SEOGWIPO, South Korea -As the world's top con­dom experts convene this week to update interna­tional standards, one American entrepreneur has a simple message: Size matters. It's shaking up an industry that has generally taken a one-size-fits-all approach. 
Frank Sadlo, founder of' TheyFit, which makes what he claims are the world's first custom-fit condoms, is pushing for updated standards to allow greater variation in con­dom size. 

It's not just about well­endowed men in cramped prophylactic quarters, Sadlo told a meeting Thursday of' delegates from 21 countries under the Geneva-based International Organization for Standardization. 
When given a choice, he said many men prefer con­doms smaller than the standard minimum 6.3 inches long, with more than half ordering those less than 5.12 inches.

SMC senior sits on Board of Trustees 
By LIZ HARTER News Writer 
Ead1 ynar, the Saint Mary's Board of Trustees chooses onP senior to serve as the studnnt trustne. This year, thn Board chose political sci­enen major Cate Cetta after she applied for the position and went through a series of intervir,ws. 
As student trustee, Cetta is required to attend the quar­terly Board of Trustees meet­ings that take place on cam­pus throughout the year. 
"I am responsible for bring­ing the voice of the students to the Board," Cetta said. "[I am also responsible for] keeping a general awareness of students feelings on the happenings of Saint Mary's." 
Cetta also attended the Board's retreat on campus in June, though this weekend's session will be her first offi­cia! meeting. 
Board meetings are held in June, October, February and April, meaning Cetta will serve as the student trustee for two more meetings until a new one is elected. 
Cetta also feels that she will be able to impact the Saint Mary's community in her position with the Board, which will fulfill a goal she set for herself during her first year on campus. 
"From the moment arrived on campus freshman year, I knew I wanted to give back to Saint Mary's," she said. 
This position is a great way to accomplish that, Cetta said. 
"The student trustee posi­tion is the perfect opportuni­ty to impact the lives of cur­rent and future Saint Mary's women, and I am excited to do my part," she said.

Degrees 
continued from page 1 
Graduatn School, with 61 per­
cent of ineoming Ph.D. stud1mts 
choosing to enter one of the two 
areas. About 25 percllnt of 
Enrollments in each l'illld are 
Lmsnd on the number ol' faculty 
in each dnpartnwnt and on 
available funding, which is "sort 
of a limiter," i\kai said. 
"Most Ph .D. students in good 
schools are supported by thn 
institution in some way, either 
by assistantships, internal and 
external fellowships or research 
grants advisors have," he said. 
Doctoral students are guaran­
teed varying degrees of funding 
for at least four years if' they 
rnmain in good academic stand­
ing. Usually students receive 
funding for five years, and, 
depending on resources, can 
receive funding in their sixth 
year, Akai said. 
"For most students, they can 
count. on four to six years of 
f'inancial support from the 
University, depending on the 
discipline," he said. 
More than 85 percent of' Notre 
Dame graduate students 
received stipends during the 
2006-7 academic year. 
The base stipend for a new 
graduate student is $16,000 for 
nine months. For those students 
who arc on prestigious national 
fellowships or who are in com­
petitive programs, that stipend 
can be as much as $30,000 for 
12 months. 
"Our stipnnd is not out of line for our location," i\kai said. "But I'm sure a graduate stu­dent would want to see more." 
Most students receive between $1,700-2,500 a month in a stipend to cover living expenses, in addition to tuition scholar­ships, Akai said. 
The Graduate School's Web site says that graduate students "generally receive full-tuition scholarships for the duration of their graduate studies." 
According to The Graduate School, approximately 37 per­cent of stipends were from external sources, such as grants, and about 15 percent were from endowments. 
"In terms of relative value, it depends on how people see things," i\kai said. "At Ivy League schools, the stipend is a little bit higher, but their cost of living is very high .... We're in a relatively cheap part of the U.S." 
Thtl National Science Foundation report said about 50 percent of doctoral candidates drop out of their programs. 
The attrition rate at Notre Dame is slightly less than 40 percent, i\kai said. Students drop out of their Ph.D. pro­grams, which are open-ended research degrees, for various reasons. 
"Some students come into the Ph.D. without a dear reason for doing so," he said. "At some point along the Ph.D. path, stu­dents run out of coursework and Iiave to start generating their own new work." 
Though some programs include researeh and course­work simultaneously from the beginning, many doctoral stu­dents must complete about two to thren years of coursework before starting their individual research, which includes pro­posing a dissertation subject and having it approved by the department. 
The unstructured research phase of the doctoral path is where many students fall off course, Akai said. 
"Some people spend one or two years literally doing noth­ing," he said. "Here, what we've 

done, is try to put some policies 
in place that promotes people 
going through the system." 

In order to keep students on 
traek, different departments 
have different policies about 
advisor-student meetings and 
departmental annual reviews, 
Akai said. 

"Some departments have 
rather substantial annual 
roviews of graduate students, 
others do not," he said. " ... 
Some advisors will push stu­
dnnts, some will not, it depends 
on the personal style of the 
advisor." 

lie cited non-academic rea­
sons like general life issues, 
relationship issues, jobs and dis­
engagement from research top­
ics as others contributing to stu­
dent attrition. 

"I would say more people 
drop out of Ph.D. programs for 
non-academic reasons," he said. 
In some disciplines, like engi­
neering, there is a lucrative job 
market for applicants with 
Masters degrees, he said. 

With about half of doctoral 
students dropping out and oth­
ers taking many years to com­
plete their degrees, it raises the 
question, Akai said, of whether 
or not schools are wasting 
money. 

"Maybe, maybe not," he said. "If students go out and get jobs that reflect well on the University anyway, perhaps not. Also, some of those leaving without the Ph.D. may have contributed to the research pro­gram before leaving." 
Some schools have suggested shortening or limiting doctoral students' assistantships to help them devote more time to their d(lgrees. 
That, Akai said, is a simplistic solution. 
"Most Ph.D. £candidates] that go into the academic world will go to small universities or col­leges where teaching is impor­tant," he said. "To eut them off from teaching takes away valu­able job experience." 
At Notre Dame, doctoral stu­dents' teaching load is limited, Akai said. Most teaching assis­tants work less than 15 hours a week. A Graduate School policy limits teaching assistant work to 17 1/2 hours a week. 
The National Science Foundation reported the aver­age age for a doctoral graduate is 33. At Notre Dame, most stu­dents enter the graduate school right after receiving their Bachelor's degree. 
The exception is theology, a department where students cannot enter a Ph.D. program without a solid Masters first, Akai said.  
On average, the Notre Dame doetoral graduate is between 29 and 30. 
"Obviously, this is the prime time of life for relationships," Akai said. "It's part of the pack­age that leads to some of the attrition." 
The University awarded 161 doctorates during the 2006-7 academic year and admitted 282 new doctoral students. 
Women, who were accepted to The Graduate School before the University itself became co-edu­cational. make up 42 percent of thn incoming graduate students. Nearly 30 percent of graduate students are international. Of the American students at The Graduate School, 15 percent are raeial minorities. 
Graduate programs began at the University in 1918, Akai said, but The Graduate School as its own entity was instituted in 1944. It was not until 1990 that The Graduate School received its own dean.

Egyptian plane on fire over Turkey 
ISTANBUL. Turkey -An Egyptian plane car­rying 163 people to Warsaw caught fire Thursday after making an emergency landing at Istanbul's international airport, a govern­ment official said. One passenger was slightly injured. 
The lire in the Egyptian plane was extin­guished, and there was no loss of life, said the ollicial at the state agency in charge of airports. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not allowed to talk to the media. 
The plane was forced to land in Istanbul due to a technical problem, but its landing gear failed to work properly. The aircraft landed on its fuselage, starting a fire, the official said. 
There were 156 passengers and seven crew members aboard, and one of the passengers was slightly injured, he said. 
Bomb explodes at shrine, 2 dead 
NEW DELHI -A bomb exploded at a famous Muslim shrine in northern India on Thursday, killing at least two people and wounding 17 others ahead of one of the holiest days on the Muslim calendar, police said. 
The blast at the shrine of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti. a 12th century Sufi Muslim saint, took place just after dusk as hundreds of men and women broke the daily fasts they observe during the holy month of Hamad an. 
The explosion appeared to have been caused by a small bomb packed inside a lunch box, said S. Sengthir, police superin­tendent in Ajmer, where the shrine is locat­!HI. 
Ajmer's top official, Naveen Mahajan, said at least two people had been killed and 17 wounded.

Trial wraps up in boot camp death case 
PANAMA CITY, Fla. -A 14-year-old boy died because seven juvenile boot camp guards and a nurse lacked good judgment and decided to ·use force against him rather than calling for medical help, a prosecutor told jurors in closing argu­ments Friday. 
Mike Sinacore said the eight defendants ignored common sense in the 30-minute video­taped altercation with Martin Lee Anderson in January 2006. The guards repeatedly hit, kneed and dragged the limp boy around after he col­lapsed while running laps. The nurse stood by watching. 
'This case i.<; about the failure of caregivers to provide Martin Lee Anderson with the care that any prudent person would deem necessary and essential to the well being of a child," Sinacore said.

SHELBYVILLE, Ind. -A pair of wheels came off a semitrailer and fatally struck a police officer who was standing along a cen­tral Indiana highway, authorities said. 
Sgt. Gary Henderson was assisting another officer with the stop of a stolen ear on an Interstate 7 4 entrance ramp when the set of rear dual wheels came off the passing truck about 11:30 p.m. Wednesday, police said. 
Investigators were trying to determine what caused the wheels to come off the truck as it changed lanes to avoid the ears on the shoulder at the interchange with Indiana 44 about 25 miles southeast of Indianapolis.

U.N. scolds government's actions 
International community encourages release ofestimated 6,000 people seized in demonstrations 
Associated Press 
YANGON, Myanmar ­Guards at Myanmar's deten­tion centers beat, kicked and slashed protesters rounded up during the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstra­tions, sometimes leaving their victims to die of their injuries, a dissident group said Thursday. 
At the United Nations, meanwhile, the Security Council said it "strongly deplores" the violent crack­down by Myanmar's military rulers and called for a "gen­uine dialogue" between the government and the pro­democracy opposition. 
At least a dozen freed pris­oners described brutal treat­ment at detention centers, including one who said "dozens" of detainees were killed, according to the Democratic Voice of Burma, a Norway-based short-wave radio station and Web site run by dissident journalists. 
Myanmar's repressive mili­tary junta has said 10 people were killed and nearly 2,100 arrested in last month's demonstrations, with 700 later released. Diplomats and dissidents say the death toll is likely much higher and up to 6,000 people were seized.

IN BRIEF 

Loan companies misleading students 
ALBANY, N.Y. -The state of New York has subpoenaed 33 companies and lenders who market edueation loans directly to college stu­dents in a widening of his investigation of deceptive tactics in the industry. 
After launching a probe of college-sponsored lending, state Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said Thursday he is now investigating independent lenders and marketers who solic­it business from students and families, often implying they are part of the federal govern­ment or affiliated with a college. 
"This is a new front," he said. A pitch made by telephone, broadcast ads, online ads, mail and direct sales can "sound like it's coming from the federal government. It will look like it's coming from the federal government and it's, we believe, a deceptive practice. And it's a very big industry." 
Investigators will try to determine if con­sumers paid higher interest rates or fees to the companies because of their practices, said Cuomo spokeswoman Rashmi Vasisht. 
Dollar and deficit in the decline 
WASHINGTON -The falling dollar led more foreigners to buy American in August, helping to push the trade deficit down to tlw lownst point in sevnn months. That was weleome news for the Bush administration as it tries to deal with a Congress unhappy over hugn trade imbalances and 3 million lost manufacturing jobs. 
PrnsidPnt Bush also got good news Thursday on his other deficit headache. Tlw budgPt deficit declined in 2007 to the lownst level in five years, dropping to $162.R billion, an $85 billion improvement over 2006. 
Bush said the declining budget defieit was a sign that his economic strategy of cutting taxes to grow the economy was working. But Democrats pointed to the soaring national debt under Bush as evidence of his fiscal irresponsibility.

Shipvvreck reveals clues to Florida's colony past

PENSACOlA. Fla.-In 1559. a hurricane plunged as many as seven Spanish sailing vessels to the bottom of Pensacola Bay, hampering nxplomr I>on Tristan de Luna's attempt to eolonizo this soction of tlw Florida Panhandle. 
Almost 500 years later and 15 years aftor the first ship was fimnd, anotlwr has bonn discov­ered. helping archaeologists unlock secrnts to Florida's Spanish past. The colony at the site of prostmt-day Pensacola was abandoned in 1561, and no 100 people, among them mem­bors of the public, who gathered on land about a half mile from the shipwrm:k. 
"It's an amazing site," said (;rngory D. Cook, a University of West Florida nautical archaeolo­gist. 
Test excavations suggest about 60 to 66 feet of preserved hull from a small to medium-size ves­sel, he said. 
The ship would likely have been built a few years before 1559, said I>r. Roger C. Smith, the state's underwater archaeologist.

Thn ship apparently held food stocks and other supplies for the colonization campaign, a careful­ly planned expedition financed by the Spanish crown. 
Af'tnr the storm, only three ships were still afloat, including two small barks and the expedi­tion's only caravel.

School bans Confederate flag 
Attack on minority students called 'disturbing and repulsive' 
Associated Press 
LITITZ, Pa. -For years, a clique of high school students in this prosperous and over­whelmingly white borough have worn clothes adorned with Confederate flags and parked their pickups in a sec­tion of the school parking lot known as "redneck row." 
The display, some parents of minority students say, was just one symptom of festering racism that school officials ignored until animosities boiled over last week. 
That's when three white 16­year-old students allegedly yelled racial slurs and threw paper wads at minority stu­dents outside the 1,600-stu­dent Warwick High School. 
School officials vowed to dis­cipline the three students, tighten security and ban Confederate flags on school property. On Wednesday, police charged the three with disorderly conduct. 
The "disturbing and repul­sive" Oct. 3 confrontation was a "wake-up call" for Warwick High School, said Superintendent John George. "Perhaps we were lulled into a false sense that our school district was immune to racism and bigotry," he said. 
Some students suspect the perpetrators were trying to imitate white students in Jena, La., who fanned racial ten­sions last year by hanging nooses from a tree outside a high school. 
Police Chief William Sease said there's no evidence the suspects were influenced by the Jena case. 
"What is racial intimidation? It's trying to have power over someone else," Sease said. "I think that's their motivation." 
Erasmo Cora Jr., a Puerto Rican native whose 14-year­old son, Erik, was among the victims, said the school should expel all of the roughly dozen students who allegndly engaged in raeist behavior. 
''I'm not going to put up with it -my kid should have never went through this," Cora said. "Either they all get out, or we're just going to have to make a bigger issue of it." 
The confrontation comes as a major disappointment to Cora. He moved his family from nearby Lancaster about a year ago, expecting his son to receive a better education than he could in Lancaster's troubled schools. 
Erik Cora, a freshman, said he was hanging out by the flagpole with two boys -one black and one biraeial ­when the taunting occurred before the start of school. It broke up when the morning bell rang, but it also spawned rumors that some students planned to bring guns to school later in the wellk and start riots.

NY AG subpoenas 33 lenders in loan probe 
Associated Press 
ALBANY. N.Y. -The state of New York has subpoenaed 33 companies and lenders who market education loans directly to college students in a widen­ing of his investigation of deceptive tactics in the indus­try. 
After launching a probe of college-spon­sored lending, practices, said Cuomo spokes­woman Rashmi Vasisht. 
"We know that many of these companies were offering rates which were higher than rates you could have gotten in the marketplace," Cuomo said. He had no specific rates, but said even a couple of percentage points difference could cost a borrower thousands of dollars 
over the life of a 
loan.

14-year-old dies at bootcamp 
Associated Press 
PANAMA CITY, Fla. --A 14­year-old boy died because seven juvenile boot camp guards and a nursn lae.ked good judgment and decided to use !'oren against him rather than call filr medical help, a prosecutor said in closing argument<; Thursday beforn the ca<;e went to the jury. 
Attorneys !'or the eight defen­dants said Martin Lee Anderson's death was the unavoidable consequence of his genetic blood disorder and alleged that the manslaughter charges were part of a "twisted agenda" by former Gov. Jeb Bush and others who were under fire from civil rights groups. · 
A prosecutor played segment<; of a 30-minute video showing the guards repeatedly slamming Anderson on the ground, drag­ging his limp body around the boot camp exercise yard and hit­ting him. 
The video, prosecutor Scott Harmon said, shows jurors what they need to know about the actions of the eight defendant'>. 

"They are manhandling this kid who is basically fluid in their hands," !Iarmon said. "You may not hear anything mming out of that video sound-wise. but that video is screaming to you in a loud, dear voice; it is telling you that thesn defendants killed Martin Lee Anderson." 
Anderson died because the guards crossed a line, he said. 
"They went way too far, fur­ther than they had ever gone befi1re. They sufl'oeatnd Martin And orson," Harmon said. 
He pointed to omissions in reports compiled by the dnl'en­dants after the inddent. 
"The cover-up started immndi­ately," Harmon said. 'This litbri­cation, this cover-up begins, and it continues all the way until this week in front of you." 
The defendants face as many a<; :{0 years in prison if convicted ol' aggravated manslaughter of a child. Jurors could decide to acquit them of manslaughter but convict them of lesser charges including child neglect or culpa­ble negligence.

Security videos to be revievved in noose case 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK -The graduate school where a noose was found on the door of a black professor agreed Thursday to turn over security videotape, but police were dismayed that they had to get a subpoena to acquire the evidence. 
Police claim that Teachers College -Columbia University's graduate school of education ­had agreed to give up the tape without a court order Wednesday. New York Police Department spokesman Paul Browne said police officials were "disappointed and sur­prised" by the delay in a case that rocked the Ivy League campus. 
Teaehers College spokes­woman Diane Dobry said the school wanted to work in "the spirit of cooperation" with police, but privacy laws required it to demand a court order. Since a subpoena was obtained, "We are giving them everything," she said. 
Investigators plan to review several hours of tape from up to seven digital security eameras in and around the building where the noose was discov­ered early Tuesday morning on the doorknob of the offiee of Madonna Constantine, Browne said.

Cold medicines recalled 
Major drug makers warn of potential health risks to infants 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Drug mak­ers on Thursday voluntarily pulled children's cold medicines off the market less than two weeks after the government warned of potential health risks to infants. 
Over-the-eounter medications aimed at children under the age 
of two are b e i n g removed from store shelves because of rare instances of parents overdosing young chil­dren, a trade group that represents the drugs' manufactur­ers said. The group said parents should no longer admin­
"These medications were never designed to cure colds buy only to treat cold symptoms and in children under two there was a little evidence they were effective anyway." 
Catherine Tom-Revzon pediatric pharmacist Children's Hospital New York 

ister these medieations. 
The Consumer Healthcare Products Association said last month it agreed with govern­ment officials that use of the drugs should be restricted, but had previously stopped short of pulling the produets from the market. 
Cold medicines being with­drawn inelude: Johnson & Johnson Pediaeare Infant Drops and Tylenol Concentrated from store shelves. The phar­maey chain said cus­tomers can return the products for a full refund. 
Catherine T o m -Revzon, a pediatric pharmaeist. said par­ents should use natural therapies, 
including saltwater drops and humidifiers, to treat infants' eolds before using drugs. 
"These medications were never designed to eure colds but only to treat eold symptoms, and in ehildren under two there was little evidenee they were effective anyway," said Tom­Revzon, who is pharmacy man­ager at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore in New York. 
Late last month the Food and Drug Administration tentatively recommended adding the words "do not use in children under two years" to products' labeling. Current labeling directs parents to eonsult a doc­tor before administering the drugs to infants and toddlers. 

The medieines eome in tiny, droplet-size doses, but parents occasionally do not consult or follow directions from physi­eians, which can lead to aeei­dental overdose. 
FDA will formally eonsider revising labeling at a meeting seheduled for Oct. 18-19. 
After reviewing reports of side effects over the last four decades, FDA found 54 child fatalities from over-the-eounter decongestant medieines. The ageney found 69 reports of chil­dren's deaths connected with antihlstamines, whieh are used to treat runny noses. 
The Consumer Ilealthcare Products Assoeiation said it will conduct a multiyear campaign to educate parents and physi­eians on safe use of cold medi­cines. A spokeswoman for the group said it was too early to rule out a return of the prod­ucts to the market. 
"The manufaeturers made this deeision after a lot of con­sideration and with great eare for the best interests of parents and children," said CHPA spokeswoman Virginia Cox. "But we can't spP.ak to what the future holds." 
Infants Drops, Wyeth's Dimetapp Decongestant Infant Drops, Novartis' Triaminie Infant & Toddler Thin Strips and Prestige Brands Holdings' Little Colds Decongestant Plus Cough.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
ESPN appearance goes wrong 
After watching today's showing of "First Take" on ESPN. I felt compelled to write to The Observer about the stark contrast between the two student reporters from Boston College and Notre Dame. While BC's representative showed class and made intelligent points, The Observer's Chris Khorey came ofT as arrogant and disrespectful. 
The show's weekly segment has been an oppor­tunity to showcase two schools that will be playing an important game over the weekend and allow the nation to see a spirited but fun presentation of both schools. Given the historic rivalry (both aca­demic and athletie) between the two schools, I expectl~d to see an intelligent discussion between the two reporters. The resulting exchange, howev­er. fell far short. I have never met Chris Khorey and surely do not mean to ofl'er any judgments about his character based on a short television appearance. I graduated from an Ivy League school and have no college athletic affiliations to bias my judgment of either sehool. In faet, I have a high opinion of both schools and was sorry to see Notre Dame's representative resort to taunting BC as a "backup college." 
I hope that the portrayal of Notre Dame that many sports fans witnessed today is not an accu­rate representation of Notre Dame students. Even a long and storied rivalry can be discussed and analyzed with respect and dignity, and we should certainly expect as much from two highly-regard­ed institutions.

I found it interesting that in her letter, "Not a Little Brother" (Oct. 11), Sheila Miller seems upset about the lack of respect that Notre Dame has shown to Boston College. I'm just eurious what she thinks of the various disrespectful acts committed by her beloved Eagles over the years.

And what about the "smug superiority" Miller aceuses ND fans of having? After saying this, she proce1~ds to say in no uncertain terms that Notre Dame will lose this weekend's game. How's that for the pot calling the kettle black? 
The fact that Miller, a BC class of 2002 alumnus, took the time out of her presumably busy day just to write to the Notre Dame student newspaper just goes to further validate most of the student body's feelings toward Boston College. Good luck on Saturday, Sheila. But win or lose, you should probably do something about that inferiority complex of yours. Although I guess it goes with the territory of going to Boston College.

Unnecessary source? 
After reading Sheila Miller's Letter ("Not a little brother," Oct. 10), I only have one question: Why is a Boston College graduate who lives in Oregon reading the Notre Dame campus newspaper? Perhaps she should have cancelled her subscription when she got her Notre Dame rejection letter.

Tearing at the edges of freedom 
Author Christopher Hitchens' latest book, "God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything," contends-among other assertions -that religious faith is grounded on wish-thinking. He writes that God did not create man in his own image, but the other way around. With man conjur­ing an image of God, Hitchens says, that it "is the painless explana­tion for the profu­sion of gods and reli­gions, and the fratri­cide both between and among faiths, that we see all about us and that has so retarded the development of civilization." 
Hitchens suggests that people who are otherwise goodhearted can be blinded by a belief in a higher authority which ulti­mately causes them to uncharacteristically do wrong. While they may profess to believe in the worth, dignity and rights of mankind, they degrade and confme others. Famed World War II journalist Ernie Pyle best described a close analogy of this thought when he wrote about how American soldiers learned early during the war to transition from a belief of killing as sinful to a casual professionalism of killing as a craft. 
The Hitchens' theory that wish-thinking of a higher belief in religious dogma can corrupt us also applies to wish-thinking in politics. Americans have and will use fear and political wish-thinking to preserve the high belief of freedom while invading other nations, oppressing even our own citizens and denying our long-standing rights. President Franklin Roosevelt was flat wrong at the outbreak of World War II to confine Japanese-Americans living on the west coast. Democratic U.S. Senator Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii is living testa­ment today to such prejudice that prevent­ed him from enlisting-that is, until our government faced a military manpower shortage. Then he was sent to the front lines to face the ultimate sacrifice. 

With each passing day, the Bush White House tears another edge away from our fabric of carefully balanced American free­doms. Under the broad mantle of national security, federal government departments both domestic and abroad claim exemp­tions from the protections enshrined in our Constitution and defined in international agreements. Under Bush, the American government has retarded constitutional guarantees through warrantless wiretaps, indefmite imprisonment without trials and torture-like interrogation techniques. Once envied and revered around the world as the beacon of freedom, American ideals are now tarnished throughout the interna­tional community. 
For the first time since World War II, persons have been detained in the name of security -sometimes for years without acknowledgment of their whereabouts and

without legal counsel. They have been subjected to extremes of deprivation and torture techniques both in a war zone at the Abu Ghraib prison in 2003 as well as on American territory at Guantonamo, Cuba. ln the eyes of foreign admirers who yearn for our freedoms, Americans are now hypocrites. 
In years past, the American way of life needed no explanation. Our system of fair play and equality was the foundation and origin of all freedoms. Because equality was our beginning-not the end -of all arguments about law, life and human nature, it was also the beginning-but by no means the end -of all disputes about the constitution and justice. So it was no surprise last week when White House Press Secretary Dana Perino denied that secret memos written by the Justice Department in 2005 sanctioned torture. Yet, as time passes, more evidence to the contrary exists. 
The New York Times described the 2005 memos as "an expansive endorsement of the harshest interrogation techniques ever used by the Central Intelligence Agency." The techniques consisted of extreme tem­peratures of heat and cold, water-board­ing or simulated drownings, prolonged stress positions and isolation accompanied only by continuously played loud music. It does not matter that other nations had been calling these same techniques torture for decades. 
Since the Bush administration claimed that these methods approved for use by the CIA were "not torture," officials could parse words and maintain their deniabili­ty. Their narrow defmition, unrecognized elsewhere, defined torture as "severe physical or mental pain or suffering that results in significant harm of significant duration, lasting months or even years." 
As a result, America's bedrock principles of human rights and standing as a global leader in a respect for the rule of law con­tinues to be undermined by their wish­thinking policies. An essential part of win­ning the war on terrorism and protecting our nation is to safeguard the ideals and principles that Americans hold dear: that torture is not acceptable and the constitu­tion must be respected. 
It is sad to think that Hitchens could be describing our current poisonous political climate in his anti-God book when he wrote of an "inescapable demand for com­fort, reassurance, and other infantile needs subsisting largely on lies and fears." Unfortunately, political wish-thinking will continue until we restore America's stand­ing as a nation committed to human rights, human dignity and the rule of law.

Expectations for Hascal Flatts arn high. From its sell'-titled first album through tho four albums that followed, tho group has bnen a success story. 
But its latnst album does not deliver up to standards. While it still appealing, it simply dons not have the strength of the band's previous releases. 
The beauty of Hascal Flatts is in the combination of amazing lyrics and heart-gripping music. The band's style extends the movement to revolutionize eountry into a truly national phenome­non -onn that stays true to its country-After Dick convinces editor Maggie Prescott (Kay Thompson} that Jo is the perfect choice for the new face of "Quality," all involved are whisked away to Paris to unveil a new fashion line and introduce Jo to the world press. 
It is diffieult to pinpoint the star in "Funny Face." Hepburn and Astaire are obvious choices, but always at the forefront of the lilm are the City of light and the fashions of Hepburn's favorite designer and friend, Hubert de Givenchy. The camera displays ParL<> and fashion with such adoration that 
it is no wonder why even today, 
a milestone in 20th century fashion. 
Despite the fundamental pres­ence of Paris and fashion, Hepburn and Astaire are the true, irresistible . appeal of the film. "Funny Face" marks the first and only time the pair would star in a movie together, but their combined performance is unforgettable and magical. 
The collaboration almost didn't 
happen. Their schedules failed to matc:h up, but when Astaire heard that Hepburn specifically requested to star with him in the musical, he decided to wait for her. 
"She asked for me, and I was 
western roots but appeals to a wider audience. And the group was incredibly successful. In 2006, the sale of Rascal Flatts' albums composed an astonishing seven percent of all country music albums sold. The group is particularly unique in the number of singles released per CD. Rascal Flatts has released 27 singles from the 5 albums, with the majority of the "Feels Like Today" and "Me and My Gang" albums being released over the span of two years. Of these singles, eight have been top hits on the country charts, and 18 have cracked the overall U.S. charts. Rascal Flatts' in11uence has been felt in many domains, and its music can be recognized from films such as "Cars," which features the 

band's cover of "Life is a Highway" -a cover that is arguably better than the original. 
The group rose out of Nashville -country capital of the nation. Gary LeVox is lead vocalist; Jay DeMarcus is harmony vocalist and on bass guitar, guitar and piano; and Joe Don Rooney is on harmony vocals, electric guitar, steel guitar and mandolin. 
Three songs have already been released from the newest album, "Still Feels Good." "Take Me There" was the first released and has already topped country ready," he said at the time. "ThL<> could be the last and only opportunity I'd have to work with the great and lovely Audrey and I was not missing it. Period." 
The performances from both of the two Hollywood legends are exceptional, yet much credit is due to Hepburn, who isn't the typical musical star. Although she had formal dance training in her youth, she never possessed the same skill as other Astaire partners, like Ginger Rogers and Leslie Caron. But Hepburn's natural grace and passion for dance made her an easy partner for Astaire, and the two dance searnlessly together throughout the film. 
Unlike in her most famous musical, "My Fair Lady," Hepburn was allowed to do her own singing in "Funny Face." Her voice lacks the vocal strength and quality of co­stars A<>taire and Thompson, but what she lacks in singing ability, she makes up for in pure emotion. Hepburn infuses her songs with feeling, something she mastered with "Moon River" in "Breakfast at Tiffany's." 
While Hepburn's star shines bright in "Funny Face," Astaire's is just as brilliant. The hoofer once again displays hL<> creative talent as Dick sings and dances his way to Jp;s heart. In the number "Let's Kiss and Make Up," Astaire demonstrates his pen­chant for incorporating props of all sorts into his routines. Dick taunts an imaginary bull with his red-lined raincoat and subdues

charts. The second released, "Hevolution," is a part of the soundtrack for "Evan Almighty." And "Still Feels Good" is climbing the charts as well. This album has a lot to live up to -espe­cially with all four of the group's previ­ous albums achieving double platinum ("Hascal Flatts" and "Melt") or quadru­ple platinum status ("Feels Like Today" and "Me and My Gang"). 
"Still Feels Good" is undoubtedly a great album. Rascal Flatts has the typi­cal great sound and vocals. Yet while this album might still feel good, it just doesn't sound as good as the last two albums. It's not quite the worst of the five, but it doesn't even come close to matching the top two albums. It lacks the surge of energy in "Me and My Gang" and the passionate love songs of "Feels Like Today." It is instead some­thing more akin to "Melt." A few great songs, pleasant to listen to, but nothing that just makes getting out of bed in the morning a must. "Take Me There" is the only song that is reminiscent of the band's best romantic lyrics. It oozes with the simple purity of love that makes Rascal Flatts so endearing. The rest of the songs, however, are a bit lovelorn and even border on that whiney pop­country that is so frequently criticized by lyrical critics.

featurettes such as "The Fashion Designer

"Parisian Dreams," which describes the

However, there must be someone who 
could have provided an expert's opinion on 
"Funny Face," and the absence of that com­

It is not often that the small, poorly publieized films capture the hearts of theatergoers -they rarely get the chance -but there are some that can­not be ignored. "Once" is one of those films. Healistic and romantic, "Once" offers something different to the audi­ence. 
This Fox Searchlight Film is very dif­ferent from your typical, canned flick. Much of its novelty stems from its focus on character development rather than plot twists. Though not much activity occurs in this movie, it constantly engages and intrigues. 
"Once" is a modern musical, in that it takes musical interludes -but it is not a grandiose, bright song-and-dance extravaganzas like "Chicago" or "Across the Universe." Tha movie has tbe grainy, rough feel of an independent film. The songs are not drawn from the plot, either; instead, they are songs the main characters wrote while living through the experiences depicted on the screen and sing in realistic circumstances. There is no bursting into song in the middle of a street -unless they are husking and looking for change. 
The director, John Carney, cast singer/songwriters for the protagonists, not actors. Glen Hansard is the bass gui­tarist of Irish rock band The Framers. Together, Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova, along with two other artists released an album, "The Swell Season," in 2006 and later toured with Damien Hicc.

The album opens with "Falling Slowly," a track that initiates the pair's friendship in the film. The song, with its clear echoes of Damien Rice and male and female vocal harmony, is a slower-paced, bare-bones piece that grabs the listener with ease. With little instrumentation accompanying the simplicity of the vocals, "Falling Slowly" sets up a stripped down musicality that, though varying at times, carries through the rest of the album.

"Fallen" departs from the rest of the album with an almost whimsical feel to Hansard's vocals and a sweetness in its harmonies and lyrics. 
Other notable tracks include "Lies," a bitter reflection on the frustrations of love that calls to mind shades of both Rice and early David Gray; "Trying to Pull Myself Away," a guitar-heavy track highlighting Hansard's emotionally­strained vocals; and "Once," the album's title track that relishes in subtlety. 
The album isn't entirely without weak­nesses. At times .. Hansard sounds almost distractingly Rice-like. lrglova, then, also must move beyond the comparison between her and Rice's usual counter­part, Lisa Hannigan. In both of their cases, however, the strength of their individual performances and the devel­opment of the album prevent these com­parisons from dominating the overall experience. The final track, "Say It to Me Now," more than makes up for any faults with its juxtaposition of beauty and anger. 
In the case of this strong, understated album, listening "Once" is definitely not enough.

"I can't really single any one guy out," Kownacki said. "Our defense has just played well all year." 
They face an Otter team that has also had its share of disappointment this year, going 0-2 and scoring just one touchdown in two games. 
"As you can tell by our record, it's been pretty tough," Sorin senior captain Hyan Bove said. 
Bove attributed his team's disappointing seasQn to men­tal mistakes on both sides of the ball. 
"If we cut down on mis­takes, we're a couple of plays away from being 2-0," he said. "We've given up four or five big plays, which is huge [in this league]." 
Against the Vermin, expect the Otters to continue to pound a running attack cen­tered around sophomore run­ning back Hob Gallic and rely on a strong defense to keep the game close. 
Sorin should be aided on defense by the return of soph­omore lineman Preston Bennett, who missed the first two games to injury. 
"!Bennett] should definitely help," Bove said. "We've been short on linemen, and ·he can help fill that position and free up other guys to play other spots." 
Even though their main focus may already be toward next season, expect both teams to fight for a win on Sunday. 
"It's been disappointing," Kownacki said. "But we're just going to go out there and have fun."

Associated Press 

ATLANTA John Schuerholz stepped aside Thursday after 1 7 years as general manager of the Atlanta Braves with only one regret. 
Despite an unprecedent­ed 14 straight division titles, the Braves won just one World Series. 
With a few more rings, he figured, this would have been the perfect farewell. 
"What else is there?" said Schuerholz, who will become team president and turn over the GM duties to his right-hand man, Frank Wren. "It would have been, unequiv­ocally, the complete valida­tion of the grand nature of this franchise. Nobody could have said anything about the Atlanta Braves and ended the sentence with the word 'but."' 
Otherwise, Schuerholz has no complaints with his career, one that could land him a spot in Cooperstown someday. 
He turned 6 7 last week and was admittedly worn down by the grind of more than a quarter-century as a general manager. Before coming to Atlanta, he spent nine years in the same post with the Kansas City Royals, winning another World Series title in 1985. 
But he will forever be remembered for his impact on the Braves, a 
perennial last-place team when he took over in 1991. That very first year, Atlanta won the NL West and went all the way to the World Series. In the years that followed, the division titles kept coming with numbing regularity, until the streak finally ended with a third-place finish in 2005. 
"Obviously, John has done an unbelievable job with the organization," outfielder Jeff Francoeur said. "He definitely deserves to retire and enjoy what he's accom­plished. It's sad, because we didn't want to see him go." 
Actually, he's not going anywhere. Schuerholz signed a four-year contract and remains second in command to chairman Ten;y McGuirk, but will step away from day-to-day personnel decisions, such as trades, free-agent sign­ings and other roster moves. 
''I'll miss that," Schuerholz said during a news conference at Turner Field. 
Wren, a former GM with the Baltimore Orioles, spent the past eight years working for Schuerholz and hoping to eventually replace him. 
"Our styles are differ­
ent," said Wren, who also "got a four-year deal. "But our philosophies are very, 
very similar." 

IN BRIEF A&M coach admonished for 
exclusive team newsletter 
COLLEGE STATION, Texas -Texas A&M officials admonished coach Dennis Franchione for his secretive, for-pay newsletter Thursday and said the embarrassing episode would be a factor in deciding whether he returns next season. 
Franchione didn't lose his job, but athletic director Bill Byrne said the newsletter -which delivered inside information to boosters for $1,200 a year -would be considered when he evaluates the coach after the season. 
The school said it would report the results of an internal investigation to the NCAA because of possible rules violations, and Franchione was ordered to shut down his Web site, CoachFran.com. He also will receive a "letter of admonishment." 
"The Aggies are embarrassed right now," Byrne said. "This has been a very unfortunate incident we do not want to experience again." 
Wizards center Thomas 
undergoes heart surgery 
WASHINGTON -Washington Wizards center Etan Thomas under­went open heart surgery Thursday at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota to repair a leak of the aortic valve, an irregulari­ty discovered during a routine physical before start of training camp. 
The Wizards, citing Thomas' right to privacy, made no statement other than to acknowledge the surgery took place. The team hoped to provide details Friday after consulting with his doctor. 
"Hopefully they can correct the prob­lem," forward Antawn Jamison said. "We know how much he loves the game of basketball and what he means to this team, but the most important thing -you just hope that the surgery goes well." 
Whether the 29-year-old Thomas will play in the NBA again is unknown, and at the very least he will need months to recuperate before rejoining his team. 
Struggling Hornish pon­ders NASCAR future CONCORD, N.C. -As the list of open-wheel stars moving to NASCAR grows, Sam Hornish Jr. remains undecided about his future. He's had tremendous success in IndyCars -winning three champi­onships and last year's Indianapolis 500 -but his tryout in stock cars hasn't been nearly as smooth. He's still trying to make his first Nextel Cup event, and dropped to 0-for-4 after failing to qualify for Saturday night's race at Lowe's Motor Speedway. "We knew it was going to be diffi­cult coming in," I-Iornish said Thursday. "We'd like to have been racing a couple times so far, but we knew this was a possibility. We knew this was going to be tough, and that's why I said I wanted to do this." A longtime open-wheel loyalist, Hornish now finds himself one of the many newcomers in NASCAR.

GETTING HIS KICKS 

Huggins back hollle at West Virginia 

Senior punter Geoff Price kicks against UCLA as senior Anthony Vemagtla races Into coverage In Pasadena. 

Associated Press 

CIIAHLESTON, W.Va. -Bob Huggins' dream job is about to begin -in a big way. 
No more pep talks to alumni and fans. No more basketball camps. No more recruiting. Finally, Huggins gets to scold, teach and mold his players full time, beginning Friday night at the official start of practice at West Virginia. 
"It seems like I've been gone every day," Huggins said Thursday. ''I'm just so happy I'm off the road and back to coach­ing. I can hardly stand it." 
Three decades after hi'> playing days at his alma mater, a new generation will see Huggins' intense and unrelenting coaching style in person, their roles far dif­ferent than the 3-point loving ofl'nnse of his WVU predecessor, John Beilein. 
Huggins anticipates an emo­tional return to the WVU Coliseum in Morgantown where he played from 1975 to 1977. leading the Mountaineers in assists his senior year. 
lluggins expects several former teammates to show up at Mountaineer Madness, which coincides with the start of prac­tice nationwide. Be's holding out hope that his father, Charles, who was his high school coach in east­ern Ohio, might show up if his health allows.

test and a two-ball competition 
between the men's and women's 
teams, along with team scrim­
mages and a speech from 
Huggins. 

"I guess it will hit me tomor­
row. I've still got jet lag," said 
Huggins, fresh ofT a trip to the 
West Coast. ''I'm surn walking in 
the Coliseum tomorrow will hit 
me. It's just such a spec:ial placn 
and there are so many special 
memories there for me. So it will 
be a fun time." 

Early season ticket sales have 
been strong, although it's too 
soon to tell whether Huggins will 
have a huge impact. The 
Mountaineers sold 5,600 season 
tickel'i last year. 

"All indications arc that it's 
going to be a good year," said 
Matt Wells, WVU's ticket market­
ing manager. 

West Virginia couldn't lure 
Huggins back fivn years ago after 
Gale Catlett's retirement. lluggins 
was ousted after 16 seasons at 
Cincinnati following a 2005 
drunken driving arrest. lie took a 
year off and coached last sea'ion 
at Kansa<; State. 

West Vir~-,rinia athletic director Ed Pastilong didn't need to bog Huggins again when Beilein left for Michigan in April, even though it meant leaving behind one of the nation's best recruiting classes at Kansas State. 
Huggins' work at West Virginia began with a recruiting trip the day allnr he wa'i hirnd. lie's since criss-crossed the state too many times to count -not to mention many out-of-state plane trips~ And never mind the 54-year-old Huggins is only five years remov11d from a heart attack. 
"In my line of work, peoplo used to say, 'man, you need to slow down, stop and smell the roses,"' Huggins said. "Well, what happens when you slow down, stop and sm11ll the roses, people like Hick Pitino and Billy Gillispie run right by you." 
He'll have some work to do to move closer to those established programs at Louisville and Kentucky, tnams he was familiar with at Cincinnati. 
Huggins inherited three startnrs .from the team that won the NIT championship. llis influ­ence on his nnw players was immndiate. 
Under Beilein, the Mountaineers gamblnd with one­shot possessions, so who nendnd a bulked-up body to absorb the hil'i of crashing the boards'? 
Huggins' tnams, that's who. 
"I think we lost a couple games last year when we were out­toughed," forward Alnx Huoff said. "I don't think that will hap­pen this year. I am exdted. A lot of things are new." 
Guards Da'Sean Butler and Joe Mazzulla and forwards Jon Alexander and WHIIington Smith have put on notieeabln weight through oflsnason workoul'i. 
"Jon Alexander, that's the guy you'llnotien is mueh bigger," cen­tHr .Jamie Smalligan said. 
Not that the players didn't lift weights under Beilein, but "there's just a bigger emphasis now on transferring it to the court," point guard Darris Nichols said. "That's how (Huggins') teams play. It's more physical and you nend to get in the weight room." 
The roles among the eight returning players will be much different than a year ago. 
Huggins plays a tough man-to­man defense, far different the Heilein's signaturn 1-3-1 zone.

Power pitchers lead Red Sox, Indians to ALCS 

the Los Angeles Angels. 
"The matchup, it's a great thing for baseball," Boston catcher Jason Varitek said. "Those two guys have had tremendous years and they both have tremendous stuff." 
Sabathia's 1-0 loss in Cleveland the day before Beckett's setback came against Daisuke Matsuzaka, who is set to pitch the third game against Jake Westbrook. 
The Indians lefty finished at 19­7 with a 3.21 ERA but labored in his team's playoiT opener, throw­ing 114 pitches in five innings. Still, he got the win in the 12-3 rout of the New York Yankees. 
"It was just a case of me over­throwing," Sabathia said. "It was the first game against the Yankees, first game of the play­offs, (my) first playoff game in six years, so I was excited." 
He's not alone . 

Despite his postseason success -three shutouts in six starts and the MVP award of the 2003 World Series with Florida -Beckett feels the jitters on days he pitches, too. 
"All day is kind of like an anxi­ety-type deal for me," he said. "I think it's a little more during the playoffs, but after you throw your first pitch, it's back to executing pitch by pitch by pitch." 
Both teams finished at 96-66, the best record in baseball, but Boston gained home-field advan­tage by winning the season series 5-2.

BOSTON -Even when they lose, Josh Beckett and C.C. Sabathia can seem unbeatable.

That loss in Cleveland on July 25 in which Beckett pitched an eight-inning complete game, but Game 2 starter Fausto Carmona was just a little better, probably didn't provide much help for Friday's outing. 
"They've got a couple new guys so you've just got to go at it as a new game," Beckett said. 
He was 20-7 this season, the first 20-game winner in the majors since 2005, with a 3.27 ERA. He pitched a four-hit, com­plete-game shutout in the opener of the AL division series against

ting average, .279 to .268, but the Indians hit more homers, 178­
166. Their pitching staffs were comparable -Boston had the AL's best ERA and Cleveland ranked third. 
"They've got great pitching and we do, too. They've got huge bats and we do, too," Sabathia said. "I think we're dead even." 
He'll have to face a potent Boston lineup that outscored the Angels 19-4. David Ortiz and Manny Ramirez found their power strokes, each hitting two homers in the three games. For Cleveland, five of their nine starters hit .353 or better in the four games against the Yankees. 
So with the Green Monster looming in left field and the short wall down the right-field line, might this be the time for Beckett and Sabathia to unravel? 
"I don't see panic taking over," said Boston pitching coach John Farrell, who was Cleveland's director of player development before joining the Red Sox this season.

Hurricanes halt Senators five-game win streak 

Associated p..,,, 

crrrAWA -In fadng the Eastern Confnrencn champions, Peter Laviolette want1~d the Carolina llurrieanes to remember that they arn essentially the same team that won the Stanley Cup two seasons ago. 
Erik Cole seored twice and Chad Larose had three assists, helping Carolina end Ottawa's season-opening five-game win­ning strnak with a 5-3 victory over the Senators on Thursday night. 
Cam Ward stopped 27 shots and Matt Cullen and Rod Brind'Amour also scored for the llurrieanes, who improved to 3­1-1 overall. Carolina, which missed the playoffs last season, is 2-1 midway through a six-game road trip that included Monday's 7-1 win in Toronto. 
"We've got to stop playing the opponent. We've got to start play­ing our game," said Laviolette, the Hurricanes eoach. "We've got great hockey players in there who are capable of' good things on any night. Yeah, they have a good hockey team, obviously, but we've got a good team, too. We should just worry about our­selves." 
Cole, who opened the scoring with his first goal of the season on a power play in the first peri­od, got his second goal 6:35 into the third to put Carolina up 4-1. 
Mike Fisher and Joe Corvo scored goals 1:55 apart late in the third to draw Ottawa within 4-3. But Eric Staal scored into an empty net with 59 seconds remaining to seal the win. 
"It was definitely a niee win for our team," Staal said. "Ottawa being undefeated, we knew it was going to be a good test for us and it was kind of nice to be sit­ting here, kind of waiting for them with them playing in Atlanta (Wednesday) night." 
Dany Heatley also scored his fifth goal of the season for Ottawa, which fell one game short of matching its best start ever. Martin Gerber made 27 saves. 
"They were working hard and they were really aggressive," Gerber said. "It was a tough grind. They really battled." 
The Senators, who won 3-1 in Atlanta on Wednesday, began the 2005-06 season with six straight victories on their way to setting franchise records for wins (53) and points (113). 
"Obviously they're a pretty

good team but they're maybe a little road weary from last night's game and last night's trip so we're just going to take it as a pretty good effort from us," Cole said. 
Ottawa captain Daniel Alfredsson ended a five-game points streak. Through Wednesday, Alfredsson led the league with nine points, inducting five goals and four assists. 
Each of Carolina's first thrne goals came off rebounds. 
Cole opened the seoring on a power play 17:33 in. The Hurricanes' lel't wing jumped on a rebound of Staal's shot that Senators defenseman Wade Hedden was unable to dear, bmtt­ing Gerber for his lirst goal of the season. 
Cullen made it 2-0 just 1:10 into the seeond when he batted a floating rebound of Larose's shot out of mid-air, though only all1~r hesitating long enough to ensure that he made eontaet with the puek below the height of the crossbar.

MLB PLAYOFFS 
Rockies continue i111probable run w-ith Ga111e 1 victory 
Associated Press 
PHOENIX -Make it 18 out of 19 for the remarkable Rockies. Neither a ruckus by the Arizona crowd nor a four-day layoff could slow them down. 
Jeff Francis outpitched Brandon Webb, Brad Ilawpe got the big hit and Colorado won the NL championship series opener 5-1 Thursday night in a game interrupted when fans angered by an umpire's disputed interfer­ence call threw objects onto the field. 
After several water bottles landed near Colorado players, umpires pulled the teams off the field in the bottom of the seventh inning. 
"There comes a point in time when you need to make a point. 
Enough's enough," Rockies man­ager Clint Hurdle said. 
After an eight-minute delay, umpire crew chief Tim McClelland told Hurdle to have Francis throw a pitch and "fight through it." 
He did, the wild-card Rockies escaped a jam and their superb bullpen did the rest. 
Colorado won on almost a daily basis during its surge. But the Rockies hadn't played since completing a three-game sweep of Philadelphia on Saturday. 
The time allowed the nervous­ness to mount for the first NLCS game in Hackies' history. 
"As soon as I stepped on the field, I'm sure I speak for every­body else, you had butterflies," said Hawpe, whose bases-loaded single brought home two runs in Colorado's three-run third. "It was an emotional, high-energy day for all of us. We weren't in the flow of it like we had been. So you know today's win, I think, is even more special because of that." 
Game 2 is Friday night in Phoenix, with Arizona lefty Doug Davis facing hard-throwing Colorado rookie Ubaldo Jimenez. 
Francis dominated while Rockies hitters, coming off a first-round sweep over Philadelphia, patiently waited out Webb. Then again, they were familiar with the 2006 NL Cy Young winner -this was the seventh time he started against Colorado this year. 
All seven hits Webb surren­dered were singles. "It was just bloops over short 
and second," he said. "It was tough luck. There's really noth­ing you can do." 
Colorado's lone loss during its streak came to Webb and the Diamondbacks at Coors Field on Sept. 28. This time, the Rockies won by bunching singles against the Arizona ace -it was the first time this season they won without an extra-base hit. 
"Our offense can find a lot of ways to win games," Francis said. "It's been fun to have them behind me this year." 
On a hot night in the desert ­it 93 degrees outside at game­time -tempers flared after a relatively calm six innings. 
Down 5-l, Arizona put run­ners at flrst and second with no outs in the seventh. Augie Ojeda bounced to third baseman

Garrett Atkins, who threw to second baseman Kaz Matusi. 
Justin Upton, running from first base, slid over second base and then rolled his right shoul­der into second baseman Kaz Matsui's left leg, knocking the infielder to the ground. Second base umpire Larry Vanover immediately called Upton out for interference, resulting in a dou­ble play. 
"I was just playing the game. I did what I was supposed to do," Upton said. "That's what you're taught to do when you slide is pop up." 
"It's his decision," he said. "I told him I was close to the bag." Vanover wasn't buying that explanation. 
"You had obvious intent on the part of the runner to break up the double play, and when it turns into intentional, that's when he's out for interference," he said. 
"Once he got to the base, I thought he threw his hip up into the guy, and his intent at that point is not to get to the base. His intent is to crash the pivot man, so you've got obvious intent there," he said. 
Said Hurdle: "It looked like a good, aggressive slide going in, and I thougpt he went out of his way to make contact." 
Upton, barely 20 years old, was in Class A when the season began, but on this big stage he didn't hesitate to let Vanover know how he felt in arguing the call. 
"He's battling out there," Melvin said. "He's trying to take somebody out. He's trying to get us an extra out. He's trying to break up a double play. He was emotional about it." 
Fans started throwing water bottles onto the field from the upper decks. When more debris followed, umpires told the teams to get back in the dugouts. 
"We were tired of getting water bottles thrown on the field, that's all," Hurdle said. 
The Rockies returned to the field after admonishments from the public address announrer that anyone throwing objects on the field would be ejected. 
"It was just fans being upset. It's too bad," llawpe said. "A few like that label a lot of people, but sounds like the other fans took care of it and were pulling the people out who wern throwing stuff at us." 
Even though thousands of tick­ets were available at midweek and there were a smattering of empty seats, the crowd of 48,142 was called a sellout. 
Francis threw just one more pitch, giving up a bunt single to pinch-hitter Jeff Cirillo. Matt Herges relievfld and walked Chris Young, loading the bases. 
The Hockies brought Jeremy Affeldt from the bullpen, and he retired Stephen Drew on a fly ball to end the threat. 
The game ended on a bad baserunning play by Arizona. Miguel Montero singled with two outs, but was tagged out when he overslid second base trying for a double. 
Webb and the Diamondbacks swept the Chicago Cubs in the first round. Arizona kept it going in the first inning, taking a 1-0 
lead on a single by Drew and a

Wake Forest tops Seminoles again 
Associated Press 
WINSTON-SALEM. N.C. Riley Skinner threw a 35-yard touchdown pass to Kenneth Moore in the fourth quarter to lead Wake Forest past No. 21 Florida State 24-21 on Thursday night. 
Skinner completed 19 of 27 passes for 215 yards and two touchdowns for the Demon Deacons (4-2, 3-1 Atlantic Coast Conference), who rallied in the second half to beat the Seminoles (4-2, 1-2) in consecu­tive seasons for the first time in school history. 
Skinner led the Demon Deacons 82 yards in nine plays, converting three third downs during their game-winning drive. The biggest came when Skinner sidestepped a pass rush, stepped forward in the pocket and found Moore, who had a step on cornerback Jamie Robinson at the goal line, for the easy score that put Wake Forest up 21-14 with 6:41 remaining. 
Florida State gave the ball right back to Wake Forest on the first play of its ensuing drive, when Chip Vaughn inter­cepted Xavier Lee's deep pass at the 26. The Demon Deacons milked the clock and set up Sam Swank's 48-yard field goal with 
1:40 to play that made it a 10­point game. 

Lee scored on a 17 -yard run with 17 seconds left to draw the Seminoles within 24-21, but Wake Forest recovered an onside kick to seal it. 
Josh Adams rushed 18 times for 140 yards, including an 83­yard touchdown run, and caught a scoring pass. Micah Andrews ran hard as his relief, gaining 57 tough yards in help­ing spark the comeback. The Demon Deacons ran all over Florida State's 11th-ranked run defense, gaining 180 yards, more than double the Seminoles' 81.8 yards entering the game. 
Wake Forest's defense in the first half allowed two big plays that set up the Seminoles' two scoring drives, then shut them down after halftime. The Demon Deacons forced five second-half punts, intercepted two passes and allowed 105 total yards after the break -with a good chunk coming after Swank's late kick. Florida State's rushing offense never could get going, finishing with 47 yards on 24 carries. 
Lee finished 24-of-45 for 283 yards and two touchdowns for the Seminoles.

Irish face off vvith Big East rivals 
By PAT O'BRIEN Sports Writer 

Notre Dame looks to improve its conference record this weekend with matches at Marquette and Syracuse. 
Notre Dame (7-8, 3-2 Big East) travels first to Milwaukee today to face the Golden Eagles at 8 p.m. The Irish then go east to take on Syracuse at 2 p.m. Sunday. 
Notre Dame beat both Big East foes last year in the Joyce Center. Marquette lost 3-1 (30­17, 30-17, 21-30, 30-24), while Notre Dame downed Syracuse 3-0 (30-25, 30-22, 30-22). 
The Irish are led by senior captain Adrianna Stasiuk. She has recorded 187 kills and has team highs in service aces and digs with 18 and 207, respec­tively. 
Four other Notre Dame play­ers have notched more than 100 kills this season. Sophomore outside hitter Serinity Phillips has 206, soph­omore outside hitter Megan Fesl has 185, freshman middle blocker Kellie Sciacca has 146 and junior middle blocker Justine Stremick has 137. 
Senior setter Ashley Tarutis and sophomore setter Jamel Nicholas lead the Irish in assists with 583 and 169, respectively. 
Phillips has 114 digs, and F esl has 13 5. Tarutis has 146 digs, while freshman libero Angela Puente is second on the team with 173. 
"We all have confidence that we've learned from our losses and we will finish on the top of the Big East," Stasiuk said. "We need to work on our defense and offense, and things will fall into place." 
Marquette (6-8, 3-2) and sen­ior outside hitter Kimberly Todd are trying to get win num­ber 399 coach Pati Rolf. Todd is second in the Big East with 
4.82 kills per game. Junior defensive specialist Terri Angst is sixth in the Big East with 
4.50 digs per contest, while senior setter Katie Weidner ranks seventh in the Big East with 11.54 assists per game. 
"[We got] a scouting report on Marquette," Nicholas said. "They are a strong team, and I'm sure that it will be a good game." 
Senior outside hitter Cheryl Cobbina and sophomore out­side hitter Kacie MacTavish lead Syracuse (11-9, 2-3). Cobbina has 262 kills and 202 digs and MacTavish has 243 and 228, respectively, this sea­son. Senior defensive specialist Joscie Kaup tops the team with an impressive 339 digs, and junior setter April Quigley leads the Orange with 609 assists. 
"Marquette and Syracuse are both very competitive teams, and we will have to pass very well and play with a lot of enthusiasm," Stasiuk said.

Keough battles to stay in playoff race 
Alun1ni, O'Neill/oak for their first victories

Sports Writer 

Stanford vs. Keough 
Playoff' hopes hang in the balane1~ this Sunday when Stanford and Knough faco ofT at Hiehle Field at 1 p.m.

Alumni takes on O'Neill this Sunday in a battle of winless teams. 
Either the Uawgs (0-2) or Tho Mob (0-3) will have to come away with their first vic­tory or the year. 
Unh~ss, of course, they tie. 

Both teams are looking to erase memories of lackluster seasons. Alumni senior captain Bret Shapot says the Dawgs'

Stanford has been trying hard to stay focusnd on the Kangaroos despite next week's matchup against bitter rival Kennan. 
"Anytimo you have a rival like Kennan looming, there's always going to be a little look­ing ahead if you're honest with yourself," lluth said. 
The stingy Stanford defense is led by sopho­morn corner­back Chris Gill,

Keough enters Sunday after a crushing 12-6 loss to Dillon in last week's contest. In the closing minutes of the game, tho Kangaroos came up short on a fourth-and-goal play that would have forced at least a tie had Keough put thn ball in the nndzone. 
After tlw loss. tlw Kangaroos find thnmsnlvns at 1-2 and with their backs against tho wall if tlwy want a realistie shot at a playoff lwrth.

For m u c h of tho fourth quarter. tlwy had the Big Hed on tlwir heels. To be stu:cessful in this week's matehup, Keough will need to continuo to pound the ball inside against the strong Stanford defense. 
biggest weak­ness is their bench. 
"We start games off really strong," Shapot said. "But we lack a lot of depth. We have a lot of guys going both ways. It's usual­ly 6-0 at the end of the first half. Then we'll get on the field and just be dead after halrtime." 
Shapol plays both sides of the ball for Alumni at running back and strong safety. 
Despite the lack of sopho­more and juniors, he sees hope in a few recent additions, ineluding former varsity walk­on sophomore Alex Lough. Lough will fill in as a middle linebacker and running back against O'Neill. 
"We're really working on ... running [through] the funda­nwntals. What we want do this week is to put the ball in the end zone," Shapot said. 
Lik!l Alumni, O'Neill senior captain and linebacker Pat Conley thinks his team is not as bad as their record indi­
cates. 

"Basically, 
there [have] 
like it was last 
year. We haven't 
really found any­thing that's worked. You can't point out one thing, it's a whole group of things that haven't been working." 
At 0-3, and coming off a 12­0 loss to Morrissey, the play­niTs are no longer a possibility for the Mob. Like the Dawgs, O'Neill wants to return to fun­damentals on offense. Conley said junior running back Don Joycn and senior quartorbaek Chris Stroh will lead the rnvarnpnd offense this week. 
Depsito the bad start, the Dawgs on tlw other hand, have a slim shot at the postseason, a shot Shapot says will be kept wnll in mind Sunday. 
"It's win or die. We have to win out to have a shot at the playoffs," he said. "We have to beat O'N1~ill this week and then take out Dillon next week. It's that simple."

Belles to face tough competition at Millikin 
By SAMANTHA LEONARD 
Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's hits the road this weekend to take part in the Millikin Invitational in Decatur, Ill. 
Taking a break from confer­ence play, the Belles will face Franklin, Fontbonne, Central Iowa and host Millikin in the two-day event. 
Although none of these teams are in the MIAA, Saint Mary's coach Julie Schroeder-Biek has studied up on her opponents. 
"I have learned a little about our opponents by reviewing their stats online," Schroeder­Hick said. "It just helps us to mentally prepare for our oppo­nent, and get an idea of what we are up against." 
Schroeder-Biek said she looks at a variety of statistics to better prepare her team.

With the Manchester College Invitational tomorrow slated to be Saint Mary's final tune-up before the Oct. 27 MIAA championship meet, the Belles will look to build on last weekend's first-place finish at Benedictine's Eagle Invite. 
"This race has traditionally been a great day for personal

Tough con1petition a"Waits Irish 
Pre-National meet in Terre Haute features nine top-10 opponents 
By CHRIS DOYEN Sports Writer 
Notre Dame travels Saturday to Indiana State for the Pre­National, the last meet before the postseason begins. The meet will mark the first time the men and women have had to venture off­campus since the Crusader Invitational at Valparaiso on Sept. 7. 
The Pre-National meet lives up to its name. It sports a field that includes nearly all championship hopefuls and is run on the same course that will host the NCAA Championships. 
"That's one of the reasons they have this meet," men's head coach Joe Piane said. "It gives teams the opportunity to race once on the course before the national meet. They have been holding this tournament at the site of the national meet for decades." 
The men's team has won its first three meets, including an impressive showing against a stacked field in the Notre Dame Invitational. That performance earned the Irish the No. 7 rank­ing in the USTFCCA national poll. 
But the opposition doesn't get any easier for the Irish this weekend in Terre Haute. Nine of the top-10 teams in the nation­and 27 of the top 30 -will be in the field. Piane will enter the top seven finishers from the Notre Dame Invitational in the varsity race. Those include senior Jake Watson, junior Patrick Smyth and sophomore Jake Walker. 

"I would like to think that Patrick Smyth and Jake Watson will come up big for us again," Piane said. "Jake Walker has also been training really hard and should make an impact." 
Smyth, Watson, freshman Dan Jackson and Walker finished sec­ond, No. 10, No. 16 and No. 30 against the stiff competition at the Notre Dame Invitational. Freshman Paul Springer and seniors Brett Adams and Mike Popejoy will round out the varsi­ty lineup for the Irish this week­end. 
The women won their first two meets of the season and entered the USTFCCA poll at No. 27, but they relinquished that ranking after fmishing 12th in the Notre Dame Invitational. 
Like the men, the Irish women will face their toughest test of the season. Nine of the top-1 0 teams in the nation will run, giving the women an opportunity to put themselves in position to receive an at-large bid for the NCAA Championships. 
Freshman Marissa Treece, who has paced the Irish in the last two meets, will try to lead the way, along with sophomore Lindsey Ferguson, who finished only 14 seconds behind Treece at the Notre Dame Invitational.

Miller's 20 saves shut out Atlanta 
Associated Press 
BUFFALO -After two straight losses to start the sea­son, Ryan Miller was deter­mined to get his slumping team in gear. 
Miller made 20 saves for his fifth career shutout, Tim Connolly and Brian Campbell each had a goal and two assists and the Buffalo Sabres got their first win of the sea­son, 6-0 over winless Atlanta on Thursday night. 
"Not that I was slacking off in the summer, but I had to really put the pedal down because we want to be an elite team," said Miller, who had allowed nine goals in Bufl"alo's first two defeats. "I need to be there for the guys when they need me." 
Miller wasn't tested too much by a sputtering Atlanta ofl"ense that has generated just four goals in its first four games, all regulation losses. But when he needed to make a key save to help keep Bufl"alo's momentum going, Miller was there. 
"That's the kind of attitude we need to have," he said. 
It was also an emotional game for Miller, whose 18­year-old cousin died Monday after a complication with a bone-marrow transplant. 
"For him to go through what he did wasn't easy," Sabres coach Lindy Rufl" said. "It was a special night for him. I want­ed to see him get the shutout." 
After winning the President's Trophy last season, the Sabres had gotten off to a sluggish start. dropping their first two games to the New York Islanders. They quickly got healthy against a struggling Thrashers team that is oft" to its worst start since dropping the first nine games of the 2002-03 season. 
Buffalo scored three power­play goals in the first period, and didn't allow a shot when Atlanta had a 5-on-3 advan­tage for 1:34 in the first. 
"Special teams are a big momentum booster," Connolly said. "Killing that two-man advantage kept us going in the right direction." 
Derek Roy, Ales Kotalik and Daniel Paille added a goal and an assist each, and Jason Pominville also scored for the Sabres. 
Atlanta goalie Kari Lehtonen finished with 15 saves before being lifted for Johan Hedberg to start the third period. Hedberg made seven saves. 
The Thrashers were without forward Marian Hossa for the second straight game. Hossa, who had team highs of 43 goals and 57 assists last sea­son, hurt his groin during practice on Monday. 
"Right now we're not playing good hockey," Atlanta coach Bob Hartley said. "We're so tight and anxious to get that first win that we forget to do the right things."

Notre Dame ended a nine­game unbeaten streak Wedrwsday al'tnrnoon with a 1­0 loss to non-c:onl'erenee l'on Michigan State in East Lansing. Tlw Spartans hav1~ lost only one game this year and will most likely crack thn top 25 after this wonk's upset victory. Notre Dame is hoping to prove its merits in thn. top 5. 
"Tho guys will be excited because it is a great way to bounce hack," Clark said. "The best way to do that is to ho playing the No. 1 team in the country. It lets you como back immmliatdy." 
Connecticut also comes into the weekend with only one loss in its l'irst 13 games. The Huskies lost to Big East foe DePaul 1-0 on Sept. 23. Since the loss, the team has gone on a five-game tear, outscoring its opporwnts 14-1 and taking over the No. 1 ranking. 
Junior striker O'Brian White leads the II uskies attack with 14 goals in the team's first 13 games. He seored bac:k-to-back hat tricks in Connecticut's past two games -a 4-0 win over 
Pitt  and  a  3-0  shutout  of  
Providence.  
"Everybody in  the  league  

knows he is very fast and strong. 11~1 doesn't have many weaknesses." Clark said. "It will be a grnat opportunity to sen thn two best forwards in the league and arguably the two best forwards in the eountry." 
Tlw other forward would be Notre Dame's senior Joseph Lapira. Lapira won last year's M.AC. IIermann Trophy for the most outstanding player in col­lege soccer. lie has two goals so far this year and leads the team with four assists. 
Lapira also had an assist in a 1-0 victory over the If uskies in last year's final regular season game. 
"They are very much the same team we played last year," Clark said. 
Connecticut returns eight starters from last season's team that lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. 
One new face, freshman goal­keeper Josh Ford, has wasted no time making a name for himself. Ford has logged nine shutouts and given up only live goals this season. lie has played every minute between the pipes and has a goals-against average of 0.38. 
The Irish will need a total team effort in order to come away with a victory this week­end, Clark said.

Four n1~w freshmen will makn their oiTensivn debut in the first game of tho Lefty McFadden Invitational in Dayton. Ohio ­induding two rookies who hail from Stockholm, Sweden. Robin Bergman and Calle Ridderwall, two of the fastest players in the junior United States Hockey League last season, have joined an oiTensive unit that kept near­ly all of its talent from last sea­son. 
"I think we'll be faster," Irish coach Jell' Jackson said. "I don't want to get too far from being a good puck-possession team. Sometimes highly-skilled play­ers try to make risky plays. We n1~ed to bn creative, but we also rwed to be responsible. That will take a little time to make sure evnrybody understands that." 
Notre Dame's first appearance in the Invitational and the 62nd overall meeting with the Badgers tonight will be the first game the Irish have played since they were knocked out of the second round of the 2007 NCAA Tournament by eventual­champion Michigan State in April. The Irish were ranked No. 1 at the time and had held the top spot for over two months, during which they cap­tured their first league regular season and playoff champi­onships. 
"Sitting there watching Michigan State win the champi­onship had a lot to do with our work ethic this summer," cap­tain and center Mark Van Guilder said. "We were thinking about that all summer."

Irish try to remain hot this weekend 
By FRAN TOLAN Sports Wri1er 
After outscoring Syracuse and St. John's by a combined 7­1 in road games last weekend, Notre Dame looks to remain unbeaten in Big East play when it hosts Georgetown and Villanova this weekend. 
Since falling to non-confer­ence foe Penn State on Sept. 23, the Irish ( 7-4-1 , 5-0-0 Big East) have won four straight against conference foes. With freshman Lauren Fowlkes anchoring the defense, the Irish have allowed only two goals during their four-game winning streak. 
"We are playing well and we got a few of the problems solved on our back line," Irish assistant coach Ben Waldrum said. "Lauren has fit in nicely at center back for us." 
When they face Georgetown tonight, the Irish will try to extend their home winning streak over the Jloyas to eight games. Notre Dame has outscored its conference rival 46-2 at Alumni Field in that span. 
But Georgetown defeated No. 24 Marquette in Milwaukee Sunday to improve to 9-3-0 overall and 2-2-0 in eonf'nrence play. 
"I think that this is the best Georgetown team I've seen," said Waldrum, who is in his fifth season as a membnr of the Irish coaching staff. 
On Sunday, the Notre Dame ofl'lmse will have its work cut out for it when the Irish face Villanova (7-1-5, 1-1-3). In a scoreless draw against South Florida last weekend, Wildcat<;

COMMENTARY 

Sullivan needs to be offense's leader 
Saturday at the Hose Bowl, 
Irish conter John Sullivan 
snapped the ball to the side 
of quarterback Jimmy 

Clausen's head. Clausen dove 
on tho ball 
for a loss of 
nino yards. 
The rnal 
problnm 
with this 
play wasn't 
the loss of 
yards. 
It wasn't 
the bad 
snap­
we've seen 
plenty of 
those this 
season. 
The real 
problnm was what happened 
on the sidelines after the 
play. 
Sullivan could be seen 

berating Clausen on the side­
line. as if the snap were 
somehow the freshman's 
fault. 
Clausen has started only five games in college. Sullivan is a four-year starter. There is no reason why he should be calling out a freshman so publicly. 

Even worse, this wasn't tlw first time that Sullivan has called Clausen out on the sidelines after a bad snap this season. Sullivan did the same thing after a bad snap against Purdue on Sept. 29. 
Sullivan needs to step up and be a loader on offense. Thero's a reason he is a cap­tain. 

Sullivan entered the 2007 soason as one of the top­rated centers in the nation. I le was listed on tho Outland Trophy watch list over the summer and even made Mel Kipnr, .Jr.'s "big board" for olTnnsive linemen for the NFL Draft. 
And when Irish coach Charlie Weis announced that Sullivan would be one of the tnam's captains, hn said it was because of his leader­ship on offense. 

"I'd say more than anyone, one of the reasons why we made Sully a captain, why the c:oaches added a fifth captain to the team, is becausn Sully really has been tho lwart and soul of our whole offense this whole training camp," Weis said at the time. "A lot of the responsibilities we had on the quarterback in the past, 

Jay Fitzpatrick

wc~'ve taken ofT the quarter­
back and we put it on Sully." 
So Weis knows that 

Sullivan has the potential to 
be a leader. The fifth-year 
eenter took over a lot of 

duties traditionally ascribed 
to the quarterback-like 

picking out the middle line­
backer before the snap ­
because Weis trusted that 

Sullivan would be the best 
person to lead the Irish in 

the huddle and on the field. 
But now Sullivan needs to 
re-earn that trust. 

Sullivan has had at least 
one bad shotgun snap in 
most of the team's games 

this season -something that 
he rarely did last year. 

Instead of gelling an inexpe­
rienced offensive line, it has 
become the worst in college 
football, allowing the most 
saeks and aiding the fewest 
rushing yards. 
It's gotten so bad that 

Sullivan is one of the top 10 
most disappointing players in 
eollege football -and the 

only offensive lineman-this 
season, according to Sports 
Illustrated's Web site. 
Hight now, Sullivan's co­
captains on offense have 

become almost non-factors. 
Hunning baek Travis Thomas 
has been relegated to the 

goal-line back, and tight end 
John Carlson has not pro­

duced as much in the passing 
game as he did last season. 
That means that Sullivan 
needs to show some leader­
ship. He is the only captain 
who can make a major 

impact on his own. He needs 
to take charge of the huddle 
in a positive manner, bring­
ing Clausen and the rest of 
the team along to where they 
nnml to be. 

Sullivan's leadership is by no means the only problem this season. Far from it. But his problem is both notice­able and unnecessary. 
On Saturday, don't blame other people for mistakes. Don't worry about anything in the past or anything you ean't control. 
Jusl lead. 

The offense has plenty of problems. 11 just needs a leader.

COACHING 
Charlie Weis finally got his elusive 20th win at Notre Dame last Saturday, but it came despite just 140 yards of total offense. Individual pieces of his team have looked good, but the whole picture has never come togeth­er at the same time. 
Jefl' Jagodzinski is unde­feated as a college head coach. His team is confi­dent and playiing well and appears to believe in him. He has Boston College in the top five for the first time since Frank Leahy was the head coach in Chestnut Hill. 

QUARTERBACKS 
Jimmy Clausen has­n't made very many freshman mistakes,· but he hasn't been very effective through the air either. He will need to air it out a lit­tle more this week for Notre Dame to have any shot to upset the Eagles. 
Matt Ryan is a Heisman candidate that 
is averaging over  300  
yards  passing  per  
game.  He  is  

expereienced at finding the right receiver, and he has been extremely efficient moving his team this season. 
Matt Ryan is a tremendous quarterback who will demonstrate why he is first-round material. The Eagles might not be the best team in the country, but they certainly belong in the conver­sation. Notre Dame will play much better than it has all season, but that only goes so far -talent and experience are on the side of Boston College. The Irish play well but lose. 
FINAL SCORE: Boston College 31 Notre Dame 21 
IRISH RUSHING 
Notre Dame rushed for barely a yard per carry agaisnt UCLA. Although the days of negative rush­ing appear to finally be over, James Aldridge's 100-yard game against Michigan State also feels like a distant memory. The Irish must be more pro­ductive on the ground. 
Boston College is giv­ing up less than 50 yards per game on the ground and less than two yards per carry. Part of the success on the ground may be because teams have to pass when the Eagles get ahead early.

IRISH PASSING 

After a 377,yard day against Purdue, Notre Dame reverted to its old form through the air, pao:;s­ing for just 94 yards against UClA. Freshman Golden Tate's speed will be a factor against Boston College, even though the Bruins were able to neu­tralize him.  
The Eagles are giving up nearly 300 yards per game through the air, although their passing efficiciency defense is solid. Bowling Green had over 400 yards against them last week while try­ing to overcome an early deficit.  

For the first time this season, a victorious Irish team returns to Notre Dame Stadium. They will be greeted by a raucous crowd and will jump out to an early lead over the nation's No. 4 team. But around the third quarter, real­ity will set in as Boston· College's experienced offense will start moving the ball and Notre Dame will sputter. The Eagles will pull away late.

Notre Dame's pass defense has been its strength this season. The Irish are allowing under 150 yards per game and intercepted UCLA quar­terback McLeod Bethel­Thompson four times. But Matt Ryan is the b~st quarterback they've faced.  
Ryan spreads the ball around to lots of targets and is averaging more than 300 yards passing per game. Boston College has eight receivers aver­aging over 10 yards per catch, including leading receiver Brandon Robinson.

SPECIAL TEAMS 
Notre Dame's special teams improved marked­ly last week -but there is still along way to go. Geoff Price needs to punt more consistently, and the punt return team needs to stop committing penalties. Brandon Walker emerged as a reliable kicker. 
Walk-on Steve Aponavicius is 7-for-8 on field goals, and punter Johnny Ayers has pinned 12 punts inside the 20. DeJuan Tribble returns punts, but he's only gotten four oppor­tunities to do so this year. 
INTANGIBLES 
The Irish got their first win of the season last week-and the emotion­al impact of that can't be underestimated. They're coming home to play a team who has beaten them the last four times they've played. If Notre Dame isn't fired up now, it never will be. 
Boston College is off to one of its best starts ever, and its head coach has never lost a game. After feasting on three cupcakes, it enters a tough stretch of games beginning with its most-hated rivaL Now is the time for the Eagles to prove themselves.

The Irish rush defense improved dramatically last week, allowing only 89 yards to UCLA. It remains to be seen whether this improve­ment is temporary or if the front seven has really turned the corner. Notre Dame's rush defense was awful the first five weeks.  
Andre Callender leads a Boston College rushing attack that plays second fiddle to the passing game. He's averaging 89 yards per game on less than 20 carries per con­test. The Eagles throw the ball to set up the run.
