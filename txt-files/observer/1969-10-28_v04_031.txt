At 2:35 a.m. Sunday, cam­pus security received a call from a group of students who were holding a fellow student. This student had been shooting out light bulbs in the vicinity of Badin and Howard with a sling shot. This annoyed a group of students who caught and re­strained him until campus secur­ity arrived. 
Pears felt that the increase of crime that had occurred at the beginning of the year, appears 
to be tapering off. 

Lack of quorum postpones budget 
Failure of the finance Com­mittee to meet yesterday after­noon may prevent the Student Government from introducing their version of the 1969-70 budget to the Student Senate to­night. 
The Senate, however, will 
probably  get  to  the  budget  at  
t h e i r  m e e t i  n g  t o m o r­ 
row.  

According to student body Treasurer John Coughlin, the finance Committee found itself lacking a quorum today when Fr. Charles McCarraghcr, vice -president in charge of Student Affairs, and faculty advisor Pro­fessor John Houck were unable to attend due to prior committ­ments. Coughlin says he has "little doubt" that the budget, which is slightly in excess of fif­ty-nine thousand dollars, will be accepted in the final Finance Committee report. 
"No organization got as much as it asked for," said Coughlin, in explaining the bud­get, "and some of the organiza­tions had their budget cut entire­ly." Coughlin declined to reveal the names of the organizations whose budgets were cut, stating that he would prefer to wait un­til he could notify all the organi­zations and explain the decisions of the committee. 
samts and saints' days are, for many, closely associated with the menacing rattle of massive black rosary beads, dangling at eye level from a nun's waist. The secular mind will find it hard to see the point of studying the Jives and the men and women who~ the Church commemorates today; but we would d? well to consider­models now much ignored, even on this most ChnstJan campus. most Christian campus. 
The two best-known saints are Simon and Jude. Both are referred to as the "brothers" of Jesus in Butler's and Baring-Gould's versions of The Lives of the Saints. Simon was called the Zealot, that is, one of a group of Jews who fought the Romans for the liberation of Palestine, resorting to terrorism in their zeal for the honor and ~ra­ditional purity of their religion. Jude had been a farmer, marned, with two sons, before the two were called to be apostles. It was Jude who, after the last supper, asked Jesus why he did not instigate a movement to bring his Word into the world, as the Messiah's reign was expected to be in an earthly kingdom. They understood after the Resurrection. 
After the Ascension, Simon became a missionary to the East and 
was finally crucified, it is said, by the priests of the idols ot tne 
Persian state power. Jude was crucified and speared to death, also in 
Persia, after having written an Epistle. His sons continued as poor 
farmers, with little land, until they were brought before the emperor 
to be condemned as Christians, to prevent revolt against the Roman 
power. Their simple faith in a kingdom not of this world made them 
seem so harmless that they were freed. Another first-century disciple 
was Thaddeus, who is said to have been brought before the king of 
lands east of the Euphrates, who had an incurable disease; the king 
was cured. Thaddeus refused the king's reward, saying, "If we have 
left our own goods, how shall we take the things that belong to 
others?" 
The next group of ~aints remembered today lived in the second 
half of the third century, when the Church had spread throughout 
the Empire. St. Firmilian was a student of philosophy who became, 
as Bishop of Cappadocia, an important leader in a series of synods. 
The councils declared baptisms conducted by heretics to be invalid, 
in accordance with the earliest Church traditions. Pope Stephen re­
fused to accept the decisions; Firmilian labelled him a schismatic, 
one who had broken away from the unity of the Church and the 
worst of heretics -"in Rome," he wrote, "things are done without 
tradition to support them, and arc pretended to have apostolic 
authority." The Church was reunited when Stephen died soon after­
wards. 
Firmilian was later to lead the attack against a heretic, Bishop 
Paul of Antioch, who denied the divinity of Christ, but died before 
the debate was resolved. St. Malchion, also commemorated today, 
took up the issue. A skillful and well-studied debater, he exposed the 
heresy; Paul was deposed. 
St. Fidclis, of the same period, was one of three Roman soldiers 
who deserted the army rather than do sacrifice to the Emperor. They were caught in the mountains to which they had fled, and executed there. Two other martyrs whose day is October 28 are Sts. Anastasia and Cyril. The tradition is that Anastasia was seized from a community of consecrated virgins, stripped, and tortured. When her tongue had been cut out and her teeth broken, Cyril, a bystander, gave her a drink of water -he was seized and the two were be­


headed together by the Roman authority. Two more of the saints of the day Jived centuries after the fall of Rome, when the Church was supported by the power of kings. The 
differences between these saints and the ones of earlier times is suggestive of how the times had changed with the growing alliance of Church and State. St. Faro was a french nobleman. Although his life

Bishop of Meaux. At night he struggled with his desires for her, and 
was rejected three times; he "gave himself up thenceforth wholly to 
the care of his diocese, so as to stifle his regrets.'. 
St. Neat was also a nobleman, of English stock. After spending his youth in intense study, he entered a cell where he engaged in fasts and had visions of angels for seven years. Great men, including King Alfred, sought his advice. "Being much troubled in his vouth with temptations of impurity, he earnestly begged God that he might oe aeuvered tram that dangerous enemy, and that he might rather be
