'Deterioration continues' 
Reagan disputes martialla 
WASHINGTON {AP)-President Reagan said yesterday that while U.S. sanctions against the Warsaw and Soviet governments have had some impact, life for the Polish people continues to deteriorate under mar­tial law and "we're not going to wait forever for Improvement." 
The president, conducting his seventh White House news con­ference just a day before his first an­niversary in office, also accepted responsibility for the administrative 
decision to grant tax-exempt status to private schools which racially dis­criminate. 
Asked whether his staff was to blame for that widely criticized step, he replied, "No one put anything over on me ... The buck stops at my desk." 
Asked about burgeoning un­employment, Reagan said, "I have the greatest sympathy" for those out of jobs, but "on the other hand, comparing this to the beginning of our term, there are a million people more working than there were in 1980 ..." 
dut the government's own figures don't square with that. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said total employ­ment was 97,188,000 in December, down more than a half-million from the month Reagan took office -last January -and also 94,000 fewer than December 1980. 
Reagan said interest and inflation rates are on the way down, and "I'm quite sure we're going to see an up­swing in the economy." 
The president did not spell out ­nor was he asked -just what positive effects he believes were produceJ by U.S. sanctions on trade, aviation and fishing rights against the Polish and Soviet governments in the wake of the Polish military crackdown. 
"I think they have had an effect, although there's no question the situation in Poland is still deteriorat­ing," he said. "They have tried to present it as moderating; it isn't." 
Reagan said he has had "a lengthy communication" from Pope John Paul II, himself a Pole, and "he ap­proves what we have done so far." 
"And yet we are not going to wait forever for improvement in the 


PC extends invitatio to Provost 0 'Meara 
By ROGER WILKE 
News Staff 

In an attempt to improve relations between student government and the administration, the Hall Presidents Council decided last night to invite Provost Timothy 0'Meara to next week's HPC meeting. 
The HPC members also discussed Fr. Van Wolvlear's rejection of the keg proposal, expressing concern o.ver his reasoning regarding the decision. 
Members noted that some ofVan Wolvlear's statements about the proposal were "ridiculous" and are considering alternative actions on the proposal. The HPC will not, however, appeal the decision to higher University offices. 
"Basically, the HPC is wondering why the Student Senate, the HPC, and even the Campus Life Council are unable to communicate with the Student Affairs Office," HPC President Mike Martin said. 
In other business, Dillon Hall was presented with the Novem· her/December Andy Sowder Memorial Award for hall excellence and spirit. The HPC cited Dillon's football championship as just one example of their hall spirit. Farley was a close second in the bid for the award. 
Andy Schaefer, who is organizing Mardi Gras, announced that Ho­ly Cross at Saint Mary's has the most dancers to date for the upcom· ing Dancethon with 48 participants. Howard Hall has the fewest participants with three. Thus far, there are 498 dancers signed up for the February event. 
situation there," he declared. "We have those steps that we can take." 
A State Department official, asked to expand upon the president's statement, said only that "things could be a lot worse" in Poland ifit weren't for the U.S. sanctions. He asked not to be named. 
On the issue of lifting the Internal Revenue Service's ban against tax exemptions for schools that dis­criminate on the basis of race, Reagan said, "I initiated it." But he acknowledged that the announce­ment had stirred a political furor, which he blamed on misinterpreta­tion. 
Reagan asserted there was no basis in law for the IRS ban, even though "I am opposed with every fiber ofmy being to discrimination." Aweek after the IRS announcement, Reagan asked Congress to outlaw tax exemptions for discriminatory schools. 
The president rejected the notion that American business has yet to respond to his economic incentives, saying: "I think we're just seeing a little caution. They want to make sure before they proceed." He said "I know that a great many industries have the plans all ready for moder­nization and expansion." 
Reagan said his administration was cracking down on news leaks

"The fact the pingers died this morning hasn't changed the position ofthem any," said Lt. Cmdr. Stephen Delaplane, head of the diving opera· tion. "We got a pile of debris down there and they are located SOfTie­where in that debris. We have to keep moving the debris, so we'll get to them." 
Asked whether that meant that the devices had stopped sending locating signals, Delaplane replied testily: "watch my lips. I said we did not listen for the pingers this morn· ing." 
The unrecovered recorders are considered vital to pinpointing the cause of last Wednesday's crash of the Florida-bound plane from Na­tional Airport port. 74 people aboard the plane died, as did four who were on the bridge struck by the twin-engine jet. 
Police said three bodies were pulled from the river yesterday, leaving 18 still in the water. 
The cockpit ofthe plane was lifted from the frozen river and placed on the middle span of the 14th Street Bridge, but the instrument panel fell back into the river. 
Crews tried to haul up a section of the fuselage, but its jagged edges cut through a strap, and the section fell back into the river. The aircraft had 
struck a separate span, nearest Na­
tional Airport, shortly after takeoff 
last Wednesday. 
Delaplane said another eight days 
might be required in the operation 
but even then "there's no absolute 
guarantee we're going to recover all 
the bodies. 
Helicopter rescuers have 
described a man who drowned after 
selflessly passing a life-ring to one 
passenger after another. One of the 
five survivors of the crash, Joseph 
Stiley, said yesterday he believes 
that man was Theodore Smolen, 48, 
ofGaithersburg, Md. 
Stiley spoke to reporters from a wheelchair at the National Hospital for Orthopedics and Rchabilitatio11, in Arlington, Va. 
There had been speculation that Arland D. Williams of Atlanta might have been the passenger who sacrificed himself while helping five others to safety. Autopsies con­ducted on 46 bodies recovered through Sunday showed Williams to have been the only one to have drowned. 
Stiley said the man he believes was Smolen was clinging to the inside portion of a piece of the tail section directly in front of him. He said that the man, who eventually drowned, was strapped into a seat. 
The survivor declared himself "almost but not certainly positive" that it was Smolen, a Fairchild In­dustries employee whose bpdy had yet to be recovered from the river. 
However, Bert Hamilton, 40, an­other Fairchild employee aboard the plane, said he was "reasonably sure It was not Ted."

David Cope, a Notre Dame senior, was assaulted last night by three black youths at the intersection ofEddy and Cedar Streets. According to Cope, he was riding his bike when the youths ap­proached him, ordered him off his bike and physically attacked him. Police happened upon the scene and apprehended two of the three attackers. A South Bend Police Department spokesman refused to comment on the incident saying only that such silence was officially a "new policy." -The Observer 
A car fire at the corner of Notre Dame Ave. and Dorr Road was extinguished Sunday night by Campus Security. The Vehicle, a 1981 Dodge Aspen, was driven by Elizabeth A. Beard of Mishawaka.

A 17-year-old deaf and mute Fort Wayne, Indiana, girl will be tried as an adult for the death ofanother deafgirl and injuries of two family members sustained in a fire. Allen Superior Court Judge Robert L. Hines ruled Monday that Kimberly McDowell will be treated as an adult on murder and arson charges stemming from a house fire at Miss McDowell's foster home in Fort Wayne last july. A witness testified at a hearing last week that Miss McDowell wanted to kill her foster father, Robert Muller, because she did not like having to consider him her "father." Muller is a Lutheran minister and insurance agent. Lillian T. Mohler, 14, who was in the process of being adopted by Muller and his wife, Barbara, was killed in the fire. Mrs. Muller and a 4-year-old foster child were severely burned and otherfamily members suffered lesser injuries, authorities said. -AP 
An explosion tore through an Oklahoma elementary school yesterday and authorities said as many as 30 children were injured. There were unconfirmed reports that a gas leak sparked the blast. Students were being evacuated at the time the explosion oc­curred and several Oklahoma Natural Gas Company trucks were on the scene. Ambulances and law enforcement officers rushed to the scene ofthe blast at the Star Elementary School in Spencer, just east of Oklahoma City. A reporter on the scene said about 10 children were lying on the sidewalk being treated for injuries. Students com­ing out of the school were reported to have cuts on their arms and heads. The Star school is part of the Oklahoma City School District, 
but is located in Spencer. -AP 
After twO Weeks of testimony in Wayne B.

State crime lab microanalyst Richard Ernest took the witness stand late Monday to identify four packages offibers and hairs removed from Williams' car with a special vacuum tool during a June 3 search. Williams, a 23­year-old free-lance photographer and aspiring talent scout, is accused ofmurdering Nathaniel Cater, 27, andJimmy Ray Payne, 21, and dumping their bodies into the Chattahoochee River. Cater and Payne were among 28 young blacks whose deaths here during a 22-month period sparked one ofthe most intensive police investiga­tions in U.S. history. There have been no arrests in the 26 other

Strict training to keep their eyes only on the plane next to them may have led three pilots of an elite Air Force stunt squad to blindly follow the lead of a fourth and slam into the Nevada desert after a 400 mph dive. "Normally, he (the leader) is the only one looking where he's going," said Air Force Sgt. Dick Conner. "We don't know whether it was a mid-air collision or a case offollow the leader into the ground," he said, adding that it may be several weeks before investigators make a determination. "It's one of the pos­sibilities," Conner said ofwitnesses reports that the planes slammed into the desert. He said it would take a trained observer to tell what had happened because the planes were flying so fast, about 350 knots. The Thunderbirds' commander, Maj. Norman L. Lowry III, died along with the three other pilots in Monday's accident during practice. Besides Lowry, 37, of Radford, Va., killed were Capt. Willie Mays, 32, of Ripley, Tenn.; Capt.

Acknowledgement ofignorance 
Undoubtedly, it will be one of the largest constitu­
tional controversies ever seen. The Human Rights 
Amendment has been introduced into Congress and 
will soon become one ofthe biggest fights ofthis politi­
cal year. Already, groups are forming in support and op­
position to this amendment prohibiting abortion in this 
country. 

In fact, quite recently I received an unsolicited letter 
from Planned Parenthood and their patron, Katherine 
Hepburn asking for support for their efforts opposing 
this law-to-be. In reading their letter I realized how 
much really was at stake in this controversy. 
Throughout the letter, Planned Parenthood referred to those supporting the Human Rights Amendment as "people who hold deep religious beliefs" who wish to "foist (their) personal religious beliefs· on the rest of us." I am not one with any deep religious beliefs, at least any which are conventional. I am Catholic, but that has not played a major part in the way I have made up my mind on this issue. I hope that I have used my common sense. 
The decision to have or perform an abortion has al­ways been a decision that has been allowed or prohibited by a law. As all know, these laws and their interpretations have changed greatly over the past few years. The absolute understanding and inter­pretation of such simple words as human and life have befuddled this issue since its conception AS an issue. Unfortunately, with as much science background as I have and wish to have, I really can't add any insight to providing a clear defini­tion for these words. I really can't scientifically say or prove where human life begins. 
And neither can any scien­tist or laymen. WE, AS IN­TELliGENT AS WE ARE, REALLY DO NOT KNOW. The issue of ignorance about defining the start of human life has never really entered into the arguments pro or against abortion. Luckily, President Reagen just yesterday brought this issue into light at his news con­ference. After all the debate, after all the research, and after all the millions of abortions performed, man can still not define what is meant by human life and where in the process ofhuman gestation this life begins. 
Ignorance, most certainly, is frightening and must be corrected. But our understanding and final answers on this matter are far away. Thereore, we have only our common sense to rely on at the present time. Since we do not know when life begins, the only possible, humane, and logical assumption is really making no as­sumption at all. No one can ARBITRARILY define life as beginning at two weeks, fourteen weeks, or nine months. Any decision on_ defining a time when life begins must be as scientifically absolute as possible. 
Thus, we must simply say that abortions are not to be 
allowed until we can PROVE when human life begins. 
Until further evidence can substantiate a specific point 

during gestation that a fetus becomes a human being, we can only safely assume that human life begins at con­ception. 
The answers to all ofthe questions surrounding abor­tion will be found in defining human life and where it begins. The questions of freedom of choice, women's prerogative, and the like are consequently absurd in this light. Iflife is proven to to begin at conception, the choice boils down to whether to commit pre-meditated murder or not. If life begins at conception, there are no choices, since none will exist. Arbitrarily stating that life commences at any time after conception is such a tremendous gamble with human life. No one has the right to make such an ignorant gamble. We must simply say that conception is the point where human life 
begins. We cannot assume otherwise; there is too much at stake to lose when the final answers are someday revealed. 
The belief that life begins at conception is arbitrary. There is no real, hard scien­tific evidence to prove it beyond a shadow ofa doubt. Yet it does not involve any assumptions which later might be found to be mur­derous as new knowledge on human life is presented. To say life begins at concep­tion might be shown to be 
wrong in the future (although I doubt it), but at least the fact that we were wrong will be a knowledge 

with which we can live.

Meat shortage 


Food price hike in Poland 

WARSAW, Poland (AP) -Com­munist Poland's martial law govern­ment announced that f<>od prices would go up Feb. I, and warned of a drastic shortage of meat. 
The government daily, Rzec­zypospolita, said that purchases of animals for slaughter for January was 400,000 tons, 180,000 tons less than the same period in 1981. 
Authorities also said police in southwestern Warsaw uncovered an "illegal" Solidarity printing press and lcatlc:ts calling for "insubordination and undertaking activities against the government of Poland." 
The report was an implicit warn­ing for rebel unionists to cease their actions. 
President Reagan said U.S. economic sanctions against the Soviet Union have had an impact, but that the martial law situation in Poland is still inadequate. "We're not going to wait forever for im­provement in the situation there," 

Dr. Peter Rich discusses fundamental evolution 
Bv BILL O'BRIEN 
News Staff 
The evolution theories ofSpencer 
and Darwin arc consistent with the 
fundamentals of design, according 
to Dr. Peter Rich. 
The designer is the creator and 
the designee is the current design in 
nature, or the state of evolution of 
the organism, he explained. 
Rich began the Biology Depart­
ment's weekly seminarseries yester­
day afternoon with his lecture 
entitled, "Darwin, Spencer, and the 
19th Century Origins ofEcology." 
Spencer and Darwin's theories of evolution, Rich believes, arc consis­tent with these fundamentals of design. Spencer believed that the "ultimate unknowable" created mat­ter and energy which evolved by persistence of force from merely physical principles into chemical, biological and eventually social principlc:s. Spencer is also well known for his contributions to sociology, Rich added. 
A more conventional theory of 
evolution is related to Darwin's 
beliefs. Ukc Spepcer, he believed in 
a singular creator but gradually 
moved away from this, toward 
modern science's atheistic convic­
tions; that is, evolution can be ex­
plained without a spiritualistic 
force. 
Spencer maintained that there 
wa.~ indeed some unknown inspira­
tion but, Rich emphasized, "its insig­
nificance, according to Spencer, was 
comparable: to the difference be­
twc:rn a termite and a jet airplane."

Double bassist Mark Bernat ofthe University of Texas will be presented in concert by the Univer­sity Artist Series at Notre Dame at 
8: I'; p.m. Tues. Oan.l9) The program in the Annenberg Auditorium of the Snltc: museum of Art Is open to the public with tickets, pricrd at S2 and SI, available at the 
door. 
The Polish-born musician was ed­ucated In Israel and the U.S. and earned the position of principal bas­sist with the Jerusalem Symphony. He has been a winner of the Julliard School's double bass competition and has taught at the Rubin Academy 
of Music in Israel. 
Currently a professor of music in Texas, he has taught at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music and the Shawnigan Summer School of Music in British Columbia 
This is the first of six concerts planned by the Artist Series for the spring semester. Ten concerts were held during the fall semester. 
Darwin's philosophy of evolution was deductive. It studied the relationship and mutual effects be­tween organisms and their environ­ment. There was no movement of the environment as in Spencer's theoretical model. Evolution resulted from excess fertility, struggle for existence, mutation, and natural selection. 
Rich concluded by stating that "science has gotten beyond Darwin. It is now more objective and explicit about evolution." 
Reagan said yesterday in a nationally-televised press con­ference. Reagan did not spell out ad­ditional steps that might be taken. 
Price hikes sparked riots in Gdansk and ncar Warsaw in 1970, at central Radom in 1976, and in 1980 launching the now-suspended inde­pendent union Solidarity. ' 
The price hikes will be the first opportunity to gauge the measure of control of martial law, declared in Poland on Dec. 13 to halt what was seen by authorities as economic and social chaos. 
Some workers who have contacts with Solidarity expect to calmly protest such steep price hikes. 
But many Poles are apathetic. ·~we went through so many things that we are not thteatened or afraid and there is no other way but to adjust." 
The price hikes, if implemented, will boost the cost of pork, ham, cheese, and butter from 200 to 280 percent. 
The government, while admitting that the hikes are steep, said in an open letter that the hikes were necessary because previous at­tempts to raise prices had been rolled back under public pressure. "The fact that it had been put off many times in the past for political reasons was one deepening economic disequilibrium," the offi­cial letter said.

The president, wearing a blue suit, spoke in the East Room ofthe White House. 
Asked about the criticism ofReps. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., and Trent Lou, R­Miss., about his coming budget plan and possible increases in excise taxes, Reagan said their displeasure was based on speculation and press repoJ:!s. "I'm going to have to have a little talk with them," he said. 
The president refused to answer a question about whether he would like Paul Volcker to resign as chair­man of the Federal Reserve Board. Deputy White House press secretary Larry Speakes said later that in avoid­ing a positive or negative response, the president "wasn't calling for Volcker's resignation."

Speakes said that the president has given money to "worthy, needy in­dividuals" and that it has amounted to "roughly 10 percent" of his income. Speakes also said the presi­
dent did  not  intend to  make any  
names public.  
Reagan  declined  to  make  an  

opening statement, saying that he first planned to do so, "but I decided that what I was going to say needed to get a lot ofattention so I'm going to wait and leak it." 
On the Middle East, Reagan said the issue ofautonomy for the Pales­tinians is "the toughest question" concerning U.S. policy. Israel is scheduled to complete its withdrawal from the Sinai on April 25, and Palestinian autonomy talks between Israel and Egypt are stalled. Reagan said that "we want to help if we can. We won't set a deadline, but we are hopeful that at least by the Sinai (withdrawal) time they get down to a plan for proceeding." 
Asked whether his opposition to abortion would be altered if one of his daughters became pregnant as a result of rape, Reagan said he would not answer in personal terms. But he said when he was governor of California, such an exception to an anti-abortion law became "a gigantic loophole." He went on to say that "abortion is the taking of a human life," and he would be "hesitant" to &anction it even in cases of rape. 


Book suggests Jesus married , staged own crucifiction 
LONDON (AP)-Church leaders are angry and most critics unimpressed by a book suggesting 

. Jesus married, staged the crucifixion and has living descendents. 
But the public today was snapping up copies of "The Holy Blood and The Holy Grail." 
Marilyn Edwards, spokeswoman for publishers Jonathan Cape Ltd., called the book's sales "really phenomenal." She said two printings had been sold out by Monday, the first day of publication, and another printing ofover I0,000 had been or­dered. 
London bookstores that ordered 200 and 300 copies priced at SI 7 apiece were reporting their stock exhausted by firstday sales, she said. The book goes on sale in the United States in February. 
The book -by British writer and filmmaker Henry Lincoln, 51, American novelist Richard Leigh, 39, and New Zealand researcher Michael Baigent, 34, is based on more than I 0 years of research, including what the authors say are newly discovered and deciphered documents that shed new light on medieval history. 
The essence oftheir contention is tat a secret society called the Prieure de Sion was founded in the IIth cen­tury, and from that day until this, has been protecting Jesus' descendents 

·to prepare the way for his return to power through the accession of his divine offspring. 
Building upon t that thesis, the authors propose that the reason jesus had descendents was that he married Mary Magdalene, had at least one child by her and survived the crucifixion with the help of his disciples and Roman co­conspirators. 
The book suggests Mary and her children fled to southern France, where their descendents' bloodline mingled with that of the Franks and came down through the Merovin­gian kings of the Middle Ages to modern European noble houses. jesus' fate was more obscure, but he was likely to have fled the· Middle East, it says. 
Speaking for the Roman Catholic 
Church, the Rev. John Crowley, 
private secretary to Roman Catholic 
Cardinal Basil Hume, said "The 
thesis is incredible in the most literal 
sense."

mentator Barry Norman asked sar­

Teenage killers 
Court refuses death penaltyban 
WASHINGTON (AP) The 
Supreme Court refused to ban the 
death penalty for teen-age killers, 
but admonished state judges to use 
more caution in sentencing. 
The 5-4 decision left open the question of whether imposing the death penalty on teen-age killers vi­olates the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment. 
"The court ordered a new sen­tence hearing in Oklahoma for Monty Lee Eddings, who gunned down Oklahoma State Trooper Larry Crabtree in Tulsa, after running away from his Camdenton, Mo., home. 
Court records show that Eddings had deep emotional problems and said he was severely beaten by his stepfather. 
The Court said the trial judge had failed to give enough weight to Ed­dings' turbulent, early years as the "mitigating" factor in deciding whether to sentence him to death or life in prison. "Courts must consider all relevant, mitigating evidence and weigh it against circumstances," the opinion said. 
"We note that Oklahoma statutes permit the defendant to present evidence "as to any mitigating fac­
tors and requue me sentencer to lis­
ten," Powell told the lower courts. · Eddings could be sentenced again 
to death at the new proceeding. The 
court's decision did not affect Ok­lahoma's death penalty. 
The most recent figures indicate that as of last May more than 800 inmates on death rows across the na­tion were under 18. 
Joining Powell in the majority were Sandra Day O'Connor, William ]. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and john Paul Stevens. 
Chiefjustice Warren E. Burger led the dissenters, joined by justices Blackmun and Rehnquist. 

Government report 





Econotny shows no Decetnber gain 
WASHINGTON (AP) 
Americans' incomes rose less in 
December than in any month since 
early 1980, the government 
reported yesterday, giving little en­
couragement that consumers might 
somehow quickly spend the nation 
out ofthe recession. 
In a separate report, the govern­
ment said housing starts rebounded 
substantially in December but not 
enough to keep starts for all of 1981 
from the lowest level in 35 years. 
December's 0.2 percent gain in personal income was the smallest since the 0. 1 percent in April 1980, one of the worst months of that year's recession. 
Americans managed to increase their personal consumption spend­ing a moderate 0. 7 percent in December, but it would be difficult for them to continue such spending without bigger income gains. 
For all of 1981, the Commerce Department report said, personal income rose 11.3 percent -all but about two percentage points eaten away by inflation. The 1980 gain had been I l. 1 percent. 
Personal consumption spending rose 11.1 percent for the year, up from the 10.7 percent of 1980. · 
But with income now rising little, business officials may well continue to have trouble selling their products and will have little in­centive to resume full production or hire back laid-off workers. 
Added to earlier reports that in­dustrial production sank and un­employment soared in December, the new income figures made it clear that last month was the worst so far in the 1981-82 recession. 
Another one or two months of negative reports are expected. But most economists still say the worst maybe over. 
Private analyst Sandra Shaber of Chase Econometrics said yesterday she's sticking with that forecast. She said such big industries as autos and housing are so depressed that "they probably have hit bottom" and should rebound at least a bit with in-

Complaints continue asphones malfunction 
By ROBERT MAROVICH 
News Staff 
Students recently have complained about consistently receiving busy-signals when dialing the 9 exchange for off-campus and long distance phone calls. 
According to switchboard operator janice VanMele, there were some malfunctions with the 9 extension, but that has not been the problem. Rather, the problem has been twofold. 
Because ofthe new 239 exchange, she said, students have to dia19 first to receive these numbers. The double call load due to the 239 exchange could be relieved by the addition ofanother 9-level trunk, or switchboard, but VanMele said that there has been "no indication that they will be adding any more."

A trip to the dentist

Eve is fairly popular. "What'd you

do? Did you have fun?" like the 
answers to all other pleasantries, 
most people make something up, 
either because they can't remember 
or they didn't do anything. After­
wards, they talk about it like it was 
the v.rcatest night of their life. For­
tunately, I don't have to think very 
hard t(>r a story because my New 
Year's was one of the most 
memorable ever, but not for the 
right reasons. 
It all started the night before at a bar ncar my house. I was sitting with a couple of my friends, shooting the breeze, when .the topic of the next day's activities came up. A friend named Paul was talking about going to the liquor store the next morning to stock up for a party he was having. 
"Hey Robert, you want to come with me? I'm going to need some Upon arrival, I was grabbed and placed in a chair. My dentist came in and started jacking me up with what seemed like enough novacaine to immobilize a very large hip­popotamus. He then kindly in­formed me that "you shouldn'tfeel a thing, this is the most painlessopera­tion in the world." I began to relax, thinking that maybe it wouldn't be that bad after all. 
Thinking it was just a preliminary exploration, I closed my eyes and relaxed, pr.eparing myself for the coming ordeal. Suddenly, I felt something clamp onto one ofmy rear teeth and give a huge tug. An electric bolt ofwhite hot pain shot through my jaw and I uttered a gur­gling scream ofprotest. 
"I guess the novacaine hasn't taken yet," my dentist quite astutely' observed. After administering a few more shots, he went to work on an­other tooth. I couldn't feel anything on this one and he merrily dug into it, hacking and smashing anything in his way. I actually started to drift off for a while, oblivious to the carnage being wreaked in my mouth. I was brought back by a shout from my dentist. 
"Oh my God! Don't do that! Not there, not there! Oh for Pete's sake, tors, prys, and other engines of destruction. The force ofthe removal was so great, that I was 

being lifted out ofthe chair and 
thrown around. My dentist paused, 
took a deep breath, and heaved with 
all his might. The incredible stress 
my jaw was under began to cut 
through the anesthetic fog and a dull 
throb bagan to grow in my head. My 
dentist was grunting with exertion. 
"C'mon you son ofa ..." With a 
sickening crunch, the tooth ex­
ploded into enamel shrapnel, 
ricocheting offthe roofofmy mouth 
and the back of my teeth. My head 
slammed back and my mouth quick­
ly filled with blood. 
The other teeth weren't as bad, 
comingout with little difficulty. The 
last one, though, still hadn't taken 
the novocaine. I promptly informed 
my dentist of this with several kid­
ney punches which he deftly 
dodged, still pushing the screaming 
drill deeper into the tooth. He later 
informed me that the teeth come 
out easier ifyou break them up with 
a drill first. Thanks, doc. 
That night at my pal's, I sat sullen­

"Who got you an appointment on New Year's Eve?" another friend asked in disbelief. 
"My mom made it while I was at school, and when I got home for Christmas, it was too late to change it," I replied sheepishly. Another burst oflaughter erupted, followed by a series ofjokes about making out with me at midnight and using my soon-to-be-swollen cheeks as festive decorations.

Frigid weather takes toll on returnee 
T
he day before I returned from Christmas Break was spent driving 
around Phoenix, Arizona, in 75-degree weather. It was january 
I 0, 1982, the day when the wind-chill factor in Chicago pulled the 
temperature down to eighty below zero and numerous Notre Dame 
students were forced to spend the night in the windy city. 
The weather there was national news, and so I was forewarned of 
the oncoming danger. I quickly packed my thermal underwear, said 
my last goodbyes, and departed for the Golden Dome. 
Only one ofthe stewardesses on American Airlines was as cute as 
the ones on the commercials, so I was not disappointed to finally 
land at O'Hare International Airport on that cold, cloudy evening. 
My itinerary called for taking United Limo from Chicago to South 
Bend, and I found myselfwaiting along with eighty other school­
bound students, many ofwhom had spent the night before in 
Chicago because of the 
weather. The temperature 
was forty below, counting wind-chill, and I, audacious as 
arc amirez 
I am, dared to step outside. The limo was scheduled to arrive in fifteen minutes, and so I figured the wait wouldn't be too bad. 
When my toes began to stiffen and become numb, I wasn't worried. But fifteen minutes became halfan hour and then forty-five minutes. My ears had just frozen over when the first limo pulled up-­with room for eleven riders. The driver looked at us all and had to laugh. We must have looked like a herd ofcattle, but we felt like eighty frozen sides ofbeef. I didn't make the first limo in the stam­pede that followed, but instead opted to wait for the next one which was "right behind this one." The arctic weather had caused my legs to become·stiffnow; however, I still was not worried. Afriend waiting with me made a sarcastic comment about the climate, and I smiled. Ten minutes later I was still smiling. When my friend in­quired as to the reason for my everlastinggrin, I explained that my fa­cial muscles had frozen in place. It was then that I decided that it was time to wait inside, crowd or no crowd. I darted for the nearest building, savored the warmth within, and five minutes later, a limo bus with room for forty-seven riders pulled up. Fortunately, I made it aboard this time around. 
Buzz, a short-haired ROTC friend of mine, assisted me with the task oftransporting my luggage to the dorm through the fierce bliz­zard that we encountered. Along the way he told me ofthe joys of snow, ofdiesel trucks and trailers, jackknifing, and ofsnow emer­gencies. By the time we reached my room, I felt like collapsingonto my bed out ofexhaustion. I dropped the bags I was carrying, took off my coat, and headed toward the comfort ofthe bunkbed mattress. An arm whirled me around, and it was Buzz. 
"Come on, Marc!" he said with a huge smile decorating his face. "Come say hi to everybody! Tell them you're here!" 
The rest ofthe night is a mystery to me. Escorted by Buzz, I paraded around in zombie-like fashion, reacclimating myself to the trials and tribulations ofdormitory life. 
It was harder getting used to going to school again. I fell asleep in my first science class. I forgot how early I had to leave in order to get to O'Shag in time for philosophy. I couldn't remember my way around the library. 
My first Saturday night back came as a welcome conclusion to the first week, and despite our weekly blizzard, it was great. At midnight I found myselfstarvingand decided that it was time for my tradition­al trek to the Oak Room. Thoughts ofa hot juicy Oakburger with cheese were dancing in my mind until I discovered that the Oak Room was closed due to the weather. My dreams were shattered, and I was mildly upset. I cooled offby Sunday afternoon and told myself, "Oh, that's okay. Ifit's hard enough to walk across campus in this weather, then we shouldn't expect people from off-campus to come work here." 
Suddenly, a brilliant thought flashed in front of me. "Wait a minute!" I cried. "Teachers live off-campus too! Ifthe Oak Room is closed, then maybe...!" 
Classes were held on Monday as scheduled, my Calculus homework and four-page essay in Comp. & Lit. were still due, and the Dining Halls were open as always. The Golden Dome stood out defiantly against the cloudy sky as if it were a symbol that neither hail, nor rain, nor sleet, nor snow can keep this university from operating as usual. 
It's great to be back, isn't it?

terics. I sat back down in my chair, my depression deepening. The final insult came at midnight when I received more than twenty hand­shakes and hugs from every female there to bringin the NewYear. The I couldn't even drink fast enough through a straw to get drunk, so I wallowed soberly in my misery all night. 
Memorable? By all means, yes. I probably will never forget it. Fun? Debatable. -My friend eventually ended up spending New Years Eve in the apartment watching Manlyn Chamber's in­credibly dramatic performance in that classic film, "Behind the Green Door." They also memorized the entire dialogues from the "Blues Brothers" and "Animal House." Good times.

DECIMATION -As if the schedule was not bad enough, Digger 
Phelps is even having a problem putting two full squads on the court 
during practice. The loss offreshman Dan Duff and sophomore Tom 
Sluby has shaved the Irish roster to seven scholarship athletes and 
three walk-ons, which adds up to ten total bodies. Duff chipped a 
bone in his right ankle against Virginia and will remain in a cast for 
three weeks before beginning a rehabilitation period. Sluby was 
declared academically ineligible for the second semester. 
Injuries, grades and a variety ofother circumstances have caused 
Phelps to shuffie his lineup extensively this season. The most recent 
starting five Oohn Paxson, Mike Mitchell, Tim Andree, Barry Spen­
cer and Bill Varner) represent the sixth different lineup Phelps has 
drawn up. 
TWILIGHT ZONE -Saturday's Maryland game, originally slated 
for a 1:30 p.m. start has been pushed back to 8 p.m. on Saturday. The 
time change was made so that the Metrosports network co t uld in­
clude this game on itsschedule ofNotre Dame contests this season. 
TICKETS PLEASE -A few upper arena seats still remain for the 
Maine game on january 27 and Northern Iowa on March 2. The tick­
ets are priced at S4.50 and are available at the Gate 10 box office of 
the ACC. The rest of Notre Dame's home games this !!Cason arc sold 
out. 
VANDALS RUN RAMPANT -When Notre Dame entertains the Idaho Vandals on Monday night, don't be surprised to see a lot of Vandal boosters in the stands, via Chicago. It seems that Tom Green, the sports director at radio station WCLR-FM in the Chicago suburb of Skokie, started mentioning the exploits of the Idaho team as a humorus addition to his broadcasts. 
But the Vandals soon climbed into the national rankings, and the joke has become a full-fledged booster can1paign. Idaho's sports in­formation director sent pictures and programs ofthe team to Green, remarking that Idaho fans thought it was great that Skokie, a town without a team, had adopted theirs. 
"It started out as a joke at first, but now people here are really seriousabout It," said Green. "They want Vandal T-shirts, sweatshirts and buttons. And some of them plan to travel to South Bend for the game between Idaho and Notre Dame. We picked up on this team because no one else would have it and no one else knew it existed. Now we're even putting the Idaho fight song on the air." 
Irish guardjohn Paxson fires shot that tied the score at 46 in Notre Dame's game against Villanova. Paxson scored 20 points and dealt outfour assists in losing effort.(Photo by Rudy Perez)

It was a pretty fair Christmas present for Digger Phelps, though it came a day late. 
Tim Kempton came, not wrapped in a bow, but with a flourish of green ink. The 6-9 inch 225 pound forward from Oyster Bay, N.Y. became the fourth high school star to sign an institutional letter of intent to attend Notre Dame. He also becomes the latest member of what is shaping up to be a recruiting class that will, by the time it winds up its collective career here, rival the class that brought you Orlando Woolridge, Kelly Tripucka, Tracy Jackson and Gilbert Salinas. 
Kempton will be joined by 6-I 0 center Ken Barlow of 
Indianapolis, and 6-8 shooting forward Jim Dolan in a 
"Who's Who ofHigh School Stars-1982" that will play 
up front for Phelps in the years to come. 
"I want to see once and for all if it can be done with 
good kids, if it can be done without cheating," Phelps 
says. 

"It" ofcourse, is a national championship. That is the 
goal at the beginning ofevery season for Phelps, even at 
the beginning ofthis one. It's the goal toward which the 
I 1 th year coach began trudging once again when 
Tripucka, Woolridge and Jackson took their acts to the 
NBA. 

"I'm looking for one more kid," he says. "I'll take the 
five, work with them, teach them, and go for it all again 
down the road somewhere." 

But not all of Phelps' plans are as distant. 
"If ever a young person belongs at Notre Dame, it's 
Tim Kempton -because of his spirit, his enthusiasm 
and his personality," Phelps says. "He's going to step in 
and help us right away. 

"People forget that we are losing just one player from 
this year's team. We are young and inexperienced now, 
but we'll be back with an extra year of maturity under 
our belts next year. Believe me, losing as many games as 
we have builds maturity quickly." 
Phelps hit the recruiting trail harder than ever before this past summer and it paid off. For the first time, he went shopping in his own backyard, recruited heavily in Indiana, and that paid off as well. 
Along with Barlow, Phelps signed 6-5 swingman Joe Price of Marion, Ind. and has his eye on the state's best player, Valparaiso guard Roger Hardin. · 
"We feel Barlow has the potential to be an Orlando 
Woolridge or Toby Knight type," Phelps says. "He and 
Kempton will give us the immediate size we need up 
front. 

"Joe Price is an excellent shooter, a player in the 
mold of Tracy Jackson. Jim Dolan is a pure shooting 
forward who is great when you need him down the 
stretch in a ballgame. He gets the key rebound, and hits 
the important shots under pressure." 
Clearly the future is much brighter than the present 
for Irish basketball fortunes. Tim Andree will get the 
help he needs up front in the rebounding department. 
The pressure to apply strength underneath will be off 
Barry Spencer, Bill Varner, Cecil Rucker and Tom Sluby. 



A full Xmas stocking for Digger 

John Paxson will be able to team with Dan Duff, Ron Rowan, Price, Varner or Sluby in the backcourt. 
Once again, Notre Dame will have the depth that has been its trademark en route to eight consecutive NCAA tournament appearances. 
"This has been a great recruiting year so far," Phelps concedes. "We've really helped ourselves in the area we needed it the most. We got two big men with the muscle we need underneath. We got a great outside shooter who can also play power forward. We've got another shooter who can play either guard or forward. And we're not done yet." 
A guard the caliber of Valpo's Hardin, or John Daw­kins of Mackin High in Washington, D.C. would make Phelps' dream team complete. He would have an entire team of experienced players who would have played together through their whole college career, and he'd be ready to make a serious run at the national cham­pionship with those players by the spring of 1986. 
That, admittedly, is a long way off. But the prospects are looking up for the immediate future as well. 
Picture this starting lineup for opening day, 1982. 
Tim Andree ( 6-I0)at center. Tim Kempton (6-9)and Barry Spencer (6-7) at forward. John Paxson (6-3) and Bill Varner ( 6-7) at guard. 
Offthe bench you have Cecil Rucker (6-9), Ken Bar­low ( 6-1 0) and Jim Dolan ( 6-8) to play up front. You also have Ron Rowan ( 6-5 ), Joe Price ( 6-5 ), Dan Duff (6-0) and Tom Sluby ( 6-4) in the backcourt. 
Remember that there is still at least one player to be signed, and you begin to see why Phelps and his assis­tants have such high hopes about the years to come. 
"How can I get down," Phelps asks. "Sure, we're having an off year, but there is so much to look forward to. Everybody has a bad year now and then. 
These things have a tendency to run in cycles. In the early 1960's, Notre Dame basketball fell on hard times, when 7-16 seasons followed 12-14 seasons. But things turned around, and the Irish were back to 20-win seasons by the middle ofthe decade. 
In the early 1970's, Phelps went through his now­famous 6-20 year, and followed with the greatest years in the program's history. 
Now it's the early 1980's, and hard times have befal­len Notre Dame again. But history will repeat itself, and the basketball team will pull out of the doldrums and back into contention for the national title with the infu­sion ofnew blood. 
"We'll be back," Phelps says with a smile and a wink. "Just ride it out, and watch."
