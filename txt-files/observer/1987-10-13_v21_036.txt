Indiana University installs new president amid pomp 
Associated Press 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -A colorful display of balloons, mimes and jugglers followed the pomp and circumstance of the formal inauguration Mon­day of Thomas Ehrlich as the 15th president of Indiana Uni­versity. 
More than 2,500 people filled the IU auditorium, including representatives of all eight uni­versity campuses, to hear Ehrlich's inaugural address, which was followed by a

"jubilee party" on the lawn outside. 
Ehrlich, 53, assumed respon­sibilities as university presi­dent on Aug. 1, following the retirement of John Ryan, who had led the university for 16 years. He previously had served as provost at the Uni­versity of Pennsylvania. 
Ehrlich's speech and formal investiture capped two days of inaugural events in In­dianapolis and Bloomington. 
In his speech, Ehrlich said the university had a responsi­

bility to teach values to its stu­dents. 
"It is risky business to com­ment on issues of values, but I know no more important ques­tions facing institutions of higher education," he said. "I take the risk with the realiza­tion that those issues will not be resolved at once or for all time. Rather, they are for each generation to confront anew." 
Ehrlich warned against the idea that students who have failed to develop values by the time they leave high school will not develop them.

Immunity research wins Nobel 
Associated Press 
STOCKHOLM, Sweden -Susumu Tonegawa, a Japanese researcher working in the United States, won the Nobel Prize in medicine Monday for discovering how the body makes millions of kinds of an­tibodies to fight disease. 
His findings could help im­prove vaccines and make or­gan transplants safer, said the Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska Institute, which awards the prize. 
Hans Wigzell of the institute said Tonegawa's research also may be significant in fighting such diseases as acquired im­mune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS, which destroys the body's immune system. 
At the Massachusetts In­stitute of Technology in Cambridge, where he has worked since 1981, the 48-year­old Tonegawa told reporters: 
"The problem of how our body can respond to so many different kinds of pathogens was one of the most hotly debated issues in immunology. We did not understand how that happened. 
"It turned out that, contrary to what many people thought, genes can change during the life cycle of the individual. That finding was unexpected to many, and yet it answered one of the mysteries of immunol­ogy." 
Asked what impact his work might have on AIDS research, the scientist said: "what we have done and.are doing is not designed specifically to solve the problem of AIDS, but it's probable that the information we get will be useful in solving it." 
Wigzell, a professor of im­munology, said Tonegawa's work could play an important role in understanding diseases such as AIDS, but "it would be too simple" to say there was an immediate bearing on fin­ding a cure for the deadly dis­ease. 
Tonegawa, the first Japanese to receive the medicine prize, "answered a question that has been debated for years: how can the body's 100,000 genes produce a billion different an­tibodies?" said Goran Holm, a member of the Nobel Assem­bly. 

Antibodies are important tools in identifying viruses and bacteria that invade the body, and in preparing the immune system for attacking the in­truders. Each is targeted by nature on an invading virus or bacteria. 
Tonegawa's research helped clarify how the immune system sometimes produces faulty an­tibodies that cause allergies. 
"My own experiences, both in and out of the classroom, convince me that a university education can and should in­clude values, not through in­culcation but through both in­tellectual inquiry and example," he said. 
Reason and respect are not the only moral concepts stu­dents should learn, but they are two of the most important, said Ehrlich. 
"The morality of reason re­quires us to examine an issue, to break it into its component parts, to analyze each of those parts and then to reconstruct them through careful consider­ation of premise and conclu­sion." . 

He said that although "every student comes to the university with conceptions and precon­ceptions," they are required to analyze their premises during their studies there. 
"The most important dimen­sion of what our students learn . . . is not information, but a process of self-education through rational inquiry," he said.

Saint Mary's celebrates 143rd Founder's Day 
By COURTNEY JAMIESON News Staff 
Saint Mary's will celebrate the 143rd Annual Founder's Day today with a series of events including a 4 p.m. five kilometer fun run and a special dinner at the dining hall. 
Founder's Day is tradi­tionally celebrated in honor of the College's founders, one of whom is Father Ed­ward Sorin, Notre Dame's founder. The Saint Mary's event is celebrated on Sorin's feast day, said Mary Carol Cahill, commissioner of traditional events. 
Cahill said Founder's Day is also celebrated in honor of the present student body for helping shape the future of Saint Mary's tradition. 
"We have tried to update the event into something you wouldn't normally think Founder's Day to be with such events as the fun run," Cahill said. 
Other events scheduled for the celebration include the opening of the new "Club Tuesday" in Haggar College Center, Cahill said. Enter­tainment at Club Tuesday will be provided by singer­comedian Brian Huskey, she said, adding that all students will receive a book on facts about the College. 
"The day's events should be enjoyable for everyone in the Saint Mary's communi­ty," Cahill said. 
Sophomore Sue Leto said she feels Founder's Day "is a very special tradition in the Saint Mary's Communi­ty."

I had the assignment of covering soccer at the Special Olympics. 
Chile had beaten Argentina in the first round of the tournament, and I wanted to talk to a Chilean player who scored three goals. 
However, there was one problem with inter­viewing the player -he only spoke Spanish. I told the interpreter to stay near, but that I wanted to try speaking to him on my own first. 
"Soy reportero para un periodico," I intro­duced myself to the player, a forward by the name of Francisco Salas. 
I wanted to ask him about a play in which he took a beautiful pass from a fellow forward and scored the game's second goal. 
Describe Ud. por favor el seugn gol." I didn't know if the grammar was correct, but Fran­cisco proceeded to describe the play with both words and hand movements. 
I was glad he used his hands because the words were hard for an Intermediate Spanishstudent to understand. 
I tried another question, testing my ability to communicate in Spanish. "Practica Ud. el fut­bol todos los dias?" I asked. 
He said no. 

"Cuantos dias en una semana practica Ud. ?" "Cuatro," Fransisco noted, Pero en el mes pasado, seis." The team upped its practice schedule from four to six practices a week. 
This short conversation not only gave me ma­terial for an article, but also gave me a different perspective of the Olympics. 
There are hundreds of stories from this past summer's Special Olympic Games. 
Most of the stories tell tales of courage and pride as the athletes overcome handicaps to perform the best they can. 
Other stories explained how spectators of the Olympics no longer looked at these athletes as being special, but just as competitors. 
I think there is another story besides the "spe­cial" nature of the athletes. I was amazed by the collection of athletes from around the world, all gathered in this small city in northern In­diana. 
From San Moreno to San Mateo, from Morocco to Mexico, athletes arrived from 80 different countries to compete in the largest Special Olympics ever. 
At the soccer venue, teams from Chile, Ar­gentina, Barbados, Mexico, and several other Spanish-speaking countries were among the featured competition. 
I saw my job as an opportunity. 
I had taken Spanish in high school and here 
at Notre Dame, but I had never had the chance

to use the language in situations other than tests and quizzes. There were interpreters available, but I wanted to see if I could communicate with these teams on my own. 
I was nervous. 
My past schooling included three years of high-school Spanish. I had the same teacher for two of those years, and he covered not only grammar, but also the customs and traditions of the Spanish-speaking countries. He was a good teacher, and he kept my interest in the language. 
Spanish would not fit into my schedule my senior year, and the schedule for math majors at Notre Dame does not include a foreign lan­guage until sophomore year. 
So after a two-year break, I took an inter­mediate Spanish class. 
It wasn't the same. With physics and math classes to worry about, Spanish took a back seat. The grammar became more intricate, and I did not·speak the language well. 
Part of the reason for the change is the fact that, outside of the classroom, I never got to use what I learned in the classroom. 
After a certain point of schooling, you have to practice using Spanish in ordinary conversa­tion so that the language doesn't appear to be just a set of grammatical rules. 
At the Special Olympics I finally had my chance.

Hurricane Floyd strikes Florida, but then fizzles 

Associated Press 
MIAMI -Hurricane Floyd sprang to life in the Gulf of Mexico early Monday, hitting south Florida with 80 mph wind and heavy rain. Some coastal residents scurried for shelter, while others cleared stores of batteries, canned food and bottled water. 
But by Monday evening the eye had all but disappeared, the National Hurricane Center

reported, and winds dropped slightly to 75 mph. 
"There's no well-defined storm," said forecaster Bob Sheets, "I'm afraid some people are overreacting. This is just barely a hurricane." 
The center Monday evening cancelled hurricane warnings on the state's southwestern coast, maintaining them only on the eastern coast from Stuart, north of West Palm Beach, to Key Largo. 

Floyd grew from a tropical storm to become the season's third hurricane. 
It began heading up through the Florida Keys toward south­ern Dade County at the south­ern tip of the mainland, spawn­ing at least two tornadoes. 
The storm's central eye passed directly over Key West between noon and 1p.m., bring­ing a brief and eerie calm to the island, and began heading up the Overseas Highway that strings the islands together.

SMC board lists 'Day's' events 
By MIMI TUOHY Staff Reporter 
The events for today's Foun­der's Day celebration at Saint Mary's were announced Mon­day night at the programming board meeting by Senior Smith Hashagen, vice president of student affairs. 
Events for the annual Foun­der's Day celebration include a special dinner at Saint Mary's dining hall, a fun run at 4 p.m., and the grand opening of "Club Tuesday" marking the southernmost point of the continental United States. 
"The water is not flowing off the island, it's all flowing in," said Key West Councilwoman Sally Lewis. "It's really very dramatic." 
A hurricane-spawned tor­nado hit Key Largo, knocking out electrical power and causing $100,000 damage to boats, trailers and mobile homes $100,000 damage. An­other touched down in extreme southern Dade County. No in­juries were reported.

"Brian Huskey is very enjoy­able. This is a great study break, especially during weeks like this one which are filled with tests," Hashagen said. 
In other business, Off­Campus Commissioner Jill Simonic said that pizza will be 
served to all of the off-campus students in the Day Student lounge today from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m.

Sheets said Floyd would probably maintain its minimal hurricane strength as it passed just south of Miami during the evening and then would head out to sea. 
By early evening, more than 200 people had filtered into an American Red Cross shelter in Homestead, south of Miami, said coordinator Gail Dia­mond. 
Turnout was low in the other 10 shelters in Dade County, said county spokeswoman Tawana Thompson. 
Mary Carol Cahill, tradi­tional events commissioner, announced last week's Fall Fest events were extremely successful, with 600 students at last Thursday's Beer Gardens, and 300 participated in the events at Haggar College Cen­ter on Wednesday. 
"I was extremely happy with the tremendous response we had. It was a great way to start off the social events for the up­coming year," Cahill said. 
Before adjourning, Has­hagen said that two alumni will be on campus speaking about their particular careers. 
Kathleen Hessert Gunder­man, the president of Career Concepts will appear in Haggar Parlor on Oct. 28, and Kathleen Flynn Fox will discuss her po­sition as vice-president of Carousel Restaurant Group in Stapleton Lounge on Nov. 4.

ND may host Ivy in 
By MICHELLE DALL 
News Staff 
A national interhall football championship between Notre Dame, Harvard, Yale, and one of the U.S. service academies has been proposed by Notre Dame's student government. 
Student government Athletic Commissioner Brian Padian said he became interested in the idea after he was ap­proached by John VVilson, former student life coordinator at Notre Dame. 
Padian said he has developed a prosposal to send to the prospective schools but that he has not contacted them yet. 
Originally, six teams were to participate in a full contact football championship hosted by Notre Dame. 
But financial difficulties have troubled plans for the championship thus far, limit­ing the number of participating teams to only four and delaying the event, said Padian. 
"Right now, we don't have enough money in our budget to host the event alone, so we're hoping the (Office of Non­Varsity Athletics) will sponsor it," Padian said. 
The NVA may be hesitant to sponsor the event, said Padian, because Notre Dame varsity football has a much larger fol­lowing than it did last year, when the idea was first pro­posed. 
Notre Dame will host the three other schools, so money is needed to fly players and coaches into South Bend and to QrOVide them with food and

lodging during their stay. 
Another major issue which must be resolved is the manner in which each championship team will be chosen. Padian said two methods of choosing the Notre Dame team are pres­ently being considered. Notre Dame will either be represented by an all-star team consisting of the best players from each male dormitory or the winners of the next inter­hall championship. 
Padian said he hopes to make the game an annual event, and he believes the championship will create a tradition. 
"I think we'll get great press converage, because all four teams are from great aca­demic schools," said Padian, adding, "Once other schoois see the championship, they'll want to get involved too."

Policy improved for accuracy, fairness 
The Observer's editorial board has reviewed its policy of with­holding names of those arrested in coimection with alcohol­related accidents. 
During the past academic year, three students were arrested and charged in separate accidents involving both alcohol and death or injury. In each instance, The Observer withheld the arrested student's name. 
The editorial board decided to review this policy primarily for two reasons. 
The first involves an overriding duty of The Observer as the independent newspaper serving the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's community--to report the facts of an event as accurately and completely as possible. The Observer reported the three alcohol-related accidents, but it did not report all the facts -­The Observer did not publish the names of the students arrested in the accidents. It therefore failed io its service to the commu­nity in ways such as not providing a complete chronicle of the public record and not squelching the possible rumors as to the identity of the student, thus casting doubt on many for the alleged crime of one. 
Also, the editorial board reviewed the policy in the interest of fairness. In compliance with its obligation as a newspaper to follow journalistic standards, The Observer published the names of people charged in other crimes, such as theft, arson and murder. But it did not publish the names of students charged with another serious crime: injuring or killing someone in an alcohol-related accident. Thus, The Observer was remiss in its duty to provide a fair source of news to the community. 
During the past several months, the editorial board has ex­amined all of these factors. It also has taken a hard look at the emotional considerations of seeing one's name in print. 
After much consideration, the editorial board has decided to eliminate its policy of withholding the names of students arrested in alcohol-related accidents. 
This newspaper seeks to report the news as accurately, com­pletely and fairly as possible. The Observer can accomplish this only by doing away with a policy that hinders it in this duty.

P.O. Box Q 
Control must keep tempers in check 
Dear Editor: 
I would like to draw attention to an extracurricular activity that is going on this fall-Women's interhall flag foot­ball. Women's flag football is very com­petitive. I have watched teams practice and play games. As we have at any level of competition, there are teams, which are stronger than others, and there are many obvious reasons why some teams possess advantages. I com­mend coaches and participants on their desire to compete. 
As the season is well underway and the competitiveness of the games grows more intense, we (I include myself this time) sometimes lose our self control in the "heat of the battle." There are going to be times when we lose our com­posure and we will say or do things to­tally unlike our nature. I am referring to an incident that occurred during the flag football game between Lewis and Breen-Phillips. 
At Cartier Field on October 4, in the second half of a very close game, a Breen-Phillips player was running to gain first down yardage on a fourth down play, and upon colliding with a Lewis defender, fell to the turf in pain. Lying on the turf injured and unable to move, the BP player was escorted off the field in an ambulance. The game was delayed for ten or fifteen minutes, and during this time the defender felt sorry for the accidental collision, one of many that happen in games. Finally, at the end of the hard fought game that went into six overtimes, the players and coaches of both teams met at midfield for the customary hand shake. As hands were shook and phrases of "good game" were said, a Breen-Phillips player blurted to me and another coach something to the effect that we (Lewis) got what we wanted by knocking their good player out of the game even though we lost. That statement really surprised us, because the young lady accused the Lewis team of purposely going out to injure a player, whose sister lives in Lewis. I thought that was really rude of her to accuse us of such low behavior. Later after the game, as I went to Mass in Dillon, some repre­sentatives of Breen-Phillips visited the rectress of Lewis. They complained of foul language and other abuses from the coaches and players of Lewis; but I sat in mass saying a special intention for the injured player and for the Breen­Phillips player who made the rude remark. I know the collision was ac­cidental. I am hoping that the young lady only made the rude remark due to the "heat of the battle," but if not, she is representing Breen-Phillips team and herself in the wrong way.

Everybody remembers the confusion of arriving at Notre Dame as a freshman. But im­agine what it's like to be a foreign student, a stranger in a strange land. 
before students arrive. "In the spring the Admissions Office notifies us of who the new foreign students are, and I cor­respond with them to let them know the ins and outs of life in the U.S .. " He also sends stu­dents some general informa­tion on Notre Dame as well as instructions on how to obtain a visa. 
The ISAO later conducts a one-day orientation session for students upon their arrival. In­formation about banking. health insurance, and the li­brary is provided at this meeting. "We introduce stu­dents to services here on countries. 
"They're great," says Pakis­tinian freshman Shahzad As­ghar of his host family, 
"They're like parents for me. I can ring them any time, and 
they can help me." 
International students often have problems with the lan­guage barrier. While classes offering instruction in English as a second language are avail­able on campus, Orubert says that students are expected to be "proficient enough to start in on their work" when they come to Notre Dame. "Students arrive with a certain capability in English, but they really need practice in spoken English," he explains. 
Although he's had eight years of English in school, Austrian graduate student Adolf Boesch hasn't formally studied the lan­guage in eight years. He ad­mits that he's been having some trouble when people speak too quickly: "Sometimes it moves a little too fast for me," he says. 
Orubert maintains that most international students tend to "assimilate into the population with great ease." Some stu­dents, however, come from countries that don't stress En­glish in the schools. 
"Those from the People's Republic of China have to work doubly hard to catch up on their English capabilities. The departments here have been sympathetic, and in the lon!=j run they have good students." 
And, according to Orubert, the entire university benefits from them. "The more interna­tional students are appreciated, the more international our American students will become. I would hope our American students are working to help foreign students into their so­cial circles and use their knowl­edge and scope to their bene­fit."

Responsible drinking
is the key 
both the founding of the club and its philosophy. "From a peer to peer level, we're really concerned about student health and attitudes regarding alco­hol. It's your friend saying. 'Hey I'm concerned about you"', states Verbaro. BACCHUS was inspired and continues to thrive out of this genuine con­cern for one another. 
The basic philosophy upon which BACCHUS was founded is simple. It asks students to make conscious decisions whe­ther to drink or not to drink. If the decision is made to drink. then drinking responsibly is called for. This includes knowing your limits, making. rational decisions, and not driving under the influence of alcohol. 
The other basic point calls for drinkers to respect the views of non-drinkers and non­drinkers to do likewise. The group hopes to make all people comfortable with their 
own personal stand on alcohol, regardless of what that stand might be. 
The attitude towards alcohol at Notre Dame presents a need for a group such as BACCHUS. "At Notre Dame, alcohol is a big deal. It Is such an Issue. It really shouldn't be that way," states Jane Heisel, president of done through communication and education. BACCHUS pro­vides the avenue for both.'' 
They understand that people drink. As stated by Heisel, "Drinking is a part of society. It is fine when done responsibly. Drinking is not wrong in itself-­it is what you do with it that is important." 
Membership is made up of many different types of people. "The group itself is kind of a microcosm of the student body at Notre Dame , " describes Heisel,"It is a good mix of people, not reaching just one type of student." 
The one unifying factor of the members is that they all encourage responsible drink­ing. This, however, does not imply that the members are non-drinkers. The club attracts many varying personalities working towards one goal. 
An obvious sign of BACCHUS' hard work is Alcohol Awareness Week going on this week. It is done in cooperation with the National Collegiate Awareness Week scheduled for October I 9-25. There are a number of activities planned. The goal of the week is to make the campus aware of BACCHUS and what It stands for. 
As Jane Heisel puts It"We want to make people's stereotypes towards BACCHUS go away: to change people's thinking that we are anti­drinking. You can talk commu­nication, but if people are shut­ting us out, what can you do? You are useless. This week will hopefully make us more known around the campus and in­crease our potential effect on the students.''

f Bacchus, the Roman god of wine and revelry, were to appear at Notre Dame today, he might be curious as to why his name is being advertised around campus. In discovering the meaning of all this, he would be very surprised. He would find an organization of youths centered around alco­hol. Centered however, in a way very foreign to Bacchus' previous experiences with alco­hol and its use. 
At Notre Dame, BACCHUS Is a student organization dedi­cated to the education of the Notre Dame community about alcohol use. The group's focus is education about alcohol, not condemnation of it. 
"By any stretch of the im­agination, we are not an anti-

drinking group", says Mike Ver­baro, Alcohol Awareness Week Chairman, "Our goal is to help people make conscious deci­sions whether or not to drink.'' 
In its third year of existence and second year as an official University club, BACCHUS is taking on an enormous job. "We're trying to reach as many groups of people as possible on campus",says Verbaro, "to raise consciousness in the Notre Dame community about the group and about alcohol and its related effects." 

BACCHUS was formed by stu­dents because they saw a need for greater awareness and un­derstanding on the campus. In the wake of the University alco­hol policy instituted in I 984 and all the controversy sur­rounding the policy, BACCHUS' role in University life has taken a greater meaning. 
"The alcohol policy was de­signed to alleviate drinking on campus. It has had its effects. BACCHUS is another way to deal with these effects", says Verbaro. It is the students' means of taking some control of the situation.

Of Cats and Mice u John Sculley wrote a book to be released this month about his experience at Apple computer. In the book, Sculley tells why he fired Steve Jobs and how great the company is doing now. But in the very magazine that has John Sculley's picture on the cover (October's Inc.) is a more subtle chapter of the story: Steve Job's revenge. A Canon advertisement features a new product, the Canon Cat, which is positioned in the office publishing market to compete directly with Apple's "desktop publishing" market. All of Apple's growth has come from desktop publishing, and this area is quickly becoming the beef of their revenues, according to John Frank, president of the third largest com­puter maker, Zenith Data Systems.  
Wholihan and Murray Business Briefs  
According to the advertisement, the Canon Cat is the "brainchild of the originator of the Macintosh computer," i.e. Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs has the opportunity to do serious financial damage to Apple. Apparently, he is playing on that theme. The name "Cat" is one hint. The "mouse" is the major breakthrough of Apple, and thus the mouse symbolizes Apple in many respects. The advertisement further plays on the cat1nouse theme, stating "No menus. No files. No mouse." The Canon Cat does away with all of those standard Apple features through creative inventions of Steve Jobs. With two "leap" keys, the user can move though data in seconds, "the fastest way to move a cursor." With Jobs behind The Cat, it may just leap over Apple's mouse. u Attention Shoppers: This past week, Spiegel, the famous mail-order catalog company went public by issuing six mil­lion shares of common stock. The timing of this stock issue was questionable. The retail sector of the economy has recently been suffering which has been reflected in lower stock prices of retail companies. Spiegel officials expected their stock to be issued at $22 a share. Wall Street's lack of confidence in retailers, however, forced Spiegel to sell its stock for $16 a share. Spiegel has changed its image. They have directed their sales efforts toward working women with high incomes. These consumers have less time to shop, thus finding the catalog convenient to use. This change has allowed Spiegel to double sales since 1982. Earnings also doubled between 1985 and last year. Stockholders may have to wait for the retail slump to end, yet they may find that Spiegel's best bargain is not in the catalog, but is in the stock market.

Unique business methods frustrate U.S. business 
By RENEE GAU 
Business Writer 
In the international market­place, American business has been losing most of its ground to the Japanese. The most readily recognizable causes for this are the devaluation of the dollar, declining productivity, relatively poor product quality, and non-competitive wage rates and quotas. Yet, under­neath these supposed trade­war-induced problems lies the American businesses' inability to adopt to the growing demand for international versatility. 
In US News, Thomas Keller, Dean of the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University, states, "Americans lose out overseas, even when our prod­ucts are strong, because we repeatedly fall into the trap of thinking that what we make and the way we sell here will be received just as well everywhere else." He sites the example of American produc­e'rs shipping cars to Japan with the steering wheel on the wrong side. 
Diana Rowland, in her book "Japanese Business Etiquette" explains that American busi­ness people must never assume that they share other funda­mental similarities with the Ja­panese in business expecta­tions. In fact, the Japanese business world is remarkably different and Americans would benefit by understanding it. 
A Japanese firm can be likened to a close knit network -and connections mean every­thing. The saying "who you know" takes on an even more important meaning in Japan. It is an unwritten rule never to approach a businessman or of­ficial without first being for­mally introduced, usually by 
Golf game vital business tool 
By MICHAEL FAEHNER and MATT CROWLEY Business Columnists 
Who ever said businessmen play golf for fun? 
Contrary to what many non­golfers think, a great deal of work can be accomplished by "beating the little white ball." 
The rationalizations for taking a business client out for the day take many turns. 
First of all, the peaceful en­vironment (often becoming a not so tranquil one after a few bad shots) tends to relax both the client and the host. 
The lack of a sterile business office with its air of bureau-

cracy allows the two associates to see things in a more agree­able light. Also, the client is more likely to see the host as being up to par with him. 
Some companies recognize the importance of golf in a busi­ness relationship. They have gone as far as to sponsor an­nual golf tournaments where the stakes are very high. They will go to such extremes as to offer a new Camaro, as one brokerage firm did, or even a new home for clients who get a hole-in-one. 
The thrill of competition can help inspire a cooperative na­ture in the client, allowing some serious work to be accom­an intermediary, a shokia-sha. If an American can get a shokai-sha, he then has an in­valuable "ally," someone who can then help in any later busi­ness negotiations. 
The next link in the Japanese network is the traditional sys­tem of employment. An Amer­ican should realize that most Japanese regard their work as somewhat more important than family or friend obliga­tions. This is because most workers have lifetime employ­ment and the attitudes developed are ones of immense sacrifice and pride. 
A Japanese will work all day and attend educational lessons offered by his company, often remaining there until long after his boss has left. Salaries for a Japanese employee are lower than a comparable West­erner's salary. However, he will be given 2 bonuses a year -in early summer and at the end of the year. These bonuses, a type of profit sharing plan, act as an incentive for greater out­put production and devotion to company policies. 
The Japanese also share the responsibilities of decision making. A business proposal is usually initiated within a Japa­nese company at the lower levels of management. Each person who sees the proposal affixes his personal seal of ap­proval. This process, called ringi-seido, or "the request of decision system," emphasizes the Japanese desire for group decisions. Although it is a time consuming process, ultimately a final decision can be imple­mented quickly and with full cooperation because it has already received unanimous support. 
An American must be patient during these times of ringi­seido and must respect the Ja­plished. The desire to get a birdie or even an eagle usually is transferred to the deal at hand. 
It is not uncommon for a sharp player to help his client's game out with a few pointers on his swing or putting in order to seal a deal. Some hosts even "throw" their games, concentrating instead on teeing off on the deal. 
In essence, golf serves as a necessity for all up and coming executives. What seems like a pointless pursuit in chasing balls around several thousand yards of water, sand and rough actually is the best method of closing the "Big Deal." 

TUESDAY SPECIAL 
STROH'S CANS 85 CENTS panese's seemingly extreme devotion to traditional work policies. Any attempt to modify this long established system or any gesture to take command of a meeting or rush a decision will be viewed as a sign of im­pertinence and disrespect. The Japanese would, then, forego any business compromise. 
During negotiations, a Japa­nese must "save face" at all times. "harmony" must be preserved. No one must be put on the spot or ridiculed. In fact, a Japanese will never say "no" nor will he directly disagree. To avoid this he will say some­thing like "It is very difficult" or he may remain silent. Here, silence may mean either a rejection of the proposal or a time of contemplation. 
Americans have difficulty dealing with these Japanese ways. Usually, American negotiations demand open dis­cussions, quick decisions, and give-eand-take resolutions. A Japanese, on the other hand, reveals information piecemeally and will compro­mise just as long as it does not seem that he is compromising. 
At all times, an American must remember that the Japa­nese work closely together in their network which demands complete unity and solidarity. It is precisely this network which is the moving force be­hind the Japanese international market success. They never take each other for granted nor do they take their competitors for granted. "An aspiring busi­ness can not afford not to be international," says Diana Rowland. "It will soon be nec­essary for everyone to have some intercultural experi­ence." This is the important lesson an American busines­sman should remember.

By MOLLY MCNEILL sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's soccer team faced a tough opponent as well as tough weather con­ditions Saturday as it fell to Lewis, 4-0. 
In the pouring rain and freez­ing cold the Belles were unable to generate any type of offense against an 11-0 Lewis team. 
"It was a long day," said Coach Tom Van Meter, "Lewis Irish effort. It was a hearten­ing performance for O'Sullivan after a disappointing 8th place finish the previous weekend in the Notre Dame Fall Invita­tional. This weekend's perfor­mance upped the team's record to 37-16 for the season while earning the Irish an invitation to the next year's Buckeye clas­sic. 
"Finishing the fall season with such a strong perfor­mance," said O'Sullivan, "and in such a great tournament with the youth and inexperi­ence that we have really made me feel good about the charac­ter of this team. 
was a very good team and did everyting right." 
Lewis earned all of its goals, scoring twice in each half from outside the goal box. 
"They didn't try to work the ball inside," said Van Meter. "Ifthey had a shot from outside they took it." 
In the first half, the Belles had two shots that required ex­ceptional saves from Lewis' goalie.

vanced them to the semi-final round where they defeated their host, Lake Forest College, 15-12, 15-11. 
In the championship match, Chicago State outlasted Saint Mary's by the score of 12-15, 13-15, giving Chicago State first place in the invitational while the Belles received a heart­breaking second place. 
"Although we lost in the final, we were able to pull things together offensively and defensively and see where we need improvement," said Suth. "It was great practice since we have two tough conference matches coming up." 
Junior captain Margaret Feldman played excellently throughout the tournament. She recorded 37 kills and was named to the all-tournament team. Other key players were freshman Katie Killilea who had 26 kills, junior Tammy Suth who contributed 24 kills and sophomore Mary McCarthy.

Overtime, a good time 
Irish soccer escapes Spartanburg with title 
By PETE SKIKO Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame soccer team, ranked ninth in the na­tion, had its hands full down south this weekend, but emerged as the champion of the USC-Spartanburg Tourna­ment in Spartanburg, South Carolina, keeping its unde­feated record intact. 
The Irish played a nail-biter Saturday night against the host, USC-Spartanburg, escap­ing with a 2-1 overtime squeaker. Notre Dame then hammmered Winthrop, 4-1, Sunday to win the tournament. 
In the first game with Spar­tanburg leading 1-0 by virtue of a goal very early in the second half, Notre Dame made things dramatic by waiting until 1: 11 remained in regulation when John Guignon headed one home off a restart to force the over­time. 
The Irish then dominated the majority of the extra period before Joe Sternberg scored un­assisted, volleying a rebound off the Rifle goalie into the right corner of the net. 
Sternberg did not expect tiny Spartanburg to pose one of the sternest tests the Irish have faced this year. 
"I was extremely impressed with them," said Sternberg, a junior from Rochester, New York. "It's amazing how far soccer has come down there and how the fans are getting into it. We knew coming in that they had done well in some big NAIA tourneys, so it isn't like we took them lightly, . but I guess we didn't expect over­time from them, either." 
Head Coach Dennis Grace echoed his starting midfielder's sentiments. 
"I'm telling you, they were the best team we've seen this year outside of Indiana," said Grace, the fourth-year coach who watched his team raise its record to 13-0-1. "We were bet­ter on restarts, and we might have worn them down in over­time, but outside of that, there wasn't much that separated the two teams. On the bus down, a lot of the guys were saying, 'Who's Spartanburg?' They showed us who Spartanburg was." 
With the ensuing 4-1 win over Winthrop on Sunday, the Irish maintained their ranking of second in the Great Lakes region, a notch below Indiana. The Irish are the only unde­feated team in the region. 
With their overtime win on Saturday night, Notre Dame improved to 5-0-1 in overtime games this season, and an as­tounding 17-4-16 in OT since 1977. Grace attributes the suc­cess in the extra periods to his squad's practice habits. 
"Our guys go through as much, if not more, of a workout in practice than they'll see in almost any game," said Grace. "We work hard in practice. After some games, we'll come out fresher than after most practices." 
The Irish will face the DePaul Blue Demons this Friday in Chicago. 



Team spirit underlies SMC tennis success 
When the Saint Mary's tennis team began its match at 11:00 a.m. Saturday against St. Francis, the players did not expect to be playing all night. 
Early into play the rain began to fall and forced play to move indoors. Unfortunately, there were only two courts available for the teams. The Belles were down 2-1 at this point and when given the choice of either leaving and accepting a defeat or playing in Joliet all night, they unanimously chose to stay. 
Saint Mary's ended up winning the match, 7-2. 
The never-say-die attitude is a trait common to the entire Saint Mary's tennis team and has helped the team attain its fantastic 12-1 record. 
The single loss that the Belles suffered occured at a time when the team was plagued with both illness and injuries. But the Belles have continued to play well and their victory this weekend is just another example. 
"The team is much better than last year," said Coach Debbie Laverie, "and we are playing a much tougher schedule." 
Laverie attributes much of the teams success to 
Belles take 3 of 5, 
the all the hard work the girls put in this summer and the combination of talent and experience. 
Charlene Szajko , a junior, and Jennifer Block, a sophomore, have lead the team with exceptional playing ability and past experience. Overall the team has depth and, more importantly, enjoys working together. 
"We help each other and have fun while we

play."said Szajko, "The loss gave us a jab in the side and helped wake us up." 
The two freshmen on the squad, Sarah Mayer and Mary Turk, have added to the team's talent. Their individual play has improved within the structure of the close-knit team. 
"We practice alot more than I did in high 


finish 2nd in tourney

The Saint Mary's volleyball team won three of five matches to finish second this weekend in an invitational held at Lake Forest College. 
The tournament did not af­fect regular-season conference standings, so the Belles remain undefeated in conference play while their overall record changes to 13-5. 
The tournament consisted of six teams which were divided
.. 
into two three-team pools. The winner in each pool advanced to the winner's bracket while the second-place team in each pool went to the loser's bracket. The winners of each bracket then met in the finals to deter­

mine  the  champion  of  the  
tournament.  
The  Belles  played  five  

straight matches, testing their endurance and stamina as well as their confidence level. 
"The tournament really tested the girls and gave the team a chance to see where it can improve for the Saint Mary's Tournament," said Belles head coach Sue Medley. "We started out strong and played our kind of volleyball, but toward the end we had some mental breakdowns which caused us to lose the championship." 
Saint Mary's started out strong and confident with an easy win in the first round over 
·chicago State 15-7, 15-5. 

After a close 17-15 victory in the first game in round two of the invitational, the Belles proceeded to lose the next two games and ultimately the match to the National College of Education, 13-15, 5-15. 
The Belles regained their strength in their third match as they pounded Cardinal Stritch, 15-5, 15-6. This win ad-

school,"said Mayer, "I have enjoyed playing and the team closeness. 
Saint Mary's practices three hours a day which includes running and lifting weights. All the hard work the team has been putting in certainly has paid off since the Belles have soundly crushed all but one team in their division. 
On Tuesday Saint Mary's has its last regular season match against Manchester College. The Belles hopefully will be able to keep their record free of a second loss. 
After regular-season play ends the Belles will compete in the Indiana State Championships which begin on Friday and will last through the weekend. 
"We should win the State,"said Laverie,"and then the team will go on to Nationals." 
While the team is very optimistic about the State Championships, the players realize they must con­tinue working hard so that the other teams will not take advantage of their mistakes. 
The Belles have had a great season thus far, and it looks as if they will ace the remainder of the year. 
Twins take Tigers, 9-5, for AL title 
Associated Press 
DETROIT -The Minnesota Twins, bucking inexperience and the odds, beat the Detroit Tigers 9-5 Monday and won their first American League pennant in 22 years behind the pitching of Bert Blyleven and the all-around play of Gary Gaetti. 
With the worst record of any World Series team since the 1973 New York Mets and the worst road record of any pen­nant winner, the Twins took two of three at Detroit to win the best-of-seven playoffs in five games. 
Tom Brunansky drove in two runs with a double in Min­nesota's four-run second in­ning, then homered with one out in the ninth -when the Twins scored their final three runs.
