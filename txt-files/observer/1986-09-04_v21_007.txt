In Brief 
The World Bank said Tuesday that at its current growth rate sub-Saharan Africa's population will increase from 470 million to 700 million in the next 14 years, and that the rapid growth is endangering health and frustrating development plans. 
The rate of growth of the population has fallen in all other developing regions of the world, the World Bank said. But Africa's population growth rate has accelerated recently 
from an average of 2.8 percent a year from 1970-82 to 3. I percent a year in 1985 and is now the highest in the world, it said. If this rate were to continue, sub-Saharan Africa's 
current population would double in just '22 years. 
In comparison, it said Latin America's rate of population growth dropped from 2.9 percent in the early ·1960s to 2.4 percent. South Asia's growth rate has slowed from 2.5 percent to 2. I percent. -AP

Indiana shantytown protested 
Associated Press 

Bloomington, Ind. -Some stu­dents are complaining that the anti-apartheid shanty structures built at Indiana University are un­sightly, but protesters say the op­position renews their zeal. 
According to Steve Bouton, a shanty dweller, lots of students have told them that they are making the campus ugly. The shantytown dwellers tell them that apartheid is ugly too. 
Shantytowns have been con­structed on the IU campus and at schools across the country to protest South African apartheid, a system of racial discrimination by a white minority against all non-whites. 
The IU shantytown was con­structed to protest the IU invest­ments in corporations doing business with South Africa. The protest has not been without in­cident. 
Two of the structures at the IU shantytown were destroyed by fire Aug. 18. None of the shan­tytown dwellers was injured, but many of the supplies of the protesters and rnuch of the anti­apartheid literature were destroyed. 
According to Keith Waterbury, a shantytown dweller, whoever set the fire destroyed a lot of ma­terial things, but they helped us spiritually. It just made us more determined to stay. 

Fred Crowder, another shan­tytown resident said that setting the fire didn't do anything to get us out. It just made us mad be­cause someone lit the fire with­out checking to see ifanyone was inside. 
When summer began, many of the protesters living in the shan­tytown left Bloomington for sum­mer jobs or vacations. But Bouton said protesters have planned massive protests for the fall. 
The protesters, not all ofwhom are IU students, also have plans to build a new two-story shanty structure. 
But Waterbury said that the shantytown dwellers are going to leave the burned-out frames up to show what kind of people that they are up against. 
The plastic, cardboard and wood shantytown structures were erected in mid-April after the IU trustees decided to divest stocks worth $43,000 from uni­versity investments in South Africa then valued at $3.6 mil­lion. 
Despite the ongoing protests 
to remove all South African in­
vestments, the IU stock portfolio 
in such investments has grown 
by $2.2 million since April. 
IU treasurer John D. Mulhol­
land said he does not foresee a 
day when the university will fully 
divest all its stock in corporations 
doing business in South Africa. 
He said the university works with a management consulting firm that reports on which com­panies with ties to South Africa are taking positive steps to end apartheid. 
According to Mulholland. the fact is that ifyou divest and walk away from the problem, it is not a morally defensible posture as opposed to staying in the bal­lgame and working for change. 
But the shanty dwellers, along with other protesters, have demanded that the university divest itself of all stock in corpo­rations doing business in South Africa. 
Bouton said that since the symbolic structures were built many people have stopped their cars on the street and gotten out to give us food, money and names of other people who might help us. 


Funeral planned despite ban 
Associated Press 

Johannesburg, South Africa Anti-apartheid leaders said a mass funeral for 20 blacks killed by police in Soweto would be held today in defiance of an of­ficial ban. 
The government issued tough new press restrictions yesterday to make sure journalists could not cover it. 
Families of some of those killed in the violence that swept parts of Soweto on Aug. 26-27 were called to police offices yes­terday and told to shun the mass funeral scheduled for a stadium near the White City neighbor­hood. 
White City, so named because it is the best-lighted part of the huge black township outside Johannesburg, suffered the worst violence last week. 
At least 20 people were shot dead by police in the Soweto out­burst and a gang of young men hacked a black town councilor to death. 
Leaders of anti-apartheid groups said they would go ahead with the funeral despite a Soweto police order Tuesday forbidding mass funerals of people killed by security forces. It says a service may be held for only one person and only 200 mourners may at­tend. 
The government of President 
P. W. Botha reimposed a rule prohibiting journalists from reporting the actions of security forces and added tough new re­strictions on news coverage. 
New press restrictions, issued by Police Commissioner Joha11 Coetzee, expand a previous ban on reports of security force ac­tions by saying any journalist on the scene or within sight of any unrest restricted gathering or security force activity must leave immediately. 
The restrictions, published in the official government gazette, replace an order issued in con­junction with the declaration of a nationwide state of emergency June 12. 
A government lawyer conceded two weeks ago that the order was improperly promul­gated because it was not pub­lished in the government gazette. Since then, on the ad­vice ofattorneys, journalists had treated the order as invalid. 

Professor resigns to pursue peace 
Special to the Observer 

The Francis J. O'Malley Profes­sor and the director of the In­stitute for International Peace Studies at Notre Dame will leave the O'Malley Chair to become the University's first George N. Shuster University Professor, ac­cording to Provost Timothy O'Meara. 
John Gilligan, fanner gover­nor of Ohio, is leaving the O'Malley Professorship so he can put more time into directing the recently established Peace Studies Institute, said O'Meara. 
Gilligan, a 1942 Notre Dame graduate, joined the University faculty in 1979. 
He was elected 62nd governor of Ohio in 1970 and served for one term. 
Before being elected gover­nor, Gilligan served on the Cin­cinnati City Council and the U.S. House of Representatives. 
Appointed a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in 1975, he was later that year named admin­istrator of the Agency for Inter­national Development by Presi­dent Jimmy Carter. 
Gilligan also served as a gun­nery officer in the U.S. Navy and was awarded a Silvt>r Star for gal­lantry during the battle of Okinawa. 
The George N. Shuster Univer­sity Chair memorializes a 1915 Notre Dame alumnus who served as president of Hunter College from 1939 to 1960. While pres­ident there, Shuster performed a wide variety ol public services.

N.Y. coed brutalized as security watches 
Associated Press 
Potsdam, N.Y. -Two university security guards who saw the bru­tal rape that led to a sopho­more's death did nothing be­cause they thought she was willingly having sex, authorities 
said.  
Katherine  Hawelka,  19,  of  
Syracuse,  who  was  beaten  un­ 
conscious  and  raped  on  the  

Clarkson University campus, died Monday at a Watertown hospital after doctors discon­nected life-support systems. 
University security guard Donald Shanty told police he saw the attack on Miss Hawelka early Friday on the campus in upstate New York near the Canadian bor­der. but did not realize what was happening. 
Shanty said he saw what he believed to be a consenting couple having sexual intercourse as he drove his patrol car, accor­ding to police records. Shanty added in those records that when the lights hit the subject he looked up at me and then turned his head back down. 
Shanty said that he didn't think too much of the guy and the girl being there because in the 25 years that he's been working as a security guard for Clarkson, he has seen students having sex in unusual places before, and therefore he really didn't think too much of this at the time. 
Another guard, Kim Avadikian, who was on foot. also saw Miss Hawelka being raped, police records show. 
The two guards discussed whether they should intervene and, according to Shanty decided to go back and park with the headlights on them so they would get up and leave the records show. 
They found Miss Hawelka cov­ered with blood, and a nearby wall blood-stained, Shanty said. Authorities said the woman's face had been smashed into the wall. 
Brian McCarthy, 23, has been charged with second-degree murder. Police said he was found lying near Miss Hawelka's body on Friday.

Over 7,000 
U.S. teachers on strike 
Associated Press 
More than 7, 000 teachers were on strike over contract disputes in eight states yesterday, leaving many of their more than I 2 I, 000 students without classes or in ab­breviated sessions. 
We are talking everything ­salaries and fringe benefits, Bar­bara R. gada, president of the Schuylkill Valley Teacher Assoca­tion in Pennsylvania, said of negotiations in her district where the strike authorization vote was 150-33. 
Donald f. MLrabito of the Pennsylvania State Education As­sociation blamed bargaining problems in his state on the legislature. which has failed to institute tax changes preventing schools from relying so heavily on real estate taxes. 
He said that local taxpayers have had it with the real estate tax increases to support school budgets. 
In ·addition to Pennsylvania, the hardest hit with 14 strikes by 3,456 teachers of 53,068 stu­dents, public school teachers were on strike in Michigan, Illi­nois, Ohio, Massachusetts, Washington state, New Jersey and Rhode Island. 
Walkouts also spread into higher education. The 426­member faculty union at the private Fairleigh Dickinson Uni­versity in New Jersey walked out yesterday, but about 40 percent 
of  classes  went  on  for  the  
opening  day  for  14,000  stu­ 
dents.  

The I 18-member faculty asso­ciation at Roger Williams College in Rhode Island voted to strike but classes do not resume until today. And 1.325 instructors at Wayne State University in Mic­higan held classes yesterday for a second day without a contract; bargaining continued. 
Teachers in I I I of New Jer­sey's 571 school districts are beginning the school year with­out contracts. 
More strikes also are threatened in Michigan at I 0 school districts and two commu­nity colleges, said Bill Davison of the Michigan Education Associa­tion.

HPC's ineffectiveness might be 
Since my first day at Notre Dame two years ago the debate about the cttcctivc­ncss of student government has gone on unceasingly. One of the questions con­cerns Hall Presidents' Council. Is it <HI organization whose purpose is the weekly consumption of pizza and pettiness or is it the most cftkicnt representative body on campus.·? 
Scott Bearby 
but wait, there's tnore 
Alter more than one ami a halt years of weekly coverage of the t1PC, I can say that the organization has shown flashes ol both. but fortunately each group of presidents l1as demonstrated that they do have a concern tor their h<JIIs, campus, and presidents' council. 
Student govcrmnent has an obligation to serve the <.ampus in terms of long range improvement in the govemment stru<.turc and in seeking to make a change above their daily responsibilities. However, student government must con­
centrale on those daily responsibilities as 
well. One or these daily concerns is the 
social happiness of the student body. 
The residence halls arc still the primary 
source of weekend activity and special 
events. With hall funds and assistance 
from the University and the Student Ac­
tivities !Soard, dorms arc receiving larger 
budgets and larger responsibilities to 
serve their residents. 

At some point last year the best of in­
tentions, forming a better student gov­
ernment, went out of control. Personal 
bickering, lack of trust and divided views 
made me too cynical about the organiza­
tion in order to cover it weekly as an ob­
jective reporter. As a result of their activ­
ity, the spring semester proved to be 
frustrating for everyone. Energies were 
devoted to destruction rather than con­, struction. 
Previous to this period, HPC had made 
progress on the campus and with the in­
dividual residence halls. It seems as if 
the new group of presidents have also 
gotten off on the right track in developing 
a concern for what the students really 
need. Too often last year the Viewpoint 
section contained negative sentiments 
toward student government and HPC be­cause of the turmoil the organizations created for themselves. I hope that a pos­itive article here at the beginning of the year will be an encouragement to keep the .Hall Presidents' Council focus as it is 
now. 
HPC has the potential to be the most effective body on campus because each member of the council has a direct inter­est in their decisions. They must go back to their halls and face the people who elected them and who they must live with on a day to day basis. HPC seems to be the most representative body on campus. 
Much has been said about the weekly consumption of pizza after meetings and who pays for it. I see no problem with the gathering as long as it goes to pro­ductive use. In my one and a half years of coverage I noticed the time as a way to share problems and for presidents to realize that it is not just hiSiher social chairman or committee who will not cooperate but that someone else is going through the same situation. 
But more importantly, the time should be used to plan co-sponsored activities. 


In the past 
Hall activity is fine, but the more hall in­teraction there is, the greater the chance for variety in activity. Co-sponsored ac­tivities relieve the hall from the pressure of planning all events themselves and they allow their residents to see new faces. 
Hall Presidents' Council, as it was ex­plained to me at my first meeting, is an exchange body. Too often though it is the other groups who address the council who provide the exchange. Presidents sit and hear about the latest group forming on campus or about the Christmas activ­ity scheduled by another group. This is important, but I would encourage presi­dents to provide time to exchange ideas with one another. I encourage all of you to be a unified support group. 
With a unified effort to serve the campus, the infamous past of student government will be set aside and Hall Presidents' Council will be the most ef­fective body on campus.

happens to all of those worthless appli­cations? I'm tempted to think that they become interesting reading for managers on off days. 
Speaking of the manager, where is he? Go look for one of these mystical managers and you will find he is out for the afternoon or in a meeting that has been going on since 1963. What's the deal? Where do these vanishing people come from? Is this a requirement to be­come a manager? 
And what about the people who say, We will look over your application and call you in a couple of days. A couple of days? Try never. Apparently these people have yet to discover that technical marvel called the telephone. These people must come from the same place as those guys who, after a date, throw in the infamous I will call you. Uh-huh, right. 
So what is my solution to avoiding the pitfalls of thejob hunt? Easy. Do not work, or become an invisible manager. Listen. I've really got to go now, but if you ever want to comment about my column feel free to drop me a line and I will get back with you in a couple of days... really!

Flash (Darrell) Gordon has taken advantage of the opportunity and hes on the first team at the present time, playing awfully, awfully welL'' 
Gordon, ajunior, saw less than 30 minutes of playing time last season, and is the probable starter at outside linebacker in next Saturday's opener against Michigan. 
Perhaps the closest battle for position in the entire defense is the struggle between junior Wes Pritchett and senior Ron Weis­senhofer for the starting inside linebacker spot alongside Kovaleski. 
Fazio said Weissenhofer cur­rently has the edge because of circumstances beyond anyone's control -illness. 
"Right now Pritchett is under the weather and hes going to miss a cou~le of valuable days, "'Fazio said.' Both of the guys had an excellent physical camp and mental preparation is very im­portant now. 
"Pritchett was doing well and I thought Ron Weissenhofer had his best game in our last scrim­mage. If we had to line up right now I think Weissenhofer would start, but Pritchett might go in right away too. Hes deserving to play.''

Sophomore Ned Bolcar is also 

a sure bet to see some playing

Sweden's Edberg eliminates last American in U.S. Open 

Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Tim· Wilkison's dream of reaching the semifinals of the U.S. open Tennis Cham­pionships was shattered last night as Sweden's Stefan Edberg eliminated the last American in the men's singles, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3. 
It's the first time since 1966 that no American ha,s made it into the semifinals of America's premier tennis event. 
Earlier Wednesday, aerenomy men's champion Ivan Lend! made the semifinals for the fifth straight year and Chris Evert Lloyd extended her record streak by gaining a berth in the wo­men's semifinals for the 16th consecutive year. 
Lend! defeated eighth-seeded Henri Leconte of France 7-6, 6-1. 1-6, 6-1. while Lloyd brushed aside ninth-seeded Manuela Maleeva of Bulgaria 6-2, 6-2. 
In another women's quarter­final match, No. 7 Helena Sukova of Czechoslovakia ousted Australia's Wendy Turnbull 6-4, 6-0.

When yesterday's rain-delayed match finally got under way, Ed­berg quickly silenced the large crowd by breaking Wilkison in the second game as the reigning Australian Open champion 
jumped out to a 3-0 lead. lie also got an early break in the second set and pulled off the only service break in the third set. 
Only occasionally did the crowd get a chance to cheer, and those times came when the As­heville, N.C. lcft-hanclcr made bone-jarring dives for volleys on the hard courts of the National Tennis Center. l~ut those times were few and far between as t:d­bcrg played one of his best games of this two-week tourna­ment. 
The Lendl-l.econte match turned on one shot. 
Leconte hit a perfectly ex­ecuted drop shot in the I Oth game of the match, a shot that would break Lendl's serve and close out the first set. 
Leconte began to raise his hands in triumph when Lencll raced across the court and some­how got his racket on the ball, lifted it clown the line, then watched as the ball touched down just inside the line. 
~I think that point won me two sets, ""Lend I said.1 believe that won me the first set because hadnt I gotten to it. I would have lost the first set. And I think men­tally it just broke him down. losing that set because he thought he lldd it.''

LINCOLN, Ncb. -The NCAA has 
suspended 53 University of Ne­
braska football players for one 
game and seven others for two 
games and the ·Cornhuskers 
could possibly forfeit their 
season-opener, Coach Tom Os­
borne said yesterday. 
Osborne told reporters after practice that tile suspensions were ordered lor what the NCAA said were improprieties in Ne­braska's usc of complimentary football tickets. 
'' Wl!rc naturally amazed and 
\·cry angry about tile whole 
thin~~ osborne said.'wc told tile 
players we \dll do everything 
possible to appeal this.~ 
Osborne said the eighth­ranked Corr'lhuskcrs could forfeit their opener against I I !11-rankcd t'lorida State as one of the school's options to the suspen­sions. 
The violations involved players allowing unauthorized people to use game passes. Family mem­bers and other students are the only people allowed to use the players' passes, according to NCAA rules. 
A Nebraska Sports Information Office spokesman said the NCAA gave Nebraska two options: 
One, all the players could sit out Saturday's game against t'lorida State, which Osborne said woulcllcavc him with mainly freshmen and rcdsllirt players to put on tile field. 

Two, have I 0 players sit out each of the next six or seven games. 
Osborne said he learned of the suspensions from tile NCAA's Eligibility Committee on Tues­day. He would not release a list of players involved. 
An NCAA spokesman said the association was not commenting on the matter. 
"As far as I know, the matter is still being discusscd,'tJim Mar­chiony, director of media rela­tions for the NCAA in Mission, Kan., said. 
Until I hear otherwise, we wont 
have any comment. 
Nebraska is scheduled to meet 
the Seminoles in a nationally­
televised game Saturday night in
