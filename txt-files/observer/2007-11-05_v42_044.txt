Researcher exa111ines riot 111isconceptions 
Professor explains actions of the authorities 
By BRIAN McKENZIE 
News Writer 
Notre Dame sociology pro­fessor Daniel Myers presented a lecture titled "Cops, Protest and Rioting" to a crowd of about 50 people Saturday morning. 
He focused American riots in the 1960s, saying they were often started when white police ol'ficers were accused of misconduct against black sus­pects. Crowds would gather and the situation would spiral out of control because the police had insufficient rein­forcements. 
Meyers wanted to "look at riots and protests and what's behind them in a more serious way," he said. But he said that even the word "riots" was controversial because "many people think it's a pejorative word and it gives excuses for repression. They want to think of it as a rebellion against unjust authority." 
"But I want to take a broad­er view," he said, adding that people tend to think of riots as "enormous crowds. But only 200 of the 4,000 riots in !the 1960sI involved 1 ,000 or more people. Even 15 people can do a lot of damage." Another myth, he said, is that most riots occurred on eollege campuses. However, three

Human trafficking, sexual assault among headline topics to be tackled by panel discussions 
By CLAIRE REISING 
NewsWrirer 
A U.S. State Department report says that approxi­mately 800,000 people are trafficked across interna­tional borders and forced into lives of slavery or pros­titution every year. One in six American women are vic­tims of sexual assault, aeeording to the Hape, Abuse and Ineest National Network. Although these sta­tistics may seem far removed from the lives of Notre Dame students, three campus presentations this week will aim to raise con­versation about the issues. 
The Center for Social con­cerns and the Notre Dame On Sunday, a spokeswoman for the New York City medical examiner's office told AP that the initial autopsy on Shay's body was inconclusive. 
Shay's legacy at Notre Dame is not in doubt. "He was the ultimate competi­tor," Notre Dame Athletic 
Director  Kevin  White  said  
Saturday.  "He had  an  aura  
about him."  

White called Shay "the Brady Quinn of the Olympic sports, that's how big he was around here."

Law School are hosting a panel today on human traf­ficking. Tomorrow, United Nations adviser Gillian Sorensen will speak on the state of women interna­tionally, a n d author a n d activist Jackson Katz will lecture on the male response to violence against women. 
Today's symposium, "Bought and Sold: Human Trafficking and Bonded Labor in the U.S.," will fea­ture "Katya," a human traf-ficking survivor who was asked to testify in front of a House Judiciary Committee on International Legislation, according to Rachel Tomas Morgan of the Center for Social Concerns. Two people who worked on Katya's case, Notre Dame law professor Bridgette Carr and Angus Lowe, Senior Special Agent of U.S. Immigration and Customs, will also speak, as well as junior Katherine Dunn, who learned about human trafficking through service-learning internships. 


"Human trafficking is one of the most pressing issues we have today, and it seems our campus hasn't done much !about it] before," Morgan said. "Trafficking is

She said the symposium is timely because Congress is deciding whether to reautho­rize the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, which allows heavier prose­cution for offenders and pro­vides aid to victims.

University tests alert syste111s 
'Tweaking' of e-mail configuration needed 
By KAREN LANGLEY 
News Editor 
The University performed a successful test of ND Alert, the new emergency communications system, Friday afternoon, an Office of Information Technology spokesman said. 
The trial included the launch of emergency.nd.edu, a portal for ongoing information during any crisis, and a test implementation of the two-part ND Alert notifica­tion system. 
The notification system includes the distribution of emer­gency messages to student, facul­ty and staff phones and e-mail account, as well as a broadcast to any television sets turned on in dorms, common areas and offices. The broadcast is possible through the University's Comcast cable system. 
While the Office of Information Technology (OIT) was still gather­ing and analyzing data Friday afternoon, Jay Steed, executive assistant to Chief Information Officer Gordon Wishon, said the test was an overall success. 
"We had to do a little bit of tweaking for the e-mails going to Notre Dame e-mail accounts," he said. 
OIT workers had to modify the configurations that eontrol earn­pus-wide e-mail distribution, he said. Not all test e-mails were ­

ND professor finds supernova 
Special to The Observer 
Notre Dame astrophysi­cist Peter Garnavich and a team or collaborators have identified a superno­va caused by the collision of two stars. 
T h e y 
made a detailnd study or the 234th superno­va discov­ered in 2 () 0 (J ' 
c a I I n d 


"2006gz," Garnavich 
and found convincing evidence that the explosion resulted from thn mPrging of two "white dwarfs." The ther­rnon uelP.ar destruction of a white dwarf is called a type Ia supernova and was crucial in the discov­ery or the accelerating universfl and dark energy. 
White dwarf stars are thP remnant cores of stars like our Sun and contain mostly the ele­ments carbon and oxy­gnn. White dwarfs can explodn if their mass is increased and reaches a critical 1.4 times the mass of the Sun. It was believed that type Ia supernovae result from a white dwarf stealing mass from a Sun-like star to reach the unstable mass limit. But supernova 2006gz was different. Two white dwarf stars in orbit about each spiraled together and combined to exceed the mass limit. 
"We have used super­novae to discover dark energy. yet we do not know exactly how the explosions happen," Garnavich said. "11 now looks like thflre are at least two ways of making a type Ia supernova." 
The team studied supernova 2006gz with telescopes in Arizona and modeled the explosion with a computer program developed in Oklahoma. From the first data it was clear that this was an unusual event. The super­nova appeared to be rich in carbon which is rare in most type Ia supernovae. 
"Jose (Prieto, a student at Ohio State University) and I looked at the first spectrum and we both thought there was some­thing screwy with this guy," Garnavich said. 
While carbon makes up most of a white dwarf, it is nearly completely fused to heavier elements in the explosion. 

SMC Bookstore hosts fashion shovv 
By MOLLY LAMPING News Writer 
On Friday, members of the Saint Mary's community walked the run­way at the annual Shaheen Bookstore fashion show, wearing apparel from the fall and winter col­lections. Nearly 40 modeL<> showcased the new line that was made available to the public immediately after the event. 
The fashion show's theme was "A Feminine Twist on the Classic Pmp." 
"Everything we have is kind of clas­sic Saint Mary's, but with an edge," ­said fashion show coordinator Melinda Weleh, a senior. 
Preparation for the event began last spring. 
"We do the buying for the clothing in the spring and thfl summflr," Welch said. "Once we know the clothing, we e-mail idea<> baek and forth and then once we get back to Saint Mary's, we pick a date and find the models." 
The modeL<> for the show are most­ly Saint Mary's students, with a few Notre Dame students. Members of the College's faculty and staff, includ­ing College President Carol Ann Mooney, also participated. 
"This is my third time doing the fashion show," sophomore model Margaret Burke said. "We have a couple of fittings before the show to decide what clothes and accessories to wear, but it's always a lot of fun and I love doing it. It's really fun to play model." 
"Hands down, my favorite part about being involved in the fashion show was walking down the nmway and putting Derek Zoolander to shame," Notre Dame junior Drew Reynolds said. 
Welch was happy with student turnout. "We had a gn~at crowd," she said. 
"Everyone seemed to be having a good time and I think people really enjoyed the clothes." 
In addition to the runway show, there was also a raffie. Raffie items included an iPod shuffie, two Vera Bradley bags, a Vera Bradley haVpurse set and four Vera Bradley book covers. The Bookstore also teamed up with student organization Belles for Books for a "50/50" raffie in which 50 percent of the proceeds went to buy books for underprivi­leged children. 
"The fashion show is a creative way for the Bookstore to advertise," Welch said. 
The Bookstore oftered a 20-percent discount on all clothing items from Friday until Sunday to coincide with the fashion show and release of the new clothing.

Details of Justice Scalia's visit corrected· 
Observer Staff Report 
Contrary to what was printed in an Observer article last Tuesday, 
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia did not request that his appearance at the Law School on Oct. 19 go unpublicized, and neither did the U.S. Marshals, Law School officials said. An Observer reporter's misquoting added to the inaccuracy. 
The Observer wrongly reported that Scalia and the Marshals asked the University to refrain from publicizing the justice's par­ticipation in the Law School con­ference on the separation of pow­ers in the federal government. But law professor A.J. Bellia. the con­ference organizer, made that deci­sion, Bellia and Law School spokesperson Melanie McDonald said Thursday. 
The errors stemmed from mis­information, compounded by poor reporting. McDonald initially told The Observer that Scalia request­ed the appearance to go unpubli­cized. She said she learned after publication of the Tuesday article that it was Bellia's preference. 
Bellia said the decision not to publicize Scalia's presence was his own. Though it was likely easi­er for the Marshals that the appearance was unpublicized, they did not make that request, Bellia said. 
The Observer also misquoted McDonald and Bellia. McDonald did not say that a "mob scene" would ensue if Scalia's appear­ance were publicized. Also, Bellia did not say that "it is the prefer­ence of the U.S. Marshals" that Notre Dame refrain from publiciz­ing Scalia's visit.

King Tut's face revealed to the public 
LUXOR -King Tut's buck-toothed face was unveiled Sunday for the first time in public -more than 3,000 years after the youngest and most famous pharaoh to rule ancient Egypt was shrouded in linen and buried in his golden underground tomb. 
Archeologists carefully lifted the fragile mummy out of a quartz sarcophagus deco­rated with stone-carved protective god­desses, momentarily pulling aside a beige covering to reveal a leathery black body. 
The linen was then replaced over Tut's narrow body so only his face and tiny feet were exposed, and the 19-year-old king, whose life and death has captivated people for nearly a century, was moved to a sim­ple glass climate-controlled case to keep it from turning to dust.

The storm struck New England with just a glancing blow Saturday, bringing down tree limbs and knocking out power to 80,000 homes. State officials reported no serious injuries or deaths. By late Sunday afternoon, NStar said 17,000 customers remained with­out power. 
"Crews are facing extensive damage to trees and electric Pquipment," NStar spokeswoman Caroline Allen said in a statement. The com­pany expected to restore power to all its cus­tomers by Monday, she said.

Students push hate crime legislation 
TERRE HAUTE -Indiana State University President Uoyd Benjamin is promising to help students upset by the discovery of a rope resembling a noose in a campus tree push hate crimes legislation in the General Assembly next session. 
Benjamin, who condemned the Oct. 25 noose incident at the Terre Haute campus, has encouraged students to carry out their plan to circulate a petition on hate crimes legislation. 
"I pledge to work with you in carrying that petition forward to our Legislature and to push for its passage this legislative session," he said in a recent letter to the Tribune-Star. 
Officials are investigating the noose incident as a possible hate crime.

Thousands of Iraqis returning home 
Residents repopulate Baghdad neighborhoods as sectarian violence drops 
Associated Press 

BAGHDAD -In a dra­matic turnaround, more than 3,000 Iraqi families driven out of their Baghdad neighborhoods have returned to their homes in the past three months as sectarian violence has dropped, the government said Saturday.

The family had been liv­ing inside a vicious and bloody turf battle between al-Qaida in Iraq and Mahdi Army militiamen. But Azawi said things began changing, becoming more peaceful, in August when radical anti-American Shiite cleric Muqtada al­Sadr ordered his Mahdi Army fighters to stand down nationwide.

After students hear Katz's lecture, Hakoezy hopes they will have a dialogue about male/female relations, and that, eventually, a training program similar to Katz's will begin on campus. 
"I hope that !Katz] gets our women and men talking to each other about what's going on in campus in a practical way," she said.

Gillian Sorensen is the senior adviser to the United Nations Poundation, has a background in public policy, and has worked with non­governmental organizations, said Elizabeth Rankin of the Kellogg Institute for International Studies. 
Although somn students blame tension between males and females on pari­etals and single-sex dorms, Hedding and Hakoczy do not agree. Hakoezy attributes strained gender relations to students' unbalanced lif11 styles. She says students create a "dual identity" by studying hard throughout the week and using the weekend for socializing and sexual release. 
"Notre Dame is a place where high-achieving people come in and arc foeus!ld on competition and perfection­ism. They try to l'it too much into one day, and rela­tionships get compartmen­talized," she said. 
Hedding said students of the opposite sex should be able to establish normal relationships, despite single­sex dorms. 
"You can manage to live in a room without a girl and develop an acceptable rela­tionship with women," he said.

New blood thinner rivals competitors 
ORlANDO -A new blood thinner proved 
better than Plavix. one of the world's top­
selling drugs, at preventing heart problems 
after procmlures to open clogged arteries, 
doctors reported Sunday. But the new drug 
also raised the risk of serious bleeding. 
People given the experimental drug, pra­
sugn~l. were nearly 20 percent less likely to 
suffer one of the problems in a combined 
measure -heart attack, stroke or heart­
related death -than those given Plavix, a 
drug that millions of Americans take to pre­
vent blood clots that cause these events. 
However, for each heart-related death that 
prasugrel (PRASS-uh-grell) prevented, com­
pared to Plavix, almost one additional bleed­
ing death occurred. 
"There is a price to pay" for greater effec­
tiveness. Dr. Deepak Bhatt, a Cleveland 
Clinic cardiologist, wrote in an editorial 
accompanying the results, which were pub­
lished online by The New England Journal of 
Medicine and presented at an American 
Heart Association conference in Florida.

The battle has broad implications for the way

UAW reaches agreement with Ford 
Largest auto union forges contract with struggling Detroit-based automaker 
Associated Press 

DETROIT -The United Auto Workers union reached a tentative four­year contract agreement with Ford Motor Co. on Saturday, avoiding the threat of a strike against the struggling automaker, the union said. 
The deal, reached around 3:20 a.m. EDT, must be ratified by the UAW's approximately 54,000 members covered by the contract at Ford. If approved, it would bring a close to historic negotia­tions that have yielded agreements designed to return U.S.-based automakers to profitabili­ty. 
Details of the agreement were not immediately released, but the deal likely will be similar to those negotiated with General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC. 
Those pacts -which were reached after short. strikes against the automakers -include a union-run trust that would take over the com­panies' retiree health care obligations, a lower-tier wage scale for some workers and some job security pledges. dent for human resources members," UAW iority rights.

And he learned the price of naming rights was going up and that keeping the name for now would bn a strategic asset. After 20 years, he estimates, the nam­ing rights on the school could bring in $300 million or more.

MEXICO 
Tens of thousands flee Gulf Coast flooding in Mexico 
Torrential rains continue to overflow river and pummel infrastructure; draws comparisons to Katrina 
Associated Press 
VILLAIIERMOSA -Hundreds of thousands of Mexicans fled a flooded region of the Gulf coast Friday, jumping from rooftops into rescue helicopters, scram­bling into boats or swimming out through murky brown water. 
President Felipe Calderon called the flooding in Tabasco state one of Mexico's worst recent natural disasters, and pledged to rebuild. 
A week of heavy rains caused rivers to overflow. drowning at least 80 percent of the oil-rich state. Much of the state capital, Villahermosa. looked like New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, with water reaching to second­story rooftops and desperate people awaiting rescue. 
At least one death was report­ed and nearly all services, including drinking water and public transportation, were shut down. The flood affected more than 900,000 people in the state of 2 million -their homes flood­ed, damaged or cut off by high water. 
A 1 0-inch natural gas pipeline sprang a leak al'ter flooding apparently washed away soil underneath it, but it was unclear if other facilities operated by the state-run Petroleos Mexicanos were damaged or if oil produc­tion was affected. 
Workers tried to protect 
Villahermosa's famous Olmec statues by placing sandbag col­lars around their enormous stone heads, and built sandbag walls to hold back the Grijalva River in the state capital. 
But the water rose quickly, sur­prising residents used to annual floods and forcing soldiers to evacuate the historic city center. The dikes failed Thursday night, and water swamped the capital's bus station and open-air market. 
Rain gave way to sunshine Friday, but tens of thousands of people were still stranded on rooftops or in the upper floors of their homes. Rescue workers used tractors, helicopters, jet skis and boats to ferry people to safe­ty, while others swam through water infested by poisonous snakes to reach higher ground. 
Calderon met with state offi­cials and flew over the affected areas. The extent of the flooding was clear from the sky ­Tabasco state seemed like an inland sea with only rooftops and treetops protruding from the water. 
"This is not just the worst nat­ural catastrophe in the state's history but, I would venture to say, one of the worst in the recent history of the country," Calderon said Friday during an emergency meeting with state officials in Villahermosa. 
The president ordered the armed forces and federal police to maintain order and prevent looting, and asked residents to remain calm. He canceled a trip to Panama, Colombia and Peru. 

"Once we have passed the criti­cal stage ... we are going to reconstruct Tabasco, whatever it takes," Calderon said. 
Mexicans rallied around the disaster, with people across the country contributing money and supplies. Television stations dedi­cated entire newscasts to the flooding and morning shows switched from yoga and home improvement to calls for aid. Friday was the Day of the Dead holiday, but banks opened to accept donations for flood vic­tims. 
Food and clean drinking water were extremely scarce in Tabasco state, and federal Deputy Health Secretary Mauricio Hernandez warned that there could be outbreaks of cholera and other waterborne diseases. 
"With so many people packed together there is a chance that infectious diseases could spread," he said. 
Officials tested for 600 suspect­ed cases of cholera, but none was positive, he said. The water­borne sickness, which can be fatal, has not been reported in Mexico for at least six years. 
The government also sent 20,000 Hepatitis A vaccinations and were giving booster shots to children to prevent outbreaks, Hernandez said. 

Medical care was difficult, however, because at least 50 of the state's hospitals and medical centers were flooded. 
Hotels, parking garages and other dry structures were con­verted into temporary shelters for those forced from their homes. 
Guadalupe de la Cruz, a recep­tionist at the Hotel Calinda Viva Villahermosa, said the hotel's meeting rooms were being used as shelters for employees' fami­lies. She said the 240-room hotel was completely booked, mostly by people who had fled their homes. 
Many people were headed to nearby cities unaffected by the floods. Highways that weren't covered with water were packed with residents fleeing in cars and on foot. The exodus appeared to be orderly with no reports of vio­lence.

mg and lundraismg nvents for the day or lligh Sounding the PBS-sponson~d Words debate. Mitt Homncy was at an IIIOP in Sacramento, Calif. Fn~d Thompson was charging $500 per dinner plate in Franklin, Tenn. Hudy Giuliani was visiting one cafe after another in Santa Barbara, Calif. before seeking the endorsement of anti-immigration ex-California Gov. Pete Wilson in Santa Monica. And .John McCain was in New York spf~ak­ing to the conservative lludson Institute (whose President, by the way, has publicly called f'or an American military strike on Iran since the summer of 2006). 
A month later, a different forum brought all of' the Hepublican Party candidates to Washington, DC. Calendars were clear for the second­annual Vahws Voters Summit, an event not to be missed, which culmi­nated in a straw poll won narrowly by Homnny. 
What is most surprising about this convention of' Christian conservative voters is the arrogance and careless­ness of its very name, and the wide­spread use of "values voters" as an acceptable or reasonable term by the American modia and public. 
Such a classification of one pur­portedly like-minded political bloc injures our sense and conception of voters and issues as the 2008 presi­dential election approaches. 
First, as one Washington Post columnist put it over a year ago, who isn't a "values voter?" 
The phrase suggests that only social conservatives vote to further their values. It implies that OIHJ seg­ment of the population, and indeed. OIHJ extreme of the political spec­trum. has a monopoly on moral sin­cerity and importance when it comes to political participation. 
Second, the "values" label seems to apply to a relatively narrow set of issues (namely those surrounding certain life issues, a definition or marriage or family, and religion in the public sphere). So, when conser­vative voters discuss other tenets of their party, like tax cuts or limited government, are they talking about values-free issues? 
By creating the idea of the "values voter," participating social conserva­tives suggest not only that they are more morally conseious than the rest of the electorate. but that certain political issues are embedded with values and ethics, while others lay outside of this realm. This is a dan­gerous framework for the presiden­tial race -one that both parties should feel wary about-but. unfor­tunately, that the social conservative leadership functions within. 
In a piece exploring why the "val­ues voters" crowd isn't rallying behind Gov. Mike lluekabee, a Baptist minister stieking with his first wife and first position on abor­tion (rare qualities amidst this year's pool of Hepublican hopefuls). New York Times columnist Gail Collins writes, "Huckabee's problems say more about the leaders of the reli­gious right than about him." 
Collins continues: "Considerations like who has the most Christian atti­tudes toward illegal immigrants don't register. And the fact that as governor Huckabee spent a lot of time trying to spend money on the needy d()(~sn't go over all that well 
with the ones who believe that God's 
top priority is eliminating the estato 
tax." 
lndeod, tlw d1~ath tax has been a major part of the discussion among the votors who have seiznd both "life" and "values" as their own. 
At tlw Values Voters Summit. the Republican candidates stooped to a competition in pandering, each attempting to prove himself to be the man of tho Christian right. 
Formerly pro-choice and noted Mormon, Homney somehow came out on top. Giuliani did not fare as well (though few expected a brilliant reception f'or the pro-choicn mayor with a tendency to support gay mar­riage and with a marriage record of his own). 
In tho wonks before the Summit, it was the death tax, rather than per­sonal n~eord of soeial conservatism. that was the point in question. 
"Let's kill th1~ death tax!" was the rallying cry of' Mitt Homnoy in New Hampshin~. Hudy (~iuliani took it a step furthl)r: "Let's give the death tax the death penalty!" 
We can't be sure if Hudy's state­ment was values-ladnn or not. But in the context of this piece, it undor­lincs the trend of inconsistencies among America's def'endcrs of life and values.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Uproar over Weis'late-gallle decisions 
Weis made right call 
In response to Chris Malherek's "Football, not fans, a disgrace" (Nov. 1) I can only say I partially agree. However, we cannot place the full weight of this season's struggles on the team or oven Charlie Weis. We simply do not have experience. We start double the amount of freshman and sophomore players as our opponents. Our upper classes are small, and the talent is lacking. Weis' top recruits just need some playing time and they will take us back to the top. 
Regarding the Navy game, many Notre Dame fans were upset by Weis' decision to pass the ball on fourth-and-7 late in the fourth quarter when the game was tied. A field goal would have put us up by 3. Why not kick it? Simple: We do not have a kicker that can kick a 41-yard field goal into the wind during practice, so why now? Brandon Walker's longest warmup at that side of the field was 37 yards. Our chances are better when we go for it than when we try to kick. 
Matt Mooney sophomore Alumni Hall Nov. 4 

Athletes owe students loyalty too 
I am writing with regards to the Navy football game this past Saturday. Of course, it was a tough loss and I am sure our team was discouraged and tired after the game. But after we students stood and cheered for over four hours and through three over­times, I think we deserved to have the team raise their helmets to us as they have in years past. This season, it has only been one or two players a game, and after the Navy game it was none. Win or lose, we will always be there cheering because they are our team. I just really want them to give us that one gesture of thanks. We are loyal to them; I wish they showed their loyalty to us. So after the last few games of the season, I really and truly hope that the team revives this tradition. 
The other instance of loyalty I wish to address is to Coach Weis. I know that many students and fans disagreed with his decisions during the game, but that is absolutely no excuse whatsoever for the students to boo when the band played the 1812 Overture after the game. He is still our coach, no matter what. We still owe him respect, if not admiration. Loving Notre Dame football means being loyal when times are bad so that you deserve to be called a Notre Dame fan when times are good.

9-3 isn't good enough? 
After the season two years ago, Coach Weis proudly announced to members of the Notre Dame community that his 9-3 record wasn't good enough. Well, how about 3-9? That's about as good as this season could turn out. 
There have been all sorts of excuses tossed around for our misfortune this. season, and until this weekend, many of them seemed to be fair. Not anymore. Everyone likes to put the blame on Ty Willingham for our suppressed talent, but getting beaten by Navy has nothing to do with talent. We refuse to believe that they are a more talented team than us. The problem, it seems, is coaching. Many of the calls on Saturday were simply awful. One of our personal favorites was the fake field goal attempt. Here's a great idea: Let's try to run the not-so-quick Evan Sharpley for 15 yards behind the lead block of a kicker. Brilliant. 
Also, if anyone could possibly explain to us why you would not try to kick a field goal for the win at the end of regulation, that would be great. That's terrible decision mak­ing. Absolutely terrible. 
The play calling wasn't the only flaw we saw with the coaching job. How could we not stop the option? What was the defense practicing all week? It's not like Navy did anything surprising. They've been running the same offense for years. Everybody knew exactly what they were going to do, and yet they came in and ran all over us anyway. Coach Weis has been one of the first to admit that coaching has been the biggest prob­lem this year, but we're sick of hearing that. How about you earn your incredibly high salary and start coaching better? 
Tony Ceravolo, Brent Gills juniors Knott Hall Nov. 3 
Time for Charlie to go 
After yet the latest shameful coaching performance by "genius" Charlie Weis, it's clear that it's time for him to leave. This isn't (just) about losing; this isn't (just) about five straight home losses and being on pace for one of the worst records in school history; this isn't (just) about his losing the 43-game winning streak against Navy. 
It's about how unprepared the team looks every week. Navy's offense runs the triple option on every play -why did the defense look confused throughout the first half? Even beyond that, this is about the puzzling and stupid playcalling decisions Weis makes every game. Fourth-and-15 and up by seven? Fake field goal! A one-point lead with 10 minutes left and a successful running attack? Let's pass the ball! Fourth-and-8 with less than a minute left in a tie game deep in the opponent's territory? Go for it! 
Weis is an excellent recruiter: There is no question about that. But good recruiting and good players will never win with horren­dous game plans, schizophrenic depth chart decisions and awful in-game adaptations. The University needs to thank Charlie for his service, and ask him to leave. If he refuses, I'm sure there are enough enraged alumni to buy out his contract. Anything to stop the bleeding. 
Stephen Mann junior Stanford Hall Nov. 3 
Help make a dream come true 

I am writing today to enlist the support of the Notre Dame community to help send one of our design students on the ride of a lifetime. Mallory McMorrow is a senior industrial design student whose dream it is to design cars. Through her hard work and effort, she has become a final­ist in the Mazda Design Challenge on Facebook, and it's up to Facebookers worldwide to decide who will win an oppor­tunity to go to the LA Auto Show and create their winning design in a full size clay model right on the show floor with the Mazda design team. 
The last day to vote is Tuesday. Please log on to Facebook and join the Mazda Design Challange Group to vote. You can vote on both Monday and Tuesday. This would be a huge win for both Mallory and the University of Notre Dame Design department. 
Please help a fellow Domer today with just a few clicks of your time.

Men's behavior not insulting 
This is in response to Marilynn Anater's Letter to the Editor ("Behavior Insulting," Nov. 2). I would like to inform Ms. Anater that she does not speak for all the women of the Notre Dame community or even those of the Saint Mary's community. As a fellow Saint Mary's sophomore and former cheerleader, I must respectfully remind Ms. Anater that cheerleaders, and espe­cially college cheerleaders, choose their activity with the knowledge that they will often be viewed as "objects." Cheerleading is an activity that involves jumping around and screaming in short skirts. It's athletic and impressive, but at the end of the day, men hooting and hollering at cheerleaders is a part of the college football experience that needs to be laughed off. I agree. that men of the Notre Dame community should conduct themselves with class at all times, but accusing them of piggishness for "objectifying" the other team's miniskirt-wearing crew is just wrong. 
I would encourage Ms. Anater to realize that militant feminism is not necessary in every cor­ner of the college experience. As a woman, I took no offense to the actions of the Notre Dame and Holy Cross men in this case. As with all the hooplah over the admittedly humorous and infamous "Russian Bride" cartoon, this is yet another example of people taking things far too personally. Come on, ladies. Lighten up.

In addition to the extravagant eos­tunw and set designs, "Elizabeth: The Goldnn Agn" has a strong cast. But the aetors sonwtimns seem constrained in their roles. Geoffrey Hush returns as Elizabeth 'sadviser and spymastnr. Sir Francis Walsingham. In the previous film. Hush's t:onniving, Machiavelli­quoting eharaeter stole sevoral scent~s and gains the audience's n~spect as he becomes indispensible to the new qunen. Whiln he still employs brutal mothods to ensure Elizabeth's seeurity in this film. his acting is less animated, and lw fails to reach his full potential. 
Clive Owen is also underused, and his role as Walter Haleigh is mon~ like his static eharacter in

Cornish). 

Despite thn lilm's largt~ and imperson­al seope, Blanehett manages to provide a multi-faceted representation of <)ueen Elizabeth. But her pnrformanee is less dynamic than her previous one. The first role d11pietnd Elizabeth's transfor­mation from an idealistic, passionate young woman into a shrewd, dignified queen, but lwrc tho transformation is alrnady complete. 
Viewers can sympathize with Blanchett's charactflr, however, as her morals conrliet with the actions she must take, making hnr weighty deci­sions dil'fieull. Also, Blanehett powerful­ly shows Elizabnth's inner turmoil when she must relinquish a relationship with Halt~igh to uphold her duties as queen. 
Despite Blanehett's strong perform­anee, Kapur sometimes turns her char­acter into a figurine with exeessive artistic techniques. Several scenes con­sist of a still shot of Elizabeth, with dra­matic ehoral music blaring in the back­ground. If used sparingly, this technique could accentuate the queen's power; with overuse, it loses its effect and bneomes tedious. 
Evon though "Eiizabnth: The Golden Age" has somn strong elenwnts, what could bn a com­ptdling study of Queen Elizabnth's charaeter gets lost in tlw immensity of the plot. Tlw film shows that no amount of glamorous seenery, aetion­paeknd battles or scandalous love affairs can substitute for a streamlinnd plot and solid char­aetnrs.

But for We is-who eoaches his p1ayers to stay on mesq~age, to never say anything that eould be eonstruod as almost possibly controversial -this is a new level of separation from reali­ty. 
Wnis insists his job as head coach forces him to think only about the next week. Now, that means trying to beat Air Force next Saturday. But that does­n't explain why Weis-and the play­ers he coaches so well -would deny the obvious. The stunned silence belied the proposterous notion that none of the Irish were thinking about ho~ the they became the first Notre Dame team since 1963 to lose to the Naval Academy.

"I don't think you can give them credit fi>r what happened from 1963 on," Johnson said. "I certainly don't want any of thn crodit for it." 
The difl(Jrence bntweem Weis and Johnson, though, is their view of the past. Johnson is trying to break away from it and establish a new legacy in Annapolis; Weis has made a habit of trying to relate with Notre Dame's his­tory. 
And he certainly has shown an undnniablc ability to connect with the past. Weis will go down in history as the coach of the Notre Dame team that sufliwed iL<> worst loss to rival USC.

Running backs a lonely highlight 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Writer 
Notre Dame's running back combina­tion of James Aldridge, Armando Allen and Travis Thomas was one of the team's lone bright spots in its loss to Navy Saturday. 
Aldridge was the Irish workhorse, running 32 times for a career-high 125 yards. 
"1 am just going in and running hard," Aldridge said. "I am trusting in my linemen, trusting they open up some holes and take advantage of the situation. It is an opportunity game and get some yards and take advantage of it." 
Irish coach Charlie Weis said his game plan was to stick to the running game, ostensibly to exploit Navy's undersized defense. 
"We went into the game figuring we were going to run the ball a whole bunch of times ... with efficiency," Weis said. "And for a good part of ihe day,

The Midshipmen are in the bottom third of the Football Bowl Subdivision, surren­dering 4.4 yards per carry, despite fac­ing only the 70th toughest schedule this season, according to Jeff Sagarin's col­lege football rankings. 
Notre Dame managed only 3.7 yards per attempt Saturday but moved the ball consistently when it committed to the running game. 
On its third-quarter possession that led to a missed field goal, the Irish ran on 10 consecutive plays and gained 43 yards. The drive stalled when Irish quarterback Evan Sharpley threw incomplete passes on second-and third-and-1 0. 
Despite Notre Dame's 235 yards rush­ing, the Irish total offense remained last in the nation with an average of 208 yards per game. The rushing offense, however, moved out of No. 119. Notre Dame has gained 56.44 yards per game. Duke is averaging 56.11.

The win keeps the Patriots (9-0) on course for the NFL's first unbeat­en season since Miami did it 1972 and gives them the first tiebreaker over Indianapolis (7 -1) in the AFC playoffs. 
"This is the first time we were in a ballgame late," said Brady, whose team had never before trailed in the fourth quar­ter and had beaten its previous eight opponents by an average of 25 points a game. "There wasn't any loss of confi­dence or determination." 
Added New England linebacker .Junior Seau: "We were going against a hostile crowd, an unde­feated team, we took our hats off to them. But we still played well enough to win." 

New England, which had been scoring more than 41 points a game, had piled points on late in several games in which they were far ahead, including last week's 52-7 win over Washington, when they kept playing hard well into the fourth quarter. 
In this contest, antici­pated since the schedule came out last April, they had to work their hardest just to win against per­haps the only team in the NFL close to them. 
"We had an opportunity to do a lot of things," said running back Joseph Addai, the Colts' best offensive player on this day with 112 yards rush­ing and a 73-yard score on a short pass from Peyton Manning. "We left some points squandered and got field goals when we should have gotten touchdowns, but that's the nature of the game. Those guys are good. We'll see them again." 
New England trailed 20­10 after Manning. who threw for 225 yards and a touchdown. scored on a 1-yard sneak with 9 min­utes and 42 seconds left in the game, and the crowd roaring.

TUCSON, Ariz. -Arizona coach Lute Olson is taking a leave of absence for unspecified personal reasons.

By ELLYN MICHALAK Sports Writer 
After two eonference wins this weekend, Notre Dame jumped into a tie for fifth plaee in the Big East. The Irish share the No. 5 spot with Connecticut and USF. 
Notre Dame took down the Bulls, as well as Georgetown, at the Joycn Center this weekend. The Irish are currently 7-5 against conference opponents and 11-12 overall. 
In Friday's competition. the Irish easily handled Georgetown, shutting them out 3-0 (30-16, 30­20, 30-14). 
Two Irish players earned dou­ble-doubles in the mateh. Senior captain and outside hitter Adrianna Stasiuk recorded 14 kills and 10 digs and senior set­ter Ashley Tarutis pitched in with 38 assists and 10 digs. Junior middle blocker Justine Stremick also helped dominate, she earned 13 kills and seven blocks, while freshman Iibera Angela Puente aided the defense with 13 overall digs. 
The Irish beat the Hoyas for the ninth straight time in series history. The Irish hold a 17-1 series record over Georgetown. 
The Irish trumped the Hoyas with a .395 offensive attack per­centage. On defense, the Irish all took care of business holding the Hoyas to a .031 attack percent­age. 
Notre Dame kept its momen­tum rolling into Sunday's match where it earned a 3-1 win (30­25, 30-24, 21-30, 30-21) pushing their home winning streak to four matches. 
Notre Dame had 72 overall kills against USF. While the Irish earned a .275 hitting percentage in the day's 


match, several Irish players effectively aided offensive play. Freshman middle blocker Kellie Sciacca earned 10 kills while sophomore outside hitter Serinity Phillips and Stremick accounted for most of Notre Dame's kills in the match and Tarutis posted 20 assists. Puente dominated the Irish defense with 18 digs, tying her career best. 
"I think we really had a good mind frame in both of this week­end's matches," Stasiuk said. "We came in to eompete and we really had a lot of motivation to win and get [a] better place for the Big East tournament." 
The Irish will host both Cincinnati and Louisville this earning weekend at the Joyce Center in their season's fmal two conference games. The Irish will then move on to Milwaukee to compete in the Big East quarter­finals. 
"We definitely have to work really hard this week to prepare for next weekend's games," Stasiuk said. "Cincinnatti and Louisville are both really tough competitors."

Despite playing at less than full strength, No. 10 Notre Dame defeated Hutgers 2-0 in the Big East tournament quar­terfinals Sunday at Alumni Field. 
Irish junior forward Brittany Bock and sophomore midlield­er Courtney Hosen sat out with injuries, and senior captain Amanda Cinalli played despite the death of her grandfather Friday. 
"If we'd have been in a real crunch. we could have used 1 Bock and Hosen l." Irish eoach Handy Waldrum said. "And Cinalli played but she was a littln fatigued, and I'm sure her mind was elsewhere." 
But Irish junior forward Kerri llanks provided enough ol'fensn to overcomn those out­side factors. She notched an assist in the first half then added an insurance goal late in the second. 
Hanks created several good scoring chances early, and the Irish finally converted with just over 12 minutes remain­ing before intermission.
