by Sue Wuetcher Senior Staff Reporter 
Vice President for Student Affairs Fr. John Van Wolvlear has disapproved a resolution submitted by the Campus Life Council that would have given jurisdiction on parietal offenses to hall Judicial Boards. 
In a letter to CLC members and other leaders in Student Govern­ment, Van Wolvlear stated, ''The present system seems to be work, ing efficiently and justly. No convincing reasons have been ad­
vanced to justify the proposed change to concurrent jurisdiction. I feel that any change might lessen the importance of parietals." 
Yesterday Van Wolvlear told The Observer that parietals violations considered truly serious, sensitive, or involving pastoral concern are not appropriate for a judicial board. 
"Any serious problem would lose confidentiality by talking about it with the hall J-boards." Van Wolvlear said. "I don't know how public those things become. We try to keep things confidential.'' 
Van Wolvlear noted that the present system is working effi­ciently and justly, adding, "Ifthere were any problems I would con­sider it (the proposal.)" 
Van Wolvlear's reply must now go back to the CLC for rebuttal, accordingto Mike Roohan, Student Body vice president. 
"Now it's up to the committee to redefine the proposal and resubmit it to Van Wolvlear," Roohan said. "I think individual action by the Student Body president and the judicial coordiator will be taken if the CLC does nothing. The proposal can be resubmitted to the provost.'' 
"Look at the issue," Roohan remarked. "Parietals belong in the hall in the light of what was said at the Student Rights Forum.'' Roohan noted that Dean ofStudents James Roemer called parietals an offense against privacy and quiet hours, and were better off handled in the individual halls. 
Roohan added that when the Board of Trustees removed stu­dents from the University Judicial Board last year they promised to 
give more responsibility to the hall 
J-Boards. 
"I think it's highly probably tht 
that the case will be resubmitted, 
said Roohan. 
Rizzo surprised-
Judicial Coordinator Jayne Rizzo, who originally submitted the parietals proposal to the CLC, stated that she was surprised by the letter she received from Van Wolvlear. "There was no reason or rationale behind it," Rizzo said. "It doesn't point out where my reasoning is faulty.'' 
Rizzo partly blames herself how­ever for Van Wolvlear's rejection of the proposal. "In forming the proposal," she said, "I didn't transmit the arguments that I outlined at the CLC meeting. Van Wolvlear was there, so I neglected to outline the arguments in the formal proposal.'· 
The judicial coordinator noted that parietals are presently handled in dorms by the rectors. "Students don't have the option of going before the J-board," she said. "This wouldn't less~n the impor­tance of parietals. Students are taking a mature, responsible, gov­ernance of their own lives," 
The J-Boards are working, Rizzo observed. "There has been more than one hall where a student has been referred to the J-Board in a concurrent situation, such as al­

••• and 0-C lottery becomes certainty 
by Mark Rust Senior Staff Reporter 
Describing a lottery forcing seniors to be off campus as ''a virtual certainty," Housing Director Ed­mund Price said last night that "there doesn't seem to be any alternative to it." 
The decision to randomly move an undetermined amount of seniors off campus results from the rejec­tion by the Housing Office of six alternate measures proposed by the Campus Life Council (CLC) to alleviate overcrowding on campus.

"It is a decision that has been in the air for some time now, and there doesn't seem to be any alternative to it, ""Price said. 
Options Available: Roohan 
However, Stude'nt Body Vice-President Michael Roohan tem­pered Price's comments last night with the observation that "there are still options available." 

"We are dealing with a lot of varibles,'' Roohan said. •'Say more people go overseas next year, or say more people voluntarily go off campus. In that case, there would be no need for a lottery." 
''Everything I say, everything Mr. Price says, has to be taken with a grain of salt at this point,'' Roohan said. 
Roohan said that the possibility of three varibles will have an effect on whether or not a lottery would actually take place. According to Roohan, the variables are: a de­crease in enrollment for next year; an increase in the number of people who voluntarily move off campus; and a decision by the University officers to increase on-campus housing through a capital gains investment. 
''All that we can say for sure at this point," Roohan continued, "is that there is strong statistical evidence that there is a need for more people to move off, campus than there has been in the last two 
,.
years. 
"If you went back to the trends of two years ago, we'd actually end up with more dorm space than we need." Roohan added.

SU record store 'is not warranted· 
by Pat Mangon 
After two proposals and nee.riy a semester of debate, Fr. John Van Wolvlear, vice-president of Student 
Affairs,  has  said  "no"  to  th(:  
proposed  Student  Union  rec9td.  
store.  
Revealing  his ·decision  y(;ster·  

day, Van Wolvlear said, "It is a 
service that is not warranted:' 
He explained that John Reid, director of Student Activities, fre­quently receives requests from individual students who want to sei up their own businesses on cam, pus. "So," he continued, "in order to be consistent, we have t<) refuse group requests as well &s individual requests.'' 
Reid affirmed Van Wolvlear' ~ decision and added, '·while 1 want to commend Bill Roche and hie; staff at the Student Union for the fine job they did in researching the proposal, I also think that the main purpose of the Student Union is to serve the more immediate needs of the students, such as academic, cultural and social needs.'' 
In a one-page letter to Roche, director of the SU, Van Wolvlear cited two reasons for the decision. 
"First, a real need for a record stores does not.exist. And while we don't deny that the students are interested in purchasing records, we question the proposition that a Student Union record store would be meeting a serious need of the students," Wolvlear said. 
He continued, "Second, we think that it is not the main function of the Student Union to get involved in operating businesses." 
Roche said, ••My reaction to the whole thing is that when I made the proposal, I was responding to a valid need. It took a long time to get an answer. I respect the right of Student Affairs to make the decision; however, I am disappoin­ted and I don't think a good argument was raised against it." 
The SU director also said that the -problem still existed and cited the advertisement placed by the Book­store in Friday's Observer. 
"With a sale price of$4.99 on four Kiss albums and the latest Donny and Marie (Osmond) release, my point is obvious: the selection of albums at the Bookstore is poor and the prices are too high," Roche said. 
Wolvlear cited other reasons that he called "extraneous" --ex­traneous because his decision is really made on "principle." He included issues such as security, inventory and continuity under this heading. 
Commenting on the issue of continuity, Wolvlear said that he had confidence in Roche and his staff, but he pointed out that future staffs may not handle the job as well or be as interested. '•Then you would have thousands of dollars invested in an inventory and great problems." 
Responding to this point, Roche said, "There is the possibility of this problem, but we are now already managing a budget of over a million dollars."

I===========World 
Indian crowd .ieers Gandhi 
NEW DELHI, India [AP]-Jeers drowned out the applause when former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi returned to India's parliament yesterday to take the seat she had won in a special election earlier this month. It was the first time she has held an elected post since her 11-year rule ended 20 months ago in a stunning electoral defeat. 
Mrs. Gandhi's stormy re-entry into parliament is part of a political comeback that her supporters hope will lead to the prime minister's post.

Airlines get extension 
W ASIDNGTON [AP]-Airlines have been given an extra four weeks, until Jan. 20, to begin serving routes they claimed earlier this month under the new airline deregulation bill. The Civil Aeronautics Board originally said service would have to start by Dec. 24, but several airlines said they would have difficulty meeting that requirement because of the heavy holiday travel season. 
Post o_ffree limits mail size 
WASHINGTON (AP]-Starting next spring new postal rules will go into effect limiting the size of mail you can send. Under the rules a minimum size must be met before mail can be accepted, and officials are planning an extra charge for large or odd-size mail. Both rules will take effect sometime next March or April, according to postal officials. 

DiRgs receives sentence 
W ASIDNGTON [AP]-Rep. Charles Diggs was ordered yesterday to serve three years in prison for mail fraud and making false statements after a judge brushed aside ar2uments that his re-election this month meant he should be in Congress not jail. Diggs, D-Mich., was found guilty Oct. 7 of inflating the salaries of staff members and then accepting kickbacks from them to pay business, personal and congressional expenses.

1srae1 plans. to acceptprevtously reJectea treaty 
JERUSALEM [AP] Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin wants to tum back the clock in negotiat­ions with Egypt and is ready to accept a U.S. -sponsored draft of the peace treaty that his govern­ment rejected four weeks ago, sources familiar with the talks said yesterday. 
Begin is prepared to accept a vaguely-worded clause linking the treaty to the development of Palestinian self-rule on the Israeli­occupied West Bank of the Jordan River and the Gaza Strip, the sources said. 
~e point of linkage in the treaty has been the obstacle that has threatened the progress of the talks in recent weeks. 
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat said in a television interview last night that he was willing to meet again in a summit with Begin "anywhere but" Jerusalem to try to resolve the remaining "10 percent'' of problems over a peace treaty. 
In the interview Sadat said he would "insist" that the final treaty besigned with Begin "on the top of Mount Sinai, on my land" and that he would refuse to go to Jerusalem again. 
"I have already gone there once and I'm not going to start again. But I am ready to meet Mr. Begin anywhere else," the Egyptian leader said. 
Sadat also insisted that no pea~e treaty would be signed that failed to deal with the Palestinian prob­lem. 
"If Gaza and the West Bank are not treated in an overall settle­ment, no one should count on us to conclude peace," he said. "It is

serious, because it is a point of fundamental principle." 
Sadat revealed that he received a personal message from President Carter dealing with the status of Jerusalem, which he said was "Quite satisfactory." 
Although the issue of Jerusalem will be a point of controversy and difficulty, I believe we (Egyptians) have demonstrated good will and we declared that the city will not be divided again and that Jewish Holy spots -the Wailing Wall-can be under their control,'' Sadat told his interviewers. 
Replyin~ to Sadat' s television interview, Begin said in Jerusalem that he was "happy" Sadat wants to conclude the peace treaty soon. 
But he appeared to ignore Sadat' s wish not to travel to Jerusalem, by repeating his offer: "Let us sign the peace treaty in both Jerusalem and Cairo -that is just." 
else, and they were keeping a tight rein on what information they did have. State Police Lt. Richard Jones said autopsies showed that two of the four were shot to death, one died of stab wounds and the other of head injuries, but he refused to elaborate. 
The lndlanapoUs News reported that two were shot in the backs of their head, execution-styled, as they lay face down on the ground, although officials refused to confirm or deny that. 
State police spokesman Glenn Webber said only that investigators were making an extensive search of the area where the bodies were found ''with hopes of uncovering some type of evdence.'' 
Burger Chef Systems announced a $25,000 reward yesterday for information leading to the arrest and convictions of persons respon­sible for the deaths. 
Investigators were analyzing a loaded .38-caliber revolver found late Saturday along the route believed taken by the robbers to determine if it was used in the abduction. They said the gun showed no sign of rust or exposure to the elements. 
The workers were found missing about 1 a.m. Saturday when an off-duty employee went to help them clean up and found the back door ajar. Police said they found two empty currency bags next to the open safe, but manager Robert Gilyeat said a check of cash register tapes showed no more than $500 has taken. 
Gilyeat said the four were hard­working and reliable, an observa­tion echoed by friends, relatives and co-workers. 







Massacre in Guyana 

Zealots flee remote compound 
GEORGETOWN,GUYANA [AP) ­Troops swept through a steaming jungle yesterday in search of American religious zealots who fled their remote compound and left behind a scene of horror and death -the bodies of at least 383 fellow cultists, some shot, most appar­ently poisoned by their own hands in a mass suicide. 
Soldiers counted 163 women, 138 men and 82 children among the dead. They all were believed to be 
Americans.  Many reportedly had  
lined up  to  take doses of poison  
from a tub.  

Among the bodies found at the camp were those of the sect's fanatical founder, the Rev. Jim Jones, his wife and one of their children, said Police Chief C. Augustus.

The mass deaths apparently occurred about an hour or more after members of the California sect, People's Temple, ambushed a visiting investigative group led by Congressman Leo. J. Ryan,· killing Ryan und four others. 
Augustus said there was no evidence of gunshot wounds on the bodies of Jones,his wife or child. "It appears that they drank some poison,'' he said. 
Still unaccounted for were bet­ween 500 and 900 of Jones' followers, who fled into the jungle around the agricultural commune, 150 miles northwest of the South American capital. 
The killings and mass suicide, triggered by Ryan's inspection visit, apparently were the final cry of a violence-hardened and para­
noid group that saw the world closing in. 
American Lawyer Mark Lane, who escaped from the jungle camp just before the mass d~aths, told reporters of terrifying hours he and another attorney, Charles Garry, spent in the camp and the rainy 
jungle nearby late Saturday and Sunday. 
Lane, a prominent champion of controversial cases and a legal counsel to the sect, said he and Garry were barred from a mass meeting at the camp, Jonestown, but that they heard residents discussing communal suicide over a loudspeaker. Lane said one spoke of ''the beauty of death as part of our struggle.'' 
.The cultists reportedly had long considered mass suicide if they felt their sect threatened. Jones and the sect had been under investigat­ion in California before he founded the Guyana camp last year. 
Those killed in the ambush were the 53-year-old Ryan, a Democrat who represented a San Francis~o­Area district; reporter Don Hams, 42, and Cameraman Robert Brown, 36, both of NBC News and both Los Angeles residents, and a woman camp member who was trying to leave, identified as Patricia Parks, 18, though some U.S. officials said her name was Parker. Her hometown was not know. 
Ryan had gone to Guyana to investigate allegations from former members and others that Jones and the People's Temple were guilty of widespread abuse of members .

The Irish 
ra 
Seek 600th all-time victory 
Irish to invade LA Coliseum Saturday 
by Craig Chval Sports Writer 
Asking Notre Dame's football team to return to Los Angeles to play Southern Cal every two years could certainly fall under the category of cruel and unusual punishment. 
Because ever since the Irish won the 1966 national championship after a 51-0 Iaugher at the expense of USC, the Trojans have been dealing out severe retribution to any Irish clan that dare venture into Los Angeles' Memorial Coliseum. 
Southern Cal spoiled Notre Dame's 1970 national title hopes with a 38-28 victory that was accomplished despite 526 yards passing by Irish quarterback Joe Theismann. 
Two years later, the entire nation was treated to Anthony Davis' six-touchdown perf9rmance as the Torjans routed their guests 45-23. 
Since that 1966 Notre Dame romp, the Irish have defeated USC only twice--in 1973 and 1977. Both victories came in Notre Dame Stadium. 
'The last time Notre Dame traveled to Los Angeles on the crest of a one-game winning streak over USC, the Trojans scored 49 second-half points to pull off the most celebrated comeback in years, 55-24. 
Entering Saturday's 50th meeting between the schools, the Trojans are 9-1 after Saturday's 17-10 win over UCLA, which is sending Coach John Robinson's · club to the 1979 Rose Bowl. 
The Irish, meanwhile, were in the process of dismantling Georgia Tech 38-21--when they weren't dodging tor­rents of fish being hurled out of the Georgia Tech stands. 
The victory clinched a return trip to the Cotton Bowl for the Irish, where they

will face the Southwest Conference champion in attempt to retain the Cotton Bowl title, if not the national crown. 
One week after holding Georgia Tech's Eddie Lee Ivery in check, the Irish defense will be tested by the latest in a long line of glorious Trojan tailbacks, junior Charles White. With another year of eligibility remaining, White is already USC's all-time leading rusher with 3735 career yards. The 5-foot-11, 183-pounder passed Anthony Davis' milestone in the second half of Saturday's game. 
White is joined in the backfield by senior fullback Lynn Cain, who has rolled up 811 yards while playing in White's shadow. Of course, to play full: back at USC, . you must be able to block, and block well. Cain is no exception. 
The Trojans are quarterbacked by junior Paul McDonald, who has com­pleted over 55 percent of his passes, while throwing for over 1300 yards and 16 touchdowns in 10 games. 
But you can't average more than 400 yards of total offense per game without the horses up front. Heading up the Trojans' front wall is junior guard Brad Budde, the son of former Kansas City Chief all-pro guard Ed Budde. As a sophomore, Budde received honorable 
mention  on  both  wire  services'  All­

The Irish Extra 

Irish, Southern Cal boast 60 in NFL 
by lou Severino Sports Writer 
The success of the football programs at USC and Notre Dame can best be seen in the number of players from these school5 who have gone on to the pro. ranks and performed successfully. 
At the present time, the Trojans lead all colleges in the number of pro players produced with 39, while the Fighting Irish alumni in the NFL totals 21. The quality of these players is so high that an All-Star NO/USC team of present-day player5 could conceivably hold their own against any team in pro football. With that in mind I have selected a team composed solely of former Notre Dame and USC players. Here, then, is a look at this squad, begining with the offense. 
Offensive Tackles: Ron Yary (USC) and George Kunz (ND) will start at tackle Any successful team must have a strong offensive line and any unit with offensive tackles like these is of to a good start. Vary has been an All-Pro pick for several years while Kunz has been a solid NFL performer, although ham­pered by knee problems. 
Guards: Bobo Kuechenberg (ND) and Gerry Mullins (USC) will fill in the guard slot. Kuechenberg has been oversha­dowed by his Dolphin running mate at guard Larry Little, but he has been a key element in the success of the Miami ground game. Mullins has been a regular for the Steelers for most of his NFL career and is a fine pulling guard on sweeps. 
Center: Steve Sylvester (ND) is only in his fourth NFL season and has been a reserve behind Raiders' stalwart center Dave Dalby. However, at 6-4, 260, Sylvester does a fine job on specialty teams and my get a shot at the starting lineup within a few years. 
Tight End: Dave Casper (ND) is an easy selection. Casper has established himself as the best tight end in pro football. This 6-4, 240 pound All-Pro is the man to whom Kenny Stabler looks in clutch situations, and the majority of the time he gets the job done--combining his size, quickness (for a big man) and sure hands. 
Wide Receivers: Lynn Swann (USC) and Bob Chandler (USC) are an excellent combination of a speedy deep threat 

Steve Niehaus has to be included when speaking of great Irish defensive ends. 
They said it:_ 
White is the best ever' 

Tim Huffman 
. 
I'm very happy to be going back to the Cotton Bowl this year. It gives us an opportunity for bragging rights in Texas for another year. Also I remember a few people who said that I wouldn't make it a as a big time ball-player, and this gives me a chance to prove them wrong. 
Dan Devine 
I don't think there is a football team in the country that, year in and year out, puts as many talented football players on the field as Southern Cal does. Everyone knows about the succession of great tailbacks they've had, and Charles White is the best of them all. It's a typical USC team--big, fast, and difficult to stop at this point in the season . 
John Robinson 
I'm a little concerned about us being mentally and physically tired after playing our last five games with our backs to the wall (in contending for rhe Pac 10 title) But the spirit is willing. This is a game we have waited for all year. They embarassed us last year in South Bend, and we have vivid memo­ries of that game. A.lso the tradition of this game is second to none and 1t will be on national television. There should be reasons enough to try like heck and play our best game of the year. 
(Swann) and a reliable short pass threat 
(Chandler.) Swann currently leads the 
AFC with 52 receptions, nine of which 
have gone for six points. Chandler is not 
as well-known, but last year he led the 
Buffalo Bills with 60 receptions. 
Quarterback: Pat Haden (USC) will be 
the signal-caller in this All-Trojan back­
field. This Rhodes Scholar has had a fine 
season at the helm of the Los Angeles 
Rams, completing 155 of 296 passes for 
2,006 yards and 10 touchdowns. More 
importantly, he's led the Rams to a 10-2 
record-tops in the NFL, along with the 
Pittsburgh Steelers whom the Rams 
defeated 10-7 last Sunday. 
Running Backs: O.J. Simpson and Sam Cunningham (USC) are another example of a tremendous combination of a super outside threat and a power inside runner. Although Simpson has been hampered by injuries, he is still a threat every time he touches the ball. Despite playing behind a weak 49er offensive line, "The Juice" has still managed to roll up 593 yards despite missing several games with injuries. Cunningham is not only an outstanding blocker, he is also the most dangerous runner in goal line situations with his hurdling reckless­ness. Any team with this backfield would be assured of a superior ground game. 
Kicker: Bob Thomas (NO), a target of much fan abuse in the past two years, has silenced his critics with outstanding kicking throughout the first twelve weeks of the season. He leads the league in field goal accuracy with 15 of 17 three-pointers and has added 18 extra points for a total of 63. He's been one of the few bright spots in what has been a dismal season for the Bears. 
As you can see from the offensive selections, USC has had the edge in offensive performers placed in the pros. But as we will see from the defensive picks, the Irish have the edge in players picked for this unit, expecially in the front five. Note: Because neither team has produced a pro-middle linebacker our _defense will use five men up front. 
Ends: Ross Browner (NO) and Steve Niehaus (NO) hold down the defensive end spots. Despite losing valuable playing time because of a pre-season injury, Ross Browner has moved into the starting lineup for Cincinnati and per­formed very well. Browner has been shifted back and forth from end to noseguard, but has used his quickness and strength equally well at both spots. Niehaus has also had injury problems, but should be a steady player for Seattle for many years to come. 
Tackles: Alan Page (NO) and Mike McCoy (NO) are my selections at tackle. Page is up in years but still does a orettv good job for a 33-year-old, .220-pound defensive tackle. McCoy would more than make up for Page's lack of size with his 6-6, 275-pound frame. McCoy is the middle man in the Raiders 3-4 defense and is another Raider acquisition who has played well after a change of scenery. 
Noseguard: Mike Fanning (NO) has alternated with Cody Jones at defensive tackle for the Rams and shown flashes of brilliance. If he can become more consistent, this 6-6, 260 pounder will be a mainstay in the Rams defense which has been one of the best in the NFL this season. 
Linebackers: Charlie Weaver (USC) and Willie Hall (USC) are similar in size (6-2, 225) and in style of play, as both are outstanding against the pass covering running backs out of the backfield. Hall has been particularly effective in the Raiders 3-4 alignment. 
Cornerbacks: Skip Thomas (USC) and Luther Bradley (NO) are strong in the defensive backfield. Thomas is a starter in the Raider defensive secondary that intercepted 26 passes last season. He accounted for five of those pick offs, and is also excellent in coming up to stop the run. Bradley has missed the last three weeks with a leg injury, but was starting for Detroit before his injury. Bradley has an outstanding future ahead of him. Hopefully, his·club will also have such a future. 
Safeties: Charles Phillips (USC) and Marvin Cobb (USC) round out the defensive backfield. The secondary is completed with these two fine safeties, both starters in the AFC. Phillips has been playing for Oakland; Cobb, for Cincinnati.

The College football season is down to the last big week of regular season play before the top teams (over 30) begin to prepare for the bowl games. The titanic matchups this week include Notre Dame vs. USC; Ohio State vs. Michigan; and Penn State vs. Pitt. The Trojans, Wolverines and Nittany Lions are all still very much in the running for the national championship. So the TV sets will be burnt out after this Thanksgiving week­end is through. · 
Michigan at Ohio State: This is for a trip to the roses but in actuality it could be played on any practice field in any hick town and still be just as intense a battle. Michigan is definitely the favorite even though Woody Hayes and company are playing host. Michigan has a better offense and defense but statistics mean nothing when these two teams meet. Look for Leach to outshine Schlicter and that makes the difference as Schembech­ler's team pulls out a 9-point win. 
Arkansas at Southern Methodist: After being the most surprising team in the country in 1977, the Razorbacks have become the most disappointing a year later but still have managed to secure a bowl bid. SMU has played tough against an awesome schedule and looks as though they may be on their way back to national prominence. Lou Holtz may go off the deep end if he loses one more game. His team did pound Texas A&M last week, so the slump may be over. Expect it to be close one but the Razorbacks get the nod by 12. 
Pitt at Penn State: Joe Paterno needs to win two more games to secure his first MacArthur Bowl. He's so close that he can taste it. Usually this would be a good game but since the Panthers gave up 19 fourth quarter points to Notre Dame they haven't been the same: The game is at Beaver Stadium, so cancel any notions of an upset. Penn State's defense will smother the Pitt offense and Paterno may just have his boys run the Panthers into the ground to make Bear wonder if he really wants to go to the Sugar Bowl. Take Penn St. and give as many as 14 points. 
florida at Florida State: They may not be the top two teams in the nation but 
when you play for home turf bragging 
rights the past means nothing. The 
Seminoles trampled Navy last week and 
are statistically a much stronger team. 
However, the Gators are no slouch and 
would like to avenge last year's setback. 
Both teams have decent running games so expect to see the front lines battle it out. Whoever is standing at the game's end will be declared the winner. Florida State should be there with a 9-point win. 
Kentucky at Tennessee: Johnny Major's team was down 17-0 before bouncing back to stun Ole Miss. The Volunteers have improved in every game and are sure to be a power within two years. Kentucky barely held on to beat Florida last week but usually plays up to the competition. It is a conference game not that anything is needed to get Tennessee fans excited. The Wildcats go in the favorite but Tennessee has come of age and will go ou(a 7-point winner. 
Indiana at Purdue: The Hoosiers almost caught the Buckeyes looking one week ahead but fell short by a field goal. Purdue may be down after losing their Rose Bowl ticket. They have been assured a bowl bid which may encourage lackadaisical play. The only thing that will save them is the home fans and the fact that Hermann is only a sophomore so there is always next year for him. The slingshot QB will lead the Boilermakers to a 4-point victory. 
Auburn at Alabama: This game will be played at Birmingham on Dec. 2. The Tigers spoiled Georgia's perfect confe­renee record last week but could put the 
Bulldogs back in the driver's seat with a win here. Bear only has to win this game
to make it to the Sugar Bowl to face Penn 
State for the national title. The Crimson 
Tide fans cannot cry that anyone took it 
away from them this year as they control 
their own destiny. For that reason alone 
1 can't see Auburn sneaking in with 
even a tie. I'll go with Bryant and Co. 
by 17· 
Georgia Ted-at Georgia: This game is not for two weeks which might be enough time for the Bulldog fans selling anti-Tech stickers at the ND game which shows there is no love lost between these two schools. Kelley and Ivery have proven that they have the talent to stick it to Georgia especially if the opposition is not mentally up. Both teams are going to a bowl game so some sponsor is going to be upset. I think Georgia will be watching the scoreboard to see what Barna is doing while the Yellowjackets Iight up the board in front of them. Tech grabs state honors with a 6-point victory. 
Houston at Texas Tech: The Cougars still have to win their last two conference games to get. a shot at the Irish in the Cotton Bowl. It is unlikely that they will lose both since Rice is the other opponent. Houston has been an awesome offense that will be giving Devine a few sleepless nights before 1979 rolls around. They have lost only one game to date and are riding a strong crest that should bring them to Dallas with a 10-1 record. Keep an eye on them as they win the next two games by a total of 60 points. 
Navy vs. Army [at Philadelphia]: Navy will limp into this game with three straight losses and a hospital full of injured players. Nevertheless, they earned their bowl bid which is more than any other military academv has been able to muster. The Middies have to be disappointed after a promising six weeks but this one comes down to pride. Regardless of each team's record, this game gathers national attention. This year Cadet fans will cringe as George Welsh's team takes its frustrations out against the Army forces en route to a 14 point win. 
Notre Dame at USC: The Irish bring in an eight game winning streak and certainly will be ready. USC just insured their spot in the Rose Bowl by beating UCLA but did so sloppily. The Trojan fans demand revenge for l~st year's embarrassment. Talentwise these two teams match-up very closely. Stopping Charles White will be the Irish's main objective while Robinson's crew will try and shut down the Heavens-Ferguson combination. The Trojan's have more at stake and should go in the favorite. But Dan Devine's team always plays well on national TV and are beginning to resemble his 1977 team. With that in mind I MAY BE WRONG BUT I'LL PICK NO BY 6. 


Titanic-struggles mark Irish-Trojan series 
by Gregory Solman Assistant Sports Editor 
Irish free safety Randy Harrison may well have summarized the most appeal­ing aspect of the Notre Dame-USC rivalry. 
"The National Championship seems to have hinged upon how well we've done against USC," Harrison surmised. 
And never was it more evident that in 1974 and 1977, years when the Irish success directly pivoted on the outcome of the crucial intersectional feud be­tween the two teams. 
When one considers that this series dates back to 1926 it is interesting to note that two of the great wins of both teams have occured within the past five years. 
There are a few remaining survivors of the 1974 55-24 massacre oJ Ara Par­seghian's last team on today's roster. 
You had to be there to believe it, and the fifth-year men that were, Pete Johnson, Jeff Weston, and Randy Har­rison, wish they hadn't. 
Recall: the Trojans had scored with 40 seconds left in the first half, but the Irish had already scored 24, and left the field with a 24-6 lead. The Irish were salting this particular classic away for the record books--or so they thought. 
"At halftime, we reminded the team of the 1964 game," remembers former USC Head Coach John McKay, ''It was 17-0 then, and 24-6 today ... so there wasn't much difference." The Trojans won 20-17 in 1964. 
"We needed something to happen, and it did, on Anthony Davis' kickoff return," expounded McKay, "We thought then that we could score on them anytime." 
Linebacker Pete Johnson, then a freshman. was assigned the duty of covering the kickoff return, as were teammates Weston and Harrison. 

"When Davis returned the ball 102 yards and did a little dance in the endzone, the momentun shifted so tremendously, it just snowballed for the rest of the game," reconects Johnson. "After that, we couldn't gather our­selves ... they didn't let up on us for a second. We were more. dazed than anything." 
"We were even warned by Ara to watch Uavis on the kickoff return," Weston points out, "Well, sure enough, he went all the way and the fans went wild. It's the loudest reaction I've ever heard in my life." 
"That was the turning point," mumbled a disconsolate Parseghian after the game, ''And then we had the punt return and we fumbled that.. .' his voice trailed off. "And they got good field position for the rest of the second saw the green jerseys, I immediately thought that they were giving us souvenir T-shirts. Then the captains said 'Put them on'... everyone just went bozo...we were pushing and shoving to squeeze in to see the mirror.'~ 
''The jerseys tapped all of our emotion­al feelings," remembers quarterback Joe Montana, who got the offensive honors of the day, "I think we had been keeping our emotions inside and they seemed to come out with the jerseys-­everybody liked them." Montana was a member of the team in 1974, but did not make the trip to Los Angelos ("They had a guy named Tom Clements here then.") 
After the game, there was controversy over who's idea thedersevs. were. One paper quoted Irish Coach "Digger" Phelps as being the perpetrator of the scheme (indeed, he had mysteriously tauted the birth of the 'Green Machine' the night before at the pep-rally.) 
Devine himself said a manager of the 1947 team had written to him to"implore that the Irish return to the green." Devine thought about it long and hard. He finally made his choice Saturday morning In retrospect, it it to Devine's credit that the final decision was made to go with the green. After all, in the world of sports, such melodramatic maneuvers either look extremely stupid or brilliant depending upon the outcome of the game. Devine agrees. 
"If we had gotten blown out," pondered Devine, ''The green jersey idea would have been considered one of

Irish must control USC's greatest tailback 
the observer Tuesday, November 21, 1978
8 
The Irish Extra 
by Mike Henry 
Sports Writer 
The tradition began in 1963, when home town boy Mike Garrett broke into USC Coach John McKay's !-formation as a tailback, and proceeded to rush 3,221 yards in three seasons and win the Heisman Trophy in 1965. 
The next jewel uncovered by the man now coaching at Tampa Bay was O.J. Simpson, who went on to even greater glory in the NFL after his marvelous accomplishments in the Coliseum. 
Clarence Davis fell heir to the legacy rn 1969, and then Anthony Davis arrived to drive conference dvals crazy and, mterestingly, to fold, spindle, mutilate, and just plain dance on the helmets of the Fighting Irish. 
After Davis left, McKay lost no time in unveiling Ricky Bell, a workhorse who ground opponents into the turf by averaging 5.2 yards a carry. 
John Robinson is now the head man at Rose Bowl-bound USC, and McKay did not leave him without his own stunning tailback. He is Charles White, a 5'11", 183-pound junior dervish who combines the grace of Anthony Davis with the straight-ahead power of Bell. His average career carry of 5.27 yards is better than that of any member of McKay's stable, and with one full year and two games left this season (against Notre Dame and Hawaii) he has already smashed Davis' USC career rushing 
-
mark. His 145 yards vs. UCLA gives him 3,739 yards for his 715 carries. 
"It's amazing how White has handled the pressure on him," Robinson mar­vels. "He's been an elusive type runner since his freshman year, with good balance, quickness and excellent accel­eration. And, over three years he's worked hard enough to have the power to punish tacklers in one-on-one situa­tions." 
White's most impressive performance came in an early season game versus the Crimson Tide in Birmingham. After he fumbled on the Alabama one-yard line in the first quarter, he took a pitchout on the Trojan's next possession and ram­bled forty yards for the score. A surprising upset was in motion. White finished the contest with 199 yards and for his efforts was rewarded with a cover story in Sports Illustrated. So impres­sive was White's performance that Bear Bryant claimed: "I can't remember ever playing against a tailback that can run like White." 
White, who has also returned kickoffs during his tenure at USC this season, is quick to downplay talk of his winning the Heisman Trophy. "I'm more concerned about the team than any individual honors," the intense White explains. "It would be nice to win the Heisman, but first and foremost, I want USC to win." ''I hate to lose. I strive every game to be

... Titanic struggles 
perfect--to perform as well as my ability allows," the slick junior continues. "I go 100% whether I'm supposed to carry the ball, fake into the line or block for our fullback, Lynn Cain. The main 
reason  I  came  to  USC  was  for  the  
challenge  involved--to  play  the  best  
competition in the world."  

White certainly has such an opportun­ity this Saturday when the Cotton 
[continued from page 7] the worst foul-ups in the history of Notre Dame football." 
In any event, the Irish rolled. A psychological game that smacked of Peter Lorre ended up smelling as sweet as fresh green clover. 
"We played well in every aspect of the game," commented Irish lineman Ted Horansky, "That was a good USC team out there last year, and we completely dominated them." 
"I don't think that any team domin­ates USC physically," commented Devine on how emotions played a role in the outcome of the game, "So you can extrapolate what you want from that to account for the large difference in the score.'' 
Jay Case, playing on special teams, Bowl-bound Fighting Irish invade the Los Angeles Coliseum. The winner of the game will be in the top five going into their bowl game, perhaps with a shot at the national championship. For a fleet yet powerful back fromSouther.nCal named Charles White, it is a chance to continue a fine tradition by silencing the echoes and stilling Irish dreams of another great Irish finish. 
scored a touchdown. "It was certainly one of the highlights of my career ... maybe the most memorable event of my life at Notre Dame." 
Ironically, the three men that had all been a part of that fateful kickoff return as freshmen in 1974, were unable to play during the USC game of 1977. 
"I'll remember that 1974 game as long as I live," commented Weston, "Every­time I've played USC since then it has been a revenge match... I want to be able to say 'Hey, I beat USC while I was here.' '' 
\ The outcomes of future contests between these two teams may not be as unexpected, but as long as this great intersectional rivalry continues, you can be sure that there will be many players harboring similar feelings.

Lette~ ·to a lonely God 
I'd Rathet Be the Galloping Goutmet 
Reverend Robert Griffin 


I would never, on my own initiative, 
begin a discussion on sex. Some priests 
write books about sex. Some nuns teach 
classes on sex. Some laymen write books 
about sex and teach classes on sex, and run 
clinics to which clients with sexual prob­
lems can ¢orne. H I were they, I would be 
bored siQy; given my choice of being 
Masters ~r Jo)1nson, I would prefer to be 
the Galloping Gourmet. Sex, for me as 
for everyone else, is one of the enduring 
mysteries~ like the whereabouts of God. 
Since lust never in a lifetime surrenders its 
aggressivtness, an • armistice with the 
Communi$ts would be more trustworthy 
than with passion's nag and tease. Day by 
day since !infancy, I have dreaded it; now, 
as I grow old, I fear losing it. From my own 
experience, I know quite a lot about sex, 
but I don't want t,o make sex my living; I 
don't even want to talk about it. 
Lately, to my surprise, some students 
have been complaining: "The priests on 
this campus nev~r talk about sex. We 
need someone to tell us whether sex is 
right or wrong. 'we hear sermons on social 
justice ·or on sacraments; how come we 
never hear sermons on sex?" The question 
astonishes me.r Does someone young really 
want to hear \fhat an old fossil like me is 
thinking about the confusions caused by 
concupiscence? "Talk to the young 
priests:" I am tempted to say. "Ask your 
teachers who are married. Go home and 
learn ftom your parents.'' 
"What good is it being the University 
Chaplain," the objection comes back, "if 
you can't talk about the fundamental 
questions?'' 
Reluctantly, then, knowing that the 
University Chaplain, seen as a sexual 
counsellor, is a broken reed for folks to lean 
on; knowing, too, that all my life I have 
been a sexual creature, rubbing shoulders 
(what else?) with other sexual creatures, 
exploring philosophically the life crises 
induced by sexual creatureliness, I venture 
opinions proceeding from my amateur 
status, and from the vision I have believed 
of the Christian truth of things. 
First of ati, it seems to me that the ground rules of sexual intimacy need to be established a long time before the player is invited to join the game. A young man (or woman) needs to know the proprieties by which the sexual life should be lived long before he begins drinking vodka under a Southern moon with the blonde of his choice on the white sandy beaches of Ft. Lauderdale. The senses surrender so quickly to the lure of awakened appetites; the whole motion and movement of bodies seems so natural that enraptured lad or lassie can only murmur lazily, "Why resist?" Scripture says that it was only after Adam and Eve had eaten the forbidden apple that they were ashamed of their nakedness. For anyone of us, in sex as with other things, sadness races after our rapture. like a street beggar who won't be refused. The point is: you do not walk to the brink of an experience. and then expect--as the wind starts to topple you into the canyon--that the rope of God's grace or the safety net of common sense is going to keep you from falling. You can anticipate your regret...or you can reflect later on the decency you have betrayed: but sex, taken In medias res, has a logic all of its own; but it is a fool's logic, fuU of mischief leading you to gloom. 
The absolute ground rule of sexual conduct is a dreary, old fashioned prohibit­ion: "Unmarried people should not have sex; sexual intercourse is forbidden outside of marriage.' • What, never? No, never. What, never? Well ... hardly ever. If there are hardly evers, I don't know when they'd 
come. Of all rules of sexual conduct, Thou shall not is the hardest, and from my experience, it is the wisest. I've heard the arguments against it. • • A person could go crazy," the young man says, "if he doesn't have sex once in a while." 
"Nonsense," I reply. "A young man can go crazy from insisting on having sex; but after a cold shower, it is seldom found that he is certifiably insane." 
Some of the arguments a young person can use for having sex outside of marriage are pretty believa ble. There are even better reasons, I think, for his not having sex; because sex without commitment, or sex when you are f.lnwilling to suffer its consequences, or sex played as an indis­criminate game, can scar like acne of the soul. 
Finally, I want to say: pepm have their own ground rules of behaviour; but pagans never ask me what I believe. If a pagan ever did ask me, I would give him the same advice that I'd give to aChristian. Yet 
there are truths about himself that a pagan 
might never believe: that he is God's child:, 
for example, or that he has been redeemed' 
by the death of the Lord; that he lives now ­
not he, but Christ liveth in him. Christians believe that they live now not they, but Christ liveth in them. Christians, so believing, base their ground rules upon laws that reflect the truth of heaven. 
Blessed are the pure of heart, for they 
shall see God, Jesus taught us. Blessed is 
the young man and young woman who can keep purity in their hearts and bodies as an ideal blessed by the Lord. Blessed are the husband and wife who can keep pure within marriage so that the uses of their sexuality make their love fruitful with graces. 
The Christian faith is not all comforts and blessings; there are commitments we must make to virtue, even when virtue weighs on us like a cross to which our flesh is nailed. 
If through weakness, Christians take holidays from the, cross, they don't d~ive themselves into believing that the cross is a burden ·God never intended for them to bear. 
I will never write books about sex. awill never teach classes on sex. Yet sexuality keeps me company like an old lover's ghost. I can't make its obligations easier for you than I can make them for myself. That is why I would never, on my 'own initiative, begin a discussion on sex. 
VISIT TO A TOWN DIVIDED 
(Editors Note: There will be a meeting tonite at 7 pm for anyone interested in going to Tupelo, Miss. this weekend. It will be in the LaFortune Ballroom, 2nd floor) 
In Tupelo! Mississippi, the midday heat soars near 100 degrees even in September. The old courthouse square has a monu­ment of a rebel soldier with his bayonet fixed. Carved in stone are the inititals C.S.A.-Confederate States of America. 
Two blocks from the antebellum pillared courthouse, there's a new shopping center. 
The parking lot flanks J.C. Penneys, Walgreens and restaurants. It looks like a scaled-down Brookfield Square. Out past Elvis Presley's birthplace, Tupelo's only tourist attraction, is a Super America gas station flying the biggest American flag any of us had ever seen. 
This was the downtown we passed though the day before Labor Day. Our directions were confused and it took us a while to find the office of the North Mississippi Rural Legal Services. There we joined up with representatives of the United League and with support groups from Chicago, Ohio, Philadelphia and New York. Forty of us from Milwaudee had come down in a CB convoy to join the Labor Day march for freedom and justice in Mississippi. 
Tupelo is a town divided. On January 8, a federal judge found two Tupelo police guilty of beating a confession out of jail inmate Eugene Pasto. The black prisoner was awarded $2,500, but the two brutal cops, Dale Cruber and Roy Sandefer, were allowed to stay on the force. Resentment ran dddp in Tupelo's black community. 
The anger was intensified when the news broke four days later that James Garrett, another black-prisoner, was found hanged in the Holly Springs jail, sixty miles up the · road toward Memphis, Garrett's hands and feet were bound. 
Holly Springs, in predominantly black Marshall County, is the home of the United League of North Mississippi, a 12-year­old militant civil rights organization. The United League called a boycott of the white-owned businesses in Tupelo, linking the two police terror incidents to the overall oppression of blacks in this rapidly industrializing part of Mississippi. 
Among blacks, the boycott was 90 percent effective. They said, "Why shop where you can't work?" Their demands included the firing of Cruber and Sandefer and affirmative action hiring in business, government and industry. The cops were eventually transferred to the fire depart­ment and finally forced to resign. 
But the boycott continued. The dismis­sal of the two cops had gived Tupelo's blacks a sense of pride and power. They organized car pools to shop at outlying black-owned stores. The appearance of even a couple of pickets on the town square or in the J .C. Penney parking lot was enough to keep traffic moving right on by. Store managers charged harassment of their customers and cops began to arrest pickets. 
As the weeks wore on, the United League rejected any token changes and held firm for a major turnaround in the whole network of discrimination. League organizer Skip Robinson quickly became a household name. His car became a target for Klan-type vigilantes on country roads. Government officials and downtown mer­chants tried to figure out how to buy him off. He even antagonized a whole layer of established black leaders who were push­ing for the people to be satisfied with minor concessions. He articulated the people's longing for change and for freedom. 
Throughout the spring and summer, weekly marches rallied blacks in the rural county seats of Holly Sptings, Ololona, Corinth and Lexington, as well as Tupelo. The influence of the League was spreading with the speed and tenacity of the southern 
byBWDrew vines that cover everything along the Northern Mississippi roads. Robinson claims 50,000 one-dollar-a-year dues pay­ing members of the League in Mississippi and Tennessee. By May the Ku Klux Klan had entered the picture. At a press conference in a darkened motel room, Tupelo Grand Titan Gary Wilson announced that the Klan would hold a national rally in Tupelo on June 10. He and three other Kluxers wore masks, robes and hoods. One open Klan rally at die Ramada Inn featured live country music and white power speeches, followed by an outdoor cross burning. The speeches were spiced with comments like 
•'the brain of a black man is the size of a hummingbird's." 
The United League responded by calling for their own rally at the same time and place as the Klan. Some town officials, anzious that a confrontation would hurt Tupelo's repurtation, unsuccessfully tried to forestall both marches. Tupelo Major Clyde Wittaker held talks in the city hall ' with three masked and robed Klansmen. Imperial Wizard Bill Wilkenson of Denham Springs, Louisiana, wnet ahead and reser­ved all the available moted space for his "hordes" on the June 10 weekend. 
The day of the march only 40 white­sheeted racists paraded through town. A hundred or so supporters followed the march or watched from the sidewalk. They arrived on the town square a half hour after 1,000 black marchers had concluded a massive show of unity. The United League march had been led by a pick-up with rifles prominently displayed on the gun rack. Men, women and children had come out knowing there could be trouble. The momentum of the struggle was continuing to grow. 
This was the atmosphere wer were coming into. Some of us felt kind of like anything south of Memphis was enemy t~tory. . 
But Mississippi turned out to be some­thing else. 
Oint Standifer, a retired civil service worker, was manning the Legal Services office when we arrived. The man is as wiry as he is determined. And in his own way as miliant as the teenagers who walk near the front of the League's weekly marches. Standifer shook everybody's hand and let us look through scrapbooks full of clippings about the events of the past months. As vans and cars pulled up 'from different states, Clint hustled to make everybody comfortable. 
About a hundred and fitly people arrived from African Liberation Support Commit­tees, revolutionary student groups, a van full of Latinos from Chicago, a welfare coalition from New York, Milwaukee's United Workers, and others. We all drove over to a furniture factory owned by a black man who is in the ought to have. We-want to be free." 
Through the night, a United League 

security team guarded the furniture factory 
and we got some rest. All of us had been 
on the road for at least.t2 hours and then 
up all day. 
The next morning we found out .that a 

night time caller had slipped through the 
guards and left a business card on the 
windshield of one of the vans. The card 
said, "You have been patronized by the 
Invisible Empire Knights of the Ku Klux 
Klan." 
That Labor Day morning some of us 

wanted to get some photos of different part 
parts of Tupelo. Clint Standifer offered to 
show us around. One of the stores near our 
"headquarters" had a sign that said 
"Most of my help is black .. Why me 
Lord?'' Clint remarded that the owner was 
a staunch Klansman and that he had two 
different rates, cash and credit. • 'Credit is 
25 cents more on the dollar. Before the 
boycott a lot of black folks from up the hill 
used to shop here. He'd have their welfare 
and social security checks sent straight to 
him." 
We drove past a rusty complex of tanks, 

pipes and buildings. Clint said, "That's 
the oil mill. That was mostly blacks 
working there. They made cotton seed 
oil.'' About a block further was another old 
abandoned building. "That's the old 
thread factory. That was mostly white." 
As we entered a neighborhood of small 

cottages, Oint said, "This used to be 
called factory town." It was a white 
working class neighborhood. Here, the 
houses were nowhere near as weather­
beaten as the housing up on the ridge 
where the blacks live, but it was humble 
nonetheless. 
Then we came to the industrial park where new factories were springing up one after the other. Rockwell, the multinational tool conglomerate, had a sprawling one­story plant. Pennsylvania Tire and Rubber had just made arrangements to ship the last 500 jobs out of Mansfield,Ohio, down to Tupelo. Tey were all sitting on land that is tax free for five years. 
Clint said, ''A lot of us used to go north for work. I got ran out of here when I was 11 years old. But who wants to leave their homes and then stand in the unemploy. ment lines in Detroit or Chicago? Everything is growing down here. But young people face a future of working in non-union factories where all the foremen are white and the good jobs go to whites. Look at downtown. You won't see many black bank tellers or store clerks. That's one re&$Qn we are fighting so hard.'' 
By the time we got back, the rest of the contingent was picketing downtown in a special boycott activity called by the League. As the marchers paraded in front of Black's Department Store, a crew of cops tried to look like they were "just relaxing" in front of the People's Bank and 
League. The floor space was our headquarters and dormitory. The foam rubber everywhere and our own sleeping bags became our beds. Reverend Jenkins, one of the United League's ministers, and Walter Standfield, president of the Tupelo chaper of the League, came out to welcome us. Standfield said he didn't have words to express how glad he was. Those were words enough. 
From there we went to a community hall for a presentation on the history and goals of the United League. What was originally planned as an informal teach-in grew into a community rally. Two chruches cancelled evening services so members could attend the event. 
Skip Robinson inspired the crowded gynmasium. He pointed out that the goals of the struggle are for total equality: 
•'This is not the civil rights movement. This in not 1958. This is 1978 and I don't want people tellinll us what rights we 
·Trust across the street. After closing three or four stores to the beat of some updated freedom songs, we were joining together to head up toward the starting point of the big march. 
But a couple blocks away, groups of Klansmen were gathering under a Confed­erate flag in a city parking lot. When we detoured to go past the raggedy band of racists, tempers flared. The Klansmen hussied to don their sheets in a ridiculous attmept to scare somebody. Some stood difiantly with T-shirts saying "I am a secret member of the Ku Klux Klan." (Lately this klan faction, the Invisible Empire, has been trying to show that they are not afraid to reveal their identities. The week before the march five Klansmen pulled a publicity stunt before TV cameras at a Klan rally. They publicly unmasked. Four turned out to be local deputies. The 
other had been 20ing under the game of

A new kind of football record was made this year when a little blue 
· nun took on the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame and the Crimson Tide of Alabama. 
The record--a musical one--fea­tures two songs, "The Little Blue Nun," and "The Little Blue Nun Replies.'' Both songs are based on the football rivalry between the two colleges, a rivalry that was height­ened when national polls ranked Notre Dame the number one team in the nation last year, over Alabama. 
Currently on sale, the record is being used as a fund raising vehicle for the St. Joseph County Big Brother/Big Sister agency, which includes many Notre Dame and St. Mary's student volunteers. The record is the culmination of months of work by two local businessmen, Jon Cook and Ed Martin, and Notre Dame Professor James Daschbach of the College of Engineering. 
The story behind the record is amusing. After Notre Dame's victory in the 1978 Cotton Bowl and their selection as national champs, some disappointed Alabama roo­ters produced a witty sour grapes record called "The Little Blue Nun." The music is country-wes­tern style and the guitar man is Joe 
Edwards of the staff of the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. Two local radio station personali­ties, Jon Thompson and BobLux of

Hesourgn aonates papers 

by Ruth Kolcun 
Fr. Theodore Hesburgh last 
Wednesday officially donated his 
presidential papers from 1952-1975 
to the University of Notre Dame 
Archives. The confidential Res­
burgh papers fill 100 sealed file 
drawers, according to the Archive 
officials. 
The Hesburgh collection consists 
of 300 linear feet of paper and over 
300,000 items. A small portion of 
Hesburgh's collection occupies as 
much space as the total collections 
of all the 14 other past presidents 
combined, officials at the archives 
said. 
At present, there can be only 
speculation as to the actual con­
tents of the collection, and accord­
ing to the newly appointed ar­
chivist, Wendy Schlereth, "It is the 
general policy of the archives that 
presidential papers are restricted 
for a SO-year period. The collection 
is open to researchers only with 
special permission di~ectly from 
the president's office. . 
Schlereth, who replaced Fr. Tho­
mas Blantz, as archivist in Septem­
ber after Blatnz accepted a teach­
ing position with the University, 
says,"The papers are kept con­
fidential in order to protect againsi. 
violating an individual's right to 
privacy and to protect living indi­
viduals who might be injured if 
certain information is released.'' 
There is a strong possibility that

[continued from page 9] Grand Titan Gary Wilson. He turned out to be Bill Howard, a local furniture store owner.) Later, as 800 marchers stood in the street ready to begin walking, a message crackled over one of the security team walkie talkies, "Klan headed this say.'' There they were. About 50 Klansmen, some with masks down, some with them up, were walking slowly up the hill toward the crowd. As they got closer, it became obvious that they were all carrying weapons under their sheets .. No cops were in sight (except for those under the sheets.) The United League marchers refused to move. The Klamsmen had to walk single file past the jeering and stares of the 800 marchers. These armed thugs were trying to provoke the people. Their grandstanding confrontation seemed intended for television cameras and publicity. But the size, determination and the black-­white unity of the United League demonstration were clearly more impressive. After that tense moment, every­thing else was anti-climactic. The march wound its way towards the deserted downtown square, past the boycott targets and onto the courthouse lawn. Speeches ce­mented the unity of the crowd. Sister Gray sang out the gospel straing of soulful stuggle to the delight of the people. Helen Rob­ertson of Milwaukee's African Lib­eration Support Committee ex­pressed unity ''from Milwaukee to Mississippy" and drew some links between unemployment here and discrimination there. Dr. Howard Gunn, an educator who is one of the leaders of the League, explain­ed that he had been shot at 16 times by Klansmen in nearby Okolona. He defiantly challenged them to try it again. The day ended with a picnic, chicken, com bread, ribs and salads all donated by the women of the community. None of us could get over the welcome we had received. As we headed back through the night toward Milwaukee, we knew we had seen the makings of a powerful movement that will some­day shake things up even more than the turbulent t60s. Reprint with the permission of BW Drew & Cltyside Newspaper. 
confidential papers might contain information concerning the changes in student regulations and the University's process of switch­ing to co-education, in the early 70s. It is also probably that the papers also reflect the tension of the 60s on campus concerning such issues as the Vietnam War, and the protests associated with its rights struggle. 
Schelreth reported that Res­burgh was concerned with the safety of the papers. To guard against possible destruction in the Administration building, the papers were transferred to the archives, which is on the 6h floor of the Memorial Library. 
Helen Hosinski, Hesburgh's per­sonal secretary for 26 years, says, ''Hesburgh will also donate all of 

1his 64 honorary degrees and aca­demic hoods to the university archives." 
The president of the University has received honorary degrees from numerous institutions ranging from Alma College to Yale Univer· 
. sity. : Hesburgh, who served on the 
U.S. Commission on Civil Rights during the Kennedy Administra­tion, has also donated some of his papers to the civil rights center of the Notre Dame Law School.
