Blue-Gold brings football vveekend in spring 

ND fans will kick off season at scrimmage 
By KATIE PERRY Assistant News Editor 
Forecasters might predict clear skies and sunshine Saturday, but the Irish football team has plans all its own to shake down the thunder at its annual Blue-Gold game -a 77-year tradition that primes players and fans alike for the upcoming season. 
BlueandGold.com editor Lou Somogyi said there will "absolutely" be fervor among Notre Dame fans on campus this weekend given the success of last season as well as the high expectations for the fall schedule. The Irish will likely be a consensus preseason top five pick and ESPN's Kirk Herbstreit already favors them for the national title, he said.

County smoking ban will affect stadium 
By MAUREEN MULLEN 
News Writer 
Notre Dame fans may breathe a little easier at Saturday's Blue-Gold game ­and not just because the Irish are guaranteed a win. 
On April 10, a hotly debat­ed St. Joseph County smoking ban went in effect in public places -restaurants, stores, malls, public places, private businesses and sports arenas -throughout the county. Notre Dame stadium will not be exempt from the ordi­nance, Assistant Athletics Director for Facilities Mike Danch said. 
The Blue-Gold game will be the first time that the Notre Dame stadium will hold a crowd under the new "no smoking" regulations. Danch

The Notre Dame communi­ty and Irish football fans around the country will see The Shirt for the 2006 foot­ball season when it is revealed today at the Hammes Bookstore -and decide whether it will usher in a new collection of knock­offs or once more unify the student section under one shirt.

Weinberg speaks on rock gigs, tours 
Drummer speaks about experiences with Bruce Springsteen, Conan O'Brien show 
By PETER NINNEMAN News Writer 
Max Weinberg was the star on stage Thursday at 8 p.m. in Debartolo Hall for a lecture on his experiences as drummer with Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band and the Max Weinberg 7 on Late Night with Conan O'Brien. 
Weinberg brought motivated his audience while evoking laughs in the process. The night started out with a short film of comedy skits from the Conan O'Brien show, including one with Weinberg reading a poem about murdering his neighbor and put­ting him through a wood chipper. 
Weinberg also had some more serious words and spoke about the pursuit of dreams. 
"Some people, and you bump into these kinds of people some­times, call dreams a waste of time/' Weinberg said. "Well, for­get about those people." 

Weinberg recalled the moment in his life he knew he wanted to play drums. It was 1956 and he was a five-year-old waiting for Elvis' debut on the Ed Sullivan Show with his teenage sisters. When Elvis' band started to play "Hound dog," Weinberg found himself playing along with the drums on the carpet, much to his sisters' dismay. 
"It was absolutely amazing to me, and still is today, how Elvis and his band took over our living room," he said. ''I've never been the same since." 
Weinberg went on to play every gig he could get, including strip

Fox estimates about 15 to 20 designs were submitted for The Shirt. From the beginning, a design created by junior Ryan Ricketts was the clear frontrunner. 
"Ryan's really stood out," Fox said. "It really impressed me a lot." 
The Shirt committee decid­ed as a group on the yet-unannounced color of this year's shirt. Notre Dame stu­dents greeted last year's yel­low color with a largely neg­ative reaction, inspiring a string of knock-offs with dif­ferent colors or alternate wording and design.

Student teachers 
My roommate this year is an edu­cation major, so was one of my roommatns last ynar, and many of my other l'rinnds are as well. 
This being said. I have witnessed a lot of' home­work assign­Laura Baumgartner numts and projncts ow1r the

whieh they have had to complete a lot of really pointless assignments and projects. I have never seen any­one have to do as much busy work as education majors, and while the work may not be the most challeng­ing tasks at all times, they take an extreme amount of time to complete. 
For example, education majors are frequently required to create what are referred to as "units," basically eonsisting of a month's worth of les­son plans. Now. this might sound like a quic~k and simpln undertaking; howcwnr. it gets morel complicated wlwn you take into account that not only do they havc1 to dnsign these lnssons they actually have to physi­cally crclate tlwm. This translates into one month's worth of work­sheds. games. evaluations, explana­tions, etc. 
What rPally gnts me though is that my currnnt roommate can make a nwan gamn to teach childrnn phon­ies and word blnnds, but when it comes to nvaluating a studcmt's writ­ing she has no idna where to begin becausP this is a topie newer covered in lwr coursework. 
Personally, I'd rather know that thn people who will bn tem~hing my childrnn in tlw futuro have a firm grasp on thn English language and are well educated in the various sub­joel standards students should be achieving at different stages of edu­cation rather than knowing that they've spent $100,000 to spend four years learning how to cut up pieces of construction paper. 
Of course, we must remember that the education majors are only doing what is asked of them by their pro­fessors, and they are doing it well. Creativity is certainly being fostered, however, maybe a bit too much. But then, I'm not an education major or a professor so how would I know. 
What I do know is that these stu­dents put a lot of hard work and dedication into their work and receive quite a bit of ridicule from thP.ir peers because they aren't in a "real major." 
However, there could not be any­thing more real about a major which requires you to take on the work of a professional for two years before you can meet graduation requirements. I tutored children in reading and math in the past, and I was only in charge of anywhere from one to four children, but 1 had a difficult time controlling them and keeping them on task. Education majors on the other hand are usually in charge of thirty children or teenagers depend­ing on what grade they are assigned to for student teaching. I can only imagine the challenges they have to face in such circumstances. 
So, I would like to salute you, the education majors who spend count­less hours at "The Learning Tree" coping, cutting, pasting and laminat­ing, and more hours hunched at computer screens typing fifty plus page case studies and lesson plans, all so you can deal with tempera­mental children, critical parents, and a tiny paycheck as thanks in the future.

Students slip on dance shoes to benefit cause 
All-night marathon to raise funds for Riley Hospital for Children 
By MEGAN O'NEIL Senior News Writer 
Studonts will don comfort­able shoes and kick up· their heels in Saint Mary's Angela Athletic Facility tonight in ordor to raise money for Hiley Hospital for Children in the College's first dance marathon. 
Organizers said 190 Saint Mary's, lloly Cross and Notre Dame students have already registered to participate in the marathon, which begins at 6 
p.m. tonight and runs until 6 
a.m. tomorrow. The 55 mem­bers of the dance marathon committee will also take to the floor. 
"Everyone loves children and everyone hates to see children in pain ... so I think to do something for a hospital that never turns away families, that never turns away kids ... is a really great cause," freshman class president and marathon co-chair Francesca Johnson said. 
Founded in 1991 in memory of AIDS victim Ryan White, the Hiley Hospital dance marathon takes place at universities, col­leges and high school through­out Indiana and raises hun­dreds of thousands of dollars annually for Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis. The only comprehensive children's hospital in the state, Riley hopes to build a neonatal unit in the near future. 
It was Johnson who first introduced the idea of staging the fundraiser at Saint Mary's. 
After hearing about the Riley dance marathon through her brother, a student at Indiana University at Bloomington, Johnson hoped to get the event started at her high school. But as an outgoing senior, she ran out of time. 
Instead, Johnson made the dance marathon the central component of her campaign platform when she ran fresh­man class president at Saint Mary's last fall. Immediately after she and vice presidential candidate Pauline Kistka won the election, they began plan­ning. 
The freshman class officers teamed up with Residence Hall Association (RHA) service chair Amy Dardinger to wade through the details of the dance marathon, including fundraising and insurance issues. 
"[Initially] we were very nervous because here we are, freshman who know none of the red tape ... that was why it was such a comfort to be work­ing with Amy," Kistka said. 
The three women then had to sell the idea to Saint Mary's student government and to the wider student body. 
"I think when we first went into [Board of Governance] and ask for $5,000 dollars [the stu­dent government officers were] like 'We are going to give this to freshman? Are they organ­ized enough? Are they respon­sible enough?'" Johnson said. 
The marathon is about much more than just dancing, Dardinger said, and it was dif­ficult to describe to every curi­ous student a night of games, food and personal interaction. 
By October, Johnson, Kistka and Dardinger had assembled a committee of 55 dedicated students who were divided into seven different subcommittees including entertainment, pub­licity, alumni relationships and morale. 
A string of fundraisers to help finance the dance marathon followed, including a freshman dance, sweatshirt sale and chapstick sale. At a campus Mass in February the collection was designated for the event and campus ministry then matched the amount with its own donation. They also received donations from RHA, Student Activities Board (SAB) and the senior class board. Johnson herself stood outside a Walgreens asking patrons for money as they entered the store and raised $500. 
Members of the committee went to see marathons at Butler and Purdue to gather ideas and absorb inspiration. 
"Every. time we went we came back with a new idea," Kistka said. "It just put more ambition in our blood." 
A group also traveled to Riley Hospital in Indianapolis to tour the facility and see where the money raised would be going. 
Working with hospital liaison Katherine Cain the committee tailored the dance marathon to best fit the Saint Mary's com­munity. Each hour of the evening will have a different theme and a different activity, Johnson said. Music, choreo­graphed dancing and inflatable games will keep participants energized, she said. They will also have the chance to· meet with children and families that have personally benefited from Riley Hospital. 

Participants, who paid $10 to enter, are not allowed to sit down, Johnson said, and must remain on the premise the entire 12 hours. 
The committee, upon the rec­ommendation of Cain, did not set a goal amount for tonight's 12-hour fundraiser. Participants and committees members together sent 450 let­ters home requesting financial­ly support, Johnson said. 
But while Johnson would not give a specific dollar amount, she did say the College appears to be on track to break the record for the most money raised by any school at its first dance marathon. The total will be announced at the closing ceremony tomorrow morning. 
Johnson said the success of the last couple of months should be attributed to the enthusiasm and organization of the committee members. 
"I can't believe it's been this successful, it's amazing," Johnson said.

Associate VPchosen as interim 
Special to The Observer 
Don Pope-Davis, associate vice president for graduate studies and professor of psychology at the University of Notre Dame, has been appointed the University's interim vice president for gradu­ate studies and research, effective July 1, according to Provost Thomas G. Burish. 
A member of the Notre Dame faculty since 2000, Pope-Davis will replace Jeffrey Kantor, who is leaving the position at the comple­tion of his five-year term to return to full-time teaching and research. Kantor is a professor of chemical and biomolecular engi­neering. During his tenure, research awards to Notre Dame more than doubled, to over $80 million in fiscal year 2005. 
Reporting to the provost, the vice president for graduate stud­ies and research is responsible for helping to develop and support all graduate programs in the University, and for the administra­tion of all research, including externally sponsored programs, conducted by its faculty. 
"We are blessed to have Don Pope-Davis lead our graduate studies and research division," Burish said. "Don's creativity, vision and experience will allow us to build upon the positive momentum that has been estab­lished under Jeff's leadership."

Student fast aims to raise avvareness 
By LAUREN LAVELLE 
News Writer 
More than 50 Saint Mary's stu­dents participated in a 12-hour fast on Thursday·in effort to raise awareness about hunger in the local community. 
Saint Mary's juniors Chelsea Gulling, Etienne Melcher and Amanda Meyer organized the fast as part of the College's first annual Hunger and Homelessness Awareness Week. 
"Last fall, we attended the National Student Campaign Against Hunger and Homelessness Conference in Seattle and really wanted to bring the issue back to our campus," Meyer said. "We wanted to raise awareness about the hunger and homelessness problem here in South Bend." 
Fast participants wore white T­shirts with black lettering that read "Today I am Fasting For ... " on the front and cited several statistics about hunger and homelessness on the back. The fast began at 6 a.m. and ended at 6 p.m. During that time, participants were encouraged to consume only water. 
Melcher said participating in the fast was important for students because it allowed them to not only sympathize with the hungry, but to empathize with them as well. 
"Most people know it is a prob­lem but don't think they can do anything about it," Melcher said. "But we need to realize that we need to be socially conscious and try to understand the people who are affected by the problem." 
At 6 p.m., participants gathered in the West Wing of the Noble Family Dining Hall for dinner and an informal discussion about their experience with the fast. Meyer opened the discussion by empha­sizing how important it was for stu­dents to take action against issues such as hunger and homelessness. 
"It is important for people to real­ize how big the problem really is and that it isn't only a problem in other countries, but that it's right here in the local community" Meyer said. "I think by all of us wearing the shirts and fasting today, we helped make some peo­ple realize that." 
Jenny Robbins, a senior at Saint Mary's, participated in the fast because she said she thinks it is an invaluable experience when trying to address the issue of hunger. 
"I wanted to have the experience of wanting something to eat but not being able to have it because some people do this everyday, they don't have a choice," Robbins said. 
"It was incredibly worthwhile to tell people 'I'm hungry' when they asked how I was doing. Saying that puts a face to hunger and that is what raises awareness and makes students take action." 
Junior Kate Deitle said she par­ticipated because the fast forces students to pay attention the issues like hunger and homelessness. 
"We are in a bubble here on campus and it is easy to ignore the problem," Deitle said. "Participating in the fast makes people realize they can make a dif­ference. 
Many student<> said the most dif­ficult part of the fast was the effect their hunger had on their ability to focus and concentrate during the day. 
"It makes you think about all the people who have to go to work or the kids who have to go to school hungry and arc expected to do well and get good grades," Robbins said. 
During the discussion, Meleher addressed criticism that partici­pants have faced regarding the effect of their efforts. Some stu­dents said that wearing a T-shirt and fasting for a day does not help solve the overall problem, Melcher said. 
"Recognizing the problem is only the first step and it will set the stage for things to come," Melcher said. "We will not fill every stomach today but we will empower stu­dent<> to make bigger changes that will hopefully encourage students to get involved in the local commu­nity." 
Many participants said that while they knew they were not ending hunger, they were making small changes for the cause. 
"Even if we can't prevent people from starving, we can stop how much we eat and how much food we waste," freshman Francesca Johnson said. 
Meyer said she was pleased with the amount of students participat­ing in the fast and the awareness it brought to campus. 
"I know a lot of students stopped us today to ask about the shirts and it gave us a chance to explain what we were doing," Meyer said. "Our main goal was to act and to ignite the hope that we have the power to do something, and I think we did that today."

Earthquake hits Russian East region 
MOSCOW -A major earthquake hit a distant, sparsely populated region of Russia's Far East early Friday, causing unknown damage and possible casualties, an emergency official said. The U.S. Geological Survey and Japan's Meteorological Agency estimated the quake's magnitude at 7.7. 
The quake hit around 12:45 p.m. local time in Koryak region, nearly 4,350 miles east of Moscow and some 600 miles north of the largest city in the area, Petropavlovsk­Kamchatsky, said Oleg Kotosanov, a duty officer with the regional emergency situations ministry. 
Kotosanov told The Associated Press by tele­phone that there were reports of damage in some villages of the Pacific region, and that emergency officials were flying by helicopter to several locations. Federal emergency officials in Moscow said they had no information about the quake.

SMC lecture focuses on vvo111en, Church 
By LIZ HARTER News Writer 

Saint Mary's Center in Spirituality presented its 21st annual Madeleva Lecture for Spirituality Thursday night with guest lecturnr Susan Hoss, who spoke of the role of beauty and women in the Church and in the world.

church no women are viewed when one looks at the altar. The reason that women were not permitted to be in the same room as men during worship, and are now marginalized in the church is because women and their physieal beauty in the church are said to distract or seduce men from focusing on God, she said. 
"Women have nevertheless graced the presence of churches in ways that are trivialized," Ross said, citing that women are normally the ones who complete the "housework" of the church, cleaning stained glass windows and keeping pews free of dust 
and clutter.

sense of excitement for the sea­son," Somogyi said. "People are talking about the Charlie Weis era and then looking at the Lou Holtz and Ara Parseghian eras. It's that whole, 'Hey, we found our guy and he's going to lead us back to the Promised Land' feeling." 
Somogyi said the Blue-Gold game tradition began with Knute Rockne, but has not always followed the same for­mat. From the 1930s through much of the 1960s, the scrim­mage was known as the Old­timers game. 
"Former players would play the current players," he said. "You used to have situations with guys in the NFL competing against college kids. You'd have David Givens coming back to play in the game or Arnez Battle or Luke Petitgout ­that's how it used to be ... You couldn't even imagine agents allowing that in the profession­al ranks [today)." 
Somogyi said the event changed under the direction of coach Ara Parseghian, who thought it would be "more worthwhile" to hold an intra­squad scrimmage in the spring. "For the most part lthe games) were one sided, because you would have the No. 1 team going against the No. 3 team," he said. "You used to have scores like 48-0." 
For Somogyi, the 1975 Blue­Gold game was especially memorable. 
"It was a rainy day, and out of nowhere -no one knew who this guy was -[a quarter­back] completed seven of 12 passes and a couple touch­downs," he said. "That guy's name was Joe Montana." 
Montana was on the seventh team the previous year, but in that one scrimmage he "sky­rocketed up to No. 2," Somogyi said. 
"You don't always put too much [thought] into Blue-Gold games, [but] now and then something happens," he said. 
Somogyi does not expect any breakout performances of com­parable magnitude Saturday, but said the event should draw a "pretty decent crowd" at Notre Dame Stadium. 
"Charlie [Weis] only had about 17,000 in attendance last year, but even that was amaz­ing because it was probably the coldest Blue-Gold game in his­tory," he said. "Anytime you approach 20,000 -that's very good." 
Somogyi said Weis is "getting there" in terms of popularity, but first year coaches histori­cally draw the largest Blue-Gold crowds. · 
"The most attended Blue­Gold game happened to be in 1981 with first year coach Gerry Faust -35,675 people were in attendance," he said. "It was called 'Faust Fever' because of his magnetic per­sonality. He had everyone "I think we're playing this lit­believing Notre Dame would tle team called Penn State," he never lose another game." said. "We already have the

Notre Dame Security/Police associate director Phil Johnson said the unit, in tandem with other police agencies, will staff Notre Dame Stadium and patrol various parking areas to "pro­mote a family friendly environ­ment and to enforce laws." 
"We expect a good sized crowd for this weekend's Blue­Gold [game] -probably larger than some recent years," he said. "In addition to the Blue­Gold, there are several other events planned this weekend including a baseball game. So, there's likely to be very heavy traffic in and around campus." 
Johnson said the one-way traffic pattern typically imple­mented on regular home foot­ball games will not be utilized Saturday and thus "traffic may move a bit slower this week­end." Additionally, the closing of Douglas Road east of Juniper Road will also affect campus travel. 
"We'll have staff deployed at key intersections to facilitate traffic now before and after the game," Johnson said. "Fans should plan to allow extra time arriving to and departing from campus." 
Kickoff for the game is sched­uled for 1:35 p.m.

Feds get tough on employers 
Government cracks down on businesses hiring illegal immigrant workers 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -The government plans to crack down ever harder on employers who harbor and hire illegal immigrants, pursuing companies that ignore the law so they can exploit cheap labor. 
"We are going to move beyond the current level of activity to a higher level in each month and year to come," Homeland Security Secretary Michael ChertofT said Thursday. He pledged to "come down as hard as possible" on violators. 
Federal agents on Wednesday arrested seven current and former man­agers of IFCO Systems, a manufacturer of crates and pallets, on criminal charges, and more than 1,1 00 people were arrested on administrative immigra­tion charges at more than 40 IFCO sites in the U.S. 
"Our nation's communi­ties cannot be a wild fron­tier where illegal aliens and unscrupulous employees subvert our nation's laws," said Julie Myers, assistant secretary for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

For Krupa, a eity hall beat reporter who served as editor­in-chief of The Observer during the 1999-2000 academic year, the award is "bittersweet." 
"We're thrilled to have been recognized for our work, but at the same time, there were reporters in our newsroom whose houses still are destroyed who are living in trailers or living with relatives," Krupa said Wednesday. "Our newsroom, our building, is sort of an island.... 
"It's the proudest moment in American journalism and so many of our staff will go home to a FEMA trailer." 
Krupa and the Times­Picayune staff, who saw Katrina from a different perspective than reporters covering the 
story from around the nation, pro­vided a cru­cial window into the unfolding disaster. 
"At the very begin­ning a lot of big papers were telling these intel­lectual sto­ries about the role that race might have played in

the evacuation ... our job was to tell people from New Orleans what was happening inside New Orleans," Krupa said. "For a month our main task was to tell people, what does it look like inside the city?" 
Krupa, who majored in Arnerican Studies and Spanish, said she chose Notre Dame pre­cisely because it did not have a journalism program at the time. 
"I felt like to be a good jour­nalist you should study lots of other things," she said. 
But she joined The Observer almost immediately after arriv­ing at school -the Sunday night before classes began freshman year. Her first night shift as assistant news editor lasted until 8 a.m. the next morning. 
"I thought I was going to have a heart attack from all the cof­fee I had drank," Krupa said.

In the years since Krupa's stand, The Observer continued to operate as an independent newspaper without outside edi­torial influence.

She continued her journalism education, spending one year in a University of'Maryland gradu­ate program before joining the staff of the Times-Picayune, where she has now worked for four years. 
While the Pulitzers signify a concrete achievement for the Times-Picayune, in Krupa's eyes, the Katrina story is far from finished. 
"I don't know if there's been a single story I've written since Aug. 29 that hasn't had the word 'Katrina' in it," Krupa said. "We're going to be writing this story for 20 years." 
The other two recent Notre Dame Pulitzer winners are also former Observer staffers. 1995 graduate and Saint Paul Pioneer Press reporter George Dorhmann won the 2000 beat reporting award for a series on academic fraud within the University of Minnesota's men's basketball program, and 1994 graduate David Kinney was a member of the Newark Star­Ledger's Pulitzer-winning staff in 2005.

U p o n receiving their tick­ets, season ticket holders also received a booklet explaining stadium and University game day poli­cies. Included in the booklet will be an explanation of the now-effective smoking ban, Danch said. 
Any confusion concerning the ban may arise because Notre Dame has existing smoking regulations in the stadium that have been enforced. The original regu­lations barred smoking in the inner seating area of the stadium. 
"Notre Dame previously forbid smoking in the seat­ing areas of the stadium and permitted it in the outer and upper concourse," said Cappy Gagnon, coordinator of stadium personnel. "It will now be forbidden everywhere inside the stadi­

ities con­
cerning the 
ban remain with usher enforcement. 
"In the beginning it will be a bit of an educational pro­gram since smoking has been permitted in the past," Gagnon said. "Ushers who spot persons smoking will advise them of the ban and point out the signage on it. We will warn persons who do not follow instructions and treat them like any per­son who violates a stadium rule." 
Concerning spectator response, Gagnon said that the expectation is that most people will comply when first informed of the ban. 
"Like we must do for cases of alcohol, ushers will esca­late their response if people refuse," Gagnon said.

Cab records support Duke player 
Associated Press 
DURHAM, N.C. -A cab driv­er who picked up a Duke University lacrosse player the night he's accused of raping a stripper appears to reinforce a timeline the defense says sup­ports his innocence, but also casts doubt on claims that nothing happened at a team party. 
When he returned to the off­campus party to pick up a sec­ond fare after dropping off Reade Seligmann, Moez Mostafa said he saw a woman leaving the party in anger, and overheard someone say, "She just a stripper. She's going to call the police." 
Seligmann, of Essex Fells, N.J., and fellow sophomore lacrosse player Collin Finnerty, of Garden City, N.Y., are charged with first-degree rape, sexual assault and kidnapping. The accuser, a 27 -year-old black student from a nearby college, told police she was attacked by three white men at a house where she and another woman were hired to dance at a March 13 lacrosse team party._ 
District Attorney Mike Nifong, who has not granted interviews about the case for weeks, has said he also hopes to charge a third suspect in the crime. According to defense attorneys, DNA tests of the team's players failed to connect any of them to the alleged rape. 
The accuser, who told police she arrived around 11:30 p.m., 
said she and another dancer performed for a short time before getting angry and leav­ing the party, returning a short time later after receiving an apology. The accuser told police she was separated from the other dancer and assaulted for 30 minutes once back inside. 
A member of the defense team, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the defense is working with players who could still be indicted, said time-stamped photos show the women dancing around mid­night. 
Mostafa's logs show a call for a cab at 12:14 a.m. A person close to the case told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity that cell pho.ne records show Seligmann called for a taxi at that time. 
The defense argues that if the dancers were performing around midnight, Seligmann would not have had enough time to have participated in the assault. 
Mostafa, 37, told the AP on Thursday he had spoken with Seligmann's father, but no one from the police department or. Nifong's office had contacted him. 
Mostafa said Seligmann appeared to be calm and jovial during the cab ride. After drop­ping off Seligmann, he said, he returned to the house to pick up another fare. When he arrived, it looked like a party was breaking up, with people crowded on both sides of the street. 
While waiting on the four passengers whom he would later drive to a nearby gas sta­tion, the Sudan-born driver saw a woman walking through a crowd of men toward a car, and heard someone say, "She just a stripper. She's going to call the police." 
Mostafa said the woman, wearing jeans and a sweater, appeared to exchange words with some people in the crowd before getting into the driver's side of a car. 
"She looked, like, mad," he said. "In her face, the way she walked, the way she talked, she looked like mad." 
The Associated Press was shown four photos by a mem­ber of the defense team Wednesday, but none were the pictures that allegedly show the women dancing around mid­night. 
Three of the photos show the accuser smiling, dressed in a skimpy, revealing outfit, and looking through her purse. The fourth shows two young men helping a woman into a passen­ger seat of a car. 
The car in the photo was black, while Mostafa said the angry woman got into a white car. 
At 12:53 a.m., police received a 911 call from a woman com­plaining that she had been called racial slurs by white men gathered outside the home where the party took place. The defense has said it believes the second dancer at the party made that call. 
Weinberg

clubs and bar mitzvahs. 
"Playing behind those strip­pers and bumping them, rimshotting bad comedians, that was good preparation for what I'm doing now," Weinberg said. 
He caught a break in 197 4 as a student at Seton llall when he hit it oil' with Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band in an audi­tion that he found in want ad. 
"This was the best band I had ever sat in with. I wantnd that gig," he said. 
The band soared in popularity with the 1975 album "Born to Hun," the first actual album that Weinberg had ever played on. 
Weinberg said the ten-year whirlwind of touring that he did with the band fulfilled his "rock n' roll dreams." 
"I had the best seat in the house," he said. 
To show the crowd what it was like to play in packed seats, Weinberg showed a video of concert footage set to "Born in the U.S.A." 
"I had that Fu Manchu mus­tache," Weinberg said. "I offer that video as definitive proof that not everyone in the seven­ties looked like Ashton Kutcher." 
In October 1989, Weinberg's life and career took a new direction when he got a call from Springsteen saying that he had been working on a new record and was going down a new path, and thanked Weinberg for his fifteen years of dedication. 
"In retrospect... I probably shouldn't have been surprised it was over," Weinberg said. 
He decided to go back to Seton Hall to finish his commu­nications degree, which still required twenty-one more cred­its. To his surprise, they still had his account open, which he said probably meant that they knew he would be back when "the rock n' roll thing was over" and he got "his act together." They gave him credit for a book he had written, so only eighteen credits remained until he could receive his degn~e. 
"I figured that was certainly doable over two semesters," Weinberg said. "What are you laughing about?" 
He took the LSAT after rneeiv­ing his degree but elaimed he got an "unbelievably low score." Daydreaming out the window one day in a property law class, he said he saw "visions of free­dom," and proceeded to leave the classroom and withdraw from the college. 
"I became a statistic... I'm very proud to say I'm a law school dropout," Weinberg said. 
Weinberg then got a job at a mail order record store, and worked a variety of jobs there for three years, until he was called up to tour with the band "10,000 Maniacs." 
"I was becoming a drummer again," Weinberg said. 
A short while later, he audi­tioned for the Broadway show "Tommy." Twenty seconds into his audition, the conductor told him, "Alright, you can be the second alternate sub." 
'That was OK with me, sud­denly I'd gotten a job," Weinberg said. 
He was so excited that he called his wife to come visit him in New York City. On a walk after dinner, he came across Conan O'Brien. 
"You just never know," he said. "Even with my little kid dreams, I never thought I'd have my own band with my name on the bass drum, playing on the Late Show."

Threatening MySpace message tips offpolice 
Associated Press 
IUVEHTON, Kan. -Five teenage boys accused of plot­ting a shooting rampage at their high school on the anniversary of the Columbine massacre were arrested Thursday after a message authorities said warned of a gun attack appeared on the Web site MySpace.com. 
Sheriff's deputies found guns, ammunition, knives and eoded messages in the bed­room of one sus­pect, Sheriff he said. 
The message discussed the significance of April 20, which is Adolf Hitler's birth­day and the anniversary of the 1999 Columbine High School attack in Colorado, in which two students wearing trench coats killed 13 people and committed suicide, the sheriff said. 
"The message, it was brief, but it stated that there was going to be a shooting at the Riverton school and that peo­ple should wear bulletproof vests and flak ja~kets," Norman said.

Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -A new FBI analysis of evidence in a bun­gled Detroit terrorism trial undercuts the recent indict­ment of the former prosecutor in the case, creating fresh con­flict in a legal drama that has embarrassed the Bush admin­istration. 
The 13-page report by FBI Agent Paul George concludes that satellite photos of a Jordanian hospital closely match hand-drawn sketches found in 2001 inside the apart­ment of four Detroit men who the government claimed had surveyed the site as part of a terrorist plot. 
The new analysis conflicts indicted on charges they con­spired at the trial to withhold the pictures because they would have shown that the drawings were not surveillance sketches of the hospital. as Convertino and trial witnesses had portrayed. 
"The object of the conspiracy was to present false evidence at trial and to conceal inconsis­tent and potentially damaging evidence," the indictment alleges. 
In an earlier court filing, Justice went further, claiming the two sets of' photos they believed were taken in the case and don't know if' they exist. Aerial photos bnliew~d to have been taken by helicopter before the trial arc missing. but prose­cutors do have a second set of ground and helieopter photos of the Jordanian hospital they say were . e-mailed to Convertino before the trial.

Norman said that the poten­tial victims were popular stu­dents and that the suspects may have been bullied. 
"I think there was probably some bullying, name calling, late last year before a grand jury that eventually indicted the prosecutor for wrongdoing in the case, officials said. The agent's report was obtained by The Associated Press. 
Convictions of three of the four Detroit men -arrested shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks -were tossed out in 2004 after the Justice Department told the court its own prosecutors withheld pho­tos from defense lawyers that could have helped prove the defendants innocence.

"The pending prosecution is not about the guilt or inno­cence of the defendants" in the original terror case, Justice spokesman Bryan Sierra said. "This is about lies perpetrated by a federal prosecutor and a federal agent, as alleged in the indictment. It's about perjury and the integrity and fairness of the judicial system." 
Justice officials also acknowl­edge they don't possess one of lions of dollars, that the evi­dence in the original case proves the terrorist convictions originally rendered by the jury," attorney Bill Sullivan said 

The criminal charges against Convertino are based on the principle that prosecutors must turn over to defendants all evi­dence that could help them prove their innocence. 
Legal experts said the emer­gence of George's analysis could help Convertino's lawyer create reasonable doubt. Defense lawyers could argue· that if photos matched the sketches -instead of dis­proved them -Convertino would have had no motive to hide them and no obligation to turn them over, exports said.

Brazil's nuclear technology attracts less attention than Iran's 
Associated Press 
RESENDE -As Iran faces international pressure over developing the raw material for nuclear weapons, Brazil is quietly preparing to open its own uranium-enrichment cen­ter, capable of producing exactly the same fuel. 
Brazil -like Iran -has signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and Brazil's constitution bans the military use of nuclear energy. 
Also like Iran, Brazil has cloaked key aspects of its nuclear technology in secrecy while insisting the program is for peaceful purposes, claims nuclear weapons experts have debunked. 
While Brazil is more cooper­ative than Iran on internation­al inspections, some worry its new enrichment capability ­which eventually will create more fuel than is needed for its two nuclear plants -suggests that South America's biggest nation may be rethinking its commitment to nonprolifera­tion. 
"Brazil is following a path very similar to Iran, but Iran is getting all the attention," said Marshall Eakin, a Brazil expert at Vanderbilt University. "In effect, Brazil is benefiting from Iran's problems." 
While Iran leads a war of words against nuclear-armed Israel and has defied a U.N. Security Council request to stop all uranium enrichment, Brazil is peaceful and demo­cratic. It doesn't have border disputes, is not in an arms race, and strives for good rela­tions with all nations. Its last war ended in 1870. 
"Brazil doesn't cheat on the Nonproliferation Treaty and it does not exist in an area of high tension," said David Albright, a former U.N. inspec­tor who runs the Washington­based Institute for Science and International Security. 
The U.S. Embassy in the cap­ital, Brasilia, referred all ques­tions to the State Department in Washington, where spokesman Sean McCormack dismissed any parallel between Brazil's nuclear program and Iran's.

Brazil has the world's sixth­largest uranium reserves, but until the plant becomes opera­tional, it can't use the fuel for energy without shipping it to and from URENCO, the European enrichment consor­tium.

"Brazil is beginning to be perceived as a country appar­ently wanting to reevaluate its commitment to nonprolifera­tion, and this is a big part of the problem," said Jon Wolfsthal, deputy director for 
nonproliferation  at  the  
Carnegie  Endowment  for  
International  Peace  in  
Washington.  

The government-run Industrias Nucleares do Brasil

Brazilian Nuclear Energy Commission, told The Associated Press. "You need a whole new technology that we don't have." 
But former U.N. inspector Albright said he worked with Goncalves at the Brazilian Physics Society on a project to show that the Brazilian cen­trifuges could be used to pro­duce highly enriched uranium, even if that wasn't their intended use. 
"Centrifuges are very flexi­ble," he said. "Reconfiguring the cascades or recycling the enriched uranium multiple times can allow for the produc­tion of weapons-grade urani­um." 
NIGERIA 
Car bombed kills at least two people 
Dispute over oil revenue blamed for attack 
Associated Press 
PORT HARCOURT -Militants battling for a bigger cut of Nigeria's oil revenue exploded a car bomb inside a military base, ending weeks of relative calm with a blast that killed at least two people and sent a fireball into the night sky. 
The Movement for Emancipation of the Niger Delta claimed responsibility for the blast late Wednesday at a bar­racks in the southern oil center of Port Harcourt.

Wednesday's blast sent a fire­ball towering over Port Harcourt, a major population center and hub of Nigeria's oil industry. 
"We suddenly heard one heavy bang and saw fire shoot up and everybody fled," said Tekena Lawson, who lives near the bar­racks. 
Brig. Gen. Samuel Salihu, commander of the base, con­firmed that the explosion was a car bomb, saying it killed two people and critically injured six others. 
Soldiers cordoned off the mili­tary barracks on Thursday, with heavily armed troops behind sandbags at the main entrance preventing people from entering. The group claims to be fight­ing for the interests of the main­ly ethnic Ijaw inhabitants of the Niger Delta, a 40,000-square­

NEPAL 
Protest erupts in violence 
Thousands gather in streets, throw rocks 
Associated Press 
KATMANDU-Tens of thou­sands of Nepalis defied a cur­few to protest Thursday in the largest show of discontent with King Gyanendra since demon­strations against his royal dic­tatorship began more than two weeks ago. Security forces responded by fatally shooting three protesters. 
The nearly two dozen demonstrations, which brought as many as 100,000 people into the streets around the capital Katmandu, ranged from festive pro-democracy rallies to angry riots of young men who lit bonfires and hurled bricks at police. Some demanded the death of the king, whose government appears increasingly unable to control the country. 
By midday, soldiers were patrolling in armored vehicles, and at least one police post had been attacked, its win­dows smashed by bricks. 
Gyanendra came under more diplomatic pressure on Thursday to cede the power he seized 14 months ago from an interim government. 
Despite a curfew imposed to head off protests, an alli~nce of seven opposition parties that has organized 15 days of protests and a general strike managed to draw as many as 100,000 people into the streets, according to estimates by police, organizers and wit­nesses. 
While there have been bloodier days since the protests began, much of Nepal's life -political and economic -is centered in Katmandu, and Thursday's demonstrations dwarfed all earlier ones in the capital. 
Early in the day, residents in the city center -where a heavy police presence kept most protesters at bay -whis­tled and banged plates on their rooftops. Cell phone text mes­sages encouraged Katmandu's 
1.5 million residents to rally at the city's edge. 

Many of those protests turned violent as demonstra­tors parried with officers throughout the day, often toss­ing back tear gas canisters to cheers from supporters watch­ing from rooftops. 
The worst violence came on the city's western edge, where police trying to keep more than 10,000 protesters from reaching the ring road opened fire with tear gas, rubber bul­lets and finally live ammuni­tion. 
Witnesses said the shooting in Kalanki began when a sen­ior police officer drew his pis­tol and shot a protester in the head, an act followed by gun­fire from police and soldiers. 
The senior offices "aimed straight for the (protesters)," said Ankul Shresthra, a 28­year-old throwing bottles at police in Kalanki. Other witnesses

were killed in Kalanki, and that police took the bodies away. More than 40 people were in critical condition, most with head injuries. Thursday's shootings brought the death toll to 13 since the demonstra­tions began. 
Hundreds more were report­edly injured around the city, including 13 police officers whose clearly exhausted col­leagues were, by the end of the day, being forced against demonstrators by senior offi­cers swatting them with rattan poles. 
The office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights in Nepal condemned the conduct of security forces, say­ing it was "without justifica­tion and inexcusable." 
Elsewhere, security forces fired on violent demonstrators in the country's southwest, wounding at least 26 in the town of Gulariya, the Defense Ministry said. 
The strife around the capital lasted into the night. 
"We are fighti4 · in the republic of Nepali'~eclared one student protester, Zap Sapkota. "We will kill the king!" 
What comes afterward, most demonstrators seem unable to articulate -there's a hazy notion of democracy, but few have seen it at work. 
Nepal's Hindu royal dynasty was once revered as godlike, and the recent chants of "Hang the King" are a major depar­ture from past protests. like the 1990 uprising that led the king's older brother to intro­duce democracy. 
Gyanendra ended that experiment last year, saying he needed to crush the commu­nist insurgency.

"The way 

they've behaved in their own zones is frighten­ing," Adams said from London. "They've publicly said they've killed those who they believe to be political opponents of theirs. They don't allow free speech, they have involved child soldiers, they have a political policy that would not seem to allow pluracy. 
"Based on their record, if not their rhetoric, it's safe to say that if they come to power there would be a human rights disaster in Nepal." 
With the unrest exposing Gyanendra's unpopularity, India's special envoy met with the king Thursday. 
"I am very hopeful that very shortly some sort of announce­ment will be made by him which will help considerably defuse the situation," the envoy Karan Singh said after the meeting.

"Coyote" smuggling a lucrative business 
Promise ofcrackdowns has little effect thus far 
been blamed for abandoning some migrants to their deaths in the desert heat, the Mexican government has been hesitant to move against them, knowing the death toll would climb if people crossed on their own, Clark said. 
"Migrant traffickers have become a necessary evil," he said. 
Corruption also taints Mexico's efforts to stop human trafficking. Clark, who heads the Tijuana-based Binational Center for Human Rights, said his group interviewed 50 detained smugglers and found 39 of them were simply migrants who were handed over to authorities after the real smugglers paid off police. 
Human trafficking is not a priority for Mexican politicians more concerned with kidnap­pings, drug trafficking and murders, border experts say. Officials from five federal gov­ernment entities, including the presidency, did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this story over several days. 
Since taking office in December 2000, Fox has sought the passage of a migra­tion accord as the centerpiece of his administration. Bush also expressed enthusiasm for such a measure until his atten­tion turned to border security after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. 
At the summit last month in Cancun, Fox once again told Bush he would do more to prosecute smugglers. hoping to encourage Washington to legalize millions of migrants. Fox noted that his government already had strengthened enforcement on Mexico's southern border to stem the flow of U.S.-bound Central Americans. 
But he made clear that Mexicans would not be stoppe~ from heading to the border, because their right to travel within Mexico is constitutional­ly guaranteed. "We can't infringe upon the right of peo­ple to move freely within our 
_territory," Fox said. 
Critics say Mexico is using that argument as an excuse to turn a blind eye.

Associated Press 
MEXICO CITY -Sidling up to migrants who arrive at the Tijuana airport and cruising the streets in border towns, "coyotes" in gold chains and dark sunglasses openly find customers for nightly scram­bles across the U.S. border. 
Mexico's president offered to crack down on smuggling at a recent summit with President Bush. But close to 100 smug­gling gangs are still operating, government officials say, in plain sight of Mexican law enforcement. 
"While drug smugglers are invisible for the most part, people smugglers are visible, working right in front of authorities," said Tijuana bor­der expert Victor Clark, who has studied the illegal trade for decades. 
Smuggling people into the United States from around the world has become a $10 bil­lion-a-year industry, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. Global crime networks use Mexican smugglers to sneak in Cubans, Brazilians, Iraqis, Africans and Chinese, accord­ing to Interpol, the internation­al police network. 
Border experts say the price for Mexican migrants has quadrupled from $300 to more than $1,200 since 1994, when the U.S. last tightened the rules. The price is higher for migrants from Central and South America -Brazilians said they pay $10,000 to $15,000 for a package that includes airfare to Mexico City and crossing the border into the U.S. 
President Vicente Fox's administration has been caught between promoting itself as the migrants' protec­tor and bowing to U.S. pres­sure to crack down on gangs sneaking migrants across the border. 
Although smugglers have

Honoring Pete Duranko 
The Blue-Gold game, which tradiiionally draws upwards of 30,000 fans to the Stadium each spring, gives alums a whiff of the Irish football experience to come in the fall. Interest has peaked in this year's game, but there's another cause the Notre Dame faithful will support this weekend. 
Pete Duranko deserves the benefit dinner his former teammates and classmates are hosting in his name Saturday at the Joyce Center. And those friends -and the Notre Dame athletie department -deserve praise !'or their efforts.

onship 1966 football team. Nor is it his selec­tion as an All-American at defensive end. 
The roason why hundreds of alumni and friends will pay $125 a plate for dinner Saturday night is who Pete is-and that's the way it should be. 
Duranko's former teammate David Martin recalls a young Pete as a hard worker who often lightened the mood on the sidelines of praetiees as part of "a bunch of really good guys from that 1966 team." That way of life earned Duranko respect. That respect earned him lifelong friends who want to help him now. 
Six years after boing diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -better known as Lou Gehrig's Disease -Duranko maintains an upbeat attitude that inspires the peo­ple who know him best. In 2002, he was in South Bend singing the Notre Dame Victory March in what he claimed to be Polish. 
But as Lou Gehrig's Disease advances, things have gotten tougher for Duranko. Ilis former teammates are hoping the Monogram Club directs a large portion of the money raised in his name-up to $100,000-towards their friend. 
And the people who are helping him now are doing the right thing. Martin chose to dedicate time and organization­al skills because he thought that was the best way to sup­port Duranko. Former Notre Dame baseball player and author Cappy Gagnon joined with Diek Swatland to compile a contact list of a slew of 
John Heisler for joining with athletic director 
Kevin White in offering support and resources to the initiative. As soon as Charlie Weis was approached, he said he would do what he could to help the cause and named Duranko an honorary captain for this year's Blue­Gold Game. 
Duranko's former teammate and fellow AII-Ameriean Jimmy Lynch and 1953 Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Lattner agreed to come to support him. 
Along with Lynch and Lattner, White and Weis, former Notre Dame standouts Bob Kuechenberg and Jim Seymour will be in attendance. So will alumni players like Kevin Hardy, Larry Conjar and George Goeddeke. 
The outpouring of support for Duranko from so many peo­ple is a testament to who Duranko is -and who the sup­porters are.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Open 'The Shirt' 

Call me impatient-but I couldn't wait to see this year's unveiling of "The Shirt." Whether or not you agree with the eolor used, "The Shirt" is a great way to show our solidarity eaeh and every football game. Unfortunately, as much as "The Shirt" is a great way to show our unity, the process in which the design is selected is anything but unifying. In order for a shirt design to be considered during the annual contest, it must be made and submitted by an undergraduate student. This is ironic because 'The Shirt" began in 1990 because of a graduate student. 
In 1989, sociology graduate student Zhengde Wang was the victim of a hit and run automobile aecident. Although not a single bone was broken, the impact to the back of his neck severed all nerve endings. Zhengde was left paralyzed for the rest of his life and basic skills such as chewing and swallowing had to be learned all over again. The first edition of "The Shirt" was created to help provide financial assistance to Zhengde and his family. 
Money raised helped pay for his medical expenses, helped to support his family that came from China to visit him, and later helped Zhengde and his family go baek to China. What is sad is that, if Zhengde were still a student today, he would be ineli­gible to submit a shirt design on the grounds that he'd be a graduate student. This is exactly what some graduate students living in Fisher-O'Hara Grace found out earlier last year as they tried to submit a shirt design. 
Freshmen, sophomore, junior, senior or grad student-We AreND. That should mean more than just dressing the same on game day.

'Jockular' offensive 
On Sunday, April 9, we, a group of Saint Mary's and Notre Dame students, l'aeulty and administration, gathered to diseuss your publieation ofthe "Jockular" eomic on April 6, 2006. Among this discussion was our eonsensus that the repetitious joke published in The Observer is deeply insult­ing and unaceeptable. Despite the common history of pride and respect Saint Mary's College and the University of Notre Dame have shared over the years, animosity has grown between the sehools, which is evident through White and Powers' comic. 
It is distressing that Saint Mary's students help fund edi­tors who choose to indude degrading comments in our campus newspaper. Why didn't the eurrent Notre Dame edi­tors of The Observer understand how unacceptable this is in a professional publication? What is the deeper issue that Jockular poorly articulated with il<> "parasite" comic? 
While this is not the first time Saint Mary's students have found "Jockular" offensive, wn do not want to have our dignity as students, as an institution or as a community called into question again. As long as we continue to fund and support this publieation -and are represented by it­we demand that you make a commitment to us, the Saint Mary's community, to avoid this issue in the future by hold­ing yourselves to a higher standard and exercising greater editorial responsibility in the future.

Celebrating an 'extra large' Observer tnilestone 
Former and current newspaper staff are converging this weekend to celebrate four decades of publishing The Observer. Their reunion may not excite others as does the Super Bowl-coincidentally now marking its fortieth year -but their pilgrimage is no less important. The vic­torious Steelers, led by former Notre Dame star .Jerome Bettis, made reference to the Homan numeral "XL" a<> repre­senting their "extra large" game. For ObsPrver alumni returning to campus, this eelnbration is as nxtra large as any. 
It mattnrs not what the first Observer headline shouted or first editorial preached, although it was a time of war and student death. Today we have come full cyde since that first printing. Whether the news be good or bad. the newspapnr sought to speak the truth daily to the campus about America, the Church, college life and the war. And so it ha<>, for 40 years -and so it shall for 40 years more. 
I wa<> most anxious to come here person­ally this weekend, because I place such great importance in the work that we specifically are doing. The Observer occu­pies a key part in the story ofAmerican Catholic life. What we do here on campus, 

Gary Caruso 
Capital Comments 

who we are and what we want to be, rep­resent a great experiment in a most diffi­cult kind of self-awareness. It is the organi­zation, maintenance and development of progressively discovering how to uncondi­tionally love others. Now it is our task, as the executives and participants in The Observer, to tell that story around the world through the Internet. 
This can be an extremely diflicult and sensitive task. On the one hand, we are an arm of the Homan Catholic Church and therefore an arm of Christianity. It is our task to bring our story around the world in a way which serves to represent Catholicism in its most favorable light. But on the other hand, as Americans who are supposed to represent the cause and arm of freedom, we are obliged to tell our story in a truthful way, to tell it, a<> Oliver Cromwell said about his own portrait, "Paint us with all our blemishes and warts, all those things about us that may not be so immediately attractive." 
This presents an almost impossible chal­lenge, and it is a source of satisfaction to me that in the last 40 years many have met that challenge so well through this publica­tion. At the heart of the matter, of course, is the position of the individual-his impor­tance, his sanctity, his relationship to his fellow men, his relationship to his God and country. 
This is in essence the struggle to make a common effort to seek the truth. It is nec­essary, therefore, in these difficult days when men and women with strong reli­gious convictions are beleaguered by those who have none, or worse, by those who are only icy cold with certainty. We compete with adversaries who tell only their so­called good stories. But the things that go bad on campus, in the Vatican or America must also be told. And we hope that the bad and the good is sifted together by peo­ple ofjudgment and discriminating discre­tion and taste. 
We who have contributed a little to telling the story do not realize the magni­tude of reporting what become our person­al "extra large" efforts. Last fall during President Jenkins' inauguration, a single editor wrote the Viewpoint editorial against 
· coeducational dormitories, defending pari­etals. Any other university president could have cited those words as broad-based stu­dent sentiment to prevent discussions for campus change for decades. Weeks ago this column exposed the plight of an alumnus who has more than honored the quite specific terms of his con­tract but is battling for his release from the 
U.S. Army rather than ship out to Iraq. It is humbling to think that a mere phrase I v.Tote may ultimately prevent injury abroad. Daily we strive to meet our respon­sibility as journalists, which carries with it an obligation to our faith, but in a larger sense carries with it an obligation to all who desire to live a life of freedom and a life which permits them to participate with their neighbors and with God in the way they choose. 
Some have always been critical ofThe Observer. But over the years, faced with a very difficult challenge, we have been able to tell our story in a way which makes it believable and credible. And that level­headed exchange is what I hope will con­tinue for as long as The Observer and the Super Bowl share anniversary dates. 
We welcome the views of others. We seek a free flow of information across interna­tional boundaries and oceans, across ide­ologies and brick walls. We are not afraid to entrust our readers with unpleasant fact<>, foreign ideas, alien philosophies and competitive values. For a nation or religion or campus that is afraid to let its own judge between truth and falsehood in an open market is one that is afraid of itself. 
This is our touchstone and the code of The Observer. Congratulations to all who have at some time or another exerted an extra large effort at The Observer. You served as an inspiration in a quest lor truth and deserve an extra large party this weekend.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
The Catholic university: commending Jenkins' position 
Father Wilson Miscamble, C.S.C., has 
written an Open Letter disagreeing with 
the outcome ofthe recent Catholic Nature 
debate; specifically .the decision to not ban 
"The Vagina Monologues" from campus 
("An open letter to Father John Jenkins," 
April11). I was profoundly offended, and 
write as a loyal son of Notre Dame to dis­
agree. 
I am personally offended by the assertion 
that those who happen to agree with 
University President Father John Jenkins 
"are those who care least about Notre 
Dame's Catholic mission." An Associate 
Professor of History betrays his profession 
by making such sweeping generalizations 
in the absence of at least some empirical 
evidence. I have been a part of the Notre 
Dame family since the mid-1950s, when 
Father Hesburgh would come to 
Indianapolis for the annual Mass and 
Communion Breakfast and stay at our 
house, to 1986 through my father's various 
activities, including permanent master of 
ceremonies for the Indianapolis Oub, 
member ofthe Alumni Association's Board 
of Directors (and ultimately its President 
and Sorin Award recipient) and one of the 
founding members of the Board of Lay 
Trustees (and ultimately its second 
Chairman and Laetare Medal recipient). I 
have been a part of that family from 1963 
to now as a student and an active member 
of both the Washington D.C. and the Lake 
County clubs, serving two years as 
President of the Lake County Club. And I 
have been party to that family since 1991 
when my first son entered to begin a string 
of 15 consecutive years -and counting­
with a son, nephew or niece on campus. 
So, yes, I am deeply offended that 
Miscamble so casually dismisses my con­
cern. 
But more importantly, I am offended by 
the dismissal ofJenkins' reasoned 
approach as cowardly. Jenkins does not 
need me to defend him, but for Miscamble 
to suggest that Jenkins can't really believe 
what he said, was concerned only about 
damage to our reputation, was "spooked" 
by the fear of negative publicity and 
"backed down" is simply degrading, and 
uncalled for. For Miscamble to complain ·that Jenkins actually may have been "influ­enced by the young women who produce this play and somehow see it as a contribu­tion to the prevention ofviolence against women" is absurd: isn't being open to the ideas of those who might actually know something about the subject an essential element of intellectual honesty? For Miscamble to suggest that Jenkins thought he would avoid controversy by this decision is to suggest that someone simply has not been paying attention. 
Such dismissiveness is the stuff of politi­cal attack ads, not reasoned debate; it is possible to disagree with another's opinion without demeaning the personhood of the opinion holder -but not, apparently, for Miscamble. It is not that we care any less about the University's Catholic mission; it is that we have a different view of what that mission entails, what it allows and what it requires. 
Having read Jenkins' opening statement, having followed the comments in The Observer and The Irish Hover and else­where, having read the closing statement, and having meditated on all of them and more, I believe Jenkins' conclusion is cor­rect. But the issue is not truly academic freedom, for I would suggest that is too narrow and, in my view, too technical. 
Hather, in my view, the debate is about the very essence of a Catholic university. What does it mean? Does the Catholic add something to the university, or subtract? Does it enhance or restrict the essence? 
And I would argue that the Catholic uni­versity's function -Our Lady's University's function -is enhanced by its evangelical and magisterium obligations. A secular university may be able to get away with avoiding moral issues; we can't. A secular university may be able to get away with avoiding questions of the role of women in society; we can't. A secular university may be able to get away with ignoring violence against women, preemptive war, capital punishment, the misdistribution of resources, degradation of the environment, labor rights and all ofthe other attacks on the.culture of life set forth in Evangelium Vitae; we can't. 
To those who would suggest conflict between Catholic and university, the Church says no: the first three words of the recent apostolic constitution on the rela­tionship between university and church (Ex Corde Ecclesiae) teach us that the Catholic university arises out of the very heart of the church. 
I wholeheartedly agree with Miscamble's analysis of the underlying moral problem: 'The painful reality is that much of the vio­lence against women in our society results from a sick view that separates sex from love and genuine relationship, from the commodification of sex, from the portrayal of women as objects, from the blatant refusal of some men to treat women with dignity and respect." I was married for 29 years, privileged to have been able to give of a total, committed love, and blest to have received the same. I am fully aware of the glories ofthat relationship, in which physi­cal intimacy is a profoundly sacred mani­festation of God's infinite love. 
But, contrary to Miscamble's suggestion, there is no contradiction between that essential link between intimacy and love, and the approval of "the continued produc­tion of a play that [at least to Miscamble] reduces women to body parts." While such an interpretation ofthe play may involve certain Horschachian elements, what ifit were true? How do we address error? 
Do we say no, Catholic teaching is clear and we can't have anything contrary on campus, as though it will not continue to exist, or the students will not find it? I think not, for that is parochial, not Catholic. 
Rather, I would respectfully suggest that both the evangelism and the magisterium obligations ofthe Catholic university demand -not just allow-engagement; we must, after all, follow in the footsteps of Jesus, and He did not refuse to engage sin­ners because some might see it as endorse­ment of sin 
Christ suffered the unclean to touch Him; invited sinners to break bread with him; even, as the five tin1es married woman at the well, to question Him. And to those who cried scandal, who challenged Him about the appearances of it all, who called upon Him to be concerned about what people would think, Christ did not back away: "Does the well man have need of the physi­cian?" He suffered sinners to come to Him where they saw the truth and were saved. 
Is the Catholic university to do less?  
And it is not enough to say that the sick  
He cured, the unclean He touched, the sin­ 
ners He engaged, had come already to  
believe, for the woman at the well had not.  
More importantly, even were it true, the  
question would remain: How did they come  
to believe? And the answer is both clear  
and on point: they came to believe because  
He came to them; He was among them,  
present to them and their needs ­and  
their doubts ­showing them the way.  
Should the University named in honor of  
His mother do less?  
In short, I believe that everyone ought be  
welcome at a university, even (or, more  
precisely, especially) a Catholic university,  
because we have a special obligation to  
confront-to engage. The American  
Bishops have placed on all the Church's  
institutions an obligation to make clear the  
Church's social teachings. And truth is  
taught, at least in part, by examination of  
error. Just as light shines brightest when  
contrasted to the dark, the Light ofthe  
Word is made clear when set in contrast to  
erroneous views. But given the intensity of  
the criticism, I am left to wonder ifthe crit­ 
ics have actually read what Jenkins so  
carefully wrote, for setting those objection­ 
able themes in the context of Catholic  
teaching is precisely what he proposes.  
We have a message, and it is joyous. We  
should proclaim it, indeed, sing it-and  
not just to ourselves as in the shower, but  
to the world. And ifthe University's  
response here, precisely tailored to engage  
the errors of the world in the context of  
Catholic teachings, is not satisfactory, then  
nothing would be ­short of abject aban­ 
donment of our role in the evangelical tra­ 
dition, our prophetic mission, to present  
the truth ofthe Resurrection of Christ, both  
God and man, to the world, so that the  
world may see and believe, rather than  
cowering behind the stone, shielding under  
the bushel the full majesty of that which we  
believe.  
Be not afraid, for Christ's sake.

WASHINGTON HALL SPOTLIGHT 
From king to don: a gangster take on 'Richard III' 


By GRACE MYERS Scene Writer 

The Not-So-Hoyal Shakespeare Company will perform "Hichard III,'' a play which, contrary to the theater eompany's name, is all about royalty. 
Taking place this weekend in Washington Hall, this powerful, elassic 
" play of a man starved for power and willing to manipulate or even kill those who stand in the way of the throne, is sure to engage and interest theater enthusiasts. Hichard III is hated by many and feared by all and yet the audience still sympathizes with this cruel leader. A poignant tale of absolute corruption and a portrayal of the dan­gers of totalitarianism, "Richard III" is as gripping as it is powerful. This production is sure to be enter­taining for all, because of its original and interesting interpretation. Set in 1950s American gang country, "Richard 
III" is directed by Jeff Eyerman, the Company Manager/Executive Director of Summer Shakespeare at Notre Dame. 
"I honestly never really fancied myself a director, I like acting much more," Eyerman said, "but this summer I happened to watch 'The Godfather' in close conjunction with McKellen's 'Richard III,' and the similarities really struck me." 
This interpretation makes the histori­cal character of Richard Ill more acces­sible to the modern audience, as well as comments on the other instances of hatred and terror within history. 
The audience sees how Richard resents his brother's power and happi­ness, suffers from a physical deformity and schemes to gain the throne of England. Using his deceptive personali­ty, skills of political manipulation and ruthless will to kill those who stand in his way, Richard's reign of terror finally alienates him from the court and his own people. 
Scott Wagner plays Richard III, giving an outstanding performance of an extremely complex character. 
Eyerman explained the reasoning behind his decision to interpret Richard as a loathsome character. 
"In the end, I think, it's just so much more fun to sit in the audience and look at this conniving, murdering, evil human being who wants to hear details about smothering children than lt, is to watch [him] grapple with his own humanity or some such tag line," he said. 
Wagner is indeed capable of the role, having participated in several other Shakespeare performances at Notre Dameand in high school. Although he's headed for medical school, Wagner wanted the part of Richard for his last performance, stating how fun the rehearsals have been and his deep respect for all his fellow cast and crew. 
"[Richard III's] one of the most diffi­cult characters I've played. He's evil, but there arc sides that are very guilty and the audience has sympathy," Wagner said. 
Eyerman's goal is for the audience "to leave the play feeling a bit like Lady Anne -walk in ready to hate the greatest villain in English history, but leave grossly captive to his honey words." Indeed, the entire cast of "Richaro III" succeeds in bringing this about, as the audience .can'1t h~lp but wrestle with their mixed feelings about the volatile Richard. 
This performance by the Not-So-Royal Shakespeare Company has a remark­able cast, crew and is an interesting and thought-provoking interpretation of a classic Shakespearean play. 
"Richard III" will be performed on Friday and Saturday at 7.30 p.m. in Washington Hall. Tickets are available both through the LaFortune Box Office and at the door.

MOVIE REVIEW 
'S111oking' lights up debate 

Photo courtesy of movieweb.com As Nick Naylor, a tobacco spokesperson, actor Aaron Eckhart adopts a defen­sive position for big tobacco companies in the media war over smoking. 
By MOLLY GRIFFIN Assistant Scene Editor 
· ·smoking is bad. Smoking is good. PR can paint tobacco in either light, as the satirical new film "Thank You For Smoking" reveals. The film takes shots at the tobacco industry, the anti-tobacco lobby and public debate in America in general. With a great cast, fresh directing and a unique satirical perspective, the film succeeds in making an entertaining film that questions just how fluid media debates can be. 
The film's opening scene shows Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) dressing down anti-smoking crusaders on a talk show. Naylor manages to make them look like 'the bad guys,' even in the presence of a bald teenage cancer 
The plot of the film is fairly simple, but the real joy is watching different situations and seeing just how Naylor talks his way out of them. He does everything from sucking up to a tobacco baron (Robert Duvall), paying off a former Marlboro Man (Same Elliott) and dealing with a Hollywood agent (Rob Lowe) and his syco­phantic assistant (Adam Brody). 
The most noticeable thing about the film is the unique style of the film, which is quick, quirky and matches the spin tech­nique perfected by the movie's protago­nist. Jason Reitman, son of "Ghostbusters" director Ivan Reitman, gives the film a fresh feeling that balances its tongue-in­cheek approach with the seriousness of the topic. 
The film also balances its criticism of the tobacco industry by pointing out the near-hysteria sur­

tobacco companies themselves. Naylor's job basically consists of doing the impossible -making tobacco companies look good -but the film makes watching Naylor do his work enjoy­able in an uncomfortable sort of way. 
Naylor attempts to balance his relation­ship with his son Joey (Cameron Bright) with his morally ambiguous job. His two 
best friends, Polly Bailey (Maria Bello) and Bobby Jay Bliss (David Koechner), work for the Alcohol and Firearms companies respectively. The trio calls themselves the MOD, or the "Merchants of Death" squad, revealing the kind

of satirical humor prevalent in "Thank You For Smoking." 
Problems for Naylor begin when he attempts to fight an anti-smoking crusade started by Senator Ortolan K. Finisitirre (William H. Macy), and he has an affair with journalist Heather Holloway (Katie Holmes). All of the work he has done for the tobacco companies falls apart, and they disown him when it becomes too complicated.

From an acting per­spective, perhaps the only weak link in the film is Katie Holmes -not because she can't act, but because she doesn't seem to possess the right com­
bination of seduction and manipulation needed to pull off her part. 
"Thank You For Smoking" is a smart, funny look at how public debates take place in our society and just how ridicu­lous they can be. The movie's mix of a great cast, unique style and a balanced approach allow the film to pull off a satire, a notoriously difficult genre to get right.

Associated Press 

MINNEAPOLIS Former Minnesota Vikings running back Moe Williams, charged last fall after a raunchy team boat party that tarnished the team's season, was found guilty of disorderly con­duct Thursday. 
A jury found him not guilty of two other misde­meanors -indecent con­duct and lewd or lascivious behavior. Williams was accused of touching the breasts of a dancer in a public space during the boat cruise on Lake Minnetonka. 
"I never intended to do anything that would basi­cally make anybody feel uncomfortable," Williams said after the verdict. 
Hennepin County District Judge Kevin Burke fined Williams $300 and ordered him to complete 30 hours of community service that benefits women or chil­dren. The exact program was not immediately determined. 
In fmding Williams guilty of just one charge, the jury determined he touched the woman in view of other people or where other peo­ple could see but that he hadn't intended to be lewd or indecent. 
Afterward, Williams 
IN BRIEF 

Woods to take break while 
father battles illness 
WELLINGTON, New Zealand­Tiger Woods will take time off from the PGA Tour while his father battles cancer, the world's No. 1 player said. 
Woods said it was possible he would not make an appearance in a tournament before the U.S. Open in June. 
He did not give specific details of his planned break, except to say he would not start playing "for a while," and the failing health of his father, Earl, would have a major influence on his future schedule. 
"It's kind of up in the air with the situation back home, so I don't know what's going to happen," said Woods, who is in New Zealand to attend the wedding of his caddie Steve Williams. ''I'm taking time off. I'm here for this event and for Steve, and to enjoy time off and be with my father, so I won't play for a while," Woods said. 
complained about being treated unfairly, saying he wondered why the captain or the cruise, who is white, wasn't charged despite evidence that he kissed a dancer's breast. Prosecutor Steve Tallen denied that race was a fac­tor in his decision about filing charges, and he has said the case against the captain was shaky. Williams is black. 
The 32-year-old Williams was the first player tried on charges related to the Oct. 6 party, in which Vikings rookies arranged to take veterans out onto Lake Minnetonka on two boats. Tackle Bryant 

Yankees first team to top $1 
billion, according to Forbes 
NEW YORK -The New York Yankees became the first baseball team valued at more than $1 billion in the annual estimates made by Forbes magazine. 
The Yankees' value increased 8 percent to $1.026 billion, the maga­zine estimated in its May 8 issue, which was released Thursday. New York had revenue of $354 million last year before paying $77 million in revenue sharing and $34 million in luxury tax. 
Forbes estimated the Yankees had a $50 million operating loss before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. 
The Boston Red Sox were pegged with the second-highest value at $617 million, followed by the New York Mets ($604 million), Los Angeles Dodgers ($482 million), Chicago Cubs ($448 million) and Washington Nationals ($440 million). 
McKinnie and cornerback Fred Smoot face the same charges and are set to go on trial in May. Charges against former Vikings quarterback Daunte Culpepper, who has since been traded to the Dolphins, were dropped. 
Prosecutors described the party as "a floating orgy" in which women on the boat changed into thong underwear and bras, gave players lap dances and, in some cases, stripped naked. They said the crew was frightened and intimidated. 
As one witness testified, "After we left the dock, it turned into a strip club." 
KinJ!s set to name new GM 
in Friday news conference 
LOS ANGELES -The Los Angeles Kings have called a news conference for Friday to announce their new general manager, with former San Jose Sharks GM Dean Lombardi the leading candidate to replace the fired Dave Taylor. 
Lombardi worked this season as a scout for the Philadelphia Flyers. 
Taylor was dismissed as president and general manager Tuesday after the Kings failed to make the playoffs for the third consecutive year. Taylor ­was asked to remain with the organi­zation in a different capacity. Assistant GM Kevin Gilmore was assigned to a position with Anschutz Entertainment Group, which owns the team. 
Also in the shakeup, interim coach John Torchetti and his staff were released. Torchetti will be inter­viewed for the coach's job by the new GM.

SAN DIEGO -Julio Franco doesn't intend to slow down any time soon. 
Franco became the oldest player in major league histo­ry to hit a home run when he connected for a two-run, pinch-hit shot in the eighth inning Thursday night to help the New York Mets rally for a 7-2 win over the San Diego Padres. 
Franco, 47, drove a 1-0 pitch from reliever Scott Linebrink (1-2) into the home-run porch do~n the right-field line at Petco Park. That gave the Mets a 3-2 lead and Franco the spot in the record book that had been belonged to Athletics pitcher Jack Quinn, who was 46 years, 357 days old when he homered on June 27, 1930. 
Franco already was the oldest player to hit a grand slam, a pinch-hit homer and have a multihomer game. 
"That won't be the last home run I hit, and I hope I hit one when I'm 50,". said Franco, who has four career pinch-hit homers. 
He wasn't joking. 

"Why not? They signed me here for two years," said Franco, who turns 48 on Aug. 23. "God gave me the great gift to play the game of baseball, and I want to play until I'm 50. If He gives me two more years, don't you think He's going to give me another one?" 
If Franco lasts that long, he'll turn 50 during the 2008 season. 
The fan who ended up with the ball gave it to Franco in exchange for a bat. Anticipating a call from the Hall of Fame, Franco said he'd send either the ball or the bat, but not both. 
The Mets had as many hits in the six-run eighth as they did in their previous two games, when they were the victims of consecutive three­hitters by the Atlanta Braves. 
Franco, in his 29th season in pro ball, signed with the Mets as a free agent on Dec. 
9. The oldest player in the majors, his one-out homer came with former Padres player Xavier Nady aboard on a leadoff double. 
"Losing those two games in a row, Peavy was throwing a great game," Franco said, referring to Padres ace Jake Peavy, who left with a 2-1 lead after seven. "We lost 2-1 yesterday, and it wouldn't be good to lose 2-1 today. It makes it more of an accom­plishment."

NCAA BASKETBALL 
UCLA guards declare, but don't hire agents 
Afflalo, Farmar can still return next year 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES-UClA guards Arron Al11alo and Jordan Farmar both declared for the NBA draft Thursday, but neither will sign with an agent, giving them the option to return to the Bruins for their junior seasons. 
Al11alo and Farmar plan to hold individual workouts for specific teams that ask, with each player paying his own way to the work­out sites. 
"My goal as a basketball player is to play in the NBA," Farmar said. "I can always come back with a great team. It's a good situ­ation for me to test it and see what people think about me and where I am." 
UClA coach Ben I lowland said he talked to 17 or 1 S NBA general managers, who projected Aftlalo and Farmar would be selected late in the first round or early in the second round of the June 28 draft. 
"Whether they both go this year or come out at the end of next year, they're both going to be in the NBA. That's a given," I lowland said at a campus news eonference. "I am totally 100 per­cent bt1hind them, as is our whole UClA basketball family in their decision to test the waters." 
Like Parmar, Afflalo said he would return to school if he was­n't assured of being a first-round pick. 
"If it's not the smartest situation possible, I'm coming back to a great team," he said. 
Farmar added, "A lot of guys don't have UCLA and the success we had to come back to." 
The players have until June 18 to withdraw their names from the draft. 
Aftlalo's and Parmar's individ­ual workouts won't begin before May 20, when they will be required to drop one of the three classes they're taking during the spring quarter and become part­time students. The quarter ends in mid-June. 
At that point, the players will no longer participate in individual workouts with the UCLA team. 
The duo said they wouldn't par­ticipate in the NBA pre-draft camp in Orlando, Fla., because it doesn't allow players to showcase their individual skills as much as solo workout<; do. 
Afflalo and Farmar were the first two recruits Howland signed when he took over in Westwood three seasons ago. The sopho­mores led the Bruins to a runner­up finish to Florida in the national championship game April 3 after helping them win the Pac-10 reg­ular-season and tournament titles.

There were concerns that Johnson would become

Johnson led the AFC with a career-high 97 catches last season. He also set a club record with 1,432 yards, leading the conference in that category for the third straight year. He became one of the league's most noticed players with his touchdown celebrations. 
The Bengals have been try­ing to lock up key parts of their offense. Fullback Jeremi Johnson got a six­year deal last Friday that will average about $1.5 million per year. 
"This is a key development for our team," coach Marvin Lewis said. "It further secures our future with one of our top players, in the prime of his career, and I want to commend Chad for his efforts in making it hap­pen. It shows his commitment to what we have going here." 

Johnson didn't immediately r-eturn a phone message. During the season, he said he'd like to spend the rest of his career in Cincinnati, try­ing to set NFL passing records with Palmer. 
Palmer had a breakout sea­son in 2005, leading the NFL touchdowns and completion percentage. He led the Bengals to their first winning record and first playoff appearance in 15 years, but tore ligaments in his left knee during a first-round loss to Pittsburgh. 
Palmer needed reconstruc­tive surgery and is expected to miss most of training camp and, most likely, part of the season. With backup Jon Kitna gone to Detroit as a free agent, the Bengals have been trying to sign a backup who could start the season if Palmer isn't ready. 
They had an agreement Thursday on a one-year deal with Wright, a free agent from Baltimore who was expected to come to Cincinnati to complete the contract in a day or so, agent Joel Segal said.

Top seed Irish battle No.8 Rutgers 
Team hopes to secure seventh Big East title 
By DAN TAPETILLO 
Sports Writer 
The top-seeded and No. 2 Irish begin their quest to earn their seventh Big East title as they face eighth-seeded Rutgers in the quarterfinals today at 9 a.m. in Tampa, Fla. Notre Dame is not only looking to defend its title but to reach the finals -a feat they have never failed to achieve since joining the confer­ence in 1996. 
"[Notre Dame] has always done really well [in the Big East Conference Championship]," Irish junior Catrina Thompson said. "We are just looking to keep doing well here and build off all the success we had [in the regular season]." 
Notre Dame earned the top 
seed and a first-round bye in the 12-team competition after finish­ing the regular season 21-1. Despite its success, the team is not looking past any competi­tors.

TRACK 
Athletes travel all over U.S. 
By CHRIS HINE Sports Writer 
In preparation for the upcoming Big East meet in two weeks, the Notre Dame track and field team will send four members this weekend to the Oregon Invitational at the University of Oregon and several sprinters to the Central Collegiate meet in Ypsilanti, Mich. 
The University of Oregon is the former home of leg­endary Olympic sprinter Steve Prefontaine, whose career was cut short due to a fatal car accident. Ptefontaine set the American record in the 5,000 meters. 
Notre Dame junior run­ner Kurt Benninger, already an automatic NCAA qualifier in the mile and 3,000 meters, will try to channel the spirit of Prefontaine as he attempts to qualify for the Mideast 
Regional  meet in  the  
5,000.  
Sophomore  Austin  

Wechter will compete in Ypsilanti in the 400-meter hurdles, hoping to improve his time by .15 seconds to qualify for the Mideast Regionals. 

''I've really done nothing different from the begin­ning of the year. I've just kept working hard and I hope to get it," he said. 
Also competing in the Central Collegiate meet are junior Maryann Erigha and the 4 x 100-relay team of Erigha, sophomore Domenique Manning, jun­ior Okechi Ogbuokiri and sophomore Brienne Davis. Erigha pulled within .02 of a second of Mideast quali­fying time in the 200­meters last weekend at the Mount San Antonio relays and will try to top that time this weekend. 
The relay team is within .14 seconds of a. Mideast qualification. 
The majority of runners will attend the meets to stay in top form for the Big East meet in two weeks. 
"You basically prepare for one or two meets on the year, but you try to prepare for the Big East like it's any other meet," sprint coach John Millar said. "You have to control your anxiety or else it becomes detrimental." 
On the year, Notre Dame has dozens of Big East and 17 Mideast regional quali­fications. 
Anxiety will surely heighten in the weeks to come, especially for the women's team, as it has a possibility of executing the triple crown of winning the indoor, outdoor and cross­country portions of the Big East meet. No women's team has accomplished this feat since Villanova in 1987.

Saint Mary's falls in a 5-4 nailbiter to Bethel 
By GREG ARBOGAST 
Sports Writer 
In its final tune-up before Saturday's conference finale against Calvin, Saint Mary's fell short against Bethel College 5-4 Thursday at Saint Mary's tennis centtJr. 
With the two teams tied at four wins each, senior Kristen Palombo battled back to win the second Sflt of her match against Hobin Braun. 
With the sunlight rapidly fad­ing, the two girls were forced to play an ultimate tie-breaker in place of the third set, and Palombo came up just short los­ingbyaseornof6-4,6-7(5), 1-0 
(10-8). 
Bel'ore its match against Bethel, the toam talked about its · concern with winning the key points in close matches. The squad's inability to do so was a major reason it lost 9-0 to Albion. The same problem also plagued the Belles against Bethel. 
In addition to Palombo's match, the team of junior Kelly McDavitt and junior Calie Mulcahy lost their doubles match to Hobin Braun and Bree Oles by the score of 9-7, and the team of Palombo and junior Grace Gordon were defeatod by Emily Lamport and Missy Vermillia by the score of <J-8 (3). 
"We did better than we have in the past in the dose games," Palombo said. "But, it was still very frustrating, because we wnren't able to got ovnr that final hurdl£1." 
Saint Mary's also played Thursday's match without the sorvices of sophomore Tara O'Brien. who has rm:ently oe!:u­piml the No. 5 singles spot for tho Bnllns. 
Frnshman MPlissa Dingler filh1d in for O'Brien and sho won lwr singlos rnat('.h over Sherra Milendar 6-4. 6-0. 
O'Brien's absl'nco, howover, meant that sophomore Cassie Quaglia. who had ynt to play a singlos matrh this season, was pressed into aetion at the No. 6 singles spot. Quaglia was com­petitivo against Bethel's Jade Walus, but stw ultimatoly fnll by tho smrn of 7-6 (5), 6-1. 
"It was slightly disappointing because the injury affected us," Palombo said. "We also tried working on some different aspects of our game in the dou­bles matches, and I think that also affected our performance." 
With the loss, Saint Mary's record drops to 10-8 for the sea­son, and it will play Calvin in its final conference match this Saturday before the MIAA con­ference tournament on April 28­
29. Despite Thursday's loss against Bethel, the team is still very upbeat for Saturday's match. 
"We're going to think about the result of this match too much, because a lot of people were happy with the way they played," Palombo said. "We're excited to go out there on Saturday and finish the confer­ence,season off on a positive note.

Irish ready to battle Lehigh 
By TIM DOUGHERTY Sporrs Writer 

After dropping from No. 9 to No. 19 in the USILA Coachns Poll with two losses last wonk­end out west in the Rocky Mountains against Dnnver and Air Force, Notre Dame (7-4, 3-2 GWLL) head to the eastern reaches of tho Appalachians to dimb out of their slump against the Lehigh (7-5, 3-2 Patriot League). 
After a travel day Monday and an ofT day Tuesday, the Irish have only had two days of prac­tice so far to prepare for Lehigh. But senior co-captain midfielder Drew Petl~rs said their strenu­ousness more than made up lor the number of days. 
"Yesterday's and [Thursday's] practice was a little tough, but real good," Peters said. "It was good to have a day off and then go real hard for a few days. I think it was beneficial for our team. A lot of drills, a lot of run­ning, but I think we did well yes­terday." 
Peters said the practices were just what the team needed to release leftover bitter emotions stemming from last weekend's loss to Colorado. 
"IThe intensity] was definitely very apparent yesterday and carried into [Thursday]," Peters said. "Everyone was kind of spent after two hard hours of practice. We're hoping for [the effort] to carry over going into the Lehigh game. 
Irish coach Kevin Corrigan also expressed general satisfac­tion with his team's effort. 
Though Notre Dame's tourna­ment hopes suffered a major blow last weekend, Corrigan refuses to let the team's past games affect its ability to take care of the work ahead. 
''I'm looking for guys that want to come out and compete against Lehigh," Corrigan said. "If we have guys sitting around and worrying about games that have already been played and worrying about things they can't control, than those guys aren't going to play for us."

Despite losing the game, the Naked players did not suffer from any self-esteem loss. 
"They were the better team, but we were better-looking," Litschi said. 
Litschi's teammate Benjamin Currie added a similar opinion about his team's superior appearance. 
"In the beginning of the game, we offered to play shirts-and skins but they were too intimidated," Currie said. 
Team 433 vs. Team 321 
Before the game, Team 321 forward Bill Reimer joked with friends that he was going to score two points. After the game, friends were congratu­lating him on his eight-point game and a 21-13 victory over team 433. 
Both teams started slow, but then quickly found their rhythm. 
Team 321 used Reimer's sur­prising play to jump out to a 4­2lead. 
Team 433 responded behind the play of Nik Hodrigm~z. holding a 6-5 advantage mid­way through the first half. But from there, Heimer and team 321 wfmt on a 10-0 run. 
Playing from behind, Team 433 did everything it could to get back in the game but failed to finish on the offensive end. The squad missed a number of' short lay-ups and jump shots and could not stop Team 321. 
"It was a travesty, a sham, and a · mockery..... a travshamoekery!" Team 433 forward Aidan Fitzgerald said. 
Team 321. on the other hand, used <Ul aggressive defense to create a number of brnakaway lay-ups to dose out the game. 
"All our training paid off," Heimer said. "We had a tough game in the first round, so we got out here and worked real hard."

"They shot the ball really well in the first half," Clover Ridge captain Paul Hagan said.

for the Irish on themselves, some­thing that has clearly worked thus far this season. The major focal points for Notre Dame in the days leading up to the match up with the Scarlet Knights have been their ability to re-defend once they have lost possession. 
Also key in the Irish game plan will be their ability to run a suc­cessful fast break, avoiding going into their set attack plans until absolutely necessary. 
Sophomore attack Heather Ferguson said the Irish need to focus not only on their tactics and play on the field, but also their mindset off it, 
"Coach Coyne has told up to keep our heads up, because there is still the season ahead of us, and we need to get ready to make an impact on the tournament," Ferguson said. "We need to buck­le down and concentrate on the next three games." 
The Irish will also look for sen­ior attack Crysti Foote to be heav­ily involved in the attack as she has all season -she is second in the nation in points-per-game. Foote's performance this season has also led to her Tewaaraton Trophy nomination. 
The award is given to the nation's best male and female col­lege lacrosse players, making her only the second Irish player to be nominated. 
Freshman attack Jill Byers has played well all season and Notre Dame will look for that to contin­ue this weekend. Byers has already broken Irish freshman records for assists (16) and points 
(54) and is only one goal away from breaking Courtney Calabrese's record of 38 goals in a freshman season. 
Overall, the Irish feel confident about their contest with the Scarlet Knights, and believe that it will be a good win for the Irish after two of their toughest losses in recent memory. 
"We should be very successful if we play our game," Ferguson said. "We just need to continue playing the way we have and we should come out with a win."

week and was booed by the Phoenix fans most of the day. 
He then celebrated his first pole since February of last year by climbing onto the pit road wall and waving his arms in the air. 

"Do snow angels," Stewart said sarcastically of the cele­bration tactic Busch's older brother, Kurt, has recently adopted. 
Stewart can mock if he wants, but the Busch brothers are hot in Phoenix. Kurt won this race last year, giving the Busch brothers a sweep on the flat, mile-long oval. 
"It's not whether you are getting boos or cheers, it's who gets the most noise," Kyle Busch said. "Right now it's close between Jeff Gordon and Dale Earnhardt Jr., but the Busch brothers are steadily climbing that rope." 
No driver has ever won from 

the pole in the 19 Cup events at Phoenix, but Kyle Busch liked his chances in the Chevrolet he said was the "sister car" to November's winning entry. 
"We have a good race car," he said. "It's the sister car, so hopefully we can make it just as good, if not better." 
Matt Kenseth qualified fourth and was followed by Carl · Edwards, who has a new crew chief this week after the shake­up at Roush Racing. Denny Hamlin was sixth, Kurt Busch qualified seventh and then boasted about how far his little brother has come in his short Cup career. 
"It seems the young Jedi has done well," Kurt Busch said. "He learns quick, he's putting all his knowledge from his own team and what I've given him to work with. 
"He's got the fastest car in the county today." 
Clint Bowyer was eighth and Martin Truex Jr., and points leader Jimmie Johnson round­ed out the top 10. 
For Biffle, his qualifying run was perhaps a sign the bad luck that has plagued him through the first seven races of the season may be lifting. Accidents or mechanical fail­ures have taken him out of con­tention several times this sea­son and Biffle, who finished second to Stewart in the final standings last season, is cur­rently 23rd in the points.

Streak at stake 
Game sold out by 5 
p.m. Thursday night 
By CHRIS KHOREY Associate Spons Editor 
It's going to be a busy week­(md at Frank Eck Stadium. 
Notre Dame heads into a three-game home series against Hutgers Friday, Saturday and Sunday rid­ing a single­season 
-
sr.hool­reeord 19­game win­ning streak and looking to continue that sueeess against a team that that has been its areh-nemesis since both schools joined the Big East in 1996. 
"We don't need any incentive whnn we play Hutgers," Irish eoaeh Paul Mainieri said. "They've been our big rival sinee we've been in the Big East. We both entered the con­ferenee in the same year, and we've been pretty consistently the top two teams in the league ever since." 


The Irish (29-8, 11-1 in the Big East) have not lost since March 25 against Georgetown. Mainieri said the team did not acknowledge the streak -the longest ever for Notre Dame in a single season and longest overall for the Irish since 1907 -until a team meeting Monday, and no one in the clubhouse has mentioned it since. 
"The winning streak kind of snuck up on us since we've had so many big games along the way," Mainieri said. "We had big series against Pittsburgh and St. John's and a big game against Ball State. I decided to mention it on Monday, and our goal was to get those two victories and break ,the [single season] reeord. 
With the record in hand, Mainieri said the Irish are looking forward to Rutgers, not baek at their last 19 con­tests. 
"We accomplished what we wanted to do, which was break the record. Anything else is just gravy on top of that," he said. "We need to beat Rutgers for the fun of beating Rutgers."

The Heckers All Americans used a selfless style of basketball to rout The View Tavern on the cor­ner of Niles and Jefferson 21-9 Thursday. 
Heckers jumped out to a 3-0 lead after forward Jimmy Small dunked on a breakaway. On that basket, Small cut his hand for the second time. Unfortunately for the members of the View, those cuts didn't slow him down. 
After a quick turnaround jumper from the free throw line by The View, Heckers went on a 4-0 run to stretch the lead to 7-1. 
Heckers used superior defense, and was able to run the eourt extremely WPll.

Rutgers next Irish opponent 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Spons Writer 
Notre Dame hopes to rebound from two tough losses to ranked opponents Saturday against Rutgers. 
The one-goal losses to No. 1 Duke and No. 3 Georgetown leave the Irish {10-3, 2-1 Big East) still ranked No. 7 -proof of the tough road the Irish have faced this season. The loss against Georgetown moved the Irish to second in the Big East. 
Notre Dame wants to turn around this weekend and keep winning in the Big East, where it will face Hutgers (6-6, 1-3) to fm­ish up a live-game road trip that started March 31. The Irish have faced the Scarlet Knighl<> only six times, with Notre Dame holding the overall edge at 4-2. Hutgers won the two teams' last meeting April 25, 2004 in Piscataway, 7-6. 
As always, Irish coach Tracy Coyne has tried to keep the focus

BayIiss aims for next Big East title 
By KATE GALES Associate Sports Editor 
1996. 1999. 2002. 2004. 2005. 
This weekend, the Irish hope to add another Big East title to the five they have won since joining the conference. The team has played in the finals every year and is undefeated in the finals since 2001 (the 2003 conference final was called due to weather). 
"I think the main focus is to get tomorrow's match over," said coach Bobby Bayliss from Florida, where the team is practicing. "To win the match tomorrow and not be extended physically, and be ready to go for Saturday -we'll expect tougher matches on Saturday." 
This year's tournament is in Tampa at the University of Southern Florida, and the Irish face Georgetown tomorrow at noon. 
"The big thing now is [to] acclimate to the heat," Bayliss said. "It's about 87 degrees today and very humid. That's something no matter what we do we aren't used to yet. As we stay down here you get a little more acclimated." 

The team arrived in Florida Wednesday night. 
"They key is, we only have two days to practice and pre­pare," Bayliss said. "We won't be here long enough to totally get acclimated to the heat, and at the same time, we don't want to overdo it so we're exhausted come Friday or Saturday or Sunday." 
The other challenge for the Irish has been adjusting to new courts. 
"It's been a balance of both," Bayliss said. "That's the biggest thing, just getting used to the speed of the courts and heat and humidity and trying to fine tune the things we need to do a little better."

It's all for the love of Pete 
Members of the 1966 national championship squad organize event to raise moneyfor former teammate

David Martin knew his time was morn valuabln than his checkbook to Petn Duranko, his former tnam­matn from the 1W16 national cham­pionship football squad who sufl'ers from ALS, a debilitating condition morn commonly known as Lou <;ehrig's Dist~ase. 
So when he and his friend Pete Sc~huJtn WPrtl talking three months ago about the best way to help sup­port Duranko, Martin said he'd ded­icate his frne time to organizing an cwent to raise money for the former All-America dnfnnsivo lineman.

Irish look for help from new faces 
Ferrine and Maurice Crum, Jr.? 

Notre Dame's chances rest on play­ers like them -guys with more toughness than talent who are aching for an opportunity to play. 
Example A: Corey Mays. 

The Irish linebacker entered as a stud recruit out of Chicago in the fall of 20()1, only to spend the next four years playing almost exclusively on 
special teams. Last season -his first and only as a starter -he finished sec­ond on the team in tackles and, along with Brandon Hoyte, comprised the fiery core of the Irish defense. 
In a sense, he was a bonus in Weis' inaugural cam­paign. 
Hoyte's contribu­tions were expected when 2005 kicked ofl'. 
Mays' abilities weren't fully appre­

It'll be entertaining to watch Zbikowski flex and fly around the field. 
And Quinn-red jersey or green jersey -is worth the price of admis­sion and more. 
But it's a practice-the 15th and fmal of spring football. A fancy practice in front of a half full Notre Dame Stadium, yes. 
"But while the whole nation expects the soon­to-be-senior Irish quarterback to throw for a halfmile per game this season -and rightfully so -the real 
issue heading into . Saturday's Blue-Gold game is "Who else is 
ready to play?" 
ciated until the season ended. 

The expectations haven't been this high for the Irish since David Gordon and that Jesuit college from Massachusetts kicked Notre Dame out of the No. 1 spot back in 1993. 
And if the hopes of Notre Dame fol­lowers are to be fulfilled, another Corey Mays must blossom. 
It could be James Aldridge. It could be Casey Cullen. It could be Terrail Lambert. 
Who knows? But there's no reason to worry right now. 
Of' course it's nice to watch Trevor Laws beat up on the second string oll"ensive linn like he did during an MVP performance in last season's Blue-Gold game. 
But a practice nonetheless. 
Spring games always seem to cause more teeth gnashing than watching the Clippers on NBA Draft day. 
No one really wins. 
For all the excite­ment to be had after a crisp Quinn-to­Samardzija touch­down pass Saturday, there will be an equal amount of grumbling over whether the Irish 
secondary is any better than it looked against Troy Smith, Ted Ginn and Ohio State. 
For all the oohing and aahing over a pancake block by freshman behe­moth Chris Stewart, there will be just as much complaining about the lack of a pass rush. 
And for all the thrill of gold helmets gathering in the tunnel before the squad takes the field, there will be the frustration of waiting four and a half months to see just how good Notre Dame will be.

Quinn deals -with lif~ under pressure-frolll -within 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Editor 
It's all about winning games. Everything else will come later. 
That's how Notre Dame quarterback Brady Quinn han­dles the hype surrounding his upcoming senior season. The early favorite for the Heisman Trophy, Quinn handles the pressure the way Irish coach Charlie Weis and quarterbacks coach Peter Vaas want him· to -ignore it. 
"[The Heisman hype] is obvi­ously flattering, but at the same point in time, it's some­thing that's handled after the season, so it doesn't really matter," Quinn said. "If every­thing goes well for us, good things will come." 
Quinn said he knows the stat-tracking media and lleisman hype will be omnipresent during the 2006 season, but he's confident he can put the outside pressures aside and focus on game strategies and the offensive 

playbook. 
At the annual spring media day March 21, Vaas said Quinn's experience as a starter since freshman year has helped him learn to handle pressure. 
"Obviously, the quarterback position at the University of Notre Dame is an extremely high-profile position," he said. "To be able to handle that on a daily basis is what's important. Handling it on a daily basis means you go out and you do your job with the expectation that you're going to get better." 
For Weis, that's an impera­tive. 
The coach who told his team "9-3 is not good enough" expects Quinn to hone his men­tal skills to accompany the 6­foot-4, 232-pound star's physi­cal abilities. 
"He has very few limitations physically," Weis said at the media day. "I think mental is what holds you back more than anything. [But] I think now we're at the expanding mode." 
Less than a month later, Weis was a little more forthcoming about Quinn's mental prowess. 

"If I slip up, he knows it," Weis said in a press conference April 12. "I can't hide if I make a mistake with him. If I call a play and I call it a little bit wrong, he'll say, 'You mean this."' 
We is said part of Quinn's development mentally is attrib­utable to the way the team critically assesses itself, even when it succeeds. 
"Sometimes when you look, at a play in the game and it's a completed pass, you'd say that's a nice job," Weis said. ''I'll say to him, 'What's your first read? Was he open? Did you see him? Did you even look at him?"' 
Quinn has taken that chal­lenge from his coach to become a better quarterback -and he has also taken the challenge to become a better leader. 
"Every team wants to have that in their quarterback ­someone who understands the offense and how things are 


supposed to go," Quinn said. "If coach is saying that, then that's a good thing." 
But Quinn's leadership style is different than his coach's, and he gives credit to some of his school courses for the way he handles himself. 
''I'm a business major, so you go through a basic require­ment of courses and ... you learn management and team building -ways to deal with people, not necessarily in a negative way," Quinn said. "You're not always trying to get down on people when they're doing something wrong. Maybe tell them what they're doing right." 
Notre Dame running back Darius Walker said Quinn is an ideal leader by example in the locker room and in the huddle. 
"Brady carries a certain aura about himself," Walker said. "He's [definitely] grown as a leader." 
While Quinn will be examin­ing his teammates this year as the offensive captain, he will be the one under the micro­scope most intensely in the national press. After throwing for 3,919 yards and 32 touch­downs in the 2005 campaign, he knows people will be expecting him to top his record-setting season. But he also knows that worrying about high expectations and praises will only hinder his achievement of goals. 
"If you're worrying too much about ... what people are writ­ing or saying about you, you're going to waste too much time rather than preparing for the next week's game," Quinn said. 
Vaas said that approach works for Quinn because of the source of his drive to improve. 
"One of the things that's nice about Brady is that he is an extremely self-motivated indi­vidual," Vaas said. "I wouldn't think he'd use [the attention] as a motivational tool, not at this point in time ... because that's him -he just works at [getting better] every single day." 
For Quinn, every single day is a day not just for improve­ment -the days are for ignor­ing the hype.

Dame football e late 1980s and 
1993 season where he was the defensive coordinator of the No. 2 team in the nation, Minter left Notre Dame and accepted the head coaching position at Cincinnati. 
With the job came another change. Minter was now in charge of more than defense for this first time in his career. He said he adopted more of a "CEO" role dur­ing his time at Cincinnati, delegating defensive responsibilities to other coaches and becoming more hands on with the offense. 
And -for the first time in Minter's career -he was learning defensive strategies from people working for him rather than people employing him. 
"Really what it gave me a chance to do is, really up close and in person, learn that there really were a lot of ways to skin a cat," Minter said. "So I learned from those guys who really worked under me watching them coach defense their way." 
The learning paid off. After coaching under Holtz -the man who made build­ing teams his reputation -Minter was constructing his own program. Cincinnati became a recognizable name in college football in the late 1990s when the Bearcats went to three consecutive bowl games. 
Minter became the winningest coach in school history during his 10 years at Cincinnati. In 2002, the Bearcats were co­champions of Conference USA and he led the team to four bowl games in six sea­sons. He produced an All-American in kicker Jonathon Ruffin and 26 first-team all-league players. 
But like most things involving Minter, he is unwilling to accept full credit for his achievements, deferring his success to the quality of individuals he surrounded him­self with over his career. 
"I think today you're just a culmination of all the people you've come in contact with along the way," Minter said. 
The year of the Irish? 
With all Minter's achievements through­out his career, he now has the opportunity to make his most significant coaching impact. The Irish are a legitimate national championship contender. And if Notre Dame wins its first title since 1988, Minter will receive much of the credit. 
The Irish have the offense with quarter­back Brady Quinn, running back Darius Walker, receivers Jeff Samardzija and Rhema McKnight and a virtually untouched returning offensive line. 
The athletes on defense are there too. Safety Tom Zbikowski returns as a third team All-American and defensive end Victor Abiamiri has been studying Michael

It will also allow Minter to rinse his mouth of the bad taste left from that game and erase the memory of Ted Ginn accel­erating on an end-around and Santonio Holmes stretching out for a long reception. 
Because until that can happen, Minter will still be seeing red in the midst of his team's blue and white practice jerseys and the golden shine of Notre Dame's helmets, his own defensive brilliance and the team's unmistakable potential.

Vacant spot-looms large for returning kick specialists 
By ERl C RETTER Associate Sports Editor 

Coming into spring practice, Notre Damn !~tend the unenviable task of replacing graduating sen­ior D.J. Fitzpatrick -who had bonn the team's primary place­kicker and puntPr in each of the past two seasons -with players who lacked significant game 
nxpnrit~ncn. 

"In terms of our kicking game this spring, I think it's pivotal that we get two or throe specialists to step up and really take the bull by the horns and take OIHl of those jobs," Irish special tnams coach Bill Polian said at the team's spring mndia day March 
21. "Having to replace ILl., you know, ynah, that's not an ideal situation to have onn guy doing both and now he's gone, but we li~nl confident that thern arn guys in this program that will step up and win one of those jobs." 
As spring practice draws to an end a month later, Notre Dame is at least a step closer to filling those positions for the 2006 sea­son. 
Notre Dame eoach Charlie Weis said junior Geoff Price had a strong spring at punter and the coaching staff has taken notice. 
"Out of all the things on the special teams ... the thing I've been pleased the most about has been Price's punting," Weis said. 
Weis calculated Price's average distance at 43 yards per punt, and was specifically pleased with both the distance and hangtime of his punts. 
"The biggest problem [is that] there's been a couple times he's outkicked the coverage," Weis said. 
Weis, however, isn't likely to ollicially name a starter at punter or kicker until al'ter the team returns to bngin the season in the fall with the incoming freshman 


class -including kicker Ryan 
Burkhart. 

"I don't know if we've got any­thing set in stone in terms of the depth chart, because we still have an entire August camp," Polian said. 
What's more, the weather has kept the team indoors for nine of its first 13 practices. 
"Being outside [only] four times and not being able to really cut loose and hit the ball as hard as we want to hit it has been just a little bit of an annoyance, but I think our kids have done a pretty good job of overcoming that," Polian said. 
Although the Irish have been inside more than anticipated this spring, the kickers and punters have been able to get substantial work in. 
"We've had to try and get cre­ative, and that's fine, that's part of it," Polian said. "What we end up spending a lot of time on is a lot of technique a lot of'. 'Okay, were going to work on this one skill, this one phase of a skill and let's focus on that. For instance, we've spent a lot of time with [Price] on the footwork in his punting ... whether we're inside · or outside, he can work on the eonsistency of his footwork or his drop." 
At kicker, junior Carl Gioia has begun to distance himself from the pack, which included fifth­year senior Craig Cardillo and rising senior Bobby Renkes. However, he will also have com­petition from Burkhart in the fall. 
"Hight now, Carl is clearly the No. 1 guy, but we got this young leg fin Burkhart] coming round here pretty soon, and he's going to get a chance to beat him out," Weis said. 
While Burkhart is highly regarded among the coaching staff, Polian stressed the difficulty of a player making an impact in his first year out of high sehool. 
"I think it's difficult for any true freshman to start at any position just because the level of competi­tion jumps up, especially at a place like this where you're eon­stantly playing the best in the country," he said. "That being said, it happens, whether or not it'll happen here we have no idea. Time will tell -August will tell." 
Although he is pleased about separating himself from the paek during spring practice, Gioia emphasized that the starting job won't be won or lost until Notre Dame gets closer to the start of the regular season in the fall. 
"The real stuff won't come until after summer and into fall," Gioia said. "In terms of preparation it's just going to be just trying to compete against myself up until then, trying to get better in the areas where I think I need to get better." 


While Weis has been encour­aged by what he has seen in the past month, he also underscored that this spring is only an indica­tion of the possibilities for the fall. 
"The jury's still out on this one, because right now it's not live rush, there's not 80,000 people there, we're not playing in Atlanta under the lights on September 2 ]in Notre Dame's season opener against Georgia Tech]," he said. "But I'd say, of everything, !the concern about the specialisL'il, which was one of my biggest eoncerns, right now, at this point, is not as much of a concern as it was at the start of the spring."

Young gun showdown 
New faces compete for spots on roster that includes nine returning starters on both offense and defense 
By KEN FOWLER and 
CHRIS KHOREY 
Sports Writers 
While Notre Dame returns nine starters on offense and another nine on defense, new faces will likely contribute sig­ni11cantly to the team in 2006. 
Paul Duncan right tackle 
With the graduation of start­ing right tackle Mark LeVoir, Irish coach Charlie Weis will choose from among fifth-year senior Brian Mattes, sopho­more Michael Turkovich and sophomore Paul Duncan for the new starter at that posi­tion. 
Although Weis has said that Duncan is the leading candi­date after spring practice, he has been quick to point out that the position is still up for grabs. Duncan, a 6-7, 270­poundnr from Dallas, Georgia, played in five games in 2005. 
"[Right tackle] is going to be wide open," We is said. "Somebody is going to have to take that position, whether it is Duncan. Mattes, Turkovich or a player that's not here yet." 
But Duncan enters as the favorite not only because of his spring, but also his size. Among the returning players, his 6-foot-7 frame stands out. Duncan could use a little more muscle mass on his body to thicken up, but that won't be too difficult under Irish strength and conditioning coach Ruben Mendoza. 
Duncan has the footwork necessary to patrol the out­side of the line and the vision needed to see incoming blitzers. Irish offensive line coach John Latina said that communication among the young linemen has improved, which will make Duncan's possible transition into the starting five much easier. 
So long as Duncan beats out incoming freshman Sam Young, a top-1 0 offensive line recruit, he will see consider­able development throughout the course of the season.

ed to see considerable time in the backfield this season behind the veteran duo of jun­ior Darius Walker and senior Travis Thomas. 
Aldridge brings a combina­tion of Walker's patient out­side running and Thomas' hard-hitting style to the table, a prospect that will allow Weis to use him in all game situations. Weis said Wednesday that Aldridge's presence will allow him to get "creative" with the playcall­ing. 
Although Aldridge has seen slightly limited time in the spring, the 15 extra practices will quicken his learning curve compared to the rest of the freshman class. 
George West wide receiver 
West joins Aldridge and offensive lineman Chris Stewart as the third of Notre Dame's early-enrollee fresh­men this spring. 
West has seen significant time returning kickoffs this year and likely will join Grimes deep during times next season. West has enough quickness to drastically increase Notre Dame's pro­duction on kickoff returns. Last season, the Irish aver­aged 19 yards per return in the category. West should be able to make an impact on special teams within the first few weeks of next season. 
At 5-foot-8, 172 pounds, West is smaller and lighter than most receivers, but he possesses enough speed to make him the kind of deep threat Matt Shelton was for Notre Dame in 2004. 
West, a native of Spencer, Okla., likely will be listed as the team's No. 5 receiver ­behind Samardzija, McKnight, Grimes and rising sophomore 
D.J. Hord. But expect West to catch a considerable amount of passes when he gets in a game as defenses focus on the team's top-three receivers.

-Weis said Wednesday that hn is not sure where Maurice Crum will play next season, but he is comfort­able putting Crum at any of tho three linebacker slots in Hick Minter's defense. 
Playing with Brandon Iloyte and Corey Mays, Crum picked up 57 tacklns (32 solo), ineluding 3.5 tack­los for loss. Limited due to an injury this spring, Crum has spent most of the team's 15 practices watching from the sidelines, evaluating the three linebacker slots ­"Will," "Mike," and "Apache." 

Joe Brockington is a natu­ral linebacker who looks to bt~ in the mix for one of the 
LINEBACKERS 
two open spots that Crum doesn't fill in 2006. Brockington has served as a backup linebacker for the past two seasons after red shirting his freshman cam­paign. 
Another option at line­backer is rising junior Anthony Vernaglia. 
Vernaglia came to Notre Dame as a defensive back but added muscle mass last season and saw limited action at linebacker. In 2006,. Vernaglia could play the Apache position. 
Other options for the Irish at linebacker include rising sophomore Steve Quinn and incoming freshman Morrice Richardson. Quinn played in nine gamns -mostly on special teams and recorded two tackles in 2005. 
Richardson is a 6-foot-3, 235-pound prospect who likely will challenge for backup time. The linebacker battles will be the closest­watched competition in fall camp.
