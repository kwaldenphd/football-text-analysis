Scholastic eliminates SMC editor position 
By PEGGY PROSSER 
Staff Reporter 
To "increase the efficiency of the production schedule," the position of Saint Mary's editor at Scholastic magazine has been eliminated, said the magazine's editor-in-chief, Jim Basile. 
"We had to change our produc­tion system over break. I didn't like the way it was mnning," Basile said. 
Although Saint Mary's students will still take part in the production of the magazine, it was not feasible to have both a Notre Dame and Saint Mary's editor covering Scholastic's stories, according to Maher Mouasher, Scholastic's general manager. 
"It was inefficient to have two people on stories, there was too much overlap," said Mouasher. 
Although her position as Saint Mary's editor no longer exists, former editor Barb Blanchette still handles many of the same editorial duties as well as serving as produc­tion manager, Basile said. 
"Barb is still in charge of recruiting people from Saint Mary's who can work in business, art and layout," Basile said. 
As production manager, Blan­chette handles photo assignments and layout of the magazine, while still working to encourage Saint Mary's students to participate, he said. 
Because the College does not have an equal number of students as Notre Dame, coverage of Saint Mary's events will become more unified with Notre Dame coverage, according to Mouasher. 
"Since we don't have an equal number of subscribers from Saint Mary's and Notre Dame, we can't give equal coverage," said Basile. 
"We really don't want to give Saint Mary's 'token coverage,' " ad­ded Mouasher. 
Scholastic has gone beyond covering campus events at both schools, and both Mouasher and Basile consider it to be a "general interest" magazine, they said. 
Because of this, the magazine covers a wide variety of stories, such as women in education at Notre Dame minority issues at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's and major political events, Basile said. 
"We aren't a newspaper, we don't specifically cover Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. We cover wider things, such as politics and medical issues," he added. 
Candidates in ND elections 
cite campaign plans, goals 
By FRANK LIPO and THERESA GUARINO 
Senior StaffReporters 
Student body presidential and vice presidential elections Tuesday feature seven tickets, a substantial increase over the past few years. 
"Attitude, programming and finances," are three areas that the Jim Domagalski-Laurie Bink ticket plans to address. 
"Do students get their $35 worth (of the student activity fee)?" Domagalski said. "The response we've been getting is no." 
Domagalski and Bink said they plan to gain respect by having stu­dent support behind their ideas and seeking student input beforehand. "We first must gather the support of students in order to gain the respect of students and the ad­ministration," he said.

Saint Mary's shows little need for services 
By TRIPP BALTZ 
Copy Editor 
No Saint Mary's student ever has undergone mandatory counseling for drug use, accor­ding to Dorothy Feigl, acting vice president of the College. 
'IThere has never been a refer­ral," said Feigl, ''where the stu­dent has had to go (to counseling)." 
She said no teacher or ad­ministrator could use counseling as a method of discipline against drug users. "Counseling here is very professional," she said. Feigl said counseling for any matter remains confidential ". . . as it does in any counseling operation." 
"Counseling services here are student-centered," she said. "The whole tendency is to reach out to the students, working for their interests." 

"We expect to get along with the administration, not as students to administrators, but as equals respective of each other's position, working to achieve goals that are best for the student body, as well as the administration's," according to the Thomas Grier-Steve Guenther ticket. 
The ticket mentioned three priorities once elected to office: a restructuring of parietals regula­tions and penalties, on-campus "21" social gatherings, and the for­mation of an ethanol research com­mittee. 
"Flashy platforms and colored posters don't mean much," said Guenther. "People should be aware of quality, not quantity." 
"Establishing and utilizing all the avenues of communication and of student input" is a goal of the Bruce Lohman-Jim Crandall ticket, said 
The Counseling and Career Development Office, staffed by one full-time and three part­time counselors, is directed by Dr. Mary DePauw. DePauw was out of town and unavailable for comment. 
Feigl said rectresses and resi­dent assistants inform the dean of students when a drug offense comes to their attention. That individual is Mary Anne O'Don­nell, who was busy with matters relating Sophomore Parents' Weekend this week and was unavailable for comment. 
The Alcohol Education Office is available for students with questions or problems relating to abusive drinking, according to Molly Sullivan, the part-time counselor at the office. 
"I am a substance abuse counselor," Sullivan said. She works 10 to 12 hours a week at the office. She has worked there 
alcohol-related problems. Cronin said she would like to have some kind of formal set­ting such as SOAP for drug counseling. 
"My only quarrel is that it's been my experience that the message is more clear when they can talk to one another," Cronin said. "They laugh a lot, make jokes." 
She said she thought the re­cent incidents, where drug­related problems caused suspen­sion, may force the administra­tion to create such a program. 
She said what is talked about in any counseling is strictly

Lohman. Lohman said his ad­ministration would encourage any student to walk into his office and have input. He said he would steer such students into the right channel for action and would encourage them to pursue ideas themselves. 
"There are existing University committees" which can handle stu-· dent concerns, said Lohman. Lohman said his administration would understand the system and push the right button for proper ac­tion. Using proper channels and not just loud rhetoric would best serve students, Lohman said. 
The ticket of Mike Millen-Sheila O'Connor is "completely against an increase in the student activity fee," according to Millen. He said com­plete financial reform is necessary for student government. "Few peo­

Sullivan said most of the students who come to her just have questions. ''They are refer­red to me through RAs," she said. However, she said some of the students are counseled for disciplinary reasons. 
"We put out a number of publications. But, the people who come to us aren't necessari­ly alcoholics." 
Sullivan said it would be possible to offer drug counseling through the Alcohol Education office. "We ad­ministered a survey and includ­ed questions about drug use. We tried to make it visible that there are other drug problems." 
Sullivan said she could offer counseling for students who smoke pot. But she said she has never seen anybody for drug use. ''They don't show up for it."

Tylenol precautions already taken on both ND and SMC campuses 

By ROB HENNIG 
News Staff 
Precautions have been taken on both the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's campuses in lieu of the re­cent Tylenol scare in the New York area, which prompted health of­ficials to ban Tylenol capsules in Indiana and other states. 
Saint Mary's Shaheen Bookstore removed all Tylenol from its shelves prior to the state banning of capsule sales, said bookstore spokesman Barbara Racine. 
"We pulled it as soon as the first story broke out about the death," she said. 
According to Brother Conan Moran, the Hammes Notre Dame bookstore manager, the bookstore did not stock Tylenol in any form before the incident. He said he doe3 not intend to stock Tylenol in the immediate future. 
The Student Health Center at Notre Dame also does not stock Tylenol. 
"We've never carried Tylenol," said Carol Seager, director of the center. She added, however, "If so­meone comes in and particularly re­

Anyone with Extra Strength Tylenol capsules should return them to the pharmacy where they were purchases, chelminiak said. Jim Goshert of Broadmoor Drugs in South Bend said the pharmacy there is exchanging capsules for caplets. 
Goshert added there is a toll-free number set up by Tylenol manufac­turer Johnson and Johnson for anyone with questions. The number is (800) 237-9800. 
JoAnn Widerquist, assistant pro­fessor of nursing at Saint Mary's, said the Tylenql scare poses poten­tial problems for community health. "If people in general can't trust the packaging, that brings all medicine into question," she said.

Krauser said he purchased the winning ticket at Way-Low Grocery in Michigan on U.S. 31. "I played every week when I got up that way. I've always played the same numbers," he said. 
Krauser, 61, said he will official­ly retire in April after 38 years of service at the Notre Dame power plant. "Until then I will be on vaca­tion," he said. 
The money will be put in a trust fund for his two children, a daughter who graduated from Notre Dame in 1982 and a married won't be affected in any direct way. 
Most people are not abnormally affected by the incident, according to Sheridan McCabe, associate pro­fessor of psychology at Notre Dame. "Some people don't think about it, others dont buy Tylenol anymore," he said. 
William Tageson, associate pro­fessor of psychology at Notre Dame, said a copycat effect takes place when someone imitates the ac tions of others. "Sometimes the media can unknowingly foster this type of activity (by sensationalizing the news)," he added. 
"Somebody who is really paranoid and angry at the com­pany" (Johnson and Johnson) could be the culprit, Tageson said. It might be somebody who was fired or had another grievance against the company, he said. 
Tageson indicated the motive would be "getting revenge upon the company." He included not just the manufacturer, Johnson and Johnson, but also distributors or warehouses as the potential victims intended by the culprit. "I'm sure that they somehow justify it to themselves," Tageson said.

And he'll continue to play the lot­tery. "I wouln't make a special trip though," he added.

Becker, Scheuermann selected for top Observer posts in 1986-87 
Kevin Becker, a sophomore Program of Liberal Studies and computer applications major, has been selected managing editor of The Observer, and Eric Scheuer­mann, a junior accounting major, 
has  been  named  business  
manager.  
A  native  of  New  Orleans,  

Becker joined the newspaper at the beginning of his freshman year by working in the production department. 
In March of his freshman year, Becker was promoted to assistant Viewpoint editor. He has served as a regular Viewpoint columnist since arriving at The Observer.

"There's money there (student government's budget) doing nothing," he said. "Thousands and thousands of dollars are being left unused." "It makes no sense for Student  
Activities to have an endowment," Millen said. Millen said true stu­dent opinion must be discovered and research must be done to deter­mine the strengths and weaknesses of plans. Only then should plans be taken to the administration, he said.

..Confidentiality is very im­portant here," Cronin said. "There are many pre­professionals who are often worried that it would 'come out.' What they say in there stays in there.'' She said it is often hard for  
people to tell if someone is hav­ing a problem with drugs. Some are able to hide it better so it ap­pears it is not affecting their lives, she said. "People think if you're using stuff you'll go down hill. That's not always true," said Cronin. "It's just sitting down there waiting.'' She said that the problem often surfaces later in life. "Maybe if we can cut that time down so they don't get their lives messed up," she said. She said most students do not want to quit using drugs when they come to her. ''they don't want to talk about whether they should or shouldn't. We talk  
about what it's doing to them," she said. She said most people she counsels are men. "I think it  
reflects the attitude about young women at a Catholic universi­ 
ty," she said. "They ought to behave in a certain way. That doesn't mean they do.''

The managing editor controls the daily operations of the newspaper and implements long­range improvements within the newspaper. 
"The Observer has become a much more professional newspaper over the last few years. I fully expect that progress to con­tinue," Becker said. 
"Our goal is to instill a team concept in our staff, to promote a united effort in serving the com­munity, and to open our organization to more students," Becker concluded. 
"We are serious candidates," said Don Montanaro, of the Mike Switek-Don Montanaro ticket. 
As for the most pressing issue facing students, Switek said, "We wonder sometimes -would a true Hungarian eat Hungarian Noodle Bake?" 
"We propose continuous restruc­turing of student government," said Switek. "The administration can borrow our crayons whenever they want to (referring to their cam­paign posters)." 
Looking into the possibility of fraternities, sororities and coed dorms are three goals mentioned by the Mike Torkelson-John Kromer ticket. "Just about any other university in the country has a social life," said Torkelson, "not just on campus, but off." 
Scheuermann, a resident of Stowe, Vt., has worked at The Observer since his freshman year. He has served as a sports writer, sports copy editor, assistant sports editor and payroll clerk. 
"I would like to continue to im­prove the financial recording and reporting practices of The Observer. I hope to run the business department in an effi­cient manner, striving to give the students the best newspaper at the lowest cost," Scheuermann said. 
Becker and Scheuermann will assume their new positions April 2, 1986. 
"We want to spend our time rebuilding student life instead of student government," he con­tinued. In their "quest to return stu­dent government to students," Torkelson said he and Kromer are fasting ''to show our solidarity with the student body.'' 
"Our first priority is to place every man from The Big Red in the Office of Student Affairs. People, ask not what can I do for Notre Dame, ask yourself, what can I do for Dillon Hall?" said the John and Patrick Walsh ticket. 
Of their relationship with the ad­ministration, they said, "it will not be physical, it will be purely platonic.'' 
Student body elections will take place Tuesday in each of the dorms and LaFortune Student Center.

Sculptors of imagination 
Sophomore Literary Festival brings eight authors to campus 

MARYJACOBY 
assistantfeatures editor 
A Urising campus authors watch 
out, because the Sophomore 
Uterary Fesitval begins Saturday 
with a chance to hear and meet 
eight established literary figures in a 
week-long series oflectures and 
workshops. 
The festival opens with an ap· 
pearance by modern poet Alan 
Ginsberg, whose writing was a 
direct inspiration for the Beat 
literary movement in the '40s. "Allen 
Ginsberg is probably the most 
well-known ofall the speakers this 
year," Ann Peters, fesitval chairman, 
said. Peters said also that Ginsberg's 
appearance Saturday would be his 
third at Notre Dame. 
Ginsberg first became known in 1945 with the publication of"Howl and Other Poems," a long-line poem styled in the manner ofWalt Whitman which became an em­bodiment ofthe Beat movement. The Beats, more popularly known as the Beatniks, were a group of poets and novelists such as jack Kerouac, author of"On the Road," who wrote in the language ofthe streets about previously unmen· tionable topics. Poets Gregory Corso, Michael McClure and Gary Synder were other prominent mem­bers ofthe movement. 
Ginsberg, who has worked as a book reviewer, a market researcher and since 1971 as the director of the Committee on Poetry Founda­tion, was born in Newark, New Jersey. He received his bachelor of arts degree from Columbia Univer· sity in 1948. Among the awards Ginsberg has received are the Gug­genheim Fellowship in 1965 and the National Book Award in 1974. 
Other Ginsberg publications include "Kaddish and Other Poems," "Mostly Sitting Haiku" and "Plutonium Ode and Other Poems." His most recent work is the 1985 publication, "Scenes Along the Road." 
Appearing Sunday is N. Scott Momaday, whose first novel, "House Made of Dawn," won a Pulitzer Prize in 1969 while Momaday was a professor ofEnglish and comparative literature at the University ofCalifornia, Berkely. 

Born in Lawton, Okla. ofa Kiowa father and a French and Cherokee mother, Momaday grew up with a keen sense ofheritage. He com· pleted undergraduate studies at the University ofNew Mexico in 1958, receiving his master ofarts degree from Stanford University in 1960 and a Ph.D. from Stanford in 1963. 
Momaday is also the author of "'Ibe Gourd Dancer" and "The Way to Rainy Mountain." 
Allen Ginsberg 
Poet Alan Dugan, a current staff member for the Poetry and Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown, Mass., will speak Monday. Dugan's first anthology, "Poems," was published in 1961, garnering both a National Book Award and a Pulitzer Prize. Many of Dugan's other poems, which frequently deal with topics ofeveryday American life, have been published in magazines such as The New Yorker, Atlantic and Harper's Magazine. 
Mary Oliver, poet in residence at Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Penn., will appear Tuesday instead ofthe previously scheduled Mon­day in order to fill a slot left open by fiction writer Kay Boyle, who can­not attend tho.: festival because of illness. 

Oliver was born in Maple Heights, Ohio, in 1935. She worked for some time as a secretary to the sister ofpoet Edna St. Vincent Mil· lay. In 1972 she served as chairman ofthe writing department at the Fine Arts Work Center, the same organization with which Dugan is currently associated. 
Oliver received the American Academy Award in 1983 and a Pulitzer Prize for her book of poetry, "American Primitive," in 
Alan Dugan 
1984. Other works by Oliver in· 
elude "No Voyage and Other 
Poems" and "Twelve Moons." 
Two authors, Ronald Sukenick and Lore Segal, will present a joint presentation Wednesday. A native ofBrooklyn, N.Y., Sukenick is a novelist, critic and short story writer who uses irregular line spacing and other unorthodox techniques to suggest physical detail as well as more complex ideas. 
Sukenick received a bachelor of arts degree from Cornell University and his Ph.D. from Brandeis Univer· ~ity, teaching for some time at City College and Sarah Lawrence in New York. He has received a Fullbright 
Fellowship in 1948 and a Guggen· 
heim Fellowship in 1976. Some of 
his most popular works include 
"Up," "Out," "98.6," "Long Talking 
Bad Conditions Blues" and "The 
Death of the Novel and Other 
Stories." 
Sukenick is presently an English professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder. 
Segal, a writer ofprose, poetry and children's literature, was born in Vienna, Austria, in 1928. She holds a bachelor ofarts degree from Bedford College, University of London. Segal has taught at at Columbia, Princeton University and Sarah Lawrence. At present Segal is a professor of English at the Univer· sity ofIllinois at Chicago Circle. 
Among the awards Segal has received are the Guggenheim Fel· low.ship in creative writing in 1965 and the American Ubrary Nouble Book Award in 1970. Her main publications include "Tell Me a Trudy," "Other Peoples' Houses," "All the Way Home" and "Lucinella." Segal has also con· tributed stories and poems to such magazines as The New York Times Book Review, New Republic, Atlan· tlc and Hudson Review. 
Native Hoosier Clayton Eshleman will be the featured speaker Friday. Now living in Los Angeles, Esh· Ieman is the current editor ofSulfur magazine, which is published by the University ofCalifornia at Los An· geles Extensive Writer's Program. 
Eshleman received a bachelor of art.'\ in philosophy and a master of arts in English from Indiana liniver· sity in Bloomington. A recipient of the Guggenheim Fellowship in poetry in 1978 and the National Book Award in translation in 1979, Eshleman has published the original works "Fracture" and "Hades in Manganese." 
The festival's closing speaker is Robert Cormier, a native of Leominster, Mass .. who has worked as both a reponer and free-lance writer in addition to his occupation as a novelist. 
Cormier won the American Library Association Award for hnoks for young adults in 1974 and is characterized by many critics as an author whose best work is directed toward young adults. Cormier's novels include "The Chocolate War," "I Am the Cheese," "After the First Death" and "Beyond the Chocolate War." 
Among other awards Cormier has won are the top prize for news writing for the Associated Press in New England and The New York Times' Outstanding Book ofthe Year Award in 1974, 1977 and 1979. 
This year's guests were chosen by fesitval committee members, each ofwhom made suggestions and considered suggestions from faculty advisors Connie Mahre andJohn Matthias. Among the authors con·

Last night in Washington Hall Director Mark Pilkinton presented his rendition of Shakespeare's "The Tempest." Above the title should have been placed the phrase "Based Loosely Upon." 
One should not alter Shakespeare to this degree. Does one add a few more brushstrokes to the "Mona Lisa?" Attach arms to the "Venus de Milo?" Add a few more curves to Marilyn Monroe?" No.To bor­row a phrase: "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." 
As written, "The Tempest" ex­plores the thoughts and actions of a group of castaways There are three main subplots, all of which are con­trolled by Prospero, the exiled Duke of Milan. He is a very wise man, who through devotion to knowledge has harnessed the forces of nature. Last night, he seemed more of a weak, ranting despot. 

The first major subplot concerns a pair of lovers, Miranda and Fer­dinand. She is the daughter of Pro­spero, and has been raised on the island; he is the son of the king of Naples. Last night their romance suffered from over-direction. 
On stage --tl\li 
The Tempest _---~ 
' 

The second subplot deals with the plotting of two lords to seize control of power. The third subplot mimics the tragic action of the se­cond, substituting a fool and drunken butler for the devious lords. These suffered from miscasting and extraneous cheap l;mghs that were added by the director. 
In Shakespeare, it is the language of the play that captivates and car­ries the audience. In this produc­tion, that language was ignored, implying that audience was too ig­norant to appreciate it. Instead be­ing allowed to present itself, the play was contorted into a melange of differing styles that all oppose each other. 
Even the first scene, a storm at sea, appears to be more of a Felliniesque nightmare. At times I was unsure as to whether I was wat­ching "Godspell," "Brigadoon," or "The Gong Show." Variations of style can be done with Shakespeare. the film "Forbidden Planet" and director Peter Brooks have demonstrated this. However, this production proved more of a sideshow than "The Tempest."

Vote for divestment 

The battle lines are drawn. 
The Notre Dame administration is sticking by its conviction that getting rid 
of University investments in companies that do business in South Africa will 
hurt more than help that blacks that are victims of the oppressive apartheid 
policies of that country's government. 
The Anti-Apartheid Network, among others, continues to call for Notre 
Dame to live up to its moral commitment as one of the leading voices in 
Catholic America by divesting. 
Tuesday, the question goes to the students. On the ballot next week, along 
side the student body president and class officers election, will be a referendum 
on whether the University should or should not divest its South African in­
vestments. 
Students are being asked their opinion on this complicated issue. Is it better 
for the University to continue holding investments in South African companies 
in order that effective social change can be made from the inside, as Father 
Theodore Hesburgh, University president, contends? Or would it be better to 
make a statement against the racist policies of that country by getting out? 
Not an easy question. 
The Observer believes the constructive engagement policy embraced by 
Notre Dame's South African investments policy does not work. Contrary to 
what Hesburgh and the Board of Trustees claim, it is not helping the welfare 
of the black workers in that country. Indeed, it is adding to an unjust system 
based on the theory of racial superiority. 
Last fall, the Anti-Apartheid Network called for the University to divest if the South African government had not taken steps to end the apartheid system by Feb. 1, 1986. That deadline has passed. With it perished the hopes of millions of oppressed blacks, as did an opportunity for the University to live up to its Christian commitment. It's no longer a moral issue. It's a travesty. 
Students should support the divestment referendum. If the Unversity's students call for divestment, the University will have to listen. Universities and colleges across the country will listen, as will state legislatures, city govern­ments and private businesses. The world will know that the students of the most visible Catholic university in the United States want social justice. 
Vote yes to divest. 
-The Observer 

Dear Editor: 
In the past day I have "een asked by many people who I support in the current election. Many are correct that I have strong feelings about the election, but I must add that I do not endorse any particular candidate. My feelings are strong in the sense th;l.t I want it to be a fair election, and that I want the best person to win. As well, I would like to see the students take it very seriously. There.js quite a range of candidates, and very different op­tions as to the direction student government will take. Many of the candidates would make an excellent leader, but all are very dif­ferent. 
While the posters on the walls and the platforms may make the candidates seem very similar, there is a great opportunity for the students to view each candidate as an in­dividual and to see what type of person they are: On Sunday, March 2 at 6 p.m. the can­didates will participate in a campus-wide debate in the library auditorium. I encourage

all students to attend and ask the candidates tough questions. The type of leadership chosen can make a very real difference at Notre Dame and you can as well by forcing the best candidate to the top of the pile. 
This election is not just one for those who have chosen to seek office, but for you, the typical student. The student body president represents the students in the Campus Life Council, to the administration and to the Board of Trustees. These avenues of student input are serious and you should be serious about who you send. Take the time to find out about all the candidates and then make the choice for the best person. It will be then that you can personally say: I put that person there, and he answers to me. 
For all the seniors, don't forget to vote. For the candidates, good luck. And for everyone," remember the debate Sunday.

Wrestling team travels to Missouri to compete in Western Regionals 
By ED JORDANICH 
Sports Writer· 
The Notre Dame wrestling team is in Springfield, Mo., today and tomorrow for the NCAA Western Regionals. The 17-school tourna­ment will determine the individuals who will advance to the NCAA Championships in Iowa City, Iowa March 13-15. 
According to Irish coach Fran McCann, this year's field should favor his wrestlers in the historical­ly strong regional. 
"This can probably be considered an off year in our regional," says McCann. "A lot of superstars from last year are gone, but there are many solid teams with good peo­ple. Northern Iowa is a top-10 team, and Indiana State will be there as well. We like to think we fit in somewhere among the first four or five." 
Irish wrestlers with the best chance of advancing appear to be the same five with the best overall records during the season. Dave Carlin, Jerry Durso, Pat Boyd, Chris Geneser, and John Krug have led McCann's squad all year and are hoping to extend their seasons with finishes in the top three of their individual classes. 
How they fare will depend a great deal upon whether or not they are seeded. Designation as one of the top four competitors in each weight class can make early-round matches easier and serve as definite confidence builders. McCann knows how important this can be for his young team, especially the freshmen. 
"Seeding will certainly be a crucial factor," he says. "Our young people will be nervous and hopefully they won't all be thrown to the dogs right away. We've handled pressure well most of the year and everyone is enthusiastic and ready to wrestle. 
"We wrestled pretty well last weekend and we're in the best shape of the season both mentally and physically. Our program is geared to face tough teams during the season and to try to get people into the NCAA finals. I'm very pleased with what we have accomplished so far. Now we can see our hard work and sacrifice pay off." 
Durso's 36-5 record is tops for the Irish and the freshman should be in the 134-pound regional final Saturday afternoon. Two other freshman, Boyd (19-18-1 at 142 pounds) and Geneser (27-11 at 167 pounds), also figure to do well, considering their records against common opponents of probable foes in Springfield. 
The Irish lineup this weekend will be the same as it has been the last month of the season. That in­cludes 118-pound Carl Hildinger (16-10), 126-pound Carlin (16-8), !50-pound Ron Wisniewski (10­10), !58-pound Dan Carrigan (12­11), 167-pound and heavyweight Spero Karas (9-12). 

Women's inter hall begins playoffs 
By KATHLEEN McKERNAN 
Sports Writer 
As the women's interhall basket­ball season winds down, Breen­Phillips, Walsh, Farley and Lewis "A" each have clinched a spot in the playoffs. 
With only one game to go, Breen-Phillips boasts a perfect 9-0 record. Hapless 2-7 Lyons will have a chance to blemish Breen-Phillips' season when they play in a mean­ingless game Sunday. 
Lyons last played Wednesday against Badin. Badin came out on top, 39-29. At the half, however, Lyons only trailed by one. Captain Maureen Connolly attributres Badin's second-half domination to

some strong defense and halftime inspiration. 
"It was a close game," Connolly said. "That is, it was close until Clare Cschwind delivered her in­spiring halftime speech: 'Let's blow 
. 'em out.' Then it was over." In the only other game Wednes­day, Farley beat Pasquerilla West, 54-33. Farley's superiority became evident by the end of the first quarter, in which they outscored Farley, 14-2. In the losing effort, Kathy Dolan led PW with nine points, while cap­tain Anne Hentzen ended up with eight. For Farley, sophomore Jane Weldon led all scorers with 21 points. Joy Smith and Janet 
Shander also contributed to the blowout with eight and six points, respectively. 
On Sunday, in addition to the Lyons-BP matchup, Lewis "B" will take on PW in a game that will have no effect on the playoff pic­ture. Walsh and Farley will also play in a preview of the first-round game between the second and third­place teams. At this point, Walsh stands at 8-1, while Farley sports a 7-2 mark. Regardless of who wins, they'll play again this Wednesday for a shot at the championship. Lewis "A" will also challenge Breen-Phillips, the team to beat this year in women's interhall, in the league's semi-finals.

MBA student leads by example 
Reilly finds success at Notre Datne 

By KEVIN HERBERT 
Sports Writer 

"Without a doubt, Tim Reilly is a real fine success story. In my seven­teen years here, his story ranks in the top two or three," comments Notre Dame hockey coach Charles 'Lefty' Smith. 
Reilly is a 5-10 right winger from Melrose, Mass. He is currently enrolled in the concentrated MBA program here at Notre Dame. 
"The low point of my years here was the day the official announce­ment was made that hockey would be a club," says Reilly. 
The club year did not take any of his eligibility, so Reilly has been eligible to play hockey for Notre Dame as a graduate student. 
However, he has had to pay for this year out of his own pocket, as his hockey scholarship expired at the end of his senior year. 
"When Reilly was a freshman, all he wanted to do was play hockey, and not much else," says Smith. "He had to be disciplined and with each year he has matured both on the ice and in the classroom. He has handled new pressures extremely well. 
"He is a great competitor and a very effective leader by example. Notre Dame and its environment have been a real asset to him. 
"The team has leaned on him for experience and leadership in dif­ficult situations," continues Smith. "He possesses excellent qualities. The way he has been able to over­come a 'bad wheel' and other adver­sities is very admirable." 
Last season, Reilly was the se­cond leading scorer for the Irish as he notched 22 goals and 39 assists for 61 points in 28 games. 
"The high point of my Notre Dame hockey career was the winn­ing of the Great Lakes Tournament my freshman year," says Reilly. 
"I am glad that I could play this year. This season, for the first time, we made some trips east. This has given me the opportunity to play in from of some of my hometown friends. 
"Hockey has helped me to adjust to the tougher curriculum here in the MBA program," he continues. "However, it has been difficult for me to keep hockey in the same perspective as before because the classes are so much tougher." 
Reilly looks back on his years at Notre Dame in a positive light. 
"My goals as an incoming freshman were to get a degree and to improve my hockey game to the point where I would have an oppor­tunity to move on to the pros," he says. 
"Now, with it almost behind me, I am very happy not only to have received a degree, but to have gone one step further with the MBA. 
"Hockeywise, there still is some room for improvement. All in all, however, I am happy with what I have and am grateful to the school for what it has given me," said Reil­ly. 
Track team returns home for meet 
Special to Tbe Observer 

The Notre Dame track team returns home this weekend after a three-week hiatus, closing the home portion of its 1986 schedule with a three-way meet against DePaul and Marquette tomorrow at 1 p.m. in theACC. 
"We should do well," says Irish head coach Joe Piane. "This meet will give us an opportunity to run some people in some different events and it will give some guys an opportunity for some wins. 
"They're (DePaul and Mar­quette) going to have some good distance runners. But we should do well, and we'll be fine in the long and triple jumps." 
One member of the Marquette squad who is familiar to Notre Dame, Keith Hanson, may not be a part of the strong corps of distance runners. Piane feels that last fall's national Catholic champion may have the weekend off to prepare for the upcoming IC4A and NCAA championships. 
"Marquette will have some of their other top people here though," says Piane. "They have a hurdler named Pat Weas and a sprinter, Tony Robinson, who will run well." 
Notre Dame's outstanding two­mile relay team will compete after qualifying for the NCAA cham­pionships last Saturday in a meet at Boston University. The team, con­sisting of John McNelis, Jeff Van Wie, Robert Nobles and Jim Tyler, clocked in at 7:24:84. 
"To the best of my knowledge," says Piane, "that is the best time in the nation."

says Kelly. "Of course, there are

Some of these fighters to keep are veterans of last years bouts and would like nothing better than to avoid losses this time around. The 135-pound division features a former champion, Anthony Bon­naci, and a semi-finalist from last year, Edward "Fast Eddie" Bornemann, while the 145-pound division contains a Novice cham­pion, Pat "Joe Man" Loughran and another semi-finalist from last year, Thomas "Thunder ami Lightning" Newell.

With the number and quality of the fighters this year, both in the ring and in fundraising, the Bengals this year could prove to be the most successful to date.

Fencers strive to remain unbeaten at Great Lakes Championships 
By FRANK HUEMMER 
Sports Writer 
When the Irish men's and women's fencing teams travel to Appleton, Wis., this weekend for the Great Lakes Championships, it will mark another step in Notre Dame's quest for a national cham­pionship. Both teams currently stand undefeated as the men have compiled a 26-0 record and the women a perfect 23-0 mark. 
The Great Lakes Championships are a regional championship that originated in 1967 and is used to seed teams in the NCAAs. It places all the schools not affiliated with the Big Ten in direct competition. 
Teams from Tri-State, Eastern Michigan, Michigan-Dearborn, University of Detroit, University of Chicago, Lawrence University, Carnegie Mellon, California of Pennsylvania, Case-Western Reserve, and Cleveland State will all be on hand tomorrow. However, none of these teams is ex­pected to present quite as much of a challenge as Wayne State. 
"We should be favored to win the Great Lakes Championships besed on our won-loss record against common opponents," says Notre Dame men's coach Mike DeCicco. "However, Wayne State will be tough because our top three fencers in each weapon match up very closely to their fencers." 
The qualifiers from Saturday's Great Lakes will compete Sunday in the Midwest Qualifier. Only two members from each team in the three weapons are allowed to enter the Midwest Tournament. Further­more, five Big Ten schools, Wisconsin, Illinois, Northwestern, Michigan State, and Ohio State also send their fencers to this qualifier. All these fencers will compete, with the top eight epees, seven foilists, and six sabres advan­cing to the NCAA competition. 
The men's fencing team sends nine fencers, three in each weapon, to compete in the Championships. 
In the foil competition seniors Mike Van der Velden and Charles Higgs-Coulthard and sophomore Yehuda Kovacs should provide the Irish team with a great deal of strength. In the sabre the Irish will go with' the experience of seniors Tony Consoli, Don Johnson, and John Edwards. DeCicco thinks the contribution of the seniors has been a major reason for this year's suc­cess. 
"We are fortunate to have pro­bably the finest senior group of fencers since 1945," he says. "We have never had seniors contribute so much to our team effort. The 20 seniors work extremely well together and are a real close knit bunch of guys." 
In epee, seniors Mike Gostigian, Christian Sherpe and junior John Haugh will compete. 
"In order to have a chance at winning the NCAA's we must come out of the Midwest Qualifier with the maximum of qualifiers," says DeCicco. "Therefore, we must qualify six people, two in each weapon, and if that happens we have a good shot at winning the NCAA's." 
The women's team, under head coach Yves Auriol, will also be at­tempting to maintain its unblemish­ed record in Saturday's Great Lakes and Midwest Qualifier. 
The five women competing in the Great Lakes will be the team's talented sophomore leader, Molly Sullivan, along with senior Janet Sullivan, junior Vittoria Quaroni and Cindy Weeks, and freshman Janice Hynes. 
"It is the women themselves that have done it this season," says DeCicco. "The addition of Janice Hynes to the veteran team, along with having Yves Auriol as the full time women's coach has elevated this team to a solid unit. These girls are so together now that they are believing in their ability as a team and are really training hard. 
"The women might be a year away (from making the NCAA's because of experience. However, the way they are rolling toward it with two good weeks of training and polishing up their game, they could make a run at it." 
The possibility of an NCAA championship in both men's and women's fencing still exists and the action this weekend will be an im­portant step in accomplishing this feat. 


Grace 
continuedfrom page 12 
Takach tallied an unbelievable 29 points in the contest and was the key player in the second half for Grace. 
Alumni took an early six-point lead in the first quarter and was able to hold onto the lead until the fourth period. Steve Deem scored seven points for the Dogs, and Ken Scheurmann added 12. 
Suddenly, things started to fall apart for Alumni, as they suffered a nightmarish fourth quarter that 
found them outscored by nine points. 
"Throughout the game, both teams were shooting well," com­mented Grace coach Paul Dewent. "In the fourth quarter, the same shots that went in before weren't dropping for Alumni, and we started doing a little better with defensive rebounding. We weren't getting hurt by second-chance shots like we were earlier." 
The winner of the game on Sun­day will automatically go to the championship game against Sorin. Since Sorin is undefeated in the playoffs, the winner of this game must beat the Otters twice to claim the title. 

Campbell Boycott Ends Nationally Campbell and FLOCSign Contracts; Dunlop Commission suspends boycoHactivity 
The Campbell Soup Company is pleased to report that the eight-year boycott of Campbell Soup products by the Farm 
Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC), of which Notre Dame has been a part, is over. 
It ended February 19 when FLOC, the Tomato Growers Association and Campbell signed contracts which were the result of union bargaining between the FLOC and Ohio tomato farmers who sell to Campbell. Additionally, collective bargain­ing agreements have been signed by cucumber farmers, FLOC and Vlasic Foods, a Campbell subsidiary. 
Because of these contracts, the Dunlop Commission, the impartial 5-member body set up by the National Council of Churches to In May of 1985, Campbell and FLOC signed an understanding which paved the way for binding elections on tomato forms selling to Campbell. This gave the migrants the right to elect union representation if they so chose. 
Since the early 1950's the Campbell Soup Company has had a formal policy of endorsing and supporting organizations and agencies whose focus was to provide better working and living conditions for minorities and women in this country. 
In keeping with that policy, Campbell Soup developed a strong program of social justice for migrants, which it has expanded over the past five years. That program has included free day care for migrant farmworkers' children, health care insurance,

pearance at the ACC. 
The Irish co-captains have both had outstanding careers during their four years at Notre Dame. An all-American candidate, Keys has rewritten much of the Irish record book during her four years. Ebben has been a dependable performer for the Irish, providing both out­side shooting and leadership. 
Keys sat out the Butler win on Wednesday with a rotator cuff pro­blem but is expected to return to the lineup tonight for her home finale. Notre Dame has been on a roll of· late, winning 10 of its last 11 games, including the last six in a row. The Irish are getting ready for a rematch with Dayton, the only North Star Conference member to defeat them, and possible postseason play. 
But like any good coach, Notre Dame's Mary DiStanislao is only concerned about the game at hand. DiStanislao is wary of her players looking ahead to Dayton and suf-

Evansville will come at us hard and we're going to have to play for 40 minutes." 
Indeed, Evansville would like nothing better than to knock off the more talented Notre Dame squad. Coach Bill Barnett's Purple Aces have struggled to a 6-18 record, so a win against the Irish would make their season. 
Evansville will be counting on junior forward Gretchen Eisenhauer, who averages 14.4 points and 3.1 rebounds per game. Joining her on the frontline are sophomore forward Karla Hughes 
(9.4 ppg , 6.2 rpg) and junior center Kathy Sloan (9.0 ppg , 6.2 rpg). At the guards are senior Barb Dykstra (9.4 ppg , 5.I rpg ) and freshman Angie McGrew (7.1 ppg , 
2.6 rpg ). 
The Purple Aces have a big task in front of them if they are to upset the Irish. In an earlier meeting this season at Evansville, Notre Dame won easily, 76-55, with Keys and Ebben leading the way, scoring 18 and 17 points, respectively.

Hurting but determined, Lefty Smith's Notre Dame hockey team takes the ice for two games with the Bisons of North Dakota State this weekend at the ACC hockey rink. 
The games, Friday and Saturday at 7:30 p.m., will be the last home games of the year. Head Coach Smith is hoping that the Irish, and especial­ly the seniors, can close out the 1985-86 season with a pair of wins. 
"These seniors deserve a lot of credit and respect," said Smith, in his 18th year with the Irish. "When they were coming up, we were a top CCHA (Central Collegiate Hockey Association) team, then we struggled and became a club team, and now we've regained varsity status and are building to become and outstanding hockey program. They've run the gamut, and have conducted themselves in a fine manner way through it all. I'm proud of them." 
Last weekend's series against Northern Arizona proved costly not only in the win-loss column, but key members of the squad were knocked out of ac­tion as well. Smith is heartened that at least a few will be back this weekend. 
"I hope we can fall back on the idea that when you're hurt, you push a little harder," added Smith. "The guys who play are going to have to go at it 110 percent for us to be effective. We think that (grad student) Brent Chapman, (sophomore) Mark Anquillare, and (senior co-captain) Bob Thebeau will be back from last weekend's injuries and will be ready to contribute for us." 
North Dakota State was 24-10 last year and Smith realizes that the Bisons won't roll over for the Irish in the last two home games of the year. 
"It should be an entertaining and competitive series," commented Smith. "Looking at who they've played and beaten in the last two years, I'd say we'll be dealing with a fine team. They've really decided to build their hockey program."
