Bush tackles national security at South Bend 

By KATE NAGENGAST 
News Writer 
SOUTH BEND 
President George W. Bush said his 
administration would make the 
United States a "safer, stronger and 
better nation" in his speech Thursday 
at the South Bend Regional Airport. 
Visiting South Bend on a two-day, $1 million tour to promote Republican House candidates, includ­ing Chris Chocola of Indiana's 2nd Congressional District, Bush spoke to a crowd of about 5,000 about the nation's economic, military and spiri­tual resilience. 
"I've come to talk about the prob­lems we face as a nation of great character," said Bush before delin­eating economic security, new energy sources and the war on terrorism as issues currently plaguing the United States. 
"The money we spend in Washington is not the government's money, it's your money," Bush told the crowd battling heat in the airport hanger. 
Bush pushed his $1.35 trillion, 10­year tax cut as the primary solution to recession. 
"For the sake of people who want to find work ... tax relief is important for job creation," the President said. 
Bush mentioned corporate reform, mitigation of the marriage tax and extinction of the death tax as promis­ing plans for economic reform. 
The President also used his speech to push U.S. lawmakers to approve a broad energy bill that he said would be "good for job security, national security and encourage conserva­tion." 
"We must do everything we can to become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil," Bush said. 
The President's highest priority, 
however, remains national security, 
and he acknowledged that the tech­
niques of war have changed since the 
days when "you could count tanks 
and determine the strength of an 
army." · 
"My biggest job is to protect you 
and your families and secure the 
homeland," Bush told a crowd he had 
previously noted as being full of fam­
ilies with children. 
The President's rhetoric consistent­
ly referred to children's understand­
ing of America's enemies. 
"I think there is still an enemy out there that hates us," Bush said. "You need to tell your kids that these [ene­mies] hate America because of what we love. We love freedom. 
"We hold freedoms dear and we're willing to defend them. . . . This also distinguishes us from the enemy because we value the worth of each life, everybody matters. That's not the way the enemy thinks. They've got their desires and dark, dark ambitions. But now they've got a mighty nation that stands between them and their ambitions." 
Bush went on to describe the neces­sity of a new Department of Homeland Security that would pro­vide the President with flexibility needed to protect the American pub­lic. 
"The Executive needs the capacity to move people to the right place at the right time," Bush said. "But the bill micromanages.... Some senators are more concerned about special interests than safety." 
"I will not accept a lousy bill, I will insist that Congress get it right," he added.

Transfer students out in the cold 
. No guaranteed housing for transfers leaves some wait-listed

Despite opening study lounges again this year for freshman, 20 Notre Dame transfer student<; still remain in off-campus housing and on residence hall waiting listc;, according to Scott Kachmarik, associate director of residence life. 
The University does not guaran­tee on-campus housing to incom­ing transfers, so students on the lower end of the wait list often rent a sleeping room or apart­ment on a weekly or monthly basis until a room on campus becomes available. Students are informed of this policy in their

2002 Shirt and towel gear ready for 
By CALLIE WHELAN and 
CLAIRE HEININGER 
News Writers 
Sung at the closure ofeach home football game, Notre Dame's Alma Mater states, "Notre Dame, Our Mother/I'ender, strong and true/Proudly in the heavens/Gleams the Gold and Blue." Clearly, blue and gold are synonymous with Notre Dame's long-standing tradition. However, these two familiar colors are not the only option for students, facul­ty, staff, alumni and fans to show­case their spirit. A new color, kelly green, is rapidly making a name of its own among the Irish faithful, including the 2002 version of The Shirt. 
Each year, the design for The Shirt is carefully selected from entries in a contest open to all Notre Dame students. Sophomore Carl Elkins submitted the winning design for this year's shirt, which features a realistically dented, game-worn golden helmet raised triumphantly in a player's fist. The image of the helmet is joined by the words "Heturn To Glory, Notre Dame Football 2002," as well as the famous Knute Rockne quote, "We're gonna go, go, go, go! And we aren't going to stop until we go over that goal line! And don't for­get, men -today's the day we're gonna win! Go in there and fight, fight, fight ... " The Shirt's finishing touches include the shadowy fig­ures of Rockne and the Four Horsemen in the background. 
After Elkins' initial design was chosen, he worked alongside Shirt Committee President Courtney Schuster to refine and improve the finished product. Shuster describes the process as "working with him to perfect the design and to incorporate a few more things." Among her additions was the Rockne quote, which she says was important because it "ties together the generations. It was in Rudy, so it is very recognizable and popu­lar." 
The idea of linking past and present is central to the "Return to Glory" theme. Schuster explains the significance of placing the hel­met in the foreground, saying. "We remember our predecessors and traditions in the background, but it's important that we're in the

Living in a fantasy world 
Last night was a special one for many guys across the country. No, the scram­bled porn channel on their televisions didn't right itself. Sadly, model Brooke Burke didn't stop by their houses to greet them. The University didn't leave complemen­tary kegs outside their dorms either. What happened was the beginning of an event that will captivate guys from September to January. Fantasy football. 
When the San Francisco 49ers and the New York Giants kicked off the NFL season last night, the hopes and dreams of thou­sands of fantasy fans across the coun­try kicked off as well. The preparation of pre-rankings players, reading about injuries and holdouts, drafting a team, cutting players, picking up players off of waivers and trading all makes up the elements that help build a solid fantasy team. 
For the next 17 weeks, fantasy play­ers will sacrifice work, studying, prac­tice, communicating with their peers and sometimes, when it gets close to playoff time, eating and sleeping. On Mondays, friends will gather at the din­ner table and discuss the important issues in life, such as what the United States should do about terrorists or, more importantly, whether to start Denver's Orlandis Gary or rookie Clinton Portis at running back for the upcoming week. 
Fantasy also unities enemies. I'm a huge Cleveland Browns fan, but if I had drafted, let's say, Pittsburgh Steeler running back Jerome Bettis (which I didn't. by the way), I'd be rooting for him to score as much as possible even though I hate the Steelers with a pas­sion. Scenarios like this demonstrate the kind ofimpact fantasy football can have on people's lives. 
Without fantasy, I would only watch and root for the Browns on Sunday's. But with it in my life, I can now turn on almost any game and have some inter­est in what's happening. Did Oakland's Rich Gannon throw a touchdown? Why in the heck didn't I start Chicago's Dez White at wide receiver? Questions like these haunt fantasy players minds throughout the season. Trading some­one now could be costly if that player ends up having a good season. 
Fantasy football is not for the faint of heart, to say the least. Finally, the exciting thing about fantasy football is that it lets guys that may not have the skill. size, desire, determination, strength and quickness to play football an opportunity to still be apart of a great sport. Fantasy gives guys some­thing to look forward to on Sundays, something to work towards during the week and something to give them an excuse not to do homework on the weekends. 
So to all those fantasy football play­ers reading this, I wish you the best of luck this season.

Bush remarks spark student response 

By MATI BRAMANTI 
News Writer 
President George W. Bush's remarks at South Bend Regional Airport on Thursday were met with raucous applause from Republican supporters filling the hangar. Student responses, however, were more mixed. 
"It was a good speech, but I'm still concerned he might attack Iraq prematurely," Notre Dame junior Erin Lagor said. 
Among the president's supporters was junior Ben Gilfillan, who said he was impressed with Bush's speech. "The president's leadership in the past year has been amazing," Gilfillan said. 
Campus political groups also weighed in with their opinions on Bush's address, which touched on the cur­rent economic recovery, cor­porate reforms, and the administration's case for a regime change in Iraq. 
Bush's presence Thursday night at a South Bend fundraising dinner for GOP congressional candidate Chris Chocola drew com­ment from the opposite end of the political spectrum. 
"Money is important, but the election will come down to the issues," said Notre Dame College Democrats President Erin LaRuffa, referring to the $250-per­plate dinner fee. Her organi­zation is "clearly behind Jill Long Thompson because of her support for student loans and job creation," LaRuffa added. 
College Republican leaders could not be reached for comment because they were attending the dinner. 
A few politically neutral students, like Saint Mary's freshman Jennifer Parker, lined up against the back­drop of Air Force One's gleaming presence in order to witness Bush's arrival. 
"We just came to see the President," Parker said.

Saint Mary's appoints new director for diversity leadership center 

Sarkees accepted a new position as the director of the Center for Women's lntercultural Leadership at Saint Mary's.

forefront -the focus is on who we are today, now, in the pre­sent." 
Another improvement to this year's Shirt was the production of 6,000 medium sizes, in addi­tion to the usual 38,000 extra­larges, all of which were pro­duced by St. Clair Apparel. The Shirt is available for purchase on campus in the Hammes Notre Dame Bookstore, the two Varsity Shops in the Joyce Center and at the information desk in LaFortune, as well as for online orders. The cost of The Shirt is $15. 
The Shirt has been a tradition in its own right since 1989, when Sister Jean Lenz encouraged stu­dents to purchase them in sup­port of graduate student Zheng de Wang, who had been serious­ly injured in a hit-and-run inci­dent on Notre Dame Avenue. Wang's parents traveled from Tianjin, China to be by his side but realized that the medical expenses for his care were beyond their resources. Sister Lenz responded by collaborating with the Student Union Board and the Hall Presidents Council to create a shirt whose proceeds would benefit the Wang family. 
The student body responded to the fundraiser with widespread support, purchasing over 11,000 shirts in time for the 1990 game against Miami. Total sales of The Shirt reached over $100,000, all of which were donated to Wang's medical costs.This same spirit of support continues to underwrite current Shirt pro­ceeds. Each year, the money raised on sales of The Shirt is used to fund several scholarships and charities (including last year's Bone Marrow Drive), as well as contributing to student government. The fact that The Shirt's purpose goes beyond football unity to include involve­ment in a genuine cause "says so much about our student body," said Schuster. 
She believes that this season's Shirt is just as meaningful, say­ing. "[The students of 1990] pulled together in support of another student. We 're also dearly proclaiming support for one another here at ND." 
The Towel 
This year. in addition to The Shirt, Notre Dame students have another way to show their Irish pride when game day rolls around with the advent of The Game Day Spirit Towel, a.k.a. The Towel. Measuring 11 by 18 inches, this Kelly green towel matches The Shirt exactly and is brought to Notre Dame students by sponsorships through the Notre Dame Bookstore, The Alumni Association, SARG (Student Alumni Relations Group) and adidas. 
Last year's early loss to Nebraska proved that inspiration can come out of bad loss. Two Notre Dame graduate students, Shane Fimbel and Shane Woods, were as inspired by the Nebraska fans as the Husker football team was. Each Nebraska fan waved his or her own red golf-sized towel at opportune moments in the game, creating an oscillating sea of red. 
The duo of Shanes brought the idea back to Notre Dame, where they proposed it to Student Government, who already had their hands full with production of The Shirt. Next, they took it to the Alumni Association, which was more than willing to get the project rolling.Chuck Lennon, president of the Alumni Association, is enthusiastic about the towels, and the role they will play in the stadium this year. 
"We've seen what red and Nebraska can do," he said. "We're going to make it a stadi­um of green" this year. By get­ting rid of the "modest blue and modest gold," the student section of the stadium will be bolder and brighter, said Lennon. 
"The towels will be sold for only $5," Lennon added. "They'll be cheap so more people can have it." The hope is that each student will buy a towel to increase the effect in the stadi­um. Proceeds benefit SARG, who, in turn, will "use funds to increase programs on campus," said Marella Riley, student rep­resentative to SARG. 
The Towel. which reads "Go Irish" in navy blue and includes The Hammes Bookstore, The Alumni Associ.ation and Adidas logos, will be on sale before and during games at The Hammes Bookstore, 19 stadium locations, 14 trailers, at the two Varsity Shops, the Morris Inn and Lafortune Student Center. 
Students will get their first look at the towel at the Friday Pep Rally, where the football team, cheerleaders and marching band will be displaying theirs. 
They were also sold at the Meadowlands game outside of the hotel in New Jersey, but they are "making the big push for Purdue," said Lennon. 
Other than helping sponsor The Towel, adidas, who has sponsored Notre Dame athletics for six years, is taking a back seat in football merchandise this year. In the past, adidas has given students shirts, hats and visors at the beginning of foot­ball season, but it is "shifting the focus towards the basketball season this year," said, Molly Anderson, adidas consultant to Notre Dame. Even with the decreased adidas football mer­chandise, The Shirt and The Towel provide an abundance o'green to promote Irish unity and pride.

transfer application, but the exact situation can vary widely from year to year. Although some students never wanted a place on-campus, 118 of 131 transfers eventually did elect to be placed on the wait list early last sum­mer. 
In a reversal from previous years, transfer men were housed at a much faster pace than women and as a result all 20 stu­dents left off-campus are women. "We were always able to house all women with a waiting list for men," said Kachmarik. "The gen­der breakdown of men to women seems to have changed slightly among the on-campus popula­tion." 
While many transfers are forced to live off-campus, officials have been gradually offering rooms to tran5fer students since the year begun. "We continue to get vacancies and make offers to one or two women at a time," Kachmarik said. 
Though vacancies have opened up slowly, Residence Life expects that all requests for on-campus housing will be filled by next semester. "We should be able to house anyone who wants to live on campus for the spring semes­ter," said Kachmarik. 
Students who foW1d themselves still on the waiting list once class­es began said they felt upset and frustrated about the uncertainty of their living situation. 
"It was pretty nerve-wracking," said sophomore Mary Ann Jentz, who was given a room in Badin Hall last Friday. 
Jentz, originally No. 49 on the wait list, said she did not realize that the shortage would be so high and had expected to be placed on-campus much sooner. "I didn't think it was going to turn out like this," said Jentz. 
Even with the confusion about finding a place on campus, Jentz said her interactions with Residence Life were mostly posi­tive. "They were generally help­ful," she said. ''They tried to give me the truth." 
Sophomore Chrissy Rochelle, who remains off-campus, said she felt alienated from the com­munity atmosphere at the University. "We came to Notre Dame for the family environment and it's hard to get that off-cam­pus," said Rochelle, a transfer from the University of Kansas. Rochelle, now No. 16 on the wait

Merideth Reid Sarkees, Ph.D., the newly appointed director of the Center for Women's Intercultural Leadership, believes Saint Mary's students need to focus on diversity. 
"I hope to encourage students to be open minded toward other cultures and to always be open to new ways of learning,.. Sarkees said. 
Sarkees' previous experience in political science provides an extensive background in gender issues, international relations and woman's studies. 
Her most recent position was political sci­ence faculty member at DePaul University. This knowledge will promote an awareness of diversity both inside and beyond Saint Mary's gates. 
"While at DePaul, I was able to teach a class on global gender issues and I hope to convey some of the lessons learned in that course such as how to grapple women's issues and their roles in international politics that we don't always see," Sarkees said. 
Many discussions and speakers will be brought to campus in order to highlight inter­national women's issues. 
The keynote speaker of the year is former president of Ireland and current United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson. Robinson's recent controversial outspokenness provides an excellent opportunity to discuss international women's diversity issues. 
Sarkees also believes in the importance of looking to Saint Mary's alumnae when exam­ining diversity. She intends to have speakers who will focus on business and culture in the workplace. 
"It is important for memqers of the Saint Mary's community to be aware of broader areas of diversity. These include health issues, politics and even women's involve­ment in peace activities," said Sarkees. 
Sarkees believes that the wealth of experi­ence and information from Saint Mary's alumnae will be able to partially fulfill the need of diversity education.

Though excited about attend­ing Notre Dame, Rochelle said her experience with Residence Life has often been frustrating and upsetting as she felt officials did not provide her with solid options for living off-campus. 
"They don't give us any definite answers," said Rochelle. "They haven't really given us much help." 
Despite 102 percent residence hall capacity, Kachmarik does not expect the situation to change in the near future. "We anticipate remaining at full capacity for the next several years," he said. 
Along with the special sense of community at Notre Dame, Kachmarik credits 2001 's extra­large freshman class and as a factor in the current housing shortage. 
"The incoming class was almost 100 students over the expected number," he said. "That bubble will carry through for the next four years."

Afghan president escapes assasination attempt 
Associated Press 
KANDAHAR 
An assailant dressed in the uniform of the new Afghan army fired on a car carrying President Hamid Karzai on Thursday, hours after an explosives­packed car tore through a crowded Kabul market, killing at least 10 people. 
The violence was the most serious challenge to Karzai's government, which has been struggling to bring order and security to a country wracked by decades of bloodshed. 
Afghan officials were quick to blame Osama bin Laden's al­Qaida network for the violence, which came less than a week before the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. 
"Terrorists are behind both attacks, there is no doubt about it. And terrorists in this region are led by Osama and his associ­ates," said Foreign Minister Abdullah. 
The government offered no immediate evidence of bin Laden's involvement, and others blamed the rising anger of the Pashtun majority toward a gov­ernment controlled by Americans and dominated by rival Tajiks from the north. 
The Bri-tish Broadcasting Corp. said the attacker came from a former Taliban strong­hold. 
President Bush expressed relief that Karzai was safe, and administration officials pledged to keep helping rebuild the country. 
"We're not leaving," Bush said. "We want to help democra­cy flourish in that region." 
The assassination attempt occurred soon after Karzai, who was in his hometown of Kandahar for the wedding of his youngest brother, finished evening prayers at the city's his­toric Khalqa Sharif mosque. 
After the prayers, Karzai and his party were given a tour of the governor's mansion, located across the street from the mosque. Karzai's motorcade was preparing to leave the gov­ernor's compound as hundreds of well-wishers were pressing against the gates to catch a glimpse of the president. 
"We were standing at the gates and saw Karzai wave," said Sardar Mohammed. "Then I saw one guard point a Kalashnikov at Karzai and fire. There was a kid behind him. and he grabbed the gunman from behind." 
Kandahar security chief Dur Mohammed said Karzai's U.S. military bodyguards immediate­ly opened fire, killing the assailant and two others. The presidential motorcade sped off within moments of the attack, while gunsmoke lingered over fied the attacker as Abdul Helmand. an ethnic Pashtun the mansion's grounds.

Senate approves arming airline pilots in the cockpit 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
The Senate voted overwhelmingly Thursday to allow commercial pilots to carry weapons in the cockpit after the Bush administration dropped its opposi­tion to the idea. 
The administration, though, said a number of safety and logistical issues needed to be resolved. 
In a letter to two senators, the White House recommended giving pilots lock­boxes for the weapons so they won't be left in the cockpit. It also said only pilots who volunteer to carry weapons and receive extensive training should be armed. 
Al Aitken, a pilot speaking for the 14,500-member union representing American Airlines pilots, which sup­ports arming pilots, said the 87-6 vote meant the Senate recognized that all the security layers the administration is putting into place are still inadequate. 
"The people who need the weapons as a last line of defense are the pilots,' he said. "They're the only ones they're try­ing to keep the gun from,' he said, adding that thousands of state and fed­eral law enforcement officers travel on planes while armed. 
Until the early 1960s, federal regula­tions required pilots to carry guns when they flew a plane carrying U.S. mail, Aitken said. 
The heads of 21 airlines, which oppose the measure, sent a letter to each senator Thursday saying they wanted to discuss the idea of arming pilots with Congress and the adminis­tration. 
"It must be noted, however, that while we are spending literally billions of dol­lars to keep dangerous weapons off of aircraft, the idea of intentionally intro­ducing thousands of deadly weapons in to the system appears to be dangerously counterproductive,' the letter said. 
To address some of the airlines' con­cerns. the administration suggested a "detailed, effective' training program be designed from scratch and tested before an estimated 85,000 pilots are allowed to carry weapons. 
The administration also warned the cost would be significant -$900 mil­lion to start and $250 million annually thereafter -and said there is no money now in the Transportation Security Administration budget to cover the expenses. 
How long it would take to arm the first pilot is a question that still has to be answered, said Robert Johnson, spokesman for the Transportation Security Administration.

Israel hits back with missile attack: 
Isl-aeli helicopters attacked a suspected bomb factory in the Gaza Strip early Friday, hours after Palestinian fighters blew up an Israeli tank, killed two soldiers and tried to plant a huge car bomb in Israel. The Palestinians launched their assaults Thursday despite heightened Israeli security before the Jewish New Year. The militants called the attacks retaliation for killings of civilians. The attacks broke a monthlong lull in Palestinian strikes.

Gunmen on motorcycles killed the new chief of secret police in a violence ridden Colombian province Thursday as he drove his car in Medellin.

New library dedicated Senate OKs arming airline pilots 
By MARIE FRALISH 
News Writer 
The Mathematics Department dedicated its new mathematics library branch in the lower level of the Hayes-Healy Center Wednesday. The library was previously located in the Computing Center and former math building near the Hesburgh Llbrary. 
Father Theodore Hesburgh opened the ceremony with a blessing and his comments on the new library. "[The library] will bring new knowledge to the benefit of students and to the research of this University," he said. Hesburgh explained how he felt a special connection to the new facility since he had previously worked at the United Nations with one of the library's original main donors. 
Though the library's building stage is completed, other changes will continue to take place. Parker Ludwig, head librarian at the new library. said the new library will work towards two main goals in the next several years. 
..We want to focus on the library collections and services most important to our patrons," he said. 
Ludwig also hoped the new library would strongly con­tribute to the work of students and faculty and play an impor­tant role in mathematics-relat­ed research. 
The library will attempt to receive input from all mathe­matics professors on how it can better serve faculty and stu­dents. Llbrary officials intend to study other universities' mathe­matics libraries in order to improve Notre Dame's library. Ludwig said the library will also look into purchasing some mathematics-related art for the

Bush ended his speech with­in 45 minutes of Air Force One's 1:45 p.m. runway touch­down on a note of seriousness and optimism. 
Bush declared that he would not permit "the world's worst leaders to use the world's worst weapons" against the United States. But he also said he saw "peace by being a strong and forceful nation, and speaking about good and evil." 
The President invoked the Golden Rule twice during his speech and stressed his belief in the United States' ability to care about every citizen indi­vidually.

new facility. 
Also speaking at the dedica­tion were Jennifer Younger, the director of University libraries, and Steven Buechler, the chair of the mathematics department. The ceremony concluded with a reception and demonstrations by the library's staff of some of the facility's new computer research abilities. 
The new library, which has been open since the May of 2001, was first planned when the mathematics department made preparations to move from the Computing Center building to new offices in the Hayes-Healy Center. 
The new library is divided into various sections and fea­tures a large reference desk in the center of the facility. All of the library's journals are locat­ed in one area with books in another. According to Karen Lanser, the library's supervisor, the amount of storage space has been doubled. Some books and journals were added to the col­lection and relevant materials from the Hesburgh Library were also brought to the new library. 
The library also contains five small study lounges that have been used extensively by faculty and undergraduate and gradu­ate students, Ludwig said. 
"We had very little study space in the old building," said Lanser. 
A main improvement from the former library has also been increased technology applica­tions, including the addition of portals for ResNet access with laptops, according to Lanser. Wireless networking is also available anywhere in the library, she said.

fan, be proud that this great university hired a really good man to be it's head coach," Bush said. 
He added that Condoleezza Rice, National Security Advisor and friend to Willingham is "constantly telling me to watch 
out for the Irish."  
Willingham  had  equally  
benevolent  words  for  the  
President.  

"There's no question about his leadership skills and his ability to project our country in the right direction," Willingham said after practice Thursday. "It's always a great opportunity and honor to have the chance to shake the hand of the man that leads this country." 
. Bush specifically acknowl­edged Ricardo Rios, a math and science teacher through the Alliance for Catholic Education program at Notre Dame as an example of putting other above oneself. Rios was also invited to ride in the motorcade with the President.

The Senate voted over­whelmingly Thursday to allow commercial pilots to carry weapons in the cockpit after the Bush administration dropped its opposition to the idea. 
The administration, though, said a number of safety and logistical issues needed to be resolved. 
In a letter to two senators, the White House recommend­ed giving pilots lockboxes for the weapons so they won't be left in the cockpit. It also said only pilots who volunteer to carry weapons and receive extensive training should be armed. 
Al Aitken, a pilot speaking for the 14,500-member union representing American Airlines pilots, which supports arming pilots, said the 87-6 vote meant the Senate recog­nized that all the security lay­ers the administration is putting into place are still inadequate. 
"The people who need the weapons as a last line of defense are the pilots," he said. 
"They're the only ones they're trying to keep the gun from," he said, adding that thousands of state and federal law enforcement officers trav­el on planes while armed. 
Until the early 1960s, feder­al regulations required pilots to carry guns when they flew a plane carrying U.S. mail, Aitken said. 
The heads of 21 airlines, which oppose the measure, sent a letter to each senator Thursday saying they wanted to discuss the idea of arming 
pilots with Congress and the administration. 
"It must be noted, however, that while we are spending lit­erally billions of dollars to keep dangerous weapons off of aircraft, the idea of inten­tionally introducing thousands of deadly weapons in to the system appears to be danger­ously counterproductive," the letter said. 
To address some of the air­lines' concerns, the adminis­tration suggested a "detailed, effective" training program be designed from scratch and tested before an estimated 85,000 pilots are allowed to carry weapons. 
The administration also warned the cost would be sig­n ifi cant -$900 million to start and $250 million annual­ly thereafter -and said there is no money now in the Transportation Security Administration budget to cover the expenses. 
How long it would take to arm the first pilot is a ques­tion that still has to be answered, said Robert Johnson, spokesman for the Transportation Security Administration. 
The letter from TSA chief James Loy was delivered to Senators Ernest Hollings, D­
S.C.. and John McCain, R­Ariz., as the Senate debated the measure that would allow all pilots to carry guns into the cockpit. Hollings is chair­man of the Senate Commerce and Transportation Committee; McCain is the committee's ranking Republican. 
"If there is to be responsible legislation establishing a pro­gram to allow guns in the cockpit, it must address the 
numerous safety. security, cost and operational issues," Loy wrote. 
Sen. Bob Smith, R-N .H., offered the amendment to the homeland security bill that would prohibit airlines and the federal government from barring armed pilots. 
"We prefer a more compre­hensive approach in our amendment, but are grateful for any efforts by the adminis­tration to roll the baLI down the field," said Smith's spokeswoman, Lisa Harrison. 
The chairman of the House Transportation Committee's aviation subcommittee, Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., said pilots should be armed at least until bulletproof cockpit doors are installed in all planes. The Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday that manufacturers and air­lines agree an April 9 dead­line to install the new doors can be met. 
Mica said the administration realized that the momentum in Congress favoring arming pilots is strong. The House passed a bill 310-113 in July to create a program that would train and arm some pilots who volunteer as special deputies. Hollings opposed the measure until it was amended to require that cabin doors be locked throughout the flight, which is the policy of the Israeli airline El Al. 
Transportation Undersecretary John Magaw, who headed the TSA until July, said in May he would not allow pilots to carry guns. Reinforced cockpits and armed air marshals provide enough protection against ter­rorists who try to take over an airplane, Magaw said.

IN BRIEF 
Asian share prices tumble down 
The barometer for Asia's main stock mar­
ket tumbled Friday amid renewed doubts 
about the American economy that are 
almost certain to derail Japan's shaky 
export-dependent recovery. 
The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, the index for the Tokyo Stock Exchange, fell 
204.83 points, or 2.22 percent, to 9,017.29 at the end of morning trading. That was below its Wednesday close of 9,075.09 -its lowest close in 19 years. 
On Thursday, the Nikkei had been encour­aged by the overnight gain on Wall Street, closing up 147 .03 points, or 1.62 percent, at 9,222.12. It had been the first day of gains after seven straight sessions of declines. 
Two Airlines Adopt 'Use Or Lose It' 
Northwest Airlines and Delta Airlines on Thursday followed their biggest rivals by adopting a "use it or lose it" policy for non­refundable tickets, the low-priced seats typically bought weeks ahead of a flight. 
US Airways last week became the first major airline to throw out the one-year grace period for passengers with nonre­fundable tickets who miss flights. The Arlington, Va.based carrier, which is restructuring itself in a bankruptcy pro­ceeding, said it wanted to make the cheap­est tickets less attractive in order to drive customers to buy higher-priced tickets with fewer restrictions. 
By the end of the week, American Airlines and Continental Airlines said they'd go along. And now, Northwest and Delta are joining in. 
"I just think it's got to be the dumbest thing they've ever done," said Kevin P. Mitchell, head of the Business Travel Coalition, a group that represents large corporate fliers. Mitchell predicts that rather than create revenue, the move will drive customers to low-fare airlines. 
Bush rejects corporate fraud 
. President won't tolerate banking scandals

SOUTH BEND 
In an effort to promote 
both national and economic 
security, President George 
W. Bush urged Congress to pass legislation to support his goals before a crowd of 5,000 that included Notre Dame representatives Thursday afternoon at the South Bend Regional Airport. 
Bush, who traveled to 
South Bend in support of 
congressional candidate 
Chris Chocola, referred to 
recent corporate accounting 
scandals, stressing that he 
would not tolerate people 
who try to "cook the books." 
"There's no easy money 
in America, just hard time," 
Bush said. 
Consistent with his usual 
rhetoric of freedom and jus­
tice, the President called on 
corporate criminals to take 
heed that their illegal 
actions would have conse­
quences. 
"We're going to find you and we're going to hold you accountable," Bush said. 
The President also focused on economic securi­ty and reminded the crowd of his $1.35 trillion, 10-year tax relief plan, saying it will boost employment. 
Bush proposed the estab­lishment of a terrorism insurance policy to help workers, particularly in the United States," she said to capacity to care and faith. there's darkness," Bush construction industry, who the audience.

Folk artist Kennedy to perforlll 
By NATALIE BAILEY 
News Writer 
Local artist John Kennedy will open the Shaheen Discovery Series on American Folk Music today. Kennedy will be playing original folk music with a number of songs celebrating local areas and history. 
"The tradition of folk songs, in my case Irish songs, is not just that of playing old music but of making new music as well and in new places," said Kennedy. 
John Kennedy grew up in a rich tradition of folk music. He believes it to be, "what people do at home, what we sing and create for each other. The tradition of folk songs is not just that of playing old music but of mak­ing new music as well." 
The theme for this year's discovery series came out of the creation of a new class on American Folk Music taught by Professor Clayton Henderson of the Saint Mary's music department this semester. 
The Shaheen Discovery Series start­ed in the mid 1990's as a lecture series and developed into a series highlighting young artists. As recently as last year, the Cultural Affairs Committee became involved in the program by selecting a genre of music and then scheduling the per­formers accordingly. 
Kennedy opened last year's Celtic Music series with his band, Kennedy's Kitchen. Richard Baxter, director of Special Events, described Kennedy as a "folk singer and Celtic musician rolled into one. His range is incredi­ble." 
Kennedy sees the music for his per­formance today to be an extension of the Irish music that he performed last year. 
"Many of the songs that I'll be doing . .. are songs about Indiana; narrative songs in the Irish tradition but rooted here as so many of the Irish them­selves," Kennedy said. 
In addition to Kennedy's perfor­mance at 7:30 p.m., Julie Henigan of the Notre Dame Irish Studies Program will be coming on Oct. 4 to perform folk music from Britain and Ireland, and Jean Ritchie a long standing icon in American folk music will perform on Oct. 18. Also, Kim and Reggie Harris will perform Oct. 30 presenting music and stories of the Underground Railroad. Sally Roger will be closing the series on Feb. 7 presenting a show for families with her guitar and mountain dulcimer.

Agents raid Inedical Inar11uana farin 
Associated Press 
SANTA CRUZ, Calif. 
Federal agents raided a marijuana farm Thursday and arrested the owners, who helped write the state law legalizing medical use of the plants. 
Officers seized more than 100 marijuana plants, three rifles and a shotgun, said Richard Meyer, a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration in San Francisco. 
Valerie and Michael Corral were arrested on federal charges of intent to distribute marijuana and conspiracy, he said. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney could not determine Thursday whether formal charges had been filed. 
"These are incredibly com­passionate people who've worked closely with law enforcement to help the sick and dying in our community," said Ben Rice, an attorney for the Corrals. "This is absolutely outrageous." 
The Corrals helped write the 1996 law that allows patients to grow marijuana for their own medicine. They work with local authorities to dispense their pot to people with doc­tors' recommendations to use marijuana. 
The farm about 15 miles 
north of Santa Cruz is known 
to local law enforcement, 
which have complied with 
state law rather than federal 
drug laws, said sheriff's 
spokesman Kim Allyn. 
"The DEA didn't tell us they did this. not before, and not after," he said. 
DEA agents have recently cracked down on high-profile medical marijuana advocates and distribution clubs and bypassed local law enforce­ment agencies that have con­doned them.

rupt oil supplies. 
More than 3,000 delegates from 59 oil-producing nations and companies opened the World Petroleum Congress Monday, amid pledges to safe­guard the environment, seek cleaner-burning fuels and reduce the gases blamed for global warming. 
"Oil companies have to con­tinuously seek out new, alter­native ways of doing business which will have the least impact on the environment," India's oil minister, Ram Naik, told the convention. 
Delegates were clearly try­ing to rid the industry of its image as an enemy of the environment. 
For the first time, environ­mental groups such as Greenpeace, Conservation International and the World Wildlife Fund were invited to the meetings. 
A recycling center for the tons of garbage produced by the congress was even set up at the site. 
Naik urged governments and oil companies to share "clean"technologies and redouble efforts to protect the environment. 
He said that India, with a market of nearly 1 billion peo­ple, has followed Brazil's lead in mixing gasoline with ethanol to reduce emissions of polluting greenhouse gases. 
Other delegates pledged to seek cleaner-burning fuels and reduce the gases blamed for global warming. 
''It is no longer possible for any of us to carry out our oil or gas exploitation activities without proper regard to the broader issues of environmen­tal protection," said Lew Watts, group managing direc­tor of Shell Sustainable Development and Latin America. 
But for some groups, the environment-friendly spin was simply for show. 
"I think it's greenwash."said Frank Guggenheim, executive director of Greenpeace in Brazil. 
"We are participating so they can't say we're against 
dialogue, but I don't think the people at the conference are serious about protecting the environment ... They talk about environment, but from the point of view of accidents, you have to be a little skepti­cal." 
Norwegian oil minister Einar Steensnaes said not enough has been done to implement the promises to protect the environment issued at the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992. 
A followup summit, in Johannesburg, South Africa, ends Wednesday. 
"Fossil fuels. at least for the next 20 or 30 years, will con­stitute the main source of energy in meeting increased global demand," Steensnaes said. "Coal, oil and natural gas all contribute in varying to degrees to ... increasing the level of greenhouse gases." 
"Ten years after the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, we once again need to address the links between energy and the environment," he said. 
An OPEC meeting on Sept. 19 in Osaka, Japan, is to decide future production levels for the oil cartel. 
Oil officials fear a conflict in the Middle East could disrupt supplies from the oil-rich region. Last week, oil prices rose to around $30 a barrel amid fears of a U.S. attack on Iraq. 
Other oil pro-ducers could raise output to cover the shortfall. 
Ali Rodriguez, the president of Petroleos de Venezuela, said Monday that Venezuela has the capacity to greatly increase its current oil output. 
But he said any additional pumping would depend on the decisions of OPEC. which opposes an increase in the quota system and is likely to maintain that standing at their next meeting. 
Among the delegates were energy ministers from Great Britain, Algeria, Canada, Cuba and Venezuela. Also present were top executives from oil giants such as ChevronTexaco Corp., ExxonMobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell.

UNC-Chapel Hill's decision to assign "Approaching the Qur'an: The Early Revelations" as summer reading for incom­ing students drew scathing opposition from conservative critics and heavy media atten­tion over the summer. 
The UNC-Chapel Hill Faculty Council issued a statement in support of academic freedom, but the UNC Board of Governors chose not to adopt a similar resolution. 
The state Legislature even got involved, threatening to cut funding for the school's sum­mer reading program unless UNC chose material that rep­resented all religions, the Chapel Hill Herald reported. 
The Family Policy Network, a conservative Christian policy group, filed a lawsuit against the school on behalf of three incoming students. In an op-ed published in USA Today in August, FPN President Joe Glover wrote that the school's 
assigning the book "constitutes 
religious indoctrination" 
because it contains passages 
from a religion's "holy text" 
and presents Islam in a posi­
tive light. 
A federal appellate court 
threw out the lawsuit just 
hours before students were 
scheduled to discuss the book, 
which was written by 
Haverford College Professor of 
Religion Michael Sells. The dis­
cussions went ahead as sched­
uled. 
Brown University Chaplain 
Janet Cooper-Nelson said she 
saw UNC-Chapel Hill's goal as 
"rais(ing) the general level of 
knowledge" in the student 
population. 
It would be questionable if "someone were up there trying to teach the Koran as a belief," she said. But in this case, the religious book represented a view into another culture, a perspective the UNC faculty viewed many students as lack­ing, she said. 
"Should we (educators). observing a great ignorance of Islam and stereotyping of Muslims, do something about it? Absolutely," she said. The fact that the topic in question is a religion doesn't make it any less worthy or appropriate for discussion, she added. 
"You can't really get an edu­

cation if it begins with the 
premise that there's some 
book or doctrine that's too 
dangerous for you," she said. 
Many UNC-Chapel Hill stu­
dents said they were glad they 
read the book, and that the 
debate about it was 
overblown. 
"We're at a liberal arts 
school that's supposed to open 
our minds. You're supposed to 
get new perspective," UNC­
Chapel Hill first-year Matthew 
Neidich told the New York 
Times. "You don't get new per­
spective by not trying to learn 
about new things." 
UNC student and Campus 
Crusade for Christ member 
Maggy Lampley praised her 
university's decision. 
"I don't believe that igno­rance of other religions is the guide that Christ set before us to follow," Lampley told the Times. 
The debate is not over yet. Another conservative group, the American Family Association, has vowed to pur­sue the original lawsuit, the school's newspaper reported. 

The University of Maryland also came under fire for its summer reading choice when it distributed copies of "The Laramie Project," a play about the 1998 murder of 21-year­j

Taliban John ... Ashcroft 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Defending the use of the flag

Time and experience have since changed my mind. 
But let's start from the beginning. This man lost an election to a dead man. This should have set off my warn­ing flags. If the people of Ashcroft's home state would rather have a corpse running things than him, it's a clear sign to the rest of us: avoid. Yet our fearless leader has chosen to throw him in the highest position of law enforcement in the country. So be it. 
Ashcroft's next big move was to com­pletely cover any statue in his year-old office that had exposed breasts or any such. I'd love to say that this was a sign ofjust how much respect he feels the bodies of his fellow Americans are worth ("Capture them, hide them away, and don't say another word about it") with the terrorists he seeks to steal

Flyingflag shows dedication to humanity 
This letter is in response to Anna Nussbaum's Sept. 4 letter. 
We agree that the attacks of Sept. 11 were crimes against all humanity, but that does not discount that they were crimes against America. The reason that other nationalities were victims in the attacks is because they had come to America to be involved in the freedoms and opportunities in the capitalistic society we enjoy, and the tragedy is as much ours as it is anyone's. 
It seems that your argument stands on a misrepresentation of what the American flag actually is. Every Memorial Day, one of our families hangs a flag given t.o them after the death of a grandfather and WWII veteran. The flag is not a celebration, as you called it, of his death or the deaths of anyone remembered for their service on that holiday. It is a show of solidarity in the face of opposition and conflict. It is a show of how we will not give way to the violations against humanity you cited. It is a show of how in terrible times and in glorious times, we have managed to push this country and its people forward to the life we are so privileged to have today. 
Nussbaum must come to an understanding of what this symbol truly is and not be so quick to judge other's intents. 
Regarding humanitarian efTorts, the United States has given more money, more manpower, more food and more diplomatic effort to the suffering and war~torn nations of the world than any other country. ever. We'd like to think that flying the American flag shows some empathy for these causes as well. 
You said, "Patriotism is no antidote for hatred," but what better antidote could there be to hatred than love? And what is patriotism but love of one's country and fellow people? Although America has committed wrong, just as every country, we are still the greatest experiment in freedom in the history of humanity. 
Patriotism and solidarity are, in fact, the exact opposite of the hatred that drove the attacks of Sept. 11. Flying the flag expresses our continued dedication to humanity.

Balance U.S. blunders with achievements 
Those who know me will verify that I am a staunch critic of many areas of American life. I am an advocate for socialist measures and gun control. I find nothing inherently evil with legal homosexual unions. I feel nauseat­ed when I have to choke down the 20th play­ing within the hour of Nelly's "Hot in Herre" over the radio (it's no accident that the Midwest is notorious for terrible rap). And recently, I have been relatively outspoken on why attacking Iraq is absolutely moronic, both on moral and strategic grounds. 
And you know the best part? I can be per­fectly vocal about every one of the above views without fear of governmental retalia­tion. Hell, I could burn a flag on the Capitol steps and be well within my rights. And not just myself -everyone living in America enjoys these same basic, albeit important, freedoms. Which is why I was particularly taken aback by Anna Nussbaum's Sept. 4 let­ter entitled "Think twice before hanging the flag." 
I find a few particular ironies in Ms. Nussbaum's article. First, does it strike any­one besides me as odd that in the very coun­tries in which she claims "murder on the part of our government" has been committed, she would have been either imprisoned or shot for expressing her anti-nationalistic views in print? Or that if she even attempted to mount her soapbox under the Taliban rule in Afghanistan she would have been stoned to death? In her America-is-evil rhe!oric she takes for granted the fact that she can legally express those very viewpoints. 
But another, more subtle irony. is that she condemns America for wrong acts it has com­mitted, yet is gung-ho for allegiance to Christianity. For those who are unfamiliar with the last millennium of history, allow me to recap some of Christianity's greatest hits: the Inquisition, the Crusades, imperialism of three continents and slaughter of the natives living there, moral support of slavery. ousting of the Jews from Spain, neutrality during World War II, Jerry Falwell and a slew of sex scandals (and I don't just mean the recent one in the Catholic Church -the term nephew originally meant "son of a celibate clergyman" during the Middle Ages, and the definition still exists in some dictionaries today). I think this will suffice, although I could go on. 
My point in bringing up Christianity's blun­ders throughout history was not to advocate thinking twice about going to Mass, but rather to prove a point. Human institutions inevitably commit serious errors by virtue of the fact that they're human. Our responsibili­ty, then, is to judge those institutions not on the basis of their blunders, else we would be forced to condemn the whole lot, but rather for what they stand as a whole. 
Christianity is not about televangelists, tor­ture and intolerance, but faith, hope and love. Similarly, the United States is not about war and murder, but freedom and respect of those who are different. 
And no matter how many bombs our gov­ernment drops, no matter how badly mistak­en its policies are, no matter how much it errs, I, and I hope others as well, will still wildly wave Union Jack, not because I con­done America's failures. but because I love its principles. I do not state it lightly or as a plat itude when I say that we live in the greatest country on earth. If nothing else, at least we have the right to say otherwise.

Knee-length skirts or ones that hit just above the knee _are big_ in d~nim this year. Go for a Jean skirt with a yellow or brown wash instead ?f the traditional stone wash for a vmtage flare.

If you want to sport a skirt, but want softness, try one in sweat material with a drawstring waist. If you prefer

keep your legs covered, you can hang on to your peasant blouse from sum­mer and wear it with low-rise jeans. Gap offers a pair with a Long and Lean fit that is slimming for many women from sizes 4 to 12. Cuffed trousers, especially in pinstripes, are also making a comeback, getting a "leg up" on the masculine style seen on the Fall 2002 runways. 
Additional accessories 
Thick belts with fringe provide 
punch to a simple outfit. Parrish said 
that brown belts are entering the 
scene this fall, but they don't have to 
be matched to brown shoes, dispelling 
the popular misconception that 
footwear and belts must always be the 
same shade. Scarves can double as a 
belt and are a great way to recycle 
those pashminas from seasons past. 
Long scarves are the hip headband 
and are perfect for those summer 
haircuts in the growing-out stage. 
Don't precisely match them to your 
ensemble; instead, choose a color or 
pattern to express your individuality. 
The poorboy hat is extremely popu­
lar and it's a great way to camouflage 
bed head. Turquoise, the stone of 
summer, is still going strong and looks 
great with fall colors like chocolate brown and camel. Rings with slightly enlarged gemstones in rich autumn hues like amber and garnet are subtle ways to reflect the change in leaves in your outfit. 
To have and to hold 
Hobo bags big enough to carry all your purchases from the bookstore are must-haves. Coach's new "Ergo Collection" gives a more structured form to the hobo style and comes in saddle, black, red and white. If you don't want to tote a treasure chest of a purse, this fall's clutches provide styl­ish storage for your lip gloss and stu­dent ID. Prada displayed a gorgeous emerald green satin clutch in her Fall 2002 collection. 
If you want something a tad larger 
and less expensive than the Prada clutch, the crescent bag could be for you. Furia has a brown suede version called "fly" and Banana Republic has the half-moon handbags in tweed, suede and leather.

Weitzman created a dressy pump that ties above the ankle. If your tootsies can take it, pointed boots and pumps are sharp completions to jeans and cuffed pants. According to Gallagher. pumps with more delicate heels and rounded toes are also en vogue this fall. The spring and summer pointed toe slingbacks can be strapped on into fall. Though shoes have been models of simplicity for the past few seasons, this fall, shoes will be adorned with bows, buckles and contrast stitching. 
"Th.ere's going to be a lot of orna­mentation on shoes," Gallagher said. 
Out In the cold 
This fall, the pea coat is great to bundle up in for women as well as men. Even better, women don't have to purchase the standard mid­thigh or mid­calf version this season. 
..For women, I would sug­gest a shorter pea coat rather than a longer one. There's more than one option this year," Parrish said. 
If you define yourself as more funky than formal, try a hip-length coat in faux fur, which Parrish fore­cast to be pop­ular this sea­son. 
If it takes you a little extra time in the morning to put all 
the trendiest in fall fashion together, at least you'll arrive to class fashion­ably late.

MLB 

Owners ratify labor deal by 29-1 vote ­

Associated Press 
CHICAGO 
Baseball owners approved 
their new labor contract quickly 
and overwhelmingly, voting 29­
1 to ratify the deal negotiators 
struck last week to avert a 
strike. 
The New York Yankees, the 
team that stands to lose the 
most, voted against the agree­
ment, which ensures labor 
peace until December 2006. 
Approval by the executive board 
of the union is considered cer­
tain. 
·Tm not going to suggest to 
you today that there are not 
clubs with very different views, 
but at some point you have to 
come together." commissioner 
Bud Selig said after the two­
hour meeting, flanked by his 
chief negotiators, Bob DuPuy 
and Rob Manfred. 
"I told you last Friday I was a 
Yogi Berra theorist -'It ain't 
over until it's over.' It's over." 
But baseball's turmoil might 
not be. 
The Yankees are considering a lawsuit, and owners must resolve the uncertain status of the Montreal Expos, who could try to move to Washington or another city by next season. Expos president Tony Tavares wants to know within 10 days whether the team will stay or explore a move. 
Selig had spent thousands of hours on the telephone with owners to develop a consensus for the labor agreement, and he approved the final moves made by his negotiators last week. The near-unanimous vote was a sign of support he has among 
the owners. 
"I'm in Mayor Richard J. 
Daley's hometown. They'd have 
been pleased with the result, 
and I'm very pleased with the 
result," Selig said. 
The Yankees, who generate 
the most money in baseball. 
estimate the annual amount 
they give up to other clubs will 
increase from $28 million in 
2001 to between $50 million 
and $55 million next year. The 
team's lawyers have been exam­
ining grounds for a lawsuit. 
Yankees president Randy 
Levine declined comment after 
the meeting. 
"There's absolutely no basis 
for any challenge to the agree­
ment whatsoever," said DuPuy, 
baseball's chief operating offi­
cer. 
Kansas City Royals owner 
David Glass said during the 
meeting that the agreement was 
only a start to reforming base­
ball's economics, according to 
one baseball official at the ses­
sion, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
"It doesn't solve things, but it improves them," Glass said ,.,,, before leaving the hotel at O'Hare International Airport. "It makes things better. but not where we'd like to be. The main thing is we didn't have a work stoppage. That's the big plus." 
Negotiators agreed to the deal Friday just 3 1/2 hours before the first game that would have been affected by a strike. Since the last deal without a work stoppage in 1970, baseball had been disrupted by five strikes and three lockouts.

Associated Press 
NEW YORK 
Lennox Lewis will give up one of his heavyweight titles rather than fight mandatory contender Chris Byrd, claiming that Byrd offers him no great challenge and that no one wants to see the fight anyway. 
Lewis' decision to give up the IBF version of the title means the heavyweight championship will likely be further fractured, though the public generally recognizes him as the legiti­mate champion. 
It also opens up the door for Evander Holyfield to fight Byrd and try to become a heavy­weight champion-for the fifth time at age 40. Byrd is the IBF's top-ranked contender, while Holyfield is No. 2. 
Ross Greenburg, president of HBO Sports, said his network was interested in airing a Holyfield-Byrd fight, possibly on Dec. 14. 
"Evander Holyfield has per­formed beautifully on our net­work for a decade," Greenburg

Lewis won't fight Byrd, gives up title 
His attorney, Judd Burstein, said "the only person who is authorized to speak about Lennox Lewis' future is Lennox Lewis." 
A source familiar with Lewis' plans, speaking on condition of anonymity. said he likely would fight next against the Ukraine's Vitaly Klitschko, but probably not until sometime in February. 
The decision by Lewis came just as the IBF was to take purse bids from promoters for a fight against Byrd, a crafty left-hander who tends to frus­trate his opponents and make them look bad. 
In a statement, Lewis, who for a brief time held all three major heavyweight titles, said the champion was more impor­tant than the title. 
"Prior to today, my team and I had already determined that there was no public interest in a Lennox Lewis-Chris Byrd bout," he said. "My decision was also based upon the fact that I believe, as I have said repeatedly, that Chris Byrd offers no competitive challenge to me." 
HBO had set aside Dec. 7 as the date for a possible Lewis fight, but a network executive said earlier this week that the heavyweight champion would have to quickly agree to an opponent for the fight to hap­pen on that date. 
Lewis has hinted of retire­ment since stopping Mike Tyson on June 8, saying there were few challenges among the current group of heavyweights and not enough money to lure him back into the ring.

Last second score lifts 'Niners 


Associated Press 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. 
What seemed like a dud of a season-opening party for the NFL actually turned into a thriller. 
Jose Cortez kicked a 36-yard field goal with six seconds to play. giving the San Francicso 49ers a 16-13 victory over the New York Giants in a Thursday night season opener. 
Cortez also had field goals of 23 and 33 yards and Garrison Hearst score on a 9-yard pass for the Niners.

Tiki Barber tied the game at 13 with a 1-yard with 1 :49 to play, and rookie Matt Bryant made field goals of 29 and 33 yards for the Giants in a mis­take-filled game that turned into a nail-biter in the fourth quarter. 
San Francisco went 52 yards in six plays on its winning drive, with the big gain com­ing on the opening play. 
_Terrell Owens, fairly invisi­ble the whole game, caught a 33-yard pass down the right sideline, moving the ball to the New York 37. A 12-yard pass to J.J. Stokes got the ball to the 25, and Hearst's 7-yard run set up Cortez, who earlier had a 25-yarder blocked and was short from 48. 
This one was down the mid­dle. 
San Francisco seemed in control in the fourth quarter after wiping out a 6-3 halftime deficit on Hearst's 9-yard touchdown catch on a swing pass from Jeff Garcia, and Cortez's 33-yard field goal, which came after Collins was intercepted for the third time. 
However, the Giants responded with a 77-yard, 14­play game-tying drive that fea­tured a key 23-yard pass from Collins to Amani Toomer on third-and-16. First-round draft pick Jeremy Shockey caught a 20-yarder and Barber made a third-down catch and roll to give New York a first down at the 4­yard line. 
Barber swept the left side 
two plays later for the go 
ahead touchdown, diving into 
the corner of the end zone. 
The Giants outgained the 
49ers 361-279, with Collins 
and Toomer providing most of 
the yardage. 
Collins was 28 of 45 for 342 
yards, but his three intercep­
tions and some key penalties 
hurt the Giants. Toomer, who 
had nine receptions for 134 
yards, lost 44 yards on one 
third-quarter pass to the 
Niners 7 because of a holding 
penalty against left tackle 
Luke Petitgout. the one 
returning member of the 
Giants' revamped offensive 
line. 
Garcia finished 16 of 26 for 
166 yards. Owens, considered 
the best receiver in the league 
by many, had only four catch­
es for 41 yards. but he had the 
big one at the key time. 
Despite two first-half inter­ceptions of Collins and a fail­ure to convert on two chances from the 49ers' 21, the Giants took a 6-3 halftime lead on field goals of 29 and 33 yards by Bryant. 
San Francisco left three points on the field on its open­ing series. 
An interception by Tony Parrish on the third play and a 16-yard run by Garcia gave the 49ers a first down at the 7. Cortez eventually had a 25­yard field goal blocked by Mike Rosenthal, the Giants 6­foot-7 offensive tackle. 
More than 30 years after his over-the-top 1971 cult shriekfest Let's Scare Jessica to Death, director John Hancock returns to the genre fold with a new flick that leaves the top but the merest speck in the (decidedly cracked) rear-view mirror. With enough goofy, gruesome twists to fill a half-dozen thrillers, Suspended Animation starts out as a cannibalistic Misery (complete with Kathy Bates clone Allen) as major Hollywood animator Tom Kempton (McArthur) finds himself a captive of a supremely scary middle-age sister act-backwoods Baby Jane variation Vanessa Boulette (Estennan) and her portly sib Ann (Allen)-following a Midwestern snowmobile mishap. After a couple of sadistic, squinn-inducing vignettes, the film suddenly veers into icy deliverance terrain before time-and-place-shifting to L.A. and a profusion of additional shocks and surprises so extreme as to border on literal overkill, including a close-up pimple-popping moment to rival Clean Shaven's infamous fingernail-removal scene. To delve into specifics would seriously risk ruining Suspended Animation '.r unapologetic Grand Guignol pleasures; suffice it to say that Hancock and scripter Dorothy Tristan have the chops to pull off one of the most outlandish fearfests of recent years, one that would fonn a terrif twinbill with the Don Dobler gore-a-thon Ha, i1esters (VS#42). Among the thesps, former screen psycho McArthur (Rampage) turns in strenuous work as an ultra-victim, rivaling Zohra Lampert's ordeal in Jessica. The Boulette Family-including serial-killer teen grandson Sandor (Meyers) and creepy jailbird brother Philip (Freeman)-can take its rightful place beside The Texas Chainsaw Massacre '.S' Sawyer clan as one of the nuttiest nuclear units in fright-film history. When we caught Suspended Animation at a Palm Beach International Film Festival matinee, the audience gasps were loud and frequent; this would have been a great flick to watch with a vintage 42nd Street crowd. Look for it wherever it turns up next, hopefully in time for Halloween 2002.

TENNIS 
German man pleads guilty to stalking 


Associated Press 
NEWYORK 
A German man pleaded guilty to stalking top-ranked tennis player Serena Williams. 
Albrecht Stromeyer, 34, entered the plea to fourth-degree stalking -a misdemeanor -in Criminal Court in Queens, and was discharged. 
Judge Suzanne Melendez told Stromeyer to stay away from Williams and her family and at least 1,000 yards from any wrA Tour or U.S. Tennis Association tournament. including the U.S. Open. 
"My absolute concern is the safety of Serena Williams and her family," the judge said. 
Stromeyer waived his right of appeal and agreed to get psychi­atric treatment in his hometown of Frankfurt. An Oct. 23 hearing was scheduled to review the case; Stromeyer is not required to attend. 
"This is the outcome that my client wanted," said Gerard Savage, Stromeyer's Legal Aid attorney. 
Savage also apologized on behalf of Stromeyer, saying, "In his mind, it was a love story.... It was romantic poetry." 
Stromeyer's brother and cousin attended the hearing; no mem­ber of Williams' family came. 
The judge denied a request by Stromeyer to speak in court. 
"His family has assured us that he will receive appropriate psy­chiatric care and that every effort will be made to prevent him from engaging in this kind of conduct in the future," Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said. 
"Today's disposition will hope­fully get Mr. Stromeyer the help that he clearly needs and will assure that he is kept far away from Ms. Williams and other members of the women's tennis tour," Brown added. 
Following his plea, Stromeyer was to be placed in the custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
Stromeyer was arrested Saturday at the National Tennis Center and held on $3,000 bail. He was charged with two counts of stalking after police spotted him watching through a fence as Williams, the reigning Wimbledon and French Open champion, played her third­round match against Nathalie Dechy. 
Williams has been traveling with a bodyguard since May because of the threat. 
Stromeyer admitted in a writ­ten statement to police that he had been following Williams around the world. He was arrest­ed outside the gates of Wimbledon in July after scuffiing with police and told the officers he loved her and would never hurt her.

U.S. OPEN 
Sampras dominates Roddick in quarters 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK 
As Pete Sampras pumped his fist to cel­ebrate a volley winner that closed the sec­ond set, Andy Roddick flashed an admir­ing thumbs up and then bowed. acknowl­edging that his idol still has what it takes to put him away. 
This cross-generational matchup was no match at all. 
Smacking aces at over 130 mph. cover­ing every inch of the net, Sampras looked like the younger man and dominated an apparently awe-struck Roddick 6-3, 6-2. 6-4 to reach the U.S. Open semifinals. It took all of 90 minutes. 
"This is what I play for. I was ready to go from the first point on," said Sampras, who hasn't won a tournament at any level in two years. ·Tm just confident in the big moment that I'm going to come through. I spent moments of struggling with the con­fidence this year but I can get it back pretty quickly." 
It was Sampras' 29th Grand Slam quar­terfinal, and Roddick's second. Sampras came in with 200 match victories in majors, Roddick with 15. 

"You guys say Pete is washed up. I never said it," Roddick said. "I don't think anybody doubts the fact that he's capable of great tennis still." 
The difference in the players' ages was obvious when they walked out on a windy night: the 20-year-old Roddick in his shiny blue T-shirt, his spiky hair peering out from above a visor, and the 31-year­old Sampras in his proper tennis whites, nothing covering his receding hairline. 
Sampras, seeking his fifth U.S. Open championship, will be a big favorite Saturday against No. 24 Sjeng Schalken, 
who outlasted No. 28 Fernando Gonzalez 
6-7 (5). 6-3, 6-3, 6-7 (5). 7-6 (2} to get to 
his first major semifinal. 
Saturday's other semifinal is Andre Agassi vs. defending champion Lleyton Hewitt, yet another duel between a 30­something and a 20-something. 
The women play their semifinals Friday, with Venus and Serena Williams bidding to set up a third straight all-sister Grand Slam final. Venus, the two-time defending champion, faces Amelie Mauresmo, followed by Serena against Lindsay Davenport. 
Arthur Ashe Stadium was a sea of empty blue seats for Schalken-Gonzalez. It was packed at night for Sampras­Roddick, which didn't live up to the billing 
To put it simply: Youth was outserved. And outvolleyed, outhit and out-just­about-everything-elsed. 
Asked by USA Network announcers what advice he'd give Roddick, Boris Becker said, "Get out of the stadium." 
Sampras had 13 aces and a total of 43 winners to 18 for Roddick, who might have been a step slow, having bruised his left foot during an earlier match. 
Still, he never came close to solving Sampras' serve, managing only one break point. It came early in the second set and was erased, appropriately, when Sampras struck a good serve and followed it up with a crisp volley to the corner. 
"You can't be upset at not breaking Pete Sampras," Roddick said. 
Sampras has played his best tennis of the past 24 months in the U.S. Open, reaching the finals in 2000 and 2001. Now he's doing it again. 
Roddick, who was seeded 11th to Sampras' 17th, looked tight right from the start. He lost the first seven points of the match en route to getting broken immedi­

"I wanted to set the tone early." to get broken at love. At the changeover, Sampras said. Roddick chewed on a towel. then tried to 
He was popping serves by Roddick, and rip it. not just with pure power. Sampras closed Sampras broke again to get to 5-2, the first set with a spinning offering at helped by Roddick's backhand into the 101 mph that Roddick barely got to, his net. Roddick -as emotive on the court as forehand return bouncing before it Sampras is stoic -dropped his racket, reached the net. twisted at the hips, and yelled, "Awww, 
Roddick handed Sampras a 2-1 second-come on!"

University Libraries 
SPRING 2002 LIBRARY (LIBQUAL+) SURVEY 
In March, the University Libraries ofNotre Dame, along with 168 other academic and research libraries, participated in a pilot web-based survey asking students and faculty to rate the quality and importance of a broad range of library services. Ofthe 2800 students and faculty randomly selected and contacted, 794 completed the survey. The library thanks everyone who responded to the survey. 
Some Initial Observations: 
l1I 
Our users rate us highest for our willingness to help and for our consistently courteous employees. 
~~ University ofNotre Dame students and faculty want, first and foremost, to have knowledgeable library employees and library resources & tools designed so that they can easily find what they need on their own. 
l'ii 
It is important to students and faculty that we improve the accuracy and functionality ofour online catalog; reduce the turnaround time to receive Interlibrary Loan materials; and add to the depth and breadth ofour collections. 
~;. We must continueio work on improving the attractiveness and aesthetics ofour library facilities and also on making more electronic resources accessible from home or office. 
,~ There are some differences among responses from faculty and students. Access to comprehensive collections and an easy-to-use web site are especially important to faculty. While these are important to students as well, they also want convenient business hours and a quiet place to study. 
ii 
The University Libraries ofNotre Dame results are, for the most part, well above national averages. 
. The library will look at the survey data in more detail, analyze it in conjunction with other survey results, and identify ways to deliver services and collections that are more closely aligned with our users' expectations.

CROSS COUNTRY 
Irish host season opening adidas Invitational 
Special ot The Observer 
The Notre Dame mens and 

womens cross country teams 
begin the 2002 season early 
this year, hosting today's inau­
gural adidas Invitational at the 
Burke Memorial Golf Course. 
This will be the earliest cross 
country meet the Irish have 
hosted on campus and it gives 
Notre Dame three home meets 
on the season. 
The 2002 adidas Invitational may be a small meet, as only four teams will be competing in the mens race and three in the womens, but it will be a com­petitive event. Traditional cross country powers North Carolina State and Arizona State will run in both races while Tennessee will only participate in the mens race and Tennessee will participate only in the mens race. 
In the men's MONDO presea­son cross country poll, North Carolina State was ranked sev­enth, Arizona State was 13th and Notre Dame ended up 25th. Tennessee was in the also receiving votes category of the poll. 
Even though the meet will be highly competitive this week­end, both Notre Dame cross country teams will be using their first time together on the course this season as just a first step toward their ultimate goals of making the NCAA Championship. 
The men will have their top

runners together for the race 
this weekend, but the youthful­
ness of the Irish team will be 
readily apparent. John Keane 
is the only senior in the 15-run­
ner entry list for the Notre 
Dame men's team, while seven 
freshmen and sophomores will 
be in the field. 
All-American Todd Mobley should be among the race lead­ers. Mobley finished 38th at the NCAA Championship last year and had a great off season of training, ready to take over the leadership of a team that lost three All-American runners to graduation. 
Rookie Tim Moore, the 2001 Foot Locker Cross Country Champion, will also make his debut for the Irish. 
The womens team will enter all of their talented veteran runners, but head coach Tim Connelly will keep his fresh­man class off the course on Friday. 
Jennifer Handley also will be among the contenders in the womens race. Handley was in the running for the Big East Championship last year, ending up seventh in the field to earn all-Big East honors. 
Returning All-American Lauren King is coming off one of the best freshman seasons in school history last year. King finished 27th at the national meet a year ago, then moved on to qualify for the NCAA track and field indoor meet in the mile run. She would then

VOLLEYBALL 
Chance to improve in L.A. 


ByMATTLOZAR 
Sports Writer 
Looking to build on last week­end ·s· Shamrock Invitational title, the Notre Dame volleyball team travels to Los Angeles this weekend to participate in the Loyola Marymount Volleyball Classic. The Shamrock Invitational showed the Irish where they needed improve­ment. 
"It's early in the season, so there is a lot of room for improvement," Notre Dame coach Debbie Brown said. "We need to work on passing, some of our rotations, key subs and getting [freshmen] Kelly Burrell and Meg Henican in on some sub situations. 
"I think we feel like we can hit a little more efficiently against the block. Probably the area we were most pleased with was our blocking." 
Freshman Lauren Kelbley agreed with her coach.

Over the three matches, Kelbley committed only two attack errors and recorded 14 kills, 22 digs, six blocks and two aces. This success did not totally surprise the coaches.

The second game on Saturday for Notre Dame will be Saint Louis. The Billikens present a problem similar to the Lions. 
"Saint Louis is a little similar to Loyola Marymount," Brown said. "Colleen Hunter is a great player. We could not stop her when they beat us last year, so we need to contain her." 
Last October, Notre Dame lost at Saint Louis three games to one.

Sinclair drew the awe and atten­tion of the soccer world in the Under-19 tournament, scoring 10 goals in four games, including a five-goal performance against England. 
"Her pace and power we couldn't deal with...," England's coach Mo Marley told The Edmonton Journal. 
In fact, Sinclair's play was so cap­tivating even her Canadian team­mates were in awe. 
'TH catch myself standing around in practice just watching her," teammate Kara Lang told the Journal. "There's something in her. She's special. She'll score goals that you'd never think could end up going in. She does things that peo­ple won't ever be capable of doing. Sometimes it blows my mind." 
Those 10 goals were more than four other teams scored in the tour­nament. But try to tell her she is one of the best, and she won't have it. 
"I don't know what to say to that because I know so many great play­ers out there," Sinclair told Barnes. "It's hard to say I'm one of the best players in the world because I'd never do that." 
Santa Clara's Wagner has had 
her fair share of international com­petition as a current member of the 
U.S. National team. In fact, she nearly made the U.S. 1999 Women's World Cup roster and was an alternate for the team in the Sydney Olympics.

Heinrichs told Soccer America's Scott French. "But she hadn't realized the difference between being talented and being impactful. ... We've seen phenome­nal improvement since January, and, yet, she really prides herself on working.... It's about being impactful. being a player who can help us win the world champi­onship. She is one of the most focused players we have on the national team right now." 
That's high praise form the man who works with the top players in the country. 
"Aly is the best final passer in the women's game today," added Heinrichs. "She puts the ball right on your foot ... that makes wonder­ful things happen behind the defense. The texture, pace, accura­cy, timing of delivery is phenome­nal."

"She's got the best vision of any player I've ever played with," Penn State's Christie Welsh, a U.S. National teammate, told French. "Passes you wouldn't see on the field, she gets it to people." 
Add that to the skills of numerous superstars and international play­ers for No. 6 Notre Dame, No. 13 Clemson, No. 14 Santa Clara and No. 19 Portland, and that gives the· making for some exciting soccer.

season. It's always been my philosophy that these types of games make you a stronger team at the end of the season. 
"We're Notre Dame, and we want to compete against the best teams in the country." 
Last weekend, Notre Dame opened its season in impres­sive fashion with two blowout victories over Big East Conference opponents Providence and Virginia Tech. The Irish netted eight goals over the weekend and didn't surrender a goal to their oppo­
nents. 
While these wins were confi­dence boosters, Providence and Virginia Tech are simply not the same caliber opponent of Santa Clara and Portland. 
"We all know how big this weekend is for us," senior cap­tain Ashley Dryer said. "Everyone is really excited this weekend for these games and the first home football game. We just need to stay focused right now. This weekend will be a lot tougher than last weekend. These teams will be a lot faster and more physi­cal." 
Last week, five different 
top two returning scorers in forwards Leslie Osborne and Veronica Zepeda. The defend­ing national champs also have the services of USC transfer and 2001 Pac-10 Rookie of the Year Megan Kahadelas. 
Sunday will not be any easier for the Irish defense. Portland's Sinclair, the star of Canada's Under-19 National Team, was the NCAA Freshman of the Year last year. The All-American ranked fifth nationally in scoring with 23 goals and 8 assists. 
Ironically, Sinclair's team­mates on the U-19 Canadian National team during last week's World Championships -Candace Chapman and Katie Thorlakson -will now be responsible for trying to slow her down. 
Chapman and Thorlakson return to an extremely young defense after missing last weekend's action. Also, All­American Vanessa Pruzinsky is expected to play this weekend after recovering from a leg injury that kept her out of action during most of the pre­season. 
Last week, the Irish defense started two sophomores Gudrun Gunnarsdottir and Kate Tulisiak and two fresh­men Miranda Ford and Cat Sigler. None of these players were regular starters on the 2001 squad. Only Gunnarsdottir, the current Big East Defender of the Week, had ever seen significant game action before. 
Coach Waldrurn is counting on his young defense to allevi­ate some of the pressure off his inexperienced tandem of goal­keepers. Both Erika Bohn and Lauren Kent played extremely well last weekend, but neither keeper had ever started a game prior to the games against Providence and Virginia Tech. 
"I still have not decided on a starting goalkeeper," Waldrum said. "Regardless of who is in net, our defense really needs to step up. Our goal is to try to integrate all of the new players into the system this weekend. Hopefully, getting these play­ers back will really help us." 
"This being Notre Dame, we expect to be one of the top teams in the country every year," said Amanda Guertin. "When you're playing good teams, you have to expect to compete. We just need to con­centrate on Notre Dame soccer and the rest will fall into place."

players accounted for the lrish's eight goals. Midfielders Mary Boland and Randi Scheller and forward Amy Warner led the Irish offense, scoring two goals each.

ing pos­session of the ball and creating quality scoring opportunities for the Irish offense. 
"The game will dictate our role [as midfielders]." said Dryer. "Santa Clara has three talented offensive midfielders. We have to play aggressively and force them to play a defen­sive game." 
Waldrum echoed the senti­ments of his midfielder. 
"We have enough weapons on offense that we're going to create scoring opportunities," the coach said. "The key is to

HOROSCOPE 
CELEBRITIF.S BORN ON TIDS DAY: Swoosie Kurtz, Jane Curtin, Billy Rose Happy Birthday: You must be willing to do what's best for yourself this year. Don't put up with people who stand in your way or you'll feel let down. Start preparing yourself for change by getting organized and setting your priorities straight. Having a game plan will be half the battle this. Rely on yourself and you'll be in a far better position to help others later. Your numbers are 9, 14, 22, 25, 36, 45 ARIES (March 21-April 19):You're going to get a lot of attention at social gatherings today. You'll definitely be the life of the party. However, the person you're most attracted to may need a little probing. *** TAURUS (April 20-May 20): It's likely to be an upsetting day if you are ... expecting others to do things for you. You're the only one who can make yourself feel better. Have fun and do the things you enjoy the most. **** GEMINI (May 21-June 20): It's time to be honest with yourself. Even if the truth hurts, it's better to deal with it now than to let things progress. Observing the situation longer will be tiresome. ***** CANCER (June 21-July 22): Focus on friends, doing things you enjoy and taking short trips. If you put in extra hours, you may end up meeting someone who will become important to you. ***** LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Your dynamism will beckon new friends and lovers. Be careful not to exaggerate too much or you may upset someone who is already close to you. If you are willing to take a small risk, you may even make some money. *** VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): You will be upset over the cost of a repair today. Unnecessary spending is evident. Don't let anyone convince you that you need something that really isn't necessary.***LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): You can't expect to keep someone happy if you curtail their freedom. You will be in a good frame of mind to get into self-improvement projects. The results you get will make you glad that you 
did.*** 
SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Get involved in something that will make you feel good about yourself. The new people you meet will be far more accommodating than some of those you have known for some time. **** SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Don't take anything for granted at work. 
Know that you won't get something for nothing today. The chance that someone may talk behind your back should be reason enough to keep your secrets to yourself. ** CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Financial gains are apparent if you're willing to take a risk. A residential move may be necessary, but in the long run will do you a world of good. An adventure is just around the corner. ***** AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): You can meet potential new mates while traveling or attending an event. Your interest in foreign cultures will expand. You should get involved in community events. *** PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Attractions to clients will be hard to resist.

Weekend showcase 
Notre Dame Classic brings top teams, players to campus for tournament 
By CHRIS FEDERICO 
Sports Editor 
Notre Dame has been a hot seat of womens soccer in America for the past decade, yet this area has never seen such a showcase of talent as comes to campus this weekend for the Notre Dame Classic held at Alumni Field. 
The tournament pits four top 20 teams against each other in four games to be played Friday and Sunday. It also brings two of the best womens soccer players in the world in Santa Clara mid­fielder Aly Wagner and Portland forward Christy Sinclair. 
Sinclair will be making her season debut -as will Irish defenders Candace Chapman and Katie Thorlakson -after the recent completion of the Under-19 World Championships. 
The three were teammates on the Canadian Under-19 team r that dropped a 1-0 loss to the United States in the champi­onship game. Three Santa Clara players -sophomores Leslie Osborne, Megan Kahadelas and Jessica Ballweg -were on that 
U.S. team and will be making their debuts as well this week­end.

It may not be the Final Four, but it will certainly feel that way at Alumni Field this week­end. 
No.7 Notre Dame will face defending national champion Santa Clara on Friday at 7:30 and No.19 Portland on Sunday at 1:00. With No.13 Clemson also playing this weekend, this may be one of the finest fields ever assembled in the four­year histbry of this weekend's exclusive soccer showcase. 
While it might only be the second week of the season, regular season games rarely get any bigger than this week­end's games. Notre Dame coach Randy Waldrum knows how important these marquee matchups will be in determin­ing the future success of his team. 
"We'd love to win both games this weekend," said Waldrum. "More importantly, we'll use these games as a measuring stick to evaluate where we are now and where we need to be. I've always believed that it is important to play top teams early in the sea­son so you can make adjust­ments for the rest of the sea-

Irish can't be green in the red zone 
On Saturday, the Irish offense showed major improvement from last sea­son. Carlyle Holiday passed for 226 yards and eight dif­ferent re­ceivers caught the ball. Notre Dame scored 22 points, 2.5 points more than its average points scored last season. 
But there was a problem -not one Irish offensive player scored a touchdown against Maryland. 
Last Saturday, that didn't spell defeat for the Irish. Thanks to five field goals from Nicholas Setta and Vontez Dufrs 76-yard punt return, not to mention stel­lar play by Notre Dame's defense, the Irish managed to come out with a solid vic­tory against the Terrapins. 
As for the rest of the sea­son -Notre Dame will not be playing teams that exited the fairy tale and entered Tales from the Crypt. Starting Saturday, Notre Dame will have to worry about teams that are going to score more than zero points. 

What does that mean? 
The Irish offense has to produce. 
"We need to not make so many unforced errors," Tyrone Willingham said dur­ing a Tuesday press confer­ence. "We need to make bet­ter decisions in every area." 
Those better decisions start with eliminating penal­ties. 
The offense was charged with a false start five times during Saturday's game. That is not acceptable for a veteran quarterback and an offensive

penalties. A team other than Maryland is going to capital­ize on that. 
"We had a lot of penalties when we're not supposed to and a lot of breakdowns sometimes in the offense, and we really have to work on that." Holiday said. 
Maybe it was playing against Maryland's defense that caused the problem. Maybe it was first-game jit­ters. Maybe it was playing in an unfamiliar stadium. 
Whether it was any of those first-game problems or the fact that the Easter Bunny was distracting the team during play calling, the Irish created problems for themselves. 
"I'll go back and say that probably some of our prob­lem -not probably, but all of our problems -may have been in many cases what we did to ourselves," Willingham said. 
Stopping offensive penal­ties isn't enough. The Irish have to stop relying on Nicholas Setta. As nice as it 
is for him 
other 
names put 
points on the board. 
This Saturday when the Irish take the field against Purdue. they need to capi­talize when they're inside the 20-yard line. The Irish were within the 20 three times against Maryland, and all three scoring drives ended in a field goal. 
"I was surprised [at pro­duction in the red zone]," said running back Ryan Grant. "I think that that wasn't a representation of what is to come." 
Let's hope not. If it is, Setta may end the season with 192 points, but Notre Dame is certainly not going to be bringing home wins against good offensive teams such as Michigan and Florida State. 
"Nick, he's automatic, he's an automatic three, but at the same time, we're really tired of seeing Nick run onto the field," Holiday said. "Right now, he's the leading scorer on the team, and that's not just right. I'm sure we're going to get something going in the red zone." 
The offense showed some of what it is capable of in the Kickoff Classic. But they need to show a few more classic kickoffs -kickoffs that follow touchdowns. The offense needs to run some of its slant patterns and its occasional option play right into the end zone. 
And they need to do it now. 
If the offense has just scratched the surface. it needs to start digging and the Irish need to keep dig ging until those golden hel­mets discover a golden scor­ing opportunity.

It would look more like the Irish In consecutive games during the 2000 football season, Setta proved to Notre Dame's oppo­nents that he was a threat with more than just his foot. On Nov. 11, during a 28-16 -Irish victory against Boston College, Notre Dame special teams set up for a field goal. But when Adam Tibble took the snap, he didn't hold for Setta. He pitched the ball to the Irish kicker, who ran it in five yards for a touchdown, becoming the first Irish kicker in 20 years to score a touchdown. 

The very next weekend during a 45-17 route of Rutgers, Setta thought he might try his hand at quarterback. With a shallow 7-3 lead in the first quarter, Setta took the snap and threw a 25­yard pass to Tom Lopienski and then hit the point after to give the Irish a 14-3 lead. 
"I love those kinds of things, I love those kinds of trick plays," Setta said. "It's another way to score points and it's an easier way to score more than three points. You're putting six points on the board and hopefully a seventh." 
Setta's athleticism isn't appar­ent only on the football field. In addition to his pick-up soccer games with teammates during the summer, he's out on another athletic playing surface -Notre Dame's all-weather track. 
"Nick is a little unusual, and I think he's unusual because of his total athletic performance," Willingham said. "And that includes things outside of foot­ball, you know, his track career and all of the things that he's done." 
Setta runs middle distance for the Irish. Running middle dis­tance requires two things ­speed and stamina. It's an all­out sprint, but it's not over in 10 seconds. 
"It's very difficult because you're running one of the hard­est events in terms of it being middle distance and needing a lot of training," 
Setta said. " ... You really only have one week, maybe two weeks to train." 
Despite the difficulty of com­peting against runners who train all year, as Setta says, "It's worth it." 
If it's worth it to work hard to run middle distance, then it must be worth it to work hard and run 10 yards onto the field to win one for the Irish. 
Coming through in the clutch Setta-is the player who will get it done. 
"He's the kind of kicker you need to win ballgames," Holiday said. 
At least once, that was true. When the Irish take the field on Saturday against the 
Boilermakers, memories will awaken of the last time these two faced off in a contest at Notre Dame Stadium. That image of Setta taking the field to make the game-winning score will not seem so far from reality. 
In the final seconds of the con­test, the Irish were losing 21-20 to the Boilermakers with the ball on Purdue's 21-yard line. As time ticked down to zero, Setta hit the game-winning field goal. He came through in the clutch. 
That kick was good enough to land Setta in the NBC Sports Player of the Game spot and the USAToday.com Player of the Week. Add to those honors being named the Kickoff Classic MVP and you get three places a kicker doesn't expect to find himself. 
"It's not one of those things that even comes into your mind being a kicker. You think if there's no news you did a good job because nobody's worried about you losing the game." 
But as for Setta, he said that he knows he can be the go-to guy. As a kicker, he has to be. 
"You feel that way," Setta said. " ... You have to have that atti­tude, and you have to be cocky in terms of knowing you can do this."

Willingham looks to be settling his team into his new scheme, but his offense had some self­inflicted mistakes. In addition, he may suffer under the jynx of Notre Dame coaches in second games. He needs to keep his team cool and focused on the game.  Holiday showed real poise against the Terrapins in the Irish opener. He is patient in the pocket and he is dangerous on the run. However, he did make a few mistakes and fall short when trying to score in the red zone.  Notre Dame's backfield did not prove itself against Maryland. In the first half, the Irish only had 130 rushing yards and rarely got more than two or three yards per carry. Grant and Powers­Neal looked solid in the second_ half, but have room for improvement.  Notre Dame's receivmg corps looks solid if still slightly inexperienced. Eight Irish players made catches last weekend. It remains to be seen. however, if the Irish receivers can run pat­terns different enough to throw a real defense off its game.  
Tiller has a 2-3 record against Notre Dame and has lost both times he faced the Irish in South Bend. He helped bring the West Coast offense to college foot­ball, now he has to play against it.  Orton came out with guns blazing in Purdue's open­er. After vying for the quarterback spot last year, he's settled in with confidence this season, throwing three touch­down passes and 250 yards. It was his first career victory at quarter­back.  Purdue will present a real problem for the Irish with Johnson. He fin­ished with 82 tackles last season and. according to Tiller, could be the best tackler in the Big 10 this year. He is joined by Odom and Koutouvtdes. who switched spots dur­ing spring camp.  Schweigert, the All­American. will lead the Purdue secondary. The free safety holds the school record for intercep­tions with 11. Turner and Ferrell, both with starts for the Boilermakers. will join Schweigert, who sat out Saturday's game with an injury.

BolLERMAKER RusHING BolL.ERMAKER PASSING SPECIAL TEAMS 
Notre Dame's defense completely shut down Maryland's rushing game, allowing just 16 total yards. Despite the relative inexperience of the linebackers, they've learned on the job and, to top it off, Courtney Watson should be back on the field.  Notre Dame's secondary is deadly to any passing game. Walton and Duff at cornerback go after any ball that comes their way. Against Purdue's offense, however, the Irish will have to tap into their shallow reserves. Jackson is still inexperienced.  Despite the fact that spe­ciaI teams are often behind early in the sea­son, Irish special teams are ahead. Nick Setta hit a career-long 51-yarder and remains the consis­tent point after man. Anytime the ball comes to Duff, there is a. danger that he could rurrit back.  The Irish have home-field advantage, which means a lot against a Purdue team that hasn't won in Notre Dame Stadium since 1974. In addition, the Irish are coming off of a solid win under their new coach and will be looking to give the fans a good show.  

Harris rushed for 144 yards last Saturday, 14 more than the entire Notre Dame offense com­bined. In all seven differ­ent rushers carried the ball. Tiller said he wants to limit the number of touches Harris gets to keep him fresh.  Purdue returns two of three starters from last season to the playing field. However, they are without leading receiver Stubblefield, who had a skull fracture during fall camp. Ruck and Standeford will he good opponents for Notre Dame's secondary.  All-American kicker Travis Dorsch left for the NFL, leaving a big hole for the Boilermakers to fill. Lacevic missed his first extra-point attempt of the season. Harris will be dangerous on both kick and punt returns.  Purdue is looking for revenge. The last time the Boilermakers visited South Bend, they lost in the final seconds of the game on a Setta field goal. They are coming off of a stellar offensive performance last week and looking for their first win in 28 years in Notre Dame Stadium.

KEY MATCHUP 
NOTRE DAME'S PURDUE'S DEFENSE OFFENSE 

The Irish have to pick -contain Purdue's running game or its passing game. But which one will it be? 
The Irish didn't,blitz last weekend. They left it up to their seecondary to stop the pass once it had left the quarterback's hands. Based on last week's performance, Orton is dangerous once he has released a pass. The question is whether the Irish will try to stop Orton before he throws or keep their trust in their secondary.

A year later, a year older, Orton ready to roll 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Sports Writer 
Mere hours after he finished 
leading the Boilermakers to a 
51 -10, Purdue quarterback 
Kyle Orton settled into his 
chair to watch some television. 
The game of choice· was Notre Dame-Maryland, of course. 
Orton watched Irish corner­back Shane Walton pick off three passes. He saw Notre Dame's defensive line pressure Maryland quarterbacks all day long. He turned the volume on the television down and tried to figure out how the Irish hung a shutout on Maryland. 
"They are big and strong up front, and they hit hard," the sophomore said. "They also have some guys in the sec­ondary that can make plays. They don't blitz a lot, and they trust their front four to pres­sure the quarterback and they trust their backs to shut down the pass." 
Orton watched so closely because he knew he would face that same defense a week later. And he was anxious to correct the mistakes he made last December, when the Irish and Boilermakers last faced off. 
Last year against the Irish, Orton completed only 24 of 58 passes and threw three inter­ceptions -the culminating game in a rocky season for a Purdue offense that finished 105th in the nation in offense. 
Some of Purdue's offensive struggles last season came as a result of uncertainty at the quarterback position. Throughout most of the season, Brandon Hance and Orton bat­tled to fill the void left by the graduation of Heisman Trophy finalist Drew Brees. But Hance, anointed by many as the Brees' successor, struggled for most of the season, giving Orton the chance to creep his way onto the field. 
The season culminated for Orton when he first saw signifi­cant playing time in mid­November against Michigan State and started against Indiana a week before the Notre Dame game. 
In between the loss to Notre Dame and Purdue's appear­ance in the Sun Bowl, Hance surprisingly decided to transfer to USC, leaving the relatively inexperienced Orton the unchallenged starter. Just like that, Purdue's team became Orton's team. 
Yet coaches weren't fazed. Orton. who can throw a foot­ball more than 70 yards, passed 7 4 times in a 33-27 loss to Washington State in the Sun Bowl. Heading into this season, Purdue head coach Joe Tiller said Orton has the potential to be better than Brees. 
Now. a little more than a year after he arrived on Purdue's campus, Orton is as confident as he has ever been. Against Division I-AA Illinois State, Orton completed 14 of 28 passes for 250 yards. By com­parison, last year against the Irish, Orton tossed twice as many passes yet only picked up eight more yards. 

However, he knows he still becoming a better quarterback. ue working, as time goes by, has a long way to go, and fac­"You can't just come in as a you will get better." ing a Notre Dame defense that freshman and be the best quar­returned six starters from the terback you are ever going to squad that stymied him last be," Orton said.

Irish receivers catching the spotlight at last 
By CHRIS FEDERICO 
Sports Editor 
Irish receivers are finally getting respect. And for the first time since Ron Powlus aired out floaters down the side­line to Derrick Mayes, they are drawing the attention of opponents. 
Purdue coach Joe Tiller recently com­mented on the difference he noticed in Irish receivers from a year ago. It is more than having an extra year of experience .. he said. It is having confidence. 
"I don't think there's any question they're playing with a little more confi­dence," Irish offensive coordinator Bill Diedrick said. "I think they are under­standing the system a little better. Each week they should be getting a little more confident. I think when you start under­standing, you feel confident that you can execute." 
For the first time in years, the Irish receivers have confidence in their coach­es, confidence in their system and ­most importantly -confidence in them­selves. 
..I think [our boost in confidence] goes to the offensive scheme that we have," Irish flanker Arnaz Battle said. "It's something that the coaches have brought. It's more comfortable for us to go out and make plays. It allows us to use the capa­bilities that we have to do that." 
The new West Coast scheme imple­mented by Irish head coach Tyrone Willingham and his assistants has already shown results. Notre Dame's 226 yards passing against Maryland was more than the team put up in any game last year. 
Also, Notre Dame finally has some muchneeded depth at the wide receiver position with starters Battle and Omar Jenkins, Carlos Campbell, and the fresh men Rhema McKnight and Maurice Stovall coming off the bench. Irish quar­terback Carlyle Holiday connected on passes to eight different targets last weekend. 
"I think with our team and the skill we 
have now, you can look across the board 
[for contributions]," Battle said. "We have 
dangerous guys across the board. I think 
we are. an off errse that has the ability to 
get the ball in several receivers' hands 
and make plays." 
It seems the ones that are most worried about the Irish receivers are the Notre Dame coaches. They see the team's first game against Maryland as a step in the right direction, but they realize there is 
. ...
stiIJ a long way to go. 
"I thought we were very average [last week]," Irish receivers' coach Trent Miles said. "We made a lot of mental mistakes. We had two young guys put the ball on the ground twice, and I didn't feel good about some of the routes we ran. We're not even close to having a strong perfor­mance yet. We're just very average. That was a ·c· for us." 
For a team whose returning quarter­back surpassed 100 yards passing in the final two games of last season, that "C" performance looks pretty good. 
But coaches such as Diedrick and Miles want to see continued improvement. 
"There's a ton of work still to do, a ton of work," Diedrick said. "When you look at the overall execution, I think we can always become a lot sharper. We're chal­lenging ourselves to where we have no drops and no bad throws. We want to be almost pinpoint perfect." 
With that first win on the books, the Irish have new life in a new season, and they can finally put a tumultuous 2001 and offseason behind them. 
"There's new life in everyone on the team," Jenkins said. "Everybody that steps on the field has new life -we're a completely new program. Right now we have that one game under our belts. I think anybody that goes out and plays the game can have confidence after a win."
