W NO's the 
other radio 
alternative 
Throughout the past--............~..... ­
couple of years students have complained about the state of campus radio. 
With U-93 catering to the teeny-bopper generation and WAOR catering to not-too 

classic  rock  fans,  
students are looking for  Mike Scrudato  
a station that will play  Sports Editor  
cater to their tastes.  
WVFI,  the  official  
 

campus radio, plays this kind of music, but cannot be heard in half the dorms on campus, let alone the surrounding neighborhood. 
Some people feel that 'VFI should be given the funds to move to the FM side of the dial, where it could be heard outside of LaFortune. 
Last year, this option was unsuccessfully attempted. 
There is, however, an alternative. 
The campus fine arts station, WSND, which operates out of the O'Shaughnessy bell-tower, has a spot on the FM dial (88.9) and comes in clearly around campus. 
I am not suggesting that everyone listen to classical music all day, not that there's anything wrong with that. 
But, take a listen to 'SND Sunday through Friday between midnight and 2 a.m., and you might be pleasantly surprised. 
During these hours, the fine arts station becomes "Nocturne," which is two hours of the type of things you would expect to hear from a college radio station in crystal clear FM stereo. 
Not only that, but the DJs love to take re­quests. Usually, you can have your requests played almost instantaneously. 
Some Tuesday nights, which tend to be the best nights to listen, 'SND features CD and cassette giveaways. 
Just last week a student named Matt Lamberti won a cassette just for saying he loved The Sextants. 
These two hours are arguably the best Michiana radio has to offer. 
Since WVFI-FM seems like an impossible possibility, why doesn't the University or 'SND increase the number of "Nocturne" hours? 
It doesn't have to be anything drastic, but is ten through two too much to ask? 
Despite the lack of publicity that these two hours have gotten, it is building a small, yet fanatic following. This includes the entire Notre Dame/Saint Mary's community. One Nocturne disc jockey disclosed that they usually receive an equal amount of calls from both schools. 
This increase of air time would give students that want to hear alternative (or whatever other label you want to categorize it with) music four hours of what they want. 
It still would be a lot, but it would be twice as much as is available. 
It would be far less than adequate, but even the longest of journeys begins with a single step. Listen tonight and you might just win a something.

Students advance in College Bowl 
By JOHN LUCAS News Writer 
Answering trivia questions on diverse topfcs ranging from figure skating champions to the composition of Halley's Comet to the animals of the Chinese cal­endar, four Notre Dame seniors won the campus championship of the College Bowl, America's longest running general quiz competition. 
The team of seniors Jim Shiely , Nate Citino, Mike More­land, and Rob Horton earned a trip to Earlham College in southern Indiana to compete in a regional round Feb. 6 to 8, where the squad will face com­petition from schools across the Midwest. 
"It was pretty tough, but we had a lot of fun," team captain Rob Horton said. 
Extremely popular in the 1950's, College Bowl won sev­eral Emmy Awards as a weekly television show, pitting students from different campuses against each other as part of the national tournament. 
Competing in a format similar to Jeopardy or Trivial Pursuit, College Bowl participants answer questions in a wide va­riety of areas, including sci_tlnce, literature, sports, geography and pop-culture. 
According to tournament co­ordinator Peter Lombardo, the College Bowl is made up of two parts. While the first part of the game has individuals buzzing in on electronic buzzers to answer "toss-up questions," the second part has contestants answering "bonus questions" where teams can confer among themselves before answering for higher point values. 
According to Lombardo, the College Bowl tournament has a long history at Notre Dame. 
"Notre Dame has participated from the very beginning-as early as 1953," he said. 
This year, 15 four-person teams from Notre Dame fought for the spot to compete at Earl­ham. After the regional tour­nament, the champions of the fifteen regionals and a sixteenth wild-card team will advance to the National Championship Tournament to be held April 23 to 25. 
SMC panel discussion focuses on the problems with l).S. health care 
Happy Laura! 

Congratulations on not dying for 12 months! 

By AMY K. BENNETT News Writer 
A panel discussion at Saint Mary's Monday focused on the current problems in the United States health care system. 
Business administration and economics professor Richard Measell, philosophy professor Kevin McDonnell, and nursing professor Ella Harmeyer spoke on the difficulties facing Ameri­can health care. 
Measell said one problem is the increasing amount of the gross national product going towards health care. Measell also blamed the involvement of third party payment plans and a complicated system for the large amount of money being spent.

or milk, but you go to the doctor with pain and you really have no knowledge of the problem or what the cure will be," he said. 
Harmeyer stressed the need for increased prenatal care for underprivileged patients unable to pay mounting hospital costs. She pointed out that although the United States government provides some health care programs, problems still exist. 
"We look to Britain's and Canada's programs, but when we examine our own in the United States, we find that the majority of them don't work very well," she said. 
Harmeyer said she sees Fed­erally Funded Health Centers as one of the government care programs that actually works. FFHCs can exist only in areas with a large percentage of un­derprivileged people who are required to pay only a percent­age of the cost of the care they receive. 
McDonnell spoke on health care as a religious and social is­sue. He said that in the current system in the United States, not enough is done to promote healthy lifestyles that prevent illness. 
"What we have in this country is a first-rate sick-care system. There's no better place to get sick than in the United States," McDonnell said. "Sickness care has very little to do with how long or how well we live. What we have almost nothing of is a health care system." 
McDonnell said that doctors, who are more involved with sick care than health care, are still revered. 
"We are asking things of the medical care system that I don't think medical care can deliver. Health care has little to do with doctors. Why then have we made doctors gods?" he said. "Just as priests -even good priests -cannot ensure the salvation of the members of their flocks, so doctors -even good doctors -cannot ensure the longevity of their patients."

Navajo and Hopi leaders continue a land dispute as agreement collapses 
FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) ­Clarence Blackrock has lived all his 63 years in the Cactus Val­ley-Big Mountain community on the Hopi Indian Reservation. He considers it his home, his land, his heritage. 
But Blackrock, like most of his neighbors, is a Navajo. And despite his strong religious and ancestral ties to the land, he will be forced off it unless Navajo and Hopi leaders settle their century-old dispute over use of the land. 
More than three decades of 

legal battles among the tribes and the federal government appeared on the way to resolu­tion in November when a fed­eral mediator announced a set­tlement giving the Hopis $15 million and 500,000 acres of land off the present reservation. 
But now the agreement ap­pears to have collapsed under the weight of criticism from state and local government of­ficials, white landowners, envi­ronmental and outdoor enthu­siasts and the Navajo families. 
At issue are several hundred thousand acres of high desert in 
northeastern Arizona. It is rugged, inhospitable land, scorched by the sun in the summer, bitterly cold in the winter. 
Navajo Chairman Peterson Zah says it is a poverty-stricken region of dilapidated houses where cold, rain and snow find their way inside. There are few paved roads, no running water. Schools and social services are either inadequate or nonexis­tent. 
But Blackrock and the 250 or so Navajo families who occupy the land are unwilling to leave. 
Slovakia elects first president 
BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) -Parliament elected Michal Kovac, a former banker, as Slovakia's first president on Monday, breaking a deadlock that had threatened to destabilize the newly independent country. 
Kovac was the last speaker of Czechoslovakia's federal parliament before the country split peacefully into Czech and Slovak states on Jan. 1. 
Parliament had failed in two tries last month to choose a head of state when none of four candidates won the necessary three-fifths majority. 
Kovac, the only candidate in Monday's vote, won 106 votes in the 150-member parliament, 16 more than the three-fifths needed. 
Kovac, 62, said his election was an "an important signal" of Slovak unity. "We have to increase the credibility of Slovakia in the world," said the president-elect, who will be sworn in on March 3 for a five-year term. 
Kovac was the nominee of Premier Vladimir Meciar's governing Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, a party Kovac helped found.

creased so much, beyond my earlier estimates. beyond even the worst estimates from last year." 
Promising to spread the pain among all, Clinton said 70 per­cent of the taxes he would pro­pose "fall on the shoulders of those who make more than $100,000 a year." An adminis­tration official said Clinton meant that seven out of 10 of the higher taxes would affect the wealthy -not that they would pay 70 percent of the additional burden. 
The payoff from his plan, Clinton promised, will be

There is a six month time period between the time the application is pro­cessed and the actual arrival of the quilt. 
"If all goes well, we will be able to display the quilt in the earlier part of the fall semester," Seager explained.

attention, said Barlett. He said that such government efforts as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollins legislation of 1987, which was supposed to destroy the deficit by 1991, have not been suc­cessful. 
He also referred to the falseness of Bush's claim that because of the budget reforms, the deficit would be eliminated by 1995. "The numbers were 

"millions of long-term, good­paying jobs, including a pro­gram to jumpstart our economy with another 500,000 jobs in 1993 and 1994." 
Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole delivered a crisp response to Clinton's address, expressing skepticism that the administration was cutting spending far enough before asking for more taxes. 
"We've both heard lots of speeches about 'sacrifice,' but we'll be working with you to make certain that sacrifice isn't just a presidential code word for more taxes, more spending and more mandates from Washington," Dole said. "That's the kind of sacrifice that will break the back of middle-class America, and lead us right into 
I his could take up a substan­tial amount of time, but wouldn't it be worth it?," she added. 
Seager sees NAMES as a bridge between Notre Dame and the South Bend community. 
"This would be the largest AIDS awareness project to hit. the South Bend area," she said. "This is not only a Notre Dame project, but a community wide project. We need to collectively come together and make this as successful as possible." 
Flynn and Seager hope to see a commemoration celebrated around the arrival of the quilt, complete with a mass, tables of materials, videos and speakers. 
still going the wrong way," he said. 
Reforms in health care, too, are needed, said Barlett. "What kind of civil society makes health care a lottery?" He criticized the present sys­tem, saying that a person who works for a company with health care "wins," whereas someone whose employer does not have insurance "loses." 
Barlett and Steele have won two Pulitzer prizes and have won the George Orwell award from the National Council of Teachers of English two times.

economic ruin." 

Clinton's plan envisions roughly $500 billion in tax in­creases and spending reduc­tions on many popular pro­grams over four years to cut the deficit. Big corporations and wealthy Americans face significant boosts in their in­come tax rates. 
One part that will· affect all Americans is a broad-based energy tax, based on the heat content of fuels, including elec­tricity, coal, oil, natural gas and gasoline. Clinton has said the heat-content approach would be more progressive than a tax based strictly on sales. 
The Oval Office appearance was part of a public relations blitz to overcome resistance in Congress and among the public. 
I h1s could be one of the biggest things for Notre Dame next year," said Flynn. "I have a positive feeling about this, but we need help." 
Seager will have an informa­tional meeting for students Wednesday at 6 p.m. in the din­ning room of the health services building. 

GOP leaders were sharpening their opposition in advance. Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said that "when Democrats say 'sacrifice,' they really mean 
'taxes.~ 

Warning that special interests will try to kill his plan, Clinton said, "Those who have profited from the status quo will oppose changes we make, every step of the way. They've already lined the corridors of power with high-priced lobbyists. They are the defenders of decline, but we are the architects of the future." 
Senate Majority Leader Ge­orge Mitchell said he hoped people wouldn't rush to judg­ment on Clinton's program. 
"I emphasized that while it's not likely that any one of us will agree with every single point in his economic program, it has to be viewed as a whole," he told reporters at an AFL-CIO meet­ing in Florida.

Kevorkian helps thirteenth person to commit suicide 
ROSEVILLE, Mich. (AP) -Dr. Jack Kevorkian helped a 70­year-old invalid kill himself Monday by inhaling carbon monoxide. He was Kevorkian's 13th assisted suicide.

Living wills 
invalid for 
pregnant 

AP) -Plan all you want. The soul searching and sense that goes into a living will is all for nought in most states if a woman is pregnant when it is needed. 
Only Arizona and New Jersey ask women to indicate in their living wills what medical treat­ment they would want should they become hopelessly co­matose or be declared brain­dead while they are pregnant. 
In 23 states, a woman's re­quest not to be kept on life­support is invalidated if she's pregnant, no matter the stage of her pregnancy. 
Nancy Klein didn't have a liv­ing will when a car accident in 1988 left her comatose while she was pregnant. She agrees with her husband's decision to get her an abortion because doctors said it would improve her chances of recovering. 
"I don't think a woman should be forced to be an incubator," she said over the weekend from her home in Florida. 
All 50 states and the District of Columbia have laws allowing advance directives on medical care. They provide either for a living will, which indicates a choice for life-sustaining health care should a person become unable to make such decisions, or through medical proxy, which names someone else to make such a choice. 
A survey by the Center for Women Policy Studies found 12 of those don't address preg­nancy, making it likely courts would decide the matter. 
Twenty-three states automat­ically invalidate a woman's liv­ing will at any stage of preg­nancy, it said. 
Four other states invalidate advance directives if the fetus 
is viable, generally considered sometime in the second trimester.

BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) ­Two car bombs shattered a busy downtown district Mon­day, killing four people and in­juring more than 120 as glass rained from skyscrapers and survivors groped through thick smoke. 
Twenty cars were destroyed and dozens of stores were severely damaged. Windows were broken in an area about a half-mile square, AP photogra­pher Ricardo Mazalan said at the scene. 
Smoke cut visibility to a few yards at both bomb sites, which were about eight blocks apart. The injured stumbled around blindly, crying out for help. Others ran about screaming as they searched for loved ones 

Two stabbed in Jerusalem 
.IEHUSALEM (AP)-An Arab stabbed to death a man and wounded a woman today in an attack on Jews waiting at a Jerusalem bus stop, police and hospital officials said. 
The 64-year-old father of the slain man suffered a head in­jury when he fell while trying to help fend off the attacker, hospital officials and radio re­ports said. 
Jerusalem police commander Rafi Peled told Israel radio that the attack occurred at about 
6:00 a.m. in the Jewish neighborhood of Armon Hanaziv, which borders the city's Arab district. 
Moshe Mizrachi, the slain man's father, said the attacker shouted something in Arabic that he could not understand.

and friends, Mazalan said. 
No one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombings, but a government official charged they were planted by drug traffickers. President Ce­sar Gaviria blamed recent bombings on fugitive drug lord Pablo Escobar, who is fighting a government crackdown. 
The police and army set up scores of roadblocks throughout this city of 6 million people, apparently to try to catch those responsible. 
Both bombs, estimated by police at about 150 pounds each, exploded at mid-morning as hundreds of people jammed downtown sidewalks. 
The first detonated a few yards from a municipal court­house, killing two people. 
The assailant, described as about 25 years old, was seen fleeing toward the adjacent Arab neighborhoods of Jebel Mukaber and Sur Baher by a bus driver who fired two shots in his direction, Peled added. 
"We imposed a curfew on the two (Arab) neighborhoods in order to find the assailant," Peled said, adding that extra police and a helicopter were called in to help in the search. 
Curfews, employed by the army in the occupied territo­ries, are rarely used in Jerusalem. City spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said 19 Arabs were rounded up for questioning. 
On Sunday night, two Israelis were shot and wounded when fired on while driving home.

Lithuanians elect an ex-Communist leader 
VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) ­Fed up with economic hard­ships, Lithuanians overwhelm­ingly elected former Communist Party chief Algirdas Brazauskas in their first direct presidential vote, unofficial results showed Monday. 
Brazauskas received 1,210,517 votes, or 60 percent of those cast Sunday. Anti­Communist intellectual Stasys Lozoraitis, who spent 50 years in exile in the West and now is Lithuania's ambassador in Washington, drew 767,345 votes, or 38 percent. 
More than three-quarters of the 2.55 million eligible voters cast ballots. 
Final results were expected Wednesday, but election offi­cials in this Baltic nation said the outcome was assured. 
The strapping, jovial Brazauskas has remained pop­ular since the fall of Commu­nism because -like Russian President Boris Yeltsin -he is a maverick who rose to the top

of the ruling party and then broke away. 
"Had the candidate for president been a real Commu­nist, the people would not have voted for him. The pnople know better," Brazauskas told re­porters after his victory. 
He has promised to restore order to the crumbling econ­omy and raise living standards, which have fallen since Lithuania won independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. 
Brazauskas said Monday that he would continue to convert state businesses to ownership and "clear away all obstacles" to foreign invest­ment. 
But Lozoraitis said in conced­ing defeat he Brazauskas would make cos­metic changes instead of a ma­jor economic restructuring. 
Lozoraitis, 68, who ran as independent, said Brazau and his advisers "don't have slightest idea what the West is."

Jackson may organize a national hunger strike 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The Rev. Jesse Jackson threatened Monday to organize a hunger strike in the United States un­less the Clinton administration allows HIV-infected Haitians into this country. 
Jackson, who began a per­sonal hunger strike Sunday, emerged from a meeting with White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty saying he supported Clinton's Haitian policy, but he wants action within a week. 
He also met with Hillary Rodham Clinton and discussed his views on the nation's health care system -the focus of Mrs. Clinton's work in the west wing of the White House. Jackson came away impressed. 
"It was a very good meeting in my judgment. She is sensitive to a broad range of concerns." 
The civil right leader recently returned from the Guantanamo Navy base in Cuba, where he joined HIV-infected Haitians on a hunger strike to pressure Clinton to lift the ban on their entry. 

He also urged Clinton to move faster to restore deposed Haitian President Jean-Ber­trand Aristide and end a naval blockade meant to discourage mass migration from the Caribbean nation. 
''I'm going to continue (the hunger strike) for at least a week and if at end of the week there has been no shift of pol­icy, I will have to consider ex­panding the number of people involved," Jackson said. 
He said the expanded strike could involve "other leaders and other organizations that have been involved in the pro­cess." 
Clinton said last week that he wants to reverse the immigra­tion policy that bars HIV-in­fected people from entering the country. 


Handling of Tyson case attacked by his lawyer 
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -A judge who kept key witnesses from testifying and blocked the introduction of important evidence allowed Mike Tyson to be wrongly convicted of rape, his lawyer argued Monday in appealing for a new trial. 
"We want a new trial in which all the evidence can be presented to a jury," attorney Alan Dershowitz told a group of law students after two hours of argument before a three­judge appeals panel. 
The Indiana Court of Appeals panel is not expected to rule on the request for at least two months, court officials said. 
Inside the state Supreme Court chamber, where the hearing was moved to accommodate scores of 
reporters and spectators, Dershowitz headed a defense team that attacked Superior Court Judge Patricia J. Gifford's handling of the case. 
Gifford denied a jury the necessary tools of evidence by blocking testimony from three defense witnesses and refusing jurors a chance to consider whether his accuser had consented to sex, the former heavyweight boxing champion's lawyers said. 
"It is obvious if they had these tools, they would have acquitted Mike Tyson," said Nathan Dershowitz, another defense attorney and the brother of Alan. 
But prosecutor Lawrence M. Reuben said there wasn't a legal basis for an appeal. 
"This appeal is not about re­weighing evidence, as the defense would have you do," he said. 
Neither Tyson, who is serving a six-year prison term, nor his accuser, Desiree Washington, attended the hearing.

Senator P~or rips drug companies · . }
WASHING ON-Sen. David Pryor. D·Ark. an outspoken critic of prescription drug costs, said Monday he will seek to · repeal a major tax break for drug companies and other industries with manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico. Pryor said Section 936 of the tax code has become "nothing but a gigantic tax windfall for the pharmaceutical industry" costing the Treasury $3 billion a year. He proposed replacing it with a far less generous credit based on the actual wages the manufacturers pay workers on the island rather than their profits. The drug industry defended the tax credit, claiming its incentives account for one-third of the 900,000 jobs in Puerto Rico. 
Labor unions vow to support Clinton 
BAL HARBOUR-Organized labor's top official said today unions would support President Clinton's economic proposal, but he left open the possibility that some of the proposed tax increases would meet with objections. Asked specific whether labor would support an energy tax as part of Clinto prescription for reducing the deficit, Lane Kirkland, president ()f the AFL-CIO, said unions favored the general concept of raising taxes, but he avoided commenting on an energy .tax. "We know that there has to be, as well as restraint on spending, there has to be revenue coming in," he said. "Our members are prepared 

to pay their fair share." 
VIENNA, Austria (AP)­OPEC's major producers floated ideas today for ending a stalemate with Kuwait over cuts in the cartel's surging produc­tion in the spring. 
Saudi Arabia's influential oil minister, Hisham Nazer, met with OPEC president Alirio Parra of Venezuela over the gridlock. 
Kuwait has so far refused to go along with an effort by the 12-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to reduce output and keep crude prices from tumbling in the spring when demand for oil falls. 
The cartel's failure to get a quick agreement over the weekend caused oil prices in Asia and Europe to fall some. 
"The problem is OPEC over­promised, indicating they could wrap this up very quickly," said Paul Mlotok, head of energy research at Morgan Stanley in New York. "So now that they 

...·..... 
haven't, people are disap­pointed." 
Kuwait refused late Sunday to give in to demands for produc· tion restraint in the coming months. It argued that it should be exempted from cutbacks be­cause of the billions in damage oil industry suffered under Iraqi occupation. 
But Saudi Arabia, Iran, Nige­ria and others contend that Kuwait must make sacrifices as well to try to get prices higher. 
Some delegates appeared angry at Kuwait's insistence on special treatment. Nigerian of­ficials said they need oil rev· enues as much as anybody be· cause of difficult economic problems. 
Prices are running more than $3 a barrel under the group's target of $21 a 42-gallon barrel. They' have strengthened some in recent weeks on expectations of cutbacks. 
The producers fear they could tumble even more in the spring 

Poverty threatens illegal workers 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Thou­sands of people work for cash -washing dishes, harvesting vegetables, cleaning homes and office buildings. But when they retire from the nation's underground economy, there may be no monthly Social Se­curity check to protect them from poverty. 
It's not clear how many em­ployers fail to pay Social Secu­rity taxes for their workers, although the issue is the subject of an Internal Revenue Service study. But there are signs it is a sizeable number. 
The IRS estimated in 1991 that only one-fourth of an esti­mated 2 million household em­ployers filed the required tax forms for their workers. 
And a Social Security Admin­istration official told congres­sional investigators that 1989 data showed farm employers were at least three times as likely as other employers to fail to report or to under-report their workers' earnings. 
Experts say thousands of workers could wind up in poverty when they retire be­cause their employers failed to report some -or any -of their earnings to the govern­ment. Social Security retire­ment benefits are based on a worker's lifetime, reported earnings. 

when demand for crude dries up with warmer weather. 
At the urging of Saudi Arabia, the nations agreed to pare a million barrels a day off their winter supply cap of 24.6 mil­lion barrels a day. Actual output is running about 500,000 bar­rels a day above that. 
One delegate, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said all nations favor a new production level of 23.5 million to 23.6 mil· lion barrels a day in coming months. 
"Everybody thinks that's the right ceiling -everybody with­out exception," he said. 
But the producers cannot agree on how to share out any cuts and the cartel is under pressure to come up with a credible arrangement. 
The OPEC nations have ig­nored so many past pledges of cutbacks that the price-setting oil markets will be doubtful about any new promises. 
"There is an awful lot of cheating going on." says Dan Schulder, legislative director for the National Council of Senior Citizens. "It's scandalous." 
Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and Zoe Baird, President Clinton's first nominee for attorney general, called atten­tion to the situation when they acknowledged they had not paid Social Security taxes for their domestic help. 
But other occupations ­farmworkers, day-laborers, janitors, restaurant and hotel help, some construction work­ers -are also affected by em­ployers who fail to pay taxes on their workers' earnings. Many are immigrants, people of color, or people who don't speak English, experts say. 
"It's a class issue as well as a racial issue," Schulder says. "It's one of the messy, dirty little secrets of our society." 
Under the law, an employer who pays a worker more than $50 in any quarter of the year also owes Social Security and Medicare taxes. The employer and the employee each are re­quired to pay 7.65 percent of wages, although some employ­ers pay the full amount. 
It takes roughly 10 years in the work force to qualify for a Social Security pension, and lesser time to qualify for disability or survivor's benefits. The maximum monthly retirement .benefit for an individual is $1,128 and the average check is $653. 
Social Security used to pay a minimum benefit of $122 a month. but the Reagan admin­istration and Congress elimi­nated that in a cost-cutting move in the early 1980s. 
The biggest checks go to middle-and upper-income workers. But the benefit for­mula actually is skewed to pro­vide a more generous return to low-wage workers in compari­son to taxes paid. 
A full-time worker who re· tired this year at 65 after a life­time of minimum wage work would qualify for a monthly So­cial Security check of $496. 
Low-income retirees or dis­abled workers may also qualify for Supplemental Security In­come (SSI), a welfare program. But the benefits, even when combined with food stamps, often are not enough to pull someone out of poverty. 
"There's no doubt about the fact that people on SSI are the poorest of the poor," says Arthur Flemming, chairman of the Save our Security Coalition. "They have to decide each day whether to spend the small amount of cash that they have for food or housing or clothing." 
"Irish Impact" poster to benefit homeless 
By NANCY FENOCKETTI 
Business Writer 
"Irish Impact," a poster whose proceeds will benefit the South Bend Center for the Homeless, will be on sale be­ginning Junior Parents' Week­end. 
The marketing of the 22"x34" horizontal full-color poster of this past season's Penn State football game upset was the work of Molly O'Neill, outgoing student body vice-president, and its photographer, Bill Mowle, managing editor of the Dome. 
For the past three years, Mowle's hobby has been taking pictures of the games. This particular one struck him as something special. 
He approached O'Neill and Lou Nanni, director of the Center for the Homeless, after break with an idea. "I just showed both of them the pic­ture and they both became very excited about the potential for the poster," Mowle said. 
"The neatest thing about it is that it's pure football," said O'Neill. Unlike most Notre Dame memorabilia that focuses on a standout player, the picture of at least five Irishmen and five Nittany lions "symbolizes team effort," she said. 
Mowle chose the title Irish Impact. "When you look at the poster, it sums it up in two words: it's Notre Dame, and it's a collision," said Mowle. 
O'Neill approved. They didn't want it to be "anything offen­sive to Penn State." The title conveys that the game is a "gentlemen's rivalry," O'Neill said. 
Both Mowle and O'Neill wanted the poster to be a fundraiser for the Center for the Homeless. "It's a great way to support a project that em­powers people to get out of the position they're in," said Mowle. 
"The Center not only feeds and clothes the homeless, but also educates the guests," said Mowle. Because it's having fi­nancial problems and "can't guarantee the amounts of do­nations, this will help them meet their budget," said O'Neill. Altogether, they hope to raise $50,000 for the cause. 
The poster, which will cost $10 (or $15 if ordered through Center for the Homeless,) will be on sale starting this Friday in the center, student dorms and at the information desk at LaFortune. Saturday, fans can purchase posters from 12pm to 4pm in the LaFortune O'Hara lounge or at the Alumni Legacy Reception in the concourse of the JACC from 4pm to 5pm. 
With Hall Presidents' Council initially financing the project, 5,000 will be released for sale this weekend. O'Neill and Mowle expect there to be de­mand for even more than that. According to Mowle, "early re­sponse from class council has been really positive." 
Fans eager to get a glimpse of the poster full-size before this weekend can view it either in the Student Government office on the second floor of LaFortune or at a press confer­ence this Thursday. Lou Holtz will unveil the poster at 11am at the Center for the Homeless on 813 South Michigan Ave.

Saint Mary's sophomore Kristy Schinderle combines studies with acareer in real estate 
By CASEY HALL 
Accent Writer 
E 
very once in a while, someone with initiative and desire can accomplish something out of the ordinary. Saint Mary's sophomore Kristy Schinderle, an accredited real estate 
agent. is a person who . 
possesses such qualities. 
Schinderle, a Business Ad­
ministration major, holds a 
real estate license in her 
home town of Newaygo, 
Michigan at the Lyda Real 
Estate, Inc. office. 
Schinderle explained that she became involved in real estate as a result of a summer job at the Lyda Real Estate office. Hired as a personal assistant to the office broker, Schinderle spent a lot of time writing ads, helping with the office upkeep, and talking to many of the office's clients. 
There were times, 
Schinderle explained, that her 
young age and inexperience 
in dealing with the public 
made her feel naive when 
talking with clients. 
"At times I felt ignorant on 
the phone as people asked me about homes they had seen, prices, or the area," she said, "and I didn't have the knowl­edge to answer their ques­tions." 
Schinderle's determination to become a real estate agent helped her to overcome this initial lack of knowledge. With her own funds and the support of her parents, she

She enrolled in a 40-hour real estate class that "focused on the financial part of the said. Yet with the support of her parents, the office broker at Lyda, and her fellow agents, Kristy has developed a wide range of skills and knowledge, she said. 

Despite the distance between Saint Mary's and home, Schinderle maintains close contact with her office. She explained that while her broker manages her daily business, she checks in weekly with her clients to ensure they are doing well and that they are satisfied. 
Most of Schinderle's business comes from middle­aged families. "I get a lot of my business from walk-ins, telemarketing, and word of mouth," she said. 
Right now Schinderle is working toward a degree in Business Administration with a concentration in finance and marketing. Schinderle hopes real estate can serve as a foundation to sales and marketing as it has helped refine her communication skills. Following graduation, she hopes to "look into the financial end of real estate and expand on the knowledge I already have." 
Schinderle would like to maintain her real estate li­cense, regardless of what she decides to do after graduation. Even though this may require additional training and funds, Schinderle believes it is well worth the financial cost. "If I wanted to," she said, "I could make my life in real estate."

Despite turnovers, poor shooting Tulane wins 18th 
NEW ORLEANS (AP) -If a coach can be embarrassed by a ictory, Tulane's Perry Clark 
had plenty of reason to blush. 
The Green Wave knocked off Canisius 63-41 Monday night despite turning the ball over 18 times and hitting only 28 of 66 field· goal attempts. including 2 of 15 3-pointers. 
"Boy it wasn't pretty," Clark said. "If fact I thought we might have to send the kids home. I was worried it would be R­rated it was so ugly." 
"We were just flat coming off the Louisville game," Clark said. "The kids hung in there and did what they had to do, but I don't think I've ever seen them as flat as they were." 
Tulane beat Metro Conference leader Louisville 62-60 on 
ursday night. 


Carlin Hartman was Tulane's gh scorer with 15 points, and 
e did it against a school from his own hometown. 
"I always want to come out 
and play hard," said Hartman, ho is from Buffalo, N.Y. "I 
ew the home crowd would be 
stening to this and that helped me get up for it. We were all 
tired, though." 
The Green Wave (18-4) fell behind 10·2 as they failed to score a basket in the opening 5:55, but they came back to take a 33-19 halftime lead and were comfortably ahead throughout the second half. 
"The ball just wouldn't go through the hoop," said LeWI­dro Simmons. "It was like we couldn't find it all of a sudden." 
Canisius (8-14) hit only 30 percent of its field goal at­tempts. 
Each team turned the ball over 18 times. 
The first three minutes of the game signalled the type of night Tulane would have. The 
turned the ball over three times, picked up two fouls, missed two baskets and two free throws, prompting Clark to send in his second team dubbed "The Posse." 
The backups couldn't come up with a sharpshooter, however, and finished the half shooting under 44 percent. 
Canlsius, meanwhile, wen through a 5:39 dry spell in which its 12·2 lead became 19-13 deficit. 
Simmons had 11 points fo Tulane and Hartman had 12 rebounds. 
..1 don't think we'll be this flat for another game," Simmons said. "It was really frustrating." 
Craig Wise led Canisius with 18 points and 10 rebounds.

Two juniors take different routes to NFL 
INDIANAPOLIS (APJ -Wide 
receivers Sean Dawkins of Cali­
forn.f and Southern Cal's Curtis 
Conway, two juniors who 
decided to skip their senior year 
of eli.gibility, took different 
paths to the NFL. 
Both were at the NFL Scouting 
Combine that ended Monday, 
but only Dawkins worked out in 
the Hoosier Dome for 
representatives of the 28 teams. 
'Tm glad to have the oppor­
tunity to come in and impress 
people with my skills and per­
sonality," said Dawkins, who set 
school records for catches, 
receiving yards and touchdowns 
this past season. "For the most 
part, scouts haven't gotten a 
real good look at me and most 
of them haven't even seen film 
of me playing." 
Conway, however, decided to 
have the scouts do their eval­
uating at a later date in Cali­
fornia. 
'I feel this was a good oppor­
tunity for them to get a look at 
me. Each player here has to 
make their own decision on 
this," Dawkins said. "Mine was 
to work out. But, I don't dis­
agree with someone who de­
cided to wait. Either way, all the 
teams that are interested in you 
SMU fires, hires football coaches 
DALLAS (APJ -Southern Methodist coach Tom Rossley fired three assistant coaches and hired four more on Monday in an off-season shakeup of the Mustangs football team. 
Rossley hired Tommy Adams, defensive line, who spent the last eight seasons as an assis­tant at Sam Houston State; David Knaus, linebackers, who was the defensive coordinator at Appalachian State the past four years; Bill Maskill, defen­sive assistant, who was an as­sistant at Wake Forest the past three seasons; and Vincent White, receivers, the offensive coordinator at the University of the Pacific. 
Dismissed were Rusty Russell, Mike Washburn and Curtis Jones. A fourth coach, Tim Lewis, defensive backs coach for the last four years, resigned to take a similar position at Pittsburgh. 
"This group brings excep­tional talent and experience to SMU," Rossley said. "The fact that we were able to attract such high quality coaches is a credit to our program. I'm very optimistic about our future." 
SMU was 5-6 last year, includ­ing its first two conference vic­tories since it was given the death penalty by the NCAA in 1987.

will be checking us again." 
Dawkins has been planning for his trip since becoming one of 37 underclas'smen to declare themselves eligible for the draft in January. 
'Tve been running with the track coaches, working on weights and technique, every­thing I could possibly do," he said. 
Conway said he decided to skip the workout because of a strained knee sustained in his final collegiate game. 
"It's fine now, but it's just not as strong as I want it to be," said Conway, a collegiate sprinter who left the Trojans with school records for most kickoff returns (73) and kickoff return yards (1, 723) -marks that had been held by Anthony Davis. ''I'm going to go back home and continue to run, get my strength back up." 
Conway, who has run the 40 in 4.25, averaged 16.1 yards each time he touched the ball last season and scored touchdowns four different ways -receiving, rushing, kickoff return and punt return -and also threw two scoring passes. 
"My versatility, I think, makes me a valuable player. I can help 
Courier tries for third title 
PHILADELPHIA (AP) -Jim Courier tries for his third con­secutive title this week, but will have to face the likes of Pete Sampras, Michael Chang and Ivan Lendl to succeed. 
Courier, the world's top­ranked player, comes into the $700,000 U.S. Indoor after victories at the Australian Open and at Memphis, Tenn. There on Sunday, Courier edged Todd Martin 5-7, 7-'6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-4) to win the Kroger-St. Jude In­ternational. 
In two previous appearances in Philadelphia, Courier has not advanced past the quarterfi­nals. 
Sampras, the No. 2 player in the world and a friend of Courier, is a two-time champion here and lost in the 1991 final to Lendl. Chang defeated both Courier and Sampras during a career-high 15-match winning streak last March that included wins at Indian Wells, Calif., and Key Biscayne, Fla. 
a team in many ways and my speed helps me a lot," said Conway, who led USC with 49 receptions for 764 yards and had 1,822 all-purpose yards in 1992. "Once I get the ball, my vision of the field helps me a lot." 
Both are expected to be early picks in the April 25-26 draft, giving depth to a position that some scouts say was weak until the juniors entered the mix. 
"I don't think we compare," Conway said of Dawkins. "He's one type of receiver and I'm another.... He's a great re­ceiver. When we were on de­fense, I'd sit back and watch him. He's a great athlete. A lot of people think that he's slow, but I think he can run with the ball. The big thing is I think I'm shiftier than him." 
Both are certain they made the right decision in giving up Pac-10 play for the NFL. Both are resigned to not earning as much money as recent top picks due to limits on spending on this year's draftees as part of the new labor agreement. 
"I kind of knew it was going to happen. I've been following up 
Courier won five tournaments 
in the first half of last year, in­
cluding the Australian and the 
French, but failed to win a title 
the rest of the year. 

"I think the way he played the 
first six months of last year was 
unbelievable," Sampras said in 
a telephone interview last week 
from Tampa, Fla. "During the 
summer and the fall, I think he 
was a little bit burned out. It 
was tough to maintain that level 
of tennis the whole year." 
Sampras sees himself as a 
more casual and easygoing 
player than Courier. "You can 
see it in his eyes," he said. "He's 
much more intense, much more 
driven." 

Courier's success has a lot to do with his hard work, Sampras said. "Obviously, I still work hard," he said. "But Jim's running after his matches, practicing. I think he feels like he needs to do that just to stay on top."

Jarrett wins one his father didn't 
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP)­Dale Jarrett filled a page his father left empty in the family album with his victory in the Daytona 500. 
For Dale Earnhardt, it was another Daytona 500 to forget. 
.Jarrett battled in the lead pack of cars over the final 27 green-flag laps Sunday and outdueled Earnhardt, a five-time NASCAR champion and one of its fiercest competitors. Earnhardt did everything but win-again. 
By denying Earnhardt, Jarrett put a big smile on the face of his father, two-time NASCAR champion and now CBS com­mentator Ned Jarrett. 
Ned Jarrett called the final lap as his son took the checkered flag that he -like Earnhardt-never got in NASCAR's most prestigious event. 
"Super job there, Dale. I tell you, I'm really proud of you." Ned Jarrett told his son over a network headset. 
The son thanked his father and advised him that Ned's near-miss when he ran out of gas while leading the 1963 Daytona 500 with two laps re­maining had been avenged.

"You came so close ... " Dale said. "I got this one for you and all the family." 
Jarrett gave Washington Red­skins coach Joe Gibbs his first victory as a NASCAR team owner to open the team's sec­ond year. Jarrett's only other Winston Cup victory came in 1991 with another team. 
.Jarrett was running third and Geoff Bodine fourth with two laps left when Jarrett took mat­ters into his own hands. He passed rookie Jeff Gordon on lap 199 and went after Earn­hardt. 
·-Jarrett caught Earnhardt and the Chevrolet drivers battled side-by-side, touching briefly and reaching the start-finish line for the last lap in a dead heat.. 
"You race Dale Earnhardt like he races you," Jarrett said. "I felt like there'd be nothing less than a slight tap coming." 
Jarrett edged in front and pulled away on the backstretch. Earnhardt couldn't catch him. 
The difference was less than two car-lengths and a winner's purse of $238,200 for Jarrett to $181,825 for Earnhardt, now winless in 15 Daytona 500 
is~:~·nhardt led 11 times for 107 of the 200 laps while Jar­rett led three times for eight 

laps. The official margin of vic­tory was 0.19 seconds. 
"We've lost this race about every way you can lose it," said Earnhardt, who has finished out of the top 10 only four times in this race. "We've been out­gassed, out-tired, outrun, out­everythinged. 
"We've come close, but we'e not won it about every way you can't win it. I guess all that's left to do now is to come back next year and try to win it any way we can." 
He said Jarrett had the strongest engine. 
"I was hoping he couldn't get past Bodine and Gordon and some of those other guys," Earnhardt said. 
Geoff Bodine finished third and Hut Stricklin fourth in Fords, followed by Gordon in a Chevy. 
Gordon, 21, on Thursday had become the youngest driver and second rookie ever to win a Daytona qualifying race. He tucked in behind Earnhardt as both passed Jarrett on lap 179 and stayed there until the win-ner's move. 
Into the last lap Gordon chose to go behind Earnhardt. 
"Nine out of 10 times, the right one would be to go with Dale (Earnhardt)," Gordon said. "It didn't work out." 
Earnhardt's move for position on lap 157 effectively weeded out some of his toughest com­petition. Until then, any of about a dozen cars seemed in the thick of the race.

Penguins still successful without Lemieux College coaches meet, discuss 
PITTSBURGH (AP) -OK, so the Pittsburgh Penguins won't go undefeated after the All-Star game, and they'll even allow some goals. No matter their 37­15-5 record and league-leading 79 points, they're not perfect after all. 
But if the rest of the NHL hoped to capitalize on Mario Lemieux's illness to gain parity with the Penguins, they've re­ceived a thousand-volt jolt. 
With Lemieux, the Penguins are the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions. With­out Lemieux, the Penguins are a team that could contend for yet another cup, as their 8-3-1 record in their last 12 games would indicate. 
"What they're doing says a lot for them -and doesn't bode well for the rest of us," Chicago Blackhawks defenseman Keith Brown said. 
That fact hasn't been lost on general manager Craig Patrick, who's usually ready about this time of the season to pull off a trade. He did it two years ago by dealing for Ulf Samuelsson in early March; he did it last February by trading for Rick Tocchet. 
If Patrick makes another pre­playoffs trade this season, don't look for it to include headline names. The Penguins' 9-6-1 record without Lemieux and recent club-record scoreless streak signify these Pens are a 
-
championship-caliber team even without the league's best player. 
"This team has too much tal­ent not to win," said goaltender Tom Barrasso, who may be having his best NHL season de­spite a month-long bout with chickenpox. "There are way too many perfectionists in this room to accept mediocrity." 
Check the standings: the Penguins are 17 points ahead of second-place Washington in the Patrick Division. Check the defense: their goals-against av­erage is down more than a goal per game from a year ago. Check the intangibles. 
Last season, the Pens were barely above mediocre in the regular season before eliminat­ing the NHL's two best-record teams -Washington and the 
New York Rangers  - in the  
opening  two  rounds  of the  
playoffs.  

Even two years ago, when they won their first regular­season division championship, the Penguins didn't transform themselves into Stanley Cup contenders until late in the sea­son .

protesting Campanelli firing 

' 
 
 

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -The board of directors of the National Association of Basket­ball Coaches met by phone for 1 1/2 hours Monday, talking about how and whether to protest the firing of California coach Lou Campanelli. 
With a 10-7 record and a young, promising team, Cam­panelli was unexpectedly dis­missed last week. 
"Our hope at this time is to is­sue a statement Tuesday," Jim Haney, NABC executive direc­tor, said. "This firing of coaches at mid-season is an issue that we have to address. There have been four so far this year in Division I, and we understand two more have not been announced. 
"In this particular case, there are a couple of bases left for us to touch before we say any­thing." 
The NABC is powerless to stop the firing ot coaches, who an­swer to the chief executive offi­cer at each school. But the coaches' group, trying to take a more active, public role, could bring embarrassment with its 
 


command of widespread media attention. 
"We're very sensitive to the fact that the presidents have the authority to make decisions, whether we like the decisions or not," Haney said. "We're trying to get a sense for what happened and how it happened and develop an appropriate response. The broader issue of coaches being fired in-season is a great concern." 
Campanelli, who signed point guard Jason Kidd, one of the most highly sought prospects in the nation last year, won 19 or more games in four of his first five seasons. 
"The biggest thing we're in total agreement on is that the guy wasn't given any hearing before they fired him," said Iowa State coach Johnny Orr, president of the NABC. "On the 24th of January he got a phone call from the chancellor con­gratulating him on the good job he was doing. He got a letter from the guy who fired him saying good job, keep it up. Then two weeks later they fire the guy."

Hrudey's 43 saves help snap King's 7 game losing streak 
INGLEWOOD, Calif. (API ­Slumping goalie Kelly Hrudey was at his acrobatic best with 43 saves and Jari Kurri trig­gered a three-goal third period Monday as the Los Angeles Kings ended a seven-game winless streak with a 3-0 vic­tory over Vancouver. 
NHL capsules 
The NIIL's sPcond-most pro­ductiVf~ ofl'ense was blanked for the first time since losing con­secutive shutouts in December 1991 at Edmonton and Quebec. It was the second shutout by llrudny this season and the 15th of his career, and it snapped a personal live-game winless streak. 
The Kings had allowed 29 goals in their last three games. 
After Vancouver's Kirk McLean stopped the Kings' first 27 shots. Los Angeles scored all three goals in less than five minutes for its first victory since Jan. 26 against San Jose. 
Kurri snapped the scoreless tie at 4:42 with his z:~rd goal, tying Bryan Trottier for 14th place on the career goal-scoring list at 520. Jimmy Carson and Tony Granato also seored. 
Rangers 4, Blues 1 
Ed Olczyk and Alexei Kovalev scored second-period break­away goals and John Vanbies­brouck made 34 saves. The victory moved the Hangers, 1-5­2 in their previous eight games, a point ahead of the New Jersey Devils into third place in the Patrick Division. The Devils have played three fewer games. 
The Blues, 6-2-2 in their pre­vious 10 games, had won three straight road games and were 6-1-0 in their last seven away from home. 
But St. Louis wasted valuable minutes on the power play during the third period. Only 59 seconds into the final period, Rangers defenseman James Patrick received a five-minute major penalty for high sticking

"We weren't mentally into the game. Our bench was low on points," said Wood " and this was the first time we had trou­ble shooting."

Sabres 7, Penguins 4 
Pat LaFontaine moved into a 
tie with Mario Lemieux for the 
NHL:s scoring lead with a three­
point game in Buffalo's victory 
over Pittsburgh. 

LaFontaine scored a goal and added two assists to increase his point total to 104, the same as Lemieux, the Penguins' su­perstar currently undergoing treatment for Hodgkin's Dis­ease. 
Alexander Mogilny added to his league goal-scoring lead with his 55th and 56th (empty net) of the season, while the Sabres also got two goals from Wayne Presley and single scores from Grant Ledyard and Yuri Khmylev. Mogilny tied the club record for goals in a sea­son set by Danny Gare in 1979­80. 
Maple Leafs 6, North St~rs 5 
Todd Gill's second goal of the game broke a tie with 40 sec­onds left in the third period as Toronto rallied from a three­goal deficit to beat Minnesota. 
Doug Gilmour, just off a six­assist performance against the North Stars Saturday night in a 6-1 Toronto victory, scored the tying goal and added two assists as the Maple Leafs swept a home-and-home series to move within four points of Minnesota for third place in the Norris Division. 
Mike Modano had two goals and 11n assist for the North Stars, and Mark Osborne scored twice for Toronto.

"Carrol played a great game of basketball. They played like I wished we played,"said Coach Wood. 
Saint Mary's did have nine steals and 12 turnovers but Carrol's turnovers were also low and they had eight steals. But Carrol's balanced attack was most impressive. They had six players in double figures. 
"We've got three games left. We have to step up a level to win those games, and it can be done," said Wood.

Bruins 3, Lightning 3 
Steve Leach scored at 14:22 of 
the third period to help Boston 
tie Tampa Bay. Adam Oates 
recorded his lOOth assist for 
Boston. 

Tampa Bay took its third lead of the game at 3-2 just before the end of the second period on Chris Kontos' 27th goal. 
But Leach flipped a shot past Young, who had just knocked away a wrist shot from Gord Roberts to tie the score. It was Leach's 19th goal. 
Red Wings 5, Blackhawks 3 
Steve Yzerman scored three goals and added two assists Sunday night as the Detroit Red Wings beat Chicago 5-3 to move within three points of the first­place Blackhawks in the Norris Division. 
It was Yzerman's third hat trick of the season and 18th of his carrer. He now has 44 goals. 
Yzerman's 43rd goal, and second of the game, broke a 3-3 tie at 15:39 of the second pe­riod. Standing just outside the crease, the Blackhawks over­loaded with four defenders along the right boards and Yves Racine was able to get a pass off to Yzerman, who poked the puck by Eddie Belfour 
Yzerman gave Detroit a two­goal margin at 15:07 of the final period on a breakaway, nailing a 22-footer from the top of the right faceoff circle. 
Yzerman's five points enabled him to close within six of reach­ing the 1 ,000 point mark. 
After Nicklas Lidstrom scored at 6:12 of the second period, the Blackhakws pulled even at 
11:38 when Brian Noonan de­flected in Chris Chelios' 50-foot slapshot from the right point. 
Yzerman's first goal, his fifth shorthander of the season at 
16:34 of the first period, made it 2-1 Detroit. 
Detroit took a 3-1 lead on Racine's goal at :58 seconds of 
two of their last three games, according to Coach Wood. 
Practice on Monday was short and intense. According to Wheeler, the team needs to talk to each other more on court. 
"We need to acknowledge each other's contributions," she said.

Katie Northup is fired up and ready to 1----------------~ roll. Northup, a Saint Mary's sophomore 
Peterson is running her way into the 
record books 
Notre Dame can boast a large number of stellar athletes, but the most impressive is not too well known. First of all. she is a female athlete and secondly, she is on the track team. 
Erica Peterson is a new addition to the Irish track team and what an addition she has been. She has turned heads in every indoor meet and she is rewriting the record books. The freshman sprinter has four years to run at the collegiate level and then she will most definitely move into the international arena. 
In her first three meets here, Peterson has been more than impressive. At the Midwestern Collegiate Conference Indoor Championships, Peterson ran in five events-four individual races and one relay. The speedy freshman took the title in four of those events, namely. the 55 meter hurdles. the 200 meter dash, 400 meter dash. and the 4 x 440 relay and set new conference records in the 200 and the 400. 
In the three individual events, Peterson finished several meters ahead of her competition while in the relay Peterson ran the anchor leg and came from behind to finish well ahead of the next team. 
Ironically. Peterson as her own team would have placed fourth in the meet. For her performance, she was named Newcomer of the Meet and Athlete of the Meet. 
In her second collegiate competition, the Meyo Invitational, Peterson set a Notre Dame indoor record in the 400 meters en route to another first place finish. Versatile as well as quick, Peterson ran the 800 meter race and took second place last weekend at the Ball State Invitational. 
A member of the Canadian National Track team. Peterson also has some experience running at the international level. At the Junior World Championships in Seoul, Korea in the fall, Peterson won the silver medal in the 400 meter hurdles and contributed to a seventh plar,e 4 x 400 relay team making her first trip to the meet a successful one. 
One of Canada's top young hurdlers, Peterson, tried out for the Barcelona Olympics. She finished first in her heat, but stumbled on a hurdle in the finals. 
This lady is fast. 
The outdoor track season will be starting soon and Peterson will be a runner to watch. She will undoubtedly add to the accolades she has accumulated this winter. 
But, Notre Dame track is just the beginning. After four years here, the runner will be headed to Atlanta. Barring any unforeseen eircumstance, Peterson will be competing against the world's elite in the 1996 Summer Olympics.

Following in her aunt Mary T. Maher's footsteps, Northup began swimming in a summer league at the early age of four. She went on to swim year round for Lakeside Swim Club of Louisville, Kentucky at the age of 10. 
Northup continued swimming competitively for five years with Lakeside, but quit the sport after her freshman year of high school.

Belles. drop two games over weekend 
By NICOLE MCGRATH Saint Mary's Sports Editor 
The Saint Mary's basketball team lost heart, on the road, this ')last Valentine's weekend as they dropped two games to Beloit College and Carrol College. 
These two losses were the Belles' last chance at qualifying for the NCAA tournament. What is usually a given for Saint Mary's remained out of reach all weekend for them. 
"This was not the team I was used to seeing this season," said Coach Marv Wood. 
Beloit's buccaneers 64-48 victory over the Belles on Saturday extended their winning streak to eight. Saint Mary's did much to help them retain that streak. 
The Belles racked up a total of 28 turnovers while the Buccaneers had only 19, and Saint Mary's could not convert those turnovers. 
"It was a matter of sharpness. We did not make good choices, forced some things and it went into their hands," said guard/forward Mollie Wheeler. 
The Buccaneers capitalized off of the Belles' mistakes by having 13 steals. On top of that, Beloit monopolized the charity line by hitting 12 of 17 free throws. Saint Mary's was only five of six chances at the line. 
''I'm not sure what it was. Our enthusiasm was down. "said Wheeler. 
Usually Saint Mary's has a sure thing in Jennie Taubenheim or Kristen Crowley who nail their shots and keep the Belles' chances alive in the second half. The sure thing could not be found at Carroll College. 
Forward Taubenheim made 8 of 20 field goals while guard Crowley found only 5 of 17 shots. Crowley make her signature mark by sinking three treys. 
"Kim Holmes, Crowley and Taubenheim played well for us but most of us were sluggish," said Wood. 
Sluggish ballplay extended to Sunday's game against Carrol, as well. Carrol slammed Saint Mary's, 81-56. 
Except for Wheeler having two points, only three Saint Mary's

Men's volleyball sweeps Loyola for victory 
By KEVIN DOLAN Sports Writer 
The Irish men's volleyball team rolled to a 3-0 victory over a decimated Loyola­Chicago team in The Pit last night. It was a match that outside hitter Pat Madden and coach Jen Slosar both agreed was easy because of Loyola mistakes and injuries. 
"Losing your setter in the first game tends to screw up your offense," Madden said. "We knew we were pretty well set 
after that." The Irish won 17-15, 15-7 and 15-5 over a thin. grumpy Loyola squad that often seemed more concerned about the officiating than running their plays. They had several service errors and lost two points to violations in their lineup, and the whole team just never seemed to start playing. Still, the Irish had trouble putting Loyola away in game 1. The old problem of passing haunted the Irish once again, and was accentuated by the absence of 
setter Won Suh, who had a job interview. 
Assistant coach Dan Kavanaugh, who retired as a player in the preseason due to outside commitments. donned a jersey to replace Suh, and the adjustment was difficult in the first game. 
"Dan runs a different kind of offense than Won," said club captain Brian Ceponis. "Won spreads the offense around a little more, while Dan sets it up to the outside most of the time." 
Torn Kovats and Matt Strottman were solid in game 1. but Loyola took advantage of the adjustment problems to force it to 17-15. However, the dream of a Loyola victory ended with the injury to Loyola's setter early in that game. 
Games 2 and 3 were both cakewalks for the Irish, with Kovats and Strottman combining on spikes and aces in game 2 as the Irish ran up a 14-3 lead, winning 15-7 in the end. 
Game 3 saw more liberal substitution by the Irish, as the stress of losing badly began to cost Loyola. Subs Miguel As­cencion and Tim Regan entered about

always supported me and made m; feel like part of a family." commented Northup. 
After quitting, Northup wanted nothing to do with swimming. Like many partici­pants of demanding individualistic sports. Northup experienced burn out. 
"I didn't want to have anything to do with it for a while," said Northup. "I didn't begin to miss it until the end of my senior year." 
midway through the game, and combined for 3 kills and an ace by Hegan as the Irish won 15-5. 
"Our passing could have bnen better in game 1, but after that we started mixing up the oll'ense, which helpnd a lot," said Madden. Ceponis agreed, adding that "A quick. painless victory is niee to have." 
"It was nice to get the subs in," added Slosar. Both Ascenscion and Hegan played well, debunking the myth that the Irish bench is weak. 
Another factor in the Irish win was the vocal crowd. One spirited individual in particular seemed to rattle the Loyola squad. Loyola oftHn looked disgustedly at the small but loud band of Irish supporters, who were into the match from start to finish. 
"We really appreciated the crowd support," said Madden. "It gives The Pit more of a home-court atmosphere and fires us up. We always play better with a loud crowd." 
The Irish take on the tough Sycamores at 7:30p.m. on Wednesday. 
Northup decided to go out for Saint Mary's swim team her freshman year. 
" I had no idea what to expect after leaving the sport for so long. I just wanted to have fun my first year back." 
It was not until this season that Northup decided to get serious. After returning to Louisville last summer she saw many of her old team mates that had swimming scholarships to class A schools. 
"They really inspired me to come back strong." said Northup. 
Northup has been training hard all season. She continued practicing seriously with a club in Louisville over Thanksgiving and Christmas breaks. 
"Katie has dropped significant time off every event she has swum since Christmas break." said Belle's coach Dennis Cooper. 
Northup has come close to breaking the mile, 1000, and 500 freestyle record at Saint Mary's College. She'll have another opportunity to do this next weekend at the Liberal Arts Invitational.
