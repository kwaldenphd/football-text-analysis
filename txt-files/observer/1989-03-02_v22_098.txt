IN BRIEF 
Two Hoosierswere among 19 people awarded the Carnegie Medal for Heroism at ceremonies in Pittsburgh Wednesday. Karl Schreiner, 75, of Indianapolis rescued a 6-year-old boy from an attack by two pit bull terriers, while Randolph Macyauski, 30, of Greensburg saved a 6-year-old girl from drowning. Schreiner stepped in to help stop the attack in Indianapolis on Oct. 3, 1988. Macyauski saved the girl when her car was swept from a bridge and carried downstream in rain-swollen Salt Creek in Oldenburg, Ind., on Aug. 19, 1988. Grants totaling $47,500 were given to Wednesday's awardees and the widow of a man who died in his rescue attempt. -Associated Press 
David Letterman invited the entire population of 
Bolan, Iowa--six Bolanites and 10 from the "suburbs" to 
visit New York City. Letterman, prompted by a staffer 
intrigued by Bolan, paid for the Iowans to come to New 
York for three days and appear on his show, "Late 
Night with David Letterman." "We wave at everybody. 
They give each other the bird," said Daryl McCready, 
comparing motorists in Bolan and Manhattan. 
McCready said he and his neighbors are enjoying the 
trip even though they know some people are poking fun 
at them. But he added, "When we see the mess and 
utter confusion of New York City, I wouldn't sell my 88 
acres for 88 acres in Manhattan, unless I could sell it 
and move back to peace and quiet." -Associated Press 
Gunnison, Colo has been named the nation's coldest community for the fourth straight year, while Palm Springs, Calif., moved up to capture honors as the warmest in 1988.

Overall the nation's average temperature last year, calculated by averaging the highs and lows, was 53 degrees Fahrenheit--the same as the year before and 1 degree colder than in 1986. -Associated Press

INSIDE COLUMN 



Editor-in-chief bids farewell to The Observer 
"One generation passes away and another generation cometh but the earth abideth ... all the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again." 
-Ecclesiastes 
It's difficult, I suppose, for anyone to say goodbye to an organization that he or she has been closely associated with for four years. 
It's especially difficult when you realize that organization and its people are going to con­tinue on without you. It can lead one to think that he or she hasn't made a difference. 
I have enjoyed leading The Observer for the past year in what I see as a positive direction. Though things have been difficult at times, our staff has worked diligently to put out a quality newspaper for our community. Without the work of over 175 student employees, most of whom are paid miserably, The Observer would not be circulated everyday. 
And now that my job is done, I can honestly say that it is a miracle that there is a newspaper everyday with the possibility of things going wrong all the time. The people who don't take this for granted are the ones who appreciate The Observer the most. 
As a staff member, I feel lucky to have been a part of The Observer this year. A wide range of newsworthy events has made it the most in­teresting in recent years at Notre Dame. Some of these events were theN ational Championship football season, the Hiler/Ward Congressional debate brought by student government, and the George Bush visit and the ensuing controversy. 
Recently, however, some events take away from the fun of putting out a newspaper. The deaths of Bob Satterfield, Richard Macrina and Pat McManus are a grim reminder that we have a duty to report the news that we don't want to read. 
Regarding the future of The Observer, it's important to remember that we are the voice of the community. The Observer is the most visible link between students, faculty, adminis­trators, family and the community at large. This link is as important as any in the Notre Dame "family." 
If The Observer is the link in the community, 
however, then it has a responsibility to serve 
the interests of all members of that community. 
Because The Observer serves as the voice of 

Chris Murphy 
Editor-in-Chief BYE 

the community, that voice is important. The Observer's new general board must realize the importance of that voice and the responsibility it carries. 
The Observer needs more student, faculty and administrative input. In an academic year that has been labelled the "Year of Cultural Diversity," this University needs diverse input on all issues pertaining to our academic, social and cultural lives. The Observer should be the forum for these thoughts. 
At the same time, our community needs a challenge. The Observer can only serve a lim­ited function in creating an intellectual forum for diverse thought. The community at this Uni­versity is uncommonly silent; the community can blame only itself for this silence. 
Mter a year at the top, I've learned to realize that The Observer, much like our community, is not perfect and probably never will be. 
But striving to serve the community's inter­ests is the ultimate goal of any newspaper. And I'm pleased with the way we've served our com­munity this year.

Tower publicly admits extramarital affair 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-John Tower made an extraordinary public admission of marital infidelity 'Yed~esday but vowed to keep f1ghtmg for Senate confirma­tion as defense secretary. 
President Bush continued to court Democrats in a last-ditch effort to save the appointment, and spokesman Marlin Fitzwater asserted, "We'll just keep up the good fight." 
But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell further damp­ened Tower's chances by declaring his opposition, even as Vice President Dan Quayle conceded the administration still lacks the votes needed for Senate approval. 
The president said his appeal to senators has been, "Look, do what you've got to do, but re­member fair play, remember decency and honor, and then remember also historically the concept of advise and consent where reasonable doubt is given historically to the presi­dent of the United States who after all is responsible for the executive branch of this gov­ernment." 
Tower said he regards his weekend vow to quit drinking if he wins confirmation as "sacred ... and I can assure you I will abide by it." 
Asked whether he had ever broken his wedding, vows, the twice-divorced Tower said, "As a matter of fact, I have broken wedding vows. I think I am probably not alone in that connection." 

Tower's second wife, Lilla Burt Cummings, alleged "marital misconduct" in court papers in the couple's divorce case. 
Bush dispatched Quayle to Capitol Hill to lobby for the nomination. 
"We hope the prospects im­prove. We don't have 50 votes yet. But we're moving in that direction," Quayle told a White House photo session. 
Tower showed flashes of grit and humor as he fielded ques­tions at the National Press Club about allegations concerning excessive drinking, womaniz­ing and lucrative consulting fees he received from defense contractors. 
Asked whether he would ask that his name be withdrawn, he replied by quoting from the last letter written by Col. William Barrett Travis, the leader of the Texans who fought and died at the Alamo: "I shall never surrender or retreat." 
The former Texas senator paused briefly and said, "I am a little sorry I brought up the Alamo analogy. It just oc­curred to me what happened at the Alamo just 10 days after Travis wrote that letter." Texas defenders were wiped out by the Mexicans. 
The political storm surround­ing the nomination continued. 
Republicans were trying to decide whether to seek a delay in the beginning of the debate on the nomination, which has drawn widespread opposition from Democrats.

ard Conklin said Quinn has left campus. 
Quinn was recruited by former head coach Gerry Faust and was a reserve out­side linebacker for the 1985 and 1986 seasons, according to the documents and Notre Dame football guides. 
Notre Dame Sports Informa­tion Director John Heisler said Quinn was suspended from the 
team by Head Coach Lou Holtz in the spring of 1987 for undis­closed reasons. 
Quinn did not return to the team but remained on athletic scholarship in the 1987-88 aca­demic year, Heisler said. He saw no playing time his fresh­man year under Faust and played in five games under Holtz in 1986, making four tackles, according to the foot­ball guides. 


Heisler said Quinn was suspended from the university last spring for an undisclosed reason and was not permitted to return last fall. Quinn was permitted to re-enroll in Janu­ary but was not on athletic scholarship, he said. 
In his suit against the female student, Quinn alleged the wo­man made untrue, slanderous claims when she told officials he attempted to have sex against her will, and that he beat her and confined her, court documents show. The suit says Quinn met the student at a social gathering Feb. 3 on the Notre Dame campus.

Honor Code has no place at NO 
Status of world needs attention 

Dear Editor: 
Time magazine declared 1988 the year of Planet Earth. In doing so they recognized the growing importance of environmental concerns in terms of so­cial, economic and political considera­tions. Almost daily we are bombarded with new revelations about humanity's destruction of the environment. To name some current events: CFC's and ozone depletion, greenhouse effect, massive deforestation of the Amazon, chemical dumping in the Mississippi, and polluted tap water in Granger In­diana (to bring it nearer to Notre Dame). 
There is a tendency, given the enor­mity of the problems, to shake your head, concluding that it is all out of your control, and after all you have an exam tomorrow. However, these issues aren't likely to go away and sooner or later we will be forced to address them. At the very least we will have to pay higher costs in garbage disposal, higher taxes for toxic waste cleanup, and greater medicaltinsurance costs as a greater portion of the populace requires medical care because of man-made en­vironmental effects. In addition, there will most likely be enormous costs in human terms as people are adversely affected by pollutants and harmful en­vironmental policies. 
Last week, an article in The Observer concerning recycling program at Rut­gers University spelled out the need for a recycling program at Notre Dame. As a member of the recently formed Notre Dame Environmental Action Club I believe that an in-depth explo­ration of the recycling issue at Notre Dame with all concerned is a step in the right direction. In the coming weeks we will be researching what types of recycling at Notre Dame could be ap­propriate and thus, we will be actively seeking input from students, staff, and faculty. But beyond the recycling policy 
(which is only one pertinent issue), we hope to address a wide range of envi­ronmental issues and concerns through sponsoring discussions, speakers, and educational information. Please come out for the meetings of the Notre Dame Environmental Action Club every Tuesday at 9 p.m. in the Center for So­cial Concerns.

NO students need global awareness 
Dear Editor: 
On Feb. 28 I wrote a Viewpoint article concerning the topic of globalization and the need for cultural and intellec­tual diversity within the college of Busi­ness Administration. The purpose of that article was to bring awareness to the student body and the faculty on an issue that is ever-present in the world today. Globalization pervades every aspect of our lives, whether it be making a major investment decision, buying an automobile, or simply going to the corner store--and we, as future leaders, must be educated and well­informed to make responsible decisions in a global world. Notre Dame, as the premier academic and ethical institu­tion in the country, has the capacity to step to the forefront and be a leader in the global movement. 
The first step in this movement will be realized on Wednesday, March 15 with the First Annual Student Globalization Forum. This forum has the blessing of the University, and while the College of Business Adminis­tration is the focus of this forum, we hope to bring together students from all colleges within the University to in­tegrate our different ideas and experi-· ences. 

This forum is unique in that we the students will be the principle speakers and will provide our perspectives on globalization. Father Hesburgh will also be speaking and relating his per­sonal experiences as they pertain to globalization. 
The purpose of the forum is to seek an understanding of the global eco­nomy; to define the theme of confi­dence in America, which is needed to sustain global prosperity; to address the issues of education, politics, ethics, and military strength in the global eco­nomy; and to provide insight into the role Notre Dame should play in 
globalization. 
We, as students of the University, are 
anxious for Notre Dame to provide 
leadership in the area of global educa­
tion. With the help of the student body, 
we hope to make our aspirations known 
to the administration and faculty and 
to propel Notre Dame to its rightful po­
sition at the head of America's aca­
demic institutions.

Quote of the Day 
'It we had no winter, the spring would not be as pleasant.' 
-Anne Bradstreet 
About 20 years ago, the first honor code at Notre Dame was abolished be­cause of its unpopularity among the stu­dents who refused to report cheaters. The people who dissolved that code said that students must be willing to accept and support the non-tolerance policy for the Honor Code to succeed. It is an in­disputable fact that the vast majority of the students here will not report an­other student for cheating on an exam or an assignment. Unfortunately, the administration views this loyalty as a shortcoming. 



Jason Carroll 
guest column 
"Squealers" destroy the unity of the "Notre Dame family." The Honor code would be more in place in schools with cut-throat competition, like at Stanford or an ivy league school, where people reportedly steal notes from their class­mates to lower the curve. The admin­istration said it was influenced by other prestigious schools with honor codes, but we are different; we are ND. The University's greatest strength, the camaraderie of everyone in the com­munity, is disturbed by this Honor Code. 
The administration contradicts itself by saying that non tolerance is neces

sary to the Honor Code, and realizes that the students will not report each other, yet implements the code anyway. By approving a rule which is merely disregarded by most of the stu­dents, the administration sets a nega­tive precedent. The students learn dis­respect for a distant, deaf group of oppressors. Students begin to feel that the administration does not care for anything but the precious University image. The Honor Code is, therefore, actually detrimental to the formation of the students' attitudes toward the ad­ministration. This imminent violation of the Code also demonstrates to stu­dents an unethical philosophy: break the law when it is convenient. Although widespread disobedience, per se, is not reason enough to eliminate a rule, it should be considered in the decision to establish and enforce the law. 
Another of the Honor Code's negative effects is that it is a burden on the honest, while the dishonest are unaf­fected. A conscientious student will face an undeserved dilemma if he wit­nesses an act in violation of the Code. One option is to report his fellow stu­dent. The result would be guilt for bar­ming a neighbor, as well as likely ostracism, regardless of promises for anonymity. These predicaments are magnified if the offender is a close friend. The innocent observer could also remain silent, but his silence would 
be an offense in itself, which would create even more guilt. The virtuous student is, therefore, placed in a no-win situation. 
Contrarily the dishonest student's burdens are removed. The obvious re­luctance of other students to "narc," combined with the unproctored (at least officially) exams, presents new opportunities to cheat. This student would not care if he were breaking an­other rule. But both the administration and the student body realize that the Honor Code does not reduce cheating; the point here is simply that only the blameless suffer. 
But still some of you might not be convinced. Those few believers argue that the administration must have their reasons to support an Honor Code that destroys unity, fosters disrespect, does not reduce cheating, and harms honest students. The official goal of the Honor Code is "to increase the students' pride, integrity and involvement in their own education." No survey is needed to see that the Honor code does not fulfill that purpose. The authors, unfortunately, disregarded their worthwhile motives as being mere rhetoric, and opted for the image-boosting mandate which is currently in effect. 
It is sad that the University had to waste resources on a trial period, when the Honor Code's inevitable conclusion could have been discovered had the ad­ministration simply consulted the stu­dents or the faculty. Instead we have a code which is mocked as it dies out. 
The only saving grace of this Honor Code is that it is fading away. I asked six sophomores about their 200-level courses which are all supposedly under the policies of the Honor Code. Only in five of their collective 30 classes did the teacher even mention the Honor Code, and two of those were votes, in which, it was voted down. The other 25 classes were exactly as before the Honor Code was instituted. Four of the six students said that they have yet to sign any sort of a pledge this semester but they have all turned in at least five tests or papers. A student reported that one of his teachers said, "I don't care if there is an Honor Code. I'm going to proctor this exam anyway." It is obvious from this limited, unofficial survey, that the teachers here, like the students, have no respect for this code. 

With this multitude of significant, in­surmountable shortcomings, it should be clear to all, including the adminis­tration, that the Honor Code does not belong here at Notre Dame.

P.O. Box Q 
Champ clears up boxing motives 
Dear Editor: 

I am writing in response to Michael Schadek's article regarding the Notre Dame Bengal Bouts (The Observer, Feb. 28). Mr. Schadek stated that the motive of the boxers was to "beat the hell out of each other" and "leave the competition lying on the floor, preferably bleeding." I have been af­filiated with the boxing club for four years and therefore feel more qualified to comment on the motives of the boxing club members' participation in the Bengal Bouts. 
The judging of the Bouts is based on a scoring system; whoever scores the most points wins the match. I always take offense when someone says that we are trying to "beat the hell out of each other,'' especially when it is some­one who knows nothing about our pro­gram. Mr. Schadek knows nothing about the camaraderie we all share in the boxing club. We all train together and are great friends. He makes grand statements about our motives and about our program, yet he has never once seen the Bengal Bouts. He says all that is required to enter the ring is a little ignorance. To me ignorance is condemning something you know noth­ing about. Mr. Schadek says that men must fight to prove their self-worth. What a distorted view of self-worth this statement demonstrates! We do not need to fight to prove our self-worth 
just as someone else should not need to 
write to prove his self-worth. 
Mr. Schadek states that "there are 
countless non-violent events which 
could raise as much if not more money 
than a boxing event." Why then does 
he not take his time to organize them 
instead of condemning us? It is very 
easy to come up with grand ideas, but 
it is not so easy to carry them through. 
The Bouts raise about $20,000 an­nually for starving people. If Mr. Schadek came to the Bengal Bouts he would see that we do not "beat the hell out of each other." The referees are all professionals and would not let anyone get hurt. 
There is so much more to our pro­gram than just what people see during that one week out of the year. I do not expect Mr. Schadek to understand that, because he has made no effort to see the true meaning behind the Bengal Bouts. It is easy to view them this way if you have never taken the time to see them from the inside, or from any side for that matter.

Support of Contras promotes brutality 
Dear Editor: 
Some failed policies long outlive their usefulness and just refuse to die. Kevin Smant's exhortation for renewed sup­port for the Contras is a case in point and deserves a more balanced, less hysterical reply than his treatment of this issue offered. 
There is good reason to be concerned for the repression and human rights vi­olations perpetrated by the Sandinis­tas, and I am glad that Mr. Smant is concerned for prisoners of conscience in Nicaragua. However, it should be noted that while the Sandinistas im­prison dissenters and censor the press, the military of El Salvador which has received enthusiastic U.S. support deals with dissenters in a different way: it has gunned down tens of thousands of its own citizens who were not guerrillas, but human rights workers, priests and nuns, or those in­volved in grassroots development. Despite the best efforts of U.S. policy there, the activities of right wing death squads are on the rise. If we cannot assume a peaceful posture towards the Sandinistas, why should we be so tolerant of their neighbors? Is there a double standard whereby mistreat­ment of people by communist govern­ments is intolerable, while the same atrocities when committed by friendly governments are to be overlooked? 

While being concerned with stupidities of the Sandinistas is legitimate, posing the Contras as a vi­able solution to our security concerns in Central America is uncreative, short­sighted, and counter-productive. The Contras can never accomplish the moral and strategically questionable goals U.S. policy makers want them to. They cannot hold territory, and they certainly have not given the Sandinis­tas any reason to ease their grip on Nicaraguan society. In fact the Sandi­nistas use the existence of the Contras to justify curtailing civil liberties. 

I also wonder if there is equal concern by Mr. Smant for the victims of the Contras. These mercenaries, who are more of a U.S. creation than an in­digenous force responding to injustice, seem to be capable of vicious attacks on civilians and villages. Is the con­scious policy of assassination of medi­cal workers, teachers, and grassroots leaders, as well as the demise of our own standards of respect for human life the price we Americans must pay to secure ourselves from our own hysteri­cal fear of communism? If these 'freedom fighters' are the "moral equivalent of our founding fathers," then I must be inadequately acquainted with the biographies of Washington, Jef­ferson, and Adams in light of the brutal behavior of the contras. 
Perhaps the most dismaying aspect of Mr. Smant's column is his 'win' men­tality. He puts forward several dubious propositions that we are engaged in relentless competition with com­munism. We must play out this contest until there is a winner, preferably the 
U.S. His assumption is that if we don't act with equal force, the world will be dominated by the U.S.S.R. It is difficult to refute rationally this fear tactic in such a short space, largely because it is based on a conjecture of what might happen, not what is likely to happen. Unfortunately, this sort of irrationality gets translated into policies where people are tortured or pay for our fear either with their own blood or the lives of their loved ones in the mountains of Central America.

Honor code survey found misleading 
Dear Editor: 
The article on the honor code survey (The Observer, Feb. 22, 1989), and the remarks of Associate Provost Father Oliver Williams missed some pretty glaring facts. The article reports that 800 surveys were sent out to students, yet only 148 were returned. Of these, 57 students voiced their approval of the honor code. The way I figure it, that means slightly more than seven per­cent of those polled want to continue the code. 
I disagree with Father Williams that these numbers are "positive." Granted, not every student survey needs to be returned to gauge student opinion, but there was only a 16.4 per­cent return on this survey. An honor code, in my opinion, needs more interest-good, bad, or indifferent-to work. The benefits of an honor code are worth considering only if there is widespread student support, and the survey does not demonstrate that such support is there. 
Further, an honor code should be for students, and as such should be run and supervised by students, not imposed in any way. Father Williams' remarks about the statistic that more underclas­smen are in favor of the code because more "education" was directed their way is, in this respect, particularly gal­ling. 
Finally, I regret that, as Father Wil­liams says, the faculty view the honor code as a "tool" for moral education. It is not a way to educate, it is a way of education. The distinction is a fine one, but until that distinction is realized the honor code will never work.

Spreading faith is a task for all 
Dear Editor: 
I feel compelled to respond to the "Letters to a Lonely God" article by Father Robert Griffin (The Observer, Feb. 24), in which he criticizes the evan­gelistic efforts of Christian groups, spe­cifically denouncing the group known as Jews for Jesus. While I have no af­filiation with this group and I don't speak for them, I resent the misleading way in which Griffin uses them as an example to negatively portray evan­gelical Christians. 
First, in his article Griffin never ex­plains to his readers what this group of people called Jews for Jesus really is, instead he dismisses them as "zealots (who) try to brainwash scarcely grown children with propaganda full of distor­tions and lies." He suggests that they try to tear Jews away from their rich history, culture, and tradition. This could not be more incorrect. Jews for Jesus was started by and is comprised of, as the name suggests, people who were born and raised in the Jewish faith and have since come to know Jesus Christ. They are Christians, because they have accepted Jesus as the Son of God and as their Savior. They are also Jews, because they maintain their devo­tion to their Jewish tradition and heri­tage. If that seems a strange combina­tion, one need only consider the twelve apostles, who were Jews from birth, yet also devoted Christians. It is no wonder then, and no clever disguise, that mem­bers of Jews for Jesus are seen "sport­ing yarmulkes and displaying the Star of David." Like any other Jew, this is what they wear. 

There is a difference between proselytizing and evangelizing, but Griffin likes to use the two interchan­gably. Proselytizing implies coercion and brainwashing; the removal of the inaividual's free choice to decide what to believe. This is what Griffin actually tries to discuss in his article. The har­assment of a person to try to force him to accept a particular set of views is worthy of denunciation. He is justified in condemning this activity. 

Griffin goes further in what he says, however. In reference again to Jews for Jesus he says, " ...they begin hyping the Gospel as though they would be doing the child a favor if they could persuade him to beome a Christian ..." I was amazed to hear this from a Chr­istian clergyman. Being Christian myself, I would think that bringing the GospelOiterally"Good News") of Jesus Christ to someone who has never heard it is a favor indeed. 
The importance to a Christian of knowing and accepting Jesus cannot be overestimated, since "He who has the Son has life; he who has not the Son of God has not life" (1 John 5: 12). Doesn't that give a sense of importance to the task of spreading the Gospel to those who don't know it? According to the Christian faith, a person's very life and soul depend upon salvation through the Son of God. A person cannot be forced to become a Christian. It is up to the individual to decide whether to accept or reject the Gospel but they should at least be exposed to it so they have a choice. Griffin says that "the conver­sion (of a Jewish child to Christianity) would break the hearts of the members of the family." Perhaps so. Does that mean that Christians should just shut up and keep their religion to them­selves? Perhaps instead the family will also come to know Christ. It has hap­pened before. It has to start some­where.

Morrissey fi Ims start tradition 
Dear Editor: 
We wish to acknowledge and thank the many students who participated in and supported last week's Morrissey Film Festival. Eleven halls contributed films and a standing-room-only crowd attended the event--with all proceeds going to the Hogar Santa Cruz in San­tiago, Chile. Thanks are especially due to Tom King, Leo Tighe and the entire committee who organized and ran the event. Great start to a new tradition.

TORONTO--Ben Johnson's track coach testified Wednes­day that he turned the Canadian sprinter on to steroids in 1981 because they were "worth a meter" in com­petition and everyone else was doing it. 
Charlie Francis told a Canadian inquiry into drugs and sports that he first ap­proached Johnson that summer about steroids, but he "was not sure of the advantages." That fall, Francis said, Johnson "decided he would go on." 
"If he wanted to compete, it's pretty clear that steroids are worth a meter at the highest level of sports," Francis said. 
"I think he understood that his competitors were on them." 
Johnson, who lost his Olym­pic 100-meter gold medal and world record after testing pos­itive for steroids in Seoul, has maintained that he never knowingly used drugs to en­hance his performance. Francis' only previous state­ment since the Olympics was that the sprinter's urine test may have been sabotaged. 
Francis said after he put Johnson on a steroid program in 1981, the drugs were later ad­ministered by his personal physician, Dr. Jamie Astaphan. 
Asked if he saw the doctor injeCt Johnson with steroids, Francis replied, "On occasion, yes." 
Astaphan, who has promised to travel to Toronto from his home in the Caribbean to tes­tify, has denied he gave the drug to Johnson. 
In hour after hour of detailed testimony on the use of anabolic steroids and growth hormones, Francis said that at an early stage, champion wo­man sprinter Angella Taylor Issajenko injected Johnson and fellow sprinter Tony Sharpe while the two men injected Is­sajenko with a growth hor­mone. 
Francis said that top-level in­ternational competition is vir­tually impossible without steroids. 
In his second day of tes­timony he cautioned against believing any claims from top-level athletes that they are clean and that their records are the result only of hard work. 
"It just isn't true, not at the 

highest level," Francis said. He said repeatedly that steroids "are not a short cut" but the reason top-level ath­letes are able to train as hard 
as they do. 
Francis has been Johnson's coach since 1977, when the sprinter was 15. 
He said he first worked on steroid programs with Is­1 sajenko on steroids in 1979 and with Johnson and fellow run­

ners Desai Williams and

Sharpe -in 1981.

The coach said he first con­sidered the "moral dilemma" I presented by the use of banned substances in international competition. 
"You have to decide, is it uni­versally being used out there?" he said. 
Francis said the rule for his athletes was to stop taking them 28 days before any test.

Judge rules to proceed with sports agents case 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO--A federal judge Wednesday gave. the final go­ahead to the trial of two sports agents accused of using payoffs and threats to get college ath­letes to signing contracts with them. 
Mter rejecting a defense at­torney's request to have Norby Walters and Lloyd Bloom tried separately, U.S. district Judge George Marovich ordered jury selection to begin. 
"There will be only one trial and it will involve both defen­dants," Marovich said. 
The government contends the two New York-based agents offered dozens of college ath­letes money, cars, clothes, con­cert tickets and trips in ex­change for signed --and usually post-dated-agreements giving them exclusive rights to repre­sent the athletes in professional contract negotiations. 
Walters, 58, and Bloom, 29, have both pleaded innocent to charges of racketeering, mail fraud, wire fraud and extortion in the case. 
Bloom's attorney, former federal prosecutor Dan Webb, said he wanted his client tried separately from Walters be­cause their defenses could con­flict. 
The trial is expected to pro-

neys that he would forbid tes­timony and questioning that was irrelevant to the criminal charges against the two agents. 
"I am only going to allow evidence in this courtroom that is relevant in this courtroom," he said to the attorneys. "You're going to put certain balls into play and I'm going to sit up here and call them fair or foul." 
Prosecutors had indicated earlier this week that they might file new charges against Walters, but U.S. attorney An­ton Valukas said Wednesday he instead would use the evidence collected for additional charges to support this case. 
vide an inside look at what prosecutors say is the seamier side of college sports and prosecutors' plans called for testimony from several profes­sional athletes who dealt with the two agents. 
The sports world is closely monitoring the case because it raises serious questions about the structure and practice of big-money college athletics, es­pecially lucrative football pro­grams.
But Marovich said he did not want the trial to become a morality play. 
"The system is not on trial," he said. The judge cautioned attor-

Women's basketball faces tough challenge in Loyola 









Fencers busy over break 
By CHRIS FILLIO Sports Writer 
A week after this year's spring break, the Irish men's and women's fencing teams will know their competitors in this year's NCAA tournament. 
But first they must compete in this weekend's Great Lakes Championship and the Midwest Regional Championship next weekend. 
The Great Lakes, to be held at the Wayne State campus in Detroit, will feature the top three fencers in each weapon from several Midwest schools. Qualifiers will travel the fol­lowing weekend to the Midwest Regionals to be held at the Uni­versity of Chicago. 
"I think it's conceivable that 
we could end up with more 
finalists this year at the NCAAs 
than anyone," said head coach 
DeCicco. "Coming out of this 
weekend, I'll be anxious to see 
how high a seed we get."

ketball Tournament highlights the final week of regular­season play for Notre Dame. 
The Irish (10-2 in the MCC, 16-9 overall) square off against Loyola tonight at 7:30 and then play Butler at 2 p.m. Sunday in 
their way to the Midwest Regional. 
The sabre team will present a strong compliment of fencers as well. Sophomore Leszek Nowosielski (24-0) posted his second undefeated record in as many years at Notre Dame. Classmate David Kirby (17-1) will join N owosielski along with freshman Ed Baguer (20-4). Baguer, who is coming off a recent hamstring injury, should be at least at 75 percent strength. Senior undefeated sabreman Tim Collins (16-0) will have to sit out the tourney due to an ankle injury which he suffered several weeks ago. 
"I don't see anyone challeng­ing us in sabre," said DeCicco. "I think that we have the best sabre team in the Midwest." 
The epee team will consist of senior captain Ted Fay (33-2), last year's NCAA silver medalist Todd Griffee (39-8), and freshman Englishman David Calderhead (31-10). Both Fay and Griffee have extensive tournament experience, while Calderhead boasts an impres­sive first year record. 
The women's foil team is coming off an excellent regular season in which they suffered only one loss at the hands of Ohio State while also defeating the defending national cham­pions from Wayne State twice this year. 
Senior captain Janice Hynes (30-6) will be joined by fresh­man Heidi Piper (30-5), senior Kristin Kralicek (27-6) and sophomore Lynn Kadri (38-8). The women as well have a very strong field, and will seek to recapture the nation title which they won two years ago. 
"It was a lot easier to beat Wayne State this year with Lynn Kadri," stated DeCicco. "In order to beat the top schools in the nation, you have to get that one bout from the number four spot. It's very, very critical." 
This weekend will also fea­ture the Big Ten tournament for those schools. Qualifiers from that competition will join the Great Lakes qualifiers in the Midwest Regionals next weekend. At the end of this month, the Midwest qualifiers will travel to Northwestern University, the site of this year's NCAA tournament. 
the Joyce ACC to cap another fine MCC season. 
Loyola (11-1 in the MCC) and Notre Dame locked up the top two spots in the tournament field with victories last Satur­day. The Irish's 69-56 victory over Xavier in Cincinnati was the 200th all-time win for the Notre Dame women's hoops program.

hand, would leave both teams with identical conference records going into their final regular season games. 
Evansville, Detroit and Dayton remain in contention for the final two spots in the tournament. Evansville and Detroit look to be the frontrun­ners with 7-6 conference records. Dayton currently holds a 6-7 conference mark. 
Butler is in seventh place in the MCC with a 3-9 record but is the only team to have beaten Loyola in conference play. Three sophomores will have to continue their strong play this weekend if Notre Dame is to come away with a pair of wins. 
Irish point guard Karen Rob­inson has been on an assist tear of late, averaging 7.2 assists over the past five games. She has dished out 5.6 assists per game this season. 
Krissi Davis, who scored a career-high 22 points last Sat­urday against Xavier, leads the Irish in steals from her low post position. The sophomore for­ward has 67 thefts in 25 games this year for an average of 2.7 per game. 
Guards Sara Liebscher and Robinson are currently tied for the lead in freethrow percentage with a .836 mark. Liebscher has converted 56 of 67 attempts, while Robinson has made good on 61 of 73 foul shots.

Women's tennis goes West 
Irish netters to compete with several California schools 
By CHRIS COONEY Sports Writer 
While the typical Notre Dame student will be spending spring break relaxing and avoiding any activity that even remotely resembles work, the Notre Dame women's tennis team will battle five squads that should challenge it with a style of play very different than what the Irish usually face. 
The Irish travel to California next week where they will meet some of the tougher additions to their improved schedule. The teams all tend to attack with an aggressive tempo and more net play than most Mid­western schools are used to seeing. That variety and the overall strength of the squads caused Irish head coach Mic­hele Gelfman to decide to add these schools to this year's itinerary. 
"All the teams have good programs," said Gelfman, "and they are always known for having excellent players." 
"The California schools usually have a variety of dif­ferent types of match play than we normally see," Gelfman continued. "They hit the ball with lots of slice and use a greater selection of shots." 
Gelfman explained that the, Irish normally compete against more conservative players who hit the ball with less spin and are less apt to ap­proach the net. 
Notre Dame's greatest chal­lenge should occur on Tuesday when they face San Diego State, currently ranked 18th in the national polls. The team boasts the country's No. 62 col­legiate player, Aby Brayton, who is just behind Irish leader CeCe Cahill, presently occupy­ing the 61st position. 
"Those two should be right on par with each other," said Gelfman. 
Brayton also pairs with Jen­nifer Larking in doubles. The duo is ranked 29th in the nation. 
Notre Dame will face three schools before and after the San Diego meet. They play Cal State Long Beach on Sunday, Cal State Fullerton on Thursday and UC Irvine on Friday. The Irish finish the week by playing Pennsylvania who will also be in Caifornia. 
"It should be a great experi­ence for us," commented Gelfman. "There will be no pressures from school and the girls are really excited to fi­nally play outdoors." 
While the natural environ­ment will be a welcome change from a winter of indoor prac­tices, Gelfman is concerned about her team's adjustment to the climate. 
"We'll have one day to prac­tice outside and then we have a match. That should be a tre­mendous challenge," Gelfman said. 
The Irish should return to their normal roster, after ill­ness and injury hampered Kim Pacella and Kristy Doran in last weekend's loss to Miami of Ohio. 
Gelfman feels that her team has the right attitude going into the competition. 
"I would like to think that we could beat any team on a given day if the competition is equal. It's hard to predict how we'll do since we've never played them before, but I hope that we can stay up and aggressive," Gelfman commented. "We just need to play our own game and control the tempo." 

Swimmers face intercollegiates 
By MARY GARINO Sports Writer 
Last week the women's swim team placed fifth in the Eas­tern Intercollegiate Champion­ships, and this weekend the men's team will get its turn in the same meet. 
This will be the 15th annual Eastern Intercollegiates for men's teams, and the second year that Notre Dame has par­ticipated. The Irish will be racing against several quality teams including St. Bonaven­ture, the defending champion, and Cleveland State, the host school, both of which Notre Dame has faced earlier this year. 
Head Coach Tim Welsh an­ticipates that the Irish will finish somewhere in the middle of the pack of ten teams, but the priority for the team will be performance, not winning. 
"We're confident that anyone who swims well will score," Welsh said. "If we swim our best, then the points will come, and whatever comes after that will be fine." 
One of the goals for the Irish is to break as many University records as possible at the meet. It's also a chance for the team to evaluate their season. 
"Championship meets are a culmination of everything we've been working on all season," Welsh said. "It demonstrates how good we've become." 
The Irish will take 18 swim­mers to participate in the championships, including five seniors who will be racing for the last time for Notre Dame. This will be Welsh's first graduating class. 
Several NCAA qualifiers are expected to be produced at the meet, and although the Irish

In the 1980s, the Louisville Cardinals have been known as a team that may start slow, but always finishes strong. 
On Saturday, the Notre Dame men's basketball team will try to turn that around. 
Head Coach Denny Crum's teams have been in the NCAA Final Four four times during the past decade, wining the championship twice. 
Digger Phelps and his team need to win, and keep winning over spring break, to make the NCAA's Final 64 this year. 
"Every game is important to us," Phelps said. "The trend has been to send two indepen­dents in the tournament. We hope that continues. DePaul is a very good team that deserves to go. I think each school would like to see the other go." 
Louisville, however, is not the late-season team it usually is, having lost five of their eight games, including their last two. Wednesday's shocking home loss to Cincinnati sends the Cardinals into the Joyce ACC looking for a win in a big way. 
The Cardinals are keeping with the style they have set this season, facing some of the country's top teams (like Duke,

Key to tournament this week 
Notre Dame faces Louisville and DePaul over break 
Syracuse and Georgia Tech) when the oponent needs a big win. 
Pervis Ellison leads the Car­dinals with 17.7 points and 8.6 rebounds per game. Ellison, a 6-9 center, is only the second player in Louisville history to score over 2,000 points, with a total of 2,102 prior to the Cin­cinnati game. 
Other probable starters for the Cardinals are 6-8 forward Kenny Payne, averaging 14.3 points and 5.9 rebounds per contest. Forward Tony Kimbro and guard LaBradford Smith also score in double figures, at 
10.8 and 10.7, respectively. 
The Irish got a chance to scout the Cardinals at the Big Four Classic in Indanapolis Dec. 3, when the Irish beat Ken­tucky 81-65 and Louisville defeated Indiana 101-79. El­lison scored 19 points in the win, and teammate Smith added 17. 
The Louisville game is the last of the season for the Irish in the Joyce ACC. On Monday, March 6, the Irish embark on what Phelps has called "our conference tournament," made up of three consecutive road games.

Butler is lead by 6-6 senior forward Darren Fowlkes, who averages 18.8 points and 7.9 rebounds per game. Guard Jody Littrell adds 13.6 points per game for the Bulldogs. 
Notre Dame holds a 69-25 ad­vantage over Butler, winning last season's contest 85-66. The game, at Hinkle Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, is at 7:35 p.m. and will be televised by WGN.

Robinson had enougth time on the foul line to build a house during that first half. He went into the lockerroom with nine rebounds and 12 points on 8-of-9 foul shooting. 
"It was very physical in­side," said the 6-9 Irish for­ward, who finished with 11 rebounds and 17 points. "That was a big part of the game, to keep them off the offensive boards." 
The Irish especially wanted to contain DePaul forward Stanley Brundy, who had hurt the Irish in DePaul's two wins over Notre Dame last season. 
DePaul's 6-7 senior scored just three second-half points after a 10-point first half. He pulled down 11 rebounds, but only two of them came on the offensive end. 


"We played him very aggres­sively this time," said Robin­son. "We didn't want to let him get in position for rebounds be­cause he scores most of his points off offensive rebounds." 
"We had to do an excellent job of keeping them from get­ting offensive rebounds," said Irish coach Digger Phelps. "That's their second best of­fense. When they're shooting the ball well, they really pound the boards, and when they're not, they're a great offensive rebounding team." 
LaPhonso Ellis also had a lot to do with Notre Dame's suc­cess inside. The 6-9 freshman forward pulled down a game-

against 7-1 center James Hamby. Singleton drew a foul, hit the off-balance shot and then nailed the free throw for a three-point play that put the Irish on top 52-48. 
"I looked up and Brundy was right in my face to block the first shot," Singleton said. "I was really determined to score after that. I just went up, made sure I made contact, and luck­ily I hit it." 
Brundy, who scored 10 first­half points, was ,held to just three in the second period by Notre Dame's match-up zone. 
Greene was 3-of-11 from the field and 1-of-5 from three-point range. Neimann, who came into the game hitting 45.8 per­cent of his three-pointers, was 1-of-6 from beyond the stripe. 
The Irish outrebounded DePaul 40-38. 
"Defensively, we showed a lot of maturity tonight," Phelps said. "I thought we did an ex­cellent job on their big guys. I told the kids, 'You don't know how big this win is tonight.' We're 18-6 and still the best in­dependent team in the country."

Track faces championships 
IC4A's, NCAA championships on immediate agenda 
By SCOTT BRUTOCAO Sports Writer 
Now that the regular season is over the men's track team travels to Princeton, NJ to take part in the IC4A Champion­ships, which Head Coach Joe Piane calls "the prerhier meet on the East Coast." 
Notre Dame will be sending 17 atheletes who have qualified to the championships in 10 events. 
The meet, officially called the Intercollegiate Association of Amateur Atheletes of America Championships, will host more than 100 schools throughout the East Coast. 
"This meet gives us the op­portunity to run against all the Big East schools, the Atlantic 10 schools, and anyone you can imagine on the East Coast," said Piane. "It's a great meet." 
Notre Dame's 17 qualifiers will travel to Princeton on Friday and participate in the two-day meet over the weekend. Then, for the Irish two-mile relay squad and anyone else who qualifies at the IC4A's, the trip continues to In­diana polis for the NCAA Cham­pionships on March 10-11. 
Entered in the 55-meter dash will be Raghib "Rocket" Is­mail and Rusty Setzer. Ismail, 
0.03 seconds away from a NCAA qualifying time, is the Irish favorite to qualify for NCAA's at the IC4A's. 
"I think this meet will prob­ably be a good opportunity for me because I'll be running against a lot of runners who already qualified to the NCAA's," said Ismail. "I hope with me trying to catch them I'll be able to reduce my time and qualify." 
Ismail and Setzer will also be running in the 200 meters, along with Peter DeMeo. 
Co-captain Jan Searcy, who has had leg problems this season, will be participating in the 500 meters. 
Kevin Whelan, who just qualified last weekend at the Alex Wilson Invitational, will be entered in the 800 meter race. 
Mark Lavery and David Warth, two members of the NCAA-bound two-mile relay squad, both qualified to the 1000 meters. 
Glen Watson, rebounding from a slow start, will be com­peting in the 55-meter high hurdles. 
Cross country and track All­American Dan Garrett and sophomore Ryan Cahill are slated for competition in the 3000. Garrett earned All­America honors in the 5000 last year. 
Cross country All-American Ron Markezich and junior Tom O'Rourke will be entered in the 5000-meter distance event. 
Richard Culp, Brian Pep­pard, Mike Rogan, and Sean Schneider, who make up the Irish Distance Medley Relay Squad, are set to compete in that event. Peppard and Rogan comprise the other half of the two-mile relay team. 
John Cole, the only Notre Dame athelete entered in a field event, will be participat­ing in the high jump. 
"I think it's certainly within our capabilities to finish in the top 10 or higher," Piane said. 
One particular team that stands out among the 100-plus at the IC4A's is George Mason University. This team is likely to finish high in the meet, and

Baseball team faces Miami over break in Florida road trip 
By FRANK PASTOR Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame baseball team ( 4-0 has the opportunity to upset the third-ranked team in the country for the second time in as many weeks when it faces Miami on March 8, high­lighting a six-game road trip to Florida over Spring Break. 
The Irish defeated Texas (currently ranked fourth) 12-9 last Friday in Austin, a win that turned a lot of heads in the col­legiate baseball world. 
"This is the ultimate road game," said Head Coach Pat Murphy of the matchup ex­pected to draw over 10,000 spec­tators. "This is the first time somebody of the caliber of Miami has been all fired up about playing Notre Dame." 
Last fall Notre Dame swept the Hurricanes in a two-game series played at Stanley Coveleski Stadium in South Bend. Clearly, Miami has more at stake in the March 8 matchup than simply its number-three ranking. 
"We're going to concentrate on performance," added Murphy. "The odds are going

"We didn't run the tast break as well as we wanted," said the Manor's Tom Veltz. 
When pressure situations arose, Morrissey looked for one player. 
"Kevin Keyes did everything for us offensively and defen­sively," said Veltz. But Keyes had a championship per­formance because of his unsel­fish teammates. 
"They (Fisher) were focus­ing on the other guys and I had some openings, so I just took the shots and they were fal­ling." said Keyes. 
The overtime shot selection was the key to the victory. "We didn't hit the big shots 
to be against us, but we're going to maintain our team identity and we're going to believe in ourselves." 
Notre Dame will open the trip against Pittsburgh on March 5 in Orlando. The Irish will also face Rollins on March 6, Van­derbilt on March 9, Pennsylva­nia on March 10 and Columbia on March 11. Despite the ob­vious importance of the Miami gametiYI_ur_phy warns that the 
other five teams should not be overlooked. 
"We're trying to concentrate on Pittsburgh and Rollins right now," said Murphy. "Pit­tsburgh has a good program, and Rollins is one of the best teams in Division II. We can't overlook those teams. 
"Vanderbilt is a perennial powerhouse, and Pennsylvania was an NCAA regional team last year. We have six tough games in a week, and it's going

Notre Dame opened its season with a doubleheader sweep of Trinity on Feb. 23. 
Following the Texas win, the Irish ended their five-game trip to Texas by splitting a doubleheader with St. Mary's(Texas).
