'21 club' needs only student initiative 
By DAN EARNER 
News Staff 
Campus social life could soon have an added dimension for those of legal Indiana drinking age. The "21 club," proposed by Stanford Hall president Jim Crandall and Lewis Hall president Mimi Soule at a recent HPC meeting, will take on the form of Informal gatherings where al· cohol could be served. 
It will not be a campus-wide club, but an opportunity for 21-year-olds co Informally socialize with others in their own or neighboring dorms. The proposal is an attempt to utilize idle social space in the dorms, ac­cording to Soule and Crandall. 
Crandall and Soule met with As­sociate Vice President for Residence Ufc: John Goldrick on Friday in order to determine If the proposal was in conflict with the current University alt·ohol policy. 
The main obstacle in getting the idea off the ground was a stipulation in the University alcohol policy re­quiring a guest list for all events where alcohol would be served. 
Crandall, Soule, and Goldrick agreed this would be possible by limiting the number allowed to enter the specific dorms. The guest list would consist of names of all residents in the participating dorms who are 21 years old or older. 
Each dorm is now free to talk to their rectors and organize their own 21 clubs within their own hall government's guidelines, according 10 Soule and Crandall. 
Both said they see their idea as an alternative for seniors who want to stay on campus. Because it is not going to be campus-wide, the two do not foresee any conflicts ofinter­est with the Alumni-Senior Club. 
Both of the hall presidents said they are glad the way things turned out. "We wanted to keep it small and informal," Crandall said. 
"We think it will be more fun this

Student cable televsion committee plans to bring coaxial to campus 
By MARK DICKINSON 
News Staff 
HBO, ESPN, and MTV soon could arrive on Notre Dame campus. 
Last Wednesday night, N9tre Dame sophomore Vince Willis held a meeting in LaFortune to organize a committee to start looking into the idea ofcable television. 
lbe committee plans to contact cable companies, satellite dish com­panies, and other universities cur­rently subscribing to cable television to get an idea of the feasibility ofcable at Notre Dame. 
Willis said he hopes to present a proposal for cable to the University before the spring of 1986. 
The issue ofcable has been raised in the past, but no groups have succeeded with the idea and its problems. Willis admits "there are many problems in bringing cable here such as cost, regulating chan­nels, and defacing the campus." Yet, Willis said he believes his commit­tee can overcome these problems and "make cable TV work where ot· hers have failed." 
Willis approached Vice President for Student Affairs Father Tyson with his committees thoughts last week and said, "Tyson supports the idea of 
looking into cable but has hesita­tions." Tyson could not be reached for comment. 
Willis said he sees the adoption of cable "as an alternative to the al­cohol policy." He also said he feels it could "be the greatest thing to hap­pen to this campus in a long time." 
If everything runs smoothly, Wil­lis said he believes Notre Dame students will be watching cable television in their rooms within the next three years. 
The committee will be sponsor­ing a meeting for those interested Thursday Oct. 3, at 6 p.m. in the stu­dent government office. 


J-council: Observer not accountable to senate 
By MARK PANKOWSKI 
Copy Editor 
A Student Senate resolution re­
quiring The Observer to disclose its 
financial statements would have "no 
power or authority backing" it, ac­
cording to a statement released 
Friday by Karen Ingwersen, judicial 
council coordinator, after Thursday 
night's council meeting. 
"They can't touch it (The Obser­ver). '(1tey can pass resolutions right and left, but they can't force The Ob­server to open its books," Ingwersen said Thursday night. 
"The Student Senate can force the opening of The Observer's books only by convincing the administra· lion to force The Observer to do so," her statement said. 
lbe senate has no power in the matter, she said, because "they don't control Its (The Observer's) budget." 
Ingwersen's statement was released after a council debate regarding a possible senate resolu­tion requiring The Observer to open its books. 
The senate had discussed at its meeting last Monday whether it should pass such a resolution, but no final action was taken. 
Several council members debated the issue at Thursday night's meeting, which like the senate's, ended with no final action taken. 
"There's a distinction between the activity fee and The Observer fee. It's still is an independent newspaper," said Mary Mullaney, council member.' · 
"If it's an independent business, student government doesn't have the right to go through its records just like they don't have the right to go through any business in the South Bend community," Mullaney said. 
Council member Kathy Weisenberger disagreed with Mul­laney. 
"The issue is QOt fiscal control, they just want to see the records," Weisenberger said. "It is a student newspaper. Ifit's really for all of us, they should open the books." 
The issue arose after 12 student leaders voted two weeks ago to re­quest that The Observer open its books and allow them to monitor its expenditures. 
Observer Editor-in-Chief Sarah Hamilton declined the request. 
In other council business Thursday night, Weisenberger, chairman of the Judiciary Commit­tee, told the council that the judicial Board system will be revised on a two-year basis. 
The reason for the revision, she said, was because of the lack ofcon· sistency from one dorm's Judicial Board to another's. 
"John Goldrick {associate vice president for student affairs) thinks the Judicial Board system is ar­chaic," she said. "We could create some solid, lasting improvements. It could serve as a standard for years to come." 
Also discussed at Thursday night's meeting was the issue of how the senate should allot the approximate $10,000 in additional student ac­tivity fees that recently became available. 
Ingwersen, who represents the council on the senate, said she was seeking input on how she should vote on a proposal which would create a separate senate account. Ac­cording to the proposal, the senate

36 injured, 45 arrested, in Brixton rioting 
LONDON -Bulldozers shoved 
burned-out cars offthe streets while 
shopkeepers boarded up broken 
windows yesterday in the racially 
mixed slum district ofBrixton after a 
night ofrioting erupted when police 
shot and wounded an unarmed 
black woman. 
A dozen stores were gutted, 26 civilians and I 0 policemen suffered minor injuries and 45 people were arrested in seven hours of rioting, police said. It was the second racial riot in three weeks in a British urban slum district. 
Scotland Yard said Brixton in South London erupted Saturday night after pollee looking for a youth believed armed with a shotgun burst Into a home and shot his unarmed mother in her bedroom. It called the incident a well-planned operation "that went tragically wrong." 
But youths, most of them black, marched to the Brlxton police sta­tion and began hurling firebombs, paving stones, bottles and pieces of lumber. Stores were looted, cars and trucks overturned and set alight. 
Just three weeks earlier, the Hand­sworth district of Birmingham, home to predominantly West Indian blacks, went up in flames In a riot that black leaders said was prompted by a police crackdown on drug trafficking. 
For Brixton, it was the third riot since April 1981. 
"Brlxton is a cauldron which has been simmering for a long time," said local councilor Paul Boateng. 
"It took this incident for It to boil 
over," he said. "But it could have 
happened any time because there is 
a lot of bitterness and alienation felt 
by young people who have no status 
in society." 
The injured woman, Cherry Groce, 38, spent the night In the in­tensive care unit at St. Thomas Hospital with bullet fragments ln her spine. Doctors said it was too early to tell whether she was paralyzed. 
Boateng, who is a lawyer and who visited the family, said Mrs. Groce "Would sue the police. 
The Yard immediately called in a top police officer from another force, Assistant Chief Constable John Domallle of West Yorkshire, to conduct an inquiry. 
Neil Kinnock., leader of the socialist opposition Labor Party, demanded a separate inquiry headed by a judge. The party's domestic affairs spokesman: Gerald Kaufman, accused the police of operating under a "shoot-to-kill policy." 
But Home Secretary Douglas Hurd ruled out a judicial inquiry saying that one held .by Lord Scar­man after the 1981 rioting had been exhaustive and "a great deal has been acted on." 
Labor Party members said jobless­ness, running at a record 13.2 per­cent nationwide and exceeding 40 percent among urban blacks, was a key cause of the violence.

Chasity Gibson, the 2-year-old Uniontown, Ky., girl considered the nation's No. 1 candidate to receive a new liver, was in critical but stable condition yesterday in Chicago after 13 hours of transplant surgery, a hospital spokeswoman said. Dr. james Williams and Dr. Santiago Vera completed the transplant about 4 p.m. without any major complications, said Mary Ann Redeker, a spokeswoman for Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center. "liver transplant surgery usually takes between eight and 12 hours, and children take longer because they are smaller," Redeker said. The donor organ came from a child in Minnesota, but Redeker said hospital policy prevented her from releasing more details about the donor. Gibson suffered from biliary atresia, a congenital disease that causes jaundice and early liver damage. She had been atop a nationwide emergency liver donor list since late August. -AP

Can SYRs, the CSC, and the ACC lead us to Orwell's '1984'? 
Question: When does a Notre Dame freshman 

become just another Notre Dame student? 
Answer: When he or she can use the "words" SYR, 

ACC and CSC without flinching. 
A strange definition for what it takes to be a real 

Domer? 
Not really. 
You can't become a true part of a group or organiza­

tion until you imow the language. And in today's acronym-ridden world learning the language often re­quires the deciphering skills of a master spy. 
Acronyms and other less elegant abbreviations are quickly taking over the language. Orwell stated in the appendix to "1984" that one of the goals of Newspeak, the language of his fictitious society, was to cut down the name of "every organization, or body of people, or doctrine, or country, or instituion, or public building" to a "single easily pronounced word with the smallest number ofsyllables." 
1984 has come and gone, but Orwell's description ofa thought-limiting language is more and more becoming an apt description of American English. 
Organizations are more often known by an acronym or some other abbreviation than they are by their real name. Even seemingly in­nocuous groups have sue-,\ cumbed to Orwell's principle. We've heard of CILA, MADD, SOLA, .CEASE and the YMCA. Yet how many of us know what the letters in these "names" represent? 
Often the acronyms become so much a part of common usuage that no one really knows what they mean. Almost no one is sure what SAGA, the food service at Saint Mary's, stands for, although some very creative guesses have been proposed. Words such as SCUBA, RADAR, and LASER are so much a part of our language that many people don't realize they are indeed acronyms. 
Our fast-paced society provides the most obvious reason for the extensive use of acronyms. People are always in a hurry, and this haste affects one's speech as well as one's driving. Who has time to say radio detect· ing and ranging when what they really mean is RADAR? 
But the need to rush is not the only reason acronyms have become so popular. 
The use ofabbreviated language within a group forms an air of elitism. Nearly every group or community is well-armed with esoteric abbreviations and acronyms. Those who know the language know what's happening;

those who don't are left out ofthe conversation. You are not really part ofthe Army, or IBM, or Notre Dame until you speak their language. 
Not surprisingly, the groups with the most ex­tensively condensed vocabularies are those that deal with the most sensitive information -the government, the military and the technical industry. Any ROTC (an acronym) student will vouch for the fact that the military is heavily reliant on abbreviated words. And engineering students often have more difficulty decod­
ing all the acronyms in their textbooks than they do un­derstanding the concepts. 
These confidential or­ganizations, however, reap more benefits from their acronym-laden dialects than an air ofelitism. An acronym is a painless way to squeeze a complex thought into two syllables; one can blurt out an acronym without even considering the meaning be­hind it. 
LASER, for example, is a simple enough two syllable word that any third-grader can spell. Were one forced 
"!-~ to say instead light amplification by stim· ulated emission of 

electromagnetic radiation, one would be more aware of both the nature and the complexity of this two syllable word. 
Often, acronyms replace concepts that are too com­plex or too unsettling to think about. We can say MIRV or ICBM without really considering that we are discuss­ing lethal weapons. We can say a computer runs at so many MIPs with no need to comprehend how fast this really is. 
As Orwell says (once again in his appendix to "1984" ), "It was perceived that in thus abbreviating a name one narrowed and subtly altered its meaning, by cutting out most of the associations that would ot­herwise cling to it." We can sputter acronyms without thought, and thus protect ourselves from meanings we'd rather not consider. 
It would be impossible to free ourselves from the al­phabet soup that now flavors our language. Acronyms are definitely here to stay. 
But for the sake of your own sanity and the integrity of the English language, the next time you say SYR stop and think: What does this really mean?

Bridget's admissions reflect past legal action 
ByJOHN GORLA 
StaffReporter 
It was the time of the year for Bridget McGuire's Filling Station to renew its liquor license and for the first time In a while no one objected. 

On September 5 the tavern was fined U,500 and had Its license suspended for 1 0 days by the St. Joseph County Alcoholic Beverage Board because ofan incident in April in which 41 people were arrested on the charge of being minors in a tavern. 
Teresa Bauer, bar manager, at­tributed the unusually large crowds of last spring to the closing of Corby's and other local bars. "Since many of the students had nowhere to go they ended up at our doorstep," said Bauer. 
Bridget's now has a stricter policy for those who plan to enter the bar. 
"Now there will be mostly uni­formed police officers at the door," said Bauer, adding "You must have at least one picture ID and two others to back it up." 
"With the officers there it seems 
that people will be less likely to 
show false ID," mentioned Bauer, 
adding," The presence ofthe officers 
will add to the security of the sur­
rounding area and make it safer for 
local residents." 
The new procedure for checking ID's is not too di.fferent from how it has been in the past, except now police officers ace doing the check­Ing. "Police officers are more aware of how people falsify Identification than we ace at Bridget's," said Bauer. 
Bauer said she feels that having the police present will bring a safer atmosphere to the bar, especially for women.

All students will have the op­portunity to attend the College of Arts and Letters Career Day on Wednesday, Oct. 2, from noon until 4 p.m. This event will be held In the lower level of the Center for Continuing Educa­tion. 
The Arts and Letters Career Day has been held the past six years and has been very in­formative, according to Paul Reynolds, assistant director of Career and Placement services, and coordinator of the event. 
Approximately 450 students attended last year, Reynolds said, adding although the event Is primarily for Arts and Letters stu­dents, all students can benefit from the day. "It's a perfect op­portunity to see a lot of career representatives gathered in a small place," Reynolds said. 

More than 30 careers will be represented such as banking, communications, and politics. 
Also present will be representatives from the fields of financial services, higher educa­tion, and paralegal.

Grad student program to confer 100 degrees 

Spedal to The Obeaver 
One hundred minority students sponsored by the National Consor· tium for Graduate Degrees for Minorities in Engineering Inc. will receive graduate degrees this spring, tplfilling a goal set for the consor­tium's lOth anniversary. 
The consortium, known as GEM and headquartered on the Notre Dame campus, was organized in 1976 as a means of encouraging more minorities to pursue graduate studies in engineering. In its early days, GEM was comprised of 15 uni­versities and nine employers. At the end of its first academic year, GEM had sponsored one graduate stu· dent. 
Today, 48 member universities have 250 GEM fellows enrolled in their graduate engineering programs. Fifty-four companies employ the students as summer in· terns. Since 1976, 310 minority stu· dents, or 12 percent ofall minorities who hold graduate engineering degrees, have been sponsored by GEM. Some 85 percent ofthose who have entered the program have completed their graduate degrees, 
Ferraro terms candidacy 'almost unbearable' 
NEW YORK -Geraldine Ferraro 
says her campaign last year for vice 
president was "almost unbearable," 
as she was subjected tq scrutiny, 
bigotry an~ sexism. 
"I wasn't prepared for the depth of the fury, the bigotry and the sexism my candidacy would unleash,N wrote Ferraro, the first woman to be a major party's national candidate. 
Yet the hardships wereoffset by the opportunities her candidacy opened for women like her two daughters, "expanding their life op· tions a thousandfold," the former New York congresswoman wrote in "Ferraro: My Story," to be published by Bantam Books in November. 
She called anti-abortion pickets who dogged her steps "vicious" and said the Italian-American com­munity abandoned her. 
She said her husband, john Zac· caro, was "devastated" and depressed by scrutiny and criticism ofhis financial dealings, and said she began to bite her nails and eat "almost compulsively" because of the pressures ofthe campaign. 
Ferraro said she incited a furor over her husband's tax returns by in· advertently approving a news release saying he would release them when he had told her he would not. The documents eventually were released. 
'"Please take my name out ofcon· sideration,' I told Mondale. 'I do not want to be part of this process anymore. I never really did want it,,. Ferraro wrote. "But he refused." 
Mondale promised her the criticism would stop, she said. 
On the night ofher nominatlon in San Francisco, she and Mondale and their spouses celebrated with cham· pagne. 
"There wasn't a cloud on my horizon," she wrote. "What I didn't know then was the personal agony that lay ahead, an agony that at times would seem almost unbearable." 
Ferraro said she was not dis· traught over losing the election. 
"Short of a major disaster that he couldn't grin away or shrug otfhelp· lessly, (President) Reagan was vir­tually unbeatable," she said.

and applications have been received from all minority groups. 
In spite of the progress GEM has made, its student programs coor­dinator is calling for more applicants to fill the 150 fellowships to be of· fered in 1986. "Many minorities are looking for high-level positions in research and development, and they need graduate degrees to compete for those positions," said Dr. Martha Conley. "Many barriers still exist and it is important that more minority students become aware of the graduate school application process." 
Last year, Conley said 145 fellow­ships were filled from a pool of 400 applicants. Students who are ac· cepted will begin a graduate en· gineering program at one of the member universities and work as summer interns with the member companies. Fellows pay no tuition and receive an annual S5,000 stipend. Member companies pay summer salaries and provide transportation to and from work.

16 skydivers and pilot die in crash 
JENKINSBURG, Ga. · An airplane filkd with parachutists crashed on takeoff from a private rural airstrip yesterday, killing all 17 aboard, offi· cials said. 
The single-engine Cessna 208 Caravan crashed in a pasture around 
12:30 p.m., said Federal Aviation Ad­ministration spokesman Roger Myers. 
"The airplane was apparently climbing out after taking off and a witness stated that the engine stalled," said Preston Hicks, a Na­tional Transportation Safety Board Investigator who was on the scene. 

Grady Wyatt, who lives near the crash site approximately two miles from the West Wind Sport Parachute Center, was out in his yard when the plane flew over just above the treetops. 
"The plane came up and looked like it could hardly stay up. A few minutes after that, I heard a crash, what sounded like a crash," said Wyatt. 
The plane came to rest on its back, its cockpit destroyed but the wheels intact, said Butts County Fire Chief 
W.L. Vaughn. 
Jenkinsburg is about 60 miles south ofAtlanta. 
"The first report to us was that there were 1 7 persons on board and all were injured fatally," said Myers. Patrol spokesman Bill Wilson also said that all those aboard the 16· passenger airplane were killed. 
Rescue workers spent two hours pulling bodies from the wreckage, which were taken to a National Guard Armory in nearby Jackson, said Hicks. 
The Caravan is an unusually large single-engine aircraft introduced by Cessna in 1982 and marketed as a cargo or passenger aircraft, Myers said.

Black burned to death in second day of riots 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa· A mob burned a black man to death yesterday in the second straight day of clashes between rival black groups near Durban, and anti· apartheid violence spilled into white areas for the third day in a row, police said. 
Police also reported they shot and killed a black man heaving a gasoline bomb in Dordecht in eastern Cape Province. 
An explosion that police believed was caused by a bomb went off in the men's room of a hotel ncar Dur­ban where about 150 black youngsters were guests at a "children's day," but no one was injured. 
Peter Davidson, owner of the Ex· ecutive Hotel in Umlazi, a black township west of Durban, told The Associated Press: "We don't know who would have done lt. I am not involved in politics." 
However, local Zulus and sources within lnkatha, the million-strong Zulu political movement, said Davidson is one of the more than 100 members of the lnkatha central committee, which advises hereditary Zulu Chief Gatsha But· helezi. The sources spoke on condl· don ofanonymity. 
The youngsters, ranging in age from 9 to 15, were gathered for a party the hotel sponsors on Sunday afternoons for parents and their children. Police said there was little damage. 
Two Sunday newspapers called for the government to lift the state of emergency imposed July 21 in 36 areas, saying the emergency has given police the opportunity to torture detainees. 

Security crackdown appears to meet goal 
WASHINGTON · The armed 
services and defense contractors ap· 
pear to be meeting Defense 
Secretary Caspar Weinberger's 
three-month goal of reducing 
security clearances by 10 percent. 
Final figures on the crackdown, which grew out of a Navy spy scan· dal, are not expected until next month. But Weinberger's deadline for an across-the-board, 10 percent reduction in clearances expires today and some preliminary figures have been compiled. 
When the cuts were orderedJune 11, there were 4.3 million Pentagon employees, congressional aides and contractor employees with clearances ranging from Confiden· tial to Secret to Top Secret. 
The idea ofslashing the number of individuals with clearances is aimed at both reducing the potential sources ofinformation to the Soviets and freeing investigators to pedorm more thorough and timely back· ground checlcs. 
L. Britt Snider, Pentagon's prin· cipal director for counter-intelligence and security policy, told a House panel last week that "it does appear that DoD will meet or exceed the secretary's 1 0 percent objective by the first ofOc· tober." 
"As of Sept. 15, we estimate that an overall reduction of ap­proximately eight percent had been achieved . . .," Snider disclosed. "Each of the military departments has advised that it expects to satisfy the requirement in a timely man­ner." 
Defense contractors "had 
eliminated 149,599 existing 
clearances, or 1 0. 7 percent of the 
,
whole" by Sept. 14, Snider con­
tinued. "In short, the overall ob­
jective has been met." 
But Snider also said the Pentagon approved some exceptions to Weinberger's order. While he declined to offer figures, he said the goal won't be met by the National Security Agency and the Defense In­telligence Agency because their employees "have an undisputed need for a clearance." 
As for chances of new cuts, Snider said, "I do not anticipate funhcr across-the-board reductions at this time." 
Snider also noted, however, that Navy Secretary John Lehman has set a goal of reducing Navy clearances by 50 percent as soon as pos!liblc.

Spielberg inaugurates extraterrestial search 
HARVARD, Mass. -With the touch of a lever, "E.T." director Steven Spielberg yesterday inaugurated a search for real-life extraterrestrials, switching on a giant antenna that astronomers hope will detect radio signals sent from outer space. 
"This marks the beginning of a really powerful search that has a decent chance of finding someth­ing," said Paul Horowitz, a Harvard University professor who designed the 84-foot communications dish, part of the most powerful radio­scanning system ever used to hunt for aliens. 
The dish, capable of scanning 8.4 million radio channels, marks an es­calation of such efforts by The Planetary Society, which scans the skies for signs of life from its Oak Ridge Observatory in Harvard, a small town northwest ofBoston. 
Since 1983, the space-watching group had been searching with a simpler scanner, which picked up only 180,000 radio channels. 
The new antenna, known as Project Meta, was built with the help of a UOO,OOO grant from Spielberg, the science fiction filmmaker whose credits include "Close Encounters ofthe Third Kind" and "E.T.," which featured a lovable alien. 
Spielberg whisked into Harvard just long enough to flip on the an­tenna with the help ofhis infant son, Max. The communications dish hummed as it rotated skyward. 
"It's the most sophisticated search for extratrrestrial Intelligence in human history," said Carl Silgan, the popular science writer and presi­dent of the Planetary Society, who joined Spielberg, Horowitz and ot­her astronomers at the observatory to dedicate the antenna. Afterwards, they toasted the event with cham­pagne. 
Horowitz said the antenna was capable of reaching to the edges of the known galaxy. If there is life on other planets, he said, "this kind of communications system can do the job." He said he will visit the obser­vatory once every two weeks to check on the project. 
The scanner, which took two years to construct, is more versatile than its predecessor and includes changes that should increase the chances of raising alien messages. The antenna is hooked up to a com­puter room, which records all radio signals emitted from space. 
The previous system had turned up only the radio waves that all planets naturally produce, but im­provements in the scanner keep him 
hoping  for  concrete  results,  
Horowitz said .  
He  said  astronomers  will  be  

looking for a narrow radio signal to indicate other life forms. 
"We're looking for planetary sys­tems around stars," he said. "There are more than 1 million stars, so the cheapest way to look at a million stars is to look at everything at once." 
Because ofhis involvement in the project, Spielberg said he'd be happy ifthe antenna was the first to pick up signs oflife beyond Earth.

So here you are. You've been up 
for 34 hours straight and things are 
starting to get a mite blurry. Your

The best place to sleep on <:ampus is in class. Eight o'clock classes and lectures are traditional favorites but a few hardcores are now sleeping through chem lab and the phys ed swimming lessons. Clas.o;cs are good places to sleep because you have probably already finished your homework and be­cause the seats in the library auditorium are more comfortable than your bed. 
If you're In a psychology class the teacher will probably want you to sleep because then you'll dream. When you wake up the class can analyze your dream and discover your foot fetish. 
Pa.'iSing out and sleepjng are often confused at Notre Dame. People who pass out do not wake up when you kick them in the head. This is also a good time to shave off beards, moustaches, eyebrows, ears, and 

even whole heads ot hair. 
How to sleep 

If you are going to sleep in class, do it right. Subtle people put their heads on their desk and are hardly noticeable. Obnoxious people tend to cock their heads back at 90­degree angles and leave their mouths wide open. They snore and make rude noises with their nose. 
Eight o'clock classes and lectures are traditional favorites but a few hardcores are now sleeping through chem lab and the phys -ed swimming lessons. 

People who are somewhere between obnoxious and subtle tilt their heads forward on their chests and try real hard to keep their eyes open. These folks are bad news because: they drool when they sleep and they leave class with wet spots on their clothing.

Special Section: the all-rupter 
An all-nighter occurs when you have not done any ofyour homework and you must have It all done by tomorrow. AJJ-nighters last from 9 p.m. to 8 a.m. and they are grueling affidrs. Sleep is not an option and you couldn't sleep ifyou wanted to because: you're too cranked up on Cherry Coke and all-nightcr: "Giuuuuuuupt fsbvjk nw qsas88 mnfdwa sppUzj!" 
Someday you will sleep normally again. No longer will roommates tum on the lights at four o'clock. No longer will you drool on your­sc::lfin calc 125. Never again will you sleep on floors and In cars. Dreams ofEmil will cc::asc:: and you will never again be forced to watch the sun rise: through a haze of Cherry Coke and Folger's Crystals. That day is coming but not very quickly. "Sleep, who nc::c::ds itr' shall be your motto and yawns shall follow you all the days ofthe semester. 

'Handintan' brings curious looks to Farley 
Mark Mellett 
features writer 

W 
hen I first walk in, I get a few 
funny looks like what are you 
doing here." This is the reaction joe 
Rae Lukowski receives when she 
opens the door to her new hand­
iman job at Farley Hall. 
"But once I start whatever I'm doing they forget I'm even there," she says. 
Seeing a woman carrying a ham­mer or a wrench may put a curious look on some peoples faces, but tools toJoe Rae are what the pencil is to the writer or the calculator to the accountant, for she is a rarity at Notre Dame -a woman repairman. 
General repairs are her speciality. Screen windows, bolsters, door knobs, tile -you complain about It, Lukowski will doctor it. 
What interests Lukowski in such an occupation? "What's a good way to put this? You work with your hands," she said. You're all over the place and it's a challenge." 
Lukowski is a native ofGranger, Ind. Previously she worked as a janitor in Farely Hall for five years. With this experience Lukowski applied for the handlman job. The management "talked a lot about It," she said, adding, "lt was not handed to me on a sliver plater." 
Anne Finch, an resident assistant in Farely who has known Lukowski for three years, has nothing but compliments for her. "She's com­petent and capable." Finch said she 
~ 

was happy to hear Lukowski finally , received the job after two un­successful tries. "It's not that she is ,1 a women. It's that she is able to do 
, 
the job," said Finch. 
Along with the tools came some 
male skepticism. Lukowski has 
received some extra attention from 
odle men employees but conceded 
that most have been helpful. 
"They're adjusting as I am," she 
said. "They are there to help me 
when I need it and see that safety is 
taken. If I'm working over there on 
the saw, they make sure I don't cut 
my fingers off." 
When Lukowski is not tightening this or fastening that, she is on her way to the next repair. "It's very busy and I like to be busy," remarked the woman who handles 19 campus buildings from her shop In Farley. "Time goes zip." 
With her bubbling personality, Lukowski makes even the basement repair shop liven up. She comes to work clad In the appropriate Notre Dame employees' shirt and blue jeans. She also carries a ring ofkeys, the distinction of moSt building handlmen. Underneath this uniform is a truly geniune person. She Is a person being hersc::lfand doing what she wants to do. "I'm a normal human being and I do things any normal girl does. I love my job."

Inconsiderate fans can ruin game for the others 
Before I came to Notre Dame last fall, I had an image of what a Notre Dame student was like. I came to visit the campus during March, but my visit coincided with Spring Break, so I 'was unable to meet many students. The few I did meet, however, left an impression on me that I always will remember. 
WllliamJ. Curran guest column 
I had been on campus for all offive minutes, after a 13 1/2 hour trip from New York, when I met my first on-campus Notre Dame student. He hailed from England, accent and all. His show of concern was one of my reasons for coming here. He thought nothingoftaking the time to help us orient ourselves with the campus map or showing us his room. 
While I walked around noticing the beauty of the campus, my parents met another stu­dent who acted in a similar manner to the first. It was this special, friendly feeling, the beauty ofthe campus (in addition to academics, etc.) that let me know this was the place for me. That special feeling is unique to Notre Dame. I visited other campuses such as Cornell Uni-. versity (which is itself a fine Ivy League uni­
versity), but that special feeling was absent. 
Last fall, the feeling was magnified at my first "home" football game. I never had seen such spirit and love for one's school as I had at the Hoosier Dome for our game against Purdue. Chanting "We are ND" at 6 a.m. while waiting for the arrival of the bus was a sign of real spirit. My tickets for our first home game at Notre Dame Stadium were in row 58 ofthe freshman section. They were not the greatest seats in the house, but we had a great time learning all the new cheers, rooting for our team and yelling. 
I wrote home telling of the spirit in the stands. It was something that I never had ex­perienced before and I wanted to share my excitement. 
Similarly, I found that special feeling when I recently attended the Mass held at Sacred Hean Church last Tuesday for Kevin Hurley, the freshman who is presently in the hospital in serious condition. At this Mass, there were more than 1,200 people by my calculation. 
When one realizes that Kevin was only on campus for a few weeks and that he could not possibly have known even one'third of those in attendence, one has to feel that special force behind this University. It is bean­warming to know that the Notre Dame spirit and love still are going strong. 
Yet, sometimes it is hidden from plain view, Such was the case at our first home game last week against ·Michigan State. There were people there so intoxicated they had difficulty standing. They fell often, and took 1 0 people with them each time. How can one enjoy the game and the Notre Dame spirit when one is continually knocked down by other fans? 
After having looked forward to the football game for so long, I'm sure many were disap­pointed because of the inconsiderate be­havior of others. Ifyou're going to tailgate, as I'm sure you'll want to do, leave it in the parking lot. Show a little counesy for your fel­low students. 
I was surprised to find beer cans in the stands at this year's home opener. Last year, we enjoyed the game and never saw any of these things going on. After the loss to Mic­higan the week before, the Irish victory was a welcome relief. It's too bad that some fans weren't allowed to enjoy it like it should be enjoyed.

Sacrament of Reconciliation often neglected 
Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, and Lent, the time offasting and preparation in an­ticipation of Christ Jesus's resurrection are both holidays set aside in theJudeo-Christian culture to reflect upon our sins. But it is not only to reflect upon our sins that we observe these special days. It is also to make sacrifices to God in reparation for those sins.

Quote of the day 
How many roads must a man walk down before you call him a man? 
Bob Dylan 

We as college students have the obligation and ability to act on injustice and human right issues. Justice defined is a very subjective term open to many interpretations. It is also an intrinsic pan ofour value system. We have a responsibility to act upon our values. We know what is right and wrong, and to see ot­hers being treated unjustly and to ignore this issue shows a lack of concern and a large degree ofself-centeredness.

weekly and daily at Masses, little attention is 
given to the Sacrament ofReconciliation. Cer­
tainly, the church and chapels packed with 
fervent students attests to the true Catholic 
spirit ofthis University and its members. 
Nevertheless, for some strange reason the Sacrament ofReconciliation seems neglected. Various reasons can be given for such neglect. Many persons now see the sacrament as su­perfluous because they talk to God and he forgives them. Besides, in Mass, everybody prays a collective confession. These acts seem to fulfill the role ofconfession. 
Such reasons, although enticing because of the double bonus they convey, (Mass and confession and prayer and confession for the price of one), ring untrue. If those means of confession were appropriate and sufficient, the Church would never have instituted the Sacrament of Reconciliation. Moreover, if confession without a priest conveys the full­ness of the sacrament, shouldn't Mass also be possible without a priest? 
The arguments ring hollow--to all but the most accommodating ear. Yet, the sacrament remains unused. One reason for this neldect may be because sin has been done away with in modern times. 
This has been accomplished in a variety of ways. Just as this age has been able to do away with so many other evils such as the diseases and epidemics of the past, so we have done away with sin. Withoutsin, we need not worry about guilt; psychologists tell us that such feelings are unhealthy anyway. Also, most of us do not sin anymore; we are victims ofcon­sequences and our backgrounds. i.e. we were drunk, or we did it because our parents did not raise us in the right environment. 
But even those who do occassionally sin, fail to go to confession. It just does not feel good. Who wants to talk to someone else about their most intimate weaknesses? This is especially true when that person may see one everyday and consorts with one's fellow stu­dents. It is difficult to confess one's sins in a serious way to someone who is just like everybody else. 
Although a variety of reasons exist for the demise ofconfession, none suffices to explain why so many persons do not panake of the sacrament regularly. This was brought home poignantly one day while I was in Rome.l was waiting in St. Peter's Church to go to confes­sion. A nun had gone into the confessional before me and had spent nearly thirty minutes there. I turned to a friend of mine and men­tioned something about how many sins that nun must have had. My friend responded by saying that it was probably just the opposite. This nun was so concerned for her soul and so anxious to be forgiven that she had probably elaborated on every bad thought and action she had since her confession the week before. 
Properly corrected, I figured if I used that nun's scale I would be in the confessional for weeks. After going to confession that time, and every time since, I have thought about that nun, and her struggle for perfection. It is a struggle we all should embrace. It is a struggle in which all need the graces that come only through the sacrament of reconciliation. Per­haps it is best characterized by the final words ofthe priest in the confessional -go, and sin no more.

ofjustice and human rights." 

Injustice is not only in the third world, it is right here on your doorstep. Open your eyes and see. Every person has been treated un­justly. It can be as simple as receiving a grade you didn't deserve or beingturned down from a job you could have succeeded in doing. Na­tional and international injustices are simply a large group ofpeople being treated unfairly. 
We are all human beings and should feel a responsibility towards our fellow man. we·are bound by the thin thread which holds us all together as humans with rights. 
A Brazilian theologian once stated "The road is travelled by walking." Each person is imponant in the march towards justice. By working together we must believe we can make a difference. 
Saint Mary's and Notre Dame offer a veriety of classes and organizations which deal with justice education and human rights. Saint Mary's is also offering a justice education minor for those who are interested. 
The urban plunge is a program through which students can experience the life of the poor and the way they are treated. After the plunge students are urged to take a follow up class named "People and Justice." The course expands upon the discoveries made during the Urban Plunge. The class emphasizes reflection, study and solutions towards action. It answers the questions of the students con­cerning what individuals can do next. Or­ganizations such as Amnesty International, Peacemakers, Appalachian Plunge, Hunger Coalition, and Rasta expand upon the various aspects of justice and deal with them accord­ingly.

P.O. Box Q 
Excuses do not solve 
the problems at ND 
DearEditor: 
Dan McCullough recently wrote an article 
equating the residence hall system here at 
Notre Dame to a traditional fraternity system. 
It was definitely the biggest joke that I have 
read in quite a long time. 
Neglecting the alcohol policy, parietals, menacing re<:tors, quiet hours and several ot· her juvenile disciplines, we do have someth· ing in common with fraternities and sororities: we live in building.~. 
The key function of the greek system is Its social benefits. Obviously, since social life here is equivalent to watching the paint dry, there is no possible way that a realistic anal­ogy can be drawn between residence halls ami fraternities. · 
Thus, the key point I am trying to mal<e 
about this article and most of the articles and 
letters that appear in The Observer is this: 
every seemingly logical and "mature" answer 
to t~e great number ofinjustices that occur at 
Notre Dame can all be tied up in a single 
bunch and labled "excuses and com­
promises." 
For example, someone writes in that the 
teaching here is deficient. Someone else 
answers and says, "If it is so bad here why 
don't you go somewhere else?" 
Why are all these complaints answered with compromises and excuses? I guess some people spend their lives continually avoiding the facts. Uke all those oppressed in South Africa. Now why do you suppose that they are complaining. I mean if they don't like it, why don't they just leave?l am not trying to mal<e fun of the situation in South Africa, I am just trying to draw a strong analogy. They probably have more freedom than we do anyway. 
So why don't you get real McCullough,and write something that is non-fiction. You probably believe in the tooth fairy, too.

Removal of stereotypes will allow for equality 
Dear Editor: 
In his rebuttal on Sept. 20, Don Johnson brought up several very misguided points about the recent Saint Mary's student ticket price increase (from o;o percent to 67 percent ofa general admission ticket). 
He first stated,"Saint Mary's is not Notre Dame." Ingenious observation. Saint Mary's, however, Is an integral part ofwhat I've come to know as the "Notre Dame community." This includes social and academic aspects, as Johnson himself points out by saying,"some of us (Notre Dame students) take classes there, (and vice versa)." 
Have you ever, Don johnson, paid addi· tiona! tuition to take these classes as you would if you were to take these at any other school in the nation? This certainly should tell even the casual observer something about the community surrounding these two very respected schools. 
Johnson also stated, "Before deciding that the ticket office is a grossly chauvinistic bureau of Saint Mary's College-hating officials ...." It is not the ticket office which is chauvinistic. 
"I find no fault at all with Saint Mary's girls," Johnson also said. "I think everyone should date one at least once." I was under the Impression the ignorance behind stereotypes died in the deep south in the civil rights move­ment ofthe 1960s. 
I was obviously wrong. Ignorance evidently reigns on one of the best liberal arts college campuses in the country. 
In light of my last point, I must agree with 
his point, "Before equality can end, it must 
start." Remove stereotypes and chauvinistic 
attitudes, and equality will begin.

News reports may open hearts to Mexicans 
Dear Editor: 

John Conroy did not take certain key points into consideration in his comments on the front page Observer article dealing with the earthquake in Mexico. Conroy, in the Sept. 25 edition, accused the media of "irresponsible journalism," stating they had blown out of proportion the situation in Mexico City. He cited that cars were moving, and that physical structures were intact ouside of the center city. 
Conroy's trip to Mexico City is understan· 
dable, because his child lives there. Regard· 
less ofConroy's good intentions, however, his 
comments arc insensitive to the hidden 
realities of the earthqual<c. 

The death count now is estimated as high as 
4,000. That is about half of the number of 
people at Notre Dame. The figure may con­
tinue to rise. The threat of disease spreading 
from rotting bodies Is forcing authorities to 
bury or cremate unclaimed bodies. Many 
children are now homeless and have no 
knowledge of their parents' fate. Many 
families with no resources have lost their 
homes with no place to go. 

Above all this, Mexico's economy is falter­ing and poverty is a way of life for millions of Mexicans. The quake only has worsened life for the poor of Mexico City. Millions before the qual<c had no sewage system or running water. With utili9cs and city services paralyzed, the quake has intensified poverty for Mexico City's poor. 
Moreover, the poor do not have the resources to rebuild their fOlonies. The Jack of proper nutrition raises the oppressive im­pact ofpoverty. 
IfU.S. journalists sensationalized the qual<c, 
Bravisimo! It has awal<ened the hearts ofmany 
U.S. citizens, Hispanic, Anglo, black and ot­herwise, to give something ofthemselves. W c all have seen the television reports and the newspapers which have touched everyone of us to some degree. 
People across the United States arc con· tributing their clothes, time, money and prayers. They have been moved to do so after seeing and reading the reports. Journalism is not the only catalyst that has brought on this response, but it has helped. 
Thank God the 1 0 members of the Notre Dame family in Mexico City are fine. But the Notre Dame family should not stop with those ten; there are millions of residents in Mexico City who are not fine. The 10 students in Mexico City arc giving their time to rescue and relief efforts. Although we arc not in Mexico City, there are many concrete relief efforts we can undertal<c at Notre Dame, just as the thousands across this nation arc doing.

Warnings on records put blinders on children 
DearEditor: 
It is sad to see that attitudes like Maura Man­
dyck's still exist. It seems that Puritanism still 
exists in the 20th century. 
The "genius" wives of the Washington con· 
grcssmcn claim that what they arc asking for 
isn't censorship, it is repression. Repression is 
just as bad as censorship. 
The solution lies in bringing up the children. You can't raise the youth ofAmerica with blinders on. They must be prepared for life in the real world. Yes, sex, drugs, violence and body functions exist in the real world. 
Parents must instill values in their children 
so they can distinguish between what is 
wrong or right and act accordingly. If a child 
automatically docs what a lyric says, the 
parents have failed in teaching their child. 
America is supposedly a free country. Give 
musicians their freedom of expression and 
don't let the parents push their responsibility 
on someone else.

Dating not related to 
football ticket prices 
DearEditor: 
I agree with the point Donjohnson made in his letter ofSept. 20. Because Saint Mary's and Notre Dame are separate schools, there is no reason for Saint Mary's women to get the same football ticket discount Notre Dame students receive. 
There is one question, however, that I would like to address to Johnson. What do dates have to do with footballtickets? 
judy Gibbons leMansHall 
Pettifer challenged to write positive letter 
DearEditor: 
This is an open letter to Ann Pettifcr, Notre 
Dame Alumna. 
Would you look back In your files to sec if you can find a letter or column in which you said anything good about anybody or anyth­ing? Perhaps my memory fails me, but I carmot remember a time in the past four years when this has occurred. 
What satisfaction do you gain from blasting Janet Smith, who works tirelessly through the 


Women's Care Center to turn women away  
from abortion? Why should she not center her  
labors on her faith and her solid belief in the  
teachings of the Church in this area? I carmot  
think of a better rationale for her to do the  
work she docs. Rather than demean her work  
at the Center by characterizing it as a sad con­ 
fusion based on sexism, why not praise her for  
saving the lives of those children who ot·  
herwise would have been extinguished?  
Perhaps the kind ofgood that the Women's  
Care Center has been able to bring about is  
not dependant upon public acknowledge­ 
ment, but those individuals who work for the  
Center and make it an important part of their  
lives should certainly be encouraged In their  
goals.  
Pcttlfcr, a couple ofstudents in the Program  
of Uberal Studies (another bastion of right·  - 
wingcry like the Law School) once told me  
that you are nothing lilce the harsh and com­ 
bative individual that the Notre Dame com­ 
munity has seen in print over the years. They  
claimed that you are really a very pleasant lady  
whose main concern is to challenge apathy,  
admittedly a noble vocation. I would  
welcome evidence that supports this conten­ 
tion.  
True, Notre Dame is a university steeped in  
tradition, a characteristic revered by many  
people throughout the country. Yet tradition  
is not always a good thing, as I am sure you will  
agree. Therefore, I will ask you to break what  
has become a mini-tradition of constant  
criticism (for at least one column) by devot­ 
ing your prodigious rhetorical energies to the  
praise of someone associated with Notre  
Dame and/or Catholicism. I think it would be  
a refreshing change.  
Surely you can find someone or something  
to compliment! Hint: certainly, Smith and the  
Women's Care Center would benefit from  
your support.  
How about it Pcttlfer? Will you accept my  
challenge?

how Irish respond to loss" and have the nerve

Hayes enters hospital 
COLUMBUS, Ohio · Former Ohio State University football coach Woody Hayes was admitted to Uni­versity Hospitals here yesterday morning after suffering what his physician said was a mild heart at­tack. 
"The fact is, he had an attack this morning," said Dr. Robert Murphy, an Ohio State University athletic physician. "But he's doing fine." 
Murphy said the attack was due to congestive heart failure, but he declined to give more information on Hayes' condition. 
Hospital spokesman Doug Brandt said Hayes, 72, was admitted about 7 
a.m. and was in satisfactory condi­tion Sunday night. He said Hayes is expected to remain hospitalized for "at least a week." 
Brandt declined to say whether Hayes was in intensive care. 
"We were told not to release anything about his room," Brandt said. "But I can assure you he's not hooked up to a respirator or anyth­ing." 
Hayes suffered a mild stroke in May while on a Canadian speaking trip and oniy recently had begun to resume public appearances. 
Brandt said Hayes was treated at the Columbus facility in 1974 for a heart attack. 
He said he does not believe Hayes' shortness of breath and coughing has anything to do with his stroke. 
Asked when Hayes will be released, Brandt said "all I know is we'll keep him here for at least a week. That's what we normally do when Woody comes ln."

SAN ANTONIO, Texas -Heavy rain wiped out play Sunday in the storm-delayed $350,000 Texas Open and forced a postponement until Monday ofthe golftournament wind-up. 
More than three inches ofrain fell early Sunday, flooding the Oak Hills Country Club. 
"The golf course was just un­playable," said Mike Shea, tourna­ment supervisor for the PGA tour. 
The schedule now calls for the completion ofthird round play early Monday morning with the fourth 

The forecast is for continued rain Monday morning, with clearing in the afternoon. 
"In the event we complete the third round, but weather prevents us from playing the fourth round, the sponsor has agreed to pay the full purse and we'll have a 54-hole tournament," Shea said. 
Tournament leader Jodie Mudd and 14 other players have yet to complete their third-round play. 
A series of thunderstorms forced two delays Saturday and the day's 
At that point Mudd, 25, seeking his first PGA tour victory, held a five­shot lead. He was 13-under-par for the tournament with five holes to play in the third round. 
He was trailed by John Mahaffey and Mark Hayes, each at S-under-par for the tournament. Mahaffey has completed 1 5 holes of third round play and Hayes has finished 13 holes. ,

didn't have any zip on his passes," said Woodson. "I suppose that was because ofhis shoulder injury. 
"I think as soon as he (Beuerlein) gets the ball and looks at his in­tended receiver, he never takes his eye off him." 
But Beuerlein's problems were not the sole reason for Notre Dame's offensive woes. As was the case two weeks ago when the Irish lost to Michigan, Notre Dame's play selc­tion was questionable. On their first 13 first-down plays the Irish called 11 running plays, with Pinkett get­ting the call on seven of the first nine. 
"Steve wasn't throwing the ball as accurately as he has been," noted Faust. "We felt we could run on them on first down." 
That belief proved false, and Notre Dame backed itself into a comer by not passing until it had to. The Irish trailed 21-3 heading into the fourth quarter before they scored their first touchdown on a three-yard run by Pinkett. Beuerlein hit Pat Cusack with a pass for a two­point conversion that made the score 21-11, with close to nine minutes left. 
When Purdue gave them the ball right back after three plays and a 10­yard punt, the Irish had a chance to make things interesting. They had a first down at their own 49-yard line. 
"I felt we were still in the ball game at that point," said Faust. "We were within striking distance with more than six minutes left, but we didn't move the ball -their defense held." 
That was something that Purdue's to 21 7, and scored on four drives of 78 yards or longer. 
Late in the second quarter, one of those drives was kept alive by a criti­cal penalty for "illegal participa­tion." What that meant was too many men on the field, and the results were disastrous for Notre Dame. Instead offacing a fourth-and­eight on the Irish 41, Purdue wound up with a first down on the 26. Four plays later, Everett hit Ray Wallace for a 15-yard touchdown pass and a 14-0 lead. 
"That was a case of disorganiza­tion," said Irish cornerback Mike Haywood. "It's one of those things where a guy (the sixth defensive back) is coming out on the field not calling out the new coverage. It's a situation where there's a lack of communication, and when people aren't concentrating there's going to be mental mistakes that will cost us." 
So far the mistakes have proven all too costly, and with 4-0 Air Force coming up next Saturday fn Colorado Springs, the time to start concentrating is now.

Saint Mary's finishes in third place in invitational tournament at home 

ByJD.L SARBENOFF 
Sports Writer 
On Saturday, the Saint Mary's vol­
leyball team finished third in an in­
vitational tournament at Angela 
Athletic Facility. Other teams 
featured in the tournament were 
Bethel College, Lake Michigan Col­
lege, Manchester College and Tri­
State University. 
The Belles triumphed over Bethel College, 12-15, 15-9, 15-3, in the first round. Junior Mary Reidy of Lake Bluff, ill. had four kills in the first game. Moira Cronan, a sop­homore from Overland Park, Kan., contributed six serves, while fresh' man Tammy Suth, a South Bend native, led in serve receptions. Sop­homore Colleen Mergens of Chicago had eight assists. 
In the second game, freshman Margaret Feldman from Naperville, Ill., and Reidy both had five kills. Sophomore Kara Telrulve of In­dianapolis had seven pass attempts. Mergens again led in assists with 19. 
In the third game of the first round, it was Reidy who had six kills. Freshman Katherine Koller, another South Bend native, had seven serve attempts, and Mergens had 13 as­sists. 
After not playing in the second round, the Belles were defeated in the third round by Lake Michigan

miles," said Warth, "but I was hur­
ting towards the end." 
Ron Markezich finished three 
seconds behind Warth for 17th 
place. Markezich, a freshman, has 
been very impressive in his first two 
races. 
"They started out f.lst, a lot f.lster 
than in the first race," said 
Markezich. "I just came back again." 
Jeff Van Wie was the final runner to score for the Irish, crossing the finish line at 25:39 in 47th place. 
Missing from the race were Mike 
Collins and Dan Garrett. Collins was 
set to run on Thursday, but Friday 
morning his ankle swelled, forcing 
him to sit out the race. Garrett did 
not run because ofa groin injury, but 
he is expected back soon. 
Notre Dame head coachJoe Piane College, who was favored to win coming into the tourney. The score of the match was 16-14, 12-15, 12­15. 
In the first game of round three, Feldman had six kills and eight pass attempts. Reidy's two blocks for points helped fire-up the offense, as did Mergens' 18 assists. 
Feldman paced the team in kills and pass attempts in the ~cond game. Reidy led in serve attempts, and Mergens had 15 assists for the Belles. 
Suth contributed eight kills, followed by Feldman and Reidy with five, in the third game. In addition, Reidy also had nine serve recep­tions. Mergens once again had an outstanding game with 3 7 assists. 
Manchester defeated Saint Mary's in round four, 15-11, 15-7. In the first game, Feldman and Reidy had four kills apiece. Feldman also had one block, as did Telrulve, and eight serve receptions. Mergens led in serves with seven and in assists with 15. 
Feldman had three kills in the second game. Suth and Telrulve had six receptions each for the Belles. Mergens, meanwhile, had six serves and 10 assists. 
In the fifth and final round for Saint Mary's, the Belles lost to Tri­State University, 15-9, 7-15, 9-15. 
Lake Michigan College won the tournament, beating Manchester in 
wanted very much to win, but he was happy with the way his team performed. 
"I would have loved to win it, but I'm satisfied," said Piane. "Our kids competed well, very well. 
"Everybody on the team can run better," he continued. "But Magill and Warth did a hell of a job, and Markezich already improved on his first race. Van Wie ran well in only his second varsity race, and Tyler ran with alot ofguts. 
"We were the only team with four runners in the top 20," continued Piane. "Ifwe had Garrett and Collins, we would have won it." 
Piane also commented on the meet's champs, St. Thomas. 
"They ran very well," he said. "They returned six of their top seven runners from last year, and they got a transfer student who is now their top runner."

Coach Mary Jo Lambert feels really good about her team's play be­cause the team is playing well as a unit. 
"I am really pleased with their progress. The highlight of the tournament was the match with Lake Michigan. In a couple more weeks, we will have a much stronger offense." 
Coach Lambert went on to say that she felt it was an advantage that the team was so young. 
"I think it is an advantage because I can train them my way," she said. 
She also felt that although the team played extremely well as a unit, there were a couple of players who had really outstanding games. In particular, she mentioned Kara Tekulve. 
"She is our ace-in-the-hole," said Lambert. 
However, the volleyball coach also cited Margaret Feldman, Mary Reidy and Tammy Suth for being so solid and consistent. 
Kara Telrulve also was happy with

Astrong performance by the team as a whole gave the Notre Dame cross country team third place in the National Catholic cross country meet Friday afternoon.

Everett has great day to whip Notre Dame 
By LARRY BURKE 
Assistant Sports Editor 
WEST LAFAYETfE, Ind. -This time there were no surprises, no last-minute starter at quarterback, and most of all, no excuses. There was just Jim Everett's arm combined with a Purdue defense that was made to look a lot better than it really is. 
What it all added up to was a 35­17 loss for Notre Dame and a very real indication that the Irish are in real trouble. 
No this wasn't 1984 and it wasn't the Hoosier Dome, although there were some similarities, most of which centered around the quality, or lack thereof, of Notre Dame's play. There also were some dif­ferences -this time the Irish knew what was coming and they knew who Jim Everett was, but the results indicated that there was little they could do about stopping him, or about moving the ball with any con­sistency, for that matter. 
"I've got to give Everett a lot of credit," said Irish coach Gerry Faust. "We tried everything against him ­blitzing, adjusting our defensive fronts, but he just picked us apart. There's no doubt he's an excellent quarterback, one of the better quar­terbacks we've faced in all my years at Notre Dame. 
"The shotgun formation gives him a lot of time to get well-set back there in the pocket. Their offensive line did a good job picking up our blitzes and stunts, so they kept Everett in good shape. Even when we ftushed him out ofthe pocket, he 
· was able to run for yardage." 
Everett deserved a lot ofcredit for disecting the Notre Dame defense for 27 completions in 49 attempts that added up to 368 yards and three touchdowns. But the fact was that things could, and perhaps should, have been a lot worse. Several times Everett overthrew open receivers, and in the first quarter a wide-open Mark Jackson dropped a sure touch­down pass on a third-and-one play when the Notre Dame defense was fooled by a play-action fake. 
It was Notre Dame's offense, 
however, that was the biggest 
problem -in terms of on-the-field 
performance as well as play selec­
tion. The Boilers were keying on Al­
len Pinkett, and they shut him down 
to the tune of4 5 yards on 21 carries ­
his lowest rushing total since the 
1982 season finale when he was held 
to 4 3 yards. And as is so often the 
case with the Notre Dame offense, as 
Pinkett goes so go the Irish. 

Notre Dame's problems on the ground (56 net rushing yards in 4 1 attempts) were matched by its problems in the air. Quarterback Steve Beuerlein was off the mark all day, finishing with just seven completions in 25 attempts for 88 yards. Twice Beuerlein was replaced by spohomore backup Terry Andrysiak, but it was painfully ob­vious that the offense needed a lot more spark than either was able to provide. 
"I just wasn't doing the job," Beuerlein said of his fourth-quarter benching. "It was the worst game I've ever played in my life -one game I'm really ashamed of. I was missing open receivers, and once I missed the first few I started pressing a little. That's something a third-year quar­terback can't afford to do." 
Purdue free safety Ron Woodson, who picked off an Andrysiak pass late in the game and took it back for a touchdown to put the final nail in Notre Dame's coffin, was outspoken in his opinion of Beuerlein. 
"As I came onto the field (before the game), I saw that Beuerlein

No doubt about it, the Irish stunk 
WEST LAFAYETI'E, Ind. -It would be best to start by stating the obvious. Notre Dame's showing here Saturday against Purdue was worse than bad. To be blunt, the Irish stunk, and the players even said it themselves. 
Probably the worst game Notre Dame has played in Gerry Faust's five years as head coach, the 35-17loss to the Boilers begins to bring into question Faust's future in South Bend. Problems which have plagued Notre Dame teams throughout the lastfour seasons showed up again Saturday, their existence painfully obvious to anyone in attendance. 
The Irish offense again was predictable and uni­maginative. On 11 ofits first 13 first-down plays in the first half, Notre Dame chose to run. Of the first nine such situa­tions, Allen Pinkett was given the ball on seven occasions, including one stretch of six straight. The 11 first-down runs produced a grand total of 21 yards, an average of 1.9. 
"We felt we could run the ball on them in the first half," said Faust. 
Evidently not. 

Notre Dame lacked organization on its sideline, leaving 
the Irish with a slew ofmental mistakes to their credit. The 
key error Saturday was a 15-yard penalty late in the second 
quarter for "illegal participation." After stopping Purdue 
on third down to leave the Boilers with fourth-and-eight, 
officials ruled the Irish had 12 men on the field for the play. 
Notre Dame coaches had sent a sixth defensive back into the game, but somehow the change did not become evi­dent to those playing. The result on the field was a con­tinuation of Purdue's drive and a Boilermaker touchdown which gave the hometowners a 14-0 advantage. The result 
in the stands was amusement on the part of fans at Notre Dame's lack oforganization. 
A Purdue student trainer stationed on the Notre Dame sideline later described the situation there as chaos in com­parision to that ofother visiting schools. 
The list ofother such mental errors could go on and on.

At one point the Irish hurry out onto the field to punt, hoping to catcb Purdue unready to field the kick. But in­stead ofgetting the punt off quickly, Notre Dame is forced to wait for one ofthe punting team's integral players to run out onto the field, his arrival the last ofall on both sides of the ball. 
And third, the Irish lacked intensity in their play. After being criticized for the same after the Michigan game, Notre Dame showed a little more emotion last week against Michigan State and the result was a much more favorable one. Saturday, however, was a repeat of two weeks ago as the Irish again showed a deficiency in the emotion department. 
"We weren't as pumped up as we were for Michigan State," said quarterback Steve Beuerlein. "We weren't fiat, but the intensity wasn't the same as last week." 
No? 

There is but one way to describe the feeling oflrish fans following the recurrence ofthese mistakes.  
Frustration. 
And more frustration. 
Pinkett acknowledged this afterward, saying, "It hurts. I know as a fan it's frustrating, but it's even worse as a player, and especially as a senior. Still, I'm not ready to give up on any of the goals I set for this year, and one of them was getting to a major bowl." 
The players you feel sorry for are the ones who really care, like Pinkett, who came off the field in tears following an afternoon ofutter frustration. Unfortunately, there are a limited number ofsuch players. 
Faust, looking somewhat drained at his post-game press conference, reaffirmed his beliefthat things will get better for Notre Dame in the coming weeks. "I told the players that I still believe in them and in this coaching staff," he said. "We've got a lot of games left. I think things will be fine." 
Most Notre Dame fans would be hard pressed to believe the words of Faust. The chances that things will, in fact, be fine are dwindling with each passing week. 
Think about the captain of the Titanic. As his ship was sinking, do you think he expressed that belief? likely not, instead probably saying the ship soon would be righted and on its way again. It took 60 years to locate the Titanic. Hopefully, it doesn't take that long to find the Notre Dame program. 
Things will not get any better next week when the Irish must travel to Air Force. The Falcons have beaten Notre Dame each of the past three seasons, and there isn't much chance the oddsmakers will be favoring the Irish this year. 
"We've been through this before," Beuerlein said. "We've got to come back. We didn't represent ourselves or the University well on the field. People are just waiting for us to fold now." 
A national television audience will be tuned to ABC for the Air Force game; a majority ofwhich will be hoping for Notre Dame to roll over and die. Still, the Irish saw a similar situation last year after losing to South Carolina to go to 3-4. LSU was the foe the following week, and ABC was there with its cameras in anticipation ofthe fall ofNotre Dame. 
As Notre Dame fans know, though,, the Irish" fooled everyone, not only winning that game but the last three as well. Whether the same type ofthing can happen this year remains a big question mark. 
Through all this speculation, though, fans should not for­get that it still is their team.
