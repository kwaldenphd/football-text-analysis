Panama coup forces seek safety in U.S. 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Some of the military forces involved in the failed coup attempt in Panama have been flown by the United States to safety in Miami and invited to seek political asylum, the Bush administration said Tuesday. 
The State Department said 42 Panamanians had been admit­ted on humanitarian grounds. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the group in­cluded "coup members and their families." 
The group is believed to in­clude Adela Bonilla Giroldi, widow of the coup leader, Maj. Moises Giroldi. She was accom­panied by members of her fam­ily. 
Capt. Javier Licona, believed to be the highest-ranking par­ticipant in the coup to escape capture, also was reported to be in the United States. 
Citing concerns for their safety, Fitzwater refused to identify any of the refugees. He said the mere publishing of their pictures in a newspaper might result in their deaths. 
"The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service is pre­pared to review applications for political asylum if such re­quests are made," State De­partment spokeswoman Mar­garet Tutwiler said. 
She said the Panamanians are being received by the U.S. Catholic Conference, which pro­vides assistance to refugees and people given asylum. U.S. officials in Miami are debriefing them. 
Meanwhile. the Pentagon said there had been dissension and confusion among the coup leaders and an argument about what to do with Panamanian ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega, who survived the uprising. 
Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said it was clear that coup leader Giroldi "had no in­tention, ever," of turning Nor­iega over to the United States. 
However, Williams said an unnamed officer taking part in the coup insisted that Noriega should be given to the United States and argued with Giroldi about it. 
Williams said the officer eventually gave up the dispute and left the military headquar­ters, never to return, because he feared that Noriega would or had become aware of his opinions. 
Williams said the officer was among those who met later with U.S. Maj. Gen. Marc Cis­neros, the second in command of U.S. forces in the area. Williams said he could not say whether that officer made clear to Cisneros that there was a dissident faction among the Panamanian officers that wanted to turn Noriega over. 
The spokesman said it isn't clear to what extent the people claiming to hold Noriega for several hours really had him under their control. 
"You have someone who was one of the coup plotters saying, 'Well, we ought to turn Noriega over to the United States. He doesn't prevail, and he leaves. And he communicates (to the United States) that the people holding Gen. Noriega still have no intention of turning him over to the United States," Williams said. 
"There was never a request for us to come and get him, they never offered him to us," The spokesman said. 
Meanwhile, Fitzwater ac­knowledged at the White House that he had erred last week by saying U.S. troops were de­ployed in Panama at two key points merely to safeguard Americans and to protect the Panama Canal. In fact, the United States had been asked by the rebels to station the forces to block reinforcements for Noriega. 
Fitzwater said he had not been aware of the actual facts when he made his original statement. Likewise, Fitzwater also had said the United States had only third-party contact with the rebels before the coup, when in fact U.S. officials were in touch directly with Giroldi. 
Nevertheless, Fitzwater de­fended the administration's handling of the matter.

E. Germany may loosen stance 
Associated Press 
BERLIN -Communist officials met opposition leaders in Dresden and talks were expected soon in Leipzig in the first sign of a shift in the East German government's hard-line stance, news reports said Tuesday. 
Prominent Lutheran offi­cial Hans Otto Furian meanwhile said in East Berlin that the Communist Party "must give up its grip on total power." 
Also in East Berlin, pro­democracy activists said at least 500 protesters ar­rested in Dresden were freed the past two days. The activists, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said those freed were among about 1,000 people arrested in Dresden during demonstrations last week and over the weekend. 
The activists did not say if any of the demonstrators faced charges. Officials in Dresden have said all demonstrators not involved in violence will be released. 
Some Communist Party officials showed increasing signs of willingness Tues­day to talk with pro­democracy activists. But East German leader Erich Honecker reiterated his hard-line position. 
Conflicting reports also emerged on Tuesday as to whether the Lutheran Church had taken up a dia­logue with the central gov­
ernment  or  whether  the  
contacts  rem ained  on  the  
local level.  

West Germany's ZDF television network, quoting high-level church sources, said talks about the unrest "had begun with central of­fices" in the East German government. It did not elaborate or identify the participants. 
ZDF said talks between local Communist leaders in Leipzig and pro-democracy 
activists also are set to be­gin. It gave no timetable. Talks between Commu­
nist officials and opposition activists already have been held in Dresden. 
Communist officials in Dresden first met with op­position leaders on Mon­day. Mayor Wolfgang Berghofer said another meeting was scheduled for next week. 
The 77 -year-old Honecker has given no indication he is about to change his hard-line ways. 
In a meeting Monday with Chinese Vice Prime Minister Yao Yilin, Honecker re­peated allegations that Western "imperialists" are poised to threaten his country. 
Honecker and Yao re­called the events of June in Beijing, when troops crushed a pro-democracy movement. 
"In this respect, there is a fundamental lesson to be learned from the counter­revolutionary revolt in Bei­jing and the present

NATIONAL BRIEFS 
The Supreme Court turned away free-speech arguments Tuesday and allowed the use of a federal racketeering law against 26 anti-abortion protesters in Philadelphia.The court let stand a successful lawsuit against the protesters by the operators of an abortion clinic in that city. The litigation strategy has proved troubling to some abortion rights advocates, who fear that politi­cal protesters will be labeled "racketeers" and held financially li­able for nothing more than expressing their views. 
The flow of elderly to the South and West is economic good news for the states where they move, report two researchers who foresee increased competition among Sun Belt states to lure re­tirees. Incoming elderly don't arrive empty handed, and their spending on housing, food and other goods provides a multimil­lion-dollar boost to local economies, say Charles Longino of the University of Miami and William Crown of Brandeis University. 
A Christian couple and their eight children who fled religious persecution in the Soviet Union have become the targets of death threats, vandalism and a cross burning in their new home in White Bear Lake, Minn. "It's just ironic that they come here and experience more persecution," Judi Jankowski of the Minnesota chapter of World Relief, an arm of the National Association of Evangelicals, said Tuesday. 
With a luncheon featuring Vice President Dan Quayle bringing about $125,000 to the GOP on Tuesday, no one seemed to mind when he forgot the name of one of the party's three statewide candidates. About 450 people attended the $125-a-per­son lunch in Richmond, Virginia, honoring Republican candidate for governor J. Marshall Coleman. lieutenant governor nominee Eddy Dalton and attorney general candidate Joseph Benedetti. A couple of dozen people paid $3,000 each to attend a private recep­tion with Quayle. 
Engineers on Tuesday in Cape Canaveral, Florida troubleshot a puzzling engine problem that could delay for five or six days the planned launch of the space shuttle Atlantis carrying a nuclear-powered planetary probe into space. While the count­down continued despite the problem, NASA officials and workers also waited word from a Washington courtroom where a federal judge heard attorneys for three anti-nuclear groups ask that the launch scheduled for Thursday be cancelled. The plaintiffs argued that an explosion during liftoff could spread radioactive pluto­nium from Atlantis' payload over a wide area of east-central 
Florida. 
INDIANA BRIEFS 
The second bomb blast in two days at Anderson High School canceled classes again Tuesday, and a spate of telephoned bomb threats struck at least four other high schools in central Indiana. A small pipe bomb exploded about 7:35a.m. Tuesday in a hallway outside the school auditorium, said Charles Petersen, spe­cial agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in Indianapolis. A few students and teachers were in the building when the bomb went off, but no one was injured.

Ignorant college students are alarming sign of times 
This Monday, The Observer ran an Associated 
Press article about the relative ignorance of the 
average college student. According to the article 
one in four of the college seniors polled did not 
know that Christopher Columbus discovered 
America in 1492-they didn't even get the cor­
rect century. 
I'll refrain from listing the other statistics in the article, but I think the message should be quite clear: we are fast becoming a nation of ding dongs. It sounds funny, when you think of all those college students pointing to the Pacific Ocean on the map of the United States and say­ing it's the Atlantic Ocean, but it's really quite scary. 

Maybe these statistics don't apply to students at Notre Dame as much as they apply to stu­dents elsewhere. I'd like to think that anyone who is smart enough to get into this school would not mix up the Declaration of Indepen­dence with Mein Kampf, and at least know how to find their home state on a map. Of course, I don't know how many people have slipped through the cracks. 
Unfortunately, we can't live in an academic bubble. Once we get into the real world, we are going to live and work amongst people who may not have had the benefits of a good education, and we will be in the minority. It's rather em­barrassing that the generation before us are going to refer to all of us as a generation of boobs. 
So who is to blame? A lot of people blame the government-if only the president would put less money into weapons and more money into education, our children would be brighter. This is true-but it won't solve everything. President Bush could increase the education budget ten­fold and there would still be kids in this country who think Martin Luther King started the Protestant Reformation. 
So what can be done to prevent another gen­eration of ignorant people? In my opinion, a good education is like a triangle: you need three sides to make it work. 
One side of the triangle is the teacher. If a student is doing so poorly in school, the teacher should hold the kid back one year until he/she knows enough to go on to the next grade. Al­lowing an illiterate fifth grader to proceed to the sixth grade is not going to make things easier for the student; the kid will just get fur­ther and further behind and eventually give up on ever learning how to read and write. A teacher ought to be able to recognize problem students early on and help them out instead of sending them through the system like products on a conveyor belt. 
Another side of the triangle is the parents. Parenting is a full-time job and it's a lifetime commitment. Something is very wrong if par­ents don't know that their own child can't read or write. Our nation's teachers are responsible

for many students at a time, and they can't be 
expected to give each and every student the indi­
vidual attention that the child should be receiv­
ing at home. Every parent should spend enough 
"quality time" with their kids to see if they are 
learning anything at school. 
The last side of the triangle is the student. 
After all, the student has to put forth some ef­
fort or it won't matter how hard the kid's par­
ents and teachers are working. Every student 
has a stake in their own education; and they 
have to want to learn before they can start 
learning. Today's students should be worried 
that they're so ignorant about basic historical 
facts and geography. 
Maybe a lot of us think it's no big deal that we don't know what the Magna Carta is or during what half of the century the Civil War was fought. After all, what do a lot of historical documents, wars, and dead presidents have to do with our lives today? 
Not much, when you think about it, but there's an important principle involved. If we don't care now about how little we know about our history. literature, and geography, we will keep setting our educational standards further back, year after year, until the average 20 year old will be unable to read a Dr. Seuss book. 
How can we compete economically with coun­tries like Japan when most of us can't find Japan on a globe? There are a lot of countries out there with better educational systems than our own, and the best way to narrow the gap is to make education a greater concern in our na­tion and in our personal lives. No matter how affiuent our society as a whole may be, our na­tion can hardly be considered a world power if its inhabitants are no more intelligent than a rock. 
I sincerely hope that something is done soon to curb the tide of ignorance in this country be­fore we become the laughing stocks of the in­dustrial nations. We'll only end up hurting our own future if we accept academic mediocrity as the norm. We have seen the enemy, and it is us.

Trojan horse to visit pep rally 
By MONICA YANT News Copy Editor 
A 14-foot Trojan horse will lead a pre-USC game spirit pa­rade October 20, said Erich Straub of Irish Insanity at last night's Hall President's Council meeting. 
A skit performed by the the­atrical group Irish Accent and members of Irish Insanity has also been planned before the evening's pep rally. 
Irish Insanity constructed the horse to boost spirit and atten­dance at the pre-game pep rally. "Pep rallies have generally turned into an alumni event," said Straub. "We thought the horse was a perfect opportu­nity to get people over there again." 
The horse will be stationed around campus throughout the day, and from 6:15 to 6:30 p.m., it will travel around cam­pus picking up students to at­tend the pep rally. The Leprechaun may "pop up"

privately the process can take from an hour to two weeks. 
According to the president, "all relevant factors were brought into consideration, in­cluding the fact that most of these prisoners had already served many, many years of their sentences and are already advanced in years.... A favor­able climate currently ·exists in which the release can take place." 
The most prominent prisoner on the list is Sisulu, who ran day-to-day operations of the ANC as its secretary-general in 1949-54, when the government ordered him to resign. 
He was sentenced to life in June 1964, along with Mandela and other leaders of the ANC's internal military wing, for sab­otage and plotting the over­throw of the white government. Mandela already had spent two years in prison. 
Mandela's other co-defen­dants to be freed are Ahmed

Mpetha, the country's oldest political prisoner, was the ANC leader in Cape province and, during the appeal of his terror­ism sentence in 1983, was elected a co-president of the United Democratic Front. 
The judge said he did not want to send Mpetha to prison but that the Terrorism Act, since repealed, required it. 
No information was immedi­ately available on the eighth man to be freed, Jafta Masem­ula. 
Two other co-defendants of Mandela, Dennis Goldberg and Govan Mbeki, were freed previ­ously. 
Goldberg, the only white con­victed in the trial, was deported in 1985. 
Mbeki was released two years ago in what the government said was a test case for the possible release of Mandela. He was banned from speaking in public, talking to the press or leaving his hometown, even though the government had said his release was uncondi­tional.

Students fail to test the University's authority 
Why is it that at Notre Dame no one ever seems to question the authority of our adminis­tration, when the administra­tion allows so many things to happen that should not? 
I have thought of three ex­amples where students do not care and yet should. 
Take, for example, the class size of many upper level classes. We pay over $14,000 every year and the provost should realize that we should not have to put up with having more than 20 or at most 30 in our 400 and 500-level classes. The ideal would be to have only 10 or 15 in a class; to have 50 to 60 students in an upper level class is ridiculous. It is unfair to the teacher and to the stu­dent because there can be no interaetion on a personal level. This interaction is vital to a student's education. My fa­vorite classes are ones in which I know the teacher. It makes elass more enjoyable and it forces me to work harder be­cause I do not want to disap-
LETTERS 
point the teacher whom I also consider my friend. 
At IUPUI when a class gets too big they simply hire another teacher. One may argue that Notre Dame does not have the resources, but I believe that we do. Under the direction of the provost, the University could focus its attention away from construction of new buildings to financing the salaries of more teachers. Having more teachers would cause the class sizes to decrease. 
If there is a space problem for the increased number of new classes, then take some of the money that the University receives in donation and build elassrooms rather than quads. This would be immediately ben­eficial to all. Classes would be more intimate, fun, and chal­lenging. We should vocalize our eornplaints beeause our silence allows the provost to eontinue his policy of large classes. 
Another example can be seen in the University Food Services run by William lliekey. Aside from the inexcusably low rating it received for its health stan­dards, students are not given a flexible meal plan. I only eat two meals a day, yet I am charged for three. I have heard the argument that the price av­erages out so that we are really getting a good deal, but that is not the point. The point is we are not given the choice to de­termine something as inconse­quential as a meal plan. What happens to the student who eats in the cafeteria only once a day or eats there very intermit­tently, how is it fair to him? This typifies the attitude that what the administration says goes. 
My final example is the Notre Dame Hammes Bookstore. I have not done a scientific study on price differenees between Pandora's books and Notre Dame's, but I have looked at a few to see if thoro is a differ­ence, and there certainly is. First of all, the book "Firmament of Time" by Lon~n Eisley is priced by Notre Dame at $6. 95. If you take off the bookstore's price sticker you find the publisher's price un­derneath is $5.95. Already they have marked the book up a dollar. I caiJed Pandora's Books to check the price and indeed Notre Dame charged $1.00 more than the listed price. What does this teaeh us? That when we have a monopoly we should abuse it? 

Some may argue that I knew the rules before I got here and I should have gone somewhere else. But just because the rules were here before me does not mean that they are fair. 
Too many students passively sit back and allow the adminis­tration to dictate policy that is not always fair. Where is the free thinking that is supposed to occur at a university? 
The central question is not why our sehool is as it is, the question is why doesn't any student care'! I hope I olTend someone, but I feel that no orw cares about what happens on campus and that those that do don't really do much to change it. 
The University should en­courage sineere dialogue be­tween students and the admin­istration: a dialogue that can produce actual change. 
There are a number of great things about our sehool. A preparation for life includes questioning authority, because if authority is not questioned, what is to stop it from abusing its power? 
If we really earn about Notre Dame, we will try to change some of its faults; those who do not care sit back and do noth­ing. It is not our fault that the situation is as it is, but it is our fault if we do not try to change it. All it takPs is a willingness nn the stucl!~nts' part to make themselves !ward by an often­times deaf administration.

etcntion is a very real threat in South Africa, and it is but one more clement which makes liff' a constant struggle for black individuals. Under Section 29 of the Internal Sneurity Act, the Security Police have full lngal authorization to d1~tain any person at any time for any reason. In nssencc, Sec­tion 29 is a chief vehicle used against political opponents of the regime, and the legal provi­sion is a blatant bastardization of the Huln of the l.aw. 
Two 
South Africas 
By Mike Schadek 
Detnntion under Section 29 permits thn South African gov­ernment to silence protestors and critics of apartheid in a quick and efficient manner, all in the guise of "legal" proceed­ings. Thn reality of Section 29 is that it is a cruel and barbaric procedure which attempts to in­flict the greatest punishment to 1~nemies of the regime. The Sncurity Police is given unlimit­ed discretion during interroga­tion proc1wdings, and, simply stated, they are ruthless. 
Enormous pressure is placed on the detainees, including psy­chological and physical torture, intimidation, coercion and as­saults. Dehumanizing and de­grading treatment is the norm, such as lengthy interrogation and months of solitary con­finement. Furthermore, under Snction 29, access to family, frionds or oven a lawyer can bn and often is nullilied. It is a grand scheme to break the mental and physical faculties of the dntainen and ultimately to produce information which can be used against him at his trial. It is not surprising that a very high number of detainees under Snction 29 eventually sign "con­fessions" which arc then admit­tod in court. 
The tragic aspect of Section 29 is the fact that it is in effect ovcry day. Detention is a con­stant throat to those South Afri­cans who wish to become in­volved in the struggle against apartheid. An individual simply cannot bocomc too outspoken or too politically active due to the throat of governmental re­tribution and Section 29. This is one fundamental barrier to po­litical organization and mo­bilization of the black South Af­ricans. Also, inherent in the system is a basic mistrust of those you do not know ex­tremely well. Government in­formers infiltrate an enormous array of social and religious or­ganizations and they are eager to expose any suspected "ene­mies of the state" to the Securi­ty Police because they are re-

warded handsomely. The fear of informers reaches every level of society, and I witnessed the effects during one of my visits to a colored township. After sit­ting in during a youth group meeting of teenagers, I noticed the participants weren't enthu­siastic about answering some of my questions, specifically those relating to the government and the South African Defense Force. Afterward, the group leader explained to me that probably at least two or three of the children were informers, so the other children had to be very careful not to say anything which may later incriminate themselves. 
During my visit, I became in­timately aware of the evil of de­tention at a personal level. Mr. Ngconde Balfour, a staff mem­ber of the Provincial Church at which Archbishop Tutu pre­sides, was coming into work at St. George's Cathedral in Febru­ary of this year. As he ap­proached his office, four men with guns jumped out of a van and proceeded to force him into the vehicle against his will. Luckily a fellow staff member had witnessed the event or Mr. Balfour would have simply dis­appeared as do so many black South Africans. In any event, Mr. Balfour has remained in de­tention under Section 29 since that day and he has not yet been charged with any crime. He has no access to a lawyer, and he is not permitted to see or call his family. The Security Police can hold him indefinitely, and the Commissioner of Police has ignored countless pleas by Tutu and others to either charge or release Mr. Balfour. Such is life under Section 29.

Walker's future with Dallas shaky 
Associated Press 
IRVING, Texas-The Dallas Cowboys had an open "fire sale" on running back Herschel Walker while NFL owners met several miles away 
Tuesday trying to pick  a  new  
commissioner.  
Agents  Peter  Johnson  and  

Ralph Cindrich were consider­ing a restructuring of Walker's $1 million per year contract as part of the price for him leaving the Cowboys. 
Coach Jimmy Johnson met with Cindrich for two hours at the hotel where the owners were meeting Tuesday after­noon, but avoided reporters by taking a fire escape out. He barked a terse "No comment" when asked if there was any­thing new about the possible Walker trade. 
"The ball's in Herschel's court now," a Cowboys' source said. "It's up to him to make a deal."

seemed an eternity, until Margaret Jarc electrified the Irish fans with an unassisted goal at 35:54 of the first half, giving coach Dennis Grace's team a 7-0 bulge. 
This lead did not last for long, however, as Margaret Jarc drilled a monstrous shot past the Tri-State keeper unassisted, giving the Irish women a halftime advantage of 8-0. Jarc's third goal gave her the first hat trick of her Notre Dame career, and also tied her in the record books with Susie Zilvitis and K.T. Sullivan for Most Goals in a game.

Comfortably leading 11-0, Notre Dame continued its intense play. 
Said coach Grace, "We have a tough schedule, and it's not often that we can dominate, su I think we were lucky to tak'l advantage of the opportunities we had. We've been playing well recently, and we're really pushing for the record (winning streak)."

The Women's interhall foot­ball season is reaching the crucial part of the season and the playoff picture is taking form. Highlighting this week's play were the women of Farley who knocked off 1988 champi­ons from Lewis. 
"We wanted to revenge last years semifinal loss," said Farley defensive captain Connie Boyden, after her team shutout defending champion Lewis 14­0. 
Farley used a ferocious de­fense and a well timed passing game to win the most pivotal game of the season so far. 
Freshman Kathryn Anne Baumel's second half touch­down sealed the win for the 
Finest,  who  remained  unde­ 
feated.  
Superstar  running  back  

Kristy Alkidas scored the only touchdown in Breen Phillips 8-0 
win over Badin. Captain Mary Beth Roveda attributed the win to, "balance on both offense and defense." The Blitz also remained undefeated but will have to wait until the playoffs for a showdown with Farley. 
Lyons moved its record to 4­2 with a 14-0 victory over Siegfried. Michelle Richards and Debbie Mitchell both scored touchdowns for Lyons, and Natasha Gaul had two in­terceptions. 
The game marked the return of Lyons quarterback Liz Holtz from injury. 
"We're looking forward to rematches with Breen Phillips and Farley in the playoffs," said Lyons captain Liz Nolan. 
In other action, Tomi Otey returned a punt 60 yards to set up a score and had an intercep­tion to lead Walsh to an 18-8 victory over Knott. Liz Toohey, Colleen Stepan and Jeannie Trezvant all scored touchdowns for Walsh in the win. 

that much greater." 
Mihalko earned a monogram for his backup role at fullback in 1988 and then went on to earn the Hering Award as the most improved Irish offensive back during '89 spring drills. 
This year Mihalko will take on a much greater role for the Irish. He has carried 5 times for 20 yards, including 3 rushes for 10 yards against Stanford. He also had a six yard reception against the Cardinal. Mihalko sees this year as another step up the ladder. 
More than just carrying the ball, Mihalko is known as a good blocker. 
"I take pride in my blocking," said Mihalko. "I have a size ad­vantage so if that's what the team needs, that's what I'll do. 
Running Back coach Jim Strong agrees that Mihalko is a fine blocker. 
"Ryan takes a lot of pride in what he's doing," says Strong. "He finds his landmarks and makes good sight adjustments. He's fundamentally sound, but the key to blocking is attitude." 
Ryan Mihalko certainly has the right attitude. Coach Strong not only sees Ryan Mihalko as a good football player, but a good person. 
"As a player, he's relentless," said Strong. " He's physical and absolutely intense all day in practice on every play. When we get freshman in and we want them to develop the correct work habits, we tell them to go watch Ryan Mihalko." 
That, ladies and gentleman, is what has made Ryan Mihalko a factor for Notre Dame and will continue to him a great player.

Associated Press 
CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -Freshman Gino Torretta's 2­0 record as a fill-in quarterback for the Miami Hurricanes might earn him occasional playing time after injured starter Craig Erickson returns, Coach Dennis Erickson said Tuesday. 
"When Craig is healthy and he's 100 percent, then he's going to be the quarterback," the coach said. "But if things aren't going well, I'm not afraid to put Gino in for a couple of series." 
Craig Erickson, a junior and first-year starter, broke a knuckle on his throwing hand in the first half of Miami's game Sept. 30 at Michigan State. Torretta came in and directed the Hurricanes to 23 points in their 26-20 victory. 
Last Saturday, Torretta completed 13 of 16 passes for 239 yards and three touchdowns as the second­ranked Hurricanes blitzed Cincinnati 56-0. 
"Gino's not better than Craig right now," Coach Erickson said. "That's nothing against Gino. lie has played outstanding. lle'll play outstanding this week." 
The Hurricanes play San Jose State on Saturday. A bye precedes the Miami-Florida State showdown Oct. 28. The coach is hoping that Craig Erickson will be healthy and able to face the Seminoles. 
"In my mind that's what we're shooting for. But we really won't know for a couple of weeks." 
The quarterback had surgery to repair the knuckle fracture one day after the injury and had the hand placed in a brace. Therapy has begun to decrease the swelling. 
Miami's offense struggled at times in the 3 1/2 games in which the strong-armed Erickson has played. !lis statistics include 75 completions in 146 attempts for 1,001 yards, with eight touchdowns and six interceptions. Erickson's rating is 118.8; Torretta's is 144.6. 
"Craig's the No. 1 quarterback," the coach said. "He earned it over a long period of time, and he has played well. He has improved through the season." 
Torretta, a 19-year-old redshirt freshman, did not seem inclined Tuesday to stir up controversy at Quarterback u. 
"If I was the starter and went down with an injury, I would hope the coach would have enough confidence to put me back in," Torretta said. "I can understand that." 
Torretta isn't the Hurricanes' only talented freshman quarterback. Bryan Fortay, one of the nation's most heavily recruited prep quarterbacks last winter, made his collegiate debut in the second half of the Cincinnati game. 
"I didn't impress myself too much," Fortay said Tuesday after reviewing films. "I looked like a freshman. I was tenative and nervous." 
Coach  Erickson  scrapped  
plans  to  reshirt  Fortay,  18,  
because  of  the  injury  to  

quarterback Erickson. 
"My thoughts were that we really had to have a second quarterback that could compete, that had some experience, so that if Gino got hurt we would (still have) an opportunity to compete for the national championship," the coach said. 
He said Fortay might be redshirted next season.

On a cold and windy October evening, the Notre Dame women's soccer team sped past the Tri-State Women of Troy 17-0, recording their second straight shutout and their sixth win in a row. 
Senior co-captain Joy Sisolak opened the scoring at 5:4 7 of the first half, beating Tri-State goalkeeper Linda llalgash on a cross from right wing Susie Zilvitis. The swarming Notre Dame attack quickly forced another score, as senior co­captain K.T. Sullivan found the net at 6:04 of the first half. with an assist by junior forward Mimi Suba. 
For the next six minutes, Tri­State held the Irish at bay, but Susie Zilvitis, streaking down the sideline, nailed a goal at

Thank God for the Cubs! Baseball is better off with them 
I sat there and watched grown men pour cham­pagne over each other's heads and tried to make some sense of it all, to figure out what it meant in the larger context of life. 
The San Francisco Giants had just eliminated the Chicago Cubs, America's perennial losers, in the Senior Circuit Playoffs. The game or series score wasn't important, just the fact that there would be no more baseball at Wrigley Field for these Boys of Zimmer. 
Why in the name of Job does God force these Cubs and their fans to suffer, living a dream they know will eventually turn to a nightmare? 
Why does He get their hopes up-at least three times since 1945-and then let the Mets put together an incredible comeback? Or let the ball roll between Leon Durham's legs? Or let a kid named "The Thrill" drive in what seemed like a run every time he went to the plate? 
After Boston Red Sox first baseman Bil Buckner (You got it-a former Cub) watched a ball roll be­tween his legs in the 1986 World Series against the New York Mets, legendary writer Stephen King said he just sat in the dark and tried to figure out why the Sox could never win the big one, why they could never be the champions of the world. 
There wasn't necessarily one play in the Cubs­Giants series that sealed the Chicago's fate. But there were many that will be remembered as ac­complices to this death. 
There was Don Zimmer, whose stomach was fi-

nally in sync with his body for the first time in this century, loading the bases in Game 1, only to see Will Clark blast a grand slam into Lake Michigan. 
There was Les Lancaster forgetting the count upon entering the Game 3 and promptly serving a juicy 2-0 pitch that Robby Thompson hit toward Oakland. 
There was Mitch Williams almost breaking his neck as he watched a Clark single shoot past his head in Game 5, the single that closed the lid on the Cubs' coffin. 
There was Ryne Sandberg, who has a hit in every post-season game he has ever played in, grounding meekly to second, his position, to put the nail in that coffin and signal hibernation for the Cubs. 
But the lingering memory may be that of Andre Dawson, the man who will make $2 million next season. Dawson stranded runner after runner after runner throughout this series, striking out with the bases loaded in the ninth inning of Game 4 and then leaving two runners on base twice in Game 5 with a strikeout and a popout. The off-season may be the longest season of Dawson's career. 
The image that sitcks in the mind is that of the Cubs sitting helplessly in the dugout after the loss, the only path to the lockerroom blocked by a Giant celebration. 
The Cubs not only left their hearts in that San Francisco dugout, but also their hope, dreams and, 
possibly, their destiny. They carried the weight of the city with them, and that weight became too heavy. 
So. the Giants and A's, two transplanted teams from the East Coast, two teams just miles apart, will play in the World Series. The remainder of the world can now go on with normal lives. 
Anyway, it just wouldn't be the same if the Cubs had won it all. They are America's losers, seeing the summit but not reaching it, seeing light at the end of the tunnel but going blind before it shines on them. 
Maybe these playoffs taught Chicago and Cub fans a lesson. Next year, go to Wrigley Field, get some sun, drink some beer, keep score if you want, throw back the opposing homers, sing with Harry. 
But never, ever get your hopes up for the impossi­ble. 
If you do, think of the Miracle Mets, Kingman, Durham, Clark and every other person or team that has contributed to the woes of the Cubs through the years. 
I'm convinced the Cubs will never win a pennant or World Series as long as life exists as we know it. 
But if Dawson bounces back. And a dependable fourth starter emerges. And Sandberg has a year like '84. And Walton proves this season was fluke. And...
