benefit concert to honor Weiss 
By JAMIE HEISLER Associate News Editor 
In 1989, a young man with bone cancer was asked his one wish in life by the Make-A-Wish Foundation. His answer-the chance to march with the Notre Dame Marching Band. 
His wish was granted, and Kurt Wei~s played his saxophone and marched with the band in the 1990 Orange Bowl. Six years later, Weiss once again performed with the Notre Dame Band in the 1996 Orange Bowl, as band president. 
Tonight, the Notre Dame Marching Band is sponsoring a benefit concert in his honor with benefits going to the Make-A-Wish Foundation. "These musicians have come together with the same spirit and enthusiasm that Kurt has shown us as a member of the Notre Dame Community," said Hache! Stnhle, Viee President of the Notre Dame Bands. 
Weiss' struggle with cancer began in 1989 when he was diagnosed with ostnogenic sarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer. Starting in his leg, it soon spread to his lungs and forced routine chemotherapy treatments and frequent surgeries.

Improving 

the National Pastitne 
April is upon us, and  
spring has sprung.  Most  Todd Fitzpatrick  
importantly, another  Sports Wrirer  
baseball season has  
begun.  

(Sounds kind of poetic, doesn't it?) 
Yes, I know there have been more inside columns about baseball than there have been sunny days in South Bend. But this one is dif­ferent. 
Many baseball fans are focusing on the sea­son that has just begun. 
My attention, however, is squarely focused on next season. That's when the fun really will begin. 
Major league baseball owners have voted to start interleague play in 1997. 
Of course, critics will clutch their chests and gasp at such an upheaval of tradition. But they need to lighten up. 
Let's face it. Baseball fans need an exciting reason to pile into their cars and head down to the ballpark for a game. 
Most cities rarely sell out their baseball sta­diums for regular season contests. Cincinnati didn't even sell out its stadium for home play­off games last season. 
If r want to see Frank Thomas face Cardinals' pitchers in Busch Stadium on a Saturday afternoon, is that so wrong? I hope not. 
If owners had listened to "back in the good ol' days" critics who opposed change within the major leagues, expansion never would have been possivle either. 
The Colorado Rockies drew 3.9 million fans in 1995, the major league's highest total. Without the recent expansion that added the Rockies and Florida Marlins, millions of fans would have had no home team to support. 
Staunch critics have sarcastically suggested that our national pastime might as well allow batters four strikes instead of three. The induction of interleague play can hardly be compared to rule changes that would damage the game of baseball. These are the same rules followed by little league teams in every corner of America. 
The owners simply wish to add excitement to major league baseball. I don't blame them one bit. 
One of the most exciting baseball games I ever witnessed was the climactic Game 5 of the 1995 Divisional Playoff Series between the Seattle Mariners and New York Yankees. 
The concept of the new divisional playoff series gave Seattle Mariners' fans the oppor­tunity to see Ken Griffey, Jr. sprint from first base to home plate on Edgar Martinez's dou­ble in the bottom of the ninth inning. As he slid safely into home plate beyond the out­stretched catcher's mitt, more than 50,000 elated fans participated in the series-clinching celebration. 
If this isn't classic baseball, then I don't know what is. 
Change is good. After all, he invention of a divisional playoff series hasn't ruined base­ball. It has simply added another very excit­ing dimension. lnterleague play will do the same. 
For all the fans who live in National League cities, wouldn't you love to see Ken Griffey, Jr. sprint around your base paths?

Bishop, foreigners flee from 'bloody nightmare' in Liberia 
MONROVIA, Liberia ~---.------~ Through a week of slaughter and chaos, Atlantic Liberia's Roman Catholic bishop had kept 
Ocean his optimism, praying Monrovia would stabi­lize and refusing to abandon his people. But after the main Catholic church was looted and he himself was robbed, even Archbishop Michael Francis gave up and fled the ruined city on Sunday with his mother. "In the next two weeks, there could be a mass starvation," he said, before reluctantly boarding one of the U.S. helicopters that have now ferried 1,642 foreigners out of the embattled seaside capital. Thousands of hungry, homeless people wandered the streets of Monrovia on Sunday, searching for food and shelter while 300 miles shelling and small-arms fire threatened a c::::s

British pollsters pick Anne for throne 
LONDON 

More Britons would like to see Princess Anne as their monarch than her older brother Prince Charles, according to a poll published Sunday. Princess Anne -ejghth in line to the throne and once the least popular of Queen Elizabeth Il's four children -led the poll, with 33 percent of respondents choosing her from a list of heirs and 


other public figures. Heir-apparent Charles came second, backed by 26 percent of respondents in the Mori poll, commissioned by Independent Television. Only 47 per­cent thought Charles would make a good king, compared to 82 percent in a 1991 poll. His reputation has suffered following his 1992 separation from Princess Diana, and subsequent confession of adultery. 
Library worker vandalizes rare books 
BOSTON 

Temporary workers at Harvard's Widener Library aren't supposed to have unlimited access to its famed stacks. But Stephen L. Womack did, turning his $5-an­hour job into a gateway to the Widener's most valuable holdings and becoming "the library slasher." Womack stole and destroyed more than 600 scholarly books before he was caught, and left notes threatening anyone who tried to stop him. Womack, 42, testified in court that he was seeking revenge against authorities who had sen­tenced him to a state mental hospital, after unrelated con­victions for malicious destruction and exposing himself. Library security specialists say his case shows how little administrators do to protect their collections. The volun­teer was promoted to a full-time position in charge of a collection and looted books worth more than $1 million. 

Deadly crashes increase with speeds 
SACRAMENTO, Calif. 
Deadly traffic accidents increased by more than 17 per­cent on California's most traveled roads during the state's first 11 weeks of higher speed limits, an Associated Press review found. ''It's obviously a concern to us. We don't like to see the numbers go up at all," said California Highway Patrol spokesman Steve Kohler. "We're keeping an eye on it." Fatal car accidents had been declining in California since 1987. Opponents of the speed increase, initiated after the federal government dropped the 55 mph national speed limit, said they had expected more highway deaths. Crashes overall during the last period for which statistics are available -Dec. 17, 1995 to Feb. 29, 1996-were up 8.6 percent compared to the same peri­od 12 months earlier, California Highway Patrol records show. The figures do not include highways under the jurisdiction of county sheriffs departments or local police. 
Telescope uncovers tadpole-like pods 
WASHINGTON 
Floating in space, 450 light years away, are tadpole­shaped pods with comet-like heads twice the diameter of our solar system and tails 100 billion miles long. And they may just be the first of trillions of such objects in the universe. Astounding news? A sci-fi movie? Hardly. This is high-tech, state-of-the-art science. The Hubble Space Telescope has returned pictures of these wraithlike for­mations and it's on a search for more. Astronomers call the images "cometary knots" because their glowing heads and filmy tails superficially resemble comets. They resemble giant tadpoles, too. And sperm. Hubble astronomer C. Robert O'Dell and graduate student Kerry 
P. Handron of Rice University in Houston found the knots while exploring the Helix nebula, a ring of glowing gases in the constellation Aquarius.

Jewish youths march Pope criticizes religious violence 
to remember Holocaust 
By MONJKA SCISLOWSKA 
Associatod Pross 
WAHSAW 
About 6,000 .Jewish young people from around the world will march from the red-brick barracks of the Auschwitz death camp Tuesday to gas chambers whcn1 the Nazis murdered 1.5 million people, mainly Jews. 
The purpose of the "Mard1 of the Living," which retraces the last steps of many llolocaust victims, is to preserve the mem­ory of 6 million Jews who died in llitler's death camps. 
But sornn Polns say the march, which has taken place every two years since 19RR, places too lit­tle emphasis on renewed Jewish life in Poland and on reconcilia­tion lwtween Jews and Poles. 
Tlw demonstrators-stu­dents from Israel, the United States and :16 other countries ­are also visiting the Warsaw c;hetto Memorial and former death 1~amps at Treblinka and Majdarwk. After visiting Poland, they fly to Israel to partieipate in that country's Independence Day on April 24. 
Stanislaw Krajewski. a Jewish eo-chairman of the Polish Council of Christians and Jews, eompluins that the march orga­nizers did not arrange nw11tings hetwem1 Polish teenagers and tlw visiting Jewish studnnts. As u result, lw said, tour organizers arn showing that Poland is only u place of tragmly. 
"Normal lifn spoils the pie­turn," Krajnwski said. Shahtai Tal, spokesman for The lleritage of Jewish 
Heroism, the U.S.-Israeli organi­zation that organized the march, defends the plans. The main idea, he said, is to walk along the "route of the dead in a march of the living." 
About 25,000 Jews live in Poland, down from the prewar community of 3.5 million. Thousands of Holocaust sur­vivors went to Israel when it was founded in 1948, and more left during the communist anti­Semitic purges in the 1950s and 1960s. 
Jewish groups say Jewish life is re-establishing itself in Poland. Many Polish young peo­ple with Jewish roots are returning to the faith of their forebears. 
But misunderstandings per­sist, and the Jewish students will confront one example dur­ing their Auschwitz visit. 
Construction of a mini-mall has begun across the street from the former death camp. Work was suspended on April 2 because of protests from Jewish organizations, camp survivors and Polish government officials, who said commercialism had no place there. 
On April 6, a group of skin­heads marched at Auschwitz to object to what they said was Jewish pressure on Polish authorities to halt the mini-mall project. 
Of the 1.5 million people who were killed from 1940-45 at the Auschwitz-Birkenau complex near the southern city of Oswiecim, 90 percent were Jews.

war, Pope John Paul II on Sunday denounced those who "kill in the name of God" and appealed for closer 


M u s I i m -Pope John Christian ties. Paul II 
The pope urged North Africa's tiny Christian minority to serve as "messengers of peace" during difficult times for the church, particularly in neighboring Algeria, where more than 40,000 people have died in four years of fighting between government soldiers and Muslim rebels who want to install strict Islamic rule. 
"You often experience the vulnerability of a small flock and sometimes undergo trials which can reach heroic propor­tions," John Paul said in an ad­dress to bishops from Algeria, Libya, Tunisia and Morocco while on a one-day visit. 
"No one can kill in the name of God," he said. "No one can accept bringing death upon his brother." 
Eleven members of Roman Catholic religious orders have been killed by Algerian extrem­ists. 
Earlier, in a blessing after Mass at Tunis's neo-Ro­manesque cathedral, John Paul implored Muslim fundamental­ists suspected of kidnapping seven Trappist monks in Alge­ria to release them.

Israeli aircraft bombarded guerrilla strongholds in Beirut and southern Lebanon on Sun­day, doubling the tide of refugees to 400,000 and pro­voking guerrilla vows to turn northern Israel into a "fiery hell." 
Undaunted by Israel's four­day-old aerial barrage, Hezbollah guerrillas hit north­ern Israel with rockets that came crashing down every 20 minutes for seven hours. One person was wounded and an empty school and other prop­erty were damaged.

Mass exodus creates ghost town.s

TYRE 
·silence shrouded the ancient port city of Tyre Sunday after most of its 130,000 residents fled north to escape threatened Israeli attacks. lt was the largest exodus of civilians since Israel began its offensive four days ago. 
The usually bustling city, just 1~ miles north of Lebanon's border with Israel, was quiet and nearly empty hours before a mid-afternoon deadline set by Israel. An occasional vehicle carrying fleeing refugees raced through city str~;~ets. 
Almost the entire population of Tyre and 41 neighboring villages -+-c about 190,000 peo­ple in all--, fled by car, truck or on foot after the Israeli army. warned it would born­hard the area to prevent

attacks by Shiite Muslim guer­rillas. 
Ghonwa Dhahini, a 12-year­old girl, fled her village with about 15 family members after what she called a ''terri­fying night of shelling.'' 
"I didn't get a single moment of sleep," she said. 

The number of people dis­placed by Israel's attacks has reached about 400,000 from 86 towns and villages. That's 10 percent of Lebanon's population and more than half of the country's southern resi­dents. 
Israel says it is trying to knock out the bases of Hezbollah guerrillas, who use civilians for cover. But Lebanon claims Israel is delib­erately targeting civilians in order to provoke a refugee crisis, 
About 200 people, including Ghonwa and her family, sought refuge at a U.N. peace­keepers' base in Tyre. They were given tents, mattresses, gas heaters and blankets. In all, about 5,000 refugees have sought refuge from peace­keepers based in a U.N.­policed zone in southern Lebanon. 
Villagers left behind homes, cattle and other possessions in the stampede to the rela­tively safer north. 
"I care only about myself and my family," said Mustafa Kassem Baalbaki, a 51-year­old lottery ticket vendor who fled his Tyre apartment with a daughter and son and went to the U.N. base. 
Bumper-to-bumper traffic jammed the main coastal highway toward Sidon, the provincial capital of southern Lebanon about 25 miles far­ther north. 
U.N. peacekeepers drove in a convoy of white vehicles to the village of Mansouri south­east of Tyre Sunday to evacu­ate trapped villagers.

• WINTER OF MY DISCONTENT 
Catholic Church, U.S. military share perspective 
Pacifists cannot oppose ROTC: Ethical citizen-soldiers further Christian doctrine of peace 
R
egular readers of the Viewpoint page will rncall that one of last semester's most persistent and divisive topics was debate over llw compatibility between Notre Damn's mission as a Catholic institution and the pres·ence of a large Hnserve Ol'lker Training Corps (ROTC) program hern. This controversy engen­derml a ltwel of passion rarely seen on 
Christopher Kratovil 
this politically apathetic campus, even as the tone of the letters on both sides grew increasingly nasty. The HOTC cadets found themselves accused of IWNything from being "baby killers" to "rnindlt~ss murder machines," while the patriotism and common sense of their psnudo-pal:ilist critics were challenged. Yes, the rhetoric on this issue spiraled a little bit out of control until suddenly linals and Christmas break descended upon this campus and the great HOTC d1~batn simply vanishnd. As for myself. my sabbatical in England knpt me out of llw lirw of lire on this whole HOTC business so I guess I'm a bit overdue in putting rny two-cents in one this topic. 
To tlwir cn~dit. the officers and cadets of Notrn Damn's HOH: program were. I lwlieve, gnnui1wly trouhlt~d by the sort of criticisms lnvnled at their program in 
T
these pages last semester. In addition to a lot of individual introspection, its con­cern recently manifested itself in the form of a "Joint Services Military Ethics Seminar" which I had the pleasure of attending at the invitation of some cadet friends. I was quite impressed with the insights and self-analysis that the ROTC members shared with each other at this event and feel that their perspective deserves to be shared, devoid of the sort of angry rhetoric which both sides of this debate resorted to last semester. he central question before us is how it is possible to simultaneously be a practicing Christian and the sort of trained killer the military service pro­duces. Obviously, there are volumes of philosophy and theology dedicated to the theories of just war that attempt to shed light on this issue, but to resort to a philosophical argument at this stage would only serve to abstract the issue; philosophy-in-rhetoric rarely produces anything other than an equally preten­tious counter-argument and a perpetua­tion of the debate. 
I believe that the several hundred of our fellow students who are being trained as professional fighting men and women on this campus do not justify their career path so much with Saint Augustine as with the realization that there is a fundamental need for educat­ed and ethical officers to lead our nation's military forces. The logic of this pragmatic argument goes something like this: our country is going to maintain a large defense structure for the foresee­able future, the purpose of this all vol­unteer force is defensive in nature but it does have at its disposal tremendous 
I
destructive power, ergo it is necessary to have a well-educated and ethically conscious group of officers to responsi­bly lead this force. t is important to note that ours is an all-volunteer military force and that it remains the instrument of decisions made by freely elected civilian leaders and not a policy making body in its own right. Give both of these factors, the need for a disciplined and professional officer corps becomes all the more clear; they must simultaneously serve the needs of the enlisted volunteers that they command and provide our elected officials with the information and policy options they need to effectively lead this country. Thus we see that in a very real sense a military career represents a valid form of service to others. From the dedication of a junior officer to the welfare and lives of men under him, to the national guardsmen aiding disaster victims, to the four star general who talks the president out of an irresponsi­ble politically motivated application of force, military service can be a mode of helping people just like any other_ A
Enlightened officers who are well-edu­cated and have an ethical perspective are invaluable. They serve as both a moral guide to those under them and they can provide a check on potentially unethical actions that they might be ordered to perform; I understand that an officer is always allowed to immedi­ately resign their commission in the face of a profound moral dilemma. s to the relationship between the Catholic Church and the American military, J see no fundamental incompat­ibility between these two institutions. There are, in fact, two significant paral­lels between them: their hierarchical structures are analogous and, at their best, both of these institutions seek to promote the cause of peace (though. over the course of history both have oftP-n fallen short of this). It is ridiculous to accuse the military of being "warmon­gers" or "death lovers" since the simple

reality of war insures that those who 
know it best are those who most want to 
avoid it. The Church does its all to bring 
about peace through the forces of moral 
persuasion and teaching, while the mili­
tary works towards this same goal by 
deterring aggression through strength 
and preparedness. 
I know that there are arguments for 
Christian Pacifism and I respect those , who live by that difficult code, but as no consensus exists in the Church on the necessity of pacifism and insofar as Pacifism can inadvertently create more 
aggression than it alleviates, it seems 
like a choice best left to individuals and 
not used to sharpen institutional policy. 
Put in simpler terms, someone has to be 
on the frontline guarding and insuring 
the right of Christian pacifists to sit 
around a university and proclaim their 
doctrine. 
T
he post-cold war environment has 
made the positive good that the mili­

tary seeks to bring about all the more 
visible. From the peacemaking missions 
in Bosnia and Somalia to the rescue of 
American and other civilians from the 
chaos to the never ending efforts to 
deter global aggression, our armed 
forces work to protect and save lives. 
Given the peace preserving goals of 
the American military, its status as an 
all volunteer force and the civilian con­
trol under which it operates, I have 
trouble understanding the loathing with 
which some on this campus regard it. 
Perhaps those who so vehemently objeet 
to its presence on this Catholic campus 
are making the elassic mistake of allow­
ing their theology to be shaped by their 
politics. Notre Dame HOTC seeks to 
produce ethical and educated citizen­
soldiers and, if or one, am glad to have 
individuals produced by an institution 
such as Notre Dame charged with lead­
ing our military.

• AT THE MOVIES WITH FATMJUd AND OJUHlY 



Surprise! Action CAN happen in the Midwest 
"Fargo" 
***~ 
(out of four) 

Directed by Joel Coen Starring William Macy, Steve Buscemi, and Kristin Rudrud 
5'ynopsis: A midwestern car salesman hatches a plot to obtain the money he needs for a big investment deal. He hires two men to kidnap his wife so that he can ransom her wealthy and crotchety father for the required sum. But things fall apart. and what seems a foolproof way to wealth and riches leads only to a nasty disaster. 
Daddy: 
"Fargo," in Daddy's personal opinion, is one of those rare movies whose cine­matically created impression mirrors the atmosphere of the American city after which it was named. Unfortunately, this assertion suggests that "Fargo" the movie, like Fargo the city, is a mildly am using and sweet motion picture; likewise, it is one that is subtly numbing in its utter banality. 

"Fargo" introduces us to a small group of characters, individuals who exist in an American tundra that is nearly as sterile and as chilling as the narrative itself. They are, for the most part, archetypal midwestern folk; any denizen of the middle class can identify with them. 
However, despite this unavoidable connection that most of "Fargo's" audi­ence will experience, mere association, in this particular case, does not neces­sarily imply the existence of the empa­thy that so often accompanies it. 
Due to these personally perceived cir­cumstances, Daddy found himself a pas­sive observer at a recent showing of "Fargo."Embroiled in a situation that is becoming increasingly infrequent for this salty critic, Daddy wallowed in com­plete apathy while he watchect a movie that failed to stimulate neither his plea­sure nor his pain circuit. 
He did not particularly enjoy "Fargo," nor did he take an active dislike to it. He merely witnessed it in much the same manner that he and other insomniacs watch television at 
three in the morning. 
through slow motion They sit slack in their facial shots, has chairs, waiting to be become the emblem 
stimulated ... or just sufficiently subdued to the point that sleep itself becomes a viable option. 
In the end, "Fargo" much like late­night viewing options themselves, pro­vides neither of these two exits from this form of stasis; much like the insomniac himself, it simply exists without really doing anything of interest. 
The inherent humor (and, for some viewers, perhaps the inherent beauty as well) of "Fargo" comes from the survey of midwestern life conducted concur­rently with the movie's examination of a relatively interesting murder that takes place in, and supposedly stands in stark contrast to, an overwhelmingly drab background. 
Daddy's disinterest in "Fargo" might be due to the fact that he did not find the accents, lives, or eating habits of its characters funnier than the prepon­derance of guns and pickup trucks in Texas. 
-On the contrary, he considered it to be just another sad indication of the way people unconsciously conform their lifestyles to the social mean of the region in which they live. If this was the goal of Mr. Coen, as it might well have been, then Daddy will be the first to con­gratulate him on fulfilling his aspira­tions. However, he will not thank him for requiring the payment of six dollars to prove a point that is, at its very best, already vividly obvious to most thinking individuals. 
Fatman: 

As was demonstrated at the Academy Awards, subtlety and character have been lost in recent American cinema. 
Mel Gibson, crawling 
of what is popular in the mainstream film culture today. I find this very sad, and this reason is why it was such a relief to see the Coen broth­ers' latest film, "Fargo." 
The witty creators of "Raising Arizona" (one of the Fatman's all-time favorites), "Miller's Crossing," "Barton Fink" and "The Hudsucker Proxy" have again challenged their audience with a clever, well-developed film. 
The murder plot does not revolve around overdone technical violence to ooze the audience into the action. Instead, "Fargo" works to make every character real and believable so that the audience relates to the people rather than to the violence in and of itself. Few films in recent years have provided such a remarkable set of characters; they are interesting in their ordinariness. From the pregnant, ever-hungry policewoman to the fumbling main character, they are all believable and subtly remarkable. 
Daddy's criticisms of the film are legit­imate. If one is not in tune with the characters and filmmakers, then the movie can slide into an insipid mix of thick midwestern accents and bumbling characters. But, for the most part, I think that "Fargo" is highly accessible. If one looks to know the characters rather than focusing on following the plot to some expected and cliched climax, then one will be utterly astounded at the depth of the movie. If not, it might seem just a little tedious. 
The film also depicts the Midwest in a way that few other films have. The set­tings, houses, cars, bars, and restau­rants that populate "Fargo" all have a certain element of authenticity that usu­ally gets lost in movies made about our part of the country. 
My case example is "Bird on a Wire" (another Gibson favorite), where Racine, Wisconsin looks like a Nashville suburb instead of a true midwestern town clut­tered with dirty snow and American cars. A large part of what makes Fargo a great move is its impeccable repre­sentation of Minnesota and its people. 
I really recommend seeing this film. It offers such a contrast to the overblown 

bombast of "Braveheart." Listen to the soundtrack in "Fargo," and then com­pare it with that of Mel's kilt-laden pic­ture. Understatement can say so much more ... especially when it is done well. All in all, the subtlety and depth of char­acter in Fargo makes it a superior film where the audience cares about the characters in a genuine, rather than contrived and jingoistic, manner. 
Patman and Daddy are John Zach and Scott Bozik.

Stone Cold-Blooded 
"Diabolique" Directed by Jeremiah Chechik Starring Sharon Stone, Isabel Adjani, and Chazz Palminteri 
*** 
(out of four) 

By MARK TORMA 
Accent Movie Critic 
I
f you have not seen a mystery movie in a while, you are probably not alone. There just are not many made these days. Hollywood now bows down to the god Pyrotechnic to provide the thrills, and suspense­my God, you have to hire a writer for that!-is thrown ·to the wayside, in favor of automatic weaponry and massive destruction. 
I will give Hollywood one thing: this FX fixation does 
provide great thrills, but it gets boring! Where are the 
spine-tingling chills, the bouts of confusion, the titillat­
ing moments of revelation that an audience deserves? 
They are not in scripts sent to Schwarzenegger's 
house, that is for sure. 
The kind of applause that "The Usual Suspects" 
received for reviving the genre should not come so lib­
erally to the recent remake of "Diabolique;" yet, this 
film does deserve a certain amount of respect. 
Not to be monopolized by such giants of the intrigue 
set as "Murder. She Wrote" and "Matlock," Isabel 
Adjani, Sharon Stone and Co. have redone the Simone 
Signoret classic with an eye toward much box-office 
success. To their credit, however, the producers have 
gone past a simple reliance on Stone's on-screen pen­
chant for violent behavior (which does still bring in th(:) 
big bucks) and have established an appealing, if dis­
turbing, atmosphere. 
The opening scenes, set in a boarding school run by Guy and Mia Baran (Chazz Palmintieri and Adjani), made me think Tim Burton had gotten his hands on "Dead Poets Society." If Sharon Stone had wrested Robin Williams' role from him and made it her malevo­lent own, the match could not have been more perfect. 
This is not to say that the pedagogical (for my engi­neer-to-be roommate, that means "teaching") action is the focus of the story; from the very beginning, Guy seems more bent on sending his young wife to the great beyond than on giving a hoot about his students. 
His cruelty, nay, tyranny (to say the VERY least) has brought the normally meek and pious Mia, a former nun, to conspire with vengeful Nicole Horner (Stone) to "orr· the monstrous Guy. After some tense moments between Mia and Guy, who seems a little difficult to kill, they succeed with the murder, and dump the body in the school pool-a rather foolhardy end to a fool­proof plan, but then, Nicole and Mia seem to have a lot on their minds. · 
They get a lot more to think about very soon-some­one out there knows about the murder. Mia is driven to extremely erratic behavior by all this uncertainty, and a detective played by Kathy Bates involves herself just in time to observe the duo's awfully suspicious antics. 
That is hardly the best part of the movie anyway­the most gripping is not the murder plot itself, but the psychological, psycho-sexual overtones and intrigues that pop up in nearly every frame. 
From the beginning, Mia knows about Guy's affairs, most specifically with Ms. Horner-heck, the whole SCHOOL knows about that. Everybody also seems to know of Guy's sinister yet libidinous hatred of Mia­but what does anybody do? So many people know, yet, throughout the movie, so many people DO NOT know­or do they just not care? 
Stone's Nicole, for her part, seems very caring and protective of Mia, often acting a mother to the quiver­ing wife-but, inevitably, suggestions of a lesbian rela­tionship are made. A pretty hostile guy must have been penning this screenplay-the female empowerment movement is caricatured, and not too kindly, in Ms. Horner, who is repulsed by anything overtly male, even (or especially) while phallic imagery flies through her scenes. 
Sharon Stone is a vision of passion more than loveli­ness, and the leopard skin she wears even as under­garments are a fair indication of her general tempera­ment. Kathy Bates' detective's mastectomy makes Stone's character virtually spit in disgust; her woman­liness is a badge of authority, a source of fierce and lethal pride. You do not screw with this woman ... you just do not. 
The many conflicting images of women that appear­Liz Taylor in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?," a miniature Pieta-help to accentuate the sexual ambi­guity, and contribute to a visual experience that is both tantalizing and tasteful. 
It could not have fit in better with the intrigue and mood of the film, which, apart from a schlocky part at the end (slightly reminiscent of movies like "Evil Dead 2"), was an enjoyable jaunt into the lives of the haunt­ed and depraved (yes, I meant enjoyable). It was slow at times, and it does not teach morality or reduce one to tears, but when was the last time Stallone made you think at all? "Diabolique" i;; titillation the old-fashioned way-and it still works. 
And no, Sharon Stone does not get naked. And it still works anyway. 
Mark Torma is deeply honored by the tribute in the recent and, sadly, last issue of "Scholastic."

A'""'"H A«cnt FJitor 
"Distinctly collegiate. Universally funny." 
ThP words inseribnd on thn jaeknt of Davn Ktdlntt's comic strip anthology, "A Wnii­Balancml Meal." arn, of coursn, meant to per­tain to the always bnloved-and oeeasionally notorious-strip itself. "Four Food Groups of tlw Apoealypsn," with its unabashedly diJ·eet stare into tlw eyes of Notrn Dame in ALL her glory, has evolved from a Domer's doodles into a fixed part of campus life and lorn. The Scripps lloward Foundation has n~cognized it as one of the top ten bnst collngiate cartoons of its age ... and yPt, wlwn askt>d what results he most hopes to yinld from his first book, and, indeed, 
from his work as· a whole, 
Dave Kellett's response is 
simple. 
"I just want it to he funny." 
The fact is that "distinctly 
collegiate, universally funny" 
applies as accurately to 
the artist as it does to 
..__"" '~the art. Kellett. a Notre 
Dame senior who hails 
from Carlsbad, Califomia. has 
taken tlw rare combination of a 
gift for humor and a talented 
hand well beyond the rnalms of 
tlw avnragn comic connoisseur. 
lie found his penchant for car­
tooning while in junior 
high; ovnr time, raw 
ability has luwn taken 
to greater !wights. "Drawing 

on a day to day basis has madn nH' a IH'Itnr artist-and a better crnator," Knlll'lt Plahoratns. 
Beginning his fn~shman expni'itmcn in South BPIHI, Kt>llett drPW for tlw "Scholastic," fnatur­ing a "Far Sidn"-inspired strip dubbed "Mammoth Crossing." llowevPI', thP t~xperit~IH~n )pft him dissatisfied; "Doing o1w strip a week didn't IPnd itst.Jf to building l'haraeters tho way I wantl'd." So ranH~ about his involvenwnt with The Obsnrvnr, and Llw daily "Four Food (;roups" was horn. 
With its hilariously distinct charactnrs. known to inspin~ mort• than a ft~w smilns of wry rl'cognition, 'Tour Food Croups" has bet~onw a kind of funny photo album with which to eap­lurn llw most typical, nu~morablt~. and. most of all, entertaining experiences gathered in four years at Notre Dame. The scores of cut-out strips adorning bulletin boards and dorm room walls across campus speak for themselves. From the squabbling amidst the grandly-ideal­izing PLS major and his mechanically-minded engineer roommate, to ironic looks at question­able administration policies and the secrets of ND "social life," the cartoon summarizes in a few cleverly chosen words and character expressions what Notre Dame truly is all about. 
"A Well-Balanced Meal" has taken a careful and painstaking road to completion. After con­siderable time spent researching book possibili­ties and "talking to lots of people," Kellett set­tled on a publishing company, Franklin Press of 1\lkhart, in late February. Investing all of his savings and taking a deep breath, he turned in his final version over spring break...and the rest, as they say, is history. 
"I just hope I don't lose TOO much money," Kellett laughs. With the following "Four Food Groups" has acquired, anything Jess than a thrilled response seems highly unlikely. Still, Kellett's enthusiasm for the book centers not on profit, but on pride. "I was really jazzed to see the linal product," he relates. "It's amazing to see something 'physical that you've created... even in this electronic age, there's just something so special about a book." 
Kellett estimates that he has cral'ted 360 "Four Food Groups" over the years; the anthol­ogy contains what he describes as "the best 300 i"n chronological order." "A Well-Balanced Meal" is expected to be available in both Larortune and the bookstore by today; at nine dollars a copy, the investment is clearly worth­while. 
Now that "Four rood Groups" has a perma­nent place in Notre Dame history, what awaits its creator'? Kellett admits that cartooning "is my dream career. It's a very tough business to break into, though; I'll never give up drawing, but I'm looking at 'practical and probable' careers right now." Such career possibilities include teaching and publishing, opportunities whirh will no doubt utilize his talents...albeit without Nate and Sheldon present to put their two eents in. 
Ht~gardless of the path he chooses to follow after leaving South Bend, Dave Kellett will always have a place at Notre Dame. All it takes is laughter and a "well-balanced meal" to get there.

There is some heavy chemistry gofh.g on between Jax and Brenda. During her stay at the hospital (after she was the victim of a hit and run), Jax showered her with attention, visits and flowers ... supposedly "all part of the plan" to make Sonny furi­ously jealous. However, upon Brenda's release, Jax "kidnapped" her and whisked her off to his mansion in Hollywood, where they enjoyed long walks on the b~ach, shared stories of their pasts, and, in general, hugged each other a lot. Thert} was some kiss­ing involved, although Brenda stopped it, due to her love for Sonny (is this girl crazy or what'?). I am wondering just where their little plan is going to lead them. 
Meanwhile, Tom and Felicia shared a passionate kiss in the interrogation room of the Port Charles PD. The two are helping Garcia solve the "who killed Damian Smith" mystery (their con­clusion is anyone could have done it). While arguing over tactics and suspects, the two locked lips. It is definitely about time. 
Keesha and AJ have been growing closer in the wake of Jason's accident. They have gone out and even kissed once. Believe it or not, it was AJ who put a halt on things. Maybe some of that Quartermaine conscience (ha ha) is kicking him. 
Jason, meanwhile, is working on the docks under tlHi assumed name of Morgan, and none of the Q's know where he is. Emily and Robin found him, thanks to Lucky, and both promised not to tell Jason's ever-loving family of his hideout.

Ned and Lois are still on the outs, although the miracle of life brought them together for a moment.

Lois, meanwhile, calls Ned's office, and is told he is at GH in emergency. She rushes down there, sees Ned and the rather obviously pregnant Jenny, and jumps to conclusions. It. is all worked out, though, when the situation is explained, and Lois and Ned hold Jenny's hands while she gives birth. Afterwards, Ned and Lois talk about the mystery they have just witnessed and how Lois would like to be able to trust Ned again. 
Meanwhile, the PI Bobbie hired to find her daughter dis­appeared with Bobbie's twenty-thousand dollars, leaving her broke and still in the dark.

Miller undergoes eye socket surgery, may miss first round playoff action 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS 
Reggie Miller, the Indiana Pacers' top scorer, will be out at least two weeks following surgery Sunday on his fractured right eye socket. 
Miller was injured in a collision with Otis Thorpe and Allan Houston of the Detroit Pistons on Saturday night in a game the Pacers won 91­86 
Pacers spokesman David Benner said Miller was scheduled to undergo surgery to repair his right eye socket at 7 p.m. EST Sunday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Indianapolis. A news con­ference was scheduled for 8:30 p.m. 
The two-week absence would cause Miller to miss some action in the first round playoffs, which begin April 25. 
In Saturday's game, Miller had scored 12 points in the first quarter before being injured. He spent the night at St. Vincent's, where doctors discovered his right eye socket had been frac­tured. 
Dr. Sanford Kunkel, the team's doctor, said Miller should be able to return to action in two to three weeks. 
Despite Miller's absence, Pacers forward Dale Davis said he was confident the team could still rally heading into the playoffs. But Davis admit­ted that the team was in for a challenge during Miller's recovery. 
"We'll we're definitely going to see what the character of this team is made of," said Davis. 

" ...1 think we've got the guys who are capable so it's going to be interesting to see who steps in." 
"We have Ricky (Smits) and Eddie Johnson and Travis (Best), so, hey, we'll be OK. But when you take Reggie out you're definitely taking a lot," he said. 
The 6-foot-7 Miller, a member of the U.S. Olympic "Dream" team, is averaging 21.1 points a game for the Pacers. 
Pacers fan Frank Thomas said he was impressed by the team's performance in their win Saturday over the Pistons. But he's con­cerned about how long Miller's recovery might take. 
"We need Reggie back as soon as possible," said Thomas. 
"The Pacers showed a lot of heart yesterday in winning that game. I know Reggie has a lot of heart so I'm hoping that Reggie will comes back, contributing in time for the playoffs." 
Another fan, Chett Womack, said Miller's injury creates a big scoring and emotional void for the Pacers. 
"I think he's really an emotional leader for them. I think he gives them an inner fire (to) get them back up," said Womack. 
The Pacers, who currently have a four-game lead over fourth-seeded New York, play host to Charlotte on Monday night at Market Square Arena. 
One more win by Indiana or loss by the Knicks would gave the Pacers the third seed.

Chicago swept the four games of the season series The Cays set the slow pace thatthey prefer, but they missed 12 of their first 18 shots and never recovered.

Jordan scored Chicago's final five points of the first half on a 3-pointer and a fast­break layup, putting the Bulls up 46-35, and they were never seriously threatened in the second half. 
A basket by Pippen gave them their biggest lead at 77­49 early in the fourth quarter. Cleveland answered with 10 straight points, capped by Dan Majerle's 3-pointer with eight minutes left, to get with­in 18, but Chicago's Steve Kerr abruptly stopped the run with a 3-pointer.

The Observer/Dave Murphy Shortstop Paul Turco and the rest of the Irish defense had its share of problems against Rutgers this weekend. 

Slide

single to center just two batters later, knotting the game at 2-2. 
Unable to regain the lead before the end of the seventh, the Irish saw the game go into extra innings, in which Rutgers' Paul Gallucci sent a two-run double to left center off reliever Mike Balicki, who had replaced Schmalz with one out in the in­ning. The Irish were unable to rally ofT of Scott Madison, who was masterful throughout eight innings. 
The first game also saw the Irish's recently poor baserun­ning factor heavily in the loss, as Scott Sollmann was caught snoozing on the basepaths with no outs in the bottom of the fifth with the score tied 2-2. 
Sandwiched between the two losses was a 5-3 Irish victory marked by masterful pitching by Alex Shilliday, who allowed just six hits in improving to 5-1 on the season, and Rich Sauget, who closed out the victory with three hitless innings to earn his fifth save of the season. 
J. J. Brock continued his hot hitting with a 3-4, two run per­formance, and the Irish got RBI from four separate players to overcome another poor show­ing in the field. 
In game three Notre Dame turned the tables on Hutgers. The Irish, recently known for their run generosity in the early going, instead sprung out to a 5-0 lead. Jeff Wagner ignited the offense in the second inning with his sixth home run and George Restovich doubled and scored on a Brock single. 
The Irish continued where they left off in the third. Freshman Allen Greene, who sparked the team with a 4-for-7 performance in two games, doubled to left and eventually scored on a balk by pitcher Mike See!. Randall Brooks sin­gled and scored for a 4-0 Notre Dame lead. 
But pitchers Christian Parker and Sauget collapsed, as did the defense behind them. Sauget came on in the sixth after the Knights shelled Parker for four runs an inning earlier. Sauget immediately threw two wild pitches, and then walked three batters and hit two more. The result was a 5-5 ballgame. 
The telling moment of the game and the series came in a dreadful Irish ninth inning. 
In a 7-7 game, Brooks knocked down but failed to glove a sharp shot to second. Next, on what should have been the second out, catcher Bob Lisanti dropped a routine foul pop up behind home plate. Sauget eventually walked the batter. 
So instead of two outs and nobody on, there were two on and nobody out. The result was a 10-7 Rutgers lead that held up as the final score. After the game, Mainieri held a team meeting on the field. 
"Basically I was trying to keep the guys thinking positive about themselves," said the coach. "When you lose two close games like this, it's easy to get down on yourself, the team and the coaches. We felt we should have won the game and the series, but it's only one game and we'll be okay."

just as he was checked by a Tar Heel defenseman. Brian Gilfillan tied the score with more than two minutes remaining in the half, and goalie Alex Cade made two great saves to stop North Carolina's attack on their man­up opportunity. 
The Irish came out firing in the second half. When Heid found the back of the net, Notre Dame gained the lead for the first time. Only fifteen sec­onds later, Burke llayes scored to give the Irish a 7-5 lead. The Tar Heels, however, tied the score with two quick goals of their own. 
With the score tied at seven. the Irish put together their most impressive rally of the contest. Joe Bialous began the scoring when he sprinted down the left wing and beat the Tar Heel goaltender. After Dusseau's second tally of the game, senior Brian Erickson delivered a blistering shot 
(13:09 remaining) that gave the Irish a commanding 10-7 lead. 
An upset victory was seem­ingly within Notre Dame's grasp when North Carolina began its rally. After two quick Tar Heel goals Jude Collins delivered a low bouncing shot that slipped past Irish goalie Alex Cade to tie the score. 
The score remained tied until the final minute when Merrill Turnbull stunned the Irish players, coaches, and fans to give his Tar Heels the victory.

19-game win streak halted 
Villanova hands Notre Dame first Big East loss, Irish take next three in series 
By WILLY BAUER 
SportS Writer 
The old saying, "all good things must come to an end," seemed appropriate for Notre Dame's softball team this week­end. Villanova ended the Irish's 19-game winning streak, but Notre Dame exacted its 
revenge, beginning a new 
streak after taking the next 
three games from the Wildcats. 
The first set of the two doubleheaders, was Saturday, and the Irish split this first day losing 4-1, Notre Dame's first conference loss, and winning 10-5. Villanova's star pitcher Tina Sabunas held the Irish to only five hits and the lone run. The team had a chance to tie the game in the bottom of the sixth. Meghan Murray had already singled in a run and loaded the bases but no one else was able to produce any offense, stranding the three base runners. The Irish com­mitted four errors in the game, which led to the four Wildcat runs. 
In the nightcap however, Murray provided enough offense to almost win the game by herself. 
Murray blasted a towering shot over the left-center field fence with the bases full, to cre­ate the eventual final score of 10-5. Elizabeth Perkins collect­ed two doubles with one RBI and center fielder Jennifer Giampaolo had two hits and two runs. Joy Battersby pitched the complete game for the victory and had a double to help her cause. 

The Irish continued its win­ning ways on Sunday, this time sweeping the Wildcats, 4-3 and 6-0. It took Notre Dame, in blustery conditions, nine innings to dispatch of the Wildcats in the opening game. The Irish took a 3-2 lead into the top of the seventh when dis­aster struck. 
Two Irish errors, a bad throw to second base and a passed ball, resulted in the tying run for Villanova. In the bottom of the ninth, the Irish got its game-winning rally. Taking advantage of Villanova's shab­by defense, Kelly Rowe advanced to third with two outs. 
Katie Marten proceeded to rip a single down the third base line bringing in Rowe for the game winning run. Kelly Nichols collected the win after working two and two-thirds in­nings of relief for starter Angela Bessolo. 
Notre Dame only needed one of the six runs it produced to win the second game of the double dip. Battersby was dominating on the mound, toss­ing a one-hitter and striking out four. She allowed the solo hit in the first, and proceeded to allow three batters on base, due to walks. 
This was her second victory of the weekend and seventh for the season. Giampaolo was three for four and had three runs batted in. 
Murray was one of the Irish stars for the weekend. She hit .333 with six RBis over the four games. 
Giampaolo posted a .615 bat­ting average with four RBis. On the mound, Battersby col­lected two wins, upping her record to 7-5, and posted 12 strikeouts. Bessolo struck out nine for the weekend but was OJ1. 
The Irish have a week off until they face the defending Big East champion Connecticut at Ivy Field. The Irish will take its 11-1 record in the Big East conference into the game against the Big East power. The Huskies have won three of the past four Big East titles.

• THE MASTERS 
I 
I 
I 'Shark' chokes, gives tourna01ent, green jacket to Faldo 
~ 
~ 
ByRON SIRAK
I 
Associated Press 
~ 
AUGUSTA, Ga. 

I 
I Greg Norman smiled that smile that lights up a room and graciously, gener­ously insisted that life goes on, even 
after the biggest collapse in Masters his­tory. 
But the pain Norman masked so well! was so deep and was felt by so many who have watched him play out this
I 
scene so many times that even Nick
I 
Faldo was anguished.
I 
I "I honestly and genuinely feel bad for Greg," Faldo said after he shot a 67 Sunday to win the Masters at Augusta National Golf Club while Norman was stumbling to a 78. 

"I just wanted to give him a hug," Faldo said about the embrace he gave Norman on the final green after his 12­under-par 276 finished five strokes ahead of Norman and six better than Phil Mickelson. 
It was a startling finish to a day in which Norman started play with a six­stroke lead and finished five behind. No one has ever started the final round of a major championship with a six-stroke lead and lost. 
"What he has been through is horri­ble," Faldo said about the man who took a lead into the fmal round of a major for the sixth time, only to lose. 
"This is amazing," Faldo said about capturing his third green jacket and sixth major championship. "I hope I'm remembered for shooting 6 7 and not for what happened to Greg. But, obviously, this will be remembered for what hap­pened to Greg." 
Norman simply found his history too heavy to carry over the rolling hills and treacherous greens of Augusta National. 
But none of his previous collapses was as shocking nor as complete as the unraveling that began on the ninth hole and ended in the water in front of the 12th green. 
In that four-hole stretch, j\jorman went from three strokes ahead to two behind, enabling Faldo to play the kind of golf he does best-methodical. precise, con­trolled. 
"I screwed up. I really screwed up," Norman said. "It was all my mistakes today. But it's not the end of the world." 
By making up six shots on the final day, Faldo staged the third greatest comeback in major championship histo­ry. 
Jackie Burke came from eight strokes back in the 1956 Masters. But no one ever went into the final round of a major championship with a 
six-stroke lead and lost. 
"Maybe these hiccups that I have, that I inflict on myself, are meant for another reason," Norman said. '"Maybe some­thing good is waiting for me down the line." 
If there is any course where such a lead can be squandered and ground made up quickly, it is Augusta National under the intense pressure of a final­round Sunday at the Masters. 
"It's the most nerve-wracking course in the world," Faldo said. "It's as simple as that." 
It was reminiscent of the third-round confrontation between Faldo and Norman at the 1990 British Open at St. Andrews. 
Playing together, they started the day tied and Faldo beat him 67 to 76 and went on to win the championship. 
Norman would have needed only an even-par round in this final round to win. 
"Obviously, I didn't play as well as I could," Norman said. "Things didn't go my way. Nick played solid and steady and it was all my mistakes." 
While Norman, who has finished sec­ond in a major eight times, had to carry that history with him, Faldo had the comfort of his past successes. 
In 1989, Faldo trailed Scott Hoch by three strokes going to the back nine at Augusta and won in a playoff. The next year he trailed Raymond Floyd by two strokes going to the last nine and again won in a playoff. 
Now, only Jack Nicklaus with six and Arnold Palmer with four have won more Masters than Faldo and only 10 players in the long history of golf have won more major titles. It was Faldo's first major victory since the 1992 British Open. 
Faldo got into the spirit of the show­down between the two dominant golfers of the last decade on the first hole when he chose to putt out from 2 feet rather than marking, putting added pressure on Norman's 4-foot par putt. He missed. 
Faldo got within three strokes with a 22-foot birdie on No. 8, then Norman fell apart. 
He spun his approach shot back off the ninth green and missed a 10-foot par putt after a poor chip. He missed anoth­er 10-footer for par on No. 10 after missing the green left and three putted No. 11, missing the par putt from 30 inches. 
Then on No. 12, for the second straight day, Norman left his tee shot short in Raes Creek. While he was able to recover for a great bogey on Saturday, this time he made a 5.

Irish top Hoosiers for first time in history 

By KATHLEEN LOPEZ Sports Writer 

This past friday, history was made. The women's tennis team defeated Indiana for the first time ever. The Irish aeheived their revenge on their home territory. The Hoosiers did not have a chance the whole match, and fell to the eighth-ranked Irish, 7-0, who now improve to 18-5. 
"It was a good victory for us," stated head coach Jay Louderback. "Everyone played extremely well." 
The team got off to a quick start. The top doubles team of seniors Wendy Crabtree and Holyn Lord silenced their oppo­nents with some impressive teamwork. The seniors man­handled the Hoosiers, 8-1. "Holyn and I started off strong," stated Crabtree. "We played more aggressive. Also we took more chances, and we got the momentum going our way." 
Junior Erin Gowen and fresh­man Jennifer Hall have been a hot pair lately, and they showed it by dismissing their Indiana opponent, 8-6. 
"The No.1 doubles team played extremely well," com­mented Louderback, "IU played really well in the doubles com­petition, but they never really had a chance." 

At the No. 3 doubles position, the Irish dropped their only match. Freshman Marisa Velasco and sophomore Kelley Olson lost a heated match to IU's No. 3 doubles team, 6-8. 
In the singles competition, the Irish were unstoppable as they defeated IU at all of the singles spots. Hall chalked up a quick win, beating her opponent, 6-3, 6-1. At the second spot, Lord managed a victory, 4-6, 6-2, 6­
1. Crabtree also had a quick victory at the No.3 spot, 6-3, 6­
0. The fourth-seeded Velasco came up victorious, 7-5, 7-6. Sophomore Molly Gavin man­handled her opponent, 6-2, 6-1. 
At the No. 5 singles position, Gowen captured a win in im­pressive fashion, annihilating her Hoosier opponent, 6-0, 6-0. 
"She played really well," stat­ed Louderback, "Basically, she had no errors, and her oppo­nent did not have a chance." 
The Irish need this victory to gain some momentum heading into the Big East tournament. 
"It was an important match for us," stated Crabtree, "It was exciting for us to finally beat them. In the past they have had a strong program, so this win meant a lot." 
Today, the netters take on seventh-ranked Wisconsin at Eck. The showdown is sched­uled for 3:00 p.m.

Weekend woes 

No. 5 North Carolina rallies in fourth quarter to squeak past No. 7 Notre Dame lacrosse 
By TODD FITZPATRICK Spons Writer 
The Notre Dame lacrosse team will remember Saturday's heartbreaking loss as the one that slipped away. 
Fifth-ranked North Carolina rallied from a three-goal deficit in the final period to defeat the Irish 11-10 at Moose Krause Stadium. The Tar Heels' game-winning goal came with only 33 seconds remaining. The loss drops Notre Dame's record to 7-2 and halts their winning streak at seven games. 
"We thought we had a cushion going into the last quarter, so we sat back on our heels. We should have known that it would take more than ten goals to win that game. It takes sixty minutes of good play to win. Forty-five minutes isn't going to get it done," said junior Tony Reid. 
The seventh-ranked Irish may have lost the game, but their effort proved they deserve to be considered one of the nation's top ten teams. 
"Coach I Kevin Corrigan] said that we shouldn't hang our heads," commented Reid. "I think the game pointed out to us that we can play with anyone." 
The Tar Heels stormed out to a 4-1 lead in the second period, so Irish head coach Kevin Corrigan ialled a timeout to reverse the momentum. His strategy worked as Notre Dame added two quick goals by mid­fielder Andy Scollan and attacker Chris Dusseau. 
After another North Carolina tally, junior Will DeRiso scored on a tremendous effort

Defense, pitching fail as Notre Dame baseball slips against Rutgers 
By DYLAN BARMMER Assistant Sports Editor and T. RYAN KENNEDY Sports Writer 
Suddenly home has become less of a haven for the Notre Dame baseball team, as the Irish dropped two of three crucial Big East games to National division rival Rutgers over the weekend. 
The two Irish losses were marked by suspect fielding and poor baserunning, as the Irish committed seven errors while stranding a total of16 runners on base in a 4-2 loss on Saturday and a 10-7 setback on Sunday. 
"It was disappointing because we had a 5-0 lead (on Sunday), and we felt our pitcher had good stuff," said head coach Paul Mainieri. "But our pitching let them back in the game and our defense failed us in the end. You have to make the plays when the pressure's on." 
The Irish were often unable to deal with that pressure throughout the weekend, as 10 errors over three games led to six often costly unearned runs. 
It was just such an error which came back to haunt Irish ace Darin Schmalz in the first game of Saturday's twinbill. which featured an impressive pitching duel between two staff aces. After short­stop Paul Turco had put the Irish up 2-1 with a single off the glove of second base­man Rich Saitta in the bottom of the fourth, Schmalz fielded a chopper to the left of the mound by Ed Belko and over­threw first baseman George Restovich, al­lowing Belko to advance to second. Saitta then knocked in Belko from third with a
