Freshman orientation begins for 2,000 plus 
by Hank Bell 
Freshmen orientation begins today at Notre Dame and tomorrow at St. Mary's. 1660 men will be entering Notre Dame this fall and 484 women will be entering St. Mary's. 
The ND-SMC class of '73 surpasses the class of '72 in all fields of academic endeavor on the high school level. 
One of the prime standards used by college administrators in determing admissions is rank in class. Among the present crop of Notre Dame frosh, an 
Frosh session 
conducted 
Eighty-five upperclassmen 
met last Wednesday and 
Thursday to consider the issues 
and problems facing the 
incoming freshmen. Father Dan 
Boland of the Counseling 
Center, who conducted the 
Group Building Workshop, said 
the purpose was "to help the 
student volunteers to become 
aware of the experience that any 
person, particularly a freshman, 
goes through when he nters an 
unfamiliar social setting or 
institution. We want to make 
orientation more person 
centered than fact centered." 
The eighty-five 
upperclass men, representing 
twelve residence halls, will lead 
discussions with the freshmen 
during orientation week. 
overwhelming 90% ranked in the top 30% of their respective classes. Fully 50% of the freshmen ranked in the top I0% of the class. The statistics are equally impressive for the girls at St. Mary's. A total of 87% ranked in top third of their class, while 39% ranked in the top terith. 
One of the most important national norms used by admissions officers is the so called "college boards." The ND frosh achieved mean scores of 564 in verbal, and 616 in math. The bulk of the scores of the SMC girls fell in two ranges. In the verbal test, 251 out of 484 women scored between 500-600, while 129 scored above 600. In math 236 women hit the 500-600 range, while 120 had 600 or above. 
One of the most prestigious nation-wide scholarship tests is the National Merit Scholarship test. Students attaining the postion of semi-finalist or finalist are generally considered to be the intellectual elite of the nation's high school seniors. Notre Dame boasts 60 members of the class of 1973 achieving this high honor, while the SMC class of '73 has ten such winners. A total of 320 ND frosh and 38 SMC women received some sort of recognition from the National Merit board.

organization is the National Honor Society. This society consists of students who have maintained at least an 85% (3.0) average, and participated in extra-curricular activities. 53.5% of the ND frosh and 38% of the SMC frosh belonged to this organization. 
The ND Class of '73 contains 92 valedictorians, while there are 22 SMC girls who attained that honor.

Students Against Racism arc adopting a similar method of presentation to freshmen. Students will be manning tables covered with literature and will be available for discussion in four halls at Notre Dame, one hall at St. Mary's, and in the old ISO room, I D, in the Student Center, today through Sunday. 
Individuals from Students Against Racism were involved in the sending to the parents of freshmen the letter concerning racism at Notre Dame and in society and an urging to help in combatting it. 
Ed Roickle, a member of the group, explained the purpose in this manner: 
"We are trying to get people to think about the racist nature of our society and of our university in particular. We are trying to promote a dialogue between the people from Students Against Racism and the rest of the students as a first step in an educational process we plan to continue throughout the 
year. 
John Wilson, a leader of the group, felt that change will come about at Notre Dame only when "we change the institutions of Notre Dame we see as racist and also by at t a eking the attitudes and ignorance of white students that these institutions both reflect and propagate." 
Responding to a question of why he considers Notre Dame a racist university, he replied: 

"Because it seems to be very attitudes in themselves might for them makes them racist." one dimensional in its approach not be racist, but the fact that The four Notre Dame halls are to standards and values which they are being forced down Morrissey, Dillon, Alumni, and are strictly white middle class other student's throats in which Keenan-Stanford and the St. and narrowly Christian.

Reality and illusion 
The campus is a groovy place to be. Bigger and better education absorbs bigger and better students every year at this time: Notre Dame is doing that now, and St. Mary's will begin that tomorrow. For the next five days, ND-SMC will fete the class of '73 and their parents: lectures, welcomes and aids to getting settled will swallow the hours. Most pictures will be rosy, and the food will taste 
relatively good. Illusion is the name of the game, but the rest of the year will follow this week. Reality is the name of that. 
The Notre Dame or St. Mary's that you know are painted from football stadiums, from glossy brochures, from dark bars populated by subway alumni and from the fond, if somewhat inaccurate, memories of old grads. There is no such place. 
A university is its people as the June issue of the Notre Dame Alumnus proclaims on its cover, and to typify the people the list of words would run, from left to right, including idealists, cynics, dropouts, pooh bahs and people who watch television 24 hours a day seriously. But superceding these categories, there exists a growing number of people who are frustrated, discontent and at various times enraged with the reality of the place as it is. As it exists! 
For all its public relations descriptions and images, there still stands an oppressive community where existing democratic structures muddle along rhetorically or are by-passed completely, where problems are solved by issuing decrees or by 141-page treatises, but none of the oppression disappears. 
Notre Dame-St. Mary's presses on as an educational institution proyiding barriers to the students actually obtaining an education, and the term "intellectual community" would never be defined if it were dependent on this plot of ground. 
Scholarship and the intellectual community cannot prevail where in loco parentis exists, where the faculty senate has no power and things like racism go unconfronted and undiscovered. 
There are more problems, and there are more com:reu!~ manifestations of the problems pointed out. Amidst all of the realities, the giat solution looms: melt into the passivity of Joe College rooting for the Fighting Irish. But this, unhappily, is the greatest part of the reality. 
This is merely a message in a bottle, however, it will not cancel the "Official Welcome". The illusion may very well carry on through until November 22, the final football game. But self-discovery is the most convincing knowledge anyway. And you will discover and be convinced. As the sign says, "Welcome, Freshmen, You are here."

The letter 
If you asked the parents of the close to I 700 Freshmen converging on the Notre Dame campus today what they had heard about Notre Dame since their son applied here last fall you would probably get two responses. The first would have something to do with football -either that Notre Dame lost an important game to Purdue early in the season, got beat by arch rival Michigan State, or tied Southern Cal in an exciting game on the coast. The second would be that Father Hesburgh took one of the toughest stands on campus violence of any administrator in the country. 
With the statements on football no one rould take any exception. 
Notre Dame is given some of the finest press coverage in the country on its football team and in football it is not very hard to see who has lost or won. 
Father Hesburgh's letter though is a different story, because no paper reported much of the background behind it -and the game's not really over so it is still hard to tell who's really won or lost -if anyone. 
Father Hesburgh himself takes exception with the press coverage of his letter. It's not a "get tough" policy, he daims, but simply an attempt to set some guide lines for student protest. An attempt, he hopes, at introducing a rational alternative to the violence that has plagued other college campuses. 
Hesburgh's position is that any protest which "substitutes force for rational persuasion" will be broken up by giving the participants fifteen minutes in which to cease and desist their actions. If at the end of that time they do not they will be asked to turn in their I.D. cards and will be suspended. They will be given five more minutes in which to leave the premises. If they still do not they will be expelled, "assumed not to be members of the community" "be charged with trespassing and disturbing the peace", "and tr~ated accordingly by the law." 
Now the reaction by Notre Dame students to the letter was mild. A great number agreed with it. Only a few openly opposed it. But a great number agreed with Senator Eugene McCarthy who commented that the proposal reminded him of a leader of an all girl's band who threatened to fire any girl he caught chewing 
tobacco. 
A lot of students believe that the ruling was just not needed here. But rules are rarely made because of a threat from the majority of people--they are made because of a threat from the minority . And the administration, which saw recruiting on campus by Dow Chemical and the CIA disrupted last year by a sit-in, seems to think that it is necessary. 
The issue of whether or not th'! policy is needed is an old one; and whether or not it is, it is here to stay. No one hopes it will really be used or tested. But if it is not to be then it is the obligation of the administration to begin to emphasize more fully the parts of the letter which did not receive national publicity. 
There were promises of opening more fully channels of communication between the alienated student and the administration. There were promises of hard work on the part of administrators and students to improve the quality of the Notre Dame community. There were promises for a new era of student-administrator relations at Notre Dame. 
It is those things that are to be looked forward to this year. No violence. Civility, rationality, reason. It is going to take hard work on both sides. But if you ask Ara, that's how you win football 
games.

Six 'laughers' grace Irish schedule, 
For the first time sinL:e the famous Hanratty-Seymour duo hit the airways, the Notre Dame offense will be a question mark. Nine regulars from the fabulous offensive squad from last fall have departed including Hanratty, Seymour, A II-A meri can tackle George K unz and the entire starting baL:kfield. 
In the year of the wishbone--T and the veer offense the Irish touchdown producers will be an anachronism, a throwback to Woody Hayes' days of three yards and a cloud of dust. 
With half a dozen bruising straight ahead runners the Irish will run, run, run. In fact the Notre Dame backfield set may sport three runners who may bery well have been fullbacks at any other school. What few breakaway runners the Irish have will probably not crack the starting lineup. 
Top line returnees from the offensive team which amassed 500 yards per game and averaged more than 37 points are senior All-American prospects Larry DiNardo and Jim Reilly. Reilly (6-2, 230) and DiNardo (6-1 by 
243) along with senior center Mike Oriard will furnish considerable bulk :~nd experience on one side of the line. Oriard ( 6-3, 215) started the final half of the season. 
Six-four, 200-pound senior Dewey Poskon has moved into the tight end position but sopohomore Tom Gatewood has been a pleasant surprise at the split end slot. 
Fullback Jeff Zimmerman, plagued by· injuries last season after a fine sophomore season, will head the running attack with five or six runners vying for the other two spots. At present, senior Ed Ziegler looks like the choice for one slot and 
sophomore Andy Huff will man the other slot if his injuries heaL Senior Dennis Allan and sophomores Bob Minnix (the only breakaway threat) and John "Cisco" Cieskowski are contesting the top three and who will actually start in the backfield against Northwestern next weekend is at best a calculated guess. 
Guard Gary Kos and tackle Chuck Kennedy are the top prospects for the vacated spots on one side of the line. 
If the Irish runners will be the Jim Taylor-type, scrambling Joe Theismann (as in Heisman) will he the darling of the fans. Now a junior, Theismann ( 170) started the final three games for Notre Dame last year for an injured Terry Hanratty and engineered the tie with Southern Cal and 
O.J. Simpson. 
Theismann's arm is more than adequate and his running is a pleasure to behold, if he can find enough receivers to catch his bullets. 
The defense, whose inexperience hurt the Irish early in the season, will be the strong point of the 1969 edition, in a Year of the Offense. 
The quickness and mobility of a pair of sophomore defensive ends will give Notre Dame something more than the size it's always had. Walt Patulski (6-5, 
235) and Fred Swendson (6-4, 
230) will be crucial to the Irish front four. All-American candidate Mike McCoy will return for his third season at defensive tackle. His perform anee in throttling Simpson in last fall's finale has earned the 6-5, 280-pounder several pre-season All-American selections. 
Sophomore Greg Marx was expected tu be the other tackle, but he broke his arm earlier this week and head coach Ara Parseghian and his staff have yet to make a decision on whether a make-shift arm protector will allow the youngster to play. Soph Mike Zikas has moved up. 
Captain Bob Olson heads the linebacker corps. He will team with Bob Neidert, Tim Kelly and Larry Schumacher to provide needed backup for the sophomorish front four. 
Chuck Zloch and John Gasser, both experienced, will be the starting defensive halfbacks with 
sophomore Clarence Ellis displacing former regular Don Heid at the safety slot. 
Notre Dame followers should know by October 18 whether the Irish will be national championship contenders as they must face Purdue, Michigan State, Army and Southern Cal, after opening with Northwestern. 
A brief look at the Irish opponents: 
Northwestern 
Despite the Wildcats' 1-9 mark last fall, Alex Agase's charges play dead for no one. The ·irish managed only a 7-0 halftime lead in Notre Dame stadium last fall before eking out a 27-7 win. _,. 
NOTICE 
The office of Teacher Preparation is now located in Room I II0 East in the Memorial Library. 
Eugene A. Campanale Associate Director Office of Teacher Preparation 
283-8562 
Junior Dave Shelbourne tops 
the Wildcat attack. As a soph,_hc 
completed I 05 passes for 1 ,35S 
yards and seven touchdowns. 
Although Northwestern is 
expected to have added some 
speed in the backfield, the 
Wildcat offensive damage will be 
done through the skyways. 
Whether Shelbourne will have 
enough time to get off his aerial 
bombs is the question. Only one 
offensive lineman returns. 
An inexperienced defensive line will be backed by a tough set of returning linebackers, but the defensive secondary has graduated. 
Although the Wildcats play tough, Theismann should have the opportunity to test his passing game without too much threat and the runners should be off to a fine start. Notre Dame should open with a well earned, if not exciting, victory. 
Purdue 
Jack Mollenkopf has beaten Ara Parseghian twice in a row, three of the last four years, and is the only coach to hold a winning record over Parseghian since he came to Notre Dame in 1964. 
One thing is certain. T!le Boilermakers will not score 37 points on the Irish this fall. Seven possibly eight offensive starters will be missing, beginning with Leroy Keyes. However there are reserve lettermen available to fill every position. 
Mike Phipps, a genuine All-American prospect at the signal-calling spot, is one of the returnees, however. Speedy John Bullock, from Keyes' hometown, will try to fill the great's vacated slot 
Phipps has completed half of 412 passes in two years, and outdueled Hanratty two years ago in Lafayette. 
Mollenkopf "feturns eight defensive starters from a defense which yielded nearly I 7 points per game and more than 300 yards. All-American middle guard Chuck Kyle is gone. But the Boilermakers return a pair of excellent linebackers. Irish fans will remember Veno Paraskevas and Dick Marvel returns after injuries. 
The Purdue line is large and ponderous, but can be outquicked. Parseghian wants this one--the Irish should celebrate in Lafayette. 
Michigan State 
Colorful Duffy Daugherty promises a colorful offense, the latest fashion in collegiate offenses, the veer offense and the triple option. Duffy spent half the winter and spring on the phone with Darrell Royal of Texas who invented the wishbone-T utilizing the triple option. 
The only problem is that it requires four studs in the backfield. Duffy may have them, and what's more frightening, the line to go with it. 
Quarterback Bill Triplett can run and pass, the ideal man to run the triple option attack Tlte Spartans are chin-strap deep in quality running backs beginning with Tommy Love, Don Highsmith and fullback Gary Parmentier (moving from rover) and ending with frosh sensation Eric Allen, Earl Anderson and Kermit Smith. 
The offensive, line is experienced and rumor has it Duffy considers it the finest he has had in a long while. The defense returns much strength, particularly at linebacker. 
Probably the weakest part of the Spartans this fall early will be the defensive secondary, which is all new. 
End and linebacker play will be crucial against the Spartans, and the inexperience of the two Irish sophomore ends could hurt. Theismann should be able to throw against Michigan State but the success of the running game will be important. This is one of the few games the Irish could lose. 
Army 
Tom Cahill will have to pull another phenomenal coaching job out of his hat is Army is to be on the same field at the conclusion of the October 4 clash in Yankee Stadium. 
Eight regulars are gone from the defense and there are comparatively no lettermen to take up the slack. Last fall's frosh squad will add little. 
Army has expereenced runners headed by captain Lynn Moore but no quarterback is in sight. Notre Dame should win before a nice Eastern crowd. 
Southern Cal 
The Trojans have won only one time in South Bend since 1939, two years ago when O.J. Simpson and his national champions handed Parseghian his worst defeat as Irish coach. 
Like Notre Dame, Southern Cal will be strongest on defense and Johnny McKay suspects that this year's defense will be better than 1967's. Only two are missing but USC is deep and

Tulane 
Students, players and coaches alike will find the trip to New Orleans pleasant as Notre Dame will doubtless humble the Green Wave on a clear night in the Sugar Bowl. 
Corning off a 2-8 season in Jim Pittman's fourth year of rebuilding, Tulane is laden with sophomores who will relegate regulars from last year to the second learn.

Tulane's defense last fall was horrendous. But sophomores will add size and speed, if not experience. Three linebackers return to support a line whi~.:h

secondary is fair. 
No matter how much sophomoric talent Tulane possesses, they should make enough mistakes to keep Ara happy, and even if they don't, Tulane is a year or two away from mu~.:h over a .500 record. 
Navy 
Whenever a coach sums up his suuad's prospecls with something like "we hope our attitude and aggressiveness will help nullify our weaknesses" then you know he's in trouble. 
Navy's Rick Forzano said something like that and the Middies arc in trouble. To help shore up a porous defense, Frozano moved the offensive line to defense in his new 4-3 alignment. The secondary is questionable. 
The intenor offensive line is seasoned and the Navy strong suit, if that's an accurate description, will be the

Quarterback is the big question as high school sensation Charlie Dudish has not glittered nearly so much since he hit the Tech campus. Soph tailback Brent Cunni ngha rn is the brightest spot in the Yellow Jackel backfield.

A fairly successful year will mean nine wins; six wins will be 
a disappointment.
