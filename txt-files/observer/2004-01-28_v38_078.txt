!Ieavy snow and biting winds didn't stop Notre Dame students from attlmding Tuesday's Winter Career and Internship Fair. 
The Camer Center sponsored the annual event. offering a forum for students and employ­ers to interact. Students from all majors and levels were encour­agPd to attend. 
Anita Hees. associate director of the Career Center. described Tuesday's turnout as "A-plus" and "No. 1." She said that a few employers had to cancel bt~cause of the weather. but praised the commitment of those who struggled to arrive. 
Jim lleffernan. a representa­tive from Travelers, approximat­ed his involvement with the fair at 10 years. lie described this year's experience as successful. 
''I've seen a lot of students," llnll'ernan said. "Many Lof them! seniors. but also many other lev­els." 
Nathan Frisbee, a representa­tive from Schlumberger Technology Corp .. also praised the event. ''I'd say that Notre Dame students present them­selves very professionally," Frisbee said. "Much more so than public school ones." 
Hees was happy with what she 
saw. "I (saw( resumes piled on tables, superb resumes, long lines and rather lengthy conver­sations between students and employers," she said. 
She added that even if a stu­dent fails to get a job, "They have still learned valuable skills and developed relationships" in their field.

Tuesday's Winter Career and Internship Fair brought thoughts of the future job market to many Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and Holy Cross students' minds. 
While students waited in lines to meet with prospective employ­ers, they found time to consider jobs after graduation and ques­tion whether the search would be as difficult as it has in past years. 
President George Bush's State of the Union Address said that "economic growth in the third quarter of 2003 was the fastest in nearly 20 years ... and jobs are on the rise." Yet, his confi­dence in the job market has not carried over to all job-seekers. 
Seniors Christa Moen and Sarah Lathrop both agreed that the state of the economy left them "defmitely afraid." Lathrop explained that "the market is saturated," resulting in difficulty finding jobs. Moen added that level jobs, to which Lathrop cited that "most people don't want entry level jobs" coming out of a university. 
Other seniors did not have the same feelings of a quickly approaching job market. Andrea Manka, an economics major, plans on attending law school after graduation and therefore, is not as worried about the market. 
Sophomore Trey Williams also attended the career fair, saying 
chances are slim, even for entry see SENIORS/page 6 

Judge signs order to disllliss tribe suit 
Dismissal would require settlement or land grant 
By SCOTT BRODFUEHRER 
News Writer 
A federal judge has signed an order to dismiss the lawsuit tiled by the Hannahville Indian Community against Notre Dame and the U.S. Government once either a settlement is reached or the government granlo; additional land for the tribe's reservation. 
The lawsuit claimed that part of Notre Dame's campus belonged to the tribe, which is a successor of the Potawatami Tribe. The suit claimed the state of Indiana ille­gally transferred land belonging to the Potawatami to Notre Dame. 
Under the first option, Notre Dame spokesman Matt Starin said that if a settlement is reached, it would likely not require payment by the University. 
The second option for dismiss­ing the suit would require the President of the United States to issue an Executive Order directing the Secretary of the Interior to give non-contiguous land to the tribe in Michigan. Indiana and Illinois to be added to the tribe's reservation. 
The tribe's reservation is cur­rently located in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, where it owns and operates Chip-In's Island Hesort and Casino in Harris, Mich. 
Robert Miller Jr.. the chief judge for the South Bend division of the United States District Court, signed the order of dismissal Monday. It followed a stipulation of dismissal that was tiled Jan. 22 by Michael Walleri and John Hamilton, attorneys for the tribe,

Law students support spouse's polar bear jump, charity 

By KATE GALES 
News Writer 
Although it's been pretty chilly in Indiana lately, South Bend proves more hospitable to leprechauns then the 21-degree water of Alaska's Resurrection Bay. 
Tom Redmond, husband of Notre Dame law student Sonja Redmond, tested the waters himself -in a leprechaun cos­tume, no less -to raise money for the American Cancer Society. Tom leapt with 33 oth­ers in Seward, Ala. and raised over $750 dollars for charity. 
Appropriately named "Polar Bear Jump-Off," the fundraiser took place Jan. 17. 
"Basically, it's a bunch of insane peo'ple getting together to jump in icy cold water in the middle of January," Sonja said of her husband's leap. This is his fourth year participating in the event. 
Tom chose to dress as a lep­rechaun in acknowledgement of the Notre Dame law students who gave generously to the cause. Sonja made the costume while home over Christmas break. 
"I asked them to support his insanity -and the American Cancer Society," she said. "Students contributed and helped make it possible for him to [participate] ... and be our mascot this year." 
According to the Seward Chamber of Commerce, the first Polar Bear Jump-Off was held in 1986. It has since grown into a statewide winter festival where the main event is still the jump, in which all participants are required to wear costumes. 
"We live 80 miles from Seward," Sonja said, "and when I called my husband on Saturday to offer moral sup­port, he said the temperature at our house was reading -31 degrees."

INSIDE COLUMN 
Nutcase or scumbag? 
The results from New Hampshire are in and former Vermont Gov. Howard "Mad Howe" Dean got drilled. But why? I don't think the voters are looking at policy. They're looking at the candidates' personalities. So, 
what's wrong with Howard Dean? 
Is he a genuinely evil person, or does he just suffer from serious psychiatric disorders? There are some pretty strong arguments 

either way. That's Matt Bramanti why I'm happy to 
present the Scumbag or Wire Editor Nutcase Scorecard. 
First, let's look at the good doctor's reaction after the Iowa caucuses. You might have heard Dr. Dean's audio clips on the Internet the next day. 
"We're going to California and Texas and New York, and we're going to South Dakota and Oregon and Washington and Michigan!" Dean exclaimed. "And then we're going to Washington, D.C. to take back the White House!" 
Okay, sounds like a standard rally-the­troops speech. Until the primal scream. That's right, after "take back the White House," Dean let out a guttural holler that The New York Tunes dubbed simply "The Scream." Verdict: outcase. 
Which brings us to the Dean deli caper. The NBC affiliate in Des Moines, Iowa reported that the Dean campaign bought 200 lunches from the Brown Bag Deli, and then walked on the check. The deli's owner, Scott Hoffinan, said the Dean workers stiffed him for $963.01. Let me repeat this: the man stole hundreds of sandwiches. This event brought to you by the man who wants to preside over a $10 trillion economy. Verdict: scumbag. 
And now on to the war. Dr. Dean said the standard of living ofthe Iraqi people "is a whole lot worse now than it was before." I guess rape rooms, torturing soccer players for losing games, and exe­cuting political opponents are the hall­marks of a high standard ofliving. Verdict: nutcase. 
Let's analyze the deeply seated reli­gious beliefs ofthe man who would lead the free world. About 25 years ago, he left the Episcopal Church. Was it a com­plicated theological issue? Ordaining women, perhaps? Nope. He changed religions over a bike path. The city of Burlington wanted to build a municipal bike path on the church's property. Church leaders said no. So Dean became a Congregationalist. The man renounced his religion over a strip of government concrete. Verdict: scumbag. 
In an interview with People magazine, Dean revealed a history of anxiety and panic attacks, including one when he was elected governor of Vermont. Now, for the ordinary person, I guess that's not so bad. But we're talking about the guy who can push the nuclear button when­ever he feels like it, and I don't want the jumpy type. Verdict: nutcase. 
Ok, there you have it; the Scorecard never lies. Howard Dean appears to be completely off his gubernatorial rocker. 
Sorry, Howe, but it's not my fault you're stark raving mad. Please don't go on a multi-state killing rampage.

HUDSON, N.H.-A man who rescued a stray cat from the cold got the favor returned on Sunday when the cat woke him as his house filled with smoke.

Rioux was able to get up in time to call the fire depart­ment and evacuate safely.

Keough, Welsh Family win LNO 
Over $8,000 raised for St. Joseph's County Special Olympics 
By JOE TROMBELLO 
Nows Writ« 
The 1.100 students who partici­pated in Friday's Late Night Olympics miscd approximately $8, 100 for the St. Joseph's County Spm:ial Olympics charity, an assis­tant dirc~ctor of HecSporL'i said. 
Bill Hnagan said that the funds raisNI nxcneded last year's by nearly $1.400. The all-night event !'natured competition among Notre Dame and Saint Mary's dorms in an array of athletic activities. 
"We went for nine hours in the middle of the night with no behav­ior incidents, a lot of great compe­tition. a tremendous amount of fun and very few injuries," Heagan said. "I continue to be amazed by the depth of the gen­erosity in terms of time, effort and funds on behalf of our students for special causes." 
For the third consecutive year, the Keough/Welsh Family Hall team won the event and raised a total of $825 to be shared b1~twecn their dorms. O'Neill and Lyons finished in second place, while a team of MBA students took third place. This year was the first that a graduate school team participated. 
Members of both Keough and Wehih Family attributed their suc­cess to tho publicity that occurs and the excitement generated among their dorm residents. 
"With all the promoting that we do in our dorms, people get very excited about the event and look forward to going," said Melissa Sands, Welsh Hall athletic com­missioner. "It was especially enjoyable to watch everything come together so well after spending a couple of weeks pro­moting, collecting money and get­ting things organized." 

Students said that knowing the money donated went to charity contributed to their participation in Late Night Olympics, but many also cited the sense of dorm spirit and bonding that accompanies the competition. 
"It is a great event for a good cause," said Nick Dobbertin, Keough Hall athletic commission­er. "I think the awareness that people have for Special Olympics is one incentive to participate, but what is more important is the pride that people have for their dorm and the draw of athletic competition. There is some kind of special bonding when the same six guys are running around from one event to another at 3 a.m." 
Keough Hall co-presidents Chris Duve and Joseph Sweigart said that they had not yet determined what the funds would be used for but said that they would somehow re-invest them into the dorm. They noted that in the past, win­nings have been used to fund pro­gramming events and jerseys for the IIall's athletic teams.

Former business school dean dies 
By AMANDA MICHAELS 
News Writer 

James Culliton, the former dean of Notre Dame's busi­ness school, died Jan. 23 from a heart-related illness at the Moorings of Arlington Heights retirement communi­ty. He was 92. 
Culliton joined the faculty of the College of Commerce ­soon to be called the College of Business Administration ­in 1951 and held the position of dean from 1955 to 1962. During his tenure, he revolu­tionized the College, starting a small, experimental pro­gram called the Program for Administrators that combined a mix of liberal, business and professional work with dis­cussion-oriented classes, which would become the col­lege's educational foundation, author Kerry Temple said in his book O'Hara's Heirs: Business Education at Notre Dame, 1921-1991. 
After earning a master's and a doctorate from Harvard Business School, Culliton taught at both Boston College and Harvard before coming to Notre Dame. Considered to be one of the elite minds of the time, he was appointed to the U.S. tar­iff commission by President John F. Kennedy, and contin­ued to serve under President Lyndon Johnson after Kennedy's assassination. 
"My father was a very intel­ligent but gentle person," Stephen Culliton, a DuPage County judge and 1964 Notre Dame alum, told the Daily Herald. "One day, he literally received a call from the White House to meet Kennedy. I thought it was a big deal, but my dad isn't easily overwhelmed by any­one." 
In 1968, Culliton and his family moved to the Philippines so he could become the first president of the Asian Institute of Management, an academic venture among the Ateneo de Manila University, De La Salle College, the Harvard Business School and the Ford Foundation. 
After retiring, Culliton dedi­cated his time to help individ­uals open their own business­es by volunteering for SCOHE. a national small business counseling organization, reported the Daily Herald. 
Culliton, whose wife of 48 years died in 1985, is sur­vived by sons William (a 1960 alumnus), Edward (a 1962 alumnus), Steve (a 1964 alumnus) and Hichard, 13 grandchildren and 17 great­grandchildren.

SMC emergency calls now sent to dispatcher 
By KELLY MEEHAN News Writer 
In an adjustment designed to improve emergency response time to campus, all 911 emergency calls made from Saint Mary's are now automatically forwarded to the St. Joseph County's office dis­patcher. 
Prior to the change, whenever 911 was dialed from an on-cam­pus phone, the call was sent directly to security who then would contact emergency servic­es. 
According to Telecommunications Director Sandy Handley, Saint Mary's recently updated the appropriate technology that enabled the new procedure to occur. 
"Whenever 911 is dialed a screen will pop up on the Security Department's computer notifying them of the exact location from where the call took place," Handley said. 
Saint Mary's now joins Notre Dame, whose emergency calls are also directly sent to emergency dispatchers. This is partly due to 

ND professor natned finalist for book a-ward 
By K. AARON VAN 
OOSTERHOUT 
News Writer 
After six years of research, George Marsden received an unexpected recognition for his most recent book, "Jonathan Edwards: A Ufe." 
Though unaware of how he was nominated, the Notre Dame histo­ry professor is one of the five final­ists for the National Book Critics Circle Award for 2003. This award has been given annually since 1981 to those authors that write, "the finest books published in English," as the committee's Web site describes the award. 
His book, a biography of the 18th century Christian Reformed preacher, will go before a review committee in March, and the awards ceremony will be broad­cast on C-SPAN on March 4. 
Marsden is competing against four other authors in the biogra­phy/autobiography division of the national prize, and, if selected, will join past winners, who include Frank McCourt for "Angela's Ashes" and Sylvia Nasar for "A Beautiful Mind." 
Marsden wrote the biography in lieu of 27 volumes of Edwards's writings published recently by Yale University Divinity School. Marsden said his writings provid­ed a new angle from which to

and University Deputy General Counsel William Hoye that called for dismissal if either of the two options were met. 
Storin said the University does an FCC ruling that will eventually mandate all 911 calls be sent directly to the local dispatch sta­tion. 
With all calls going directly to the St. Joseph County's office dis­patcher, Handley stresses the importance ofstaying on the line if 911 is dialed accidentally. Hanging up on the dispatcher's office will prompt them to imme­diately call the number back and alert Saint Mary's security to dis­patch an officer. It is best to stay on the line and state that calling was an accident to avoid wasting the time of security and the 911 dispatchers, Handley said. 
The College's new service is equivalent to what that used when dialing 911 from home. Saint Mary's security will avoid a poten­tially delay in the emergency response process through the for­warding of calls from the student to the dispatcher. 
"Our goal is to provide even quicker service to our campus by getting the call out to an ambu­lance more quickly," said Handley.

examine the preacher's life as an academic biography of Edwards has not been written since 1940. 
Marsden said this recent addi­tion to his library reflects his deep-rooted interest in the Protestant tradition. 
"Being in the [Christian] Reformed tradition myself, I was trying to understand what it would be like to be Reformed in that time," Marsden said. 
This is not the first time Marsden has received recognition for his work. In 2000, Christianity Today added Marsden's Fundamentalism and American Culture to its list of the top 100 Books of the Century, sandwiched between Sigmund Freud's tome "Civilization and its Discontents" and Aldous Huxley's dystopian groundbreaker "Brave New World." 
Marsden, who joined Notre Dame 12 years ago, specializes in American Protestant history, and has taught at many other Protestant-affiliated universities and colleges. 
He said Notre Dame attracted him because it was an excellent academic institution and retained its religious background and is interested in seeing if and how Notre Dame will continue to main­tain its Catholic tradition.

Arabs, Westerners deny oil bribes 
AMMAN, Jordan-Arabs and Westerners accused by Iraqis of receiving Iraqi oil pro­ceeds in exchange for supporting Saddam Hussein denied Tuesday they had accepted bribes or participated in illicit deals. 
The accusations surfaced this week in a report by one of the dozens of new newspa­pers that have begun publishing in Iraq since Saddam was ousted last March. Since, mem­bers of the new provisional Iraqi government and Saddam opponents have distributed a list of the accused, based on documents from the Iraqi Oil Ministry. 
About 270 former Cabinet officials, legisla­tors, political activists and journalists from 46 countries are on the list. suspected of profiting from Iraqi oil sales that Saddam had allegedly offered them in. 
Canadian serial killer found 
VANCOUVER. British Columbia ­Canadian police on Tuesday said they found the remains of nine more women for a total of 31 at a pig farm owned by the man alleged to be Canada's worst serial killer. 
Authorities said six of the women had van­ished from the city's seedy drug-infested eastside of downtown Vancouver. Three oth­ers have not been identified. 
Hobert William Pickton, 54, has already been charged with 15 counts of first degree murder in the disappearances of women over the past 20 years. and he's expected to be charged with seven more counts. No court date has been set. 
The remains of those 22 victims were also found at the farm. Cases involving the nine newly discovered victims are not included in those 22 counts. 
Eleven bodies found near border 
CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico -Police have dug up 11 bodies in the backyard of a house in this Mexican border city, in what they called the latest evidence of a growing drug battle being waged along the U .S.-Mexico frontier. 
The victims were apparently rivals of the Vicente Carrillo drug gang, and were execut­ed with "extreme violence" as long as six months to one year ago, Attorney General Hafael Macedo de Ia Concha said. Several of the victims had been strangled or suffocated. 
"This is a war among drug traffickers," Macedo de Ia Concha said. "It is a confronta­tion between cartels for territory."

Kerry wins in New Hampshire 
Dean's rally gives him second place finish in primary; Clark and Dean tie for third 
Associated Press 
MANCHESTER, N.H. ­John Kerry overpowered Howard Dean to win New Hampshire's primary Tuesday, scoring a second­straight campaign victory to establish the four-term sen­ator as the Democratic Party's presidential front­runner. 
"I ask Democrats every­where to join us so we can defeat George W. Bush and the economy of privilege," Kerry told supporters, promising to "reduce the poverty of millions rather than reducing the taxes of millionaires." 
Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina and retired Army Gen. Wesley Clark were in a distant race for third. Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, sagging to fifth place, rejected advice from some advisers to abandon his bid. 
After trooping through coffee shops, country stores and livings rooms of Iowa and New Hampshire, the candidates now move to the cold realities of a national campaign -airport rallies and multimillion-dollar ad buys in seven states holding contests next Tuesday.

Attendant on Sept. 11 plane cal111 in tape 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -Shortly before Flight 11 slammed into the World Trade Center, the American Airlines operations center received a calm phone call from one of its flight atten­dants. 
"The cockpit is not answering their phone," said Betty Ong. "There's some­body stabbed in business class and, we can't breathe in business. Urn, I think there is some mace or something. We can't breathe. I don't know, but I think we're getting hijacked." 
Ong, 45, known as "Bee," was on the American Airlines Boeing 767 flying from Boston to Los Angeles on Sept. 
Panel said FAA tninitnized attack scenarios 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -The Federal Aviation Administration focused on the danger of explosives aboard planes rather than a suicide hijacking before the Sept. 11 attacks even though its own security offi­cers warned terrorists might try to crash an airliner, a federal panel said Tuesday. 
The FAA's Office of Civil Aviation Security considered the risk of a suicide hijacking at least as early as March 1998, says the preliminary report by The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States. 
The commission report acknowledges there was no specific intelligence indicat­ing suicide hijackings would occur but says the FAA still had a responsibility to protect the flying public against such a threat. ' 
The commission wrapped up two days of hearings that focused on aviation and 11, 2001, before suspected 9-11 ring­leader Mohammed Atta and four oth­ers took over the plane and crashed it into the North Tower of the Trade Center. 
The Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States heard portions of her 23-minute conversation with the American Airlines operations center on the second of its two-day hearing Tuesday. 
Nydia Gonzalez, who was on duty at the operations center that morning, told the panel how she received Ong's call at about 8:20 a.m. 
"Several media accounts of what occurred on Flight 11 claimed that Betty was 'hysterical with fear,' 
border security lapses. The panel. which has been investigating the Sept. 11 attacks for a year and has held seven public hearings, wants Congress to extend its May 27 deadline by at least two months, saying it needs more time to review all the material. 
At Tuesday's hearing, the commission provided documents showing the FAA was aware of the possibility of suicide hijackings but did not pass the informa­tion along to airlines. 
In a presentation to airline and airport officials in early 2001, the FAA discounted the threat of a suicide hijacking because there was "no indication that any group is currently thinking in that direction." And when the agency issued a terrorism warning to air carriers in July 2001, it noted the risk of explosives inside luggage but did not mention suicide hijackings. 
At a commission hearing, panel mem­ber Timothy Roemer read from an FAA 'shrieking' and 'gasping for air,' she said. "Those accounts were wrong." 

"In a very calm, professional and poised demeanor, Betty Ong relayed to us detailed information of the events unfolding on Flight 11 ,'' Gonzalez added. "I honestly believe after my conversation with Betty that the 81 passengers and new crew members on Flight 11 had no idea of the fate they were to encounter that day." 
In the tape played before the com­mission, Ong tells the operations cen­ter her flight and seat number and describes the scene on board. 
"We can't even get into the cockpit. We don't know who's there," Ong says, before the call ends in a dial tone. 
document published in the Federal Register on July 17, 2001, stating that ter­rorism could occur "anytime, anywhere" in the United States and cautioning that the risk "needs to be prevented and coun­tered." 
"The dots are connected and they're large," said Roemer, a former Democratic congressman from Indiana. "Why didn't they result in a change in policy?" 
Catha! Flynn, former associate adminis­trator of civil aviation security at the FAA. responded that the agency only had a generalized sense of the risk and that security efforts were hampered somewhat by poor communication with the FBI. 
"It isn't that we disregarded them. There were disconnects," he said. "How would you coerce a pilot to fly into a building that's got people in it? ... How would you do that? The notion of a full­fledged al-Qaida member being a pilot ... did not occur to me."

IN BRIEF 
Kraft cuts jobs, closes plants 
CIIICAGO -Kraft Foods said Tuesday it will eliminate 6,000 jobs, or 6 percent of its work force, and close 20 plants worldwide after more than a year of disappointing sales and earnings for the biggest U.S. food company. 
About 1,300 salaried positions in North America will be eliminated in the first quarter. with the remaining cuts occurring over the next three years. Kraft said. 
Kraft's brands include Oreo cookies, Jell-0 desserts and Oscar Mayer hot dogs. Sales have been particularly sluggish for cookies and pizza. 
The company has about 50,000 employees in the United States and slightly more than I00,000 worldwide. 
The job cuts were announced as Kraft reported fourth-quarter profits of $869 mil­lion, a drop of 7 percent from a year earlier. 
Whistleblower beaten with brick 
WASIIINGTON -lie was dragged from his car and beaten with a brick after confronting an investment-company superior about trad­ing abuses in mutual funds, Peter Scannell told Congress Tuesday. 
His complaint about abuses was brushed aside by federal regulators but eventually helped lead to civil fraud charges against fund giant Putnam Investments. 
At the hearing where he testified on Tuesday, New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill., the head of a Senate panel, denounced what they called hidden and excessive fees that gouge millions of mutual fund investors. Spitzer also. said it is unfair that mutual funds charge ordi­nary shareholders much higher fees than pen­sion funds and other big investors. 
Fitzgerald called the fund industry "the world's largest skimming operation ... a trough from which fund managers, brokers and other insiders are steadily siphoning off an excessive slice of the nation's household, college and retirement savings." 
Putnam, meanwhile, announced that it would cut fees paid by shareholders and pro­vide investors more information on fees and fund managers' compensation.

CORPORATE SCANDAL 
Testimony begins in Stewart trial 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Martha Stewart sold stock based on "a secret tip" that no one else had, then told an avalanche of lies to save her reputation and enormous fortune, prosecutors said Tuesday as they laid out their case against the homemaking queen. 
Stewart's attorney insisted the case was based on "speculation, surmise and guesswork" and suggested the government's pursuit of the domestic style-setter was reminiscent of George Orwell's Big Brother novel "1984." 
The jury of eight women and four men listened to three hours of open­ing statements that outlined starkly different portrayals of Stewart's sale of nearly 4,000 shares of biotechnol­ogy company ImClone Systems on Dec. 27, 2001. 
The government contends Stewart, on her way to a vacation in Mexico, was tipped that ImClone founder Sam Waksal was trying to dump his shares, then ordered the sale of her own stock.

UNITED NATIONS 
Iraq team restores presence 
Team to help organize election and transition 
Associated Press 
PARIS-In agreeing Tuesday to send an election team to Iraq, 
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan took the first major step to rflstore his organization's influ­ence i11 the country. 
The prominent U.N. role ­helping resolve a dispute over the best way to transfer power to Iraqis -marks a significant reversal. Washington drew up its transition plan for Iraq last year without mentioning the United Nations; U.S. officials now see the world body as their best hope for a compromise. 
Annan said he would agree to a coalition and Governing Council request, made in a Jan. 19 meet­ing, that he dispatch the team to see whether a direct vote for a transitional government is possi­ble. 
He also suggested that a multi­national force could be deployed but ruled out the idea of U.N. peacekeepers in Iraq. Annan withdrew all international staff in October after deadly suicide bombings of U.N. headquarters in Baghdad. 
"I believe what we can antici­pate would be a multinational force authorized by the Security Council, which could h.elp and work with Iraqis to stabilize Iraq and make it safer," Annan said at a press conference with President Jacques Chirac. "This would be a multinational force, with the sup­port of the Security Council, and not 'blue helmets' per se." 
Staking out his independence from the coalition, Annan said he will seek out Iraqi opinions. 
"I strongly hold to the idea that the most sustainable way for­ward would be one that came from Iraqis themselves," the sec­retary-general said in a state­ment. 
Annan said the team will go to Iraq once the U.S. -led coalition assures its safety. In Baghdad, coalition spokesman Dan Senor welcomed Annan's decision and said the coalition would take "all necessary measures" to provide the U.N. team's security.

Secretary of State Colin Powell said Saturday he had been in touch with Annan almost every day recently and also met with Annan's special adviser, Lakhdar Brahimi.

Annan said the team would try to determine what alternatives there are if an election cannot be held. 
"I have already made clear that in my view there is no single 'right way,"' he said in Paris. 
Al-Sistani's call for direct elec­tions has been backed by tens of thousands of protesters, and the

A separate two-member U.N. security team went to Baghdad on Friday for talks with the coali­tion about the possible full return of U.N. employees. 
In Baghdad, Mahmoud Othman, a Kurdish member of the Iraqi Governing Council, called Annan's decision "a posi­tive one" and noted the Iraqi leadership had been urging a greater role for the United Nations. 


IRAN 

Election crisis leaves government in chaos 
Associated Press 

TEHRAN -Iran's president has refused to accept the mass resignation of top government officials, state-run media report­ed Tuesday. Reformists spoke of a compromise to resolve the country's worst political crisis in years. 
The crisis began Jan. 11 when the Guardian Council, a power­ful, unelected body that super­vises elections and approves legislation, disqualified more than a third of the 8,200 candi­dates registered for the Feb. 20 vote. That included more than 80 sitting lawmakers. 
Last week, the government announced that most of Iran's six vice presidents and 24 min­isters had tendered their resig­nations to protest the disqualifi­cations. They were not identi­fied, and the resignations need­ed President Mohammad Khatami's approval. 
Khatami, refusing to accept the resignations, called on the ministers and vice presidents to "proceed with their services to the people," according to the Islamic Republic News Agency. 
More than 70 top civil ser­vants also had threatened to resign if free and fair elections were not guaranteed. Khatami himself also had done so, but later said he would continue in his post. 
"Of course, we will insist on the need to hold a free and fair election as the symbol of democ­racy and make sure that the process will lead to a fair result," Khatami was quoted as saying. 
Top reformist and hard-line leaders met into early Tuesday to try to resolve the crisis. Parliament Speaker Mahdi Karroubi said four Cabinet min­isters had been assigned to investigate the disqualifications and reach a compromise with the Guardian Council, IRNA reported. 
The announcement was the frrst signal that the crisis, which has threatened to lead the coun­try toward political chaos, might be resolved soon. 
Karroubi announced that he, Khatami and the hard-line head of the Judiciary, Ayatollah Mahmoud Hasehmi Shahroudi, had met Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Monday evening. Khamenei has fmal say on all state matters and his direct intervention has in the past resolved deadlocks. 
The speaker said the Cabinet team, headed by Intelligence Minister Ali Yunesi, would meet with the Guardian Council in the next few days to "resolve the problem appropriately." 
State-run Tehran radio quot­ed Karroubi as saying that a compromise was in the making. 
"We will witness a good understanding between the gov­ernment and the Guardian Council in the next two days," Karroubi was quoted as saying. He said that by late afternoon Thursday, "some good news will be announced."

BRITAIN 
Blair narrowly wins key vote 
Associated Press 
LONDON -Prime Minister Tony Blair narrowly defeated a major rebellion within his gov­erning Labour Party on Tuesday, winning a key vote on university fees that severely tested his authority. 
Lawmakers voted 316-311 in favor of the legislation, offering Blair a welcome boost before Wednesday's publication of a report on the death of a weapons adviser, which added to a furor over the govern­ment's case for the Iraq war. 

Blair sat on the government front bench in the House of Commons as the result of the vote was announced to loud cheers from Labour lawmak­ers. 
Ministers had embarked on an intense last-minute cam­paign to win support for the bill, which is the centerpiece of Blair's legislative program. 
Many Labour lawmakers had viewed the proposals as a betrayal of a 1997 election promise that there would be no tuition hikes, and the bill crys­tallized party divisions over the direction of government policy. A defeat would have been Blair's first in Parliament since taking office in 1997. 
Clare Short, an outspoken critic of Blair since she quit the Labour government last year, said the bill on university fees was a "breach of trust with the electorate" and "very foolish politically." 
An early edition of Wednesday's Sun newspaper said it had obtained details of the report, saying it clears Blair of any dishonorable conduct, rebukes the Ministry of Defense for failing to let Kelly know that his name would come out, and harshly criticizes the BBC for failing to check facts before broadcasting its report. 
Under the bill approved Tuesday, universities would be able to charge students up to $5,500 a year, to be paid after they leave school and start earning wages. 
Colleges currently charge a flat-rate fee of $2,025 which is paid up front. The government says the increase would pr'ovide an extra $1.8 billion a year for higher education. 
Education Secretary Charles Clarke has also pledged schol­arships for poorer students and promised a system to help ensure that more people from working class backgrounds enter higher education. 
Clarke conceded that his authority and that of the prime minister had been on the line over the proposals to increase university fees. 
"I am delighted at the result," Clarke said. "Had we lost it would have been a very serious state of affairs." 
Tuesday's vote meant the bill passed its second reading, which is an agreement on its basic principles. It next goes before a committee of lawmak­ers who consider the legislation in detail and suggest possible changes before submitting it to a third reading in the Commons.

It would have been the perfect story. The headline would have read "McNabb Tells Rush to Hush." The opening lead would have begun, "If your definition of overrated is leading your team to the Super Bowl, than Donovan McNabb

happy endings. 
For the third straight year, the Philadelphia Eagles and their dynamic quarterback fell just short of reaching the Super Bowl in a devastating 17-3 NFC Championship loss to the upstart Carolina Panthers. In the post-game press conference, the downtrodden sig­nal caller -ever gracious in defeat ­refused to blame a blatant late hit in the first quarter that left his ribs bruised and battered for a sub-par performance and eventual removal from the game in the fourth quarter. 
Not to take anything away from the Panthers' decisive victory, but let's play the "what if' game. What if Carolina linebacker Greg Favors had not delivered a cheap shot to McNabb that left the quarterback writhing in pain? What if McNabb had a receiver with even aver­age speed? What if these receivers could actually catch the ball? Maybe the Eagles would be playing in the Super Bowl this Sunday instead of the Panthers. Maybe sports radio talk shows would not have been flooded with simple-minded callers this week claiming "Rush was right." And just maybe, McNabb would have silenced all of the doubt and the contro­versy that will unfairly haunt the rest of his career unless he wins a Super Bowl all because of some ignorant comments conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh made on ESPN's NFL Countdown a few months ago. 
"Unless" is the operative word in the previous sentence, as opposed to "until," because there are no guarantees in sports. At age 27 and through only five years in the NFL, McNabb has a lot of football ahead of him. As far as quarter­backs go, he is just now entering the prime of his career, but he may never again reach the NFC Championship and have an opportunity to play for a berth in the Super Bowl. Unfortunately, no other quarterback -not even the great Peyton Manning, who carries on his shoulders the stigma that he cannot win the big game-will have to endure the same degree of scrutiny and skepticism as McNabb on the grueling quest toward a coveted Lombardi Trophy. 
We all remember a few months back when Limbaugh claimed that despite having lead Philadelphia to two consecu­tive NFC Championship games, McNabb was highly overrated and that his sparkling reputation on the field was undeserved. 
The mouth that refuses to quit went on to say that the "liberal left-winged" sports media had a hidden agenda to laud McNabb and other African­American quarterbacks even if their play on the field did not merit such high praise. 
Sadly, Limbaugh's co-hosts on the pop­ular pre-game show that included ex­NFL stars Tom Jackson, Michael Irving and Steve Young-all of whom seeming­ly would have more expertise on the game of football -remained silent, not offering a single word of protest to dis­pute the absurd accusations. In response to a storm of criticism, ESPN fired Limbaugh a few days later. The net­work's shameless efforts to bring in a polarizing news figure to drive up their television ratings had backfired. 
Whether or not one agreed with ESPN's decision to axe Limbaugh is real­ly beside the point. Limbaugh's com­ments were unquestionably dumb and downright insensitive, but the remarks in and of themselves do not make him a racist. He is certainly entitled to his own opinions, but this does not make him above any potential backlash for expressing them. The real lesson to be learned here is that ESPN never should have hired Limbaugh in the first 

place. He is a political pundit,

Truth be told, Limbaugh had as much business being on ESPN as actor Sean Penn did traveling to Iraq a little over a year ago as a self-appointed American ambassador. When Penn returned home warning the American people if the United States went to war against Saddam Hussein that the blood would be on our hands, not the homicidal dicta­tor's, the actor deservedly had to suffer some consequences for his stupidity. Even some Hollywood big shots of all people found Madonna's ex-husband a little too extreme for their taste. Penn sued producer Steven Bing claiming he lost a role in the film "Why Men Shouldn't Marry" for his outspoken oppo­sition against the war in Iraq. Bing coun­tered claiming Penn was irresponsible and irrational. Really? 

Sean Penn is a critically acclaimed actor paid to entertain. not to make polit­ical commentaries and petty remarks about President Bush. "Mystic River" and his latest movie, "21 Grams," are, according to movie critics, two of the best movies from 2003. Each might haul in some Academy Awards this March, and Penn might even win the category for Best Actor. Perhaps it is my loss. but I am not going to see either of these movies any time soon. Why should I put money in this guy's pocket and hear him bash my country? For that matter, I will not be listening to Rush Limbaugh, either, after he carelessly sabotaged McNabb's career.

LEITERS TO THE EDITOR 
Debating the merits of affirmative action 
Benefits are misdirected 
As someone who has worked as a tutor for the one of the SAT services Andrea de Vries men­tioned in her Jan. 27 letter, I was absolutely astounded by her claim that such services can be bought to improve scores by hundreds of points. I had never heard of that before. As a matter of fact, we routinely inform stu­dents. many of whom are des­perate for such a fantastic bounce, that such results are astronomically unlikely, and that it is far more realistic to expect an improvement of 50 points or less. There is no system I know which can take someone from a 1000 score to a 1500. I would like Andrea to provide some names, for otherwise it is pretty clear that she made the claim up herself. 
Aside from the SAT, however, I found it interesting how she avoided the other arguments altogether. Greg Parnell indicat­ed, in his Jan. 26 column, for instance, that poor whites per­form better academically than middle-class blacks (this is well­documented in the works of John Ogbu and Abigail Thernstrom), yet for Andrea it is all still just a matter of socioeconomic class. 
The issUI(of class, it seems to " me, is quite prone to exploita­tion. especially when discussing the black community. I live down the street from a massive subsi­dized housing project, inhabited solely by blacks (llispanics and others do not dare live there). lwrc in Annapolis. I suspect everyone there would be classi­fied as impoverished. by American standards. 
Yet, if you visited, you would sec lots of cell phones, cars with bizarre and costly modifications, very expensive footwear, extraordinary obesity and wide­spread usc of walkmans and cig­arettes. Empty beer and liquor bottles and potato-chip bags lie everywhere; drug arrests and shootings are almost weekly events. None of this suggests to me an inability to afford books, or tutors if needed. I doubt the projects of Annapolis are unique; 
If I could suggest reasons why children from these communities do so poorly in school and on standardized tests, it would not be because there is no money for them. As Parnell pointed out, immigrant children frequently excel with far less than these have. No, the reasons are more likely dysfunctional families, crime and total immersion in a crude pop culture wholly incom­patible with anything like responsibility or scholarship. Pumping 50 Cent into your ears all day will keep you from ever learning at all. 
Throwing money at the black community to assuage our feel­ings of guilt is what has created the culture of the projects, where so many blacks languish. To suggest that the solution is to throw even more money at it is ignorant and pathetic. Yes, those blacks are victims, but not vic­tims of racism. They are victims of patronizing whites who would rather exacerbate the problem and feel good about themselves than actuaUy face the problem and help solve it. 
By the way, research also shows that poor blacks are rarely the ones who benefit from affirmative action -sadly, none of the kids up the street are get­ting pulled into Harvard, I can guarantee. No, it is the middle­class black children who are outperformed by lower-class whites -these are the ones get­ting into the schools of their choice. Nor do I blame them-I would underperform too, if I knew I would be rewarded for it anyway.

EDITORIAL CARTOON 

Minorities deserve to attend Notre Dame 
After reading Greg Parnell's Jan. 26 col­umn, I was disturbed by the images it por­trays of African-Americans. Parnell's myopic view of the race issue in America is as igno­rant as it is wrong. Yes, there are minorities enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities with lower scores than their white counter­parts. But there are also whites enrolled in 
U.S. colleges and universities with lower scores than their minority counterparts. Why did you not also single them out? What about alumni, athletes, females and Catholics? Please believe that MIT-caliber students have been denied admL>sion to this university, to admit Joe Quarterback and Sam Legacy. I do not see you protesting their presence. Then why protest mine? 
I am hurt by your comment that immi­grants "face even harsher disadvantages" than the ones African-Americans "claim" to face. By traveling to a foreign land, immi­grants should expect to have a difficult time adjusting·. This discomfort is purely a func­tion of displacement. Anyone who moves from his or her homeland to a foreign place is going to face certain barriers in order to survive in that new society. 
But we are not foreigners. We were born here, and yet there still exist barriers to our success. That is a problem. I agree with you that immigrants do not expect the country to conform to their ways and customs. They should not; they are foreigners. This is not their homeland. Yet what can be said for African-Americans? This country was built on the sweat and blood off our ancestors' brows. Yet we still cannot live without the impending threat of ignorant whites who are oblivious to their privilege demeaning our successes as handouts and our failures as a character of our blackness. 
Though their hands are no longer bound in chains, African-Americans still do not reap the benefits of what "being an American" means, even now, almost 500 years after that first slave ship left Africa. We are not clinging to the past, as you claim in your article. The past is clinging to us. We did not create the system of inequality that has per­meated the social landscape of this nation since its founding. Yet we have been adversely affected by it ever since. 
Affirmative action's goal is to rectify this imbalance. It does not, as you say, "lower the merit bar so that they [African-Americans) can compete." By law, as written in execu­tive orders and interpreted by the courts, to benefit from affirmative action, one must have relevant and valid job or educational qualifications. Therefore, affirmative action's goal in college admissions is to bring stu­dents who are both equipped academically and can contribute to the diversity of the campus. Each student has a gift to bring. Do not for one second think that you are more entitled to be here than any minority, simply based upon your high school scores. In the essence of diversity, minorities are a valued presence on college campuses because of first their intelligence and second their unique perspective. 
Lastly, you say "Racial minorities are not less qualified, talented or capable than the majority," but you end stating, "Minority groups can only advance after accepting that the means to progress is by increasing their own merit, not robbing it from others." You just contradicted yourself. If the merit is equally distributed among races, as you first claim, then there is nothing to be increased; there is nothing to be robbed. There is only that which ceases to be acknowledged. As a program, that is what affirmative action does. It acknowledges the value of minority groups in this nation that have historically been suppressed by the overwhelming white majority. 
I leave you with one last thought: I resent your claim that African-Americans are "agi­tating the system, demanding reparations and relying on pity in order to achieve." I am sure that there are students who applied to Notre Dame and had better scores than you, but were denied. Does that mean you got a handout? Then why, as an African­American, did I? If you think there are African-Americans on this campus that are unqualified to be here, I challenge you to talk to them. 
I know I would be more than happy to tell you why I deserve to be here. 
Rhea Boyd sophomore Lewis Hall Jan. 27 

White guilt pervades 
This letter is in regards to Greg Parnell's Jan. 26 column, "Acting out against affirmative action." Mr. Parnell should familiarize him­self with the notion of"white guilt" as coined by Stanford professor Shelby Steele. 
Due to the historical and cultural force of slavery and its dark aftermath (where just 40 years ago black men were still being hung from trees). we are forced to examine the painful truth of how entrenched we are in the race debate and how the hateful ghosts of our heritage continue to plague our institutions -universities included. 
In the age of white guilt, universities are compelled to prove that they are not racist by expounding statistical evidence that they admit a high percentage of minorities. Trying to prove what you are not is futile, but it is a consequence of our painful, segregated past. Neither genie lamps nor reparations will make up for the injustices thrust upon blacks in this country, but healthy, accurate and sensi­tive debate are fair starting grounds. 
Speaking from the privileged halls of one of the whitest campuses in the United States, Parnell abuses the thrust of Martin Luther King's message, compares affirmative action to professional basket­ball and offers no significant evidence that non-white immigrants are more succesful than blacks. Shame on The Observer for abusing the beauty of King's message by placing his image as the centerpiece of Mr. Parnell's insensitive article.

Go on a date with Tad Hamilton 
Pete (Topher Grace) meets his competition (Josh Duhamel) for the heart of Rosalee Futch (Kate Bosworth) In the comedy "Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!"

taneously flashing back to those unforgettable initial moments throughout the remainder of the film. 
From Robert Luketic, who directed Legally Blonde, comes the feel-good romantic comedy Wzn a Date with Tad Hamilton!. Kate Bosworth of Blue Crush plays Rosalee Futch, a small town Piggly Wiggly cashier who hopes to someday meet famous Hollywood beefcake Tad Hamilton who is played by Josh Duhamel. Rosalee enters an online contest to win a dream date with hunky Tad, despite numerous sarcastic remarks supplied by her manager Pete and largely unfavorable odds. Topher Grace of "That '70s Show" is Pete, a highly regarded Piggly Wiggly manager who has been offered a great new job in the city, but needs to make known his long held secret feelings for Rosalee before he makes the move. 
Rosalee is the lucky winner of the online contest and flies out to

This "resonates" with Tad and he decides to spend some more time with Rosalee so that he can figure out how to find fulfillment in his life. Tad arrives at the Piggly Wiggly just as Pete is about to make his feelings known, and thus begins the love trian­gle which Win A Date revolves around. 
Deciding how things should play out in Win a Date is not as easy as in most chick flicks because Tad isn't the typi­cal shady hot guy. Audience members will be torn between sexy Tad and endearing Pete. Sean Hayes of "Will and Grace" has a supporting role, so "Will and Grace" fans should be sure to check out Win a Date.

Too frequently, a great novel is con­torted on the silver screen to fit the desires of the Hollywood business. But that is not the case with Cold Mountain, a modern classic based on the 1997 bestselling novel by Charles Frazier (his first). Directed by Academy-Award win­ner Anthony Minghella (The English Patient, The Talented Mr. Ripley). the film has already garnered seven Academy Award nominations, including best actor and best actress. 
Although there are a couple minor characters and scenes left out in order to further develop the story, the movie stays true to the book's original inter­twining and heart­

Donald Sutherland, and Natalie Portman top the impressive list. 
Set in the latter days of the Civil War, the story tells of a wounded Confederate soldier, Inman (Jude Law), who seeks to return to Cold Mountain, North Carolina to his love, Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), a young educated woman who is struggling to adjust to farm life after growing up in the city of Charleston. Although somewhat drawn out, the movie has flashbacks and parallels their lives as they both struggle with their personal journeys. Wounded and realiz­ing that he would soon go back to the front lines, Inman decides to desert and to make the long return to Cold Mountain, the place he sees as a para­dise after witnessing the horrors of war. 
During this time, Ada is taking care of her father, Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland), who had moved with her to Cold Mountain in hopes that the fresh air would help his tuberculosis. After his death, she is left on her own and begins her own adventure of sorts in trying to survive. It is at this time that a mountain girl named Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger) arrives at the Monroe farm to help Ada. 
While on his journey back, Inman

One of the first persons he meets is Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a former town official who travels with Inman for a time. Later on, Inman meets Sara (Natalie Portman), a yoJ.lng widower and mother who longs for a man. Back in Cold Mountain, Ruby and Ada work together on the farm and are aided by Sally Swanger (Kathy Baker), but they encounter several hardships mostly caused by Teague (Ray Winstone), a bit­ter bounty hunter. Later they are joined by Ruby's father, Stobrod (Brendon Gleeson), with his band that features Georgia (Jack White of the White Stripes in his acting debut). The movie contin­ues in this alternating sequence, which adds to the uniqueness of the war and romance tale. 
As Inman nears Cold Mountain, he and Ada grow spiritually. together in. their hopes of the war's en<;i and their being together. This all -leads to an awakening conclusion that brings forth both tears and smiles. 
Cold Mountain is one of the best works of cinematography in recent memory and it is fitting that it is based on one of the most acclaimed modern novels. One may think of the story as a hybrid of Saving Private Ryan and Gone With The Wind because it exposes the bloody anguish and suffering of the Civil War while it discloses the longing for love and peace between individuals.

O'Brien resigns

O'Neal to return to action today 
Associated Press 
EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -Shaquille O'Neal went through a light practice Tuesday and might play in the Los Angeles Lakers' next game after missing the last 12. 
"I feel pretty good. We didn't really run that long," O'Neal said. "Hopefully, I can play tomorrow. If not, hopefully I can play Friday night. I'm a little winded. I can still do damage out there." 
The Lakers (26-15) host Seattle on Wednesday and Minnesota on Friday. 
Karl Malone, meanwhile, isn't expected to return until after the All-Star break, so he will probably miss another nine games with a right knee injury. 
O'Neal has been sidelined since straining his right calf Jan. 2 in the second quarter of a 111-109loss at Seattle. 
lie missed two games in late November because of a similar injury. 

O'Neal was examined Tuesday morning by a team doctor and cleared to practice. 
"We had to kind of twist the doctor's arm to get him out here to run full-court," Lakers coach Phil Jackson said .. 
"He looked fine -he was light on his feet. We didn't run too hard.

appeared at the news confer­
ence with one of the team's 
owners, Wyc Grousbeck, was 
also trying to add more 
offense to the team, while 
O'Brien had always placed a 
heavy emphasis on defense. 
"He was not sure he's the 
man for that job ... he didn't 
want to take our money and 
our time under false pretens­
es," Grousbeck said. 
Ainge, who said he was 
surprised by O'Brien's deci­
sion, also said he had had dif­
ferences with O'Brien over 
whether to play some of the 
older players on the team. 
"We felt that there was a 
ceiling on the success of the 
old players ... so we did not 
always agree on the players 
who should be on the court," 
Ainge said.

A call placed to O'Brien's 
agent, Lonnie Cooper, wasn't 
immediately returned. 
The Celtics are 22-24 after 
reaching the playoffs the past 
two seasons. 
O'Brien's resignation came one day after Byron Scott was fired as coach of the New Jersey Nets, the only team ahead of Boston in the Atlantic Division. 
The Celtics lost five of their 
last seven games, including a 
110-91 setback at New Jersey 
on Sunday. Boston trailed by 
17 at halftime and sank just 
36 percent of its shots for the 
game. In those last five loss­
es, star Paul Pierce, who has­
n't gotten much offensive 
help, made just 27 percent of 
his shots. 
Since being hired, Ainge has made numerous changes, trading Antoine Walker to Dallas before the season and Eric Williams and Tony Battie to Cleveland on Dec. 15. The first deal deprived the Celtics of a second scoring threat to go along with Pierce. The second took away two veter­an leaders and keys to O'Brien's defense-oriented approach. 
Ainge, hired May 9, gave O'Brien a two-year contract extension running through the 2005-06 season. Before granting the extension, how­ever, Ainge met with O'Brien and considered potential replacements among current college coaches, pro assis­tants, retired players and for­mer NBA coaches. 
O'Brien became coach when Rick Pitino resigned in January 2001. He took the Celtics to the Eastern Conference fmals in 2002 and the conference semifinals in 2003.

-NHL 
Thrashers' winger Heatley returns tonight 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -Dany Heatley's quick return to the ice couldn't come at a better time for the Atlanta Thrashers. 
The star right wing plans to play Wednesday night for the first time since surviving a car wreck in September that killed teammate Dan Snyder and left Heatley with serious injuries. 
His scheduled return against St. Louis at home will cap a recovery from two torn knee lig­aments and a 
"It's nice to help, but at the same time, that has no bearing on whether I was ready to play or I wasn't ready to play." Heatley said. "It's going to be fun to get going in the middle of a playoff run." 
Coach Bob Hartley and Heatley decided on the move after practice Tuesday. Heatley skated for the first time follow­ing surgery on Dec. 23, then joined his teammates in a pregame skate about 10 days 
ago. 
"I've seen Dany

knee. 
"I met with the doctors Saturday for about the 17th time about his status," Thrashers general manager Don Waddell said Tuesday. "They assured us he was 100 percent." 
After leading the Southeast Division for much of the season, Atlanta has dropped to second place, six points behind Tampa Bay. The Thrashers were tied for ninth in the Eastern Conference with the New York Rangers entering play Tuesday night, four points behind the eighth and final playoff spot. 
[Wednesday] night

from now won't make his knee any stronger." 
Heatley was charged with vehicular homicide after Snyder died from head injuries. Test results showed Heatley con­sumed a small amount of alco­hol before the crash, with his blood alcohol content less than 
0.015 percent, below Georgia's legal limit of 0.08 percent. 
Because Heatley wasn't drunk and Snyder's relatives said they forgave him, prosecutors could decide the crash was an acci­dent, with no need to pursue 
felony charges. which carry sentences from three to 15 years. 
The case remains under investigation and a final deci­sion on charges has not been made, Erik Friedly, a spokesman for the Fulton County district attorney, said Tuesday. · 
Heatley hasn't played since the season finale last season, a 6-2 victory over the Lightning. He had two goals and an assist in that one. 
''I'm coming into this like a regular game last year," Heatley said. "I want to play. There's going to be some rust, but I feel like I'm ready to go." 
"It's been a long time. I'm anxious to get out there." 
The Thrashers won't work Heatley in slowly. He'll resume his spot on one of the top lines and log a Jot of ice time. 
Heatley was the MVP of last year's All-Star game and fin­ished as the ninth-leading scor­er in the NHL with 89 points. In 2002, he was the NHL Rookie of the Year. 
"There's no doubt when you have a player of his stature on the bench, he's going to play," Waddell said. "He's not a player that's going to play 10 minutes a game. Once you put him _back on the bench, the coach is going to play him as he normally would." 
That his return came so 

quickly seems very surprising. Other players in different sports generally miss an entire season after similar injuries, and Waddell initially expected Heatley to miss four to six months. But Heatley started his rehab three days after surgery and beat every timetable throughout.

Tribe's Tadano sorry for gay pornography 


Auociated Press 
CLEVElAND -Indians minor lt~aguer Kazuhito Tadano is asking for forgiveness for what he called a one-time mistake ­his appearance in a gay porn video in which he engaged in a homosexual act. 
Tadano took part in the video three years ago when he was a college student. Sitting in the Chweland clubhouse Tuesday, the pitcher said he hoped to put his actions in the past. 
"All of us have made mistakes in our lives," Tadano said, read­ing a statement in English. "I lopefully, you learn from them and move on." 
Shunned by Japanese base­ball teams. the 23-year-old Tadano signed with the Indians last March. They think he can make their club this spring. 
Tadano gave few details about the video. which he made after his sophomore year at Hikkyo University. 
"I did participate in a video and I regret it very much," he said. "It was a one-time inci­dent that showed bad judgment and will never be repeated. I was young, playing baseball, and going to college and my mature and had really thought about the implications of what I did, it never would have hap­pened." 
teammates  and  I  needed  
money.  
"Frankly,  if I were  more  

Through an interpreter, Tadano added: ''I'm not gay. I'd like to clear that fact up right now." 
Tadano's admission will cer­tainly draw attention to homo­sexuality in baseball, a sensitive issue that most players prefer to not even discuss. 
In 2002, All-Star catcher Mike Piazza felt the need to hold a press conference to profess his heterosexuality after a newspa­per gossip columnist suggested that one of the New York Mets' top players was gay. 
There are no op~nly gay play­ers in the llig leagues today. The same is true in the NFL, NHL and NBA. 
Tadano was one of Japan's top college pitchers and expect­ed to be a high first-round pick in 2002. But after a Japanese tabloid published photos of him in the video a month before the draft, pro teams in Japan did not select him. 
"The commissioner of Japanese baseball came out and said, 'You will not draft Tadano,'" asserted the pitcher's agent. Alan Nero. "But this kid didn't assault anybody. He did­n't commit murder." 

WOMEN'5 AUSTRALIA OPEN -
Clijsters earns semis spot 
Associated Press 
MELBOURNE, Australia ­Kim Clijsters aggravated an ankle injury in her Australian Open quarterfinal victory over Anastasia Myskina on Wednesday, leaving the sec­ond-seeded Belgian star ques­tionable for the semifinals. 
Clijsters, a semifinalist in all four majors last season but still without a Grand Slam title, beat Myskina 6-2, 7-6 (9) to set up a semifinal match against Patty Schnyder of Switzerland. 
Schnyde~ seeded 22nd, advanced to her first Grand Slam semifinal with a 7-5 (2), 6-3 victory over Lisa Raymond. 
Clijsters lost the first four games of the second set against Myskina and needed a medical timeout for her left ankle after holding in the fifth. 
"I'll have to see how it reacts," Clijsters said. 
''I'm going to have a week off after this anyway, so I might as well go for it and give myself a shot. But, on the other hand, if I can't walk tomorrow, it's stupid to go out there." 
Clijsters won five of the next six games after getting court­side treatment in the second set and had two match points on the sixth-seeded Myskina's serve in the 12th before the Russian held to force a tiebreaker. 
Clijsters had three more match points in the tiebreaker and saved two set points before the match in 90 min­utes when Myskina's back­hand shot drifted wide. 
Clijsters, who injured her left ankle at the Hopman Cup and was sidelined for two weeks leading into the tourna­ment, said she'd ice her ankle,

MEN'5 AUSTRALIA OPEN 
-. 
Associated Press 
MELBOURNE, Australia ­Andy Roddick was gone by the time the crowd began serenad­ing Marat Safin with "Happy Birthday." 
Roddick smashed his racket and headed off the court, losing his shot at an Australian Open title and his No. 1 ranking, too. 
He was beaten 2-6, 6-3, 7-5, 6-7 (0), 6-4 Tuesday by Satin in the quarterfinals, falling to a player ranked 86th who limped and winced, called for the train­er and needed a painkiller to make it through the match. 
But Satin delivered an unmis­takable statement on his 24th birthday: He is back on his game after upsetting the reign­ing U.S. Open champion. 
"People think of Marat and they think of temperamental," Roddick said. 
"He is all those things, but at the same time when it comes down to it, he wants to win and he's competitive." 
The Russian's performance was not lost on the stadium crowd, which admired his grit and heart and was in full voice after a victory that sent Safin into the semifinals against Andre Agassi. 
"I can't ask for anything else," said Satin, the 2000 U.S. Open champion. "It's probably the best birthday I ever had, espe­cially when 15,000 people are singing." 
Agassi, the defending champi­on, practically had the day off. He advanced when ninth-seeded Sebastien Grosjean retired after 10 games with a recurring groin strain. Agassi was leading 6-2, 2-0. 
On the women's side, No. 32 Fabiola Zuluaga of Colombia had it even easier. No. 4 Amelie Mauresmo, the 1999 Australian Open runner-up, forfeited to Zuluago because of an injured back muscle. · 
She was in tears after hitting for 10 minutes and deciding she injured left wrist. There was some question if he would ever return to tennis' elite. 
On Tuesday, he appeared in trouble early as Roddick zipped through the first set in 26 min­utes. 
In the second set, Safin clutched his upper left leg after halfheartedly chasing a passing shot in the opening game.

Safin broke Roddick in the ninth game of the deciding set and then faced two break points serving for the match. 
He saved one with an ace, Roddick dumped a return into the net, and Safin finished things off with an overhead. 
"The most important thing is: I'm back," Satin said. 
Satin has spent more than 15 hours on court and disposed of four Americans in five matches -Brian Vahaly, Todd Martin, James Blake and Roddick. 
Agassi hasn't dropped a set and is on a 26-match winning streak at Melbourne Park that started with his second title in 2000. 
With Grosjean's default, Agassi gets extra rest for Satin. Still, he was not happy about the way he advanced.

Brady not fazed by the spotlight

Associated Press

HOUSTON -The XFL's bold­est name is playing well on the NFL's biggest stage. 
The media magnet? He Hate Me, of course. 
The obscure running back with the unforgettable monick­er is making the Super Bowl his biggest marketing coup. Rod Smart's mischievous, stub­bled face was one of the most photographed Tuesday on media day. 
He was hoping something like this could happen three years ago when, in a moment of inspiration, he made a name for himself and became the symbol of an anti-establish­ment league.

HOUSTON -Tom Brady sidestepped questions about his love life, his politics and the Carolina Panthers. 
But he couldn't get away from "Pick Boy." 
Wearing an orange cape and green tighl'i, the pseudo super­hero quizzed Brady on such issues as helmet hair and why football players often pat each other on their backsides. The Patriots' quarterback answered whimsically before turning his attention back to football. 
But only for a moment. Then it was back to his picks in the New Hampshire primary. 
"After today, it gets more normal. Then you get ready and prepare to play," Brady said from his perch at Reliant Stadium, where on Sunday he will try to lead New England to its second NFL title in three years. "After today, things will start settling down a little bit." 
But first: media day, the Super Bowl's spectacle of silli­ness held on the Tuesday before the championship game on the field where it will be played. Although the event always draws more than its share of actual sports reporters. it's the others who make it unlike any other news conference in sports. 
Brady's sudden success and boyish good looks made him a superstar in Boston. 
"You know. he's got it. He's got the charisma and the fatal charm, but he is a great leader, too," linebacker Ted Johnson said. "He gets it done at work, and that's the main thing: He comes to work." 
And he's pretty good once he gets there. 
Brady is 34-12 in the regular season as a starter -the best winning percentage of any active quarterback. 
He is an unblemished 7-0 in overtime games and 5-0 in the playoffs. 
He has led the Patriots to vic­tory 14 times when they were losing or tied after the start of the fourth quarter. 
"I think we're fortunate to have him, for what he does on the field and the respect he has in the locker room," Patriots owner Robert Kraft said .."He's clean-cut, and every female I know would like to have a connection with him. With all his notoriety and foot­ball skills, he's a star who doesn't want to be a star." 
That's one thing Brady hasn't been able to control. 
"You want to go to the movies. You want to have fun. You want to run around like

assists per game). Batteast has stepped up her play in Big East games, as she averages 17.2 points and 9.8 rebounds in those contests. 
But the Irish have only won two road games this season, and Miami presents a significant obstacle, as they are undefeated at home. The Irish must defend well if they want to win, but it will be more than a challenge. 
"We don't matchup well with them in man-to-man, and I don't know if we do in zone either," McGraw said.

"We're confi­dent," McGraw said. "We feel like we're able to win on the

one, 175 pound cornerback, because they will take a chance on any remaining prospects who could possibly help turn a struggling program around. 
It was obvious over the last few weeks that Tyrone Willingham and Notre Dame wanted Baker, but it is even more obvious that Baker wants Notre Dame. 
"The school was a great fit for me," Baker said. "There are great people on the team. I like the players. I like the atmos­phere. I like the overall demeanor of the people [on campus]." 
Baker hails from Bishop Chatard High School. where he played with present Notre Dame freshman baseball player and pitcher Mike Dury, a for­mer quarterback. 
Baker said Tuesday night that he is looking forward to attend­ing Notre Dame, in particular because of the leadership he will have. 
"Coach [Tyrone] Willingham is a very positive person," Baker said. "He's going to push me to be the best studenVath­lete I can be." 
Baker's concern with academ­ics definitely had something to do with his commitment to the Irish. though the high school senior's main concern is still football. 
"I know I have a lot of work to do," he said. 'Til have the chal­lenge of playing with such great players, and I'll have to com­pete. It'll be a lot of fun, com­peting against and playing with guys like [Justin] Tuck and [Victor] Abiamiri."

MEN'S BASKETBALL 

Miami visits Joyce Center tonight 
By MATT LOZAR Associale Sports Edi1or 

Irish coach Mike Brey knew back in September that the schedule would be difficult. He anticipated his team would have to bounce back at least once this season from a game like Sunday's loss to Kentucky. 
But right now, the Irish can't focus on getting a win against one of the top teams in the country, but they can take care of business in games they should win -especially with a 9-6 record. 
Tonight against Miami (13-6, 3-2 in the Big East) is one of those games. 
"We can't talk about another ranked team, we have to be ready to play Miami," Brey said. "Our group has been pretty resilient. I've said that from day one. And they are going to have to con­tinue to be resilient. That could be a theme for us, how they have to bounce back." 
After another frustrating loss Sunday, the Irish talked about carrying over their second-half effort against the Wildcats into tonight's game against the Hurricanes. tice. 
Brey said he didn't have any ideas for At this point, the Irish are willing to try getting the Irish to play at the top of their anything. game for 40 minutes at home, so he fig­"I don't think you can really talk about ured maybe an early-morning team so much as put it into action in practice," meeting would keep this team focused around the clock, and not just at prac-see CANES/page 25

Big East road games momentous 
By HEATHER VAN HOEGARDEN 
Spons Wri1er  
Anytime a Big East team plays a con­ 
ference game on the road, it's almost  
guaranteed to be a battle. Tonight's  
game is no different for the Irish, as  
they travel to face conference leader  
No. 18 Miami (16-1, 5-1 in the Big  
East).  
"At this point, every game is a big  
game for us," Irish coach Muffet  
McGraw said.  
The Irish (11-7, 4-2), come off a big  
home victory over Villanova 38-36, a  
win that was key i·n the Big East.  
Villanova knocked off Miami Jan. 7 at  
Villanova 58-55. But the Hurricanes will  
be ready for the Irish.  
"Miami is a great team, extremely  
athletic, and they have two really good  
players Tamara James and Chanivia  
Broussard," McGraw said.  
CHIP MARKSfThe ObserverJames (16.3 points, 4.8 rebounds per Center Jacqueline Batteast leads the

Weather forces postponement 
By BOBBY GRIFFIN Spor!S Wriler 
Saint Mary's was supposed to travel to Albion Tuesday night for an MIAA league game, but Mother Nature seemed to have other plans. 
Albion College, located in Albion, Mich., was hit with the same snowstorm seen in South Bend, and the match­up between Saint Mary's and Albion was cancelled. A game that was supposed to tip off at 7p.m. Tuesday night will now take place tonight at 5:30pm. 
The Belles, who found out about the cancellation this morning, were not all that surprised. 
"We kinda figured," junior Emily Creachbaum said. 
The Belles used the post­poned game to their advan­tage, practicing Tuesday evening to better prepare for the Albion squad (14-4) who earlier this year defeated the Belles 51-40 on Saint Mary's home court. 
"We worked on the press break," Creachbaum said. "We got some shots up." 
Nothing about the cancella­tion changed the Belles' atti­tude going into tomorrow night. The Belles are still coming off a solid win against Tri-State. They will look to continue to play the good basketball that has been characteristic of late. 
"We have to play our game and finish our shots," Creachbaum said. "We have been working hard, [but we haven't been] winning." 
The Belles are looking to change that tonight and gath­er some momentum to finish out the rest of the season. Back to back wins would be something the Belles have not seen since Dec. 12 and Dec. 5 when they defeated Andrews and Illinois College. The Belles looked dominant in those wins, beating Andrews 72-26 and Illinois College 82­67. 

"I think if we get a win [against] Albion, our confi­dence will go up," Creachbaum said. "I know we can beat these teams." 
This positive attitude will be important if the Belles are to escape with an upset win tomorrow night. Albion has been tough all season, espe­cially at home where they are 
7-1. Saint Mary's,  on  the  
other hand, is 2-6  on  the  
road.  

Coming off a 26-point, 10­rebound game against Tri­State, Creachbaum's contin­ued solid play will be impor­tant for the Belles. This, com­bined with a minimum amount of turnovers, could spell an upset road win for Saint Mary's.

FOOTBALL RECRUITING 

Baker joins Irish, as does Ferrine 
By PAT LEONARD 
Spons Wri ler 
A week remains and the slow-starting Irish are crawl­ing their way to Feb. 4 player by player. 
Defensive end Ryan Baker from Indianapolis gave a ver­bal commitment to the Irish Sunday night, though the announcement was kept under the radar. Confirming the beliefs of ESPN recruiting ana­lyst Tom Lemming, cornerback Leo Ferrine from New Jersey committed Sunday, as well. 
Notre Dame has sixteen commitments with a week remaining before signing day, but not many of the players are in the top tier of heavily recruited players. Baker is also not in the top tier, but he is as close as any remaining player the Irish will find. 

Oklahoma, Michigan, Boston College and Purdue were all after the 6-foot-6, 225 pound strongside defensive end, rated 11th at his position on Rivals100.com. It was down to Notre Dame and Purdue after Baker's official visit to South Bend on Jan. 16, and the Boilermakers had an advan­tage in that they had shown more interest. 
"Notre Dame wasn't after Baker as early or often as Purdue," Irish Insider colum­nist Mike Frank said. "(Baker's decision] was a matter of ask­ing 'how much do they want 
?'"
