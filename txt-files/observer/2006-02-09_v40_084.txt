Controversial film event to begin 
Showings to be called 'Gay and Lesbian Film: Filmmakers, Narratives and Spectatorship' 
By MARY KATE MALONE A.sista111 Nows Editor 
Two wonks after University l'rnsidnnt Father .John Jnnkins questioned thn presencn of controversial events on cam­pus i n a s e r i e s oI' maj o r addresses to tho Notre Dame community, tlw nvnnt formerly known as tho <)uenr Film F1~stival will begin today under a nnw name -garnering national media attention and sl.irring student activism. 
"Gay and Lesbian Film: Filmmakers, Narratives and Spnctatorship" is the new title for the annual film event 1~ntcring its third year at the University. In his addresses to students, faculty and alumni, Jnnkins said the event's previ­ous title seemed "to celebrate homosexual activity." 
"When, year after year, we sponsor something or a unit of the University sponsors some­thing that appears to be in conllict with Catholic teaching, the University's name is used in such a way that it seems to support that which it doesn't support. It's more [about! authenticity of character and its representation," Jenkins told The Observer following the addresses. 
The Queer Film Festival was renamed after months of meet­ings between various groups connected to the event. 
"The new name was agreed upon by all parties involved, which included student organ­izers, the department of Film, Television and Theatre I FTTJ and the University administra­tion," event eo-chair Martin Laina said. 
Those parties are all satis­fied with thP. name, Laina said. 
But the event's content and purpose as an academic endeavor have not changed, Laina said, adding the new name is not nearly as impor­tant as the evP.nt itself. 
"The title accurately reflects the aims and purposes of the event, which are to showcase

l'rnsenting tlwir constituents' vinws while articulating their own, senators grapplnd with thn complex topic of acadnmie frnn­dom and Catholic character at Wndnnsday's Student Snnate m1mting -a discussion meant to prnparn thn group for an upeoming visit from University Pn~sident Fathnr .John .Jnnkins.

Panel discusses jazz, hip-hop's reflection of black culture 
whether jazz was a force for social change. 
"It was Ia l'orce for social change I in a few respects," Dwyer said. "For one, it did bring white and black musi­cians together to play music together." 
Nearly one quarter of Hillin Holiday's accompanying musi­cians were white in the 1!J40s. Black and white jazz musicians got tognther for jam snssions, even though laws forbade them from doing so publicly, Dwyer said. 
Wilson disagreed with Dwyer's point.

The portrayal of hip-hop artists in contemporary society and the progression of music genres that reflect the progres­sion of black culture were the topics of discussion Wednesday 
evening  in  the  Hesburgh  
Center  for  International  
Studies.  
"Fight  the  Power:  The  

Evolution of Music in African­American Culture" was spon­sored by Shades of Ebony and the Department of Africana Studies. It included a panel comprised of Ivy Wilson, assis­
tant professor of English; Larry Dwyer, Notre Dame's director of jazz studies; Alvin Tillery, associate professor of political science; and Hichard Pierce, associate history professor and Afrieana studies department chair. 
Jazz and hip-hop were the two music genres that received the most attention, though the discussion involved the entire history of black music and cul­ture. 
"You literally could look at black music as a soundtrack to black history," Wilson said. 
After quick introductions and opening statements, the panel dove right into the question of

Cheap seats 
I'm known for a Jot of things, but among my college friends two stand out: my penchant for free crap and my tendency to be absolutely random. 
My roommates -one of whom hap­pens to be the mail lady for our Nicole Zook building -have often commented on the multitude 
Assistant of products and News Editor gift cards that come to our door, everything from free dinners at Outback Steakhouse to books to Jots and lots of free samples. I don't care what's in the envelope as long as it's mail, because like all college students, mail and free stuff make me very happy. The randomness is another story. My former roommate Tara told me on an almost daily basis, "You are the most random person I know." And this was before my decision to bring home a giant salmon -head, scales and all -from the grocery store just because it looked cool. I disappear for days and can often be found in random spots around town adventurously roaming about and watching the residents. This has led me to the discovery of some of my favorite South Bend spots -Fiddler's Hearth at lunchtime, the duck pond in the park, the College Football Hall of Fame -but only one place in the city has combined my love of everything that is free and my tendency to jaunt off to nowhere for no reason. Movies 6 on University. Fondly known to me as "the dollar show," it actually costs two most of the time-but who am I to com­plain? It's almost as cheap as free, costing only $1 on Wednesdays and $.50 on Mondays when three people buy tickets together, and I can use the change I should be using to do my laundry with to get in. It costs three to six times as much to get in to a regu­lar movie. That's a lot of money for someone who sees as many movies as I do. I worked at a movie theater for five years before coming to college, and my ADD-addled brain became almost addicted to the serenity that comes with engrossing yourself in someone else's story for a few short hours. Now, my video collection is monstrous and dropping in to see a movie at the local theater from time to time has become almost second nature to me. In my own hometown, the cheap movie theater, Westlake, closed down after my senior year -which made me terribly sad, although I gained free entry at the theater I worked at. Westlake -like Movies 6 in South Bend -was a Peoria institution, and I was sad to see it go. Since I came to college, one of my favorite things to do when driving around South Bend at any time of day is just pull in to the dollar show and see whatever's playing. Over the past weekend when my roommates all went home and I was left with noth­ing to do I saw three movies -three -for a total cost of $4. Amazing. Now, one of them was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life, but hey-I only paid a buck to see it. And I would have paid at least twice that to rent it. So at least I took a chance and got it out of the way. Say what you want about Movies 6 -they play older movies, it's too small, the lobby isn't that nice-but I, along with the hundreds of South Bend residents who flood in every day, sometimes kids in tow, to see a cheap show, would have to argue with you. I love the dollar show and I hope it never closes. I know I'll be there every week to keep them in business.

Six-year-old boy suspended for sexual harassment 
BROCKTON, Mass. A Brockton, Mass., first grader was suspended from school for three days for allegedly sexually harassing a girl in his class.

Students to host Stein conference 
Topics for 'The Edith Stein Project' include rape, eating disorders 
Special to The Observer 
A group of' Notre Dame stu­dnnts is hosting a two-day con­l'nrnnce to examine the man­rwr in which contemporary nrltum imperils the dignity of' wonwn and to describe the vocation of wornnn in the rnod­nrn world. 
Thn conl'erencn, entitled "The Edith Stein Project: Hmlefining Feminism," will be lwld Friday and Saturday in MrKmma llall. Hapn, domes­tic violence, abortion, eating disordors, and the plight of fmnaln migrant workers will lm among the topics discussed by a variety of speakers, including Alasdair Madntyre, senior msearch fnllow in Notre Damn's Center for Ethics and Cullum; Hev. John A. Coughlin, professor of law in the Notre Dame Law School; Cynthia Mahmood, associate professor of anthropology at Notre Dame; Laura Garcia, professor of philosophy at Boston College; Miehael Scaperlanda, professor of law at the University of Oklahoma College of Law; and Deirdre McQuadn, pro-life spokes­woman for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. 
Born Oct. 12, 1891 to a Jewish family in Breslau, Germany, Edith Stein studied philology and philosophy at the Universities of Breslau and Goettingen and earned a doc­toral degree in philosophy from tho University of Freiburg, where she was a friend and collaborator with Edmund llusserl, the founder of phenomenology. She con­verted to Catholicism when she was 30 years old and 12 years later entered the Carmelite convent in Cologne. Fleeing persecution, she moved to a Carmelite convent in Echt, llolland, in 1938 but was arrested by the Nazis in 1942 during a nationwide retaliation following the Dutch Catholic bishops' denundation of the deportation of Jews and the expulsion of Jewish chil­dren from the Catholic school system. She died at Auschwitz on Aug. 9, 1942. Known in tho Carmelite order as Sister Teresa Benedicta of the Cross, Edith Stein was canonized, or proclaimed a saint, by Pope John Paul II in 1998. 
The conference will close with a Mass at 5 p.m. Saturday in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. Bishop John M. D'Arcy of Fort Wayne-South Bend will be the presiding cel­ebrant. 

Activist to discuss Emmett Till 
Special to The Observer 
Keith Beauchamp, eivil rights activist and lilrnmaker, will discuss his documentary "The Untold Story of' Emmett Louis Till" at 7 p.m. Feb. 15 in the auditorium of the llesburgh Center for International Studies. The leeture is free and open to the public. 
In a tragedy that eontributed to the beginning of the civil rights movement, Till, a black Chicago teenager visiting Money, Miss., was beaten and murdered for publicly addressing a white woman in 1955. The two men charged in the case were acquitted by an all-white jury. 
Beauchamp's documentary provides eyewitness testimony and an interview with Till's mother, which revealed other potentially guilty parties and ultimately prompted the U.S. Department of Justice to reopen the case in 2004. 
Scholar finds cartoon protests distressing 
Special to The Observer 
Hashied Omar is a Muslim scholar at Notre Dame who makes it his mission in life to harness religion as a force for building peace. He shakos his head in deep dis­trnss that Danish car­toons have led to vio­lent protests in the name of Islam. 
"This has really set us back," said Omar, who coordinates the Program in Religion, Conflict and Peacebuilding at Notre Dame's Joan B. Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies. 
Omar is a former imam of a South African mosque, and he teaches a course in Islamic ethics. lie under­stands why most Muslims view a cartoon depieting the Prophet Muhammad with a bomb coming out of his head­gear as offensive and repre­hensible. 
"It is yet another illustra­tion of' Islamophobia and hate speech against Muslims that in their view appears to be pervasive in western media depictions of Islam," he said. 
But those who vent their dismay with destruction are 

wrong, Omar belinves. lin has joined Islamic: scholars and institutions all over the world -including the Grand Muf'lis of Syria, Egypt and thn Turkish Ministry of Holigious Affairs -who have unnquiv­ocally condnrnned thn vio­lence that has accompanied some of the Muslim protests over the cartoons. 
"The death of four Afghan protesters, the killing of a Catholic priest in Turkey, the torching of Danish om bassins in Syria and Lebanon, tho issuing of death threats against journalists should be condemned as abomination and contrary to the lettnr and spirit of Islam," he said. 
lle callnd upon the world community to use the tragic sequence of events as an impetus for candid dialogue about freedom of spench, cul­tural xenophobia, and tho root causes of' violence and terror. 
"There is a dire need for the followers of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, as well as all other traditions, to retrieve our common human­ity and to end the horrific dehumanization that is taking place on global scale," he said. 
Omar holds a doetorato from the University of Cape Town, and a master's degree in peace studies from Notre Dame.

Baron said. 

"We just want to talk to land­lords and let them know what stu­dents are thinking," Baron said. "We want to let them know they don't have to evict at the first vio­lation." 
Landlords are encouraged to evict students by the clause of the amendment stating that after the notice to abate, a second violation on the premises will result in a fine ranging from $250 to $2,500. The amount of the fine is deter­mined in part by the landlord's efforts to ensure that another vio­lation does not occur. Another key point, Baron said, is that the fine can be passed on from landlord to tenant. 
"We're not advocating breaking the law," Baron said, "but there are degrees of offenses, from mis­demeanors to felonies. There are degrees of law and degrees of penalty based on the offense." 
Baron expressed satisfaction that community relations has become a central issue in the cur­rent student body presidential campaigns, noting that only he and student body vice president Lizzi Shappell addressed the issue when campaigning for office last year. 
"We have seen the frayed rela­tions that exist and the potential for growth," he said. "To see so many students come with plans ... is a great sign of progress."

Gunty said. 

Censoring productions that 
present non-Catholic values, 
he said, is "indirectly implying 
we as students don't have 
knowledge of our faith." 
Thwaites said while many 
tim11s students are raised 
Catholic, it's by birth, not 
choiee. Confrontation with a 
different belief system can 
help students realize the true 
nature oftheir faith, he said. 
"When you come to a uni­
versity like Notre Dame, it's a 
very new experience. I think 
the Catholicism, in a way, 
should fit thai mold," 
Thwaites said. "When you 
come to a university, you're 
not forced into the path, you 
have options. Ultimately, hope­
fully [questioning students] 
will choose Catholicism, not 
[have it] chosen for them." 
And despite Jenkins' 
attempts to open the dialogue 
to the entire campus commu­
nity -delivering three 
addresses, putting the 
speech's transcript and feed 
on the Internet and setting up 
an e-mail address for feed­

unanswered questions and 
widespread misunderstanding,

"I think what some people

Gunty said. 

Both Brown and Walsh sen­
ator Erin Hankins said there 
was confusion regarding the 
different guidelines for depart­
ment-sponsored and dorm-run 
events, citing an apparent 
double standard. 

Hankins read the Open

the presence of controversial 
events on campus. 

"Notre Dame students and

"I think what Notre Dame lacks at the moment is a transparent poli­cy," Collon said. "I would strongly encourage you to work in that direction." 
Fisher senator Chris Garibaldi said if the University continues to allow "morally questionable" productions and offers them a "place of promi­nence enjoyed by no other events," he did not see how Notre Dame could "stop [its] Catholic identify from eroding any further." 
He believed the University's decision to present "The Vagina Monologues" in a DeBartolo Hall classroom with free admission was a good solution. 
"I think that helps academic freedom more than anything else," said Garibaldi, who thought the free admission could encourage more stu­dents to attend the production. 
Several senators said the most important avenue to pur­sue is compromise regardless of the side students take in the debate.

USA Today account manager Megan O'Connell presented options regarding distribution locations -or "touchpoints" -and distribution recepta­cles. 
"The goal of this program is easy access, convenient and accessible for students," O'Connell said. 
Approximately 2,000 news­papers will be available to stu­dents daily next fall. The types and locations of papers have not been determined at this point, but Academic Affairs committee chair Chris Harris will work on these details with Readership Program repre­sentatives during the next few weeks. 
+ The Oversight committee presented two resolutions to the Senate modifying the Student Union constitution. Both passed without opposi­tion. 
The first resolution grants Senate committees the ability to program events -a power already used by many commit­tees but technically unconsti­tutional.-while the second clarifies certain aspects of the annual transition process.

Does the Church Still Use Excommunication? 
In short, yes. I would guess, though, that the ecclesiastical penalty of excommunication is generally poorly understood. So what does it mean to be ''excommunicated"? One who is excommunicated can no longer receive the Sacraments, including the reception of Holy Communion, the central act of worship within the Catholic Church. The practice of separating certain gross offenders from the rest of the Christian commu­nity goes all the way back to biblical times (see Matt 18:15-20 and I Cor 5: 1-5). 
There are two different ways that excommunication occurs. First, some sins are so heinous as to warrant automatic excommunication the moment one knowingly commits such asin. Church Law specifies sev­en sins that incur automatic excommunication: desecrating the Blessed Sacrament or using it for asacrilegious purpose, procuring or assisting in an abortion, using physical force against the Pope, apriest absolving an accomplice in asin against the Sixth Commandment (on adultery), a bishop consecrating someone as a bishop without permission of the Pope, a priest directly violating the seal of confession, apostasy (renun­ciation of faith). heresy (denial of revealed religious Truth), or schism (separating oneself from the Church). (It's important to note that a Catholic who is divorced is NOT among those listed as automatically excommunicated; aproblem only arises if the divorced Catholic tries to rematry without an annulment of the previous marriage.) 
In addition to automatic excommunication, a bishop can pronounce excommunication on certain individuals or groups whose actions or be­liefs are so contrary to Catholic Christian faith as to warrant it. munication of this sort has occurred, for example, in the Archdiocese of St. Louis as recently as this past December 2005, when a lay board of directors at St. Stanislaus Kostka parish time and time again refused to submit to the authority of either the Archbishop or the Pope, and knowingly hired asuspended priest from a neighboring diocese as their new pastor. Both the lay board and the priest, in committing the crime of schism, were excommunicated and the parish has been suppressed (more information on this sad yet interesting situation can be found online at http://stlouisreview.com/abpcolumn.php?abpid=9772). 
Excommunication, while asevere penalty, is never irreversible. As Fr. John Dietzen writes, "Excommunication always includes the in · tion to repentance and return, and holds out the promise of forgiveness from God and the Christian community, the Church."

After creating and running the first ever Dil­lon Hall retreat, it is only fitting that sophomore math major Matt Anderson should be featured in this week's "Live It". Through collabora­tion with staff from Campus Ministry and other Campus Ministry Commissioners, Matt nl'.lnnPrll 
an overnight retreat for Dillon Hall that was filled to capacity in its first year. Matt took all the initiative to find quality speakers and recruit Dillon residents for the retreat. While it is certain that Dillon Hall will benefit greatly all of Matt's work on the retreat, his service to Dillon Hall does not stop there. Matt also started up agroup from Dillon that says morn­ing prayer, the Liturgy of the Hours, Monday through Friday at 7:45AM. As if he did not already do enough for Dillon. Matt also leads the Dillon Hall Emmaus faith-sharing group. 
Luckily for people not living in Dillon Hall, Matt's efforts of service extend past his home. Last summer Matt participated in a summer service project in New Mexico at the Dismas House, which is an organization that helps ex-convicts try to successfully re-enter society. This summer Matt's service will keep him on campus as he pmticipates as acounselor for the NDVision program. He will mentor students as they grow in their faith and discern their vocation in life. Matt also commits his Sunday mornings to the RCIA program, where he is a sponsor for a Notre Dame student who is pre­paring to join the Catholic Church. 
Matt accomplishes all of this while also be· a member of the Glee Club. This year Matt is the Glee Club service commissioner and has organized service projects that range from sing­ing to elderly Holy Cross priests to helping out at the Robinson Center. Matt brings his com­mitment to his faith and service to everything in which he is involved. Thank you Matt for spreading the Gospel message through so many 
of your life!

Study: Birth defects vvere linked to corn 

Associated Press 
HARLINGEN, Texas ­Contaminated corn may have caused an increase in babies born with rare birth defects in the Rio Grande Valley in the early 1990s, according to a new study. 
Scientists have been searching more than a decade for the cause of a surge in babies in the region with neural tube defects, abnormalities of the brain and spinal cord that arise in the first weeks of pregnan­cy. 
In one south Texas county, there were six cases in six weeks of babies born with rudimentary or missing brains. Overall, a high rate of neural tube defects was found among almost all bor­
'
'. 
der counties. 
Residents and lawyers had blamed pollution, and General Motors and other U.S.-owned factories paid $17 million without admit­ting wrongdoing to settle a lawsuit accusing their bor­der factories of poisoning the air. 
But no chemical links to 
the disease were ever proven, and Texas health officials began suspecting fumonisin, a toxin in corn mold. Experts had noted a high concentration in the corn harvest just before the outbreak. Some Texas hors­es died from brain disease caused by the toxin. 
According to the February issue of the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, researchers now have a study that looks at the relationship between tortilla consumption, fumon­isin and neural tube defects. Laboratory data have point­ed to a link, but until now, researchers have lacked human studies. 
The study found that preg­nant women who ate 300 to 400 tortillas a month during the first trimester had more than twice the risk of giving birth to babies with the defects than did women who ate fewer than 100 tortillas. 
Blood samples indicated that the higher the level of fumonisin, the greater the risk of neural tube defects.

Though the future of the event will remain uncertain until Jenkins has listened to feedback and made a decision, campus those who are open about it and those who are not, Williams said. 
"It creates a sense of unity, a visible presence on campus," Williams said. "Your average person might see a bunch of orange shirts and think, 'O.K., I'm gay, and there are people here who are not completely homophobic and hating me at any given moment."' 
Laina said ticket sales seem to indicate a peaked interest in the event this year. The DeBartolo Center for the Performing Arts ticket office reported the films sold out much faster than last year. On Tuesday afternoon, five of the seven screenings were sold out, and only a handful of tickets remained for the others.

''I'm hoping it's not going to be so polarizing. I feel that's a risk you take when you do these things," Williams said. "Hopefully we can get some signatures to show Jenkins we're interested in his policies and what he has to say."

Jenkins did not deliver a firm policy on events in conflict with Catholic values but said enough to since spur widespread mobi­lization on campus among groups like unrecognized gay/straight student group AllianceND and the newly­formed group United for Free Speech. 
"There is a heightened sense of urgency in the people who support [Gay and Lesbian Film: Filmmakers, Narratives, Perspectives]," AllianceND co­coordinator Anna Gomberg said. "We have to show our support so it will be around next year and the year after." 
Hoping to draw regional and national media attention to their cause, both groups are hosting a "massive" petition

an expert with the Paris-based World Organization for Animal llealth, said it was not known how the virus entered Nigeria, but migratory waterfowl likely played a role because the coun­try is on a "major flyway.'' 
No cases of H5N1 bird flu have been reported elsewhere in Africa, and the outbreak appears to be restricted to birds, he said. 
"The significance is that it's a completely new continent that we need to be looking at," Thiermann said. 
Sub-Saharan Africa, with about 600 million of the world's poorest people, is particularly ill-suited to deal with a major health crisis. With weak and impoverished government insti­tutions in regions where many people keep chickens for food, experts say any mass killings ­often a first step in controlling bird flu -will be difficult to pull off. 
China, meanwhile, announcnd another human case of the dis­ease -a 26-year-old woman ­bringing to at least 11 tho num­ber of people in China who havn been infected. Two have died.

t\11 46,000 chicken, geese and ostriches on the Nigerian farm were slaughtered and their bod­ies disposed of, Thinrmann said. Nigerian authoritins havn banned the movement of birds and people off the farm. 
"We shall quarantine and stamp out all livestock in any farm suspected of having avian influenza and pay full compen­sation to the owners," Bello said. 
Thiermann said that was a good start, and a tnam of experts to assess and provide technical advice will leave for Nigeria in a few days, although more help was needed. 
"We feel that they are doing everything thny can and they certainly need help," he said of' Nigeria. 
Officials also are invnstigating whether birds were transfnrred to other farms in the past 21 days, and they, too, are being quarantined, he said. 
Nigerian officials said Wednesday that initial tests on chickens that mysteriously died in Kano, a state neighboring Kaduna. showed no signs of bird 11u.

Why should you support the Bengal Bouts? Because of people like Father Eugene Homich, a veteran of 50 years in the Holy Cross Missions in Bangladesh. 
With 131 million people, represent­ing a religious blend of 88 percent . Muslim and 11 per­cent Hindu, Bangladesh has only 250,000 Catholics. 

The per capita annual income is $1,470, less than some of us spent on the Fiesta Bowl. Homich works among the poorest of the poor, yet he has achieved an 85 percent literacy rate in his parish in Pirgacha. He also stresses that the Garo Tribal people are well-versed their own language and culture. 
With the help of the Bengal Bouts, he has built a medical clinic that treats 9,000 patients per year, includ­ing hundreds of snake-bite victims. He has placed over 750 abandoned infants with warm and loving fami­lies. 
These and other works he combines with a full liturgical and catechetical schedule, with the critical aid of Holy Cross Sisters. 
"My life," writes Homich, "has been enriched by working with the poor and marginalized." 
The 185 Holy Cross brothers, sisters and priests there are mostly natives of Bangladesh. The Bengal Bouts pro­vide the largest single donation for their work every year. 
"We rely so much on all of you," writes Father Stephen Gomez, "to help us prepare our men in forma­tion, sponsor the social projects for the poor, and support our Tribal parishes." 
"There is," he notes, "political

unrest, a rise in fundmentalism and corruption everywhere." In the past six months, 25 people were killed in two grenade attacks by Islamic ter­rorists. But the missionaries stay on the job. 
For 75 years, the Bengal Bouts have sent to Bangladesh donations now averaging in excess of $50,000. In a country where the price of a Starbucks coffee could feed a family for a week, the success or failure of the Bouts can actually make the dif­ference between life and death for some of the "ultra-poor." 
Under the supervision of Rich O'Leary and Dave Brown of Club Sports, the program is run by the stu­dent officers of the Boxing Club -Co­Presidents Mark Basola and Nathan Schroeder and Captains Andrew Breslin, Johnny Griffin, Greg Schaefer, Chris Calderone, Andrew McGill and Stu Stypula. 
"There's a unique camaraderie," explained Nate Schroeder. "Boxers help each other, including their own future opponents. And we make a dif­ference in the lives of many people in Bangladesh." Each of the more than 130 boxers sells tickets and program ads. 
Everyone knows, however, that the entire enterprise is kept afloat by the competent and organized student managers -Erika Meyer, Megan O'Farrell and Melanie Rodarte. Without them, the details of finance, medical clearances and sparring records would sink the program beneath the waves. ­
The Bengal Bouts would not exist without the leadership of the volun­teer head coaches -Chicago attorney Terry Johnson, Columbus developer Tom Suddes (who conducts practice sessions that build character, includ­ing, Tom would admit, his own, in a uniquely interesting way) and Pat Farrell, the University pilot. All are former Bengal champs. 
The assistant coaches include Sweet 
C. Robinson of the Buchanan Police Department and former boxers Mike Biolchini, Jeff Dobosh, Ryan Hans, Chip Farrell and Judge Holand ChamblPe. 
The chapla-ins of the Club, who par­ticipate in the workouts, are Father Bill Seeteh, and Father Brian DalPy, who also coaches. Even the upper echelons of Church hierarchy are involved through the timer, Monsignor .John Hagerty from Notre Dame parish in Hermitage, Penn. 
In 75 years, the Bouts has never had a participant sustain a serious injury. That impressive statistic is no accident. The Emergency Medical Technicians -Terri Engel and Mike Ude -are present at all sparring matches, and Doctor James Moriarty, the Univ.ersity chief of medicine, keeps close tabs on every aspect of the program. Jack Zimmerman, who brings decades of experience to his role as trainer, provides an important safety reinforcement. 
The Bengal Bouts will be held in five sessions, all in the Joyce Athletic and Convocation Center: Feb. 21, 22 and 28, all at 6:30p.m.; March 2 at 7:30 p.m.; and the finals in the JACC arena on Sunday, March 5, at 1:30 p.m. 
The "season" ticket will admit you to all sessions for only $10. 
Real people, in very real need, depend on the annual successes of the Bengal Bouts. If you have never attended the Bouts, give it a chance. You will not only enjoy it, but your hearts will be touched, for the spirit, inspiration and good will are undeni­able.

Traditional values foster hope 
Recently, in the debate over ''The Vagina Monologues," students have been playing the academic freedom card. The use of the term has become so perverted that it now seems to be synonymous with the senti­ment that "anything goes" in an academic setting. 
The Monologues are free to be discussed and should be explored in classrooms. However, the line must be drawn when Notre Dame is encouraged to compromise its Catholicity by endorsing a vulgar play. 
The pro-Monologue crowd says that the goal of the play is to educate people about violence against women. There are many ways to educate people on this vitally important topic without explicit depictions of homosexual seduction and masturbation and liberal use of lewd language in refer­ence to the female anatomy. 
That is why I propose that Notre Dame follow the lead of Providence College.

"Instead of producing 'The Vagina Monologues,' the best way for Providence College to work together to combat vio­lence against women is to strengthen il<J commitment to support Project S.A.V.E. (Sexual Assault and Violence Education)," says Providence President Reverend Brian 
J. Stanley, according to the Providence College Web site. 
That sounds like a great idea-what better way to educate both men and women than to provide opportunities that are equally inclusive? After all, isn't it important that men become involved in this type of education? 
I guess that is only true ifthe primary goal of the educational experience is to affect positive change, rather than wallow­ing in lament about a pr{)blem. 
Frankly, I find it offensive and presump­tuous that the publisher of "The Vagina Monologues" says that it has become the "Bible of a new generation of young women." The young women that I know fmd the play embarrassing and disgusting -certainly not something to be proud of. And as a man, I'm not proud ofit either. 
I came to Notre Dame because it is a Catholic University commited to espousing Catholic principles. I am ashamed to tell my friends at state universities about th.is lastest campus issue because it diminishes Notre Dame's integrity as a premier insti­tution of Catholic higher learning. 
I am starting to gain hope that the University will stop compromising its val­ues for those who wish to perform this play. University President Father .John Jenkins, please keep giving me hope.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Put 'Monologues' to the democratic test 
Two important nvnnts took place last wnnk. 
In the midst of gnnnrally thoughtful discussion following presnnlalions to thn faculty, students and alumni on the topic of acadmnie frnmlom and the Father Richard Catholic identity of Warner Notrn Dame by Univnrsity Prnsidnnl 
FaithPoint

Father John Jnnkins, the trustees and ofli­cnrs of thn Univnrsity spnnt live days in 
Homn. 
In addition to holding their usual win­tnr m1~nting. they also took advantagn of tlwir presnnen in the Etnrnal City and the Son of l'ntnr to partidpatn in an nxtraordinary pilgrimage for the first tinw in our history. 
Thn trustees and ol'licers had nnver lwf'ore spnnt livn days together, and t.lwir days in Homo wnro characterized by many rnomnnls of' prayer togetlH~r; privileged visits to spodal venues in Homn; eonversations with cardinals, archbishops, lloly Cross bishops from Bangladesh. India, Homn and thn Unitnd Stalns, ambassadors to Italy and the lloly Sn11, nwmhnrs of' the gonnral administration of thn Congregation of lloly Cross, and Notre Dame faculty and students. 
And, of course, participation by Jenkins and many members of the dele­gation in a general audience with Pope Benediet XVI. 
Within the first months of the admin­istration of a new president and the trustees who had elected him, it was important to engage in a fruitful dia­logue between high ranking oflicials of the Vatican and members of our Notre Dame community. 
The opportunities for prayer were extraordinary as Masses, which were celebrated in Homan parishes as well as in St. Petnr's Basilica at the Altar of the Chair and the Altar of the Tomb of St. Peter, less than ten yards from the tomb of the late Pope John Paul II. 
Conversations with Vatican ul'lieials wore informative and mutually enrich­ing in a context of respect. At an Academic Convocation and Conference at St. John Lateran Pontifical University, popularly referred to as "the Pope's University," Bishop Hino Fisichella, Jnnkins and Bishop Daniel Jenky, offered ref1ections on the role of the Catholic University in the context of the Church and culture, academic lifo and the history of the Congregation of Holy Cross in higher education. 
Honorary degrees were conferred on Bishop Fisichella and L. Francis Rooney, III, the U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See. 
"Notre Dame is a great Catholic uni­versity," Pope Benedict said, as he clasped Jenkins' hand in his. 
The phrase was both a statement of recognition of what Notre Dame has achieved as well as a challenge for us to continue to strive for even greater dis­tinction and prominence in this impera­tive, which lies at the heart of our mis­sion and channels our energy and informs our deepest aspirations. 
The death of Coretta Scott King also took place last week. While she was the widow of the assassinated Martin Lutlwr King, Jr., she was also a tower­ing figure in her own right. She was every bit as courageous as her husband and suffered as much as he did in pur­suit of equal rights for all people, regardless of the color of their skin. 
While her death marks the end of one of the most significant achievements in our history as a people, may it also be a continuing clarion call for our nation and for our University to continue pur­suing a most just cause that dearly has many more hurdles to overcome, atti­tudes to be changed and justice to be secured before we can rest as a people. 
President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed University Prosident Emeritus Father Theodore llosburgh as chairman of the United States Civil Bights Commission, and the work of that group led to extraordinary changes in our lifo as a nation undor the rule of law. 
In 1987, Coretta Scott King receivml an honorary degrne from the hands of llesburgh in a poignant Commencnmnnl Ceremony that marknd the end of a 35­ynar presidency. 
Both of these nvents represent signifi­cant moments for all of us. 
They represent, as well, a challenge for each of us to doepnn our commit­ment to pursue roalizable dreams for our University and our eountry and turn them into tho gnu:n-fillml possibilities thoy hold out to us. 
Father Richard V. Warner is director (~{Campus Ministry. lie can be reached at Warner.2@nd.edu 
The views expressed in this column are those of the author and not neces­sarily those of Tlw Observer. 
Nnndlnss to say, .10 pages of The Observer the past few wn1~ks show how irresolvable issues of sexual ethics and frnPdom of expression have become on this campus. 
We have readH· -;uch a stalemate becausn we are lacking a basie and nfli1etive mode of government. Such a mode of govnrnnwnt. would allow our enlin~ community to justly hamlin sut h eonlroversial decisions as whether or not to sponsor tho <)ueor Film Festival or "The Vagina Monologues." This mode of government is called democ­raey. 
It is sorely lacking at thn University of Notre Dame. 
llnre, I will outlirw what dnmocracy is not, hoping to nxpose some of llw nonsense posing in its name. Then I will conclude with a simple suggestion for how to move forward in this dnhaln and will consider snveral possible ohjm:tions. 
Democracy dons not mean that we have to allow any­one to gel up in our private spacn in the name of "free spl'ech" or "snxuallibnration." Sevnrallettnrs to the edi­tor have pointml out that no on11 has a right to force somnhody to stagn "The Vagina Monologues" in her own privaln home. 
This senms like common sense, but eoming from a lib­oral East Coast university, I have encountered quite a few authoritarian feminists who do, in faet, want to police the homo and the bedroom, getting the state involved to reeducate traditional women and men who supposedly have "false consdousness," teaching us how to be sexu­ally lib!watnd. 
Now I need to make it dear that I am not critiquing fmninism hen~ in order to endorse the widespread status quo on ntmpus: the fad that men ean talk about women's sexuality publidy, but when women talk about it, moasuros are taken to silence them. 
This is a patriarehal double standard that must be ehallnngml, but within the challenge, there's no room for a liboral vanguard that wants to enlightnn everyone and show them where their vaginas are. My friends on vari­ous campuses havo organized "The Vagina Monologues" -I've seen it many times, and it isn't a bad play. 
But it annoyed me my senior year of college to see it advnrtised around campus by hundreds of posters of nak1~d white womnn. The implicit suggestion from many secular feminists is that Muslim women who wear the veil, African womnn who choose to be circumcised, or Catholic women who praetice abstinence arn somehow backwards, irrational, brainwashnd and deluded. 
Nowa Omoigui writos the following in tho Jenda Journal, a forum for African women activists who are fed up with such patronizing "liboration": 'The cultural war against female cireumdsion is led by the same western human right-; crowd that ... puts pictures (of same sex eouplns) in books li1r little children to read and learn from. I have the right to invoke my ancient customs and look askanee at such a policy -and pro teet my kids from it-at the risk of being called conservative." 
lndend. The College Libertarians ("Protecting Frnedoms," Fnb. 3 ) are right in saying that private indi­viduals like Omoigui should be free to "censor" what their own childrnn are exposed to in their own houses Forcing these women to do otherwise would be a racist form of cultural imperialism extended today by too many secular missionaries. 
llowever, a large university like Notre Dame is not the same thing as a private home. This campus is the neigh­borhood and the workplace of thousands of people. To govern it like a private family with tight control and cen­sorship from University President Father John Jenkins as the paterfamilias would be to treat thousands of work­ers, professors and students like the indentured servants or young children of an abnormally large and excessive­ly patriarchal private household. 
Jenkins seems to realize the absurdity of this when he points out that he has no desire to censor 'The Vagina Monologues" or the Queer Film Festival. lie is simply concerned about whether or not to sponsor them. But why should he be the only one to make this decision of whether or not to sponsor? 
If we believe in democracy, then why should it end at the door of our workplace, dorm and dassroom? Why, just because thousands of stan·, professors, TAs and stu­dents work for and live at a legally "private" corporation should we leave demoeracy outside its gates? As far as I am concerned, democracy is incompatible with capitalist corporatism, the notion that experts and professional classes above society should make all informed decisions in our workplaces, schools and neighborhoods. 
For democracy to flourish, we should be able to vote on how to use our resources in our workplace, our school and our neighborhood. We, not PH oxperts, should be the ones who decide how to project our community's name and image. 
Now, one could object that Jenkins is generously trying to get our "input" and "participation" as to what decision he should make in choosing to sponsor or not sponsor our campus' controversial events. He says he is kindly trying to "dialogue" with us. I read this as nothing but a patronizing insult to the maturity and self-governing capacities of the stall", faculty and students of this University. 
Democracy means that all adult members of a commu­nity govern that community together with equal say. It does not mean that we get invited to send input-filled e­mails to a man who was not elected by us, is not accountable to us by instant recall and whose position tends to rotate only with the retirement of the last reign­ing big papa. 
It is an insult to ask us to participate when, in reality, we as a community should be governing this campus ourselves. It is we who should be asking Jenkins to par­ticipate, and to participate as an equal. As for Jenkins' call to dialogue, it reminds me of the way Fidel Castro governs -articulated in Che Guevara's "Man and Socialism in Cuba": the benevolent ruler goes among the people, listens to the people, dialogues with the people, learns from the poople and channels the "input" of the people back to his unaccountable cadre of bureaucrats who make the final decision behind closed doors. 
In contrast to this crass corporate populism, I propose true democracy. I propose that the University of Notre Dame hold a campus-wide referendum whereby all members of the so-called "Notn~ Dame family" can voto on whether the University should sponsor "The Vagina Monologues" and the Queer Film Fnstival. Then we can be sure that nobody-including Jenkins -unfairly uses the University's name to hawk his own individual opin­ion. 
Now someone may object, "What about the tyranny of the majority?" What if the majority decides to bully and censor the minority? My response is that frne speeeh is not free; it is not a gift of the state, and it only comes when we secure and defend it ourselves. 
If anyone tries to organize poliee repression or violence to shut down free speech on this campus, I will stand by whatever minority is getting threatened and hope others will join me. What we are talking about here is not een­sorship, it is sponsorship. 
Of course, "The Vagina Monologues" should be able to be performed on campus mgardless of the outeome of a vote. What is at stake is whether or not it should bn shown using University money in Notrn Dame's name. Something this serious should be dedded by all peopln who make up the Notre Dame eommunity. 
Others may object that I am reducing morality and Catholic character to a simple opinion poll. But I am saying nothing hero about the morality or immorality of the themes raised by the different narratives in "The Vagina Monologues" or the films shown in the Queer Film Festival. I am not about to suggest that the campus hold a referendum on whether female masturbation is a moral act. 
Again, the only decision I propose democratic control over is whether these event<> should bn sponsored by the University. Since we're all supposedly lrainnd in Catholic character, I don't sec why anyone should doubt that we'd be able to come together and make an inli1rmed decision. 
I imagine that many who disapprove of some of the behavior portrayed in "The Vagina Monologues" would still vote to sponsor it simply because they want to engage critically with the important moral, political and aesthetic issues it raises, especially ito; important stanen against domestic violence. 
Conversely, I am sure a lot of men and women who, quiet as it's kept, masturbate and engage in premarital sex all the time will vote against sponsoring it. 
Since Jenkins has asked for input, I chalhmgn him to step aside and allow this eontroversial decision to be made by the entire Notre Dame eommunity through ref­erendum vote. If, fi1r some reason, he is intent upon making the decision through his own autocratic power, then I challenge him to publicly explain why he does not believe in democracy.

CD REVIEWS 
Franz Ferdinand can't get much 'Better' 
By ANALISE LIPARI 
Scene Critic 
Franz Ferdinand -or the new Scottish gentry, as they call themselves -has released its latest album, "You Could Have It So Much Better." Continuing in the musical vein of their self-titled debut album, the record proves to actually be that much better. as it stays true to their characteristic style. 
The band, drawing its name from the archduke whose assassination spawned World War I, also displays some of this left-of-center, funky irreverence in its songs. This time around, "Better" proves no exception. 
Originally meant to be the second in a series of tideless albums defined only by color -their first release was centered on brown, orange and cream, and "Better" uses green, red and black -the title of "You Could Have It So Much Better" came from what lead singer and guitarist Alex Kapranos feels is the band's current philosophy. 
"You can always have it better. If you try. That's the attitude of the group at the moment. Never to feel satisfied, always to heavy guitar riffs anchoring their respec­tive tunes in different ways. Yet other tracks are less like rock and more like six­ties mod ballads, not unlike their previous album's "Jacqueline." On "You Could Have It So Much Better," tracks like "Fade Together" and "Walk Away" use the band's distinct vocals and a more relaxed pace to both depart from and emphasize more fully their signature sound. 

The tones of Kapranos' lead vocals are firm, jaunty and different. The overall sound leaves the listener wondering how old-school punk, sixties mod rock and modern alternative music can possibly work together so seamlessly. 
The album really shines on its first sin­gle, "Do You Want To," which blends their undeniably sexual energy with stripped down lyrics and gorgeously simple guitar riffs. In its most basic essence, the song just makes you want to get up and dance. 
The song's video makes for fun viewing as it adds another typical Franz Ferdinand characteristic, having a fun sense of the goofy and irreverent about them. That sensibility is clearly heard with great results in "Do You Want To." 
"This Boy" is also a great track, with a distinct beat and a chorus whose melody varies distinctly from its verses in typical Franz fashion. The beat is emphasized with strong guitar chords and, again, Kapranos' addictive and intriguing vocals. 
The disc on the whole is arguably better than their 2004 self-titled debut, and it both heightens and deepens their style and skill for both the seasoned or fresh listener. Ultimately, for Franz Ferdinand the aim is to keep its public mesmerized and moving. 
"I want to make music that will make the blood surge in your veins, music that will get people up and dance," Kapranos said in a November article from the Aberdeen Express.

want to do something better," Kapranos said in a recent FranzFerdinand.org arti­cle. 
Franz Ferdinand consists of Kapranos, guitarist and keyboardist Nick McCarthy, bassist Robert Hardy and percussionist Paul Thomson. With all its members hail­ing from Glasgow, the band began its rise in Scotland's largest city. With buzz slowly growing from positive word of mouth, Franz Ferdinand guided themselves up the ladder of the local underground music scene until record labels pounced upon them in 2003. 
Since its inception and growth in the music business, the band has continued writing its own music and letting that personal writing and artistic touch be central parts of their musical and person­al identity as a group. 
"You're letting such a fragile side of yourself out when you're creating or writ­ing music. To do that with people who are almost strangers would seem very strange to me," Kapranos said. "I think that we're very lucky that we're quite close. To us, it's almost like the band is the grandest possible adventure you can go on with your friends. It's really really exciting." 
That unique 
songwriting effort shows through in the singular sound for which the band has become so famous. Oddly retro and yet thoroughly mod­ern, Kapranos and his peers have created another album of 
solid guitar rock.

Band's new album boasts classic rock influence 
gressions are catchy and clever, although not necessarily novel. The songs avoid being repetitive, but none of them sound rushed either. The album might not impress music enthusiasts with its imagi­nation, but it definitely will not bore any­one. 
While The Hellacopters don't explore a broad range of style on the album, the songs don't fall into the trap of all sound­ing alike. Tempos remain roughly the same on most tracks. but structures and hooks change quite a bit from song to song. 
Some of the tunes could pass as exag­gerated versions of Blues Brothers songs, but most of them come off as more gen­uine and sincere than the majority of commercial radio rock music.

By JOE LATTAL Scene Critic 
Few bands emerge these days one could picture on tour with REO Speedwagon, The Who or Boston. But what The Darkness was to '80s hair metal in 2003, The Hellacopters are to classic rock in 2006. 
Music fans would be hard-pressed to find a rock 'n' roll band that embraces its classic rock influences as openly as these five men from Sweden. They serve as a stark contrast to the rise of collegcfmdie rock artists. which often preach peaceful resolutions and imagination to their audi­ences. 
Their newest album, "Rock & Roll Is Dead," is a low risk, but spotlessly pro­duced, rock album. Electric guitar pro-on culture.

Although pick

TV,"Leave it Alone' and 'Murder on My Mind' 
scrapes are all over radio-friend-ly pop punk records, here they sound inventive, surrounded by testosterone­driven vocals and the glamorous sound of three electric guitars. 


Even the narrative style of songwriting, which has disappeared on modern com­mercial rock, is similar to the type of songs the Rolling Stones wrote 40 years ago. Just as The Darkness took advantage of their cartoonish appeal a few years ago, The Hellacopters don't mind poking fun at themselves. 
In ''I'm in the Band," Nicke Andersson explains the frustrations of trying to get around bouncers at clubs. 
"I may not look like Jagger, I may not have money in the bank I I've got a pair of cheap sunglasses I and my castle may look like sand." 
"Murder on My Mind," which reveals the haunting nature of the music industry, is about how the business side of the industry has killed rock 'n' roll music. The honest and frank lyrics about how The Hellacopters, who are at Liquor and Poker Records, feel about corporate execs is dear -"First you killed the heartbeat, then you killed the soul I You killed rock and roll, I got murder on my mind." 
Are The Hellacopters out to resurrect rock 'n' roll? Maybe. With an evident admiration for rock 'n' roll roots and bru­tal sincerity, they're certainly one of the best candidates.

While Jackie Hobinson was the first black player in the majors, O'Neil was the first black coach, with the Cubs, and was also one of the first African­American scouts. His many finds included hall of l'amcrs Ernie Banks and Lou Brock. 
"You'd be hard-pressed to lind anybody who's done more for the game of baseball than Buck O'Neil," said Kendrick. "By all accounts, he was a great defen­sive first baseman, a great man­ager, a great scout, had a groundbreaking role as the game's first black coach. 
"Plus, there is his work as an ambassador of the game in itself, his work keeping the lega­cy of the Negro Leagues alive. If you put all that together, there's no question his career is I Jail of Fame worthy." 
As he approaches what C\)uld be the biggest day or his life, O'Neil is keeping calm. 
"If I make it, it's going to make me one of the happiest men in the world," he said. "And if I don't make it, it's not going to make me one of the saddest." 
Without question, this man is a walking repository of baseball ton~. lie can describn the sound of a Babn Huth home run.

But the entire breathtaking sweep of history that his <Wnnt­f'ul life has encompassed stretches far bnyond the game.

Associated Press 
Even as she approaches her 50th birthday and recovers from knee sur­gery, Martina Navratilova plans to play a full sched­ule of doubles tournaments in 2006, including the Grand Slams, and might take another stab at sin­gles. 
"I just feel like I'm not quite done yet," Navratilova said Wednesday in a telephone interview with The Associated Press from her home in Sarasota, Fla. "When I feel like I'm done, then I'm done. And I don't know when that will hap­pen." 
In a sense, she's finally being honest with herself and her fans, after having repeatedly made "This time I really mean it" dec­larations about when she would hang up her racket. But farewell tour followed farewell tour. 
Navratilova originally retired in 1994, with a record 167 singles titles and having spent 331 weeks ranked No. 1. She returned to the tour as a doubles player in 2000, and eventually couldn't resist dabbling in singles, including a first-round vic-
IN BRIEF 
MLB concerned with D.C. 
council's lease for Nationals 
WASHINGTON -Major League Baseball responded skeptically to a revised lease for the Washington Nationals that was approved early Wednesday by the District of Columbia Council, which rejected an earlier proposal just hours before. 
During a series of sessions that began Tuesday and lasted more than 14 hours, council members rejected the lease 8-5, then approved it 9-4 after capping the city's spending at just under $611 million. 
"Major League Baseball has not yet been provided with the filings made by the D.C. Sports & Entertainment Commission with the City Council last Friday, nor the text of the legis­lation passed by the Council last night," baseball spokesman Rich Levin said in a statement. "We are very concerned about what we heard during the debate, and we need to read the materials and the legislative language so we can determine tory at Wimbledon in 2004. 
Nowadays, she won't make any predictions about how much longer she'll play or whether she'll again give singles a try against players half her age -or younger. 
"We'll see how the body's going.... I might get on the grass again," she said when asked about playing singles. "Right now, that's so far away, I'm not wor­ried about it or thinking about it. If it happens, it happens. If I'm ready, then I'll play. If I'm not, then I won't." 
She injured her left knee during an exhibition event in November and had arthroscopic surgery the next month, forcing her to miss the Australian Open and other events. Back at practice, Navratilova is aiming to return to the WTA Tour at the Feb. 20­25 hard-court tournament at Dubai, United Arab Emirates, then wants to play the next week at Doha, Qatar. 
Her partner at those tournaments will be 29­year-old Liezel Huber, who teamed with Cara Black to win Wimbledon last year. "Hopefully, I can keep up my end of the bargain," Navratilova said.

become Reds' GM 
CINCINNATI -Minnesota's Wayne Krivsky overwhelmed the Cincinnati Reds' new owner during an inter­view Wednesday, then got the job as their next general manager. 
Krivsky's hiring ended a two-week search that involved eight candidates and ultimately came down to two ­him and Reds special adviser Jim Beattie. Krivsky's second interview went so well that owner Bob Castellini didn't need any more time to think it over. 
"He was totally prepared," Castellini said. "He blew us away." 
Krivsky was a leading candidate for the Reds' job two years ago, but former owner Carl Lindner chose Dan O'Brien, who had worked for the Houston Astros and Texas Rangers. O'Brien was fired last month by Castellini, who wanted to bring in his own executive to run the baseball operation. Italy . rep)~ces injuredOlympic sfd Jumpers 
TUHIN, Italy-Italy will replace its two injured ski jumpers with athletes from its Nordic combined team -a move that raises doubt about whether the host nation can make a strong showing in the event. 
The Italians were not considered to be medal contenders in ski jumping. but they were hoping to perform well in front of the home crowd at Pragelato. 
Instead, the team will take the unusual move of using Nordic com­bined athletes to replace the injured Marco Beltrame and Stefano Chiapolino. 
"With a lower number of athletes, we will take part in the same num­ber of events," Italian delegation head Raffaele Pagnozzi said Wednesday.

Michaels to switch to NBC 
Former ABC anchor will not make jump to ESPN with MNF

Do you believe in switching networks? Yes! 
AI Michaels appears head­ed to NBC after ESPN hired former quarterback Joe Theism ann. Washington Post colum­nist Tony Kornheiser and Mike Tirico as its Monday night broad­cast crew 

Michaels

Michaels had been with ABC since 1976 and had been the play­by-play voice of "Monday Night Football" since 1986, when he replaced Frank Gifford. A four-time Emmy­Award winner, he is best known for exclaiming "Do you believe in miracles? Yes!" when the United States upset the favored Soviet Union in the 1980 Winter Olympic hockey tournament. 
NBC takes over Sunday night games next season from ESPN. John Madden, Michaels' broadcast partner for the last four seasons, agreed in June to a six-year contract with NBC. 
"AI was not comfortable and let us know he was ESPN after 36 seasons on ABC. He was to be paired with Theismann, who had broadcast Sunday night games on ESPN with Mike Patrick and Paul Maguire. 
"1 feel like I'm a creature of Monday night. I'm home and I'm staying home," Michaels said then. "The three words 'Monday Night Football' resonate like no other."

U.S. pairs have not won an Olympic medal since 1988 in Calgary

Hena Inoue's smile lit up thn arena. John Baldwin's fist cut through the air like a sword. 
The couple had plenty to celn­brate after they landed the first throw triple axel in figure skating. Evnn more amaz­ing was that an American pair made history.

NHL 

League hires former prosecutor in probe 
Robert Cleary once led the investigation of the 'Unabomber' 
Associated Press 

The NHL hired the former fed­eral prosecutor who headed the Unabomber case to investigate Hick Tocchet, the Phoenix Coyotes assistant coach accused of financing a nationwide gam­bling ring that took bets from about a half-dozen current play­ers. 
Authorities have not said they have any evidence of betting on hockey in "Operation Slap Shot." Nothing has been ruled out, New Jersey State Police Lt. Gerald Lewis said Wednesday. 
Tocchet was to meet with NHL commissioner Gary Bettman on Wednesday, Phoenix coach Wayne Gretzky said a day earli­er. As of early evening, they had not gotten together. 
"We are fully cooperating with the league and certainly will be meeting with them," said Tocchet's newly hired New Jersey attorney, Kevin Marino. "We haven't met with them yet. I'm not going to discuss the exact time or date or place." 
Deputy commissioner Bill Daly declined to comment about Wednesday's proceedings. He said the NHL hoped to release a statement later in the day. 
Former U.S. attorney Hobert Cleary will conduct the NHL's internal investigation. He was the lead prosecutor from 1996­98 in the case against the Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski, who was sentenced to four lifetimes in prison on charges related to three deaths and the maiming of two scien­tists. 
Cleary was the U.S. Attorney in New Jersey from 1999-02 and in the Southern District of Illinois in 2002. 
Lewis said police investigators will interview other hockey play­ers to get a sense of the scope of the gambling ring and to deter­mine whether others should be charged. 
Tocchet was publicly implicat­ed by New Jersey authorities on Tuesday. He was not behind the bench for Tuesday night's home game against Chicago. 
Tocchet is expected ·to be arraigned within 10 days, said John Hagerty, a spokesman for the New Jersey division. of crimi­nal justice. 
Marino called the state's charges against his new client "false and irresponsible." 
"Mr. Tocchet is one of the most well-respected men ever to play in the NHL, and he's respected for his integrity, his determina­tion and his strength," the Newark-based lawyer said. "We deeply regret the attorney gener­al's precipitous charges and are appalled at the ensuing media frenzy." 
Gretzky's wife, actress Janet Jones, was also implicated, two law enforcement officials told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because no bettors have been publicly identified. 
She hasn't made any public statements, and Gretzky said Tuesday that she would answer questions at some point. 
"The integrity of the game is obviously very important. And betting on hockey is obviously something we don't want," Ottawa forward Daniel Alfredsson ·said. "Until you know all the facts, you don't know how it's going to affect the game or put a black mark on it." 
Lewis said authorities also were exploring links between the gambling and Philadelphia-area mobsters. He said the investiga­tion so far has only turned up that there might be some links, but not exactly what they were. 
He also declined to reveal which players will be inter­viewed. 
"Obviously when you're watch­ing the news and it's on CNN and FOX, it's pretty major," Alfredsson said. "I think to everybody it was a shocker. It was the talk for everybody on the bus yesterday and also today. We want to find out as much as we can." 
Hockey players are prohibited from making NHL wagers, legal or otherwise. There are no ruies that forbid them from betting on other sports. 
The substance abuse and behavioral health program joint­ly run by the league and the players' association addresses gambling during team-by-team training-camp meetings every year. 
Current NHL scoring leader Jaromir Jagr of the New York Hangers said he ran up a $500,000 debt in 1998 betting on sports events on the Internet during his days with the Washington Capitals. 
NCAA FOOTBALL 
Idaho hires former Miami coach 
Erickson signs five­year deal with team that started his career 
Associated Press 

MOSCOW, Idaho -Dennis Erickson returned to Idaho on Wednesday to become head coach at the school that gave him his start. 
The 58-year-old Erickson, who won two national champi­onships at Miami, got his first head coaching job at Idaho in 1982. He left after the '85 sea­son for a string of college jobs and eventually ended up in the NFL. 
His last stop was San Francisco, where after two dis­appointing seasons with the 49ers he was fired in January 2005. 
"I just thought it was an opportunity for me to come back, give back and get back to coaching college football ... my first love," Erickson said at a news conference. 
At Idaho, he succeeds Nick Holt, who returned to Southern California as defen­sive coordinator after changing his mind about becoming an assistant with the St. Louis Rams. 
Erickson signed a five-year contract worth about $200,000 a year, but with bonuses, it could be worth a total of about $1.5 million over the duration the contract, athletic director Rob Spear said. 
Idaho is entering its second season in the Western Athletic Conference. The Vandals were 5-18 in two years under Holt, including 2-9 last season. 
Despite the struggles, Erickson called Moscow "a

good fit" for him. 

Erickson has been unem­ployed since the 49ers fired him. He still receives $2.5 mil­lion per year from the 49ers. He was fired with three years left on his five-year, $12.5 mil­lion contract. 
Erickson turned Idaho into one of the top Division I-AA teams in the nation during his first stint with the Vandals. He was 144-57-1 as a head coach at Idaho, Wyoming, Washington State, Miami and Oregon State. His Miami teams won national championships in 1989 and 1991. 
He had less success in the NFL, going 31-33 in four years at the helm of the Seattle Seahawks and 9-23 with the 49ers. 
Between the two NFL jobs he revived a foundering Oregon State program, directing the Beavers to a 31-17 record, including a school-best mark of 11-1 and a 41-9 victory over Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl in the 2000 season. 
"The challenge here is to win, to compete for the confer­ence championship and to go to bowl games," Erickson said. "Yeah, I love it here. I came here because I"m a football coach and I want to help the University of Idaho become successful." 
Some of the Idaho players who watched the news confer­ence from the balcony of a new weight room are getting their third head coach in five years. 
Erickson said he met with the players Wednesday and talked about the work they will have to do to be competitive in the WAC.

Four Irish players -guard Chris Quinn (16 points), Carter (17 points), Francis and Cornett -all scored in double figures. 
"We just wanted to come out tonight and start it up," Francis said. "They were feeding us the ball from the perimeter, they're always confident in us, but they're even more confident when we're producing." 
Notre Dame continued to apply pressure on offense in the first half, capped off by a 10-2 run out of the TV timeout with 
3:36 left before halftime. Four different players -Francis, Carter, guard Kyle McAlarney and guard Colin Falls -all scored in that stretch. 
Quinn credited the forwards for Notre Dame's ability to get going early and keep the inten­sity throughout the game.

Belles seek to end 
season in top form 
By DEIRDRE KRASULA and 
BECKI DORNER 
Sports Writers 
The Belles' regular season came to a disappointing end Jan. 28, when they dropped two home meets to Albion and Calvin by scores of 119-60 and 143-59, respectively. 
However, Saint Mary's is in search of redemption -as well as a bid to the NCAA champi­onship meet -as it prepares for the MIAA Championships today through Saturday in Grand Rapids, Mich. 
The Belles have struggled this season due to the lack of a diving team. Despite this handi­cap, Saint Mary's has continued to work hard in search of both team and individual improve­ments. Coach Lynn Kachmarik said her team has been prepar­ing for this event the entire season. 
"Our goals at MIAA are to have as many personal-best times or season-best times as possible, to enjoy our last few days together and to really cher-

and made a statement at the Big East Championships that year, finishing fourth in the three­meter board. 
"It put a lot of weight and pres­sure on Scott, and he did really real well," assistant coach Matt Tallman said. "But even if he wins, and the other team puts up three divers, points-wise it's a tie. So if he doesn't win, we're already behind." 
The men's and women's divers practice together, so Coyle was the only male among several female divers who trained under diving coach Caiming Xie. 
"It was really a great experi­ence," Coyle said. "I couldn't have asked for a better experi­ence and better one-on-one attention. It was tough some­times because everything was looked under a microscope but in diving, where everything is about perfection." 
Since then, Coyle has been sur­rounded with a talented sopho­more class of Sam Stoner, Steven Crowe, Chris Kane and Mike Maggio, as well as freshman Michael Bulfin. 
"Though they sometimes 

ish our time together," she said. 
The team will look to its sen­ior captains, Katie Dingeman and Kelly Nelis, for leadership in the championships. Kachmarik said Dingman and Nelis have been excellent examples for the underclass­men all season. 
"They are outstanding role models for not only the rest of our team, but for anyone who knows them," the coach said. 
Nelis has been a force to be reckoned with throughout the season. In the Belles' final meet, the senior recorded the team's best time in the 500 freestyle, coming away with a 5:34.74 and earning second place overall. 
Although the meet, which begins at 10 a.m., is hosted by Calvin College, the events will take place some 15 miles from the Knights' Grand Rapids cam­pus. Teams will compete at Jenison High School in Georgetown Township, Mich.

change the order of finish, it's usually a freshman or sophomore who wins the event," Welsh said. 
Coyle has relished his new­found company. 
"I love it. It's great not having all the pressure on your shoul­ders ... and in practice we com­pete a lot, making us a lot bet­ter," Coyle said. "Having the competition is the best thing for pushing it to the next level." 
With less of the scoring burden on his back, Coyle has been able to focus on helping the under­classmen. 
"I think he's been very helpful to the divers ... helping them with technique, almost like a coach," Welsh said. "Scott's role is far more important than his points alone, although those are important too." 
With only one upperclassman on the squad, Coyle's assistance to the young divers' accomplish­ments indicate an even brighter future for the group. 
"My goodness, [the divers have] improved dramatically and they're learning new dives all the time," Welsh said. "We think the improvement will continue, and they have plenty of time to do that."

That game, along with her performance against Providence -when she scored 18 points and only missed one shot in 10 tries -earned her a spot on the Big East weekly Honor Roll, her first such award of the season. 
"It was a huge compliment because I thought this season has been kind of up and down for me," LaVere said. "To have a good week of basketball and be awarded that was a great honor." 
Her January scoring struggles ended at a time when the Irish were laboring to stay in the top­12 of the Big East-the cut-off for making the league tourna­ment. Notre Dame entered the Syracuse game with a record of 3-5 in conference and tied for 10th in the Big East. 
LaVere led the Irish to victo­ries in their next two contests to get back to .500, and she shot 5­of-9 from the floor in Tuesday's overtime loss to Villanova. 
LaVere's offensive emergence has provided the team with a more complete attack that it's been looking for all season. 
"We've been trying to look into the post all season, and I haven't been doing my job most of the season," LaVere said. "Now that I am [playing better] I think they are looking a little more [inside to me] because we really need a low post presence if our outside team is going to do well." 
That outside game has relied all season on Megan Duffy, the team's other co-captain and most recognized player. A pre­season All-American, Duffy has drawn the most attention from the media -and from other teams' defenses. 
"Well you know Megan's a great player, and she deserves all the press," LaVere said. "In a way, it has taken [pressure] away from me so I can come in and do a lot of stuff without all the pressure on me." 

As a co-captain with Duffy, LaVere understands her respon­sibilities and feels the two com­plement each other well on the court. 
"I think I'm supposed to pro­vide a steadiness out there, bring a lot of poise," she said. "Sometimes, if we get down or if the other team makes a run, I think I'm supposed to be the calm presence out there and keep everyone focused. Megan does a good job of leading the guards and I think I'm supposed to be that presence in the post." 
Though LaVere has been a team leader all season and con­tributed quality minutes to every game, she rarely started until last week. After starting the past three games, her total starts this season have doubled. 
"Early on in the season I was supposed to be that spark off the bench, and I think I did that," she said. "I knew since I was starting I was still supposed to, like I said, provide that spark and be an offensive threat and defensive threat when I go in." 
Despite another strong per­formance from LaVere, the Irish once again have their backs against the wall after Tuesday's loss. But the co-captain remains confident the team can still be a threat down the stretch. 
"The past couple years we've really finished strong, so I'd like to see that happen this year, you know, win the games we're sup­posed to win and maybe win the games people don't think we will," she said. "I think we need to finish strong so we have a good run going into the Big East Tournament and the NCAA Tournament."

Scarlet lettered 
Notre Dame ends losing streak with lopsided win 
By BOBBY GRIFFIN Associate Sports Editor 
It's about time. 

Notre Dame got a much-needed Big East victory in a 90-63 dis­mantling of Rutgers Wednesday. The 27-point victory was a one­point larger margin than the team's eight Big East losses com­bined. 
It has been that kind of season for the Irish, who moved to 11-10 (2-8 in the Big East) with the win. But Notre Dame coach Mike Brey was just happy to come away with a victory. 
"[When] you're in the business as long as I am, you see a little bit of everything," Brey said. "This is pretty weird though -what we've been through. I will say that. This is pretty weird. But we'll keep rid­ing on this [winl and keep build­ing." 
Irish forwards Torin Francis and Rick Cornett led Notre Dame with a strong inside presence that fueled the offense throughout the game. Francis scored 21 points

Irish divers aid In team's title hopes 
Junior Scott Coyle has been instrumental in team's recent success 
By JACK THORNTON Sports Writer 

The Irish ended the regular season ranked No. 19 in the nation -highest among Big East teams -and are favored to repeat at the Big East Championships in New York next week. And while the swimmers may get most of the headlines, Notre Dame (10-2) wouldn't be here without the recent resur­gence of the diving squad. 
"Diving is a very important part of the dual-meet season and it's going to be an important part of championship season," Irish head coach Tim Welsh said. "[Diving accounts for] two out of 13 events lin the conference championship meet]. so if you can win diving by a lot that's a huge advantage, and if you lose diving by a lot that's a big disad­vantage." 
Out of 380 possible dual-meet points this season, the young Irish team garnered 197 total points, including a crucial 29 out of 38 in a two-point team victory at Michigan State Nov. 11. 
But diving hasn't always been such a large factor in the team's success. After graduating three divers from the class of 2003, the men's team had only one diver on the roster for the 2003-04 season -then-freshman Scott Coyle.
