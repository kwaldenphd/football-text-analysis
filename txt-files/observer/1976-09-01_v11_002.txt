Sports changes also 
Administration restructured 
Restructuring in the Administra­tion and in the Athletic department has resulted in a number of changes in. key Univer.sity posi­tions. In addition, several positions left open by retiring personnel have been filled. ' 
In a move to strengthen the impact of its programs serving the Christian ministry, the University has announced the appointment of Msgr. John J. Egan, director of its Center for Pastoral and Social Ministry, as special assistant to the president. 
Egan will continue to supervise the activities of his own center, which now becomes a single agen­cy of coordination for four other programs: the Murphy Center for Liturgical Research, the Notre Dame Institute for Clergy Educa­tion, the Center for Human Devel­opment, and the Religious Leaders Program. 
As special assistant to Fr. Theo­dore M. Hesburgh, University president, Egan will represent him in relationships with outside reli­gious organizations. He will also supervise all non-University, Church-related groups which oper­ate on the Notre Dame campus, and encourage fund-raising to sus­tain all collaborative efforts be­tween the Church and the Univer­
sity. 
Coed supervisor promoted 
Sister John Miriam Jones, who joined the University Provost's office in 1972 to supervise the changeover to coeducation on the undergraduate level, has been named assistant provost. 
She succeeds Dr. William M. Burke, professor emeritus of Eng­lish, who is retiring. Burke will remain in the provost's office on a part-time basis. 
Fr. James T. Burtchaell, Univer­sity provost, said Jones would continue supervising coeducation at Notre Dame and would take on other responsibilities, including administration of joint programs with St. Mary's College. Jones will continue to teach as an assistant professor of microbiology. 
Thomas J. Mason, director for financial affairs at the University o Michigan since 1974, has been appointed vice president for busi­ness affairs at Notre Dame.· He succeeds Fr. Jerome Wilson, who is retiring after 24 years in the vice presidential post but who will remain at Notre Dame in the new position of executive administrator of physical plant. 
Wilson's service praised Mason's appointment was ap­proved by the University's trus­tees, who also praised Wilson's service to the University. During his tenure the annual operating budget increased from $10 million to $60 million and the endowment from $8 million to $100 million. Wilson was also concerned with the construction of more than 25 Uni­versity buildings, the trustees noted. 
Mason, a certified public ac­countant, received his B.S. in accounting and his M.B.A. from the University of Detroit and has taught accounting there and more rt .:ently at Eastern Michigan Uni­versity. For the last two years he has had the basic responsibility for all financial affairs of the Univer­sity Hospital in Ann Arbor, Mich. 
Dr. Emil T. Hofman, dean of the Freshman Year of Studies since 1971, will continue in that position. The appointment was made by Hesburgh, on the advice of a six-person search committee. Hof­man withdrew his resignation as dean, which was submitted last Frebruary and led to the formation of the search committee. 
Hofman, a professor of chemi­stry, will continue to teach the general chemistry course in which he has over the years develooed

SMC administration united 
by Marjorie Irr Staff Reporter 
Brian C. Regan, new assistant to the president for college relations, said yesterday that he is pleased with the ''high degree of professionalism in the new administration." 
"Under the leadership of Jack Duggan are people with energy and vision. There is unity in the administration,'' commented Regan. 
Regan is one of four administrators recently appointed by President John M. Duggan. Others are Kathleen M. Rice, dean of student affairs; Elisa Brooks, dir~ctor of admissions, and Jason D. Lindower, controller. 
Regan. a 1961 graduate of Notre Dame, had been associated with Notre Dame since 1968 as regional director of development, director, and executive assistant to the vice-presid~nt. 
At St. Mary's, Regan is responsible for public information. development, alumnae affairs, publica­tions, and spe• · ' nrograms for visitors on campus. 
He noted that keeping the alumnae informed and aware of "the college as it really is" is important for increasing alumnae support. "People should know that St. Mary's has all the class and dignity that has always b~en characteristic of this school," Regan emphasized. 
The top priority in development this year is the Athletic Facility, which is under construction on the north end of the campus. The development office is concerned specifically with financing the facility. According to Regan, $602,000 has been raised and the final figure is $1.8 million. Although no operational date has been set, the facility should be ready by spring or summer, 1977. 
Looking objectively at St. Mary's and the changes that the college has experienced in recent years, Regan said that he sees a women's college with a new identity. "St. Mary's has defined its institutional goals. It has a new vision, new goals," he said. Regan noted that the "un-merger" with Notre Dame sped up this process considerably.

ND, SMC roommate selection systems vary 
by Martha Fanning Senior Staff Reporter 
Freshman year is full of adjust­ments, such as learning to share a room with one or more students. 
Sometime  during  that  year  the  
question  "How  did  I  get  this  
roommate?" will arise.  

The processes at Notre Dame and St. Mary's College vary a great deal. . At Notre Dame the procedure is handled by Evelyn Reinebold. Each year Reinebold receives a list from admissions with names of freshmen appearing in the order of contlrmation. 
"This would be when the $100 was sent in along with the card stating what two halls the student desires,'' explained Reinebold. 
Going down the list, Reinebold works with a freshman's first or second choice uritil those halls are full. Once these choices are closed, she tries to put that individual in a dorm similar to their preference. 
The pairing of roommates is primarily a random process. If a student makes a special request, an attempt to honor it is make. "Sometimes students request a smoker or non-smoker, a certain floor or a specific person," remarked Reinebold. In addition, students may also make certain requests due to medical reasons. 
Fee'dback from students usually comes via the telephone. "This is mostly from students who did not receive their first or second choice," observed Reinebold. "Of course not everyone can get their choice." 
She continued, "It would be nice to have additional information about the students, but it would be a more time consuming process. It's good to get students with 
different interests together,"  she  
conCluded.  
The  selection  of  housing  for  

freshmen is done in a specific period of time. The list of confirmed students is received by housing around July 1st. the process must be completed and contracts returned to the freshmen by Aug. 1. 
At St. Mary's, the roommate selection process begins in March. Stevie Wernig, Assistant Dean of Student Affairs, stated, "We send out housing preference forms around Spring break, when more time is available to us.'' 
Each form requests students to state their dormitory preference, and what type of room they would like. Other questions involve whether or not the freshman prefers a smoker or non-smoker. Then preferred study hours, and how the student keeps a room. 
These forms are then returned to SMC, and the students' requests are dealt with on a first come first serve basis.

WASHINGTON (AP) --Rep. Wayne L. Hays, whose "personal relationship" with Elizabeth Ray sparked a Capitol Hill sex scandal, is resigning from Congress effect­ive Sept. 8, reliable sources said yesterday. 
The House Ethics Committee went into closed session late in the day and there was some specula­tion it would vote to terminate its payroll-sex investigation of the Ohio Democrat if he is no longer a congressman. 
Hays' resignation was submitted in a letter to House Speaker Carl Albert and presumably also to the House Ethics Committee, one source said. 
Hays' press secretary, Carol Clawson, said his resignation from Congress is being considered "but no firm decision has been made." 
His resignation would not affect Justice Department and federal grand jury investigations of the charge. 
The Ethics Committee voted Monday to begin hearings Sept. 16 despite a plea from Hays' aides

Albert --that he is too mentally depressed to defend himself. 
All the investigations focus on the accusation by Elizabeth Ray, a 33-year-old platinum blond, that Hays kept her on the House Administration Committee payroll to provide him with sexual favors. Hays was the former chairman of the committee. 
Hays immediately asked for the House Ethics Committee investi­gation, which he said would exon­erate him. 
Hays admitted having a "per­sonal relationship" with Miss Ray, but insisted she performed com­mittee work to earn her $14,000 a year salary. 
However, Hays said in an inter­view before he dropped his re-elec­tion campaign three weeks ago that one reason was that "I don't want to give that woman a chance to make another appearance.'' 
The payroll-sex charge forced Hays earlier to resign as chairman of the Administration Committee and of the Democratic Congress­ional Campaign Committee.

forms in together." 
This year the procedure was handled differently in some cases due to an overacceptance of 100 freshmen. Wernig explained that several lounges, study areas, and classrooms were converted to 
accommodate the extra freshmen. "St. Mary's doesn't like to force triples," Wernig related. "In a lot of rooms it is not feasible. It's a choice between furniture and students." St. Mary's freshmen class numbers 500 students, 480 on campus residents. This amount allows them to use a more time­consuming method, with 1711 freshmen would find difficult. 
Wernig remarked that she prefers this system of choosing roommates rather than employing a computer. "We learn a lot about the students and it's more person­al," she concluded.

Test of Battle 
The job of The Observer's editorial page is to tell everyone else at the University and the College how to do his job. 
A newspaper, in addition to reporting the news as fairly and accurately as possible, has the duty to provide a forum for debate about isues concerning the rommunity. This forum is the editorial page and it deals in doubts. Doubts and questions are needed to rip away the illusions of infallibility to which people, 
especially those in power, are prone.
The core of this page should be controversy. Only relentless debate can test the continuing validity of old ideas. Competition and controversy challenges old doctrines and brings forth new ideas. These in tum must face the test of battle-which must be the test of truth until men become infallible. Contro­
test of truth at this university, insofar as education here transcends rote and mental regurgitation. It will be the test on this page. 
Debate and controversy appear in four forms here: editorials, columns, cartoons, and let­ters. A brief word about each may avoid future 
confusion: 
Editorials represent the opinions of a majority of the Editorial Board. Board members are listed on the masthead at the top of the page (so you know whom to praise or blame). One editor usually produces a first 
draft and circulates it among the other editors who often insist on changes. So, since editorials are a group effort, they are not signed by individual editors.

The Answer to Crime 
iiii;iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii art buchwaI d 
W ASIDNGTON Howard Ander­son of Cambridge, Mass., has just come up with the ultimate solution to violent crime. The answer is "non-violent crime." The problem as Howard sees it is that society expects people who commit street crimes to completely reform and after their punishment commit no crimes at all. 
fhe idea would be for the Harvard Business School, the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, the YaleLaw School and other institu­tions of higher learning to set up courses in state and federal prisons where criminals could be taught the skills of committing "white-col­
.
ar cnmes. " 
The curriculum would include accounting, banking, stock market
fraud, bribery, kickbacks and em­bezzlement. The teachers would explain the advantages of "white­collar crime" over street crimes. The average take for a street crime in the United ~ta~es is $9.?5. For the work and risk mvolved It hardly

But white-collar ~riminals have 
the opposite effect on everyone. A 
man who has embezzled a million 
dollars from widows-and orphans is 
one to be looked up to and 
respected. 
An officer of a large corporation who is involved in stock fraud is considered a pillar of his commun­ity and can get hundreds of people to testify to his good character. 
A president of a bank who steals his depositors' money is usually forgiven by everyone BEFORE the trial. 
A-politician who has been arrest­ed for accepting bribes or selling judgeships is always addressed as "sir" by the police. 
The people in jails could be persuaded that the same amount of time it takes to mug an old lady in the park could be spent arranging for a municipal contract to be given to a corrupt builder or a bribe-pay­ing road contractor. 
To convince them, the course would include lectures by judges who could describe the lightness of sentences meted out to white-collar criminals. Bus tours could be arranged to "open-air" prisons where .white-collar criminals are sent for punishement. 
There would be lectures by ex-white-collar cons on how to seek the best legal advice after they are caught. 
The beauty of Anderson's plan is that it does not ask a criminal to give up his trade. All it does is teach the convict socially accept­able methods of committing crimes that do not annoy the public. 
When the average street crime convict discovers how much money there is in white-collar crime, and how little risk there is in getting punished, we can expect a dramatic drop in street crime, which is the only type that seems to shake anyone up in this country.

Moses Needed 10 
Dear Editor: I was interested to read in Dean Roemer's column last week that the University needs only nine com­mandments. This beats out Moses· he needed ten. Of course for the last 3,000 years Jews and Christ­tians have been trying to figure out what Moses' ten really mean. Will it take that long to figure out Roemer's nine?

Necro Lib 
Dear Editor: 
It has come to our attention that certain members of the Notre Dame community feel oppressed by their sexual· identity. In this new era of openness we feel it is time for necrophiliacs to step out of the shadows. Though we ourselves are straight, we think these people should be accepted for what they are, with Christian compassion and understanding. 
Contrary to popular myth, these people are quite capable of lasting relationships based on love and personal growth. Unfortunately, society has condemned necrophil­iacs to a life of exploitation and furtive one night stands. Many are tired of the artificiality of the

fr. burtchaell: 
a uer~ piuotal position 

Fr. James T. Burtchaell, C.S.C., often outspoken and controversial, begins his seventh year as Provost at the University of Notre Dame. This interview was conducted by Features Editor Tim O'Reiley. 
OBSERVER: Could you broadly define the role and functions of the provost In this university? BURTCHAELL: I suppose the most import­ant role of the provost should be the cheif academic officer: to provide leadership in everything that's academic here, to organize the work of the different colleges, to appoint the faculty, to provide some sort of initiative in improving our curriculum, the level and standards of our studies. Another responsi­bility the provost has is to serve as a link between the president and the other vice-presidents whose work is directly educational-that would include the vice­president for advanced studies and vice­president for student affairs. 
A great deal is made of public announce­ments that the provost serves as the acting president in the absence of the president. Actually, that is of very minor significance. Whether Fr. Hesburgh is on campus or not, our organization is such that it runs rather smoothly and regularly. While we are in constant consultation with him, there are very rare occasions when the function of acting president makes any difference. OBSERVER: How complete is your control of academic policy? BURTCHAELL: Control is probably not a very useful notion to pursue. Very few people or groups of people at the University have a lot of control over anyone. The University is more a place where influence and initiative would count. Technically, the provost is responsible for everything aca­demic here, but of course I can't control very many things at all. 
I would think that the higher a person is in the scheme of things, the more opportunities there are to have one's ideas heard. I think that's a more important thing than control. In a university, even though someone may have technical control, unless that person succeeds in persuading a large portion of the constituency that something is wise, it can't be imposed anyway. So, responsibility around here carries with it an ability to have a wide hearing for what you think is correct, rather than simply the ability to direct something. Most policies around here are made by groups, though individuals are still in a position to make some policies. OBSERVER: What would the link between Fr. Hesburgh and 'other vice-presidents entail? 
BURTCHAELL:We have quite a number of 
vice-presidents, but our arrangement is that 
the provost and executive vice-president 
deal directly with Fr. Hesburgh. We in turn 
deal directly with the other vice-presidents, 
and in my case, deans and directors, who 
don't report directly to the president. It 
means that the president doesn't have to 
deal with literally dozens of officers around 
the University. I· suppose these two 
positions are very pivotal, that of provost for 
everything educational, and that of execu­
tive vice-president for everything financial. 
OBSERVER: Your popular image on 
campus, justly or unjustly, is sort of that of 
the iron man, often a scheming one. Do you 
think it is just, and that it helps or detracts 
from your duties at all? 
BURTCHAELL: I think that anybody in a 
position of public responsibility, who dwells 
very much on his public image. will tend to 
make decisions which are too intended to 
support the public image, and not intended 
to satisfy his or her responsibility. The 
public image of the provost probably 
concerns me less than some others. 
I believe that where one'sJesponsibility is exercised through discussion and initiative and argumentation, a great deal of the University's common good depends on the ability of leaders to be candid, honest, and fair. · 
At a time when universities have had to go through some trials and some unexpected stringencies, not all the messages that come out of university offices have been encour­aging, so sometimes one is unwillingly the bearer of unhappy news. In the long run, I think that the office of academic affairs has been seen to be putting a premium on honesty about problems, while being very personal about the people who have to cope with them. 
after graduation. How does In loco parentis fit this Idea of a university education? BURTCHAELL: The meaning of in loco parentis for which neither I nor anyone else around here has any use is that students at the University of Notre-Dame are to be considered as having less maturity than they actually have, and it's the function of the University to exercise over them a sort of authority one would over junior high school students. That has never been the meaning of the word that attracted me. 
However, I do think that, in another sense, the university is very much in loco parentis. Parents of children who are between 18 and 22 don't care any less for them than they did five or ten years earlier, nor are they concerned any less, although they have much less say-so over what those children do. If anything, it's exactly at that age that parents see their performance as very tell-tale and very significant about what kind of parents they were. So they care very earnestlv about how their children act, while they ad.mit, sometimes gracefully, some­times not so gracefully, that these children are moving a little beyond their reach. 
At most universities, that feeling is not present. But at Notre Dame it is. I think that teachers, administrators and staff here feel very personally involved in the develop­ment of students. If students fail or succeed wonderfully, we feel the same kind of disappointment or pride that parents would. So, rather than being a term that refers to authoritarianism, in loco parentis really refers to the ironic and frustrating situation of both parents and senior people here at Notre Dame, who have a great stake in the personal integrity and maturity of younger people they are responsible for, yet don't have very strong contro!•over what they do. 
I suppose on the other hand that the university insists that students are not in control of the university. The senior people are in control of the University, therefore students are guests here in the way I suppose many students feel they are guests at home when they go home to visit. There are no more welcome guests. But the judgment and values of the older people here are more depended upon than those of the students' to continue the traditions that 1make this campus worthwhile. OBSERVER: Then you place more emphasis on guidance and counsel than on Oat rules? BURTCHAELL: I think the two go together. In some respects the University can lay down rules that touch the edges of people's activity. In other respects, t:ules are entirely inappropriate and example is appropriate. In other respects, advice and counsel. And in still further respects, a simple expose of various alternatives. , OBSERVER: Could the 8 a.m. exam be a part of In loco parentis? BURTCHAELL: No, I don't think it has much to do with it at all. Over the course of recent years, there has been a slow increment of academic activities in the vening hours. This resulted from the inability to find any time during the day that was sufficiently free to be able to schedule an event that many people would be able to attend. Gradually, students found that their nighttime hours were being occupied as much by scheduled events as the daytime hours. Other activities, cultural events, studies, student activities meetings, were being p~shed further into the evening hours. 

~­
After a great deal of discussion, · it 
occurred to us to try to clear out the evening 
hours and give them back to the students. 
The only way to do this was to establish 
some free space during the daytime when 
departmental exams could take place. We 
found the most free periods to be the 
beginning period on Tuesday and Thursday. 
OJJSERVER: Should this policy prove 
undesirable, when will It be reviewed? 
BURTCHAELL: We don't have adequate 
opportunity to see it at work until we carry it 
through for a full year. 
OBSERVER: For the past several years, a 
major controversy has erupted over the 
calendar. Do you foresee that again this 
year? 

BURTCHAELL: I've given up prognosticat­
ing about the calendar. The only thing I can 
say is that I won't bring it up again. I think 
we have right now t~!e best possible 
calendar, with almost a month's winter 
break, a break in each semester where 
anybody has enough time to go home 
without absenting themselves on either end 
of the break, while having the time for 
shorter Thanksgiving and Easter breaks. 
One of the prices we pay is coming to school 
in August. But the trend among colleges 
and universities is making that an ordinary 
thing. I don't think there is that much 
dissatisfaction that will make another review 
likely. 

OBSERVER: Then you've struck an 
adequate compromise between all parties? 
BURTCHAELL: I don't know that it is a 
compromise. This is the calendar I've 
argued for for five years. 
Compromise isn't always the best way to 
see your way through problems. Some­
times, testing various alternatives is the way 
to allow the community to decide that one or 
the other of the alternatives is really the 
better one. _ 
OBSERVER: Another coming problem could Involve coUectlve bargaining with the . faculty. Do you tblnk this would greatly change the faculty·adminlstratlon, faculty­
student relationships? 
BURTCHAELL: Yes, it would certainly 
involve very significant changes. There are 
now many thousands of college teachers who

operate under union contract. But so far, no research university of significant quality has voted for unions. Unions started in junior colleges and spread to schools that were not very academically distinguished. Up to this point, collective bargaining has been attrac­tive to faculty who felt that corporate pressure was more likely to bring them 
added benefits than would professional, individual excellence. We have had long discussions on collective bargaining here, and I think polls have so far shown that if the question were put to the faculty now, that collective bargaining would be rejected. It is something we will all be watching very closely. 
OBSERVER: A number of ramps to 
buildings and on sidewalks have been bullt 
to help the handicapped. 
BURTCHAELL: Yes, that is the direct 
result of some wonderful work done 
throughout the course of last year by a 
committee of administrators and students. 
The University spent a significant portion 
of its summer renovation money to make 
buildings accessible to physically handi­
capped persons. We are a long way from 
the completion of that project, but the 
improvements this summer indicate an 
intention to make the campus more 
accessible to persons in wheelchairs or 
those who can walk only with great 
difficulty. I hope that more students who 
have been kept away by these obstacles, 
will now want to come. 
OBSERVER: What do you think would 
persuade the state legislature to lower the 
drinking age? 
BURTCHAELL: I don't know. The 
legislature is very reasonably concerned 
about traffic safety if the drinking age is 
lowered. From our point of view, safety 
might be increased if people weren't 
journeying to watering spots in southern 
Michigan and coming back. 
Also, I really think that the key to this is not where people drink or at what age it becomes legal, but the character and mood in which people drink. Frankly, I've always said, and it wasn't just fantasy or spoof, that I would just as soon have beer available in the dining halls along with milk andCoke. If we could see that it is a beverage that mature people use because they like it, and see·it as no unusual thing. then people would probably drink more responsibly. OBSERVER: This is probably the most famous Catholic campus In the world. Do you feel that the spiritual cOndition of the student body Is good? BU~TCHAELL: By self choice, a large portion of our students are Catholic. Also faculty and administration are predom­inantly Catholic. But in another sense, the University is not nearly Catholic enough. At the age of 18, one has rarely had the need or experience of coming to terms with what will be done with his or her life. So you could say that 95 per cent of our students arrive here perfunctorily Catholic, and it is the work of a lifetime to make that something serious. 
There are many evenh in the Un~e~ sity's past which show that despite the 
unhesitating allegiance by all constituen­
cies here to Catholicism, we were adhering 
to and embodying some of the narrowest,

Hope receives funds 
A model program at 
Notre Dame which trains elderly and middle-aged people to work with those older people whose problems are not being handled by a service agency has received funding for the second year through a five-year grant. 
The Help Outreach Prograt)l for the Elderly (HOPE) received $58,044 from the Experimental and Special Training Branch of the National Institutes of Mental Health. 
The program is the only one of its kind in the country to be funded by NIMH as a model for future development in the mental health field, according to its director, Dr. John F. Santos, Notre Dame pro­fessor of psychology. 
Its primary emphasis is _j)n training personnel already em­ployed in work with the aged. Among the agencies which have been represented by trainees are REAL Services, Healthwin Hos­pital, Catholic Services, RSVP (Re­tired Senior Volunteer Program), the Elkhart County Home and tries, we are not separated from our neighbors by barbed wire fences or border gates.''

''This is fairly intensive training for outreach workers," Santos said. ''The important thing to under­stand about the elderly is that their problems usually come in clusters. We try to prepare these outreach workers to deal with a wide spectrum of problems," he said. While mental health is the primary concern, an important part of the outreach worker's job is recognizing problems and knowing how to bring programs and people together.

BURTCHAELL: I was much influ­enced by our work on the Commit­tee on University Priorities. For one thing, we are laying plans for very serious fund raising, which is essential to our continued existence and growth. Also, we are devoting a lot of attention to improvements in the teaching tradition. My own private thought is that independent exertions on the part of students cim be drawn upon more than they are now. OBSERVER: What do you see as your future? 
BURTCHAELL: Never gave it a thought. OBSERVER: Never? Do you see yourseH continuing as provost? BURTC~LL: I want to continue as a priest, and live in Dillon Hall, to say Mass there and teach theology, to do some writing and publishing. Those things I can aspire to with some sense of permanence.

African bishop charged 
Donald Lamont, Roman Catholic bishop of Umtali, Rhodesia, has been charged with failing to report the presence of guerillas, according to a Washington Post article of Aug. 27, 1976. 
Lamont, who has spoken at Notre Dame on three occasions, "was charged less than two weeks after he publicly suggested that church officials might be justified in aiding guerillas who seek help," the Post article stated. 
The charges usually carry the death penalty upon conviction, the Post noted, but a lighter sentence is expected since they are to be heard in the Umtali magistrate's court Sept. 14. ·

WASHINGTON (AP) -The Soviet Union has purchased an additional 275,000 metric tons of 
U.S. wheat, but the sale is not expected to hike domestic food prices, Agriculture Department of­ficials said yesterday. 
The Soviet Union, still feeling the effects of the drought that reduced last year's harvest, pur­chased the wheat under an agree­ment which takes effect with deliveries this fall, department officials said. 
The wheat's value was placed at $34.6 million. The Agriculture Department said the ,latest sale raised to more than 
4.6 million tons the amount of wheat and c0rn sold to Russia under the five-year agreement. A

meetings are being sponsored by Notre Dame's Center for Pastoral and Social Ministry to help develop a richer pastoral theology. 
Fifty parish teams, made up of a priest, sister and lay person and representing the diversity of par­ishes across the country, have been invited to participate. A group of bishops, theologians, scholars from other disciplines, and representa· tives of national organizations in­terest.ed in parish ministry has been 'invited to observe. 
The convocation will consist of several workshop sessions based on presentations which will include "Forming a Community of Faith," by Drs. Evelyn and James Wl>ite­head, directors of the Field Educa­tion Program at Moreau Seminary, Notre Dame; ''The Mission of the Local Church" by Rev. John Shea, St. Mary of the Lake Sf) .inary, Mundelein, Ill., and "Minit ries of the Local Church" by R~ . Josh Alves, permanent deacon, Arch­diocese of Chicago. The final session, "Convocation on Parish Ministry," will be a critique and 
reflection by a panel of the ob­servers. 
Plans for this meeting began with a survey of some 500 parishes, which were questioned about their "mission" statements, goals, pro­grams, and shortcomings as well as accomplishments. Msgr. John J. Egan, director of the Center, said he was looking for parishes where the teachings of Vatican II and liturgical research were being im­plemented on the local level and across a broad spectrum.

Under the agreement, Russia is supposed to buy six million to eight million tons of wheat and corn annually. 
Department officials say .U.S. harvests this year will be large enough to supply grain to the Soviet Union and other foreign buyers without causing food pri­ces to soar. 
The department 01d not disclose the seller of the grain or other details. Grain sales to fordgn countries, including Russia are handled by private firms. No U.S. government credit has been in­volved in recent sales to the Soviets. 
-Moscow can buy more than eight million tons a year if U.S. officials approve the sale. However, Soviet grain harvest prospects are im­proved this year and department experts say the Russian purchases may not exceed eight million tons. 
To date, the Soviets have bought 1,971,000 tons of wheat worth an estimated $248.3 million under the 
terms of the agreement. In addition there have been sales of 2,653,000 tons of corn, at an estimated value of $307.7 million. 
The Soviets also have purchased about 1.5 millions tons of soybeans worth an estimated S360 million 
from this year's crop. Soybeans are not included in the long-term agreement. 
Russia was forced to buy U.S. grain last year when its 1975 grain harvest dropped to 139.9 millions tons, the smallest in a decade. 
. . 
Department experts have estima­ted 1976 grain Soviet output at 1975 million tons, but say Russia will continue to need to import grain. 
After large purchases last sum­mer, the Ford administration shut off further grain sales to the Soviet Union and worked out the five-year agreement for future shipments. 
The temporary embargo was lifted when the new long-term agreement was announced last Oct. 20, but many farmers complained that the administration actions caused grain prices to decline..
