FLOC plans campaign against Campbell's, Libby's 
by Tim Vercellotti StaffReporter 
The Farm Labor Organization Committee (FLOC) met last night to discuss plans for the planned referendum concern­ing a boycott of products manu­factured by Campbell's Soup and Libby's. 
The group, which is campaign­ing for the rights of migrant farm workers in northwestern Ohio, is plannints a campus­wide publicity blitz from now until Feb. 25, the date of the Referendum. The campaign consist of posters in the various campus buildings and pamph­lets to be distributed by FLOC members in the residence halls. 
FLOC believes this publicity is needed to get the 1,013 signa­tures required to bring the issue to a vote by Notre Dame students. These petitions will be available in the dining halls at lunch and dinner late next week. 
The proposed boycott is a means of applying pressure to companies that receive their produce from farms in Ohio. According to Anne Huber, a spokeswoman for FLOC, these canning companies set a certain price that they will pay the farmers for their crops. 
This set amount of money is then used to pay the migrant workers. Unfortunately, the t:.nion that represents the farmworkers has no say in what the annual price will be, and

WASHINGTON (AP) -President Carter will call for the registration of women for the military draft, White House officials said yesterday. 
The White House scheduled an announcement for today detailing the president's plans for the entire draft ree-istration program. 
The president's proposal, disclosed by officials who asked not to be identified, is a sharp break 
1-with historical precedent. It will be the first time that a president has suggested registering women for the draft. Carter decided to include women in the program despite a warning from House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill that it would not pass the Congress. The president probably will limit re~istration to persons 19 and 20, though full details were not 


FBI claitns strong evidence against N.J. Senator Williams 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The federal case against Sen. Harri­son A. Williams Jr. was descri-~ bed yesterday as among the strongest in the FBI's political bribery investigation which has implicated eight members of Congress. 
As FBI agents interviewed members of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, which figured in the allegations against Williams, the House of Representatives turned its at­tention to the ethics of the manner in which the FBI con­ducted its 16-month inquiry. 
In advance of the House floor debate, FBI Director William Webster told an Oklahoma City news conference his agency had ''followed the rules of law'' in its undercover operations. He denied any entrapment of mem­bers of Congress. 
Allegations have been made against as many as 20 public officials and 10 businessmen 
after FBI undercover agents, 
posing as wealthy Arabs or 
representatives of Arab inter­
ests, paid nearly $500,000 in 
cash in exchange for promises of political favors and other 
serv1ces. 
Webster said the law allows use of deception when there is evidence of a predisposition to commit a crime. "We follow criminality,'' he said W ednes­day. "We do not target individuals. We do not target institutions.... We have no interest in testing any public officials. · 
Williams, a New Jersey Demo­crat, is reported to have told FBI agents on videotape that Joseph Lordi, chairman of the casino commission, helped him save $3 million for developers of the Ritz hotel-casino project in Atlantic City. Lordi and Williams have denied involve­ment in such a deal. 
In addition, government sour­ces said last weekend that Williams last August had ac­cepted stock in a titanium mine in return for a promise to help obtain government contracts for a venture backed by an Arab 
Age 19-20 
Carter calls for female registration 
made available. 
Carter announced plans last month in his State of the Union message to resume draft registra­tion, citing an increasing military threat from the Soviet Union. 
Although he remained mum on the question of whether he would include women, he has previously taken the position that any such program should include women. 
In recent weeks, Carter's decision has been foreshadow~ by statements from administra­tion officials and the president's wife, Rosalynn, who urged registration of women. 
Currently, there are about 150,000 women in the military, out ofa force of more than 2 milion. However, women still are banned by law from combat. 
sheik. 
_Officially, sources close to the investigation say all eight mem­bers of Congress remain sub­ject to possible grand jury action, although the govern­ment considers its case against Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., to be the weakest. 
Williams was reported in the Washington Star and the New York Daily News to oe a strong target for federal prosecution. Quoting unnamed Justice De­partment sources, the papers also listed Reps. Michael My­ers, D. Pa., and Richard Kelly, R-Fla. 
The Star said other strong cas~s were being prepared agamst Reps. John Jenrette, D-S.C., and Raymond Lederer, D-Pa. Instead of those two, the Daily News listed Reps. Frank Thompson Jr., D-N.J., and Jo~n Murphy, D-N.Y., as other pnme targets. 
CAP seeks to diversify Arts and Letters program 
by Michael Lewis Executive News Editor 
Citing what they term "bore­

dom and stagnation'' with the 
Notre Dame Arts and Letters 
program, a few AL majors are 
initiating a discussion of ways 
to improve intellectual life at 
the University. 
Terry Keely and Ken Scarbor­

ough, two leaders of the effort, 
said last night that some AL 
majors are "a bit bored" with 
the regular curriculum. These 
students, they assert, could 
benefit from additions to the 
regular curriculum, which 
would be designed to increase 
faculty-student discussion and 
bring the Arts _and Letters 

disciplines together. 
Thomas Jemielity, director of the Committee on Academic Progress (CAP), said yesterday that the CAP has been con­cerned about this problem for some time. 
Jemielity called this "bore­dom" a "fairly widespread phenomenon among serious­minded students.'' When asked about how many students felt frustrated with the Arts and Letters curriculum, Jemielity replied, "More than I would prefer. It's not an uncommon complaint.'' 
Keely and Scarborough said that academic pressures on both students and faculty at­tribute to their sense of frusta­tion. Keely stated that there needs to be a ''change in emphasis" away from the GPA and credit ·hours. 
Scarborough said that, at the freshman and sophomore lev­els, "The only intellectual rela­tionship a student has is be­tween his books and his notes.'' From a professor's standpoint,Jemielity said th<jl an emphasis on research and publications 
takes away from the faculty's time and inclination for free discussion with students. 
Scarborough, a sophomore 

CAP member, said that a 
synthesis of the various liberal 

arts disciplines is needed. 
Keely, a junior and spokesper­son for the group, said, ''Peo-­ple are just frustrated with their classes .. .It seems purposeless after a while." 
Several students met with faculty members last week to discuss ideas to combat their feeling of stagnation. Another meeting is scheduled for Feb. 21 at 7 p.m. in room 104 O'Shaughnessy. All students are invited to discuss the Uni­versity's intellectual life at that meeting. 
At last week's meeting, the group discussed the establish­ment of a new course, a faculty-student lounge, and a scholarly student journal. 
The idea of a student/faculty lounge is not new. Jemielity noted that the college used to sponsor a ''coffee hour'' for students and professors to min­gle and discuss current issues. 
Ideally, the lounge would fur­nish a place where students and faculty could come and go as they pleased, and discuss any­thing. Keely noted that, since all students and faculty could use the lounge, discussions could take an inter-disciplinary approach to issues. 
The course, if initiated, would consist of a small group of students examining an intel­lectual problem of their choice under the direction of a profes­sor. A paper would be pub­lished at the .end of the course as a kind of "mini-disserta­tion.'' 
The journal, if formed; would ideally be another examination of a problem from an inter-dis­ciplinary viewpoint. Students could select a topic, then pro­vide essays, research, poetrv, photography, and other talen'ts to complete the work. 
Keely and Scarborough noted that these ideas are only at the discussion stage, and invited all students to participate. The Feb. 21 meeting is designed both as a "brainstorming ses­sion and as a way to deter­mine student interest. 
Jemielity s.1id that, although the CAP is involved in this discussion, all students should participate. 
"One of the things CAP is supposed to do is to serve as a clearing house for those ideas,'' ­he said.

Career Day attendance doubles 
by Bndget Herry 
Representatives from approx­
imately thirty Federal and State 
agencies were on hand to 
answer questions and to pro­
vide literature and application 
materials to students yesterday 
at the Placement Bureau's third 
annual Government Career 
Day. Some Departments, how­
ever, expressed confusion 
about the event.  
''This year's attendance was 
almost double last year's,"said 
Sr. Kathleen Rossman, career 
counselor. "And the 350-400 
students that attended repre­
sented a cross-section of majors 
--not necessarily in Business 
and Engineering." 
Paul J. Reynolds, Placement 
Specialist, explained that the 
Placement Bureau had sent out 
110 letters to Federal and State 
agencies and that thirty agenc­
ies --representing a wide range 
of interests --had responded. 
The Placement Bureau -distrib­
uted to each Department 
Chairperson a packet contain­
ing notices for each faculty 
member in the Department as 
well as other pertinent 'mater­
ial, such as information con­
cerning the PACE test. 
Donald Costello, Chairman of American Studies, said that he had received no information concerning the Government Ca­reer Day. Charles Wilber.· Chairman of Economics, said that he ''had never heard a thing," but explained that "things had been hectic in the Department," and that it was wholly possible that a notice had been received. He added that he wished that he had known about it: "It is exactly the kind of thing we've been wanting to have." 
Konrad Schaum, Chairman Modern Languages, said ti. he supported the program, b that he had not actively enco1· aged his students to alten "We have only thirty 'fir~ majors'," he explained. ·'Wt are so close to our majots hat we wouldn't need something 1.jke that." 
fhe Chairman of the Govern­mcr.t Department, Perry Ar­nold said that he viewed the Publl<;; Service Careers Day very posiuv.ely. He emphasized, howevtt. that the program's benefit '".S predominantly in an inforl"lation-providing ca­pacity. He explained the rigid­ity of the gwernment employ­ment systet!l\, citing the re­quired Civil Service Exam and the Merit principle. 
Arnold added that it is so difficult for a student to get information --especiaJty about Government agencies --that "this kind of meeting is invalu­able." 
Arnold said that a surprising number of agencies attended, but that he would like to see more State and local agenc:es -­especially from trr: 'llidwestern area --represented. 
Reynolds explained that it was difficult to interest state and local agencies in a career day at Notre Dame because the stu­dent body is regionally diversi­fied. He said that most state agencies prefer to recruit at state universities. 

The program sponsored in the Fall was career-information or­iented, Reynolds said. "But today we identified each agency and representatives did re­cruit." 
David Fogleman, representing the Naval Avionics Center, said that he meant to interest En­gineer and Science majors in both Summer Employment and post-graduate work. He said 
that he had run out of applica­tions earlier in the day, and was taking names of interested stu­dents for future correspond­ance. 
Both Nora Bader of the Social Security Administration (Great Lakes Program Service Cen­ters) and Ruby Holmes of the Department of Health, Educa­
tion and Welfare Social Security Administration said that they were actively recruiting. Reg­istering for examinations was their first concern, they ex­plained. But they were also promoting summer programs and college work/ study pro­grams.

In an attempt to improve the secunty along the main drive between Saint !\1arv's and Notre Dame. SMC sec.uritv has erected a new building ~hich will serve as humebase for the new Saim Mary's foot patrol, according to Tracy McAuliffe of Public Information. 
Security guards now patrol the Saint Mary's portion of the drive concentraong on the front area of the campus, she added. The security building is lo­cated near the main entrance to Saint Mary's. "This provides the patrolmen with a good view · of Saint Mary's drive and a

He abo said that securitv uses the building as a base, so that, if the building is unoccupied, the security guard is patrolling along the road. 
Saint Marv's is also consider­ing improv~ments in the light­ing along the main drive to provide greater protection for the students, McAuliffe said.

NAZZ schedules perfornters for Mardi Gras entertainment 

by Barbara Bn'dges 

Notre Dame's talent show­case, the NAZZ, is gearing up for a busy semester by spot­lighting entertainers at next week's Mardi Gras festivities. 
The musical performers sche­duled for Mardi Gras include Brian McHale, and Gene Bar­banera on Monday night, the country and light rock tunes of "The Rubber Band" on Tues­day, along with the duo att of Rich Stevenson and Dan Bere­nato. Doug Strin~er will appear on Wednesday mght. 
Mary Ahern, student director of the NAZZ, has plans for this semester which include the "NAZZ Music Competition" on March 7, ''Lunchtime Con­certs" in La Fortune Student Center on Friday afternoons, and ''Open Stage'' nights where students may perform on stage in the NAZZ basement. 
The upcoming "NAZZ Music Competition" will be a major entertainment evening in the basement of La fortune. Appro~imately 15 acts will be presented and judged for cash prizes. In the past, this compe­tition has been held on rwo consecutive nights. 
This year, the entertainment 
Olympic hopefuls ponder boycott 
by Gary Cuneen 

If the Soviet Union does not abandon Afghanistan, would you be in favor of boycotting the 1980 Olympics? This question is being asked to many Olympic hopefuls and is becoming de­creasingly hypothetical as the Soviets continue penetrating Afghanistan. 
According to President Car­ter's February 20 deadline for the evacuation of all Soviet troops, American athletes, as well as athletes from other countries supporting Carter's strategy, will be confronted with the painful circumstances of not competing in the Olympic Games. This harsh reality could affect numerous dedicated athletes, and a few prospective Olympic athletes are sitting in 
our  backyard  here  at  Notre  
Dame.  
Tony Hatherly,  a  Canadian­ 

born long-distance runner ho­ping to get his opportunity to try out for Canada's Olympic team, reacts strongly against the boycott proposed by Presi­dent Carter. "I think it's unfair for the athletes. I don't think the Olympics should be made into a political circus. Econom­ic boycotts would serve a stronger purpose." 
Although Hatherly wishes to compete in the 5000 meter run representing Canada, he symp­athizes with the Amencans more than any other athletes. "It (the boycott) would be hurting the United States more than any other country because the U.S. has the best chance to win.'' 
Tracy Jacks"" a rotential member of the U.S. b :1-~:tball team who is mu h mo, _· con­cerned with tl· .emainder of Notre Dame's L.l!lsketball sea­son than with whether or not he'll make the Olympic team, has similar views concerning the boycott issue, but maintains that the government's decision will protect our athletes. 
'fi"f'"r7YPDi mzc f£ =ssc·m-az 
"If I were a member of the team, I would want to plav and be against the boycott. For us to boycott would be disappoint­ing to some athletes, but would benefit all of us. We'd be risking our lives in Moscow, and the government wants to protect us. That's one of the main reasons the government is involved." 
In addition, Jackson empathi­zes with the other athletes par~i~ipating in less glamorous mdiVldual sports. "They've been training for four or more years and it makes them feel like they've been robbed." 
The situation is mentally an­guishing for the athletes in­volved, but the consensus of most American athletes is that they will stand behind their government's decision, even though they would be sacrific­ing years of training and Olym­pic dreams. 
The sacrifice is an immense one indeed, but as Jackson acknowledged, ''If something happened like the killing of the Jews (in the 1972 Munich Olympics), we could never for­give ourselves for sending our athletes over." 
NY judge overrules IOC; Taiwanese may carry flag 
LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP)-A New York state judge ruled yesterday that an athlete from Taiwan must be allowed to carry the island nation's tradi­tional red-and-blue flag at the opening Wednesday of the 1980 Winter Olympics. 
In a decision handed down in nearby Plattsburgh, Justice Norman L. Harvey said the Lake Placid Olympic Organi­zing Committee may not stop Liang Ren-Guey, a Nordic skier from Taiwan, from usin~ the flag of the Republic of Chma. 
In effect, the Judge overruled the policy of the International Olympic Committee, which re­cently admitted the People's Republic of China into the Olympic family and told Taiwan that tt would have to adopt a new flag and anthem. The IOC also said the Taiwan group would have to go by the name Chinese Taipei Olympic Com-­
mittee.  
The  Lake  Placid  group  had  
been  abiding  by  the  IOC' s  
policy.  

Monique Belioux, evecutive director of the IOC, said the judge's decision would be ap­pealed. It was not immediately clear, though, whether the Lake Placid Olympic Committee--the defendant in the suit--planned further action. 
Michael Lee, secretary-gener­al of the Republic of China Olympic Committee, could not immediately be reached for comment. 
However, only hours before the decision, he told The Asso­ciated Press he had faith in the 
U.S. Judicial system. 
"We are confident of a favor­able rulin~ because discrimina­tion is agamst your principles,'' he said. "We are the same Chinese, but we have received different treatment. We are the victims of political discrimina­tion.'' 
Lee, attache Kon-Son Ha an-d five athletes Including Liang were rejected at the accredita­tion center ·of the Olympics Village on Wednesday when they arrived at the shed-like structure to apply for housing and credentials. 
will be packed into one evening to insure the continuity and excitement of the event. Inter­ested participants will be given the opportunity to apply during February 18 through 27. 
Once again, the NAZZ will sponsor an "Open Stage" night each week so that anyone may stop by to perfor music, come­dy, or drama. 
The NAZZ basement will also be the scene of the Senior Arts Festival during April 13 to 19. The festival will showcase ori­ginal material written by senior students. 
In the past, ''Jazz at the NAZZ" was presented with the cooperation of the Notre Dame jazz combo and the music department. There are plans to reinstate the jazz evenings this semester as they have proven to be very popular. 
The NAZZ will be more mobile this year than it has been in the past, according to Ahern. Mardi Gras and outdoor con­certs in the spring will bring performers out of the La For­tune basement. 
Furthermore, the usual Wed­nesday through Saturday Nazz activities will be dressed-up a bit this semester as new carpet­ing and a fresh paint job are scheduled for the NAZZ base­ment. The all-volunteer NAZZ staff is looking for student painters to help with the re­
nodeling, scheduled to occur in .:he next few weeks. 
Ahern says she is pleased that this semester is proving to be busier than past years. The NAZZ is drawing more per­formers and a larger audience. The Nazz enjoys the reputation of being a great opportunity for entertainment exposure, and has helped launch the pro­fessional careers /of guitarist Rick Walters and Rich Prezioso.

Editorials 

We are-cheating ourselves 
There has been much talk of equality on this campus since 1973 when the whole tradition of Notre Dame as a Catholic institution for men was blessed with the entry of women as students and a new awareness of the women faculty. Every year articles appear in The Observer in an attempt to evaluate the attitudes of stu· dents, faculty, administrators and.alumni toward women, but to little avail in terms ofaltering any present attitudes. 
So why am I contributing to the wads in the wastebasket? Perhaps it is because 1 feel so strongly that in our obstinancy to recognize the b\as and discrimination which is bred at the university, we are cheating ourselves. 
The position of the women at Notre Dame is rather dubious. We have heard it said that the women here are "stuck-up, walking encyclopedias, com­petitive,etc." Some have even gone so far as to say that women's basketball is boring. Whatever the opinion , the above are generali:.:.ttions and a gross injustice to the women at this university who do not fill such a stereotype. 
Let's get it straight. The first thing to recognize in students at this or any other institution is that we are individuals with an identity all and uniquely our own and any generalization, directed toward men or women, is burdensome and insulting to that individuality. In failing to recognize with patience and awareness the individuality of women on our campus, it is my opinion that we are indeed

The recognition of women in society independent of stereo­types offers a whole new dimension to the relationships we come in contact with every day  whether that relationship be within a business,academtc, or social/casual setting. The confrontation of men and women as individuals with something very real and constructive to offer each other in multitudinous settings is exciting and is to be encour­a~ed, not feared, shunned or dtscriminated against. 
Perhaps you are one who feels that I am just tnaking a big deal out of nothing or that this column is a bunch of rhetoric without conclusions. I sym­pathize with your conservative perspective. What I am articu­lating is this: should you be one of the many who choose to enclose yourself within the bell jar of society's traditional mores, who choose to perpet­uate the role of women as sex partners, or as having inferior status, weaker constitutions, etc., you are ·· be you mao or woman--only cheating yourself and depriving yourself of what could be a most valuable ex­perience.

How blue can you get? 
Nobody seems to have taken much notice, but two weeks ago Notre Dame e;ot a bad case of the blues. Ctting poor attend­ance and lack of interest among the student body, Student U­nion officials will reluctantly recomment to their successors that the Midwest Blues Festival be discontinued. 
From a financial point of view, this year's blues festival was a major disappointment. Only 300 students purchased tickets, and attendance among South Bend residents was dis­mal. Due to an estimated loss of $7000, the Student Union, which operates on a very limi,t. ed budget, has no other alterna­
tive  than  to  drop  the  whole  
thine;.  
Sull,  it  was  student apathy  

more than economic austerity that killed the Midwestern Blues Festival. Most ND-SMC students, it seems, are more content to complain about the lack of social activities on campus than to take advantage of one of the year's most enjoyable events. 
Evidently, Domers prefer to hang around crowded dorm parties. Or, they choose to hitch a ride down to Corby's where they drink Old Style and 

The Abortion Quandary 
Where do our values lie? 
The phrase, "Between the woman, her doctor and her God," is very moving. Equally moving, however, is the phrase, "Life is sacred--Handle with Care.'' The question is ''Which of them is moving in the right direction?" 
Recently, a very beautiful (in terms of prose and style) article appeared in The Observer. The author recounted the experience of Mary, his friend, and her fateful decision to have an abortion. 
The story was a painful one, one of agony and conflict. Mary's available choices were not pleasant: to keep the child and disrupt her life forever or to abort the child and destroy an ideal, a moral statute. The decision is history; she chose the latter. 
·r .::annot condemn her action JUSt as I cannot condemn the thousands of Marvs around the world. It is beyond mortal limits to condemn another for such a course -· for that is God's place, and His place alone. However, I can express remorse that the situation occurred. 
Reading about this Mary, a Mary of our "family" here at Notre Dame, made me very sad. Althou~h it is true that I will never be in the same situation as Mary, I did feel a type of empathy for her. Then I looked for justification, a reason "Why?". She had been careful, the necessary precautions had been taken, but still it happened. 
God works I in mysterious ways or so I've been told. lJosstDly, this was His way of reminding His children ofreality. For those involved it was painful, but for those of us who merely read about it, perhaps some knowledge was gained. Unfortunately, the cost was very high. 
Before Christmas, Father Griffin in his "Letters to a Lonely God" column wrote an ;...-uck :~ntitled "Dial-A-God Morality." In it he

listen to top forty hits blaring on the stereo. After hours of pushing and shoving to get to the bar, they ~ head back to campus, stopping on the way to spend their last dollar on a wiener at the Great American Hot Dog Stand. Yum, yum. 
There is nothing wrong with an occasional foray tn the bars. Still, they get old fast, and the blues festival provided an ener­gy charged atmosphere that Corby's couldn't touch. Sche­duled a few weeks before the 
· end-of-semester onslaught, the festival let students put down their books and get down to the serious business of partying for a weekend. 
The blues festival's informal "bring a friend and a blanket" atmosphere was truly unique. No other campus concert that I have ever attended has come close to matching it. Groups of students and local residents brought in coolers of beer and bottles of wine. With the ample floor space, they could lay back' and listen to four hours of good blues. On either side of the stage, couples danced in wild abandon. Imagine trying to move your feet between the folding chairs and the security guards at the ACC. 
Thomas C. Jennings 

described how a young man had called him and 
asked for the arguments against going to bed 
with his girlfriend after the hockey game that 
night. Father Griffin was taken aback by the 
request--he did not know how to present the 
Church's case against pre-marital sex on such 
short notice. The question then involved the 
highly individualized aspect of morality. What 
is right and what 1s wrong is up for 
interpretation, as it seems everyond establishes . 
as correct whatever standards they feel comfort­
able with. 
The University? Ye~. they 'dO have an

In conclusion, I would like to share with you the advice an 18th centun Duke gave to his son regarding sex. He said,  lle posi.,nn would be uncomfortable, the plea~tAre mo -nrary, and the price abominable. '' 
But the blues festival was more than just a release. In past years, for about the same prive as a ] ulio' s pizza, one could see some of the world's greatest blues acts at Notre Dame. Among past performers were Albert King, Muddy Wa­ters, and John Lee Hooker. Although these are not hcuse­hold names to most Notre Dame students, rock 'n' roll artists such as Lennon and McCart­ney, Jagger and Richard, and yes kids, even Bruce have been greatly influenced by them. 
There are many reasons for the failure of this year's Mid­west Blues Festival. Some feel it was scheduled too late in the semester for most students to be able to blow off an entire weekend ofstudies. Others say that Notre Dame students just don't know a good time when they see it. More importantly, though, the festival's tight budget prohibited the bookmg of a big name to attract blues fans. 
However, the reasons for blues festival's demise do not seem nearly as important as the bare fact that there is no longer a Midwest Blues Festival at Notre Dame ... How blue can you get?

LETTERS TO A LONELY GOD 
At a table in an all-night restaurant, a young man and a young woman sat over cups of coffee that they hadn't tasted for nearly an hour. The waitress approached them with a freshly-brewed pot, and asked: "Can I warm it up?" 
"Oh yes," they said, "warm it up, please,'' as thought they had been waiting for her; as though added heat were all that was needed for them to drain their cups gratefully to the dregs. Actually, the coffee was all that was left to them of a lovely evening. When the coffee was gone, the evening would be over; they were not ready for their time together to end. 
He said to her: ''I should get you home. Your folks will be worried." 
"Oh no," she said quickly, "I told them we'd be late." She would not be hustled home on a pretext. Common sense told them that they should get some sleep, but she was not going to use her parents' worry as an excuse for letting go of a lovely evening. 
"When we're married," he said, ''we'll wake up in the darkness, and we'II think: we're together, and together's being hQme, and there's no place else we'll have to go." 
"No place at all that we'll have to go," she said, "for at least fifty or sixty years." 
''Except when I go to work,'' he said. ''I'll always hate to leave you when I go to work."

''Why would we get married,'' she said, "if we didn't always intend to be together?" 
"In New York," he said, "they talk about Fourteenth Street Mary. There was this old woman nam<(fl Mary; and every night, she'd come and sit on the steps of the Brothers' house at St. Bernard's Church on Fourteenth Street. Everybody knew her, and she knew all the priests and brothers that went in and out of that house, but nobody knew why she came there. Finally, some of the Brothers figured it out that her husband must have been a motor man on the old-time street cars, and she'd sit on the Brothers' steps, watching him ride past. One day her husband died, and the street cars stopped running; but Mary, out of habit, kept coming to St. Bernard's year after year, because she didn't have any place else to go."

"Oh, honey," he said, "you're tired. Neither of us is hustling anywhere, except home to bed." 
"You go to bed, ifyou need to," she said. "I thought we were having a lovely time, sitting here by ourselves.

In dreams and in daydreams, they kept faithful. Being in love, they were always together, listening for sounds of the other busy in an adjoining room. Letting go, they found to their surprise, was an experience of discovering that events couldn't separate them; even death couldn't separate them. Existence itself was as full of memories as an evening on Fourteenth Street, where the Brothers' steps at St. Bernard's were more necessary for together­ness than all the unwanted cups of coffee that they never drank.

Vance to open IOC session 
LAKE PLACID* N.Y. (AP) ­
The International Olympic 
Committee, hardening against 
President Carter's plan for 
moving the Olympic Games 
from Moscow, learned yester­
day it will get a visit from 
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance. 
The State Department confir­med Vance will open the 82nd session of the IOC at Lake Placid tomorrow night, prior to the Winter Olympic Games. He will be representing the Presi­dent. It is not uncommon for a head of state to formally open the meetings of the IOC. 
The announcement opened the door to the first contacts bet­ween the U.S. government and the IOC since Carter first intervened and asked the Olym­pics be taken away from Mos­cow as a reprisal for Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. 
Lord Killanin, IOC president, said on his arrival at Lake Placid Wednesday he had not asked for a meeting with Car­ter, and Carter had made no move to meet him. Killanin has insisted the Games cannot be moved from Moscow, and has called on the Olympic move­ment to resist pressures from governments. 
By yesterday about 20 IOC members had arrived for the three-day session starting Sun­day. Not one of them showed any sign of going along with Carter. 
"We can't even think of moving the Gan1es because Moscow has not broken an Olympic rule," said Lance Cross of New Zealand, a mem­ber of the Executive board. 
The board was to meet yester­day, but IOC president Lord Killanin postponed the meeting until today. 
Killanin spent the day going through files of recent events-­the Soviet intervention in Af­ghanistan, Carter's demands that the Games be moved or conceled ifSoviet troops are not withdrawn, and his threat to ask the U.S. Olympic Commit­tee not to send a team if these conditions are not met. 

Killanin studied reports from many of the national Olympic committees. More than 30 governments have supported Carter's plan, but some have made it clear they will leave the decision to the national Olympic committees. 
Leaders of the U.S. Olympic Committee--Robert Kane, pres-· ident, and Col. Don F. Miller, exec.utive director--are to meet with the IOC executive board today to deliver Carter's re­quests. 
But USOC sources said Kane and Miller are not likely to advocate moving the Games with any great enthusiasm. When the USOC executive board met at Colorado Springs two weeks ago, the body voted to take Carter's demands to the IOC. 
Kane and Miller have to steer a delicate course between duty to the White House and loyalty to the Olympic ideals. 
Vitaly Smirnov of the Soviet Union, a vice-president of the IOC, will be at the meeting. He already has spoken of possible sanctions agamst the USOC if it breaches the Olympic Charter. 
Rule 24 of the Charter, dealing with the 140 recognized Nation­al Olympic Committees, says: ''NOCs must be autonomous and must resist all pressures of any kind whatsoever, whether of a political, religious or eco­nomtc nature. In pursuing their objectives, NOCs may cooper­ate with private or government organizations. However, they· must never associate them­selves with any undertaking which would be in conflict with the principles of the Olympic movement and with the rules of the IOC." 
If the USOC advocated a government plan to change the site of the 1980 Games it might be in danger of suspension, or even of losing the 1984 Games scheduled for Los Angeles. 
The two American members, Douglas Roby and Julian K. 
. Roosevelt, do not support moving the Games from Mos­cow. Of the 89 members, 76 are expected at Lake Placid.

how much the workers will be 
paid, Huber said. 
"The price for next fall's crop has already been determined, and the union had no voice whatsoever in the decision. We want to be involved in the determination of the price,'' Huber said. 
If the boycott is passed, it will only be a temporary ban on Libby's and Campbell's pro­ducts. · 
Huber said that the purpose ofthe boycott is not only to hurt the companies, but also to call attention to the migrant farm­workers' plight. "A yes vote on the ban at a major university such as Notre Dame will gain some publicity,'' Huber pointed out. ''Also, students that are made aware of what we stand for may take our ideas back home with them. This will help us even further.'' 
Huber explained that another effect of the boycott may be the discontinuation of certain label programs in schools. These pro~rams, sponsored by Camp bell s, offer reimbursement to the schools for a certain amount of labels that are collected by the students. The end of these programs could mean a de­crease in sales for Campbell's. When asked why Notre Dame 
was singled out to participate in 
the referendum, Huber pointed 
out rheproximityof the campus 
to the area involved. 
''The farms that we are talking about are located in northwest­ern Ohio, near Toledo. The major plants of Campbell's and Libby's are located in this area. Also, in the summer months, South Bend witnesses a large influx of migrant workers who work on local farms," Huber 
·explained. 
According to Huber, the ban has received support for almost a year. One sector that has been giving a lot of support is church groups. 
One man in particular, Bishop William McManus of the South Bend diocese, is an ardent supporter of FLOC's efforts. Huber quoted McManus as saying, "I think Catholics should give heed to the migrant farmworkers' boycott.'' 
The work of FLOC does not end with the referendum. The ~roup is hoping to have a 
'FLOC night" at the Nazz, on Feb. 29. The evening will feature student talent, and donations to help defray FLOC's expenses will be col­lected at the door. FLOC will also continue to hold regular meetings. 
The next meeting will be h¢ld on Monday at 9:30 p.m. in tne LaFortune Ballroom.

WINAMAC, Ind. (AP) -Ford Motor Co.'s Pinto subcompact could have been modified for $6.65 per car to withstand rear-end collisions at 30 mph without fire risk, a former Ford executive testified yesterday irt the automaker' s reckless hom­icide trial. 
Instead, top company officials decided against correcting de­fects in Pinto fuel tanks to save money, said Harley Copp, an engineer who was a Ford vice-president for European operations and later was in charge of crash tests at Ford's Dearborn, Mich., headquar­ters. 
Ford is charged with reckless homicide in the August 1978 deaths of three young women in a 1973 Pinto sedan that ex­ploded when hit from behind by a van near Goshen, Ind. 
The state contends that Ford knew Pinto fuel tanks were likely to explode in rear-end collisions but sold the cars anyway without making repairs or warning the public. 
The trial ended its fifth week yesterday, and chief prosecutor Michael A. Cosentino said he expected to wrap up his case next week. 
Copp, the key prosecution witness, told the Pulaski Circuit Court jury the 1973 Pinto was designed to withstand a 20 mph rear-end crash involving a 4,000 pound vehicle. 
Copp said that in August 1969, at a product strategy meeting with then-Ford President Lee 
A. Iacocca and other Ford executives, a proposal to in­crease the safety standard to 30 mph was rejected ''because of cost and ensuing problems." 
In April 1971, at a product review meeting, it was deter­mined that the Pinto could be modified to withstand a 30 mph rear impact at a cost of $6.65 per car, Copp said. 
Chief Ford attorney ] ames F. Neal objected that the $6.65 estimate was for the 1974 Pinto and ·that company executives decided at the same meeting to keep the 20 mph rear-impact standard for the 1973 model.j However, Judge Harold R.: Staffeldt allowed the testimony and introduction of a Ford document concerning t-he meet­ing, adding that Neal could try 

to show inaccuracies later. Copp also told the iury that the rear structure and fuel tank design of the 1973 Pinto were "grossly inadequate, probably the weakest I've seen in cars in the last 10 to 12 years.'' 
He criticized the crush space between the gas tank and the bumper, the strength of the floor pan above the tank, the design of the fuel tank filler tube-which he said caused it to pull out during a rear-end collision-and the size and shape of the tank itself. 
If the 1973 Pinto had been :lesigned like other subcom­
pacts at the time, it would have been able to withstand a rear~ impact crash at 40-50 mph without fire risk, Cop~;> said. "As illustrated in thts case, these people would have survi­ved if the fuel tank had not caused a fire," he added. 
Previous testimony has indica­ted a 30-35 mph difference between the Pinto and the van involved in the Indiana crash . 
Ford announced in June 1978 that it was recalling 1. 5 million Pintos and Mercury Bobcats for fuel system modifications. The repair kits were distributed in September 1978--a month after the Indiana incident.

Etnotional testimony tnarks Gacy trial 
CHICAGO (AP) -The mother of a boy found buried under John W. Gacy Jr.'s house burst into sobs and" fainted on the witness stand at Gacy's mass murder trial yesterday as she identified a chain bracelet worn by her son. 

"That's Sam's bracelet!" cried Bessie Stapleton, 39. She took the stand to identify pho­tographs and belongings of their sons whose remains were dug up on Gacy's property. 
Gacy, 3 7, a former remodeling contractor, has J?leaded inno­cent by reason of Insanity to the sex-relted killings of 33 young men and boys. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. 
Gacy sat facing the judse'~ bench and showed no emouon 
Mrs. Stapleton told the jury that Samuel, her 14-year-old son by a previous marriage, worked nights in a pizza parlor and attended school in the daytime. 

He was reported missing May 13, 1976, after he left the house saying he was going to see his

sister. "That is the last time I ever saw him," his mother said. 
Mrs. Stapleton said he wore a chain bracelet, something like a dogtag chain. 
At that point, prosecutor Terry Sullivan walked to the witness stand with an envelope, opened it and spilled out a bracelet. That touched off Mrs. Staple­ton's sobbing. 
She then fainted on the wit­ness chair, was helped from the courtroom and s:;arried to a couch where she was revived. 
Judge Louis B. Garippo called a brief recess and had the jury leave the courtroom. 
The testimony came as the trial entered its second day. It proved to be an emotional scene with the mothers of the victims crying and spectators dabbing their eyes with handkerchiefs. 
In late December 1978, the first of 26 bodies were dug ur from a crawl space unde1 Gacy' s home just northwest of Chicago. Three other bodies were found buried on his prop­erty and four bodies were found in rivers and later linked to the defendant.

Bani Sadr criticizes militants 
(AP) With tough talk and stern action, President Abolhassan Bani Sadr hammered away yesterday at the U.S. Embassy militants' remaining power and prestige among the Iranian people, as reports persisted that the American hostages might be freed soon. 
For the second straight day, the new Iranian president blasted the young Moslem radi­cals publicly, calling them "rebels against the govern­ment." And the Revolutionary Council, led by Bani Sadr, took action against them, restricting their access to national radio and television. 
It appeared ·Bani Sadr was trying to undercut the militants'

stiuus as revolutionary heroes in preparation for a resolution of the hostage crisis being worked out behind the scenes. 
A Kuwait newspaper, the weekly AI Khadaf, reported from Teheran that the release of the approximately 50 Ameri­can hostages at the embassy was "imminent." The paper, which did not identify the source of its information, said the number of militants at the Embassy had been reduced from 400 to 50. 
It said U.N. Secretary-General Kurt W aldheim was trying to persuade Bani Sadr to ''pres­sure the students to leave the Embassy and have them· re­placed by regular Iranian troops." 
U.S. officials were cautious in commenting on the Kuwaiti report. 
Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher said on NBC-TV's "Today" show the situation was' 'somewhat prom­ising." Spokesman George Sherman said the State De­partment had no evidence to confirm the report. And Hod­ding Carter, chief department spokesman, said, "I do not see an ~ imminent release of the hostages." 
Carter said the U.S. Govern­ment was still uncertain about Iran's terms for releasing the hostages, who spent their 96th day in captivity yesterday. 
W aldheim has been trying to work out an arrangement whereby an international com­mission would be established to investigate the alleged crimes of the deposed shah's regime, in return for release of the 
· hosta~es. But U.N. officials say the ttmins of the release -­whether It will be as the commission begins its work or after it is completed --remains unsettled. 
Adding to the confusion, some Iranian officials still say they believe the hostages cannot be freed until the ousted Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi is returned to Iran to stand trial, which has been the militants' constant demand. 
In other developments: -The State Department said the formal application of new 
U.S. economic sanctions a­gainst Iran was being delayed while diplomatic efforts contin­ued to obtain the release of the hostages. 
-Panamanian President Arist­ides Royo was quoted by his nation's television as saying the Shah can leave that country anytime he desires. Panama's Foreign Minister had said in a television interview that Pah­lavi "cannot leave Panama for obvious reasons" and that Pan­ama was, in effect, a jail for the ousted monarch. 
Meanwhile, the United States said yesterday it will not for­mally impose long promised economic sanctions against that country. 
State Department spokesman Hodding Carter explained the policy reversal by saying the administration does not want to take this step while diplomatic activity continues. 
He d1d not elaborate. 
However, reports have circu­lated in recent days indicating that Iran would be willing to release the 50 American hos­tages held in Tehran in ex­change for the establishment of a U.N. sponsored international tribunal to investigate alleged crimes of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi

Sluby signs with.ND 
Tom Sluby, a 6-4 all-Washington, D.C., Metro Conference player from Gonzaga College High, has signed an mstitutional letter-of-intent to attend Notre Dame on a basketball scholarship. 
Sluby averaged 24.3 points and 16 rebounds a game last season, and is playing at the same pace this season. 
"We didn't recruit him as a forward or a guard," said Irish coach Digger Phelps. "We requited him as a talented, versatile athlete." 
Sluby, who ar one time hit 34 consecutive free throws, last year shot 69 percent in field goals and 86 percent on free throw tries. A dean's list student, he played in several all-star games, including the All-American Classic in Akron. 
Sluby' s signing follows that ofJoe Kline, a 6-11 center from Slater, MO.
