In Brief 

Pat Robertson, Republican presidential candidate, acknowledged Wednesday that his first son was conceived months before his marriage and that he had concealed the wedding date. Robertson, a television evangelist who stepped down from his ministry to pursue hjs presidential ambitions, said in an interview published in Thursday edi­tions of The Washington Post that he and his wife Dede always considered March 22, 1954, as the day their mar­riage started because "our son was conceived on that day." He said the couple's legal marriage on Aug. 27, 1954 "to us, wasn't any big deal." -Associated Press 
"Pope MacKenzie , the Original Vatican Animal" T-shirts have resulted in a lawsuit against San Antonio College student Warren Borror who created the shirts. Anheuser-Busch Inc., which claimed the T-shirt tried to copy its trademark mascot Spuds MacKenzie, filed suit. Borror argued in a response to the suit this week that the shirt showed the "parody of the commercialization of the visit of Pope John Paul II by using those symbols the public most clearly recognizes as standing for unabashed com­mercialization." The T -shirt depicted a Spuds McKenzie­like dog wearing a papal robe and miter. -Associated Press

You could be a junior in London next year. 
It doesn't matter if you're in Arts and Letters 
or not, but it does help. 
It doesn't matter what your major is. 
Think about it, though, because applications 
are due pretty soon. 
Get one, go ahead and fill it out and get the 
recommendations and write the essay. If it 
seems like a lot of work, it might interest you 
that the application two years ago was 18 pages 
long, and a personal interview was required as 
well. You've got it easy this year. 
"Why bother?" you ask. 
Imagine yourself sitting in an English pub, . with a pint of Guinness in your hand, watching the regulars shoot a few darts and down lots of lager. You've just come back from afternoon classes on Shakespeare and fought your way through the evening rush on the tubes. 
Now it's time to discuss travel plans. Ireland 
this weekend? No, let's go to southern France 
before it gets too cold. Or we could stay in town, 
see a couple of plays, maybe a symphony or an 
art exhibit. Maybe we can get tickets to the 
Eurythmics concert at Wembley. Or we could 
be touristy and go see the Crown Jewels in the 
Tower of London. Then we'll hit Camden Palace 
or Bananas for late-night dancing. 
The conversation inevitably rolls around to 
the first of the two travel breaks. What to do 
with ten days? Italy? Greece? Hit Munich for 
Oktoberfest? Maybe go on the school-sponsored 
trip to Moscow and Leningrad. 
The travel is only part of the experience, though. London itself is a wonderful place, and Notre Dame students live and learn in the heart of the city. Classes are in Mayfair, four blocks from Piccadilly Circus. The living quarters (unless they've moved them since I went) are on Kensington Garden Square, which happens to be the storybook home of Paddington Bear. Mter a month it will seem like home. 
London is a breeze to get around, thanks to an excellent if sometimes late London Transport system. Do watch out though -it takes awhile to get used to looking right to cross the street instead of left. 
Most things overseas are less expensive than in America. Plays are $30 at most, but that's for first-run West End productions. You can see intimate fringe theater productions for $5 or less. There are incredible deals for students because Europeans believe students should travel and thus subsidize it. An International Student ID gets you into many museums and concerts for reduced rates. 
The deals extend to travel, too. $16 for a round 
trip to Edinburgh, $40 or so to Paris and back.

Even faraway places like Rome and Athens are under $200 for planefare. Most places have either a youth hostel or a bed-and-breakfast for $10-$20 a night, and food is as much as you want to spend. And of course there's Interrail passes -unlimited train travel anywhere in Europe for 150 pounds, which translates to $230 or so, depending on the exchange rates. 
Classes? Yes, you do have to take them, but only four days a week. Even though they sound like blowoff courses, with titles like "Introduc­tion to Opera" and "Exploring the East End," they're not. Watch out for Hill and Sked's British Foreign Policy course, by the way ­excellent but tough. 
If the money worries you, don't let it. Sell your house, your body, and beg, borrow or steal as much as you can. Some of us last year got by on $1200, with lots of plays and some travel as well. I do know that everyone came back more or less broke, and no one regretted spend­ing any of it. 
Classes? Mangle your schedule if you have to. I managed it as an Aerospace-Psychology major. You can fit it in. 
Time away? I challenge you to find a Lon­doner who regrets the missed semester. The adjustment can be tough, but everyone makes it, and is changed for the better for having done it. 
A passage by Robert Frost (I think) comes to mind: "I took the road less traveled by, and that made all the difference." 
Take a chance on that road less traveled by.

Alcohol awareness stressed next week 
By BRADLEY GALKO 
News Staff 
"To get our name and philos­ophy out to the community ... and teach people to make re­sponsible decisions on their own," is the purpose of Notre Dame's Alcohol Awareness Week, according to Mike Ver­baro, chairman of the week's events. 
The week, which begins Sun­day with a 5 kilometer run, is sponsored by BACCHUS (Boost Alcohol Consciousness Concerning the Health of Uni­versity Students). BACCHUS is the student organization dedi­cated to the education of the Notre Dame community about alcohol use. 
In addition to the 5 kilometer 
run at noon Sunday, the week 
will include such events as 
"Sundae Night at the Movies," Sunday at 7:30 p.m. at the Knights of Columbus Auditorium. 
Notre Dame Director of Se­curity Rex Rakow will speak on the legalities of alcohol Mon­day at 7 p.m. in Montgomery Theater in LaFortune Student Center. 
A bartending demonstration of non-alcoholic drink recipes will be held in Montgomery Theater Tuesday at 7:30p.m. 
Comedy Night will be Wed­nesday at the Alumni Senior Club. 
For a finale, a free "Bring Your Own Body" cookout, open to all students, will take place on Thursday, Oct. 15, at 4:30 
p.m. on the Field House Mall. 
In addition to hosting the numerous events of the week, BACCHUS will be distributing two informative pamphlets en­titled "Drinking Under the

Dome" and "Friends Keep Friends Alive." The pamphlets discuss the University's alco­hol policy, facts about drinking and driving under the influence of alcohol, and alternatives for students to get home safely from situations involving alco­hol. 
"In my opinion, alcohol right now is at a controlled level," said Verbaro. "But there exists possibilities for it to get out of control. We try to cut-off the problems before they start." 
Verbaro said he hopes all the events of the Alcohol Aware­ness Week will further this goal of prevention by making people more aware of the dangers of irresponsible drinking. 
In addition to the awareness week, BACCHUS, which is comprised entirely of students, will be sponsoring education programs, movie nights, lee-

He added that he planned to keep a wary eye on Nicaragua. 
"We cannot be satisfied with facades of freedom erected to fool international opinion, and then quickly dismantled when the pressure is off," Reagan declared. "We must insist on real democracy in Nicaragua -not for a week, not for a month or a year, but always." 
tures and other recreation events promoting responsible use of alcohol throughout the year. Verbaro said anyone in­terested in joining the local chapter of BACCHUS should contact chapter president Jane Heisel, vice-president Rich Gund, or Verbaro. 
In addition to the Notre Dame Alcohol Awareness Week, the national chapter of BACCHUS will be sponsoring the National Collegiate Alcohol Awareness Week from Oct. 19 to Oct. 25. No University events are scheduled due to mid­semester break. Anyone seeking more information about these awareness pro­grams should contact the alco­hol concerns commissioner of Student Government or a local BACCHUS chapter officer, ac­cording to national BACCHUS representative Vince Willis. 
While Reagan praised the Sandinistas for starting to com­ply with the regional peace ac­cord, he said he had "a skepticism born of a long record of Sandinista deceit and broken promises." 
The president said Contra aid should be continued unless the Sandinistas realize "they do not have the option of being dic­tators." He called on them to form a political party and "serve for limited terms of of­fice" under free and fair elec­tions. 
Under the new peace plan signed by the Nicaraguans, municipal elections are to be held next year and presidential elections in 1990. 
Although it is ambiguous whether negotiations must be face to face under the regional peace plan, Reagan asserted that "isn't it time (the Nicaraguans) sat down and negotiated" a cease-fire with the Contra rebels. 
Art program to attract high schools 
By PAT HEALY 
News Staff 
Approximately 54 South Bend high school students will become college students for a day and attend Notre Dame art classes next week. 
The participation day, to be held on Wednesday, Oct. 14, was initiated by the Edu­cational Committee of the Snite Museum, according to Committee Chairman Judy Mitchell. 
This is the first such pro­gram run by the Committee, said Mitchell, although there was a similar program spon­sored by the Notre Dame Art Center and faculty about ten years ago. 
The students represent five South Bend community high schools -LaSalle, Wash­ington, Riley, Clay, and Adams. 
Ten classes will be offered to the students, some of which are regular Notre Dame art courses and others designed specifically for the program. The classes being offered are advertising, in­dustrial design, figure sculp­ture, wood sculpture, metal sculpture, fibers, water­colors, ceramics and two photography classes. 
According to Father James Flanigan, Assistant Rector of Art, Art History, and Design, the program serves two purposes. The first is to "acknowledge and reward the better art stu­dents in the area," and the second is to introduce the University's art program to the students.

Stranded refugees attacked by sharks 
Associated Press 

SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic -Doomed refugees from a sinking boat thrashed wildly in the bloody water to fend off more than 40 frenzied sharks, but officials flying above them could do nothing to save them, aut­horities said Wednesday. 
Estimates of the number of people killed Tuesday when the overloaded boat capsized ranged from 70 to more than 
100. Officials said some of the missing may have made it to shore and fled; many bodies were expected to surface later. 
Survivor Eddy Ventura said 168 Dominicans crowded onto the old 50-foot wooden boat about 4 a.m. Tuesday that was to smuggle them to Puerto Rico, the more prosperous U.S. 
commonwealth 100 miles across the shark-infested Mona Channel, at a cost of $300 to $500 each. 
Eugenio Cabral, civil defense director of the Dominican, Republic, said scores of bodies probably would surface and float to shore. 
"That takes about 48 hours," he said. "I expect that between today and tomorrow, bodies will begin appearing in large quantities." 
By Wednesday afternoon, 32 people had been rescued, said hospital officials in Nagua and Cabrera on the the northeast coast of this Carribean nation, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti. 
Cabral, who was aboard a plane that flew over the site Tuesday, estimated the herd of shq,rks at "more than 40."

Contract to cut down on sex 
Associated Press 
GARY, Ind. -A Gary couple believes chaperoned dating may be the answer to escalat­ing teen-age pregnancies. 
Harry and Nimat Muhum­mad, the parents of six children, are conducting public meetings to generate local in­terest in a group they started four years ago called Con­cerned Parents Against Teen­age Pregnancy. 
The Muhummads, who moved to Gary about a month ago, advocate a parent-child contract in which the child promises not to have sex until marriage.

come across well, Dutile 
added. 
Kmiec contended that many 
senators are rejecting Bork not 
because he is unqualified or un­
ethical, but because of his po­
litical phUosophy. 
Bork's philosophy, Kmiec 
added, is not much different 
from that of recently retired 
Justice Lewis Powell or the late 
Justice Hugo Black. 
Reaction from orchestrated 
pressure from interest groups 
has hurt Bork's chances, he 
added. The groups are taking 
items from Bork's record and 
using them out of context. 
An example was Sen. Ted 
Kennedy's (D-Ma.) statement 
that a world of Judge Bork 
would have blacks denied 
public accomodations, Kmiec 
noted. Bork denied the state­
ment, saying that equal ac­
comodations were protected 
under the Constitution. 
Kmiec said the Senate may 
be "setting a dangerous prece­
dent" by rejecting a nominee 
because of his interpretation of 
the Constitution. 
If Bork is not confirmed, 
Kmiec said, it would be a rare 
event. • 
Three or four nominees have 
not been confirmed in this cen­
tury, he said. The number who 
have failed to win confirmation 
in the nation's history is 
"extremely small." 
''This is an extraordinary 
event in that sense," Kmiec 
said. 

The parents' end of the bar­gain requires them to escort their children on dates. 
"Chaperoning will not only help in preventing pregnancy, but will also help make the family closer," Mrs. Muhum­mad said. · 
The child's portion of the con­tract reads: "I, child, under­stand that God does not want me to have sex before mar­riage; therefore, I agree to ac­cept this procedure to avoid having sex before marriage." 
The parent's portion reads: "I, parent, understand that God does not want (my child) to have sex before marriage. I also understand that (my child) is attracted to the oppo­site sex, and that is natural."

Blending of ideas espouses growth 
Pretty much everyone agrees that M & M's only got better when the red ones returned to join the orange and green and yellow and brown and tan. 
The greatest asset of the chameleon is its mutability. The best pizza is one with "the works" --everything on it. 
Legend has it that the spectrum which is a rainbow leads eventually to a pot of gold. 
Colors mix to create new colors. Me­tals mix to create stronger alloys. The best debate results from two very dichotomous viewpoints. 
The most significant point of differ­entiation for America, and subse­quently its greatest strength, is that it is the world's melting pot. As Bill Mur­ray eloquently claims in "Stripes," we are the "mutts" of the world but we've been leading the world for awhile now.

All these examples shed light on the benefits of multiculturalism, while at the same time hoping to give evidence to the fact that it is a concept which we are familiar with and not far removed from, any of us. 
Multiculturalism was something I knew hardly anything about two sum-

P.O. Box Q 
ND Food Services worthy of praise 

Dear Editor: 
Behind the foodlines in the Dining Halls tonight will be a new set of faces. Some of us have worked in the Dining Hall before, but for others, this is a new experience. Today is Food Service Ap­preciation Day. The new faces behind the lines are members of Student Gov­ernment including hall presidents, the Student Union, and the Classes. 
Food Service Appreciation Day is mainly a result of the Michigan food fight. Because of the fight, we became aware of how much the dining hall workers really do for Notre Dame stu­dents, and how little appreciation we show them. Other schools don't have 
Doonesbury 
mers ago when I got a letter in the mail indicating that Student Activities had decided to create a new yearly Fall Fes­tival on scale of An Tostal. But I was interested and went as a representative of student government to the organiza­tional meeting for more information. Immediately, I became swept up with the concept and consequently with the Fall Festival. Our small executive com­mittee was a living testimonial to the goals of multiculturalism. We were from a vast array of backgrounds and yet we became as one--a single force working together towards a common purpose. I say without hesitation that we became a family. 
That first year was a learning expe­rience. A long process of trial and error. In many regards we failed. We became lost in our own enthusiasm. We er­roneously assumed that multicul­turalism was an idea easily embraced by and familiar to Notre Dame. But we returned with new vigor and deter­mination this year, convinced that the Fall festival would work once the notion of multiculturalism was known and once its spirit was internalized and began to spread. 
As we are a little past mid-week in this year's festival, we are gratified that it is working and the idea of mul­ticulturalism is taking root in Notre Dame. 

But many of you still inquire: what exactly is multiculturalism? I shall at­tempt to answer your inquiry as best I can, starting first with a few question!:. of my own: what is Notre Dame? Is it the buildings, lakes and lawns which compose its campus? Or is it more than that? Is multiculturalism merely par­ties, dancing and singing ethnic songs, and learning facts about other cultures and backgrounds? Or is it more than that? 
It is my contention that Notre Dame and multiculturalism are much "more than that." As Notre Dame is a spirit, a feeling, and a sense of pride so too is multiculturalism. As multiculturalism espouses understanding and unity which provides the impetus for the for­mulation of friendships so too does Notre Dame. In as much as Notre Dame fosters the genesis of family and community so to does multicul­turalism. Finally, multiculturalism seeks to educate so as to provide a foun­dation for service, establishing a mindset whereby one is concerned and respectful of others. Is this not the mis­sion of Notre Dame? 
As you may have ascertained by now, it is a difficult task to come up with one set definition of multiculturalism. So in order to try and clarify the concept I shall return to the examples given at the outset. 
any of the special events that Mr. Hickey and his staff work so hard to bring Notre Dame students. Our Food Service personnel take pride in their jobs. As their slogan says, they are "here to serve us." 

Just as our parents come into contact daily with many people at work, so do the Food Service personnel. The people in touch with Food Service workers are Notre Dame students. Their jobs would be so much easier if they knew that we appreciated them coming to work for us everyday. It's always easier to go to work if you know you're appreciated. So today, and from now on, let's make their jobs easier. It really wouldn't take much on our parts -a smile, a thank you, a friendly tone of voice. Just let them know we appreciate them.

Puzzling bigotry permeates campus 
Dear Editor: 
I would like to thank Father Robert Griffin for his article "What did you think when you read the funnies?", that appeared in the Observer October 2. Father Griffin stated the inevitable conclusion that racial discrimination remains in society today. He responded to the cartoon that classified Blacks in the same class as drug pushers and street gangs. The negative reaction by Notre Dame Blacks should make people think about the existence of bigotry and prejudice at Notre Dame. How can Notre Dame students see the

As with the chameleon, multicul­
turalism seeks beneficial change and 
adaptation. This is accomplished by 
giving part of oneself to others, and sub­
sequently by learning and understand­
ing. Something new and useful is 
created when different colors mix and 
combine. The same may be said of 
mixing and sharing different tradi­
tions, backgrounds, norms, ideas and 
perspectives. 
Multiculturalism emphasizes the dif­ferences among us and in so doing paradoxically hints to how we're all very much alike. M & M's have differ­ent candied shells yet they've got the same chocolate inside. 
Multiculturalism mandates that from diversity is gained strength and reward as with America, alloys, and the rainbow. 
In closing, I have attempted to show that the concept of multiculturalism is not foreign to us here at Notre Dame, and thus will take lasting hold. The fu­ture of the Multicultural Fall Festival, therefore, seems bright and currently without limits, soon to weave its place in among the fabric of the many Notre Dame traditions. It is a mustard seed planted in good soil -growing. If the spirit hasn't caught you yet, it will. 
Marty Rodgers is a senior in the College of Arts and Letters. 
Negroes Getting Everything") and laugh at, or even agree with such bigotry? This is a Catholic school, but are the students Catholic? 
Father Griffin's article indirectly ad­dresses a most important and frustrat­ing question: How and why has bigotry and prejudice become a characteristic of my generation? If somebody told me five years ago that many prejudices would exist among my peers at an elite private Catholic university I would have thought he was out of his mind. In high school I fought the prejudice and narrow-mindedness of right wingers who went to born-again fun­damentalist churches. Notre Dame stu­dents are more intelligent, and they are tolerant of others religious beliefs, but bigotry and prejudice remain. Why?

'Salesman' cast is powerful 
'Princess Bride' 
ELIZABETH CORNWELL accent writer 
W 
atching Rob Reiner's atest film, "The Princess Bride," is an enormously enjoy­able experience. The movie tells the story of Buttercup, the most beautiful woman in the world, and her true love, the 
Movie review 

farm boy Westley. It's a fairy 
tale, complete with swordplay, 
piracy, torture, revenge and a
'' 

giant. It's also a marvelously funny comedy. 
Reiner, also reponsible for the rockumentary satire "This Is Spinal Tap," and last year's "Stand By Me," knows a lot about making people laugh. His film never makes the mis­take of taking itself too seriously. Instead, he gives us a movie that delights in being silly, that joyously romps through one crazy scene after another, and always comes up with a grin. 
The film is a story framed within a story -a technique Reiner also used in "Stand By 
Cary Elwes and Robin Wright share true love as Westley and Buttercup In Me." The movie opens with a the new Rob Reiner and Wllllam Goldman release, "The Princess Bride." sick little boy receiving a visit from his grandfather. The grandfather (nicely played by Peter Falk) offers to read to the boy from a book -the same book his father read to him when he was sick and the book he had read to the boy's father when he was sick. The boy is unimpressed. But as the story gets going, the boy becomes more and more involved, and the pair become closer. 
The story, of course, is that of "The Princess Bride." But­trcup loves Westley, but he dis­appears and is assumed dead. She pines. Eventually she agrees to wed the evil Prince Humperdinck. On the day of her bethrothal she is kid­napped. So it goes. It's faintly satirical and it's always ridiculous. And you can't help but cheer for the good guys and worry about the bad guys and laugh at them all. 
The performances are all solid. For the most part the actors are content to play their roles straight, with just a hint of laughter in their eyes, letting the material carry all the jokes. Cary Elwes is the dashing and clever Westley, always game, always valiant, never despair­ing. Mandy Patinkin steals the show as Buttercup's kidnapper, Inigo Montoya, a Spaniard out to avenge t.he long-ago murder of his father. The scene where he finally meets his father's 


a gem 

murderer and is able to shout out "I am Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die." is the best in the movie. 
Andre the Giant, of profes­sional wrestling fame, does a terrific job playing the not too bright but awfully good-hearted giant Fezzik. And in a side­splitting pair of cameo perfor­mances, Billy Crystal and Carol fume are Miracle Max and his wife, Valerie, a pair of crotchety old folks who make their living reviving almost dead people. 
The film is based on a book by William Goldman, Oscar winning screenwriter for "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" and "All the President's Men." Goldman calls the book "the one thing I care most about of anything I've ever written." His book was first adapted for the screen in 1973, but never quite made it to the screen. Having seen his baby kicked around Hollywood for nearly 15 years, he was a bit leery of Reiner's interest. 
After the two finally met, he became enthusiatic and re­scripted the film himself. The resultant movie is is a tightly written, solidly produced, amazingly giddy production. It isn't the deepest, most meaningful or profound movie around, but it isn't trying to be. All it really wants to be is good fun. And what a success it is. 
JOHN HAYFORD accent writer 

1""'\<mlel Dally and the rest of Lithe cast of "Death of a Salesman" gave the audience a powerful interpretation of Ar­thur Miller's timeless play Wed­nesday night In Washington Hall. 
Under the direction of Father Arthur Harvey, the cast pre­sented a moving portrait of Miller's masterpiece. Each char­acter In the play added some­thing to the overall theme of Willy Loman's loss of In­dividuality. Willy, an Idealist, has gone through life believing In the dream that strength of personality guarantees financial 
success. He tries to Impose his  
de-Juslon onto his two sons,  
Blff and Happy. Only during  
the power-ful conclusion of  
the play does Willy realize that  
dreams are easily destroyed by  
reality.  
Although Dally, a Notre Dame  
graduate, has been In the pro­ 
fessional acting sphere for ten  
years, the rest of the cast  
matches his exceptional talent.  
The cast works together to  
bring Miller's universal theme  
closer to the audience. Each  
one utters statements which  
carry philosophical sig­ 
nificance. One of the most  
memorable lines In the play  
comes close to the end when  
Willy protests, "I am not a

Associated Press 

MINNEAPOLIS -Don Baylor singled to break an eighth­inning tie and Gary Gaetti homered in his first two playoff at-bats as the Minnesota Twins drew on both youth and expe­rience to beat the Detroit Tigers 8-5 Wednesday night in the opening game of the Amer­ican League playoffs. 
The victory was the first ever in a playoff series for the Twins, who were swept by Bal­timore in their only two appear­ances in 1969 and '70. 
Game 2 will be at the Metrodome Thursday night with Detroit's Jack Morris, 18­11, facing Bert Blyleven, 15-12. 
The Twins scored four runs in the eighth inning, erasing a 5-4 Detroit lead and chasing Tigers' starter Doyle Alexan­der, whose postseason miseries continued. 
One run already had scored in the eighth when the 37-year­old Baylor came to bat against reliever Willie Hernandez with the bases loaded and one out. 
with postseason experience, lined a single to left for the run that put the Twins ahead to stay and made a winner of reliever Jeff Reardon, who had replaced starter Frank Viola in the top of the inning. 
Giants 5, Cardinals 0 
ST. LOUIS -Dave Dravecky pitched a two-hitter and Will Clark and Jeffrey Leonard homered Wednesday as the San Francisco Giants turned on the power and shut off the St. Louis Cardinals 5-0, evening the Na­tional League playoffs at one victory each. 
Dravecky did not allow a run­ner past second base and did not give up a hit after Tommy Herr's single in the fourth. Jim Lindeman singled in the second for the Cardinals' other hit. 
Dravecky managed to avoid trouble despite leadoff walks in four innings. Those were his

her," Ryan said. "She's run­
ning well. I thought we would 
have a couple of people ahead 
of her; I didn't think she would 
be in the top five." 
Ledrick also never thought 
she would be reaching such 
heights in her freshman year 
with the Irish. 
"The first week was really 
tough," she said. "It was com­
pletely different from high 
school and more difficult. I 
didn't have any expectations; 
I just wanted to do well. We 
started out so much faster than 
in high school." 
Ledrick accepted the chal­
lenge with vigor and combined 
her determination with hours 
of hard work to break into the 
top five. 
"I started working harder 
than I ever had in my life," she 
said. ''The harder I worked, the more I wanted to do better. If I was doing a job, I wouldn't want half the results." 
"She's got a great deal of tal­ent," Ryan praised, "but you can't tap that talent without dedication and hard work. She's a very coachable per­son." 
Ledrick's career high school marks in Michigan rival any other distance runner. She was the 3200 meters state champ in track and was second in the state cross country meet as a senior. She took first in The Athletic Congress cross country sectional, fifth in the regional and 11th in the na­tional meet. 
"I'm satisfied with those results," Ledrick said. "I didn't start to excel until my sophomore year. I just went out and had a lot of fun." 
While Ledrick may be run­ning in top form, Ryan will give the top five runners the weekend off to prepare for the

ST(JDENTS ARE CORDIALLY INVITED MONTHLY VOCATION REFLECTION 
Indiana Intercollegiates and the North Star Conference Meet that await the Irish. Ryan will send the remainder of the squad to Ball State Saturday to compete in a dual meet against the Cardinals. 
"It's not a very big pressure meet," he said. "We're using it to determine who will be our sixth and seventh runners the rest of the season. The meet will be good for the freshmen and sophomores who haven't been able to compete." 
This will be Notre Dame's only dual meet of the season, and it is wedged between the four toughest invitationals of the year. The Irish are coming off a seventh-place finish in the National Catholic Champion­ships and a fifth-place showing in the inaugural Notre Dame Invitational. 
Ryan will stay home with the top five to continue prepara­tions for these meets. 
"The purpose is two-fold," he said. "It lets them escape the

Special to the Observer 

Dave Duerson, free safety for the striking Chicago Bears and alternate player­representative for the National Football League team, will be speaking tonight at 8:30 at the Architecture Auditorium in the Architecture Building. 
But perhaps Green described it best: "Well ... ,"he paused. "It's Astroturf.'' But still not bad for a ware­house. 
So far, a couple weeks of practice on the artificial sur­face have spelled injury for a few players. 
Junior split end Ray Dumas will miss three to four weeks after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery. Dumas injured the knee indoors last week. 
Freshman inside linebacker David Rosenberg fractured his leg last week and is expected to be out for the rest of the season. 
Flanker James Sass and tail­back Tony Brooks suffered minor injuries in practice this week, and might miss the Pitt game. 
On a lighter note, senior cor­nerback Brandy Wells and sophomore fullback Braxston Banks are back in uniform after suffering damage to knee ligaments.

nificance for the John Adams High product. As recent as 1985 in Notre Dame's back yard, the Hoosiers garnered more respect than did the Irish soc­cer team. But Roemer, who had attended four IU soccer camps while in high school, resisted Hoosier head coach Jerry Yeagely's sales pitch and decided on Notre Dame. 
After a 4-1 loss to Indiana his freshman year, Roemer and fellow South Bend product Bruce "Tiger" McCourt com­bined to knock the Hooisers down from their idolized posi­tion in the community. 
"Before the overtime period began," says Roemer, "we decided that if we can't do it for the team, then we would try to do it for ourselves. Well, we connected." 
Thirty seconds into the over­time Roemer picked up a loose ball at midfield. He started taking the ball to the middle, corner for forward Randy Mor­ris. 
But from behind he heard wingback Dave Augustyn yell ·"Tiger." Roemer spotted his former nemesis (McCourt is a St .Joseph's High product) on the left side, cut the ball back and sent a pass over McCourt's head who scored the game win­ner. The hometown boys had changed the image of Notre Dame soccer in the communi­ty. 
"I found my high school coach after the game, the one who had introduced me to In­diana soccer," says Roemer. "We just stood there and hugged each other. He couldn't believe that we had beaten IU." 
Roemer, a~ well as McCourt, are now looked up to by the youth in South Bend. Not once before this game had they been asked for their autograph or asked to pose for a picture. 
Roemer notes that the local situation is a sidelight to what the win meant to the team. Team confidence was the main result of the victory, a confi­
