Sexual AssaultAwareness Week begins 
Gender Relations Center hosts events to foster discussion, education on campus 
By SARAH MERVOSH 
News Writer 
The Gender Relations Center is hosting events to increase awareness about sexual assault and spark discussion during this week'-s Sexual Assault Awareness Week, said Laura Lauck, the student assistant at the Gender Relations Center. 
Lauck said the posters dis­played around campus for Sexual Assault Awareness Week represent the goals of the week because the posters are of a face without eyes and an X in place of a mouth.

Student research published in new journal 
By TESS CIVANTOS 
News Writer 
The College of Arts and Letters has a Journal of Undergraduate Research, but students in the College of Science had no place to publish their research -until now. 
College of Science students and facul­ty are planning Scientia, Notre Dame's first-ever journal for undergraduate research devoted exclusively to science, for release this semester. 
"There are so many students in the College of Science doing all these awe­some research projects, and there's no outlet for them," said sophomore Ryan Renacci, the submissions editor for Scientia. "We want these students to be able to let other students see what they've done." 
A journal for undergraduate science research is a natural fit for Notre Dame's expanding science and research programs. Edwin Siu, a grad­uate student in biological sciences and advisor to Scientia, was surprised that such a publication did not already exist. 
"When I started school here, I looked to see if there was a publication in the College of Science for student research," Siu said. "With Notre Dame's focus on undergraduate education, it seemed strange that there wasn't one." 
A key feature of Scientia, Latin for "knowledge," is that it will be complete­ly student-run. Another is that it will be an online publication, with only one print copy issued yearly. 
"The advantage of online publication is that it reduces our burden on the planet, it allows for a rolling applica­

Parents on campus for JPW 
By MADELINE BUCKLEY News Writer 
For junior Mary Beth Lee, Junior Parents Weekend (JPW) allowed her to introduce her parents to life at Notre Dame and reflect on the past two and a half years on campus. 
"In college, you have two dif­ferent homes and two different families," Lee said. "You fmally get to have your ND family meet your biological family." 
Lee said her favorite event was the President's Dinner, which took place on Saturday, mostly because of University President Fr. Jenkins' funny and insightful address. 
In the speech, Jenkins drew comparisons between the bibli­cal story, "The Boy Jesus in the Temple" -where Jesus' par­ents lose him only to find him later preaching in the temple ­and the evolution from child to adult that happens in college, she said. 
"His point was that we are evolving and changing at school, and our parents come to JPW to find us all grown up," Lee said. 
Along with attending the President's Dinner, Lee said she was able to give her. parents a tour of campus, and they went out to dinner at Polito's Restaurant.

A prayer service for sexual assault survivors will be held at 7 p.m. tonight at the Log Chapel. Following the prayer service will be a march around campus and a bonfire on Holy Cross Hill where students will have a "speak out," student assistant for the Gender Relations Center Patrick Tighe said.

Alternate options 

Like many Notre Dame students, you may feel pressure to "succeed" in the conventional way by finding a high­paying job, a like-minded spouse and a suburban home within a 10-mile radius of either a country club or Catholic church. 
That road is Robert Singer weR-tra~eled, and it's no sure thing

economy, so here are 
Editor 

some alternative, recession-proof career options that you can't look up on Go Irish and won't hear about from your parents' friends. 
+ 
MMA Fighter/Ultimate Fighting Championship: This is a burgeoning field because of a rise in frustration due to a poor economy and the wide­spread crackdown on school bullying; as people are forced to seek new out­lets for their repressed hatred for the world, fighting circles are opening up everywhere. It's the one blue-collar job that isn't being outsourced. Plus, there is no drug testing for the amateur bouts. Couple this with the fact that Mixed Martial Arts rewards rage as much as athleticism and you'll have an almost guaranteed shot at success if you "line up" the right kind of pre­game routine. Go to GladiatorElite.com for more details. Men and women can apply. 

+ 
Farmerffhe Midwest: Land will be cheap in the Midwest if there is a mass exile due to a collapse in auto manufacturing. Also, if you're enam­ored with Catholic doctrine, no career is more accommodating than farming. Birth control is a hindrance when you can always use more hands to shovel the hog pen or husk the corn. 


Considering the quality of schools in most parts of the Midwest, your crew of child laborers will be around to sup­port the family business long after they are rejected from their dream schools and decide joining the military is too risky given the five wars simultaneous­ly being fought in the Middle East. If you're interested in buying farm acreage, call Jeff at 614-989-9394. 
+ Friar/Franciscans of Primitive Observance: It won't help to pay off that $200,000 bill from Notre Dame, as this strict brotherhood of monks rejects all use of money, but it assured­ly won't put you in the awkward situa­tion of worrying about troublesome concepts like social justice from a 40th floor office in Goldman Sachs. Instead, you'll be down on the streets as one of society's sufferers. Wearing a rough wool habit and living in a wooden cell, you can toss aside the tired tradition of rugged individualism and depend on someone else for a change -Divine Providence. Begging and hitchhiking and relying on the guilt -er, inspired goodwill -of other people will be your only options, since this order denies itself the use of cars and commerce. If, interested, write Brother Andrew at Co-Redemptrix Friary, 20 Trinity Street, Lawrence, Massachusetts 01841. 
If you're at Notre Dame, chances are good that your parents made more conventional career decisions. But who's to say that's the only way to find satisfaction in life?

Woman receives Invita­tion 22 years late 
LA GHANDE, Ore. -An Oregon woman finally received an invitation to her nephew's high school graduation in New Jersey, but she may be a little late -it was in 1987. 
Theresa Schlossarek, of La Grande, found the invi­tation last week in her mailbox. The envelope, which had been opened, was postmarked June 2, 1987, from Toms River, N.J., where her brother, Hermann Ilnseher, lives. 
Ilnseher said the lack of response from his sister was noticed but dismissed. 

"We just thought that she lived so far away, she couldn't come," IInseher said. "She usually would send money, though, so we did joke about that later on, that maybe she could send some and add inter­est for the years passed." 
Peter Hass, spokesman for the U.S. Postal Service's Portland district, called the delay "very unusual and very unfortunate."

Prosecutors say Kay has been telling other inmates he's actually a sheriff's deputy, working undercov­er to investigate other deputies. 
Online court records did­n't list an attorney for Kay on Saturday.

The Saint Mary's College Women's choir will tour March 9-15 in the Midwest and Canada, continuing the tradi­tion that has continued every other year for the past 25 years 
The choir will perform in Fort Wayne, Ind.; Toledo, Ohio; Ann Arbor, Detroit and Bloomfield Hills, Mich.; and Guelph and Toronto, Ontario in Canada. 
In preparation for the tour, the Women's Choir members have been diligently practicing four hours per week, said Choir Director Nancy Menk. Their dedication to this tour is not just based on a desire to present an aesthetic experi­ence for audiences; this tour has significant purposes; Menk said. 
"One purpose of this tour is to promote Saint Mary's College and, in particular, the Music Department and the Women's Choir to prospective students; alumnae, and the general public," Menk said. 
The tour also benefits the choral program at Saint Mary's College through promotion of their music. 
"This tour will promote qual­ity choral singing, especially· music for women's voices, including the new pieces in our choral series," Menk said. "It will promote the quality of our choral program and make our COs available to our audi­ences." 

During this tour, the Women's Choir will perform in conjunc­tion with other university, high school, and community treble choirs. The choirs who will be performing with the Women's Choir are the Fort Wayne Children's Choir at First Wayne Street United Methodist Church, the Ann Arbor Youth Chorale and Huron High School Bel Canto at Bethlehem United Church of Christ, and the University of Guelph and the University of Toronto Women's Choirs at Harcourt Memorial United Church. 
The choir will conclude the tour with a homecoming con­cert March 20 at 7:30 p.m. in the Church of Our Lady of Loretto on campus. 
Ultimately, the tour is a developmental experience for the girls participating. 
"This tour is meant to build musicality and rapport among the members of the Choir and to strengthen our performing abilities and to have. fun while making great music together," Menk said. "The Choir always improves immensely by the end of the tour."

ND biologist explores 
circadian clock gene 
Special to The Observer 
Scientists have long known that interrupting the 24-hour circadian rhythm plays havoc with the lives and health of med­ical, military and airline person­nel, factory employees and trav­elers. 
A new paper by University of Notre Dame biologist Giles Duffield and a team of researchers that appears in this month's edition of the journal Current Biology sheds new light on circadian timing systems and focuses on a key gene that seems to regulate the response of the circadian clock to light signals. 
"Circadian rhythms are impor­tant and exciting because they pervade many aspects of bio­chemistry, physiology and behavior, either subtly or overt­ly," Duffield said. "For example, the human sleep-wake cycle is a very obvious rhythm and tightly gated to the night, while per­haps less obvious is that virtual­ly all hormones oscillate with a 24-hour rhythm and up to 10 percent of genes in each cell are rhythmically controlled." 
An estimated 16 percent of the 
U.S. working population is involved in rotational shift work, and a significant population is affected by jet lag and related sleep-wake disorders. The impact of the large shifts in the body's internal clock that these individuals experience can be profound, contributing to increased accident rates, med­ical errors and the development of particular illnesses. 

"Both the Three Mile Island disaster in 1979 and the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 occurred late at night or early in the morning," Duffield said. "Most truck accidents occur around 2 a.m. Incidents of can­cer and cardiovascular dis.ease are elevated in trans-Atlantic airline staff and in shift work­ers." 
The master circadian clock in the human resides within the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamic brain and receives direct input from the retina (eye) through which the clock can be reset or synchronized on a daily basis to the prevailing light-dark cycle. This provides both time of day and also time of year infor­mation to the brain and body. Things can go wrong with the internal clocks when either the clock system or its light input pathway is disrupted. 
Using DNA microarray tech-· niques, Duffield and the other researchers identified an impor­tant gene called the "Inhibitor of DNA-binding 2" {Id2) and found that the gene is rhythmically 
 
expressed in various tissues including the suprachiasmatic nucleus.

Iraq to operate nuclear power plant 
TEHRAN -Iran's first nuclear plant will 
begin long-delayed pilot operations on 
Wednesday, the state atomic energy agency 
said. 
A nuclear official in Russia, which is help­
ing build the plant, however, said no major 
milestone is expected on that day. 
"The pilot stage operation of the power 
plant will start on Wednesday," Iranian 
atomic agency spokesman Mohsen Delaviz -told the state news agency on Sunday. 
He added that the preliminary phase will 
take place during a visit by Sergei Kiriyenko, 
the head of Russia's state nuclear agency. 
The long-awaited 1,000-megawatt light­
water reactor, which was built in the south­
ern Iranian port of Bushehr with the help of 
Russia under a $1 billion contract, was pre­
viously scheduled to become operational in 
fall 2008. Some 700 Iranian engineers were 
trained in Russia to operate the power plant. 
Two escape from Greek prison 
ATHENS -For the second time in their lives,

They had been scheduled to appear before a 
magistrate Monday about their first escape ­
from the same prison-three years ago. 
The shaken government quickly dismissed 
three Justice Ministry officials, and the prime 
minister scheduled an amergency meeting of 
part of his cabinet Monday to discuss the coun­
try's prisons. 
"This was an insult which I will not accept ... I 
will take measures as harsh as necessary," 
Justice Minister Nikos Dendias announced.

Federal judge to go on trial for sex crime 
Associated Press 
HOUSTON -U.S. District Judge Samuel Kent will be making judi­cial history when he enters a courtroom Monday -but it won't be the kind he'll want to remem­ber. 
Kent will join the handful of fed­eral judges who have taken part in a trial as a defendant, and he will be the first to face trial on a sex crime charge. 
The 59-year-old judge is accused of fondling two female court employees as he tried to force him­self on the women and have them perform sex acts. 
Jury selection in his trial was set to begin Monday. If convicted, he 

faces up to life in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. 
Kent has pleaded innocent to five charges related to federal sex crimes and to one alleging obstruc­tion or justice, in which he is accused of lying to an investigative committee. 
His nearly 19 years on the bench might buy him some credibility with the jury, said Barry Pollack, an attorney not connected to the case. 
"What you might see happen is the jury take the presumption of innocence a little more seriously," said Pollack, with the Washington firm of Miller & Chevalier. "But if the allegations are proven, the jury would be very offended a federal judge engaged in that conduct." 
A gag order in the case has pre­vented prosecutors, defense attor­neys and others connected to the case from commenting outside court. 
Kent wants to testify, his attor­ney, Dick DeGuerin, said during a hearing last week in which he unsuccessfully tried to have the obstruction charge thrown out or severed. 
"Judge Kent believes his conduct with both of the (women) was mutual and consensual," said DeGuerin, who has represented such high-profile clients as former 
U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and Branch Davidian sect leader David Koresh.

ties to be extremely popular. 
"The reason why I tried to come up with events that vary across the board is to have a larger turnout and to make the week more inclusive," Lau said. "Everyone on campus has different interests and we hoped that being able to offer a variety of events would make them feel like they are invited to at least one even." 
Women's Appreciation Week is an annual week of events put on by the SDB, but the members of the board are constantly working to come up with new ideas for activi­ties. 
"It is the responsibility of the chair and co-chair of the event, who are new every year, to put their personal touch on the week and bring something new," Lau said. 
The only event carried over from last year's week is the 

Cairo 
continued from page 1 
Associated Press. A government statement said a homemade bomb was placed under a bench in the main plaza, the AP reported. 
The wounded included three Saudis, a German, 13 French and four Egyptians, including a child, the report said. 
The explosion took place in the main plaza at the Khan el­Khaili, a bazaar near the Hussein mosque, one of Cairo's most revered shrines. 
According to the report, the bombing in Cairo Sunday may have been a response to Isral;)l's offensive in Gaza, and the attack was the first on tourists in three years. 
Judy Hutchinson, assistant director of the Office of International Studies, told The Observer in an e-mail she con­tacted the students in studying abroad in Egypt, who attend the American University in Cairo. 
She said in the e-mail she is "assured that none of them were in the area of the blast." 
Three students from the pro­gram responded to Observer e­mails despite the seven-hour time difference between Egypt and Indiana. 
Juniors Jim Genovese, Kassandra Barbee and Mark McGuire said the eight Notre Dame students at the American University in Cairo in New Cairo did not witness the attack. In Egypt, the weekend runs Friday and Saturday and the school week begins on Sunday to observe the Muslim day of prayer. Their dormitories, locat­ed in the northwest side of the city, are a distance from Khan el-Khalii, located in the south­eastern portion of Cairo; how­ever Notre Dame students have been sightseeing in the Khan el­Khalili area of the city in the past, Genovese said. 
Genovese, a Program of Liberal Studies major at Notre Dame who is currently studying Arabic, said "an explosion in the city is cause for concern." 
However, the students' loca­tion and the rarity of the attack have helped to assuage worry. 
"I feel relatively safe and secure," he said. "Zamalek[the neighborhood where the dormi­tories are located,] is a more affluent part of the city and is usually not a prominent desti­nation for tourists." 
Barbee said she did not hear the explosion Sunday and only 
handing out of roses on Tuesday. 
In order to coordinate the activities for the .event, Lau said that she tried to address the interests of as many stu­dents on campus as possible. 
"As an Art and Women's Studies minor it was impor­tant for me to pull in ideas from different departments so I collaborated with about 10 of the professors from both of these departments," Lau said. 
Lau said that the she feels that this week is extremely important to the students of Saint Mary's, especially because the school is an all­girls college. 
"Because Saint Mary's is an all women's college, it is important for us to celebrate all the achievements that women have had in the past and how we can address con­temporary issues in order to rise above them," she said.

WASHINGTON The Hepublicans attacking Prnsident Baraek Obama's economie stimu­lus package point to a project they dub the "Sin Exprnss" -a high speed rail link bntween Anaheim, Calif., sitn of Disneyland, and Las Vega'>. 
Not so fast.

McGuire added the security on the American University in Cairo's campus and in the dor­mitorii~S is very thorou~h.

"Egypt is aetually quite liberal for a Middle Eastern country and is mueh more receptive to Americans and foreigners than many of the othnr countries in the Middle East," Genovcsf~ said. 
Barben said though she had some initial concerns "about what life would look likn for me as a woman studying abroad in a Middle Eastern country," she was never worrind about vio­lnnee in the city before she camn abroad. 
Tho students said thny have miles as the system most ready to go. 

He and others brushed aside daims that the $8 billion was set aside for Heid's favorite. Obama, who exprnssed strong interest in high-speed rail investment dur­ing the campaign, and his chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, are both from Chicago. Obama's trans­portation secretary, Ray Lahood, also is from Illinois. So is the S1mate's no. 2 Democrat, Richard Durbin. 
Quentin Kopp, chairman of the California High-Speed !{ail Authority, said he was "delighted to see that the momentum has shifted in favor of high-speed train transportation." lie outlined $2 billion in state projects that could be initiated before the Sept. 30, 2012, deadline for commit­ting the $8 billion. Those include electrification of the line from San Jose to San Francisco, home to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

"I would consider any talk about removing us from Cairo as being prPmature and unfit­ting to the situation here," he said. 
"llealistieally," Genovese said, "I don't think thern will be any m1ire attacks." 
Barbee said her "hope is that this was simply an isolated inci­dent and that we can continue on with the rest of our semester here."

IN BRIEF 
Governors unsure about stimulus money 
WASHING'(ON-Governors usually don't argue about whether they should take money from the federal government, j1.1st how much they should get. Yet some chief executives are divided over President Barack Obama's economic stimu­lus plan and whether the billions it offers is always a good deal. 
Gov. Haley Barbour, R-Miss., has said he is con­sidering turning down millions of dollars in unemployment aid because it would force his state to raise taxes when the stimulus money runs out by putting in place a tax on employers. Louisiana Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal shares that concern about strings attached to stimulus dollars as well as the plan's overall approach to dealing with the economic crisis. 
"I don't think the best way to do that is for the government to tax and borrow more money," Jindal said Sunday on "Meet the Press" on. NBC. "If all they do is borrow federal money and give it to the states, all we're really doing is delaying the inevitable. We're eventually going to have to make these hard choices anyway." 
Republican governors in town for the National Governor's Association meeting played down a split over the stimulus plan. Florida Gov. Charlie Crist was among ihose who said they are behind the plan even if they have qualms about it. 
Montana asbestos case goes to trial 
MISSOULA -After years of delays, the peo­ple of a Montana mining town are getting their day in court to see a major chemical company face federal charges accusing it of poisoning their homes and schools with asbestos. 
Opening statements are scheduled for Monday in the case of U.S. vs. W.R. Grace and Co. and five of its executives, who are charged with knowingly exposing the residents of the small town of Libby to the fibrous mineral linked to cancer. 
Prosecutors have had to overcome legal chal­lenges that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
"This trial is one of the most complex and creative criminal prosecutions in the history of environmental regulation," said Andrew King­Hies, an assistant professor at the University of Montana School of Law. 
Red flags present in Stanford scandal 
SEC overlooked warning signs in fraud case involving billionaire R. Allen Stanford 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -For years, there were red flags -so many they could have massed into a crimson blanket. 
As with the Bernard Madoff case, the scandal surrounding billionaire R . Allen Stanford now seems clear and obvious in hind­sight. Yet Stanford man­aged to run his alleged scheme while the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators stood by, well after he arose on their radar screens. 
From his tiny accounting firm's office near a North London fish-and-chips shop to certificates of deposit promising outsized returns sold by a bank in Antigua, ample warning signs over the years suggested Stanford's business wasn't what it seemed. 
Among them: 
-A finding by regulators in June 2007 that Stanford's company lacked enough capital to function properly as a securities brokerage firm. The com­pany paid $20,000 to settle charges by the National Association of Securities Dealers without admitting or denying them.

Animaldoc performs odd surgeries 
Associated Press 
BOSTON -Michael Pavletic has removed a butcher knife from a dog's stomach and tumors froin tiny mice. He's per­formed plastic surgery on injured hawks. 
But he draws the line at giving canines body piercings or fat cats liposuction. "That's just not what I do," said the longtime head of surgery at Boston's Angell Animal Medical Center. 
The 58-year-old surgeon is known as a pioneer in recon­structive animal surgery and is so skilled at saving severely sick and injured animals he is sought out by worried pet own­ers from around the world. Pavletic has cared for thousands of animals, including a dog that swallowed an engagement ring right before the wedding, a cat needing a face reattached and a gorilla that required reconstruc­tive surgery on a finger. 
He's removed bullets from puppies, performed dental work on wolves, and even tended to snakes with throat problems. 
"I've been doing surgery for 30 years and there are very few things I haven't seen," Pavletic said just before going into sur­gery to remove stones from a eat's bladder. 
.and Meet Our Early Childhood Teachers E<l>C·l'I'D Open House Dates: Sundar. L I 09 ... 1:50-.1:0U 
In the past, animals with very serious injuries may have sim­ply been euthanized to avoid life long pain and because surgical techniques on some injuries had yet to be developed. But advancements in medicine cou­pled with pets becoming more a part of families have increased the demand for serious animal surgeries. 
"If it wasn't for him, my cat wouldn't be alive," said Kristin Gagnon, of Hanson. 
Four years ago, Gagnon's Siamese kitten. Max, burned his palate to the bone after chewing an electrical cord. Pavletic reconstructed Max's palate by taking a graft from inside the eat's lip. "What a fantastic job he did," Gagnon said. "He's the only surgeon who could have done this." 
For Pavletic, his love for ani­mals started with sick birds and a·terrier mutt named Tiger. 
As a 6-year-old in Illinois, Pavletic tried to save injured wild birds by giving them water, food and a little attention. It rarely worked. And he was inseparable from his grandpar­ents' terrier until the dog was killed by a neighbor's car. 
But he began his journey into animal surgery after finishing veterinary school at the 
Early Childhood Development Center, Inc. 
at Notre Dame 
University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana in 197 4. 
As an intern at Angell, Pavletic came across a cat named John Glenn that had a tumor on his face. At the time, veterinarians couldn't remove such tumors from animals while a_lso closing the wound using conventional methods. Pavletic turned to an older human reconstructive surgery textbook that suggested a simple skin flap might do the trick. He took what was a routine technique in human surgery and tailored the procedure for a cat. It worked. 
"My interest in surgery grew from there," he said. 
Pavletic held teaching posi­tions at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, La., and Tufts University in North Grafton, Mass., and over the years developed more than 40 surgical techniques. He also authored a textbook, "Atlas of Small Animal Reconstructive S urg_ery," that is about to go into its third edition. 
He returned to Angell in 1988 as head of surgery. That's when the fun started and his reputa­tion grew as a healer of the strangest afflictions. The hospi­tal began seeing oddball cases. 
Once there was a dog with severe stomach pains. Pavletic's team found that the dog had swallowed a pair of red panties. They didn't belong to the dog's female owner. 
"I don't know what happened to that marriage," said Pavletic. 
Another time a family brought in their recently deceased gold­fish and asked the team to per­form an MRI to .determine why it died. The cause: old age. 
There was the case of the Labrador retriever who sudden­ly stopped urinating midway. After various tests, Pavletic dis­co¥ered that the dog had a pel­let stuck in its penis. The bullet had somehow moved down from its bladder after the dog was shot by an unknown assailant. Pavletic surgically removed it -delicately. 

Prisonclosingoffers hope to Camden 
New Jersey prepares to close jail to cut down on crime, violence in one ofnation's poorest cities 
Associated Press 
CAMDEN, N.J.-The majestic Ben Franklin Bridge slices this city's waterfront into two worlds. 
On the south side of the bridge, there's a spiffy red brick minor-league baseball stadium where statues of the Campbell Soup Co.'s Campbell Kids stand sentry and suburban families spend summer evenings. On the north side, chain link fences topped by razor wire surround a cluster of grimly functional buildings that make up Riverfront State Prison. 
After years of requests, the state is preparing to close the prison. 
Activists see the decision as not only an opportunity to rede­velop a 17 -acre tract of prime riverfront land with its view of the Philadelphia skyline, but as the catalyst for the rebirth of the original neighborhood in a city that routinely ranks as one of the nation's poorest and most violent. 
"The prison needs to be out of there for anything to happen on this waterfront," said communi­
-ty activist Rodney Sadler, a marina owner and president of the advocacy group Save Our Waterfront. The prison could close by summer, over the objection of the correction workers' unions. Already, the state Corrections Department has scattered inmates among other New Jersey prisons with plans to transfer the staff as well. Fewer than 650 inmates remain at Riverfront, which can accommo­date 1,000. What will happen to the prison property is not set. 
Rutgers University, whose Camden campus occupies near­by land on the south side of the bridge, is interested in using some of it. 
The prison was never a popu­lar addition to the waterfront. In the early 1980s, the city was in the midst of a long decline and hurting for revenue, and then-Mayor Randy Primas took a deal from the state: $3.4 mil­lion for the land. The state built its prison and Primas tried to persuade residents that it would provide jobs. 
The prison was opened in 1985. 
From current Mayor Gwendolyn Faison to neighbor­hood activists, almost no one believes it brought much lasting benefit. 
What's more, other sections of the waterfront began chang­ing -making the prison an increasingly incongruous sight in one section of the city that has prospered. 
Within a few years of the prison opening, the south waterfront began to change. RCA and Campbell Soup closed their last factories and an aquarium opened. It was the first of several attractions, including the baseball park and an amphitheater, which have turned the area into an enter­tainment destination. Luxury apartments and an upscale tav­ern followed. 
While those developments might help the city's image, many residents don't see how they help life in the neighbor­hoods where most of the people live. 
Over the decades, the city as a whole has continued its long decline. Things got so bad that in 2002 the state put up $175 million to jump-start redevelop­ment and took control of some aspects of the local government. 
Educational institutions such as Rutgers and Camden County College have used a mixture of state money and their own to expand, as have hospitals. While there's been some private investment, some of the splashiest private proposals in the residential neighborhoods away from the waterfront have not been realized.

The secret lives of graduate students 
Spring is technically just around tho corner, and everywhere people's minds are turning to love -which those cynics among us might put in heavy scare quotes. Last W!H1k, British tabloids reported that a thirteen­year-old boy con­ceived a child with his fifteen-year-old girlfriend; days later. they reported that the father might also have been a sixteen­year-old, or possi­bly a fourteen­year-old (no word yet whether all four will appear on Maury Povich, 
·though). Closer to home," Bristol Palin gave her 11rst interview to Pox News, during which she said that "everyonn should be abstinent or whatnvnr, but it's not realistic at all." Iter mother, mean­while, had some unof'licial advice !"or everyone: "Hey, don't get pregnant. Well, get beyond that when it hap­pens, and then you dna! with it." And here at Notre Dame, debates over dat­ing, hooking up and the contravention of parietals have broken out in pan­els, Letters to the Editor and dining halls. Even the "Info 4 Life" posters in the library bathrooms take time out of their story about E.-Heserves to wax romantic. 
But lost among the tales of lep­rechaun love and l"reshman lust is the graduate student population. After all1 we graduate students are just as enti­tled to think about how we are or arnn't spending our extracurricular time. So it's time to take a good look at the dating life or graduate students -an nxamination that, by tho way, will remain thoroughly aeadnrnk (i.e., hands-of!') for all you non-graduate studnnts out thnre (son du Lac, p. 


126). 

Highty"hour-a-wenk jobs tnnd to afTnel your pnrsonality after a whil!~, and graduatn school is no nxception. Whereas doing finance or i-banking in Manhattan turns !Wen tlw most staid pro!"essional into the fratboy type (though recently, mank-deprnssivn would apply just as well), the long, lonely hours planted in !"ront of a book or a Bunsen burner can sap the nxtro­vnrsion !"rom anyonn. Instead or car­ing about <:orporatn law or Natty Light, though, scholars-in-training dinH:t their nnergy toward their own area or rnsnan:h; their social side, so badly undnrused, fuses with tlwir pro­!"essional sid!~ until they start to exist exclusively as extensions or thnir top­ics. Parties. turn hopelessly aeadnmie aftnr a !"ow hours --I on<:n witnnssed a group of lhnologians takn turns try­ing to recite the Nicene Crned as a parlor game of sorts. And, for tho sakn of full disclosure, l'vn bonn known to make a Charlemagne jok!~ or two. 
Arn you trying to have any mnaning­ful interaction with one? What you might not realize is that when you get beyond small talk with a graduate student, you're not only talking to them, you're talking to their library (or laboratory) as well. So if you, say, go on a date with a psychologist, you're really also dating Jung and Freud and Pinker; with a historian, let's hope you like Foucault. Hegel and/or Marx. I understand that stu­dents of litnrature are contractually obligated to utter the words "post­modern" and "Sylvia Plath" at lfmst six times an hour. Of course, many of thnsn pnoplo an~ also training to become lec:turers and discussion lead­nrs, which means that they will some­day bn required to hold forth as a supreme authority for about an hour at a time on tlwir topic. Somt~ manage to eoneeal this side of themselves suc­cessfully; others see any social inter­action as a chance to practice. 
But, the lack of a dental plan notwithstanding, graduate studnnts actually have a pretty good life. They get a stnady paycheck, they get sum­mnrs ofT and they got to pursun some­thing that, hopefully, they really like. They also get to share their passion with students and with their scholarly peers--and occasionally, such inter­actions (the latter ones) lead to real romance. After all, who else is suited to undnrstand ing all of the personal and prol"essional sacrifices and demands of graduate school and the academic life but another scholar? In !"act, graduate students like this life so mueh, they signed up for it. So in casn you feel like graduate students are so pitiable that they need a hug, well, first of all, they aren't, and second, see du Lae, p. 126.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Take Back the Night 

The week of Feb. 22 to March 1, the Gender Relations Center on campus will be hosting Sexual Assault Awareness week. Along with other events, today, people on campus will be marching to Take Back the Night. Take Back the Night is thought to have begun in the late 1800s when women citizens in ­London protested the fear and violence they experi­enced at night. "Reclaim-the night" took place in Belgium in 1976 by women who were attending the 
 International Tribunal on Crimes against Women . This included a march with candles to spread the word and honor those who have been sexually abused. This came stateside in 1978 in San Francisco by Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media. The term "Take Back the Night" originated from a memorial read by Anne Pride a year before. The women were marching to protest rape, pornog­raphy and to protest all types of sexual violence. Take Back the Night is now done in many cities and locales, and the Gender Relations Center is proud that the march will be taking place at Our Lady's University. It will be followed by a bonfire and SpeakOut, for all those interested. 
Although Take Back the Night originated with women essentially trying to reclaim the night, we hope that the march is attended by both women and men. Sexual violence does not just affect women. Although sexually abused men are a smaller percent­age of those affected by sexual violence, men of all ages are affected by the outcomes of sexual violence. The University of Notre Dame prides itself on being a tight-knit community of supporting students and fac­ulty. We hope that this is manifested by support, by both men and women, toward the end of sexual vio­lence.

Basketball cheer in poor taste 

I had the opportunity to attend the men's basketball game against USF a week ago with my 14-year-old son. We had seats in the section adjacent to the student section, the "Leprechaun Legion." I was shocked to hear the students' shout "sucks" after each player from the opposing team was introduced. As students of the University of Notre Dame, you are held to higher standards, whether you like it or not. It goes with being enrolled at the finest Catholic University in the land. I enjoy most if not all of your other cheers, (left, right, left, right, sit down for instance). So I ask, please for your own sake and the sake of a proud alum, clean it up!

Superpovver debate ended 

There are certain unanswerable questions in this life, but now one can be checked off the list. The answer to "Which superpower would you have?" is telekinesis. Wait, what about super strength or flying? Invisibility has to be up there, doesn't it? All of these powers are encompassed by telekinesis. Super strength is easy, if a need ever arises where heavy things have to be moved, think it and it's done. Superman can't even do that-he· actually has to lift it. 
Okay, now what about flying? If you don't believe you can apply telekinesis to yourself, then lift your shoes or get on a bike and make it fly (super speed, ifyou want it). Since telekinesis involves moving matter with your mind, you can then apply it to gasses and liquids. Think of the possibilities! Take yourselfto the bottom of the ocean in a bubble! Make it rain by lowering the pressure in the atmosphere! Vanquish foes by moving all their vital organs out of their bodies! 
Alright, but what about invisibility? This is where it gets interesting. If you believe that telekinesis can move all particles, then bending light wouldn't be out of the question. Even ifthat turns out to be impossible, invisi­bility is only for peeping toms and robbers. 
Besides moving photons, you could also be your own Hadron Collider. Ifyou aspire to be a super villain instead of a super hero why not make a black hole? The possibilities are endless and encompass all the useful superpowers making telekinesis the superior superpow­er.

Thanks for Bouts 
This letter is intended for all of those involved in my 2009 Bengal Bouts journey. Thank you. Thank you for making my experience so enjoyable over the last four months. Although a senior, I entered into the Bengal Bouts a lowly novice back in the final weeks of October to begin my training. Since then, I have not only learned the importance of the Bengal Bouts and the Holy Cross missions, but I have also learned a great deal about myself. The Bouts have taught me that no goal is out of reach if you put in the hard work and dedication needed to succeed. In October, not knowing anything about boxing, I set a goal for myself of winning one fight. Thankfully, this past Sunday I was able to accomplish my goal and move into the quarter­final round. Unfortunately, after an unbelievably gutsy and gritty match with sophomore Jack Peterson, my journey in the Bouts came to an end in a split decision. Congratulations Jack, great fight, good luck with the rest of the tournament. It was not until after defeat and discussions with family members that I realized how special the Bouts have been for me. As cliche as it might sound, I worked incredibly hard and devoted myself to becoming the best boxer I could, and I came out not just a better boxer, but a better per­son. 
I have to thank the management staff for all of their work and preparation. You guys (and girls) made the process effortless and allowed the box­ers to focus on fund raising and boxing. Captains and coaches, I cannot thank you enough for all of the time and knowledge you devoted to the Bouts. You taught me the importance of hard work and the true meaning of the Bouts. Thank you. Also, I want to say thank you to a handful of friends/box­ers that I worked out with every single day. I don't want a shout out enlarging their egos so I will leave their names off, but you know who you are. Thank you. You guys were great. We had a lot of fun, you guys taught me a lot about boxing and we developed great friendships in the process. Finally, thank you to my family. With the exception of my mother, who understandably could not watch her son get knocked around, many of my family mem­b~rs showed up for my first-round match. My father, my four brothers (my oldest brother being the best corner man anyone could ask for), uncles and cousins, my best friends and my roommates, all of the people I consider family ... Thank you. Your support and love during my three minutes and 45 seconds of battle made four months of sweat more than worth it. The Bengal Bouts is a special event and I encourage anyone who has not made it out to the fights to make sure you make it out to the semifinals on Tuesday and the fmals Saturday. And again, thank you.

U-WIRE 

Landing an internship comes with a price tag 
Parents, student and others gladly pay thousands of dollars in college tuition to ensure a financially sound existence after graduation. The American dream is found­ed on the ideal that ifa person works hard enough, he or she can achieve anything. A 
Richelle Buser 

student must spend countless hours study­
University of

ing, network like crazy, land a few Kansas internships along the University way, complete a Daily Kansan degree and then maybe with some luck a job offer will appear. Persevere, we're told, and it'll pay off. But what ifno matter how much effort you put into your aspira­tions, there were people out there without the grades, ambition or skills who could still snatch up opportunities you deserve? 
Turns out there's a fast track where some students get to skip over all the aches and pains, but still achieve the goals of their more dedicated peers. 
Starting-level jobs achieved through internships are a common form of employ­ment for fresh graduates. For most of us, achieving our dream jobs will require a combination of experience, personal zest for a subject and a decent GPA. Pretty soon "a few extra thousand dollars" may be added to that list. 
In her article "Internships for Sale" in the Wall Street Journal, Ellen Gamerman exposed the disturbing tactic some are using to get ahead. Rather than applying for an internship position the old-fashioned way, ritzy parents now have the option of buying their child an internship at auctions across the United States. Of course these auctions are usually found at only the most elite universities and high schools. These parents are willing to spend ridiculous amounts of money. For example, a one­week internship at Electronic Arts sold for a whopping $4,000 during an auction at the Urban School of San Franci'ico. This is an absolutely unfair advantage. 
Sadly, auctions are just the beginning. 

Timothy Noah of Slate magazine writes in his article "Opportunity for Sale" that organizations like University of Dreams will guarantee an internship-for a price. Of course, University of Dreams says students are simply paying a "tuition fee" ranging from $5,000 to $10,000. That's not far from the cost of in-state tuition for a semester at the University of Kansas. As ifthose who can afford to buy internships aren't already benefiting from their financial stability (i.e., affording the best universities, tutors and housing). 
With the current economic situation, many students are feeling the pressure to ,ensure jobs after graduation. Terrified at the thought of another summer without an internship, desperate students may do whatever it takes to build a resume and eventually land a job, even ifit means fork­ing out some extra cash. Companies taking advantage of students' desires to succeed by selling internships is just wrong. 
I thought the point of an internship was to give students experience that would assist them when establishing a career-not put them deeper in debt. I can't imagine how these companies justify exploiting an ado­lescent's goals. 
But the students are at fault, too. After all, what is the point of spending so much money to attend college ifyou still have to buy your way into the work world? I also can't help but wonder how much respect interns who got their positions via mommy and daddy's money would have iftheir peers were aware of their situation. 
If you can't land an internship on your own, maybe you should re-evaluate your dedication to school and your major -not take opportunities away from qualified indi­viduals or encourage dishonorable compa­nies.

8:28. Golden statutes so close I can smell 'em. Programming goes live. 

8:30. Big band music swells, lights come up on a stage framed in Swarovski crystal. Hugh Jackman enters, makes a New Zealand joke. 
8:34. Major dance sequence in a comedy show tune parodying the best pic nominees. Anne Hathaway is pulled up on stage and sings a duet with Hugh. Another dance sequence with people in full spandex body suits. I am not so subtly reminded of last year's Doctor Faustus here at Notre Dame. 
8:40. Contractual obligation for Hugh to mention Brangelina. Roommate notes how Jennifer Alliston must be throwing chocolates at her TV 
8:41. Hugh is convinced that after 15 nominations, Meryl Streep must be using steroids. 
8:45. Whoopi Goldberg proclaims, "It's not easy playing a nun," intro­

ducing Amy Adams in the Best Supporting Actress category. Each nomi­.. nee is introduced by a former Best Actress. Penelope Cruz wins. 
8:53. Tina Fey arrives. It was only a matter of tin1e. She's joined by Steve Martin. Hilarity ensues. They give the award for Best Screenplay to 
· "Milk." Sean Penn has tears in his eyes. Obligatory plug for gay rights. Crowd goes wild. 
9:01. "Slum dog Millionaire" wins for Best Adapted Screenplay. 

9:03. Jennifer Alliston presents with Jack Black. ("She's throwing chocolate at him from behind stage!") Jack Black admits he bets every­thing on Pixar.

Will Andrew Stanton ever get tired of accepting Oscars for his animated movies?

9:16. Daniel Craig and Sarah Jessica Parker walk on to present Art Direction. "Benjamin Button" wins.

Just curious ... 
9:23. "Benjamin Button" wins for makeup. Thus begins the longest line of names ever uttered in one speech. Everyone who ever worked on the film is mentioned. 
9:26. Robert Pattinson makes a really bad vampire joke. Check. Awesome montage of 2008 movies love scenes set to Coldplay's "Lover's in Japan." HSM 3 had three token clips, which is three clips too many. 
9:32. Ben Stiller makes a pointed fashion statement consisting of a large beard and Blues Brothers sunglasses reminiscent of Joaquin Phoenix's current state. Natalie Portman looks fantastic in pink. The Phoenix joke is falling flat. As Portman sincerely introduces the Cinematography nominees, Stiller begins ainllessly walking around the set, and the joke gets funnier. 
9:37. The lost doggy frnding his way home MasterCard commercial ·that made me cry during the Oscars five years ago makes me cry again. 
9: .JPW Mass, only the .Jl'W style wasn't so intentional. Is that style points the .JPW lashionista. or does .Jessica Bielloso them?

It's the greatest hits of all the musieals your high school ever put on. Relevance? Not mw:h. Beyonce starts singing Moulin Houge, and is it any secret Baz Lohrmann choreographed? Zac Efl'ron Vanessa Hudgens have just appeared, along with the Mama Mia from Mean Girls. Oh, okay, it's all the couples from musicals this year. Hugh yells, "The musical is back!" And you just jinxed it. 
10:03. The cast of former Best Supporting Actors arrives. Alert the sob parade, Ledger's corning up. Kevin Kline introduces Ilnath. Close pan LP.dger's family. lin's won it. The crowd risP.s to an ovation. Mom, and sister take the stage. Sean PPOn looks like he's going to cry. Again.

It's Rourke performance, though, that will be remembered long from now as not only one of the great comeback stories in ftlm history, but as one of the most iconic, true­to-life performances in screen history. Sean Penn may have acted exceptionally, but Rourke did something a whole lot more special -he lived his role.

Talk about owing somebody. Having nominat­ed her six times, the Academy was literally look­ing for a reason to give Kate Winslet a Best Actress Award. They skipped her performance in "Revolutionary Road," only to bump her up from supporting actress to a lead actress for her role in "The Reader," which was the better of her two performances. This is only the begin­ning of a growing collection of golden statutes for Winslet, who is quickly establishing herself as the best actress of this generation.

Penelope Cruz had been gaining steam in the late stages of the film awards circuit and emerged as an almost clear favorite heading into the Oscars.

However, it was Marissa Tomei's stunning turn as an over-the-hill strip­per in "The Wrestler" that commanded the screen like no other supporting actress nominat­ed this year.

Belles finish fifth at conference meet 
By ERIC PRISTER Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's finished in fifth place at the three-day MIAA Championship meet, losing to fourth place Olivet by only two points.. 
The two-point margin was decided in the final event of the championships, the 400-yard freestyle relay, in which the Belles fell to Olivet by two and a half seconds. 
Despite finishing fifth, the Belles were able to break 15 school records at the meet, including five by freshman Audrey Dalrymple, four by freshman Eva Cavadini and three by sophomore Maggie Williams. 
"Due to the closeness of [the loss to Olivet], I believe that next season we will work even harder to accomplish goals as a team, rather than channeling the focus on our individual goals," Dalrymple said. "Although, as a whole everyone swam very well at conference and we broke a lot of school records." 
Dalrymple, Cavadini and Williams have performed con­sistently well for the Belles throughout the season, and provide a good outlook on the Belles' future due to their youth. Dalrymple cites her ded­ication to her sport as the rea­son for her team's and her own success in the championship. 
"I find that at a champi­onship swim meet it is a great opportunity to showcase one's hard work over the entire sea­son and channel it into those final races," she said. "I am able to perform at the best of my ability because after train­ing so intensely I can stand behind the blocks knowing that I have done everything in my power to prepare for the swim ahead and all that is left is the race itself, which is the fun part." 
Another Belle who had a career day in the tournament was freshman Barbara Beidler. She broke three personal records, including the 50-yard, the 100-yard and the 200-yard freestyle events, along with four other relay events. 
This was the final meet for the Belles, but Dalrymple will continue to compete. Her times in the 100-yard and 200-yard breaststroke qualify her for "B" cuts in the Division III Championships, which will be held March 18-21 at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.

With such an impressive final height, Saxer also auto­matically qualified for the NCAA Championships, which will be held March 13-14 at Texas A&M University.

"Rincon ran exceptionally well," Piane said. "If things had broken just a little bit dif­ferently, he could have won it." 
In the mile, senior Dan Clark used a perfectly-timed lean at the finish line to earn second-place honors, while freshmen Jordan Carlson also won points for the Irish with a sixth-place finish.

"We had a lot of good things happen," Piane said-. "We really did."

Associated Press · 
ORLANDO, Fla. Dwight Howard had 32 points and 17 rebounds, and the Orlando Magic withstood a career-high 50 points by Dwyane Wade to rout~the Miami Heat 122-99 on Sunday. 
Hedo Turkoglu had 20 points and Rafer Alston added 12 points and nine assists for the Magic, who have won 12 of the past 15 games against their Sunshine State rival. 
Wade was potent from inside and out, scoring with high-flying dunks and soaring jumpers that had even some Magic fans chanting "M-V-P!" Miami's do-it-all guard had previ­ously scored 48 twice in his career, and had 43 points two times earlier this season. 

Wa.fte hit a pair of 3­pointers in an 11-4 Heat run to start the third quarter, closing the gap to 68-57. But the Magic would come back with a series of 3s to go ahead 91-72 at the end of the period to offset Wade's performance. 
The Heat never got close in the fourth, and Miami coach Erik Spoelstra cleared most of the · bench midway through the period ­except for Wade, who was left in until his shot over Courtney Lee gave him 50 points. 
But it was the Magic's newest player that made the biggest difference. 

Alston, acquired from Houston last Friday, has taken the ballhandling responsibilities off Orlando's free-shooting perimeter players. The speedy guard has allowed the Magic to return to their usual rotation and play the up-tempo, pick­and-roll style game that had them looking like real title contenders before All-Star point guard Jameer Nelson tore the labrum in his right shoul­der Feb. 2. 
Nelson has since had 
season-ending surgery, and the Magic are count­ing on Alston to fill the void. He had them rolling from the start against Miami. 
Driving and dishing from all angles, Alston had seven assists and a pair of 3-pointers in the opening quarter. Howard converted a 3-point play after a powerful dunk over Wade and Udonis Haslem, the last of 13 straight points by the Magic to open up a 21--12 lead early. Howard's 15 points in the quarter just about canceled out all the acrobatic shots Wade had en route to 16 points in the period. 
IN BRI.EF Crabtree to delay surj!ery
until after NFL coml5ine 
INDIANAPOLIS -Michael Crabtree was quick on his feet Sunday, and if he does the same thing for NFL scouts next month the stress fracture in his left foot might soon be forgotten. 
In an odd scene at the league's annual scouting combine, Crabtree strolled quickly across the media room moments after Patriots coach Bill Belichick finished speaking. He walked up a couple of steps, smiled at reporters and then gave a 20-second statement confirming the decision to delay surgery so he could run in front of scouts during next month's person­al workout. 
"It's an old injury that I've been hav­ing, but I never had any pain in it/' he said. "I will run my 40, and after that 1­will have surgery." 
With "that, Crabtree exited stage left, taking no questions. 
Clearly, it was an effort to stem the fallout that began Saturday when it was revealed he needed surgery. 

Sooner's Griffin status 
uncertain after concussion 
NORMAN, Okla. -Preseason All­America Blake Griffin's status was uncertain for No. 2 Oklahoma's game against Kansas on Monday night after he sustained a concus­sion in a loss to Texas. 
Sooners coach Jeff Capel said Griffin would be held out of practice Sunday, but he won't know until game day whether his star player will be able to go against the 15th­ranked Jayhawks on Monday night in a game that will give one team the lead in the Big 12 title race. 
"The most important thing is him and his future. You don't want to do anything to risk any further dam­age, so that's the most important thing," Capel said before practice Sunday. "We're going to proceed with caution with this and make sure he's OK. 
"And we'll move on whichever way we have to, with him or with­out." 
Mickelson nearly blows 
biggest lead of career 
LOS ANGELES -Phil Mickelson nearly blew the biggest lead of his career, then had to scramble for par to avoid a playoff. 
When his roller-coast week at Riviera ended Sunday, the Northern Trust Open turned out to be one of his more satisfying victories. 
After watching tee shots sail in every direction, turning a four-shot lead into a two-shot deficit with three holes to play, Mickelson recovered with back-to-hack birdies· and stepped to the 18th tee with a one-shot lead . 
Then, he had to bury some demons. 
Two years ago, Mickelson had a one-shot lead until making a sloppy bogey on the historic finishing hole and losing in a playoff. This time, he poured his tee shot down the middle of the fairway and two­putted for par from 60 feet, making a tough 6-footer for the win.

Bucks end team's win streak-at five 
By CHRIS MICHALSKI 
Sporrs Writer 
No. 25 Notre Dame snapped its five-match winning streak in a big way on Saturday. 
The Irish (6-5) fell to No. 3 Ohio State 7-0 in Columbus. 
The Irish were forced to take on the high-powered Buckeyes without the bles, although second and third doubles were kept close, both ending 8-6. 
The young team will contin­ue to gain valua.ble experi­ence against top-notch com­petition, as its upcoming schedule will feature No. 31 Kentucky, No. 13 Texas A&M and No. 19 Michigan.

and stayed in South Bend for treatment. He is currently day-to-day, but coach Bobby Bayliss said he hopes to have him available for Monday's match against Kentucky. 
With Helgeson, the team's only upperclassman, out, the Irish played with an especial­ly young lin'eup. Four sopho­mores and two freshmen filled the six singles spots. Sophomore Stephen Haverls moved up to first singles, and lost 6-4, 6-0 to Ohio State's No. 4 Bryan Koniecko. 
Sophomore Daniel Stahl was the only Irish player to force a third set, losing 4-6, 6-2, 6-2 to No, 22 Steven Moneke. 
Ohio State also swept dou-
Bayliss said. 
"Our guys came to Notre Dame so that they could play against teams like these." 
This overwhelming loss could potentially knock the Irish out of the top-25, but once again Bayliss is not con­cerned. 
"If we get caught up in wor­rying about our ranking we will not be focused on the more important goals, like being ready to compete when it matters," he said. 
The Irish will return home today to take on the Kentucky Wildcats at 4 p.m. in the Eck Tennis Facility.

Irish unable to overco111e Huskies 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Sports Writer 

Notre Dame was hanging in against top-ranked, undnl'eat­ed Connecticut, right up until that 22-1 run in tho second hall'. 
An Ashley Barlow layup with 16:11 to go in the second half put the Irish on top 43­41, but the Irish would not make another field goal until forward Becca Brusz·ewski nailed a jumper at the 9:12 mark. 
By the end of the gamn, tho Irish became the Huskins' lat­est victim, losing 76-(,(J ­Connecticut's smallest margin of' victory all season. · 
"I thought defensivnly we had a number of breakdowns during that stretch. We were unable to find I Huskies guard He nee I Montgomery and IJiuskies forward Maya! Moore and they hit three or four threes in that stretch, and then wn weren't able to score," Irish coach Mul'fet MeGraw said. "Wo had a eou­pin of' bad shots, a couple of' turnovers, and that was obvi­ously tho game." " 
Moore, last year's Big East Player of the Year, had 1S points and eight rebounds in thn win. Montgomery had a gamo-high 20 points and eight assists, compared to only two turnovers. 
"!Montgomery is] up for player of tho year in the coun­try. She runs her team very intelligently -eight assists, two turnovers, which is just a phe?OI,?enal ,assist-to~tun~o,ver ratto, McGraw said. Sho shot the ball well, she had a lot of points, she played great defensively. She's a terrific player." 
Despite being down 19 points with less than 10 min­utes to play, the Irish refused to give up and quickly fought back to a more manageable deficit. A Lindsay Schrader jumper with 3:42 remaining in the game tlw Irish only nine points behind. 
"I thought we really battled -Schrader and Barlow in particular, and Becca [Bruszewskil. I thought they played really well. I thought they just battled," McGraw said. 
McGraw said that she was glad to see her toam fight back in the second half, and that it just missed its opportu­nities to win the game. 
"We stayed within our game plan, outside of that run. It's a nine point game with four minutes left," she said. "I thought wn had plenty of chances, we just missed a lot of shots-a lot of easy shots." 
Barlow lod the Irish in scor­ing with 18 points, while Schrader recorded her second straight double-double with 1S points and 11 rebounds. 
As a team, the Irish hung tough on the glass against Conneeticut, and outrebound­ed tho Huskies 47-46. 
Notre Dame started the game out well, with Barlow nailing a 3-pointer as part of a 6-0 Irish run to start the game. The six-point deficit was Connecticut's largest of the season. 
"I thought Ashley got us off to a great start. She hit her first three, and I thought that really hnlped us gain a little confidence. And she hit a cou­plP more shots and I thought, in the first half at least, she was shooting the ball well," MeGraw said. 
The one lesson McGraw said she can take out of the loss was that her team definitely has the tenacious attitude nec­essary for postseason success. 
"I think it's like we've be11n all year. We're fighting, we don't quit," she said. "I think we're fighters and they're going to work hard and finish strong starting with Tuesday night [against Syracuse]." 
Connecticut coach Geno Auriemma said in his postgame news conference that it will be harder to draw coaching points out of the nar­row victory for his squad. 
"Like I told the team, you're at somewhat of a disadvan­tage when you play at Connecticut, because the les­sons that you learn to really help you become a better team are when you lose ... you can really learn a lot when you lose, but it's a disadvan­tage because we almost never lose," he said. "So, how do you teach your guys to learn from wins'? That's hard to do." 
Note: 
+Tho crowd of 14,533 at Sunday's game was the largest crowd for a Connecticut home game this season. The game was played at the XL Center in llartf'ord -the site of the 2009 Big East tournament ­and not the Huskies' usual home court, the Gampel Pavilion in Storrs, Conn.

Team splits games at Nike Invitational 
Notre Dame wins ttvo over Sacramento State, loses two to No.5 Stanford in California 
By MOLLY SAMMON Sports Writer 
Notre Dame went 2-2 over the weekend spent at Stanford University's Nike Invitational, its second tournament of the young season. The Irish (3-4} had 
two  _ wins  against  
Sacramento  State  
University,  two  losses  

against the No. 5 Stanford Cardinal and a rain-out cancellation against Western Kentucky. 
Friday proved to be the best day of the tournament for the Irish, as neither of the day's pitchers, senior Brittney Bargar and sopho­more Jody Valdivia, yielded an earned run. 
"It felt good, and it was nice to get out there, hav­
ing everything working and good pitches," Bargar said. "It made the game more in control, in my hands." 
The first game of the invi­tational was a 4-1 win over Sacramento State. A strong offensive third inning, con­tained crucial hits from senior Linda Kohan, fresh­man Alexa Maldonado and junior Christine Lux. 
The second game on Friday was a 2-0 defeat from Stanford University. Notre Dame almost had a chance to come back in the fourth inning when they loaded the bases, but were unable to take advantage of the situation. 
On the second day of play, The Irish took on the same two teams in hopes of maintaining their proved dominance over the 
Sacramento State Hornets, and getting a little revenge over the Cardinal. In the 5­2 loss to Stanford, Valdivia let up five earned runs in four innings. Offensively, Maldonado, freshman Sadie Pitzenberger and sopho­mores Erin Marrone and Katie Fleurry each had hits, leading to the two Irish runs of the game, both scored by Maldonado. 
"We gave up some big hits in big situations," Bargar said. "In both games, we just came up a little short." 
Team morale turned around later in the day, as the Irish defeated the Hornets once again, this time an 11-0 rout. Marrone hit her first home run of the season, and junior infielder Heather Johnson had four RBis. 

"Every single girl down the line was making solid contact," Bargar said. 
Due to excessive rain, the scheduled Sunday game against Western Kentucky was terminated just short of three scoreless innings. 
"We need all the little pieces of our game to get together more," Marrone said of the coming week's practices. "This week it's a matter of getting everything to click in all the different areas." 
The next stop for the team is the Wolfpack Challenge in Raleigh, North Carolina, where they will take on Cansius, Buffalo and the home team, North Carolina State.

Abt scores 
four goals inIrishvvin 
By NATHANIEL LEE 
Sports Writer 
Coming off a tough home loss to No.1 Northwestern, No. 11 Notre Dame defeated Ohio State 14-11 Sunday at the Loftus Sports Center to improve to 2-1 on the season. 
"We always expect a good game from Ohio State, and they were as tough as we expected," Irish coach Tracy Coyne said. "It's early in the season, but we want to earn a spot in the NCAA tournament, so a win over a g{)od regional opponent is important." 
Sophomore Kailene Abt paced the Irish with four goals. Sophomore Shaylyn Blaney net­ted three, as did senior Jill Byers. 
Jayme Beard led the Buckeyes to an early 3-1 lead, but the Irish responded at 
20:33 with an Abt goal off an assist from junior Gina Scioscia. She tied it up with a score of her own at 16:56 with an assist from sophomore Kaitlin Keena. 
Ohio State staged a comeback and tied the game up at 5-5 with an unassisted goal at 6:53. Byers followed seconds later to get the lead back for the Irish. Blaney tallied a goal for a 7-5 lead, but the Buckeyes earned two of their own to tie the game at the end of the period. 
Notre Dame opened up the second period with a 5-0 run with goals from Abt, Byers, Sciascia and Blaney in the first five minutes. Ohio State attempted to mount a come­back, bringing the score to 12-9 at 16:42, but sophomore Ansley Stewart notched two goals to secure the win. 
"[Blaney] really sparked our offense in the second half," Coyne said. "The run we went on earned a good close game for us." 
Senior Erin Goodman earned the win in goal with six saves. 
"This showed that we can shake off a tough loss, and come out playing tough soon after," Coyne said. "That kind of back to back competition will be key when we get to tourna­ment time." 
The Irish will host the Stanford Cardinal at the Loftus Sports Center Saturday at 2 p.m.

Hicks has seven points as No.8 Irish defeat Penn State 
Junior attackman scores four goals and has three assists to help Notre Dame to 13-8 win over Nittany Lions 
By MIKE GOTIMER Sports Writer 
No. 8 Notre Dame improved to 2-0 on the sea­son with its 13-8 win over Penn State on Sunday ·in University Park, largely in part to junior attackman Neal Hicks' seven point per­form.ance. 
Hicks followed up a career day Feb. 14, in which he scored three goals against Loyola, with another scoring barrage against the Nittany Lions. He finished the game with four goals and three assists. 
The Irish jumped out to an early lead over Penn State, scoring two man-up goals by senior Ryan Hoff and junior Grant Krebs by the 8:37 mark of the first quarter. 
Then Hicks got started. The junior picked up his first goal of the day off an assist by junior Mike Creighton to give the Irish a 3-0 lead, where it stayed for the rest of the first period. 
With 10:41 remaining in the first half, the Nittany Lions notched their first goal of the game to make it 3-1, but the Irish responded with a goal by senior Duncan Swezey with 5:24 remaining in the second 
period to make the score 4­
1. Following Penn State's second goal near the end of the first half, Hicks notched his second goal of the game off a feed from Krebs with 
1:56 left in the first half to send the Irish into the half with a 5-2 lead. 
The second half started with a s~oring frenzy as the two teams combined for five goals in just over four min­utes of play. Penn State cut the Irish lead to 5-4 with goals from Conrad Ridgway and Jack Forster. However, the Irish responded with five unanswered goals to take control of the game. The Irish run began with Hoff's second goal of the game, which came with three min­utes elapsed in the second half. Sophomore David Earl scored 35 seconds later and Hicks put his thir.d goal in the net off an assist from senior Dan Gibson with 
10:55 left in the third period to give the Irish an 8-4 lead. 
The Irish opened up a five goal lead off a man-up goal from junior Matt Ciambella, assisted by Hicks, to give Notre Dame a 9-4 lead at the end of the third quarter. 
Sophomore Jake Marmul got the Irish to 10 goals for the second time in as many games with his first career

Mick Doyle added an RBI to tie the score at three. 
Irish junior starter Eric Maust retired 11 of the next 12 b'atters after the first inning before walking three straight Illini in the fifth inning. Illinois took advantage of Maust's struggle with his command, capitalizing on a three-run triple from third baseman Dominic Altobelli. 
The Irish cut the lead to 7-5 heading into the bottom of the seventh. Junior designated hit­ter Matt Grosso then belted a two-run homer to tie the game. The next five Notre Dame hit­ters all reached base, with sophomore catcher Cameron McConnell singling home two go-ahead runs. 
After Pollock drove home another run with a sacrifice fly, Barnes broke the game open with a three-run shot over the left field fence. The eight-run explosion in the seventh inning gave the Irish a 13-7 lead they would not relinquish. 
Sophomore ~:eliever Cole Johnson picked up the win for Notre Dame, allowing one run in three innings. Maust finished with three earned runs given up on five hits in five innings of work.

"Awesome," Irish coach Mike Brey said of Peoples' game. "You could feel it com­ing. He was flat-out fabu­lous." 
Peoples' contributions were especially welcome given the struggles of Notre Dame's top offensive player early on. Forward Luke Harangody, who entered the game aver­aging over 24 points per con­test, scored only one point in the first half. 

The reigning Big East Player of the Year was instrumental, though, in helping the Irish finish the game. Despite pick­ing up his fourth foul with

Notre Dame 9, Purdue 4 (10 innings) 
The Irish rallied from a 4-1 eighth inning deficit to force extra innings on Sunday, then scored five runs in the top of the lOth inning for the win over rival Purdue. 
Notre Dame struck first in the top of the third after a Jeremy Barnes one-out triple and a wild pitch. The Boilermakers then answered with two runs in the bottom of the inning off sophomore starter Evan Danieli. Purdue then increased their lead to 4-1 in the sixth inning, touching up Irish reliever Todd Miller. 
The Irish then showed off their clutch hitting ability in the eighth inning. After two outs to open the inning, McConnell singled and junior Casey Martin walked. Junior Brayden Ashdown then laced a huge pinch-hit single to score both McConnell and Martin to. bring Notre Dame within a run. 
Ashdown then advanced to second on a wild pitch, and came around to score the tying run on ·a Doyle single. 
The game remained tied until the lOth frame, when Ashdown gave the Irish another clutch RBI single and a 5-4 lead. Tate followed with a two-run dou­ble, and junior Ryan Intelkofer and Pollock each drove in a run to stretch the lead to four runs. 
Junior reliever Steven Mazur picked up the win for Notre Dame after pitching two score­less innings. The Irish bullpen held the Boilermakers score­less over the last four innings. 
Four Irish players -Tate, Doyle, Intelkofer, and Barnes ­all led the offense with two hits each. 
Notre Dame will head south again next weekend, traveling to the Phoenix Classic to take on Gonzaga, Dayton and Creighton.

Friday night, freshman Billy Maday's goal with 1:21 lel't in ovnrtirne gavn the Irish the win in a game they once led 3-1. 
Christiaan Minella got Notre Dame on the board just 3:03 into the game, n~directing a Christian Hanson shot from the top of the lel't circle past Maverick goalie Jeremie DuPont. After Jeric Agosto tied the game at one 39 seconds into the second period, Hanson said. "And I am c..oncerned with that." 
The game went into overtime and almost seemed destined for a shootout until Maday took a feed from Kevin Deeth at the bottom of the right cirele and fired the pu_ck past DuPont for the win. 
The Irish victory, combined with a Miami (OHl loss to Northern Michigan, meant that Notre Dame needed only a tie Saturday night to wrap up the CCI lA top spot. 
The Irish got even more Saturday, thanks to stellar defensive play and stalwart goaltending from Pearce.

Despite the two points on Friday, Jackson said he thought Hanson played better in the second game of the series. 
"I thought he was actually better Saturday night. This time of year you can't just take 10 days off and get back into thfl heat of battle just like that," Jackson said. "I thought he was not as solid in his own end with the defensive pace Omaha threw at us, and he wasn't quite as good as he nor­mally is on faceoffs either." 
Maday added a goal to make the score 3-1, but the Mavericks storrnnd right back. Just over a minute aftnr Maday's goal, Matt Ambroz swatted a n~bound past Irish netminder Jordan Pearce to cut the lead i!1 half at 16:38 of the second stanza. Then, 8:10 into the third period, Nick Fan to tied the game up for Nebraska-Omaha, redirecting a shot past Pearce for the only goal of the period. · 
The game seemed like a car­bon copy of the Feb. 13 game against Northern Michigan, when Notre Dame took a 4-2 lead before the Wildcats tied the game. Jackson said he was concerned with his team's developing habit of letting opponents back into games. 
"We're allowing teams to get back into games because of the way we're playing with the puck, in my estimation," he 
where nothing 
was going in." 

The Irish needed every one of Pearce's saves, as the game went through two periods deadlocked at zero. Junior Dan Kissel provided the offense for the game 6:31 into the final period. Skating down the left side of the ice, Kissel took a feed from Erik Condra and pushed the puck into the net for the game-winner. 
With three minutes left, the Mavericks appeared to have tied the score, but a penalty called on John Kemp negated the goal and maintained the Irish lead. 
Jackson said the experience in elose games would be invaluable to his team come playoff time. 
"We've played in a lot of games like that this year," he said. "We've played in quite a few one-goal games this year and our kids have handled it pretty well. All these games are important for getting ready for the playoffs." 
After next weekend's home­and-home series against Michigan State, the Irish have a first-round bye before host­ing a second-round C:CHA play­off series. Jackson said that, for now, his team is focusing only on that series. 
"We have to worry about get­ting to the finals lirst," he said. "Our objective right now is to get to Detroit I for the CCHA Championship], nothing more."

Although Notre Dame took a lead into the fmal day of competition, the Irish suspect­ed that their third title in four years would ~orne down to the

"We told the

"It wasn't easy coming into this team in August with no familiarity with the program, but the team really embraced me," Barnes said. "I am so lucky that I have a motivated group who believes in what I believe in, and we are going to continue to learn and grow."

Women win Big East record 13th straight 
By NATHANIEL LEE Sports Writer 
There was no stopping Notre Dame this weekend. as the Irish set 11 school records on their way to extending the longest Big East Conference Championship winning streak for any sport with their 13th straight crown. 
The squad controlled the meet from start to finish, wrap­ping up with a total of 828 points, a runaway victory over second place Louisville, who finished with 581. 
·~we really had a good per­formance, and it came from everybody," Irish coach Brian Barnes said. "A lot of girls stepped up across the board, and our depth and team com­mitment was the deciding fac­tor. That's what championship teams do."

Relay team seals win in final race ofthe day 
By MIKE GOTIMER Sports Writer 
Notre Dame's run to a second consecutive Big East title came on the heels of one of the most dramatic finishes in the pro­gram's history. 
In a meet that came down to the final race, the third-seeded 400-yard freestyle ·relay team entered the race as a seven sec­ond underdog to top-seeded Louisville. However, the Irish squad of junior John Lytle, sen­ior Danny Lutkus, sophomore :Joshua Nosal and junior Andrew Hoffman were undeterred by the ehallenge, as Lytle took the lead in the first leg and the Irish never looked back. The win gave the Irish a 9.5-point lead and the Big East title.

Fadng the closest thing to a must-win game this season, Notrn Dame found an identity that has seemed to elude them for mueh of the season.

On the first possession, Notre Dame passed the ball around until Ayers knocked down a three. One minute later, McAlarney pulled up for another three in transition. The two weren't done. 
Ayers and McAlarney put on a shooting clinic, scoring 32 of Notre Dame's first 38 points as the Irish hit nine three-point­ers collectively in the first 12 minutes of the game. The Friars, who arc last in the Big East in scoring defense. played a zone defense. This allowed the Irish to get into the type of shooting rhythm that oppo­nents have fiercely guarded against for much of the sea­son. 
The result was 11 Notre Dame three-pointers in the lirst half, allowing the Irish to
