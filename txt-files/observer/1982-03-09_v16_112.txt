Student Body President Don Murday, in yester­day's Student Senate meeting, presented plans for his five-day trip over break to several universities comparable to Notre Dame. Mur­day intends to make comparisons with Notre Dame's quality ofstu­dent life by examining dorms, cafeterias, student centers, and various student facilities on other campuses. The study is part of a survey Murday is making for the Board of Trustees. The key ob­jective of this study is to convince the Board of the need and desire for more student social space. Murday noted that the normal univer­sity of 6000 has a student center with floor space of 91,000 square feet. The LaFortune Student Center has 37,000 square feet. -The Observer 
The Supreme Court said yesterday it will decide whether police can demand identification ifthey think you're suspi­cious -and whether it can be a crime not to comply. The court will judge such a California law, struck down as unconstitutional by a federal appeals court. The scope ofpolice authority and extent ofan individual's rights in such confrontations remain hazy at best. In 
1979, the Supreme Court ruled that you cannot be required to tell your name ifthe police officer who asks does not reasonably suspect you of any wrongdoing. But the justices lefr'.unanswered whether such, identification could be made mandatory if the officer had reason to suspect some wrongdoing. The court's decision in the California case is expected sometime next year. -AP 
Jamet HajekofTexascan tell friends that the van he purchased was a lemon but he can't advertise the fact that he has soured on the dealership where he bought the vehicle, a state dis­trict judge has ruled. "It's one thing to say those things to your friends and people who will listen, but it's another to advertise," State District Judge Harry Lewis said Friday. Lewis told Hajek to remove the slogans and painted lemons from the 1981 van he purchased from Bill Mowbray Motors Inc. "Help. Bill Mowbray Motors Inc. sold this lemon," read one sign. "Jerry Roberts sold this Dodge disaster at Bill Mowbray Motors. Help. It's a Dodge," read the other. Mowbray went to court over the slogans and got a temporary restraining order to force Hajek to repaint the van. Hajek said the ruling infringed on constitutional rights. "I feelthat it is going against my right to free speech. I don't feel there was anything derogatory in what I said," he said. -AP 
Wlld Horses horses roped on the ranges of Oregon a,nd burros captured in the deserts ofCalifornia are being trucked to the Southeastern cowboy capital of Arcadia, Florida next month to be put up for adoption. Some 250 of these orphans of the wild will be hauled cross country as part of a federal program designed to thin the herds that crowd the wide open spaces. Double-decker semi­trailer trucks will carry the beasts of burden and the mustang hybreds. They'll be brought to the old rodeo grounds in this tiny central Florida community of6,000 where cattle outnumber people. During two weekends in April, the federal Bureau Of Land Manage­ment will turn the animals over to people who applied in advance to adopt a burro for $145 or a horse for 5350. "We have to find homes for them," Steve Altman ofthe bureau's Washington D.C. office, said recently. "Sometimes you have to take them to where the people are so they can be adopted." -AP 
The government yesterday approved the first drug pump that can be implanted inside the body, saying the device can add more than two years to the life expectancy of liver cancer patients and prevent blood clots in victims of phlebitis and other ailments. The Food and Drug Administration said it also is studying the drug pump as a way to dispense drugs to treat brain tumors or insulin for diabetics. The pump holds promise as an improved treat­ment method for the 9,400 people who might otherwise die ofliver cancer each year, the 745,000 who suffer from phlebitis and the 50,000 whose deaths are linked with pulmonary embolisms, FDA commissioner Arthur Hull Hayes Jr. said. The drug pump can be inserted in the chest or stomach and is the first one which need not be worn outside the body. It resembles a hockey puck in size and shape and provides continuous drug therapy. -AP

Ugly-BuildingOnCampus 
Although snow still covers the ground in South Bend, there are some early cases of that springtime affliction known as (Ugly Man On Campus) fever, and invariably there are the annual mutations of the acronym. Last year, I noticed the season's best devaition so far-a sign attached high atop the statue of Fr. Sorin that read "USOC" (Ugly Statue on Campus). I have a mutation of my own which doesn't match the ingenuity ofthe Sorin example, but nevertheless, it is one that is relevant to the Notre Dame campus. 
UBOC -that's right, The UglyBuilding On Campus. There have always been some isolated grumblings about the state ofarchitecture at Notre Dame, but new structures rising on campus this year have caused that grumbling to rise a notch. • 
Last spring, Scholastic dedicated the theme of an entire issue to architecture at Notre Dame. One article took a very discriminating look at several structures on campus, including the Memorial Library, and the new Pasquerilla dormitories. The article was written by an architecture major and included many interesting ob­servations about the apparent direction -or lack of it -in the work ofEllerbe and Ellerbe, the architects who have designed most of the recently constructed build­ings on campus. 
I'm no architecture major, the beholder, however, and 
but I do know what a grace­ful -or an unsightly ­structure looks like when I see one. Notre Dame on the whole presents a pleasing and at some times surprising potpouri of architectural styles to the wandering eye, but the campus does have its share of candidates for UBOC. The one serious no­tion to come out of this column, however, is the rather alarming number of new, supposedly enlightenedly-designed 
buildings that have been the subject ofcontroversy. 
Here's my top seven can-·' didates for UBOC: 
1)The Old Chemical Engineering Building -as ugly and decrepit looking on the inside as it appears to be on the outside. The building was slated to be faced with the same limestone as the architecture Building, but budget 
cuts  back  in  1917  made  the  difference  between  
mediocrity and disaster.  
2) The Aerospace Engineerin g Building  - "Neo­ 
shed revivalism" at its best.  

3) (and rising with a bullet) The Stepan Chemical Building -that massive multi-million dollar wedge at the rear of Nieuwland Science Hall The rows of tiny windows on such a tall structure conjure up images of portholeson a World War II Liberty Ship. Described in a letter to the editor as "another monster from the labs of Ellerbe and Ellerbe." 
4) ROTC Building -Standard military style -but why paint it pink? 
5) Computer Center and Math Building -isn't it cute the way the whole building looks like one big com­puter keypunch card?

6) The Old Band Building -this is simply one of those buildings which started out ugly, and will only mature in its lack of beauty over the years until it becomes a historical site. 
7) The LaFortune Student Center -a buiding which originally served as science hall for the campus. Many experiments have been conducted over the years in this structure, including Albert Zahm's fabled glider flights around the ballroom and the current experiment in that same room, Chataqua. The building itself, however, looks more like an experiment that failed. 
Although these are the top s~ven selections, there are a slew ofothers I have heard students nominate, includ­ing the Old Fieldhouse as well as the new Pasquerilla dorms and the Memorial Library. Beauty is in the eye of 
the elusive idea of graceful­ness is no doubt present in at least most of the aforemen­tioned list.· '­
My point, nevertheless, is this: A careful balance be­tween grace and utility can ·be acheived without disrupting the historical or aesthetic vaiues of the8 campus. Simply witness the Fitzpatrick Engineering ad­. llllll mdition or the Snite Museum of Art. Neither wins an award for outstanding design, but Snite's progressive design meshes well with its O'shaughnessy attachment and the Fitzpatrick structure makes 
an attractive partner for its older engineering building counterpart. 
An institution of higher learning of Notre Dame's caliber deserves not only high quality, but imaginative and progressive architecture in its campus structures. What has been started and finished in a less than idealis­tic manner can still be helped by a little piece ofadvice Frank lloyd Wright once offered about O'Shaughnessy Hall: "plant lots ofivy and hope for rain," but to procede on a haphazard course of construction that gives us bland structures like the Computer Center, is certainly less than what Notre Dame deserves.

tem, called barter syndication, the 
agency recoups its investment when 
it sells that air time to clients 
through the spot saks dcpartment, 
whose S30 I million sales last year 
made it the industry leader. 
At JWT, the bank of commercial 
air time acquired by these syndica­

was growing. Phony revenue figures

'Defects or disorders' 
Profoffers genetic counseling 
By ROGER WILKE 
News Staff 
Dr. Harvey A. Bender, professor of biology at Notre Dame, is currently the director of the Genetics Counseling .Center at Memorial Hospital in South Bend. This clinic which serves North Central Indiana, is intended to provide "individuals and families with information about actual or potential inherited defects 
or disorders." 
At present, there are ap· proximately 3000 genetic disorders which have been identified. Some are rare, others, like Down Syndrome, are fairly common. These disorders may cause physical or mental impairment in the individual and may be mild or severe. 
The South Bend area had no Genetics Counseling Center until the current one was established in January, 1980. The clinic was es­tablished with some primary ob­jectives in mind. 
First, the clinic would provide the family or individual with the neces­sary medical facts about the genetic disorder. The staff uses family medi­cal history iformation and diagnostic test results to evaluate the actual or potential disorders. 
Second, the clinic helps the in­dividual or family understand the nature ofthe disorder and help to in­form them with the options for 
dealing with the risk of recurrence. 
Dr. Bender explained, "There are three aspects to our counseling cen­ter. There's the diagnostic com­ponent, where we try to find out what disorders a child has or what the chances are for the parents to conceive a child with a disorder. Then there is the educative element. This is where we try to explain to the family why the disorders oc­curred and what might be done to manage the situation. Finally, we relate to the potential parents their chances ofconceiving a child with a disorder and give them an objective view of their options. In this way, they are informed of their situation, but can still make an informed deci­sion as to what to do." 
Dr. Bender also stated that there are certain situations in which genetic counceling is particularly recommended. A family with a child with a birth defect of unknown or genetic origin is one example. 
Others recommended to seek counseling arc couples identified, through tests, as carriers of a disor­der, women over 35 years of age considering pregnancy, or families with relatives with a known genetic disorder. ertain ethnic groups are especially susceptible to particular disorders. 
Dr. Bender acknowledges that there is still much to learn in the field of genetics, but says that

research, such as that done in Notre Dame's Human Genetics Program, and clinics, such as the one at Memorial Hospital are improving our understanding of genetic disor­ders. As Dr. Bender says, "You must understand what is wrong before you can correct it." 
The clinic emphasizes its availability--no one is denied needed services for financial reasons. The clinic tries to provide the family with an objective view of its situa­tion and allows them to make an in­formed decision. "We try not to influence the family's decisions," says Dr. Bender, "It's best to let them see all aspects ofthe situation." 



GM, Toyota discuss joint venture 
General Motors Corp. and Toyota ofjapan are considering a joint effon to build small cars in the United States, company officials said yester­day. 
The idea ofa cooperative produc­tion venture was raised at a March 1 meeting in New York between GM chairman Roger B. Smith and Toyota President Eiji Toyoda, statements released by both companies said. 
Japan's leading business newspaper, Nihon Keizai, said plans under consideration call for a joint­venture company in the United States to produce about 500,000 Toyota cars a year at idle GM plants. 


RCA reports videodisc 
NEW YORK (AP)-RCA Corp. said in its 1981 annual repon to stock­holders Monday that it lost $106.8 million last year on its SelectaVision videodisc system. 

The company said it lost S55.5 million on the system in 1980 and S21.4 million in 1979, for a three­year total of S18.3. 7 million. 
In its rcpon, RCA said the in­creased losses in 1980 and 1981 reflected costs for preparation and introduction of the system which became availabk last March, but whose sales fell far short of RCA's original forecast. 
RCA had expected to sell 200,000 
units at the retail level in 1981, but 
sold only about 65,000, even after a 
substantial advertising campaign 
during the holiday season. 
In an further effort to boost sales, 
RCA last month cut the price of its 
1982 players to S349.95 from 
S499.95. 

The SelcctaVision system icludcs a grooved disc that slips into a player. It then is "read" by a diamond stylus similar to a phonograph needle, which transmits images to a television screen. 
RCA, which owns the NBC televi­sion network, earlier had reported net income for 1981 of S54 million on sales of S8 billion compared with 1980 earnings of 5315.3 million on sales of S8 billion. 
In the report to shareholders, RCA chairman Thornton Bradshaw at­tributed the lower profit to "abnormally high interest rates, continuing inflation and a weak economy."

Mike Mitchell collected four awards, as did John Paxson, as the Notre Dame basketball team held its annual season-ending banquet at the ACC last night. 
Acrowd ofroughly 750 people at­tended the event, and were thanked by almost every player for their sup­port, not just at the dinner, but throughout a tough season.

"These men held their heads high, though they sufferred through a less­than-mediocre season," said Rev. Ed­mund joyce in his keynote address. "They exemplify the true spirit of Notre Dame." 
Paxson was named the team's most valuable player, along with receiving awards for the top student-athlete, consistent shooting, assists, and clutch player. 
"When I was being recruited by Notre Dame, I listed the things I wanted out ofcollege," Paxson said. "Academics was at the top of that list. I could.not have made a better choice than Notre Dame." 
It was a night with many high­lights. Digger Phelps's children, Karen, Rick and jen, presented an award on behalf of the entire Notre Dame family, to Keith Penrod, "Notre Dame's No. 1 fan." 
"When you get down," Penrod told the crowd, which had just greeted him with a standing ovation, "look back on this season -and these young men, who showed what Notre Dame is all about." 
Phelps called Penrod "an inspira­
tion to us all." And each player in 
turn thanked him for his undying 
support. 

The Tip-off Club, a booster or­
ganization, presented Fr. joyce with 
two checks for $1,000 each. One 
was in the name of the late Ed Smot­
hers, a long-time Notre Dame fan. 
The other was in the name ofGilbert 
Salinas, Sr., the father of the former 
Irish basketball player, who was 
killed in an automobile accident 
following last year's graduation 
ceremonies here. Both checks were 
earmarked for the University's Ath­
letic Endowment Fund. 
Mitchell spoke with a great deal of 
emotion about his four years here in 
accepting the Most Courageous 
Player Award which Tim Andree, 
who made the presentation, labelled 
"probably the most important we 
give." 

"Thank you, Notre Dame," the 
Irish captain said. "For four years 1 
gave you everything -and you gave 
me back a lifetime."

The heavyweight fight between a pair of seniors, Tom Mazzone and Rick Renzi, was equally as exciting and one that drew a large response from the crowd and, an even louder response when Mazzone was named the winner in a split decision. Mazzone will face defending champ Mike Walsh. 
Renzi had pounded Mazzone pret­ty well, but the fight is scored on to­tal punches where one bell-ringer doesn't count any more than two solid jabs. Nevertheless, the deci­sion could have gone the other way just as easily and many in the crowd thought so. ·

Other winners were freshman Pat Serge over senior Jim Tyrell on a split decision in the 140-pound weight class, while junior Brad Boet­tcher did likewise to junior jim Smith in the !55-pound class. Senior Mark Leising stopped freshman Marty Masias on a unanimous deci­sion in the 160-pound class.
