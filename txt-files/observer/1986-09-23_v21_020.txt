Decision against calling rapists 'mentally ill' a responsible one 
The very idea of some acts produces an im­
mediate and irrepressible feeling of wrongness. 
From our guts, the word WRONG screams out at 
their mention. 
Rape is such an act. It turns stomachs. 
Not everything wrong falls in this category. Murder doesn't. Although unarguably wrong. murder doesn't generate the same feeling. Wit­ness the thousands of people terminated yearly on the silver screen. That's entertainment. One can argue we've got some kind of fascination with it. 
Rape doesn't work well in movies or TV. Even when the TV docudrama about convicted rapist Ted Bundy was aired, he was never actually shown doing it. After roughing up his victims a bit. the scene faded out. But in horror and war movies, there's a contest running for who can deliver the goriest end to a human life. 
There are no rapists on the screen like Rambo, whose number of kills we count off jokingly. Rape is too sick a wrong. 
So it's no surprise that the American Psychia­tric Association recently dropped its proposal to classify rapist behavior as a mental illness in the face of protests by feminists and victims' rights groups. 
Apparently, the psychiatrists who proposed to label rape a "paraphilic coercive disorder" forgot a few things. 
They forgot the thought of a suspected rapist using an insanity plea would drive a good num­ber of Americans insane. They forgot about the millions of turning stomachs. 
The researchers' APA colleagues had better memories. They squelched the classification os­tensibly "because of the preliminary nature of the data," according to the APA's president. But the protesting groups, along with many prosecuting attorneys. claimed public pressure forced the decision. 
Whatever the reason behind the APA's deci­sion, most of us probably feel vaguely relieved. Finally some good news in a newspaper always bringing bad news. 
But good news often hides the brewin~ of big· ger troubles under the surface. 
Although public outcry has prevented rapists from claiming insanity, the courts still accept insanity pleas in murder cases by public man­date. Ifsufficient public outrage were expressed, the courts would alter or halt their use. Courts are not total ivory towers. Unwilling to sacrifice all public respect for the judiciary, judges listen when the public speaks.

.I'm not condemning the lack of such outrage. I'm aiming to illustrate the ambivalence we have toward human behavior research. We're con­fused. 
We believe in personal responsibility for our actions. Taught by our parents, education and religion, responsibility for O!le's actions is as­sumed. Simultaneously, we accept human be­havior sciences such as psychology and social· ogy. Both are respectable courses taught in classrooms across the nation. 
But science is always searching for the causes of phenomena, in this case, the causes of human behavior. Such causes inevitably remove respon­sibility from the individual. People are thus no longer at fault; social or genetic factors compel 
their action. 
Yet we have deep misgivings. How can society work if nobody is to blame for anything? 
Ours is a world based on both science and responsibility. Which will receive our full com­mittment if they become increasingly at odds?

Announcement of new AIDS drug prompts thousands of hotline calls 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON Since dis­closure of the first therapeutic drug to help AIDS sufferers, thousands have called hotlines to get more information, health officials said yesterday. 
Federal authorities announced Friday that an experimental drug found to cut the death rate and 
improve  the  quality  of  life  of  
some  AIDS patients  would  be  
made  more  widely  available.  

They stressed, however, that the drug was not a cure, and that it could have serious side effects. 
The National Institutes of Health said a special telephone hotline established to answer questions about the drug had received more than 3. 500 calls between Friday and yesterday. 
The hotline, which operates between 8 a.m. EDT and mid­night seven days a week. has been receiving an average of 50 calls per hour on 10 incoming lines from doctors and patients interested in being included in further studies of the drug. 
Unlike other purported developments involving treat­ment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, inquiries about azidothymidine, or ATZ, have not been as frantic as in the past say operators of the hot-line. 
A spokesman for the Whitman Walker Clinic here, a clearing­house for AIDS information, said it has been receiving calls about ATZ, but said these inquiries have not been as urgent as in the past. 
"Overaii. peopie have been cairn and not nooding us with inquiries, partly because of the hotline established at NIH before the announcement" said Jason Whiddon, coordinator ofmedical services at the clinic. 

"People are keeping up hope, but they are cautious," Whiddon added. "We're talking about people who are already recon­ciled to the fact that they might die and have had their hopes raised before." 
AIDS, an incurable condition caused by a virus that results in destruction of the body's infection-fighting immune sys­tem, has been reported in 24,859 Americans to date, 
13,689 of whom have died. 
The ATZ patients suffered fewer deaths and, beginning six weeks after starting the drug, also had noticeably fewer bouts with other infections and cancers associated with AIDS, research­ers say. 

35-nation conference adopts security pact 
Associated Press 

STOCKHOLM, Sweden -A 35­nation conference formally adopted yesterday the first East­West security agreement since SALT II, and diplomats said it could be a step toward improved superpower relations. 
The conference did not deal with actual disarmament or nu­clear weapons. Its goal was to reduce the risk of a military surprise attack or conventional war breaking out by misun­derstanding in Europe. 
Delegates toasted the agree­ment with champagne, ending 32 months of prolonged deliberations among the United States, Canada, the Soviet Union and all European countries ex­cept Albania. 
The accord is politically bin­ding and when ratified will come into force Jan. I, 1987. 
Agreement was reached late Sunday when Soviet and U.S. negotiators compromised on ar­rangements for notification, ob­servation and on-site inspection of military maneuvers. 
It was the first East-West secur­ity agreement this decade, the first during Ronald Reagan's presidency, and the first since the still unratified U.S.-Soviet strategic arms limitations accord in 1979. 
The 35 countries are sched­uled to review the results of the Stockholm conference and other offshoots of the 1975 Helsinki Accords at a follow-up meeting in Vienna, starting Nov. 4. 
During the final session yes­terday, the conference clock remained at I0:56p.m., the time it was stopped last Friday, Sept. 
19. Friday midnight was the uriginal deadline for the confer­ence. Delegates had to "freeze" time because issues remained unresolved. 
"We have taken an important step toward reducing the risk of military confrontation," Robert L. Barry, chief U.S. negotiatior at the talks, said in a statement. 
Oleg Grinevsky, Barry's Soviet counterpart also praised the agreement but said much work still had to be done in reducing war risks. 
"We have left hell behind us and are now in purgatory. But we are still far from heaven," Grinevsky said. 
The measures agreed to allow NATO, the Warsaw Pact and neutral countries to closely mon­itor each other's troop move­ments, thus increasing mutual 

confidence  and  lessening  
suspicion  between  the  blocs,  
delegates said.  

The agreement expanded on similar measures included at Helsinki in 1975.

Because of this, he said, the United States is "prepared to consider" more modest reduc­tions as an interim step toward the eventual elimination ofoffen­sive nuclear weapons. 
"So there has been move­ment" Reagan reported. He added that the United States still seeks "total elimination" of intermediate-range missiles in Europe -his so-called zero op­tion. 
"The ice of the negotiating stalemate could break if both sides intensify their efforts in the new rougd of Geneva talks" that opened ~st week. Reagan told the world leaders gathered for the opening of the annual Gen­eral Assembly session. 
Reagan, however, gave no in­dication of significant U.S. con­cessions on his Strategic Defense Initiative, nicknamed "Star Wars." The Soviets claim that building such a space-based shield against nuclear missiles only forces them to build more offensive weapons to make sure they could penetrate U.S .

South African miners protest 'white' services 
Associated Press 
EVANDER, South Africa -About 
200 black miners, shouting 
union slogans and tribal chants, 
disrupted a company-sponsored 
memorial service yesterday for 
177 men killed in a mine fire last 
week. 
"We're not going to pray with 
whites today. We've never been 
allowed to pray with whites. We'll 
have our own rites,':__ miners 
shouted. 
Holding clubs and steel rods 
over their heads, they ran 
through the outdoor service I 0 
times, drowning out sermons by 
white and black preachers. 
Hundreds of other workers who 
came for the service poured out 
of bleachers and chairs to join 
the dissidents. 
After the service, they contin­ued to race around a field near the No. 2 shaft of Kinross gold mine until officials from the Na­tional Union of Mineworkers calmed them down. 
A fire in the shaft last Tuesday 
killed 172 black and 5 white 
miners, and injured 2.35, mostly 
blacks. 
Regional union organizer Tshidiso Mothupi said the union would hold its own memorial Wednesday at nearby Secunda. 
In Johannesburg, the United Democratic Front, South Africa's main multiracial anti-apartheid alliance, said in a statement it 
joined trade unions in holding

precious lives, lives that have made possible the millions in riches that the mining bosses have today." 
In Pretoria, President P·. W. Botha said foreign government and mining industries were wel­come to send their own repre­sentatives to South African mines to check the safety stand­ards. 
Botha said in a message to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions in Brussels that its demand for an indepen­dent commission of inquiry into the disaster was based on ignor­ance and represented a "cynical and insensitive" attempt to lay blame. 
A government team is inves­tigating the fire. South African mining companies contend that their safety standards are among the highest in the world, given the inherent dangers in this country's deep mines, and that safety figures show steadv im­
provements. 
About 6, 000 Kinross miners attended the outdoor memorial service Monday. In the front row was Derek Keys, chairman of General Mining Union Corp., and other white managers. 
The miners' signs and slogans reflected racial tension in the mines, where blacks work under white supervision, and accusa­tions that company neglect of safety procedures contributed to the disaster.

WASHINGTON -With time rapidly running out on the 99th Congress, the House plans to tackle the year's three major money matters this week, and a special impeachment panel in the Senate continues the trial of an imprisoned federal judge. 
The House planned action on more than two dozen bills, mostly minor, for yesterday and today. 
But the money starts to roll Wednesday, when the House plans to vote on an election-year budget package designed to shave about $15 billion off the fiscal 1987 deficit without tax in­creases or major cuts in federal spending programs.

The budget plan, similar to 
.one passed by the Senate on Friday, is a hodgepodge of items such as government assets sales, user fees for government services and accounting changes. It would allow Congress to drop the deficit below $154 billion, the threshold at which Gramm-Rudman calls for across-the-board spending cuts. 
On Thursday, the House plans to vote on the tax bill, the largest­ever revamping of the federal in­come tax code. 
House leaders also plan to bring up a $567 billion package to finance government opera­tions for the year beginning Oct. I. 
Congress plans to adjourn Oct.

of the spending package must 
be worked out between the 
House, Senate and the adminis­
tration before lawmakers can 
head for the campaign trail.

2menhijack Soviet jet; ordeal ends with 6 deaths 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW -Two men seized a Soviet airliner at a Ural moun­tains airport in an aborted weekend hijacking in which the two gunmen, two passengers and two policemen were killed, Tass said yesterday. It said the men were drug addicts. 
The official news agency said that before commandeering the Tu-1.34 Aeroflot plane, with 76 passengers aboard early Satur­day, the hUackers shot and killed two police officers during a car chase to the airport. 
The thwarted hijacking oc­curred at the airport in Ufa, cap­ital of Bashkir autonomous republic, about 700 miles east of Moscow. The plane apparently never left the ground before it was stormed and retaken by se­curity agents. 
Security police and uniformed militia undertook "decisive measures" to recapture the plane, Tass said, indicating they stormed the aircraft while it was still on the runway.

Abuse of alcohol runs rampant at hall SYRs 
Lunch is my favorite meal of the day because by one o'clock I'm finished with all my classes and South Dining hall isn't very crowded. I can enjoy a leisurely lunch with my friends contemplating the origins of the universe. That's my idea of a good time. The other day, however, my relax­ing lunch-hour was disturbed by an angry conversation between myself and one of my good friends. I was surprised at his point of view and I became disturbed, and a little angry at him, as I voiced my own opinion. 
Lou Sarabando 
lunch talk 
Alcohol. Notre Dame. Parties. What's it all about? That is what I wanted to know. With an SYR coming up this Friday, the topic of conversation came up. I'm growing increasingly adamant in my at­titude towards alcohol and the Domer mentality. Why do people go to SYR's? To get drunk, sloshed, blitzed, whatever you call it. That's what Chris was telling me. Gee, I thought they went to SYRs to trash my dorm, spill drinks, throw food everywhere, vomit on my bathroom floor and act like class A jerks. Same thing. 
Since my freshman year, I have noticed no change in my observations. I must be real naive because I thought people went to SYRs in order to meet new people, have a good time with friends, listen to good music and dance. If there wasn't any alcohol it would not matter at all. 
I was laughed at. My good friend, Chris, was sitting across from me, laughing be­tween bites ofhamburger. All ofa sudden it dawned on me that I am as naive as they come. Or am I? 
Why is it necessary for students to use every opportunity possible to get drunk? Am I missing something? When I return to classes on a Monday morning, I invar-

P.O.BoxQ 
Dating is made easier if one learns to relax 
Dear Editor: 
Yes, this is another letter concerning dating (or the absence of) at Notre Dame. I am writing in reply to Michelle Coleman's article last Tuesday (Sept. 16). Michelle's article offers what appears to be sound insights into the social life at Notre Dame She began by attempting to erase many of the groundless myths of dating sur­rounding the college. Unfortunately, I spent (survived) a year rooming with two guys who were manically depressed by the effect of these "illusions." I would be in danger of severe bodily harm if I released their names, but to dispel any doubts...they are not social rejects; in fact they both have been told they could be models (at least that's what they say.) 
Now, Michelle encouraged guys to take chances, go to the mall (risque!), a campus movie, a play, bowling, or din­ner. My roommates had run through this list twice in the first month. Yeah sure, some girls would go out but the vast iably hear some of my classmates brag­ging about how many parties they atten­ded over the weekend and how many cases of beer they drank. On Fridays the chatter turns to happy hours beginning in the early afternoon and barhopping later in the evening. I'm not impressed. Recently, I heard two female classmates discussing their various states of int.oxica­tion over the past weekend. I was dis­gusted. Don't call me sexist it was just that I never expected to hear women, I mean girls, talk like that Call me naive. 
Can't you have a good time with friends without alcohol? Wouldn't you have as good a time enjoying the company of your friends with a can of Coke in your hand? (Chris laughs harder now.) 
If you need alcohol to enjoy your weekend, you, my friend, are at the wrong type of insititution. I wonder. do these weekend parties continue after college or do you suddenly become a mature adult 
because you have a diploma in your hand? 
I don't know what more to say about alcohol. I still don't understand why people drink every weekend to get drunk. It makes no sense. Is it that enjoyable to throw up uncontrollably after hours of drinki11g alcohol? 
I'm not looking forward to Friday eve­ning. I would have liked to attend the SYR but I would feel uncomfortable walking my date through the trashed hallways of Fisher while avoiding the disgusting be­havior of drunk boys and girls at every corner. And if I don't attend the SYR. it is "recommended" that I leave the dor­mitory while the party is in progress. Why should I leave my home for six hours against my will? I don't like the idea of my home being turned into a bar for six hours. The whole concept is rather strange, if you think about it. But most of us don't do we? 
Nor does the administration. Gosh, let's 
spend a lot oftime outlining a new alcohol 
policy in order to prevent abuses of alco­hoi on campus. Then, why don't we turn around and "break" the rules by allowing two "all hall semi-formal parties" per se­mester? While "it is the conviction of the University that drunkenness and public intoxication are unacceptable" (1984 AI-coho! Policy), 1 cannot understand why, therefore, the University condones drunkenness and public intoxication by allowing all hall parties (SYRs)! Maybe this paradox only makes sense if one is in­
toxicated, but it makes no sense to me at the moment. 
When the undergrad club opens up on campus, 1asked Chris, do you think SYRs will still be as popular? Ofcourse, without booze, "Theodore's" won't last more than a month, he replies. I don't believe this i-5 true. 1 think it is a great idea to have a nightclub available for those of us who are under 2 I, and that it will be popular because there won't be drunk boys and girls to reckon with. 
I hope you all have a good time at SYRs this year, and I hope the Domer mentality towards alcohol isn't as widespread as 1 think it is. As you are picking up that first beer or mixed drink on Friday night, or any night ask yourself why you are about to drink it. Wouldn't you truly enjoy your­self more if you drank a club soda in­stead? Maybe not but at least give it a try this first time around, and see how the other half lives. Let me know how it went, give me a call and we'll do lunch sometime.

majority did not. Depression began to set in; the veracity of these "myths" was less in doubt. Contrary to her viewof rejection, it is a pride-numbing, painful experience. Not many normal guys can take more than a few hundred curt "No, I'm busy." replies without feeling the effects. 
By the end of the year one roommate was to the point of transferring schools for the sole reason of his dating problems (he might deny this, but. ..) The other, well, suffice to say he's still feeling the effects of that year. 
Tragically, her myths are all too real. Women, because of the ratio, do have more men to choose from, and therefore are inclined to be reserved. It's a fact. She says it's untrue that every girl is flocked by a group of guys; I don't know about the rest of the male population, but the times I've been to a party where every girl is not surrounded (suffocated) by guys is less than the times we won last year. My roomies took many chances and asked out a lot of girls but ended up worse than they started. 
So, what is the solution? You're asking me how I've survived the rampant pes­simism surrounding me? Celibacy... just kidding. There are no simple solu­
tions; her advice, though reasonable, has been already taken and it doesn't work. Dating will remain a problem regardless of the brilliancy or originality of my ad­vice. I learned a long time ago to relax. just relax. Relationships and dating are somewhat important to me, but by not staking my life on the abscence or pres­cence of a girlfriend, I am much happier. I do not expect or yearn for a girlfriend every waking moment so I don't have a current interest I'm not unhappy. If I do find someone who interests me, I am that much happier because it was unexpected. If one eternally pines for a girL the majority of one's time is spent in this unsatisfied state. As this progresses into 
desperation the chance of finding a date geometrically decreases. 
So, maybe my attitude is tough to em­ulate. Another word of advice is just to be a genial, friendly person and try to make some good friends of the opposite sex. Not only are these relationships just as rewarding, but many times a great dating relationship is built upon one of these simple friendships.

Voluntary testing is the answer to drug crisis 
Dear Editor: 
Drug testing is not the solution for a problem that has universally reached epidemic proportions. ror employers to impose mandatory drug testing would be a clearcut invasion of privacy and would serve only to circumvent the problem. One cannot hope to cure the drug prob­lem by removing those who would test positive on such tests, or by forcing them into rehabilitation. Voluntary rehabilita­tion would be the effective solution. The inspiration to volunteer for such pro­grams should come through increased emphasis on education about the conse­quences of substance use and abuse. Drug testing should be secondary to the establishment of a policy for universal mandatory education about drugs.

U.S. is violating human rights in Nicaragua 
Over the summer, while you were whiling your while away, I decided to write a few letters to members of Congress. I corresponded with John Hiler, who sits in the U.S. House of Representative for Indiana's 3rd district (which includes South Bend and Notre Dame). I also wrote to Indiana Senator Richard Lugar who is the Chairperson of the U. S. Senate Foreign Relations committee. Since these two honorable men belong to the Repub­lican Party, I thought it might be wise to write to a Democrat too. I picked Edward Kennedy. 
Jurgen Brauer 
guest column 
Let me share some of this correspond· ence with you. The premise was that I indicated to the Republicans that I don't think any money should be given to the "Contra" who seek to overthrow the Nicaraguan government. 
Sen. Lugar replies: "I appreciate you bringing to my attention your concerns about allegations surounding the activi­ties of the Nicaraguan democratic resis­tance." Oops! "Democratic resistance: Sen. Kennedy sees the matterjust a little differently: "I do not believe," he writes, "that support for the contras contributes to the effort to restore democracy to 
Nicaragua. In tact, the record shows that President Reagan's policy has achieved just the opposite. After five years of U.S. military 'pressure,' the people of Nicaragua are further away from democracy than ever before." For Ken­nedy, it appears, the contra are not a "democratic resistance" to the Nicaraguan government. In fact. he con­tinues: "I am, also concerned about the continuing reports of atrocities inflicted by the contras on civilians in Nicaragua. Surely, U.S. aid should not be available to groups who engage in terrorism." Aha! That one is clear enough: "democratic resistance" vs "terrorism" (a Ia Libya?). 
But even so, why doesn't the Nicaraguan government negotiate with the contra? According to John Hiler that is what the Sandinistas should do. He says: "An offer for a cease fire in return for negotiations has been made by con­tras and rejected by the Sandinistas 15 times. The offer remains open today." That one befuddled me: How can one negotiate a cease fire with the contras when the contras are ordered by Wash­ington not to? I think Kennedy has it cor­rect when he puts the blame on Wash­ington: " "Thirteen Latin American nations--includig Nicaragua--have sup­ported the recent efforts of the Contadora Group to reach an end to the crisis. 
The presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Uruguay ... stressed the impor­tance of the U.S. role in the effort. They also stated that it was imperative for the United States to end its support for the contras and that such a step was indis­pensable to achieving peace." While it is true, Mr. Hiler, that the Sandinistas rejected talks with the contras, it is not because they don't want peace but be­cause they want to talk to the right person (who sits in the White House). 
What does the U.S. really want in Nicaragua? Sen. Lugar says: "I firmly believe that our objective in Nicaragua should be to create the circumstances which will make it possible to someday observe a democratic election preceded by the restoration of civil liberties; true freedom of the press to cover the candi­dates, issues and procedures of the elec­tion; and freedom for candidates to travel at will throughout the entire country with­out harassment and intimidation. Prior to that time, a constituent assembly or con­stitutional convention should be elected in similar open circumstances to draft a dem ocratic constitution comparable to those of Costa Rica, Guatemal, El Sal­vador or Honduras." 
Well, if that wasn't specific! But. let's see what to make of this list. Here is what I "firmly believe." First ofall, I believe that the U.S. should not have any objectives regarding Nicaragua! The U.S. govern­ment is to govern the United States, not any other country. If the U.S. government feels threatened by Nicaragua it ought to prepare adequate defense on U.S. soil, not along Honduras" and Costa Rica's borders with Nicaragua as the U.S. is pres­ently doing. 
Second ofaiL I believe that people have the right to elect the kind of government they want to have. The Sandinista gov­ernment held internationally supervised, although not U.S. controlled, elections in November 1984. The Frente Sandinista got 67% of the popular vote versus close to thirty perent for political parties to their right. If the election result did not please the U.S. government so what? After all, the U.S. didn't intervene in Italy and France, whose government had expressly communist minisers in recent years. Nei­ther does the U.S. government intervene in Poland, East Germany and all the other "Soviet Bloc" nations. 
Thirdly, by what arrogance of power does the U.S. government permit itself to openly inflict wounds upon wounds on innocent Nicaraguan civilians? At the time of the Nicaraguan revolution in 1979, the Nicaraguan people had a miserable stan­dard of life. The revolution improved that standard remarkably, expecially in terms of educational and health services as well as in food production. The U.S. govern­ment has since then persued a policy of reducing those improvements back to Somoza-time standards and is increas­ingly successful in achieving its aims. Talk about human right violations in Central America; the U.S. deserves the number one spot!

Capitalists dominate the Democratic system 
"Democracy is the worst form ofgouern­ment. Except for all the others." 
Winston Churchill 
Mr. Churchill's statement is an accurate one, especially in light of our own form ofdemocracy, which I label as a capitalist democracy. The democracy which exists in the United States has the singular im­portant purpose of guaranteeing every­one in this country the right to vote and take part in the political process, which supposedly insures against discrimina­tion or exclusion ofany particular interest group. 
Michael Froning in the minority 
I contend, however, that in our capitalist democracy, these political rights are simply formal and proceduraL not substantive, and that a capitalist democracy is simply a legal way for a minority to oppress a majority. In real terms, this means that the exercise of these piolitical rights and the power of expression are limited by inequal distri­bution ofresources, and in actuality, only people with adequate resources may ex­ercise their political rights. 
Why are resources so influential on the ability to exercise political rights? Be­cause the coordination of the exercise thereof depends directly on monetary availability. A small grocery store owner and the chairman of the board of Exxon have the same right to freedom of ex­pression, but their powers to lend sub­stance to this right are directly related to their resources and thus are unequal. This is because importance and assets guarantee access to politics and increase 
the likelihood of having one's demands 
met. 
To understand this, let us examine our capitalist democracy and learn how this resource constraint Is produced. First of all, ourcapitalist democracy is speclflcally designed to satisfy the interests it promotes, these being short term ma­terial gains. In addition, two main kinds of people exist in our society; capitalists and workers. Capitalists constitute a minority of the population and are defined as those who control the invest­ment which occurs in a capitalist state. Workers are generally defined as every­one else. 
For obvious reasons, the welfare of the workers depends on the capitalists, as they are from whom the workers receive their money. Capitalists, however, tend only to invest as much money in the sys­tem as will maximize their profits and keep the workers content yet subdued enough to not disrupt the capitalists monopoly on money and power. 
In other words, the so-called 
democracy is run by a minority of the 
population (the capitalists) because they 
own the vast majority of the resources 
needed to exercise political rights, while 
the workers, due to their inherent lack of 
resources, have only formal rights. As the 'capitalist democracy is geared toward the :satisfaction of short term material gain, 1the capitalist's task to keep the worker 1perpetually satisfied is easy. 
Well, you say, this is not really true be­cause in our society, everyone is able to earn as much money as they want. and even if they do not have abundant re­sources, vote and partake in the politcal process. But this argumentjust does not bear hard scrutiny when compared with the facts.

One: 78. I% of the households In the

3.7% of the households earn above $75,000 per year. 
Two: the bottom 20% of the wage earn­ers in the U.S. gross 5% of the GNP while the top 20% gross 41.9% of the GNP. 
Three: 0.5% of the population owns 50% of all corporate stock while 85% of the population owns no corporate stock at all. 
Four: in 1980, the 53.2% voter turnout was the third lowest in history, and, in what was dubbed a landslide victory, Ronald Reagan won a smaller percentage of the eligle electorate than did Wendell Willkie in his 1940 loss to Franklin D. Roosevelt. 
Five: the working class votes 30% less than the middle class. 
Six: blacks vote 20% less than whites. 
Seven: 27 of the 33 winners in the 1982 
senate races outspent their opponent and five of the six winners who won with less than four percent of the vote outspent their opponents by at least twice as much. 
It is fairly evident from these statistics that to be successful in, let alone be active in, . politics, or have any sort of viable power in this country, one must have con­siderable resources, and, therefor, be in the minroity. The difficulties in mounting a campaign which has few financial re­sources available to it, or even exerting any kind of influence (or using one's freedom of expression ifyou will) without financial resourd!s, in our society, are virtually insurmountable. 
But. you argue, a minority can not oppress a majority in our country because we have a built in safety device: the majority rules concept. and anyone with a majority can win. However, there are two major problems with this. 
The first is that, as we see from our statistics, and as I have justdemonstrated above, It Is generally people with money or who have the backing of money who run In and win elections, In other terms they are the capitalists. or, the minority. The second Is that the loser, no matter what. Is not represented at all. 
These two flaws in our electoral 
process, the requirement of resources to 
have success and the winner take all con­
cept clearly leave our capitalist 
democracy in a state of gross under­
representation where the minority has the 
opportunity to oppress the majority. 
But what is to be done? What system is more effective? There Is no better sys­tem that we know of, as Winston Churchill so aptly said. What we must do Is render the current system more viable and more equal, and the change required is not a disruptive or radical one. 
The first thing we must do is remove all materially based disabilities concern­ing freedom of expression, and allow everyone the chance to lend equal sub­stance to their views. Secondly, we must adopt a proportional representation sys­tem as opposed to a winner take all sys­tem in which losers would still be represented and other parties would have the chance to be formed (and represented) instead of the strict two party system presiding now. 
These two simple changes will meet resistance, namely from the people in power who are afraid they will lose what they have. Yet this resistance must be overcome and the changes must be enacted to rid us of our highly dis­criminatory system.

Blessed are the slay 
Father Robert Griffin 
Letters to a lonely God 

sweetheart. The effect ofshyness is a short-circuiting of the elec­trical system that runs from the brain to the tongue, hands, feet and every nerve end ·in fhe body. One feels tense from head to toe, and the blood rushes in direc­tions in which it was never in­tended by nature to go. 
The person of genius, affected 
by shyness, sounds and acts like 
a klutz. The dancer, when shy­
ness hits him, feels his leg 
muscles turn into cooked spag­
hetti and his feet become as un­
managable as though they had 
been replaced with shovels 
weighted down with coal. The 
shy person's voice can't be 
trusted with the now of words. 
Shyness, if it's bad enough, 
makes the victim want to die, to 
get off stage; but life is not merci­
ful enough to let him go with dig­
nity. He is stuck for an eternity, 
it seems, in the rehearsal of a 
fate worse than death, as he 
shadow-boxes with the demon of 
self doubt sent to punish the shy 
of heart. 
Shyness is not a chip you wear 
on you shoulder as you poor­
mouth your way through a party. 
At a recent wedding reception in 
the east. I sat between an actress 
aspiring to be the wittiest woman 
in New York, and the most nega­
tive man in Montauk, Long Is­
land. His wife, pretty and petite, 
was a society photographer. I 
asked him: "Are you a photog­
rapher too?" He groaned, swore, 
and muttered under his breath, 
"Here we go with twenty ques­
tions," before finally answering 
as though his job were nothing. 
"I cut fish on the Montauk dock." 
I said: "I had great uncles who were fishermen living on the coast of Maine. This summer, in London, I used to hang around fish markets, because the smells reminded me of growing up in Maine." When I asked how he felt about catching tuna -the old fis­hermen used to throw it back as horse mackerel -turned his back as though I were boring him. 
The waiter brought me a Man­hattan. Receiving it gratefully, I quoted one of Toots Shor's old quips: "I feel sorry for people who don't drink. They know when they wake up in the morning. that's the best they're going to feel all day." 
The sunshineboy wasn't amused. "According to my wife, I'm a certified lush. I've been off the sauce for three and a half months. I feel rotten every mor­ning. and tomorrow, I'll be sick as a dog from all the booze I rlidn't touch today." 
I felt bad for drinking in front of him. How was I to know he was nursing a ginger ale? 
The wedding guests clinked their glasses with the silverware. The bride and groom kissed. The actress wanting to be Tallulah Bankhead shouted: "Foreplay, right here in front of us. I'm so jealous, I think it's disgusting." As you can see, she has a way to go to become immortal for her wit. 
"What's she talking about?" the boy of summer in his ruin wanted to know, as though he didn't understand her explicit­ness. "We're half way through September," I said. "She means the season for playing is over." 
"Yankee tourists, go home," 
he urged. "Yankee tourists are 
like the G.l.s in Europe: overpaid, 
over-sexed, and over here." Then 
with a sneer in the direction of 
the bride and groom, he said: 
"All any woman wants ofany man 
is to make his whistle Dixie." His 
imagery was earthier than mine, 
and she went him one better. 
They weren't fun to listen to, so 
I left the table. 
Neither one of them needed to 
be liberated: she, as a woman; 
he, as one of the meek who will 
inherit the earth. Liberating them 
would be like liberating a school 
of barricudas. We'd better watch 
out who we are liberating. before 
we add a new horror to American 
life. 
Shy students don't need a 
movement to help them. They 
need a human context with space 
in it like a harbor where they can 
be taken in and hugged. Scrip­
ture uses many mataphors to 
describe places of peace and 
rest: the sheepfold, the Father's 
house, God's holy mountain, the 
celestial City, the Everlasting 
Arms. When you break them 
down in the here and now, they 
mean people helping people. 
Christ left all of us, like Blanche 
Dubois, dependent on the kind­
ness of strangers. 
"And how am I to face the 
odds-Of man's bedevilment and 
God's?!I. a stranger and afraid1n 
a world I never made." 
The Little Prince, wishing to 
tame the fox, began by sitting 
very still until the fox got used 
to his company. As the days 
passed, the fox drew nearer and 
nearer. But of course you must 
read Saint-Exupery's story your­
self to see how the rituals for 
domesticating a wild thing are 
applicable to the shy ones, with 
whom we need to be patient until 
they learn to trust us. 
The shy, like the poor, we will 
have always with us. Zachaeus, 
I think. who hid in a tree to watch 
our Lord, must be the patron 
saint of the shy. They always 
have Bashful, the easily embar­
rassed dwarf who served Snow 
White, as their folk hero.

Due to technical difficulties, Letters to a Lonely God has not been appearing every Friday. Starting this week, it will return to regular date publication. 
Notre Dame offers all kind of support groups to the various minorities; but who, these days, speaks up for students suffering from social shyness? In Lake Wobegon, Minnesota, I hear, a group of chronically bashful bac­helors and their dates -tired of feeling like nowers born to blush unseen and waste their sweet­ness on the desert air -have started a shy liberation move­ment. 
There is problably no hope at organizing the shy students of Notre Dame as a liberation group, since those who need it most. the terminally shy, couldn't be coaxed out of their rooms to show up for the meetings. If everyone needing help showed up, they'd fill the stadium, because most of us are shy about something. 
Before anyone begins to exam­ine himself (or herself) for telltale 
signs of shyness, he should be reminded that there are bloc'K­heads in the world who make life traumatic even for the arrogant. Have you ever been treated as though you were one of the in­visible people? Have you ever been introduced to a BMOC who never really sees you or spoken to a doll (with sawdust for a heart) who either ignores you or responds in a voice as lifeless as the taped voice of her answering service? 
You can tell that you are in­visible by the cold, dead eyes, like those of a zombie, that look at you without registering a nickerofinterestorcaring. lfyou feel humiliated, it's not surpris­ing; an insensitive extrovert would feel just as humiliated. Only a blockhead has the terrible manners which blinds him to people. 
None of us is perfect: we tend to be too young or too old, too fat or too thin, too poor, dull and unimportant. Yet even a drunk in the street. pestering you for beer money, is entitled to a little respect. One has to be stupid as a Christian to treat other human beings as though they had no feeling. 
Authentic shyness is the fear of taking pratfalls, physical so­cial or intellectual, while one is on stage or in any other public place or in the company of

Irish split end Milt Jackson prepares to make a move after making a reception in the Michigan State game. Rick Rietbrock takes a look at this talented senior in his story at right.

Irish split end 
Jackson makes transitions 
the transition quite successfully. He has five receptions for 58 yards so far this season. 
Another transition Jackson has made successfully is the switch from young upstart to sage vet­eran. He says he has tried to be a positive influence on the younger players. 
"I like to lead by example as much as possible," he says. "Coach Cordelli has told me that the younger players respect me and really look up to me, so I try to use my experience to help them. 
"I don't like to ramble on and 
tell them what to do, but I do try 
to relate some of my past expe­
riences to give them an idea what 
to expect. 
"''ve been through it," he con­tinues. "I can use my successes and problems to tell them how to handle situations. 
Next year, Jackson will be on new turf once again. The future holds several different possibili­ties for him, including a possible professional career. 
"The pros is another step up the ladder and, naturally I'd like to give it a shot," he says. "But I came here for an education first and football second, so I'm prepared for anything. 
"''m currently interviewing for several Big Eight firms and a number of smaller Industries in case a pro career does not work out." 
While Jackson is quick on the field, he likes to slow down when he is off it. 
"I like to relax by just being with people," he says. "I also swim every morning which is very relaxing." 
Irish fans, on the other hand, have found Jackson's presence on the field very relaxing. 
SMC netters finish third at Dl. tourney

The Saint Mary's ·volleyball team placed third at the Illinois Benedictine College Invitational this weekend, a substantial im­provement over last year's fif­teenth place showing. 
"The invitational was a good experience," said Belles assis­tant coach Sue Medley said. "It gave the team a lot of play in a short amount of time and ex­posed them to a variety of offen­ses." 
The Belles won five conse~­tive matches before losing to St. Xavier College, 15-9, 13· 15, and 13-15, in a semi-final match. 
The best match of the invita­tional was against St. Frances College. The Belles came from behind in two of the three games to win the overall match, 15-I I, 7-15 and 16-14. 
The Belles was the only one to win against the first place team, Illinois Benedictine College, 15­8, 15-9 and 15-I I. 
Medley expressed her enthus­iasm about the outcome of the tournament. 
"Coach Lampert and I were very impressed by the perfor­mance of the team. They play very well together." 
In her first match of the season, senior Julie Schroeder gave an exceptionally strong per­formance. Sophomore Margaret Feldman played consistently well throughout the day's matches also. 
The Belles next game will be against Goshen College on Sept. 25 at 6:00p.m.

Once again Notre Dame fans are getting used to seeing Milt Jackson hauling in passes. The senior split end missed all of last season because of an illness that among other things, caused a big weight loss. 
It has not been easy to talk about his comeback because it seems as if he never left. Receivers Coach Pete Cordelli at­tributes Jackson's quick return to his character. 
"Milt Jackson is a great per­son," he says. "He gives total ef­rort at all times and takes tre­mendous pride in what he does. 
"He's  well-respected  by  his  
teammates  and  he  is  a  real  
leader."  

Those who remember Jackson think of his quickness and out­standing hands. That combina­tion enabled him to be the second-leading Irish receiver in 
1984 with 28 receptions and four touchdowns. 
But this year-long layoff had to hurt Jackson, right? Wrong says Cordelli, and wrong again says Jackson. 
"''m pretty satisfied with my progress this year," he says. "I think I'm actually a little faster and just as strong so I feel very comfortable on the field again. 
When Jackson was suffering from the illness, however, he was not feeling so comfortable. But instead of worrying about the season he was missing. Jackson used the time to explore other areas. 
"I didn't worry about the game itself," he says. "I took time to organize the rest of my life by preparing to enter one of the Big 8 accounting firms." 
While Jackson was away, Notre Dame changed its coaching staff and its outlook, which he says has been his biggest adjustment. 
"Coach Holtz is hard man to 
work for," the soft-spoken senior 
says. "If we don't do something 
right, we'll do it again until we 
have it right.

The ND Water Polo Club wins with style 
To be successful in tourmanent play, a team usually has to follow three important rules. The men's water polo club broke every single one, but the Irish still won two of three matches in the Indiana Water Polo Tournament last weekend at Bloomington. 
Rule One: Always practice as much as possible before entering competition. Actually, the team had been practicing in the water for only four or five days prior to the tournament. 
Rule Two: Always make sure to bring your coach to the tournament. Head Coach Greg Lambert who is also an assistant coach to the Notre Dame men's and women's swim teams, had to stay at Notre Dame to watch swim tryouts while the Irish left for Bloomington. 
Rule Three: Always win the first game ofthe tourn­ament. Notre Dame lost a tough opening game to host school Indiana, 12-11, in overtime Friday. The Irish then bounced back to beat Missouri, 10-8, Sat­urday morning, and Michigan, I 1-7, Saturday after­noon. 
"We have about five returning starters, so when we were in the water everything clicked," said Club Vice President Steve Coffey. "The new players played really well, and we played good defense." 
Goalie Matt Brehm was named the tourmanent's most valuable player, and Steve Gunther and Marty Watts led the Irish in scoring.

After getting shut out by Michigan 26-0 in their season opener September 13, the Irish hijacked the Dayton Flyers, 22-4, last Saturday. Sean Evans scored 12 points on penalty kicks, Phil Sheridan added four points with a try, and Andy Shea played a solid game at second row. 
"We're starting to come together. We looked a lot

better than last week," said Club President Quentin Williams. "Dayton's not a bad team. They had 75 guys out there." For comparison, the Irish have just over 40 players. 
Notre Dame's B side edged Dayton's by a score of 4-3. 
This weekend, the Irish will be seeded first in the Indiana-Kentucky Tournament a tourney that will include seven collegiate teams and seven men's clubs. 
Also looking forward to tournament action is the Rowing Club. The varsity men's team will take two eights and two fours to the Head of the Des Moines in Des Moines, Iowa, while the varsity women's team will bring two eights and one four. 
During the last two years, the men's club has done well enough in Des Moines to earn the Well ness Cup, an award given to the boat that rows the fastest time over the course of any events. 
"Des Moines is a good warmup for us. When we go up to Ontario (October 4), we run into tough competition with Canadian universities and clubs," said Club President Joe Brunetti. 
The women's team, which has enjoyed similar suc­cess at Des Moines, has a familiar face as its new coach. Head Coach Clete Graham is a graduate of Notre Dame, and he coached the Irish to two con­secutive Midwest Rowing championships in the 1970's before leaving temporarily.

After starting the season at 1-3 with a series of 2-I games, the Women's Soccer Club has won two straight games, including a 5-0 rout of the University ofChicago at Stepan Field last Sunday. Jane Titterton scored two goals for the Irish, and goalkeeper Cathy Dominick recorded the shutout. 
With a 3-3 record, Notre Dame already has as many victories as in last year's 3-7 campaign.

Women's football enters new season 
By FRANK HUEMMER 
Sports Writer 
Women's interhall football began this past weekend with a limited slate of action. And just as the fans await the dawn of a new era under Coach Holtz. wo­men's inter-hall football fans eagerly await a new champion. 
Farley Hall has dominated the gridiron for the past five years. but they could be challenged this year by Breen-Phillips and Pasquerilla East. This weekend proved the competition would be ready and would be trying very hard to upend the defending champs. 
Flashes of lightning filled the sky as Farley and P.E. played in a rematch of last year's champi­onship game. The game.

Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's soccer team two away gam~this weekend both ended in de(eat. bringing the team record to 2-5. 
Saturday the Belles took on Quincy College and lost. .3-I. Sunday, Lindenwood Colleg bounced the Belles. 4-0. 
The past Wednesday the Belles lost to Michigan State by a score of 8-1 . 
The team's only goal was scored in the last fifteen minutes of the ga~ by senior captain Mary Anne Perri. 
"The Michigan defense put alot of pressure on us," said Belles coach John Akers. "but we did not give up." 
The last time the Belles expe­rienced a victory was a week ago Friday when they defeated Notre Dame in an exiting overtime vic­tory. 
The first goal was scored by sophomore, Ellen Boyle and the game winning one was made by freshman, Molly Meehan. 
In the lost to Quincy the one goal scored was shot in by Perri during the first half. 
The Belles had the lead throughout the first half, but were unable to stop Quincy in the second half. 
"We could not maintain our lead," said Akers. "after the eigth hour bus trip." 
According to Akers another negative factor was "the large. unfriendly crowd we played for." 
Sunday's game did not offer much relief for the Belles be­cause they had to play on astra turf, a surface which the team had never played upon. 
In addition the temperature on the field was over I00 degrees. 
The Sain~ Mary's team played hard despite all the opposing fac­tors. 
The freshmen players added much to the game especially Celeste Aquino. Nancy Haske, Coleen Keefe,Caroline Knoll, Molly Meehan and Kathy Revane. 
"(Junior goaltender) Patti Hat­field had two good games," said Akers. 
Even though the Belles lost both away games the trip was a good experience for them and will help them in the future. 
Making Saint Mary's bus ride home even longer was a nat tire they had in Joilet.lllinois. 
The team's arrival home was delayed until 6:.30 A.M. Monday morning. 
The Belles play again on Sat­urday at home against Purdue. 
Hopefully the team can "put things together" said Akers during the week. 
stopped with 6:42 remaining due to the ~eather, had P. E. supply­ing all the thunder as they were leading. 14-6. The final 6:42 will be played at a later date. 
Pasquerilla East struck first as its high-powered offense took charge with a .30 yard pass from quarterback Colleen Donnelly to running back Annie Schrenk. With the ball on Farley's five-yard line, Colleen O'Connor raced five-yards for the touchdown and Colleen Donnelly rolled in for the two-point conversion, giving P. E. a quick 8-0 lead. 
A drizzle began at the start of the second half, with P. Eclinging to the 8-0 lead. However, Farley took the opening kickoff from the 45-yard line and punched it in for six. 
The touchdown came on a big

Pasquerilla East came right back with Donnelly and O'Connor hooking up on a .34 yard strike, giving P. E. a 14-6 ad­vantage. Then Mother Nature took over where P. E. left off by putting on a great lightning dis­play that filled the skies and halted the action. 
"I was very happy." said P. E. head coach Jeff Morgan. "I wasn't sure how we would do be­cause we had a lot of first year players. But we are looking for­ward to a great year." 
Farley coach Phil Kalamaros, 
who has directed Farley to three 
championships. and coaches Dave Haimes. Frank Parigi. and 
Steve Auerbach feel that they will bounce back and be heard from in the end. 
In other interhall action, Badin and Walsh both were handed losses because their insurance was not turned in to the NVA of­fice on time. Meanwhile, Breen­Phillips recorded a 14-0 shutout over P.W. 
"Our execution today was bet­ter than in any practice we've had. and defensively we shut them down," said B.P. head coach Dan DeBoer. "We have a definite chance at the champion­ship." 
There will be plenty of exciting women's interhall action in the remainder of the season, espe­cially with the three-way battle for the league crown.
