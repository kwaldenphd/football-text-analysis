Vol. XI No. 90 
Voting held today . . 
SSP candidates finalize platforms 
by Patrick Cole Senior Staff Reporter 

Wrapping up a week of cam­paigning for the highest student government offices, eight of the nine candidates for Student Body President and Vice-President publicly voiced their platforms to about 80 students in the Keenan Hall chapel last evening for the last time. 
A second forum was held in the Grace Hall pit about 20 minutes after the Keenan assembly in . which the candidates reiterated their views. Rich Hohman, who did not appear at the Alumni Hall forum the night before, did not make an appearance at Keenan Hall. 
Each candidate was allotted four minutes to make a statement. This was followed by a brief question and answer period by the audience. 
After each candidate spoke, a final statement lasting from one to two minutes was delivered by each SPB-hopeful. 
Miranda-Clinton. Student Body Vice Presidential Candidate Bob Clinton emphasiZed in his opening remarks that he and Ralph Miranda, his running mate, want ''open government.'' As in the previous forum, Clinton stressed the need for a student government newsletter, a direct phone line to the SBP. 
"We're interested in small, effi­cient government," Clinton said. "We feel we work well with a small body. We only had 25 people working for us, so we don't owe anything to anyone." 
Clinton also promised, if his ticket is elected, to better coordi­nate hall activities to avoid inci­dents such as the North Quad party and the several conflicts in formal dates that were scheduled around the weekend of March 25. 
"We also want a re-evaluation of

Voting for Student Body Presi­dent, Vice-president and St~dent Life Council representatives wtll be conducted today in thl;! halls from 
parietals," Clinton said. "This thing is kicked around each year.'' 
Mooney-Morrison. "Read today's Observer," SBP Candidate Pat Mooney advised the group. ''All the pertinent issues of the candidates are there." 
Nevertheless, Mooney continued to briefly discuss his sole proposal: that a student body vice-president­ial candidate be a freshman or sophomore. "Some people may say that's too restrictive," he said. "But the only restriction is that the junior couldn't run. In re-election, if he's incompetent, the people wouldn't vote for him." 
The main advantage, Mooney said, is that the proposal would provide for one "potential candi­date that had some previous exper­ience." 
In a response to a question from the audience about not knowing the problems until getting into office, Mooney responded, "What we offer is an approach to problems. We don't concrete solutions." 
His running mate, Bruce Mor­rison, stated the ticket is trying to "sell realism." An ~xample he cited contrary to realism was the attempt to involve rectors in the student-life issues which is the opposing view held by SBP candi­date David Bender. 
RusseD-Geppert. SBP-hopeful J. 
P. Russell emphasized to the crowd that his platform is mainly con­cerned with the revitalization of student government, the develop­ment of action-oriented social life and the student

government. He also stated that his campaign was one of "famili­arity" and also listed the need for a weekly newsletter and a career development program in the indi­vidual departments and societies such as the Pre-Law and Pre-Med organizations on campus. 
His running mate, John Geppert, stressed their ability to implement the ideas of their campaign. He noted that Russell had experience in presenting ideas to the Board of Trustees. 
Concerning a question about resolving the problems of social life at Notre Dame, Russell responded, "There's no simple solution to social life. What can we do? There are little improvements we can make such as a student facility or building a pizza facility or re-vital­izing the use of the Half-Way House by Holy Cross Hall or making better use of Stepan Center." 
Then another student asked a question about the Russell-Geppert outlook on the role of the hall president. Russell explained, "There are 22 different hall con­stitutions with 22 different ideas on the role of the hall president. What we propose is to standardize this." 
Talbot-Hughes. John Talbot, the fourth candidate to speak at the forum, expressed a need for a working relationship among stu­dent government leaders. 
Talbot criticized the present judicial boards. "Their problem is that there aren't any respectable people on them," he said. "And people ask can student government really change this." 
"But we hope to build a relation­ship with the workers in the student government," Hughes said. 
Hughes, the vice-presidential candidate, told of some plans to create better activities by the ticket, if elected. He suggested the publication of a booklet, describing the various social functions in the Notre Dame-St. Mary's community and using Stepan Center more by encouraging small bands, for example, to appear. 
Talbot, in response to a question about achieving cooperation in the student government, stated the need to develop "a one-to-one relationship with the people" with whom one works. 
Bender-Soma. David Bender, 
currently president of Sorin Hall, 
opened his statement by saying 
that no candidate has discussed the 
need to restructure the SLC. The 
Bender-Soma platform calls for the 
membership of rectors as well as 
four hall social commissioners. 
Bender also stressed the need for 
Student Union accountability. 
But Bender also explained the 
need for better relations with 
alumni, saying that unless the 
student body has some support, 
"we are only talking to ourselves." 
"Some alumni say that the only 
means of communication is through 
the Notre Dame Magazine," 
Bender said. 
He then talked about the experi­
ence of his running mate, Soma, as 
well as briefly touching on his own 
as Sorin president. "People here here is responsible for the laundry "Look at our wants--adding an proposal that will enable us to do hour to parietals--what does this our own laundry."

Prof. Danehy files suit against the University for attempting to retire him. [Photo by Tony Chifari] 
Mandatory retirement forces Danahy to s·ue 
by Maureen Flynn Campus Editor 
Dr. James P. Danehy, professor of chemistry, filed suit yesterday against the University of Notre Dame, contending that his contract and his civil rights have been violated by a University decision that he must retire at the end of the academic year. 
Danehy, who will be 65 years old on April 27, maintains that his tenured position entitles him to full employment as long as he is able to fulfill his teaching duties. 
He also alleges in his suit that Notre Dame "has no rational requirement standards fairly applied to all faculty members." 
The Faculty Hamlbook states that ''a member of the faculty ordinarily retires and becomes emeritus on the first day of July following his sixty-fifth birthday ... When a member is permitted to continue in active service beyond the date prescribed for retirement, service beyond that date will be on the basis of a year-to-year appoint­ment ... " 
Danehy argues that tenure is "permanence of appointment," as stated in the Facnlty Handbook, and that his contract can only be terminated for cause. 
A letter from University Provost Fr. James T. Burtchaell, dated Nov. 11 and attached to Danehy's suit, deniel> that the professor is being retired on the basis of age. 
Burtchaell's letter states that Danehy's tenure will end this year because· he will have reached the age of 65. The decision will then have to be made whether or not to appoint him for the following year. The question will be whether Danehy is the most qualified person available for the position, the provost's letter states. 
A letter from Chemistry Depart­ment Chairman Jeremiah Free­man, also attached to the suit, states that the University needs "a constant infusion of new, young people" into a science department. 
The decision in no way reflects dissatisfaction with Danehy's con­duct of his responsibilities, Free­man notes. 
Danehy currently teaches or­ganic chemistry and chairs the Faculty Senate. 
"I feel a good case can be made out that I have a right to continue employment, at least for next year," Danehy said yesterday. "I hope this will lead to a break­through judicial decision that will guarantee others that their employ­ment will :tot be terminated arbi­trarily on the basis of any particular age limit." 
University officials could not be reached last night for comment. 
Danehy is asking for a prelimi­nary injunction, to be followed by a permanent injunction, against changing his position as a professor or denying him the rights associ­ated with that rank. 
He has also asked the court to rule on his rights in the case and to r·.'nder an unspecified amount in d.tmages.

Amin reschedules meeting 
WASHINGTON [AP]  President Idi Amin of Uganda has postponed a scheduled meeting with some 240 Americans at Entebbe Airport ­causing the State Department ,to withdraw a plan to send a top diplomat to Kampala. 
According to a broadcast moni· tored here, another date for the session with American missionar­ies, teachers and others in the East African country will be announced later. 
The American diplomat, Talcott Seelye, is currently on a two-week tour of Africa. An experienced troubleshooter who was posted to Beirut dt'llring the civil war in Lebanon he was to have gon to the Uganda capital in response to Amin's message to Washington inviting a U.S. representative to meet with him. 
The Ugandan announcemtn caught the State Department by surprise. During the day, while it prepared plans for the Seelye mission, officials gave assurances that there was "no cause for alarm" about the scheduled meet­ing tomorrow. 
Seeking clarification, Secretary 
of State Cyrus R. Vance said the 
Ugandan charge here, Paul 
Charubet, was being called in for 
consultations. He will confer with 
Philip C. Habib, the undersecre­
tary for political affiars. 
In an earlier broadcast, the 
Ugandan government quoted A min 
as saying President Carter "was 
still new and young in office" and 
not quite familiar with African 
affairs. It said Amin has told a 
Saudi Arabian diplomat that Carter 
should have studied the situation 
carefully and found out "the true 
facts" before making any public 
comments. 
At the same time, Amin was said 
to have told the Saudi charge that 
the Americans in Uganda were 
secure and well and that Amin 
"has no problem at all" with them. 
The Nairobi newspaper Dally 
nation reported that the Americans 
in Uganda were being followed day 
and night by armed plainclothes­
men. 
In the Ugandan broadcast, the 
text of which was received here, 
Amin advised Carter that "all the 
Americans in Uganda were directly 
under his command" and not 
under the American President. 
According to the broadcast, 
Carter has appealed to several 
heads to state in Africa and the 
Arab world, asking them to use 
"their good offices" with Amin 
regarding the Americans. The 
lastes appeal, the broadcast said, 
was made by Prince Fahd of Saudi 
Arabia.

Woodward speaks _on politics 

by Mary Kay Baron 
Kenneth Woodward, Ideas and Religion Editor of Newsweek mag­azine, shared his interest in "The Rising of Evangelicals in America" with a small audience in the library lounge last night. 
Focusing upon evangelicalism and politics, Woodward stated, "We wouldn't be here tonight if it weren't for the candidacy and presidency of Jimmy Carter who brought evangelicalism to the · notice of the overculture. It provided curiosity, some divided 
· hostility and issueda kind ofhigher evangelical chic, at least for a while among the southern New Yor­kers," Woodward stated. 
"Politically, white evangelicals form the backbone of the majority of Protestant voters. In turn, Protestant voters are the most politically and socially conservative group in America. The Jewish are the most liberal, and the Catholics come next,'' he continued. 

Woodward does not feel Carter's election has resulted in an age of evangelicalism as a major political ·force in American politics. "As a Woodward spoke on religion and politics last night. · democrat and as a politician who is [Photo by Kevin Walsh] more liberal than the evangelical 


Library contributions solicited 
by Kevin M. Walsh Staff Reporter 

In· response to Notre Dame's need for more library materials, an appeal for contributions · is cur­rently being made to alumni to enable the library staff to purchase more books and periodicals. 
According to David 1;, Sparks, director of the University Libraries, such appeals ·are standard proce­dure in order to keep the alumni moving andcontributionsso that the· needs of the library can be met. 
Contribution increases have be~ come more important in recent years, for in 1973, a report issued by the Committee on University Priorities stated, ''The library has had difficulty keeping abreast of its academic peers in the past years." In 1974, a study conducted by the North Central Accreditation Asso­ciation reported, ''The Memorial Library ranks near the last in spending among research libraries in volumes held, new volumes added annually, and in total dollars spent for the library." 
Since 1974, the library's endow­ment fund has increased over $412,000 to a total of approximately $1,060,000, but according to some Notre Dame educators, the library is still deficient in some areas. 
Fr. Marvin O'Connell, chairman of the History Department, said, "In general, the· faculty of the history department is satisfied with the. library's collection for under­graduate research." But O'Connell states that, for graduate students and faculty, the research library does not have enough volumes. "There i~ an uneven amount available for graduate study as compared with undergraduate study," he sajd. 
Dr. Robert Gordon, vice-presi­dent of Graduate Studies, expres­sed similar views. "There are problems over there," said Gordon 
when asked about the library. He ment funds restrict the money

Rlcci-Eck. Ken Ricci, presently 
director of the Student Union, told 
the audience that the most impor­
tant quality a candidate can give to 
his job is commitment. 
Mark Eck, Ricci's running mate, 
hinted an improvement in social 
life. "There's a legal loophole in 
the alcohol policy," he announced. 
"But also we think we, by working 
with Bro. Ryan, can get more

help get more teachers. We would 
like to create a book co-op that

The candidates also suggested 
that the judicial boards need to be 
improved with the possibility of 
using law students to advise stu­
dents of their rights. 
"Why should you vote for me?" 
Ricci asked in response to a 
question from the audience. 
"Because we're more committed 
than any other candidate."

When the elections are over, the

"The power lies in the stu­

friends in power.

. Just Another (Loud) Band out of Boston 
by Scott Appleby 
In spite of a banal, overbearing warm-up , group and a tediously loud sound system, Boston manages to woo last night's ACC crowd with an erratic display of the innovative talent that has earned them plaudits as best new group of the year, and boosted their debut album sales to three million copies. 
Uncomfortably enough, a similar bid for recognition by Rick Derringer in the opening set failed miserably. Whatever latent virtuosity Rick might have as a musician remained suspect as he opted for sheer decibel force. Without doubt, he competently proved the old adage that all weak, uninspired rock 'n' roll perform­ances sound exactly the same--loud and boorish. Derringer eyen blew his "big draw": "Rock 'n' Rollflootchie Koo" was interrupted by a tasteful primoridal scream as well as an energetic burst of stylish choreography (Rick and the boys would leap into mid-aid, quiver all over and spin tb~~aggy heads like so many childre.n). 
The high point of the show was the Steely Dan album broadcast over the P.A. system which highlighted intermission. 
Boston was better, but not by much. Although obviously superior to Derringer

" 'Mutual exchange through conversa­tion' is still a principal definition for intercourse, according to the _latest edition of standard dictionaries." That was the comment with which I began a recent class in human relationships for one of our Free University courses. 
Conversation was a rather common meaning for "intercourse" several years ago; but very few think of it that way now. You realize how complete has been the loss of that meaning when you find yourself reacting with amusement to a statement like the following: "The sisters shall not have intercourse with any priest, without the permission of Mother Superior" (from a convent rule-book that, needless to say, has been re-written in recent years). 
In a way, it's too bad we've lost our appreciation for intercourse as conversa­tion, because it could be a clue to understanding intercourse as sexual union. Language can be a key for young persons in their quest for understanding what is truly involved in heterosexual relating. 
For example, gestures always accom­pany relationships. What is the body language saying? Is what it is saying really true? These are the questions. Gestures are meant to reveal what already is fact; they don't cause the reality. The kiss, for instance, a beautiful and powerfully sym­bolic gesture, is meant to communicate something that is already true. Kissing

This marked lack of variety. in song speeds hinders Boston by confining its musical approach to an interesting, but highly repetitive, bag of tricks. For example, Brad Delp, the lead singer and head rah-rah of the group, introduced a new song ("A Man I'll Never­Be") which boasted a strong melody, tight arrangement, and a solo guitar middle which was ·immoderately reminiscent of the corresponding section of "More Than a Feeling."

Intercourse 
expresses it. Thus you can see how unfortunate it is that we Americans have so cheapened the kiss; it is in danger of losing its specialness, as it occurs more and more casually and thoughtlessly. 
What about more neutral gestures, like hand-holding or the embrace? A great deal does depend upon the circumstances. A young man and woman embracing might indicate they are lovers; but it could be the occasion of the death of the girl's father, ,in which case, the young man, through the same sign of embrace, would be communi­eating compassion and sympathy. 
For most people, intercourse, as sexual union, is a gesture communicating a most specific message. For the majority of persons, it says : "I am yours; we are bound to one another; I surrender to you without conditions or time limitations; I love you and wish to proclaim this in all I do; I want this physical union to say what I ~an't say in words." This is the body mguage of marriage; and that's why there ., a. problem with pre-marital intercourse. t can mean a violation of the principle: ;'here must be a consistency between 
gesture and reality. 
The above meaning of coitus is an ideal, of course; and ·not that easy to live up to. The gesture of sexual intercourse can also be distorted, as the kiss, and mis-used to speak a message far less noble than marital surrender. But what a difference between the sexual univn of two unmarried persons 

who arC(. nonetheless! deeply in love and 
planning to be marrieosome day, and, on 
the other hand, the sexual · intercourse 
between two people who hardly know each 
other. In this second instance, the 
beautiful language of love is perverted and 
twisted into shallow travesty; a kind of 
body language B.S. 

Consistency between gesture and reality isn't a challenge for the unmarried only. Because gestures like· intercourse are so powerfully self-satisfying, they demand strong motivations of love. Ironically, what we call "making love" can be very unloving and almost· totally an exercise in self-gratification (a vaginal masturbation), if both persons do not focus their loving attention and conscious tenderness on each other. It just so happens that when self-gratification goes up, so does the possibility of becoming oblivious of the other person involved. For example, every young man I've ever talked with on the subject admits that it is a fact of life that it makes a great deal of difference who the woman is to whom you offer those small, selfless, tender actions of thoughtfulness; but things change significantly when you're referring to intercourse ... it is so explosively self-satisfying, it is liable to make much less differt'n.-: who's involved. Thus the crude, cruel remark you some­times hear: "Sure she'-. ugl·.: just put a

Tom Scholz was a crowd-pleaser With his clever "flying saucer sound"; unfortun­ately, the technological additions to lead guitar were somewhat over-employed during the course of the evening. 
Despite these bothersome difficulties, Boston had its moments of brilliance. The opening number "Rock 'n' Roll Band" was prophetic: "When we got up on stage and got ready to play, The people came alive." Indeed, the audience appreciated the fast-moving piece, replete with feverish rhythin-bass work and characteristically polished harmony. Also successful in this genre were "Smokin"' and "Foreplay­Long Time," both of which brought to mind critical suggestions that Boston draws heavily from the influences of Yes and Led Zeppelin. 
The night's biggest treat, however, came in the third song of the set, Boston's big draw, "More Than a Feeling." Although the live version suffered measurably outside the studio, the im­pressive arrangement of the number and the strength of the song itself survived. An anthem to the restorative, mystical powers · of music, the hit single showcased Delp's range and inflection as lead vocalist. The rousing "Peace of Mind" and the stylish "Something About Her" were also top. contenders for best performance. Both songs displayed Boston's knack for sWift, smooth changes and transition in rhythm. 
Thus, ringing ears and scrambled brains swarmed happily out ofthe ACC last night. The overbearing sound level and feeling of sameness apparently didn't quell crowd enthusiasm for their new rock 'n' roll superstar group. Only one pretty young lady, smartly dressed in a green pantsuit, was overhead to exclaim: "It was good, but why do these groups always play so loudly?"

Phelps: teacher and coach 
by Tom Powanda Sports Writer 
At Notre Dame, teachers are intimately involved in the commun­ication process as they interact with students individually and in groups. They are continually sending mes­sages to students and receiving the messages the students give back to them. Because communication is so central in teaching, to guide interaction effectively, teachers must be masters of the communica­tion process. They must be skilled at manipulating a student to per­form desirably in a variety of situations. 
The role of basketball coach Digger Phelps is. much the same. The ability for him to communicate the objectives which he wishes to teach is pertinent to both . the success of the team as well as himself. Even on the college level, the athlete looks to the coach for more than just. knowledge of the game. 
The phrase ."my coach says" does not necessarily refer to the 
· mechanics of the game but rather to all the lessons an athlete learns from his coach about how to handle feelings and situations. The coach can be a voice-guiding, teaching, offering opinions on the athlete's progress and assessing his value as a person. On the other hand, he can tear down and destroy an athlete emotionally to the point where his will to continue is lost and he quits as both a participant in the sport and in life. 
As does a teacher, the coach, in essence, holds a boy's future in his hands. An athlete's understanding of what the coach says becomes a part of him, blending with and modifying all oilier learning exper­iences he has had and will have for the rest of his life. 

A major role of a coach, in this .:ase Digger Phelps, does not take place on the couri. His job is one of manipulation, to get the people involved in the game to contribute positively to the cause. But how does one sustain an athlete's involvement in an event after he has reached a plateau in his career? 
For some schools this question need not be asked but at Notre Dame Phelps gets more than his share of exceptional athletes who have all experienced one of those inevitable pedormances. 

"It is difficult to face a challenge in sports," exclaims Phelps. "Goals should be set by the athlete for the individual yet the team concept should come first, to make everyone feel like a part of it, to belong. It is a tough task but the purpose is to give everyone an identity. Those are the motivating factors you go on." 
These goals and motivating fac­tors can cause problems. The direction of emotional energy must be in a constructive way. Phelps approaches a contest differently than most. "We really keep a loose atmosphere. We try to relax and don't try to get up tight about it as coaches and players so that we don't bum out before the contest even begins." Just before game time Phelps will call his team together to start to get into what they really have to concentrate on, the mental approach to the game. · Once again Phelps differs from many other coaches. Psychiatrists believe, as does Phelps along with 
other head mentors, that the mental preparedness is 90 percent of an athletic contest while the physical part of the game only consists of 10 percent. Why does Notre Dame then prepare for only about 10 minutes, the mental part of the game consisting of 90 percent yet can spend up to a week preparing for what seems to be a minor portion of the game, that is, the physicalpreparedness? Phelps explams. "The fO percent we are taiking about, the physical aspects of executing offenses and defenses as a unit, as a team, to get that 10 percent it takes more hours than it does for the other 90 percent the mental concept. That is the difference in the correlation of the two. The 'mental part is there, the ideas of winning are woven into a player. The other 10 percent YIJI are talking about requires the most time." 
Of course what' it takes in athletics is an integration of mental and physical functioning. Func­tioning is integrated within a particular competitive situation when both mental and physical processes are working together to accomplish a particular goal. Your feelings and thoughts have to be totally oriented toward, and con­centrating on, aiding. your actual physical pedormance. When an athlete pedorms to this high level of competency the results could be outstanding. For that matter however, most of us manage to integrate our mental and physical processes so infrequently that when we do, it is a peak experience 
a high. Athletics of course is very de­manding. To coach in sports takes 

Irish pucksters downed by Tech 
by Ted Robinson Sports Writer 
HOUGHTON, Ml -Fifty-nine saves is a lot of saves. John Peterson must have been. seeing stars after his pedormance Friday night at the Student Ice Arena in Houghton. 
"It didn't matter much because we didn't win the game," Peterson commented. 
The 59 saves made little .differ­ence to Peterson because Stu Younger managed to break through the Irish defense to score 
a breakaway goal with just 22 seconds left in the game to give Michigan Tech a 3-2 victory over Notre Dame and a split of their series. 
Just seven minutes earlier, it looked as if the Irish were going to sweep the Huskies after an incredi­ble 25-hour trip to Houghton Wednesday and Thursday. The 6-4 Irish victory Thursday night clinch­ed second place in the WCHA, and there was some fear of a Notre Dame letdown Friday night. 
Yet, Dan Byers' first goal of the season three minutes into the final period put the Irish f."ead 2-1. Don Fairholm had carried the puck the length of the ice into the Tech zone. 
Whtle waiting for the other Irish players to establish their positions, Fairholm slid the puck towards Oark Hamilto!l who was cruising through the slot. Hamilton missed the pass, but Byet's took it on the fly, and from the right point drilled a 40-footer past Tech goalie Bruce 

_Horsch. 
lt was th~ rairholm-Hamilton combination which had given Notre Dame the first goal of the game midway through the first period. Fairholm was replacing Paul Clarke, who did not make the trip with a bruised thigh, on the power play, and the combination had clicked for two goals Thursday night. 
With Tech's Gord Salt off the ice for intederence, Hamilton took a pass in the slot from Jack Brown­schidle. Instead of shooting, Hamilton slid the puck through the slot to Fairholm, whose shot was too fast for Horsch to react to. The goal came at 11:32 and was Fairholm's third of the series. 

The Tech power play, which was 

0-8 Thursday night, finally cracked , th~ough to the scoring column two mtnutes later. Dave Joelson was left alone in front of the -net, and banged home a rebound of his own 
shot to tie the game. 
However, the play of the Irish 

penalty killers, spearheaded by 
Ray Johnson, Geoff Collier, Ted 
W eltzin and Allen Karsnia, was 
outstanding all weekend, allowing 
only that goal by Joelson in 14 Tech 
power-play attempts. 
"The play of our specialty teams 

was outstanding and won the game 
for us Thursday night,'' comment­
Irish coach Lefty Smith. "We 
scored two goals with our new 
power-play unit, and our penalty 
killers stopped T'.!ch on eight 
chances." 
After the first p~riod goals by 

Fairholm and Joelson, the teams 
were stymied by goaltenders 
Peterson and Horsch. The second 
period was especially spectacular 
for P~terson as he kept Tech off the 
board by stopping 26 shots. 
Byers' goal seemed to be the game-winner until the Irish settled into a defensive shell for the final 10 minutes. With six and a half minutes left Joelson started a three·on-one break into the Irish zone. Rather than passing, Joel son took the puck into the right faceoff 
circle  and  fired  a  low  bullet  
between Peterson's pads.  
Just when it seemed  as  if the  

game would move into overtime, Younger slipped between Brown­schidle and Dick Howe at the Notre Dame blue line, took a );lass from Doug Young, and beat Peterson on what would have been save number 60. 
Despite the loss, Peterson was chosen the game's top star with his career-high save total, and his rival goalie, Horsch, was chosen the game's second star with 34 saves. 
With a record of 19-9-2 and 40 points, the Irish have clinched second place in the WCHA. After the Wisconsin series next week­end, the WCHA playoffs will begin at the ACC March 9-10.

Erratum 
In yeste ...ay's Observer, a name was omitted from the Bengal Bouts story. Chris McDonald, a Dillon Hall freshman, was a winner in the 125 pound weight division. 


a special individual. He must know himself and how he responds under stress. The good . coach must recognize his own strengths and weaknesses so that plans for games can be made with these in mind. 
Also he must be fleXible and must be able to react to many different kinds of individuals. He must take the time to discover the discriminative cues that tell him how the athlete is reacting to what he is saying and that allows him to anticipate the athlete's response to his praise and discipline. He must be able to recognize the different attention styles of the players and he must have the interpersonal tools for adjusting his instruction to these styles. 
Most of the mistakes that occur in coaching occur b~cause the coach is inflexible and unable to adjust to different situations. Socially we have reached a point where athletes now ··expect and even demand to be treated like individuals.. This individuality is rapidly becoming a way of life, a philosophy if you will. What this means is that the coach will get far more cooperation and respect by responding honestly to the indivi­dual than by treating everyone the same. 
These qualifications demand that a coach be a very special person -a "man for all seasons." Digger Phelps fits the role of a coach, but more than that he fits pedectly the 
· role of a teacher learning from the past while helping, molding and building for tlte futu.re. .

Basketball Names 
Before this college basketball season comes to an end and everybody makes up their minds concerning All-American teams, let's consider what might have been had these elite teams been composed of names only. In keeping with this spirit, I J:Iave researched and compiled a list of appellations that can't help but Stir one's imagination. There's no guarantee that any of these basketball notables are able to pedorm "360" dunks, let alone dribble a basketball, but just imagine the hysterical reaction from the C_!Q..Wd should this team ever be introduced by P A announcer Jack Uoyd ·at the ACC. One stipulation ... nicknames are not among my "Fabulous 15," but for fun, I will list several at the end along with another special starting five that I'll tell you about in a moment. 
When selecting a coach of this team, I was tempted to hire Rollie Massimino of Villanova, but how could I possibly pass up Adrian Buoncristiani of Gonzaga College in the Big Sky Conference? Besides, that first name has nice implications for Notre Dame fans. 
In looking down my starting five, my first choice and Most Valuable Name award went to REDONIA DUCK, the 6-4 scoring star of Farleigh Dickenson. And when he isn't busy doing his thing go the disco beat, he can look for great things from Marietta's own MITCH MIRACLE, a six-foot sophomore guard. Another starter is BROOKS BOATWRIGHT who will certainly have his own boat upon graduation from the Naval Academy. Counted on to "settle" things when the going gets tough is LAWSON PILGRIM, the 6-5 freshman for Arkansas while teammates can look to South Carolina's KARLTON 
HILTON to find them hotel accommodations when needed. 
Right behind the starting five but bucking for star recognition are the second team players. When this team gets really hungry for a basket, they can look toward FLENOIL COOK uf New Mexico who always has the right recipe for a victory. His kitchen help will come from no her thanTexas Tech's KEITH KITCHENS, a 6-1 guard. If 
jit's cold outside, one bird thar refuses to head South is ROBIN PFLUGSATUPT of Central Missouri while Delaware's State's ALGEE LOVELACE and Houston's legitimate All-American candi­date OTIS BIRDSONG found out the second five. 
Not to be overlooked are the members of the Honorable Mention squad with laurels going out to the quintet of MATT COURAGE of William and Mary, SHERMAN PATTON, a floor general with Baylor, DREW HEAD of Oklahoma, the great NATE KATES of Bradley and MULIUFI HANNEMANN of Harvard. And how about a lineup that would include Ted Williams (Toledo), Gordon McRae (Adelphi) and Billy Grahm (Oklahoma)? For the sake of trivia, try guessing what schools these players play for (last names): Sparrow, Nixon, · Goodyear, Riddle, Claus, Holstein, Lively, Wilds and Cheeks. 
Nicknames are always a topic of jokes so why not include Bernard "Loony" Toone of Marquette, Bruce "Sky" King oflowa, Clyde "the Glide" Austin of N.C. State, Cedric "Cornbread" macwell of NC-Charlotte, hiw teammate Melvin "Bionics" Watkins, John "Blue" Board and Jerome "The Magician" Bell, both of Virginia State, Les "High Rise" Anderson of George Washington, Kevin "Big Fish" Bass of Iona and John "Ba Ba" Duren of Georgetown among several thousand others. 
Thanks to the assistence rendered by none other than the Grace 5-D pair of basketball experts, Kevin Nelson and John Reynolds, I nc;>w conclude this absurdity with an All-Cool starting five. Besides the requirement of an uncommon first or last name, it is important that these players symbolize the quality of coolness above and beyond the call of duty. The two guards would include Otis Birdsong of Houston and Winford Boynes of San Francisco, forwards Ulice Payne of Marquette and Marques Johnson 0f UCLA with the center being 
..._Roosevelt Bouie of Syracuse. ~
