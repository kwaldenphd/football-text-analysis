Group addresses budget concerns 
Belles say Saint Mary's student government executives receive too large of a stipend 
By LIZ HARTER and SARAH 
MAYER 
News Writers 
A group of about 35 Saint Mary's students met with members of the Student Government Association (SGA) Executive Board. Vice President of Student Affairs Karen Johnson and director of Student Involvement and Board of Governance (BOG) advisor Patrick Daniel to dis­cuss concerns they have about the SGA budget 
approved by the Executive Board last week. 
For the second time in College history, the Executive Board, consisting of student body president Mickey Gruscinski, student body vice president Sarah Falvey, chief of staff Lauren Theiss, execu­tive treasurer Mo Weaver, Residence Hall Association (RHA) coordinator Maura Clougherty, Student Diversity Board (SDB) coordinator Adriana Rodriguez, Student Activities Board coordinator (SAB) Michele Peterson and executive secretary Jenny Hoffman has allotted them­selves a stipend in the SGA budget. The budget contain­ing $243,040, which comes from the student fees includ­ed in the tuition of every full­time student, was first intro­duced last week at the Board of Governance meeting with a $20,000 stipend for the Executive Board. 
Senior Sarah Voss coordi­nated the event after hearing about concerns BOG mem­bers raised when the budget was discussed Wednesday 
and_frustrations voiced by fel­low students. 
"The only thing I want to accomplish is to let students voice their opinions on the budgeting issue. I want stu­dents to know that the BOG and administrators should make decisions that are in the best interest of the entire student body," she told The Observer Sunday. 
Johnson said she was excit­ed about the forum because if is the first time in the three

Students to cast ballots in Inock election 
By KAITLYNN RIELY Associate News Editor 
One month before the real Nov. 4 presidential election, Notre Dame students can cast their ballots today for the next president of the United States in the student govern­ment's mock election. 
The purpose of the mock exercise, student body vice president Grant Schmidt said, is to encourage people to dis­cuss the candidates and the issues. 
"The point of this is to mobilize the students and get people talking," Schmidt said. "We didn't want a simple poll, we wanted this to be an edu­cational process or an event." 
Student Senate University Affairs chair Ashlee Wright, who will be helping to staff the voting centers today, said she is cu:dous to see how the campus aligns itself political­ly. 
"It will be very interesting to get the facts instead of just the stereotypes," she said. 
The results won't be scien­tifically accurate, Schmidt said, but he said he is inter­ested in getting a rough idea of how Notre Dame students

By JOHN-PAUL WITT News Writer 
Ninn people were taken into custody on Saturday, accord­ing to Phil Johnson, the direc­tor of Notre Dame Security Police (NDSP). Arrests were made by NDSP, the Indiana State Excise Police, St. Joseph County Police and South Bend Police Department. 
This compares to 35 custo­dial arrests last week when Purdue visited and three cus­todial arrests during the October 7, 2006 Notre Dame­Stanford game according to an October 10, 2006 Observer article. 
Outside the stadium, nine citations were issued for minor consuming alcohol, one person was cited for public indecency and one person was taken to jail after being arrested for public intoxica­tion. 
During the game, eight peo­ple were transported to jail for public intoxication, and seven others were ejected from the stadium for alcohol related violations of stadium rules.

Sorin announces they will boycott pep rallies 
By IRENA ZAJICKOVA 
News Writer 
Notre Dame fans present at last Friday's pep rally in the Joyce Athletic Convocation Center (JACC) may have noticed only five of the six host dorms in attendance. The sixth dorm 
asked  to  host,  the  Sorin  
Otters, decided  to  boycott  
tho pep rally.  

Juniors Aidan McKiernan and Tristan Hunt, the presi­dent and vice president of Sorin llall announced they would boycott the ceremony in a letter to the editor of The Observer Friday. They said their intention is not to publicly refuse to show their support for the foot­ball team. Hather, they wish to bring about a change in 
the current pep rally proto­col. 
"We know this school sup­ports the team," Hunt said. "But we don't think that they should have to put up with an hour of organized entertainment to do it." 
McKiernan and Hunt said pep rallies have stopped being purely for the stu­dents and have taken on a more corporate, formulaic atmosphere in an attempt to appeal to atumni and visi­tors. Previously, the pep ral­lies were held in the Stepan Center and featured more interaction between the stu­dents and the football team. 
"The first hour and fifteen minutes is what we're against," McKiernan said, referring to the time stu­

She's a lady 
I'm nearly positive that Miss 

Mamwrs would be revoltml by some of 
the unladylike behavior I exhibit. But 
lattdy I've hmm thinking that maybe 
Miss Manners should get over it. 
Maybt~ etiquette and ladylike courtesy 
have ollidally died. And maybe that's 
not so terrible after all. 
A multitude of unladylike behavior is 

exhibited on this campus. The modern 
woman curses, goes stag to dances, 
fails to wear pantyhose and even 
wears white after

and even burp 
when the occasion 
calls for it. The modern Notre Dame 
woman even body paints on game day 
and wears pants to church. All shock­
ing behavior. I'm sure. 
Then again let's consider some lady­

like behavior that has joyfully gone the 
way of the dinosaur. For one, we are 
frnn to no longer ride side saddle. Not 
that tlw modern woman has much 
opportunity to ride horses, much less 
ride them properly, but you get the 
gist. Additionally, we no longer are 
expected to sip tea, pinky up or chew 
like we havt~ a seernt. And it's a 
refreshing chang<~ to lm rid of that 
arrangmlmarriage thing. It's also not 
so bad that c:orsets are only found in 
museums. 
Maylw if chivalry is dead than it only naturally follows that female demure­Iwss should share its grave. Perhaps this marks a shift toward androgyny where wonHm are allowed to say what tlwy want and wear what they want and think what they want. Meanwhile, men are allownd to stop asking women on dates, stop holding doors, and stopping being confined by an opprnssive masculine stereotype of sports obsessive, misogynistic, red­meat-eating jocks. Not that Notre Dame women or men embody and or all of these stereotypical characteriza­tions. 
Earlier this semester I explained why we women bake. Now I lind myself delighted and surprised by the very domesticity of that question. It's not that we don't bake or knit or enjoying wearing dresses. But it's also not that we are solely obliged to see ourselves as nothing more than house­wife, baby makers. Maybe Samantha Jones and Serena Vanderwoodsen arc not our ideals. But it's doubtful that Joan Clnaver is our desirnd future either. 
So yt~s I curse and I hate the use of nuphmnistk substitutions like "fudge" or "darn it." And yes, I cannot avoid speaking my mind and tond to speak oxcessivoly. I say ploaso and thank you, but I don't cross my logs at the ankle and don't wait for doors to be opened to me. But, I'm also the first to dawn a dress and enjoy a good knit­ting session. So maybo Miss Manners was wrong. Maybe tho human spirit, main or fmnale, cannot bn confined and rnstrietnd by a set of rules. Maybn we should build S(llf respnet and extend our respect to others. Maybe that's mwugh. Maybe that's what it truly is to be a lady. But moreover, maybe that's what it is to be a person.

"Things really came to a head before the Stanford game," Hunt said. "Since we were asked to host, we had to decide if we would go or not."

Dyer speaks about Iraq pullout 
By MOLLY MADDEN News Writer 
Author of the book "After Iraq" and journalist Gwynne Dyer addressed the much-debated topic of how the eventual with­drawal of American troops from Iraq will affect not only the United States but also the world at the Hesburgh Center for International Studies Monday 
night. . 
Dyer said in order to under­stand what might possibly hap­pen in the future, one has to have an understanding of the people and their motives. 
"Terrorists are people who have political goals and use acts of terror to achieve these goals," he said. "Unfortunately for them, they do not have big budgets." 
While many Americans have the idea that terrorists participate in their acts of violence as a means of reaching self-emulation, Dyer tries to discourage this notion. 
"The people in charge are almost all revolutionaries," Dyer said. "These guys are only con­cerned with achieving their goals. The principle strategy of terror is to drive the opposition, whether it be your own government or a for­eign occupier, into becoming so oppressive that the common peo­ple turn against the government and are driven into the revolu­tionaries' arms." 
Dyer said accomplishing this mission and driving common peo­ple to revolt is no easy task. 
"People have to be really des­perate to radicalize and put the revolutionaries in power," Dyer said. 
In the eyes of many Arabs, their governments have no credibility because they failed their people and sold out to foreigners. However, in the 1970s, a radical religious movement was con­ceived that brought a united front to the Arab world. 
"In Arab countries in the 1970s there was this idea that you could fix all the problems with an applied religious ideology because there did not seem to be any other way to fix things," Dyer said. 
This Islamist ideology argued the Arab Muslims are in their dreadful situations because they have been Westernized, Dyer said. Islamists believe revolution and violence are necessary because they will bring people back to Islam, and then God will be on the revolutionaries' side and things will start to change for the better. 
Dyer said these events preced­ed the horrors of Sept. 11, 2001. 
"Bin Laden rose to the top because he had the most plausi­ble strategy -attack the United States with the goal of drawing the U.S. into a military invasion in the Middle East," Dyer said. "This invasion will invoke a long gueril­la war in which the U.S. will be killing Muslims. Bin Laden believed that the common people would see those images and would revolutionize. In that case, 9/11 had the desired effect ­partly." 
The United States invaded Afghanistan but recruited the various ethnic militias to over­throw the Taliban -this tactic prevented revolution. When Kabul fell in November 2001, there were only 500 American troops on the ground of Afghanistan, a country with a population of thirty million. However, Bin Laden received what he wanted with the American invasion of Iraq in March of 2003, he said. · 
"Iraq provided all the images that Bin Laden wanted to get out of Afghan'istan," Dyer stated. "The Middle East has been deeply radicalized by what has hap­pened in Iraq." 
However, Dyer said he believes the pullout from Iraq will not be as bad as many Americans think. 
"Apart from oil, these countries are of no interest to the West," Dyer said. "They have to sell us oil because they need money. You might pay more for oil but they will continue to sell to us out of necessity." 
In addition, Dyer said an "Arab Revolution" is unlikely to happen because many in the region would resist submitting to the strict Islamic laws. 
"Most Arabs don't want to be imposed on like the Taliban did in Afghanistan," Dyer said. "They do not want to put those type of peo­ple in power." 
Dyer said the United States would actually be safer from the fear of attack if the revolutionar­ies gain a position of power. Since the revolutionaries would be in power, there would be no reason to form an attack.

Taliban, Afghan leaders met last week 
KABUL, Afghanistan -A former Taliban ambassador said Monday that the hard-line militants sat with Afghan officials and Saudi King Abdullah over an important religious meal in Saudi Arabia late last month as the insurgency raged back home. 
Abdul Salam Zaeef, the Taliban's former ambassador to Pakistan, denied that the get-together could be construed as peace talks. But President Hamid Karzai has long called for negotiations with the Taliban, and the meeting could spur future initia­tives. 
With U.S. and NATO forces suffering their deadliest year so far in Afghanistan, the top 
U.N. envoy, Kai Eide, said Monday that the war "has to be won through political means." 
"And that means political engagement. Then comes a question -with whom do you engage? My general answer is that if you want to have relevant results you must speak to those who are relevant," Eide told a news conference. "But these are process­es that are very difficult to initiate. Nevertheless, in my view a policy of engagement is the right policy."

Dow loses 370, drops below 10,000 
Index under that markforfirst time infour years; lost as much as 800 points, but later rallied 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Wall Street suffered through another extraordinary and traumatic session Monday, with the Dow Jones industrials plunging as much as 800 points -their largest one-day point drop ­before recovering to close with a loss of 370. The cata­lyst for the selling, which also took the Dow below 10,000 for the first time in four years, was investors' growing despair that the spreading credit crisis will take a heavy toll around the world. 
Investors have come to the realization that the Bush administration's $700 billion rescue plan and steps taken by other governments won't work quickly to unfreeze the credit markets. 
That sent stocks spiraling downward in the U.S., Europe and Asia, and drove investors to sink money into the relative safety of U.S. gov­ernment debt. Fears about a global recession also caused oil to drop .below $90 a bar­rel. 
"The fact is, people are scared and the only thing they're doing is selling," said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer's Investment Research. "Investors are cleaning out portfolios and getting rid of everything because nothing seems to be working."

administered goes up a little each year depending on the usage from the following year," Brubaker said. 
Students, staff and faculty ean receive free flu shots today, Wednesday and Thursday in the Joyce Center at gates 1 and 2 from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on a first come, first served basis. 
According to Brubaker, this year's vaccine prevents three different strains of the influenza virus-all of which are new strains this flu sea­son. 
While the influenza vaccine remains effective for about six months depending on an individual's immune system, Brubaker said Health Services strategically plans to administer the free flu shots about 10 days before stu­dents leave campus for fall break to allow students to develop immunity. 
"[Students] come back from fall break with a lot of ill­nesses, and we try to prevent this as much as we can by offering the vaccine before fall break," Brubaker said. 
Brubaker also said that Health Services offers the influenza vaccine earlier than other health care centers in the community, and that any­one who wishes to receive the vaccine should do so before December for the vaccine to be effective. 
According to Brubaker, the flu season comes in two waves, usually in December and March. 
Brubaker said "high-risk" individuals should seriously consider receiving the vac­cine, including anyone with asthma, chronic diseases, people taking medication and people with respiratory prob­lems. 
"[The vaccine] also ·helps prevent students from miss­ing two weeks of school or from being miserable for two weeks," she said. 
Sophomore Rachel Koch said she plans to take advan­tage of the free flu shots this week since the vaccines are conveniently offered on cam­pus. 
"It seems like it's something that is easy to do, and will prevent me from getting sick," Koch said. 
Brubaker also explained it is much easier to prevent flu viruses than it is to recover from them. 
"There is no cure for influenza, so it's better to prevent it than to try to cure it. There are some anti-viral medications, but it's up for debate about how good they are," Brubaker said. 
According to Brubaker, University Health Services purchases the vaccines out of their budget in conjunction with money from Human Resources to provide the campus with free vaccines. 
"We feel it's an investment to keep people well, and that preventing illness is as important as caring for sick students," she said. 
Brubaker said University Health Services has been a "sentinel site" for about the past 10 years, providing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) with data about how influenza affects the campus communi­ty each year. 
"Notre Dame is part of a national watchdog group for viruses," she said. "We col­lect data to help plan for which flu strains the vaccine will be made in the coming year." 
Brubaker said all who wish to receive a flu shot from Health Services this week should bring their Notre Dame J.D. card, wear short sleeves and be prepared to sign a consent form before receiving a vaccination.

IN BRIEF 
Americans lose utilities for nonpayment 
COHOES, N.Y.-The number of Americans whose electricity or gas has been shut off for nonpayment of their bills is up sharply in many parts of the country as people struggle to cope with higher prices and a shaky economy. 
Shut-offs have been running 17 percent higher than last year among customers of New York state's major utilities, and 22 percent higher in economically hard-hit Michigan. They are up in all or part of dozens of other states, including Pennsylvania, Florida and California, according to an Associated Press check of regulators and energy companies. 
Despite stepped-up efforts by state and federal governments, utilities and private groups to help people avoid shut-offs this winter, some worry the problem will only get worse in the coming months, particularly with the downturn on Wall Street. 
"I just didn't have the money to pay," said Marie Williams, a single mother raising four daughters in Cohoes, N.Y., a former mill city on the Hudson River. "Rent had to be paid, and food for the girls." 
Williams' power was cut off this summer for about a week, forcing her girls to do homework by candlelight. She became one of more than 230,000 residential customers of New York's 10 major utilities to have their service shut ofT for nonpayment through August of this year. 
Economists: U.S. on verge of recession 
WASHINGTON -A growing number of economists believe the country is on the brink of -or already in -its first recession since 2001 and that it will be longer lasting. 
That's part of the latest outlook from fore­casters in a survey to be released Monday by the National Association for Business Economics, also know by its acronym NABE. 
Close to 69 percent of the economists think the economy has started or will enter a reces­sion this year. That's up from 56 percent in a survey in May. "The general view is .... that this recession will be longer than the last two -lasting roughly one year, but relatively mild," the survey concluded. The 2001 reces­sion started in March and ended in November. The one before that began in July 1990 and ended in March 1991. 
Hearings open on Lehman collapse 
Lawmakers denounce executive's culture of entitlement at investment bank 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -The now­
bankrupt investment bank 
Lehman Brothers arranged 
millions in bonuses for fired 
executives as it pleaded for a 
federal lifeline, lawmakers 
learned Monday, as Congress 
began investigating what 
went so wrong on Wall Street 
to prompt a $700 billion gov­

Glass club gains official status 
Organizati~n, now University sponsored, is good stress reliever 
By SARAH MERVOSH 
News Writer 
l.ato at night in the labs of the Jordan Hall of Seinnen, students gather to eombinn their sdnntif­ie and artistic passions by mold­ing hot glass into jewelry or etching a pieturn onto a pane as part of Notre Damn's Glass Club. 
Both co-president Matthew Napinrski and eo-president Kelly Jones joinnd the dub last year when it was first getting started and neither had previ­ous experience working with glass. 
"Them's not expnrienee nec­essary, just willingness to learn," Napierski said. "I came in knowing nothing about this and right now I love nothing more than to make beads." 
Jones said although shn is not artistically talented, she still enjoys working with glass. 
''I'm not particularly artisti­cally talented. You just have to like doing arl'i and crafts," said Jones. 
Napierski added working with glass is a stress reliever, espe­eially considering his busy schedule. 
''I'm on the crew team and 
I'm a chemical engineer and 
neither one of those ·things is 
relaxing. This is kind of my out­
let," he said. 

This is Glass Club's first year as an ollicial club, founder and senior Bryce Chung said. He founded the club because he had worked with glass in high school and "want[ed] glass to be a part of campus." 
I le said members of the club can work with either hot or cold glass. 
"llot working" is anything that you do with glass involving a llame, he said. Most of the hot working that occurs in glass club has to do with bead mak­ing. 
Sophomore and co-president Kelly Jones makes her own jew­elry from the beads that she makes. 
"You can use (the beads] as centerpieces or focal points of jewelry," Jones said. 
Chung said that his favorite part about working with hot glass is that it takes on a life of il<>own. 
"It's dynamic," he said. "It really does start moving on its

own. It's really a matter of working with the glass." 
Chung explains that when the glass becomes hot, it becomes malleable and so he must keep it constantly moving. When working with hot glass, he must be able to control multiple things going different directions at the same time. 
"It's like driving a stick shift," he said. 
Chung also said the malleabil­ity of hot glass is like having a little kid. 
"It picks up everything you do, but you still have control," he said. "So it's like driving a stick shift with a little kid in the car." 
Jones said Glass Club pro­vides alternatives to working with fire, such as stained glass or etching. 
Glass Club also offers services such as hosting section events. 
"It's a bonding thing that a lot of girls dorms like to do," Napierski said. "What most of them end up doing is stuff for their dorm." 
The Glass Club meets every Tuesday and Wednesday from 8 to 10 p.m. in Hoom 106 in Jordan Hall of Science. The cost to join Glass Club is per atten­
dance. It is $5 for the first time, and $10 for every meet­ing attended after that. But $65 is the maximum price per semester.

Fan use lovvers risk of sudden infant death 
Associated Press 

CHICAGO -Using a fan to cir­culate air seemed to lower the risk of sudden infant death syn­drome in a study of nearly 500 babies, researchers reported Monday. 
Placing babies on their backs to sleep is the best advice for pre­venting SIDS, a still mysterious cause of death. Experts also rec­
ommend a firm mattress, removing toys and pillows from cribs, and keeping infants from getting too warm. 
Such practices helped slash U.S. SIDS deaths by more than half over a decade to about 2,100 in 2003. But SIDS remains the leading cause of 

death in infants ages 1 month to 1 year. 
"The baby's sleeping environ­ment really matters," said study senior author Dr. De-Kun U of the Kaiser Permanente Division of Hesearch in Oakland, Calif. "This seems to suggest that by improv­ing room ventilation we can fur­ther reduce risk." 
SIDS is the sudden death of an otherwise healthy infant that can't be attributed to any other cause. These babies may have brain abnormalities that prevent them from gasping and waking when they don't get enough oxy­gen. 
The new study, published in October's Archives of Podiatries & Adolescent Medicine, offers another way to make sure babies get enough air. 
More research is needed, said Dr. Fern !Iauck of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, but she said that because fan use is in line with theories, it may be worth considering. 
"This is the 
first study that 
we know of

Palin's remarks outrageous and grossly exaggerated. 
A 13-minute Web video Obama's campaign released Monday revisits McCain's ties to Charles Keating, a former friend, campaign contributor and sav­ings and loan owner who was convicted of securities fraud in 1991. 
As a senator, McCain partici­pated in two meetings with bank­ing regulators on Keating's behalf. He became one of the "Keating Five" senators investi­gated by the Senate ethics com­mittee. The panel cited McCain for a lesser role than others, but criticized his "poor judgment." ' 
McCain has since called his involvement with Keating "the worst mistake of my life." 
McCain and Obama say they are dredging up Ayers and Keating because the episodes shed light on each other's cur­rent judgment -and because the other campaign is on the attack, though a McCain aide said the GOP campaign wanted to change the subject from the failing economy. 
A few months ago, both candi­dates promised something better. 
Obama, extolling a new brand of politics, told an Iowa audience in January: "We can't afford the same old partisan food fight. We can't afford a politics that's all about tearing opponents down instead of lifting the country up." 
McCain, shaken by a vicious whisper campaign in South Carolina that helped George W. Bush beat him there during the 2000 Republican primaries, has often vowed to be a straight­shooting candidate who puts honor ahead of winning. When Republicans attacked fellow retired Navy officer Kerry in the 2004 "Swiftboat" episode, McCain called the ads "dishonest and dishonorable." 
Earlier in this campaign when the North Carolina Republican Party said Obama's relationship with Rev. Wright made him "too extreme," McCain asked it to stop and said: "There's no place for that kind of campaigning, and the American people don't want it." 
The new tone may depress many, but a top independent pollster in the battleground state of Pennsylvania said it's unlikely to change many minds. 
"The economy is so dominant and the change focus so great, I just don't think voters are going to buy into it," said Terry Madonna, a political scientist at Franklin and Marshall College.

With the fmancial sector in crisis mode, Americans are once again tuning in to everyone's favorite reality TV show, The Blame Game. This season's riveting plot takes place in our nation's capitol, where Congressmen and Senators on both sides of the political aisle have launched an all­out attack on one another, with plenty of name-calling and finger-pointing to go around. People all across the nation, not to mention the world, sit perched at Christie the edge of their Pesavento seats, eagerly await­ing the upcom4Ig

ing to find out the 
answer to a single 
question: who is to blame? 
The whole debacle might be mildly entertaining if it wasn't for a slight prob­lem: this particular reality show, unlike others of the same genre, portrays reali­ty. And it comes with a hefty $700 billion dollar price tag for American taxpayers. Now that the bailout plan has been passed and signed, the finger-pointing can continue without any pesky legisla­tion to negotiate. The question of who is at fault, however, remains unresolved. 
Amidst the political chaos of the past few weeks, it has become difficult for observers to determine which indict­ments are justified and which are merely attempts to win over public support. What seems to have registered among voters is that corporate greed has led to the current predicament, and it is now up to hardworking, middle-class Americans to bail them out. With both John McCain and Barack Obama launch­ing into similar tirades against Wall Street, backed by a chorus of support in Congress, the reasons behind these wide­spread beliefs are understandable. 
If Congressional leaders really wanted to discover the truth of who is to blame, however, all they would have to do is look into a mirror. Unfortunately, finding a politician who is willing to take responsi­bility for his or her failures would be ask­ing for nothing short of a miracle, espe­cially during an election season. Instead of admitting guilt, they will often resort to 
EDITORIAL CARTOON 
reciting populist mantras against easy targets. In this ease, they have attempted to avert conviction by projecting their 
· own greed and incompetence onto those voracious villains on Wall Street. 
Greed in Wall Street is nothing new; on the contrary, our capitalist system is driv­en by it, and thriVI;JS because of it. Of course excessive greed can be dangerous if it leads to reckless financial practices and illegal activity, but blaming the pur­suit of wealth for the situation at hand is akin to blaming hunger for obesity, when it is really the poor decisions made in between that lead from one to the other. The poor decisions that led to the current mess, as we will soon discover, were encouraged by governmental encroach­ment on the market. 
In order to determine the source of today's fmancial crisis, we must go back in time a few decades, beginning with the passage of the Community Reinvestment Act in 1977 under President Jimmy Carter. This law was implemented "to encourage depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of the communities in which they operate, including low-and moderate-income neighborhoods, consis­tent with safe and sound banking opera­tions." 
In 1992, when Bill Clinton was President, the law was amended to address problems of oversight and to appease community activist organiza­tions that demanded an increase in the number of low income homeowners. Among other mandates, the amendment 
· required that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mae purchase a certain percentage of loans to areas of low income and poor credit ratings. 
Normally, lending institutions would refuse to make these sub-prime loans because of the risk of not being repaid, and Fannie and Freddie would not pur­chase them because of their stringent guidelines. After 1992, however, the guidelines were loosened in order to encourage sub-prime lending, thereby allowing lending institutions to profit while transferring the risk onto Fannie and Freddie. It is a classic example of good intentions leading to disastrous 
unintended consequences. 
Now let us jump ahead to 2003, when the Bush administration was calling for renewed efl'orts at regulation in light of charges of fraud and mismanagement against Fannie and Freddie. Democratic Representative Barney Frank of the Financial Services Committee was quoted in the New York Times as saying, "These two entities -Fannie Mae and Freddie Mae-are not facing any kind of linan­cial crisis. The more people exaggerate these problems, the more pressure there is on these companies, the less we will see in terms of affordable housing." 
Two years later, SP.n. McCain eo-spon­sored a second attempt to forestall a financial meltdown, stating "If' Congress does not act, American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the enormous risk that Fannie Mac and Freddie Mae pose to t)le housing market, the overall financial system, and the economy as a whole." His bill never made it to the Senate lloor. The two biggest financial beneficiaries of Fannie Mae in terms of political money, Demoeratic Hepresp,ntativfl Chris Dodd and SAnator Obama, were conspicuously silent. 
And the rest is history. 
ThA moral of the story? GovernmAnt regulation, dP.spitn good intentions, can easily turn a secure situation into an unmitigated disaster. 
Now politicians are demanding more federal regulation to solve the problem. Most Americans would hope that pnople elected to sueh high oiTiee would have the intelligence and wisdom to loarn from past mistakes, but this isn't the casA when politicians aro caught up in the lat­est season of The Blame Game. Healizing that avoiding ealls for more regulation would mean an admittance of guilt, thfly have decided to transfer the blame else­where, in effect risking the nation's eco­nomic stability to save their own skins.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Irish flag -won't fly 
I agree that making an Irish flag out of our student section is a fantastic idea. However, it's just not going to happen this year. For starters, you can't expect a couple of columns to impact the game day dress of thousands of student fans. Secondly, as I mentally rummage through my dresser drawers, I'm pretty sure I don't have an orange Notre Dame shirt. Anyone in the "orange" section would second guess the idea of wearing a shirt on game day that has nothing to do with Notre Dame football, even if it is for a greater visual cause. So here's my idea: next year, when students buy their tickets, include "The Shirt" with that purchase. And let the section on a student's ticket booklet determine which color shirt (green, white, or orange) he or she receives. I've never understood why Notre Dame hasn't integrated the spirit shirt with the ticket booklets; a lot of other schools do this and achieve great results in participation (forget other schools, just look at the uniformity of the Leprechaun Legion). By the way, the fund-raising muscles of "The Shirt" project wouldn't be hurt in the slightest; the bookstore could still sell the green version to fans. And it might make tickets cost $15 more next year, but let's face it, Notre Dame was already going to do that anyway.

Fun police 

I have read several of the letters and articles about the Gestapo­like behavior of the ND and other security "forces" on campus for football weekends and generally on campus and in town through­out the year. I wholeheartedly concur in the view that these "squads" are completely out of control. Their tactics and obsessive pursuit of "rule enforcement" regularly taint and, at times, ruin the experience of being on campus for me. My wife, who is not an NDISMC grad, is astonished by their anal behavior and "goon-like" approach to their work. The unfortunate reality, however, is that they are just following orders. If the University Administrators wanted a more relaxed approach that is conducive to the festive camaraderie that football weekends are supposed to be, they could very easily "call off the dogs". But over the last 37 years that I have been coming to ND as a student, alum, and now parenValum, I only see the situation becoming more insulting and obnoxious. 
With respect to the game day experience, I would ask Fr. Jenkins: What is it about the ND faithful that makes the University so afraid of us being on our campus? How is it that the University knows bet­ter than us what our "family atmosphere" is supposed to be like or what we need to do to be "safe?" At what point does the University recognize us as the responsible grown-ups we were supposed to be, in part, due to the benefit of our ND education and experience? I would advise Fr. Jenkins to tell the troops to lighten up or NO's rep­utation as a great place to be from but not such a great place to be at, will continue to grow.

Of colors and T-shirts 
As mentioned in several letters last week, I too think it would be great to have a green-out or blue-out with all fans wearing the same color. However, there are only two feasible ways to do this. First, is is the responsibility of the Alumni and other fans to wear the color of the students. This year, The Shirt is blue, and most students wear either The Shirt or a knockoff of the same color. The other option (for a green-out ifin a blue The Shirt year) would be to have free T-shirts handed out at the stadium when fans enter. Get a good sponsor and it might not even cost too much. There is one more thing though. There will always be those people (especially students) who think they will be really cool or funny if they wear something else to stick out. If this occurs in your sec­tion, simply notify a nearby usher that you may have smelled some kind of alcohol near that person. They will promptly be removed for most of the game regardless of their sobriety.

Ver111in co111e out on top 
I write this on behalf of the Vermin of Carroll hall, who so recently had their dignity chal­lenged by Mimi Disipio, a Sophomore in Pangborn Hall. When asked an ambiguous question, posed by a low-level member of the Observer, she voiced the opinion that Carroll Hall is the most irrelevant dorm on campus. Ha! Upon reading this comical statement, my fellow Vermin and I realized that it may not be as obvious to everyone else on campus, why Carroll Hall is near the top of the relevance food chain. 
Ms. Disipio argues that Carroll is irrelevant because "it 's out there by itself. " If this argu­ment held any water, then we could effectively regard Yoda as irrelevant to the original Star Wars trilogy. Faulty, this logic is. To the outsider, the distance from Carroll to South Quad prob­ably seems daunting. "They should get you golf carts! " or "Do you ever get lost on your way to class? " are common and cheeky questions that we must endure and pretend to find funny and original time after time. But if everyone had to walk an extra five minutes to and from the dining hall, they wouldn 't have to pretend to feel guilty about going to the soft-serve machine anymore. Our location on campus is actually far more convenient than it may appear. With adjacent outdoor basketball and volleyball courts, the Carroll Country Club on the Lake encourages an active lifestyle for the residing Vermin. 
A quick trip into the dorm will reveal doubles the size of your super quad, and12-foot ceil­ings. Our location also allows us to be the Notre Dame ambassadors to another area college, the College of Saint Mary 's. With our dorm strategically placed between the middle of campus and Saint Mary 's, Belles don 't fear the distance to campus, and often stop to enjoy the wel­coming company of our fine gentlemen. Finally, let 's talk about signature events. With the arrival of every cold December, comes the warm and festive celebration of Christmas, Carroll style (I think we all remember the embarrassing ink that Pangborn got about their secular dis­play of Christmas spirit last Winter). "A Carroll Christmas, " the hall event with the third high­est budget awarded by the Hall President 's Council, includes performances from choirs on campus, Christmas treats, a visit from Santa Claus, and the lighting of the tallest Christmas tree on campus (as a side note, our hall event is never canceled due to bad weather). 
This fine University was founded on the idea of Mary giving birth to the Messiah, so clearly, any allegations of irrelevance directed towards the dorm deemed worthy enough to host such a celebration are in fact irrelevant themselves. In conclusion, and after much consideration, I not only place Carroll on the "list of relevant dorms, " I posit that Carroll Hall is the greatest of all dorms on Our Lady 's campus, and any arguments against this proven fact are based solely on pangs of jealousy and spite. Go Vermin!

Straight fro111 the bleeding heart 
When someone gets dumped by their boyfriend or girlfriend, the rule of thumb is one week of mourning for every six months you were together. Well, the 2008 Cubs reported to spring training about eight months ago, so we Cubs fans are going to need at least ten days to get over this. And by this, I mean the choke or sweep from this year. 
We will never get over the cloud that eternally hovers over these players in the blue pinstripes every year. 
I am not going to pick out a single curse or story, but I. am going to affirm the much bandied­about idea that we are cursed. And I use "we" because it is not just the team; it is the fans, too. While these things happen over and over again on the field, the fans continue to be stupid and loyal enough to stick with the team and get their hearts broken repeatedly. We lead a trivial sports life of hardcore rooting and blind prophecies that this will be the year while all other fans smile and nod at our stupidity and see through our words to the sad truth. 
One could say, "They're not cursed, they just have bad luck," or, "They choke or just can't come through in big games." Well, fine. I agree with that and while it's commonly called a curse, you could just as easily throw jinxed or hexed or whatever you want on there. It's a matter of seman­tics, and we are all talking about the devastating reality. Something about the intangible concept of playing for the Cubs causes ground balls to trickle through infielders' legs, hitters to take pitches down the middle while swinging at junk in the dirt, and ace starting pitchers to throw awful games when it means something. 
So contest it being a curse or a hex or bad luck or even deny its existence if you so choose, but if you do that, tell me how a 97-win team-the best since 1945 and the best team in the NL-man­ages to lay an egg and get swept by a team that did not smell .500 for more than three weeks of the year.

Today and tomorrow, thn Philbin 
Studio Theatn\ will host "The 
Mushroom Picker" on behalf of the 
Nanovic Institute for European 
Studies at the University of Notre 
Dame. "Thn Mushroom Picker" is a 
one-man show written by playwright 
Patrkk Dewane. 
The play tells the story of 
I>Pwane's CZPch-Ameriean grandfa­
ther. Matt Konop. A mmnbM of the 
"Greatest Gnneration," Konop was a 
World War II veteran whose radio 
handle in the 1970s, "The 
Mushroom Picker," helped inspire 
I>ewane's venture into his family's 
past. Tho play moves from Konop's 
roots in a Midwnstnrn Czech farming 
community -Konop was born near 
Grmm Bay, Wisconsin -to the war 
ynars. 
J>ewane cites his hPritage and 
family background. as members of 
tho Czech immigrant community in 
thn Unitml Stattls, as the larger inspi­
ration and overarching context of 
the show. 
"Those people, my people spoke Czech for lifty years in this country bnforn they learned English," lkwane told Minnesota Public Hadio in May. 
The play is pn\sented in English with various references to that Czech language. According to Dewann's retelling, this lingual duplicity is what lent his f.,>Tandlather to military service. Konop was a linutenant colonel in the Army whose unit led the liberation of Czechoslovakia from Nazi fon~es. Fluent in Cznch and English, Konop was able to play a critical role in the operation. Thosn years of Konop's life am the main focus of "The Mushroom Picker." 
Dewann, in an interview featured on the De Bartolo Performing Arts Ctmtnr Web site. retells how he camn across his grandfather's story. "Twenty years after he dind, my sis­tm Jane is in my aunt's basement, rummaging through old things, and she comes across a box that has a st;u:k of writings. She brought them out and made copies of them, and handed out my grandfather's writing as Christmas presents." 
Dewane was struck by the poignancy of the writing that Konop had left bnhind. 
"1 became obsessed with his story," I>ewane said, "So what I did is I turned it into a one-man show. I've come to believe that he wrote down his stories for me, that I could tell them to you." 
"The Mushroom Picker" is playing tonight and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. Tiekets am $10 for general admis­sion. $H for faculty and stall', and $5 for seniors and students. Veterans are invited to the pnrformanee with a spncial ticket prkP of $5. The show will run approximately two hours and 15 minutes.

It has been said that the "Golden Days" of cinema have long since passed. Sure, "Citizen Kane" is but a memory that can be bought as a 60th anniversary DVD, and the raw essence of romance has never again been so vividly depicted as it was in "Casablanca," but that doesn't mean that brilliance in film­making is a lost art. 
It seems that the original classics were the first films to combine all the elements of masterful filmmaking. They will always be put on a pedestal that new movies, no matter how masterful, are incapable of reaching. Why? Sadly, because we all (especially many top critics) have a preconceived notion that nothing can top the great films of the past. 
Yes, the caliber of movies as a whole has suffered in recent years, but the 'masterpiece' is still very much alive. It took 20 years for the film industry to realize that "Citizen Kane" was worthy of being called "the greatest film of all-time," so per­haps all is not lost. Maybe one day a modern film will be put on the same pedestal as the classics. The following is a list of the five 21st-century American films most likely to attain leg­endary status down the road. 
5) United 93: Paul Greengrass' heart-wrenching docudrama is undying in its commitment to telling the arresting true story of what happened to the doomed heroes aboard United Airlines flight 93 on Sept. 11, 2001. Both impossible to watch, yet too difficult to turn away from, "United 93" is pitch-per­fect and represents the most inexorably true account of 9/11 to grace the silver screen to this day. 
4) Lord of the Rings: Return of the King: Everything about the last installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy is epic. Clocking in at a lengthy 3:30, Peter Jackson's send-off to 
J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved classic manages to tie together every element of the journe_y while achieving the type of metaphori­cal brilliance the first two films lacked. 
3)There Will Be Blood: This one is destined to be studied by film students for years to come. Paul Thomas Anderson's unrelenting work details the life of a genius oil man, Daniel Plainview, played by Daniel-Day Lewis in one of the most searing performances in movie history. His greed and moral ... corruption lead him down a path of conflict with religion and humanity alike, is, in its purest form, an aesthetic revelation the likes of which haven't been seen since "Citizen Kane". 
1 (tie) Mulholland Drive: David Lynch's masterpiece is film at its very best. From the bewildering opening scene, when Lynch first immerses his audience in a fever hallucination of a film, until the perfectly measured ending, a spine-chilling air of brilliance engulfs the theater. This incredibly tantaliz­ing dive into the heart of insanity and the subconscious becomes more ingenious as it unravels, and once solved, all that is left is the overwhelming feeling that what Mr. Lynch has created is so beyond perfect, it's downright scary. 
1 (tie) No Country For Old Men: The Coen brothers' jaw­dropping nco-western veiled as a thriller brilliantly blends all of the themes that the Coen's have played around with ever since their directorial debut in "Blood Simple". Both awe· inspiring in a "Popcorn movie" sense and undeniably tri­umphant in an "Oscar season movie" sense, this adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel about life, death, and the loss of innocence, is incredibly measured and flawless from head to toe.

wrong time when he stumbles across a satchel filled with $2 million is enough to send shivers down even Hannibal Lecter's back. Simply put, with "No Country for Old Men" the Coen brothers have not only managed to top "Fargo", but

Any listing of "classic" films, particularly if they were released in the last 10 years, is immediately ripe for debate. Subjectivity can take precedence over real criticism, as can the lack, by default, of historical perspective. Can a film qualify for classic sta­tus ifit's still making money at the box office? What will we think in five, 10, even 20 years of "the next big thing?" Who knows who will still be relevant to our cinema sensibilities in a genera­tion? 
That being said, trying to piece together an American fllm canon for the new millennium is an admirable effort, albeit a complicated one. Precluding any film released in 2008 (why judge a year when it isn't even over yet?), as well as any foreign films -which deserve their own countdown -here is an admit­tedly tentative list offlve classic films since 2000. 
Big Fish (2003): Steeped in Southern Gothic sensibilities, yet with a wry sense of humor, wide-eyed wonder and a mythic backbone, "Big Fish" is arguably Tim Burton's strongest film since 2000. A father-son relationship told in memories and tall tales, "Big Fish" is a joy to watch and.experience. The film shines, sometimes literally, as it tracks Edward Bloom (Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney) through his storied life. His son, Will (Billy Crudup) is grappling with his father's legend, hoping to find the truth of the enigmatic man who raised him. The film's sense of the unexpected, delight in small moments, and sweeping emo­tional strength is pitch-perfect. 
Brokeback Mountain (2005): It's been called revolutionary. Groundbreaking. Historic, even. But what "Brokeback Mountain" really is, at its heart, is simply a love story. It is a tough, powerful love story, told by director Ang Lee with skill and sensitivity. It would be easy to see a film like "Brokeback Mountain" falter in the hands of a lesser filmmaker. The story could be sensational­ized, the subject handled with clumsiness or prejudice. But it wasn't; the film's leads, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, were both compelling, complex characters in their own right, turning something "sensational" into something tragically ordinary. Truly an instant standard. 
Monsters, Inc. (2001): You might think that "Finding Nemo" is a more likely choice among the Disney/Pixar film canon. Sure, the heartwarming tale of a lost clown flsh with a malformed fin is compelling, and the voice talent (Albert Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres) is top-notch. Still, its 2001 predecessor, "Monsters, Inc," is more deserving of a top spot. The concept is witty and charming, and the film's style is at times angular and artistic, <md furry-soft with blue and purple spots. Heartwarming, but never cheesy -a tricky balance -funny, sweet and just right. 
Donnie Darko (2001): When was the last time you saw a "teen" film that discussed, among other things, philosophy, family, the search for God, psychology, time-traveling, moral ambiguity and demonic rabbits? This 2001 cult classic starring Gyllenhaal is a touchstone for the thinking filmgoer. With a skilled ensemble cast that includes Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jena Malone, Noah Wylie, Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze, the film is remarkable in its scope and haunting in its style and tone. It raises questions with­out answers, and almost requires a second, if not a third, viewing to try and grapple with its complexities. 
Sideways (2004): Based on a Rex Pickett novel, "Sideways" is an existential road trip with a top-notch wine palate and an endearing sweetness at the heart of its cynicism. Miles (Paul Giamatti, excellent as always) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church) are touring California wine country before Jack settles down and gets married. The pair meet two women, Stephanie (Sandra Oh, "Grey's Anatomy") and Maya (Vrrginia Madsen), and alternately bicker and bond as they taste wine after wine after wine. Madsen won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for this film, and her performance is a humble anchor for Giamatti's neu­rotic Miles. See "Sideways." Relax, maybe with a glass of wine, and enjoy one of the funniest character studies to come out of American film in years.

"Our team is a paragon of unity and community," he said. "I guess you could liken us unto onesie pajamas, with every part flowing into the next and no part superior. In other words, it was a total team victory" 
McGlinn 14, Pasquerilla West 12 
McGlinn has certainly had a flair for the dramatic this sea­son, and Sunday was no differ­ent, as it came back to defeat Pasquerilla West. 
PW (1-1-2) dominated the first half of play. Its defense was strong and forced several three­and-outs against a McGlinn (3­
1) offense that could not con­vert drives into points. 
Even when quarterback Sarah deGroot unleashed a 50­yard bomb that was reeled in for a completion on diving catch, the McGlinn offense could not finish the drive. 
Leading 6-0 at the half, PW continued to dominate as its defense forced another inter­ception. The Purple Weasels took advantage of the opportu­nity. and scored another touch­down on the quick legs and long passes of captain Cara Davies. Their attempt at the extra point failed, putting them up 12-0. 
However, this was the last time PW would score. 
McGlinn took over on offense. On a key third down play, deGroot completed a pass to continue the drive. The re-ener­gized offense finally finished a drive, running in a touchdown almost 30 yards. The two-point conversion was successful. The Shamrocks now trailed by four. 
Minutes later, on another bomb by deGroot that easily f1oated into the hands of her receiver, the Shamrocks scored again, taking the lead for the first time all game with time running out for PW. 
A tight McGlinn defense held the two-point lead for the last minutes, locking up the victory and handing PW its first loss of the season. 
"This is exactly the momen­tum we need right now," said captain Sarah deGroot. "The team has really meshed." 
This is the second game in a row that McGlinn has come from behind to win in the sec­ond half. 
"The girls never doubt them­selves," McGlinn coach Craig Wiborg said. "We know we have good players." 
In addition to 
However, the second half was all Walsh. 
The Wild Women scored a touchdown but missed the extra point to bring the seore to 21­
13. The Walsh defense then held Breen-Phillips offense, allowing the Wild Women to score yet another touchdown and bring the score to 21-19 after a missed 2-point conver­sion. 
With three minutes left in the game, Walsh's defense played aggressively and, thanks to a sack by Alexa Doyle, forced the Babes' offense to punt. Walsh had 21 seconds left to score

Jonny Gomes, center, leads the Tampa Bay celebration after the Rays' first postseason series victory in fran­chise history after the Rays beat the Chicago White Sox in Game 4 of the ALDS 6-2 Monday. 
Rays advancetoALCSoverChiSox 
Associated Press 

CHICAGO-B.J. Upton and these Tampa Bay Rays are headed home -to get ready for the American League championship series. 
Worst in the majors last year, the Rays will play for a spot in the World Series after finishing off the Chicago White Sox 6-2 Monday in Game 4 of the AL playoffs. 
Ray-markable! 
Upton homered twice, Andy Sonnanstine pitched a solid 5 2-3 innings and manager Joe Maddon's surprising Rays won 3-1 in the best-of-five series ­their first trip to the post­season. Next up, the Boston Red Sox or the Los Angeles Angels starting Friday. 
"We feel like we belong and it's showing right now," Upton said. 
After staving off elimina­tion several times and win­ning a tiebreaker for the AL Central title, the White Sox were finally knocked out. 
The loss dashed Chicago's hope for a cham­pionship -days ago, local fans were thinking the Cubs and White Sox might meet in a Windy City Classic. But the Cubs got swept by the Dodgers and now both teams are done. 
Upton, the game's second batter, homered to left-cen­ter to put the Rays ahead. He went deep again in the third, driving a full-count pitch from Gavin floyd to center, and the confident Rays had a two-run cush­ion. 
Tampa Bay, which never won more than 70 games during its 10 previous sea­sons, went from 96 losses last year to 97 wins and passed the big-spending Red Sox and New York Yankees in the AL East. 
"It's a gratifying moment for all of us," Maddon said. 
No longer bedeviled, the Rays won all year with young talent and improved pitching. Sonnanstine, who pitched a three-hit shutout against the White Sox at Tropicana Field in April, reversed a late-season slide that saw him go winless in his fmal seven starts. 
He allowed two runs and three hits before J.P Howell relieved. Grant Balfour completed the four-hitter, striking out midseason addition Ken Griffey Jr. to end it. 
Upton, who hit only nine homers in 531 at-bats dur­ing the regular season, also homered in Sunday's 5-3 loss. Benched by Maddon during the season for not hustling, the talented 24­year-old's power display came against a team that relied on homers all year and led the majors in long balls. 

IN BRIEF Weeks has surgery to 
repair cartilage 10 knee 
MILWAUKEE -Brewers second baseman Rickie Weeks had surgery Monday to repair a cartilage tear in his left knee and is expected to be ready for spring training. 
Weeks had part of the damaged meniscus removed by team physician Dr. William Raasch. Weeks will begin rehabilitation at home this week. 
A first-round draft pick by Milwaukee in 2003, Weeks hit .234 with 14 homers and 46 RBis in 129 games in his fifth season. Weeks slumped and spent most of September in a reserve role to veteran Ray Durham. 
Weeks was injured on Saturday night in Game 3 against Philadelphia when he jammed his knee running out a hard-hit grounder and got tangled up with first baseman Ryan I Ioward. 
Weeks was removed from the post­season roster and finished the series 0­for-4. 
Lowell removed from 
roster with hip strain 
BOSTON -Third baseman Mike Lowell was remove from Boston's first-round postseason roster on Monday because of a right hip strain. 
He would be ineligible to play in the AL championship series if the Red Sox advance past their first-round opponent, the Los Angeles Angels. 
Last year's World Series MVP, who also has a torn labrum in his right hip, was replaced on the active roster by infielder Gil Velazquez, who made his major league debut on Sept. 25. 
Lowell was 0-for-8 in two games during the series against the Angels. 
The Red Sox led the series 2-1 after the Angels won 5-4 win in 12 innings Sunday night. Lowell walked in the 1Oth inning and Alex Cora pinch ran for him. 
Westbrook questionable
with two broken ribs 
PHILADELPHIA -All-Pro running back Brian Westbrook broke two ribs in the Eagles' 23-17 loss to Washington on Sunday, though he stayed in and finished the game. 
Westbrook missed one game with an ankle injury, but it's too early to know if his latest injury will keep him out of Sunday's game at San francisco. 
"We just have to see," coach Andy Reid said Monday. "We have to see how it all works out and exactly the pain level there. Right now, he's very sore, so we'll see how things go over the next few days." 
Westbrook had 84 total yards against the Redskins. He leads the Eagles with 194 yards rushing and has six touch­downs, including two receiving.

Irish slutnp to bottotn of pack after two rounds 
By MICHAEL BLASCO 
Sports Writer 

Despite home-field advantage and a budding crop of young tal­ent, Notre Dame's two squads slumped to last and second-to-last place at the end of two rounds at the third annual Fighting Irish Gridiron Classic. 
The 'N team sits in 15th place with a 48-over par 608, while the Irish 'B' team is in dead last with a 49-over 609. a single stroke behind its brethren. 
At the top of the leaderboard, No. 47 Minnesota (579) cummtly holds a one-stroke lead over No. 4 Arkansas (580), while No. 41 Michigan State and No. 3 Lamar arn in shouting distance of the lead aller a solid day of action at Notro Dame's par 70, 7,023-yard Warren Golf Course. 
Heading into play, Irish head coach Jim Kubinski knew that his young team would be facing an uphill battle this week, eonsidnring the competition. 
"llosting so many great teams this weP.k ... we need to play smart golf out there, maybe beyond our experience level at this point," Kubinski said. "We can do it, though. If we play intelligently and allow our talent to come out, there's no rea<>on why we can't bn in the mix on Tuesday afternoon." 
Sophomore Jell' Chen leads the Notre Dame ellort with a 1 0-ovnr 150 through two rounds, good enough for 35th overall. After an error-filled opening round in which he carded an 8-over 78, including three bogies and two double-bogies on the back nine, Chen fired a 2-over 72 in his sec­ond round to bounce back. 
This wonk, Kubinski singled out Chen in parti<:ular as an examph~ of the success of the youth move­ment in the Irish program. 
"lie has played incredibly well this season aflnr not making our starting lineup as a frnshman," Kubinski said. ''I'm as proud of the way he handled himsnlf when he didn't get the call llast year] as I have been with his reeent solid play." 
Junior Doug Fortner, coming oil" a sixth-placf~ finish at last week's Saint Mary's (California) Invitational, trails Chen by a hair, shooting an 11-over 151 to end up 38th overall. Fortner's 75 and 76 were marked by erratic play in which he recorded a team-leading lour birdies against eleven bog<~ys and two double bogeys. 
Sophomore Connor Alan-Lee earded a 12-over 152 (46th over­all), while fellow sophomore Dustin Zhang turned in a disap­pointing 159 to linish Monday in 76th place. Freshman Max Scodro's 21-over Hll (79th overall) rounded out the Notrn Dame 'A' squad. 
For the Irish 'B' tnam, junior Olavo Batista and freshman Tom Usher !wad into thn third row1d in 46th place, each with 12-over 152s. Sophomore Tyh~r Hock's 153 landed him in s:kd placn, while junior Carlos Santos-Ocampo shot a 14-over 154. 
Fn~shman Chris Walker finished alongside fellow underdassman Seodro with a 21-over 161. 
Play resumes this morning, with the lin~tl round beginning at the first and 10th holes at 8:20a.m. at Notre Dame's Warren Golf Course.

Willingha111's job in jeopardy 
Associated Press 
SEATTLE -Matters only continue to get worse for Washington and coach Tyrone Willingham. 
The losing atmosphere has only increased around a team that is: 
-Starting 0-5 for the first time in 39 years. 
-One of only two winless Bowl Subdivision teams in the country. 
-Owner of the longest current losing streak of any team in the FBS: seven straight dating back to last season, thanks to Army's win over Tulane last weekend. 
-Without star quarter­back Jake Locker, after he broke his thumb trying to be the lead blocker on a reverse. 
-The loser of three games this year by 30 or more points, including Saturday's 48-14 drubbing at the hands of Arizona. 
It's not pretty. 
In a rare positive, the II uskies did finally record a sack against the Wildcats, becoming the final team in the country to accomplish the feat. That was about the only bit of good news to come out of the Huskies' loss in the desert on Saturday. 
"They say in life that win­ning is a habit, but also los­ing is a habit, and we have to make sure those things don't slip in there, that our guys can get back off the mat, get their (energy) up, and con­centrate and focus and do the things you have to do to win," Willingham said on Monday. "That's important, we have to do that." 
While the long-term prog­nosis for Willingham's future employment as Washington's head coach continues to get darker with each loss, his short-term future appears secure. Athletic director Scott Woodward told reporters on the sidelines after Saturday's game that despite the lopsided score and 0-5 start he had no intentions of making an in­season move to fire Willingham. While not happy with the losing direction of the program, Woodward said his approach would be giving Willingham the entire season before deciding whether to kee.p Willingham around for the final year of his contract. 
If there was a time to make such a transition, it would be this week with the Huskies having their second weekend off before hosting Oregon State on Oct. 18. 
Woodward wasn't the only one making compelling state­ments after Saturday's loss. Perhaps one of the harshest indictments of the Huskies came from Arizona running 
back  Nic  Grigsby,  who  
"sensed  (the  Huskies  
defense)  were  quitting  

already" late in the first half of Saturday's romp. 
Willingham defended his beleaguered defense on Monday, a unit allowing nearly 500 yards of offense per game, well above the 446 yards Washington allowed last year -the worst mark in school history and one that cost Kent Baer his job as defensive coordi­nator. 
"No, I don't think so. I think that's depending on 
how you take that comment and how you take those words and interpret them," Willingham said of Grigsby's comment. "But I think our kids kept playing, kept try­ing. We just were not suc­cessful, but I do not think our kids quit." 
Washington and North Texas are the only FBS teams without victories, and the Huskies have just two in their last 16 games. 
In Washington's defense, the combined records of its five opponents this season is 22-6, but the lack of compet­itiveness has provided a stark realization of just how far the Huskies are from returning to being the elite program that went without a losing season from 1977­2003. Washington is being outscored 210-93, including 110-35 in the first and third quarters. 
The struggles are also hav­ing an impact on recruiting. The top Washington state recruit last week pulled back his oral commitment to the Huskies, and most recruiting services have Washington with only a handful of com­mitments nearly halfway through the fall. 
There are some still hold­ing onto hope for a respectable turnaround. 
"Losing it tough. It hurts. But I've learned a lot from my head coach. He puts it behind him. He's a fighter and I came here because of him," Washington quarter­back Ronnie Fouch said. "It's hard to lose but we've got to keep fighting and we've got some more games left to put something together."

NCAA FOOTBALL 
Muschamp has Longhorns rolling 
Associated Press 
AUSTIN, Texas -The infat­uation began when Will. Muschamp was hired at Texas. 
The love affair began with the blood. 
It's taken five games for Muschamp to go from just the latest Texas defensive coordi­
·nator -the fifth in six years 
to cult hero among Longhorns fans mesmerized by the way he walks, talks, 
. yells ... and bleeds. His. defense looks good too. The No. 5 Longhorns (5-0, 1­0 Big 12) are rated No. 6 nationally in scoring defense going into Saturday's game against No. 1 Oklahoma (5-0, 1-0) in Dallas and vastly improved over last year. "Stats are for losers," Muschamp said after Texas whipped Colorado 38-14. "I like winning games." Bravado like that has pleased has pleased Texas 
butted him. Of course Muschamp wasn't wearing a helmet and got the worst of the contact. 
When he's not bleeding, Muschamp prowls on the side­lines, yelling at bad plays and chest bumping and head slap­ping players after good ones. 
"That's just me," Muschamp said. "I can't change who I am. I enjoy being in the arena." 
Off the field, he can look bookish and boyish behind his eyeglasses and hairstyle that sort of parts on the right side of his head. He sets up camp in the film room to study opponents and Brown joked that Muschamp may sleep there this week. 
"Whatever it takes to win," Muschamp said with an imp­ish grin. 
The defense has delivered what the Longhorns needed the first five games. Texas has surrendered just five touch­

coordinator 
in January with a stellar resume including a national champi­onship with LSU in 2003, a season as assistant head coach for the Miami Dolphins and two seasons at Auburn where he had one of the top defenses in the country. 
For all of that, Muschamp was perhaps best known to Texas fans as the coach caught on video swearing and whooping it up with Auburn players after a big play in a clip that became a YouTube sensation. 
Texas coach Mack Brown hired Muschamp to rescue his sagging defense, paying him $425,000 a year, although it's widely expected he'll soon be offered a head coaching job somewhere. 
Muschamp's first decree was that he'd put the best 11 play­ers on the field regardless of seniority and experience. And then came the blood. 
In Texas' first game against Florida Atlantic, Owls coach Howard Schnellenberger had riled things up by suggesting the Longhorns weren't very tough. 
Things were still close in the first quarter when Muschamp, upset by a broken assignment in pass coverage, apparently ripped off his headset with such a violent motion that part of it tore open a cut on his left cheek. A long line of blood dripped to his chin. Muschamp ignored the distraction and kept on coaching. Photographs of the bloody scene quickly hit the Internet. 
"The man is fiery," said defensive end Brian Orakpo, who leads the Longhorns with seven of their 19 sacks. "He acted like it wasn't even there. He kept coaching, even with blood all over his face." 
It wasn't the first time Muschamp drew blood. In practice, he once grabbed a players' facemask and head-
safety. -­

"Watching them play, you can tell that the effort's there, you can tell they're disciplined in what their responsibilities are and they mix things up well," Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops said. "Will has definitely had an impact there. It's obvious." 
But Texas' hasn't played a team like Oklahoma. The Sooners are trouncing oppo­nents with a fast, no-huddle offense that is piling up points in a hurry. 
Texas has played its best in the second half of games while the Sooners have usu­ally put away teams in the first two quarters. Oklahoma has outscored opponents 168-30 in the first half and quarterback Sam Bradford is sure to test the young Texas safeties from the start. 
The secondary remains' Texas soft spot. The Longhorns may not give up many points, but they still give up a lot of yards and rank No. 96 in pass defense with only two interceptions. Muschamp insists he only cares about points. 
Saturday's Texas-OU game will be Muschamp's first and the emotions surrounding the rivalry could spark some real fireworks. Muschamp beat the Sooners for the 2003 BCS championship when he was with LSU, but that Sugar Bowl was played before what most would con­sider a home crowd for the Tigers. 
The Texas-Oklahoma rival­ry tends to turn the Cotton Bowl into a swirling caul­dron of emotions and things can get pretty nasty with 92,000 fans split down the middle at the 50-yard line. 
"At first, we weren't used to him," Orakpo said. "But he's the first person out there chest-bumping, slap­ping helmets. We love it."

back and wide receiver play led to four touchdowns, two of which came within two minutes of each other. Most of its scoring drives were the results of short passes followed by long runs afterwards. 
The Phoxes' defense, however, was equally impressive, forcing three interceptions, one of which came on a Lewis drive that would've tied the game. 
The Chicks (0-4) struck early with an interception return for a touchdown by captain Kristie Shushinsky, but could not gener­ate much offense afterwards. 
Despite the loss, Shushinsky recognized her team's improve­ment throughout the season. 
"We did a really good job of moving the ball downfield," Shushinsky said. 
Coach Perry Schumaker added: "We had some great plays and amazing catches," he said. "We just need to learn how to put everything together". 
Despite its inability to make the playoffs, Lewis is approach­ing these games with the same tenacity as they have all season. 
"We're keeping our heads high and aren't rolling over for anybody," Schumaker said.

Belles prepare for hon1e clash with Hope 
By PAT STYNES Sports Writer 
After dropping a tough loss to Alma on the road last Friday, the Saint Mary's volleyball team will look to bounce back at home tonight at 7 p.m. against Hope college. The Belles are 12­6 overall, 5-4 in conference play and will need a win to stay above .500 in the MIAA. 
Pulling off a win against Hope College, however, will be quite difficult for the Saint Mary's squad. Hope is an impressive 18-3 on the year, is undefeated in conference play and the record is certainly not a fluke. Out of nine conference matches, Hope has dropped a mere three sets -that is an astonishing 90 percent set winning percentage. And while Hope is undefeated at home, they are equally impres­sive on the road, their only loss coming against Wittenberg way back in September. Hope cap­tain senior Nora Slenk has 259 kills, with a solid .292 conver­sion percentage. 
The Belles will have a tough time dealing with both the offensive and the defensive fronts of Hope College. While junior Lorna Slupczynski and senior Kaela Hellmann have been very impressive on the offensive side of the ball, con­tributing 222 and 192 kills respectively, they will have a dif­ficult job of finding kills, as Hope is averaging 17.36 kills a game, limiting their opponents to a paltry 3.85 kills a game, their defensive efforts spear­headed by Senior Meghan Winer's 346 digs. 
Overall it will be a tough game for the St. Mary's, as Hope College is stringing together a truly dominant performance in both conference and out of con­ference play. However do not count out the Belles at home, as aside from their first September 2nd home match, they are undefeated at St. Mary's.

lyons vs. Pasquerilla West 
Thank..<; to a few big wins includ­ing a victory over last year's champion, Lyons has already dinched a playoff spot heading into Tuesday's game against Pasquerilla West. 
For PW (1-0-2), making the playolls will be a difficult task that will cnrtainly require wins as opposed to more ties. Last week's disappointing tie against Howard didn't slam the door on the Purple Wea.sPb playofl' hopes, but it defi­nitely didn't help their cause.

Charlie Weis said he'd novel' seen his team as jacked up before a game as before Stanford. That excite­ment needfld to transfer, not just into the first half but also throughout the whole game. 
But it didn't. Two Irish drives netted negative yards in the second half, and two others gained less than 10. The most telling play, howev­er, happened near the end of the fourth quarter. With fourth down and two chain links to go, the line couldn't dig in enough to get James Aldridge past the sticks. That first down ices the game; a field goal, as we saw previ­ously, was out of the question, so Notre Dame needed to con­vert.

combining to form a very well rounded team filled to the brim with talent. 
If PW is to win this game, it'll have to establish more consistency on offense while maintaining what has thus far been a stellar defense. Jordan Johnson will lead a pass rush that has thus far been more than able to put quarter­backs in pressure situations, which have led to turnovers and sacks. 
Today's game pits Lyons, a team pumped and anxious to prove itself amongst the league's best, against PW, a team desperate for another win as they try to find their way into the playoffs. While it may seem as though PW will play with a heightened level of intensity that Lyons, in its current position of having already clinched a playoff' berth, cannot match, Lyons should not be overlooked, for the Lions are just as actively pursuing a win. 
"We've bmm playing with a lot of 
fourth-and-short conversion, and if it eouldn't get it then, against Stanford. when it came into the game pumped up, that doesn't bode well for the rush game. 
Defensively, Notre Dame relented in the second half as well. It intercepted three passes in the first half but none in the second. Two of Stanford's three drives in the fourth quarter, not counting the one-play drive to end the game, resulted in touch­downs. Again, no biggie in this game, but that's not the point. 
because we're out thern to prove that we're no fluke," Lyons coach Matt Gelchion said. 
Pasquerilla East vs. Cavanaugh 
For Pasquerilla East and Cavanaugh so far this season, it has been a tale of two different teams. 
Going into their matchup at 8 
p.m. tonight at Riehle Fields, the Chaos are 2-1-1 while the Pyros are 0-4. Cavanaugh is coming off its first loss of the season, a tough defeat to Lyons, but still can't be counted out as a threat to defend their championship season from last year. 
The Pyros, on the other hand, have lost their last three games all by less than a touchdown. 
"We've been very close but not quite there the last few games," captain Tara Pillai said. "It's all about consistency because we have signs of being a good team but we just haven't put it all together." 
Someday, perhaps if the offensn has an off day, the Irish defense will stand in between an opponent and a victory, and they'll need to play at the level they're capa­ble of for the entire game. 
I have full confidence in the abilities of the team on both sides of the ball. The Irish moved tho ball well on offense and kept Stanford under control on defense, and most importantly, they won the game. But they had the potential to dabber Stanford, to prove to any remaining doubters that they've tude as they attempt to recover from their Lirst lost of the season last week. 
"Cavanaugh's !,Tfeatest strength year in and year out is that our love for flag football make's Palin's and Biden's love for Israel pale in comparison," senior quarterback and captain Katie Dunn said. "And like them, we are just trying to continue the tradition." 
The Pyros are remaining opti­mistic despite a tough start to the season.? 
"We know we are very close to getting that elusive win," Pillai said. "Hopefully it all comes together tomorrow."? 
Cavanaugh is hoping to captum another win before the playofl's with strong senior leadership from middle linebacker Megan Ladrie

Notre Dame must seize the opportunities to control games when they come, and in so doing prove they can do something else I remember the Wings doing -buckling down when needed.

Morrissey stays perfect vvith victory over vvinless Duncan

Morrissey 16, Duncan 6 
Aftnr the first hall'. with Morrissey leading 13-0, Sunday's game looked like more of' thn same from l>uiH~an, who had yet to score on thn snason. 
llowevm. with just under two minutes lnft in the gamn, llighlander widn rnceiver Mike Kearney had a brnakaway run to scorn Duncan's (0-3) first touchdown of the year. 

Highlander captain Garrett Burke's prediction that Kearney "would just tear it up on the field," dnfinitely held trun on Sunday, as the senior sparked Duncan's of'f'ensive drives with several great catch­es. Overall, though, the llighlander offensive could not gain signilicant yardage, giving up interceptions and a safety to the Morrissey (2-0) defense. 
On the other side of the ball, the Duncan defense showed potential when it held off the Manorite offense at the goal line late in the third quarter, forcing a change of possession. 
The line was hitting hard, ineluding some great tackles by Highlander freshman Brett Leahy. 
Offensively, Morrissey was forced to play without its start­ing right tackle, who is cur­rently recovering from a sprained ankle injury. 
"We definitely saw the effects of losing him for today's game," Manorite captain Joe McBrayer said. "But he will be ready for next week." 
Quarterback McBrayer con­nected consistently with junior Daniel Reimer for a touchdown at the end of the second quar­ter. Heimer emerged as a key player in Sunday's game and will be a continued force on the Manorite offensive. 
Running for Morrissey was Danny Deveny, who set up scoring opportunities in the third quarter, and rushed for the extra point at the end of the second. 
Undefeated Morrissey is already focusing on its next game. 
"If pnople don't get hurt, we have the potential to do well in the regular season and in the playoffs," said McBrayer.

FOOTBALL COMMENTARY 

Finishing strong 
Squad needs to finish games to reach elite 
I spent a good portion of my childhood growing up outside I>ntroit. 


whnre I got the chancn to watch the Hnd Wings play nvnry night. It was tough. bncausn I was a 

Hangers Bill Brink fan, but at lnast it was good boekny. I was at Game Four of the I 1J97 Stanley Cup Finals and saw tlwm win a cup. and while my New York fanhood wouldn't let me root for them. it was a special nxperi­encn. 
What I noticed about them. however, was their tendency to shut down when they had 
see FINISH/page 20 half miscue that led to a Fisher touchdown and took down the Groen Wave 12-6. 
The Green Wave (0-3) offense struggled for much of the game, failing to sustain a drive long enough to end tlwir streak of three games without scoring more than one touchdown. The Fisher defense meanwhile maintained a bend-but-do-not­break mindset, rarely giving up a long gain. 
But St. Ed's, with its effective short passing game out of a shotgun set, was able to string together long scoring drives.

"We nend our oll'ense to do a bnttnr job of being more consis­tnnt," tnam mptain Kayla Bishop said. "We're going to look to our receivers to make more catches and have fewer droppnd balls." 

Bishop said that too many droppnd balls were key in a disap­pointing tie last Thursday against Pasqunrilla West. 
She is eonfident, though, that wide receiver Kristen JefJ'ries and running back Beth Gribble each have the ability to steady the Ducks' o!Jicmse.
