ND announces tuition increase 
By MEGHANNE DOWNES 
News Editor 
University officials announced Monday tuition for lhe next acade­mic year will increase by 6.5 per­cent bringing the total cost, includ­ing room and board, to $34,100. 
Despite the additional revenue from lhe tuition increase, planned budget cuts will still occur but financial aid will not be affected, according to Matt Storin, a spokesman for the University. 
"Because of economic condi­tions in the nation as a whole and how they affect us as a unit, it will be a challenge to continually fund financial aid at the same level although we hope to do so," Storin said. 
Next year's tuition cost marks a significant increase over previous years when the increase had been under five percent, said Storin. 
"The tuition is part of the gener­al revenue that makes up for the loss of interest on the endowment and any possible drop-ofls in con­tributions," he said. 
However, Storin said that the University intends to wremain competitive and come in below where [the tuition levels of] other elite schools are."

Storin explained that though economic difficulties were affect­ing the University's financial sta­tus, he expected that Notre Dame would still provide the same level of financial aid as previous years. 
"We have increased financial aid in recent years so it is possible now to assure any students who [are] admitted that they would have sufficient funds to attend Notre Dame," Storin said. 
University President Father Edward Malloy said that changes made to financial aid in recent years would help sustain the University through the economic downturn. 
"Not only do we admit studen1s regardless of ability to pay, but we also meet the full demonstrated financial need of all our students and increasingly we have replaced loans with scholarships in our financial aid packages," Malloy said. "Faced with the financial challenges of the moment, we've fashioned a plan that makes the necessary hard choices wWJe still allowing us to maintain our com­mitment to excellence in the acad­emic and student life of the University." 
Parents were informed of the increase in a letter sent last week from Malloy.

"The tyrant will soon be gone," vowed Bush, comman­der in chief of 250,000 U.S. troops poised to strike. 
Bush set a course for war without U.N. backing after months of futilely trying to per­suade Saddam to disarm. In an address televised worldwide, he spoke to several audiences at once, starting with the American public and skeptical allies and including Saddam.

Springbreak in New York 
Spring break is over and we are starting the downhill slide into the summer and the beginning of the next year. However we still have memories to reflect upon, from sit­
ting on the beach  
to going to Big  Chris Orenchuk  
East basketball  
tournaments. Spring break has io be my  Lab Technician  
favorite break of  

the entire school year except for summer break, of course. I believe that spring break is, of course. the most needed break. It gives all of us students the well-needed rest that we all deserve. 
My spring break was spent in the wonderful city of New York. New York gives you many opportunities from shopping on 5th Avenue to Central Park. New York most likely has everything that you could ever want. 
However, it is not quite the spring break location that we all wanted. [ made the best of the situation and enjoyed the many things that New York had to offer. This included get­ting lectured by the cops outside of Madison Square Garden for trying to buy tickets to Michael Jordan's last game to buying fake Oakley's. Buying fake Oakley's probably had to be my most favorite memory from spring break. 
The best part of New York has to be the street vendors who try to sell you Oakley's and Rolexes at every street corner. It really embodies the true American spirit and free enter­prise. 
My spring break took on a new pretense when I decided that l did need a fake Rolex. So as I strolled past a street vendor who asked "Rolex?," I said, "Yes." After this we haggled on the price for a minute and I finally worked him down to $15. For that amount even a cheap watch is fine. 
This is where this adventure took an interesting turn. After going to a location where the cops couldn't see us. I proceeded to look over the selection that the street vendor had provided and to my interest the watches were not fake Rolexes but very nice watches of lesser brands, such as Geneva and Citizen. 
So as I perused the selection. it came to my realization that most likely these watches were stolen. At this point, I got scared that the cops would bust us, so I said, "No thanks" and moved on. However, I very much still wanted to purchase a fake Rolex more than ever. 
This phase passed me and I moved on to buying fake Oakley's. This proved to be a much more enjoyable purchase. I approached another vendor and haggled with him about the price till we settled on $5. At this point he opened up his trash bag and I got to select which sun­glasses I wanted. This purchase led to me to the true meaning of spring break -lllegal activity.

Students respond to possible w-ar in Iraq 
By MATT BRAMANTI 
News Writer 
Students responded Monday night to President Bush's address to the nation. which gave Saddam Hussein 48 hours to leave Iraq or face military action. 
The president's speech drew mixed reactions among Notre Dame students and some praised the president's remarks as necessary and prudent. 
"You could see this coming for a while now ... but I think it's what needs to be done," said freshman Nick Stahlschmidt. 
However, not everyone agreed that military action was the best way to resolve the situation in Iraq. Freshman Samantha Raneri described the ultimatum as "completely unreasonable," and said that further diplo­macy might bring about a peaceful solution. "I think we could do more for peace," she said. 
Not all students expected that Bush would take such a hard-line stance in his address. Freshman Courtney Campbell called the remarks "alarming" and felt that the United States had not made the case for war and that the American military might eventually be overcommitted in Iraq. 

"I think we're biting off more than we can chew," Campbell said. 
Several students comment­ed favorably on the manner and tone of Bush's speech. 
"Bush clearly set out his objectives and he made it clear he's al'ler the govern­ment of Iraq, not the people," said junior Chris Edwards. 
Near the end of his address. Bush spoke directly to the Iraqi people and said that the United States wanted to free them from an oppres­sive regime. 
Even students opposed to 
U.S. military action in Iraq characterized the president's address as clear and deci­sive. 
"I thought he was well-spo­ken, but I see more evil com­ing out of this than good," said freshman Mark Szczuka. 
rreshman Kathy Peterson agreed, saying, "Bush has good intentions about pro­tecting the American people. I thought [the speech! was sincerely delivered."

Group travels to Mexico for retreat 
By MEGAN O'NEIL 
New, Writer 
During spring break, a group of Saint Mary's students and staff trav­eled to Mexico to participate in a spiritual development retreat. 
Students Mary Braun, Sheila Egts, Sheila Marie Guerrettaz, Julianna Harman, Megan Kennedy and Mary Watrobka, along with Sister Linda Kors, director of the Spes Unica Resources Volunteer Center, Sister Kathleen Dolphin, director of the Center for Spirituality and Marcia Good Maust, fellow at the Center for Womens Intercultural Leadership, participated in the trip which was sponsored by the SURV Center. 
"I told myself when I came here that I would get involved ... and this was a really great opportunity to experience a different culture," said Kennedy. 
Hosted by Daughters of the Holy Spirit, the travelers stayed at a retreat center in Cuernavaca, Mexico, where they experienced Mexican culture and poverty. 
"I don't think that most people have seen that type of poverty and it is just really shocking." Kennedy said. 
The group had the opportunity to visit the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City, as well as the sight where Mary is believed to have appeared as Our Lady of Guadalupe, the patron saint of Mexico. 
"Almost every house has at least one picture of [Our Lady of] Guadalupe. You can find her every­where," said Kors. 
One of the main events of the 1rip involved a one hour hike to Tlamacazopa, a Mexican village located in the Andes Mountains. 
"I just realized that they have so much less than we do but they are so much more devote. It was truly motivating," said Kennedy.

U.N. tells weapons inspectors to evacuate Iraq 
As,ociateJ Press 
B/\GIIDAD 

The United Nations ordered its weapons inspectors out of Iraq on Monday, widening the stream of diplomats and foreign journal­ists heading for the exits before any shooting starts. 
Defiant to the end, Saddam Hussein gave no sign of heeding President Bush's demands that he step down within 48 hours, or race war. lie warned that American forces will !ind an Iraqi lighter ready to die for his coun­try "behind every rock, tree and wall." 
But he made a last-minute bid to avert war, admitting that Iraq had once possessed weapons of mass destruction to defend itself from Iran and Israel -but insist­ing that it no longer has them. 
"We arc not weapons collec­tors," the official Iraqi News Agency quoted him as telling Tunisian Foreign Minister Habib Ben Yahia, who was visiting Baghdad in a last-minute quest to avert war. 
"When Saddam Hussein says he has no weapons of mass destruction, he means what he says," Saddam said. 
His admissions were pushed aside, as President Bush set the countdown clock for war. "The tyrant will soon be gone," Bush said, either by Saddam's own choice to leave or by force. Saddam and his sons must leave Iraq within 48 hours, Bush said. 
In advance of the speech, Iraqi Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said Saddam wouldn't leave. "He will stay in place like a solid rock," he told Qatar-based television broadcast­er Al-Jazeera in an interview Monday. 
Baghdad residents prepared for the worst, llooding markets to stock up on food. lining up for gas and bread and taping their windows for fear of flying glass from U.S. bombs. Store owners moved their merchandise to the relative safety of warehouses, fearing bombs and looting if a war starts. 
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan announced that he was ordering all U.N. staff out of Iraq, including 156 inspectors and support staff, humanitarian workers and U.N. observers monitoring the Iraqi-Kuwait bor­der. 

Homeland Security raises alert level to high after Bush speech 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

Worried that war in Iraq could lead to terrorist reprisals at home, the Department of Homeland Security raised the terror alert Monday to orange, indicating a high risk of attacks, and implemented enhanced security measures nationwide. 
"Operation Liberty Shield" was announced just as President George W. Bush com­pleted his speech giving Saddam Hussein 48 hours to leave Iraq. 
The homeland security plan includes more Border Patrol officers, stepped-up patrols at seaports, airports and nuclear power plants, and increased safeguards over the nation's food supply. 
Homeland Security Secretary Tom Hidge also called on gover­nors to deploy National Guard troops or extra state police to protect bridges and other key infrastructures. 
The terror alert was raised from yellow. or elevated, to orange, the second-highest level on a five-color scale. Counterterrorism officials said the decision was based on threats from al-Qaida, Iraqi operatives and freelance terror­ists. 
"A large volume of reporting across a range of sources, some of which are highly reliable, indicates that al-Qaida proba­bly would attempt to launch terrorist attacks against U.S. interests claiming they were defending Muslims or the Iraqi people rather than Saddam Hussein's regime," Ridge said in a statement. 
He also referred to "reports of suspicious activity in and around military facilities, ports, waterways, general infrastruc­ture and targets that are con­sidered symbolic to U.S. power and influence." 
The FBI has increased sur­veillance on certain Iraqis in America and other suspected terrorists or terrorist sympa­thizers. Homeland Security offi­cials said any asylum-seeking Iraqis and people from 33 other countries would be detained for background investigations. 

Turkish law-makers to vote on U.S. plan 
Associated Press 
ISTANBUL, 
Turkish leaders said Monday they were ready to press ahead with a measure to allow the 
U.S. military to use Turkey as a staging area for a war against Iraq. 
Deputy Prime Minister Abdullatif Sener said the Cabinet would discuss autho­rization for American troops Tuesday, and parliament could take up the measure Wednesday, private NTV tele­vision reported. 
"A unanimous decision was reached ... that there is a need to move urgently," presidential spokesman Tacan lldem said. 
An earlier resolution failed 

by just four votes, and Turkey's government has been dragging its feet on reintroduc­ing the measure. Polls show that more than 80 percent of the Turkish public opposes a war. 
The United States has repeatedly called on Turkey's government to quickly resub­mit a resolution that would let in tens of thousands of U.S. soldiers to open a northern front against Iraq that would divide Saddam Hussein's army. Turkish and U.S. generals agree the strategy would made a war shorter and less bloody. 
On Monday, political and mil­itary leaders called on parlia­ment to take steps to let in for­eign troops.

. Hopes for a quick win in Iraq fuel big gains

NEW YORK 
The growing likelihood of war with Iraq sent stocks rallying for a fourth straight session Monday, as investors became confident the United States would prevail in a short-lived con­flict. The Dow Jones indus­trial average surged more than 280 points, catapult­ing itself to a four-day gain of more than 600 points. 
Investors who had feared that war would threaten the economy are increas­ingly optimistic about the outcome of a conl1ict with Iraq. 
A brief war "allows busi­nesses to stop waiting and watching and get back to spending and hiring. And it allows consumers gets back to spending.... [It] should put the shaky [economic] recovery back on more solid footing," said Joseph Keating, chief investment officer at AmSouth Asset Management in Birmingham, Ala. 
However, analysts say stocks can't sustain a meaningful advance until the situation with Iraq becomes more clear.

Panel will study Sn1art investigation 
Associated Pr.ess 
SALT LAKE CITY 

An independent commission will be appointed to investigate how police handled the Elizabeth Smart abduction case, Salt Lake City's mayor said Monday. 
Rocky Anderson said the five-member panel will begin its work after the completion of the case against Brian Mitchell, who is suspected in the kidnapping. He did handy­man work at the Smart house one day in November 2001 and was identified by Elizabeth's younger sister as the man who may have taken the teen. 
The commission will likely focus on the level of attention authorities gave the self-pro­claimed prophet during the investigation, and whether they concentrated too hard on Richard Ricci. 
Hicci had worked as a handy­man at the Smart home more than a year before the kidnap­ping and was considered a possible suspect in the weeks after Elizabeth's disappear­ance. Ricci died last August of a brain hemorrhage in jail, where he was being held on an unrelated parole violation. 
Elizabeth was spotted with Mitchell and Wanda Barzee in Sandy, Utah, on Wednesday, nine months after she van­ished. 
Mitchell, 49, and Barzee, 57, remained in jail Monday as prosecutors weighed their case against the pair. They will like­ly face federal or state charges by Wednesday, said Melodie Rydalch, spokeswoman for the 
U.S. Attorney's Office in Utah. 
Mitchell's father and attor­ney said authorities should be lenient. 
"There's a lot of people that kidnap little kids and murder them," said Shirl Mitchell, 83. "He took care of the girl and she came back in good health." 
Attorney Larry Long, who is representing Mitchell, said that giving his client a light sen­tence could encourage kidnap­pers to keep their captives alive. He said Mitchell consid­ered Elizabeth's disappearance a "call from God" and took her as his second wife. 
Mitchell also told his attor­ney he wants Smart to be renamed "Remnant Who Will Return." 
"He wanted me to tell the world ihat she is his wife, and he still loves her and knows that she still loves him, that no harm came to her during their relationship and the adventure that went on," attorney Larry Long said in an interview aired late Sunday on KUTV. 
Smart family spokesman Chris Thomas dismissed Long's comments. 
AUSTRALIA 

Australia comtnits troops to Iraq strike 
Associated Press 

CANBERRA 
Prime Minister John Howard said Tuesday his government would commit 2,000 military personnel to any U.S.-led strike aimed at disarming Iraq. 
At the same time. the gov­ernment announced it had ordered the five diplomats who work at the Iraqi embassy and their families to leave the country, giving them five days to pack their bags -a direct result of Australia's decision to join any war against Iraq. 
"The government has autho­rized the chief of the Australian Defense Force to place the Australian forces

already deployed in the Gulf 
region as part of any U.S. led 
coalition operation that may 
take place in the future," a 
somber Howard, flanked by 
two Australian flags, said in a 
televised address to the 
nation. 
Howard's comments came 
just hours after President 
Bush called him to ask 
Australian troops to join his 
"coalition of the willing." 
"The action that has to be 
taken as a result of this deci­
sion has a sound legal basis in 
the resolutions of the Security 
Council that have already been 
passed," Howard added, 
Howard said if international 
forces massed on Iraq's bor­
ders were withdrawn, "any 
semblance of cooperation from 
Iraq [with weapons inspectors] 
would disappear." 
Howard said he was "very 
conscious" of the opposition to 
his decision in the Australian 
community. A poll published 
Tuesday showed 71 percent of 
voters oppose U.S.-led strikes. 
"This government has taken 
a decision which it genuinely 
believes is in the medium and 
longer term interests of this 
country," Howard said. 
Another sign of opposition 
was emblazoned on the 
Sydney Opera House early 
Tuesday in the form of huge 
red letters spelling out "No 
War" on the landmark build­
ing. 
Howard, one of Bush's 
staunchest supporters, pulled 
his Cabinet in for an early 
morning emergency session to 
consider Bush's request for 
military support. 
The meeting broke up after 
only 50 minutes and Howard 
then briefed lawmakers before 
addressing the nation. 
Answering questions from 
reporters in Canberra after 
the address, Howard refused 
to discuss a timetable for mili­
tary action, saying that was 
now an "operational" matter. 
Howard said the government 
had no intention of increasing 
its deployment from the cur­
rent 2,000. 
Howard's decision was to be 
debated later Tuesday in par­
liament but would not be put 
to a vote. 
Opposition Labor Party leader Simon Crean earlier warned Australian involve­ment in a U.S.-led strike would put Australia at greater risk of terror attacks. 
"Our involvement in this war will spawn terrorism and encourage terrorists and Australia will as a conse­quence become more of a tar­get," Crean told reporters. 
Bush placed the call follow­ing an announcement Monday that the United States, Britain and Spain would not seek a Security Council vote on their 
U.N. resolution seeking autho­rization for war -a move that all but ended diplomatic efforts to avoid military action. 
Australia has elite troops, fighter planes and navy ships in the region. 
The government Monday issued new warnings to travel­ers in the Middle East, advis­ing citizens to leave Iraq, Kuwait and Israel, and to defer nonessential travel to Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Qatar and Bahrain.

War in Iraq? 

Not Too Late to Consider Peace 
by Kelly Rich 

Intern, Campus Ministry 
In struggling over the past year and a half with issues of war and peace, the questions I find most difficult co answer are the pastoral ones. Our church does have a Just War Theory and it is taught as a valid and acceptable Christian response for times of war -that is, when "times of war" fie the criteria mandated for justified military action. (Let us keep in mind that, as has been declared repeatedly by the US Bishops as well as leaders of other Christian churches, the conflict we are currently facing with Iraq does not fit the criteria.) Still, considering that a large part of the church understands our options for military response in the context of this Just War teaching and not from the Church's pacifist tradition, there is certainly a pastoral need for sensitivity in approaching these issues. The question it seems we must ask ourselves is, how do we face the reality of our political situation, be realistic about our options and the decisions our leaders and other nations' leaders must make, but without compromising the ideals of peace and justice? It is 
undoubtedly a But for me, as I accept this challenge and difficult task. 
consider who it is I pledge to follow, I find I do 
Nevertheless, what I have returned not understand Jesus except as someone who to over and over 
lived and taught a life of radical love and 
again in asking myself these mercy. I do not understand the message of questions, is the 
the Gospel but as one of peace, and yes,

himself. This year justice, but above all, peace. the staff at Campus Ministry has accepted a renewed challenge, as part of our common Christian mission of evangelization, to 
consider the example of the life ofJesus in all we do -in programs we plan and coordinate, in encounters with students and staff, in every opportunity we might find co minister. Certainly among us, and among the entire community of the faithful, there are different interpretations of what this will look like; variation is inevitable, as each of us experience God and the life of Christ in distinct ways. But for me, as 
l accept this challenge and consider who it is I pledge to follow, I find I do not understand Jesus except as someone who lived and taught a life of radical love and mercy. I do not understand the message of the 
Gospel but as one of peace, and yes, justice, but above all, peace. Realizing these things, I am left asking 
myself, how will our world ever know the way of peace, true mercy and love, ifwe who follow the Prince 
of Peace do not make explicit that message? If we are the church ofJesus Christ, who gave his life to give 
us everlasting peace, what can we consider in rimes of conflict but the same path of peace which he 
walked? 

Today we, as a community of believers, are challenged to .:!~cide how we will respond to what is daily becoming a more threatening global situation. Christ was explicit in calling for peace, for love of our enemies, for mercy and forgiveness even before justice. Though across campus we may find it difficult to agree as to what course of action our nation should pursue, let us remember that as Christians we are called co be undivided in recognizing the need for prayer at this time. Campus Ministry continues to offer mass each Friday at 5: 15 in prayer for peace. I hope you will join us.

Experts urge against panic over illness 
Associated Pre.s 
A handful of suspected cases of a deadly flu-like illness sur­faced in new spots around the globe Monday, but medical experts said there "should not be panic" because the spread is not as aggressive as most forms of influenza. 
Thero also were no new fatalities since the nine first reported when the World llealth Organization issued its unusual global alert over the weekend. WHO officials said they were investigating suspi­cious cases in England. France, Israel, Slovenia and Australia, all of which previ­ously had none. 
Most of the 167 cases that have appeared in the past three weeks are health work­ers in !long Kong, Vietnam and Singapore. China said 300 peo­ple had what appeared to be the same illness in an outbroak that began last November in Guangdong province. 
In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was skeptical Lhal the four cases it was look­ing into would be verified as "severe acute respiratory syn­drome," or SARS, the name given the unidentified illness. The CDC already has ruled out 10 other suspicious cases. 
Disease investigators said it could Lake weeks to determine the cause of the mysterious outbreak. 
WHO officials also said that for the first time, China was allowing teams of experts into the country to take a closer look at its own earlier out­break. which killed five people before it was brought under control. WUO investigators should be there by week's end, the U.N. agency said. 


Experts believe that the most likely explanation for the respi­ratory illness is an exotic virus or -the most feared scenario ­a new form ofinfluenza. 
However, WHO's communi­cable diseases chief. Dr. David Heymann, said the illness doesn't seem to spread as quickly a nu. 
"Ii isn't contagious at the level of many other infectious diseases," he said. "A normal inlluenza would be very conta­gious to people sitting in the same room." 
So far, experts say there is no evidence the infection spreads by casual contact. Such as sitting next to some­body in an airplane. 
"There should not be panic. This is a disease which, ii seems. requires very close con­tact with patients and it is mainly hospital workers who have been infected in the first wave of infections. Now we are seeing that some other family members have been infected," Heymann said. 
CDC head Dr. .Julie Gerberding said she doubts the nu virus is responsible, since Hong Kong labs, which are very good at diagnosing influenza, have not been able to idc n tify it. 
The incubation period for SAHS appears to be three to seven days. It often begins with a high fever and other llu-like symptoms, such as headache and sore throat. Victims typi­cally develop coughs, pneumo­nia, shortness of breath and other breathing difficulties. Death results from respiratory failure. 
The Chinese said 7 percent of patients there required breathing tubes, but most 
eventually got better, especial­ly if they were not also stricken with a bacterial infection. In addition. the disease seemed to weaken as it passed from per­son to person. 
That's encouraging, WHO officials say. adding that some of the patients in the latest out­break seem to be recovering. 
China's provision of a written summary of its outbreak was an unprecedented step of cooperation by Beijing in glob­al disease surveillance. Heymann said. It was also an important one, partly because scientists have for years been warning that a new influenza pandemic is inevitable and new types of flu often develop in that part of the world, Heymann said. 
"The big concern i.n this area of the world is that one day another influenza virus could hop the barrier between ani­mals and humans. In the 20th century three viruses crossed, and the last two, in the '50s and '60s, occurred in the southern China area," Heymann said. 
In another unprecedented move. the WHO on Monday created a "virtual research center," which links 10 labora­tories in 11 countries to search for the cause in cooperation instead of competition. 
A Slovene woman suspected of suffering from the illness was listed in stable condition Monday at a hospital in the capital, Ljubljana. She had returned from a trip to Vietnam 10 days ago. 
French health authorities said Monday that two people who returned from Asia were hospitalized in Paris after doc­tors suspected they might have the illness.

Iraqi oil exports dwindle as war loom.s 
Asociated P rcss 

LONDON 
Skitlish banks and buyers, and a steep rise in freight rates, have constrained Iraq's ability to export oil even before the outbreak of any hostilities in the Persian Gulf, industry sources said Monday. 
A U.S.-lcd war against Iraq is widely expected to interrupt Iraqi oil exports and probably also halt it.s production of crude. Although Iraq shipped about 2 million barrels of crude a day last month. ports that handle Iraqi crude under the U.N. oil­for-food program have already gone quiet, 
said to be quiet. 
French bank Societe Generalc used to do a small but steady business financing Iraqi crude shipments. However, concerns about a war-related disruption in supplies led it to stop approv­ing fresh letters of credit start­ing in February. said Thomas Petitbon, the bank's commodi­ties group director. 
If a war breaks out, banks worry not only that Iraq might not be able to export its oil, but that even if it is able, the price of that crude could fall if it appears the war will be swift. If oil prices fall, that reduces the value of the cargoes serving as 
collateral for 
analysts and the banks and

have had increasing difficulty finding buyers. Without sales invoices from refiners and other customers to use as collateral, these traders have had trouble obtaining bank financing for their own purchases from Iraq, said Leo Drollas, chief economist at the Center for Global Energy Studies. 
Although Iraq exported 10 million barrels during the week ending March 7, data were like­ly to show that shipments dwin­dled to 7 million barrels in the following week. With war fears intensifying, Iraqi exports are likely to plummet to 2 million barrels this week, assuming a war hasn't begun, Drollas said. 
Mina al-Bakr, the Gulf termi­nal for shipments of crude from southern Iraq, was idle Monday. 
"I think the last vessel loaded and sailed yesterday," said Peter Gignoux, head of the petroleum desk at Salomon Smith Barney. 
The other main gateway for Iraqi oil, Ceyhan on Turkey's Mediterranean coast, was also

cents to $34.93 a barrel in afternoon trading in New York. May con­tracts sank 82 cents to $32.54. 
May contracts of North Sea Brent, the European benchmark crude, were 65 cents lower at $29.48 a barrel in London. 
Higher freight rates have added to the cost of buying Iraq oil. Shippers now must pay $3.25 a barrel to charter a 250,000-ton tanker for a voyage from the Persian Gulf to north­western Europe or the U.S. East Coast. The perceived risk of war has driven rates up from $2.50 a barrel in December. 
"This is the highest rates have been since September 1973, just prior to the oil crisis," Drollas said. 
Iraq has the largest oil reserves after Saudi Arabia, but with limited facilities for storing oil, it also has cut back on pro­duction. Iraqi output is expected to fall by almost half this month, from an average of 2.5 million barrels a day last month to 1.3 million barrels in March, Drollas said.

A call for dedication to the other America 
A couple of weeks ago, I traveled to Mt. Vernon, Kentucky to interview for a vol­unteer position with the Christian Appalachian Project (CAP). Now. I know what you're thinking, "Oh, funny girl can't get a job. She thought she was so Amy Schill smart. Who's laugh­ing now, funny girl?" If you're 
Dazed and
thinking this, you're 
Amused
absolutely right, but I'm still srna11er than you are. Yes, perhaps the demand for English litera­ture dilettantes isn't as high as I thought it would be four years ago. Regardless, my decision to do a year of service after graduation actually has very little to do with my job prospects and a whole lot to do with the fact that, for some strange reason that I don't yet fully fathom, I feel called to spend the next part of my life in Eastern Kentucky. 
The breath-taking beauty of the east­ern Kentucky mountains is overshad­owed only by the devastating poverty of its inhabitants. When the coal industry was thriving, good jobs were plentiful. Now, with the coal companies gone, there's plenty of black lung but very few jobs with decent wages. As a result, the mountains are littered with shacks and trailers, many without access to running water. This is the other America. Like the poor in urban ghettos who are clumped tightly together just out of sight of the wealthy suburbs, the poor in Appalachia are tucked away in the mountains, com­pletely forgotten by the American con­scious and the mainstream media, except for the occasional mocking. 
Unfortunately, the picture of Appalachians that most of Americans see is as negative as it is false. The comments of a man on the plane on my way to Kentucky confirmed my suspicions that many Americans have no real under­standing of the plight of Appalachians. (This guy also said the government should tie the tubes of women who had illegitimate children, so you be the judge.) We think of Appalachians as hillbillies, lazy. stupid, mountain people who talk funny and would just like their welfare check and to be left alone, thank you very much. Truth is, our ideas about Appalachian couldn't be further from the truth. 
All right, they do talk funny, and the place makes Notre Dame seem racially diverse. But that other stuITjust isn't right. Sure, there are lazy people every­where. but I haven't been able to find many in my time in Kentucky. 
I've met Louie, who took an active role in CAP's work to fix up his trailer, shout­ing not a few orders for my soft college hands. 
I've met Gilbert, a man unable to work because of a debilitating injury sustained on the job, who is bringing up a very bright twelve year-old on his own. CAP reimbursed him to get running water set up in his home (a beautiful little house that Gilbert worked hard to maintain). When he picked up his check, Gilbert, like the selfish bum he is, wanted to know if he could donate some old clothes to CAP's clothing program. 
Finally, I've met Octavia, a wonderful Appalachian storyteller who wowed everyone as a young woman with a superb ACT score despite being constant­ly told she had to be stupid because she was poor. She earned a college degree, but she and her husband still barely get by because of economic depression. 
Appalachians were self-sufficient before they became dependent on the coal industry, and they can be self-suffi­cient again. That's where CAP comes in. 

CAP and its over 70 programs are not about handouts. they are about helping Appalachians help themselves. For those who need more than temporary assis­tance, CAP always does what it can to get people working. Take this typical conver­sation between CAP and Bobby Ray (yeah, I'm really all about knocking down stereotypes). 
CAP: So, we've helped you fix up your house, now how about trying to get a job? 
BR; Well, I've got these elderly parent. 
CAP: Elderly Services will care for them while you work! BR: I don't have any education or skills. CAP: Adult education and job training [arc] available free 
of charge! 
BR: Well. um ... 
CAP: Speech impediment? We can help! 
It's this kind of dedication to doing something for a region that is so often ignored that gets me excited about work­ing for CAP. So yeah, it's not a paying gig, but with all these friendly people, beauti­ful scenery and a great program, I can't wait to get to my new Kentucky home. Now if you'll excuse me, I have banjo lessons to attend.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

Do not forget Cuba 
Do not forget Cuba. Traveling and studying with of group of Notre Dame students and faculty in Havana. Cuba over spring break clarified for me the important need for political and social awareness. 
Today's news programs highlight the hottest topics around the world but often fail to address the most fundamental rea­sons and causes of human tragedy and triumph. A pending war with Iraq, hostility in North Korea and continued Middle East conflict are fierce reminders that understanding politics and international relations is not only the job of leaders and academics, but vastly important for all participants in civi­lized society. 
Cuba, a poor country, is a fascinating case study with rich­ness in both culture and historical significance. With the exception of the most inflammatory of news events such as Elian Gonzalez, meaningful discussions about Cuba have fal­tered in recent years. Yet other relevant and important top­ics such as the relation between church and state, the influ­ences of a burgeoning tourist industry in a Marxist society and the advantages of a strong social welfare system contin­ue to unfold in Cuba and hold great insight for the rest of the world. 

Whether it is human rights or trade embargoes, discussing Cuba and its revolutionary effect in Latin America and beyond will only increase awareness and illuminate truth. Ultimately, the realities of globalization and democratization make understanding the pitfalls and successes of diverse peoples crucial to creating a 20th century climate that is not defined by complacency but rather vision and perspective.

Notre Dame has paid a price in pursuit of greatness 
"Megalomania. That's what ails Notre Dame." A now-deceased Holy Cross priest told me that referring to Notre Dame's decision to abandon its historical mission in pursuit of "big school'' pres­tige. The mission of Notre Dame had been Lhe provision of affordable education in the Catholic trn.di­tion to undergrads, with research and graduate programs, especially in the sci­ences, in an impor­tant but complemen­tary role. 
"Megalomania" is an "obsessive desire to do things on a grand scale." The priest's comment comes to mind because this is the 25th anniversary of Notre Dame's great leap forward, its defi­nition of itself as a "National Catholic Hesearch University." 
In the 1970s, the major universities went heavily into the "research universi­ty" business. In 1978, income restrictions were removed on eligibility for federal student loans. The universities then raised tuition to finance their research programs and buildings. They then lob­bied Congress to raise loan limits. As the limits went up, so did tuition and back to Congress went the universities to lobby for higher limits. And so on. The research empires were built on the backs of bor­rowing students. Notre Dame, while far from the worst offender, played this game. 

Our leaders act in what they see as the best interest of Notre Dame and its stu­dents. It may be useful, however, to ask what price Notre Dame has paid for the greatness project. 
1. 
Cost. Notre Dame's tuition and foes make up 55 percent of the budget. The undergrad tuition, room and board charge for 2002-03 is $32,020. In 1978­79, it was $5,180. !fit had kept pace with intlation it would now be $14,245. Notre Dame, through its excellent financial aid oflice, tries to provide University aid to students. The student loan, however, remains the primary form of financial aid. Predictably, the only non-wealthy students at Notre Dame will soon be those whose test scores won heavy dis­counts, scholarship athletes, ROTC stu­dents, minority scholarship students, fac­ulty and staff children and those non­wealthy students, diminishing in number, who choose Notre Dame even at the price of a crippling loan burden. 

2. 
Diminution of the undergrad experi­ence. Notre Dame undergrads are paying more than twice as much, in real dollars, than they did in 1978, but they are get­ting less. Members of our family were Notre Dame undergrads every year from 1977 to 2000 in various majors. In the variety of available courses, class size, 


quality of teaching and the recognition of students as persons, the undergrad expe­
rience has deteriorated since 1977. Twenty-two percent of 100-level courses 
are taught by student instructors. The University's report on Graduate Education, 1996-2001, noted that Notre Dame needs 507 more grad students 
"because the number of graduate stu­dents has not kept pace with the increase in faculty in Ph.D. granting depart­ments." In the Research University, you hire more and more researching faculty who teach less and less. The rhetoric puts teaching on a par with research. But everyone knows better. Notre Dame's answer to inadequate teaching is not to reward faculty as teachers but to get funding for a center to do research on teaching. As one tenured philosophy pro­fessor put it, "You really don't need to have any impact on the undergraduates" to get promoted. "You just need Ito have written] a book." 
3. The campus. Undergrad life is diminished by the "binge building" which has transformed Notre Dame into a cramped, urban-style research campus, with at least 40 of the· 90 buildings built after 1980. The economy has put some projects on hold, but no end is in sight. Which donor will have the most buildings named after him or her? Will the world­class parking garage be the crowning feature? In contrast to the more humane design of older buildings, the newer cre­ations evoke technocratic images, such as the DeBartolo rendering of the con­cept of five half-pint milk cartons on line and the relentless triangular patterns of other new buildings. The open recre­

ational spaces have given way to con­
crete. Social restrictions tend to induce undergrads to leave the campus, some­times to their peril. 
4. Catholic character. Notre Dame accepts the authority of' the federal gov­ernment, the NCAA and many other enti­ties, as well as the secular "academic community." The only authority it will not accept is that of the Catholic Church to define the meaning of a "Catholic" uni­versity. The problem is truth-in-labeling. For reasons beyond our space limits, Notre Dame's "Catholic" character erodes in proportion to its pursuit ofsec­ular prestige. 
We can fairly ask, 25 years on, whether Notre Dame's excursion into "megaloma­nia" has come at an unacceptable price. It is possible for a research university to maintain its Catholic character and a positive focus on undergrad education without the imposition of crushing stu­dent debt. Perhaps it is time to reconsid­er a few things.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Respect our 
armed forces 
In this trying time. where crucial decisions are not backed by clear, unanimous support. a certain group of men and women are being asked to carry out duties intended for our national defense. Whether you support U.S. involvement in the Arab world or not, please remember that these military men and women don't have the luxury ofsitting comfortably at home with the morning paper or the evening news, criti­cizing or cheering world leaders. It would be all too easy to lapse back into the Vietnam-era disrespect and dishonor of military personnel, seeing these people not as patriots who devoted their lives to the preservation of our nation but as propagators of a single event. 
The tradition of Notre Dame students serving in their coun­try's military dates as far back as the Spanish-American War. when a young graduate was one of the sailors killed during the mishap on the USS Maine. It is a tradition that was built by naval midshipmen living and learning at this University during the Second World War and continues onto our three branches of ROTC students who currently reside in our halls. It is a tradition that our University administrators have publicly supported and honored in speeches and cere­monies to the cadets and midshlprnen. It is a tradition that so many ofour classmates have supported through private acknowledgement. respect, and curiosity. 
In an effort to show solidarity, or at least respect, it is time that this University properly and formally recognizes its stu­dents who turn away from the higher-paying civilian world and enter into the United States armed forces. Instead ofhid­ing the annual Pass and Review inside Loftus, Notre Dame needs to reinstate it lo South Quad. Bringing this military event back into the public should not be a political statement about our present situation. but rather an expression ofgrat­itude and recognition by the University, students and faculty alike. I believe support for the military is strong among our student body, and I would like to see our newly elected and soon-to-be-elected senators implement this change. During such an uncertain time for ROTC and non-ROTC students, now is not the time to let divisions and misconceptions grow.

Democracy requires activism 
I am writing in response to Paul Benedict's March 6 letter "Anti-American is so yesterday." I believe Mr. Benedict is confused as to the purpose ofstudent activism and the anti-war movement at large. To clear up his confusion, I invite Mr. Benedict to join me at the next campus peace rally so he might hear and contemplate the sound moral and practical argu­ments for alternatives for pre-emptive U.S. aggression in Iraq and not mistake them with "whines about foreign policy" or reductionist argu­ments about oil. However, in case Mr. Benedict decides to decline my offer, in the following I offer a response to his most troubling concerns about stu­dent activism. 
First off, the notion that Americans should unfailingly sup­port the administration in its deci­sion to wage war in Iraq (or in any decision. for that matter) is not a democratic one and certain­ly not American. As members of a democracy, it is fundamental that we, as citizens, call into question the actions of our leaders. This plu­ralism of opinion is what drives democracy and differentiates America from a dictatorship like Iraq. However, ifwe self-censor or simply choose follow blindly, not thinking criti­cally about the decisions of our government, we might as well live in a dictatorship. 
While Mr. Benedict is correct in asserting that Saddam Hussein is a ruthless dictator and should be removed from power, he errs in claiming that "war is the only way." He later speaks of the hegemony of Saddam's regime, however failing to recognize the hegemony he and others of the same mind are uncon­sciously upholding when blindly digesting and regur­gitating the weak justifications our president and his officials give for starting a war. The United States will not be doing the people oflraq a justice by bombing their already decimated country, still suffering from the structural violence done by the U.S. in the Gulf War. While democracy should be a right, by defmi­tion, it cannot be imposed by force. Implementing a democracy (read: installing a puppet government enforced by U.S. military) after eliminating Saddam by aggression will not allow Iraq to achieve democra­cy. Furthermore, ifwe are to justify a U.S. attack with such moral and idealistic goals as promoting democ­racy and forging justice, we should expect our govern­ment to uphold these same ideals. For instance, we might expect our country to sign the treaty permitting 

the establishment of an International Criminal Court, by which many enemies to humanity, 
including Saddam Hussein, could be tried and imprisoned. When the United States refuses to sign the treaty implementing 
the ICC in order to protect our own war criminals, top-level government offi­
cials such as Henry Kissinger, is the it upholding the ideals of truth, justice, and the American Way? When we 
completely ignore peaceful alterna­tives to war such as the ICC, are we even employing a common-sense "cost-benefit" approach as Mr. Benedict suggests? 
In closing, I encourage all who are, like Mr. Benedict, tired ofseeing "No War for Oil" signs to come to the next 
student protest and hear some of the more convincing arguments against a war in Iraq. Perhaps you might do your 
research and come up with some arguments of your own. And for all those who will not 
come out of disinterest or disagreement, please do not belittle the attemplS of the students on our cam­pus to think critically about the war and make our voice heard. I would hope that more students on this campus would formulate informed opinions about the actions of our government, especially when these actions violate basic principles of human rights. Just as "anti-American is so yesterday," it is also passc to be an unchallenging supporter of the dominant dis­course which you are spoon-fed.

ALBUM REVIEW 
Harper's diamonds are sparkling 
By RYAN RAFFERTY 
Scene Music Critic 
Ben Harper first emerged on the music scene in 1994 v.'.ith his release Welcome to the Cruel World. Harper's first album was very laid back and acoustic. Since then, he has released three other studio albums, all with progressively broadening sounds. Ben Harper has always been known for creat­ing music that reflects several different styles of music, and his latest album, Diamonds on the Iru,ide, is no different. 
The songs on Harper's latest album range from reggae and funk, to blues and rock. Diamonds on the Inside showcases Harper's wide range of musical styles bet­ter than any previous album, making it appealing to fans of any type of music. Harper wears his influences on his sleeve, as is most apparent in the Bob Marley sounding reggae track "With My Own Two Hands." Influences from Bob Dylan, Lenny Kravitz and Al Green can be heard on this album as well. Diamonds on the Inside also showcases some of Harper's best Weissenborn style guitars, which look almost like an acoustic guitar but has a deeper sound and is played like a lap side guitar. Harper has been a pioneer in Weissenborn guitar playing in recent years, most recently appearing on Jack Johnson's solo album playing Weissenborn on Johnson's single, "Flake." 
The lyrics on Harper's albums have always been very religious and poetic, but his latest release features some of his best lyrics. Many songs have biblical references and are built around Harper's intense spir­ituality. The best example of religious influ­ences is in the song called "Picture of Jesus." This song is entirely vocal with no instrumental accompaniment. The Ladysmith Black Mambazo sings the rhythm to the songs beautifully and is rem­
iniscent of 
P a u I 
Simon's Graceland album. Harper s i n g s about how he prays, " ... when­ever I feel lost," and about how Jesus will guide him in life whenever he prays. 
Amongst the religious refer­ences and serious poetic tracks, there arc several fun pop songs. One of the best, "Bring the Funk," sounds like it could have come off of any George Clinton album. A heavy synth bass line lays out the groove in the song and a very George Clinton-like key­board wails over Harper's lyrics. Another fun track is the title track, "Diamonds on the Inside." It is a mainly acoustic song with an incredibly catchy chorus and more excellent guitar work by Harper. Tracks like "Temporary Remedy" and "So High So Low" sound very similar to Lenny Kravitz's elec­tric sound with melodic dis­torted guitars. The best track is "Blessed to Be a Witness," which is a track played exclu­sively by Harper. He plays sev­eral types of conga drums and percussion instruments, along with the melody played on a tongue drum, which is very similar to a Jamaican steel drum. 

Overall, Diamonds on the Inside is Ben fan will enjoy. No matter the musical taste, Harper's strongest album to date and reggae, folk, rock, blues, funk or just good showcases his blend of different styles of music, this is the perfect album for every­music perfectly. The only bad apple on this one. album is "When She Believes," which is bogged down by too many strings and sounds more like a song a symphony Contact Ryan Rafferty at would play. Other than that, this is an rafferty.3@nd.edu 

Ben Harper shows his musical versatility on his new album, ranging from reggae, folk, rock, blues and funk.

ALBUM REVIEW 
Alabama offers southern lovin' 
By CHRISTIE 8O1.SEN 
Assistant Scene Editor 
Note to listener: country super group Alabama's latest release, In the Mood: The Love Songs, is a quality compilation of two discs worth or classic Southern ballads from an incredible career of hits, but it will probably not actually get anyone of college age "in the mood." 
Unfortunately, or fortunately depending on the point of view, sounds like Alabama's are fading away in today's country music. A rundown of today's top country artists is comprised mostly or crossover sensations and regulars on adult contemporary and pop radio stations. The result is that albums like In the Mood seem a little bit too much country and not enough rock 'n roll for younger audiences that cut their 

In the Mood: The love Songs

RCA Records 


teeth for country music on the likes of Toby Keith and Trick Pony. 
Yet the faithful fan base that made the band the best-selling country group of all time will not be disappointed by the romantic lyrics and familiar tunes on Alabama's 24th album. The band, which writes its own songs and plays its own instruments, has a style of recording and performing songs that has made it a big­ger-selling band than legends such as Led Zeppelin, The Doors and Pink Floyd. Their announcement of this latest album was paired with the surprising announcement of "The American Farewell Tour." 
In the Mood has two newer tracks, 'Tm in the Mood" and "The Llving Years." 'Tm in the Mood" is an example of Alabama's stellar ability to sing emotional lyrics with­out any emotion, a significant weakness in some of their songs that have passionate 
words but none of the pas­sion u1 the sung ver­s i o n s . When they sing, "Girl, I'm in the mood to be your man / To win your heart all over again / Let my eyes trace, let my lips taste/ Nothing but you" it sounds like they could be singing about milking cows or plant­ing soybeans, with their voices seem­ing so disinterested. 
Their other new single fares much better. It features quick guitar and drumbeats with slow, melodic lyrics. Unlike the songs about romance, it handles the weightier topics of parental loss, familial love and regret. "Say it loud, say it clear/ You can listen as well as you hear / It's too late when we die / To admit we don't see eye to eye." The quartet has already enjoyed considerable radio play with this more recent song, proving that their influence is likely to endure long after the farewell tour ends. From their first No. 1 hits in 1980, they have com­piled an impressive set of classic bal­lads that made this album. 
Their cover of the Carpenters' "Touch Me When We're Dancing" from the 80s is another highlight of the first disc, but many of the best parts are on the second disc. Their countrified version of "God Must Have Spent a Little More Time on You" gets a helpi11g hand on the harmonies from 'N Sync, and some chart-topping hits on both discs include "Fallin' Again," "Lady Down on Love" and "In Pictures." 
While Alabama clearly has had success with showing their softer side, like on many of these ballads that have reached the top, they are far more fun on their fast-paced good time songs celebrating the South and all that is country. Any fan of "Mountain Music," "Dixieland Delight," "If You're Gonna Play in Texas (You Gotta Have a riddle in the Band)" and "Song of the South" would do themselves a favor by picking up their greatest hits album, For the Record: 41 No. 1 Hits, instead of this mediocre collection.

ALBUM REVIEW 
No surprises froin Everclear 
By BECCA SAUNDERS 
Scene Music Critic 
The struggles of life in suburban America -everyone is aware that they exist. but they are brought to a whole new level of attention by rock band Evcrclear in their new album Slow 
Motion Daydream. This is not the first time Evcrclear has 
chosen this theme as a dominating force 
on an album; in fact nearly all of their 
past albums have been focused on the 
hardships of those people in middle­
class suburbia. This suburban theme is 
especially exemplified in Daydream's 
first single. "Volvo Driving Soccer Mom." Although credit must be given for originality in making the overall claim that "all porn stars become Volvo driving soccer moms," the premise of a parent struggling to have their own identity in the midst of a suburban family is not an idea that is new to an Everclear album. 
The repetition of subject is one thing. but through­out the album repetition is also strongly felt in the music. On many occasions, the beginnings of songs sound nearly identical to past Everclear hits. The energetic guitar is present on most tracks, lightening to a more sentimental sound on softer numbers 
such as "TV Show." The potent voice of lead singer Art Alexakis is a promi­nent force when paired with the strong guitar and 
p u n k y 
rhythm.

The wistful 
wisdom of Alexakis comes through on

y 
track. A former cocaine addict, Alexakis turned his life around in the mid-80s and since then has written with a wisdom one can only have from having personal experi­ence. Everclear has been around since the early 90s and grew to prominence beginning with 1994's album, Sparkle and Fade. The band continues to carry the punk rock tone in their music, as well as empathy with common middle­class American struggles. 
Overall, the album is a commentary on the true nature of people. At times, a depressing nature overtakes songs such as "How to Win Friends and Influence People" when Alexakis warns, "People love to break your heart" and "People love to hurt you when you close your eyes." "I Want to Die a Beautiful Death" begins, "Everybody here in this small town looks used and abused today." Just as one is about to lose faith in the world, the album turns the mood around with songs such as "Science Fiction." where Alexakis sings, "You need to remember, life is always getting better." Slow Motion Daydream brings itself to conclu­sion in the sentimental song "The New York Times" in which Alexakis earnestly claims, "I want to believe in this world / I want to believe in this life." 


The music causes emotions to range from high to low. and although some of the tunes are extremely familiar, the recipe of punchy vocals and a strong guitar presence is what creates success for Everclear. Even if it has been heard before it is still very much an enjoyable listening experience.

ALBUM REVIEW 
New punks on the block 
By STEVE HOEPLINGER 
Scene Music Critic 
Imagine that parietals were a thing of the past, food services was worth the cost, and every issue of The Observer had witty, entertaining comic strips -what could possibly be better than all that? The answer is the Transplants, a band that blows away everything about the rai:-'rock genre with a debut album that is destined to stand out as one of the best independent releases of the past decade. 

With a name that is very reflective of their music, the Transplants' moniker is one that actually makes sense, something all too rare among modern bands (for instance, what is a "hoobastank"?). Guitarist Tim Armstrong. vocalist Rob Aston and drummer Travis Barker take elements of hip hop, punk, dancehall, tech­no. rock and jazz and fuse them together for a sound that is like nothing ever heard before. Their self-titled debut is one of the most wholly original recordings -an opening shot in what may well be a new punk explosion. The bands' name also 
applies to its members; Armstrong and Barker both come from estab­lished bands {Rancid and Blink-182, respectively). though neither of them considers the Transplants to be a "side project." The album also fea­tures artists from several other bands, including Lars Frederiksen of Rancid, Davey Havok of AF!, Brody Armstrong of the Distillers and rap­pers Son Ooobie and Danny Diablo. 
The album is equal parts hip-hop and punk rock. Armstrong's punk roots are a perfect match for Aston's rhyming. and Barker's drumming lies somewhere in between, creating beats found nowhere else. Most of the songs consist of distorted punk riffs with hip hop vocals layered over 
them, splitting the rock and rap influences evenly, though the track "D.R.E.A.M.," which features under­ground rapper Diablo, is a hip hop anthem that even the Rudeboys can 
chant along to. 
Newcomer Rob Aston, who had never been in a band before this and whose only previous music experi­ence was rodieing for AFI and Rancid, is right at home behind the microphone, furi­ously spitting out lyrics with a passion that puts him in the running for the title of White Male Rage Personified. "Gimme a chance to shine and I'm a blind the world" he proclaims 1n the song "DJDJ," and you know from the seriousness in his voice that he means every word. 
The opening track, "Romper Stomper," a furious blitzkrieg of Aston's vocals and Annstrong's atomic buzz saw guitar work, quickly sets the tone of the album. Next up is "TaU Cans in the Air," which Aston describes as "a party song" that keeps up the album's manic pace (it also features the first of Armstrong's raps. which Rancid fans wiU either love or hate). 
"Diamonds and Guns," the single that is currently getting much attention, has an addictive piano riff that digs its hook into the listener's brain as soon as it's heard. The band lightens it up a little with "California Babylon," a slinky, sublime little number that just can't hide its own appeal before getting back into the dark, heavy territory on "We Trusted You," a musical indictment of liars and backstabbers every where. The album wraps up with a jazzy song called "Down in Oakland," a spooky tune that Armstrong's trademark raspy voice is just perfect for. The album's high­light is "Sad But True," a beautiful song about the loss of loved ones that is brutally honest and poignant even with distorted guitars and double syncopated drum beal'l. 


The Transplants have created an album that is not quite punk or rap, but some­thing more. Their greatest success is their ability to make music that is appealing to a diverse cross section of music fans but still unique and refreshing. This is musical artistry at its finest.

Canseco released from Miami prison 
Associated Press 
MIAMI 
Jose Canseco was released from jail Monday and resen­tenced to two years of house arrest for his part in a 2001 nightclub brawl. 
The former major league star, wearing a jail-issue red jumpsuit, apologized to the court for failing to complete all his probation terms. His twin brother, Ozzie, was in the courtroom, as was his father and a priest. 
"This has been embarrassing to my family and to my friends.... I now understand the seriousness of probation and I'm truly sorry," Canseco told the judge. 
Canseco also received three years' probation. If he com­pletes his first year of house arrest without problems, Canseco could be freed with the second year converted into an additional year of proba­tion. 
Prosecutors said they believed Canseco was genuine­ly contrite, saying he was teary during a private confer­ence. 
"I saw it in his face," prose­cutor Jonathan Granoff said. "Jail was a wake-up call and it served its purpose." 
Canseco had spent the last 30 days in jail for violating his probation when he pleaded guilty to battery charges stem­ming from the Oct. 31, 2001, fight. 
The 38-year-old Canseco was released on the probation violation charge, but Judge Leonard Glick warned him that any future violation would result in a 15-year prison sen­tence. 
Canseco originally was sen­tenced to probation in November after pleading guilty to felony aggravated battery and two counts of misde­meanor battery related to the Halloween night fight inside a Miami Beach nightclub. 
Glick ordered that the house arrest be served in Florida. He denied a motion by defense attorney Gustavo Lage that Canseco be allowed to serve the house arrest in California where he could continue pur­suing custody of his 6-year-old daughter. 

Canseco will be allowed to leave his home for certain events and may ask the court for permission to travel under special circumstances. Further conditions of his house arrest will be determined following interviews with the officers who will monitor his sentence. 
Glick had issued a warrant for Canseco's arrest on Feb. 14, after a probation officer reported that the six-time All­Star had violated several terms of his probation. Canseco had failed to attend anger management classes, had not worked his community service, had been outside of Florida for longer than 30 days and still owed a small fine -all probation violations. 
Canseco appeared before Glick on Feb. 18 and said he had been in Los Angeles because of a custody battle for his young daughter. The judge denied Canseco bond and ordered him held until Monday's sentencing hearing. 
Canseco said last month that he unsuccessfully tried to arrange the anger manage­ment classes, misunderstood the timeframe during which his community service was supposed to begin, and spent several weeks in Los Angeles. 
Canseco and his twin fought with two men at the nightclub. Ozzie Canseco also pleaded guilty to battery charges and received probation. He has complied with his sentence. 
One of the men allegedly involved in that fight, Christian Presley, filed a lawsuit in January seeking at least $1 million in damages. 
Canseco hit 462 home runs, the 26th-best total in baseball history. He retired in May after 1,887 games with seven teams, finishing his career with a .266 average, 1,407 RBI and 200 stolen bases. 
Canseco was the 1988 American League MVP and helped lead the Oakland Athletics to three straight World Series appearances from 1988-90. Oakland won the championship in 1989.

Cavaliers won't fine Davis 
Associated Press 
CLEVELAND 
Ricky Davis will not be fined by Cavaliers coach Keith Smart, who said Monday that embarrassment is punishment enough for the stunt against the Utah Jazz. 
"The deed is done," Smart said after a morning prac­tice. "What good would it do to slap him on the wrist? He has to live with what he did. Wherever he goes, people will remember it." 
Davis attempted to pad his statistics during a 122-95 victory over the Utah Jazz on Sunday. To get his first career triple-double in the final seconds of 1.he lowly Cavs' biggest wiu of the sea­son. Davis purposely missed a shot at the wrong basket and grabbed the rebound, thinking it was his 10th. 
Davis, the team's scoring leader, was fouled hard by the Jazz's OeShawn Stevenson, angered that his club was being mocked. Davis made the two free throws to finish with 28 points, 12 assists and nine rebounds. 
"No comment," the usually exuberant Davis said as he left practice Monday. 
Davis apparently did not know that his stunt back­fired even without Stevenson fouling him. The rulebook states: "It is a violation for a player to attempt a field goal at an opponent's bas­ket. The opposing team gets the ball." 
Davis did not get a shot attempt or his rebound. 
"I talked with Ricky after the game," Smart said. "The thing is, one tiny moment ruined the team's most suc­cessful game. Ricky had his finest game as far as blend­ing in with his teammates. None of that will be remem­bered, but what he did will 
follow him always."  
Smart  said  he  and  
Cavaliers  players  were  
embarrassed.  

"I felt very, very bad and before Ricky shot the free throws -I went and apolo­gized," said Smart, who walked over to an incensed Utah coach Jerry Sloan.

Slow start could lead to quick exit in NCAAs 
NEW YORK 

The storyline for the Irish the pac;t few games has been read­ing like a broken record. The Irish start slow while the oppo­nent builds an early lead, then the Irish make a huge come­back in the second half. 
This has happened several times in the past three weeks. In Notre Dame's last five games, the Irish were down by 17, 24, 21, seven and 23 points. 
Not surprisingly, the Irish only won one of those five games. 


Wednesday's loss to St. John's in the first round of the Big East Tournament. "It may be refreshing to get out of' this league now. They have got us figured out in the league so I think it's kind of good to get out of this league." 
Things that the Irish need to improve on in the off-week include early shooting and rebounding. In the first half against St. John's, the Irish allowed 13 offensive rebounds for the Red Storm from which St. John's scored 15 points. 
In contrast, the Irish only grabbed seven offensive rebounds while shooting just under 31 percent from the field in the first 20 minutes. 
The Irish also committed eight turnovers in the first half. Halfway through the first half, Notre Dame had committed five turnovers and scored only six points.

In each of the other four comeback attempts in each of 
those games, being behind late in the game is not a position that the Irish want to -or should -be in if they expect to win the game. 
After the disappointing loss to St. John's, the Irish are more than ready to get back on track. 
"We're very disappointed [about the loss]," Carroll said. "I think we just have to get away from it for a little bit, maybe just to clear our heads and forget about what's happened the last couple of weeks. and just move on and realize that we have a great opportunity ahead of us, and just take it from there." 
Big East opponent or not, the Irish need to execute better on both sides of the ball right from the opening tip. 

Otherwise, people will be opening Friday's sports section and reading another story about another failed Irish second-half comeback. 
After returning to South Bend from New York Thursday, the Irish will have had a full week of practice under their belts when they face olT against the Panthers at the RCA Dorne in Indianapolis.

Blue/Gray Classic provides problems for Irish 
 Losses to Tulsa, Boise State eliminate Irish from tournament which Notre Dame has won in past 
ByJOE LINDSLEY Spores Writer 
The Irish usually see much success at the Blue/Gray National Tennis Classic, held in Montgomery, Ala. over spring break. 
Two years ago, the Irish brought home the coveted green jackets awarded to the victors, and last year they reached the finals. 
Last week though, No. 46 Notre Dame began the tour­nament with a close 4-3 loss to No. 57 Tulsa, after the match was postponed due two days of rain delays. The Irish then came back on the same day to defeat UAB 4-2 in a consolation round match Friday, but Boise State ended the week on a sour note for Notre Dame, as the Broncos (10-6) shut out the Irish 4-0 in another consolation match. 
Notre Dame is now 5-8 on the season. 
The Broncos began by securing the doubles point with wins at No. 1 and No. 3. 
The team of sophomore Brent D'Amico and junior Matt Scott was defeated for the only time during the 
break,  and  the  pair  of  
sophomore  Paul  
McNaughton  and  junior  

Nicolas Lopez-Acevedo lost their second match of the week. 
With the doubles point clinched, the Broncos' Marcus Bernston, ranked 67th nationally, and Nils Klemann defeated junior tri­captains Luis Haddock and Brian Farrell, respectively. 
Haddock and Farrell each lost in straight sets, and the Broncos were up 3-0. The remaining matches were close though, and Notre 
Dame still had the opportu­nity to rally. Before they could put up their first point, Boise State's Thomas Schoeck defeated D' Amico, 6-3, 2-6, 6-2. and the Broncos claimed the win. 
Haddock was winless in singles at Blue/Gray, but Farrell picked up two sin­gles victories, including the match-clinching win against UAB. The two had success in doubles together, and they contributed to Notre Dame's winning of the doubles point against Tulsa. 
D'AJJiico and Scott's upset at No. 1 doubles of Tulsa's Ryan Livesay and Dustin Taylor, ranked 55th as a duo, combined with Haddock and Farrell's victory to put the Irish ahead 1-0. But severe thunderstorms inter­vened, and caused the sin­gles portion to be delayed until Friday morning. 
Lopez-Acevedo continued the seeming Irish shutout with his victory at the No. 6 flight over Alek Charpanditis, 6-1, 6-3. After Haddock succumbed to Livesay, Farrell put the Irish up 3-1, and within just a point of victory, when he defeated Shunsuke Shimizu, 7-5, 7-6 (7-4). 
Notre Dame lost the next three singles contests though, all of which went into three sets. Freshman Patrick Buchanan and D'Amico began their match­es with victorious sets of 6-4 and 6-3, respectively, but both of their opponents ral­lied to win the remaining sets. Meanwhile Scott won his second set 6-7 (6-8) after losing the first one 6-1, but No. 66 Alejandro Tejerina came back to win 6-0. 
Notre Dame will have a pair of tough home matches this weekend. No. 12 Minnesota visits Saturday and No. 44 Virginia Tech will be at the Eck Pavilion Sunday. 
Both matches begin at 1 p.m.

Irish -win 2 very different games 
By ANDY TROEGER 
Spores Wricer 
Notre Dame's womens lacrosse team won two games over break in very different fashions by knocking off' Boston College 13­12 and dominating Ohio 19-4. The two victories gave the Irish a 2-1 record with their only loss coming in their opener at Cornell. The Irish were also scheduled to play Brown, but that game was cancelled due to snow. 
The No. 11 Irish were severely tested by the Eagles in Chestnut Hill, Mass., but preseason All­American senior Danielle Shearer scored the eventual game-winner with 2:44 remain­ing in the contest. 
The game featured many goal spurts by both teams, with the Irish reeling off four goals in a row on two different occasions, while Boston College countered by scoring three unanswered goals on three different occa­sions. It was the Eagles' last such streak that tied the game at 12 before Shearer's game ½'inner. 
The Irish received multiple­point efforts from four different players. Shearer had six points on two goals and four assists, while classmate Eleanor Weille contributed five points on three goals and two assists. Junior Abby Owen had two goals and two assists for four points, with classmate Lauren Fischer scoring two goals. 
It was the fifth time the Irish had faced Boston College, with Notre Dame taking all five games. 
In their first game of spring 
break, Notre Dame fell behind Ohio 1-0 before taking over. The Irish scored four quick goals to take the lead on their way to a 10-3 halftime lead. 
Junior Meredith Simon paced the Irish against the BobcaLs with seven points on three goals and four assists while Shearer added three goals and three assist<; for six points. Freshman Crysti Foote added three goals and senior Anne Riley scored twice for the Irish, who had 13 players on the score sheet. The Irish out-shot Ohio 37-12 and outscored the Bobcats 9-1 in the second half. 
Notre Dame completes their season opening road trip today with a game in Orlando against Yale at 10 a.m.

the ball spun out of the cylin­der. Francis missed the two ensuing free throws, forcing the Irish to foul St. John's guard Marcus Hatten with 8.6 seconds left. 
"That's where we would have to win it, right there," Brey said. "Ile makes that 3­point play, that's one of those where you steal it. That's how you arc going to steal the win. But we had a similar situation in the Syracuse game where wo came back. Chris [Thomas] had a great look, and it went in and out. 
"It's almost like you don't deserve ii because you haven't played consistent enough for 40 minutes and the basketball gods say, 'Not today, you are not stealing it today."' 
After Francis' missed free throws at 82-80, Hatten made the first free throw but have had enough time to grab the ball and call for it. 
"[Carrolll shooting a runner right there ... I will live with that, you know, given we couldn't get our hands on it," Brey said. "If we got it clean I was going to use a time out. We didn't." 
Francis led all scorers in the game with 19 points. 
"I thought Torin was fabu­lous," Brey said. "I don't want him hanging his head on the free throws. He continues to improve for us." 
Francis provided all of the offense in the early going for the Irish, scoring the team's first six points of the game. 
Howlwer, in that same time span, St. John's used a combi­nation of deadly 3-point shoot­ing by Willie Shaw to jump out to a 21-6 lead halfway through the first half.

ty much set up for us where we can get some wins and have support." 
The 22-9 Irish, who earned their highest seed since 1987 and are seeded in the West Region for the first time in school history, will play 24-7 Horizon League champion Wisconsin-Milwaukee Thursday at 9:40 p.m. If the Irish win, they will play either No. 4 seed Illinois or No. 13 seed Western Kentucky Saturday. 
What school officials had ini­tially planned as a celebration in the Joyce Center when the Irish were ranked in the top 10 quickly became scaled back to a small private viewing of the selection show in Brey's home. 
And the Irish admit there was some anxiety as they wait­ed nearly an hour for Notre Dame to appear on the televi­sion screen. 
But the players are con­vinced there is a fundamental difference in the way the team has approached qualifying for the NCAA Tournament. 
"It's funny the way things have changed. Now we're expected to be in the tourna­ment," Matt Carroll said. The Irish were seeded No. 6 and No. 8 in Brey's first two years. 
At one point in the season, the Irish were projected as high as a No. 2 seed. But after Notre Dame dropped five of its last eight games, the Irish hoped they could land a No. 5 seed based on their strength of schedule and the wins they accumulated against high qual­ity opponents. 
"I would have been disap­pointed if we were lower than a five," Brey said. "We've done everything we're supposed to do." 
Beginning last year, the NCAA Tournament selection committee used a pod system to determine where teams would head for first-and sec­ond-round games. The idea is that the higher the seed, the greater the probability that a team could play closer to home. That kept the Irish in 

Indianapolis as opposed to 
heading out to Salt Lake City or 
Spokane, which are traditional 
West Region sites. 
Of the 65 teams in the NCAA Tournament, Notre Dame has played nine -Creighton, Connecticut, IUPUI, Kentucky, Marquette, Maryland, Pittsburgh, Syracuse and Texas -and accumulated a 5-6 record against those in the Tournament. 
The Irish were one of four Big East schools to earn an NCAA Tournament invitation, joining Connecticut, Pittsburgh and Syracuse. Boston College. who won the Big East East Division, and Seton Hall entered Selection Sunday on the proverbial bubble but didn't get a bid. 
For the Irish, the focus now shifts to breaking down tape of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, who clinched an automatic bid by beating Butler in the Horizon League conference champi­onship Tuesday. 
The two teams have never played each other, and the only common foe they had in 2002­03 was Valparaiso, whom Notre Dame beat by two and Wisconsin-Milwaukee beat by 14. 
A veteran team that relies heavily on a full-court press, Brey said the Irish will spend most of their time focusing on their first-round foe and not looking ahead to any potential second-round matchups. 
"We have our hands full on the first night," Brey said. "They've got a real good pro­gram over there. I think the focus is just going to be on us and just get familiar with them." 
Tickets for Notre Dame's first-and second-round games in the RCA Dome cost $135 for the lower arena and $105 for the upper arena. Because University officials only have a handful of tickets for distribu­tion through the school, offi­cials are encouraging fans to obtain tickets through Ticketmaster, either online at www.ticketmaster.com or by calling (574) 272-7979.

After Carroll scored the first 
seven points of the half for the 
Irish, Dan Miller added a free­
throw and a 3-point play to 
bring the Irish within 14. 
The Red Storm and Irish exchanged baskets for a few minutes, but a 3-pointer by Thomas, followed by a Miller jumper after a Red Storm charge, brought the Irish back to within seven at 7 5-68. 
"(We were] more aggressive driving the ball in the second half," Miller said. "I think we just moved the ball a lot better in the second half. We didn't force that many shots, [which] helped us defensively as well. When we're patient on offense it helps our defense." 
The Irish cut the Red Storm lead to live at 80-75 with just over two minutes remaining in the game, setting up the gut­wrenching finale. 
The loss, Notre Dame's fourth in its last five games, gave the Irish some motivation in the extended break between the conference and national postseason tourna­ments. 
"It's a long season, but to come down and lose these last couple of games in the Big East ... yeah, it's tough, but you know what?" Carroll said. "The off week of rest is going to help us, and we're going to bounce back and have a strong NCAA Tournament, where everybody's got a clean slate. We've just got to move on and play better basket­ball."

Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS 
The NCAA will consider postponing games in the men's and women's basket­ball tournaments and other national championships if war with Iraq begins this week. 
President Myles Brand acknowledged Monday for the first time that the NCAA was checking the availabili­ty of arenas and hotels for the days after first and sec­ond-round games are scheduled to be completed. That would give the offi­cials more flexibility in making a decision about postponements. 
"We don't know when it will start, and we have to be respectful of our men and women in uniform," Brand said following an NCAA town hall meeting on sportsmanship that was sponsored by Indianapolis television station WISH. 
"On the other hand, I think we have to be very careful not to let Saddam Hussein control our lives. We have to balance those," he said. 
The primary considera­tion, Brand said, would be the safety of the athletes and fans. 
Brand said his office has been in contact with the Homeland Security Department and security officials as it finishes con­tingency plans. He declined to give details, saying they would be announced as events take place. 

He also said there has been no determination about changes in television coverage. 
CBS holds the rights to the men's tournament, but the network, which is owned by Viacom, has dis­cussed switching the games to ESPN if CBS needs more air time for war coverage. 
ESPN and ESPN2 already are scheduled to show the women's tournament. NCAA vice president Donna Noonan said Sunday she had been assured by ESPN that the women's games would not be affected. 
If a deal cannot be reached with ESPN, the games could be shown on other Viacom-owned net­works such as such as MTV, UPN, BET or TNN. 
"We're doing a lot of planning, but we don't know what direction it will go," Brand said. 
The NCAA men's tourna­ment would be the first big sports event affected by any conflict in Iraq. The first game, between North Carolina-Asheville and Texas Southern, is sched­uled for Tuesday night in Dayton, Ohio.

After struggling in its first tournament of the spring, tho womens golf team came oui fir­ing in Florida over break. 
Leading the way was fresh­man Katie Brophy who parred the final two holes to win the Peggy Kirk Bell Invitational in Orlando. 
Brophy fired rounds of 73 and 7 4 to win by one shot over Penn State's Katie Futcher and Cynthia Skilton Penn State. 
"Katie told me right before the start of today's round that she felt like something just clicked," Irish coach Debby King said. "She had a great swing the last two days." 
"The thing that clicked for me was my putting," said Brophy. "I didn't putt very well in the fall and that's what I was known for in high school. Everything dropped for me the last two days. I got my confi­dence back." 
The event came down to the last hole and Brophy needed a 12-foot par putt on the last hole for the win. She took her time before making the winning shot. 
"I didn't know exactly where I was going into 18," she said. "I just wanted to par it. I got near the green and put my second shot about 12-feet away. I knew I had made those before and I just said to myself, 'Just do it,' and then I stood over it awhile to focus." 
Brophy became the first Irish golfer to win a tournament since current junior Rebecca Rogers won the Notre Dame Invitational in 2000. As a team, the Irish finished eighth with rounds of 314 and 317 for a 631. 


Sophomore Karen Lotta and freshman Lauren Gebauer fired identical rounds of 156 (78-78) to aid the Irish team effort, \vith freshman Suzie Hayes one stroke behind them at 157 (76­81). 
Following their performance in Orlando, the Irish traveled to Tampa for the Northern Illinois Snowbird Invitational where they fired a season best 297 to tie for third. Notre Dame was led by senior captain Terri Taibl who shot the two best rounds of her career to tie for fourth at 149 (75-74), only four strokes away f'rom giving the Irish their second winner in as many tournaments. 
Gebauer and fellow freshman Sarah Bassett also recorded top 10 finishes for the Irish at the Snowbird by tying for seventh at 152. Gebauer fired rounds of 77 and 75 while Bassett shot 78 and 7 4 as an individual entrant. 
Junior Shannon Byrne also had a good showing, finishing at 153 (78-75 as an individual entrant. Brophy followed up her win with a 156 (82-74) to tie for 22nd. 
The Irish play next March 23­25 at the Baylor University Tapito Springs Shoot-Out in Boerne. Texas.

Wann weather equals hot streak for Irish over break 
By CHRIS FEDERICO Spores Writer 
With snow on the ground and a chill in the air, the Irish left the wintry conditions of South Bend for a seven-game. eight­day road trip to Florida during spring break for the Kennel Club Classic. 
The warm weather stint paid dividends for Notre Dame as the team went 6-1 during the span to improve to 9-5 on the season. 
The opportunity to hit the field every day helped the Irish return to the level of play they demonstrated during last year's College World Series run. The Irish batted .307 as a team dur­ing the trip, led by second base­man Steve Sollmann's .482 average during the seven-game span. 
Other Irish batters leading the effort were catcher Javy Sanchez, who contributed a .407 average during the trip, and infielder Matt Edwards and outfielder Kris Billmaier, who each batted .393 with 11 hits and collectively recorded 15 RBIs. 
Irish pitchers, meanwhile, began to establish themselves on the mound by posting a 2.37 staff ERA for the week with a .185 opponent batting average. 
Notre Dame 3, Vanderbilt 1 
The Irish kicked off their spring break trip with a hard­fought 10-inning victory over the Commodores. 
Sophomore Chris Niese! held the Commodores at bay until the Irish bats could get going, allowing only one run and three hits over eight innings before reliever J.P. Gagne came in to pitch two perfect innings to earn the win. 
The powerful right-hander Gagne struck out four Vanderbilt hitters in two innings to earn his second vic­tory of the season. 
The difference for the Irish came off the bat of freshman outfielder Brennan Grogan in the top of the 10th. After Sollmann reached on a single, Grogan smacked a triple to the gap in right center for the even­tual game-winning run. 
Notre Dame 7, Navy 3 
After a rainout of Sunday's action, the Irish returned to the field Monday with a potent and balanced offensive attack to knock off the Midshipmen. 
After falling behind 3-0 in the third inning, Notre Dame responded in the bottom of the fourth with three runs of their own to tie the score. After Edwards was hit by a pitch and Billmaier doubled to put run­ners at second and third, sophomore shortstop Matt Macri smacked a two-run dou­ble to bring the Irish within one run. Sanchez then singled to center to bring in Macri with the game-tying score. 
After yielding the three early runs, sophomore John Axford held Navy at bay in two more scoreless innings to eventually earn the win, his second of the year. 
Notre Dame got the go-ahead run in the fifth inning, when Edwards singled in freshman Craig Cooper. The Irish would add three more for the victory. 
Notre Dame 6, North Florida 1 
In their third game of the break, the Irish received two more strong offensive perfor­mances from Sollmann and Edwards as the pair went 5-for­9 in the game with two runs scored and two RB[s. 
Clinging to a 2-1 lead in the sixth, the Irish would add four runs in the last three frames, capped by Edwards' two-run home run in the top of the ninth to seal the victory for the Irish. 
Senior pitcher Ryan Kalita contributed a strong outing for his first win of the season, allowing only one run and three hits in seven innings pitched. 
Jacksonvllle 9, Notre Dame 6 
The Irish got their only taste of defeat of the Kennel Club Classic at the hands of Jacksonville in a tough 10­inning loss. 
Notre Dame fell behind early, yielding four-first inning runs and another in the third to dig themselves into a 5-0 hole. The Irish fought back from the deficit and narrowed the lead to 6-4 in the eighth inning. 
Notre Dame appeared to take control in the top of the ninth with Sanchez's two-run, game­tying home run with nobody out. But the Irish did nothing else in the inning and the game went to extra innings. 
In the top of the 10th, the Irish had the bases loaded with two outs but freshman Greg Lopez struck out swinging to end the inning. 
With Gagne on in relief in the 10th, Jacksonville got a leadofl single from left fielder Chad Hauseman. With two outs in the inning, Gagne walked right fielder Chad Hart before third baseman Brett Nagy ended the game with a three-run, walk-off homer. 
Notre Dame 3, Eastem Illinois 2 
The Irish returned to their winning ways the next day with a 3-2 victory over Eastern Illinois. 
Sollmann, who was 2-for-2 on the day. gave Notre Dame an early 3-0 lead with his three-run inside-the-park home run in the second. 
That lead would be enough for Niese!, who contributed a dominating performance on the mound for the Irish. The right-hander allowed two runs -both unearned -over eight innings and had nine strike­outs. 
Gagne came on with two outs in the ninth and faced one bat­ter, whom he struck out, to get his third save of the season. 
Notre Dame 11, Navy 2 
Notre Dame's second matchup with the Midshipmen in the Kennel Club Classic would prove as successful as the first for the Irish as six Irish hitters collected multiple hits as Notre Dame pounded Navy. 
The Irish plated 11 runs on 16 hits as a team led again by the efforts of Billmaier and Edwards, who finished a com­bined 6-for-9 at the plate with five RBIs and four runs scored. 
Freshman Tom Thornton earned the victory for the Irish in his first career start, logging four shutout innings and allowing only three hits. 
Notre Dame 10, Creighton 3 
The Irish wrapped up play in Florida with a solid victory over the Blue Jays that was indicative of their style of play through much of the week. 
Notre Dame utilized a bal­anced offensive attack with 10 runs on 14 hits and strong pitching from Axford and a cast of relievers. 
Axford had some early trou­ble with Creighton in the first inning when he allowed his only two runs of the game. The tall right-hander would then cruise through the next five innings by allowing only two more hits and getting seven strikeouts. 
The Irish quickly matched Creighton's pair of runs with two of their own in the bottom of the first. Sollmann and Grogan got the offense going with a pair of leadoff singles, followed by an RBI double form Edwards. Billmaier then hit a sacrifice f'ly to score Grogan and Lie the game at 2­2. 
In their next inning, the Irish jumped on top for good with four runs on three hits to grab an early 6-2 lead. 
Sollmann. Edwards and 
Billmaier led the way at the 
plate by going 3-for-5, 3-for-4 
and 2-for-2. respectively, while 
combining for six RBIs and 
four runs scored.

Irish slump early, respond late, but still fall short in the end in 83-80 loss to St. John's in first round ofBig East Tournament 
By BRYAN KRONK 
Sports Wricer 

NEW YORK 
Notre Dame's dominant second half was not enough to overcome St. John's' strong first half, and the Irish fell to the Red Storm in the first round of the Big East Tournament, 83-80, Wednesday at Madison Square Garden. 
The Irish were unable to recover from a 21-point halftime deficit -a deficit that climbed to 23 points in the second half -despite shooting 66.7 percent from the field in the second half.

NCAAs" 
The Irish seemed poised for an amazing page 17 comeback when Matt Carroll hit a 3-pointer with just over a minute left in the game to bring the Irish to within two points at 82-80. 
After forcing the Red Storm to take a bad shot with the shot clock winding down, the Irish called a timeout with 
24.2 seconds remaining to draw out their final play. 
Guard Chris Thomas took the ball and drove to the hoop, but his layup missed. Luckily for the Irish, Torin Francis grabbed the rebound and went back up with the ball. 
His layup seemed destined for the bot­tom of the net as the whistle blew, but

No upsets for Irish in Pittsburgh win, 'Nova loss 
By JOE HETTLER 
Sports E<licor 
Notre Dame didn't get upset at the Big East Tournament, but they didn't upset anyone either. 
The sixth-seeded Irish defeated No. 11 seed Pittsburgh 73-65 in the first round March 8 before losing to No. 2 seed Villanova 50­39 March 9. 
After winning their first game, Notre Dame hoped to upset Villanova for the second time this season. They had defeated the Wildcats 58-56 at Villanova Jan. 25. 
But the Irish couldn't shake a horrible shooting slump that plagued them throughout the game, and fell short against the eventual tournament champions. 
In the first half, the Irish shot 6­for-23, or 26.1 percent, which was actually better than Villanova's· 4-for-24, 17 percent performance. Both teams' poor shooting caused the game to be tied at 13 at halftime. 
"I thought that was some type of Guinness Book of Records first half," Notre Dame coach Muffet McGraw said. 
The Irish continued their bad shooting in the second half, while the Wildcats pulled away by mak­ing 12-24 shots. 
"It was a bad shooting night," Villanova guard Trish Juhline said. "But that happens. We played hard the whole game and made shots down the end." 
Juhline had 12 of her 14 points in the second half to lead the Wildcats. Teammate Nicole Druckenmiller also contributed 10 points. 
Notre Dame was led by Jacqueline Batteast's 15 points, while Courtney LaVere added 12. Alicia Ratay, who usually aver­ages 12 points per game, was held scoreless on just 0-of-5 shooting. 
Villanova went on to defeat No. 1 Connecticut to win the Big East Tournament. The Huskies' loss was their first in 70 games. 

Against Pittsburgh, the Irish picked up a win that sealed their NCAA Tournament berth. The Irish had four players score in double figures, led by LaVere's 18 points on 8-of-10 shooting. Ratay added 16 points and nailed 10-of­11 free throws. 
The game was somewhat slop­py, as the two teams combined for 42 fouls and 56 free throws. 
Pittsburgh took their first lead of the second half at 39-38 with 
17:23 to play. 

But the Irish responded with a Batteast layup on their next pos­session and never trailed again. 
Notre Dame extended its lead to as many as 14 with 7: 17 left before Pittsburgh made one final 11-3 run to cut the lead to six. 
But the Irish held on down the stretch and improved to 11-3 in games decided by 10 points or less this season. It was also Notre Dame's fourth straight win. 
The No. 11 seed in the East, the Irish will head to Manhattan, Kan. for a first round NCAA Tournament game against No. 6 seed Arizona March 23 at 7 p.m. The Wildcats are 22-8 on the sea­son.
