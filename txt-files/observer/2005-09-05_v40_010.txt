Professors return safely from N el'V Orleans 
Zachman and Chambers grateful to be back at SMC after hurricane stranded them in hotel 
By MEGAN O'NEIL Saint Mary's Editor 
Caught in thn fury of llurricann Katrina and then stranded in their Canal Street hotel by subsequent flooding. two Saint Mary's professors finally made it home Thursday and wnrn set to return to their dassroorns today. 
Spanish professor Jenniff1r Zachman and psychology pro­fessor Karnn Chambers spent thrfH~ days holed up in a Slwraton hotel with roughly 1,000 other stranded travelers, hotel employees, family mem­bers and pets waiting to be evacuated from New Orleans. 
The pair had been attending an Advance Placement Testing conference over the weekend along with Saint Mary's faculty members Mary Connolly and David Stefancic as Katrina approached and storm warn­ings began to be issued. 
"Hight then they started get­ting people out," Zachman said. "It was sheer luck of the draw who got out." 
Connolly and Stefandc were placed on flights out of the city before cancellations began, but Zachman and Chambers were forced to remain at the hotel. 
After initial moments of panic, Zachman said, the women resigned themselves to staying in New Orleans believ­ing they would be safe in the Sheraton. 
Following the hotel staff's instruction's, they filled their bathtub with water to use for hygienic purposes later, and then gathered with the rest of the guests Sunday at 8 p.m. in a ballroom on the fifth floor. 
"Everyone brought their blankets and pillows and we slept in there," Zachman said. 
"It was kind of at first like camping." 
Hotel manager Dan King had extended the hotel's hospitality to employees and their families unable to leave the city, Chambers said. 
"lie didn't just protect the tourists, he protected a lot of' people who couldn't get out of New Orleans," Chambers said. "I've told a lot of people this, I think the Sheraton literally saved my life." 
Zachman said there was a great sense of relief Monday

Kelley at vvork for President 
Professor is named as White House counsel 
By KATIE PERRY 
News Writer 
A Notre Dame associato law professor has madn the leap from Notre Damn Avnnue to Pennsylvania Avenue allnr land­ing a job in May as deputy Whito House counsel to President George W. Bush. 
William Kelley, a University faculty member since 1995, spe­cialized in administrative and constitutional law before being oll'ered the highly ranknd govern­mnntal job last spring. lie follows the lead of fellow Notre Dame law professor Jimmy Gurulo, who also served under President Bush from 2001 to 2003. 
Professor Riek Garnett, a col­league of Kelley's at the Notre Dame law school. said the appointment was to be expectod given Kellny's legal expertise. 
"Beeause of Professor Knlley's experience, credentials and legal judgment, I don't think any of us who know him were surprised when the Administration asked him to serve in this important position," he said. "I know that Professor Kelley felt honored by the appointment and enthusiastic about the ehance to eontributo and to immerse himsnlf' in so many ehallnnging legal prob­lems." 
Kelley joins an army of Notrn Dame professors and graduates who have gone on to hold power­ful positions in Washin~-,rton. Most notably, current Secretary of State Condoleezza Hice-a 1975

Male professors play vital role at College 
Editor's note: The is the last in a three part series exploring the role of men at Saint Mary's. 
By NICOLE ZOOK Assistant News Editor 
While some may see the all­fnmale environment at Saint Mary's as unusual in today's world of co-ed eollnges and nven co-Pd dormitories, philos­ophy professor Kevin McDonnell says he knows the value of a single-sex education -he attended an all-male school for his undergraduate eourses. 
"In the mid-1960s there were 300 women's colleges and 
at least as many men's col­leges," McDonnell said. "I dated women from sevnral women's schools and respected them and their education." 

· While the Arnnriean public's outlook on single-snx colleges had changed by the time MeDonrwll was hired as faculty at the College a few years later, he viewed Saint Mary's not as outdated in a quickly dwindling field of all-women's colleges but as an opportunity to edu­eatn students in a different kind of environment. 
"By the time I came to Saint Mary's, soon after the merger negotiations with Notre Dame had broken down, almost every

Significance of sport 
In the aftermath of the deadly hurri­cane Katrina, insignificant as it may sound, I thought about sports. I sat in my sports-adorned dorm room ready to sign up for interhall sports, eager to take a road trip to Ann Arbor for a football game and Tom Dorwart excited to experience

game. Less than a week after perhaps the most catastrophic event in United States history, I-along with the rest of Notre Dame -cheered on the Irish to victory over Pitt. 
And I wondered -should we feel guilty for having fun, eating pizza and caring so much about sports? I thought about the meaning and importance of sports, the reason we still watch Sportscenter or play two-hand-touch football on the quad. Then, I realized, we need sports. Sports still matter. 
Last week's chaos put a new perspec­tive on sports -on life, itself, for that matter-much in the same way 9/11 and the tsunami in Asia did. We should reflect on the tragedy -pray for the vic­tims and those helping with relief efforts and donate money at our dorm Masses, home football games and other events. It seems, even hundreds of miles away from the stricken area, that enough can't be done. 
Still, sports matter. 

More than ever, Louisianans will be New Orleans Saints fans-they will show their resolve and passion if, some­how, their shaken Saints win their season opener this week. No doubt, the people without a town will take pride in their teams. They don't have homes, but they'll watch-ifthey can -Southern Mississippi take on Alabama, LSU battle Arizona State and Tulane face Mississippi State this weekend and next. 
"We need this season," Tulane quarter­back Lester Ricard said in an espn.com article. "I think that will be the ultimate joy, to see us do well this season." 
To Tulane president Scott Cowen, "doing well," at this point, goes beyond winning. Wms would be a mere bonus. 
"We want our athletes to carry the torch, face and name of Tulane University during this difficult time," Cowen said. 
It's quite the undertaking, but the ath­letes are more than willing to accept it. 
"It's something that we want to do for New Orleans," Green Wave linebacker Antonio Mason said. "A lot of people look at us as not only reps of Tulane, but of New Orleans. People can look at us and say, 'Wow, look at that team; they're going on the road, going through all that adversity, and still getting the job done."' 
Thlane coach Chris Scelfo called the country to "rally" behind New Orleans, saying while his players are worried about missing family members, the "game will be, not so much competition, but a release, a distraction." 
So, don't feel guilty for playing catch on the quad or watching the Irish this week­end. Coaches always say sports teach players and fans about life, about team­work and about working towards a goal. Now, in the midst of tragedy, sports seem like more than that. They are the very "release" which helps us through chal­lenging times. 
When the world seems, as it did last Monday, like it's about to come to a halt, the sports world keeps spinning -as it should.

Man finds venomous giant centipede in Britain 
LONDON -Aaron Balick expected to find a tiny mouse stirring around behind the 1V in his apart­ment. Instead, he found a venomous giant centipede that somehow made its way from South America to Britain. 
He trapped the 9-inch­long creature between a stack of books and put it in a plastic container. 
"Thinking it was a mouse, I went to investigate the sound," Balick said Wednesday. "The sound was coming from under some papers which I lifted, expecting to see the mouse scamper away. 
"Instead, when I lifted the papers, I saw this prehis­toric looking animal skitter away behind a stack of books." 
The next day Balick, 32, took it to Britain's Natural History Museum, which identified the insect as a Scolopendra gigantea -the world's biggest species of centipede. 
Humans on exhibit in London Zoo

FedEx Kinko's opens on catnpus 
By LISA SCHULTZ News Writer 
Notre Dame students, faculty and staff can now meet their copy needs quickly -and more cheaply than ever -at tlH1 campus' new FedEx Kinko's. 
Last spring, a campus com­mittee researched ways to pro­vide copy services more cl'fi­ciently at the request of Executive Vice President John Aflleck-Graves. Members carne up with a revamping of all copy services on campus and the addition of FedEx Kinko's -a solution that "translates to a lower cost per copy for Notre Dame students, faculty and staff," said Dan Skendzel, director of Administrative Services and Business Operations. . While copy centers in Deeio, O'Shaugnessey and Mendoza will remain open, the live copy centers on campus operatnd by different University depart­ments and Copy Wright, Inc.'s Copy Shop in LaFortune are dosed or will be dosing. 
"It is much more eflieient to have one entity operating copy centers on campus," Skendzel said. 
A new FedEx Kinko's is cur­rently located in Grace Ilall and will be renting another location in the space currently occupied by Copy Wright, Inc. in LaFortune beginning around fall break, said Matthew Erste, FedEx Kinko's major account manager. 
Skendzel said the University looked into several options for

new printing services on cam­pus before deciding on FedEx Kinko's. 
"FedEx Kinko's was the suc­cessful bidder of three compa­nies that submitted proposals," Skendzel said. "FedEx Kinko's was the most compelling in terms of expertise, service and pricing." 
Even though some ·course packets will still be available though the O'Shaugnessy copy shop, FndEx Kinko's provides a network that allows for course packets to be bought along with regular books at the book­store. Course packets will be available for purchase on insideND and can be picked up at the FedEx Kinko's State Road 23 location ofT campus, Grace llall, LaFortune or the Hammes Notre Dame Bookstore. 
"We've tried to sngnwnt tlw market needs but also makn tho campus community awarn that each of theso locations is essnntially interchangnabln," Skendznl said.

school was rushing to go co­ed," McDonnell said. "Saint Mary's offered a wonderful opportunity to take part in rebuilding a great school and to preserve a diverse kind of institution. While there were certainly differences between single-sex male and single-sex female schools, there was also a great similarity in that no one was putting on a show for what I will call extracurricular bene­fits. Students could be quite frank in class. In contrast to the co-ed college in which I had been teaching, the atmosphere was freer. Also, women partici­pated in class -if the women didn't, who would?" 
It's a woman's world 
Most male professors on campus agree with McDonnell that there are benefits to sin­gle-sex education. Thomas Parisi, a psychology professor at the College since 1980, is one of those professors, though he said teaching at Saint Mary's was "challenging at first." 
"At this point, I would find it odd -and an adjustment -to be in a co-ed classroom," he said. "Young men are more likely to spout on even when they don't have much to say. A dangerous generalization, I know. Let me temper it by say­ing that, as time goes on, most people talk too much, men and women alike. Seriously, though, I think that a product of socialization in high school and grade school is still that boys are reinforced for talking, and girls for fading to. the background. Which is one rea­son why there is still a valid argument to be made for sin­gle sex education."

"A number of our faculty have served in important Executive Branch positions in recent years," Garnett said. "Our faculty, and our students, should be proud that Professor Kelley was select­ed for a position that involves what is one of the most diverse and difficult portfolios of any legal job in government." 
Garnett said Kelley's new role in the office of Counsel to the President requires him to advise the president on all legal matters and on the legal implication of all policy matters in which the White House has a stake or interest. 
"Basically, the Counsel's office has to advise the President about nearly everything," Garnett said. 
Kelley has the task of ensuring advice given to the President is "developed well and delivered effectively," Garnett said. More specifically, the Counsel's office handles matters of judicial nomi­nations and presidential appoint­ments, pardons and clemency, ethical questions, veto decisions and official-capacity lawsuits against the President. 
The recent promotion is Kelley's latest in an extensive his­tory of occupational experience in Washington. In addition to serv-

Saint Mary's newest male addition, music professor Daniel Party, said he feels Saint Mary's is a good learning environment because of those benefits. 
"In a mixed-sex environ­ment, men and women tend to fall first into traditional gender roles, and only later individual personalities arise," he said. "Without the gender divide, their personalities come out earlier, and it's nice to have female students taking roles that are traditionally occupied by men, like being a leader or 
a  clown,  to  name  two  
extremes."

ferent without men. I'm not sure I ever came up with a sat­isfactory answer to that ques­tion," he said. "Perhaps I had too little experience in mixed classrooms, or perhaps I'm remarkably insensitive. My hunch is that teachers in the sciences might notice more radical differences. I think women historically have been strong in the humanities, so perhaps we notice it less." 
Svelmoe also said the all­female environment is positive for empowering women. 
"Recent research has shown that women even at the lower levels are much more assertive in the classroom now than they used to be, demonstrating that the focus during the past several decades on helping girls assert themselves aca­demically has worked," he said. "Some are even talking now about needing to get boys into all boys' academic envi­ronments to 'protect' them from assertive girls. Go fig­ure." 
Ted Billy, a longtime profes­sor in the College's English department, has taught at not one but two women's colleges, which he said led him to believe strongly in the impor­tance of women's education.

has "come to see the great value of the single sex environment." 
"When I was first touring the campus I was going through the scene shop and a student was welding some steel. The student wore a large mask and the sparks were flying as the job was completed. At that point the worker lifted the mask and, to my surprise, was a young woman," he said. "The fact that I was surprised and that I real­ized that in this environment I should not be surprised by such an occurrence went a long way toward helping me to realize the value of studying theater at a women's college." 
Most male professors say their time at Saint Mary's has altered their views on women's issues. 
"Of course, my views on women's issues must have changed, but I have been here long enough that I would put it differently: my views have been shaped in many significant ways by the culture I have been embedded in for the past 25 years," Parisi said. 
History profes­
sor David Stefancic believes in it so deeply that he recently sent his daughter, Regina, to Saint Mary's. 
"My daughter just graduated from SMC last May and loved the experience," he said. "It was great seeing her grow in confidence while here." 
Lessons of ther own 
While Stefancic is teaching the women of Saint Mary's, he said they have also taught him in his time here. 
"Since coming to SMC I have become a better listener, which is oftentimes what my students need. They are great problem solvers but they often need a sounding board for their ideas," he said. "I just received a copy of a book written by one of my ·former students and she credits my mentoring for accomplishing this. I felt rather humbled."

"I will admit that I've become a real supporter of women's education through what I've experienced here," Svelmoe said. "That doesn't mean I'm marching in the streets ... but from what I've seen of the experience of young women here in the classrooms, in ath­letics, in student government ... well, let's just say I hope places like Saint Mary's always exist." 
presented to 
male profes­sors teaching at an all-women's college, the Saint Mary's pro­fessors seem to step up to the plate and swing their hardest. 
"I guess I have learned that the great Tom Hanks line, 'There's no crying in baseball' doesn't apply to a college," Svelmoe said. "I haven't learned yet how to deal with the weeping student in my office." 
Party, who just began to deal with those challenges, said that while he does "find it challeng­ing to try to think like a 19­year-old woman," he is not nec­essarily shocked or over­whelmed by the all-female environment. 
However, Party said he does get ribbed by friends when they find out he teaches at Saint Mary's. 
"I do get laughs and jokes from friends regarding teach­ing at a women's college," he said. "It's always the same joke: "Lucky you!"

ing as clerk for Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Associate Justice Antonio Scalia, Kelley worked in the office of Kenneth Starr during the his­toric President Clinton impeach­ment trial of 1999. Kelley also served in the Department of Justice from 1991 to 1993, work­ing as assistant to the solicitor general. 
A.J. Bellia, a pr<lfessor in the Notre Dame law school, called Kelley's most recent appointment an "honor." 
"Professor Kelley is a shining example of how the relentless pursuit of competence and serv­ice combine to produce the best that the legal profession has to offer," Bellia said. 
A 1984 graduate of Marquette University, Kelley earned his degree in law from Harvard University in 1987 before joining the Law School faculty in 1995. This year, U.S. News & World Report ranked Notre Dame No. 24 on its annual list of top law programs nationwide. 
"The appointment testifies to Professor Kelley's brilliance and devotion to public service," Bellia said. "It also reflects well upon our law school's reputation for excellence and commitment to public service." 
Garnett hopes Kelley will return to Notre Dame and share his new privileged perspective with his colleagues. 
"We at the law school are proud of Professor Kelley, and look forward to his return, so we can learn whether the real West Wing is like the one on NBC," he said.

and plan outdoor courses for the 2005-06 school year. 
Gallagher, who has exten­sive wilderness training, is beginning his second year at the College. Though schools in the area -including Saint Mary's -promote intramural sports with a high success rate, Gallagher said he was surprised to find that none available at the College offered any kind of outdoor recreation. 
Kachmarik said outdoor adventures are a terrific way for women to exercise and enjoy themselves. 
"What a great way to show our women, 'Look, there [are) a lot of things you can do outside,"' she said. "This is such a beautiful area· with so many opportunities to do some different things." 
Though these new oppor­tunities are collectively list­ed in the Saint Mary's course book as 'Introduction to Outdoor Sports,' they are actually individual activities and are not offered for cred­it, Gallagher said. Gallagher and Kachmarik are continu­ing to measure student interest in each activity. 
Gallagher said that while initially he was concerned that word of the hike would not spread quickly enough to garner participation from already busy students, he was enthused by student response to Sunday's hike. 
"I thought it was pretty good considering it was the 

first weekend of school," he 
·said. "I hope the results will be [as positive for] the rest of the trips, too," 
Other activities scheduled through early December include an overnight cycling and camping trip on the Illinois and Michigan Canal State Trail Sept. 10-11, a canoeing and kayaking trip down the River Country Heritage Water Trail Sept. 18, indoor climbing at Climb Kalamazoo in Michigan Nov. 6 and downhill

"Fifteen women [signed up for] the hike Sund{Ly, and so we could have 15 very dif­ferent women [who] want to go on the canoeing trip and kayaking trip," Kachmarik said. 
Freshman Taryn Pabst, who attended the hike with some of her neighbors and roommate from McCandless Hall, said she enjoyed the trip and is likely to partici­pate in more outdoor cours­es this year. 
"The hike overall was a lot of fun and I thought every­one came well-prepared," Pabst said. "I would defi­nitely take advantage of department's main priority is catering to the women of Saint Mary's, Kachmarik is open to the idea of male participants if the activity is not overnight.

safely and responsibility, and with curiosity to further educate themselves about each activity," Gallagher wrote in his course description. 
Kachmarik also stressed the opportunities these activities provide for stu­dents. 
"My feeling is ... it's a great option for those stu­dents [in that] it's not all about partying," she said. "This is a perfect alternative to a different social life than what has typically been offered at Saint Mary's on a Saturday night."

were glued to television sets -and Irish eyes were smil­ing. 
Freshman Alex Gonzalez, who went between his dorm and the North Quad to watch the game, was among the crowd of adrenaline-packed fans. 
"That was Irish football at its best," he said. "It was good payback from last year. [Tyler] Palko took a beating. It was awesome." 
"We never questioned the play calls," said senior Vince Lyzinski, who made the trip to Pittsburgh to support the team. He said there were about as many Irish fans as Panthers fans at the game. 
''I'd say it was 50-50," he said. 
Much of the Irish fan sec­tion was comprised of hun­dreds of members of the Notre Dame Alumni Club of Pittsburgh and current stu­dents who braved high gas prices and a six-hour drive to get to the game. Pumping up the crowd was the Band of the Fighting Irish, which chose the season opener as the first of its two away game trips. 
Cindi Sulzbach, a freshman band member, said the stu­dent section was extremely supportive. 
"Our offense was amazing ... [All the Pittsburgh fans] left after halftime. There 
were  all green shirts," she  
said.  
  


Like many at Notre Dame, Lyzinski and Sulzbach have high hopes for the team's future. Both said Saturday night's game just helped to affirm what they already felt. 
"I've had them winning the national championship since day one," Lyzinski said. 
While thinking about a championship may be prema­ture, it is already in the minds of the students, and the atmosphere on campus following the game shows students are as pumped as ever for the upcoming season. 
"They say that after they re-gild the Dome we win a National Championship," Sulzbach said. 
Notre Dame head coach Charlie Weis also earned instant praise for his debut on the college field. 
"Everybody likes the way Weis is running the offense," sophomore Brandon Carroll said. "lie was taking care of [the mistakes] on the side­lines. lfe 's strict." 
Junior Thomas Flowers also said he liked the way Weis handled the team in his first game and believes Weis will continue to lead Notre Dame to victory. 
"The play calling was vastly improved ... The game was a morale booster. There's a lot more emotion on the side­lines," Flowers said. "We can't let up, especially against Michigan and USC. [Weisl won't settle for the players doing anything less than the best. He runs a busi­ness."

IN BRIEF 
Crude oil and gasoline end lower 
NEW YOHK -Crude-oil and gasoline futuros fell hard Friday, as traders who profitnd enormously on the supply crunch following Hurricane Katrina eashed out of the marknt ahead of the long weekend. 
"There are traders who made so mueh monoy this week, they won't have to punch another lieket for tho rest of this year," said Addison Armstrong, manager of exchange­tradod markets for TFS Energy Futures LLC, a brokerage in Stamford, Conn. 
Tho abbreviatod trading session, which ended <Ln hour and a half early in obser­vaneo of Monday's Labor Day holiday, proved a good time to book profits amid signs of major supply relief, traders said. 
Benehmark light, sweet crude oil futures for Octobnr settled down $1.90 at $67.57 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exehange, about $1.50 above pre-Katrina priens. 
Economic concerns intensify 
NEW YOHK -Wall Street slogged through an uneven session Thursday, fin­ishing mixed as investors grappled with troubling consumer spending patterns, slower growth from the manufacturing soctor and the latest news of Hurricane Katrina's damago.

Katrina takes a toll at the pumps 
Holiday weekend travelers opt to carpool as gas prices soar over $3 per gallon 
Associated Press 
Traffic was light on Atlanta highways Saturday and gas stations that were fortunate enough to have fuel were still charging more than $3 a gallon. In West Virginia, 10 percent of stations ran out of at least one grade of gas. And in Colorado, motorists were encouraged to drive less. 
The holiday weekond got ol'f' to a bumpy start for some travelers as the after­math of llurrieane Katrina eon tin ued to take its toll at the pump in many parts of the country live days after the storm ripped through · the Gulf Coast.

For thoso who did plan to lake trips, seattored fuel shortages causqd in part by panicked drivers topping ofT their tanks and record-high prices at stations that did have gas weren't making things fun on the nation's roads.

My name is Peter Schroeder, and I'm from a town. No, I'm not from a suburb, or from "around" anywhere. I'm from a town. 
Beginning with Freshman Orientation, we all know the experi­ences of introduc­tions. 1. Your name, 2. Your major, 3. Your dorm, 4. Where you're from. The first three ques­tions are gimmes. Everybody knows where Dillon Hall is, or what a Marketing major does (and no, it's not nothing, funny man). but with that last one, it's all up for grabs. Being that Notre Dame is a national campus with students from across the country and the world, one always answers that last question with an assumption in mind. One always assumes that this person is from somewhere far, far away from your home, and one must be as gener­al as possible. 
Why be general? If you have to ask, you're not from a town. In the begin­ning of a towner's college career, the optimism and pride of their homeland is evident. Ask a freshman where they're from, and they'll tell you the name of their town. its approximate distance from the nearest place you may have heard of, and then draw you a topographical map on your forearm. 
However, the life of a towner is a grueling one. Every single time some­one asks where you're f~;om, you have to submit yourself to the Spanish Inquisition, as people try to ascertain where your stupid shack in the woods is. The name of your town is always

met with the same blank stare that says, "I have never heard of that place; therefore, I hate you." 
Eventuallyyou'll see some town.ers who have just given up, the ones that are perfectly willing to lambaste their own town before you can. Ask them where they're from, and you usually get responses like, "Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, you've never heard of it," or "Prophetstown, Illinois, it's just a rinky-dink town in the middle of nowhere," or "Milburn, New Jersey, it smells funny." These people are ones who.have given up on their towns, and it's only a matter of time until they forgo naming their town at all and opting for vague geographical generalities. 
The best example of these generali­ties is the "near Chicago" squad. While Notre Dame is a national cam­pus, a large chunk of its student body hails from the Midwest, especially Illinois. As such, when going around and telling hometowns, there is prob­ably a one in five chance that some­body will be from "near Chicago." 
Alright, near Chicago, that must be near Chicago, right? Well, that's what you would think. "Near Chicago" basi­cally is a term that translates to "the Central Time Zone, possibly Mountain." People who claim to live in this abundantly populated area could live as much as three hours from Chicago, and still claim their nearness. People, it's time to stop hid­ing in the shadow of the Sears Tower. Embrace your townitude! 
I have a confession to make; I too was once part of the "nearest recog­nizable name" rabble, although Pittsburgh was my crutch. In Theology 100 my freshman year, we had to go around the room and intro­duce ourselves in the standard boiler­plate fashion. It got to me, and fearing the blank stares of unfamiliarity with my backwoods village, I took the easy way out and said, "Pittsburgh." 
Of course, in Theology, there was no­way the Big Man was going.to let me get away with that one. Two student introductions later, a girl stated that she too was from Pittsburgh. Naturally, our professor asked if we knew each other. The shame I felt, in Theology class no less! It was on that day I resolved; never again will I hide behind cities with NFL franchises and skyscrapers and Barnes and Nobles, and embrace my hometown. You've never heard of Johnstown, Pennsylvania? You better learn, because that's where I'm from! 
Towns have plenty to offer, even if they won't light the bulb above every­one's head. For example, my home­town, Johnstown, is the Flood Capital of the World, with historic floods in 1889, 1936, and 1977. It is also the filming location of the movie Slap Shot, and home of the world's steepest motorized vehicular inelined plane. No town is too small to not have something to be proud of. Hoople, Illinois, population 98, is home to the new University of Wisconsin football coach, Bret Bielema. 
So I say to you, Observer readers, don't hedge your bets anymore and just spit out the name ol' the nearest metropolis, get a hold of your town's name and never let go. Join me in the llght against townism, and let's defeat common town stereotypes. No, we don't all wear overalls, and no, we don't play jugs for fun. And for the last time, she's just my cousin.

It will eome in fi1ur installmenl<>. troating four closely related topies. The first concerns the issue of whether the University should be run as a commercial enterprise. 
Your presidency got oil" to an auspicious start with the announcement in early July that ND will part company with its com­mereial TV station WNDU. The reason quotnd in the South Bend Tribune is that commercial broadcasting "is not our busi­nnss ... What we do instead is run a uni­VIlrsity." The question at this point is how your adminis­

and biotedmology firms, for nxampl!l, often form allianees with universities in which research results are exchanged for the funding of equipment, graduate assis­tanL<>, and faculty supervision. While such arrangmnenL<> bring obvious benefits, the long-term result is that university rnsearch programs t1md to be dominated by commercial agendas. 
Another emerging problem comes with eompetition from a growing number of for-profit schools, particularly in the fields of business and medical technology. A rncent estimate is that for-profit schools eurmntly serve 600,000 students in this eountry alone. These students are eligible fi1r lilderal Poll granL<>. and often for state­sponsornd seholarships, which cuts into funds available for student support at non­profit institutions like ND. Admission poli­eies in career schools are shaped entirely by market forees, putting pressure on non­profit universities to follow suit. 
Consider also the burgeoning field of so-called "distanee education," whieh boils down to oiTering courses on-line. With an initial investment in digital equipment and photogenic faculty, an established univer­sity could draw tuition money from thou­sands upon thousands of students world­wide. Without the overhead of dassrooms and other campus facilities, distance edu­eation has the potential of being enor­mously profitable. Aecording to Derek Bok, former president of I larvard (in his recent Universities in the Marketplace), such prestigious universities as Columbia, Chieago, and Carnegie Mellon have already embarked on ventures of this sort. 
It would be naive to assume that ND is immune to economic pressures like these. Viewed from one perspective, ND has a product to sell (iL<> degree), a well-defined base of potential customers, and a skillful­ly managed marketing program to make the product attractive. In the abstract, it seems natural that ND be run in a way that maximizes effectiveness in the sale of its particular product. In practice, this 
would amount to running the University like a degree­granting business. 
Indeed, the University has several key components that seem to be run in this fash­ion already. Notable exam­ples are the Development Office and the Investment Office, which quite reason­ably are expected to show a healthy profit at the end of each accounting period. Examples of a different sort are Human Resources and the Controller's Office, which function more or less like their corporate counter­parts.

ofthe Controller, all revenue-generating operations of the University are held accountable to the bottom-line (consider Food Services and the Joyce Center). 
Also to be noted is the fact that many of the top officers of the University have a business background, and that the Board of Trustees tends to be dominated by busi­ness exeeutives. The net result is that a sizeable portion of the people responsible for setting University policy think and act like corporate executives. This can only add to the external forces acting to trans­form ND into a business enterprise. 
There is little likelihood, of course, that the University will ever be operated pri­marily to make a profit. This would void its tax-exempt status. More likely is that it will come to be managed exclusively in the manner of successful businesses, which is to say run according to a managerial model. This would amount, among other things, to treating its students like cus­tomers, its faeulty like employees, and its managers as ultimately responsible for its institutional well-being. 
There undoubtedly are some members of the University (mostly faculty) who feel we have gone too far along this path already. Others may differ. But all con­cerned parties should agree that the time is ripe for a comprehensive discussion of the extent to which the managerial model is compatible with our educational mis­sion. 
The point to be debated is not whether we need an efficiently managed Development Office, Investment Ollice and the like. Of course we do. The question at issue is whether, for purposes both of long-term planning and of day-by-day operation, the University should be con­ceived as an organiza­
with the conception of a ND education (and the degree symbolizing it) as a product. To be sure, there is a sense in which the training provided by a for-profit career school is a product. A diploma from such a program equips its holder to seek employment in the relevant field, which often is a benefit worth paying for. To some extent, the same may be said of professional training in law or business provided by ND and similar universities. Even in such fields, however, NO's sense of mission should extend beyond professional training. 
First and foremost, the goals of a ND education should be thought of in terms of the personal maturity of its students. This is the case without regard for field of spe­cialization. For engineers, scientists, and business people alike, growth in personal maturity is a matter of gaining life-skills like critical thinking, multicultural sensi­tivity, and responsible citizenship. In keep­ing with the intent of its C.S.C. founders, ND should also concentrate on the devel­opment of personal traits like compassion and humility, along with other virtues ingredient to a mature Catholic faith. 
The first reason for rejecting a business model of University governance is that life­skills of this sort simply are not products that can be exchanged on the market. Professional skills can be marketed to qualified buyers, and a university can be managed for efficiency in that transaction. But responsible citizenship, compassion, and such like, are not professional skills. The kind of edueation ND should bn intent on providing, accordingly, eannot be accommodated by a managerial model. 
Other reasons li1r rojoeting this model concern untoward side-ellixts that go along with its employment. .Consider, for example, ND's seemingly obsessive con­cern with publicity. not unlike that of a business intent on maintaining a favorable public appearanee. One may be exeused for wondering why, ~-,riven the quality of education it should be providing, the University is so preoccupied with a care­fully managed publk image. 
Another concern is the em~et of the busi­ness model upon grading. In the business world, success in selling a product hinges on customer satisfaetion. When the prod­uct is a university degree, iL<> perceived 
value is bound up with the quali­
major source of the current epi­
dmnic of grade inflation. 
A dosely rnlated matter is the need for a purveyor of a product to make a favorable impression on potential con­sumers. Under the business model, dass­rooms teachers are eommonly thought of as salespersons and evaluated aeeordingly. A problem with ND's current system of Teacher-Course Evaluations (TCEs) is that it measures eustomer satisf'aetion rather than success in imparting skills that are part of a sound education. This rnsuiL'i in teaehers being rewarded or penalized for reasons that might be extraneous to tho University's mission. 
Excessive preoceupation with public image, grade inflation, and misleading TCEs are all by-producL<; of the University's drift toward commercializa­tion. Each will be treated at more length in further installments of this letter. Sullice it for now to say that in the years ahead your administration will eome to be known by the way it responds to problems of this sort.

LETIER TO THE EDITOR 

Take that, Mr. Grant 
Please eonsider this a response to the squalid tripe I suppose was intended to pass as a column by Alan Grant, which was posted on ESPN.com on Sept. 2. 
Surely there had to be a better way to drive up sales for your book than an unfounded diatribe about Notre Dame's supposed irrelevance, arrogance and false snnse of tradition. After reading your column, I felt eompelled to set you straight on a few points, including your assertion that Notre Dame was wrong in dismiss­ing eoach Tyrone Willingham after just three seasons, insinuating that the decision was related to something other than the W-1. count and even perhaps in part racially motivated. 
You just don't get it, Mr. Grant. We all wanted to get behind Ty. We wanted him to be "The One," the eoach who would finally resurrect our football program and propel our "Heturn to Glory." Just look at the "Sea of Green" at Notrn Dame Stadium on football Saturdays during Willingham's tenure or the "I lheartl Ty" shirts sold on eampus. Unfortunately, and you may not realize this Mr. (;rant, a football coach's job is, among other things, to win liwtball games. Of course it wasn't 
enough that Willingham "invested himself in the job, visited the dorms and spoke passionately about the program," not with our record in shambles! Sometimes, hiring and firing decisions are about unsat­isfactory results, not integrity. 
But while we're on the subject of integrity, allow me to remind you that you attended a university whose band has been banned from Notre Dame Stadium indefinitely for maligning the Catholic religion. And, in case you forgot, the band was also at one time prevent­ed from playing at Stanford home games against ND for joking about the potato famine, a tragedy that took the lives of an estimated 500,000 to one million Irish. In light of the recent events in the American South, I'd say poking fun at a catastrophe that wreaked immeasura­ble havoc on the Irish nation is a bit worse than prema­turely firing a football coach. 
As for your assessment of the Irish as, what was it?. "J. Crew wearing yuppie larvae," I don't see how this ad hominem attack on a group of people with whom you are largely unfamiliar strengthens your argument. Hather than hurling invectives at us, why not back up your position with some legitimate faets? 
If Notre Dame is irrelevant, why is it that I can't so 
much as leave my apartment wearing a Notre Dame T­
shirt without eliciting some sort of reaction from 
passers by, whether it's a drunk twenty-year-old rolling 
down a cab window to yell "Notre Dame sucks" or a 
stranger yelling "Go Irish!"? Fact is, whether you love 
us or hate us, we are relevant. Don't you think the fact 
that you dedicated a 1400-word eolumn to ND (as well 
as a 304-page book) is a testament to that? 
I could say more, but the .idea of reading your "arti­cle" one more time makes me physieally ill. So I'll end with this: 
 The Irish will rise again, Mr. Grant. Maybe not this year. Maybe not next year. But it will happen. And when it does, we won't care that you don't earn. Notrn Dame is about tradition, and the fact that you don't understand it doesn't make it any less real.

"To be honest with you, I wasn't trying to look at the seoreboard much," Quinn said. "I just wanted to go out there and keep pushing, keep driving 
weryone. We just happened to have a great night." 
Darius Walker keyed the Irish oiTensive explosion, haul­ing in an opening-drive screen pass from Quinn and running 51 yards down the sideline for Notre Dame's first touchdown. 
Pittsburgh opened the scor­ing and appeared on the right track in Wannstedt's debut when quarterback Tyler Palko hooked up with all-Big East wide receiver Greg Lee for a 38-yard touchdown pass to cap an eight-play, 73-yard opening drive. 
But the Notre Dame defense adjusted. 
/\n Irish secondary that ranked No. 116 in the nation against the pass last season did not allow Lee to catch another ball until 7:59 remained in the third quarter, with the Irish ahead 42-13. 
"The defense, after they got their feet wet ... played pretty well," Weis said. 
/\nd just as the Pittsburgh offmse stalled, Notre Dame aceelerated behind Weis' play­calling that exposed the weak­nesses in the Panthers' defense. Pittsburgh returned three starters from last season in the secondary, but the departure of defensive tackles Vinee Crochunis and Dan Stephens was evident as the Irish ran for 275 yards. seven. The secondary really Down 10-7 after a 49-yard 

"I have as much respect [as] wasn't that much of a problem Josh Cummings field goal for anyone for Pittsburgh," Weis to me because everything was Pitt with 1:40 remaining in the said. "But they had a bunch of play~~g from tight end to tight first quarter, the Irish took uncertainties in their front end. over at their own 35. Quinn hit wide receiver Rhema McKnight in stride for 27 yards after a fake reverse, and Walker com­pleted the drive seven plays later -freezing Pitt corner­back Josh Lay with a stutter step and strolling into the end zone for a 2-yard touchdown run. 
Tho Irish then forced a Panther punt, and Tom Zbikowski's return put the Irish again at their own 35. Five minutes later, Notre Damn had seored two touchdowns. The first was courtesy of full­back Hashem Powers-Neal's one-yard burst over the goal line. 
The second was a diving, acrobatic 19-yard reception by receiver Jeff Samardzija. 
Two Notre~ Dame penaltins spotted Pittsburgh 29 yards on their ensuing possession and set up Cummings' 23-yard finld goal to make thn seorn 2X-13. 
But Quinn hit four difTnn~nt players -Samardzija, Pownrs­Neal, MeKnight and Mauriee Stovall -on the next drivn to go 4-l"or-4 with 52 yards. Powers-Neal then scored his second touchdown of the night -darting up the middle untouched for a 9-yard score -to put the Irish up 35-13 and the game out of reach. 
Powers-Neal tallied his third touchdown of the game on Notre Dame's first possession of the third quarter. 
The score came at the end of what Weis called a "sloppy" 20-play, 80-yard drive marked by three Irish penalties, a fum­ble by tight end John Carlson recovered by Quinn and two time outs. 
Nevertheless, Powers-Neal was surprised and excited by his play. 
"I expected to win but I did­n't expect myself personally to have this much success," Powers-Neal said. ''I'm going to enjoy it tonight then get back to work tomorrow." 
Weis believed the game was a solid beginning to the season but there were problems. 
"We didn't play a full 60 min­utes," Weis said. "We had 10 penalties. You can't win close games with 10 penalties." 
Pittsburgh finished the scor­ing in the fourth quarter, using running baek Haymond Kirkley's 51-yard scamper to set up Palko's 4-yard touch­down run on fourth and goal. Panthers fullback Tim Murphy ran over left tackle to convert the two-point conversion.

PITTSBURGH -Notre Dame fans, players and coaches had been wait­ing almost nine months for this game. 
It was worth the wait. 
In front of a standing-room­only crowd of 66,451 at Pittsburgh's Heinz Field, quarterback Brady Quinn and the Irish offense showed everyone exactly what Notre Dame had in mind when it inked offensive mastermind Charlie Weis to a six-year deal in December. 
For as high as preseason expecta­tions have skyrocketed in recent months -at least within the Notre Dame community-few expected the Irish to display such utter domi­nance right off the bat, no less against a ranked opponent, at night, celebrating a homecoming of its own in the return of alum head coach Dave Wannstedt. 
Methodical and precise, the Irish carved up a young Panther defense, racking up 35 first-half points-the most since the Irish hung the same first-half total on Rutgers in November 1996. Notre Dame found pay dirt on six of its first seven drives, only failing to reach the end zone on a Quinn interception during the team's second possession. 
By the time the Irish headed back to the locker room at the end of the first half, a game that most predicted to be a nail-bitter resembled more of

a lopsided high school game than an overtime-bound slugfest between two even squads. 
As impressive as the Irish looked in the 42-21 opening night romp, the contest had ominous beginnings. 
When Pittsburgh quarterback Tyler Palko found Biletnikoff Award candi­date Greg Lee on a 39-yard touch­down strike not five minutes after kickoff, ugly memories of last year's defensive struggles invariably came to mind -the Irish yielded 14 pass­ing touchdowns in the season's final three games, including a Notre Dame opponent record five to Palko at Notre Dame Stadium in November.

perience, the Irish defense shook off the first drive, and while the Notre Dame offense was busy moving the ball at will against the Pittsburgh defense, the co-captain linebacker Brandon Hoyte and the Irish defense were holding the Panthers to 153 yards and 13 first­half points. 
"That shows defensive backbone," Hoyte said. "We came together as a defensive unit, and the coaches did a great job to put us in position to make plays." 
The implications of Weis' show­stopping opening night performance are stunning.

on the quad, in dorm rooms and in cars traveling back to South Bend. 
While rabid Notre Dame fans are known for their optimism, it might be easy to forget that the last time the Irish knocked off a defending ranked conference champion on the road wasn't too long ago-former head coach Tyrone Willingham accom­plished the feat in a 22-0 shutout of Maryland to kick off the 2002 season. 
Nevertheless, while Willingham's fate is well-documented, the 2005 Irish have reason to be optimistic. 
"I think by halftime, I think that our players were starting to realize that they're better than they thought they 
were," Weis said. 
"That's what I've been 

going to go out there and play well, then usually you won't." 
Faith in both Irish coaches and themselves coupled with results on the field should only produce a per­petual cycle of success. 
"We just wanted to come out and have fun, that was the biggest thing -it wasn't about being nasty," free safety Tom Zbikowski said. "You're nasty when you're having fun because you're flying around. 
"Football is supposed to be fun." 
If Saturday night was any indica­tion, there will be plenty of fun to go around this fall.

Irish flex offensive muscle at Pitt 
By MATT PUGLISI A~sociate Spons Editor 
PITTSBUHC;I I -An oO'ensive outburst that saw Notw Dame lind the end zone on six of its first seven drives en route to a 42-21 thumping of' Pittsburgh Saturday shocknd many pnople. 
Irish running back Darius Walker was­n't one of them. 
"I think we worknd towards that [per­l'orrnanenl." Walker said. "A lot of' the oflimsn is roturning. The chemistry is up, we gel, we know how each other plays, so moving the ball was something kind of' simple for us." 
Along with quarterback Brady Quinn, Walknr spearheaded an Irish attack that dissectnd the Panthers with surgical pre­cision. 
Punching holes in an inexperienced, injumd Panthers defensive line, the Irish took advantage of the gross mismatch, using a veteran offensive line to open gaping holes for Walker, Travis Thomas and Hash1m Powers-Neal. 
The Irish finished the contest with four rushing touchdowns. Walker found the end zone on a two-yard run around left end, ineluding a juke that nearly toppled cornerback Josh Lay, and Powers-Neal readwd paydirt on runs of' two, four and nine yards.

M LB -NATIONAL LEAGUE 
Marquis leads Cardinals over Astros with gem 
Giants beat D-backs; Soe and Mets easily roll past Marlins 
Associated Press 
HOUSTON -Jason Marquis went more than a month with­out winning a game for the St. Louis Cardinals. He didn't trust his pitches and found himself on the-mound waiting for the next bad thing to happen. 
The right-hander is feeling much better after consecutive complete-game victories. 
Marquis limited Houston to five hits in the Cardinals' 4-1 victory Sunday that kept the Astros from becoming the NL wild-card leader. He lost seven starts in a row before the two complete games. 
"I needed this more mentally than anything," Marquis said. "When you start struggling, you doubt yourself a little bit, and that's not a good thing.... To have these results in back-to­hack games, it is a confidence boost." 
Marquis (11-13) threw a two­hit shutout in his last appear­ance, Aug. 27 at Washington­his first win since beating the Astros on July 16. On Sunday, he struck out five and didn't allow any walks while throwing 71 of his 98 pitches for strikes in his third career complete game, all this season. 
"That's how he pitched early in the year. He just got in a funk," manager Tony La Russa said. "In the middle of that funk, he had a couple of games like this and we couldn't score for him.... This is what he's capable of doing." 
Marquis got hit on his left fin­gers swinging at a pitch in the seventh inning. He said it was only a bruise and that the wrap engulfing his entire hand was only a precaution. 

Giants 3, Diamondbacks 2 
With one major league start already on his resume, San Francisco Giants pitcher Matt Cain was able to relax -and win. 
Cain allowed three hits in seven innings in his second

start, Randy Winn scored twice and drove in a run, and the Giants beat the Arizona Diamondbacks Sunday for their fifth straight victory. 
The Giants won for the sev­enth time in eight games to move within 5 1/2 games of San Diego in the NL West. 
"It feels really good to be able to get that first one under the belt," said Cain, a 20-year-old right-hander who on Aug. 30 became the youngest player to make his major league debut for the Giants since Mark Grant in 1984. "I just was fired up too much for my first start. It was­n't my normal velocity." 
Cain's velocity remained high enough _ his fastball was clocked as high as 95 mph -to keep the Diamondbacks' hitters off balance for most of the game. 


Rockies 7, Dodgers 6 
Brad Hawpe set modest goals when he recently came off the disabled list. 
"I came back and wanted to make an impact, and help this team in the end of the year," said Hawpe, who was on the DL with a sprained left hamstring until Friday. 
Hawpe drove in the winning run with a single with one out in the 1Oth inning as the Colorado Rockies completed a three-game sweep of the Los Angeles Dodgers with a victory Sunday. 
Cory Sullivan had four hits, including a leadoff double in the 10th. Matt Holliday drove in two runs with his 15th home run, and Omar Quintanilla doubled and had two RBis. 
Scott Dohman (2-1) worked a scoreless 10th inning for the win. 
Sullivan led off the 10th with a double into the right-field cor­ner off Duaner Sanchez (4-5). Todd Helton was intentionally walked and Sanchez struck out Holliday before Hawpe drove a 3-2 pitch to the wall in center to score Sullivan. 
"On the last at-bat, he threw quite a bit of changeups and a good slider that fell off," Hawpe said. "On the 3-2 count it was a fastball that got up, and I tried to put the barrel on it and not do too much, and it worked out." 
Sanchez saw it a different way. 
"I tried to get him out with a high fastball," Sanchez said. "It didn't work." 
Jeff Kent became the all-time leader for second basemen with his 13th career grand slam. His 85 RBis as a second baseman is a new Dodgers record for that position, passing the mark of 83 set in 1959 by Charlie Neal. 



Mets 7, Marlins 1 
Jae Seo revived the New York Mets' playoff prospects -for one more series, at least. 
The right-hander allowed one run in seven innings Sunday, helping the Mets salvage the finale of their three-game series against the Florida Marlins with a victory. 
Despite winning just twice in their past eight games, the Mets are only 2 1/2 games behind NL wild-card leader Philadelphia, which lost to Washington. 
"This game was very impor­tant to my team," Seo said through a translator, "because this was a game that could start us off to the playoffs." 
The Mets improved to 1-2 on a 10-game trip. 
"That's why you don't panic. That's why you don't overre­act," manager Willie Randolph said. "We know very well that things can change at the drop of a dime, so we'll just keep play­ing." 
New York begins a three­game series Monday against NL East leader Atlanta. 
Florida missed a chance to overtake the Phillies and 
remained a half-game back. The Marlins play their next 11 games on the road against fel­low wild-card contenders, start­ing Monday at Washington. 
Nationals 6, Phillies 1 
Esteban Loaiza threw a 92 mph fastball past Pat Burrell on his 128th and final pitch Sunday, then crouched and pumped his right fist twice. 
An inning later, a white towel draped over his shoul­ders, Loaiza led his Washington Nationals team­mates out of the dugout for high-fives and back slaps to celebrate a 6-1 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies. 
When the Nationals filed into their clubhouse, this was writ­ten in capital letters on the message board near the door­way: "The fun has begun!" 
Yes, somehow, some way, those ex-Expos are still playing -and winning -meaningful games as the calendar turns to Labor Day. 
Loaiza struck out 11 and took a shutout into the eighth on short rest, and Preston Wilson and Brian Schneider each hit a three-run homer as Washington gained a game on all three teams it trails in the NL wild-card standings.

Los Angeles staked Colon to a 5-0 lead, and he responded by retiring 12 of his first 13 bat­ters to help the Angels take two of three in the series. 
"They got me five runs and that was enough," Colon said. 
He gave up three straight sin­gles to open the fifth before retiring the next three batters. The Mariners scored once in the inning on an RBI single by Jose Lopez to cut it to 5-1. 
Sciascia wanted Colon to quit after the fifth, but the pitcher declined. He gave up a triple to Jeremy Reed to start the sixth before bowing out. Reed scored on a groundout by Richie Sexson to make it 5-2. 
Red Sox 5, Orioles 1 
David Wells had no trouble with the Baltimore Orioles or the umpires. 
In his first start since serving a six-game suspension, the excitable Wells was solid and steady for the Red Sox, pitch­ing his first nine-inning com­plete game of the season in Boston's win Sunday. 
"Right now, every win is clutch for us," Wells said. "I felt good. My body felt good. Warming up was pretty good. I didn't feel rusty at all." 
Wells {12-6) was· suspended for arguing with umpires on July 2, but came back strong. He allowed seven hits, struck out four and retired his last 12 batters. It was the seventh time in eight games that he did not issue a walk. 
During the suspension, Wells worked out at Fenway Park. He also was called to a meeting Wednesday with baseball offi­thing will be fine." 
Garland threw a four-hitter and Paul Konerko homered, sending Chicago to a victory over the Detroit Tigers and a sweep of their four-game series. 
After going 12-1.6 in August, the White Sox are 4-0 in September. 
"When one person starts it off, it all seems to roll from there," Garland said after Chicago outscored Detroit 29-6 in the series. 
After losing three straight decisions, Garland (17 -8) pitched his third complete game of the season -all shutouts. Winning for the first time since Aug. 7, he got two stellar defensive plays to keep the Tigers from scoring. 
Garland, who started the sea­son 8-0, walked one and struck out seven, including Chris Shelton with a runner at third to end the eighth right after manager Ozzie Guillen came to the mound and asked if he was OK. 
"I was kind of worried about him leaving the ball around the plate and giving up a home run, and all of a sudden he'd lose everything he built for the whole game. He said he was fine and I believe my pitchers," Guillen said 
Garland outpitched Jeremy Sonderman {14-12), who lost his third consecutive start despite allowing five hits in his fourth complete game this sea­son and the sixth of his career. He struck out six and walked one. 
"That's the way it goes, man," Sonderman said. "What are you going to do? Can't sit

NEW YOHK -Far from a family feud, matches between Venus and Serena Williams create a family crisis. 
This time neither of their parents could watch. 
Artistry gave way to sheer slugging again in Sister Act XIV. the ongoing saga of siblings who hate to play each other -espe­cially if it's not for a Grand Slam title. 
Venus' 7-6 (5), 6-2 victo­ry Sunday to reach the quarterfinals at the U.S. Open evened their head­to-head matches at 7-7 and gave the elder sister her second win this year after losing six straight to Serena. 
Venus bottled up her 

emotions. not her power, and could hardly manage a smlie when it was over. Serena Williams shrieked and bounced her racket before limping off, angry at herself and achy. 
It was the ninth time they met in a Grand Slam match, and the earliest since Venus won the first clash in the second round of the 1998 Australian Open. Serena had won their last five matches in majors -all in finals. 
"Serena is the baby so she's going to do her little tantrum," said older sister Lyndrea, the only immedi­ate family member watch­ing at courtside. "You kind of want to pull for her because she is the baby. It's hard but I had to be there for them." 
IN BRIEF 
Woods gives UP. Deutsche 
Bank Championship 
NORTON, Mass. -The Deutsche Bank Championship appeared to belong to Tiger Woods at the start of the week. Now it's up for grabs for just about everyone except golf's No. 1 player. 
John Rollins set a course record with a 28 on the back nine Sunday, holing out a bunker shot on the 18th hole for an 8-under 63 as the leaders were still warming up on the range. Jason Bohn birdied his last four holes for a 67. Carl Petterson scrambled to a 68. Billy Andrade started and finished with birdies and made 16 pars in between. 
And when Olin Browne recovered from an awkward spot in the fair­way to save par on the 18th for a 70, he joined the five-way tic atop the leaderboard, the largest logjam 
The 25-year-old Venus, who won her third Wimbledon two months ago and is going for her third U.S. Open title, could see that Serena, three weeks shy of 24, was struggling to control her shots and temper. 
"When she doesn't play her best is the best time to get a win against her," said Venus, who next plays No. 4 Kim Clijsters, a 6-1, 6-0 winner against Venezuela's Maria Vento­Kabchi. 
Women's top seed Maria Sharapova had no trouble dismissing India's rising star, Sania Mirza, 6-2, 6-1, and next plays fellow Russian and No. 9 Nadia Petrova, a 7-6 (4), 7-5 vic­tor over Nicole Vaidisova of the Czech Republic. 
Serena was in trouble from the start. losing the first three points on her serve in the opening game, but kept scrambling back --often with the help of Venus' errors. Venus broke her for a 4-3 lead in the first set and served for the set at 5-4 when she suddenly tight­ened. After winning 11 straight points on serve in previous games, she hit two double-faults and made two errors to even the set. 
The tiebreaker was a messy affair filled with minibreaks before Venus won it when Serena dumped a backhand into the net. Serena bounced her racket onto the court and stalked angrily to the chair.

A week after making a double bogey on the linal hole to linish two strokes behind Cristic Kerr in the Wendy's Championship for Children, Hurst closed with a rou­tine par Sunday to beat Kerr by three strokes in the LPGA State Farm Classic. 
"You try to look at the present not the past." Hurst said. "I think last week was just a stepping stone and I think it help~~d a little bit."

COLLEGE fOOTBALL 
Sooners frogged; Tigers get stung 
Two top-tier teams take tumbles on first weekend of season 
Associated Press 
AUBURN, Ala. -Bob Stoops found much to dislike in Oklahoma's season-opening per­formance. No consistent running game. Poor pass protection. Errant throws. 
And in the interest of fairness, he said the coaching also left something to be desired in a 17­10 loss to TCU on Saturday. 
"They outplayed us and out­coached us as a whole," the Sooners coach said Sunday. 
No team understands his pain better than Auburn. The 16th­ranked Tigers also stumbled out of the gates with a 23-14 loss to Georgia Tech. 
The two teams who spent the end of last season jockeying for the right to play Southern California for the national title likely want no part of the top­ranked Trojans at the moment. 
For Auburn, it was a turnover­and mistake-filled end to a 15­game winning streak that trailed only USC and Utah among active streaks. Keeping the season from going downhill was more on the team's mind in the locker room than the streak. 
"The winning streak. that was something we obviously all looked at," coach Tommy Tuberville said. "It's something we didn't harp on. It's been awhile since we lost a game, and it was good to see the seniors stand up and say a few words after the game (instead of) hav­ing their heads down." 
It's no real surprise that the oiTenses at both Oklahoma and Auburn sputtered against decent

-though unranked -opening competition. Both were replacing terrific and seasoned quarter­backs in the Sooners' Jason White and the Tigers' Jason Campbell, White a Heisman Trophy winner and Campbell a first-round NFL draft pick. 
With the defenses gearing up to force Auburn's Brandon Cox and Oklahoma's Paul Thompson and Rhett Bomar to beat them through the air, neither team mustered much of a running game. Something that was sel­dom a problem for either offense last season. 
The result: Cox turned it over on the Tigers' final five drives, with four interceptions and a fumble. 
Thompson completed 11 of 26 passes for 109 yards with an interception for Oklahoma. Bomar was 2-for-5 for 19 yards. 
Not even the Sooners' super sophomore Adrian Peterson could produce anything on the ground. The Heisman runner-up ran for only 63 yards after set­ting an NCAA freshman record with 1,925 rushing yards. 
What went wrong? Good ques­tion, Stoops said. 
"It might be the attitude and discipline we came out and played with," he said. "Or it could be the play-calling. It real­ly is hard to put your finger on it." 
Defensive tackle Dusty Dvoracek offered a blunt assess­ment. 
"We never got tough, and we never had the attitude we need­ed to win," said Dvoracek, one of the team's four captains. 
Auburn was spoiled last sea­son with tailbacks Ronnie Brown and Carnell Williams, but aban­doned the run with an early deficit and Georgia Tech stacking the line of scrimmage.

Louisville survives Wildcat scare 
Cardinals' rushing game prevents upset ofNo. 12 team in country 
Associated Press 

LEXINGTON, Ky. -For all the preseason talk about Louisville's high-powered pass­ing game, it was a running back and a defensive end that led the Cardinals to victory in their opener. 
Michael Bush rushed for 128 yards and two touchdowns and Elvis Dumervil added a school­record six sacks as No. 12 Louisville held off Kentucky 31­24 on Sunday. 
The 6-foot-2, 250-pound Bush carried 27 times and scored on runs of 11 and 1 yards. He helped the Cardinals grind out the clock after Kentucky (0-1) rallied within a touchdown in the fourth quarter. It was Bush's fourth career 100-yard rushing effort, and the Cardinals' sixth win in seven years against their in-state rivaL 
''I'm just real sore," Bush said. "I wasn't paying attention to how many carries I have. I'm glad they put it on my shoulders to do what I did." 
Louisville's heralded sopho­more quarterback, Brian Brohm, went 19-of-27 for 179 yards and rushed for two touch­downs in his first collegiate start. He had just one incomple­tion in the first half as the Cardinals jumped to a 28-7 lead. 
But the Cardinals managed only a 19-yard. field goal by Art Carmody in the second half, opening the door for a Kentucky rally.

Belles tee off season, finish 11th in tourney 
Individual scores highlight Saint Mary's debut 
By JORDAN BELTZ Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's golf team got its season ofT on the right foot with an impressive 11th placn finish at the Ferris State Fall Invitational this weekend. 
Thn Belles firnd a 344-340­61{4, finishing 69 strokes behind the tournament cham­pions, the host Ferris State Lady Bulldogs. While the fin­ish was maybe not as high as some fans may have expected, it was a solid showing to get the season ofT to a good start. 
"As a team we played well considering it was our first tournament, but we could have done better," said golfer Alex Sci. 
llnading up the leader board for the Belles was senior Mngan Mattie, who fired an 81 in the second round -good enough for a 25th overall fin­ish. Senior co-captain Nicole Bnllino shot a final round 84, which gave her a 48th place finish. Katie O'Brien shot a final round 86, good for a 51st place finish, while the other Belles co-captain, Kristen Fantom, fired an 89 to tie for 61stplaee. 
The Belles knew going into the weekend that the most important thing to come out of the invitational was not going to be the team's overall finish,_ but rather the development of thn frnshmen. 
Sni, a freshman, was insert­ed into the lineup and shot a final round 92, finishing at the 85th position. 
"I was under a lot of pres­sure," Sei said. "It was very nerve wracking. All that I wanted to do was play well for the team." 
The Belles are focusing much more as playing togeth­er as a cohesive unit, as the team-oriented practices that they have been holding indi­cate. Having a freshmen con­tributor in the season opening match can only add to the team's chemistry. 
The Belles finished up the weekend strongly when com­paring their results to those of other similarly sized schools in the region. They defeated rival St. Joseph's (Ind.) by 18 shots, and only trailed bitter in-state rival DePauw by 44 strokes. 
Looking ahead, while these early tournaments are indeed important, the ultimate goal for the team is to build up enough confidence to perform well at the MIAA Championships, which are to be held the weekend of Oct. 7 and 8. 
In the meantime, the Belles will hope to carry the momen­tum from their solid finish this weekend to next weekend, as they take part in the Notre Dame Invitational. 
"Next week we are going to go out and try our best, and hopefully perform a little bet­ter," Sei said. 
The Invitational will be held next Friday and Saturday at the Warren Golf Course.

the Irish know they can play under pressure. 
Texas came back from a 2-0 deficit to force a fifth game Saturday evening, and Arizona State hung around for a fifth game Sunday afternoon. 
Serenaded by chants of "Let's Go Irish" and "We are ND" from a small but boisterous crowd, the Longhorns looked flustered throughout the opening two games against the Irish. 
The Irish looked unstoppable. 
Notre Dame took the first two games 30-21, 31-29, with a syn­chronized offensive attack, led by sophomore setter Ashley Tarutis' accurate setting and 51 set assists. 
"I feel really good about the energy we had and the way we executed," Tarutis said. I could­n't be happier with the way we started." 
With seniors Meg Henican, Brewster, Lauren Kelbley and Carolyn Cooper and freshman Mallorie Croal rotating on the front line, the Irish set up their seemingly unbreakable defense. The front line's blocks helped junior libero Danielle Herndon have a career night. 
"The block was set up really nice," she said. "And I think that's a huge part in being able to dig." 
Herndon -at times putting

goal from 40 yards out. 
Fellow midfielder Nate Norman added to the Irish lead at 14:59, blasting a shot from just outside the box. 
"Obviously you're looking to see your forwards get in with goals, but it's also great when the midfielders [do]," Clark said.

her body on the line -dove, stretched and leaped for every ball she could get to. She had a career-high 20 digs. When told of her career night, she laughed. 
"I didn't even know [about it]. It was a lot of fun." 
The momentum shifted in the third game, though, and the Longhorns proved their top 15 hype. Six-foot-five freshman Lauren Paolini played more like an experienced senior, pounding 13 kills and nabbing three blocks, and sophomore setter Michelle Moriarty had an astounding 4 7 set assists in the third game alone. The Horns took the hard-fought game 30­
28. They rode their momentum into the fourth game, dominating 30-22. 
Then in game five, the Irish let loose. They became the aggres­sor, and, again, Texas was on il'l heels. 
"I loved the way they [the Irish] came out and finished really, really strong," Brown said. 
For most of the match, despite the shaky third and fourth games, Notre Dame had more energy than Texas. An energetic crowd was crucial to the Irish maintaining focus, however ­especially against Arizona State. 
From the opening serve, the Sun Devils made the Irish aware they weren't going to be a pushover. Their 1-3 record was deceiving. Notre Dame won the first game 30-20, but was closer than the score indicates. 
"This is something we've got. We feel midfielders can score goals." 
After goalkeeper Chris Cahill allowed a deflection in the 37th minute, the Irish sealed the deal with a John Stephens goal off another Dalby free kick at 79:13. The Irish hammered the upset home with Joe Lapira's break­away feed from Alex Yoshinaga less than a minute later for a fmal score of 4-1. 
Although the victory was lop­sided, Clark felt the team showed more heart in the 1-0 loss to Wake Forest. 
"It's a funny thing because I felt we played better against Wake," Clark said. "I thought the team's performance was actual­ly better." 
The team's four goals against the Mustangs were good for morale, but Clark knows the effort the team puts into the game isn't always reflected on the scoreboard. 
"Sometimes in soccer the goals don't always tell the story," he said." They don't tell the whole story -we got goals fair­ly easily in that game but in many ways from a team per­spective, I felt we played better soccer against Wake." 
The scoreless regulation peri­ods were a hard-fought contest on Sunday, with both teams con­trolling parts of the play. 
Forward Kurt Martin had a 
The Sun Dnvils appeared over­matched by the Irish talent, but the underdogs carried their emotion into the second game. They won 30-28. 
They won again 30-21, and suddenly, the Irish looked beat­able. 
"We just reminded them that we've got to take it a point at a time," Brown said. "We wouldn't allow ourselves to get any momentum beeause we were a little bit tired, a little bit fatigued, so we just said, 'We can't save anything,' and 'Just go all out on every point."' 
Croal reached over the prnss row tables and bumped a ball back into play. Fellow freshman Madison Clark was getting floor burns diving for balls. Tarutis pancaked a ball -setting her hand completely flat on the floor and bouncing the ball oil'. And Herndon was her usually self. 

"You have to have that kind of defensive effort to stay in match­es, and I was really pleased the pursuit on defense, not giving up," Brown said. "ASU played great defense; their libero was just unbelievable. It was good that we tried to stay with that." 
The Irish won 30-20, 28-30, 21-30,30-23, 15-10. 
In addition to Brewster, Heniean, Croal and Tarutis made the all-tournament team.

the erossbar. Cahill reeorded five saves over the course of the game. 
"I felt at the time when we lost the game we were really con­trolling the game, we were the team that was looking to win the game," Clark said. "That was disappointing. It was a very good game, it was an excellent game ... we had chances and they had chances." 
Unfortunately for the Irish, the Demon Deacons would be the team to capitalize on their chance with a goal in the 96th minute. 
"We looked like the team that was really wanting to win it," Clark said. "The trouble in sud­den death, you don't get an opportunity to come back, that's the end of the game." 
Clark said the Irish will watch game tape and prepare for the Mike Berticelli Memorial Tournament, which they host next weekend. They take mixed emotions out of this weekend's play. 
"It was kind of bittersweet," Clark said. "You were very happy to win the game against SMU whereas against Wake, you were happy to play well but dis­appointed not to win the game."

While Thorlakson was provid­ing most of the offense on the night, she also had help. 
After carrying most of the offensive weight last year, Thorlakson has enjoyed the on­field company of second-semes­ter freshman star Kerri Hanks. 
Hanks scored her eighth goal early in her third collegiate game, receiving and capitalizing on up-field leads from Cinalli and senior midfielder Annie Schefter at 11 :46. She hit the far right corner from 10 yards out to put the Irish up 1-0. 
For Hanks, that extended her Irish record for goals to start both a career and season. 
It also marked a critical turn­ing point in the game for the team, which had struggled to maintain possession of the ball in the opening minutes of the game. 
"It took us about 15 minutes to get going," Irish coach Handy Waldrum said. 
But from then on, the Irish had no problem controlling the ball. 
Notre Dame dominated in shots and shots on goal, finish­ing with 15 and eight, respec­tively, compared to Florida's seven and four. 
The Gators cut the lead to 4-1 with 11 minutes remaining when forward Jasmine Johnson tapped a crossing pass from KeLeigh Hudson into the right side of the net. 
But that would be all the Gators could muster. 
It was the only blemish on the night for Irish goalkeeper Erika Bohn, who saved Florida's other three shots on goal. 
The win improved the Irish to 52-13-3 against ranked oppo­nents under Waldrum.

SUNY-Brockport quickly reduced the Belles' advantage by scoring three unanswered goals between the first and second halves to take a 3-2 lead until Logan tied the game in the wan­ing minutes. 
"We just found a way," Mackenzie said. "We were down and playing a really tight match.

Hanks scores four as Irish outduel two ranked foes, 10-1 
By BOBBY GRIFFIN Associate Sports Editor 
Two more games, two more wins. 
It was hard to find much wrong with Notre Dame's play this weekend, as the Irish cruised through the Inn at Saint Mary's Classic, defeating Florida and Maryland on their way to winning the tournament title. 
"We're going to have a great team this year," Katie Thorlakson said. "We built on our team last year and were just stronger and stronger. We're probably going to bring it to every team we play this year." 
Thorlakson was named tour­nament MVP after scoring three goals and adding three assists on the weekend.

Irish split W"eekend lllatchups 
By KATE GALES Associate Sports Editor 
They left with mixed feelings, mixed results and a new record of 1-1. 
But the No. 16 Irish made a statement to a nation of fans wondering how this team will fare in this season's spotlight. Notre Dame beat No. 7 Southern Methodist University, 4-1, and lost a close overtime match to No. 10 Wake Forest. 
"They were both good teams," coach Bobby Clark said. "I think winning one and losing one ... you're not quite sure whether to be happy or sad. I suppose we seem a little bit more sad because the second one was a loss, and it was a tough loss." 
The Irish faced the Mustangs in the first game Saturday and jumped out to a 1-0 lead on Greg Dalby's free kick in the first two minutes of play. The standout midfielder, known for his defen­sive play, notched his first career

Irish top ASU for championship

Lauren Brewster loves volley~ ball so much she doesn't want to stop playing -even for a time­out. 
"It's harder because the time,­outs were longer," she said, referring to the lengthened time outs because of College Sports Television's airing of Saturday's match. "You're all ready; your adrenaline is going; you just want to get back in there and you just have to sit down and take another minute." 
She and her Notre Dame teammates enjoyed playing so much this weekend that they played the maximum 10 games in two matches -though, in this case, they would much rather have finished ofl' their opponents quicker. 
"I think that in both cases, in both last night and today, we played really good fifth games," coach Debbie Brown said. "I think that's good. You feel like, 'OK, I think if we get to the fifth game, then we know how to be tough, and we know how to compete hard.' 

"We would prefer not to be in that situation, but I think it showed good mental toughness." 
The Irish (3-0) won their own The Inn at Saint Mary's Shamrock Invitational, beating 11th ranked Texas (1-1) and unheralded but scrappy Arizona State (1-4).

Belles miss out on tournament title 
By KYLE CASSILY Sports Writer 

The Belles soccer team fell just short of a tournament champi­onship this weekend after bat­tling through two physically tax­ing games in a one-day span. 
Saint Mary's faced off against SUNY­Brockport and earned a spot against tour­nament host Marietta College in the­championship 


Fron

of the two-day Marietta College Classic. Both games were close, and both were decided by one goal. 
The Belles managed to knock off SUNY-Brockport in the open­ing game, a double-overtime offensive show that pushed the Saint Mary's players to their physical limits. The Belles won, 4-3. 
The deciding goal came from freshman Whitney Fron late in the second overtime. Fron bent the ball into the upper right cor­ner of the net on a shot taken nearly 35 yards out, driven from the high left side of the goalkeep­er's box. The goal secured the Belles victory after 102 minutes of action. 
"It was a great shot, just really well done," Belles coach Caryn Mackenzie said. 
Fron also assisted on the goal that tied the game with a little 
· over two minutes left to play in regulation time. Fron dished the ball to Carolyn Logan, who netted it to tie the game 3-3 and send it to overtime. 
Mackenzie was impressed with how her team maintained a con­sistent level of play through the lengthy game against a physically
