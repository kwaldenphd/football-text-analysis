SMC security adresses recent safety concerns 
Gariepy meets with students to discuss incident at Regina Hall 
By LIZ HARTER Saint Mary's Editor 
Saint Mary's director of security Dave 
Gariepy and assistant director of security Stan 
Klimczak addressed concerned Regina Hall 
residents about security issues and concerns in 
at a meeting in the North Lounge of the hall 
Thursday evening. 
"There was a lot of concern ... about the man 
on the roof," Gariepy said. "There's a lot of 
basis for concern with the way security 
responded [to that incident]." 
Gariepy, referring to the trespasser who 
escaped custody after making his way onto the 
roof of Regina Hall April 5, alluded to the 
seemingly slow response to the incident from 
Saint Mary's Security detailed in the article 
"Slow Security response raises questions" in 
the April 17 edition of The Observer.

Seniors report trespasser at on-campus apartments 
By MANDl STIRONE Assistant News Editor 
While many Saint Mary's students have voiced concerns about Saint Mary's secu­rity, some Opus Hall residents have recently come forward with positive feed­back about it. 
Opus, a seniors-only apartment com­plex, is located on-campus behind Madeleva Hall. 
Seniors Haley Nickell and Molly Pfister were in their first floor quad's living room when their third roommate asked if either of them had seen a suspicious man walk­ing around outside the building. 
Pfister and Nickell both went into their separate bedrooms and saw the same man, they said. 
"He continued to walk around and just

Students tnake longest spoon train 
Group of 127 breaks world record on quad 
By ELIZABETH KUHN News Writer 
A group of 127 Notre Dame students broke the record for the World's Longest Spoon Train in the middle of South Quad Thursday afternoon. 
.Junior Charlie Mahoney origi­nally proposed the idea to his friends as a joke, but the scheme slowly gained credence until finally he and fellow ski team member Joel Sharbrough decided to make the biggest spoon train ever. 
"We obviously loved spooning in the first place, so we just thought why don't we be the best spooners we can be? And it just spiraled into something

Musicians compete in Battle of the Bands 
By GENE NOONE News Writer 

Notre Dame will conclude its week-long AnTostal celebra­tion Saturday at 8 p.m. with a competition between 10 stu­dent bands vying for musical superiority at the annual Battle of the Bands . 
This year's Battle of the Bands features the largest number of contestants in com­petition history. 
"Something that really sur­prised us about this year's competition was the number of entries we received for the Battle," said junior Clint Simkins, co-programmer of campus entertainment for the Student Union Board (SUB). 
Sixteen bands submitted demo CDs to SUB, the largest number of applicants to date. A panel of SUB committee members and Legends repre­sentatives listened to each sub­mission and narrowed the field to the 10 best acts, Simkins said. 
"We planned on choosing six to eight bands, but all of the submissions were top quality, so it was hard to even narrow it down to ten," said sopho­more Mallory Davidson, co­programmer of campus enter­tainment for SUB. 
Davidson said SUB wanted to host a wide variety of music types for the Battle. 
"Bands were chosen based on the quality of the songs they put on their submission CDs," Davidson said. "We really tried to make sure that a wide vari­

You live, you learn 
They say the eollege experience isn't so

Sorin College to sponsor

Neil Silnon' s ''Rumors'' 
By KATIE PERALTA Assistant News Editor 
Sorin College will sponsor its first theatrical event this week­end with a performance of Neil Simon's farce "Rumors." 
The show will be performed on Sunday and Tuesday nights at 8 in the LAB theater on the third floor of Washington Hall. 
Proceeds from the event will benefit Saint Jude's Primary School in Jinja, Uganda, through Sorin's 
show alongside Maltese. 
Although this is Sorin's first fundraising the­atrical event of its kind, Maltese hopes such shows con­tinue in the future and to per­haps initiate a "theatre for charity" on campus. 
"The event will hopefully be produced once every year on a much larger scale for a longer run time," Maltese said. ·

"Our initial reports didn't indieate [that security! had to come a second time before they searched the roof," he said. "To us, reading the report, we read it as the roof had been checked on the first time." 
Gariepy said the initial responding officer saw the man on the roof and made a deci­sion about the situation. 
"The oflieer explained that she madn a bad judgment call," he said. "Another call came in that diverted her attention and because of what she had assumed she went to help the other call. By the time our offi­cer went up on the roof [the suspect] had made his escape." 
He stressed there should not be any men on the roof after dark, and the construction tak­ing place on the roof of the building has been completed so there should be no ladders near the building at night either. 
"There shouldn't be roofing contractors up there after dark," Gariepy said.

Kliczmak said the most important thing a student can do to help keep campus safe is to call seeurity about suspicious activity.

One competitor, senior Robbie Hazen, acknowledged the impor­tance of getting to play at a venue like Legends. 

"Battle of the Bands is a great opportunity to play in front of a large crowd on a big stage," Hazen said. "It also allows you the opportunity to collaborate with other musicians on earn­pus." 
Hazen competed in the Battle of the Bands the past several years and said he is looking for­ward to giving a unique perform­ance this year. 
Winners will be awarded at the end of the show with first place winning a $200 gift certificate to Guitar Center, a Mishawaka music store. Second and third place will win $100 and $50 gift certificates, respectively. 
Perhaps more important to the musicians than the prize money are the bragging rights.

Kliczmak said students should never hesitate to call security. 
"If you do not get an ade­quate response the next morn­ing call myself or Dave [Gariepy]," he said. "We do not cover anything up. We've made a mistake, we can do better." 

Kliczmak said security is encouraging students to give their name and number when they call because they want officers to be able to respond to the student after they have investigated the activity that is reported. 
"We're encouraging our guys to make contact with the per­son who made the complaint. You should be called back and explain what was found, that's just good police work or securi­ty work," Gariepy said.

U.N. announces anti-malaria initiative 
UNITED NATIONS -Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will announce a global initiative on Friday aimed eliminating deaths from malaria, a tropical scourge blamed for killing a million people a year. 
In a video message for a World Malaria Day event at U.N. headquarters, Ban said the initia­tive will offer indoor spraying and bed nets treated with long-lasting insecticide "to all peo­ple at risk, especially women and children in Africa." The video was obtained Thursday by The Associated Press. 
It will also ensure that public health facilities have access to efTective malaria treatment and diagnosis, that health workers are trained to deal with the disease, and that research into its eradication is encouraged, Ban said. 
"The aim is to put a stop to malaria deaths by ensuring universal coverage by the end of 2010," he said. 
Sarkozy asks E.U. for Olympic boyc!ott 
PAHIS -French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Thursday he will push for a European Union-wide agreement on whether to boycott the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics. 
Sarkozy has said he could boycott the cere­mony in response to China's crackdown on demonstrators in Tibet last month, but he has softened his tone since a rash of protests broke out last weekend in front of French-owned supermarkets throughout China. 
If no progress is made before the Aug. 8-24 games, he said he would try to seek "a united position" among the EU's 27 member states. France will hold the rotating EU presidency at that time.

Man sentenced in oil-for-food case 
NEW YORK -An Iraqi-American business­man who admitted helping Saddam Hussein's government in the oil-for-food scandal was lined $300,000 and sentenced to probation by a judge who said he provided substantial assis­tance to the U.S. government after his arrest. 
"He was a terrific witness," U.S. District Judge Denny Chin said Thursday as he bestowed leniency on Samir A. Vincent, who could have faced years in prison. 
Vincent. a 67 -year-old naturalized U.S. citi­zen from Annandale, Va., testified at two trials, including one that was interrupted when Texas oilman Oscar Wyatt Jr. pleaded guilty to con­spiracy. Vincent, an oil trader, had occasionally accompanied Wyatt on his meetings with high­ranking Iraqi oflicials.

Candidate proposes state audit plan 
INDIANAPOLIS -An external audit of state government would be performed and voting hours would be extended under a government restructuring plan presented Thursday by Democratic candidate for gov­ernor Jim Schellinger.

Local accused of school attack plot 
Authorities detain teen after finding more than 100 knives, illegal snakes at his home 
Associated Press 
SOUTH BEND, Ind. -A 16-year-old boy is accused of plotting an attack on his high school, prosecu­tors said Thursday, alleg­ing that he discussed plans by e-mail with another person to carry out simultaneous "Columbine-like mass murders" in two states on Sept. 11, 2008.

Cosby, judge lecture on parenting, values 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -A Georgia judge who kicked whites out of his courtroom while he lectured black defendants is getting a comedian's help in deliver­ing his stern message. 
Bill Cosby joined Superior Court Judge Marvin Arrington at a· forum Thursday night for at-risk youths from the Atlanta area. Both men are black, and Cosby himself has made waves by criticizing the black com­munity. 
The comedian spoke to the pre­dominantly black audience at Benjamin Mays High School about the importance of education and fam­ily. 
"Families: where old people put the rules out without profanity," Cosby told the invitation-only gathering of about 500 people, including teenagers judged by juvenile authori­ties as being "at risk." 
Cosby lamented a culture of drugs and permissive sex. 
"The problem with teenage preg­nancy is the planning of it. There was no planning," he said. 
"Let's get with these teenage chil­dren and their sex and having sex. I'm telling you, you've got to talk to your children." 
He dismissed critics of his approach who have said that he is airing dirty laundry. 
"That's crazy," he said. "There are black people who have to walk around this dirty laundry." 
Arrington said Cosby contacted him two weeks ago and said, '"I want to come to Atlanta and help you with your fight to try to turn these young people around.' 
"These young people are worth saving," the judge said. 
Arrington recounted a litany of criminal defendants who come before him in court, including young men who kill during drug deals and a father who slept with his daughters. 
"Somewhere, you can cannot toler­ate this uncivilized conduct," Arrington said. · 
The judge has admitted he should­n't have made white people leave as he tried to scare straight some young black men at the March 27 court ses­sion. He said he wanted only to get the defendants' attention without dressing them down in front of whites.

Pfister also said security officers arrived quickly and did a check of the entire outside of the building after leaving their apartment. 
"I saw them outside look­ing around our windows where we had seen the man," she said. 
In addition to checking Opus Hall, security did a search of the campus for 
the ·man, Nickell said. 
"They told us they were going to cir­cle Saint Mary's a few times to see if the~ saw anyone sus­picious or the truck we h a d described," Nickell said. 
According to the Saint Mary's secu­rity report 
filed on April 16, the man was described as a "white male standing near a win­dow and bushes at Opus Hall around 11:55 p.m.," Director of Security Dave Gariepy said. 
While the caller was still on the phone with security, a second student saw the man getting into a "maroon colored Chevy style pickup," and left via Douglass Hoad, he said. 
"Two officers responded quickly but the vehicle had 
already left," Gariepy said. 
All officers on duty that night were alerted and told to watch for the man or his pickup truck, but he was not seen on campus again, he said. 
"It is unknown whether this person was here for legitimate reasons or some­thing other," he said. 
A security alert was not issued to the campus because the situation was investigated and it was ascertained that there was not a continuing or immi­nent threat to campus, Gariepy said. 
"[I won't] send an alert message and have everyone all stirred up about some­thing we can't identify as a continuing or imminent threat," he said. 
Both Opus Hall residents stated that they felt security did a good job in handling the situation, they said. 
"I know I feel safer know­ing security is around and hopefully this particular instance was nothing," Pfister said. 
Nickell also pointed out that the incident occurred the night before The Observer ran part one of the two-part series on Saint Mary's Security, entitled "Slow Security Response Raises questions." 
"I think it's important for people to know that this all happened before that arti­cle was run," she said.

Hamas deals 6-month cease-fire with Israel 
Associated Press 
CAIRO -The Palestinian group Hamas is proposing a six-month cease-fire with Israel, saying it will stop fir­ing rockets out of Gaza if the Jewish state simultaneously lifts its blockade of the coastal strip, Egypt's state run MENA news agency said Thursday night. 
The report followed a day of closed meetings between Hamas leader Mahmoud Zahar and Egypt's intelli­gence chief, Omar Suleiman, who has been mediating between Israel and the Islamic militant group in hopes of halting their fight­ing. 
Hamas has taken a much softer stance the past week, but any deal appeared dis­tant. While Egypt clearly is acting as a communications channel between the two sides, Israel insists it won't negotiate with l-lamas, which it considers a terrorist group, as does the United States. 
llamas officials, who previ­ously have called for Israel to first lift its blockade before any truce, could not be reached by The Associated Press late Thursday to comment on the MENA report. There was no immediate reaction from Israel. 

MENA's report came two days after senior members of Hamas said the group was willing to accept a truce lim­ited to the Gaza Strip, drop­ping a long-standing demand that the West Bank be included in a halt to fighting with Israel. 
Israeli officials responded to those comments by saying Israel would keep up military pressure on Hamas as long as the group threatened Israeli civilians, an allusion to near daily rocket salvos at towns in southern Israel and recent militant attacks on border posts. 
The llamas representatives said Tuesday that the group's position would be laid out Thursday during the meeting with Suleiman. 
"We have affirmed the group's approval of a truce in Gaza Strip ... that could be expanded to the West Bank and would be set at six months," Zahar was quoted by MENA as saying after the meeting. 
"Thn truef) should be aeceptP.d by both sides," Zahar added, saying a condi­tion was that Israel "simulta­neously lif'ts its blockade of Gaza and reopens" the bor­der, including the Hafah erossing betwenn Egypt and Gaza.

IN BRIEF Sales, prices of new homes plunge 
WASHINGTON -Sales of new homes plunged in March to the slowest pace in 16112 years as a two-year housing downturn extend­ed into the start of another spring sales season. The median price of a new home in March compared to a year ago fell at the fastest clip in 38 years. 
Sales of new homes dropped by 8.5 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 526,000 units, the slowest sales pace since October 1991, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. 
The median price of a home sold in March dropped by 13.3 percent compared with March 2007. the biggest year-over-year price decline since a 14.6 percent plunge in July 1970. 
Housing, which boomed for five years, has been in a prolonged slump for the past two years with sales and home prices falling at especially sharp rates in formerly hot sales areas. 
Some analysts said they believe the slide in sales may be close to ending although they said any rebound is likely to be slow and anemic with priees continuing to fall, possibly until this time next year. 


Study: Crackdown may cost $1 billion 
WASIIINGTON -The government's plan to crack down on illegal workers could cost employers more than $1 billion a year and legal workers billions in lost wages, a study commis­sioned by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says. 
Those costs are enough to trigger a federal law that would require the Homeland Security Department to analyze more thoroughly the ell'net of' its proposal, said Richard Belzer, a con­sultant hired by the chamber to do the study. It was madn available to The Associated Press on Thursday. 
Tho department's proposed "no match" rule would require employers to fire workers who can't rnsolve mismatches between their name and Social Security number. The chamber opposns the proposal. 
Bnlznr's study will be among public comments submitted to the I Iomeland Security Department on tho proposal. The department could adopt the proposal alter reviewing the comments.

5 people killed in van crash 
Tractor-trailer flips car carrying mentally disabled people to the zoo 
Associa1ed Press 
EIGIITY-FOUH, Pa. -A trac­
tor-trailer slammed into a van 
carrying mentally disabled people 
on a trip to the Pittsburgh Zoo, 
flipping it onto il'i side, crushing it 
against a building and killing five 
people. 
Witnesses told investigators the 
van stopped at an intersection 
and then pulled right in front of 
the semi on a rural highway. 
Crews worked for several hours 
Thursday to remove all the bod­
ies from the van. Seven people 
were injured. 
The accident happened about 
9:45 a.m. in Somerset Township, about 30 miles south of Pitl<>burgh, minutes after the van had left a group home in Bentleyville. 
"I just think it's one of those terrible, sad freak accidents," said Lynne Loresch, executive director of the Mental Health Association of Washington County, the group home operator. 
Loresch said the van was the second of two taking group home residenl'i to the zoo. The first van arrived safnly, but the group was told to return home, where they learned of the erash. 
Threfl residents of the group home and two staff members were killed. The six other people in the van -all residents -were taken to hospitals. The tractor­trailer driver was treated at a hospital and rnleased. 
Authorities said they did not believe the tractor-trailer had bmm speeding. State transporta­tionollidals haulnd it from the scene and plannnd to inspect it. 
The tractor-trailer is owned by Stocker Trucking Co. in Gnadenhutten, Ohio, and was driven by Stephen House, 44, of Uhrichsville, Ohio. A man who answernd the phone at Stocker Trucking dedinod to comment. 
The van was pinned against a cinderblcH:k storage building owned by a home gas-and oil­dnlivery business; a eorner of the building partly collapsed. 
The van was knocked onto its side and pushed roof-first into the building, causing the vehicle's roof to cave in, statfl police Troopnr Frank Lewis said. 
'1\vo of' the dead were removed by paramndics shortly after the aceident, but the bodies of the driver and two residents had to be cut from the wreckage, Washington County Coroner Tim Waren said. 
Killed were the driver, Sheryl Maiolini. 53. of Charleroi; staff member Mary Watkins, 43, of Ellsworth; and residents John

Maise, 61, Richard Paquet, 43, and Julie Hugus, 41. 
Maiolini was a five-year employee with a "superb" driving record, Loresch said. 
The injured residents included three men and three women, who range in age from 48 to 58 years old. 
Two of them had returned to the group home by late after­noon, Loresch said. The others were expected to survive and had injuries that included head, neck and spinal injuries and broken bones, Loresch said. 
Loresch said people in the van that crashed are from the facili­ty's enhanced personal care home, whose residents aren't locked down around the dock. 
Most of the home's residents have schizophrenia or bipolar disorders. Some are there volun­tarily, while others had been at Mayview State Hospital and are making the transition toward more independent living, Loresch said. 
Authorities had no immediate theories about why the van pulled into the path of the truck on state Route 136. 
Jefi Breen of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation's Washington County maintenance office said state officials were aware of safety concerns at the intersection of the two-lane high­way and Brownlee Road, from which the van pulled out. The department had studied the intersection and planned an upgrade, he said, though he wouldn't provide specifics. 
"We will look at it again and see if we will move this project ahead of other projects," Breen said. 
Motorists on Brownlee Road, which travels north and south, must stop at the intersection of Route 136; motorists on Route 136, which travels east and west, do not have to stop. 
Before Thursday, there had been 15 crashes but no fatalities at the intersection over the past five years, said Rich Kirkpatrick, a PennDOT spokesman.

VIETNAM 
Orphanages accused of fraudulent adoptions 
Associated Press 
HANOI -Vietnam ha..<> failed to police its adoption system, allow­ing corruption, fraud and baby­selling to flourish, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report obtained by The Associated Press. 
The nine-page document describes brokers scouring vil­lages for babies, hospitals selling infants whose mothers cannot pay their bills, and a grandmoth­er giving away her grandchild ­without telling the child's mother. 
''I'm shocked and deeply trou­bled by the worst of the worst cases," said Jonathan Aloisi, deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi. 
Vietnam's top adoption official called the concerns "groundless." Bribery of orphanage officials may occur, but serious offenses such as baby-selling or kidnap­ping are not a problem, said Vu Due Long, director of the Department of International Adoptions. 
The dispute comes amid a boom in adoptions from Vietnam. Americans -including actress Angelina Jolie -adopted more than 1,200 Vietnamese children over the 18 months ending March 
31. In 2007, adoptions surged more than 400 percent from a year earlier, with 828 Vietnamese children adopted by American families. 
While China remains the most popular overseas country for adoptions, a growing number of Americans are looking to Vietnam, which has fewer restric­tions. The wait for adoption approval has also gotten longer in China after authorities there tightened rules. 
U.S. adoption agencies active in Vietnam said that despite some cases of wrongdoing, most adop­tions in the country are ethical. 
"Our experience has been a good one," said Susan Cox, vice president of public policy with Holt International Children's Services, based in Eugene, Ore., which has operated in Vietnam since the 1970s. "We are con­cerned about any unethical prac­tices, but I would not agree that these cases are indicative of adoptions in Vietnam." 
Another adoption agency, Families Thru International Adoption, of Evansville, Ind., said that corruption exists everywhere and it is up to the adoption agen­cies to screen who they work with in Vietnam and other countries. 
"There's always somebody that is trying to do something under the table, and when there are children involved, the results are even more horrific," said pro­gram director Salome Lamarche. "As an agency, we have a respon­sibility to be very careful who we work with in a country and to only work with organizations that work in a morally responsible manner."

With each singing of the Alma Mater these past 4 years you've proudly proclaimed "Love thee Notre Dame!" and we know you do. When you look back on your life under the dome, you won't bn disappointed with the memories. But let's face it, the "best­f'our-years-of'-your-life" haven't always been easy. Th(~ Class of 2008 has bf\en through a lot together, and for The Observer's final editorial of' the 2007-08 year. we would like to reflect on some of those rougher moments. Because everyone knows "that which doesn't kill you makes you stronger," right?

No apologies for this senior class 
It would be easy to lose sight of the good yet to come for this year's graduat­ing seniors by focusing on the wars overseas, rising gasoline prices, an unpopular president they have known since throughout their teens or a faltering job mar­ket. Not this year. Not this class. They are my "bros" since they will attend Notre Dame reunions during the same five-year intervals that I attend. So in May, they enter my world -one made personally pleasant or miserable indi­vidually by each of us. 
The late humorist and syndicated columnist, Art Buchwald, was fond of telling seniors during a chaotic year like 2008 that he was proud his generation was leaving them a perfect world. For decades his humor was uplifting to his readers. Ultimately, he wrote his last column which the newspaper held for more than a year before he died of kid­ney failure. In it he wrote, "Each of you has, in your own way, contributed to my life." Yet in actuality, it was Buchwald, even after his death when his final words appeared in print, who helped ease the anxieties of others by explain-ing his choice to refuse to continue dial­ysis. 


Seniors will learn how to face the world as the years pile on their shoul­ders. Since my graduation, I learned that much of the joy or anxiety of others depends upon each individual's sense of sharing. Many may know that Notre Dame football coach Charlie Weis will join other college head football coaches in late May for a visit of our military troops serving in Iraq. These coaches simply did not one morning wake up and wonder how they could share com­fort and good will with the troops. One of my Notre Dame classmates, Mike Whalen, worked for months organizing the initiative with several other Domers currently serving as senior officers in various branches of our military servic­es. 
Whalen is the type of forceful soul whose outlook of life comes from facing the horrors of death during his own mil­itary service during the Vietnam era. He is the earthly version of a guardian angel who smokes cigars. Whalen has scolded University admissions officers when they failed to recognize the genius of a current Notre Dame student they initially rejected whose world wide web accomplishments and fame are as popu­lar as Harry Potter. Whalen unleashed his many talents to assist a soldier about to unjustly face criminal charges brought by a zealous military prosecutor 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Unnecessary sense of entitlement 
I am very excited for Ms. Bradley about the many things at Notre Dame that float her boat ("You know what really floats my boat?," April 24); this school has provided me with an array of opportunities as well. However, while I share the pride of attending this institution with Ms. Bradley and many other students here, I hope that I do not share the haughtiness and borderline arrogance that her letter seems to emanate. 
I was honestly excited tr read Bradley's Hammerstein-esque list of her "favorite things." It did bother me that she told those on this cam­pus who are willing to engage in debate to "shut up." Since when do debate, clever sarcasm and an occasional tongue-in-cheek letter con­stitute "ripping on Notre Dame and each other?" 
Bradley's list contained some examples that, I hope, are not repre­sentative of the student population here. "The concept that at home my friends ask if I am even going to be graduating on time, and my. friends here assume that I am, and then ask what I will be doing next year" is an arrogant statement, not a confident one, and it is every bit as judgmental as the "entitled" students that Bradley references. "The fact that most outsiders hate our school because·, honestly, they're just jealous" is worse; not only does it set Notre Dame up to be an untouchable institution and a paragon of exclusivity, but it also gives those who know nothing about this school an excellent reason to hate it. 
I believe that Notre Dame, like any other organization, has many strengths and many weaknesses. But I would like to think that one of its strengths is its ability to form students who represent the school after graduation with honor and dignity, not cattiness and spiteful­ness towards those who are not members. 
Bradley's letter is a "diatribe" not unlike many of the other letters that she sees fit to respond to. Pride in one's institution and, more importantly, in one's own personal accomplishments is admirable; a false sense of entitlement and arrogance brought about both by one's ego and by one's collegiate standing is not. 
I really hope I'm not reading too much into this letter (and I won't address in depth the assumption that most student's parents fund their $40,000 or more annual bill, since that may have been an inno­cent oversight on your part), but it bothers me when students use a sense of entitlement to carve out their own identities. I am very happy for you that you have had a successful career at this school, and I wish you great success in your future career. I welcome your respons­es, and I sincerely hope that you can prove my reading of your letter wrong. 
Finally, I will give you the last word, as I definitely agree with one of your finer points: Notre Dame is "an experience that will undoubtedly influence the rest of your life." 
Greg Abbracciamento sophomore Morrissey Manor April24 

who refused to allow any consideration of that soldier's post traumatic stress diagnosis. Whalen is but one of many students graduated from Notre Dame who are uniquely operating in the real world beyond our ivy-covered walls. 
Graduating seniors this year have suf­fered through one of the most humbling football seasons in modern history. That suffering certainly qualifies them to wear sandals at graduation as a symbol of their humility. Moreover, the hockey team barely fell short of a championship and others like the Irish team at the National Student Case Study Seminar, for example, also placed second in that academic and professional competition. Yet, many teams won Big East honors through thrilling moments. Having played on the Lyons Hall softball team and lost to Planner Hall in the campus interhall championship, I learned to how to win other championships later on Capitol Hill and in local leagues. Sometimes being part of the hunt is more important than bagging the fox. 
Seniors this year are thrust into a world of special circumstances like my class during the Vietnam War. At rare moments in history we are called upon, as Norman Lear says, to be a reborn American. This graduating class is called upon to strive like Abraham Lincoln to search for a constant rebirth of democracy. They soon will learn how to be a force to change the world for the better either gregariously like Whalen or more humbly through individual efforts as a volunteer at food banks, homeless shelters and other charitable organizations. While each approach is distinctly different, marching loudly in military boots or walking quietly in san­dals both achieve a humanitarian goal. 
Lawrence Ferlinghetti wrote a moving poem in-which he best describes the task ahead of graduating seniors: 
"I am waiting for a rebirth of wonder, and I am waiting for someone to really discover America, and I am waiting for the American Eagle to really spread its wings and straighten up and fly right, and I am waiting for the Age of Anxiety to drop dead ... and I am perpetually awaiting a rebirth of wonder." 
It is nearly time for the Class of 2008 to leave campus on their own quest of wonder. Indications are that the boots and sandals on the ground are prepared for the journey.

Recycle as last resort 

Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. This catch phrase rings like "an apple a day" or "stop, drop and roll." It seems, though, that the first two steps of this trio are often quickly forgotten. 
Now don't get me wrong, I support recy­cling, and, as a resident of Cavanaugh Hall, I look upon our "Trash is Art" Recyclemania trophy with fierce pride. But with the contest over, and St. Ed's and Walsh left wishing they'd stolen a few more bags of cans from BP, I think Notre Dame is called to bigger and better things. 
Did you know that 96 billion pounds -over 25 percent-of America's food goes to waste each year? Or that Americans go through 28 billion plastic water bottles each year? While recycling is clearly preferable to adding to landfills, even more energy is saved when people reuse what they use, and use less to begin with. 
In honor of Earth Week, I ask each member of the Notre Dame community, tree-hugger or not, to commit to these ten very simple tips for conserving energy and decreasing waste. 
1. Your computer should sleep when you do. 
Those 4 a.m. instant messages are not that important. 
2. 
Take a walk, take a bike, take a bus. Avoid driving whenever possible, and consider a hybrid when you hit the real world. 

3. Take shorter and cooler showers. 

4. 
Tell Subway you don't need that plastic bag that you'll get your sandwich out of three seconds later. 

5. 
Bring a mug to get your coffee. Some places will even save you some Flex points for doing so! 


6. Print double-sided. 
7. 
Get a mesh grab-and-go bag and give up on the paper ones. 

8. 
Get a water filter instead of buying bot­tled, and drink from a reusable container. 

9. 
Only take what you will eat at the dining hall, and choose locally grown products. 


10. Then, and only then, please recycle!

"I've got a singular impression that things are movin' too fast," sings Matthew Callanan's character Jamie Wellerstein. It might be a comment on thA show's one-act structure, but "The Last FivA Years," by the Farley Hall PlayArs, which opens tonight at the Mainstage in Washington Hall, is over and done before you know it. But that might not be a bad thing. 
The show is directed by junior Connor Nowalk and stars a pair of singing sophomores, placing Carolyn Rose Sullivan as Cathy Hiatt, an actress who can't seem to catch a break, alongside Callanan's character, a budding novel writer.

But the musical also does something interesting with the story's chronology. It starts at both the beginning and the end. 
When Cathy first takes the stage, five years have spanned and her relation­ship with Jamie is over. Lost and hurt, she sings, "Jamie's over and where can I turn." But then Jamie takes the stage and the story rewinds back to the beginning, where Jamie, on his first date with Cathy, sings a eomical little ditty about being Jewish and in love. From there, Jamie's story progresses forward in time with his career, while Cathy's tale, and career, slides back­ward. 
The show has an impressive amount of singing. "Obviously vocal stamina has been a challenge," Nowalk said, "But its something we knew we were going to have to work on from the beginning, so we got it working from the start." 
Between the two of them, Callanan and Sullivan sing fourteen different pieces before the end of-the one-act, and with no more than a few moments rest between songs. 
As well, each piece has a different feel and style. With violinist Joe Edmonds and pianist Mark Wurzelbacher playing in the baek­ground, Callanan and Sullivan sing through a number of musical genres, expressing their character's love and frustration with one another. 
Cathy's second song begins as a quiet little reflection on a pier, but quickly becomes an aceusatory rant as she berates Jamie for leaving her alone while attending to his rising literary eareer. In the middle of her song, Jamie

addresses are things Nowalk feels stu­dents will be able to relate to. "People can relate to it, the feelings that come up, and it's just a great show. It's not an experience that you want to miss." 
Moreover he feels the show is an excellent showcase for the east. "[The play] shows off the talent here at Notre Dame. We have two incredibly talented performers, singers and actors as well as a violin and piano player." 
But Nowalk said he feels the play does something else. 
"I think that musical theater has a lot of connotations. A lot people think they have a good idea of what it means," he said. "This is a different possibility of what musical theater can be and I think it's a success." 
The Farley Hall Players' show isn't terribly long, and that might be its strength. It dives into the lives Jamie and Cathy, taking the audience along for a ride amidst their love, fear and separation, before coming to a close. And it's a ride, which if experienced, surely won't be regretted.

Associated Press 

PHILADELPHIA Larry Brown wants one more stop on his nomadic coaching career. 
Brown resigned as Philadelphia's executive vice president Thursday with the intent to pursue a coaching job at the NBA or college level. 
Brown has been a win­ner at almost every team from the ABA to the NBA to the college ranks, yet hasn't coached since a bitter split with the Knicks and then-team president Isiah Thomas after one dismal season in New York in 2005-06. 
"He has the taste of 
coaching back in his mouth," said Brown's agent, Joe Glass. "It would be refreshing to have a situation going that he could enjoy, rather than the last one, to say the least." 
Glass said Brown, who won an NBA title with Detroit and a college title with Kansas, would not rule out returning to either level. 
Brown rejoined the Sixers last season as con­sultant and was hired in January 2007 as a VP more than three years after he quit his coaching job to take the same position in Detroit. The 67-year-old Brown 
IN BRIEF Goodell ready to punish
the Patriots if necessary 
NEW YORK -Roger Goodell is fully prepared to crack down again on the New England Patriots if his meeting with Matt Walsh uncovers a tape made of the St. Louis Rams' final walkthrough practice before the 2002 Super Bowl. 
"Taping a walkthrough is much different from what I punished them for," the NFL commissioner said Thursday at a meeting of a group representing the Associated Press Sports Editors. 
After more than two months of negotiations, lawyers for the league and Walsh, the former New England employee, finally reached agreement Wednesday on terms that will allow him to talk Goodell. They include an agreement by the Patriots not to sue Walsh and to pay his legal expenses and his air­fare to New York from Hawaii, where he is now a golf pro. 
resigned as coach of the 76ers in 2003 after six often-turbulent seasons in which he helped rebuild a struggling fran­chise. 
The Hall of Fame coach had a contentious rela­tionship with Allen Iverson, but the two worked together despite several disputes, and reached the NBA finals in 2001. They lost in five games to the Lakers. 
"Larry was born to coach and this is some­thing he and I talked about when I took the job here back in December, so it comes as no sur­prise to me," 76ers presi­dent Ed Stefanski said. 
Ortiz jersey sold for 
$175,000 at cliarity auction 
BOSTON -The Boston Red Sox jer­sey secretly buried under the new Yankee Stadium in a failed curse attempt sold Thursday for $175,100 in a charity auction. 
The bid from Kevin Meehan, the owner of lmperialcars.com in Mendon, Mass., was the highest of 282 for the battered No. 34 David Ortiz jersey. 
"I actually thought it was going to sell for more money," said Meehan, who bid only in the final moments of the weeklong eBay auction that ended at 12:30 p.m. "I have three young boys that I take to the games and they would have killed me if I didn't buy the shirt. " 
The Yankees jackhammered the jer­sey out from under two feet of con­crete earlier this month, then donated it to the Jimmy Fund, the Red Sox's official charity that is affiliated with Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. 
 
Brown rarely attended games or even practices in his second stint. He returned to the organiza­tion to help out his friend and former team presi­dent Billy King, and con­sulted when the 76ers traded Iverson to Denver last season. Not long after Iverson was gone, Brown was promoted. 
Brown has been King's mentor since he hired him as an assistant coach in Indiana. When Brown came ·to Philadelphia in 1997, he brought King with him as vice presi­dent of basketball admin­istration. King became team president after Brown resigned in 2003. 

Gambler ~_leads _Ruilty to betting onlixed NffA games 
NEW YORK -A professional gambler pleaded guilty on Thursday to making bets based on inside tips from former NBA referee Tim Donaghy. 
James Battista told a judge in fed­eral court in Brooklyn he hatched a scheme in late 2006 with another old friend of Donaghy, Thomas Martino, to pay the referee thou­sands of dollars for the information while Battista was "engaged in the business of sports betting." 
Battista's lawyer had notified the court last week that his client want­ed to go to trial rather than plead guilty to charges of defrauding the NBA, as Martino .did earlier this month. But he changed his mind after prosecutors offered a last­minute deal allowing him to instead plead guilty to a lesser charge of conspiring to make illegal bets, said the lawyer, Jack McMahon.

Belles travel to Albion for first leg of MIAAs 
By MEAGHAN VESELIK Sports Writer 
After a bumpy start to its season, Saint Mary's begins the first round of MIAA tour­nament play today as they take on Kalamazoo in Albion, Mieh., at H:30 a.m. 
"Based on how well we've been doing lately as a team, I know we are ready to lay it all on the line this weeken_d," sophomore co-captain Camille Gebert said. "If we want any hope of doing well, we are going to have to play confi­dently, as we have in the later part of our season. I have high expectations for our team in this tournament, as I'm sure we all do." 
The MIAA tournament runs today and Saturday at Albion and nearby Spring Arbor University. Teams will com­pete in the opening rounds today and Saturday with the tournament final being played on Sunday. 
Saint Mary's singles and doubles have both shown irnprovenwnt over the course of' the s1mson. Coming into the season with only two return­ing sophomores and eight f'rnshmen, the Belles had a rough start. Losing thfl~e o[ its first four conference matehns, Saint Mary's turrwd the sea­son around and stepped up its play. 
II e a cl i n g i n to tlw to u rna­lliPnt, llw Belles are presently fourth in tlw MIAA with a 1·onf'ererH"I' record of 5-:{, and I 0-9 oVPrall. Saint Mary's has also been showing a lot more ronsistency in recent mateh­e s . w i n n i ng tlw Ias t f'i v e matdws. This past week1~nd the Belles defeated eonf'Pr­enee rivals Kalamazoo and Alma 6-:{ and S-1. fl~spnetivP­

ly. 
Saint Mary's hopes its recent momentum will carry over into the tournament this weekend, in both their dou­bles and singles. Leadi-ng the Belles this season for doubles has been the No. 1 duo of Gebert and freshman Jillian Hurley, who ended the regular season at 10-9, 6-2 MIAA. 
At the front for Saint Mary's singles this season is Gebert, currently is at 11-8, 5-3 MIAA. Following Gebert is Hurley, whose strong debut season has helped the Belles in scoring many of their wins this spring. Hurley went unde­feated in MIAA play, going 8­0, and 17-2 overall. At No. 3 singles for most of the season has been Reed, whose gone 10-8, 5-3 MIAA. 
Up first for Saint Mary's is a team they beat 6-3 this past weekend, Kalamazoo. If they defeat the Hornets, the Belles will take on the winner of Albion and Tri-State, and if they lose they take on the winner of that match. 
"We play Kalamazoo first round, who we just beat on Saturday," Gebert said. "I know we can get past them, in which we'll be playing the one or two seed, Albion or Calvin, neither of whom are out of our rnach." 
Saint Mary's has high hopes for the conference tourna­mnnt, nspneiaffy after their recent succnssns, consisteney. and momentum. 
"As long as we play likll we know how to play, we will suc­ceed," Gebert said. "It should be a fun weekend. lots or ten­nis, and lots of talent. We'll see what kind of potential WP havn, I'm very optimistic."

Squad -competes for NCAAs 
By ALEX BARKER Sports Writer 

Saint Mary's will put their season on the line this weekend as they continue the MIAA's conference tournament this weekend in Marshall, Mich. 
The Belles currently sit in second place after the first round, just 18 strokes behind Olivet. 
Saint Mary's has proven over the past couple of weeks that it can compete with the best teams in Division III, and hope to automatically qualify for the NCAA Tournament with a first place finish in the conference tournament. 
Since the first round of the quali11er, the Belles have fin­ished second at the Vassar Invitational and sixth at the Illinois-Wesleyan Spring Fling. 
At the Spring Fling, the team's improvement was noticeable as Saint Mary's fin­ished only 7 strokes behind Olivet and shot the same score as the Comets on the final day. 
Leading the Belles' spring charge was freshman Hosie O'Connor and senior captain Katie O'Brien. 
In the Vassar Invitational, O'Connor finished second over­all, one shot off the lead, in the individual standings..Reigning conference MVP Katie O'Brien, who has led the Belles all sea­son, finished in 16th place. 
In the Illinois-Wesleyan tour­nament both women posted totals of 163 placing them in a tie for 17th overall. 
If the Belles fail to pull ahead of Olivet this weekend, their NCAA Tournament hopes still won't be extinguished. The top teams who do not receive the automatic bid from their con­ference tournaments will be thrown into a pool where a selection committee will decide which teams will join the auto­matic bids in the championship. 
Based on their previous results, the Belles have a good chance of being selected if it were to come to the selection committee.

Belles to take shot at regular season crovvn 
By LAURA MYERS Sports Wrirer 
Saint Mary's plays its last reg­ular season game before the conference tournament Saturday afternoon, taking on first-place Tri-State. 
The Belles (22-7 overall, 11-3 MIAA), currently third in the MIAA, have already reserved their spot in the upcoming con­ference tournament. But, with two wins on Saturday, it would be possible for Saint Mary's to become regular season champs. 
The tournament, which begins May 1, is held at the home field of the regular sea­son winner. 
Taking two against Tri-State will not be an easy task, howev­er. The Thunder (26-4, 10-2) have only lost two MIAA games, one against conference co­leader Alma and the other against fourth place Hope. They put together an 11-game win­ning streak earlier in the sea­son extending from March 22 to April 5. 
Belles coach Erin Sullivan said she wants the team to do well, especially because the doubleheader finishes the Belles' season at home. 
"A good fmish of our regular season would be a great moti­vator for the post-season," said Sullivan. 
Saturday is also senior day for the Belles. Pitcher and third baseman McKenna Corrigan, the only senior on the team, will be honored for her commitment to the program. 
Corrigan has been a powerful force for the Belles all season. On the mound, she is 11-0 with a 3. 94 ERA in 81.2 innings pitched. At the plate, Corrigan holds a .330 batting average with 29 RBI and a conference­leading five home runs. 
"[Corrigan] has been a fantas­tic leader for us all season and I am going to miss her love of the game, dedication and personali­ty so much," Sullivan said. 
Sullivan added that Senior Day is an extra motivation for the rest of the team. 
"[Corrigan] deserves a good couple of games in her last time playing here," Sullivan said. 
Sophomore Ashley Peterson may also have something to cel­ebrate Saturday. The Belles' most productive offensive play­er has 51 hits on the season, two shy of the Belles' record. 
Peterson leads the MIAA in batting average (.510), slugging percentage (. 790), on base per­centage, and is tied for the con­ference lead in hits.

Raptors 111ake it a nevv series against Magic 
Associated Press 

TORONTO -With a quick start and quality point guard 
play,  the  Toronto  Haptors  
turned  the  tables  on  the  
Orlando Magie.  

T.J. Ford scored 21 points, Jose Calderon had 18 points and 13 assists. and the Haptors beat the Magie 108-94 on Thursday night, cutting Orlando's lead to 2-1 in their first-round playofl" series. 
"That was the most important game of the season so far and we played like it," Chris Bosh said. "We stepped up to the challenge." 
Ford shot 2-for-17 in the first two games of the series, but looked confident and eomf'ort­able in this one, splitting time almost equally with Calderon. 
"The way those guys played reminded me of just how good those two can be when they're both on their game," Haptors eoach Sam Mitchell said. 
Dwight Howard had 19 poinb and 12 rebounds for the Magi<\ while IIndo Turkoglu added 26 points and Bashard Lewis seored 19.

WOMEN'S TRACK AND FIELD 
Runners go to Hillsdale for relays 
Meet is last chance for Irish to qualify for Big East tournament 
By ALEX BARKER Sports Writer 

The final opportunity for Irish athletes to qualifY for the Big East outdoor championships next weekend is the Hillsdale Relays, beginning today in Hillsdale, Mich. 
Distance coach T!Ill Connelly is looking forward to this weekend's opportunity, but is satisfied with the number of runners that have already qualified for the Irish. 
"We have several athletes whom I believe are capable of still qualifying for the Big East meet," he said. "But overall I would say that the number of Big East/NCAA qualifiers that we have to date is about what we expected." 
Last week's meets produced a number of new qualifiers for the Irish. 
Freshmen Kelly Langhans and Natalie Johnson both qualified to compete in the NCAA regional meet with their times last week in the 800-meter run. 
Sophomore Lindsey Ferguson also met the NCAA regional mark in the 3000-meter steeplechase event. 
Junior Alyissa Hasan had the best meet for the Irish last week, setting school and personal records in the pentathlon with a total score of 5,509 points. Her Notre Dame record also gave her an automatic qualification for the NCAA Regionals in May. 
The Irish will also send two throwers, junior Anna Weber and sophomore Jaclyn Espinoza, to the Drake Relays this weekend in Des Moines, Iowa. 
Both of these women have already qualified for the NCAA Regional meet in their respective events and travel to Iowa with the goal of improving their marks fac­ing off against tougher competi­tion. 
The Irish will also use this weekend to get some of their ath­letes some much needed rest after competing at meets in each of the past two of weekends. 
"This is a really tough time of year for most students with finals approaching, and our athletes are nQ exception," Connelly said. "Sometimes just a weekend of not traveling pays big dividends. Many of our kids have traveled and competed a lot in recent weeks." 
Looking ahead to the Big East meet next week, Connelly has a simple goal for his team: improve­ment. 
"We hope to improve on our indoor finish at the conference meet, with a top three finish our ultimate goal," Connelly said. "With such a young group, that would be a nice improvement."

Along with his teammates, senior Adam Currie will look to improve his time for the men's 800-meter open. Several high-seeded Notre Dame relay teams will partic­ipate in the meet as well. 
For the Hillsdale Relays, the Irish look for one more chance to qualify for the Big East tournament. 
Notre Dame throwers will compete against some of the best in the country. 
Freshmen Greg Davis and John Belcher and junior Jeff Mensch are seeded high in the hammer throw prelimi­naries. In the high jump, jun­ior Blair Macjina is seeded third. Sophomore Matt Schipper and junior Brian Mahon will look to qualify in the men's pole vault.

Wizards rout Cavaliers, close series gap to 2-1 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -LeBron 
.James was serenaded with 
chants of' "over-rated!" as he 
stood at the free throw line late 
in the third quarter, the latest 
humorous twist in an ongoing 
saga that had somehow snared 
-yns, bnlinve it or not -one of'

Washington Wizards. 
Maybe it was the rww haircuts 
sported by four Wizards players. 
Maybe it was tho prnsPncn of' 
Soulja Boy. MaybP it was sight of'

Caron Butler 117 points) and 
i\ntawn .Jamison {15) also found 
thnir ganws. .James didn't havn

Cleveland turnovers had a lot to 
do with it, too. 
"It was a good old f'ashiorwd 
lw hind-kie king." Cl.-ve I and 
mach Mike Brown said. 
Tlu~ victory took thn Wizards oiT the ropes by cutting Cleveland's l~ad to 2-1 in tho first-round snrins. Washington will also host Came 4 on Sunday, when eoaeh Jo:ddie .Jordan's play­ers will havn thn conlidnnen of knowing they arnn't dnstinnd to lw f'orevnr lwxed by .James and Co. Cleveland had won eight straight playoff' ganws against the Wizards, including a first­round sweep a year ago. 
"I don't know about the rapper and haireuts," .Jordan said. "But I think the fans and the way wn played kind of' came together." 
Onn game after setting a fran­chise playoff record with a 30­point win in Game 2, the Cavaliers set another team post­season mark by losing by 36. The margin of victory also set a Wizards franchise playoff mcord. 
The Wizards took eontrol with a pair of 9-0 runs in the first half. They led 49-33 at halftime, and the Cavaliers never thn~at­ened to make a game of it in the seeond half. 
But, oh, the subplots! 
The erowd's big chant was a rnfnrenee to Stevenson's daim that .lames was "overrated" fol­lowing a Wizards' vietory over tho Cavaliers last month. James said responding to that remark would be like Jay-Z responding Lo Soulja Boy -a hip-hop mogul answering a on~-hit wom!P.r.

"II' I was disrespected as an artist, I would have came, too," Stevenson said. "I felt like Soulja Boy felt disrespected, and he came to support the Washington Wizards." 
So will the rapper, whose music was played on the sound systom during the game, bn baek for Came 4'? 
"We got to get him here," Stevnnson said. "We won with him. Me and Gil are suporsti­tious, so we have to get him back." 
What was James' response to all this? first, he said the Wizards' 1·.rowd wasn't nnarly as intimidating as the Detroit fans in last year's playofl's. 
And as for Soulja Boy?

ful at keeping his pitches in the strike zone, not allowing many free passes and inter­changing between his fast­ball, changeup and breaking ball. 
Maust will likely take the mound for the series finale on Sunday. 
Phelps will probably lead off the three-game set Friday, looking to improve on his 5-3 career-record against the Red Storm. He also takes his 
3.38 ERA to the mound to go with his team-high 57 strike­outs this season. 
The junior has only allowed one homerun all season, and is second in the squad among the starters for opponent's batting average at .250. 
Korpi comes into the sec­ond contest with five wins as well, to go with a pair of loss­es. His 4.29 ERA has steadily declined after a pair of shaky starts earlier in the season. One area Korpi has to improve in is his control. The senior has allowed 27 walks this year -15 more than the next closest pitcher. 

For Notre Dame to pick up some key victories this week­end, the Irish bats will have to keep doing what they've been up to in the past month -manufacturing runs on hits and small ball. 
Sophomore centerfielder 
A.J. Pollock leads the team with his .397 batting average, 60 hits, 33 RBis and 18 stolen bases on 19 attempts. Hitting from the three-hole, Pollock has benefited from ·base runners in the lineup before him setting him up with chances to drive in runs. 
One of these players has been sophomore designated hitter David Mills, who has 
found his groove from the two spot, picking up Big East Player of the Week honors last week. Mills is second on the squad with a .376 aver­age, and sports an on-base percentage of .408. 
The sophomore also has been a team player this sea­son, picking up 15 sacrifice bunts thus far, allowing run­ners to advance and score runs. 
The power in the lineup comes from junior first base­man Evan Sharpley, Ryan's brother. The junior has a team-high nine homeruns and is third on the club with 30 RBis, to go with his .351 average. 
After the St. John's series, the Irish will return to action against Mississippi Valley State on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week.

"Stahl had a great tourna­ment," Bayliss said. "He has really made a lot of improve­ments overall in his game. I was impressed by the way he served for the match against University of Southern Florida [in the championship match]."

Florida State features three ranked 'singles players in their singles lineup, the leader being No. 15 Jean­Yves Aubone. Aubone has twelve wins over ranked opponents this season. 
"They had a rough match against Miami," Bayliss said. "That hurt their ranking and they fell in the rankings this week." 
This weekend will mark the seventh time the teams have met. The Irish have won the last four meetings between the two teams. 
With Parbhu's combined five wins this past weekend, he is one win away from 200 wins for his career. His next win will make Parbhu only the fourth player in Notre Dame history to reach that milestone. The list includes current assistant coach Ryan Sachire, David DiLucia and Andy Zurcher. Parbhu is fifth in singles wins with 121, and tied for fourth with 78 dou­bles wins for his career. 
"Parbhu is a great student," Bayliss said. "He will proba­bly go pro after this season, and then pursue his medical degree in the future. He has a high GPA as well." 
Bayliss noted the amount of 4-3 wins the Irish earned early in the season, and how Notre Dame's luck has changed in recent weeks. 
"We earned a lot of 4-3 wins early in the season and rose to No. 9 in the rank­ings," Bayliss said. "We have lost a lot of the close matches lately, but we have picked up a little bit since." 
The Irish will play the Seminoles on Saturday with matches beginning at 1 p.m.

"It's a huge confernnce rivalry, so I'm nxpncting it to be a tough game," Coyne said. "We think we match up really well. Over the last few years, it's been one of thosn back-and-forth type series, so the f'aet that we jumped out to a little bit of a lead on them in thn first half wa..:; surprising. I'm thinking it's going to be a one or two goal game." 
Freshman Shaylyn Blaney led the Irish attack in their first meeting with the Hoyas, scoring thre1~ goals while junior Jillian Byers, the program's all-time leading scorer, wa..<> held to one. Junior goalie Erin Goodman made 15 saves in the game to secure the win. 

Byers (61 goals), Blaney (35 goals) and senior captain Caitlin McKinney (35 goals, 21 assists) will look to jump on Georgetown early again, while sophomore Gina Sciascia (15 goals, 29 assists) will serve as the offense's main distributor. 
The Irish have won six of their last eight dating back to the home loss to Syracuse, and one of those losses came at No. 1 Northwestern on April 9. Ever since losing two of three over spring break in California, Coyne said her team has played much better and consistent lacrosse. 
"We had our ups and downs on the California swing, but those games have really helped prepare us for this opportunity," she said. "If we don't know what we're about and we don't know what it takes to win, we're not going to do it. We've played enough games to where we know our team and we know our strengths." 
Though Coyne said wins against Georgetown tonight and Cornell on May 3 might get the Irish an at-large berth into the NCAA Tournament, she expects her team to be solely focused on accomplishing a goal it set at the beginning of the year. 
"Our best chance of controlling our own destiny is to win the Big East; that way everything is taken care of," she said. "We want to win. It's not about finish­ing second. That's what we want, and I think we're going to do it." 
Notre Dame's game is sched­uled to begin 45 minutes after the conclusion of the first semifi­nal between Syracuse and Rutgers (7-9, 2-3 Big East), which is set to start at 5:30 p.m. The winners will meet for the Big East championship in the stadium at noon on Sunday.
