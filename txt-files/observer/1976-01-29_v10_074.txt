Absenteeism approaches 25°/o 

idemic grips campus

by Mike Vlllanl Staff Reporter 

,;'II 
An epidemic, according to Notre Dame biology professor Ralph E Thorson, "occurs when a large number of a cetain areas' popula­tion are affected by a specific disease." 
Such is the case on the Notre Dame campus where classroom absences approach 25 per cent yesterday due to the existence of an irritating flu bug. Prof. Thorson, a parisitologist, suspects this flu bug to be a new strain of influenza virus, whose origin and length of duration have yet to be found. 
According to Dr. Robert Thomp­son. University physician, it "wouldn't be inaccurate to guess that its start began over Christman recess and spread on campus with the return of the students and a change in weather. He recommen­ded rest, high fluid intake and to avoid contact with known sources. 
The change in weather and improper dress [no hats, open coats] have helped to contribute to the recent outbreak of the flu. If already under the weather, it is recommended that you get plenty of sleep, and have a high fluid intake. A cancelling of 8 O'clock classes would go far to n>medy the lack of sleep problem.

Tomorrow marks the start of Mardi Gras, the traditional winter event for Notre Dame and St. Mary's. Mardi Gras will last until Sunday, Feb. 8. 
Mardi Gras committee member Peggy Foran indicated some of the problems they've run into. "Mardi Gras has a spirit all its own; but with anything which involves prep­arations, problems do arise." 
She continued. "Our biggest problem right now is getting enough time to do everything and getting enough manpower to do it." 
Foran singled out senior John Hedges as an example. "John's work has just begun," she said. "He is in charlle of bookkeepin~ 
Algerians report violence against Moroccan troops 
ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -Algeria reported "violent combat" Wed­nesday between Moroccan and Algerian troops in a cold, bleak area of the Spanish Sahara as other Arab countries scrambled to avert a desert war between the two North African neighbors. 
There were no independent re­ports of the second day of fighting on the rock-covered plains, and the official Moroccan press agency said it had no confirmation of the Algerian communique. 
Algeria, which opposes the plan­ned division of the phosphate-rich territory between Morae and Maur­itania when Spain ends colonial rule Feb. 28, said the fight ran from morning through afternoon. 
The Algerian government news agency did not specify the place but said the clash was in relation to one Tuesday, reported around Amg­hala oasis about 175 miles south­west of the Algerian border along the Saharan frontier with Mauri­tania. Moroccans have also clashed in recent weeks with Saharan guerrillas of the pro independence Polisario liberation front in the area. 
There was no mention of casual­ties or the number of troops involved Wednesday. A Moroccan official had said there apparently were many deaths in Tuesday's action. 
The-.combat area is covered by dry washes and stagnant marshes with low bushes. Sand dunes are a rarity, and at this time of year temperatures are often below freezing. Constant icy winds whip up dust storms. 
In the diplomatic effort, Pres­ident Anwar Sadat of Egypt and Habib Bourguiba of Tunisia were reported to have telephoned both President Houari Boumedienne of Algeria and King Hassan II of Morocco. 
Boumedienne talked with Pres­ident Hafaz Assad of Syria, who dispatched his army chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Hikmat Chihabi, to Algiers. 
Sr. Miriam Dolores, infirmary administrator, estimated a report­ed student cases since Tuesday, Jan. 20 and suspects that many more exist. In the past two days, 30 students have remained over­night for short-term ivsits. Sr. Dolores attributed the number of recent cases to "improper dress and contact with known sources." 
When questioned as to the possibility of administering flu vaccine to the student body, Thompson said ''there would not be a sufficient time period for the immunity to take hold and would would therefore be useless.'' Thompson cited Holy Cross Hall as showing the earliest indication of the influenza and claimed that to his knowledge and that of local practioners only a few faculty members were among the original cases reported. However, such cases have increased in number since faculty-student contact began with the new semester. 
Investigation on the St. Mary's campus revealed similar condi­tions. 
According to Mrs. Verna Woods, director of student health, 63 influenza cases have been reported since Sunday, Jan. 18, and the seven-bed infirmary has been ex­tended to 18 of which 14 beds are occupied. 
At present the Notre Dame infirmary is waiting for results from samples sent to Indianapolis, which will help determine the virus' origin and lenght of duration. 
It appears that this inflrJCnza is confined to the Notre Dame con­munity. County Physician Dr. William McCraley claimed that no epidemic exists in the city or county. 
However. there may be residents of the county who are ill and do not report to their doctors or clinics for reasons of cost. The free health service at Notre Dame enables the infirmary to get a better idea as to the extent of the illness here.

Jury selection closed 
SAN FRANCISCO -Acting at the request of both sides, a federal judge abruptly closed jury selection in the Patricia Hearst bank robbery trial to the press and most of the public yesterday. 
The unexpected secrecy, believed to be without precedent in this federal court district, was imposed only momements after U.S. District Court Judge Oliver J. Carter invited the press to follow him to an adjoining courtroom for questioning of potential jurors on the impact of publicity about the case. But they found the doors locked.

WASHINGTON -President Ford lost his first battle of the 1976 session with the Democratic Congress on a spending issue yesterday. -The Senate, by a comfortable a70-24 margin, joined the House in overriding Ford's veto of a $45 billion money bill and thus enacted it into law. The House rejected the veto Tuesday 310 to 113. 
The appropriations measure carries funds for politically popular health, welfare and job programs, but it is almost $1 billion over the President's budget request.

The Faculty Senate is sponsoring discussions in response to a faculty referendum conducted last spring. At that time, 25 per cent of the faculty indicated they favored col­lective bargaining, 25 per cent said they opposed it, and SO per cent requested more information. The discussions were designed to present both sides of the issue in an informative manner. 
Members of the faculty panel tonight will be professors Fred­erick Dow, John Lyon, Edward Manier and Michael Francis. 
April of this year. The play is billed at Beckett's apocalyptic vision of life in the aftermath of nuclear holocaust. 
In "Endgame", there are but four characters -a blind man who cannot walk, his arthritic servant who cannot sit, and the blind man's parents, who are nearly vege­tables. They present an embittered yet fascinating picture: of life. 
Cluchey, who grew up in Chica­go's South Side, founded the San Quentin Drama Workshop as an inmate at the prison in 1957. A celebrated writer himself, Cluchey has experimented with the works of Beckett since early 1961. Recently he assist~.d Beckett in the play­right's own production of "Waiting for Godot" in West Berlin. 
The San Quentin Drama Work­shop has been highly endorsed by Beckett. He permits them to perform any of his works without payment of royalty. The Workshop has played extensively throughout the United States and Europed, to wide critical acclaim.

AnTostal preparations underway 
by Joe Straub Staff Reporter 
In the spring semester, students have two big events to look forward to--Mardi Gras and An Tostal. 
An Tostal is an ancient Gaelic term meaning "festival" and Notre Dame's Hall President Council sponsors a three-day affair that is just that--quite a festival. 
This year, An Tostal will run from Thursday, April 22, through 

British mercenaries go to fighting Angola 
LONDON (AP) -Dozens of tough 

looking British mercenaries, hired 
to fight in Angola, flew out of 
London for Africa on Wednesday. 
They were bound via Burssels for 

Kinshasa, Zaire, which backs the 
Western-supported liberation 
group known as the National Front 
-FNLA -in heighboring Angola. 
The FNLA and its ally, the National Union-UNITA-has been losing to Soviet-backed forces of the Popular Movement -MPLA -in the civil war for control of the former Portuguese colony. 
The men were generally close­

mouthed and dodged photograph­
ers as they went through security 
checks and sat drinking tea await­
ing their flights. 
But some were quoted as saying 

they had been recruited by a firm 
called Security Advisory Services 
inSurrey, a county soughwest of 
Londod, and were to be paid $300 a 
week, tax free, by the Zaire 
government. 
Between 40 and SO men departed on a first flight and about 100 others followed later Wednesday. 
''This is a spearhead. There could be a lot more following," one of the many Scots in the group said before boarding the plane. He spoke with a reporter from Bre­nards, a news agency specializing in airport coverage. 
It was the first reported move­ment of troops from Britain into teh conflict, where South African mer­cenaries have backed one faction in the south. Some 10,000 Cuban soldiers are reported fighting for the MPLA. The U.S. Congress is blocking Ford administration ef­forts to support the FNLA. 
The British government has re­mained officially neutral in the struggle, deploring all foreign in­tervention. 
The London Evening Standard identified the recruiters as Les Aspin, not to be confused with the Wisconsin congressman of the same name and Frank Perren. Another recruiter, named as ex­paratrooper John Banks, was re­ported to have taken off with the contingent.

Sixty-four students attended the first meeting of the An Tostal committee last week. Bob Quakenbush heads this year's group, with Don Opal and Mary Siegel serving as assistants.

Brenards quoted a 6-foot-6 for­mer paratrooper in dark glasses, leather jacket and jeans who re­fused to give his name as saying: "We're in it for the money, nothing else. 
"We've been told to keep our mouths shut. This is worth hun­dreds of pounds to me, and there's no way I can get that kind of money doing anything else." 
"I found out about the job through a friend who had a friend who knew someone." 
Brenards quoted the Scotsman as saying the men had been promised a month's paid leave after six months of fighting and an air ticket ''to anywhere in the world" at the end of their service. 
The mercenaries were closely checked by Belgian state police before they left Brussels for Kinsha sa aboard a charted flight. 
A man who was wearing dark glasse and was not identified accompanied the group. He said: ''These men are going to fight world communism. Since Ameri­cans don't want to do anything, some people have to. In a few weeks, I'll be back with pictures of Communist prisoners." 
BAnks said the men had been recruited by Maj. Norman Hall, an adviser to FNLA leader Holden Roberto, who had also recruited for the Irish Republican Army and was linked to Middle East arms traders. 
Banks said four other smaller groups of British mercenaries passed through Brussels earlier on their way to Angola.

EDITOR'S NOTE: This Is the second part of a tre-partlte article by Kathy Mills, Observer Staff Reporter. In this series, we shall examine the situation and phUosophy of drinking at Notre Dame. 
In view of the facts and the large number of college students who drink, the alcohol conference, cosponso.red by the NIAAA and Notre Dame's student govern­ment, stressed prevention of alcoholism and emphasized the need to promote attitudes of "responsible drinking" es­pecially on college campuses. 
"We must address ourselves to the 
business of prevention. This is the key to 
the goal of re-educating and preventing 
alcoholism and alcohol abuse in our 
country." Donald G. Phelps, director of 
the Division of Prevention of the NIAAA, 
t01d the delegates to the conference. 
Phelps also noted academic communities are often the places where people take their first drinks. "This may be the most ·mrwrtant one," he added. There are pressures to drink on the campuses, delegates noted, and, because of these pressures and the desire to belong and be accepted, a "responsible decision-making may not occur." Representatives from the University of Wisconsin at Madison point­
ed out the example of a student, they said, who was being initiated into a fraternity. His blood alcohol level (BAL) reached 0.4 percent during one of the initiation rites, and he died as a result of this. (A BAL of 
0.1 percent is considered "under the influence" for traffic purposes in most states. Yet even a BAL of 0.04 percent can impair a driver's judgement and ability.) 
First. the three average film!>. Todd browning's Freaks was released five years ago, amidst a great deal of publicity generated by the fact that the film had been under censor's ban for 30 years. Offended by the multitude of deformed physiques in the film (snake-skin women, two-headed men, left-overs from Rugby games), it was decided that the movie was objectional, probably by someone with a weak stomach. Later, de-sensitized by pictures on TV, the censors let the film out on the streets. Once the ban was lifted, the crowds came out in droves to see this circus melodrama. The characters in the film are 
treated as "normal" people in a "normal " 
dramatic situation, and it is this problem 
with the suspension of disbelief that leaves 
the film somewhat unsatisfying.

~~Exam tomorrow? let's go drinking" a look at student alcoholism at ND 
Kath~ Mills 
One way to promote an attitude of responsibility in drinking, delegates said, is to provide alcohol education and information. At the University of Nebra­ska, journalism students compiled, wrote and published an overview booklet on alcoholism. Washington University in St. Louis, Mo., is one of several schools with courses in alcoholism. Barnum called courses of this nature "ideal", but added she does not know if Notre Dame students would accept such a course if it were offered. Metropolitan Community College in Minnesota offers a two-year associate degree training program which is structur­ed like a two-year program for registered nurses. Students in the program are offered l3 three-credit courses on drugs and alcohol. 
A recent survey indicates that there are over 600 campuses where wine apprecia­
nwhat's the best way to enjoy a drink? Slowly'' 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
tion courses are offered for credit or through extension or continuing education programs. According to the Wine Insti­tute, these courses promote drinking awareness because students recognize overindulgence is contrary to that taste a­wareness. "To understand the history, traditions and technology of wine, itis necessary to devote some thought to the role wine has played in other cultures, to the alcohol content of wine and to the role of wine in one's own life," Wine on Campus, a publication of the Wine Insti­tute points out. Administrators at the University of Northern low a have instituted 
Humphrey Bogart as a returning convict, set on re-gaining his turf among the "Dead End Kids"(later the Bowery Boys). The film inspired a whole slough of social-re­form dramas in the late Depression. Gregg Toland did the camera work(he also did the -work on Citizen Kane and Night at the 
Opera among others.) 

The third "average" film is also in the 
"Man in the City I' series. Mickey one 
was directed by Arthur Penn (Bonnie and 
Clyde, Little Big Man, Night Movies) and 
stars Warren Beatty as a stand-up com1c 
(Lenny Bruce?) who is running away from 
everybody and everything in a1Kafkaesque 
city that turns out, upon examination of the 
film, to be shot in Chicago. Its ambitions 
exceed its accomplishments, resulting in a 
general uneasiness. 

West Side Storydirectly preceeds Mickey 
One in the 'City'' series, and begins the 
category "good films". If you haven't 
;een it yet, I recommend' this musical 
adaptation of the Romeo and Juliet theme 
for its imagination, vitality and choreo­
graphy. If you know the film, then you'll 
knpw if a second viewing is worth it for 
you. 

The second "good" movie is Josef Von 
Sternberg's last film The DevU Is a 
Woman, which stars Marlene Dietrich as a 
19th Century Femme Fatale who pits lover 
against lover. Dietrich says she has never 
ltrked more beautiful than she does in this 
film. 

Now for the six excellent movies planned 
for thi:; semester. Perhaps the largest 
draw for the season is scheduled for this 
Friday: Last Tango In Paris. Cinema '76 
has scheduled three movies with excellent 
women's roles in them. Maria Schneider ·plays opposite Morlon Bran do, two people who meet when trying to rent an apartment in Paris, and remain for three days to complete one of the most intense and exciting screen trysts ever. . 
Jeanne Moreau's role in Truffaut's Jules 
a "Wine 'n' Dine" program on the campus. Each week, a group of students dines with four to six faculty members on six gourmet courses accompanied by wine. 
According to Time magazine, the liquor industry has also noted a need to promote responsible drinking. Time quoted Jack Hook, board chairman of the National Alcoholic Beverage Control Association, as telling of plans to use "the unmatched power of education to convince every American, young and old, that responsible drinking is the only kind that anyone would tolerate." Licensed Beverage Industries, Inc., the public representative of the distillers, allots $250,000 each year for a national advertising campaign that pro­motes responsible drinking, Time noted. One ad urges, ''Know when to say when.  and another encourages, "If you can't stop drinking, don'f start driving." In 1973, 
Time said, Seagram's spent $250,000 for 
magazine advertisements against exces­
sive drinking. In 1974, the Distilled Spirits 
Council of the United States, Inc. (DISCUS) 
had as the theme for a consumer advertis­ing program the slogan "If you choose to drink, drink responsibly." One ad sponsored by DISCUS says, "What's the best way to enjoy a drink? Slowly." Another ad paid for by the liquor industry asks "Your're old enough to drink. But are you mature enough?" Ads of this type, 
Time pointed out, are obviously contrary to those directed toward the young that imply not even a weekend in the country 

Fred Grauer 
and Jim signaled another revolution in the treatment of women in films, calling for a higher, more absolute morality among film 
women .It's abeautiful story of two fritmds: one French and one German, who meet as students before World War I, fight on opposite sides in the war, and return to face the reality of loving the same woman, whom one of them has since married. 
Celebrating the changing face of Amer­ICa in the light if commg urbanism( say that fast and sees what happens), Orson Welles' Magnificent Ambersons remains perhaps his greatest triumph of actor directing. Agnes Moorehead, Joseph Cotten and other stalwarts from Welles' Mercury Theatre Company perform an exceptionally crafted film, with stunning visuals, and a tense, insightful perspec­tive. 
In a bit of smart scheduling, that film about the coming of urbanism precedes the "Man in the City" series. Initiating that series is Charlie Chaplin's City Lights. The

can be truly enjoyed without drinking. 
Although educational and informational programs are gaining in acceptance at colleges, Jon Jensen, state alcohol preven­tion co-ordinator for North Dakota, ques­
tioned whether they, alone, will make a difference in drinking patterns. Jensen cited the information campaign on cigar­ettes, and noted more people smoke cigarettes despite the campaign. 
The atmosphere and enviornment in 
which students drink can determine their 
drinking habits, delegates to the alcohol 
conference said. They pointed out campus 
bars, especially student union bars, can 
promote responsible drinking through 
atmosphere. The Rathskeller at the 
University of Wisconsin at Madison looks 
like an open cafeteria and is the student 
meeting place on campus. The "Rat" 
serves beer, but students do not make a 
"big deal" out of it. Some of the 
conference delegates visited Senior Bar on 
the Notre Dame campus and said its 
relaxed atmosphere is conducive to respon­
sible drinking. They pointed out the 
students at the bar did not simply drink. 
but they also danced. Membership in the 
Senior Bar is restricted to seniors 21 and 
over. It is operated by a general manager 
and two assistant managers, all students. 
These managers are responsible for 
keeping order. Student bartenders are 
also responsible for the amount of alcohol 
they serve to individuals. 
Several delegates also commended the 
Notre Dame "Quickie," a shuttle bus 
which transports students to the Michigan 
bars and restaurants. (The legal drinking 
age in Indiana is 21 while it is 18 in 
Michigan The Quickie eliminates the 
necessity tor students to drive home from 
Michigan after drinking. It was begun and 
is run by students, and the bus carries two 
volunteer students to help sic~ passengers. 


silent film made in the midst of the talkie boom, tells of the tangling lives of the Tramp, a millionaire, and a blind flower girl. Perhaps one of the mosttouching and memorable moments in film history occurs at the climax of the film, as the Tramp watches the girl regain her sight The camera focuses on Charlie's face·, and we see the joy of the girl's new sight and the realization of her love for him witnessed in his eyes. 
At tile end ot this senes 1s John Schlesinger's masterful Midnight Cowboy, starring Dustin Hoffman as "Ratso Rizzo" and Jon Voight as "JoeiBuck." A must-see especially if you're only familiar with the balderized version shown on TV last year. 
Finally, at the end of the year, when you 
think you've seen it all, they bring 
in Fellini's Amarcord. Definitely one of 
Fellini's finest movies, the title mean "\ 
Remember", and the movie is a touching, 
funny and sad memoir of the coming of age 
of a young man in an Italian village.

Publication of intelligence to come to House vote 
WASHINGTON (AP) -A decis­ion on whether to publish details of secret U.S. intelligence operations in the final report of the House intelligence committee was ordered W cdnesday to be put to a full vote uf the House. 
The House is expected to act Thursday on a resolution approved in the House Rules Committee that the intelligence committee be dir­ected not to publicly release the information unless it gets approval from President Ford to do so. 
The Rules Committee action was a victory for the committee's senior Republican, Rep. Robert McClory of Illinois, and three other mem­bers who contended that public disclosure of the secret information would violate an agreement that had been worked out with Ford to obtain it. 
However, much of the informa­tion on operations including U.S. submarine spying on the Soviets and CIA support for Angolan troops and Italian political parties has already been publicly disclosed through news leaks. 
Chairman Otis Pike, D-N.Y., estimated to the Rules Committee that "interest-wise or titillation ­wise" about 75 per cent of the report has already been publicly disclosed. 
Asked why his panel had voted 9 to 4 to publicly disclose the secret information without reszard to an _,greement giving the President the 
ina! word on disclosure, Pike gave 
he Rules Committee two basic 
easons. 
First, he said, "the majority '·onclusion of the committee was ~ imply that we could not sweep the 
trocious and horrendous things · nder the rug." 
Second, Pike said, "we could not ' arry out our mandate if we said to the President -and that means saying to the CIA and the FBI -you can veto anything you want in our final report.'' 
The committee had agreed to a compromise with Ford in Septem­ber after a confrontation over secrecy. The panel said it would not disclose any secret information whose disclosure Ford personally declared would be detrimental to the national security unless the committee went to court for author­ity to do so. 
But Pike and the committee majority contended that no such agreement could dictate what the committee could say in its final, official report to the full House. 
The action by the Rules Commit­tee put to the full House the decision on whether the secret information could be publicly dis­closed. 
ground music with 15 minutes of a "whirring, soft air-like roar," sim­ilar to the sound of surf. 
The embellishments are part of a $90,000 "office-landscaping" proj­ect recommended by the General Services Administration to save money by substituting foliage and low room dividers for costly interior walls, Lawlor said. 
The GSA says it developed the concept for offices of federal agen­cies so they can be expanded or made smaller simply by moving around the portable room dividers and plants. 
"We're using this new concept throughout our four-state region and it's unquestionably saving us money -especially with all the changes that are constantly being made in the size and shape of federal offices," a GSA spokesman said. 
But some employees in the manpower administration think the project may be a waste of money at a time when the department's own programs are being cut back.

"Here we are facing cuts in badly needed job training pro­grams and they're spending $10,000 for plants," said one staff member, who asked that his name not be disclosed. "Somebody's got their priorities mixed up." 
The plants were supplied by Courtney Borrecco, owner of the California Street Nursery, who said they cost $57 each, plus another $57 for each ceramic holding pot. 
Borrecco said he has a $1,100 -a ­year contract to take care of the plants.

WASHINGTON--U.N. Ambassador Daniel Moynihan received full pub­lic support Wednesday from Pres­ident Ford and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger after a new con­troversy arose involving Moynihan. 
The ambassador had sent a classified cable to Kissinger last week complaining that elements in the State Department are under­mining his work at the United Nations. 
In the cable, which became public Wednesday, Moynihan also said he had made progress in breaking up an anti-American vot­ing bloc in the U.N. 
Ford issued a statement saying he "completely approves of and supports the way Moynihan con­ducts his office at the United Nations." 
Ebony editor is 
director of this private organiza­tion. 
This is the first lecture in the series for the second semester. Last semester three talks were given. The series is funded in part by a grant form the S and H Foundation and is sponsored by the College of Business Administra­tion. 
Series co-director Prof. William Heisler said the talks are aimed primarily at business students, but that the entire Notre Dame com­munity is invited, as well as members of the Michiana business 1 ommunity. He said faculty from aearby colleges have also attended . he talks in the past. 
"The series is an explanation of :he nature of work in our society, and what can be done to make it more human and Jess alienating," Heisler explained. 
The series continues this semes­ter with talks by Mills; Dr. Francis Fiorenza, asst. prof.of theology at Notre Dame, on ''Critical Theology and Work" on March 2; Irving Bluestone, vice-president of UA \· International and director 1 of th General Motors Department i1 Detroit, on ''The Design of Human istic Work: What can Labor do?· on April 28; and other programs, t be announced.

Kissinger also said he was fully behind Moynihan, "who is doing an outstanding job in the United Nations with the full support of the President and the Secretary of State and the Department of State." 
In New York, Moynihan said he had received Ford's go-ahead to continue "committed but candid American participation" in the United Nations. 
''The Pre~ident called me at midday to express his complete confidence in the manner in which United States policy is being car­ried out by the U.S. mission to the United Nations," Moynihan said in a statement. 
At the White House, Press Secretary Ron Nessen said of Moynihan's complaint: "It's a routine exercise in Washington bureaucracy that not everybody always agrees with what someone else might be doing." 
At the State Department, spokesman John Trattner read a statement to reporters which he said had been approved by Kissin­ger, saying: "Newspapers must ask themselves what their respons­ibility is when they consider pub­lication of such documents." 
Late last year Moynihan all but 
publicly charged Kissinger and the administration generally with fail­ing to support his statements in the 
U.N. criticizing the tactics of some black African leaders.

I Irish win gang war against DePaul
I 
by Ernest Torrlero 
They looked like the roughest, meanest bunch the city of Chicago could send. It was the Blue Demon gang, the vengeful group which controls the collegiate basketbar, underworld in the Windy City. They came to Indiana to make a hit on the proud, arrogant Irish. But somehow the plan went amiss and the men from the west were driven back to sleep with the fish in Lake Michigan. 
"It was a very physical game," said a man named Digger whose mob had just buried the roughians from DePaul, 89-68. 
"We were just beaten by a better team," conceded Ray Meyer, ring­lo:ader of the Demon bunch and a man who has been unsuccessful ten out of eleven times in gaining revenge over the Irish clan to which he formerly belonged. 
The leading hit man for the Irish once again was junior Adrian Dantley. The 6-5,210 pound Wash­
ington import, hit for 31 points on twelve of seventeen field goals and seven of eleven free throws. His performance earned him the Wen­dell Smith A ward reserved for the most valuable performer in the Notre Dame-DePaul grudge match. 
''Adrian Dantley seems to have a sixth sense for positioning himself for rebounds and drawing fouls," Meyer continued. "He's position­ing himself for a rebound correctly before the guy even makes up his mind to shoot.'' 
For a while it appeared Notre Dame had come with unloaded guns. Front-liners Joe Ponsetto, Andy Pancratz and Dave Corzine notched the first three marks on the scoreboard and after a minute and a half of play, DePaul was up, 6-0. 
All through the first half, DePaul was relying on pivotman Corzine to generate the Demon offense. His dump passes, give and go's, re­bounds and shots off of return feeds, helped DePaul to climb to a 22-15 advantage with eleven min­utes left. 
From that point on the Irish took over, scoring 16 quick points while DePaul could only muster up two baskets. After Duck Williams and Toby Knight combined for the first eight points of the spurt, Phelps replaced everyone except Dantley. When the onslaught was over, Notre Dame was up, 33-28. The five-point edge held up till half­time, 45-39.

afro-haired Demon to foul out at the 4:44 mark. Batton out-scored Corzine, 16-10, and more import­antly out-rebounded him, 10-3. The Irish had succeeded in their goal of controlling the boards as they held a 48-38 advantage in that category. 
"We wanted to take Corzine to the outside," said Batton. "When I shoot well from the outside, it brings the center out. Corzine is real powerful when he is inside. But he is not as mobile as many of the centers we face." 
"Dave Batton played one of his better games," Phelps agreed. "He has gained the confidence to play that way. We are really counting on him with Bill Laimbeer ineligible.''

In this first tournament, Kathy lost first place after losing a fence-off, in a tie for first place to Karen Beckman. Beckman, the same age as Valdiserri, has since gone on to compete with North­western University, and has be­come one of Kathy's biggest com­petitors. Last year Beckman won the Great Lakes Tournament, while Kathy took third. "She is one of my biggest rivals,'' says Kathy. Every time we fence, it's only a one point difference between us. But she always manages to come up ahead,'' said Kathy.
