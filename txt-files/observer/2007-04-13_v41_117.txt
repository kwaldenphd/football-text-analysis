Student Affairs undergoes resbucturing 
Coughlin promoted to assistant vice president, Poorman reassigns departments to supervisors 
By MARCELA BERRIOS Associate News Editor 
The Division of Student Affairs began restructuring its chain of command Thursday with the announcement of the promo­tion of director of the Student Activities Office (SAO) and LaFortune Student Center, Brian Coughlin, to the recently created position of assistant vice president of Student Activities. 
Coughlin's promotion marked the beginning of a reorganization that will redistribute the different 
departments under the Division's umbrella to differ­ent supervisors, including Coughlin. 
"Brian is a gifted, experi­enced and astute adminis­trator who has Jed the Student Activities Office through a period of substan­tial growth over the last six years," Father Mark Poorman, vice president of Student Affairs, said in a press release. 
Coughlin will continue to head his office's activities, but in hiS new role he will report directly to Poorman, "freeing up" the department by reducing bureaucratic red 
tape. The SAO had previous­ly fallen under the jurisdic­tion of Division Assistant Vice President David Moss, who also supervised the Office of Drug and Alcohol Education (ODAE). 
"These changes can be seen as an acknowledgement of the SAO's expansion and growth in the last six years and the staff's continued hard work and commit­ment," Coughlin said. ''I'm excited about the new orga­nizational structure because it elevates the SAO to its own category." 
Coughlin will oversee the SAO, broken into two 
branches, Student Activities for Programming and Student Activities for Facilities. Peggy Hnatusko and Ryan Willerton, associ­ate directors of Student Activities, were also promot­ed Thursday to head the Programming and the Facilities divisions, respec­tively. 
"This model is consistent with other student activities structures at major universi­ties across the country, and is the most effective way for us to provide students with the highest quality of pro-

Protester, Saint Mary's debate Iraq war 
Sheehan encourages nonviolent activism 
By KELLY MEEHAN Senior Staff Writer 
Hell froze over last weekend, anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan said, as snow fell on President Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas -a place where she has spent many of her days protesting the war in Iraq. 
"Hell will freeze over when our troops can come home," she said, calling the unexpect­ed southern snowfall a sign from the universe that "we will prevail, and we will be suc­cessful" in ending the conflict in Iraq.

SBPDunits respond to traffic block 

Driver abandons car, prompts manhunt 
By KAITLYNN RIELY Assistant News Editor 
Several South Bend police units surrounded an area near the 800 block of Sorin Street in South Bend late Wednesday night after a driv­er blocked traffic by parking his car near a curb and then ran away from the vehicle, SBPD Public Information spokeswoman Teri Lanning said in an e-mail to The Observer Thursday. 
Notre Dame senior Emily Kane was headed toward a friend's house on Corby Boulevard around 11 p.m. when she saw "three or four" police cars lining Notre Dame toward Route 23. 
"The cop from the megaphone told us to go inside," Kane said. "He said they had K-9s looking for someone." 
Senior Michael Rossmann, who lives on Corby Boulevard, said he also saw police cars stationed in the area. He said he first saw a police car from his window at about 10:40 p.m. When he went outside to walk to Ouh 23, located at 744 N. Notre Dame Ave., he said he saw several more squad cars. 
"I then walked out of my house at 11 p.m. and tried to walk down Corby, but the nearest police offi­cer told me to return to my home," Rossmann said. "A friend and I then walked to Ouh 23 a different way, but in our short trip there we saw at least 15 police cars in the neighborhood, stationed at every block." 
Rossmann said cars were sta­

SMC students spend 
Easter in Holy City 
By LIZ HARTER News Writer 
While many Saint Mary's students spent Easter at home with their families and pets, some of their 55 class­mates studying abroad in Rome instead joined the Pope in Vatican City. 
Saint Mary's has sent stu­dents to a satellite campus in the center of the Italian capi­tal since the Rome program's inception in 1970, said Peter Checca, the program's coun­selor. 
Sophomore Meghan Larsen seized the opportunity of being in the Eternal City dur­ing Holy Week to participate 
in events that commemorated Jesus' death and resurrection with Catholic pilgrims from every corner of the planet in St. Peter's Square. 
Larsen said she saw Pope Benedict XVI six times during the week as she attended Mass and participated in a seven-station Church Walk ­a pilgrimage around Rome. 
"[The walk] was between 15 and 20 miles," Larsen said. "We saw the four major basilicas of Rome and the three minor ones." 
Larsen also attended the Mass for the late John Paul II, which took place on April 
2. She and fellow Saint

Happy 21st, Buffalo boys 
No one will remember them for their so-called contributions to rock and roll or even music in general. 
The world won't stop when they dis­solve like all greatthingsdo. 
.---~----~ 
Their fans aren't rabid; their egos aren't insufferable. 
But, goodness, when they sing, they mean something so much more than so many others. 

Watching from the Ken Fowler back row as the ------------­Goo Goo Dolls cap­Managing tured an audience Editor of fifteen and fifty year-olds a month ago, it wasn't too hard to figure out what to like about them. 
Front man Johnny Rzeznik first made sure one friend got a little joy on a Saturday night, grabbing a fan's cell phone and singing two thirds of a song with the microphone on one side of his mouth and the mouthpiece on the other. 
He smiled and laughed. 

Later, he pulled out the NO Fight Song bottle opener the Bookstore sells. Someone staying at his hotel met him in the hallway and gave it to him. He pulled it out of his jacket and put the "Victory March" over the loudspeakers. After a smattering of boos. he responded polite­ly. 
Do you know how hard it was to be an Irish fan growing up in Buffalo as a Polish kid, where all the Irish kids would beat you up? 
His mom was a strict Catholic. 
Sometimes, it shows in his lyrics. 

"And you ask me what I want this year I 
And 1try to make this kind and clear I 
Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days I 
Cause I don't need boxes wrapped in strings/ And designer love and empty things I Just a chance that maybe we'll fmd 
better days" 

That's from "Better Days." It's a politi­cal song, sure -CNN even used it as a symbol its Katrina relief coverage. But more than politics, it's about morality. 
"Let's say I'm sorry and start over again. That was basically the message," Rzeznik said in an interview with EMI Publishing. "Something better is going to come." 
But in terms of rock, nothing better is going to come than a band with a con­science that maintains mainstream sup­port and can urge a little morality in the listener's life. 
For us, it's a question of whether or not we're paying attention. 
"And you know I see right through you I 
When the world gets in your way I 

What's the point in all this screaming I 
You're not listening anyway" 

Eleven years ago, Buffalo proclaimed April 13 to be Goo Goo Dolls day -10 years since their birth in "the toughest city in America." On your 21st, Goos, I'll drink to you. 
Let love in.

Rogue seal menaces man, beasts in California 
JENNER, Calif. -Nibbles the elephant seal is defying his tame nickname by killing smaller seals, menacing a kayaker and chomping on a surfer and a dog on the northern California coast. 
The 2,000-pound lone male is seen frequently at the Russian River outlet to the Pacific, and local marine recreational outlets are warning the public about the seal's aggression. 
On Easter Sunday, the seal grabbed an 80-pound pit bull and only let her go after he was attacked by the dog's owner. 
"I was throwing a stick in the water for the dog," Angel Garcia said. The dog "started to shake when this torpedo thing launched itself out of the water and grabbed her." 
On Tuesday, Nibbles growled at a kayaker, scaring him out of the water, said Suki Waters of Water Treks, a kayaking tour company. 
Man sentenced for printing lewd stickers 
MANTORVILLE, Minn. -A Byron man, who distributed sexually vulgar stickers fea­turing his ex-girlfriend's name, phone number and address, has been sentenced to four months in jail after pleading guilty to a felony harassment charge. 
Thomas Carl Tiedeman, 62, who appeared in Dodge County District Court on March 21, was also ordered to serve five years on proba­tion, perform 32 hours of community service and pay a $100 fine. 

The stickers included a photo of a woman, along with the phrase "call me now for the best," according to the criminal complaint. 
The Kasson Police Department received reports in September that someone was placing the stickers on vehicles and buildings. 
Tiedeman admitted to police that he had printed about 20 stickers and placed them on vehicles.

SMC to host baseball conference 
By·KATIE KOHLER Saint Mary's Editor 
Starting today and running through Saturday, Saint Mary's will host the fifth-annual International Women's Baseball Leadership Conference. 
The conference, coordinat­ed by the Saint Mary's College Club Baseball Program and titled "Getting Girls in the Game of Baseball," will attempt to increase female interest in the sport at the College.

improve softball skills. 
"After playing baseball, women come back as better softball players," he said. "The softball field just does­n't challenge them like it used to." 
A former major league baseball pitching coach, Bob Cluck, will deliver the keynote address. Cluck, a consultant for the San Diego Padres, will also otTer base­ball lessons from 9 to 11 
a.m. Saturday morning in the Angela Athletic Facility. 
Kovach wanted to hold the conference earlier in the semester, to avoid sharing 
and faculty advi­sor to the Club Baseball Program, said he hopes the conference will stress the importance of women's base­ball -which they may not know as women oftentimes replace the sport with soft­ball.

Cluck is also an author of many self­improvement baseball books, as well as "Baseball for Girls," a book focusing on 

you only play softball. It's something [female baseball players I just have to deal with," he said. "Sports shouldn't be regulated by gender because there are so many similarities between baseball and softball." 
Kovach, a former Saint Mary's softball coach, sees baseball as a way to breaking the stereotypes of women in baseball. 
Other speakers include the president of the Women's Baseball League (WBL) and conference founder, Justine Siegal and Terri Lakowski, the public policy coordinator for the Women's Sports Foundation. Siegal will focus on youth girl's baseball, and Lakowski will discuss the ways to cope with discrimi­nation against girls in base­ball. 
Participants are coming from Toronto, Detroit, Chicago, California and other regions of the country, Kovach said. This is only the second time the conference has taken place in the Midwest. 
Kovach. who has worked with Siegal in the past, said getting the conference to Saint Mary's was fairly easy. 
"Justine [Siegal] liked the idea of coming to a women's college and thought we could make it a diverse pro­gram," he said. 
Typically, the conferences are hosted in club league locations. 
The registration cost for the conference is $65 for adults and $30 for students. The ticket includes access to all sessions, lunch and the Cluck lessons Saturday. The Friday sessions and keynote lunch cost $50. Pre-registra­tion is required. 
Previous conferences have been held in Cleveland, Baltimore, Orlando and Toronto. The conference is financially sponsored by the Center for Women's Intercultural Leadership (CWIL). Additional sponsors include the First Source Bank, South Bend Blue Sox Women's Baseball and the United States Girl's Baseball Association.

continued from page 1 
Red Smith journalism lec­ture, titled "Are Journalists Obsolete?" 
Woodruff was not opti­mistic about the current state of journalism, noting that "every sector of jour­nalism" -especially news­papers -is losing readers or viewers as corporate scrutiny increases and executives downsize news organizations to ensure they are profitable. 
"The Tribune Company ­owners of the Chicago Tribune and L.A. Times ­may soon cease to exist as we know it," she said, "One of the great newspaper chains, Knight Ridder, van­ished last year when it was sold. It was profitable, but not profitable enough." 
Woodruff also said the major news networks need to increase the amount of resources they spend on their news coverage. There are only half as many for­eign correspondents with CBS, NBC and ABC now as there were 10 years ago, despite the increased inter­dependence of the planet's countries, she said. 
"With September 11 there were countless stories on why we don't understand the world, yet none of the major TV networks had a correspondent based in a majority Muslim country," she said. 
But Woodruff said she was encouraged about the future of American journal­ism through her participa­
tion in Generation Next, a documentary for which she interviewed 500 students in 29 cities. 
She found that young peo­ple were "far more up on national and international events" than their parents and professors may think and that the younger gener­ations are more likely to get their news from the Internet than other sources. 
Students were also more likely to engage in volun­teer work, she said. citing the 90 percent of the Notre Dame student body that is involved in service projects as "an example for young people across the country." 
Woodruff connected the students' commitment to community involvement to the future of journalism, saying high-quality report­ing goes hand-on-hand with the expectations of these readers. 
"A generation that is this civic-minded will be more receptive to good journal­ism. Satisfying those minds requires good content and good journalism," she said. 
Woodruff also predicted that as the younger genera­tions mature, there will be more demand for high-qual­ity content, as opposed news sources like the Drudge Report that often provide "false" stories. 
"Good content is not just content," she said. "It requires thought, imagina­tion and discussion and planning in the newsroom about what [journalists] should be covering."

IAEA chief: Iran in beginning stages 
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia-The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog said Wednesday Iran is oper­ating only several hlindred centrifuges at its ura­nium enrichment plant at Natanz, despite its claims to have activated 3,000. 
Mohamed E!Baradei said Iran's nuclear pro­gram was a concern, but he discounted Tehran's .claims of a major advance in uranium enrich­ment, a process the United Nations demands Iran suspend· or else be hit by increasing sanc­tions. 
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced Monday that the Natanz facility had begun "industrial-scale" production of nuclear fuel. Iran's top nuclear negotiator said workers had begun injecting uranium gas into a new array of 3,000 centrifuges, many more than the 328 centrifuges known to be operating at Natanz. 
Iran ultimately aims to operate more than 50,000 of the devices at the site. 
But E!Baradei, head of the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency, said "Iran is still just at the beginning stages in setting up its Natanz enrichment facility." 
Businessman addresses Israeli panel 
JEHUSALEM -A Syrian-American busi­nessman with ties to the Damascus govern­ment made an unprecedented appearance before an Israeli parliamentary panel Thursday, telling lawmakers that Syrian President Bashar Assad is ready to make peace with the Jewish state. 
The lawmakers reacted positively, pepper­ing him with questions about secret talks he held with a former senior Israeli diplomat. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's government, however, gave no indication it was ready to restart peace talks with Syria -broken off in 2000.

Research supports bird ancestry 
WASHINGTON-Hesearchers have decod­ed proteins from a 68 million-year-old Tyrannosaurus rex, the oldest such material ever found. The unprecedented step, once thought impossible, adds new weight to the idea that today's birds are descendants of the mighty dinosaurs. 
"The door just opens up to a whole avenue of research that involves anything extinct," said Matthew T. Carrano, curator of dinosaurs at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. 
Duke lacrosse players may sue DA 
HALEIGH, N.C. -The disgraced district attorney in the Duke lacrosse rape case apol­ogized to the three athletes in a carefully worded statement Thursday as their lawyers weighed whether to sue him -and some legal experts say they have a case. 
While prosecutors generally have immuni­ty for what they do inside the courtroom, experts said that protection probably doesn't cover some of Mike Nifong's more question­able actions in his handling of the case _ such as calling the lacrosse players "a bunch of hooligans" in one of several interviews deemed unethical by the state bar. 
"I think their chances of success suing Mr. Nifong are reasonably good, despite what we call prosecutorial immunity," said John Banzhaf, a professor at the George Washington University School of Law.

vows before the Pope the Lord's Supper Mass, known for the rite of washing feet on Holy Thursday and the Passion celebration inside St. Peter's Basilica on Good Friday. 
"We knew priests that were in the procession of the Chrismal Mass, so it was pretty neat to see the priests that we knew renew their vows with the Papa," Larsen said. "We had really good seats [for the Passion celebration] and could see the Pope very well." 
Larsen attended the Easter Vigil on Holy Saturday with Swygart, sophomore Lisa Ficker and three other Saint Mary's students. 
Before entering St. Peter's Basilica, crowds were lined up outside the gates of the square, Larsen said. 
"Once the gates open peo­pie just start sprinting to them," Larsen said. "When the gates open, though, it's every man for himself." 

Larsen said Ficker scaled the barricades to get insid!!, an older man present helped Swygart over the fence while Larsen was "sucked into the crowd" but eventually she also man­aged to enter the Basilica for the Mass. 
"We had an amazing view," Larsen said. "It was such a beautiful Mass most­

Sophomore Sarah Dapkus, who will be in Rome the entire academic year, chose to travel to Ireland during the break because she had seen the Pontiff on other occasions. 
''I've gone to a number of events with the Holy Father," Dapkus said. "It's so crowded that I opted to leave the hustle and bustle for Easter."

Panel 
continued from page 1 
moderated the panel, co-spon­sored by the Justice Education Program and the Political Science Department. 
Berdayes, a professor in the Communication and Performance Studies depart­ment, addressed the role of the media in the events leading upto the war, as well as their influ­ence throughout the armed con­flict. 
"Journalism now is not objec­tive. It is subjective from the very beginning," she said. "There is some bias always because journalists frame sto­ries from how much to cover, what to emphasize, what to make the foreground and what to make the background." 
Her focus was on the manipu­lative nature of present-day journalism and its effects on the American public. 
"Journalism is dangerous dur­ing wartime in matters of what stories are covered and how," she said. "Propaganda is often a prerequisite of war. Information is a weapon used on all sides." 
The most distressing journal­istic shortcoming, however, is not a ma.rked political orienta­tion but rather the failure to obtain all the correct informa­tion, she said. 
"Liberal or conservative bias is beside the point. What you see, read and hear may not be true," Berdayes said. · 
She also talked about a study that addressed the three major misconceptions of the war, as a result of disinformation, she said. The first untruth was the belief in the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. The second misconception, Berdayes said, had people thinking many other foreign countries supported America's war effort. And, finally, the notion that Saddam Hussein was directly linked to the September 11 attacks consti­tutes the third and most com­mon misunderstanding about the war in Iraq. 
These misconceptions alone illustrate the undeniable influ­ence -positive or negative ­of the media on the American people, Berdayes said. 
"The stakes are high, and we cannot be naive," she said. "We must be able to see the bias." 
Patrick Pierce, a political sci­ence professor, addressed the constitutionality of the war and the accountability of the sitting Bush administration. 
Initially, however, he revisited the common misconceptions of the American public, shaken by the "incredible percentages of citizens" that believe untrue and unsubstantiated rumors. 
lie also emphasized the importance of activism, on either end of the political spec­

. trum. Heflecting on the President's accountability, Pierce said that looking at the past will help dic­tate the future of the conflict. "In terms of administration, the last thing Bush wants to do is look backward, but backward is important because it pin­points accountability of our elected officials," he said. "Hegardless of what situation we face politically now, an important part of a democratic state is to hold oflicials account­able positively and negatively .... If the president is held account­able for negative actions, he loses power." The misuse of intelligence was another key point in Pierce's argument. "It is clear that what led up to the war was a manipulation of intelligence," he said. "Did [the Bush administration] lie? Disregard the truth? Make a good fake argument? Probably a mix of both." The implications and results of investigating the past for 
mental to further progress in both countries. 
"Our mere presence has made it very difficult for a stable democracy to be established no matter what," he said. "The whole situation was created by poor decision-making leading up to the war. There are no good choices for stability." 
The final speaker was Joseph Miller, a psychology professor, who spoke about the impact of the Iraqi conflict on Iran. 
"Presently, there is extensive evidence that Bush, Cheney and neoconservative advisors are trying to justify an attack in Iran," he said. 'They are using the same tactics as Iraq. This time, however, Congress, media and groups of all sorts are speaking out, demanding unnecessary and dangerous preparations with Iran be replaced with diplomacy." 
Miller addressed the impor­tance of avoiding the repetition of the Iraq War in Iran. 
"If we launch an attack in Iran, the tragedy will be even more intense," he said. 
Miller divided his presentation into four parts, starting with a discussion of the essential infor­mation that isn't being acknowl­edged. He went on to the essen­tial actions that are not occur­ring, the unfolding provocative actions that could spark a war and the options facing the United States. 
"There is no evidence Iran poses a nuclear threat in the near future, so there is no need to provoke war," he said. "Unproven information is as unreliable as the claims with Iraq." 
Miller also questioned Bush's willingness to explore diplomat­ic avenues with North Korea, but not with Iran. 
"The conflict with North Korea is much more advanced. Why can't we use diplomacy in Iran?" he said. "Many individu­als believe -myself included ­that the only way we can make

IN BRIEF 
Arkansas court remands case 
LITTLE ROCK -The Arkansas Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a state judge was wrong to dismiss Wal-Mart's lawsuit to break a retirement deal with a convicted former executive, saying the world's largest retailer is entitled to have a jury hear its claims. 
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., based in Bentonville, wants to void a multi-million-dollar retirement settlement it gave to Tom Coughlin, who later pleaded guilty to defrauding the company through the misuse of gift cards and expense reimbursements. 
Wal-Mart and Coughlin had signed a pact in which the two sides agreed not to sue the other for grievances that might come to light after Coughlin's departure. However, the com­pany said it discovered Coughlin's fraud after that pact was signed and believes Sam Walton's former right-hand man was obligated to reveal his deceit before retiring. 
Stocks advance despite oil prices 
NEW YORK-Stocks resumed their advance Thursday following a one-day hiatus as investors looked past higher oil prices and a somewhat cloudy picture for retail sales. The Dow Jones industrial average has shown gains in nine of the last 10 sessions. 
Retailers' reports on sales at stores open at least a year, an important measure known as same-stores sales, initi1;1,lly concerned some investors Thursday because of scattered warnings that sales would be light during April. Investors seemed to shake off those con­cerns as well as unease about inflation and oil prices as they awaited a deluge of earnings reports set to begin in earnest next week. 
"I think investors are trying to figure out what the next Fed move is. We're really at the point of chicken -where the Fed is trying to ward off inflation without submarining the economy," said Mark Coffelt, portfolio manag­er at Empiric Funds, referring to when the Federal Reserve might adjust short-term interest rates. Sentiment on the health of the economy has wobbled as investors have looked to each new piece of economic data for direction.

Nestle plans to purchase Gerber 
Company will become No. 1 in baby-food market ·after $5.5 billion aquisition 
Associated Press 

GENEVA -Nestle SA, the world's biggest food and drink company, said Thursday it will buy Gerber Products Co. from pharma­ceutical maker Novartis SA for $5.5 billion, giving it the largest share of the global baby food market. 
The acquisition helps fur­ther Nestle's reeent foeus on health and nutrition, follow­ing its purchases of the U.S. weight control company Jenny Craig and Novartis Medical Nutrition. · 
Nestle, which owns brands sueh as Nescafe, Perrier and Dreyer's, is also the world's largest manufacturer of infant nutritional products ­largely through its leading positions in developing coun­tries such as Brazil and China -but had no pres­ence in baby food in the United States. 
Gerber, whieh Nestle has coveted for more than a decade, dominates the U.S. baby-food market, with a 79 percent share, according to Morgan Stanley. 
"The acquisition of Gerber is the perfect complementary fit," said Nestle Chairman and CEO Peter Brabeck­Letmathe. "It not only gives Nestle the leadership posi­tion in baby food, but it also constitutes a decisive step to establish Nestle Nutrition as the undisputed global leader in the nutrition field." 
Adding Gerber will help the company's nutrition busi­ness generate annual sales of close to $8.2 billion. The company said it expects Gerber to generate sales of around $1.95 billion this year. 
Nestle shares fell 0.7 per­cent to 406.05 Swiss francs in Zurich, where Novartis shares were up at 67.35 francs ($55.27). 
Nestle first tried to acquire Gerber in 1994, but lost to Sandoz AG, which later businesses in recent years. merged with Ciba-Geigy to In December, Novartis sold form Novartis. Since then, its medical-nutrition division Novartis has taken steps to to Nestle for $2.5 billion. broaden Gerber's business Novartis is focusing on three beyond jarred foods. main areas: inventing new 

In 2000, Gerber began prescription medicines, vac­selling a line of powders, oils cines, and selling low-cost and other toiletries for chil­generic drugs and over-the­dren, and in 2002 it counter medicines. launched microwavable "This transaction is also meals for older toddlers.

But the baby-food busi­ness in a leading global ness has never been a good nutrition company," Novartis fit for a parent company that Chairman and CEO Daniel mainly sells medications. Vasella said in a statement. 
Novartis, based in Basel, Analysts said although the has shed several noncore price appeared high at first 
sight, it was in line with simi­lar deals. "Added to Nestle's existing baby food business in the 
U.S. and its overall North American business, this makes Nestle a very clear leader in infant nutrition in the U.S., where, unlike Western Europe, having babies remains in vogue," said Rob Mann, a Collins Stewart food analyst in London. 
The purchase is expected to be completed during the second half of this year, sub­ject to approval by regulato­ry authorities, Nestle said. 

Apple delays launch of 'Leopard' 
Associated Press 

SAN JOSE, Calif. -Apple Inc. said it won't be shipping its next-genera­tion operating system in June as planned, saying it had to divert resources from the project so that it could launch its highly anticipated iPhone on time. 
The new shipment date for Mac OS X "Leopard" will be in October, the company said Thursday. The iPhone will make its debut in June as planned. 
Apple shares dropped $1.7 5, or nearly 2 percent, to $90.44 in extended-session trading after the announcement. Earlier, they had closed at $92.19, down 40 cents, on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
The "iPhone contains the most sophisticated software ever shipped on a m_obile device, and finishing it on time has not come without a price -we had to borrow some key software engineering and (quality assurance) resources from our Mac OS X team," Apple said in a state­ment. 
Apple announced the iPhone -a smart phone that also serves as an iPod media player -in January to much fanfare. The Cupertino-based company said Thursday the iPhone is still on track to be shipped in late June and has passed several of the required certification tests. 
Apple, which had previously said Leopard would be available in the spring, had hoped to release the Mac operating system upgrade at its Worldwide Developers Conference, a five-day event in San Francisco that starts June 11. 
Instead, a "near-final version" of Leopard will be ready for the devel­opers at the conference to take home, Apple said. Though Leopard's features will be complete by then, Apple said the company won't be ready to ship what it considers a "quality release." 
"We think it'll be worth the wait," Apple said. "Life often presents trade-offs, and in this case we're sure we've made the right ones." 
Analysts agreed. 
"If it came down to one product or the other slipping, they made the right choice for iPhone to be on time -where consumer demand and anticipation is already running high," said Michael Gartenberg, an industry analyst at JupiterResearch. 
Apple plans to ship two versions of the iPhone -a 4-gigabyte model for $499 and an 8-gigabyte one for $599. It will be available in the U.S. exclusively through AT&T Inc.'s Cingular Wireless network. It will be sold in Europe later this year and in Asia next year.

Sheehan 
continued from page 1 
Casey, in Iraq, spoke to a packed Carroll Auditorium Thursday morning as dozens of South Bend residents con­vened at campus to hear the words of the anti-war activist. 
While students were the audience's minority, Sheehan said she did not fear a lack of youth activism calling for an end to the war. 
"People always ask me, 'Where are all the young peo­ple?"' she said. "It seems they are not involved like they were in Vietnam, but there is a big difference.... If young people started burning things people would take more notice, but young people are doing it in a peaceful, authen­tic way." 
Sheehan began her personal crusade in August 2005, when she protested at a peace camp outside President Bush's Crawford ranch during his five-week vacation there. 
Her continuous efforts to gain Bush's attention garnered her international media atten­tion at Camp Casey during her five-week stint camped out­side the ranch. She demanded an audience with the presi­dent and an explanation for her son's death. 
Sheehan said there is great value in nonviolent demon­strations -giving her a voice louder than angry critics like conservative columnist Ann Coulter, she said. 
"If you wrestle with pigs you only get dirty," Sheehan said. · "And the pigs like it. We must

keep ourselves clean. Peace is the most radical concept." 
The concept of peace within our own society, she said, is so rare that Sheehan only includ­ed it in the title of her organi­zation, Gold Star Families for Peace, after careful delibera­tion. 
Sheehan is one of nine founders of the organization, which provides support for families of fallen soldiers and seeks to end the U.S. occupa­tion of Iraq. 
While Sheehan said people often approach her in a state of shock about America's involvement in Iraq in this post-Vietnam era, she said she explains that after Vietnam those actively seeking peace thought their jobs were done. 
"I tell them, 'You put your signs in your garages and your peace badges in your jewelry box,"' she said. "Of course this can happen again. The war machine wants constant war ... In twenty, thirty or forty, your children will be involved in something like this." 
Sheehan made the decision to speak at the College as a "break" from her large venue speaking tour, College Democrat president Meaghan Herbst said. 
And while Sheehan could have spoken at a larger local venue, University spokesper­son Don Wycliff said no request to have Sheehan speak at Notre Dame came through his office. 
Although the expected atten­dance was only 200 people ­a relatively small crowd for the internationally known activist -Sheehan said she was enthused to be at a small

that nonviolence is constituent

port of this declaration, it Mprompted the audience to question the College's involve­ment in the Notre Dame-based Reserve Officers' Training

makers' scholarships -an idea that won the applause of Sheehan. 
Sheehan said a shortcoming of domestic anti-war activism is the individual protester's unwillingness to make sacri­fices. 
The first change she urged was the end of Saturday marches on Capitol Hill, jok­ingly saying that not even the person responsible for clear­ing dog waste from the side­walks is in the neighborhood on a Saturday. 
In turn, she extended an invitation to the 10,000 Mother March on Monday, May 14 -a date when she said she is confident the mani­festation will draw the atten­tion of lawmakers. 
Sheehan said the ultimate sacrifice, however, lies within the individual, as every citizen has the responsibility to con­tribute his talents to the improvement of society. 
"Look inside and figure out what more you can do," she said. "Don't worry about what you will eat, where you will sleep or your clothes. Step out in faith and that will be pro­vided for you." 
A mother of three other chil­dren, Sheehan said she would gladly stay in her California home to cook and clean for them, but after Casey's death and the loss of thousands of innocent Iraqis, she realized that was no longer an option. 
"If we want true and lasting peace," she said, "we all have to sacrifice.... We have to give something until it hurts."

McDaniels' presence justified 
It's generated strongly worded Letters to the Editor, prompted plenty of angry complaints and often required sig­nificant changes before publication. 
So why is Kaleidoscope McDaniels still in The Observer? It's a fair question, and the short answer is. usually, it's pretty funny. 
Concerns about Observer comic strips have surfaced fre­quently in recent years. Readers have questioned Kaleidoscope since it began in January, and before that Jocular was a frequent target of criticism -although other cartoons, from time to time, have drawn objec­
cause. 

These observations are not meant to undermine complaints. After all, a newspaper's role is to serve its community, and upset readers deserve explanations. What's important to remember, however, is that the purpose of a comic strip isn't to infuriate people -it's to make them laugh. Some may see those laughs as eoming at others' expense, but that's ascrib­ing a baser motive to the cartoon than what its author or the newspaper had in mind. 
Humor is subjective. That doesn't mean anything goes, 
however. When we think one of our cartoonists

What do men at Notre Dame think of the school's women? Do people u)fderstand the magnitude of problems caused by eating disorders? Why is there tension between tho Notre Dame and Saint Mary's campuses? 
These are serious subjects, and they aren't eausod by stereotypes or jokes found in a comic strip. Those jokes stem from pre-existing problems -and while it's easy to blame a cartoon for inflamiqg a situation, it's not addressing any root 
absencn. (That's not what happened with Kalnidoseope McDaniels this week, though -the cartoonist took three days off.) 
Eventually, it eomes. down to a value judgment. Maybe the cartoons stimulate productive discussion, and maybe they don't. But we aren't asking our cartoonists to lead that discus­sion. We're asking them to make people laugh. That's what Kaleidoscope McDaniels docs, and that's why we value it. 
Wn hope that readers will continue to tell us when they think we've stepped over the line. But we also hope the com­munity will takn these jokes for what they are, and what they're always intended to be-jokes.

The madness of the poets

trate of his hope to write well hereafter The Treasonous in laudable things," Clerk Milton asserted, "ought himself to be a true poem; that is, a composition and pattern of the best and most honorable things; not presuming to sing high prais­es of heroic men, or famous cities, unless he have in himself the experience and the practice of all that which is praiseworthy." To lay such a burden on scribblers of verses must seem madness to us, so far is it from the common assumptions of our society. This is not only because we live in a half-literate age where even the nominally well educated neither read poetry nor could identify it if they heard it. Rather, our time lacks poetry in another sense. Our "popular poetry" is in fact the endless spectacle of mass entertainment, and we demand of that entertainment not that it be "honor­able," not that it be a "pattern of the best" to which a human being might aspire. Instead, we insist that it recre­ate, in as apparently unmediated a form as possible, the basest and worst aspects of our experience: sometimes to justify it, and sometime merely to affirm its pathos, validating the misery in which we wallow. In the greatest works of art, however, we discover what the philosophers 
intend when they say all things possess truth, goodness, and beauty insofar as they exist. In the madness of Achilles, we encounter the very form of courage, seeing that the practicing of a virtue takes narrative shape, and that shape we discover as beautiful. In Achilles also we discover a certain blindness, a fail­ure to distinguish courage from pride. The thin veneer of Christianity that has been brushed over most of us helps us to see that Achilles' lack of mercy proves at times a deficiency, an imperfection in the form of his life that betrays his adherence to a false system of truth. 
In most societies and times this identi­fication of the beautiful with the true and the good holds in art and in life. Of ours this cannot so confidently be asserted. The vast majority of us con­sume mass entertainment and that alone. We devour the crude banalities of rock or hip-hop as quickly as possible, requiring the music to be simple yet intensely emotional so that it provides satisfactions closer to those found in brothels than in the sacraments of enduring love. 
The complications of orchestral music render it unintelligible to us, as if we can believe that the only excuse for assembling so many instruments must be that they are going to bleat one, loud explosive noise while some airplane blows up an asteroid at the end of this week's box-office smash. We justify this scorn of the sophisticated and saturation in the squalid by saying that the music of mass entertainment speaks to our experience. This is partially true. The sulfurous auditory secretions of Trent Reznor, I'm sure, originate in the bowels of a painful adolescence no less than

Some of us dabble in the decayed forms of the fine arts, justifying our practice on the authenticity of the suf­fering or sentimentality that inspired it, rather than on any actual achievement. We have no "mute inglorious" Miltons, but we have mobs of millions looking to express their all too legitimate sufferings in the sincere but incompetent lineated prose they call "poetry." They speak of the "healing" printing their pain brings about, but that is no excuse for bad art. As many of us have witnessed, one can have fantastic success as a playwright, no matter how ugly and vulgar the play, if one can convince enough college stu­dents that they are being "liberated" by acting or viewing it. This therapeutic justification serves not to better the world or the lives of its audience, but to assure those still maturing that they are just fine the way they are and to short circuit any serious critical thought. 
All art has some aboriginal contact with the foundational emotions of human experience. All great art engages dialectically with that experience, repre­senting it truly, calling forth its actual form. In that dialectic, great art also calls forth the potential forms of experi­ence, to show us how life should be and how we should live. We find in it what we already know as well as what we ought to desire, what we lament as well as what we ought to praise. 
In this respect, art frequently acts as a kind of goad, which suggests why human beings have always assigned an "edifying" element to art even as they fail time and again to explain it. 
Sometimes this "goading" can smack of pedagogical arrogance. How many school children of past generations came to loath Mozart or even poor Longfellow, because their knuckle-rapping school­master said they ought to love "The Requiem" or "The Song of Hiawatha"? The sublimity of a poem should not make one feel like a court jester staring ruefully up at his king; it rather threat­ens to absorb us in that sublimity. 
True poets and artists must indeed be mad, as in angered, to live in a time when the craft of making a beautiful thing is either ignored or patronized as therapeutic "self-expression." The more numerous charlatans who manufacture the monstrosities that pass for much of contemporary art, however, are prone to a peculiar madness. They march about the ruined colonnade of the fine arts, believing themselves to be its king mak­ing great works. What they in fact pro­duce-in film, print or music, on can­vas or in "installation art" -is a mirror, ugly yet rose-tinted to flatter our culture in the midst of its own deprivation. They are Miltons who helped murder a king and wrote lengthy tracks to "validate" the blood on their hands. They are not the Milton who wrote an epic about Christ, capable of praising the beauty of a life he might not succeed in imitating, but to which he might still aspire.

Much of the humor in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" comes from the mechanicals, a troupe of actors led by Bottom (Steve Soebbing, back row). 
CHRISTIAN SAGARDIA!The Observer 

Callie Hoffman (left) and Emily Sladek take the stage as fairy king and queen Oberon and Titania, respectively, in Opera Notre Dame's latest production. 
ByTAEANDREWS 
Scene Ediror 

When the curtain goes up on "A Midsummer Night's Dream" tonight in Washington Hall, it will mark a milestone for Opera Notre Dame -the culmination of its most ambitious project to date. 
Most college students have come to know and love William Shakespeare's play through high school English courses, but it's an entirely different show when presented in opera form. 
For a quick refresher course, the play's rather complicated plot revolves around two pairs of lovers -Hermia and Lysander, and Demetrius and Helena ­who end up in a forest after Hermia and Lysander elope. The play is very soap opera-esque, 
as Helena is in love with Demetrius, who loves not Helena but Hermia, who in turn loves Lysander. This complex "who-likes­who" dynam­ic becomes even more complicated when fairy king Oberon has his bench-fairy, Puck, inter­vene. Puck plays Cupid with a series of love potion applications, which scram­ble the preexisting romantic relation­ships and create a whole new series of interlocking love triangles. 
In addition to the lovers, a roving band of thespians arrives in the woods, Oberon feuds with his fairy wife Titania, and there's an impending marriage between Duke Theseus of Athens and Amazonian queen Hippolyta. 
Oh, and one man's head is turned into that of a donkey. 

As far as the opera goes, legendary British composer Benjamin Britten com­posed the music in late summer of 1959 for a performance at the Aldeburgh Festival, held less than a year later. Britten is considered to be perhaps England's most important composer ever, but any discussion of the music of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" must include mention of Peter Pears, Britten's lifelong friend and contemporary. In fact, Britten composed much of the opera with Pears' tenor voice in mind. Due to the time con­straints under which they wrote the opera, Pears was responsible for adapt­ing the text of Shakespeare's original play. 
As such, there's a considerable amount of change and revision in the operatic version of "A Midsummer Night's 
Dream," which makes its 
performance consider­ably more diflicult. 
"Whenever you're talk­ing about the opera, it's important to keep in mind that it's an adapta­tion," director Mark Beudert said in the midst of a busy rehearsal Wednesday night. "The location of the opera is changed to the woods. The woods music runs through the whole opera. [Also), Oberon's role is bigger and the lovers' roles are propotionately smaller. The mechanicals are about the same. Theseus and Hippolyta are reduced to almost nothing. 
"In Shakespeare's text, there's more words and therefore more nuances. However, for the opera, it can't be han­dled the same way. You have to search for the nuances in the music. In fact, we had to go back and look for clues in the play in order to find back-story for the lovers. 
"Here, you have a decision to make in order to create an opera that works well. You have to pick and choose. So it's an interesting process." 
In addition to the challenge of custom tailoring the opera, there's the music itself. Fortunately for Beudert, in Andrew Bisantz he has found a conductor up to the task. 
Bisantz earned a Master of Music degree in Orchestral Conducting at the Cleveland Institute of Music in 1997, making him the youngest person ever to achieve such a degree in the institute's history. Ten years later, he is the resident conductor of Florida Grand Opera in Miami. 
Of course, Beudert himself is an accomplished professional. A visiting professor of opera here at Notre Dame, Beudert is a tenor who completed his undergraduate studies at Columbia University, then received his doctoral degree in music from the University of Michigan. 
In terms of degree of difficulty, Beudert and company should be awarded a per­fect ten for taking on the challenge of pulling off "A Midsummer Night's Dream." As Beudert himself says, "This is music that challenges professionals." 
So why did he choose to put on "A Midsummer Night's Dream?" 
"This is a fiendishly difficult opera to present, and it's almost impossible for an all-undergraduate cast to perform -but we didn't accept that," Beudert said. "We have a very diverse cast, a very young cast. Frankly, we had so many talented people we had to do it. We have pushed everyone. It's been a learning experience for all of us. I don't know anyone else who's doing this. I think it's unique for us." 
But due to the difficulty of the perform­ance, Beudert did wind up making one concession -calling in some backup with professionals imported from the South Bend Symphony. 
"It's a perfect opera for this campus because it's a complete liberal arts expe­rience," Beudert said of the opera, speaking for himself, cast and crew. "It's been a tremendous experience, and we're looking forward to doing it in front of an audience."

CD REVIEW 
'Devils and Angels' is divinely uninspired 
DVD REVIEW 
'Dazed and Confused' gets high on teen spirit 
Photo courtesy of dvdbeaver.com Director Richard Linklater's classic 1993 film "Dazed and Confused" is an irrever­ant, character-driven return to his high school years in the mid 1970s. 
McConaughey and superb character actors like Adam Goldberg and Parker Posey all shine here -several of them in their very first screen appearances. 
In this way, "Dazed and Confused" becomes one of the most singularly charac­ter-driven movies in recent memory. Even Linklater, on the director's commentary to the new DVD, admits to the film's lack of an identifiable plot. Do we miss having a plot? Not really. But if you need one, here it is: A bunch of high schoolers cruise around a small town in Texas for kicks on the last day of school in May 1976. They have fun, get in trouble and get away with it. Some justice is served, but mostly they talk the night away. 
Linklater's motivation for making the movie was simple and two-fold: to capture the energy of being a teenage and playing loud music. Everything else is nonessen­tial. He hoped to capture "what it was like in that moment-to-moment reality, looking around for something to do, trying to be cool, and not much really going on," he admits on the commentary. "But I still wanted to capture the essential boredom of being a teen and trying to find something to d0." 
The fmished film plays out a lot like its simple premise, with teens amusing them­selves, realizing their boredom before mov­ing on to another pursuit. Its refreshing simplicity never gets old and instead ele­vates it to one of our great teen pictures. And as a testament to Linklater's story­telling skill, it never feels like a string of sight gags, which is what it could have easi­ly devolved into in the hands of a lesser filmmaker. 
As promised, the soundtrack is bumping. The characters tool around while Aerosmith, War, ZZ Top and Lynyrd Skynyrd carry the plot with ease.

With their newest release, "Devils and Angels," pop-rock band Melee have some­how managed to create one of the most generic albums ever put to digital disc. This album is what Rob Gordon once called "music I can ignore," and its polish seems so overdone that it has virtually eliminated any semblance of originality or talent. 
"Devils & Angels" opens with the espe­cially ignorable "Built to Last." Frontman Chris Cron 's style feels something like 

By RAMA GOTTUMUKKALA Senior Staff Writer 
In hindsight, high school really was one big haze. At least, that's the impression you get from "Dazed and Confused," writer­director Richard Linklater's cheerfully droll and hilarious revisit of his '70s teen years. 
Employing an ensemble cast with the tal­ent to match the prowess of his prose, Linklater drives the movie forward by parading his characters, one group after another, in front of us. He flexes his rare talent for developing a handful of charac­ters in a two-minute exchange, before whisking us away to another equally com­pelling group and introducing us to them. Big names like Ben Affleck and Matthew Coldplay, melded to a sad imitation Motion City Soundtrack and with a dash of The Shins -only, well, not as good. When Cron wants to croon, his vocals try to massage the tinny guitars in an attempt to sound epic. Unfortunately, it only sounds like over­produced babble. Cron should leave the singing to guys like Modest Mouse front­man Isaac Brock -someone who actually knows how to croon with his instruments -and return to the delusions of grandeur from whence he comes. 

This is not to say that every song on the album is horrible -some of them manage to be only quite bad. The third track, "Frequently Baby (She's a Teenage Maniac)." kicks the album into second gear, past the feeble "first gear" of the rest of the album. Sadly, for listeners, this is where the placid excitement ends. Trying to sound like British rockers Muse, they throw in piano for good measure. But where Muse is epic, Melee sings about a teenage mani­ac with her heart of the dance floor. If Melee wants to sound and look like British rockers, it should stop singing about high school girls. It's just plain creepy. 
The rest of album follows along like a pop music cookbook. Producer Howard Benson seems, like numbers before him, to have followed the path of least musical resistance, and "Devils and Angels" feels like an uninspired combination of pop ten­dencies and pseudo-hipster sensibilities as a result. It's as though Benson and Melee consulted the library of generic blues con­ventions, added a quarter of a cup of rhythm, mixed in a dash of monotonous guitar and covered it with a bland produc­tion glaze. 
myspace.com Californian pop-rockers Melee have recently released a new album, "Devils and Angels," which aims to imitate artists like Muse and Modest Mouse. 
"Drive Away," from the first half of the album, tries to be edgy with some crunchy guitars. Sadly, it's just too little too late ­and Melee hasn't hit the middle of the album. The rest of the "Devils and Angels" continues along the same well-trod path. 
The only decent song on the album is its bonus track, "You Make My Dreams." This song is actually catchy, with its fuzzy gui­tars that seem to have escaped the produc­ers' spit-n-shine routine. Cron sings with some real feeling, and the rest of the band provides decent background vocals. The best thing about this track is its honesty ­the band isn't trying to be epic or ground­breaking. They are, strangely enough, hav­ing fun with the song. It's too bad for Melee that this diamond in the rough is a bonus track, and that they couldn't take a cue from it for the rest of the album. 
All in all, Melee's "Devils and Angels" is a horrible piece of recorded music. It knows what it wants to be, which is more than many bands can say, and it is what it is ­very bad. Go check out Modest Mouse, Muse or even Coldplay before you go near this one.

Like Zach Braff with "Garden State," Linklater had the music in mind when fashioning the screenplay. "Music articulat­ed everything you couldn't really say," he admits. 
With the film already past its lOth birth­day, the Criterion Collection has bestowed Linklater's lovable little film with a two-disc special edition DVD that captures its semi­nal place among '90s independent cinema. Featuring a new clean-up video and audio transfer and a wonderful commentary from Linklater, the film looks and sounds better than it ever has before. 
But the meat and potatoes of the release are the copious extras. The DVD includes on-set and behind-the-scenes interviews with cast and crew, trailers, deleted scenes and footage from the 10-year anniversary reunion. The real treasure is the "Making 'Dazed"' documentary, a 45-minute piece that digs into why the film was so hard to make, and how Linklater and the crew managed to will it into existence. 
Playing out like one charming vignette  after another, "Dazed and Confused" is a rare and wonderful film that succeeds without ever concerning il'ielf with a plot. "Dazed" remains a landmark teen picture purely on the strength of its characters. They seem almost endless as they laugh, idle, bicker and torment one another for the better part of a day and night in '76.

Laxers prepare for home tilt versus Georgetown 
By MICHAEL BRYAN Sports Writer 
No. 12 Notre Dame will look for a crucial win Saturday, fac­ing off against Big East foe Georgetown. 
The Irish (10-3) will conclude their five-game home stand against the No. 11 Hoyas (7-5) at 1 p.m. Georgetown sits atop the Big East standings with a 3-0 record, and Notre Dame stands 

--tied for second at 2-1. Georgetown, ranked third in the preseason, has played an up and down season against an incredibly tough schedule. While the Hoyas have impressive wins against ranked conference oppo­nents Rutgers and Syracuse, the team has dropped five games, 
including three of its last four. 
All five of Georgetown's losses have come to opponents ranked in the top-12 nationally. 
For Notre Dame, the game against the conference leader is critical if the Irish want to remain in contention for the Big East regular season title. A win against the Hoyas would vault the Irish into first place, while a loss would effectively end any hopes of a regular season cham­pionship and the No. 1 seed in the inaugural Big East Tournament. 
Offensively, the Hoyas are led by senior Coco Stanwick, cur­rently second in the conference in points with 40 goals and 18 assists. Seniors Brittany Baschuk and Schuyler Sutton also have 22 and 20 goals, respectively. 
Irish coach Tracy Coyne said the team hopes to contain Stanwick, but doesn't expect to completely stop the Georgetown star. 
"You know Coco will get her goals," Coyne said. "But we feel confident we can handle and contain her defensively, and I have a lot of confidence in Kaki Orr against her in draw control." 
Georgetown's strength this season, however, has been in its defense. The Hoyas are giving up an average of only nine goals per game -best in the eonfer­ence. 
Notre Dame will look to con­tinue two recent trends that have led to wins -smothering defense and a balanced offen­sive attack. In the Irish wins this season, the team has given up an average of 7.3 goals per game, while giving up totals of 20, 16 and 18 in the three loss­es. 
While sophomore Jillian Byers and junior Caitlin McKinney have been Notre Dame's top scorers all season, the emer­gence of a complete offensive attack has been a key to Notre Dame winning five of their last six. Sophomore Jane Stoeckert and senior Meghan Murphy have each led the Irish in points in recent games, and seniors Orr and Lena Zentgraf have each made significant contributions as well. 
''I've been excited to see so many players stepping up," Coyne said. "Mary Carpenter had a career high in goals last game, and Meghan, Lena and Jane have been excellent -it's been great and huge to our suc­cess." 
The Georgetown game starts a tough schedule leading up to the Big East tournament for the Irish. Notre Dame will face No. 15 Vanderbilt on the road and conclude the regular season against No. 18 Rutgers. 
The Irish, however, look for­ward to these challenges. 
''I'm psyched to play three ranked teams, especially with the rivalries," Coyne said. "It gives us good mental prepara­tion without any easy games, and we want to end the season on a positive note."

By DAN MALOOF Sports Writer 
The No. 2 Irish will attempt to improve to 22-1 overall as 
they  take  on  No.  9  
Northwestern  today  in  
Evanston, Ill.  

The Irish, riding a 16-match winning streak, are coming off two impressive performances over the weekend in which they easily handled both No. 34 Indiana and No. 48 Ohio State by a score of 7-0. 
The Irish have been battling injuries all season, but Notre Dame coach Jay Louderback hopes to get junior Brook Buck back in the lineup at some point this weekend. 
"We'll know tomorrow," Louderback said. "We're going to try to get Brook in some doubles this weekend but we don't know when for sure. It all depends on how she's feel­ing." 
The Wildcats, who have won their last four matches and seven of their last eight, will look to carry the momentum into the match after they defeated Indiana 5-2 on Easter Sunday. 

Louderback understands that this will not be an easy match because, at No. 9, Northwestern brings a different a

good about the matchups. The key is going to be doubles because they have good doubles teams and their number one team just beat the No. 1-ranked William and Mary's number one doubles last week." 
The two teams are no strangers. They faced off in the semifinals of the ITA Indoor National Tournament in February. The Irish outlasted the Wildcats 4-3 in that match, but Louderback feels that his team has improved greatly since that match. 
"Our freshmen aren't fresh­men anymore because they've played a lot of matches," Louderback said. "I just think that we've gotten a lot of expe­rience playing against a lot of good teams, and I really think our doubles depth right now is very good because all the kids have played a lot." 
Due to 
Northwestern's 
a bit of doubles 

work this week because doubles is going to be very important, and our sin­gles are pretty sharp at this point because we've played a lot. I figured we needed to be ready to give ourselves the best shot of winning the dou­bles." 
After battling Northwestern today, the Irish will look to fin­ish their regular season on a high note as they take on DePaul and Marquette Saturday and Sunday, respec­tively.

Tea111 heads to tuneup 
for conference tourney 
By FRAN TOLAN Sports Writer 
For the second consecutive weekend, Notre Dame will have to contend with Mother Nature as well as the other teams in the tournament field. 
In their final event before the Big East Championships, the Irish will head to Columbus, Ohio, for the Kepler Intercollegiate at the Scarlet Course of the Ohio State Golf Club. 
"[The course] is going to play tough," Irish senior co-captain Cole Isban said. "It's difficult to begin with and the wind and snow we're expecting is just going to add to that." 
Last week, the Irish earded an eighth-place team score amid rain and strong winds at the Boilermaker Invitational in West Lafayette, Ind. 
In Columbus, Notre Dame will take on a number of regional foes, including the Buckeyes, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Wisconsin, Northwestern, Michigan and Michigan State. 
"We're just looking to get some district wins against some of those teams," Isban said. 
This tournament will also mark the first one of the season in which the Irish will have the opportunity to take on Louisville, a team Isban calls Notre Dame's most formidable Big East oppo­nent. 
"We get to take on Louisville so that should give us a good idea of where we stand," Isban said. 
Along with Isban, the Irish will send senior co-captain, junior Greg Rodgers, sophomore Josh Sandman, and freshman Doug Fortner to compete in the team's final tune-up before the confer­ence tournament. Freshman Mike King will also play in the Kepler Intercollegiate as an indi­vidual performer. 
"It's going to be an important weekend for us," Isban said. 
Practice rounds will be held today. Each team will play two 18-hole rounds Saturday and one on Sunday. Temperatures are expected to top out in the mid-40s with constant precipita­tion likely throughout the week­end.

Venus Williams cruised 
. into the quarterfinals of the Family Circle Cup on Thursday with a 6-2, 6-1 vic­tory over Chan Yung-Jan of China. The American, unseeded and in her fourth tournament since recovering from a wrist injury earlier in the year, reached 125 mph with her serve and needed just over an hour to win the match on a bright, breezy day on the green clay at Daniel Island. In Friday's quarterfinals, Williams, ranked No. 29, meets Anabel Medina Garrigues of Spain, who eliminated eighth-seeded Li Na of China, 6-4,7-5. 
Williams won in Memphis in her return, advanced to the third round in Miami and made the quarterfmals last week at Amelia Island. She · said she feels stronger with each match. 
"I've been off so long and I'm eager to play and I'm eager to get my ranking up and I want to play matches," she said. ''I'm excited about the snowball effect." 
Second-seeded Jelena Jankovic of Serbia, ranked No. 9 and the highest remaining seed at the $1.3 million Family Circle Cup, had an even easier time than Williams. 
She defeated Mara Santangelo of Italy 6-3, 6-0 in 47 minutes, losing only six points in the second set. It's Jankovic's fourth appearance in Charleston, but until this week she never survived the second round. Last year, Jankovic lost to a qualifier. 
''I'm now in the top 10 and I'm just a different player," she said. "I really don't have to prove anything to anybody, but all I want is just to enjoy my game, play my game." 
Jankovic meets Katrina Srebotnik of Slovenia, who beat Zheng Jie of China 7-5, 7-6 (5) in the quarterfinals. 
'Fourth-seeded Dinara Safina of Russia also won in straight sets, defeating Lourdes Dominguez Lino of Spain, 6-2, 6-2. She will face Tatiana Golovin of France, a 6-2, 4-6, 6-3 winner over 
AP 

Peng Shaui of China. 
Golovin captured the first tour victory of her career last week at Amelia Island and said success builds confi­dence. 
"It's one of the most impor­tant things," she said. "A lot of top players sometimes win matches they shouldn't win because they have confi­dence even if they aren't playing that well. And I think that's what I'm building up to." 
Michaella Krajicek of the Netherlands, who earlier this _ week defeated the tourna­ment's top-seed, Nicole Vaidisova, also advanced with a 6-7 (4), 6-2, 6-1 win over Sybille Bammer of Austria 
IN BRIEF 

Slight prow;ess in basketball 
players staying in school Two weeks ago, Kevin Durant showed up to collect one of sev­eral player-of-the-year awards wearing a burnt-orange tie, black shirt and black suit. Somehow, it made him look even younger, taller and skinnier than he did in a Texas Longhorns jer­sey. That is no small accomplish­ment. 
Durant had to lean down at the lectern to reach the microphone, and at the end of a short, gra­cious acceptance sp'eech, he flashed an uncertain smile at the front row. There, his parents and grandmother sat and beamed back. He still looked like an 18­year-old kid to everybody pres­ent, but he was about to become a $40 million man with a lot 
more  to  worry about than his  
grades.  It  was  a  bittersweet  
moment.  

Sorenstam's injury improves
Ochoa's ranking 
REUNION, Fla. -Lorena Ochoa would prefer a head-to-head vic­tory against Annika Sorenstam to become No. 1 in the women's world rankings. 
The 25-year-old Mexican star might have to settle for gaining the top spot a different way ­with Sorenstam injured and out of the mix. 
Ochoa shot a 6-under 66 in the opening round of the Ginn Open on Thursday, tying Laura Davies for the lead and moving a step closer to supplanting Sorenstam atop the rankings. 
"I would love for her to be play­ing, yes," Ochoa said. "So I guess right now it's the way it is. But I think I better keep playing good and just take advantage of that. 
But  I  wish  her  all  the  best.  
Hopefully  she  will  be  (back  
soon)."

One of America's two iconic cities will get the nod Saturday as the country's candidate to host the 2016 Olympics. Although winning this part of the selec­tion process will be something to cele­brate, it will only be the start of the hard work. 
The real race is in the quest to win over the International Olympic Committee and earn 60 votes in 2009, when the games are awarded. The field is expected to also include Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, Rome and Tokyo. 
Finding a way to win those 60 votes has been the crux of every speech, every presentation, every detailed list of instructions the U.S. Olympic Committee leaders have given the cities since the USOC commandeered and retooled the domestic selection process 21 months ago.

Team to compete in its largest event 
By DANIELL£ KELLER 
Sports Writer 

The Irish travel to Redwood Shores, Calif., to compete in the fifth-annual Windermere Real Estate Rowing Classic this weekend. 
The regatta is the team's largest competition this sea­son, featuring more than 100 races among the nation's top universities. Rowers will com­pete in two days of Henley style racing, in which all the races consist of just two boats. 
Notre Dame kicks off the weekend with a varsity-eight race against California on Saturday. The varsity-four boat will also race against California later in the morn­ing. 
On Saturday afternoon, Notre Dame's varsity-eight and second varsity-eight boats will race Stanford, Saturday's competition ends with the novice-eight boat racing UCLA. The second varsity­eight boat returns to action on Sunday morning in a race against UCLA. The varsity­eight and varsity-four boats will also race UCLA Sunday. 
UCLA's last competition was in the San Diego Crew Classic, in which the Bruins won the 
Laurel V. Korholz Perpetual 
·Trophy for the novice-eight race and placed in the top­four in three other races. Stanford and California also competed in the· San Diego Crew Classic. No. 9 Stanford placed third in the varsity­eight race and third in the novice-eight race. California placed second in the varsity eight race and the open eight race, third in the second varsi­ty-eight race, and fourth in the novice-eight race. 
Notre Dame is ranked No. 14 
in the Collegiate Coach's 
Rowing Association/US Rowing 
Poll. Last weekend's regatta in 
Indianapolis was cancelled 
due to inclement weather. In 
their previous competition, the 
Irish won the Lubbers Cup at 
a regatta in Grand Rapids, 
Mich. 
So far the team has enjoyed success, due in part to the novice-eight boat, which went undefeated for the earlier part of the season. After this week­end's regatta, the Irish will travel to New Jersey, where they will face No. 6 Princeton and George Washington, before in the Big East Championships.

Irish, Demons rained out 
By LORENZO REYES Sports Writer 
Notre Dame's doubleheader against No. 18/14 DePaul, which was originally sched­uled for Thursday, was post­poned until April 29 to be played in Cacciatore Stadium in Chicago. This marks the second time this season the two teams have had to cancel a doubleheader due to inclement weather. 
The Irish (19-13, 8-0 Big East) and Blue Demons remain the only undefeated teams in conference play, and their set of games could be crucial once the Big East championships start. 
The Irish, however, have to focus on a pair doubleheaders this weekend at conference rivals Providence and Connecticut. 
On Saturday, Notre Dame will face the Friars in Providence, R.I., at 12 p.m. Providence is currently ranked ninth in the Big East with a 3-7 conference record to go with a 14-14 overall mark. 
Against Providence, Notre Dame will face senior pitcher Sara Surosky, who is 7-8 with a 2.87 ERA and freshman Danielle Bertolette, who has a 3-3 mark with a 3.05 ERA. 
On the offensive 'side, senior catcher Rachel Bartholomew is the Friars' main threat with 
a .405 batting average and a team-leading seven home runs and 31 RBis. 
Notre Dame will then travel to Storrs, Conn., to face the Huskies, who currently occupy seventh place in the Big East with a 4-5 conference record. The Huskies are 15-15 overall. 

Huskies freshman pitcher Tricia Sullivan will take the mound with a 5-5 mark and 
3.82 
ERA. Also, the Irish expect to see senior hurler Krista Michalczyk, who has a 7-5 record to go along with a 

4.31 
ERA. 


Sophomore utility player Jillian Ortega is the main offensive threat for the Huskies, batting .358 with 23 RBis. Senior catcher Holly Calcagno can also do damage at the dish with her .342 aver­age and five home runs.

Squad heads into last regular season event 

--· 

Irish senior Ryan Keckley hits a backhand in Notre Dame's 5-2 victory over Illinois Apr. 1 at the Eck Tennis Center. 
By DEIRDRE KRASULA Sports Writer 
Notre Dame will look to add another win to its record as the team travels to Louisville for its fmal regular season matchup. 
The No. 6 Irish enter the match after sweeping Kentucky 7-0 in their final home match Wednesday. The win put Notre Dame at 9-0 on its home courts and 20-3 overall. After strug­gling in doubles play earlier this season, the Irish rallied to sweep doubles play for the second time in a row -the team also won the doubles point in its 7-0 win over Ball State Tuesday. 
The Irish had not changed their double pairs all season but did so against Ball State and kept the new lineup against Kentucky. They likely will stick with the same pairings against Louisville. Senior Stephen Bass and Ryan Keckley defeated Kentucky's Bruno Agostinelli and Kenny Hodge 8-5 at No. 1 doubles in just their second match together this season. The duo hadn't played alongside each other since Sept. 18, 2004. 
Notre Dame coach Bobby Bayliss said Bass and Keckley's recent success at No. 1 doubles has been a result of the pair's great chemistry. 
"We put our two best sets of hand at No. 1 doubles," Bayliss said. "Ryan's ability to poach off Stephen's serve has been help­ful." 
New pairings also include jun­ior Sheeva Parbhu and sopho­more Brett Helgeson at No. 2 doubles and senior Barry King and junior Andrew Roth at No. 3 doubles. All three doubles teams have won the past two matches in which they have been paired together, and Bayliss hopes they will see the same success in Louisville. 
"We've been successful with [doubles] the last two matches, and we hope that this will con­tinue to make us a more viable threat to win the doubles point," he said. 
Louisville enters Saturday's matchup with a record of 8-13 on the season. The Cardinals last faced No. 31 Virginia Commonwealth April 8. The team was defeated at doubles but rallied back in singles play. Louisville jumped ahead to a 2-1 lead as No. 60 Slavko Radman made quick work of No. 79 Petr Olsak defeating him in straight sets 6-2r 6-2. But VCU took four points at No: 3-6 singles and captured a 5-2 win. 
Even though Louisville fell to VCU, Bayliss said that Notre Dame is prepared for a challeng­ing match. 
Louisville defeated Notre Dame 4-1 in the 2006 Big East champi­onship fmal last April. En route to victory Radman defeated Bass 2-6. 6-4, 6-4 at the No. 1 spot. The lone Irish point came from Helgeson as he cruised past Johnson in a 6-7, 6-3, 6-2 deci­sion. The Irish had defeated Louisville 5-2 earlier that month during a regular season match. 
Bayliss said that the team hopes to avenge last year's showing in the Big East champi­onship as they travel to Louisville Saturday. The team will look to doubles to continue posting strong performances as well as Roth. The junior has been a key player for the Irish at No. 6 sin­gles. Roth's ability to secure wins for the Irish at the bottom of the lineup has been crucial to their success. 
"The growth in Andrew Roth's game has been important," Bayliss noted. "We started the year not really knowing what we were going to get from him. Now he's our spark plug, he plays with a lot of emotion." 
The Irish are prepared to be challenged by Louisville but will look for strong performances at doubles play to jumpstart the match. Bayliss said the memory of last year's match won't hurt either. 
"We are expecting a big chal­lenge and our guys remember the loss we had a year ago," Bayliss said. "That's been firmly imprinted on their brains the whole year, and they are anxious to make amends to that match a year ago."

Belles ~eady to take on streaking Tri-State team 
By REBECCA SLINGER Sports Writer 
Facing a team with a nine­game winning streak may seem daunting to some, but Saint Mary's said it was ready. 
The Belles (14-4, 1-3 MIAA) will face league rival Tri-State in a doubleheader Saturday in Angola, Ind., beginning at 1 p.m. 

Tri-State, currently third in the league, has a conference record of 2-0 and an overall record of 18-4. The doublehead­er with the Belles will be Tri­State's second in two days. The Thunder take on Olivet today in a series that was postponed from Thursday. 
After dropping three of its first MIAA contests, Saint Mary's sits at seventh in the MIAA. Sweeping Tri-State is important if the team wants to reach its goals of postseason play, Belles coach Erin Sullivan said. 
"We always want to win all of our conference games," Sullivan said. 'Tri-State is doing a great job this year but they are a team we can b.~at as long as we're prepared. 
The Thunder, who are 7-1 at home, have a potent mix of power hitting and pitching. Only three players arc hitting below .300. 
Their bullpen is deep, too ­their five pitchers feature a combined EHA of 2.57. 
But the Belles pitching is just as stingy. Talented sophomore pitchers Calli Davison and Kristin Amram have a 2.03 ERA between them. 
The Belles recently split a doubleheader against Calvin, which squeaked out a 4-3 win in the second game. Sullivan said her team needs to maintain focus in order to sweep one of the league's best teams. 
"I think we have to realize that once game one is over, game two is a completely sepa­rate game," Sullivan said. "We have to come out with the same intensity and the same motiva­tion to want to win."

Saint Mary's suffers first conference defeat 
By ELLYN MICHALAK Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's lost its 
unblemished conference 
record after a 5-4 loss to 
Hope today. 

Both teams now boast a 3-1 · MlAA conference record and 
are tied for third place behind 
Kalamazoo and Albion. 
The Belles only earned one 
win in doubles play 
The number one doubles 
duo of freshman Camille 
Gebert and senior captain 
Kelly McDavitt narrowly 
defeated sophomore 
Samantha Stille and freshman 
Lucy Himes 8-6. Gflbert's 
powerful serves, combined 
with McDavitt's flawless 
finesse, allowed them to come 
back after initially being 
down 4-3. 
The number two doubles 
team of seniors Tara O'Brien 
and Grace Gordon did not 
have as much luck. Though 
the duo dominated when in 
control of the serve, they had 
trouble returning their oppo­
nents' serves, which eventu­
ally led to an 8-2 loss to 
Flying Dutch freshman Ashley 
Austin and junior Christine 
Garcia. 
"I feel. like we played 
alright. We didn't play terri­
ble, but we certainly didn't 
play our best," O'Brien said. 
"We had trouble returning 
serves and ended up digging 
ourselves into a hole. We 
need to learn how to close 
matches. The score does not 
reflect our competition and 
ability." 
In the final doubles match 
of the afternoon, the fresh­
men team of Lisa Rubino and 
Erin Kaplan utilized their 
strong serves and quick feet 
to push the match into a 
tiebreaker. After a long bat­
tle, the duo was defeated 9-8 
by Hope College senior and 
three-time letterwinner 
Ashley .Leary and freshman 
Danielle Werley. 
After trailing in the doubles 
matches, the Belles hoped to 
dominate in singles play, but 
didn't quite achieve their 
goal. While McDavitt played 
in the number one singles 
spot and defeated Stille in two 
straight sets 7-5, 6-2, Gebert 
fell to Austin, also in straight 
sets, 6-4, 6-4. Lisa Rubino 
had better luck in the number 
three spot where she earned 
the victory against Leary in 
two sets 7-5, 6-3. While 
O'Brien battled through to the end of the match, she eventu­ally fell to Garcia after three sets, 6-4, 5-7. 6-4. In the fifth spot, junior Cassie Quaglia fell to Werley 6-2, 6-3. In the final singles match of the day, Gordon dominated freshman Marissa Kooyers and won the match in two sets, 6-3, 6-4. 

With an overall record of 7­10, the Belles will host Alma this Saturday. They will hope to add another win to their record and move into second place in the MIAA conference. In last year's match, Saint Mary's dominated Alma, shut­ting them out 9-0. 
The match will take place this Saturday at 1 p.m. at the Eck Tennis Pavillion.

valiant effort. The Forfeiters were without two of their orig­inal members and were only able to recruit one other play­er before the game ·started. With a 5-to-4 player ratio, the outlook was bad from the onset. 
Team Cougar did not exer­cise chivalry, trying to get the game over as soon as possible due to the miserable weather conditions. 
The game was marked by sloppy play from both teams, each having trouble dribbling the wet ball. However, it was Cougar that was able to take advantage of their opportuni­ties, scoring nearly all of their points in transition. 
When Cougar was not scor­ing on a fast break, they moved the ball around on offense, taking advantage of their extra player. 
"Playing 5-on-4 made it pretty easy to score, there was just always an open man," Cougars guard Jim Napier said. 
Forfeit did not go down with­out a fight, however, playing aggressively, but seemed to fall just short on every oppor­tunity. 
"They put up a great fight," Cougar forward Michael Urbaniak said. "They were really scrappy, especially with their defense. Toward the end they were difficult to score on." 
The Best of the Best of the Best 21, Los Bombones Asesinos 19 
In a game that lasted over an hour. these two powerhous­es battled it out on Bookstore Court Four. The game, rescheduled from Wednesday due to inclement weather, was marked by turnovers, half court heaves, long passes and a lot of over the backboard shots. 
Despite the win, Best of the Best captain Paul Laughlin was disappointed by his team's effort. 
"We probably had 30 turnovers ... and I got blocked by my own teammate. I think a blacked-out team could have beaten us," he said. 
Los Bombones Asesinos (The Chocolate Assassins) jumped out to an early lead, helped by their pump-up Spanish music that played throughout the match. They were quick to pull the trigger. And their first couple of shots hit nothing but net, but they soon cooled off. 
The Best were quick to respond, battling back with fast break opportunities and capitalizing on turnovers com­mitted by Los Bombopes. 
Both teams scored in bunch­es, as well, going long stretch­es of time without a basket. 

-
In the end, The Best were just too strong for Los Bombones, as Laughlin, the 
leading scorer for The Best, took over down low. 
"I think five really tall park­ing meters could have beaten both of our teams combined," The Best's Andy Gloss said. 
PT on the ET 21, Team 335 1 
In a game that was over shortly after the opening bas­ket, PT on the ET was able to make quick work 21-1 of Team 335. 
It was obvious at the outset of the game that PT on the ET was much more athletic and talented on the basketball court, and until Team 335 made an off-balance jump shot late in the second half, PT on the ET was poised to shut out its opponent. 

After a dominating first half. PT on the ET head coach Ryan Kelley was pleased, but critical of his team's performance. 
"We got an 11-0 start to start the first half of the game, so I really can't complain because that's the best you can do," Kelley said. ''I'm not lik­ing the defensive output, though, and we just need to step up and stay focused. I don't like the work ethic right now, but I think we should be able to pull this one out in the end." 
Much to the delight of the head coach, however, PT on the ET came out firing in the second half jumping out to a quick 17-0 advantage. · 
Team 335's lone bright spot in the game came when a fade-away jump shot somehow tickled the twine to eut the lead to 16 points. 
However, PT on the ET was not ready to relinquish any more of their lead and they turned up the heat to eventu­ally secure the 21-1 victory. 
With the brutal wind and temperatures in the 30s, PT on the ET was somehow able to overcome the adversity and put together a solid all around performance. 
"It's all about heart," birth­day boy and key contributor Graham Austin said. "We just wanted it more. It's also the off-season conditioning. We've been running sprints for four months now, and I grew like three inches in three weeks so we had a solid height advan­tage." 
PT on the ET hopes to carry their momentum into the third round next week. 
Engineering Giants 21, That's What She Said 8 
After a somewhat slow start, the Engineering Giants were able to overcome the weather as well as That's What She Said's aggressiveness to pre­vail 21-8. 
According to the Giants after the game, it was all about the basics as they were able to take control late in the first half. 
"We got rebounds," team captain Brian Seger said. "They played pretty tight at the beginning of the game, and the score really wasn't indica­tive of how close the game was." 
The Engineering Giants jumped ahead early and appeared ready to end the game, up 20-8, but couldn't finish it off for 20 minutes. 
In addition to not giving up at the end, That's What She Said opened the game strong and for the first few minutes of the first half out hustled and even overpowered the Engineering Giants. 
When the Engineering Giants took the lead at 5-4, the game was theirs for the rest of the way. 
The Engineering Giants were able to step up their play and eventually matched the inten­sity of their opponent, but it was the fundamentals that ultimately secured the victory. 
"Turnovers and rebounds were huge," Seger said. "We were able to commit a few less turnovers, and that was a big key to the victory." 
The Engineering Giants will look to continue their aggres­sive play as they will matchup with a formidable opponent in round three next week.

Frank credited part of the improvement in early recruiting to the hard work of new Irish defensive coordinator Corwin Brown. 
"Corwin Brown has done an outstanding job," Frank said. "He's kept in constant contact with Anthony, telling him 'you're my middle linebacker.' I can't remember anyone who works as hard as him at landing these guys." 
Posluszny is the younger brother of former Penn State standout Paul Posluszny. Frank said the two linebackers have very similar styles.

Record 
continued from page 24 
at Moose Krause Stadium, look­ing for a school-record 11th and 12th straight wins at home. 
After sputtering to a 3-3 mark to begin the season, Notre Dame has run off three consec­utive victories, outscoring oppo­nents 37-11 over that span. The winning streak has helped pro­pel the Irish up to No. 11 in the latest Nike/lnside Lacrosse media poll and USILA coaches' poll. 
The only problem is that just as the Irish were starting to build some momentum, their schedule intervened. Thanks to cancellations, Notre Dame's last game was April 3 -which means it will have had 10 days off before facing Air Force. 
Corrigan, however, feels that his team will be ready to go despite the break. 
"I wouldn't have volunteered the break for us when we got it," Corrigan said. "We were playing very well, and when you're playing well, you don't want to take a break. I'll tell you what, though, our practice intensity has been so good late­ly that I don't feel there will be any drop-oft'. Despite the break, we shmild be ready to play." 
Notre Dame will have to be ready to play this weekend because their games will have critical implications on the Great"Western Lacrosse League (GWLL) standings. Currently the Irish, Falcons, 1,1nd Pioneers all sit tied atop the standings at 1­0. 
Air Force is coming off a 16-9 victory over Bellarmine in its GWLL opener. Notre Dame is 9­0 all-time versus Air Force at home, but the Falcons won last year's contest in Colorado Springs 9-8. Overall, Air Force carries a 2-5 record into this weekend's game, but Corrigan expects the Falcons to pose a difficult challenge. 

"I can't believe they're 2-5," Corrigan said. "When you watch them at their best, you see a very good lacrosse team. Whenever you prepare to play somebody, you prepare to play them at their best, and their best is very good." 
After taking on Air Force, the Irish will return to action Sunday afternoon when they take on Denver. The Pioneers will carry a 6-5 overall record into this weekend's action, and they will play Bellarmine on­Friday before coming to South Bend on Sunday. 
Denver has defeated the Irish in each of the past two seasons, and the Pioneers are also com­ing off a GWLL title in 2006 when they went 5-0 en route to an NCAA tournament berth. Denver lost 16-8 in the first round to Maryland. 
Junior goalie Joey Kemp said the Irish "definitely" have extra motivation for the Denver game given last year's results. 
"You always want to beat a team coming off a loss to them last year," Kemp said. "With them winning the league last year and getting an automatic qualifier, they're obviously a good team. Getting our league's automatic qualifier is some­thing we're trying to accom­plish this year."

continued from page 24 
In its last conference series, Georgetown was swept by Seton Hall in a thrne-game set in South Orange, N.J. The Hoyas' last conference win was an 8-3 dedsion owr Cincinnati March 30. 
Meanwhile, Notre Dame dropped two of three to the Bearcats last weeknnd and was swept in a two-game series with Pittsburgh tho weekend · before. 
Schrage said both squads have had thn sanw problem ­defense. 
The Irish havn made 52 errors in 31 ganws this season, and unearned runs were the difference in both of their loss­es to Cincinnati. 
"The timflS we're making the errors are hurting us," Schrage said. "We're making errors that are causing unearned runs." 
Georgetown has been even worse. The Iloyas have made 78 errors this season. including 15 by shortstop Matthew Bouchard. 
Schrage changed his pitching lineup last weekend against the Bearcats, moving former closer Kyle Weiland into the confer­ence starting rotation in place of junior lel'thander Wade Korpi. Weiland is scheduled to start Sunday's match up. 
Weiland, who made 16 saves last season, has only appeared in six games this spring because Notre Dame hasn't had many save situations. Schrage said hn will be more valuable as a starter. 

"We felt like he was one of the best pitchers in the league, and he wasn't getting on the mound," he said. 
Korpi switched to making midweek starts and will be available out of the bullpen during conference series. His scheduled start this week, against Bowling Green, was cancelled due to inclement weather. 
Schrage said Weiland may still come in to close if neces­sary today and Saturday, and, in that ease, Korpi would start Sunday's game. 
"We'll have some depth this weekend," he said. "If we have to use Weiland [today and Saturday! we'll start Wade on Sunday." 
The forecast for this week­end is cold with scattered showers. Schrage said that makes pitching and defense even more important than usual. 
"You have to pitch and play defens·e on cold weather days, because it's hard to get a lot of hits," he said. 
The bad weather also increases the chance of rain­outs, which would be frustrat­ing for a team that has already had three this season. 
"The players get up to play," Schrage said. "Anytime you show up to the park and don't play, it's frustrating."

CELEBRITIES BORN ON THIS DAY: Riley Smith, 28; Claire Danes, 27; Nicholas Brendan, 35; David Letterman, 59 
Happy Birthday: Believe in your own abilities this year if you want to prosper. 
You show great potential but, if you take on too much, you may lose ground or 
head in the wrong direction. Your numbers are 6, 19, 24, 29, 35,44 
ARIES (March 21-April 19): Put your plan in motion but first correct any past mistake. Don't let a change of plans fluster you. 3 stars 
TAURUS (Apri120-May 20): Don't think that anything is too much to accomplish. Plod along steadily and refuse to look at the magnitude of the job. 3 stars 
GEMINI (May 21-June 20): Don't meddle in other people's affairs. Avoid confrontations and focus on what you can do. A little ingenuity will go a long way today. You can expect to upset someone who is jealous of your talent. 5 stars 
CANCER (June 21-July 22): Love is in the air. Don't let your stay-at-home attitude stop you from getting out and meeting new people. 2 stars 
LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Question what you are being told today. The truth is likely to be stretched and that may lead you in the wrong direction in a personal matter. Friends and relatives will help you keep things straight. 4 stars 
VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Don't let your emotions take over, especially in the workplace. Remain as confident and calm as possible if you want to be eligible for a raise or new position. 3 stars

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Drawing attention to someone else in order

FOOTBALL RECRUITING 

California linebacker gives verbal commit 
By CHRIS KHOREY Sports Editor 
Just days after Notre Dame received a verbal commitment from Pennsylvania prospect David Posluszny for the recruit­ing class of 2008, another line­backer has committed to the Irish. 
Anthony McDonald, 6-foot-3, 220-pound junior at Sherman Oaks-Notre Dame High School outside Los Angeles, gave his verbal to Notre Dame coach Charlie Weis Wednesday. 

Mike Frank, who covers Notre Dame recruiting for Irisheyes.com, said McDonald had been excited about the Irish from the very beginning of the recruiting process. 
"The first time we talked to him he was very excited about Notre Dame," Frank said. "Notre Dame was the school he was most interested in to begin with. As soon as the offer came, it did­n't take very long [for him to commit)." 
Frank said McDonald likes con­tact and should be an excellent run stutTer. 
"The thing that I like about this kid is that he's a very physical player," Frank said. "He loves to hit and he's got a real good feel for the position. He recognizes things very quickly." 
McDonald also possesses a linebackers instinct -a knack for being in the being in the right place that is hard to teach, Frank said. 
"He looks like a natural line­backer, not an athlete playing linebacker," Frank said. "He really understands what he's supposed to do." 
McDonald's father Mike played at USC, but despite showing interest in Anthony, the Trojans did not offer him a scholarship. 
"They only need one or two linebackers in their entire class," Frank said of USC. "He was a guy that they liked, and they were recruiting him, but they haven't offered too many guys at line­backer. That was the one thing holding Southern Cal back." 
Scout.com lists Boston College, Ole Miss, Nebraska, North Carolina State and Oregon as schools that gave an offer to McDonald.

Irish host 
last-place 
G'Town 
By CHRIS KHOREY Sports Editor 
Two teams desperate for con­ference wins will face off this weekend at Frank Eck Stadium. 
Notre Dame (15-16, 2-6 Big East) will host Georgetown (12­21, 2-7) tonight at 6, Saturday and Sunday in a three-game series that is crucial for each team's chances to climb back into the conference race. 
"I think it's going to be a very spirited weekend because both teams are fighting for their lives," Irish coach Dave Schrage said. 
The Hoyas are at the bottom of the Big East standings, with the Irish just a half game ahead of them.

--Hungarian sensation emerges for ND squad 
Freshman Molnar leads team into Mount SAC Relays in California 
By BILL BRINK Sports Writer 
Eight months ago, Balazs Molnar was a member of the Hungarian National track team, was coached by his father and had a knowledge of American teenage culture that came only from "American Pie." 
Now he's a full-fledged col­lege athlete who, going into this weekend's Mount SAC Relays in Walnut, Calif., has qualified for the NCAA Mideast regional competition and has a Big East Championship plaque placed proudly on his desk. 

The culture shock of coming to America and keeping up with the Notre Dame work­load is difficult enough. Add the commitments of a varsity sport, and life can get down­right crazy. But Molnar takes it all in stride. 
"It's kind of hard, but I'm getting used to it," Molnar says in clear but heavily accented English. "I really like the university in terms of aca­demics. And now I really like the track here." 
Excelling in track gave Balazs (pronounced Bollage) the exposure needed to give him a chance to study and run in America. At the European Under-23 Outdoor

MEN'S lACROSSE 
Team chases school record 
By GREG ARBOGAST 
Sports Writer 
When Notre Dame takes the field this weekend, it will have an opportunity to set the program record for con­secutive home victories. 
Just don't tell that to the Irish. 
"[Setting the record] is not something we've talked about at all," Notre Dame coach Kevin Corrigan said. "It's one of those interesting, but irrelevant facts. What's important for us is that we're starting to reach our potential as a team, and that's what we're focused on."
