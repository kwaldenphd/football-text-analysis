Deficits won't give a victory to Democrats in November 
Sky-high budget deficits will be the rallying cry for Democrats, if the party's platform committee listens to Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. On Monday, the senator from New York called the federal deficit "the social issue of this coming election." 
Social issue or not, the deficit will continue to he lam­basted by more and more Democratic candidates as November nears. But the latest servingofparty political rhetoric smells quite a bit like last month's fare: all fluff and no substance. 
Charles Manatt. chairman of the Democratic Party, gave an indication ofhow little substance the issue will receive with his statements at the Mock Convention last week. Explaining the perils on the horizon, Manatt compared government deficits to those in personal finance, as if the U.S. had a checking account and a dcht limit at the local bank. 
Such comparisons are ludicrous and on Iy serve to deceive voters. Even the connotation of the word "deficit" suggests imminent insolvency, bankruptcy, foreclosure or other fiscal

will try to make as much hay as they can from it," says Robert Schmuhl, professor of American studies. But Schmuhl is doubtful the deficit issue will work. "I'm not sure it will have much of an impact on the voters. The president and his supporters will say they arc not responsible for starting it, that it's really an outgrowth of policies that the Democrats created." 
Likewise. he believes Republican Party leaders arc not worried by the prospect of a deficit issue. "Supporters ofRonald Reagan -Senator Paul Laxalt is a 
prime example -say the deficit is so large and the im­plications of the deficit arc so complex that the deficit as an issue doesn't have much meaning." 
Recent history seems to be on Laxalr's side. General themes, such as "honesty" in 1976 and "less government" in 19HO, elected Presidents Carter and Reagan. Other

The deficit issue will not provide the Democrats with the substance they need to win the presidency. Their rhetoric, aside from being misleading, will not move the masses to the polling booths. Sen. Moynihan should drop the idl·a of putting budget dd1cits at the fore ofthe fight.

Challenger astronauts successful in mission

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -The shuttle astronauts prepared yester­day to come home with an empty cargo bay -a symbol of their twin successes in delivering one satellite to space and repairing another. 
Solar Max, the first satellite to un­dergo surgery in space, was speed­ing along at 17,400 mph in an orbit all its own, apparently fully recovered. Challenger released it at 
4:26 a.m. EST, then flew nearby for eight hours, ready to grab it back just in case. 
"As things look now, the repairs were successful," said Jim Elliott, a spokesman at Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, which is con­trollng the sun-study satellite and reading its data. 
Landing at Kennedy Space Center was set for 7:09 a.m. EST today, on the shuttle's I06th revolution of

orbit, at 8:47a.m., in case ofmorning 
ground fog. That possibility was a 
concern, but Maj. Donald Greene, an 
Air Force weather officer. said "It 
looks like it's going to be really 
nice." A shift in the wind canceled an 
earlier forecast of unacceptable 
clouds. 
Before they went to bed, the 
astronauts were given a report that 
summed up conditions in one 
phrase: "significant problems, 
none." 
"Satellite servicing is something 
that's here to stay," said Commander 
Robert L. Crippen, who will guide 
Challenger down to its second lan­
ding here. "We pick up, repair and 
deliver." 
The delivery part came Saturday, 
when Terry Hart guided the shuttle 
arm to a bus-size satellite in the 
cargo bay and put it overboard for 
retrieval in I 0 months by another 
crew. The 11-ton cylinder holds 57 
experiments that will be exposed to 
micrometeorites, cosmic rays and 
atomic oxygen in studi~ vital to 
building space stations. 
The first attempt at pickup was 
the flight's big disappointment. 
Space walker George Nelson was 
unable to attach a docking device to 
Solar Max to steady it for retrieval by 
the shuttle arm. Nelson's efforts 
started the satellite tumbling wildly, 
but the Goddard engineers were 
able to stabilize it. 
On Tuesday, Crippen guided 
Challenger close to Solar Max and 
Hart, with one stab of the arm, 
locked on and took it into the cargo ·bay. 
Repair day was Wednesday. Nel­
son and James van Hoften replaced · the system that accurately points the satellite's instruments at the sun. They also swapped an electronics unit. 
After more than three years ofcir­
cling the globe as a barely function­
ing satellite, Solar Max was then 
ready to provide valuable informa­
tion on giant solar flares that pour 
torrents of radiation into inter­
planetary space. What scientists 
learn from the satellite may help 
them better understand the sun and 
how it affects weather, radio com­
munications and other conditions 
on Earth. 
"We are confident we will have 
full use of six instruments on board 
and we're hopeful we'll have some 
science from the seventh instru­
ment," said Elliott. That instrument 
was not working when the fuses 
blew on the pointing unit in 1981.

Reagan speaks with autoworkers on the recovering U.S. econoiny

ABSOLUTELY UNBEATABLE 
Many of the several hundred workers gathered at the end of the assembly line to hear Reagan's speech wore blue and white "Mondale" baseball caps that had been handed out earlier at the plant gate by the United Auto Workers. 
Mondale's trip was strictly politi­cal -the Missouri Democratic caucuses are a week away ­whereas the president's trip to Claycomo and Dallas, where he is to visit a housing site today, was billed by the White House as an official visit and therefore paid for by tax­payers and not the Reagan re­election committee. 
But it would be difficult to distinguish Reagan's remarks to the autoworkcrs from those he delivers at political events such as campaign fund-raisers. The nwssage almost al­ways is: the economy is on the mend, and the Reagan program should get the credit for it. 
The Ford plant is not only an ex­ample of increased production and rehiring of laid-off workers that Reagan came to celebrate. It also is representative of an industry whose profits have shot upward in part be­cause it has used computerized robots and imported parts to per­manently trim its workforce in the past six years. 
William Barker, president of the Kansas City local of the llA W and an avowed Mondalc supporter, said about a third of the 2.000 persons who have gone back to work at Claycomo came from a dozen closed or partly idled Ford factories around the country. And the Kansas City plant still has at least 1500 workers on the street, he said. 


Lofts

I'm merely saying we're looking at 
the subject." 
Hoemer said he was unaware of 
any loft-rdatcd suits involving Notre 
Dame. 
Father Michael Hcppen, dircnor of Notre Dame student residences. said, 'Tm certainly willing to discuss (lofts) with Dean Roemer. I think our regulations arc rather strict. During the first week (of school), rooms arc inspected by the fire mar­shall." Heppcn has flnal authority in any decision concerning lofts. 
Roemer questioned the safety of 
lofts if a fire should occur. Since 
smoke rises, students in lofts could 
suffer more than those in regular 
beds. Roemer said. 
While the Notre Dame ad­
ministration considers tightening its 
loft policy, officials at Saint Mary's 
are contemplating allowing lofts in 
dorm rooms. Currently, there arc no 
lofts. One of the proposals being 
considered to have the administra­
tion allow students to build lofts on­
ly from kits brought through the 
adminstration. Thus, Saint Mary's 
can maintain a quality control over 
loft construction. 
Jason D. Lindower, Jr., controller 
and business manager at Saint 
Mary's, said, "We're looking for a 
model which satisfies our concerns 
for safety and student's concerns for 
convenience." 
Associated Press 

CLAYCOMO, Mo. -President Reagan told autoworkers at an as­sembly plant yesterday that the economy has recovered and people have gone back to work because "all of us ...have hung tough" and ignored those who said it couldn't be done. 
In remarks after having lunch in the hourly workers' cafeteria and touring the assembly line of a modernized Ford plant in Clay County outside Kansas City, the president said his effort to "rebuild America from the bottom up" hasn't been easy. 
"Times have been rough. and yes, the recession was much deeper and longer than almost anyone predicted," Reagan said. "But these problems had been building up for 20 years, and we were determined to find a real economic cure, not just resort -as they had so often in the past -to another political quick fix." 
And in a jab at his political op­ponents who accuse him ofa lack of compassion. he said, "There's no compassion in snake oil cures. 
"All of us, working together and ignoring the gloomcriers and pun­dits who said it couldn't be done, have hung tough," Reagan added. "Today, as we see the auto industry and the economy humming with ac­tivity, aren't we glad we did?" 
While Reagan visited the Claycomo plant, which the White House had selected as a model of resurgence in the auto industry, the leading Democratic contender for his job, Walter F. Mondalc, toured a Chrysler plant across the state in Fenton. Reagan stopped at that plant a year ago to vie\v the evidence of a recovery that was just then getting under way.

A questionable commencement speaker choice 
Peace Corps Director Loret Ruppe, Father Hes­hurgh's choice as the 1984 commencement speaker, has brought with her a storm of controversy to the federal agency. 
According to The Washington Times, Ruppe: has liberalized the Peace Corps abortion policy while still claiming to be "strongly pro-life." ller spokesmen, however, continue to defend the agency's policy of providing transportation expt·nses for its volunteers st-cking abortions. Since: 1981, the Peace Corps has provided such aid to more than 200 volunteers and has cost taxpayers more: than $300,000. This not only makes her statements hypocritical hut is contrary to the policies ofthe administration that appointed her. 
Though The Washington Times is one of the more conservative newspapers serving the Capitol, it is not alone in criticizing Ruppe. The Washinton Post has rt·ported that she tape-recorded private conversations with her deputy, Edward Curran. Although the incident was reviewed by White: House counsel Fred Fielding and found to he in violation ofagency regulations, it was labeled a personnel dispute and swept under the table by the Reagan administration. 
Many believe Ruppe's problems as Peace Corps director stem from her lack of previous experience in public office. The: wife of Michigan Congressman Philip Ruppe:, Loret Ruppe's limited political experience in­dudes serving as Michigan chairwoman of George Bush's presidential campaign in 1980 and co­chairwoman of the Reagan-Bush presidential campaign after Bush's campaign fizzled. Before this her ex­periences as a Michigan housewife offered her very few administrative opportunities. 
Ruppe is a moderate Republican within a con­servative administration, which indicates that her ap­pointment was merely a reward for her work in the 1980 campaign and not the result ofher party loyalty or her qualifications for the job. 
It is difficult to imagine that Hesburgh was not aware of the controversy surrounding Ruppe in Washington. Being the commencement speaker at Notre Dame may be too great an honor for a person with, at best, ques­tionable administrative abilities and who personifies the patronage politics of the Reagan adminstration, which sacrifice knowledge and experience for cor­diality. 
The graduating seniors should feel cheated by Hes­burgh's choice. Because rumors around campus were predicting many respectable speakers -ranging from Chrysler Chairman of the Board Lee Iaccoca to Pope john Paul II -a controversial Washington politico is a disappointment. In recent years this honor has been be­stowed upon far more worthy recipients, such as Chicago Archbishop joseph Bernadin of Chicago, Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and President Reagan. 
When a poor politician and a worse administrator like Loret Ruppe is chosen as commencement speaker, we must question exactly how much Hesburgh is preserv­ing our integrity as an outstanding Catholic university.

I had the afternoon free last Wednesday, so at the invitation ofa friend I went to a fastpitch softball game between Notre Dame and St. joseph's College. The stands were empty, but it really did not seem to matter to these girls. They were nor recruited for their throwing arms or their hatting averages. Rather, they were hroughr to N'I?· bcl·ausc of their SAT scores and their contributions to their com­munitks. 
The "rcaJ student athlete'' is a slightly dif­fcn·nt breed from our inccrcollcgiatc superstars. The person who plays at the club or intramural level docs so solely for the love of the game, the thrill ofcompetition, and the desire to he physically fit. No one knows their names yet they continue to play with vigor. There an: no pro contrars or TV interviews waiting for them when they come offthe field. 
I am nor saying that participants in major colkgc sports are nor athletes. They demonstrate great skills in their events, but what I am looking at are the motives behind their participation in athletics. This society is in a great quest for modern day heroes and it deeply admires athletic skill in certain events. Unfortunately, parr ofthe purity and fun is lost when money, glory, and in the case of the Olympic games, international propaganda 

come into the forefront ofthe competition. 
I worry when we speak of our academic credibility with respect ro major college sports. I wonder how many of our athletes would have been accepted to Notre IXJ.me if they were confined to wheelchairs. I also wonder how many athletes across the nation would have gone to different colleges, or maybe no college at all, if they had not been offered scholarships. 
My critics will charge that the football and basketball programs make enough money to support minor sports, and that they attract a great many potential donors to Notre Dame. I do not deny this, in fact I think it proves fur· ther that major sports are little more than a

Mondale's assets

In response to tht· April ') letter from Yin· l'cnl DeSantis regarding Walter Mondalc's ex· pl·rkncc, I would like 10 make several points. 
First, I ncvl'f said "Experience is his( Waltl'f Mondak's) higgest asst'l." The April 2 Ob· sert'er article in whkh I am quoted features the hcadlinl·, "Mondalc's ExpcricnlT Biggest Asset." This hcaulinc: was chosl·n by The Ob­

Secondly, Professor DeSantis accuses llll' of assuming that. "There is a nl-ccssary corrcla· tion ht·twn·n political cxpt·rkncc in the na· tiona! arena and presidential success." On the contrary. I do not believe that experience is essl·nrial li1r Mll'l'CSs, hut I do contend that past politkal cxpniencc is one of many legitimate and important criteria in the selcc· tion ofa presidl·ntial nominee. 
During the M<ll'k Convention campaign, Walter Monllalc's experience his record and 
past accomplishments as a U.S. senator and as vice-president were touted by my committee as one way 10 illuminate the differences be­tween Mondale and his Democratic conten­ders. In the interview, the only rime I was quoted using the word "experience" was after hl'ing asked how 1 planned to differentiate Mondale from Hart. 
While tht· Mondale campaign often cited cxperil'ncc as a tTiterion in the sdcction of a candidate, a potential nominee cannot and should nor he judged on this basis alone. 
Character, issue positions and a vision for the future art· all vital in evaluating a can· didalt'. Based on these criteria and others, it remains my belief that Walter Mondale is the hcst candidate for the Democratic presiden­tial nomination.

include a policy concerning space develop­ment. In the interest ofstudent awareness, we propose the following policies as a focus for discussion. 
Space research has produced many con­crete benefits. The pictures relayed by Voyager have revolutionized the planetary sciences. NASA's research programs have also fostered many of the current "high tech" in­dustries. Solar energy research received a tremendous boost from NASA's research on photovoltic cells. NASA's research on the min­iaturization of computer circuits revolutionized the computer industry. Space exploration was the prime motivating factor behind this research. To maintain this pace of development the U.S. should revive the Galileo and Haley's comer missions and con­
struct a permanent, manned space station for use as a platform for interplanetary explora­tion. 
lndJstries involved in space exploitation incur great expenses. The U.S. Government should institute tax incentives for industries researching semiconductors, pharmaceuti· cals, composite materials and all other space· related industrial research and development. The government should support consortiums

business -even here, beneath the shadow of 
the Golden Dome. 
I am nor suggesting that we demolish the stadium or turn the ACC into a permanent truck and RV show (C."Ven though it might become Hoosier Heaven). Sports on the major college level serve the purposes of raising money and generating campus unity. 
What 1am doing is cririzing the fact that, in many instances, athletics has lost its simplicity. But, purity ofsport still exists at the cluh and intramural levels, or anywhere for that matter where people participate in ath­letics simply for the joy ofit, not for some type of materialistic gain. 
It is impossible to equate athletics with dol· Iars and cents without bastardizing its true nature. For true athletes everywhere and for those softball playing girls who don't even have a field ro play on at Notre Dame: You demonstrate what sport truly is everytime you take the field. It is refreshing ro see and I salute you. 
for the development of projects roo ex­pensive for single companies to pursue. NASA would then be able to utilize its unique talents to advise these research consortiums. 
The United States can also solve its energy shortage by exploiting the vast energy reserves in outer space. The U.S. should sup­port utilities in the construction of the SPS, a va-;r array of solar panels in earth orbit. This system can rake full advantage ofsolar energy (which is four times as intensive in space), and then beam this energy to earth via a microwave generator or high-powered la<;cr. 
Space also has a vast amount of material resources. U.S. should construct a permanent lunar base to exploit the moon's metals through an extensive mining program. These metals could then be transported to earth or space-based industries. 
Space offers many unique opportunities for the enhancement of our national security. Such opportunities include a space-based ABM system. The ll.S. should support Colonel Daniel Graham's High Frontier in all its aspects, and begin construction ofsuch a sys­tem immediately.

Foodsales pizza was in the headlines in December, when tht. University dosed down the in-dorm, student-run operations because ofsanitation violations. Many ofthe violations were related to the pizza ovens used in most dorms. The violations were quickly corrected and !i)()dsales reopened, subject to stricter health standards. 
The OhsenJer Showcase department decided to tlnd out exactly how good campus pizza rt.·ally is since foodsales were forced to clean up thdr act. Six eager pizza critics set out in search of the perfect pizza. The s!lllft:d participants in this feat were Keith Pkher, Margaret Fosmoc, Tom Mowle, Mary llealy, Mark Worscht.·h and Sarah Hamilton. 
Each pizza was judged on a S-point scale in each of the tiJIIowing categories: crust, sauce, topping and cheese. The results are listed hc:low. 
Due to financial constraints, only one trip to each hall was possible. Therefore, any given foodsaks may produce a betteror worse pizza on any given night. Comments about service, atmosphere or the size ofthe foodsales opera­tion may he included, but these factors did not affect the pizza rating. 
The prices listed arc for plain cheese pizza. There is a varying charge in each dorm for ad­ditional toppings. 
You don't have to accept our judgement. But if you choose to go blindly in search ofthe ultimate campus pizza and wind up with a dud instead, don't say we didn't warn you. 
Bon apetit! 

Stanford 


This could he considered the bourgeois of campus pizzas. A Stanford pizza is definitely palatable, yet certainly n<1thing to arrange a road-trip for. The sausage is sapid and generously sprinkled. The t.·hccsc is slightly better than other pizzas ofsimilar quality; the sauce is average. The crust is the low-point of this pizza -it was overcookt.-d and tasteless. Fair is the most honest way ofdescribing this pizza. The food sales are spacious and there is adequate sodal space is nearby. Be prcpan:d to wait a while for your order. Hours: Sun.­Thurs. 9:30-12, Fri.-Sat. 10:30 to 1 a.m. Price: large, $3.25; medium, $2.50; small, $1.80; slice, $.40. 
This pre-packaged stuff-and the self-serve ·microwave -belongs in a 7-1 I, not a dorm. 
The sparse sprinkles ofcheese, the four pieces 
ofpepperoni (five ifyou're lucky), the spongy 
crust and the lack ofsauce: combine to make a 
pizza that would embarrass even a third­generation Italian. But pre-packaged food doesn't mean cleanliness -tht.· adjoining TV room looked like a rodent feeding ground, popcorn and chips littering the carpeted tloor. Hours: 10-12 every day. Price: small

Sorin 


Sorin Hall pizza is among the best on campus. In fact, it is hard to believe that it is a hall pizza. Their thick-crust pizza is covered with a much tastier sausage than the average dorm pizza. The rather sweet saLK't.' and better than average cheese art.· worthy ofa legitimate pizzaria. The one thing which marks Sorin as a dorm foodsales is the total lack ofdining ar­rangements. Sun.-Thurs. 10:30-12. Price: 




Rating the campu~
.. 
Lewis 

Lewis I:!all pizza transcends the rating scale. The kitchen is very undcan, so it is clear how the pizza gets its taste. On the way up in the elevator to the lounge (there is no place to eat ncar the foodsales ), we thought the carpet smelled as if someone had very recently been 
ill. It was with heavy stomachs that we realized the odor came from the pizza. The crust is not cooked well, the cheese is blotchy and the toppings appear moldy. The sauce seems all right, hut considering everything else, it is hard to he sure. In short, it's no won­der the University dosed down the foodsales on campus, if they tasted a Lewis pizza. Hours: Mon.-Sun. 9:30-12. Price: large, $3; medium, $2; small, $1. 

HolyCross 

What Holy Cross pizza lacks in quality is made up for in the dining arrangements, which includes booths and barstools. The sausage topping, unlike most, has a taste that stands out from the cheese and sauce, both of which are plentiful and tasty. The ovens are located in a back kitchen, which makes for a pleasant dining atmosphere. Hours: Sun.­Thurs. 9-12, Fri.-Sat. 11-1. Price: whole, $4.25; half, $2.25. 


Keenan" 
Keenan's new highly-touted "deep-dish" pizza, although a fair deal, is nothing to write home about. The ready-made crust does rise to heights that are virtually unknown on the rest ofcampus, hut it might rise even higher if it were cooked as long as it should be. The crust is left white and doughy. The pizza, like many on campus, suffers from a shortage of sauce. The sausage, on the other hand, is a little too prominent. In fact, diners may note that because ofthe excess ofcrumbly sausage, the pizza closely resembles a coffee cake. Keenan's regular pizza, cooked for the same amount of time, might be a better option. Hours: Sun.-Thurs. 9:30-12:30, Fri.-Sat. 
10:30 to 12:30. Price: large, $3.90; medium, $2.40; small, $1.75.

Dillon 

Voila! A Dorm foodsales docs know how to make pizza after all! Big Red would make Luigi proud. Dillon is one of the few foodsales that spreads enough sauce on its pizza. Best ofall, this pie ha'i flavor. The crust is tasty and baked just right. A bit more sausage wouldn't hurt, nor would a little more time in the oven, but these are not complaints, just suggestions for perfection. Acarpett:d side room with video games, two tables covered with checkered tablecloths, music, and a varied menu make this foodsales the culinary showplace ofSouth Quad. Hours: 9-12 every day. Price: large, $3.60; small, $2.50. 

Walsh 

Head for the vending machines! The "pizza muffins" designed to fill the pizza void in Walsh Hall tend to have the opposite effect. A Walsh pizza muffin consists ofa soggy English muffin spread with a little soupy tomato sauce under hacked pieces offoul-tasting cheese. No toppings are available. And to round off their eating experience, victims get to cook 
the things themselves-in a slow-heatingan­tiquated toaster oven. Ifthe muffins aren't enough to drive you away, the dismal uninvit­ing atmosphere ofthe foodsales area certainly will. Note: Bring your own napkins and plenty ofchange; they have neither. Hours: Sun.­Thurs. 10 to 12. Price: pizza muffin, $.50. 

Badin 


Badin Hall does not (and cannot) try to compete with other dorm pizzas. Frozen and pre-packaged, a few minutes ofmicrowaving by the salesperson turns the pizza into a scald­ing, sloppy mess. No toppings available. Its thin crust, patchy cheese and nondescript sauce make a Badin pizza definitely not worth leaving your dorm for -that is, unless you live in Badin. Hours: Sun.-Thurs. 9-11:30, Fri. 11:30-1. Price $1.

Here's vending machine pizza at its worst. 


Leprechaun 
Oh, ifwe could only get pizza like this in the dining halls. NO Food Services' creation puts much of the other campus fare to shame, but then again, it should, considering the extra cost -almost 52 more than Flanner. Well­browned cheese floating on a sea of tangy tomato sauce gives this 'za oursecond-highest rating. Drawbacks are the wafer-like crust and the sparse toppings. Leprechan pizza is sold both at the Oak Room Cafeteria and The Huddle. True pizza fans will opt for the Oak Room, since it's the closest thing to a real res­taurant on campus. The table candles, table cloths and serene setting make for finer dining than your usual basement establishment. If this place had a beer license, it would be a campus smash. Oh, well. Hours: (Oak Room, 239-7518) Sun.-Thurs., 9 p.m. to midnight; Fri.-Sat., 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. (The Huddle, 239-7157) Seven days, 4 p.m. to

Pangborn 


This pizza is definitely worth going a little offthe beaten path for. It is bound to tempt the palate of many campus pizza-seekers. The sauce is fair, but a little sparce. The crust rates about average with other campus pizzas. The tasty cheese and flavorful topping, however, are both first-rate. Together they form a late­night dining experience that is a little better than the average dorm food sales can offer. An

The cheese, rather bland, rates slightly lower than the other com­ponents of this pizza. The large, carpeted, nicely-lit eating area, complete with booths, juke box and wide-screen TV, makes Grace perhaps the most pleasant dining experience to be found on campus. Hours: Sun.-Thurs. 7:30-12, Fri. and Sat. 8-1. Price: small, $1.85; large, $2.70. 

Cavanaugh 


Ifonly the Naugh's pizza were asgood as its crust. Cavanaugh seems to have raised baking pizza crust to an art. The edges are crunchy; the center is tender without being flimsy or bread-like. This pizza is no more generous"' with its sauce or spices than most hall foodsales. The cheese was obviously cooked and not merely melted (a plus), but still it lacked that appetizing golden tone. The sausage was crumbled too small, but liberally distributed on the pie. Parked in a comer in the basement of the dorm, Cavanaugh foodsales does not exactly entice people with its aesthetic atmosphere, but pizza can be or­dered ahead by calling 283-4729.

Pasquerilla East pizza-bagels are not even recommended by the hall's own food sales­man -he suggests going to Grace ifyou want pizza. The pizza-bagels are okay for what they are, but not as pizza.

Alumni 


Alumni's foodsales pizza should qualify as the eighth wonder ofthe world, since it's a wonder that anyone can eat it. The crust on this pizza is magnificent. The chefs have ac­hieved the perfect crispness at the edges and tenderness at the center, Obviously, the crust is Alumni foodsales' piece de resistence. The rest ofthe pizza is a lot easier to resist, probab­ly because it is so difficult to eat. There is a lot ofcheese on each pizza, but for some un­known reason it tends to run to the center. (Strange cheese indeed!) Nor is the cheese cooked long enough. This, added to the fact that there is not much sauce and only an average amount ofsausage, explains why it is so difficult to eat Alumni's pizza. Hours: Sun. 8-10:30 p.m., Mon.-Thurs. 7-12, Fri.-Sat. 10-1. Price: large, $3.25; small, $1.75. Phone: 283-3906. 

Farley 


Farley pizza is a campus connoisseur's delight. A delicious first-rate product is created in the rather modest, foodsales tucked away in the basement ofthe hall. While a few other dorms have better sausage, the pizza of Farley is blessed with delicious, abundant cheese and (a rarity) plenry oftomatoey sauce. And underneath it all is a thick tasty golden crust. True pizza enthusiasts will plan a visit to Farley soon. Hours: Mon.-Thurs. 9­12, Fri. and Sat. 7-9. Small, $2; Large, $3. 

Carroll 


Every Domer should make the long trek to Carroll Hall foodsales at least once, as much for the tasty pizza as for the friendly, homey at­mosphere. Carroll's product is thick and gooey, with plenty ofeverythingfrom crust to topping. The crust is doughy and not cooked quite enough, but much thicker than most. There is enough tomato sauce, for a change, and cheese is heaped on top ofit. The cheese also suffers from being a little underdone, but is nice and stretchy the way some like it. The sausage, though there is plenty ofit, is of average taste. For entertainment while you wait ( 5-l0 minutes), there are video games0 pinball, and foosballlocated next to the foodsales. Hours: 9-1 every day. Price: whole, $3; h3lf, $1.75.

Though it lacks a distinctive sauce, there  
arc few drawbacks to a BP pizza. Its crust is

In general, this pizza would seem very ordi­

Morrissey 


What was Domino's phone number? Mor­rissey residents should commit it to memory. You'd think "The Manor" would have pizza fit for nobility, but pre-packaged pizza is strictly for the peasantry. It takes a special talent to bum pizza crust and still retain its flimsy quality. Contrary to the practice of M>rris­sey's pizza chefs, cheese melted in a microwave oven should be put in a fondue pot, not on a pizza. Morrissey redeems itselfto an extent by pouringlotsofsausage onto each pie. Yet this could be just to hide the sauce, or lack thereof. The scarcity ofsauce explains the overall bland taste: ifthere is no sauce, there can be no spice. A spacious settingcom­plete with a booth in which to enjoyone's piz­za is available. Whether it is clean or not is debatable. Hours: 9-12 every day. Price: whole, $3.25;half, $1.75. 


Lyons 
This is one of the better pizzas on campus. The sausage is meaty and spread over the entire pizza. Sauce is plentiful and delicious. The cheese is a bit failing -it has a gummy consistency and detracts from the overall flavor. The crust is thick and tasty, and nearly cooked to perfection. Sausage, pepperoni, ex­
tra cheese and mushrooms are available at this well-ordered and efficient food sales. Pleasant social space is which to enjoy one's pizza is located nearby. Hours: Sun.-Thurs. 9­11:30. Price: whole, $3;half, $1.75;slice, 
$.50. 


St. Edward's 

The "bare essentials" attitude ofSaint Ed's foodsales permeates the dorm's pizza too. The crust is thin, crispy and tasteless; the sauce watery and unappetizing. Fair-tasting cheese and sausage cannot entirely redeem the quality of this dining fare. Saint Ed's pizza is defmitely not worth traveling great distances for. Hours: Sun.-Thurs.ll-12. Price: large, $2.75; small, $1.85.

Women's tennis team 

Irish win two, Bowling Green next 
By MARY SIEGER 
Sports Writer 

The Notre Dame women's tennis team improved its spring season record to 10-2 as the Irish easily defeated the University of Northern Illinois, 5-2, and Bradley, 8-1, this week before the team departs today for a three-match trip in Bowling Green, Ohio. 
Last night's contest with Northern Illinois at the South Bend Raquet Club was a disappointment for the Irish since the team was unable to complete the competition. Due to a mix-up in court scheduling, the Irish were forced to leave after the team won its fifth match. 
"We were unable to finish our number two and number three doubles matches," said sophomore co-captain Greta Roemer. "It would have been 7-2 if we'd been able to finish since both teams were win­ning." 
There were other surprises in store for the Irish last night when the team was forced to make some last minute changes in its startinglineup. Freshman joanne Biafore sub­stituted for Pam Fichette at number four singles, freshman Tammy Schmidt took Laura Lee's spot at number five singles and Roemer covered Biafore's regular starting position at number six singles. 
Schmidt played well for the squad in her debut appearances for the Irish against Northern Illinois and in the number six singles spot in Wed­nesday's competition against Brad­ley. 
"I'm impressed -she kept her concentration and didn't mess around," said Irish co-captain Lisa LaFratta. "It's nice to know there is someone who can step in and win for us." 
Roemer is also unaccustomed to playing singles and last night was her second appearance in the singles competition for the Irish. Although

quarterback job are senior Scott Grooms and freshman Joe Felitsky. 
"I'd have to give the edge to Scott Grooms right now just because of experience," says Hudson. "Joe hasn't played the game in about two years because of injuries, but he's improving with each given week." 
Grooms, at 6-2, 197-pounds, returned to Notre Dame from Miami of Ohio and sat out the 1982 cam­paign. After earning the backup spot to Blair Kiel in 1983, his season ended abruptly when he suffered a broken collarbone in the season opener against Purdue. 
The 6-3, 205-pound Felitsky has surmounted a high school knee in­jury and summer intestinal surgery to move himself into contention for the quarterback spot. 
Roemer lost her match, she hung on until the end. 
The Irish will play the Falcons in the first of their three weekend matches this afternoon in Bowling Green. Tommorow, the Irish will begin a doubleheader with an easy match with the University ofCentral Michigan. Later in the afternoon, the Irish will battle the University of Miami (Ohio) who is leading the Mid-America Conference. 
When he was given a clean bill of health near the end of last season, Felitsky got some practice ex­
perience by working with the Irish prep team. An extra year of eligibility is a possibility for Felitsky · since his health problems kept him out of varsity competition for all of 
1983. 
"Joe Felitsky's most valuable asset is his arm," says Hudson. "He's a big man that can throw the ball. The big­gest thing right now is experience. He doesn't have confidence in what he's doing. He doesn't understand everything yet; but he's working at trying to get better at it. It will just take time." 
Under the leadership of Steve Beuerlein, the quarterback situation looks very promising for the Irish. Having two eager backups in Grooms and Felitsky can never hurt. And with plenty of time still ahead for all three, it appears that things can only get better.

Baseball team swept by Wolverines 
By ERIC SCHEUERMANN 
Sports Writer 

The Notre Dame baseball team 
expected two tough games from the 
Spartans of Michigan State on Wed­
nesday, and that is exactly what it 
got. 

The Spartans had no trouble sweeping the Irish by scores of 7-1 and 7-2, as the Irish could not seem to muster any timely hitting. 
In the first game, the Spartans jumped out to a 2-0 lead in te first inning off Irish starter Buster Lopes. Although Notre Dame came back with a run in the second, MSU quick­ly ran away with the game by scoring five runs over the fourth, fifth, and sixth innings. 
Spartan hurler Ralf Mojsiejenko hurt a Notre Dame team for the second time this year. After punting MSU to victory over the Irish in foot­ball this fall, Mojsiejenko pitched a five-hitter for the victory. Mike Metzler and Tom Shields each had 
two hits for the Irish. Lopes took the loss and is now 0-3. loss, lowering his record to 2-2. The Irish are now 11-12 for the In the second contest, Notre season, and face a tough Xavier Uni­

team Kepler Invitational hosted by 
Ohio State University. 
Last weekend in a tournament dominated by a tough opening round on Saturday and horrible weather conditions on Sunday, the Irish were able to come away with a 1Oth place finish and an average of 76, 5-over-par, for the two day, 36­hole Purdue InviationaL 
According to Irish Head Coach Noel O'Sullivan, the key to the tournament were the extraordinari­ly tough first 18 holes which were dominated by teams with full scholarship players. Purdue, the host team and winner of the event, shot a 355 (71 average) Saturday. 
"The competition was extremely stiff (with eight Big Ten teams) on the first day with others teams shooting 71's, 72's, and 73's," said O'Sullivan. "The Notre Dame showing was not at all humiliating or disappointing-it just wasn't up to that caliber that day." 
The second round action, which was plagued by high winds, brought the tournament back to reality according to O'Sullivan. The Irish, who were an average of 5 strokes off the pace on Saturday, finished 2 strokes off the pace on Sunday and 3 strokes off the winning team's pace which ended at 731 compared to 768 for the Irish. 
"Although the placement seems weak,'' commented O'Sullivan, "the performance of the N~tre Dame gol­fers was prideful and strong." 
Irish scores from the Purdue In­vitational were Moorman 74-82-154, Leyes 74-80-154, Pangraze 77-78-155, O'Donovan 77­78-155, Bona 79-77-156, and Huf­fman 82-74-I 56. 
In Columbus, the Irish will be competing against Ohio State, In­diana, and Ball State, all ofwhom are considered "perennial powers." 
This 54-hole, three-day tourna­ment will begin this afternoon and will continue through Sunday on Ohio State's Scarlet GolfCourse. 


Rowing team hosts first spring regatta 
By KATHLEEN NICHOLSON 
Sports Writer 
This Sunday, the Notre Dame men's and women's rowing team will host their first spring regatta of the 1984 season on their racing course located on the St. Joe's River. 
The men's and women's teams compromised of both novice and varsity boats will test their prowess against Northwestern University and Grand Valley Rowing Club in a series of rowing events. 
With the completion of the new boathouse and the addition of many new boats this year, the club hopes that new interest will be sparked for the sport of rowing here at Note Dame. 
Students are encouraged to come see the competition this Sunday. The race begins at 11 a.m. at the boathouse on the St. Joe River about 
1.5 miles off Notre Dame Avenue.
