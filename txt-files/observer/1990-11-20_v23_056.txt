Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein bnlievns thn U.S. does not have llw stomach for a protracted conflict with his nation, accord­ing to intellignnce sources of syndkatml columnist .lack An­derson. 
•Press conference/ page 6 
Sourcns of Andmson. whose syndicated column appears in almost 1,000 newspapers worldwidn, say Hussein does not fear a U.S. invasion. Hus­sein thinks Anwrican public opinion would quickly turn against sueh an invasion as U.S. casualties mounted. according to souret~s quoted by Anderson. 
Hussein's strategy. aeeording to Anderson's sources, is to wait until Americans lose pa­tience with the tension in the l'nrsian (;ulf and demand that the U.S. pull its troops out if the rngion.

dose relations with Iraq prior to its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. lie said that the U.S. knew of Hussein's brutality and hostile intentions before the invasion, but did nothing to stop him. 
"We knew from intelligence reports that Hussein was a street thug," Anderson said, "and that he was preparing to seize the oil fields of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia." 
Anderson believes Hussein was unnerved by President 
Bush's organization of the coalition of nations in opposi­tion to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Hussein regained his confidence, according to Ander­son, due to Bush's inability to clearly articulate to Americans the reasons behind the U.S. military presence in Saudi Ara­bia. 
"Bush must explain to the American people that Iraqi con­trol of the Persian Gulf oil fields would mean economic calamity for the U.S." Anderson said. "Hussein would raise oil prices indiscriminately, creating an inflationary spiral that would plunge the American economy into a depression." 
Anderson believes the U.S. can prevail in this crisis 'without resorting to war by maintaining economic sanctions against Iraq until they really take effect. "We can wait him out," Ander­son said. 
Anderson's talk was spon­sored by Notre Dame's Student Government.

No wine to be served this year at the JPW dinner 

By CHRIS WILKINSON 
News Writer 
Juniors receJvmg letters about Junior Parents' Weekend (JPW) will find one difference in this year's program: no wine will be served with the Saturday dinner. 
The decision to stop serving wine was made by the JPW committee to comply with the Indiana state drinking age of 21, assistant director of Student Activities Charlie Francis said. In the past, wine has been served with the Saturday night formal dinner. 
"We recognized that there are students undf'r the age of 21 who would be at the dinner," said Francis. To accommodate those students who are 21 and over, a cash bar will be avail­able at the Friday night gala. but not at the Saturday night dinner. 
The issun arose when th11 of­fice of student affairs suggnsted that the .JPW committee reconsider serving wine, he said. · 
This year's .IPW is scheduled for the weektmd of Feb. 15-17.

Iraq, under President Saddam Hussein, invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, and presently there are over 400,000 Iraqi troops in Kuwait. The U.S. has over 200,000 troops in Saudi Arabia. and Bush announced last week that he would send an ad­ditional 200,000 in order to give the U.S. oiTensive capabili­ties.

An aspiring artist makes poetry easy 
Lo, offtimes have I yearned to surrender to the artist in my soul. I have this fan­tasy where one day, upon close scrutiny of my cuticles, I discover the meaning of life 

and deci_de to forsake Paige Smoron 
my previOus, superfi­cial existence and be-Asst. Accent Editor come a poet. 1 will relinquish my hot rollers and wan­der around barefoot with leaves in my hair. I will wear black turtlenecks and not even 
care if I look sallow. I will work the word "alas" into dinner conversation whenever possible. 
In high school I took this creative writing course so that I would have a solid literary base when the time came. Sadly, there was only one selection I was particularly fond of, and although the allusions are pretty obscure, I aspire to someday be an­thologized thusly: 
Crayola 64 

Burnt Sienna, Maize and Henna 
Melon, Peach and Teal; 
When my crayons become too dull 
Their paper I must peel. 
Of course, great poetry needs no explana­tion, but that piece is just darn deep, deves­tating in its simplicity, yet a profound com­mentary on the fast-paced thrill-seekers that saturate society. Plus it has a really snappy meter. 
Oddly, Crayola 64's timelessness was con­firmed recently in the controversial color renovation. Not unlike so many unfortunate species, such as the dodo birds (were they a species?), "maize" is now extinct, a sad re­flection on the state of the environment. In an even more bizarre turn, only this year "teal" has been added. If I had bothered to check one of those boxes with the built-in sharpeners, I would have known that, but ironically, my apathy has resulted in sheer visionary genius. 
I will leave any further interpretation to my esteemed colleagues. Its message is uni­versal, yet its imagery will arrest each reader in a personal way. 
I'll admit that the idea of being immortal­ized in verse is alluring. One guy in my class, we'll call him Tim, had such a fear of death that he created his own form of poetry that will doubtless live on for centuries. After we learned about the "cinquain," Tim came up with the "Timquain," a sample of which follows: 
Pen (A noun. Any noun.) 
Hen (Word that rhymes with noun.) 
Red, Feather, Lady (Three adjectives de­
scribing second noun.) Eathery-Fay (Middle adjective translated into Pig-Latin.) Thank you, Tim. (Last line is always. "Thank you. Tim. ") 
I don't feel I'm artistically ripe enough to attempt anything that innovative. but I have been working lately on a new poem to round out my collection. It's about mimes. The rhyme potential is mind-boggling.

Students form group to deal with the dangers of AIDS 
By BECKY RITZERT 
News Writer 
According to th1~ Cnntnr for Disnasn Control. 2-3 of every I 000 college studnnts are in­fnr.tlld by the AIDS virus. 
It is statistics likn thnse that havn caused a group of con­r.ernml Notre Dame students to form Students with AIDS Training ISWATl in order to alert other students to the dan­gers of A[J)S and to educate thmn in methods of prevnntion.

"We think we're not at risk. We get this false sense of secu­rity because of the media," Bradley said. 
Shn emphasized that, despite rumors that only drug addicts and homosexual men contract AII>S. they are far from being thn only people at risk. The number of women testing posi­tive for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is increasing, said 
Bradley. 
There is an increased focus on the spread of AIDS among college students because college is a time of experimentation and students have a sense of immortality, Bradley said. 
"Our sense of future is very short-term. You have to really· think of what you're going to dp in 10 years," said Bradley. She explained that it may take 10 ynars for an AIDS carrier to discover an infection. 
DaCosta Fernandes also stressed the long-term effects of unsafe sex by saying, "Whatever decision you make will affect your life and the lives of others." 
"There are certain skills which are important in stop­ping the spread of AIDS," said DaCosta Fernandes. These skills, she said, include com­municating with a sexual part­ner and knowing the facts about AIDS. 
"It'!j your right to say no," she said. "If you say no, stand by your decis~on ... If you say yes, use protectiOn. 
Seager, who serves as SWAT's advisor, explained that the virus cannot be spread through casual contact because, even if the virus is present, it becomes approximately five percent as potent as it originally was as soon as it is exposed to air. 

The transfer of AIDS must be "fluid-to-fluid," she said. How­ever, she added that saliva is not a fluid in which the transfer

Early versions of DART booklets were recycled 
Special to The Observer 
The early versions of the DART Schedule of Courses Booklet were recycled last week in an effort to avoid disposing of them in a landfill. 
The Office of the Registrar informed the Recyclin' Irish of the 10,000 available booklets and offered to hold them until a recycler was willing to accept them, said Paul Ruesch, presi­dent of Recyclin' Irish. 
Since Notre Dame's current recycling program does not in­volve office waste paper or computer paper at this time, a 

special paper recycling com­
pany had to be located to take 
the booklets. 

Recycling the booklets was particularly difficult due to the combinations of paper types and staples in the booklet. However, a paper recycling company in Plymouth, Ind. ac­cepted the booklets. 
Student Government pro­vided the funding for the cost involved in recycling the book­lets. Volunteers working with 
-the University recycling pro­gram assisted in collection and transportation of the DAHT booklets.

Weather raises conc-erns for 'last secret mission' 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -Thick clouds and high winds at a California landing site raised concerns as NASA guided Atlantis' astronauts home Monday to end what's been billed as the last secret spying mission for the Pen­tagon. 
• Landing was scheduled for 
4:48 p.m. EST at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., and the weather forecast there was about as dismal as it had been in Florida on launch day. Con­ditions at the desert base were expected to worsen Tuesday. 
If the weather appeared bad enough to endanger the safety of a landing, NASA could decide to keep the shuttle aloft an extra day and try again Tuesday. 
During the Defense Depart­ment mission, the crew released a satellite that reportedly is to spy on Iraq and sent a holiday message to American troops stationed in the Persian Gulf. 
"During the last few days, we aboard Atlantis have circled the Earth many times," said Air Force Col. Richard Covey, mission commander. "Whenever we pass close to Saudi Arabia we cannot help but think of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines deployed there for Desert Shield. 
"As the holiday season ap­proaches, the multi-service crew of Atlantis wishes those brave warriors peace and a speedy return home. Our prayers are for them and their families." 
The message was sent to Earth on Sunday evening, and NASA provided transcripts.

The Observer/Elisa Klosterman 

Doctor John Larossa gave a lec­ture Tuesday titled "Changes in Medicine: Are You Interested?" 
to constraints. 
Nonetheless, "we're not losing as much control as we think we are." he said. "primarily be­cause of the relationship be­tween patient and physician." 
Other problems in the medical field inelude: 
• 
the great disparity between the financial gains of those who diagnose patients and those who actually help the patients physically. 

• 
the disadvantages of both institutional service and private practice. While some physicians may opt for the security of 


hospital employment, they face the problems of balancing structured lives and the raising of a family. If a physician does not devote his life entirely to the hospital, he or she might be poorly treated by the adminis­tration, Larossa said. 
However, he eontinued, one must be wary of attempting to set up a private practice, since a person must face enormous financial debt and business problems on which he has no formal background. 
Private practice is a gamble, according to Larussa, yet the decision between private or public depends on personal ori­entation. "There are different ideas about what the practice of medicine should be." 
• long work weeks. While past physicians have held the belief that continuous work keeps that practice fresh in one's mind, people are now questioning the value of long work weeks, said Larossa. Fa­tigue and pressure may lead to errors and poor practice, he continued. 
Even now, however, "there are changes that will make it easier for physicians to have more time;" it's up to the physi­cians, he continued. 
The medical profession does, however, have great benefits, concluded Larossa. "What keeps you in medicine is the pleasure you get in taking care of patients and...the relation­ship between patient and physi­cian. Money has little to do with it." 
"There's a level of reward that goes beyond the money," he said.

Anderson says a war in Gulf won't be 'a Panama' 
By MARK CAWLEY News Writer 
Americans must be prepared to face large casualties in an extended war with Iraq if peaceful solutions do not end the current .stalemate in the Persian Gulf, according to Jack Anderson. 
Anderson, a Pulitzer Prize­winning journalist, held a news conference at the Center for Continuing Education yesterday to discuss the Persian Gulf cri­sis. "This crisis is a real one," he said, and if war erupts, "it won't be like Grenada or Panama." 
He quoted Pentagon figures which estimate the U.S. would suffer 15,000 casualties in the first twenty days of a war. "This is more casualties in so short a time since the Civil War," Anderson said. 
"Hussein knows that Ameri­cans don't have the stomach for this," he said. Anderson added that Saddam Hussein will try to 
Average price of gasoline falls almost a penny a gallon 
LOS ANGELES (AP) -The average price of gasoline fell almost a penny a gallon over the past two weeks -the biggest drop nationwide since the Persian Gulf crisis began ­according to a survey released Sunday. 
Prices dropped for all grades except leaded regular at full service pumps, the Lundberg Survey of 13,500 stations found. The survey compared prices Nov. 16 with those of Nov. 2, when the survey was last conducted. 
The national average for all grades of gasoline was 145.98 cents, a drop of about .94 cent a gallon since Nov. 2. 
Trilby Lundberg, who directs

"out-wait us" in the Persian Gulf. "If he thought that we would strike all the way to Baghdad and pin his hide to the wall, he would be acting dif­ferently." 
Anderson said he believes that the United States has three options to resolve the Gulf cri­sis. "We must either choose to attack, wait, or withdraw," he said. "Withdrawal would mean $100 a barrel oil prices which would slam the brakes on the American economy," he said. 
Even though attacking Iraq might end the crisis swiftly, Anderson said, "we [the United States] should camp out in the desert and wait. The sanctions will take effect in about eigh­teen months." 
He added, "the President has done a poor job of explaining why we are over there." The American presence in the Gulf region is justifiable, Anderson said, but "the American people will not be patient if they are not told exactly why we are there." 
the survey, attributed the drop to recent declines in wholesale prices. 
The survey found average prices at self-service pumps were 135.10 cents for regular unleaded, 151.19 cents for premium unleaded and 131.61 cents for regular leaded. 
Averages at full-service sta­tions were 157.76 cents for regular unleaded, 171.41 cents for premium uuleaded and 
154.90 cents for regular leaded. 
Lundberg said that while the Nov. 2 survey showed drops in some parts of the nation, the latest survey reflected drops nationwide. It was the first sig­nificant drop in price since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2, she said.

Conference to discuss costs of war 
By MEREDITH McCULLOUGH News Writer 
The economics of war and peace will be the focus of a con­ference of internationally prominent economists to be held at Notre Dame Nov. 30­Dec. 1. 
The conference, titled "Economic Issues of Disarma­ment," will be held in the Center for Continuing Education (CCE). It marks the first time such a prestigious group has met to discuss this subject in detail. 
The conference is a chance for renown economists to put their knowledge of expertise to use, according to Jurgen Brauer, the conference orga­nizer and visiting a~istant pro­fessor of Business Administra­tion and Economics at Saint Mary's. 
This opportunity was made possible by Economists Against the Arms Race (ECAAR). Brauer, who joined the organi­zation at its start in Dec. 1988, explains that the group of economists formed when "the arms race got so out of hand" in order to "make a more public stance and a more detailed expression of the cost in-



Announcing A Poetry Contest 
in honor of The Sesquicentennial Year 
Open to alumni, current students and staff, and present and former faculty members 
A prize of $500 dollars is offered for the chosen poem selected by the judges. The winner will be brought to the campus for SY celebration and a reading of the poem. The prize-winning poem will be selected from entries from the four aforementioned categories, with runners-up from each category possible. 
The poem need not be directly concerned with Notre Dame, or the Sesquicentennial, though submissions which touch upon the themes of the Sesquicentennial (Belief, Inquiry, Community) will be looked at with special interest. 
Previously published poems are not eligible. Send entries (no more than 3 poems) in triplicate, with no name on the poems themselves, but on a removable coversheet, by April 15th, 1991, to SY Poetry Contest in care of The Department of English, University of Notre Dame, IN, 46556. 
volved." 

Until the time of.the founding of ECAAR there was "never any attempt to join together to make public statements." 
Brauer hopes that during this conference "policy makers will take note of what we have to say." 
Among those speaking at the conference will be: Kenneth Ar­row, professor of economics at Stanford Univetsity; Robert Eisner, professor of economics at Northwestern University; Lawrence Klein, professor of economics and finance at the University of Pennsylvania; Amartya Sen, professor at Harvard University; and Victor Sidel, professor' of social medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and presi­dent emeritus of the Physicians for Social Responsibility. 
The conference will .consist of eight sessions, each covering different areas of interest. Some topics to be included: 
•economics 
of the military sector and its conversion; 

•mutual 
disarmament in NATO and WTO countries; 

•effects 
of disarmament on international trade flows; 


•disarmament and third 
world development. For a complete listing of the sessions and their times, inter­ested parties can pick up a brochure at the information desk of the CCE. 
The conference is free of charge for all Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students, faculty and staff, but those who wish to attend must register before the conference at the CCE to gain access to lecture materials. 
Although the conference will be aimed primarily towards "fellow scholars" and policy makers, Brauer said that "everyone at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's is encouraged to attend." 
He pointed out that each par­ticipant will profit from the conference depending upon each one's level of preparation, but that everyone can at least benefit by seeing "how these famous economists behave, act and are." 
The keynote address will be given on Nov. 30 at 8 p.m. and is open to the public. 
The conference is co-spon­sored by Notre Dame's Center for the Study of Contemporary Society, the Helen Kellogg Insti­tute for International Studies, the College of Business Admin­istration and the Department of Economics.

Damaging trends in higher education explain its decline 
'Sex and love have nothing to do with female or male. It is just whenever two souls happen to be.' 
Bob Dylan 
!Jf'ar liditor: 

Ttwre has bfl!m much talk of latP about lhP condition of Anwriean libnral arts universi­tiPs. Major magazinfls and newspapPrs, as wPll as count­lpss journals. have dedicated PntirP issues to praising or, morP commonly, criticizing Anwrica's collPgfls and univer­sitif's. Evmt Tlw ObsflrVflr has henn filled with criticisms con­cnrning tlw wrdl-being of Notre DamP.. 
lligher Pducation in America has bm~n on thn dndine for the past twenty years. I approach this conclusion not from the fact that 25 pnreent of the col­lPge sPniors pollf'd in a 1989 Gallup Survf'y were nPither able to locatP. Columbus' voyage within the correct half century nor diff11rentiate between the words of .Josflph Stalin and Winston Churchill; but, instflad, from thfl fundamental changfls now occurring on America's campuses. Some of thesfl changes include rflvised core courses, trendy new tracts of study and the dropping of en­tire departments. 
Tlw general trend at many American institutions is in two dirflctions-away from the arts and lPtt!lrs (toward science and n•search) and away from the traditional eon~ course of study (toward a non-Western culture based curriculum). The former movflmPnt is, perhaps, the most evidPnt. On many campuses, social science and liberal arts departmental staffs are being depleted and undermanned in order to fn~11 up money for new scientific research facilities and laboratories. Class sizes in all fields of study are growing at a tremPndous rate as more and more professors t11ach fewer and fewer r.lassPs per academic term in order to concentrate on 
DOONESBURY 
research and publication. 

These changes havP a marked effect on the und11rgraduates. A student at today's university is receiving a more specializPd, carePr­orientPd Pducation instead of a general one. This is a marked change from the traditional purpose of a collPge. 
John llenry Newman argues eorrectly in his preface to The Idea of a University that the function of a univPrsity is the formation of the mind, not thn incurrencP of vocational skills. UnfortunatPly, many American coll•~ges are deviating from the original intent of a university education as put forth by Cardinal Newman. 
The second noticeabiP move­ment in higher education today is away from traditional tracts and methods of study and to­ward trendy nPw onns. 
Today, many colleges are be­ginning to supplemPnt or Pven replace traditional course sem­inars with computPr-generated and computer-based lessons. Perhaps more information can be retained from clicking but­tons on the screen of an imper­sonal computer, but this, is not the purpose of a university. The role of the university is to "teach universal knowledge" which can only be accomplished by the tried-and­true, traditional methods of teaching. 
Another disturbing trend on American campuses is a move away from the traditional Western civilization-based cur­riculum. At many universities, including Notre Dame, it is possible to graduate without taking a single Western history or Western civilization class. 
These traditionally corfl type courses are being attacked by some liberal educators and politicians as being biased and racial. For example, at Stanford University recently, Jesse Jackson led 500 studPnts in a rally chanting "Hey, hey, hey. ho! Western culture's got to go." The administration re­acted to this dangerous ultima­tum by cutting down its courses in WestPrn civilization. 
Claims that Western civiliza­tion and culture are too narrow in their views and too biased in thPir teachings are unfounded. John Silber wrote in The Intercollegiate Review that "the culture of the West, as long as we have records of it, has been penetrated by the culture of the East." The fact is that Western culture is all-encompassing and never has been ethnocentric. It offers the best foundation for a good liberal arts education and should remain the cornerstone of America's colleges. 
A final concern is the current administrative actions on many campuses intended to violate 
Student submits_ alternative Bill of Rights 
Dear Editor: 

I would like to submit for public review the following al­ternative version of the Student Bill of Rights: 
Article 1: The University shall make no rule respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the free­dom of speech or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the University for a re­dress of grievances. 
Article II: The right of the people to be secure in their per­sons, houses, papers and ef-
GARRY TRUDEAU QUOTE OF THE DAY 
fects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to he searched and the persons or things to be seized. 
Article III: No person shall be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compl:'lled in any case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty or prop­erty, without due process of law; nor shall private property studt-nts' right to free speech. One case of this infringement can bfl found at Dartmouth College, when~ a conservativP publication, the Dartmouth Hevi•~w. has consistently been penalized for publishing opin­ions contrary tn the official views of the college. 
There is littl11 or no evidPnce to support the claims madn by the college officials and that the impediment of free speech is not in direct contrast to the United States Constitution. 
In the midst of all this seem­ing chaos and confusion, I be­lieve that, for starters, Notre Dame should resist the rising temptation to move toward be­coming a research-basnd uni­versity. The administration should retain the requirements it has so as to provide a tradi­tional liberal arts education with its foundation of WPstern Civilization. 
I also encourage the aca­demic leaders of Notre Dame to refrain from the temptation to initiate or evPn eontinue un­provPn, fad-prompted concen­trations such as g11nder or peace studies. lnshmd, let the time-proven idPals of thPse eourses find thPir way into the f'Stablished core curriculum. 

Finally, charge thP University to pass measures ensuring the fref'doms of speech, assembly and press for all students and student groups, right-wing as well as left-wing, and to resist the temptation of Pnacting a spPnch code. 
In this age of perp11tual pro­gressivism and sometimes mindless "advancPments," the words of Lynnr> Cheney hold a grPat deal of credence: "Not PvPrything shifts and changes. Not 11verything is relativP. Some things do endure-and college should be a time to ex­plor£1 history and thought for valuPs that havP stood the test of timP."

Charges of football illiteracy unjustly implicate female fans 
/)(>ar !J'dilor: 
ChnAr, chenr for old Notre Dame. It is great to feel I am a part of this spirited family that nwels in coming together on Saturday afternoons to hail a toam that no mattor what the 
A.P. poll says, is number one. (Yes, Mr. Snyder, I do under­stand what football rankings mean.) It really pained me to sn~> that all of those days I spent chP-ering for a tP.am that I thought represP.nted both the men and thP wonwn of Notre Dame werP wasted because I obviously cannot undPrstand the ganw as Wf~ll as my male counterparts. 
Apparently, the Notre Dame administration IlPglActed to mention in Du Lac that women arn incapable of achieving that. statl' of nnar fr('nzy when play­Prs such as Hod Smith pull on· yet anothnr Fighting Irish mir­ndn. We poor, ignorant women­folk should only be prnsnnt to carHss t.lw bruised 11gos of thn JJIPnfolk whnn our offensive or defensivn plays go amok, or to fetch them a b1~1'r when their palates so desire. Ah, the joys of lwing a woman. 
My daddy didn't raise a fool, and he most t:ertainly didn't raisf~ a football illitf~rate. Maybo Mr. Snydnr had partaken of a bit too many "brow-has" whon he foolishly composed his poignant piece of male chauvinist garbag11. My nxpP-rillncp, of football at Notre Dame has been just as reward­ing as his beer-bellied, belching buffoons. Yes, I too participate in snction pile-ons, hysterieal shouting and the gennral Irish euphoria that can be found in tho stadium and dorm rooms alike. And no, it n~ally isn't nec­ossary to provide women a room for watching animated fairy taiP-s. powdering noses, or as an outlet to gossip about how lucky we are to hn cheering for "their" team. 
Tlw only fairy tale that I would like to see is for some of the. men of Notre Dame to get off of thoir butts. opon their minds and leave their ugly jokns about womnn behind them. Whilo WP. are in tho pro­eess ol' eliminating problems, why don't wn start with that in­sipirl, sexist quiz. 
All I can say to Mr. Snyder's "humorous" description of male/female football interaction is that he is going to find it really diiTicult to invite over any 
woman games.  for  future  football

Observer exhibits poor judgement 
Dear Hditor: 
I should hope this is one of many letters The Observer re­ceives concr.rning Michael Snyder's article "Women and Football: Do They Mix?" (Nov. 
14) Just to be eoncisP-, allow me to name a few adjectives that com11 to mind: immature, ol'­fensivll, creatively and stylisti­cally lacking, and magnificently unfunny. 
What really sickens me is that Thn Ohsorvnr would print such an intelleetually void and un­humorous artiele. Time and space, nnt to mention that I must "jump up to 'freslwn up' in th11 powdPr room," do not pnrmit me to complfltely rehash the oll'ensive phras11s and innu­endos in the articlH. I would not want to insult anyone's in­telligence by pointing out the obvious. I Cl'rtainly would not want to print the key lines from the article more than once; that might ho a little too much hu­mor for thfl campus to take. 
I understand The Observer may print articles not necessar­ily acceptable to everyone, but I should hope there could be a more entertaining, or even in­tellectually stimulating, use found for three-quarters of a page of journalism. I'm just so glad I'm one of the "girls" who knows thP. game of football, so I'm "not that bad". Thanks so much for opening my eyes; now I need to go look at videotapes of football play11rs' butts.

Women participating in sports refute columnist's sexist slant 
By Chris Cooney 
"Women and Football: Do 

They Mix?" A better question might be "Freshmen and Newspaper Columns: Should They Be Allowed?" ThP answer, ·flxhibited by at least one OhservPr article (Nov. 14), is a 
resounding "no." 
Not only does Michanl Snyder 

insult (Wery sports-loving 
woman on this campus, he also 
perpetuates thn stereotypes and 
prejudi<:es that exist at NotrP 
Dame. Love of football dons not. 
dep(md on the pri)senee of a Y 
chromosome in onp's genes. 
Replace the word "girls" with 
"blaeks" or "homosexuals" and 
what type of reaction do you 
think you will receive? This 
type of snxism should never be 
tolerated at a univnrsity in the 
1990's. 
I hope that most of Synder's 

comments are based on what I 
see as extreme ignorance and 
immaturity. I, too, sat in a room 
of both men and women (all 
sP.niors) to watch the Notre 
Dame-Tennessfle game. 
However, any "yapping" was done by everyone, and both genders had insightful and in­teresting comments to make on the game. The mPn did not turn into "heathen anima.ls." The women did not "gossip." Wo werfl more worried about tllP. officiating and the lousy com­mentators than the "powdor room." In faet, I'd bet that a couple of us "girls" could tnarh Snyder a thing or two about the sport of football. 
I hop!' as Snyder goes through his four years at Notre Dame he will rPaJizp that peo­ple do not always fall into easy gnnder stereotypes. Although hll calls himsnlf a journalist and insists that he listened to all sides of the issue, I'm sun~ that most of his quotes wore fabri­cated -revealing his own atti­tudes at thfl expPnse of a num­ber of people. t\lthough he trifls to lighten the tone by suggest­ing that both men and womPn take his tongue-and-ehnek quiz, the damage was already donn. 
Women on this campus play interhall football. Women on this campus work for the sports department of The Obscorvor (the sports nditor last yPar, in fact, was a woman). Womnn on this campus work as managers and trainers for thA football team land not bncanse thoy enjoy looking at 300-pound players). 
I'm sun~ tlw writer intnnded his column to lw humorous. Be'II probably bo amused at thn amount of angry mail he rP­cPivns. But ehauvinisrn is not a laughing mat.tf~r. ospflcially in what is supposl'd to be thP ~Yoar of Wonwn.~ 
I hopP the rwxt timo someonn with only ·three months expl'rienefl on this campus decides to writn a column he will not resort to tirPd, ovnrusnd subjects in his qunst for an easy laugh. wn· f1~malP football fans would rather rPad som11thing hy someone who knows what hn is talking about.

Article stifles relations between sexes 
Dear Editor: 
I am writing in response to Michael Snyder's article (The Observer, Nov. 14). Mr. Snyder's views are his own and he has the right to hold them regardless of how sexist and ill­informed they are. I do not, however, feel that the Observer was right in printing the article. If this article were about blacks, Hispanics, or any other minority group, there is very little doubt in my mind that no editor would allow its publica­tion. 
I also would like to speak for many of the women on this campus who wem equally of­fended. I know that others were angered by this article, beeause, walking across cam­pus today, I repeatedly heard complaints about it. 
First of all, why is knowledge of football a requirement for acceptance into society? Most men learn from being eneour­aged to play the game and from interaction with peers of the same sex. Women often do not have these football learning ex­periences. How many "knowledgeable" men offer or even attempt to honestly ex­plain football to women? Some of us know enough to fully un­derstand and enjoy the game, and some of us want to lParn enough to do so. Maybe some women don't want to learn about football, hut I still have tremendous difficulty with the logic used in this artide. 

If "men did not want any women to be in the samo room with them during the game," then why was the solution "to not invite members of the op­positl' sex" outvoted? 
"Grown, cultured, and civi­lized men" do not write and publish sexist and d1~mPaning articles. 
And why should anyone imply that "all they'rn doing is looking at the players' butts'?" What is attractive about a 300 pound man's butt? Mr. Synder should take thP time out to listP.n to a fpw male comments about groups such as the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders. "Wow, what an incredible gran jete into a fabulous stag leap!" is not one of the comments onP. often hears. 
If only women are jumping up to get drinks, thPn how do the men get those "brew-has" in their hands? And how many "powder rooms " are there in Morrissey? How many women use the words "freshen up" and then procned to carry hair spray, powder, perfume, deodorant, lipstick, hairbrush, curling iron, nail polish, and otlwr arrwnitins with them to these "powder rooms?" Thnsf' women must also lift weights, a "manly" sport. in ord11r to carry a bag that would probably weigh twenty pounds. 
Lastly, I would like to thank Mr. Snyder from those of us who understand football and passPd the quiz. We swflar, yell, drink hHPr, and, when so inelined, lwlch right along with the rest of you. It's nice to know that wt> are "not that bad," nvP.n though bning female appnars to bf' an inherent evil. 
Wn are. hnwover, taking votes on .that IIPisman Trophy win­

One of the many works by Lisa H. Lockhart, 'Locks,' consists of oil and araohite on canvas. 



ThP work of Lisa Lockhart, oil paintings. graphitl' drawings and mixPd mPdia swlpture, are "pprsonal abstract narra­tiws... " and "fragmPnts" of her past. Tlw paintings rangP in sizt\ from I (,x20" to 5x6· with Pach containing a multitude of information achiPvnrl by lines both narrow and widP, straight and curvnd with thP thickly paintPd surfacn both hiding and rPvnuling abstract shapPs and forms. Earh eolor, in all of the paintings has an intPnsity of its own-from thP fiery reds to thn midnight blues-that work to Pmphasizn tho abstract. quality of nach painting. 
Tho drawings are mai-nly graphite that reliPs on the rnpntitivn motion of the linP that movns around in an organic motion to crc:•ate an image. 
The seulptures are nqually as intriguing as the rest of the nxhibil, partly dun to the small size in comparison to the overwht>lming amount of two­dimensional work. The size attracts the viewer's attPntion, and draws thnm in to further inspnct the surfacP quality as wPII as tho content of each piPee that ean be viewed from all sides. 
This Pxhibit will remain on display in Little TlwatrP Gallery un 
ThP third Pxhibit. by Warren Seelig, is titlPd. "Columns, Wings, and Up the Wall." Tlwse seulptures are constructed of thin mPtal rods and diffnrnnt co\ornd meshed libers that arn suspPnded from tlw ceiling and hanhring on the wall. The color of the fibHr is individual to oach piece that is strntehed tightly over an nntire snction and creates a protnetive laynr over the intricate inner structure of Paeh piecn. The forms have a stabln look to them. yet because they arn suspended from the ceiling they becoml' precarious. This forces the viewer to become intensely aware of the space he or she is entering. 
This exhibit will also remain on display in Hammes Gallery until Deeember 14.

Bussey shines in first Bengals start 
CINCINNATI (API -Barney Bussey finally got his first start as a Cincinnati Bengal, stepping in for injured safety David Fulcher, and what did he do? 
Well, he accounted for a two­touchdown swing in Sunday's 27-3 victory over the Pittsburgh 
. Steelers. 
"Me and David play basically the same game," said Bussey. "We're both physical players." 
Late in the first half, Bussey single-handedly stopped a Steeler touchdown on a fake punt, upending Dan Stryzinski so close to the goal line that Stryzinski's helmet crossed the line-but the ball didn't. 

-
"I knew it was a fake all the way. I new the guy was going to run, but I was kind of caught 
between a rock and a hard place. I had to stay with the coverage guy, but I saw him (Stryzinski) when he started to run," Bussey said. 
"At some point, you have to let go of the guy you're covering. I knew it was going to be close. I zeroed in on his numbers, but he dove on me. That's why it was so close." 
Then, in the third quarter, Bussey scooped up a Pittsburgh fumble and ran 70 yards for a touchdown. 
"I didn't have to do anything but pick it up and take off," Bussey said. "All I had to do was beat a lineman, and if I couldn't do that I'd have never heard the end of it." 
Bussey was the Bengals' fifth­round draft pick in 1984, but he signed with the Memphis Showboats of the USFL. He fi­nally joined the Bengals in 1986, and has spent his NFL time backing up Fulcher, a two­time Pro-Bowl selection . 
"I wasn't trying to fill his shoes. You can't fill David's shoes. He's a great player," said Bussey. "I was just trying to do the things I can do. 
"David told me just keep my head in the game and react to what they do. That's what I did." 
Bussey said he was a little surprised that the Steelers didn't try to take advantage of him in his first start. 
"I kind of thought they would run my way, but they didn't," he said. "They stayed with their game plan, and we stayed with ours. And you saw what hap­pened." 
The Bengals' defense, which entered the. game ranked the. NFL's second-worst statistically, played a more inspired game Sunday night despite the absence of Fulcher. ·Linebacker Carl Zander said it was just a matter of consistency. 
"I think it's been a matter of we've been playing hard one play and not as hard the next," he said. "We just kept coming after them -good, solid de­fense." 

Artificial turf claims first Bear in Stinson 


LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) ­Coach Mike Ditka of the Chicago Bears doesn't like artificial turf, and until corner­back Lemuel Stinson went down with a season-ending knee injury Sunday, the Bears were free of serious injuries this season. 
"That's the main reason," said Ditka when asked if the Bears have been relativ'ely (ree of serious injuries because they have yet to play on artificial turf. 
The Bears have played all 10 of their games on real grass in compiling a 9-1 record that has them close to clinching their sixth divisional title in seven years. They can clinch this week with a victory at Minnesota if the Green Bay Packers lose to Tampa Bay. 
They'll have to do it without Stinson, the colorful cornerback who injured his right knee in the first series of the 16-13 overtime victory at Denver. 
"The injury report isn't good but it isn't unbearable," said Ditka Monday. "The worst thing that happened is we lose Lemuel. It's the same knee he hurt last year. Someone will have to pick up the slack. He was leading the team in inter­ceptions and was among the league leaders." 
The injury brought to an end what has been an interesting season for Stinson, a 5-9. 160­pound defensive back who was

in his third year. 
Stinson had been making predictions and backing them with his interceptions. The pre­vious week he was involved in a war of words with Deion Sanders and Andre Rison of the Atlanta Falcons. He intercepted two passes in that game to lead the Bears to a 30-24 victory. 
Ditka then took Stinson aside and·told him to refrain from all the talk. 
Stinson cooled the trash talk but in the first series of Sunday's game, Stinson injured his knee and will be out for the season, said trainer Fred Caito 
"We will have to reconstruct the knee," said Caito. "Last year he tore part of the anterior cruciate. This time he tore the rest of it." 
Ditka said the Bears will have cornerbacks Donnell Woolford and Maurice Douglass back this week for the game at Minnesota on Sunday. 
Woolford has missed the last three games with a groin injury and Douglass has been out five games with an ankle injury. 
Caito said Woolford could have played last week but "We had everybody else healthy and we had the luxury of waiting another week. Woolford and Douglass will start practicing this week." 
When the Bears start practic­ing Wednesday, they will use their new indoor facility in nearby Waukegan for the first time. That's to prepare the team for its first game on arti­ficial turf this season. Their only other game on artificial turf will be at Detroit on Dec. 16. 
"I like to stay off that stuff," Ditka said. "I hate it and I don't care who knows it. The players don't like it. It should be outlawed." 
Back in 1985 when the Bears went all the way and won the Super Bowl in the New Orleans Superdome, Ditka said "We were a good AstroTurf team. I don't know if this is a good AstroTurf team."

Bonds wins MVP 


named National League Most Valuable Player on Monday. 
I'ITTSBUB.Gll (API -Finally, Barry Bonds isn't just Bobby Bonds' son. ­
You might want to refer to him by his new title: National League Most Valuable Player. lie was a near unanimous choice, receiving 23 of a possible 24 first-place votes from the Baseball Writers of America Association after his earner year led the Pittsburgh Pirates to their first Nl. East Division title in II years. 
"I knew I was capable of this, hut thnre arn so many gn~at ballplaynrs out thPre. I didn't know if it would be this year," Bonds said Monday. "I just put it togPtlwr in tlw right year." 
In his first four major lnague sPasons, Bonds tried unsuc­enssfully to rnaeh the standards of nxr.nlllmce his famous father nchiPved while hitting 30 homers and stealing 30 bases in live diiTerent seasons. 
Now, af'tnr enjoying thn kind of season Bonds hirnsnlf wasn't sun~ he had in him, he's making otlwrs guess how much better he can get. According to l'iratns manager Jim Leyland, even an MVP can get better. 
"Barry's maturing and com­ing of age," Leyland said. "He's a hungry player and his concentration is better than it's twer been. People say he's finally playing up to his potential, but, hey, he was a pretty good player before this season. 
"Sometimes he goes off the dnep end and wastes an at-bat here or there, and if he didn't do that, he could hit 40 homers." 
That would put the 26-year­old Bonds in the 40-40 category with Jose Canseco, a class not reached even by Bonds' father. For now, Barry Bonds will have to be content being the majors' first 30-50-100 player. 
Bonds, who had never hit higher than .283, batted .301 this past season. He'd never hit more than 25 homers. but he hit 33. He'd never driven in more than 59 runs, but he did that by July 8 and finished with 
114. He'd never stolen more than 36 bases, but he stole 52 for the NL East champions. 
He hit .377 with runners in 
scoring position -an incredi­
ble figure for any player, much 
less a player whose .103 career 
average with runners in scoring 
position in late-inning situa­
tions was the lowest in base­
ball. according to the Elias 
Sports Bureau. 
"lie had a monster year," said 
Bobby Bonilla, Bonds' 
teammate and the MVP run­. nerup. 
Bonilla completed the Pirates' 
domination of the postseason 
awards. Leyland was voted the 
Manager of the Year and Doug 
Drabek (22-6) won the Cy 
Young Award. Dave Justice of 
Atlanta prevented a Pirates' 
sweep by wtnning the Rookie of 
the Year. 

The only previous time 
Pittsburgh had the MVP and Cy 
Young winner in the same sea­
son was 1960, when Dick Groat 
and Vern Law did it. The 
Pirates' last MVP was Willie 
Stargell, who shared the 1979 
award with Keith Hernandez of 
St. I,ouis. 

Bonds received 331 of a pos­
sible 336 points. Bonilla got the 
other first-place vote and 212 
points. Darryl Strawberry, 
formerly of the New York Mets 
who has since signed as a free 
agent with the Los Angeles 
Dodgers, was third with 167 
points. 

No player has ever been so 
productive in so many cate­
gories in one season -he also

"I've had that stamp on me since Day One of my career.... I didn't know if I could do it this year, but my father and (Pirates' conditioning specialist) Warren Sipe had me convinced I was invincible." 
He's also lived with a famous last name. He doesn't rank up there with Mays or McCovey in Giants' folklore, but Bobby Bonds was one of the forerun­ners of the player of the '90s ­the Cansecos, the Rickey Hendersons, the Eric Davises ­who generate runs by the home run and the way they run. 
am pleased that we won -we sure needed it. Tonight was a fight, a hard-earned victory. Last night I thought we should have held them when we had a decisive advantage in the score. 
"We're getting a little better. Still, I would like to give them credit -they worked hard on the ice. and they worked hard to raise the money to come out here. They worked hard at everything. This team gave us what we wanted -they played their hearts out, and they even had some good chances against us. I'm not just making things up. I am very critical of our performance. They had lots of breakaways and two-on-one's against the goalie on us." 
Although Schafer eyes every Irish performance with a critical mind, he was not ret­icent to give credit to his players where credit was due. 
Barry Bonds once considered his last name a curse, a cross to bear. 
"I always got tired of hearing the same questions about my father, or being called Bobby," Barry Bonds said. "I didn't want to be known just because my dad was a major leaguer. I wanted to be known for what Barry Bonds could do. 
"My father was my own worst enemy just because of the name. Now, he's my best friend." 
When Barry hit his 30th homer to join the exclusive 30­30 club that is captained by his father, the Three Rivers Stadium scoreboard carried a 
"Greg Louder had a solid game," admitted Schafer. "He started off shaky, but he made some big saves thereafter." 
In fact, Louder made 23 saves on 26 shots, including three spectacular saves which came during a UMass five-on-three power play (which the Irish killed) in the pivotal third period. 
The Irish seized a 4-3 lead with 14:29 left in the contest as Tim Utchard drilled a slap shot from just inside the blue line on the left side of the goal and into the lower right corner of the net. 
Only 15 seconds later, Irish defender Dan Sawyer was slapped with a two-minute roughing penalty, giving the Beacons a power play and a chance to tie the game. A delay of game penalty was called on Jason Konesco just 17 seconds congratulatory message from Barry's father and mother. 
"I can talk to him better than I ever could before," Barry Bonds said. "Now I want to put all those father-son hitting records so far out of sight no­body will ever be able to touch them." 
And you thought the Griffeys were baseball's only famous fa. ther-son combination. 
"My ultimate goal is .to make the Hall of Fame," Bonds said. "I don't want to do this just for one season or two seasons. I don't know if I can do that, but I do know that I can tell my kids and my grandkids someday that for six months, I was up there with the best of them." 
after the Sawyer penalty, providing UMass-Boston with a truly gift-wrapped five-on-three scoring opportunity. 
The scoring chance would have been gift-wrapped were it not for Greg Louder. 
During the five-on-three, which lasted 1:53, Louder made save after spectacular save. His first outstanding save came in a crowd of defenders and attackers, as he snared the puck from the net on a point­blank shot. Louder's next save was a picture-perfect glove save on a slap shot from nearly 20 feet in front of the net. Louder made the final save of the heroic Notre Dame stand, deflecting a slap shot wide of the net with his leg pad. 
''I'm glad we held off that five-on-three," noted Schafer, loosening his tie after the victory. "If we hadn't, that sure would have changed the complexion of the game." 
Schafer also made mention of the efforts of junior left wing Michael Curry. 
"Michael Curry has been playing well," remarked Schafer. "I can say that he has been playing well with consistency." 
Curry had two goals in the two games against UMass­Boston, raising his team­leading point total to T)ine points (six goals, three assists).

sports coverage would be a better use of that time. Tonight, for example, Hugh McGowan and Vic Lombardi will have Mike Francesa from CBS Sports, Keith Jackson of ABC Sports and Arthur Hertz, President of the Orange Bowl Committee, on the air from 8 to 
9. They will also have a live report on Irish basketball from New York. 

Shows such as this provide students interested in sports broadcasting with fantastic experience. They also give stu­dents on campus a chance to speak live with national sports figures via telephone lines, and give a very sports-oriented campus an open forum. 
In short, the possibilities for WVFI as a resource are limit­less; and it is a shame that the station has chosen such a narrow focus for itself. Although I'm not suggesting that the whole format should be strictly sports, I do think that more opportunities should be allocated to sports. Both aspiring journalists and campus sports fans would benefit if WVFI expanded its sports coverage.

Cross country finishes third 
Special to the Observer 
The Notre Dame men's cross country team ran an-outstanding race yesterday in the NCAA Championships in Knoxville, Tenn., finishing third in the nation behind Arkansas and Iowa State. 
The Irish, who came into the meet ranked fourth in the coun­try, broke into the top three for the first time since 1963. It was the highest NCAA finish ever for a Joe Piane-coached team. 
Leading Notre Dame was the same tandem that brought the team to the championships. Sophomore John Coyle and freshman Mike McWilliams fin­ished 14th and 21st respectively en route to All­America honors. 
Coyle crossed the line in 30:00, with McWilliams finish­ing at 30:16. Rounding out the Notre Dame scoring were se­niors Pat Kearns, (38th, 30:37), Ryan Cahill (50th, 30:45), and Mike O'Connor (62nd, 30:45). Jonah Koech of Iowa State won the race. 
O'Connor and Cahill, who led the Irish runners all season, were battling the flu prior to the District IV qualifying meet Nov. 10, and had not totally re­covered prior to the NCAA race. 
"This was a great meet for us," Piane said. "The outcome was terrific, but we can run better." 

.... More details will appear in tomorrow's Observer.

Campus radio station lacks sports coverage 
The men's basketball game between Notre Dame and Iowa Saturday night at the Joyce ACC offered a tremendous opportunity for campus broadcasters. The game was not telecast across campus on television (ESPN had exclusive coverage), and Notre Dame Sports Information was willing to provide WVFI a hookup. 
But WVFI Station Manager Mark Bintinger decided not to broadcast the game and instead aired some of the station's regular music coverage. His reasons for doing so are quite valid. 
"Our mission is to be an alternative music station for the Notre Dame campus," Bintinger says. "And we decided to air music based on that. After I heard that only a couple hundred people (actually 3,303) showed up for the Fordham game (last Thursday night). I figured the interest in basketball was minimal." 
Bintinger probably made the right decision in not broad­casting the game. Sports coverage is secondary-very sec­ondary-in WVFI's programming scheme. The station's sports staff is allowed its weekly show from 8 to 9 p.m. every Tuesday night, and broadcasts all of the home football games as .well as some other contests when Bintinger and his staff decrde the games are important enough. 
It may be none of my business, but I really think that a campus radio station should do more than pro~de progressi~e music programming that few students actually hsten to. WVFI rs a priceless resource at Notre Dame; it could be used to provide people who are interested in a broadcasting career with valuable experience. Instead, the station limits students' experiences to disc jockeying, which may be fun, but is a relatively unproductive use of air time. 
Now that might be a lot of fun. but it seems to me that more
