Co111111ittee, ND discuss parties 
City officials focus on issues ofoff-campus students 
By TERESA FRALISH A"ociate News Editor 
South Bend city officials and residents met with Notre Dame ollicials and students Monday to discuss concerns raised by neighbors about excessive par­tying and noise levels at off­campus student houses. 
Those at the meeting reached no formal decisions but agreed to share certain types of infor­mation and to work to increase communication among the vari­ous interested parties. 
The meeting of the South Bend Common Council's Committee on Health and Public Safety was organized by Ann Puzzello. District 4 Council rep­resentative and chair of the committee. 
Puzzello planned Thursday's meeting as an extension of meetings held previously with South Bend residents. who detailed specific complaints about parties. 
At the beginning of the meet­ing. Puzzello distributed a list of specific concerns residents had previously voiced about student parties, including noise levels. property damage and police response to loud parties. Committee members and the representatives began by addressing the list of approxi­mately 20 problems. 
Bill Kirk, Notre Dame's associ­ate vice president for student affairs. explained some of the legal restrictions the University faces in sanctioning student partiers or releasing information about penalties for specific inci­dents. 
"We cannot disclose what hap­pened to a particular student," Kirk said. 
In addition. Kirk said that reports of noisy parties often did not provide enough information for Notre Dame to investigate the complaint. 
"Sometimes we're getting reports by which we have no means to verify." Kirk said. "Quite honestly, we can't always verify the information." 
But when enough information is available linking students to specific incidents, the University can take action, Kirk said. 
"We have on several circum­stances ... when we have certain information dealt with those stu­dents pretty severely," he said.

Donnelly talks about campaign strategies 
Indiana congressional candidate addresses Saint Mary's College 
By MEGAN O'NEIL News Writer 
Indiana 2nd District congres­sional candidate Joe Donnelly spoke to the College Democrats at Saint Mary's Monday about his campaign and possible involve­ment for young people. 
A Notre Dame graduate and Notre Dame law school alumnus, Donnelly said the November elec­tion was critical, along with and the race for Indiana's 2nd District, one of the nation's clos­est. 
"This is one of the hottest races in the country." said Donnelly. "There is a 50-50 difference." 
Reflecting on the 1986 Indiana congressional election that came down to 47 votes, Donnelly emphasized the significance of every individual voter. 
"You literally could go around to two or three dorms here and talk to residents and change the outcome of that election," said Donnelly. 
The candidate urged his audi­ence to engage themselves with local politics and exercise the right to vote. 
"When I hear young people saying 'My vote doesn't count.' I shake my head because it has never counted more," he said. 
It was this sense of civic obliga­tion. said Donnelly that led him

BOARD OF GOVERNANCE 
Wilson speaks about budget cuts at SMC 
Assistant director of funding encourages students to get involved in philanthropy 
By KELLY MEEHAN 
NowsWriter 
With budget cuts plaguing the College, Saint Mary's Board of Governance invited Jude Ann Wilson, the assis­tant director of the Annual Fund, to speak at Monday night's meeting. Wilson's main objective was to have board members strive to encourage thei"r classmates to donate any amount of money to the fund. 
With tuition accounting for 80 percent of the College's funding, the other 20 percent is collected through alumni and student donations to the Annual Fund. Wilson also noted that the initiation of the Quarters Campaign began in 2002. to have cur­rent students donate to the annual fund before they graduate. The Campaign began so that students would make donating to the College a habit, and continue to do so throughout their lives. 
"It is critical for students to get involved with philanthro­py now to continue with it in the future," Wilson said. 
The Board approved to co­sponsor a trip for women's issues commissioner Katie Kelly to visit St. Kate's College in St. Paul and Minneapolis, Minn. and St. 
Ben's College in Winona, Minn. over fall break. The purpose of her visit is to see the College's women's cen­ters and ask college repre­sentatives about their goals for the centers and how they worked to achieve those goals. 
"I feel that this center is really something that will benefit the entire student body," said public relations commissioner, Ashley Thor­nburg.

Losses 
continued from page 1 
and 2003, Lelik said. While Wellesley and Barnard experi­enced the greatest enrollment stability, with five-year declines of only .7 percent and .4 percent respectively, the average decrease in the entering class size for the six remaining col­leges that lost enrollment was more than 10 percent. 
However, while Wellesley and Barnard boast the smallest loss­es, the two schools also boast the lowest admissions acceptance rates among the top 10 colleges: 47 percent and 34 percent respectively. The acceptance rate for Saint Mary's is 82 percent. 
When students apply for col­lege, the yield rate -the number of accepted students who actual­ly choose to attend a given insti­tution -is roughly 30 percent. Traditionally, Saint Mary's has had a higher yield rate -49 per­cent in fall 2003 alone. 
But this year, it was a different story. Only 36 percent of accept­ed students committed to Saint Mary's -higher than the nation­al average but lower than what Saint Mary's typically experi­ences. 
According to Director of Admissions Mary Pat Nolan, a new process the admissions department tried last year caused more applications than ever before to come in, but resulted in a much lower yield. 
Nolan said the College received 1,269 applications for the class of 2008, the most she had seen in her 21 years here at the College. "Part of [the jump] is due to a new enrollment process we tried last year called the Scholars Advanced Application Program," Nolan said. "This program sent pre-completed application forms to over 400 students." 
Since each application already had a lot of information included, students had to do less work to get their applications back to Saint Mary's. However, the mail­ing of these applications did not occur until January, making it fairly late in the game for stu­dents who were already interest­ed in other colleges. Of the 969 students accepted to Saint Mary's, only 350 committed to entering the freshman class. 
Lelik said the 36 percent yield was, therefore, to be expected. 
"While this is down from past years, it is because we received more applications and accepted more students than usual," she said. 
Nolan said a decision would be made in the next few weeks regarding whether the Scholars Advanced Application Program will continue. 
According to Lelik, admissions are also down because of the competition for students will other schools. 
"We have many students who cross apply with other schools, but many of them don't cross­apply with other schools like us," Lelik said. "They apply to big public schools like [Indiana University], Purdue, Michigan or Illinois. Or, they apply to a differ­ent school of religious affiliation like Notre Dame, DePaul or Marquette. This makes it tough because some of those schools can offer things that we can't ­and at the same time. we can show students what we can offer them that they won't be able to fmd elsewhere. There is a higher level of competitiveness among these schools." 
The U.S. has only 65 all­women's colleges and five all male colleges remaining. Lelik and Nolan said that for these institutions, fluctuations in admissions are a normal occur­rence. 
"There is going to be a little bouncing around the admissions numbers scale when dealing with colleges," Lelik said. "For exam­ple, St. Catherine's admissions are up this year, but largely because they appeal to a differ­ent crowd than we do. They appeal to a regional area, and they have weekend and evening classes to bulk up their admis­sions. We're looking at the national level, trying to appeal to people from all over." 
Lelik said despite a loss in the number of students, she feels the college will continue to grow and seek students nationally because Saint Mary's has seen these types of fluctuations before. 
"Clearly, women's colleges nationwide struggle with the realities of an increasingly com­petitive higher education market­place," Lelik said. "But in time, these fluctuations will bounce around, eventually landing up." 
On average, Nolan said, she and the admissions office work­ers send mailings to between 24,000 and 26,000 students each year who show interest in Saint Mary's. Students who receive a mailing, or check a box on the SAT or ACT saying they would like to hear from colleges inter­ested in them, are sent a com­plete set of Saint Mary's materi­als. 
While many are seniors going through the admissions process, some students start receiving these mailings early on in their high school careers. 
Saint Mary's also conducts College Board searches to match certain students who meet the College's criteria, and does a sep­arate mailing to markets that have traditionally yielded a good field of students. Saint Mary's representatives also visit high schools in 30 to 35 states and last year they conducted a cold mail­ing to see what type or response the College would get from the public.

last summer to agree to run fi.Jr the Indiana 2nd district congressional scat. 
Donnelly said running for oflice has given him the opportunity to do his duty for the country. 
"In my heart I felt I had not done my part," said Donnelly. "I came in a little after Vietnam and a little before the Persian Gulf'." 
Donnelly said that his opponent. Hepublican Chris Chocola, makes for tough competition because his well-funded campaign allows him to run many more televi­sion ads than the chal­lenger can. 
Instead. Donnelly has focused efforts on neigh­borhood walks and voter registration. The chance to meet possible future constituents. said Donnelly, has been the highlight of the cam­paign thus far and will continue until Nov. 2. 
"We will win by knock­ing on doors, handing out literature and talking to people," he said. 
Differences in cam­
paign tactics are not the 
only characteristic dis­
tinguishing him from his 
opponent, said Donnelly. 
One of the biggest dis­tinctions, the candidate said, concerns the feder­al deficit. According to Donnelly, the U.S. gov­ernment is currently $422 billion in debt, and that number would be much higher if Social Security funds were not being used to control it. 
The war in Iraq is another issue that Donnelly said is not being managed appro­priately. "We are now there, and there is no back door out," said Donnelly. "We can't cut and run ... We have to stabilize it, and get it under control and when we leave it won't be soon

Meeting 
continued from page 1 
Kirk said that off-campus students are a'iked to provide an address but the University ultimately has no way of enforcing that request. 
Jim I Iessig. South Bend Police chief, said police also faced the problem of determining who lived in which hous­es, and whether the tenants are actu­ally home. 
"The biggest problem of giving cita­tions is being able to determine who Jives there among a sea of people," Hessig said. 
Mark Kramer. the owner of Domus Properties, which rents many area houses to students, said that in some cases South Bend residents could be overreacting to student parties. Kramer also cited one report in which neighbors called police, who determined that no violations were taking place at the student house in question. 
"I think there's some overreaction going on," said Kramer. "In this par­ticular report, the officer is saying there's not a problem." 
Both Kirk and Kramer noted specif­ic actions that Domus Properties had taken to increase communication, such as hosting barbeques for stu­dents and residents and holding information sessions for students. 
"In fairness to Domus Properties, they've really tried to make some efforts to bring the community together," Kirk said. 
However, no residents attended this year's gathering, Kramer said. 
Notre Dame senior Mike Roaldi said after his house received a noise com­plaint at the beginning of the year, he and his roommates went and apolo­gized to the neighbors and distributed their phone numbers. 
"I think we all feel that the solution to the problem is more communica­tion," he said. 
However, senior Kaitlin Briscoe said her house at 113 Notre Dame Avenue was ticketed on a weekend when none of her housemates were home. 
"The neighbors complained about a party that was held and they cited our house but we weren't even involved," she said. 
Other South Bend officials dis­cussed problems with zoning regula­tions, such as the number of people allowed in houses at the same time or the how many unrelated persons could reside in the same home. 
"I have the license plates of four different individuals from four differ­ent states," said Pat McFadden, who lives at 418 East Pokagan Street. "What is so hard about it? You fJ.Je a lawsuit."

Bend, said enforcing zoning laws 
could be difficult and complicated. 
"We sent letters ahead of time 
advising of what the zoning is," she 
said. "[Enforcement] is very hard to 
d0." 
Ann-Carol Nash, a city attorney for South Bend, said it could be equally complicated to file legal charges against noise violators without very specific information. 
"We want to make sure we're pre­pared for each and every case," she said. "We want to make certain that we're going in there with a ca'ie that we're going to be solid with." 
Other residents used the meeting to voice concerns about specific prob­lems that occurred this year. 
"There was a fairly small party and they threw beer cups in our back yard," said Anne Pendle. who lives at 703 Peashway Street. 
"For four or five years they were hundreds of students," said her hus­band, Gene Pendle. 
Notre Dame student body president Adam Istvan also spoke about student government's efforts to help improve the problem. 
"On Thursday we're presenting to the [Notre Dame] Board of Trustees a report that deals with off-campus liv­ing," he said. 
Istvan also discussed the SafeBus initiative, which he said would help address the problem of students 
walking through neighborhoods and causing damage. 
Residents also expressed con­cerns about poor police response to calls about noise, but Hessig said it was not feasible to break up every noisy party. 
"You could tie up some 20 ofli­cers for some four hours." he said. 
At the meeting's end, oflicials agreed to exchange some infor­mation about zoning regulations and legal processes. 
Puzzello said further similar meetings about noisy student parties would likely not take place unless problems specilic to a certain street or area occurred. 
"There is no benefit to continu­ing to hold these meetings unless we have new information," she said. 
Puzzello said she would contin­ue to talk informally with the University and South Bend resi­dents and officials to continue improving the situation for hPr constituents.

Prime minister condemns leaders 
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip -Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qureia on Monday con­demned what he called international indiffer­ence to Palestinian suffering in the face of a broad Israeli offensive into the Gaza Strip aimed at halting rocket attacks on Israel. 
At least 67 Palestinians have been killed in the five-day offensive, making it the deadliest Israeli incursion into Gaza in more than four years of fighting. 
Nine Palestinians died Monday in northern Gaza. including four militants and a 14-year­old girl who residents said was shot as she baked bread with her mother in their garden. 
Aristide supporters threaten police 
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -Supporters of ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide wielded machetes and threatened to cut off the heads of Ilaitian police and the interim prime minister during demonstrations on Monday, part of a recent campaign that has been dubbed "Operation Baghdad." 
No violence was reported in Monday's demonstrations in the capital Port-au­Prince. But at least 14 people were killed in clashes Thursday and Friday, including three police officers who were shot to death and then beheaded. 
Tensions erupted into violence in the cap­ital last week as the country was still reel­ing from the chaotic aftermath of Tropical Storm Jeanne. The death toll from the storm's devastating floods and mudslides rose Monday to 1,870 with another 884 reported missing and most presumed dead. 
About 150 Aristide supporters demon­strated on Monday and some directed their anger at Haitian police who fired in the air to try to disperse a gathering.

Scientists, who continued to warn that the volcano could blow at any moment, stopped short of calling the steam burst an actual eruption, saying no volcanic material apparently was emitted.

Car explosions kill at least 24 
U.S. Embassy and government offices targeted by bombs, over 100 wounded 
Associated Press 
BAGHDAD -Insurgents unleashed a pair of power­ful car bombs Monday near the symbol of U.S. authori­ty in Iraq -the Green Zone, where the U.S. Embassy and key govern­ment offices are located ­and hotels occupied by hundreds of foreigners. Two other explosions brought the day's bombing toll to at least 24 dead and more than 100 wounded. 
More than three dozen car bombings since the beginning of September illustrate the militants' seeming ability to strike at will despite recent pledges by the United States and Iraq to intensify the sup­pression of insurgents, and the morale-boosting recap­ture of Samarra over the weekend. 
Defense Secretary Donald 
H. Rumsfeld said Monday he does not expect a civil war to erupt in Iraq, and pointed to the formerly insurgent-held city of Samarra as an example of success. 

"I don't think it's going to happen," Rumsfeld said in New York at the Council on Foreign Relations, when asked about the threat of civil war.

Hints of voter boom coming true 
As registration deadlines fall, voters swamp election offices in record numbers 
Associated Press 
In a glimpse of what the nation might see a month from now, people lined up at election offices and caused parking lot traffic jams as voter registration deadlines fell Monday in more than a dozen states. 
Many officials reported record numbers of new voters, some said they were overwhelmed, and allegations were already flying about fraud and the disqualification of some voters' applications. 
"They're coming in, in buckets," said Pamela Swafford, deputy director of Ohio's Hamilton County board of elections. By Monday morning, the county that includes Cincinnati had 64,045 new voter registrations on hand, more than twice the 29,178 it received four years ago. 
Across Georgia's coun­ties, Colorado's booming suburbs and in Midwestern cities, local officials were deluged. 
Traffic jammed the park­ing lot at New Jersey's Burlington County govern­ment building. In Ocean County, phones rang con­tinuously. The day for the office operator: "Good morning, Board of Elections, pleaSe hold; Good morning, Board of Elections, please hold; Good morning, Board of Elections, this is Barbara, how can I help you?" 
Residents filling out forms stood after all the 

chairs were filled, and then waited in line to drop off the forms. 
"I think it's important to help decide who runs this country," said Janis Britting of Toms River, N.J., who recently moved from another part of the state. She registered as a Democrat, but said she was still undecided between President Bush and Democrat John Kerry. 
A complete accounting of the registration figures across each state, let alone the country, won't be fin­ished for several weeks, as officials continue to accept postmarked registration forms. Other states' dead­lines fall later this week and month. 
"If you walk into our mail room, we have stacks and stacks of new forms coming in," said Kara Sinkule, spokeswoman for Georgia Secretary of State Cathy Cox, who oversees elections. "It's a great problem to have." 
Her state is on pace to see a 50 percent increase in new voters for this pres­idential election compared to 2000. In the past year, 371,376 new voters regis­tered, with 87,110 new voters in September alone. And the surge grew even bigger in the first few days of October. 
Both the Democrats and the Republicans have poured resources into reg­istering voters, spurred by the near deadlock of the 2000 presidential race and polls that predict another tight election this year.

Court upholds do-not-call registry 
WASHINGTON -The Supreme Court turned away a challenge Monday to the fed­eral do-not-call registry, ending telemar­keters' bid to invoke free-speech arguments to get the popular ban on unwanted phone solicitations thrown out. 
The court, without comment, let stand a lOth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision that upheld the registry of more than 64 mil­lion phone numbers as a reasonable govern­ment attempt to safeguard personal privacy and reduce telemarketing abuse. 
Under the 2003 federal law, businesses face fines of up to $11,000 if they call people who sign up for the registry -unless they have recently done business with them. Charities, pollsters and callers on behalf of politicians, however, are exempt. 
PeopleSoft chief executive fired 
WILMINGTON, Del. -PeopleSoft Inc.'s board fired Craig Conway as its chief execu­tive after hearing him explain why he made a misleading statement about the business software maker's ability to close sales while fighting rival Oracle Corp.'s $7.7 billion takeover bid. 
Kicking off a two-week trial over PeopleSoft's anti-takeover defenses, compa­ny director Steven Goldby testified Monday that concerns about Conway's "situational ethics" contributed to the surprise decision to fire him late last week. 

Factory orders drop unexpectedly 
WASHINGTON -Orders placed with U.S. factories fell for the first time in four months, the Commerce Department said Monday, with demand dropping sharply for commercial airplanes and parts. 
Factory orders declined by 0.1 percent in August, following an increase of 1. 7 percent in July. August's drop was the first since April, when orders declined by 1.1 percent. 
Economists had expected an August increase of about 0.3 percent. 
Orders for durable goods -costly manu­factured items expected to last at least three years -fell by 0.3 percent. That was better than a previous estimate of a 0.5 percent drop. 




U.S. launches trade crackdown 
Bush administration announces national campaign against phony products 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The. Bush administration announced a national crack­down Monday on thefts of intellectual property and sales of fake designer brands and other counter­feit products. 
Senior administration offi­cials said the program, called Strategy Targeting Organized Piracy, was aimed at breaking up crimi­nal networks that traffic in phony goods, stopping imports of such fakes at the borders and helping U.S. businesses enforce their property rights overseas. The departments of Commerce, Homeland Security and Justice will participate. 
The administration said bogus products, from airline and automotive parts to pirated music and movie discs, account for up to 7 percent of global trade. Commerce Secretary Donald Evans cited complaints by the Zippo Manufacturing Co. in Bradford, Pa., that cheap international knockoffs cost the company one lost job for every 20,000 sales lost to fake lighters.

Supreme Court sidesteps dispute 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -MasterCard and Visa no longer can block banks from issuing credit cards from competitors after the Supreme Court declined to hear their appeal Monday. 
Banks that issued MasterCard and Visa credit cards had been barred from also offering credit cards from other companies, such as Discover and American Express. 
The Bush administration argued in court filings that removing the restriction would encourage com­petition and lead to more choices and, possibly, lower interest rates for consumers. 
The administration had won in district court and the New York­based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which found the restric­tion was anticompetitive. 
About 20,000 banks issue cards only through Visa and MasterCard. 
American Express has been try­ing to persuade banks to issue its cards. Under the contested rules, banks would have to give up Visa and MasterCard cards to do that, and no U.S. bank has agreed, the court was told. 
American Express and Discover have been issuing cards directly to individuals, although some foreign banks issue American Express cards. 
After the court's announcement, MBNA said that it would begin issu­ing American Express-branded credit cards. 
"Today's news marks a funda­mental change in the U.S. credit card industry and we believe it will lead to better value and greater choice for consumers," said Ken Chenault, chairman and CEO of American Express. 
Daniel Tarman, senior vice presi­dent of Visa USA, said that American Express is "accepted at millions fewer merchant locations than Visa worldwide" and that most consumers who want those cards already have them. "Our focus remains on competing for bank, merchant and cardholder business everyday," he said. 
David Nelms, chairman and CEO of Discover Financial Services, said the company has been in "advanced discussions" with poten­tial partners and would move ahead with new partnerships that would be good for customers. 
Roy Englert, one of the attorneys for MasterCard, wrote in a Supreme Court filing that con­sumers have gotten better quality, prices and choices with the regula­tions in place. 
He said that Visa and MasterCard, like competitors in other industries, have a joint ven­ture to help customers. He com­pared it to small businesses setting up cooperatives to get supplies at the best rate. · 
Bush administration lawyer Paul Clement told justices in a filing that Visa and MasterCard account for 7 3 percent of general credit card charges. He said the two dominant card networks block "every com­petitively significant bank in the country from dealing with networks they do not control." 
The cases are VISA U.S.A. Inc. v United States, 03-1521, and MasterCard International Inc. v. United States, 03-1532.

An1erican scientists avvarded Nobel Prize 
Columbia University professor and cancer researcher win for illuminating sense ofsmell 

Associated Press 
MOJAVE, Calif.-A stout, star­spangled rocket plane broke through the Earth's atmosphere to the edge of space Monday for the second time in five days, capturing a $10 million prize aimed at opening the final fron­tier to tourists. 
The privately built SpaceShipOne took off under­neath the belly of a mother plane that carried it about nine miles over the Mojave Desert. From there. SpaceShipOne fired its engine and streaked skyward at about three times the speed of sound on a half-hour flight that took it more than 62 miles high, generally considered the point where space begins. 
SpaceShipOne-with test pilot Brian Binnie at the controls ­then glided safely back to Earth. 

"This is the true frontier of transportation," said Marion C. Blakey. head of the Federal Aviation Administration, who stood near the runway to watch the flight. "It feels a little bit like Kitty Hawk must have." 
Binnie called it a "fantastic experience" -especially the sight of Earth from space. "There is darkness outside the windows," he said. "It's contrast­ed starkly by the bright pearl that is the greater California area, which is the view from up there." 
The reward for the achieve­ment is the $10 million Ansari X Prize, created in 1996 to kick­start the development of private­ly built rocket ships that could make spaceflight available to the public. 
To win the prize. a spacecraft capable of carrying three people had to make two !lights to an altitude just over 62 miles within two weeks. The goal was to show that the rocket could go back and forth like a spaceliner. 
About an hour after the space­ship landed, X Prize founder Peter Diamandis said the alti­tude was official, and declared SpaceShipOne's team the win­ner. 
X Prize chief judge Rick Searfoss said the spacecraft reached a height of 367.442 feet and speeds of Mach 3.09 during ascent and Mach 3.26 on the way down. 
During the post-flight news conference, SpaeeShipOne designer Burt Rutan took a few shots at the traditional aero­space community.

Two Americans won the 
Nobel Prize in medicine 
Monday for discovering how 
pnoplr. can n~eognize an esti­
maltHI 10,000 odors, from 
spoilt~d meat to a lover's per­
funw. 
Dr. Hichard Axel, 58, of 
Columbia Univnrsity and 
Linda B. Buck, 57, of the 
Fred llu tchinson Cancnr 
Hesearch Center in Seattle 
revealed odor-sensing pro­
teins in th11 nose and traced 
how they send their informa­
tion to the brain. 
The Nobel Assembly at the 
Karolinska Institute in 
Stockholm said it chose the 
pair for the $1.3 million prize 
not because of any practical 
payoff from the ·work, but 
simply because they 
enhanced understanding of 
"the most enigmatic of our 
SCnSilS." 
For two sci en lists to single­
handedly map one of the 
major human senses is 
unique in the history or sci­
ence, Nobel ass11mbly chair­
man Goeran Hansson said. 
"It's pretty amazing to be able to sit here in the 21st century and reward discover­ies that explain one of the human senses," he said. 
Buck said she had not even known she was under consid­eration. "People have said things like, 'You should win tht~ Nobel Prize,"' she said. "I feel very honored, of course." 
Axel said sharing the prize with Buck was "a joy and a deep honor.... I'm very sur­prised and very happy." lie also said that the work might ultimattdy help scientists develop better insect repel­lants to keep away mosqui­toes that transmit malaria, for example. 
In I !JY1, Axel and Buck jointly reported discovering a large family or genes devoted to producing different odor­sensing proteins, called recnptors, in the nose. Before that. scientists could only guess at how many different mceptors were needed to dis­tinguish smells in the envi­ronment. 
Scientists now know that peopln have some 350 to 400 typPs of odor receptors. each of which can detect only a limited 11urnber of odors. 
When a person sniffs per­fume or fine wine, for exam­
ple, a mix of different types 
of molecules flows over the 
receptors in the back of the 
nose. That activates an array 
of the receptors, but only 
those primed to respond to 
those particular molecules. 
Tlw brain notes which recep­
tors are activated, and inter­
prets this pattern as the 
smell. 

Since any given receptor 
can participate in more than 
one pattern, "you might have 
a rose and a skunk being rec­
ognized by some of the same 
receptors," Buck said. 

Axel and Buck, who worked 
independently following their 
1991 paper, went on to show 
that only one kind of receptor 
appears on each of the 5 mil­
lion or so odor-sensing nerve 
cells in the nose, which was a 
surprise. They also showed 
how these nerve cells are 
wired into the brain. 

The Nobel assembly said that it is still unclear what the medical and scientific implications of the discover­ies will be, but that the work could affect areas as diverse as psychology -to explain why scents often remind us of childhood -and cooking. since scent and taste are intertwined. 
"It's possible, I guess. that someone down the road could use this knowledge to cook up something really delicious," Hansson said. "But I think that's pretty far in the future." 
Last year's medicine prize winners were Briton Sir Peter Mansfield and American Paul C. Lauterbur for discoveries that led to the development of MRI, now widely used by doctors to get a detailed, 3-D look into their patients' bodies. 
The award for medicine opens a week of Nobel Prizes that culminates Oct. 11 with the economics prize. The peace prizn. the only one besto.wed in Norway, will be announced Oct. 8. The physics award will be announced Tuesday and the chemistry prize will be announced Wednesday in the Swedish capital. 
A date for the Nobel Prize in literature has not yet been set by the Swedish Academy. but is likely to fall on Thursday. Nobel watchers said.

CAMPAIGN NEWS Bush says Kerry's stands are 
dangerous for global peace 
CLIVE, Iowa -President Bush said Monday that rival John Kerry's foreign poli­cy stands "are dangerous for world peace," leveling some of his harshest criticism of the campaign during a trip to an important battleground state. Bush also signed tax relief legislation for 94 million Americans and hit Kerry on that issue, too. 
Labeling Kerry a tax-and-spend liberal, Bush told over a thousand campaign sup­porters. ''I've lowered taxes and my oppo­nent wants to raise taxes." 
He-lighting last week's TV debate on Iraq, in which polls suggest Bush lost ground to Kerry, the president said. "The policies of my opponent are dangerous for world peace. If they were implemented they would make this world not more peaceful but morr dangerous." 
The Kerry campaign answered back, "If Ceorgc Bush thinks John Kerry's plans to strengthen the military, build alliances and implement the 9/11 Commission's intelli­gence reforms will make the world a more dangerous place, he's even more detached from reality than he demonstrated at the debate the other night." 
Kerry promotes cell research 
!lAMPTON, N.H.-John Kerry on Monday accused President Bush of restricting poten­tially lifesaving stem cell research because of "extreme right-wing ideology" and underscored his own strong support for research that polls show has widespread backing. 
The Democratic senator spoke in a high school gymnasium alongside actor Michael 
J. Fox. who has Parkinson's disease, and others who told emotional stories how dis­ease have impacted their lives. They urged Kerry's election because of the stem cell issue. 
"I will stop at nothing to get stem cell research moving forward in this country," Kerry said. He said Bush had dismissed the judgment of scientists who say embryonic stem cell research could eventually lead to disease cures. 
"This underscores, in my judgment, the perils of having a president who turns his back on science in favor of ideology, and as a result, abandons millions of Americans' hopes," Kerry said. 
While in Philadelphia, Kerry continued his effort to shore up black support by speaking to clergy from black churches from several states. He won applause when he told them, "If you make me president of the United States, I will do my best to even do better than Bill Clinton did to make sure the gov­ernment of the United States looks like the face of America." 
Three years ago, Bush limited federal funding of embryonic stem cell research to the 78 stem cell lines in existence. 
Kerry called Bush's action "a far-reaching ban on federal funding for stem cell research," a statement the president's cam­paign said wasn't true. 
Bush spokesman Steve Schmidt said Kerry was "trying to mislead the American people by implying a ban that doesn't exist."

HAVERTOWN, Pa. -Put Barbara White down as undecided in the race for the White House. 
The economy makes me afraid of Bush, but I'm scared of Kerry because of security," she says, standing in the doorway of her home outside Philadelphia. 
The mother of three sons and employed in her hus­band's business, the 44-year­old White says she sided with Democrat Al Gore four years ago. The vote she casts this year -in suburbs that the former vice president carried on his way to a statewide vic­tory -will help determine whether Sen. John Kerry holds Pennsylvania or President Bush prevails this time. 
Numerous polls point to a close finish, and in surveys taken before last week's debate, Bush is running bet­ter in the suburbs than four years ago. "That's because of the effective job Republicans did on national security and terrorism," Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell said recently. 
The votes of women like White aren't all that matter in the nation's sixth most populous state -a land of 21 electoral votes, tight polls, frequent visits by both candi­dates, nonstop television ads and an army of organizers, paid and volunteer. 
Republicans hunt new vot­ers statewide in Bush's con­servative, churchgoing base, and one poll underscores the reason. Nearly one-quarter of his supporters listed fami­ly and moral issues as uppermost in their minds. 
Democrats hope to strengthen their margins in Philadelphia. John Street, the city's black mayor, won a new term last year after the independent group America Coming Together, or ACT, helped register more than 80,000 new voters in a rehearsal for the presidential campaign. 
Republicans look to whittle their customary deficits around Pittsburgh, where suburban shopping malls sit on land once occupied by steel mills. 
Democrats aim to build on Gore's heavy vote totals around Wilkes-Barre and Scranton -hoping that job losses rather than anti-abor­tion sentiment will determine voting patterns. 
Republicans talk of stress­ing a need to limit malprac­tice awards in southeastern Pennsylvania, citing reports of physicians are leaving the area because of a plague of baseless lawsuits. 
Rendell and others say Kerry's support for abortion rights, a ban on certain semiautomatic weapons and expanded federal support for stem cell research can appeal to moderate women in the Philadelphia suburbs. 
Throughout the state, an organizational war has raged for months, and limit­ed evidence suggests an advantage for Bush's cam­paign. 
In one recent ABC poll of Pennsylvania voters, 21 per­cent reported having been contacted in person or by phone by the president's campaign. Only 14 percent said they had heard from Kerry's. 
"I was told to build the largest grass-roots campaign in the history of Pennsylvania politics," said Guy Ciarrocchi, executive director of the state Bush­Cheney campaign. Asked how he has made out, he straightened a few of the neatly arranged small stacks of papers on his desk. 
"Every precinct in Pennsylvania has someone who is responsible for it," Ciarrocchi said. All 9,530 of them. 
"Everyone has a theory" to overcome Bush's 200,000 vote deficit of four years ago, concentrating on one group or another, he said. 
Democrats say that in fact, Bush's strategy is simple. 
"Republicans are trying to register every living Christian," said Tony Podesta, who ran President Clinton's Pennsylvania cam­paign in 1996 and is back for Kerry this year. 
Unlike Bush, Kerry is rely­ing to a large extent on ACT and other anti-Bush allies to do the labor-intensive orga­nizational work.

+The truth on 'town hall' events + Bush leads polls + Battling in Ohio 
WASHINGTON -President Bush and Sen. John Kerry talk often about the needs and ambitions of ordinary people, but neither encounters many along a campaign trail defined by the exquisitely stage-managed photo op and fortified by Secret Service agents. 
Despite almost daily campaign events styled as "town hall" ses­sions with voters, such as the candidates held Monday, neither the Republican incumbent nor the Democratic challenger has much recent experience with the relatively unscripted town-hall format of their next debate on Friday. 
What the campaigns call town-hall events, or informal, shirt­sleeve bull sessions, are really almost as staged as traditional speeches or whoop-and-holler rallies. 
The crowds almost always range from friendly to adoring. Bush events are ticket-only, and the tickets are usually passed out by the Bush campaign or other supporters. Kerry sometimes uses tickets. sometimes not. Still, supporters seem to easily outnumber undecided voters or opponents at Kerry town-hall sessions. 
For both, the questions are almost always softballs. 

CLEVELAND -In the key presidential battleground of Ohio, the candidates proved during the weekend they won't take the state's traditional Democratic strongholds for granted. 
Within 72 hours of their first debate, President Bush and Democratic challenger John Kerry sought to energize support in northeast Ohio. The only vice presidential debate between Dick Cheney and John Edwards is Tuesday night at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. 
Bush attended a campaign rally in Cuyahoga Falls on Saturday. Kerry conducted a talk show-style meeting in Austintown Fitch High School's gym on Sunday before going to a black church in Cleveland, where three local pastors and the Rev. Jesse Jackson helped fire up the congregation. 
No Republican has won the presidency without Ohio. With 20 electoral votes at stake, both sides have been campaigning in Ohio for more than a year. There have been near-weekly visits and both have thousands of volunteers covering the state.

Tradition-not: the Vice Presidential debates 
We have become so accustomed to watching presidential debates every four years that it may be hard to believe that, for most of American history, they didn't exist. In the 19th century, politicians con­sidered it undignified 
to campaign openly for Susan Ohmer 
public office, and instead sent surro-Guest Column gates to present their 
views to the public. The famous Abraham Lincoln-Stephen Douglas debates that launched Lincoln's career took place during the 1858 Illinois Senate race, not during a presidential election. In the 20th century, no debates occurred until the 1948 and 1956 elec­tions, and they involved candidates in the Republican and Democratic primar­ies, not each party's final nominees. Not until 1960, with the famous John F. Kennedy-Richard Nixon debates, could Americans watch the parties' formal nominees argue their positions. Everyone knows that the Kennedy-Nixon match-up was the first presidential debate to be televised, but they were also in fact, the first presidential debates in 
U.S. history. 
And they did not establish a trend. The two parties' nominees wouldn't debate again for another sixteen years, in part because of Nixon's experiences in the 1960 encounter. It wasn't until 1976, when Gerald Ford met Jimmy Carter in an exchange that also involved an infa­mous remark about Poland that presi­dential debates reappeared in the elec­tion cycle. Since then they've become an accepted part of the political process, though candidates renegotiate the terms each time. What we think of as an inte­gral part of our democratic process, then, has a tradition going back about forty years, and not even continuously at 
that. The "tradition" of vice presidential 
debates is even less firmly rooted. The 
first encounter between the parties' 
nominees for this position also 
occurred in 1976, when 

Democrat Walter Mondale 
debated Republican 
Robert Dole. There 
were no vice presi­
dential debates in 
1980,butthey 
reappeared in 
1984, when 
George H.W. 
Bush debated 
Geraldine 
Ferraro in an 
encounter that 
was equally 
memorable 
for breaking 
gender barri­
ers. This tradi­
tion ofvice 
presidential 
debates has 
existed continu­
ously for only 
twenty years ­
the age of many 

Notre Dame students. Why should we care about the vice presiden­tial debates? We don't elect vice-presidents directly, after all; they are attached to the ticket and we don't have the opportunity to deselect them. Of course, if the president dies in office, they become our next leader, so it's useful to have a sense of their personalities and beliefs. Ronald Reagan was 73 years old in 1984, so vot­ers may have had a more pressing inter­est in knowing who could replace him, 
but age is not an issue in this campaign. Vice presidents also attract attention because of the extra experience and per­spective they add to a ticket. During the 
2000 election, George W. Bush presented Dick Cheney as a man whose long experi­ence in government ­including a stint as White House Chief of Staff under Ford and Secretary of Defense in his father's cabinet 
-would add heft to his administration. 
Sen. John Kerry chose Sen. John Edwards for similar rea­sons of bal­ance: to widen 
his appeal to various demo­graphic groups. 
Both Kerry and 
George W. Bush acknowledge that one person can't do 
everything and that the vice-president extends and enhances the range of skills a presi­dent can offer. 

The role of vice president is one that is still being defined. Vice presidents can say things the president can't, such as when Cheney implied that a vote for Kerry could trigger another terrorist attack. Vice presidents can be warmer, more in touch with the public, a function that Edwards seems to fulfill for Kerry. They can extend a candidate's political base, as Lyndon Johnson did for Kennedy by appealing to Southern vot­ers. Kennedy nearly lost his party's nom­ination because of his support for civil rights, but appointing the Texan Johnson appeased the Democrat's southern base. They can reassure particular segments of the party that the President shares its views, while he strives to appear more moderate, as Cheney does in speaking to evangelical groups. 
The debate tonight between Cheney and Edwards brings together two men of established rhetorical skills and very dif­ferent political personas. Edwards, the man who worked his way up the socioe­conomic ladder and earned his political reputation and millions of dollars as a trial lawyer, vs. Cheney, the consummate government administrator and master of innuendo and suggestion. In contrast to the uneven rhetorical display of last week's presidential debate, this one promises to be a more equal match of communication skills. Will they move us through emotion, or argue with logic? Will one man lose his temper and reveal a hidden side, or will each remain in command of himself and his words? 
Whatever the outcome, we can take pride in knowing that we are helping to continue what is still a relatively new "tradition" in American politics.

Seeing beyond the 'spin' 
It truly is a shame when a decision comes down to Sen. John Kerry wind­surfing across your television screen, or Michael Moore's depictions of President George W. Bush. I even have this great picture of Kerry dropping a football Tom Rippinger like a girl. but we won't go there Confessions of today. Negative a Campus campaign ads are Conservative wrong and I think Katie and I agree with that. Scaring old people into saying Republicans will throw away their Social Security, or scaring others into thinking Kerry will hand the country over to the terrorists are simply not true assertions. Assuming we all agree these attack ads are wrong, which I think we do, who can undecided voters trust to give them unbiased information? Instead of drib­bling on about how sad politics have become, I'd like to tell you what you should do to fmd unbiased information. 
Today's column was a great opportu­nity for me to take a step back and put myself in the shoes of the undecided voter. First of all I'll turn off my daily dose of Fox News, CNN and the Internet wires I receive from various Washington think tanks. All of these are interested sources that have some sort of agenda behind them, regardless of whether or not it conforms to your viewpoint. Political parties, think tanks, 527's and media outlets are all biased. Money, ratings and power plays are what drive any of the organizations involved in the election. 
With that being said, I'll share an experience I had with a great professor during the Washington Semester Program for our Lobbying and Influence Group class. Professor Steve Billet was a former lobbyist for AT&T and director of external programs for the George Washington University School of Political Management. The class taught us a great deal about how things really work in Washington, straight from the mouth of a "no-bull old school Southern Democrat" who wanted to shoot straight with us to teach us a few things about politics. 
The class was on lobbying, which is actually quite useful in understanding the electoral rhetoric, because in effect both candidates are lobbying for your vote. Busy person that you are, you cannot sit down and read the Patriot Act, the Sept. 11 report and "Plan of Attack" by Bob Woodward to inform your vote. Since both parties know this, the most effective tool to mobilize your support is fear. Hence the slogans "Help is on the Way," "Keeping America Safe" or, my personal favorite, "Vote or Die." When push comes to shove, lobbyists use this force in the opposite direction to influence legislation. If factory A in district B closes because of policy C, then that will be costing a congressman possible votes and campaign money in elections. 
Staying fair to the reality of the pro­fession, personal relationships are much more effective for lobbyists, but push comes to shove scenarios can begin to resemble the viciousness of the close election we now face. Our last class project was to do a paper on an interest group that lobbies or spends money promoting an agenda in Washington. We were each assigned to do interviews with the various organi­zations. For larger more impersonal organizations above and beyond the effectiveness of personal interviews, the most effective tool in determining the motives of these organizations in Washington was tracking their contrib­utors. This was possible through a handy Web sites like www.opense­crets.org or www.fec.gov. 
Federal election laws have become very strict as far as reporting the sources of campaign funds. Along with the tool of the Internet, the average voter has an amazing tool to sidetrack the rhetoric of both sides. These are tools that never would have been acces­sible to the general voter as recently as the early nineties. 
If you haven't made up your mind yet, please don't do it based on something you see on TV. You can use the Internet to do your homework on the 527's behind the vicious ads and who is behind them. At the same time, you can get a picture of what key industries support each candidate. Usually money is a more trustworthy measure of human intentions than word alone. You even can do fun things like see how much money Alec Baldwin or Tom Hanks gave to Kerry/Edwards 2004. If our class could determine the true intentions of complex Washington advo­cacy organizations by following the money trail, average Internet-savvy Notre Dame students should easily be able to see the interests of each party. If you can't do all that, you can read Katie and me battle out the issues every Tuesday until Election Day.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Heckling is to be expected 
Section T22, Row 1, Seat 9. That's where I'll be at the USC football game Nov. 27. And guess where that is? It's the front row of the USC sen­ior student section. And boy do I plan to get pummeled. Even females are not spared when seated in the student section at an opposing team's stadium. However, I was not and will never be "outclassed." Call me a football mar­tyr, but there is a certain amount of abuse to be suffered, and dare I say expected, when attend­ing an away game in a bright green shirt in the opposing side's most hostile section. I learned this well, as many fans came back from Purdue's game last year with bruises from, you guessed it, beer cans. I will be grateful to only receive a baptism via Coke at the USC game. 
A certain amount of common sense is neces­sary to survive a game in the enemy territory unharmed and those who are not afforded it get sucked into the karmic circle. Though a few students at Notre Dame may have sunk to the level of offending or even harming Purdue stu­dents at this weekend's game, I can assure everyone that it is not near the torture we suf­fer when traveling to other stadiums. To gener­alize Notre Dame by the actions of one hard guy is unfair. Furthermore, to say that other schools potentially outclass Notre Dame is unfounded. There is a certain amount of con­tainment that goes with traveling that is sensi­ble and polite. I'm sure USC will not want to hear me chanting "We are NO" as the number one football team in the nation faces being number two yet again.

DVD REVIEW 


Humor shines in scheming high school antics 
By EMILY IAROCCI Scene Critic 
Tlw Saturday Night Live cast mem­bers and alums have done it again ­"Mean Girls" is hysterical. 
Wh1~n the previews first canw out for the movi1~. it appeared to be another typical te1mage movie full of mindless humor. hut upon actually watching it, !lllll comes to find that the humor is morn carnf'ully crafted in this film. Tina Fey, a current nwmber of the SNL cast and LIH show's head writer. takes full writing credits for tlw screenplay. Those who hav1~ watched her on SNL are familiar with lwr witty. sarcastic humor. She Prnploys lwr particular br1'1~d of' humor in th<~ scn~enplay. and manages to turn a possible dud of a movi1~. into a V<~ry PnjoyabiP l'ilm. Fey did haw some lwlp. hovvever. from her f'Pllow east mPmbers. such as Lindsay l.ohan. Hadwl McAdams (new. young it girls of llollywood). Tim Meadows. Ana c;asteyer. Amy l'oPhlPr (two SNl. alums and a curTPnt cast nwmber). and Lacey ChabPrt (of "!'arty of Five" fanwl. 
"MPan Girls" is about thn stereotypi­cal "popular girls" in high school. Cady Heron (Lohan) is a junior who has spent most of her life in Africa with her zoologist parents. She has been home­schooled up until this point in her life. when she is finally thrust into a public high school. Cady has no idea what she is up against. In the simplest of terms. high school girls. are mean. Boys have no idea what it is like to be a girl in middle school and high school. Everything is a competition. and for some reason, the cool girls, are gener­ally the meanest girls in school. Cady is clueless because she has never had to interact with kids her own age in social situations. 
On her second day of school she has an encounter with the "Plastics," the cool girls at North Shore lligh. They decide that sl111 is pretty enough to hang out with thm~ and invites her to be tlwir friend. The other kids Cady has already befriended. Janis and Damian. the art freaks, convince her to hang out with the "Plastics" just so they can hear about all the awful things the girls say and do. Eventually, Hegina (McAdams). the head of the "Plastics" crosses Cady by stealing the 
boy she has a crush on. Then Cady. Janis, and Damian decide to try and ruin Hegina's popu­larity, which in high school is life. 
The rest of the film depicts all the scheming Cady, Janis and Damian do to bring Hegina to her demise. Watch the movie if you want to know the rest. it is well worth it. 
department die and are injured. 
"Ladder 49" is not an enjoyable film. However, it will be seen by many and has received good reviews. Behind the cheesy lines and cliche characters. there are real men, women and their families who are heroic in their every­day life. "Ladder 49" pays tribute to this fact throughout showing the truly accurate life of a fireman. his family and his friends. Brilliant screenwriting or directing are not the aspects that makes this !ilm moving -it is the true story that the makers already had to work with, taken directly from the lives of real heroes who live in our midst. "Ladder 49" would be nothing without the story provided of the brave fire­fighters working everyday that pulls on the heartstrings and the tear ducts of all members of the audience.

The DVD from Paramount Pictures is fully loaded with special features. There is a large section of commentary from the cast and crewmembers. which includes scenes from the movie. Another part of the commentary pre­sented is an interview with Rosalind Wiseman. the author of "Queen Bees & Wannabes." the book on which the movie is based. Wiseman's book is actually more psychologically driven and was written in order to advise par­ents and girls how to survive adoles­cence. The DVD also includes an inter­view with the costume designer. who describes how she put together the out­fits for the characters, and explains how vision and grasp of characteriza­tion is necessary to do a good job cos­tuming the cast.

icate his life entirely to his infant daugh­ter. 
Seven years later, and Ollie is still liv­ing in Highlands, N.J. with his Pop (George Carlin). and young daughter Gertie (Haque! Castro). Reduced to working as a blue-collar street worker, the dream of returning to his former life complete with parties, celebrities and influence never escapes him. Once again, he is forced to face the decision of moving back to the city to recover his broken career, or remain in the family oriented life style he has been living. 
Maya (Liv Tyler) is the amusingly hon· est, would be girlfriend of Ollie. She forces Ollie to realize all that he under­estimates in his life. Together, the actors do a great job at emphasizing the movie's heartfelt theme of acceptance and appreciation of the priorities in life. Even though Ollie is emotionally pres­sured into sacrificing his entertainment dream job, his dedication to his family

When released in 1971, "THX 1138" was light-years ahead of any film of its time. It came during a period when the old studio system of Hollywood was failing and the new generation of young, advPnturous filmmakers was taking over. Names like Scorsese, Coppola, Spielberg and Lucas were just beginni~g to be passed around in film circles and it was this film, the first to come out of Francis Ford Coppola's production company American Zoetrope, that put these new filmmak­ers on the map. 
Directed by George Lucas and pro­duced Francis Ford Coppola, this tale follows a man living in a future that has outlawed emotion, sex, and even love. Robert Duvall plays the character named THX 1138, a factory worker who makes the robotic policeman that oversee the futuristic society of the film. His living partner, LUI-I 3417 (Maggie McOmie), alters his drug regi­men and THX 1138 begins to feel emo­tion. Eventually he and LUI-I 3417, who fall in love, plot an escape which suf­fers though many hardships as they fight the "Big Brother" that is present everywhere in the guise of the mechan­ical policemen and cameras that patrol

Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez reunite on the big screen in "Jersey (;irl." The reunion of the couple is not as painful as you might expect. In fact, tlwir collaboration is reasonably brief. 
Lopez and Aff1eck play Gertrude ·and OlliP, eager newlyweds. Tragedy takes tlw place of elation when Gertrude (Lopez) dies during thi birth of their much anticipated baby girl. Gertie. Ollie (Aflkck), an obsessively, career driven music publicist. is put in the tight pn·diranwnt of caring for his newborn and Pxecuting his high powered, high profi!P job all at once. 
An off-the-cuff remark made about his client. Will Smith. "the Fresh Prince" at a lwctic press conferr~nce leaves him jobl!~ss, and on his way back to the New Jersey suburbs. Ollie vows, then. to ded­every level of society. THX 1138 becomes more and more resolved in escape throughout the film, meeting the outcasts of society as he is thrown into a permanent hold for the people who choose not to conform to the stan­dards that "Big Brother" has set out. He is attacked by the animals outside of the antiseptically clean city as he escapes and entangles himself in a very suspenseful car chase. 
The story of this film is but the visu­als are where this film stands out. The design of this film is Lucas at his best. The futuristic city is devoid of color as are the ubiquitous white jumpsuits that the citizens wear. At times this creates the very unusual effect of floating heads as the white uniforms blend in with the white walls of the city. The police are mechanical but they possess a human quality that is very unnerving. These robots also possess a single­mindedness making them the perfect law enforcement as they will follow their orders out without question. This film is also almost completely devoid of African American characters. There are a few but for the most part Lucas's futuristic society contains only Caucasians. This choice in casting com­pounds on the oneness and lack of indi­viduality of the society presented. 
This DVD was released as a special 
edition director's cut including two discs. The first disc con­tains the original feature film released in 1971 with some additional footage that Lucas was unable to place in the film due to the restraints of special effects in 1971. The feature film is presented in the original widescreen 2.35:1 ratio, keeping what Lucas intended for his audi­ences to see. The second disc contains two documentaries, Lucas's student film "Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB" (of which THX 1138 is based on), and the original theatrical trailers for "THX 1138." The most fascinating part of the extras comes in the documen­tary, "A Legacy of Filmmakers: The Early Years of American Zoetrope." This documentary recounts the actions of a group of upstart film students who graduated in the late 1960's. It explains how Coppola, Lucas, Martin Scorsese and others rebelled against the old guard of studio filmmakers and how they changed the face of American cinema. 
This is an excellent film that received very little attention at its original release. It is a blessing to generations that Lucas decided to release it in the way they he wanted to release it. 
This film pushed audiences to the limits and was the first film to be released by American Zoetrope. The legacy of a few, brilliant, and upstart filmmakers will forever be immortal­ized in this release.

right humor shines throughout the movie. In fact, a few quick-witted ran­dom comments throughout the movie, border questioning on whether or not the movie is ideal for family viewing. 
Movie viewers will be impressed with the acting ability of young Raquel Castro. She plays the role of Ollie's adorably precocious daughter, Gertie, and steals the show with her undeniable adeptness at the role. This movie is defi­nitely one which will exceed expecta­tions. 
Bottom line -do not let your J.Lo grudge prevent you from checking out this genuinely good movie.

Associated Press 
BALTIMORE -Winless no more, the Kansas City Chiefs rendered the Baltimore Ravens defense­less with an almost unimaginable display of ball control and patience. 
Priest Holmes ran for 133 yards and two touch­downs, and the Chiefs wore down the highly touted Baltimore defense in a 27­24 victory Monday night. 
Trent Green went 21-for­31 for 223 yards to help Kansas City (1-3) to its first win since Dec. 28. After going 13-3 a year ago, the Chiefs were off to their worst start since 1980. 
Through three quarters, Kansas City had 22 first downs compared to four for the Ravens and a 361­126 advantage in yardage. A 1-yard touchdown run by Holmes on the first play of the fourth quarter put the Chiefs up 27-17. and that proved to be enough to end the Ravens' seven-game home winning streak. 
Holmes, who played for Baltimore from 1997-2000, became the first player to run for 100 yards against the Ravens in 10 games. He carried 33 times, 22 in the first half. 
After Baltimore (2·2) closed to 27-24 on a 1-yard touchdown run by Jamal Lewis with 9:14 to go, the Chiefs methodically moved downfield in seven plays before a punt left the Ravens at their own 14 with 5:50 left. 
Baltimore went nowhere, but got the ball back on its own 27 with 2:33 remain­ing. 
The Ravens advanced to their own 40 before a fourth-down pass slipped off the fingers of wide receiver Kevin Johnson. 
Lewis, the NFL rushing leader a year ago, was held to 73 yards on 15 carries. Kyle Boller went 10-for-17 for 154 yards. 
Rookie B.J. Sams returned a punt 58 yards for a touchdown and Boller threw a 57-yard touch­down pass on a flea-flicker. but the Ravens never took back the lead after going up 3-0. 
Kansas City took a 20-1 7 lead on a 38-yard field goal by Lawrence Tynes with 
8:19 left in the third quar­ter. Green extended the 11­play drive by avoiding a sure sack on third-and-10 and completing a 16-yard pass to Chris Horn. 
The Ravens then ran four plays before punting. and the Chiefs responded with a workmanlike 13-play driv.e that resulted in Holmes' sixth touchdown of the season. 
IN BRIEF 
Mariners fire Melvin after 
99-Ioss season 
SEATTLE -Bob Melvin was fired as manager of the Seattle Mariners on Monday, a day after the team ended the season with its 99th loss. 
Melvin, who lasted two seasons, was told of the decision during a morning meeting at Safeco Field, and general manager Bill Bavasi called a news conference later in the day. 
In May, the Mariners exercised the option on Melvin's contract for 2005 despite a 9-16 start. He led the team to a 93-69 record in 2003 after Lou Piniella left for Tampa Bay. 
The Mariners left spring training expecting to contend for a playoff spot. Instead, they finished 63-99 and barely avoided their first 100­loss season since 1983. 
"What can you do? Anytime a team struggles the way we have this year, you have to make some changes somewhere," Melvin said Sunday. 'Til just play it a day at a time. If I'm here, I'm here. It would be great." 
Melvin was not immediately avail­able for comment Monday. Some of Seattle's biggest problems can't be attributed directly to Melvin. 
The Mariners ranked last in the American League in runs scored (857), RBis (658) and home runs 
(136).. Former Bulls star Pippen
expected to retire 
DEERFIELD; Ill. -Scottie Pippen, who teamed with Michael Jordan to form a tandem that drove the Chicago Bulls to six NBA titles in the 1990s, is expected to retire after 17 seasons, an NBA source said Monday. 
The source, speaking on the condi­tion of anonymity, said Pippen is scheduled to make the announce­ment Tuesday on the Bulls' first day of training camp practice. The team held its media day Monday and Pippen was not present. 
His agent, Jimmy Sexton, did not immediately return a call for com­ment Monday night. 

Pippen was brought back last sea­son to give leadership and experi­ence to a young Bulls team, but he had knee surgery in December and played in only 23 games as the Bulls went 23-59. Losing streak continues for 
Philippoussis in Japan 
TOKYO -Mark Philippoussis dropped his fifth straight opening match Monday, losing to Tomas Zib of the Czech Republic 6-3, 6-4 in the Japan Open's first round. 
Philippoussis, a two-time Grand Slam finalist hampered by injuries all season, hasn't won a match since Wimbledon. 
With the schedule cut short by rain. Hare) Levy of Israel defeated Lu Yen-hsun of Taiwan 7-6 (1), 7-6 (1) and will face No. 4 Paradorn Srichaphan.

WOMEN'S GOLD INTERHALL WRAPS 
Underdog Howard holds No.1 Welsh Family to a tie 
By RAMA GOTTUMUKKALA, 
KATE SERYAK and THOMAS 
DORWART 
Sports Writers 
With a season on the brink, Sunday's game between Howard and Welsh Family came down to a thrilling defensive stop at the one-yard line. 
With a key goal line stand, Howard (0-3-1) kept Welsh Family (3-0-1) out of the endzone and escaped with a tie against the No. 1 ranked team in the women's interhall polls. 
"Coming off that game, we're so excited for the rest of the sea-­son because everything came together for us and to tie the number one ranked team was something we've been working for all semester," Howard captain Callie Whelan said. 
The Ducks took an early lead in the first half by scoring the first touchdown of the game. The Whirlwinds struck back with a touchdown score and extra point conversion to make the score 7-6. Then Kacey Rak intercepted a pass and ran it back to the six­yard line. Welsh Family took advantage of the turnover and scored to make the score 13-6. 

But the second half was a com­pletely different story. The Whirlwinds failed to click on offense and the incompletions piled up as receivers dropped passes. 
"It was a breakdown for us on all levels," Welsh Family captain Mary Pendergast said. "We were

doing things that we don't even do in practice. We were missing holes and we were not making plays, not catching passes. That's why it was so awful for us because we felt it was in our hands and we let it slip away." 
The turning point of the game came half way through the sec­ond half. Howard's Alicia Miramontes intercepted a Welsh Family pass and took it back 25 yards for a touchdown. After con­verting on the extra point. the Ducks found themselves in a posi­tion to tie or even steal the game from the Whirlwinds. 
"The whole thing about the game today was that our team came together," Whelan said. "Individually, the efforts put forth were amazing but things clicked as far as the team went that made everyone's role so impor­tant." 
After trading punts, the time ticked down to 1:58 left before Welsh Family began its final push. Using consecutive screen passes and a quarterback scram­bles, the Whirlwinds drove down to the Howard 10-yard line. On the final play of the game, Lauren Hoeck, Welsh Family's quarter­back, got free for a scramble that took the ball all the way to the 1­yard line before Miramontes again came up with a huge defensive stop, sealing the score at 13 points a piece for the two teams. 
Lewis 0, Lyons 0 
Sunday's game between Lewis and Lyons resulted in a disap­pointing tie. 
Both teams' defenses came out strong by blocking passes, catch­ing interceptions and stopping runs all throughout the game. 
At the end of the first half, Lyons found themselves in a dan­gerous position. After a penalty against their defense, Lewis was inches from a touchdown. 
"Defense really came through during the goal line stand. They did a great job defending their end zone and shutting Lewis down" Lyons coach Mike DeMartini. 
The Lewis defense forced sev­eral turnovers in the game, but Lyons was not to be outdone. Late in the second half, Lyons' defense intercepted the ball. Instead of

capitalizing on the turnover how­ever, the Lyons' quarterback threw an interception only two plays later. The Lyons' defense, not to be overshadowed by Lewis', responded with yet anoth­er turnover. In a huge play. both a Lyons' defender and a Lewis receiver had their hands on the ball, wrestling for it until they hit the ground and the referee called it as an interception. 
Lewis caught one interception in the first half and three in the second. 
"I really credit defense for their four interceptions," Lewis Captain Sheila Dawes said. Junior safety Lauren Mullins cause two of the turnovers, while sopho­mores Kate Altschaefal and Mia DeLaRosa each had one. 
"We're going to go back and play even better on Thursday. everyone's got to keep going," Dawes said . Pangborn 33, Off-Campus 7 
Prepared and focused, the Pangborn Phoxes (3-1-1) routed Off-Campus (0-4) Sunday at Riehle fields, mixing the option, long runs and tough defense. The win was Pangborn's third straight, while Off-Campus lost their fourth straight. 
"We started off pretty fast. We weren't going to underestimate them at all," Pangborn's Kara Tully said. "We were really pre­pared." 
On the second play from scrim­mage, the offensive rampage began. Pangborn running back Brynn Johnson took the hand-ofl' from quarterback Katie Mooney near the Phoxes' 30-yard line and dashed 70-yards to the end zone, putting Pangborn up 7-0. 
Any hope for Off-Campus to tie the score on their ensuing drive faded when the Phoxes' freshman cornerback Amanda Dunlavy picked off an Off-Campus pass. 
Turnovers and defensive touch­downs lifted the Phoxes. Brittny Heinrich intercepted two passes including one returned for a touchdown. 
"We just came up really big on defense. Pretty much every time they would try to throw the ball, we would intercept it or bat it down," freshman Stephanie Lewis said. 
Pangborn's strong defensive and offensive lines also played an important role in the victory. 
"We take our jobs pretty seri­ously," Lewis said. 
The Phoxes boasted an insur­mountable 33-0 lead by the time Off-Campus punched in a late touchdown. 
"Even though we were up by a lot, we were still working on plays, both ways, that we might need in the playoffs," Lewis said. 
As the postseason approaches. the Phoxes see room for improve­ment. 
"After every game, we are always told we can do better. We don't let wins and losses affect what we do," Dunlavy said. "We've been practicing really hard, and it shows on the field." 
Underdogs at the beginning of the season, Pangborn has estab­lished themselves as an interhall force. 
"No one really thought we were going to be really good this sea­son," Lewis said. "It's cool to come in as a freshman and win a lot o(games, more than we have in the past."

MEN'S GOLD INTERHALL WRAPS 

Dillon defense rolling, posts another shutout in victory 
Alumni and Keenan both win easily, improving to 2-0 with shutouts against their opponents in Week 3 action 
By CHRIS KHOREY, MIKE 
LASKEY, and 
MIKE TENNANT 
Sports Writers 
It's bnPn two games, and still no one has scored on Dillon. 
Thn Big Hnd defense, which was nxpt~ctl~d to be strong but not projected to be as dominant as it has been. postt~d its second consecutive shutout in a 14-0 victory over the Morrissny Manoritns on Sunday at Biehle Fi<'ld South. 
Last week. Dillon tied Stanford 0-0. This wnck. the offense stnppnd up as well. posting a touchdown in each half. 
l'tdlback Greg Belatti credits the improvemPnt to an extra week of practice. 
"We had little trouble running lthn olTenst~l last week. It was lirst game jitters." he said. "We had a chance to figure out what w1~nt wrong and fix the prob­I!HllS during the wenk." 
Thn Big Bed's veer option o!Tense. accumulated 94 yards on tho ground, led By 76 by Brlatti. who also scored both touchdowns. 
Unfortunatnly for Dillon. the victory came with a price. The Big Hnd lost two starters to injury. sat'nty Erik Hocca and wingback Ben Butwin. 
"Those are the kind of things that define a team. how they rnspond to somPthing like that," Belatti said. "We'II find guys to fill those holes." 
Morrissey star halfback Nick Klein had some early success. but was rendered ineffective by the Dillon lead and several long down-and-distance situations created by penalties. 

Klein. who rushed for 43 
yards on nine carries, broke 
through the line on several 
occasions. but was always 
stopped by the sure-tackling Big 
lkd secondary. 

"They have a pretty hard hit­
ting secondary," he said. 

To make matters worse for the Manorites, quarterback Pete Sprietzer and the passing attack were completely ineffective. Sprietzer completed only 4-of-11 passes for 45 yards. with 22 of those yards coming on the last play of the game. 
''I'm not sure what the deal was." Klein said. "Their second­ary kept batting down passes." 
The loss marks the second in as many weeks for the Manorites, who in the preseason were expected to compete for the title. 
"We're going to forget about this game." captain Aaron Honsheim said. "We can still make the playoffs." 
Although the team's offensive strength appears to be Klein and the running game. Ronsheim would not rule out surprising next week's opponent, the Stanford Griffins. with a few passes. 
"We're going to do whatever it takes to win," he said. "Hun or pass, whatever we need to do to win." 
Dillon faces Keough next week. Alumni 20, O'Neill 0 
A two-week layofl' didn't slow the Alumni Dawgs. Sunday 
afternoon proved quite the con­
trary. 
Led by a stif1ing defense and the steady play of quarterback Brent Locey. the Dawgs tore apart the O'Neill Mob 20-0 yes­terday. 
Forcing six turnovers, Alumni effectively prevented the O'Neill squad from moving anywhere on offense. The Dawgs' defen­sive line and linebacker corps worked in tandem to shut down the Mob's running game, while the defensive backs' blanketing coverage made passing difficult at best. 
Alumni captain A.J. Remen liked what he saw on the defen­sive side of the ball. 
"We have one of the best defensive lines in the league," Remen said. 'They make every­thing easier for the linebackers and secondary." 
Hemen made his own contri­butions on the defensive side, highlighted by a 30-yard inter­ception return for a touchdown in the fourth quarter. 
Alumni's offense did not let the defense's efforts go to waste, taking advantage of turnovers and good field positioning to score twice in the second quar­ter. Both touchdowns came through the air as the freshman Locey hit his mark for scores of 12 and four yards. 
"The receivers did a great job today," Locey said. "They posi­tioned themselves well for the catches. They weren't perfectly thrown balls, but they made great plays." 
When he wasn't finding open receivers down field, Locey often 
kept the ball himself. e!l1ciently 
scrambling away from O'Neill 
defenders whenever they were 
able to flush the pocket. 

Alumni's success yesterday may be due to the extent of its game preparation. 
"We scout every team," Hemen said. "We knew [O'Neill'sl strengths and were able to capi­talize on their weaknesses." 
Improving to 2-0, Alumni will face its toughest test of the sea­son next week when it squares off against Keenan. 
"Keenan has four big running backs and a really balanced offense," Brent Locey said. "We just need to keep practicing the way we've been practicing." 
Keenan 27, Keough 0 

Saying that Keenan is hitting on all cylinders might be an understatement. 
In their romp of Keough Sunday, the Knights dominated both sides of the ball. tallying up over 250 yards on oll'ense while holding the Kangaroos to only 
46. 

"It was a total team effort." senior captain Pat Downey said afterward. 
Offensively, the Knights were again led by sophomore quar­terback Eric Laumann who threw for 180 yards and four touchdowns. 
After both teams exchanged turnovers in the l'irst quarter, Keenan put together a 74-yard drive in the second, capping it off with an 8-yard touchdown pass from Laumann to receiver Dan Zenker. 
After a Keough fumble on their own 45, the Knights again struck paydirt when Laumann hit receiver Heed Langton from seven yards out to put the Knights up 13-0 as time expirnd in the first half. 
On the third play of tlw second half. Laumann connected with Zenker again. this time for a 55­yard touchdown strike. After the Knight def1~use forced a Knough punt, Laumann found Stove Miller in the end zone for his fourth touchdown pass of tlw game. 
"This game makes us question our pass defense." Keough sen­ior captain and quarterbaek Brian Kusper said. "We definite­ly are going to have to work on our secondary." 
"Keough decided to put eight men in the box to stop our run game. and when we have Langton and Zenker, you can have the ball thrown to them." Downey said. 
Tlw Keenan defense continuf'd its dominance over tlw gold league. allowing tlw Kangaroos only live offensive yards in tlw second half. SPnior linebackers Brandon f fall and Pat Hobinson led a Knight deftmsive front that stopped the Kangaroos dead at the line of scrimmage multipiP times, including on a 4th-and-I deep in Knight territory. 
"They were just a superior team today," Kusper said. "They were all over us."

offense seems to be catching up. 
After being shutout in its sea­son opene~ the Cavanaugh offense has blossomed into a very formidable and explosive unit, as the Weasel defense found out all too well. Cavanaugh accumulated 160 yards of total offense, including 65 yards on the ground, en route to two touchdowns through the air and one off of an option. 

Chaos quarterback Lisa Ruffer made certain to spread the wealth on offense, as she con­nected with six different receivers. 
"I think that first game got us angry," Ruffer said. "We wanted to live up to the expectations." 
Cavanaugh came out firing; scoring on each of its first two possessions, one of which was a perfectly executed quarterback option that freshman Tarah Brown took the distance. Seniors Sara Gilloon and Jenny Nokes pulled down the offense's other two scores. 
Pasquerilla West's quarterback Heather Van Hoegarden was under constant pressure all game and the Weasel offense never got itself established. The Weasels did, however, come out and score off a long drive on their first possession of the sec­ond half, pulling them within a touchdown. The Chaos defense then rose to the challenge, keep­ing the Weasels from even com­ing close to scoring again. 

"The defense, and the team, works on getting better each week," Chaos coach Hunter Craig said. "We feel confident that we can win every week." · 
With the game already in hand, freshman cornerback Uzzy Brown, on the last play of the game, intercepted a Van Hoegarden desperation pass and returned it 30 yards for Cavanaugh's fourth and final score. Cavanaugh's balanced offense and stingy defense were too much for Pasquerilla West to overcome. 
Pasquerilla West (1-1-1) will look to rebound against Farley this Tuesday at 7 p.m. while Cavanaugh (2-0-1) tries to remain unbeaten when they take on McGlinn this Tuesday at 9 
p.m. Both games are at the Riehle West Fields. 
McGlinn 19, Pasquerllla East 
0. 
It was a big game for both teams, and McGlinn came out on top. Both the Shamrocks and Pasquerilla East came into the. game without a win and the Shamrocks came out victorious with a win. 
"Our offense didn't give the ball away as much," McGlinn coach Jake Granatino said. "We had great defense." 
McGlinn scored very early in the game. The Shamrocks ran for a 40-yard touchdown for the first six points. Before halftime, they scored on a 15-yard touch­down run. Neither of the two extra point attempts were suc­cessful. This brought the score to 12-0 at halftime. 
The Pyros were having some trouble moving the ball at the start of the game. The offense could not get into the flow of the game. Penalties hurt the Pyros, but by the end of the half, they were moving the ball better. 
The Pyro defense struggled. but intercepted one pass in the first half. 
In the second half of the game, McGlinn ran for one more touch­down and the extra point attempt was good. Although down, the Pyros didn't quit. The offensive line was cheering for the defensive line. They fought a hard battle and never gave up. Towards the end of the game, they had more successful run­ning plays. However, McGlinn was just too much to handle. 
"PE ran an unorthodox offense," Granatino said. 'They had some break downs. They got shut down." 
Pasquerilla East is now 0-4, while McGlinn is 1-2.

WOMEN'S BLUE INTERHALL PREVIEWS 
Walsh ready to face No. 1 Breen-Phillips 
By NATHAN DYER, BRAD 

WALLACE and KEN FOWLER 
Sports Writers 
Sinc11 200 I, every Super Bowl­

winning NFL team, from the 
Baltimorn Havnns to last y11ars 
NPW l·:ngland Patriot<;, has relied 
on a strong d11fimsn to overpower 
tlwir oppmwnt. The Wild Women 
of' Walsh arn using a similar strat­
egy in this s11ason's attempt to 
makn it to tlw stadium and thn 
wonun's championship. 
"It's rnaUy n<L<;y to win wlwn the 

dP!imsP kneps giving us shutout<;," 
said WaL<;h frnshman quartnrback 
Mary Sullivan after last Tuesday's 
shutout victory ovPr McGlinn. 
Tnw to form. WaL<;h senior cap­

lain Carrin Campbl'll predict'i that 
this Tuesday's gamn against 
Brnnn-l'hillips will be another 
dnfnnsivn struggle. 
"This is going to b!' a mally low scoring game." Campbell said, pn1dicling that another shutout will bn necessary to put away Brn1m-Phillips. 
Breen-Phillips, however, is no slouch. The top-ranked team in the h1ague, the undefeated Babes also rely on their defense to win games. Led by sophomore co-cap­lain Shannon Swanigan. the Brnen-Phillips defimse is not only grnat at kneping opponents out of tlwir nnd zone, but also great at turning opponent<;' mistakes into point<;. 
Against l'asquerilla East last wnnk. Brnen-Phillips forced two intnrceptions. with senior Hache! Kemp returning one all the way for a touchdown. But with Kemp sidelin11d with an injury, the Babes will look to other members of the defnnse to carry the load. 
While Breen-Phillip's secondary has played well against the pass this year. it L<; Walsh's senior cor­nerback Katie !!esmond who has given the most trouble to oppos­ing quart11rbacks. With two inter­ceptions in each game. Hesmond has a remarkable eight on the SPiL<;on. 
WhilP it is impossible to over­look the impact that I !esmond has on a game, Breen-Phillips captain Jaimie Feltault is confident in sophomore quarterback Ali Brosnan's ability to stay out of trouble by spreading the ball around to multiple receivers. 
"Ali's been getting more and more comfortable running the oflimse with each game. lbyl not just keying in on one receiver but throwing the ball to any open receiver." Feltault said. 
Farley vs. Pasquerllla West 
The toughest game faces could provp to be instrumental in tonight's game between Pasquerilla West and Farley. 
The 1-1-1 Wea<;el<; will meet the 1-3 Finest at 7 p.m. at Biehle Finld in a game that could make or break the seasons of both teams. 
"We know if we win our next two ganws we can make the play­offs. so obviously this game is really important to us." Farley captain Angelina Zehrbach said. "I think our biggest strength is that we don't give up, and that's going come into play a lot in the 
gam1~." 
Captain Abby Nerlinger and P<L'>querilla West are in a similar boat. needing a big win in order to realize their playoff goals. 1\ft.er a disappointing game on Sunday 
against Cavanaugh. the Weasels 
are ready to make the push 
towards a successful season. 

"We didn't play up to our poten­
tial this weekend. We came out 
slow. and we had some trouble 
adjusting to their offense. We 
worked on these things in prac­
tice, and hopefully tonight we'll 
play like we know we can." 
Nerling1~r commented. 

Farley is also coming off a weak 
performance, and hopes that the 
extra practice they took in will be 
beneficial in tonight's competition. 
'Thus far. things haven't really 
been clicking for us. We didn't 
have a game on Sunday, so we've 
been able to spend more time 
working on our weaknesses and 
reevaluating things. We add1~d to 
our defense. hoping to switch 
things up and prevent the offense 
from exploiting our· coverage. Our 
ofl'ense also worked on adjusting 
to diffen~nt types of coverage, 
which I think will really help," 
Zehrbach said. 

Both teams agree. however, that 
the key to the game will be getting 
a strong start. 

"If we can establish a rhythm 
and build up some momentum. I 
think we've got a great chance of 
winning. We just need to keep the 
ball moving," Zehrbach 
explained. 
McGlinn vs. Cavanaugh 

Coming off an impressive win against Pasquerilla West. the Cavanaugh Chaos will look to improve to 3-0-1 tonight against the McGlinn Shamrocks. 
"It was a whole team effort," Cavanaugh quarterback and cap­tain Lisa Ruffer said of Sunday's win, "and we're going to go out there Tuesday with the mentality that we can win and will." 
However, Liz Maher and the Shamrocks are coming off an equally impressive victory. one which may have righted a drifting ship. i\fter losing its first two games, the Shamrocks easily cruised over Pasquerilla East Sunday, 18-0. 
The two losses for McGlinn, though. have come against high­ranked Breen-Phillips and Walsh Family. After two games. the Shamrocks had been outscored by only seven points, but were in desperate need of a quick turn­around. 
Tonight's game will be a true test of valor for the Shamrocks, whose playoff contention is on the line. 
Before the game against Pasquerilla East, Maher said that the team needed to "solidify on ofl'ense." Three touchdowns later. the team's success is apparent. 
For Cavanaugh, the task will be to continue to play as it has in its three wins. With a 14-point victo­ry over Farley and the 18-point win over Pasquerilla West. the Chaos seem to be in control of the team's destiny. 
Both teams stress group-effort, and both feel that the game will not be determined by one player alone. Maher called the Chaos' current undefeated season a result of "terrific team effort," not ofjust one or two players. 
"We have a bunch of great play­ers, but we have won because we play together well," she said.

Saturday and finding the form they had during that three-game winning streak. 
"To come back from a game like that it takes a lot of leadership. Five of the teams that were play­ing in BCS games last year had at least two losses." linebacker Mike GooL<>by said. "To hear something like that is very encouraging to know that some of the goals you set at the start of the season are still attainable. You have to keep that in the back of your mind." 
The players felt a lack of execu­tion was the problem Saturday. The Irish believe they have the ability to compete with anyone in the country and still feel that way despite the disappointment on Saturday. 
"It's not a matter of talent. It's not a matter of potential," fifth­year senior linebacker Derek Curry said. "It's just a matter of getting the job done and execut­ing the game plan properly. That's the only thing that hurt us last week. We didn't execute it well enough." 
If the Irish don't maintain the correct focus. this season could spiral out of control very quickly. Based on the current records of the final six teams on their sched­ule, the Irish are facing the tough­est schedule in the country. 
A promising 3-1 start could be all erased, and the unthinkable could follow. 
"More than anything is knowing what it feels like to go through a season like that," fifth-year senior Kyle Budinscak said. "If we win the rest of our ball games, we can have a great season. If we go out there and continue to have let­downs. we know how terrible it can be. 
"Last year is going to be a reminder as to what we don't want to let happen."

NO CROSS COUNTRY 
Stanford takes title, but Irish runners not far behind 
Notre Dame keeps up pace with Cardinal 
By BOBBY GRIFFIN Spom Writer 
Tlw Irish may have run a good race on Friday. but the Cardinal soared. 
Notre Dame put on a great showing. as the men took second and the women third in the Notre Dame Cross Country Invitational. But the story of the 
race was Stanford, who won both the men's and women's events. 
The Cardinal men are ranked No. 2 in the nation. while the women are ranked No. 1. according to separate polls. 
Stanford led the men's race with 89 points while the women won with 34 points. 
The Irish performed very well, especially on the men's side. fol­lowing up on their dominating performance in the National Catholic Invitational. 
This, however. was a much dif­ferent race, with a much differ­ent class of runner. 
Men's coach Joe Piane stressed the difficulty of the race, and. the highly-talented field that the Irish had to com­pete with. 
"Going into the race there [were) eight nationally-ranked teams and we were actually ranked eight going into it," said Piane. "We beat six nationally­ranked teams and we came pretty close to Stanford." 
Irish runner Kurt Benninger finished second .overall, with a time of 23:43, just three seconds behind Brigham Young

this season on a great note. 

"Our seni.ors know what our focus needs to be. We just have to filter that down through our foot­ball team." 
The Irish are maintaining the same attitude they've had throughout the entire season -if they execute and get the job done on their end. regardless of the opponent, they can compete with anyone. It's something coach Tyrone Willingham must have talked over the weekend because at least two Irish players men­tioned facts about two-loss teams making a Bowl Championship Series bowl game last year. 
Whether that's realistic or not. the first ~tep toward meeting one of their preseason goals is getting back into Notre Dame Stadium

MEN'S BLUE INTERHALL WRAP 
Fisher do-wns Knott on last-second field goal 
By KYLE CASSILY, JOHN 
EVERETT and PETE 
CRACCHIOLO 
SportS Wri1ors 
Fisher kicker Daniel Manaas just took it like any other kick. only this kick was to determine whether the Green Wave would come away with its third victory of the season or settle for a tie. With the score deadlocked at 3-3 and 10 seconds remain­ing on the clock in Sunday's match between Fisher and Knott, Manaas lined up for the kick. The ball was spot­ted on the 21-yard line, mak­ing it a 38-yard field goal attempt. The snap was per­feet, and Manaas hammered a line drive kick just over the bottom of the uprights to guarantee a Fisher victory at 6-3. 
This was the second of two field goals that he had on the

Belles face Tri-State at home 
By RYAN DUFFY SportS Writer 

For the Belles this season. there's been no place like honw. 
Saint Mary's is 3-0 at home this season, with wins over three of the top four teams in their conference. but holds a significantly worse record of 1­2-1 on the road. Thn team will look to show their strength again today, when they take on Tri-State University at home. 
"We really love playing at home; it's a big bonus to not have to get on that bus for a long road trip to a game" said coach Caryn MacKenzie. "We like having the game in our area, and I'm excited for this week when we get to stay home twice. But whether it turns out to be a pattern or not, right now we don't play very well on the road." 
In the Belles' most recent road match, the team was unable to play with the same intensity from start to finish. and suffered a 4-1 loss to Calvin. Saint Mary's will look to remedy that problem today on their home field. 
"We played a great first half against Calvin, but in the second half we just came out flat," said MacKenzie. "They were more energetic, and we were just deflated. We still can't seem to consistently put two solid halves together. We want to avoid repeating that against Tri­State." 
While Calvin sits in first place and is one of the conference's premier teams, Tri-State resides
