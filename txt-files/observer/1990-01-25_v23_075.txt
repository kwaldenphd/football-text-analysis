INSIDE COLUMN 

Don't be mad: Guns N' Roses is nice n' nasty 
Anyone who saw the American Music Tim O'Keefe Awards on TV Mon-Assistant News Editor 
day night got quite an 
earful from Guns N' 
Roses. 
Guns N' Roses lived up to its hard-rocking reputation when guitarist Slash and a fellow band member staggered on stage to accept the awards. The band, which won awards for best heavy metal group and best heavy metal album, was cut off twice for using profanity during the live show. 
There are two possible responses to this. One is what your mother would say: "What nasty, vulgar young men-and the mouths on them! They ought to be thrown into a cage with a pack of half-starved pit bulls and die a slow, horrible death if they can't behave themselves. Why don't they give the award to somebody decent, like Barry Manilow?" 
Many Notre Dame students might agree. After all, we're clean-cut, all-American boys and girls who would probably make Beaver Cleaver puke in disgust. 
I think that there is a much better response. Isn't it good to see rock 'n' roll be unaeceptable, trashy and mindless? A lot of heavy metal bands today are as innocuous as New Kids on the Block or as clean as Milli Vanilli. 
Because heavy metal today has become so flaccid, almost the only ones left who are rude and obnoxious are punk bands, like the Dead Kennedys and the Day-Glo Abor­tions. 
These bands are plenty offensive enough, with songs like "Holiday in Cambodia" and "Kill the Poor." They're not very popular, but many teens need something offensive to defy their fascist parental units. 
Hemember the good old days of heavy metal, when the bands were socially unac­ceptable? 
Angst-driven outfits like Black Sabbath and Judas Priest stimulated the stupid t'ebellion of teenagers everywhere. Songs like "Iron Man" and "Love Bites" became anthems for a generation of self-pitying, maladjusted meatheads. 
Nowadays, bands have song titles like "Just say 'No,' " or "I Make Six Million Dollars a Year for Wearing Spandex, so Screw You." Well, if they're going to be that bourgeois about it, why be a heavy metal band? It's refreshing to see the members of Guns N' Hoses speak with illegal substances coursing through their veins, using profane language, and in general being offensive. 
So the next time you see a group like Guns N' Hoses, don't condemn them. Sure they're obnoxious. Sure they're stupid. But they serve an important function. 
They keep today's rebellious youth distracted until they grow up to become well-adjusted members of society who can cheerfully enter the world of yuppiedom and engage in the soul-deadening pursuit of tawdry status symbols.

AP Photo Japan's first lunar probe, the M3S-2 rocket, soars into the heavens Wednesday carrying two satellites aboard the three­stage main rocket. 
UCHINOUR/\, Japan (APl ­Japan's first lunar probe was put into orbit around the Earth on Wednesday, ending a 14­year gap between moon mis­sions and giving new prestige to the country's young space program. 
Space center officials said the Muses-/\ satellite, as planned, separated from its Nissan­made .rocket several minutes after liftoff Wednesday night from an oceanside launch site in southern Japan. 
Mission chief Hiroki Matsuo said data from tracking sta­tions in California and Australia showed the satellite was orbiting the Earth at a maximum distance of 186,000 miles. 
The satellite in its highly el­liptical orbit is to close within 11,250 miles of the moon by March 18. 

Meeting on Vietnamese refu ees breaks u in turmoil 
GENEV!\ (/\Pl -!\ 30-nation eonfernnee on Vifltnamese boat people broke up in disarray Wedm~sday after U.S. and Vietnamese delegates balked at a compromise starting date for forced deportation to Vietnam of those denied refugee status. 
The United States last week dropped its outright opposition to mandatory repatriation of Vietnamese held to be economic migrants. But it told the closed, U.N.-sponsored meeting the proposed July l date was too narly. and said no one should have to return to Vietnam be­fore Jan. 1. 1991, officials said. 
Britain wanted deportations to begin at once -before the sailing season starts in March -to deter a further influx of boat people into the overflow­ing camps in Hong Kong, a British crown colony. 
The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) had tried to bridge the gap by suggesting a six­month delay in the repatriation process. 
The future of tens of thou: sands of Vietnamese boat peo­ple is at stake. 
Chief British delegate Robin McLaren expressed disap­pointment at the failure to reach an international agreP.­
ment that would have enabled 
UNIICH to monitor people sent 
back to Vietnam. 
lie said Britain now will have to consider whether to go ahead and return more boat people against their will. Under a deal with Hanoi, Britain forcibly sent back 51 boat peo­ple from the overcrowded Hong Kong camps last month. 
McLaren, speaking to journalists after the meeting, said Vietnamese officials told delegates any internationally­agreed program of forced repatriations should not begin before Oct. 1. 
Vietnam says it needs time to prepare for any mass return of boat people so they can be ab­sorbed into Vietnam's stricken 
economy. 
McLaren noted, however, that 
for the first time there was 
consensus that boat people 
deemed to have fled for eco­
nomic reasons rather than po­
litical persecution should be re­
turned even against their will. 
Sergio Vieira de Mello, a se­nior UNHCR official who presided over the two-day meeting in Geneva, said Norway's Thorwald Stoltenberg, the new High Commissioner for Refugees, was asked to see if a consensus 


Japan's 'young space program' launches first lunar space probe 
At that time, shortly before it crosses the moon's path in a so-called "swing-by," it is to release a second, smaller satel­lite, which will be propelled into lunar orbit about 10,000 miles from the moon. 
The smaller satellite will send data its mother satellite detail­ing the lunar region's tempera­tures and electrical fields. 
The launch originally was scheduled Tuesday, but the countdown was stopped with 18 seconds remaining because of an electrical problem in the hydraulic system. 
Only the United States and the Soviet Union have sent mis­sions to the moon, the most re­cent being the 1976 landing of an unmanned Soviet vehicle. 
The mission is a symbolic step forward for Japan's growing space program, which has relied more on diligent engineering than large budgets. 
"This time we are going to the moon. But our objective is not the moon itself," Matsuo said. "Our institute is getting into interplanetary missions in the 1990s, and for that we need to refine our technology." 
As technicians prepared the M3S-2 rocket on the space cen­ter's only launch pad, officials shivered in buildings around the center where heaters were turned off to conserve electric­ity for the launch equipment. 
Both the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), which is conducting the moon mission, and Japan's other space agency, the National Space Dev~lopment Agency, have plans for future manned space flights and in­terplanetary travel.

About 109,000 boat people are in camps in Southeast Asia, including 56,000 in Hong Kong, according to UNHCR figures. The 44,000 boat people who arrived in Hong Kong after June 1988 may be screened to determine if they class as gen­uine political refugees. Arrivals 
before June 1988 were granted refugee status without screen­ing.
UNHCR spokesman Raymond Hall said about 7,000 people have so far been screened in Hong Kong and only 15 percent were accepted as genuine refugees. 
The United States has argued that more time was needed to enable the voluntary program to work. 
Hall said UNHCR was "very satisfied" with Vietnam's treatment of people who re­turned of their own accord. He said there was no sign of any reprisals.

Van swerves-off road into canal, killing 10 farm laborers 
CLEWISTON, Fla. (APJ -A farm labor van plunged off a curve and into a canal in heavy fog Wednesday in rural Hendry County, trapping and drowning 10 migrant workers from Mexico, authorities said. 
"Some of them had stuck their arms out trying to get out, but they just didn't make it," said sheriff's Lt. Bill Chamness. "When the deputies dove in to gl~t them, they were already dead." 
The driver and one passenger escaped through windows with minor injuries as the panel van sank in 12 feet of murky water, he said. Nine men and one woman couldn't get out, he said. 
"We think it was probably due to dense fog," Chamness said. "In the accident ·area, there's a curve. Evidently they got on the curve quicker than they thought, and instead of turning they went straight into the canal." 

The driver "made no attempt to turn, and he's driven this road many times." he said. 

U.S. gets a look at Soviet nuclear power 
r WASHINGTON (APJ -U.S. and Soviet negotiators, seeking 
r to speed work on a proposed arms pact, have agreed to the first ever peek at each other's nuclear warheads, U.S. spokesmen said Wednesday. Under the terms of a little publicized protocol signed in Geneva on Monday, U.S. and Soviet inspectors will take a close look sometime this spring at warheads atop one each of the other side's land-based and submarine-launched ballistic missiles, the spokesmen said. Determining the exact num­ber of warheads aboard mis­siles and bombers \)'ill be key when the two sides complete work on the Strategic Arms Heduction Treaty. to cut super­power arsenals by 30 percent to 50 percent. Secretary of State James Baker is to hold talks in Moscow on Feb. 6-7 with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in an effort to speed work on the START ac­cord for possible signing at an expected summit next June. Three previous arms control treaties have not been ratified by the Senate, in large measure because of doubts that they eould be verified. Under the new protocol, the Soviets also will have a chance to look at two U.S. B-1 B bombers. and the Americans at two Soviet Tupolev-95 "Bear"

bombers. One version will be designed to carry cruise mis­siles and the other to carry standard bombs. 
. The Soviet ballistic missiles to be inspected are the landbased SS-18 and the the submarine­launched SS-N-23, said Matthew Murphy, a spokesman for the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. 
The Soviets say the SS-18, like the U.S. MX missile, carries 10 warheads, although one in­telligence source said that the big Soviet booster can lift up to 20 nuclear devices. The Soviets will get a close look under the tip of an MX and the new D-5, to be deployed aboard sub­marines starting this March. 
The D-5 is designed to carry eight and the SS-N-23 to carry four warheads, according to information published by the two sides. 
"This agreement marks the first time that the U.S. and the Soviet Union will inspect a number of each other's nuclear warheads on ballistic missiles," said a statement read by David Denny, a State Department spokesman. 
The exact time and place of the inspections has not been disclosed. 
President Bush last June pro­posed that the two sides test verification techniques before conclusion df START, an unusual step designed to en-
But the driver told investiga­tors he lost control of the van when the steering failed, said Florida Highway Patrol Maj. Mike Kirby in Tallahassee. 
"That van will be meticu­lously scrutinized in the next day or two," Kirby said. 
Chamness said the privately owned van went straight for 50 yards instead of making the curve on a county road about six miles south of this Lake Okeechobee farm community, which is about 100 miles northwest of Miami. 
The road cuts through a sugar cane district intersected by numerous irrigation and drainage canals, Chamness said. 
The accident occurred at about 7:30 a.m. EST. but the sheriffs office didn't receive word until 7:46 a.m. The first deputies to arrive dove into the water in a fruitless rescue ef­fort. 

"They could feel some of the arms out of the window but they were dead," the lieutenan1 said. "There was nothing you could do." 
A sheriffs diver who attached a tow-truck cable to the back of the sunken van estimated visibility in the 50-foot-wide canal was only about 2 feet, Chamness said. 
The surviving passenger, Nicolas Escobedo, 50, was in­terviewed briefly outside the Aiken-Davis funeral home, where all of the bodies were taken. 
"It happened very fast. We were on the road, and then the next I knew we were under wa­ter," he said in Spanish. 
Escobedo said all of the workers were living in LaBelle, and many were related. Eleanor Hough, spokeswoman at Hendry General Hospital. said the driver's wife was one of the victims. 
The driver was admitted to Hendry General Hospital in stable condition for observa­tion. said emergency room nurse Maggie Kocher. She did not release his name. Escobedo was treated and released. 
The two suffered "just mini­mal injuries," such as scrapes and bruises and showed no signs of broken bones or inter­nal injuries, she said. 

Safety event planned for SMC

A possible two day safety and security event was dis­cussed at Saint Mary's Board of Student Affairs meeting Wednesday night.

At the 1987 Washington summit, the sides agreed on the number of warheads to be at­tributed to each existing type of strategic ballistic missile and on the need for inspections. 
Precautions will be taken to ensure that the inspectors learn as little as possible about the internal design of the war­heads, possible by shrouding them in cloths so that opposing experts see. only several lumps inside the delivery vehicles, said one source.

The two day event is tenta­tively scheduled for Feb. 27 and 28. 
Also scheduled is a presen­tation on karate and self de­fense. This will be held in Angela Athletic Facility, possibly before the nightly aerobics. 
Board member Tina Don­ahue suggested that some teachers use the presenta­tions as part of their class agenda. 
"Especially in the Woman's Studies classes ... it would al­low more students to partic­ipate and become involved." 
Donahue also suggested that the women of Notre Dame be formally invited to create more involvement. 
Also discussed were the dates of many social activi­ties, such as hall and class dances, which will be an­nounced in the next few weeks. Saint Mary's will also be participating in a waste recycling program. It will be similar to that of Notre Dame's, and there will be boxes in every hall section.

'Magician' seeks to rid neighborhood of billboard ads 
CHICAGO lAP) -The paint­brush-wielding "magician" who made several billboards disap­pear under coats of white paint said Wednesday he's fed up with glamorous ads touting to­bacco and alcohol in inner-city neighborhoods. 
But a billboard company spokesman said the paint jobs am vandalism. 
The painter, who's taken the pseudonym Mandrake aftlr the comic-strip magician, said bill­board ads in predominantly black and Hispanic neighbor­
hoods  on  the South  Side  are  
aimed  at  young  people  and  
promote dangerous vices.  

Mandrake, who described himself as a 54-year-old black professional but declined to give his real name, said he's taken a paintbrush to bill­boards three times in broad daylight because the ads cor­rupt young people. "I have seen over the past 
two years a disproportionate amount of advertising in the black and Hispanic commu­nity," he said in a telephone in­terview. "I believe it was time for us to stand up and fight back. 
''I'm a firm believer in the Constitution and believe the law was broken ... but at the same time, there is a moral obliga­tion. a right, that must be ad­dressed," he said. 
Geoff Obrzut, a spokesman for national billboard company Patrick Media, said he filed a police report Wednesday. 
"lie's obviously vandalizing private property," Obrzut said in a telephone interview. "We would be willing to prosecute if he's caught." 
Mandrake's actions have helped fuel a controversy over the targeting of minorities by alcohol and tobacco companies. 
On one side stand consumer advocates alarmed by the num­ber of people from inner-city communities dying from smok­ing-and drinking-related ill­nesses. 
On the other side are industry representatives, who dismiss attacks on such advertising as an infringement of the constitu­tional right to freedom of speech. Industry representa­tives contend that ads specifi­cally aimed at minorities are harmless and that people make their own decision about whether to light up or take a drink. 
However, the lung cancer rate has increased four times faster among blac.ks than among whites in the past 30 years, ac­cording to reports from the American Lung Association and the National Cancer Institute. 
A 1987 study by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a health advocacy group based in Washington, found that black men have a 70 percent higher death rate from cirrhosis of the liver than whites. 

The health advocacy group contends that children are be­ing encouraged by the billboard ads. 
"Children on the way to school and back home or even at recess get the message that the way to be happy, glam­orous, or athletic is to smok(l and-or drink," a center publi­cation said. 
Obrzut disagreed, saying that while 50 percent of billboard advertising does occur in the inner city, a company study found that only 16 percent of Chicago's 2,500 billboards were alcohol-or tobacco-related. 
Gary Miller, a spokesman for the American Tobacco Institute in Washington, said studies also show that young people become smokers primarily be­cause of peer group pressures and parental influence.

He said tobacco companies might advertise to minorities because more minorities than whites tend to be smokers. 
"Just like an effective adver­tisement, you try to reach those people to whom it appeals," Miller said in a telephone inter­view. 
Janet Flynn of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, echoed Miller's senti­ments, saying: "We restrict our advertising to responsible adult customers.'' 
In Baltimore, pressure from various groups led an advertis­ing company to remove much of its black-oriented advertising. 
And R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. recently scrapped plans to test market Uptown, a new ci­garette aimed at the black community, after opposition from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. '

Fellowships awarded to Notre Dame graduate students 
Special to The Observer 
Several students in the 

University of Notre Dame's 
Graduate School received pres­
tigious fellowships and awards 
for study during the 1989-90 
academic year. 
Handall Kolar, a graduate student in civil engineering, re­ceived a National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Fellowship. Lance Perez, a graduate student in electrical and computer engineering re­eeived an NSF Graduate Hesearch Fellowship. John Nieto. a graduate student in philosophy, received an NSF Minority Graduate Fellowship. 
The NSF fellowships provide support for outstanding stu­dents pursuing advanced de­grees in seience, mathematics and engineering. Last year, only 685 of the nearly 5,150 stu­dents submitting applications received NSF Graduate Fellowships. Only 75 of the 740 students submitting applica­tions received NSF Minority Graduate Fellowships.

curity with private retirement plans. The president's refusal at a news conference to reject the Porter-Gingrich proposal was quiekly criticized by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. the New York Democrat whose own tax-eut plan was dismissed by Bush. 
Moynihan. who is considered one of the government's top authorities on Social Security, said of the Hepublican con­gressmen's proposal, "The pre.,ident described that as 'innovative thinking'. Was it in­novative thinking after 50 years of steady payments to start dismantling Soeial Security? I don't think so." 
The subject of Social Security arose at Bush's news confer­ence when he was asked about Moynihan's plan to roll back this year's tax increase and re­duee one sehedul<~d next year. The aim of the bill -whieh has attracted widespread interest. if not support. in Congress -is to halt the use of surplus Social Security taxes to make the fed­eral deficit appear far smaller than it is. 
Bush said he sees no need for any major change in Social Se­curity at this time. "I think the systmn has been. in and out over the years. basieally a pretty fair system," he said. 
Moynihan's bill is "a disguise for increased taxes around the corner," Bush said. "This is a ... sleight-of-hand operation." he added, noting that shortly after Moynihan outlined his plan, Sen. Ernest Hollings, D­

awards from the Jacob K. 
Javits Fellows Program in 
1989-90. They join James 
!larder, a graduate student in 
economics and Marie Kramb 
and Margaret Stein, both grad­
uate students in English, as 
Javits Fellows at Notre Dame. 
The Javits Fellows Program, administered by the U. S. Department of Education, of­fers scholarship awards to doctoral students in the arts, humanities and social sciences. 
Bryce Cole, a graduate stu­dent in civil engineering and Timothy Power, a graduate student in government and in­ternational studies, received Fulbright Scholar Awards to study in Germany and Brazil, respectively. 
During the 1989-90 academic year, 639 of these awards were granted to 3048 applicants. Funded primarily by the U.S. government with additional contributions from other na­tions, the Fulbright awards are intended to foster international understanding by supporting a variety of educational activities. 
In addition, five international students received Fulbright awards to study at Notre Dame. They are Christophe Kougniazonde and Guillaume 
S.C., proposed to replace rev­enues from the reduced Social Security taxes with a national sales tax. 
"There is no sleight of hand whatsoever," Moynihan replied, "and I do not see that there was any need to make such a characterization." 
Lawmakers from both parties have expressed displeasure that Social Security surpluses ­which are building at the rate of $1 billion a week -are being used for defieit reduction, rather than being invested solely for the benefit of future retirees. 
Moynihan has been speaking on this issue for months. But it grabbed public attention for the first time when, during a slow news period over the De­cember holidays. he called for cutting the taxes if they are not going to be saved for Social Se­curity. 
There were these other devel­opments Wednesday: 
-Bush said Congress should wait to see his own proposal for gradually taking Social Se­curity surpluses out of the fed­eral defieit calculation. That long-range plan, starting in 1993. would require that a growing portion of the surplus be used to retire publicly held debt. 
-House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said he has se­rious reservations about Moynihan's proposed tax cut.

Right to life of unborn baby takes precedence 

By Manuel Espino 
Last Monday l was one of the many who marched in our na­tion's capital to express disap­proval concerning the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade deci­sion. It has been 17 years since the court ruled that abortion is legal in all states on demand for any reason whatsoever up until pregnancy. Since then, states have placed restrictions on abortion, with the health of the mother being foremost among concerns, and the un­born child's being nonexistent. 
Though different polls show that most people favor freedom 


of choice, or death as it should be called, most people with whom I have conversed feel that abortion should not be used as a form of birth control. 
However, arguments in favor of abortion exist for so many "rare" cases, such as the health of the mother, rape, and incest. The first case is understand­ably a very touchy case; the second, very rare; the .latter, downright difficult. Yet another argument, a socioeconomic one, for abortion is that certain people cannot afford to raise another child. 
In my experiences as a pro­lifl~r. as a pt~rson growing up in Fort Worth's poverty-stricken north side, and as a student at­tending a predominantly black high school, I have witnessed how abortion is used and have developed my own beliefs about abortion with religion playing no part in my decision. 
The foundation for my beliefs, though I did not know at the time, came on April 28, 1974. I never knew before how much I loved my family until I became aware that one-third of it might never have come into this 
world.  My  younger  brother,  
now  a  sophomore  in  high

school, could have been another statistic. My mother had a diffi­cult time delivering babies, and quite honestly, did not think she could have children after she delivered me. So when she be­came pregnant five years later, it was great cause for worry. 
She experienced a lot of com­plications, and the doctors suggested that she have an abortion because it would probably come down to only one surviving the delivery. She and my father never had a doubt that it would come down to fate -whatever would hap­pen would happen. As it turned out, both of them are healthy, though my mother can no longer have children naturally. 
The other third of my family came into the Espino household on August 16, 1984, ten years after my younger brother. She, too, could have been aborted because her natural mother al­ready had 10 children and could not afford to have an-

other. However, since my mom wanted another child, she agreed to adopt this woman's next-born. We helped her out with maternity clothes and the hospital bills, and as it turned out, I have a bright, vivacious, younger sister, whom I love dearly. 
As for the other cases in which abortions are used ­convenience, rape, and incest­
· I feel that we were all fetuses at one time or another. We could have all been aborted. Maybe not legally, but what if our brothers, sisters, or even us, were one of those 4,400 aborted daily and 1,606,000 aborted yearly? 
To me, abortion is murder, and once we start making ex­ceptions for rape, incest, health to the mother, or any other cases, we are qualifying mur­der. We cannot do that. Thus, along with the National Right to Life President, Nellie Gray, we need support in enacting a Paramount Human Life Amendment that protects life from conception, a stage we all have endured. 

So, I urge the Notre Dame community to get more involved in pro-life work, be it through out Right to Life chapter, polit­ical lobbying and mar:ches, or even personal means. Let's all work for the most fundamental right of all -life.

LETTERS 
Sex involves taking responsibility for possible outcomes like childbirth 
Dear Editor: 
I am writing in response to Kurt Mills' Viewpoint article (The Observer, Jan. 23) con­cerning the Catholic Church's view on abortion. I feel that Mr. Mills has over-simplified the problem by reducing the issue of abortion to that of a woman's right to decide what to do with her own body. 
The woman is not the only human being involved in the consequences .of the decision; therefore, she should not be alone in the decision-making process. Although Mr. Mills felt compelled to take the liberty to dispel all noble and sincere in­tentions of fathering males, they are part of the process and de have rights: the right to sustain and, yes, care for the life which he has taken part in creating. 
Most importantly, he fails to even mention the rights of the unborn baby. Babies, in their earliest stages, do not have the capacity to exist independently but are nonetheless creations of God. The fact that unborn babies, helpless though they may be, do have human souls 
should cause us, as Christians, 
to take issue with the discon­
tinuance of their physical being. 
Another point that the author fails to explore is that women actually do exercise the right of choice when they choose to have sex. The writer's argu­ment that women should have the ultimate deeision is already solidified. A woman exercises her right whether or not to ab­stain from sex, and it is my personal belief that both men and women engaging in sex should realize the possible con­sequences of their action. 
Exercising the right of abor­tion after-the-faet is a cop-out. I am not a chauvi.nist who fails to recognize a female's rights, nor do I feel that any woman should be reduced to a baby' factory. I do feel, as a Catholic, that after a woman has chosen to engage in sex that the deci­sion then is forfeited to an almighty power much greater than you or I. So please, let God decide.

Graf escapes upset to advance to Australian Open final 
MELBOURNE, Australia (API -Steffi Graf, suddenly looking vulnerable, barely escaped an upset Thursday to reach the Australian Open finals along with calm and confident American teen-ager Mary Joe Fernandez. 
Graf's two-year reign as Australian Open champion al­most ended in a thrilling duel with Helena Sukova. but Graf rallied from a break down in thn final set to win. 6-3, 3-6, 6­
4. 
Fernandez, 18, beat Grafs nervous West German compa­triot. Claudia Porwik, 6-2. 6-1. and said she's not worried about facing the top player in womnn's tennis. 
Sukova, who broke Martina Navratilova's record 74-match winning streak in the Australian Open in 1984, al­most paid Graf back for beat­ing her in the finals last year. 
Graf. who stretched her per­sonal-best winning streak to 4 7, played sluggishly, missing shots and moving slower than usual, and was down a break at 2-1 in the final set. But Graf broke back and kept the set on serve at 5-4. 
Sukova, serving to tie the set, double-faulted and hit a fore­hand wide to lose the game and match. 
Graf had not dropped a set in 20 previous matches in the Australian Open and had beaten Sukova 14 times in a row. Graf lost to Sukova only once before -seven years ago when Grafwas 13. 

Sukova, 24, whose late mother, Vera, was a finalist at Wimbledon in 1962, was a fi­nalist here in 1984 and last year and a finalist at the 1986 
U.S. Open, but has yet to win a Grand Slam title. 
Fernandez, displaying a style reminiscent of Chris Evert ­the last American to reach the Australian finals -prowled the baseline and ripped passing shots by the net-charging Porwik. 
Fernandez, tall and lanky with a white sweat band around her forehead and her long, brown hair tied in a pony 
tail, raced through the match in 67 minutes. 
She said knew Porwik, 21, was nervous and took advan­tage of it. 
"You could tell after the first couple of games, she was shak­ing her racket and hitting the ball up," Fernandez said. "I tried to keep on top of her the whole match." 
"I was a little bit nervous playing in a semifinal for the first time in my life," Porwik admitted. "But really I think I was just too tired. I was physi­cally tired and mentally tired and made too many mistakes." 
Porwik hit 49 errors, 20 more than Fernandez. 
Fernandez grew up near Evert in Florida and saw her as a role model. Like Evert, she fashioned her game around a two-fisted backhand and solid groundstrokes. 

Fernandnz, now 18 and a pro since 14, has grown into a strong, 5-foot-8 player with an increasingly eiTective net game -better than Evert's at the same age. 
Though she randy went to the nnt against Porwik, Fernandez ended the match thern with a cross-court backhand volley. 
Fernandez' only lapse in the second set camn in the fourth game. a long, tnnse battln in which Porwik finally broke after ninn deuces and on lwr sixth break point. 
But Fernandnz broke right back and quickly put away the match by holding and brPaking Porwik again.

Denver Bronco quarterback John Elway has been taking some heat from four-time Super Bowl champion 
Terry Bradshaw as of late and has decided to return some. He believes Bradshaw is jealous of his lucrative 
contract and has refuted Bradshaw's criticism of him as a 'baby' who can't bring home a Super Bowl ring. 
Lott's hard hits earn him respect 
NEW OHLEANS (AP) -When Honnie Lott yells, the 49nrs lis­ten. When l.ott plays, other safeties watch. 
But mostly, when l.ott hits, receivers grimace. 
"lie should put together a highlight film of his greatest hits so people realize all the awesonw hits he's put on pno­ple," said Denver safety Dennis Smith, l.ott's close friend, who calls him "the Michael Jordan of defensive backs." 
A ynar ago, headlines during Super Bowl wm~k referred to him as the "aging l.ott." This season. tlwre's been a lot of talk about the "old man," who turns 31 in May. 
But despite missing five ganws with a right ankle sprain, l.ott has shown more than ever in the postseason that he remains the standard against which other safeties ­and team leaders -must be measured. 
His recent play even -inspired San Francisco coach George Seifert to invent a word. 
"Honnie l.ott is playing with even more quickness than I've 
Dayton 
continued from page 16 
"We plan on using the same 

type of ganw plan." said 
McGraw. "We might add a little 
more man-to-man pressure and 
we'll try to control the tempo of 
the game." 
Hobinson added that she 

hoped the Irish would continue 
their stellar performance 
seen," Seifert said. "lie seems to have had a 'fresh' is the way I might describe it -a fresh in his body." 
There will be a lot of Lott fans on the Broncos sideline Sunday in the Supnrdome. 
Smith, who room11d with him at Southern Cal. ealls himself "the poor man's Honnie Lott." Bookie free safety Steve Atwater idoliznd him so much in college that he had his pic­ture taken with him. And defen­sive coordinator Wade Phillips will seek out Lott immediately after the game to shake his hand, win or lose. 
"I have a great deal of admi­ration for him." Phillips said. "It's just niee to be around great players like that." 
Lott, according to Seifert, scums more committed than ever this season. The prime mo­tivating foree has been the 49ers' chance to repeat as Super Bowl champions. 
But what separates Lott from his peers is that he's never fully satisfied -not with his three 
Super Bowl rings, not with a 16-2 record, not with his repu­
against the 6-6 Lady Musketeers. She explained that Notre Dame would particularly have to stop junior guard Kim Blanton, an excellent outside shooter who is averaging 14.3 points per game. 
"The team's real positive after the Dayton game," said Hobinson of the injury-plagued Irish. "I hope it will carry over to our game against Xavier." 


tation for hard hits. Even his memory of his greatest hit -a fullspeed bullseye on Atlanta's William Andrews on a screen pass in 1982 -carries that moral.

Elway fights back after Bradshaw's criticisms 
OHI.EANS (APJ -Denver quar­terback John Elway, blisten~d by Hall of Fanwr Terry Bradshaw as being too sort. fired back Wednesday. 
Elway said Bradshaw had been critical of him throughout his career and that the ox­Pittsburgh quartPrback was jealous because of Elway's high salary. 
"lip can stick it in his ear," Elway said. 
Asked to comparn Hlway and San Francisco quarterbark Joe Montana. opponents in Sunday's Super Bowl, Bradshaw was partieularly critical of the Bronco passer. 
"The first thing I think of is Jon's got three Super Bowl rings," Bradshaw said. "John Elway is more eoneenwd about promoting himself than winning Super Bowls. lie's been babied. lie hasn't won any championships and that's the bottom line." 
Elway admitted that he is troubled by his 0-for-2 Sptler Bowl record. "To be the quar­terback I want to b1~ in my ea­rner. I've got to win this game," he said. 
Bradshaw won it four times. Montana is going for his fourth. 
From the time he played at Stanford, football people have rhapsodized over Elway's arm. !lis 98-yard drive to the win­ning touchdown for the 1986 AFC championship convinePd a lot of people but Bradshaw n~­mained unimpressed. 
''A lot of guys with gn~at arms have played this game." 
he said. "To be great, you've got to play well over the long hau I. Orw great game doesn't cut it for nw." 
Elway rPcognizns that tlw Super Bowl failun~s rPpn~sl'rlt a gap in his earPnr. "Not too many guys dassifil'd as gnat quarterbacks haven't won tlw championship," hn said. 
Bradshaw said, "I think things bother John morl' than tlwy bother .Joe. lie's got to w·t a little tougher nmotionally, a little touglwr nwntally." 
Th1~n Bradshaw rnferrml to Elway's salary. 
"lie's making $2 million a year," Bradshaw said. "llnll, things don't hotlwr you wlwn you making $2 million a year. Wait until you get out and haw to get a job. It will botlwr you then. You haVP to g~t touglwr. 
"John's problem is he's been babied -you know, babiPd by the city until this year and ba­bied by the eoaeh a little bit. It's just too easy. And you know what I went through in Pittsburgh. Then~·s nothing worse than just gBtting ham­mered. You fight that stuff. I

tougher."

"ll was a ndaxed, comfortable m1wt that allowt>d us to gnt polished bnforP thesP upcoming mnHs." said Irish head coach Tim WPlsh. "It was a confidence building win." 
In thP sixth meeting between thn two tnams. the nwn overpowered their opporwnts 135-79. with victories in eight events. The men raised their snason record to 8-1 and the series mcord against UIC to 6-0. 
Among the eight first place finishes, Ed Veome dominated the diving events. taking both thH three-and onn-nwter contests. Senior captain Torn Penn won the

Phelps said. "There are not

thought the tnam played with a

Added co-captain .Iamere Jackson. "We just fell like we needed everyone to go out and play to his potential. We have listened to a lot of criticism and we take it as an insult. We're just going to go out and play our game. The bottom line is the guys on the floor have to play to their potential." 
One player who performed to 

his potential was senior Scott 
Paddock. He tied two career­

highs with 13 points and 12 
rebounds and was a force off 
the Irish bench. Paddock had

50-yard freestyle with a tim, of 22.10 and senior Bill Jackoboice captured the 100-yard freestyle in 48.09. 
"We're on a roll right now, and we're trying to keep it going through the weekend," said senior Dave Thoman, a member of the winning 200­yard medley relay team. Thoman. John Godfrey, Ed Broderick. and Jackoboice took the event with a time of 1:40.00. 
The women's team upped their season record to 6-4 
shot in turning in his best pPrformance of the seasou. 
Five other Notre Damn players hit double figures. LaPhonso Ellis led the team with 15 points followed by Elmer Bnnnett with 13, Daimon Sweet and Joe Fredrick with 11 and Keith Hobinson with 10. 
It was a pleasant breakthrough for Bennett. who had scored just 15 points in thn last five games combined. Against the Shockers, he hit five-of-nine field goals and two­of-two free throws. 
"For the last few games on the road I wasn't a factor," Bennett said. "Tonight I decided I had to come out and look for my shot." 
John Cooper led the Shockers with a game-high 22 points and was joined in double figures by Gayton Nickerson with 18 and Lance Kroll with 10. 
The Shockers jumped to a 7-3 advantage early in the game, with an impressive win over UIC, by the score of 128­103. 
Frnshman sPnsation Tanya Williams helpnd lead tho Irish with two victoriPs, in the 1650-yard frenstyle 
(17:41.48) and the 200-yard individual mndlt~y (2:11.41). Jenny Kipp, who qualified for the Zone Diving Meet last weeknnd. won the thren­meter and one-metnr diving nvents with point scorns of 224.85 and 230.55. 
In other first place finishes, Amy Tri was victorious in the 200-yard breaststroke and Shana Stephens, Tracie O'Connell. Christine Van Patten and Katherine Andrew combined to take the 200-yard medley relay. 
"This meet was .good for us, because it let us experiment in certain events, and gavn experience for championship meets," Welsh said. "It was a team preparation meet, getting us ready for three intensn wnekends." 

but the Irish ran off 13 straight points for a 16-7 lead. They increased that margin to 38-24 at the half. 
Notre Dame kept the momentum in the second half, building the lead to 62-36 with 
11:53 rernarnrng. That advantage was 73-50 with 6:44 to play when Wichita State made a run. 
The Shockers pulled to 85-75. but Tim Crawford hit two frne throws for Notre Dame with 
1:01 left to seal the victory. 

NOTES -Phelps downplayed his 400th victory. but he joined an elite crowd. Coming into this season, just 19 active coaches had won 400 games. Phelps picked up his victories in 19 years at Notre Dame (37 4-170) and one year at Fordham (26­3). His biggest win? Over DePaul in the 1978 NCAA Regional. That 84-64 win lifted the Irish into the Final Four, Notre Dame's only appearance.

I guess I have to make some mention of the Super Bowl. It wouldn't surprise me at all if 
Denver actually makes a game of this thing. It's hard to believe that the 49ers can play almost perfect football for three consecutive games. 

But the 49ers have just too much talent to let this slip away from them. In a close game, look for a late San Francisco score to seal an 11-point win.

ND beats Shockers to get back on track 
By GREG GUFFEY 
Assistant Sports Editor 
If the first step is the biggest and most impor­tant, then the Notre Dame men's basketball team is !waded in the right direction.

It was a ganw the Irish were supposed to win and 11111' that the Irish nePdf'd to win. Coming off a disappointing 3-:~ roadtrip. Notre Dame fi­nally got things to click -at least for 34 min­uti's. 
Tlw Irish dominatml for the first 34 minutes, building a 73-50 l!'ad. Tlwy suffered a letdown in which the Shockers cut the margin to 10 at H5-75 but hit key fn~e throws to get the win. 
"It was a big lift because we wern kind of down." Notre Dame freshman Monty Williams said. "We knew w!' had the talent, and we just executed w~ry well tonight." 
Said co-captain Joe Fredrick, "Every win now is big. That's how we look at it. We had total confidnnce we wer11 going to put it together. The support we had at the game tonight was just gn1at."

Women's basketball downs Flyers 
Robinson, Davis keep the Irish undefeated in the MCC

Some nights, ev11rything clicks. 
Thl' ml'mbers on the Notn~ Dame wonwn's baskntball team understood that feeling Tuesday night as thP Irish unitnd for an H5-60 trouncing of the Dayton Flyers. 
Irish head eoaeh Muffet McGraw and guard Karen Hobinson noted two key factors that allowed the Irish to dominate the 6-9 Flyers. 
McGraw praised her team's excellent shooting and intensity throughout the blowout, while Hobinson emphasized the bal­ance of the Irish attack. 
"Everyone contributed," said Robinson, who with teammate Krissi Davis led Notre Dame's scoring with 21 points. 
The junior trio of Robinson, 
llalfway through a college basketball season where apparently nobody wants to reside in the Top 10, here are a few observations. 
It's about time that people finally start mentioning the Big Eight in the same sentence with the Big Ten, ACC and Big East. With Missouri, Kansas Steve Megargee and Oklahoma, the Big Eight 

has thrnP teams with legit-Associate Sports Editor imate Final Four potential. 
The Big Eight glory might not last long. but for now it's on a par with the three elite conferences. 
Is 
thnre a better unknown player than Oregon State's Gary Payton? A point guard who can score with the game's best, Payton just may lead the Heavers to a Pac-10 championship. 

The 
nation's best unknown team just might be New Mexico State, which had lost only one game en­tering the week and already has defeated Big West rival Nevada-Las Vegas. 


 Paul Westhead must breed scorers at Loyola had outstanding games to pace the Irish. Davis and Liebscher nach had eight rebounds while Liebscher directed the Notre Dame offense with 11 assists. 
EveryonP scored for the Irish, while four members finished in double figures. Liebscher con­tributed 10 points while Lisa Kuhns had 11. including Notre Dame's only three-pointer. Kuhns continues to lead the NCAA in that category. 
While commending the overall play of the team, McGraw felt that accurate shooting keyed the Irish win. 
"We had good shot selection and made the shots," said McGraw of the 10-5 Irish. "It was excellent execution, the besneam shooting we've had." 
Notre Dame converted 56 percent of their field goals. The Irish were ranked 16th nation­ally in that category last week

LaPhonso Ellis' 15 points led the Notre Dame men's basketball team to a 88-78 win over visiting Wichita State Wednesday night. The win gave Irish head coach Digger Phelps his 400th career victory. 
Marymount. The Lions lose Hank Gathers, last year's leading national scorer and rebounder, to an injury, and they don't miss a beat. Bo Kimble simply steps in and jumps to the top of the national rank­ings in scoring. 
Loyola coach Paul Westhead just breeds scorers. 
While Loyola Marymount and Oklahoma are the undisputed kings of offense, nobody may play better defense than Alabama. Over the winter holidays, the Crimson Tide held patsy Baptist College to six points in a half. In a game with Southeastern Conference rival Georgia, the Tide leads 21-9 after about 16 minutes. 
Then, the day after LSU steamrolls Notre Dame, the Tide tame the Tigers 70-55 while holding Chris Jackson to 11 points. That Alabama win came at home in the "Plaid Palace," so-called in honor of Tide coach Wimp Sanderson's tastes in fashion. The Tide loses in the Palace about as often as Bill Curry beats Auburn. 
I'm starting to get the feeling that Bobby Cremins could put Dennis Scott, Brian Oliver and Kenny Anderson on the court by themselves, and Georgia Tech still could field a tournament team playing ev­erybody 3-on-5. It seems like those three guys are standing with their perfor­mance against the Flyers. 
Notre Dame's consistency ex­tended to the free throw line. The Irish made 12 of 16 from the charity stripe while Davis and Liebscher were perfect. 
McGraw also noted that the Irish were hot from the begin­ning against the Flyers. 
"We scored on our first eight possessions and I think we led 17-4 at one point," McGraw commented. "Fortunately, our intensity never let up." 
McGraw added that Notre Dame had been having prob­!ems maintaining intensity when they were winning, yet the level of concentration never fell Tuesday night. The Irish hope to continue that type of play tonight when the travel to Cincinnati to face another MCC 
rival, Xavier. Freshman guard Coquese Washington helped the Notre Dame women's basketball team r;:lobber MCC opponent Dayton, 85-60. The 
Tech's only players anyhow. 
What 
in the name of Flutie is wrong with the Boston College athletic department. Hemember just about four or five years ago, when BC football regu­larly fielded bowl teams and the hoops squad con­sistently reached the Sweet 16'? Now both programs have gone to hell in handbasket at about the same time. 

You 
have to feel pity for Don DeVoe, who never should have gotten fired at Tennessee last ynar. Now he gets the job at Florida and inherits a bunch of undisciplined hacks only Lawrence FundPrburkP could admire. Livingston Chatman quits, then Dwayne Schintizius earns himself a suspension for participating in another fight (reports indicate he did not bring a tennis racket along this time). 


Nonetheless. don't be surprised if the· Orlando Magic pull Schintzius out of the hat in the NBA draft. With Dave Corzine injured, the only center in Orlando is named EPCOT. 
I guess if you're in the statn of Minnesota, home is the best place to be. First the Twins and now the Gophers -they do no wrong at home and can't buy a
