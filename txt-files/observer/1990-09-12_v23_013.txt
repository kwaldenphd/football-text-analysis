President Bush is shown working on his speech in the Oval Office of the White House Tuesday. Bush addressed a joint session of Congress on the Persian Gulf crisis Tuesday night. 
'Teach-in' announced by peace coalition 
By CORINNE PAVLIS 
SMC Editor 
The coalition for Peace and Justice, a conglomeration of six local peace groups, has an­nounced that a "Teach-In" will be held on Sunday, September 23 to discuss the crisis in the Middle East. 
The Coalition was created when Pledge of Resistance, NOW, Sane-Freeze, WILPF, Cit­izens of Hope, and the UN As­sociation merged to address the crisis. 
The Teach-In will include leaders from the six groups and the former national head of Sane Freeze who now works at the Notre Dame Peace Institute. 
The goal of the panel discus­sion is to invite experts on the subject, such as historical ex­pert Patrick Gaffney, to come in and share their knowledge. The Teach-In will run from 1:30-6:00 p.m at the First United Methodist Church on Main St. in South Bend. 
Peter Smith, a Saint Mary's mathematics professor, has been actively involved in the planning and execution of the Coalition events. Smith, head of

Bush says US policy on Iraq cannot be changed 
WASHINGTON -(AP) Presi­dent Bush said his heart went out to the families of the hun­dreds of Americans held hostage by Iraq, but he de­clared, "Our policy cannot change, and it will not change. America and the world will not be blackmailed." 
The address was Bush's third appearance before Congress during his 20 months in office. He was greeted by prolonged applause from those assembled in the House chamber, including the Congress and his Cabinet. Also in the audience were the ambassador from Iraq, Mo­hamed Sadiq Al-Mashat, and the ambassador from the con­quered nation, Kuwaiti Ambassador Sheik Saud Nasir Al-Sabah. 
Bush said that if the United States had not reacted swiftly to Iraq's invasion, it would have been "a signal to actual and potential despots around the world.... America must stand up to aggression, and we will," he said. 
"And one thing more -in pursuit of these goals, America will not be intimidated," Bush said. "Vital issues of principle are at stake. Saddam Hussein is literally trying to wipe a country off the face of the Earth. We do not exaggerate. Nor do we exaggerate when we say, Saddam Hussein will fail." 
Bush told Congress there were high costs involved in the showdown that "conservation efforts are essential to keep our energy needs as low as possible." 
He also hinted that the United States could dip into its Strategic Petroleum Reserve "if conditions warrant." The reserve is the nation's 590 million-barrel stockpile of oil. 
Bush called on Congress to pass legislation this month to spur domestic energy produc­tion and foster conservation. 
In particular, Bush cited tax incentives for domestic oil and gas exploration, fuel­switching and acceleration of oil drilling in Alaska "without damage to the wildlife." 
Bush used the speech to ex­plain anew the high stakes for the United States in the oil­rich Middle East. 
He said Iraq, by itself, con­trolled 10 percent of the world's petroleum reserves and doubled its holdings by invading Kuwait. If Ir·aq had gone unchallenged, Bush said, it would be able "to intimidate and coerce its neighbors ­neighbors who control the lion's share of the world's re­maining oil reserves. 
"We cannot permit a re­source so vital to be dominated by one so ruthless. And we won't," the president said. 
He said there was an un­precedented level of world co­operation against Iraq, with armed forces from many countries united to deter any attack on Saudi Arabia.

Members of the Coalition for Peace and Justice held a protest march Friday in South Bend. The coalition hoped to bring attention to the need for UN involvement in the Middle East conflict to replace U.S. forces. 
Russian parliament endorses sweeping economic reforms 
MOSCOW (AP) -Russia's parliament voted overwhelm­ingly Tuesday for a radical economic reform program, and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev said he favored it over a moderate plan proposed by his prime minister. 
Gorbachev's surprise state­ment undercut the authority of Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov and added momentum to calls for Ryzhkov's resignation. 
It also increased the chances that the radical plan, drafted largely by economist Stanislav Shatalin, will go into effect throughout the Soviet Union. 
Shatalin 's plan calls for transferring most economic authority from the national government to the country's 15 constituent republics. The republics could then move rapidly to free prices, privatize government industries, legalize private ownership of land and take other steps toward a market­based economy. 
The national Supreme Soviet legislature and the parliament of Russia, the largest of the 15 republics, met separately Tuesday to consider the competing proposals. 
Ryzhkov addressed the na­tional legislature in a cav­ernous marble hall at the Kremlin, the centuries-old walled fortress that is the seat of communist power. 
He charged that the Shatalin plan would lower living stan­dards by 30 percent, force one out of every four collective farms into bankruptcy, and cause rapid inflation by decontrolling prices on about 7 5 percent of basic consumer products. 
Ryzhkov called for retaining central control over the econ-

INSIDE COLUMN 
Who said Notre Dame is homogenous? 
Confession: I'm in 
--------­way over my head. As a writer, I make a great cartoonist. In desperate need of a topic this afternoon, I went to the Huddle. My hope was that the students there would inspire me. As I sat in Jay Hosler my booth, the ideas slowly began to pre-Staff Cartoonist cipitate. 
The first thought I had was to write about the guy sitting directly to my right. This re­fined young college male sat there shoveling food into his mouth in an appalling porcine frenzy. This topic, however, seemed a little off-color so I decided it had no place in my article. 
Fortunately, this culinary cacophony did make me look up from the blank sheet in front of me. Suddenly I saw the Huddle like I had never seen it before. I was surrounded by various camps of Notre Dame students. 
The first that I noticed was a group I call the Eco-chic (EC). These granola chomping, nouveu-environmentalists have become Earth's mega-hip saviors. Of course, they might be sincere. Oops! Maybe not. I just saw one of them throw an aluminum can into the regular trash. (Honest) 
Across the way, two tables of the J. Crew Crowd (JCC) are sitting around discussing their latest mail-order mania. Their lives are simple; look ultra-swanky and hang out with your own kind. Near them are sitting five Polo-people (PP). 
These folks are a little more aloof than the JCC. That's because their clothes cost more. The JCC knows this and they spend their time kissing up to the PP (the JCC secretly hates the PP, but realizes they may have to work for them some day). 
Off in the corner, I noticed a small group of the Dead!Rastafarians (DR). I can't tell how many there are beacause they're lost in a mass of off the rack tie-dyes and funny smoke. They seem to be making fun of the JCC and PP. 
The JCC and PP, in turn, are throwing aerosol cans at the EC who are casting aspersions on the JCC, PP, EC, and the Euro-Hip (EH) and Jocks (J) that just 
walked in. 

So what's the point of this student body taxonomy? In the final evaluation, I guess it's a weak analogy to the fragmenting American scene. Special interest groups and all that stuff. But the big point of this is a warning. 
I left one group unmentioned; the Dorks. A wily and subversive lot, they are the ones that have been the charter members in groups like the JCC, PP, EC, EH, DR, and J. Why? Divide and conquer, of course. 
While they've got everybody else worrying about what to wear and how to act, dork operatives are infiltrating the highest eche­lons of society. Don't believe me? Take a look at Bush, Quayle and the administrators here at Notre Dame. Or, should I say Notre Dork?

The state doesn't have to pay the cost of desegregating Indianapolis schools, a federal judge has ruled. U.S. District Judge S. Hugh Dillin dismissed a motion by the Indianapolis Public Schools on Monday which sought $67 million in additional state funding for programs and staff. "You're falling down on the job," Dillin said during a pre-trial conference, referring to disci­plinary problems and low test scores in the dis­trict. "I don't know whose fault it is except IPS.' Six Marion County townships that receive black students from IPS have been receiving state de­segregation funds since Dillin ordered cross-dis­trict busing in 1981.

Senior Bar announces new hours 
page 3 

By JOE GODIN 
News Writer 
The Alumni Senior Club and the Graduate Student Union (GSU) have designated 5 to 9 
p.m. Friday nights at the Club for graduate students, faculty and staff members only. 
But, on Fridays before home football games, the Club will open at 9 p.m. and undergrad­uates will be admitted. 
Lawrence Briggs, manager of the Club, has been working for a couple of years on a way to involve graduate students with undergraduate social life. Last summer he met with represen­tatives from the Graduate Stu­dent Union to try to get some­thing going for graduate stu­dents. 
"We felt that the Alumni Se­nior Club had the right facilities to give graduates, faculty, and staff a place to go to and be social at," Briggs said. 
"The GSU is concerned that not enough is going for them [graduate students]. Notre Dame wants them to get in­volved in student life, " he said. "Right now, the undergradu­ates are the school. Notre Dame wants the graduates to feel a part of the Notre Dame family. I'm here to help them achieve that goal." 
The decision about desig­nated hours was made by Briggs and the GSU. The GSU requested that the hours be 5 to 9 p.m. to give the opportunity for social and intellectual interaction for graduate stu­dents, faculty and staff. 
About sixty people were pre­sent the inauguration of the hours, according to Briggs. "The graduates really enjoyed it. Hopefully it will pick up once the word gets out and people know about this," he said. 
The president of the GSU also had an optimistic view of the first night. "From what we have heard it has been a big success and will improve sec­ond semester when there are no home football games," said Raynold Messiva, president of the GSU. 
One graduate student was in­different to the opening of the bar exclusively to graduates. "They haven't marketed it very well. It won't make much dif­ference because the graduates can go anytime they want," said Jared des Rosiers, a second year law student. 
Nonetheless, both the GSU and Briggs are optimistic about the future of the weekly activity. "We believe that the bar will become a fixture in the future of graduate student activity," said Messiva. "The first night was fair and as time goes on it should get better." said Briggs. 
Briggs has been the full-time manager of the Club for four years. Before he became man­ager, the bar was run by stu­dents. The bar, located beyond the football stadium, is open Wednesday through Saturday at 9 p.m. and serves lunch on Fridays.

Panel says US should withdraw its troops 
By JEFF SWANSON 
News Writer 

Robert Johansen, Senior Fel­low of the Institute for Inter­national Peace Studies, called for the the gradual withdrawal of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia and the replacement of those troops with UN peace keeping forces. · 
"With a predominantly U.S. force there, it is too easy for some to see this as a U.S. effort against Iraq rather than as a universal norm being upheld by the world community against one deviant actor, the Iraqi government," said Johansen. 
Johansen and David Cor­tright, a visiting faculty profes­sor of the Peace Institute, spoke about the crisis in a panel discussion on Tuesday titled, "Assessing the Middle East Conflict: What Are the Op­tions?" 
Johansen argued that if the predominantly U.S. force was replaced with a UN peace keep­ing force, Hussein would be more likely to back down. "He could back down in the name of being a good international citi­zen," said Johansen. 
Cortright also argued that the 
U.S. force should be replaced. He said, "I believe that it is essential that the U.S. halt its military buildup, pursue a peaceful negotiated solution to the crisis and begin to with­draw American forces in favor of an Arab or UN peace keeping presence." 
Cortright said, "There is no military solution to this crisis." He said that a negotiated solu­tion is in the best interests of the thousands of hostages in Iraq and Kuwait. 
Johansen said that a war would be very costly and that it probably would not be over soon. He said that the U.S.

"4Y. Association 

would probably lose interna­tional support if it launched an offensive strike and that the gains of such an attack would be unclear. 
Cortright questioned the mo­tive of the military buildup. "The President is prepared to spill American blood, and Arab blood too, to protect our grossly extravagant and wasteful consumption of oil in this country, " he said. 
Cortright said, "The U.S. can do without oil from the Middle East entirely if we really get se­rious about energy consump­tion at home." 
Both Johansen and Cortright agreed that an international force would be appropriate to secure the Persian Gulf re­gion. "I would submit that the best way to support our troops is to move toward a negotiated peaceful solution and to begin to replace American soldiers with a genuine multinational peace keeping presence," said Cortright

Doe's murder makes 



Liberian crisis worse 

APPhoiO

Call for war 
Demonstrators carry a large placard that calls for all people to join the effort for a Jihad, or holy war, during a protest rally in Baghdad, Monday. The protest eventually marched on the American Embassy in Baghdad. 
MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) ­Troops loyal to slain President Samuel Doe bombarded rebels from atop the executive man­sion Tuesday, and a West African leader said Doe's death would make it more difficult to end the war. 
TWo days after rebels led by Prince Johnson attacked Doe and his entourage at the headquarters of the West African task force, the late president's men used heavy cannons to beat back insurgents. 
Throughout Monrovia, shells exploded and gunfire crackled as Prince Johnson's fighters scoured the city for Doe loyal­ists. 
Survivors from Doe's elite presidential guard turned heavy artillery, placed on the roof of the seaside executive mansion, onto the rebels and the war-ravaged city. The guns normally face out toward the Atlantic Ocean. 
Gambian President Sir Dawda Jawara said Doe's men had asked the five-nation West African force to help them evacuate the capital. Jawara said aid would be offered on humanitarian grounds .. 
"I think it is now urgent to try and do something about protecting these 230 or so Doe supporters from factional or tribal revenge," said Jawara, chairman of the 16-member Economic Community of West African States. 
The Community ordered a 3,000-member task force into Liberia last month to help quell the 8 1/2-month-old civil war, often marked by tribal fighting. The soldiers are from Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Gambia. 
Jawara, who was visiting Zimbabwe, said that rather than speeding the war's end, Doe's death Monday likely would increase bloodshed. 
Witnesses said Doe's muti­lated body was on display at Johnson's headquarters outside the city. Johnson had said Doe would be court­martialed, but within a day of his capture Sunday he was reported dead from gunshot wounds. 
The West African force com­mander, Lt. Gen. Arnold Quainoo of Ghana, said Tuesday that 78 people were killed when Johnson's men at­tacked Doe's entourage on Sunday. Among the dead was Defense Minister Brig. Gen. J. Boima Barclay. 
Quainoo said in a statement 
Doe told him he had come to express his surprise that Quainoo had not paid him a courtesy call. 
The statement said: "General Doe talked at length to the effect that he was not ready to submit the sovereignty of his country to any power or indeed regional organization."

the Pledge of Resistance, is one of the organizers for next weeks Teach-In. He described the six main goals for the event: 
 
The Historical background of the area 

 
The economical concerns for American dependence on Middle Eastern oil 

 
The historical role of the United nations. 

 
American military role and options 

 
Possible peace keeping tac­tics 

 
The social and economic costs of U.S. involvement 


"Our main goal and topic of discussion for the event is nego­tiation, not confrontation," stated Smith. Other events with this same goal included a press conference and march last week. The press conference, held last Tuesday, outlined the Coalition's eight main policy goals:

and discuss issues of similar and different perspective. 
This is a two-session program. Each session will be offered twice. In Session I couples will take the inventory. 
 
The U.S. will not make a first strike. This would include the invasion of Iran since the function of U.S. presence is to defend. 

 
Organized negotiations be­tween the U.N and Arab Coun­tries.

Replacement of U.S. troops with UN forces 

 
Development of a national alternative energy policy to re­duce American dependence of Middle Eastern oil 

 
Condemnation of the im­plicit racism and sexism which currently exists in U.S. armed forces and the Middle East. 

 
Establishing self-determina­tion for all people in the region. 

 
Urging for a meeting of conflict resolution experts to work with President Bush, Congress, and the media to look for alternatives to the present military solution.

march last Friday. Participants met at the Viet Nam Veterans Memorial in Howard Park. The groups marched through South Bend carrying the UN flag to symbolize the "focus on the need for involvement of the UN" said Smith. 
The march ended at the busy Federal Building in downtown South Bend as city employees were getting off work. The marchers received a police escort though no problems arose. The event ended as the marchers sang "We Shall Over­come" in unison. 
Smith hopes that the march, as well as the press conference and scheduled Teach-In will in­crease awareness and involve­ment in the area. 
"I would like to see SMC women learn as much as they can about the issue so that they can call or write the White House to urge President Bush to pull out U.S. troops in favor of UN peace keeping task force," Smith said.

omy and making a much slower transition to a market­based system. He recommended keeping price controls on most food and household products while raising the cost of some major items, such as televisions, ra­dios and refrigerators. 
He also said imports of con­sumer goods and medicines would have to be cut by one­third because of a shortage of hard currency, and he warned that the government budget would have to be cut to prevent the $96 billion deficit from ballooning. 
Ryzhkov's speech caused commotion in the hall as some delegates, led by Anatoly Sobchak, the reformist mayor of Leningrad, demanded copies of the Shatalin plan and the opportunity to adopt it. 
"If you ask me, I like the Shatalin plan better," Gor­bachev told the delegates in an animated, 15-minute speech about the need to stabilize the Soviet economy, which is plagued by shortages of bread, meat, paper, gasoline, tobacco and other ordinary goods. 
"If there is a real plan to stabilize finances, money circulation, the ruble and the market, then we should adopt the Shatalin idea," Gorbachev said. 
Pounding the back of his hand on the lectern, the 59­year-old Soviet leader defended the concept of a free market, which is little understood and much feared by ordinary Soviet citizens. 
When price controls are gradually lifted, he said, "we'll have real prices that will esti­mate who is worth what. Then powerful stimuli will be re­leased for structural changes. 
"Of course these will be painful changes. But so be it," he said.

Mann again emphasized that Humphrey is only one of eight suspects in the five gruesome slayings of the students. Four were enrolled at the University of Florida, the fifth victim was a student at Santa Fe Community College. 
"This search does not denote that Edward Humphrey is 'the' suspect, and the only suspect," he said. "A lot of resources have been poured into suspects just as important as him." 
Humphrey became a suspect in the slayings through a can­va.s of the off-campus student apartment areas where the victims Jived. 


GAINESVILLE, Fla.-(AP) In­
vestigators seeking the killer 
of five college students called 
for military help Tuesday to 
comb 10 square miles of 
woodland where a suspect 
reportedly went on nighttime 
"reconnaissance missions." 

Authorities would say only that they have a "good idea" of what they are looking for, and that the search could strengthen or weaken the case against 18-year-old University of Florida freshman Edward Humphrey. 
"This is based upon some information that he enjoyed being in the woods, that he may have camped out, and enjoyed being solitary in wooded areas," said police spokeswoman Lt. Sadie Darnell. "We don't want any information to go unchecked." 
Several hundred members of the Florida National Guard, along with reserve Army and Navy units, were being called up to assist in the search of several heavily wooded,

The Hall Presidents' Council announced at yesterday's meet­ing that it will be sponsoring a charity smorgasborg which will benefit a local charity as well as a tragedy-stricken graduate student and his family. 
The smorgasborg, to be held September 28 on Holy Cross Field, will be supplied by off­campus caterers. The price of food at the event will be a quar­ter. 
Half of the proceeds will be donated to the Women's Care Center in South Bend. The other half will be donated to the family of Zheng-de Wang, a Notre Dame graduate student who was injured in a hit and run accident last October and remains in a coma.

Paul Radich, a representative from the World Hunger Coali­tion, announced that sign-ups for the Wednesday lunch fasts will be held from Wednesday to Friday of this week. Those who volunteer will donate their lunches every Wednesday for the semester. 
Radich said that the Univer­sity Food Services donate a percentage of the cost of the meals not eaten, approximately one dollar per meal. He said to remember that this amount "is worth a lot more" in the coun­tries targeted for donations. 
Bubba Cunningham, Ticket and Merchandising Manager for the JACC, asked the Council for feedback on ideas concern­ing revised seating accomada­tions at Men's Varsity Basket­ball games. An idea proposed was to have seating on the floor for 600 students to promote "a Duke-like atmosphere," but nothing definite was settled. 
Also announced was that the football pep rally will be this Friday at 7pm in the JACC. The four captains of the team will speak, and Coach Holtz will in­troduce the squad.

Panel says no to anti­obscenity 

WASHINGTON (AP) -A bi­partisan study commission on Monday urged Congress not to impose new anti-o.bscenity re­strictions on the National En­dowment for the Arts, declar­ing that Americans must "put up with much we do not like" to preserve freedom of artistic expression. 
The 12-member panel also urged NEA chairman John Frohnmayer to scrap a controversial requirement that grant recipients sign a pledge that they will not use federal money to produce works that might be deemed 
obscene. 

Frohnmayer has repeatedly resisted demands that he eliminate the pledge, which has created a furor in the arts community, until federal courts rule on lawsuits challenging its con­stitutionality. He refused com­ment on the commission's re­port. 
At the same time, the com­mission proposed a major overhaul of the endowment's grant-making procedures to ensure that the NEA serves the interests of the American public and not a narrow constituency of artists. 
The panel concluded that "the endowment is not, in setting policy and making grants, adequately meeting its public responsibilities at the present time" as steward of taxpayer funds. 
It proposed that the NEA chairman be given sole, explicit authority to make final grant decisions and that the growing power of "peer review panels" that select grant applications for approval be diminished to an advisory role. 
The 94-page report of the commission, established by Congress last fall, drew mixed reviews from lawmakers trying to negotiate a compromise bill that would extend the endowment's life beyond Sept. 30, when its statutory authority expires.

Troop ceilings may be omitted in treaty 
MOSCOW (AP) -The United States and the Soviet Union, eager to conclude a conven­tional forces treaty by year's end, may drop provisions limiting troops in Europe, a senior U.S. official said Tuesday. 
Such a move would leave only one stumbling block to finishing the accord -a prospective ban on non­nuclear aircraft. The official said that provision may be dropped as well. 
"We have the clock ticking," he said. "We're getting to the point where we are going to have to wrap this up." 
A 35-nation summit confer­ence to sign the treaty is being planned in Paris in mid­November. The pact is being negotiated in Vienna between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. 
The official spoke to re­porters, here with Secretary of State James Baker, one day before the victorious World War II allies take a historic step to reunite the Germany they defeated 45 years ago. 
A dispute over missile launchers in what is now East Germany -which threatened to delay eventual German sovereignty, was resolved on the eve of the ceremony, West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said without providing details. 
The conventional forces treaty would set limits on tanks. artillery and other non­nuclear weapons -and on non-nuclear aircraft unless they are dropped from the treaty. 
"Aircraft and manpower have been very difficult," said the official, who requested anonymity. "So we are consid­ering removing limits on air­craft as well." 
The Soviets have argued that some of their planes the United States wants scrapped have defensive missions and should not be limited.

Law school entertains students 
Mrs. Erma Veith was driving home one day after dropping her husband off at work. Suddenly, she saw a small, bright UFO land on the back of the car in front of her. She fol­lowed the UFO for three or four blocks. At this point she became aware that God was driving her car, so she let go of the steering wheel. Her car drifted left into the wrong lane. Mrs. Veith saw a large truck heading for her, and stomped on the accelerator. She did this in order to become airborne (she knew she could fly "because Batman does it"). Much to her surprise, Mrs. Veith did not become airborne until after hitting the truck head-on. 
Where would you expect to hear a story like Mrs. Veith's? The National Enquirer? Geraldo? Monty Python? The Notre Dame Law School? 
People often think of law schools as dull, dusty places. They think of ivy covered halls occupied by ivy covered profes­sors and greedy, humorless students. Not so. The study of law acquaints students with more weirdness and comedy than any other discipline. The strange case of Erma Veith, for instance, is read by first year law students across the country every year in Torts class. 
Mrs. Veith is not the only character to entertain law stu­dents. Mrs. Rush, a rather hefty lady, went out to use her land­lord's outhouse one day. Unfortunately, she fell through the floor of the outhouse and, in the words of the court 
R1ck Acker In My Opinion 

"descended about nine feet into the accumulation at the bottom, and had to be extricated by use of a ladder." The landlord argued that she shouldn't be allowed to sue because fat ladies assume the risk of falling through outhouse floors. 
Another entertaining legal theory was presented by Mr. Menlove's attorney in the fa­mous old case of Vaughan v. Menlove. Menlove had been piling dry hay on his property for several months. Vaughan, whose house was near the hay pile, repeatedly warned Menlove of the obvious fire hazard. Sure enough, the hay caught fire one day and burned down Vaughan's house. Vaughan sued Menlove for negligence. Menlove's attorney argued that Menlove couldn't have been negligent because he was too stupid to know better. No points for guessing that Menlove lost. 
Several members of Monty Python's Flying Circus went to law school before going into weird humor (two fields more closely related than one might think). When one reads some of the old English cases, one can see how inspiring they could be to a slightly twisted sense of humor. One "Pythonesque" gem is Blandford v. Andrews, de­cided in 1599. Blandford wanted to marry a girl named Bridget Palmer, and Andrews promised to convince Bridget to wed Blandford by a certain date. Before that date, Blandford went up to Bridget and, as the court put it, "called her whore; and told her, that if he married her, he would tie her to a post; and used other opprobrious words unto her." Not surprisingly, Andrews could not convince Bridget to marry Blandford. What is surprising is that Blandford sued Andrews for not arranging the wedding as promised. Even more surprisingly, Blandford won because the judge felt that Andrews hadn't tried hard enough. 
Sometimes old cases are worth reading not only for the stories they tell, but for the way they tell them. Dickes v. Fenne, decided in 1639 by England's highest court, provides a good example. Fenne stood outside Dickes' place of business and "having communication with some of the Customers of the Plaintiff. who was a Brewer, said, That he would give a peck of malt to his mare and she should pisse as good beare as Dickes doth Brew." 
Law students are taught what is called the "common law," but some of it is definitely uncom­mon. Many of the people who show up in court are walking violations of the laws of nature, but as one judge put it, "this court does not enforce those laws." 
Rick Acker is a second year law student and a regular Viewpoint columnist.

Notre Dame community assists prevention of needless deaths 
Dear Editor: 

As you walk past a pond, you see a child drowning. No one else is around. If you wade in, you can save her, but if you don't, no one will know you were there. Is it your responsi­bility to save the child? If you feel that it isn't, you need not read any further. 
You see your responsibility is to save the child, because the child's death is needless and it is within your power to prevent it. However, we have all been ignoring preventable deaths by not combatting famine. 
The Notre Dame community is now, in its own small way, making an effort to help defeat hunger. If you are willing to skip your Wednesday lunch, the dining halls will donate the cost of your food to small, grass­roots development projects overseas. Posters in the dorms and the dining halls display let­ters sent from the project sites in Bangladesh, the Philippines, Argentina, and other countries, thanking the past participants here on campus. Over the past two years, we have raised over $9,000 to send to these pro­jects. 
Friday is the final day to sign up for the Wednesday Lunch Fast. Please consider skipping a meal, so that others may eat and build for a better future.

"Open Forum" allows personal participation on gamut of issues 
Dear Editor: 

Beginning this Thursday, September 13, 1990, the Ideas and Issues committee of the Student Union Board (SUB) will be sponsoring an "Open Forum" to all members of the Notre Dame community. 
The "Open Forum" is, more .or less, an opportunity for stu­dents to voice their opinions on any issue they feel strongly about. A microphone and stand will be set up at the Fieldhouse Mall outside LaFortune be­tween 4:00 p.m. -5:00 p.m. for six consecutive Thursdays starting September 13, 1990 and running through October 18, 1990. 
What is our opinion on 
University regulations regard­ing parietals? Perhaps you think Notre Dame should have co-ed housing available to stu­dents. What are your feelings about Apartheid in South Africa, the war in the Middle East, or your personal beliefs on abortion or the death penalty? 
The "Open Forum" will give you the chance to express your concerns and voice your opin­ion. The Student Union Board invites you to be a part of this effort.

Sights, sounds and experiences of rookie Domer 
I am a freshman. 
I know what you're thinking: "Nice opening. Concise. Good active voice. But wait, there's a problem here. Freshmen do not write columns in the Observer. There's a very simple reason for this: they're freshmen." 
If you can't accept the fact that Notre Dame tradition has changed without a lot of evi­dence, read on. (If there's any­one out there who can, read on anyway.) 
found myself standing in be­tween the College Democrats' 
Chuck Young 

and the College Republicans' Fresh Perspective booths. I must look rather 
moderate, because members of This is my story. both groups started shouting at Like most freshmen, I at­me to join. Fearing a rumble, I 
tended activities night at the quickly moved towards the JACC where over 100 campus nearest display. It happened to 
organizations (read: resume be the Observer's. 
builders and reasons not to do 
homework) were "hawking While waiting in line at the 
their wares." After wandering booth, I began to think about 
aimlessly for a few minutes, I being a freshman (in case you don't remember, most freshmen do this a lot.) Admittedly, they were typical freshman thoughts: "Why do they call us the Fighting Irish? As far as I know, Father Sorin came over from France. It must have something to do with football (everything else does). What if my roommate locks the door and goes to class while I'm in the shower? Should I take my keys with me?" I have trouble imagining a senior wondering those things, anyway. 

Some things are simply unique to the freshman view­point: an amazement at the rigidness of the alcohol policy; an amazement at the amount of beer certain underclassmen can drink without staggering much; an amazement at the amount of beer certain upperclassmen can drink without requiring major rehabilitative therapy; the feel­ing that orientation weekend is just like camp. It's a kind of virgin outlook on life that even faculty and older students can find interesting, or at least amusing. But, I thought, you can't read about it in the Observer. 
And think about the possibili­ties for new articles! For in­stance, freshmen are still inter­ested in each other's S.A.T. scores. We wonder what exactly chicken-fried steak is, how it could possibly ever snow in South Bend if it's this hot in the summer, and whether we'll be hazed if we join the Glee Club. Subjects worry us that, because of experience and a hardened stomach, no longer bother most upperclassmen. Having read about the DeBartolo quad three times in one week, I knew the Observer could use some uncovered material. 
I came to the conclusion that more reporting on the fresh­man perspective would interest students and faculty alike. So, in the end, I decided to do the noble thing and offer up my services as a columnist. 
They were skeptical, but I wrote a sample column and gave it to an editor. In a vision­ary attack in the ongoing battle for market share with the South Bend Tribune, she agreed to publish it. She didn't even edit it much. 
So never fear, class of '94, a new source of investigative re­porting exists to look into your most pressing concerns. 
As an exercise, I and a crack team of Senior engineering ma­jors have already begun work to determine whether leaving the fridge open will really cool off your dorm room. While I can't guarantee that all of the material in this column will lend itself so well to practical application, I'll do my best. 
Anyway, here I am. 
If you like this column, please send appreciative letters and wads of money to my editors. 
If you don't ... well, after all, I'm only a freshman.

Gross pet tricks --One student's summer job 
MICHAEL SNYDER 
accent writer 

How did you spend your summer? Working at a pool? Typing as a clerk? Doing hard physical labor? You thought you had a rough job. 
Well meet Jane Smiley. Maggots, diarrhea, tumors, and vomit were all an everyday part of her summer job. Jane is a sophomore biology major who worked at Montgomery Animal Hospital in Cincinnati hoping to gain experience in the veterinary field. She was hired as "Hospital Staff' but the job title didn't warn her for what was in store. 
When she was hired she ex­pected to do some cleaning but she also anticipated a lot of animal care. However, the ac­tual work she did was far dif­ferent. Every day she had a new grotesque tale. Her job in­cluded cleaning the animal cages covered with urine, stool, and vomit from the animals. She had to carry newly-de­ceased animals to a freezer to place in a pile of other dead animals. She also had to clean the animals of maggots, ear mites, and ticks. 
However, her job was not all bad. She learned various skills about the veterinary field that she couldn't have received any­place else. She was taught how to take blood samples, how to administer medicine to animals, and how to take x-rays of the animals. She also assisted in critical situations like surgery and emergencies. 
Another aspect of her intern­ship was the emotional attach­ment to the animals. She watched some of her favorite animals be put to sleep. Helping old and crippled ani­mals on the brink of death was also a painful part of the job. However, the worst part was saying goodbye after spending an entire summer caring for and nurturing them. 
Her job included cleaning the animal cages covered with urine, stool and vomit from the animals. 
Her opinion of her first expe­rience in the veterinary field was one of mixed emotions. While she met wonderful doc­tors who cared very deeply for the health of the animals, there were also doctors who were cruel and harsh in their treat­ment. 
Another realization was that the majority of veterinary work is routine, like toe nail clippings or neutering. She doubts she will enter private practice but would like to work in a veteri­nary field in Africa. Jane rec­ommends that anyone inter­ested in becoming a veterinar­ian should get some experience and a summer internship is the best way. 
So when you're complaining about your job next summer, and you will complain, remem­ber Jane and her work in a vet­erinary clinic. Then thank your lucky stars you don't have to deal with maggots, diarrhea, tumors, and vomit.

PORT CRANE, N.Y. (AP) -A Detroit bar owner charged with drunken driving in the wreck that killed Billy Martin was be­hind the wheel when the former New York manager's pickup truck crashed, witnesses said Tuesday. 
However, William Reedy's de­fense lawyer said he would prove that his client only told investigators he was the driver to cover for Martin. 
Reedy, 53, owner of Reedy's Bar near Tigers Stadium, is charged with driving while in­toxicated in the accident that took Martin's life on Christmas Day last year. 
Reedy and Martin had a long­time friendship and "as a result of that friendship, there was nothing he wouldn't do for Billy Martin," defense lawyer Jon Blechman told a six-member 
ot under 

way in the Town of Fenton Court. 
"When the accident, hap­pened Bill Reedy thought, 'Billy's got himself in trouble again. I've got to help my friend,"' said Blechman, who added that Reedy didn't learn until several hours later that Martin had been killed when the pickup truck slammed into a concrete culvert at the entrance to Martin's driveway. 
Martin had a long history of alcohol-related problems, in­cluding public fights with his ballplayers. 
Among the first witnesses called Tuesday by Broome County Assistant District At­torney Kevin Among Guyette were members of the family that found Martin's pickup truck on its side in the ditch in front of his farm and the first sheriff's de ut on the scene. 
Brent Piech, 14, told jurors he and his family were returning from-doing chores at a nearby farm when they saw the pickup truck lying driver's si de up in the ditch. 
While his mother rushed back to a nearby house to summon an ambulance, Piech and his father tried to aid the accident victims, he testified. 
He said Martin was pinned up against the passenger side door with Reedy on top of him. 
"You only thought Mr. Reedy was there. We didn't think any­one else was there until my dad picked up Mr. Reedy," the youth testified. 
Blechman focused his ques­tions to Glanville on authori­ties' determination that Reedy was in xicated. 
The Notre Dame Cheerleading Team, along with the Notre Dame Pom Pon Squad, will give a performance in front of the bookstore on Saturday at 3 p.m. in preparation for the NO­Michigan game.

Coach pans Miami talk 
CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) ­The Miami Hurricanes need to learn to keep their mouths shut because they're not good enough to back up brash talk, Coach Dennis Erickson said Tuesday. 
Miami fell from No. 1 to No. 10 by losing its opener Saturday at Brigham Young, 28-21. Erickson said com­ments last week by the Hur­ricanes helped inspire BYU. 
"I think we fueled the fire, no question about it," Miami's second-year coach said at his weekly news conference. 
One Miami player last week said BYU quarterback Ty Detmer was good but not great. Another said the Hurricanes would try to rough up Detmer with blind-side hits. A third player, discussing past accusations that the Cougars play dirty football, described the game as "Nasty East meets Nasty West." 
The Hurricanes' comments were the talk of Provo, Utah when they arrived. 
"I don't like that. I never have liked it," Erickson said. 
"What we've got to do is worry about ourselves and learn to keep our mouths shut and just play football, and when we do that, good things

"I'm concerned about our ability to play pass defense. I

will happen to us." 

The Hurricanes' comments certainly didn't bother Det­mer. He passed for 406 yards and three touchdowns. 
Erickson said the Hurri­canes, who play at California on Saturday, have learned a lesson. 
"They'll watch what they say and say things in the way they want to express them­selves," he said. "But I don't know that you're going to see a lot of things you can put in the (opposing) locker room, because obviously we're not good enough to do that and win." 
Linebacker Maurice Crum, however, later said the Hur­ricanes had no plans to tem­per their tongues. 
"Definitely not," he said. "It never hurt us before. That's the way we've always been. ... Miami talks, and we have to back it up. We're not looking at that as a problem." 
Quarterback Craig Erickson said he tries to watch what he says. But he said some of his teammates talk tough because it motivates them. 
ope we can rna e a JUstments during the course of the game." 
Considering the adjustments Notre Dame has already made in coping with its off-field problems, one would suspect so. 
NVA offers activities for students

Belles defeat Goshen as Mayer sisters shine 
Special to the Observer 
The Saint Mary's tennis team didn't lose a set in its 9-0 destruction of Goshen College yesterday at Saint Mary's Sarah Mayer led the way for the Belles with a 6-0, 6-2 vic­tory over Goshen's Sue Conrad at number-one singles. At number two, Ellen Mayer defeated Jody Crite 6-2, 6-0. 
The Mayer sisters (Sarah and Ellen) combined to de­feated Conrad and Crite 6-4, 6-3 at first doubles. At second doubles, the Belles' Marie Koscielski and Phayma Darby defeated Goshen's Rose Everest and Kris Miller, 6-2, 6-2. 
TV executive becomes first black at Augusta 
AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -The president of Gannett Television is the first black member of Augusta National Golf Oub. 
Ron Townsend, 48, who is in charge of six of the company's television stations, has ac­cepted membership in the club, site of the annual Masters tournament, Augusta National said Tuesday. 
The action by the club came in the aftermath of the contro­versy that centered on the ra­cial policies of Shoal Creek Country Club near Birmingham, Ala., site of last month's PGA Championship. 
The events at Shoal Creek prompted the PGA Tour, the PGA of America and the U.S. Golf Association to adopt new guidelines -effective next year -requiring private clubs that want to host tournaments to demonstrate that their mem­bership policies are not dis­criminatory. 
Townsend was in Boston and was not immediately reachable by telephone. 
He has served as director of field services for the Children's Television Workshop and was involved in the children's pro­grams "Sesame Street" and "Electric Company." He became station manager of WTOP-TV in Washington in 1978 and served in that position until being named to his present post in May 1989.

Cragin looks to start for Irish 
: By DAVE MCMAHON Sports Writer 
For Notre Dame volleyball 
coach Art Lambert, sophomore Marilyn Cragin is a spark of electricity. 
"I see a light turning on and its starting to get brighter," said Lambert, describing the play of late by sophomore Marilyn Cragin, whose 18 kills led the Irish to a win over Western Michigan in the final round of the Notre Dame Invitational this past weekend. 
Although Cragin played "barely at all" last season, spring practice enabled her to become familiar with more than one position. After starting out in the middle, the California native began playing on the right side before moving to the left at the end of spring practice. Shear talent has made the transition to the various positions easy for her.

Love,

Marilyn Cragin 
"Physically she's a marvelous athlete and she has the ability to come in and break up the game at any time," said Lam­bert. 
But the key words in that compliment are "come in". Cra­gin, although only in her second collegiate season, would like to nail down a starting role for the Irish. 
"I've always been able to come in and sub, but I would really like to play my own posi­tion," said Cragin. 
The urge to contribute is only natural, and Coach Lambert is impressed with what he sees in Cragin. 
"She came in during her freshman year and had little or no confidence,"said Lambert. "Now she's progressing to where she should be as a sophomore." 
Cragin, who admits that con­fidence has not been one of her assets, plans to begin playing with a new outlook. 
"In the past tournament, I thought that I did a good job," said Cragin. "I was never really sure of myself before this weekend, but now I'm confident and ready to contribute in any way I can." 
The Irish, 3-3 on the young season, hope to improve to 5-3 with matches this weekend at Kentucky and Louisville.

Popular slogan has nation prepared to 'Just Do It' 
It has become more than Nike's marketing brainchild, more than a verbal play­ground in which Bo Jackson has been able to showcase his athletic prowess. No longer is it just a simple statement to sell a shoe. 
It has become one of the  


most revered statements in Scott Brutocao the nation, exhibited in no finer fashion than on the Irish Items 
Notre Dame campus. 

· Most persons on campus by now have noticed an overabundance of the state­ment "Just Do It, " located on posters, flyers, ad­vertisements, billboards, t-shirts, shoes and other athletic apparel. 
It is said with shameless repetition by coaches who want to see their athletes perform. Fans say it because it epitomizes what sports accomplishment is all about. Notre Dame students say it because it cuts through the clutter of idle talk. 
That it has transcended a marketing plan for Nike is a tribute to its advertisers' talent. The nation has latched on to this short, catchy imperative statement and molded it into a rallying cry transmitted through mass communications. 
Nike's second catch phrase, "Bo knows," also has been catapulted out of the advertising arena and into the vocabulary of Americans everywhere. 
Apparently Nike has a beat on the pulse of Amer­ica. I've heard hybrid versions of their ads, from the jovial family observation "Grandma Punderbottom knows peach pie," to the frank "Just do me." 
At Notre Dame, the "Just Do It" statement has been used for football t-shirts, sports themes, and Bo Jackson tributes. People walk around with a prodigious "JUST" on the front of their shirts and "DO IT" on the back. A shirt-wearer could pay no higher tribute to a message than that. 
Does this simple sentence present a threat to the mindset of the Notre Dame student, who has been taught to be responsible, to be considerate and to plan an action before performing it? Certainly Our Lady of the Lake would not subscribe to such a self­indulgent philosophy. 
Well, we're not talking sexual philosophy here. It applies to resolve, to determination, to wanting something bad enough that you're willing t'o act in­stead of talk, and Notre Dame could use this philos­ophy in its sports programs and its everyday life. 
The involvement reaches further into the athletic program at Notre Dame. The 1989 baseball team's slogan was "Just Do It," and a contemporary t-shirt says, "Lou Knows Football" on the front and "Just Do It" on the back. 
It's just an effective motto. Cut through the muck to the heart of the matter. It expresses such a drive, a singularity of purpose, that any sports team or athlete can learn from it. 
Don't say it; do it. Don't talk about getting into shape; run five miles. Don't elaborate on your team's weaknesses; improve on them. Don't com­plain about how much homework you have; get it done. 
There's too much talk in this world already.
