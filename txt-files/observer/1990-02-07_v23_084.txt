Gorbachev's motions generate controversy 
MOSCOW (AP) -Communist Party leaders added an unex­pected third day to their pivotal meeting Tuesday and sent Mikhail Gorbachev back to the drawing board to fill in holes in his blueprint for ending the party's monopoly on power. 
The extension of the party session. which was supposed to end Tuesday, was a clear sign of the controversy generated by Gorbachev's proposals to re­vamp the country's political structure. 
It sharply contrasted with previous sessions, when the Cnntral Committee automati­cally approvnd policies that had been worknd out at higher lnvds. 
Cnntral Committee sources said most spnakers agreed with Gorbachnv's proposal that the party's monopoly on power, en­shrined in thn Soviet Constitu­tion. must end. 
"All unanimously think it has become obsolete. It has no meaning," Central Committee member Vladimir Anishchev told reporters who gathered outside thn Kremlin's Spasky Gate to await news. The session was dosnd to journalists.

The increasing tolerance of opposition views in El Salvador and Nicaragua do not neces­sarily imply the presence of democracy in these countries, said Morris Blachman in a lee­tun~ on Tuesday. 
Blachman, assistant director of Foreign Studies at the Uni­versity of South Carolina, spoke on the topic of "Prospects for Democracy in Central America of two days of the session, in which 51 speakers took the floor, indicated that neither radical reformers nor hard-lin­ers were satisfied with Gor­bachev's proposal. 
Delegates said Tuesday night's Central Committee ses­sion was suspended so a com­mission, headed by Gorbachev, could complete changes to his nearly 20-page platform. A Central Committee source quoted Gorbachev as saying that the 60-member commis­sion was only half-finished, even though it met all night Monday. 
He said the meeting would re­sume Wednesday morning. 
Delegates interviewed Monday and Tuesday as they filed out onto Red Square indicated a common objection: the platform contains few specifics. 
"A lot of its points, and this is what has been said by many speakers, need major changes and reinforcement, especially in the direction of stepping up de­cisive action," Leonid Bibin, a non-voting Central Committee member, said in a Soviet TV in­terview Tuesday.

-El Salvador and Nicaragua," in the first of a three-part series of presentations con­cerning the state of Central American Affairs. 
The lecture focued on El Sal­vador and it addressed the three main causes of what Blachman termed "the opening of political space." 
He acknowledged the increase of effective participation of the citizens in their government. This participation can consist of an opposition party, or can take the form of a religious group, labor union, or a peas­ant association. 
Blachman said that greater democracy could be achieved by increasing the role of the public to include more than casting a ballot. 
He recommended the en­dorsement of freedom of speech and freedom of the press by the government, as well as improved journalism to keep the public better informed.

rent government in El Salvador is another variable determining the prospects for democracy, Blachman said. With the mili­tary and the oligarchy holding the internal power, the only major entity capable of holding the government accountable for its actions is an external one, the United States. 
Blachman said that this ac­cimntability is not necessarily a strong support for democracy, since the United States provides El Salvador with funds to

Gorbachev reaches top of 5-yr. climb 
MOSCOW (AP) -President Mikhail Gorbachev's proposal for reforming the Communist Party would be the climax of a five-year squeeze play against elderly hard-liners of the Cen­tral Committee. 
Gorbachev took the helm of the Communist Party in March 1985 and since then has almost completely changed the 12-man Politburo, which handles every­day business. But he still cannot count on a majority on the 249­member Central Committee, the one body with the power to fire 
him. 
To push through radical changes, such as Monday's call for the party to give up its monopoly on power, Gorbachev needs Central Committee mem­bers who "pulse with fresh young blood," as the newspaper Argumenti i Fakti put it this week. 
The newspaper, in a scathing indictment of the age and tenure of the party leadership, noted that 61 percent of the Central Committee members were past retirement age, and some have been in positions of

INSIDE COLUMN 

Soviet reforms warrant cuts in U.S. sp.ending 
During the past two days, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) has been in special session, at the request of Soviet 


President Mikhail Matt Gallagher 
Gorbachev. The ses-Exec. News Editor 
sion was extended 

through today be---------­
cause the party 
leadership was unable 

to resolve the issues Gorbachev brought up. 
Foremost among these was Gorbachev's 
proposal that the CPSU give up its 
monopoly of power. which is granted under 
Article 106 of the Constitution of the 
U.S.S.H. 

Although Gorbachev is meeting resistance 
from conservatives who fear the change and 
from liberals who believe the change is not 
rapid enough, it is likely that he will succeed 
in getting the party reforms he desires. The 
dramatic change sweeping through Eastern 
Europe obviously has a great impact on the 
West. Perhaps its most important impact is 
the end of the Cold War. 

A massive Soviet invasion of Western Europe no longer seems likely. With the crumbling of communist governments, the Warsaw Pact (the communist equivalent of NATO) is a shadow of its former self. Sev­eral countries have asked the U.S.S.R. to withdraw its troops. If war were to come to Europe, it is a virtual certainty that the Soviets would have no allies willing to sup­port a Soviet invasion of Western Europe. . 
All this leads to an important domestic political issue for the United States. With the reduced threat in Europe, massive World War 11-style tank battles, for which our forces are structured. will be unlikely. Instead, American forces will face low-in­tensity connicts, such as in Panama or other Third World countries, and a restruc­turing will be necessary. 
The reduced international tension will also allow us to rnduce the defense budget. The United States, however, must be careful about these reductions. First, we must not give in to large-scale disarmament. No one is certain how long Gorbachev or like­minded reformers will last, in the face of conservative opposition. The United States must be able to defend itself if the Soviets' attitude changes. 
Second, the so-called "peace dividend" is nonexistent. All money saved from the de­fense budget must be applied toward reduc­ing the budget defidt. It is interesting that many of those who, three or four years ago, were blaming the deficit on swollen military expenditures, are the same people who wish to spend the savings from a reduced defense budget. If the budget deficit was caused, in part, by large defense expenditures, let's use the savings from defense to reduce the budget deficit.

HPC asked to promote SafeWalk 
By PATRICK HEALY News Writer 
Gina Mahoney, representing the new SafeWalk program at the !!all President's Council's Tuesday meeting, asked HPC to encourage use of the service and help make the service "socially acceptable." 
Mahoney, a member of stu­dent government, stated that many students felt uneasy about calling for the service, and encouraged the presidents to assist in alleviating these feelings in their dorms. 
When asked how a student could get an escort from a parking lot. Mahoney advised for students to drive to a secu­rity gate where an escort could be contacted. She stated that escorts should arrive approxi­mately five to ten minutes after calling.

While Gorbachev is changing the rules of the game at the top, pressure from rank-and­file communists and non-party members alike is providing the bottom jaw of the vise. High-ranking local party offi­cials were embarrassed in na­tional elections last year, when voters were given a choice for the first time in decades. A re­peat performance is likely this spring when elections for local and republic governing councils are held.

possible democratization, ac­cording. to Blachman, is the need for the existing govern­ment to tolerate conflicting ideas instead of persecuting dissidents. "They must have not only a tolerance of dissent, but also a celebration of it," he said. 
These three elements are the major contributors, according to Blachman, to democracy, which he defined as, " ... a par­ticipatory kind of relationship existing between the leadership of a society and its citizens. 
"In a democracy, informed, educated citizens can partici­pate actively and effectively in making decisions about their public lives." He added that this could best be achieved by arriv-

ing at a generul consensus on who is a citizen and can thus participate in the government, and which aspects of the citi­zens' lives the government can legislate. 
Though it may appear that El Salvador is moving toward democracy, Blachman warned that much of the perceived in­crease in political openness was merely a channeling of the gov­ernment's overt repression into forms that appear more ac­ceptable to outside observers. 
Blachman added that the government no longer kills dis­sidents or protestors outright, but it still oppresses through legislation and propaganda. The instances in which protestors are killed occur when the government has de­clared a war zone, thus making it more internationally accept­

able to kill these people, he said. 
Blachman concluded with 
three observations stemming 
from his opinions of democracy 
in Central America. He said, 
"...it is a sham to call El Sal­
vador a democracy." 

He added the observation 
that the greatest indication of 
democratic tendencies is that 
the "opening of political space" 
that occurred a decade ago has 
caused people to be more will­
ing to "put their lives on the 
line" for their ideals. 

He warned that, "Neither demilitarization nor decentral­ization equate to democracy." 
The next lecture on Central America will be concerning the role of the Catholic Church in this area, to be held on Febru­ary 8, followed by a lecture on United States foreign policy on February 14. Both lectures will be held at 4 p.m. in the Center of Social Concerns.

Baker: NATO would accept unified Germany 
PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) -Secretary of State James Baker, trying to guide the drive to German reunification, regis­tered his support Tuesday for a plan that would keep the coun­try in NATO but bar Western troops from moving into what is now East Germany. 
The propos~. advanced by West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher last week, also would allow Soviet troops to remain in the eastern region -at least at the outset. 
A senior U.S. official familiar with Baker's thinking said the move to reunification had ac­celerated to the point that the

two Germanies are likely to be­gin a process of economic, po­litical and legal integration after East Germany holds na­tional elections March 18. 
"The process of unification is taking place on the ground right now, and will continue to take place at a quick pace," said the senior official, travel­ing aboard Baker's plane and commenting only on condition he not be named. 
Later, in a speech scheduled for delivery WPdnesday at Charles University, Baker pro­posed that the United States, Canada, the Soviet Union and 32 European nations send ob­server delegations to eastern and central Europe to ensure that the emerging democracies hold elections that genuinely represent their people. 
In his text, Baker also voiced support for Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's call for a summit of the 35 nations later in the year, and proposed it establish free elections as a human right. 
He said the Soviet leadership apparently had agreed that "legitimacy, not force, is the only way to ensure European stability."

Bibin said he and others want the platform to stress that the party must remain united. The party's unity has been threat­ened in recent months by a breakaway of the party in Lithuania and by proposals by Moscow radicals for formal factions. 
Gorbachev, as he has done on so many issues. has placed himself in the middle, trying to forge compromises. 
Still, the Soviet leader's plat­form has yielded to the de­mands of political reformers ­including the thousands of peo­ple who gathered near the Kremlin wall Sunday -by re­moving the party's monopoly and advancing to this summer a party congress that will be empowered to clear out conser­vatives on the Central Commit­tee. 
Gorbachev is not likely to wa­ter down the platform, for fear of displeasing the increasingly active and consolidated re­formers. But he also must be careful not to antagonize con­servatives, who remain strong in the Central Committee. 
Formally, the Central Com­mittee has the power to replace the party leader.

Court ruling keeps tenure process fair 
In January, the Supreme Court ruled on a case that will ensure equal opportunity and fairness for tenure candidates at colleges and universities nationwide. 
In the case of University of Pennsylvania v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the court ruled that universities must disclose confidential peer reviews in cases that charge racial or sexual discrimination in the tenure process. 
The University of Pennsylvania argued that academic freedom, granted by the First Amendment, protects its confidential tenure evaluations. But the Supreme Court denied the claim, citing the Equal Employment Opportunity Act M 1972, which requires businesses and other institutions to disclose reasons of employee firings. 
Tenure at academic institutions is akin to employee promotion in the business world. Colleges and universities should be subject to the same employee regulations as other institutions. 
While academic freedom and confidentiality of records arc important, they should not stand in the way of fairness or equal opportunity for tenure­seeking faculty. The Supreme Court's ?ecisi_on acknowledges the need to keep confidential information private, except when it is relevant to a 
discrimination charge. 

To disclose confidential records, a charge of racial or sexual discrimination must be plausible, and the confidential information relevant to the charge. Without a good reason and solid evidence of evaluation based on gender or race, rejected tenure candidates cannot demand release of confidential reviews. 
What the decision means is that professors who evaluate tenure candidates will have to support their r?marks with evidence. While the ruling will not dtrectly affect Notre Dame, it will keep the tenure process fair and the evaluators honest at all universities.

Safewalk escort service fosters a safer Notre Dame 
Dear Editor: 
Two major student govern­ment projects have finally come to fruition recently. An exten­sive amount of time and effort have been invested in these pro­jects to insure their success. Now, it is up to you, the Notre Dame community, to become involved and do your part in making these projects a tradi­tion here at the University. 
The Faculty Course Evalua­tions program is designed to give students the opportunity to do something about their aca­demic growth. There may be professors whose teaching style and ability is simply not adequate here at Notre Dame. But as students, what have we been able to do in the past? The Teacher Course Evaluations that we fill out at the end of the semester never seem to be acted upon, especially if a pro­fessor has tenure. 
The Faculty Course Evalua­tions are our way of saying that we want to improve our intellectual pursuits. All data will be tabulated and results will be published in a booklet that will be made available to students and faculty. Students can see how a professor has been judged in the past and use this as a gauge in selecting pro­fessors for the following semester. It is our hope that professors who are judged positively will continue their high level of teaching ability and professors who are judged negatively will improve their level of teaching to meet the needs of students. 
This program cannot be suc­ces~.ful without your support. If we do not get sufficient feed­back, we will not be able to compile a booklet. This is our chance to make a diffen~nce. The forms are easy to fill out and can be placed in the recep­tacles in the lobbies of dorms. The deadline had ben extnnded to Thursday, Feb. 8. 
NO Safewalk is the new stu­dent security escort service. The program began this past Mon­day. It is student initiated and student supported. Students will escort any member of' the Notre Dame community around campus at night. 
The program runs Sunday through Thursday. 7 p.m. to 1 a.m., and Fridays and Satur­days from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m. The number to call for an escort is 283-BI.UE. W1~ can no longer assume that Notre Dame is immune to the evils of the world. ND Saf'ewalk is a serviee provided for stud1~nts in order to create a safer campus envi­ronment.

AIDS discussion relays latest information 
Dear Editor: 
We would like to offer the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's student body an opportunity to learn the most current infor­mation about Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. As stu­dents. we are all young and in­volved with our lives and often do not take the time to think about issues unless we are con­fronted with them. AIDS is a complicated, serious topic and discussing this issue may make people uneasy. However, hav­ing the facts about AIDS is so important that no one can af­ford to be ignorant. In addi­tion, medical research is con­
stantly discovering new facts about AIDS. As a consequence, hospital, insurance, and em­ployment policies are continu­ally affected. Hence, we can only stress how important it is for people to keep themselves knowledgeable about AIDS. 
AIDS Awareness Night is tonight at 7:30 p.m. in Theodore's. There, in the space of two hours, you will receive the most current information from professionals in the South Bend area. The panel for this event consists of the following: a doctor who primarily deals with AIDS patients. an AIDS educator, a representative from Campus Ministry, a family member of a person with AIDS, a Notre Dame student who has worked with AIDS patients, and a person with AIDS. The agenda will include a brief speech from each panel member followed by a question and answer period in which you will be able to ask questions anonymously. We encourage Saint Mary's and Notre Dame students from all backgrounds and viewpoints to attend.

UNDERGROUND 
As progressive becomes mainstream, sub-pop, industrial, and rap emerge as new genres 

JASON WINSLADE 
accent writer 
The Cure. H.E.M. U2. New Order. Depeche Mode. Tears for Fears. Simple Minds. Not too long ago, these early 80's progressive bands were the darlings of underground pro­gressive fans. and unheard of outside of the underground cir­cles. Today, these bands are household names. play in front of stadium size crowds, arn frequently heard on Top 40 ra­dio. and are the trendy bands of the 80's and 90's, influencing countless clone bands. In flSSflnce, yesterday's under­ground has become today's mainstream. /\!though some of these bands still show facets of their old styli~. most have ma­tured considerably since th(~ir youth, and more orten than not have molded tlwir style to please tlw masses of nnw, young. and eager "progrnssiw" fans. What is the 1ww under­ground and can tlw new bands be accurately categorized? 
Even such musical gnnrns as jazz have had progrnssiw n~ac­tions to their mainstrnam. Punk was tlw most violnnt nac­tion to tlw rock mainstrnam, latnr subdividing into such typns as hardcorn, garage rock, and gothic rock. t·:lnctronic mu­sic, pionPnred by tlw Gnnnans and Japanese, led tlw way to techno-pop, and finally to tlw most underground faction of nlertronie. industrial. Main­stream rhythm and blues gaw way to rap. hip-hop, and house, a form of Plnctronieally sam­pled beats populariz(d by mindless dance dubs known as acid houses. Most music genn~s have blurred their prnviously distinct lines and have pro­duced countless number of subdivisions. The most diversi­fied bands are the most suc­cessful, as in the case of the Hed I lot Chili Peppers , who combine funk, punk, hip-hop and rap for a unique sound. However. out of all these sub­genres, three movements in particular seem to indicate the direction of underground music today; sub-pop. industrial, and 
rap. 
1\s hardcorc is on the decline, it is being assimilated into other genres like sub-pop, a term named after the Seattle label which promotes area bands that combine classic rock influences with punk and hardcore (Black Flag meets Led Zeppelin). This new genre is the new grungy, garage sound, re­acting to the pop genre which takes itself too seriously, ac­cording to the sub-pop artists. Bands like Mudhoney and Soundgarden personify the sub­pop attitude in their less than meaningful lyrics, and harsh, yet fun, sound, modeled after the original fifties and sixties "Louie, Louie" sound. Other la­bels, like D.C.'s Dischord, Cali­fornia's SST, and New York's Revelation, are following suit and promoting the more diver­sified hardcore and garage rock bands, like Fugazi. 
Like rock, metal, and elec­tronic music, rap has its reac­tionary factions. Message ori­ented groups like Public Enemy, NWA, and Ice-T have led the way in underground rap against such "Cosby kid" rap­pers as Jazzy Jeff and Young MC, presenting issues such as drugs, racism and gang vio­lence, rathflr than innuendos and entertaining stories. He­gardless, tlwse groups am not above having a good time and rapping about othnr things be­sides thn horror of the strnets. 
1\s in all other forms of mu­sic, yesterday's underground has bncomn mainstrnam in rap also, as demonstrated by its gn~atly 1mlargnned audience. /\!though Nnw York and 1../\. an~ still thn epicenters of rap. it has sprPad to such <m~as as Dallas, 1\tlanta and Miami. wlwre lalwls such a<; len-T's Bhynw Syndicatn and NW/\'s Huthlnss Bncords producP un­dnrground rap groups.

Finallv as a rPaction to tlw mindlPs.s lwats of house and tlw imagP consdous tPchno-pop artists. industrial music has rPaclwd the fonf'ront of tlw nPw tPchnological wavP of PlPI'­tronic sound.

Hxp1~rinwntal bands such as Laibach and tlw GPrman t:instuerzPnd(' NnubautPn compete with tlw dafl(~e orient!~d bands, while tlw morn sucenssf'ul bands, as always, arn the ones that combine many diffnn~nt styles. With the adv1mt of nnw and ew~r-changing technology, industrial, on a continuum bntwnen house and hardcorn, is most accnssibln to artists who haw morn tnehnologieal skill than musical talent. However. when thn two arn eombilwd. tlw 

drum machines, sampled guitars, effects, and movie sound bites, can create fantastic audio seulptures of both mood and madness, as in the example of the atmospheric and horrific Skinny Puppy and the eonfrontational Ministry. Newer bands, such as Cleve­land's Nine Inch Nails, are bound to go far, by combining elements of thrash, punk, funk, techno-pop, and hip-hop. 
In general, the future of un­derground music, and music overall, lies in the hands of the artist who can diversify, whether it be in rap, sub-pop, industrial, or metal. If history repeats itself. today's under­ground music might be heard on mainstream radio ten years from now. Concerts might be­come more violent, confronta­tional, and effects-oriented. No genre will be pure, but will be saturated with numerous other styles and sub-genres. The face of music is changing as you read this, and unless you be­eome aware of the underground around you, you might get lost in the shuffle.

were led by Dominique Wilkins, who had 25 points, and Kevin Willis, who added 1 7. 
San Antonio scored the first 10 points of the second half, in­cluding four from Cummings, to take a 67-48 lead. 
Atlanta closed to within 71­62 with a 12-2 run later in the third quarter. 
But the Spurs, winners of five straight, used a 7-0 surge later in the period to go ahead by 18 and were threatened in the fourth quarter. 
Wilkins had 21 first-half points, but the Spurs, behind 17 points from Cummings, led 57­48 at the break. 
San Antonio, which leads the Midwest Divison by one game over Utah, set three free-throw records in the first half, fewest attempts in a quarter (0 in the second), fewest attempts in a half (three) and fewest made in a half (three).

No Magic in these Lakers as Volleyball Club wins easily 
If the Los Angeles Lakers in the second game as Pat Burke, Dan Kavanaugh, rolled into the Joyce ACC, Mike Flecker, Greg Barrett, Andy Sullivan and Greg people would no doubt come Mike Kamradt Scheckenbach took the floor for the Irish. The from miles around to see the Club Corner lineup continued to change, though, throughout the likes of Magic Johnson and rest of the match. James Worthy. " I still don't have my first team set," explained 
Tuesday night, the Grand Valley St. Lakers played the Volleyball Club and, no one is about to call this bunch talented as the Irish disposed of the Lakers in three games 15-2, 15-12 and 15-9. 
" We shouldn't have let this team score more than two points," said coach Bill Anderson. "I guess it's hard to get up for teams that aren't up to your tal­ent level. but that's what separates good and bad teams." 
The Irish starters in the first game of Pedro Nemelceff, Tom Martin, Dave Bose, Mike Sheedy, Tim Maloney and Paul DeMieri made quick work of the Lakers. GVSU took a 1-0 lead but the Irish then ran off 13 in a row. 
Dave Bose had 4 kills, including two rockets that made the Lakers glad they weren't in the line of fire. Jim Jefferey came off the bench for a block, and then took a Nemelceff set (one of eight) for a quick kill. The Notre Dame team looked impressive while the Laker team was in total disarray, not able to get any good sets or kills. 
The Irish went with a completely different lineup Anderson. "I'm trying to find a unity for the first team by using a lot of different combinations." 
Scheckenbach staked the Irish to an early lead with a solo block. The Irish used their superior passing ability to extend the margin to 6-1 but then ran into some sloppy play as the Lakers closed to 8­5 and Anderson called a timeout with the score 10-9 to settle down his team. 
With the score 14-12, Andy Sullivan came up with a big block to give the Irish a sideout and then gained the victory when GVSU had four hits. Dan Kavanaugh racked up nine assists while Pat Burke had four kills and four perfect serves. 
The Irish got the early lead in game three again but the Lakers closed to 11-9. A Flecker dink ex­tended the Irish lead to 13-9. Leo Casas served the last two points and also had a great one-handed save to keep one point alive. Another Flecker blast wrapped up the match for the Irish. 
The Irish lost their first three games of the year but are now on a roll, having won nine of their last ten. Included in that span is an impressive third-place finish at the University of Michigan Invita­tional last weekend. Notre Dame finished only be­hind Michigan and Michigan State while beating Bowling Green to gain third. 
"We've come a long way so far this year," said coach Anderson. "The tournament (last weekend) gave us a chance to look at personnel and mature a little." 
Not only was it a successful venture for the team, but 5-9 junior setter Nemelceff was named to the All-Tournament team. lie was only the third player in Notre Dame men's volleyball history to have that honor. 
The Gymnastics Club travelled to Miami (Ohio) to take on the Redskins as well as Purdue, and Eastern Michigan. The Irish women's team placed second, just three points behind Miami. 
"We definitely have as much talent as they do," said president Jenene Niedzwecki. "This was our first meet while it was Miami's third." 
Freshman Mary Malone placed third overall and second in the parallel bars. "She did really outstanding," commented Niedzwecki who herself finished fifth in the vault. The men didn't have a full team. but had a fine first meet. "They did great. This is the first time they per­formed against other team," said Niedzwecki.

ABC threatens action following ND contract 
NEW YORK (AP) -ABC Sports said Tuesday it was considering legal action against Notre Dame, NBC and the College Football Association in its battle to keep Fighting Irish home games. 
Stephen J. Solomon, senior vice president of ABC Sports,­angrily accused NBC and Notre Dame of interfering with its 
$210  million,  five-year  deal  
with the  CFA  that  begins  in  
1991.  

He also said that the network would not pay the full amount of money due in the contract unless Notre Dame home games were included. Both NBC and Notre Dame defended their actions, with NBC stating Tuesday: "We acted fairly in this situation." 
Meanwhile, ABC executives met Tuesday in New York with Chuck Neinas. the CFA's execu­tive director. Dave Ogrean. the CFA's assistant executive direc­tor for television, said in a tele­phone interview from Boulder, Colo.: "While we are familiar with the steps they might take against Notre Dame and NBC Sports, I don't think there's been any indication that ABC will pursue anything like that (legal action) against us. 
"Now that Notre Dame uni­laterally pulled out of the pack­age, we're trying to work it out so that there are 63 schools in­volved instead of 64," Ogrean said. 
Notre Dame and NBC agreed Monday to a live-year contract for the Fighting Irish's home games, beginning in 1991. The CFA and ABC agreed on Jan. 17 to a five-year, $210 million con­tract. 
"I believe that we have a con­tract with the CFA that includes all 64 schools, including Notre Dame," Solomon said. "Notre Dame is part of the deal we en­tered into with the CFA. We have informed them by letter that we have an agreement with the CFA that includes them." 
Asked if ABC or its parent, Capital Cities Inc., would take legal action to preserve the 
deal,  Solomon  said:  "That's  
certainly  one  of the  options  
we're entertaining."  



lnterhall basketball hitting stride 
Stars coming to forefront as crunch time nears for men 
By DAVE DIETEMAN 

Sports Writer 
As the 1990 men's lnterhall basketball season rolls towards the playoffs. the proverbial stars are beginning to shine. 
Sitting atop the heap of 22 A­division teams is Stanford A of the Big Sky League, boasting a 5-0 record. In the Big Sky. Stanford is dosely followed by Grace A, captained by Billy Sh­erman, at 4-1. 
Except for Cavanaugh A, who must win its final game, the rest of the teams in the Big Sky League must have more than a few things go their way in order to reach post-season eornpntition. 
In thn A-division ACC League, Morrissey A1, undefeated at 4­0, reigns supreme after prevail­ing in a :~6-:~2 nail-biter against Dillon A. whieh fell to 3-1. Yet Morrissey must refinn its game in order to bring its title hopes to fruition. 
Morrissey captain Kevin Keyes said, "Our next game is against the Off-Campus Van­dals. and we really need to play consistently, because we've been playing too spotty of late. 
We  especially  need  to  start  
playing good defense."  
Meanwhile,  Sorin  A  (3-0)  

faces a must win situation against Dillon A, which, in order to continue beyond the regular season, no longer has any option to win. 
"The game against Dillon will be a big game, and we're looking forward to it. You win, you get in the playoffs," Sorin captain Torn Zider said. 
In the A-division Big Ten, Morrissey A2, captained by Ed Larkin. sits in the lead at 3-0, followed by Fisher A, Holy Cross A and Carroll A at 2-1 eaeh. 
In the B-division, Sorin B of the ECAC and St. Ed's B of the WAC are tied at the top at 4-0. 
Trailing Sorin B in the ECAC is Alumni B2 (2-0). while the re­mainder of the ECAC must en­gage in a mad scramble to make the playoffs. A similar situation exists in the WAC. where St. Ed's B (4-0) and Off­Campus B (3-0) are the only teams with winning records. 
The B-division SEC promises a close race to the wire, as Ca­vanaugh B1 and Morrissey B head into the final week of the regular season deadlocked, each at 3-1. Closing out the B­division is the PAC Ten, led by Flanner B 1 ( 4-1) and closely shadowed by Stanford B1 (3-1 ). 
Tonight at ACC Intramural gym 2, Dillon A1 battles Sorin A at 7 p.m. for the right to make the playoffs. while Ca­vanaugh A and Keenan A square off at 8 p.m. At gym 1, Off-Campus Navarre Estates takes on Stanford B2 at 7 p.m.,

Women's divisions heading toward 'March Madness' 
By CHARLIE POLLARD 
Sports Writer 
"March Madness" will soon be here. 
That tempestuous time of year when basketball seasons galore will conclude in frenzind, unpredictable and exciting fashion, is:alrnost here. 
But before such featured events as the NCAA tournament and Notre Dame's own Book­store tournament, the Notre Dame women's interhall circuit takes center stage. 
Women's interhall is corn­posed of three divisions. The A­1 division showcases tradi­tional heavyweight Breen­Phillips, and relative newcomer Siegfried A. 
This past Sunday, Breen­Phillips avenged its opening­game loss to Siegfried A with· a 27-21"overtime win. Siegfried A still sits atop the A-1 division with· a 4-1 record, but Breen­.Phillips is right behind with a 3­1 .record. Christine Churchill, the Breen-Phillips captain, likes 
the position and progress of 
her team. 
"We really pointed towards this game (the 27-21 rematch victory)," said Churchill. "Siegfried beat us in the first game but we've come together more as a team since then." 
In Sunday's other action, Pasquerilla West evened its record at 2-2 with a 46-23 landslide victory over Badin Hall. Badin's last-place record dropped to 0-4. Lyons A is the fourth place team with a 1-2 record. They were to play Breen-Phillips Tuesday evening. 
The A-2 division has thus far 
been dominated by Lewis Hall 
with a 4-0 record. Pasquerilla 
East is one-half game back at 
4-1. These two teams will meet 
this Sunday in a division decid­
ing contest. 

Molly Mahoney, a senior on the underdog Pasquerilla East squad, is looking forward to the game. 
"Lewis is a very talented team. We have learned from experience that if we don't come to play, we will be beaten," said Mahoney. "We have a lot of weapons in our arsenal, but we have to execute properly to win." 
In last Sunday's action, Lewis beat 0-4 Walsh Hall, 35-31. Also, Pasquerilla East snuck by Howard Hall (1-3) by a score of 31-28. All is set for this Sun­day's big game at gym two of the Joyce ACC. Tipoff is set for 5 p.m. 
Closing out the A-2 division is Knott Hall at 1-2. Knott has yet to play Howard and Walsh, and could possibly make some noise in the playoffs with two season­ending victories. 
The women's B division con­
sists of only four teams. The B 
division has shown more parity 
than the other two divisions. 
Siegfried B holds first place 
with a 4-1 record followed by 
BTTCG (3-2), Breen-Pt :Hips B 
(2-3), then Lyons B (1-4). 
In last Sunday's action,

Irish baseball squad opens season today 
It looks like the Notre Dame 
baseball team just couldn't 
wait to get things started this 
season. 
The Irish will start their 

season today, more than two 
weeks earlier than scheduled, 

when they host Goshen at 3:30 
p.m. at Jake Kline Field. Notre Dame had not been expected to start its season until Feb. 23, when the Irish begin a three-game series at Hawaii. 
Goshen and Notre Dame agreed to play this garnn only in the last few days. 
Notre Dame is coming off a 48-19 season that included its first appearance in the NCAA Tournament since 1970. The Midwest Collegiate Conference champions finished the 1989 campaign ranked 23rd in the nation. 
I didn't know whether to laugh or cry last weekend when former Marquette coach AI McGuire babbled on national television about how his old school had just joined the "Metro Cities Conference." 
You know you conference has really hit the depths when people don't even bother remembering what "MCC" stands for. The way Notre Dame has dominated the Midwest Col­legiate Conference ever since climbing aboard two years ago, it may as well be called the Michiana Country Club. 
Sure, the MCC is one heck of a soccer conference, and has had some pretty competitive baseball as well. But other than that, it merely has served as an opportunity for Notre Dame to showcase its non-revenue sports. 
Let's take a look at some of the MCC's most recent con­
ference winners.: 
Golf: Notre Dame 
Track: Notre Dame 

Men's cross country: Notre Dame 
Men's swimming: Notre Dame 
Women's swimming: Notre Dame 
Women's basketball: Notre Dame 
Baseball: Notre Dame 

You get the picture. The problem for the MCC is that the Irish domination shows no signs of letting up.
