Oklahoma Offense : Too Soon-er For The Notre Dame Defense?

Don remembers when the Irish let the air out of Oklahoma 38-0 in 1966. He watched it from the stands, waiting out a year before becoming eligible after transferring from Trinity (of Texas) University. 
"Kinda frightening," Pfrimmer describes it. "I didn't' know they made college players that big. They looked like a machine, too. Good precision. I 
was impressed. 
"I've been reading where their defense is supposed to be weaker this year but I don't believe it. I expect a lot from 'em." 
"We'll really have to play as a unit to stay in the game," Pfrimmer believes. "We haven't got a lot of exceptional players. It'll take a good team attitude.'1

Gluteus Maximus Aids Sooner Kicker 

NORMAN, Okla., -Every 
,good placekicker needs to be fat in the gluteus maximusGluteus maximus? 
"Rear end," Derr clarifies with a straight face. "That's where most of your power comes from." 
The ·sooner sophomore's power is coming from somewhere because he's already kicked two 65-yard practice field goals with Oklahoma's rampant wind. In a scrimmage last week, his 46-yarder argued with a stiff breeze and won easily. 
This kind of thing is soft 
music to coach Chuck 
Fairbanks' nerves. He knows 
that when the Sooners need a 
field goal or an extra point he 
can slap Bruce on the 
rear--er--gluteus maximus--tell 
him to get out there and kick 
one through, and feel it will get 
done. 
Derr believes he would not 
remain here long if quarterback 
Bob Warmack wasn't around to 
hold the ball for him. "That' the 
most important thing," Bruce 
explains. "The holder has to get 
the ball on the tee. If not, I can't 
kick it. Bobby does a great job." 
Bruce thought he would do a ·great job on the opening kickoff 
in the varsity-alumni game last 
spring. 
"It was my first kickoff in 
public here," he grins. "I put the 
ball on the tee, stepped to the 
side and threw my leg in the. air 
to loosen up. When I did I fell 
flat on my rear. Right there in 
front of everybody.'' 
"My ego was damaged. I wasn't thinking about my kicking ability." 
Flat on your what? 
"On--flat on my gluteus 
maximus," he corrected with a 
grin.

Ernie Jackson Reneged 



By Terry Shields 
Saturday afternoon will mark the culmination of a big decision Ernie Jackson made a few years ago. It seems that Jackson was very undecided as 'Nhether to attend Notre Dame or Oklahoma University. Well, Jackson is now a starting defensive back for the Fighting Irish, but his decision was not an easy one. He had visited both schools and they both impressed himvery much. In fact, he signed a letter of intent with Oklahoma but decided on Notre Dame. 
There were many things Ernie considered before finalizing his decisions. A very important factor was the location of the schools. Since he is from Bartleville, Okla., the Sooners were given an edge here. Then too, being from Oklahoma he played against many of their recruits in high school. (Two of the more notable school boy rivals are Steve Owens, starting tailback, whom Jackson rates as the most competitive athlete he has ever met, and halfback 
Fight Irish Style With More Irish 


NORMAN, Okla., It's been said that the best way to fight an 
Irishman  is  with  another  
Irishman.  
If  that's so,  Oklahoma  is in  

for a long afternoon today against Notre Dame. 
John Titsworth, bony Sooner right tackle, is the only Irishman in Oklahoma's defensive line. 
The other Sooner tackle, 202-pound Dick Paaso, is Finnish-Polish-French-Italian, nose guard Kenny Davis, 217, is Negro and neither of the ends, Jim Files, 208, or Larry McDuff, 185, know what they are. 
So it's up to Titsworth, a South Baptist instead of a Catholic, 208 pounds instead of 250, to uphold the Oklahoma shamrock against his paddy-whacking brethren Saturday at South Bend. 
Titsworth doesn't even have an Irish swagger. 
"Every time I see Titsworth walk down the street I get scared. He can't even walk right," a Sooner defensive coach

Its about this time of year that coaches begin feeling useless. 
What's the sense in playing 10 games when the nation's sportswriters 
already have the season figured out? 
College foorball goes to the post today, so let's round up some of the more important pre-season prophecies, then sit back for three months and watch an exercise in futility. 
Sports Illustrated---Everybody wants to be last in this one because of the notorious Sl jinx, better known as journalism's bubonic plague. It's Purdue, USC, Texas and Notre Dame, in that order. Irish defender Tony Capers rates m~nt_ign ~ _o_n_e __of the country's top

Playboy---Purdue (9-1 ), Oregon State (9-1 ), Florida (9-1 ), Texas A & M (8-2), Notre Dame (8-2). Terry Hanratty and George Kunz are All-A_merica, Jim Seymour, Mike McCoy and Bob Olson honorable mention. 
Look---Purdue, USC, Texas, ND. That's the identical order Sports Illustrated had. Sl's plague could be contagious. 
Kick-off---No nation-wide selection here, but Purdue is rated tops 
in the midwest while the Irish are "girded for an undistinguished 
season." Hanratty is All-America. 
Dell---Purdue, USC, Oklahoma, ND. Hanratty collects another All-America rating. Kunz, Seymour and Olson are All-Midwest. 
The Football News---Texas edges the Irish for No. 1 by 94-93 among a poll of the entire staff. Ace reporter Harry DeVoid makes some sense in a separate article. He; ays flatly, "Notre Dame leads

Joe O'Day of the New York Daily News---NO, Purdue, USC, Tennessee.  College and Pro Football---Texas, Oklahoma, Purdue, Penn State, NO. Hanratty, Seymour and Olson are All-America. ABC Radio-TV Sports---The Irish trail Southern Cal by one vote. Texas is third. ,. Michigan Football---The name of this one might be Ripley's Believe It or Not.

Eddie Hinton, who wished Ernie luck in their last· encounter during the summer.) But Jackson was not narrow minded in his decision. He also considered the spirit, the educational opportunity and religion. This is what sold him on Notre Dame. So today, Jackson must prove to himself and to Oklahoma that he made the right decision on one more aspect, that is , the Irish have a better football team. 
Of the game itself, Jackson expects a close contest, pitting two potent offenses against young but eager defenses. He also expects some "friendly" bumps from his home staters and, no doubt, he'll give some in return. Mentally, he feels that, although only a sophomore, he has an advantage since Oklahoma has no scouting report on him. However he does expect to make mistakes as all sophomores do. Physically, his shoulder bruise has mended and he'll be there at the starting bell. The decision Ernie Jackson made could possibly ruin the Sooners chances for revenge from a game played that same year, 1966.

Kenny Davis rearranged his 6-2, 2-inch, 218-pound frame in the big white recliner and draped a bed spread across his body. He was resting for the second of the Sooners'

A lot is being asked of the 19-year-old Plano, Texas, sophomore. In hurry-up fashion Sooner coaches are grooming him to fill up the spot All-American Granville Liggins made famous--nose guard. 
Even Liggins wasn't asked to start as a sophomore, Jet alone debut against Notre Dame. "It's a tough challenge starting off against the best," Davis grinned through his closely-cropped mustache. "But I don't care who it's against. I'm just anxious to get out there and see how I'm going to do.

Eddie Hinton Runs Alone No Longer 

Eddie Hinton, Oklahoma's elusive wingback, got his speed running at night in Mississippi. 
"Sometime the sound of your own feet makes you go faster," says the 200-pound Lawton, Oklahoma, senior. 
"It started when I was a tenth-grader at Lawton and I was visiting my Mississippi cousin, Harry Charles Owens, at Meridian. He had played college ball down there and he was fast. I asked him what I could to to pick up speed. 
"He said the best way was to run through Meridian at night. So I tried it. I'd been walking clear across town to a little colored cafe called the Smokehouse where a lot of kids sat around eating hamburgers, playing the juke box and having fun. 
"After a while I started home, walking alone through Victor Village, a white area. You hear noises...frog hollering if it's damp, a cricket chirping, the swish of a weed blown by the wind. Pretty soon, I ' began trotting." !linton paused for a moment of 
reflection. 

Fairbanks Lauds ND Lavishly 
Oklahoma coach Jim Fairbanks has had plenty of things to say about Notre Dame 1his past week---all of them nice. 
"I think they may have better personnel than any other college team in the country. I think they probably have more quality players," Fairbanks said of the Irish. 
"There's one thing in our favor," he continued. "They can't play all their boys at once---only II at a time." 
What worries him most about Notre Dame? "Trying to stop their running game," Fairbanks replies. "I know their passing game, with Hanratty and Seymour, is strong and has had more publicity, but their running power was chiefly responsible for their winning their last six games. We're concerned about it and we're working hard against it. 
"Our problem is to stop them well enough that we can execute our own offensive game plan ins lead of having to play catch-up. 
"Then the wind blew a piece of paper against a fence and I switched from the concrete sidewalk to the tar-covered road and lengthened out. The sound of your own shoes hitting the pavement stimulates you. I cut loose. 
"Nearly every night, I'd cover the two miles to my cousin's house alternately walking, trotting and sprinting. I never got tired. And that's how I learned to run." 
It paid off handsomely. At Lawton High, he won the State Class AA low hurdles in track and was an All-America halfback in football. 
Eddie didn't miss a stride when he came to OU. After two sensational seasons for the Sooners, he is regarded as the best athlete on the team and a possible No. I pro draft pick. 
As a sophomore Hinton led the antion in punt runbacks with an average of 29.1 yards. For the past two years he has the highest rushing average on the team, .six yards his sophomore year and 6.2 as a junior. He is also the Sooners' leading receiver and needs only 17 catches to break Bill Jennings' 28-year-old career school record and only 148 yards receiving to best Ben Hart's all-time Sooner mark. 
Eddie's biggest play came last year in a nationally televised game against Nebraska. With Oklahoma behind, 14-13, he swept around left end in the fourth quarter and scrambled 23 yards for the game-winning touchdown. 
He didn't need to be motivated by the whistling of a cricket or the rustle of a weed, either. He had all the speed he needed and he could turn it on at will. 
Eddie's grateful to that Mississippi interlude for another reason. 
For years, his mother had been saving money to send him to college. When his blazing speed earned him a football scholarship and he could finance his own education, she gave him the college money to buy a car. 
Now Eddie Hinton doesn't have to run alone down dark streets. 

Casteel Remembers Vividly 
NORMAN, Okla., -Steve Casteel, Oklahoma's sophomore linebacker, remembers the moment vividly. 
After intercepting a pass for Garland, Texas high school, he was speeding down the sidelines enroute to a touchdown. But as he sped past the opponents' bench, an assistant coach reached out and slapped the ball from Steve's grasp. 
"It kinda stunned me," recalls Casteel. "Everybody in the stands thought I'd fumbled. Even my mother. 
"Luckily, a referee saw it happen and gave us the touchdown anyway. It was a 73-yard play." Anything else happen that night? 
"Yep, I intercepted another one and ran it back 77 yards." 
The Sooner coaching staff, figuring Steve might continue doing this sort of thing, had him stationed on the first team. They have been thanked. Casteel has

been jarring the daylights out of his teammates in scrimmages, playing like anything but the sophomore he is. 
Back in grade school, Steve thought he would someday be jarring people for Texas Christian University. "I used to love TCU," he explains, "but after my senior year in high school, Coach Switzer (Barry, Sooner offense coach) sold me on Oklahoma. 
"I think the world of Coach Switzer. He's one of the main reasons I'm here." 
Casteel, whose 6-3, 205-pound frame lifts eyebrows, will play alongside Don Pfrimmer, OU's other linebacker. 

"Don and have this thing going," Steve explains. "When one of us intercepts a pass the other owes him a coke. I owe Pfrimmer two cokes." 
Casteel believes the hardest part about linebacking is knowing what to do when the other team comes out in a strange formation. "I'm not grasping that too well," he grins. 
He was talking about formations, not intercepted passes. Those will be tightly gripped from now on.

Individual Team 
The year 1967-69 has manv different meanings for the seniors of Notre Dame. Plans for the future vary from student to student--­Rick Rembusch may be making plans to be President of the United States. Bob Whitmore is thinking of ways to stop Lew Alcindor and beat UCLA.

Now the time is here. Today we will play Oklahoma for our first test of the new season. 
Scouting reports for Oklahoma say the Sooners will be the fastest team we will play all year. They are coming off the '67 season with a 9-1 record plus a very impressive victory over Tennessee in I he Orange Bowl. 

If revenge is any way to get your players up for a game, Coach Fairbanks will have no problem getting his boys sky high. In 1966, Nick Eddy & Company beat the undefeated Sooners ( 4-0 before the game) 38-0. Almost the same Oklahoma team will invade the Irish I stadium today looking for revenge. I
