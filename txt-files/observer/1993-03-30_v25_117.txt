INSIDE COLUMN 
Spring has finally arrived. 
South Bend has had four days of sunshine (we'll have to see if that's some sort of a record), Bookstore Basketball XXII 

has started (my girlfriend Richard Riley 
was lucky enough to have Business Manager 
on of the Elvises throw Emeritus 
some of his chest hair to_______ her), and Notre Dame students have been taking to the basketball courts in a mass exodus after being subjected to over four months of forced hibernation. At the same time, the final four teams are making their ways to New Orleans and March Madness has reached its peak. Students have spent the last two weeks cheering for their second-favorite teams and seeing the upsets and great plays for which tournament time is famous. However, the Notre Dame men's basketball players have seen their roles in March Madness reduced to spectators (editor's note: among Notre Dame's men's basketball players, only Monty Williams has ever been anything other than a spectator during the NCAA tournament) 
and have had their playing experiences reduced to those on the various courts around campus. 
The 1992-'93 season was a frustrating one. but it did provide several prospects of great success to come in the next few seasons. The return of Williams provided leadership and stellar play on the court, even though he had not played for the Irish for the two previous seasons. 
The arrival of Ryan Hoover delighted NO fans as they saw that the team possesses a highly talented player who will only get better with more experience and fans look to freshman Keith Kurowski to provide much needed depth at the guard position. 
But the player who will be the catalyst for Notre Dame in the future is one who is still developing, a player who has shown signs o greatness and whose work ethic will make him one of the premier Irish hoopsters in years to come. Yes, that's right, I'm talking about Lamarr Justice. 
Not only does the 6-2 sophomore possess the greatest name in college basketball (say it with me: "Lamarr Justice"-can't you just feel the power and the smoothness of the player in the name?), but his play on the court this year showed the Irish faithful that they have a player who has the potential to come on strong in the next two years to be a highly skilled guard in the Notre Dame attack, just as Elmer Bennett was in the 1991 and '92 seasons. 
So right now, to avoid the rush next season, I am signing myself up as the charter member o the Notre Dame chapter of the "Justice League," the Lamarr Justice fan club. If you, too see the greatness about to emerge, send in your request to join the Justice League to me, care of The Observer, and get in on the ground floor of the fan club that will cheer on number 24 and the rest of the Irish in their triumphant campaign next season.

NATIONAL 
Universitv faculty members strike 
 CINCINNATI -Unionized faculty members went on strike Monday at the University of Cincinnati at the start of the spring semester. Administrators of the 35,000­student state university said its representatives found that more than 60 percent of the classes were being taught. Picket lines also were crossed by members of other unions on the campus, Cincinnati's largest employer with 19,000 workers. But the striking American Association of University Professors said students reported that fewer than half the classes were being taught. Both sides reported that student attendance was light. The union represents 1,916 full-time faculty members at the main and branch campuses, and the medical and law schools, but fewer than 800 of them actually belong to the union. Their average annual salary is $51,000. 
Observer Spacecraft to study Mars 
 PASADENA, Calif.-The Mars Observer spacecraft will start studying the Red Planet three weeks earlier than planned because extra fuel will let it descend to proper orbit more quickly, NASA said Monday. The Nov. 22 start will let the Mars Observer get one complete look at all of the planet before the sun moves between Mars and Earth from Dec. 20 to Jan. 3, temporarily preventing controllers from radioing commands to the spacecraft. The spacecraft is scheduled to study Mars for at least one Martian year, or 687 Earth days, producing photographs and topographic maps of unprecedented detail. It also will search for indirect evidence that life may have once existed on Mars. 
Judge issues rulings in Tyson lawsuit 
 INDIANAPOLIS -A federal judge .. has issued the first set of ru motions in a civil lawsuit against Mike Tyson by the woman he convicted of raping. U.S. District J Larry McKinney granted Desir Washington's request to halt attor taking pretrial testimony from witnesses· ..·. until Tyson's criminal case is resolved. The Indiana Court of Appeals is expected to issue a ruling soon on the former heavyweight boxing champion's appeal of his conviction. The judge granted a portion of the 19-year-old woman's request to restrict public access to specific documents. He said court records such as medical records, communications with psychiatrists or social workers and personal diaries could be held confidential.

Church, gays battle in Caribbean 
 SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -The cancellation of a Caribbean gay pageant in St. Maarten is the latest setback for gays and lesbians in a region long hailed as a playground for the passionate and the uninhibited. Militant church leaders say the issue is decency and morals. Gay leaders call it a battle over human rights. St. Maarten's government canceled Saturday's scheduled show, featuring several male impersonators, after Anglican, Methodist and Roman Catholic leaders threatened to "go to any lengths" to stop the show from going on. Clergy went to their pulpits to fan the dispute, listing homosexuality as one of "the ills of society."

Speaker says no gays in military 

By ANALISE TAYLOR 
News Writer 
Homosexuals should not be in the military, according to Judith Reisman, director of the Institute for Media Education in Arlington, Va. 
In her lecture, "Homosexuals in the Military: The Scientific Facts," Reisman addressed the issue of homosexuality in the military to a group comprised primarily of Notre Dame's ROTC students. 
"It is both unfair to homosex­uals because they absolutely need therapy and they deserve it," she said. "Early trauma needs to be addressed. " 
According to Reisman, ho­mosexuality is a significant concern because there has been a change in the notion of homosexuality and it is vital to be aware of homosexuals be­cause the military is a defense mechanism. 
"You must have facts. You must be knowledgeable on this issue," she said. 
Some researchers believe 10 percent of the population is homosexual, she added. Ac­cording to Reisman the main­stream homosexual magazine, Advocate, has about 70,000 readers. 
"There is no reason why 10 percent of the people should be represented by 70,000 readers, "said Reisman. 
"The only way to change laws in the US was to be_able to walk into a judicial situation and say science has proven something else, " Reisman said. "We have science with an agenda, a sex­ual agenda." 
According to Reisman one cannot say homosexuality is in­born. "There is no data to sustain the premise that people are born homosexual in any way, shape, or form," said Reisman. 
"There must be the same percentage of homosexuals born cross-culturally to be a pattern of behavior. If not, then it is an environmental depen­dence." 
In the military framework, the young military population is extremely susceptible to seduc­tion, according to Reisman. The younger generation has a propensity for sex, she added. 
"There is an acceptance among homosexual groups that

children are viable sexual ob­jects," she said. She said that there has been consistent reit­eration by certain groups to end the age of consent which would make it legal for adults to copulate with children. 
"When you're talking about someone who is homosexual, you're talking about someone who is in pain," said Reisman. According to Reisman there are three primary health hazards in the gay community: AIDS, substance abuse, and gay bashing. 
"In the military, you cannot have a leader of the same sex who is attracted to you; there is a tremendous capacity for abuse," she said. "For exam­ple, they might derive pleasure from making you do 1,000 push ups and get a kick out of it," she added. 
"The fact is that science is unfortunately a political issue."

C.A.R.E. stresses importance of support 
News Writer 
The most important thing to do for a friend who has been sexually assaulted is not to take control away from the victim, according to a panel of the Campus Alliance for Rape Elimination (C.A.R.E.) mem­bers. 
Notre Dame students Michele Cummings, Sheila Buckman, and Tyler Moore of C.A.R.E. spoke about the importance of support for the victim at a panel held at Saint Mary's as part of Sexual Assault Awareness Week. 
They encouraged friends of

victims to be there for support, but not to ask questions, place blame, or encourage legal ac­tion. "Let the victim know that you believe him or her," said Buckman. 
They said that a stigma is still attached to rape and its victims. When a friend confides in an­other about being assaulted, it is important not to tell anyone else without her approval. 
The panel recommends en­couraging the victim to seek medical attention, especially if the rape occurred within 48 hours, since it may result in a sexually transmitted disease, internal injuries, or pregnancy. 
C.A.R.E. emphasized that rape is not about sex, but about violence and control. Cummings said that it is, "an unforgettable physical and psychological violation of one's whole being." 
The panel encourages friends of victims to seek help through counseling offices or the Sex Offense Services (SOS). Because being the friend of a rape or sexual assault victim can be a "heavy weight to carry," they recommended discussing feel­ings of anger, frustration, and fear. 
For male friends of female victims, Moore said to avoid promises of revenge and to be sensitive to the victim's feelings of violation. 
Statistics show that 1 in 6 women on college campuses have been sexually assaulted. Many of these assaults occur on campuses after dances, espe­cially when alcohol is involved. However, "Alcohol is not an ex­cuse for rape," said Buckman. 
C.A.R.E. was founded 6 years ago by students and adminis­trators of Notre Dame, Saint Mary's, Holy Cross, and IUSB. Their main focus is prevention of sexual assault through awareness and advocacy pro­grams for victims. 
The activities of the week are intended to raise awareness of the occurrence of assault on campus and in the community. If you or someone you know has been victimized by rape, you may call the Sex Offense Services (SOS) of Madison Cen­ter at 289-HELP to speak with a trained counselor. 
This evening C.A.R.E. will present a Peer Harassment Panel at 7 p.m. in Siegfried Hall's Chapel Lounge.

Compromise for gays proposed 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Sen. Sam Nunn suggested a com­promise or. homosexuals in the military Monday: Making per­manent the interim policy of simply not asking recruits about sexual orientation. 
That policy, put in place by President Clinton, "is rather a good place to be.... It may be a pretty good place to end up," said Nunn as his Armed Ser­vice Committee opened hear­ings on the issue. 
But, he added, "it's not going to be satisfactory to the groups that want to lift the ban. So it doesn't solve the problem so far as a large portion of this is concerned." 
Nunn, 0-Ga., and most of his committee have opposed Clin­ton's proposal to do away with the ban. And there was no indication in Monday's opening statements that those opinions had changed. 
"Am I open minded as we begin? Not completely, I must concede," said Sen. James Exon, 0-Neb. 
Sen. Lauch Faircloth, R-N.C., said of the ban, "There were good reasons for it in the first place, and nothing has changed now." 
The session was dedicated to expert testimony on the legal history and constitutional is­sues surrounding the dispute. The Constitution gives Congress clear authority to act, but the implications of what­ever action is taken could be complex and difficult, the wit­nesses said. 
Although other nations allow homosexuals in the military, cultural, legal and other differ­ences might make those cases poor models for determining what problems might ensue for 
U.S. forces, they said. 
There is also only limited value, they said, in comparing the issue with the integration of blacks into the services nearly a half century ago, or the more recently expanded role of women. 
Without "letting the genie out of the bottle, we won't know for certain," said David Bur­relli, a defense analyst at the Library of Congress. 
The panelists were dismissed as "cardboard witnesses," by Thomas Stoddard, director of the Campaign for Military Ser­vice, a group of gay-rights and civil liberties organizations formed to fight the ban. 
"We call upon Senator Nunn to call to testify in future hear­ings individual men and women who have actually borne the brunt of this policy," Stoddard said. "It is not an ab­stract legal issue that college experts can tell us about." 
Nunn's hearings were called after Clinton and Congress tus­sled in January over the presi­dent's insistence that the mili­tary gay ban be lifted. 
The president ordered the military to stop asking recruits about sexual orientation, but further action was put on hold while Congress holds its hear­ings and a Pentagon inquiry is completed. 
White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said Clinton did not want to prejudge the results of the Pentagon review. 
Guide

and Arnold, the idea of a stu­dent guide to professors and courses originated at schools in the east. 
"They've used it at Harvard and MIT, and it's been really successful," Petrovic said. " 
She added that the idea for The Guide was part of the cam­paign platform for student body president-elect Frank Flynn and vice president-elect Nikki Wellmann, and student gov­ernment hopes that it will im­prove professors' teaching styles and overall communica­tion ability. 
"I just think it could benefit students in general," she said. "It should end up being really universal." 
The Guide will be available next fall to help students regis­ter during the 1994 spring semester.

Four minors were also cited for underage drinking. 
Those given citations will have two options, according to Feirrell. The first is to partici­pate in a pre-trial diversion program, which is an alterna­tive to prosecution in which the individual will probably receive a fine, be required to perform community service and be on non-reporting probation for a period of six months to one year. 
If at the end of this period there have been no other viola­tions, the charges will be dropped and the individual's record expunged, said Feirrell. 
The other available option would be for the individual to plead not guilty to the citation and set a court date, he said.

African-Americans who as­sociate pr~dominantly with white people are trying to bridge the gap with good inten­tions, but as a result their own community writes them off, said Chandra Johnson. 
"This is detrimental to a rela­tionship with a wider African­American circle." 
Kenya Johnson agreed, saying "There's a problem with denying your culture and not identifying with it." 
Her personal experience at NO being a part of both interra­cial and African-American communities "makes me more of what I am. You can't isolate yourself from blacks. It is

women reaching the top of the legal profession do indeed ex­ist." 
In addressing gender bias, Abrahamson stated, "Male judges and male attorneys, as well as both female and male court personnel, seem to treat women with less dignity and respect than they do men, and seem to accord less credibility towards women." 
Abrahamson said that there are "several concrete reasons for us to be hopeful," but that "women judges and lawyers are for the most part still tokens in the courtrooms and in the profession, yet we should regard ourselves as beacons of change." 
She told the audience that "we stand today on the brink of a great transformation of the legal profession. For the first time a woman lawyer heads the United States Justice De­partment." 
In closing her speech, she stated that "it is possible to change institutions and society before they change us ... There is much to indicate that my hope for the future is well detrimental to the self and cul­ture. It doesn't have to be one way or the other." 

Racism is due to a general lack of understanding, said Kenya Johnson who received racially harassing phone calls this year. "It was the first time I was discriminated against based solely on my ethnicity." 
While Chandra Johnson has not personally felt bothered by racism, her peers and class­mates have reached out to her concerning race related prob­lems with rectors, friends and others. 
"It is a lot due to the fact that we don't know how to get along with each other's stuff," she said. 
Ly also has not experienced discrimination but is aware of racially motivated stereotypes. She said others expect her to excel academically because she is Asian. 
"I am human also and I do get 
women in the law profession. The women presented a gen­erally favorable picture of life at the Notre Dame law school, sighting only slight incidences of sexism in the classrooms. Jeannine Davis, law school class of 1980, stated, "I never felt different in the law school." 
When discussing the experi­ences of the panel members, Karen DeSantis, law school class of 1986, echoed the feel­ings of Judge Abrahamson, saying, "many strides have been made but there are still many many strides to be taken." 
DeSantis went on to say that the "glass ceiling" which keeps women from reaching the top levels of their professions "truly does exist." She cited many causes, including the fact that women do not as yet have the same network systems that men C's and D's. It is not dis­crimination but out of igno­rance that people assume all Chinese people should get A's. Some stereotypes are flat out wrong." 
"The key to getting along is the need to continually thinking of what is right," added Mar­lowe. People try to change to meet the American ideal; choices should not sacrifice righteousness. 
There is hope in the future for cultural diversity, according to Ly. "We need to keep trying to reach each other and there will be a meeting place."

Lecturer discusses roots of pornography in America 
By CHRISSY HALL News Writer 
The desensitization of Amer­ica's present culture can be at­tributed to pornography, ac­cording to Judith Reisman of the Institute for Media Educa­tion in Arlington, Va., in her lecture, "Media and Sexuality." 
Reisman, who has specialized in human sexuality for the last twenty years, turned to many social sources to explain this si­tuation. 
She began her lecture by asking the males in the audi­ence to stand. Men, she said, must be addressed on these is­sues, for they are the ones who "defend the hearth, the home, the women, and the children; it is the men who will either make it or break it." 
She then read a passage from the pastoral response of the Vatican in 1989 on pornogra­phy. It stated that "soft core porn can have a gradually de­sensitizing effect on its audi­ence [by encouraging] the con­sideration of persons as objects rather than persons." 
According to Reisman, the popularization of pornography is largely due to the Kinsey re­ports conducted in the late for­ties and early fifties. 
This "swing" period of the sixties did not last for long, but Kinsey became the "father of human sexuality and sex edu­cation," said Reisman. 
In her book "Kinsey, Sex, and Fraud," Reisman exposes the gross sexual misconduct of Kinsey's research on 317 chil­dren, ranging in age from two months to fourteen years. 
Moreover, the population used for Kinsey's data fails to represent a common cross­section of our society, said Reisman. 1\venty-five percent of those interviewed were in jail for sexually related crimes, while four percent were male prostitutes. She added that many of the females involved were also prostitutes, partly be­cause most married women refused to answer the questions that were asked by the researchers. 
She said that the most shock­ing conclusion from a portion of the Kinsey report states mo­lestation "does not do the child any harm... It is when social workers and the police get in­volved that the problems arise." 
"Sex science," said Reisman, "for the most part is fraud. It's just not viable." 
Reisman included an audio­visual presentation that dealt with the unity of brain, mind, and images. "What we see and feel affects our minds forever," she said. "The images on tele­vision and in photographs reg­ister as true and real in your brain. They actually have a physical effect on the human brain." 
Memories, according to Reisman as well as other spe­cialists, are stored biologically. In just seconds, an image will leave a trace that lasts for years. 
Reisman advised reading her books, "so you won't be part of the problem, but be part of the solution."

Recommendations discussed at C.L.C. 

By KATIE MURPHY News Writer 
The Campus Life Council 
(CLC) discussed the final rec­ommendations of the task force on hall semi-formals and pro­posals to improve the role of hall judicial boards in a meeting yesterday afternoon. 
The recommendations of the task force, headed by former HPC co-chair Marianne Ravry, conclude a year of research and discussion with students and rectors, according to Ravry. 
The semi-formal revisions proposed by the task force in­clude: 
a 
non-alcoholic semi-formal for freshmen during the first month of school sponsored by the halls and the Office of Stu­dent Affairs; 

reduction 
of the number of working days needed to process a dance request from one week to three days; 

approval 
for an entire hall semi-formal would require that 70 percent of the residents agree with it and that 60 per­cent attend; 


reduction of the minimum 

amount of money that halls are required to spend per person on food and non-alcoholic bev­erages; 
permission of hall to expand the scope of their social activi­ties beyond all-hall semi-for­mals, subject to the approval of the Office of Student Affairs. 
These recommendations were approved with 13 in favor and zero opposed. Bill Kirk, as­sistant vice-president of student affairs, abstained. The vote in­sures that the CLC endorses these proposals, which will be taken into consideration when du Lac is revised. 
In other business, Rich Dele­van, executive coordinator of the legal department, presented the revised text of the CLC's judicial board recom­mendations, which will also be taken into account when du LLac is revised this year. 
The CLC voted for the mea­sures, with 11 in favor, and two abstaining. The final recom­mendations about the judicial boards include: 
regular 
meeting times in the halls for board deliberations. 

standardized 
hearing proce­dures in the halls, even if of-

MOSCOW (AP) -Lawmakers undercut President Boris Yeltsin's power again Monday· and authorized an April refer­endum to Jet voters pass judg­ment on Russia's painful eco· nomic reforms. 
Closing out a raucous, four· day emergency session, par­liament speaker Ruslan Khas· bulatov proclaimed they had blocked a presidential coup. Legislators also created a commission to investigate the defiant speech Yeltsin made to supporters Sunday, calling it an "open call for revolt." 
Yeltsin's aides scoffed at the moves by the Congress of Peo· pie's Deputies. They said Yeltsin still might call his own plebiscite, raising the prospect of two competing nationwide ballots on April 25. 
With the failure of hard-liners to vote Yeltsin from office Sun­day, the Congress session seemed to leave the president and lawmakers in a bitter draw and intensified the power struggle that has paralyzed government for nearly a year. 
The president's legal options were limited, including appeal· ing to the Constitutional Court. Some pro-Yeltsin lawmakers said his best route was simply to ignore decisions by the Congress. 
"The Congress has turned into an infernal machine for destroying civic peace and political stability," presidential spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov said. 
Khasbulatov, Yeltsin's main political rival, closed the session by accusing the president of mounting "a fairly simple attempt to commit a coup d'etat," alluding to Yeltsin's declaration of "special powers" on March 20. 

"The ninth Congress has substantially defended this constitution, which is far from perfect, in a very critical situa· tion," said a confident-looking Khasbulatov, who also survived an ouster vote by the Congress on Sunday. 
The 1,033-memher Congress is dominated by ex-Communist Party apparatchiks, factory di­rectors and state farm chiefs elected before the Soviet col· lapse. Most oppose Yeltsin's market reforms and pro-West· ern foreign policy. 
In their latest slap at his pow· ers, legislators voted 535·213 to rescind the president's 1991 decree appointing personal "representatives" in regions across Russia. Yeltsin relies on the 66 officials to promote his reforms. 
The effect of the decision was hard to gauge. In most cases, his representatives hold other positions in local governments, which they would retain despite Monday's vote. 
In their most potent resolu· tion, the lawmakers scheduled a binding referendum for April 25 to put four questions to the voters. 
Two will ask whether Russia should hold early elections for president and for parliament. A third will ask whether voters have confidence in the presi· dent. 
Voters also will be asked whether they approve of the free-market reforms Yeltsin began in 1992 -a question that presidential aides de· nounced as being designed to elicit a "no" vote.

Although opinion polls say many people support Yeltsin personally, they are angry about the economy. 
The Congress adopted amendments requiring each question to be approved by at least 50 percent of all eligible voters, instead of just those casting ballots. 
Although his ratings are high in the polls, Yeltsin would be hard pressed to attract enough people to the voting booth. In his 1991 election victory, Yeltsin won support from less than 43 percent of eligible vot~ ers -although he got more 60 percent of all votes cast. 
"The president must now prepare for. the referendum carefully," said Leonid Gure~ vich, a pro·Yeltsin lawmaker. "It will be very difficult for him to win the support of more than half, especially in the spring" during planting season. 
Hard·liners hope to force Yeltsin out of office with the confidence question, even though lawmakers admit it has no legal force. Yeltsin declared at a rally that he would resign if rejected by the voters. 
"The president has promised us he will resign if he doesn't get the people's confidence," said a hard·line leader, Sergei Baburin. "(Let's hope) he's an honest person." 
Anticipating an attempt to piggy-back Yeltsin's questions on theirs, lawmakers prohib­ited any changes to the ballot. That left Yeltsin with an option of calling a separate, non·bind· ing plebiscite on the same day if he hopes to capitalize on the people already voting.

U.S. affirms NATO cut, support for peace in Bosnia 
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -A top American defense official affirmed Monday that U.S. mili­tary forces in Europe will be cut by nearly half, a sharper re­duction than was planned by the Bush administration. 
Deputy Defense Secretary William Perry also stressed President Clinton's commitment to support -possibly with American soldiers -an international peacekeeping force in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Perry assured NATO that the decision to cut troop levels on the European continent to 100,000 from the current 187,000 would not weaken the 
U.S. role in defending its allies. 
"This is not because of a re­duced commitment to Europe, but because of a reduced threat to our collective security," he said at a joint meeting of de­fense ministers from the 16 NATO nations and 18 former Soviet bloc countries. 
Perry did not say when the cutback would be completed. But in announcing the decision in February, Defense Secretary Les Aspin said it would be no later than fiscal year 1996. Perry filled in for Aspin, who is recovering from heart surgery. 
With the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, U.S. troop levels in Eu­rope have dropped from 351,000 at the end of the Rea­gan administration. Congress urged the further reduction to 100,000, but President Bush had planned to cut levels only to 150,000 by 1996. 
Manfred Woerner, secretary­general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, said he was satisfied with the 100,000 level. 
"The new administration of President Clinton has no inten­tion of going below that num­ber, at least not before the year of 1996," Woerner said at a news conference. "And 1996 is far away." 
Some NATO allies fear Wash­ington is moving too rapidly in cutting its forces at a time of instability in Europe following the collapse of communism. Some also worry the cutback by the United States, the most powerful member of of the al­liance, will set off similar cuts by European members. 
The Europeans were com­forted by Perry's support for an eventual NATO-led peace­keeping force in Bosnia. 
"NATO should play an impor­tant role, and the United States stands ready to make a sub­stantial contribution, possibly including ground forces," he said. 
American military leaders previously expressed reluctance about getting U.S. ground forces entangled in the ethnic conflict in the former Yugoslav state. 
NATO strategists are working on plans for a peacekeeping force of 65,000 to 75,000 sol­diers to help the United Nations enforce any settlement in Bosnia. 
Some NATO nations question the alliance's ability to field such a force and suggest that former Soviet bloc countries help. 
After talking Monday with Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, Woerner said he saw no reason Russia could not participate in the operation. But Canada's defense minister, Kim Campbell, said later that Russia appeared reluctant to make many troops available.

United to buy USAir's London route 
CHICAGO (AP) -United Airlines said Monday it has agreed to buy USAir's Philadelphia-London route for $14.5 million pending approval by the U.S. and United Kingdom governments to change it to a Chicago-London route. 
Such a change would give United a nonstop link between its hub at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and its European hub at London's Heathrow Airport, a connection prohibited by an aviation pact between the two markets. 
"Our proposal provides President Clinton's administration with an early opportunity for the UK government to demonstrate its commitment to expanding air transportation between our two countries," United Chairman Stephen Wolf said in a statement. 
The route currently is between Philadelphia and London's Gatwick Airport. USAir is disposing of its three London routes, from Philadelphia, Baltimore and Charlotte, N.C., as part of its new marketing alliance with British Airways, which will continue service from those U.S. 
points. 

Under that deal, approved by the Clinton administration March 15, British Airways is investing $300 million in the struggling, Arlington, Va.-based carrier. 
U.S. government approval of an additional $450 million investment by the British carrier hinges in part on renegotiation of the aviation treaty. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena said in approving the first part of the deal that the administration was seeking "open skies" to give U.S. airlines new access to British airports. 
The United-USAir route proposal "kind of draws the issue very quickly," said John Stodden, an airlines analyst with Duff & Phelps/MCM Investment Research Co. in Chicago. 
Either party can terminate the United-USAir deal if it is not closed by May 14. Regulatory approval by that date would enable United to launch Chicago-London service by July 15, United spokesman Joe Hopkins said. 
The deal would require approval by the Department of Transportation, President Clinton and the British Ministry of Transport, Hopkins said. 
The Chicago-London route would enable United to compete with American Airlines and British Airways, both of which fly nonstop from Chicago to London. 
Chicago-based United flies to London from New York; Newark, N.J.; Washington; Seattle; San Francisco and Los Angeles. 
United's parent, UAL Corp., lost $957 million last year and is considering reducing domestic service to cut costs. The company wants to acquire the Chicago-London route to link its U.S. and European hubs and to better compete on its home turf, Hopkins said. 
"We have wanted to enter that market for a long time but have been precluded from doing so by the U.S.-UK air services agreements," he said. The 16-year-old pact limits the U.S.-United Kingdom traffic at each airport. 
United has been a leader in pressing the government to push for fewer restrictions on access by U.S. carriers to foreign markets.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Non-Athlete denied Loftus access 
Dear Editor: 
This past Wednesday, I went over to Loftus Center to carry out my usual regiment of Army Physical Fitness Training. It was 6:15 p.m., and the track was supposed to be open for my use. However, much to my chagrin, I was turned away from the entrance and told, "Sorry, the track's closed. On Mondays and Wednesdays, when the weather's like this, the football team practices in here until 8:~0." 
"When the weather's like this," I pondered. On Wednes­day evening it was 45 degrees and partly cloudy -pretty fierce weather! Now don't get me wrong, because I'm a big fan. But heck, maybe the foot­ball team is really a bunch of sissies who don't like to be cold. Maybe they could have been frostbitten. Maybe it's been five years since they've won a Na­tional Championship because they can't handle such brutal South Bend weather anymore. Nevertheless, it was access de­nied for me. And that meant exercise denied. 

My choice to pursue a career as an Army officer may not have the glamour and tradition that Notre Dame Football has, but nevertheless it is what I want to be. And in facilitating that end, I need rigorous exer­cise as much as the football team needs practice to win. If I can stomp around on Ranger Field in sub-zero wind-chill weather, I do believe my com­paratively colossal peers on the football team can handle a pleasant 45 degrees without too much suffering. 
If you want to exercise at Loftus on a Monday or Wednesday evening, you might be able to. It all depends on Lou's feelings about the weather. Why doesn't Notre Dame build a football facility separate from Loftus? Why is it that the privileges of non-var­sity athlete students are so nonchalantly denied? Why do I feel as though none of our head honchos will pay any attention to my complaint? Oh yeah, I forgot-unlike a Division I ath­lete, I'm not considered an as­set.

when the opportunities presented themselves. 

Kentucky returns to its glory days
It was precisely on these fast­

breaks that the Irish defensive line picked up three points on the afternoon. 
In the first quarter, junior Pete Senger made a long run into the Butler zone, and after a nice give and go from Randy Colley, scored his first goal of the season. 
Fellow defensemen Mike Iorio and Billy Gallagher, both sopho­mores, assisted on goals in the game, providing a nice com­pliment to both the midfield and the offense. 
Being part of transitions was "something we thought about at the beginning of the year", said Gallagher. "The coaches stressed to us the importance of being more offensive minded and being part of the break." 
"Transitions are when you get most of your points, so it's good when the defense pushes the ball," Corrigan added. 
Because the Irish got out to such a large lead early in the game, it gave the coaches a good opportunity to play the second and third lines and get them game experience. 
These younger players responded well by tacking on nine more goals in the second half, and were led by junior attacker Mark Hexamer and senior midfielder Tom Carroll who each tallied three points on two goals and an assist. 
Notre Dame's domination of Butler was complete in every aspect of the game as the Irish led in the key statistics of ground balls and faceoffs won. 
Senior Chip Lonsdale won 16 out of his 19 faceoffs in the game, continuing his dom­inance of opponent faceofT men after a season that saw him set the Notre Dame record with 219 faceoffs won. 
"We've come back in a hurry," said Bill Kightley, Kentucky's equipment manager since 1962. "It doesn't take a lot to excite me, but this might be the epitome of excitement." 
Kightley points to one person as the reason for the Wildcats' turnaround -coach Rick Pitino, who took over after Ed­die Sutton quit in March 1989. 

"We were very fortunate to get a coach who's a hard worker who doesn't stand for anything but success," Kightley said. "You don't get this kind of success unless you're a hard worker. Rick gets out and works for this." 
In 1990, with only eight play­ers on scholarship, Pitino led Kentucky to a 14-14 record and fourth place in the Southeast­ern Conference. That year, Kentucky lost its status as the winningest college basketball team. The Wildcats have 1,560 wins, second to North Carolina's 1,568. 
Kentucky improved to 22-6 in 1991. Last year the Wildcats went 29-7, losing to Duke on Christian Laettner's last-second overtime shot in the East Re­gional championship. 

U.S. Rep. Scotty Baesler, who played for Kentucky from 1962­63, said it's Pitino's leadership that has turned the Wildcats into one of the country's best teams. 
"I think his style fits the '90s pretty well," said Baesler, now a freshman in Congress and a former Lexington mayor. "He obviously motivates the players even beyond their ability." 
Ledford said he still finds it hard to believe Kentucky has regained prominence this quickly. 
"I think the man has done just an incredible job," he said of Pitino. "It's almost beyond belief."

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -Just four years ago, Kentucky's basketball program was in trouble. After their first losing season in more than 60 years, the Wildcats were facing the prospect of stiff NCAA sanc­tions. 
Now the Wildcats are back in the Final Four. Did anyone think the program would be restored this soon? 
"Lord no," said Cawood Led­ford, Kentucky's play-by-play announcer for 39 years. "Not this soon. I thought it would be four or five years until they were respectable." 
Kentucky will compete in its first Final Four since 1984 on Saturday night when it plays Micl:tigan in New Orleans. The Wildcats clinched the Southeast regional title during the week­end with a 106-81 victory against Florida State. 
Ledford, who retired from announcing last year, was with the Wildcats during the good years -two of Kentucky's five championships in 1958 and 1978. And he was with them for that one lean season in 1989. 
"It was just a miserable, mis­erable year," said Ledford, who hasn't decided if he will travel to New Orleans to watch Kentucky play. "It was the only rotten year in my 39 years. They didn't play well. They had no interest to play." 
The Wildcats went 13-19 that season, their worst record since 1926-27 and Kentucky's losses ever. Kentucky's six defeats in Rupp Arena also were a high. 
In May 1990, NCAA officials considered banning Kentucky's basketball program. Instead, the Wildcats were

Iowa, OSU ready for Atlanta 
IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) ­Three cheers for the Big Ten Conference. OK, maybe just two 
one for each of the league's teams in the NCAA women's Final Four. 
After going the first 11 years of NCAA women's basketball without getting a team in the Final Four, the Big Ten now has half the field. And one is certain to be in the championship game. 
Third-ranked Ohio State and No. 4 Iowa, the league's co­champions, will meet in the national semifinals at The Omni in Atlanta on Saturday. Van­derbilt plays Texas Tech in the other semifinal. with the win­ners to meet Sunday for the championship. 
"It's truly great for our con­ference," Ohio State coach Nancy Darsch said Monday. "It 'ust sends a message to the people of the Midwest that we do have quality basketball and hopefully a message to the rest of the country, too, that the Big Ten has finally arrived." 
It would have been difficult to make that claim earlier. 
!though Iowa and Ohio State have dominated the Big Ten ­they've won or shared all but one league title since 1981 ­neither had made much of a mark in NCAA play until now.

seating capacities. Previously, the grounds have been reffered to as the 'field across from Eck.' Miller pushed for new facilities, and her wish was granted. A shiny seven foot fence surrounds the well manicured field, and two spacious dugouts will keep the players away from distractions and weather. 
Besides a new complex, Miller has lured some of the top recruits in the nation to South Bend. Just a couple of years ago, the team was made up of mainly Midwesterners. Right now, the players hail from 11 different states, including four from California. 
With a great recruiting class combined with solid upper­classmen, Miller has been able to schedule some of the tough­est teams in the nation. 
So far. Notre Dame has faced seven regionally ranked teams. While we rested over spring break, the team travelled from coast to coast playing 14 games

Both had reached the regional finals twice before losing ­Ohio State in 1985 and 1987, Iowa in 1987 and 1988. Ohio State didn't even make the NCAA tournament in 1991 and 1992, while Iowa lost its first NCAA game in each of those years. 
This year, though, both de­feated some of the big names in women's basketball to earn their trips to Atlanta. 
Iowa (27-3), seeded second in the Mideast, knocked off Old Dominion, Auburn and Ten­nessee in regional play. Those three schools have combined for 12 Final Four appearances, four national titles and four national runner­up finishes. 
Ohio State (27 -3), the top seed in the East, beat Western Ken­tucky and Virginia in its last two regional games. Each of those schools has made three Final Four appearances and both were in last year. 
"I think this says or means that our program is on par with several other programs that have been to the Final Four," said Darsch, whose team was 11-17 only two years ago. "We certainly like to think that it is the beginning, hopefully, of an era for Ohio State." 
in ten days. 

The exposure of playing away against excellent teams gave Notre Dame a chance to improve their game. 
Notre Dame softball used to be a punching bag for good teams. The Irish would provide an occassional scare to a ranked opponent, but victories were sparce. 
Miller and her squad want to change that perception. Miller personally arranged the schedule to give her team the best opportunity to make a dent on the national scene. 
For the past three weeks, the girls have worked out in Loftus, and played 16 games away from home. Today, begins a new era for Notre Dame soft­ball. 
The game has the makings of a classic. Christening a new field in the home opener, playing a good opponent, and showcasing talented players. A large crowd could put the Irish over the top. 
SMC track pleased with performance 
By BETH REGAN Assistant Saint Mary's Editor 
Although only scoring one point in Saturday's track meet at Wheaton, the Belles made a good effort and came out feel­ing confident despite the large point discrepancy. 
"We did a great job, consider­ing that we were one of the few 
Division III teams at the  meet."  
commented  coach  Larry  
Szczechowski.  

The Belles competed against Division I teams Marquette, Chicago State, Park Side Uni­versity, and Division II teams Wheaton and Triton to name a few. 
"It was a tough first outdoor meet because it was against difficult teams, but I think that we did welL" said co-captain Cheryl Fortunak. 
Placing sixth in the triple jump, with a 30' 10 1/4" jump, Joann Weed was the sole scorer for the Belles. 
''I'm just glad that I could contribute and that we could score against these powerful teams," noted Weed. 
Kerri McKinley tied her per­sonal record in the long jump with a 12'2" jump and beat her personal record with a 25'10" triple jump, however she sprained her ankle while at­tempting the triple jump. 
"Kerri has come a long way," said Szczechowski, "hopefully her injury will not hold her back for too long." 
"We had a lot of team support which was evident when I hurt myself." commented McKinley. "Even though track is an indi­vidual sport, we perform excep­tionally well as a team." 
The Belles made a decent showing in the javelin event considering that it was a first for all of the participants. Amy Mertz made the finals with a
