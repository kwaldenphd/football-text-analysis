Voting Today For Fee Boost, 
Notre Dame will go to the polls again today with the election of five National Student Association delegates and a ref­erendum for increasing the student acti­vities fee to ten dollars per semester making up the two items on the ballot. 
Voting will be in the halls from II :30 to 1:00andfrom5:00to7:00. 
Fifteen students are con tending for the five delegate seats Notre Dame is alloted at the NSA Convention. Seeking these positions are Student Body President Richard Rossie, Mike McCauley, Bill Luk­ing, Mike Kendall, Steve Ahern, Dave Burch, Bob Campbell, John Hickey, Larry Landry, Richard Linquanti, Mike Mead, Tom Taylor, Bob Rigney, and Don Wycliff. The five students receiving the highest vote totals will be designated delegates and the students with the sixth through tenth highest totals will be offic­ial alternates. 
The student fee increase referendum is a proposal to increase the student acti­vities fee from its present level of ten dollars per year to ten dollars per semes~ ter. 
In a letter released yesterday Student Body President Richard Rossie stressed the areas of the Academic Commission and Student Government sponsored Hall improvement as the two areas which par­ticularly caused him to support the in­crease in activities fee. 
According to Rossie the additional sixty thousand dollars which the increased fee would add to Student Government's revenue would be alloted in the following 
manner:  
Academic Commission  $10,000  
Arts Festival  6,000  
Course Evaluation Book  2,000  
Free University  2,000  
Hall Life Fund  20,000  
Incorporated Study  1,500  
Li:erary Festival  6,000  
Observer  4,500

SBP Bans Demonstrations, Asks Protest "Moratorium" 
"A moratorium for the rest of the year on all student protests" will be asked for by Student Body President Richard Rossie in a letter to students today. Rossie said yesterday that he is asking for the moratorium as an "act of good faith and trust" on the part of the 
students following Sunday's meeting with an ad hoc committee of the Board of Trustees. 
The letter states that "Student Gover­
nment will not call for any demon­
strations uniess extraordinary circumsta­
nces forces it to break the moratorium." 
If students strongly object to any ac­
tion of the Administration during the 
remainder of the year the letter says 
Rossie "will personally register an official 
complaint against any such action." 
Further on in the letter Rossie writes, 
"I want to urge all students not to take 
any action which might endanger our 
cause. We must show we are indeed 
responsible and can conduct our own 
affairs." 

Finally, Rossie writes, "Also I would 
like to point out that there are indivi­
duals (some in high places, perhaps) who 
conceivably would like to see us take ir­
rational actions and thus endanger our 
chances of getting the changes to which 
we are justly entitled." 

Although the letter says "all student 
protests," Rossie said it does not include 
war demortstrations. "The Presidential 
Review protest is not included, but civil 
disobedience protests are." 

Lyons Hall Senator Jon Sherry said of 
the letter, "I don't think a directive of the Student Body President will halt any demonstration of the students again­st war and on behalf of Student Power. It will not stop the ROTC Presidential 
Sherry also said that Rossie had pro­mised him that if Sherry's bill repudia­ting Dean of Students Rev. James Riehle's directive and reaffirming the students' right to demonstrate was passed by the Senate that Rossie himself would call for a demonstration. The bill is on Thursday's agenda. 
Rossie "should have consulted the people it will effect, the 200 or so radicals. Democracy works within the 
student body as well as outside or it. We would demonstrate against the dic­tates of the SBP as well as the dictates of the Administration," said Sherry. 
Sophomore Sam Boyle agrees with Sherry. He said that the letter implied that the "so-called" group of students want to demonstrate for anything. "If there is a just reason, students are obliged to demonstrate." 
Boyle does not think a halt of the 
Review protest is necessary to Rossie's 
aims. He said he would not organize a 
demonstration on parietal hours, for in­
stance, because he thought that was 
Rossie's job as SBP and "I would not 
infringe upon his right." 
Vice-President for Student Affairs Rev. 
Charles I. McCarragher, C.S.C., thinks the 
moratorium will be effective and the 
students will observe it. "I think this 
is a change of mind for Rossie. This 
is the non-violent Rossie. He is beginning to use the same tactics as Martin Luther King," Fr. McCarragher said. 
He also added, "There are some in­nuendoes about 'some in high places' that could be clarified." 
Farley Hall president and executive coordinator Mike McCauley called the request, "a brilliant diplomatic move. He sincerely believes something good will happen soon." McCauley said he thinks Rossie has more support from the student body than any other ~~~ 
in the University's history. ' 
According to McCauley, "There may be a dispute among student activists who think the way to change is through revolution." 
Rossie, McCauley and Vice-President Chuck Nau were all optimistic at the outcome of the Board of Trustees meet­ing. McCauley said, "The biggest point of agreement of all was the immediate ne.ed for a tripartite board having authori­ty over all areas of student affairs. Frs. McCarragher and Riehle would be on the board but would have no dictatorial rights." 
Rossie said, that at any rate, there would certainly not be a permanent structure until next year, but that his office will operate in the spirit of what will come." He said he made it clear at the meeting that there should be a minimum of 50% students on the board. 
According to Nau, "the Board of Trustees has only been in existence for about a year. There's a lot they have to learn about students. The next meeting will be a more productive one." 
Mayor Lindsay To Support Gov. Rockefeller 
BY GUY DE SAPIO 
Mayor John Lindsay of New York 
City told a crowd of more than I300 
people in Stepan Center last night that 
he supported Governor Nelson Rockefeller 
"all the way" for the Republican nom­
ination for President of the United States. 
Lindsay outlined in his speech the 
challenge that America faces in its cities. 
Lindsay said that the present administra­
tion has failed to reach its potential 
in dealing with the problems of the cities 
as a "direct consequence of the war in 
Vietnam." The audience responsed en­thusiastically as he attacked the war, interrupting that part of his speech six 
times with applause. 
"As a people," Lindsay said, "we seem to be terribly divided and terribly fearful, tense and withdrawn. We somehow have lost a sense of national direction ­the challenges it imposes, the promises it offers." 
Lindsay said that it is difficult to predict the course that the country will take to solve its problems. The evidence is contradictory, he said. He reported how "five-thousand people volunteered" to help clean up a New York slum. 
But he was fearful, he said, because "Congressmen report that the majority of their mail seeks a much tougher attitude toward the black communities in the cities, both positively-in the form ofaggressive police tactics, and negatively-
by curtailing city-orientated social welfare programs to the slums. 
Lindsay stated how the National Ad­visory Commission on Civil Disorders had reported how "our nation is moving toward two socities, one black, one white­separate and unequal." 

MAYOR JOHN LINDSAY "We face now a new test of our honesty and purpose in confronting the problems described in the Commission 
Report and exposed in the streets of our nation this month," Lindsay said. "In New York City we're trying to follow a policy which consists of nothing more spectacular than fairness and com­mon sense." 
"We don't agree that police should shoot to kill arsonists and fire upon looters indiscriminately . . once the shooting starts, it is almost certain to perpetuate itself. Our hope is to keep that first shot from being fired." 
Lindsay said that city governments would have to enlist the support of the people to prevent violence. In Harlem, "They helped because they trusted us and it took long months of work to creat that trust." 
The mayor said that the help of the young people must be enlisted in order to support the efforts. Young people 
must be placed "in positions of respon­sibility." For middle-aged and older people the 
promise of a change was enough, Lindsay 
said. "Today the promise is not enough 
for the young. They want change now. 
They have seen what lies outside the 
ghetto and they want in: they want the 
same chance that everyone else has." 
Lindsay termed the response of the country to the Commission Report "dis­heartening." He said that the present administration's potential to deal with the problems had not been reached as a "direct consequence of the war in Vietnam." 
Lindsay attacked the war and com­
mended students for focusing the atten­
tion of the nation on it. "You marched and demonstrated," he said, but "your dissent was fragmented and misdirec­ted. It failed because it missed the basic source of power in this country." 
Twenty Arrested In Sit-In 
Twenty to twen.ty-five Notre Dame students were arrested while participating in a sit-in in the office of South Ben<J Superintendent of Schools, Charles Holt, Mon. night. The students were supporting a protest organized by the South Benp Chapter of the NAACP Youth Council. More than 100 South Bend adults were also arrested. 
The students were protesting, accordltlg 
to a member of the group, the fact that 
armed policemen are patroling the halls 
and school yards of some South Bend 
Schools. According to a spokesman for the students, they entered the office of the Superintendent at 3:30 Mon. afternoon. He said they were "warned repeatedly" that if they did not leave by I1 P.M. they would be arrested for tresspassing. At II:15, he said, the South Bend Police Chief entered the office and told 
them that they had 10 minutes to leave. They refused to leave and were arrested at 11:45 P.M.

play in alleviating the domestic ills of America. He pointed out

"I am gratified by the social

many students and "leaders" were "astute at only pointing out what's wrong, but have little creativity 
when 1t comes to how it will be corrected." I can't believe that if they put their minds to it, they can't come up with a solution." 
Young said that many liberals were "adept at identifying in jus­tice when it's far away." He said that as a rule it seemed that the further away the injustice "the greater the intensity of concern. Some people today are concerned about the little brown people who are fighting in Viet-Nam, while two blocks away, little brown people are starving." 
Those who are against pro­gress have a real conviction about it," Young said. "The general problem with the liberals is that they don't have the same stamina as the conservatives." As an exam-pie, Young pointed out how twen­ty Southern Senators can bottle up domestic legislation and how right-wing elements such as the Klu Klux Klan are so devoted to their cause that they spend count­less hours on their work.

The Selection Committee would accept nominations be­ginning in late May and conti­

Narucki said. "Now, less than two years la.ter, Richard Rossie and his bureaucracy are seeking a one hundred per cent increase

We students have been kept in the dark long enough, and should know exactly where our money will be spent, before approving such a proposal. Mr. Rossie has been too general in 
his rational, for this increase. Y AF demands to know why this proposal is necessary, and pre­cisely which of our student needs will be fulfilled."

Hester: Viet WarGenocidal 
BY DAVE BACH 
Retired Brigadier General Hugh B. Hester, himself a parti­cipant in two world wars, con­demned United States partici­pation in the Vietnamese "civil war" yesterday as "illegal, im­moral and now genocidal." He made the statement in an infor­mal address to a sparse group of 25 in the Law Auditorium. 
The general retired in 1951 in opposition to the Korean War which he termed a "civil war" and an American intervention in foreign domestic affairs. 
The claim of illegality was built up after an explanation of the U.S.'s entrance into Vietnam, the roots of which were buried in the beginning of the cold war. 
In 1949 the U.S. intervened 

in the civil war of China by help­ing Chaing Kai Chek and his na­tionalist Chinese get to Formosa, setting an example for U.S. in­tervention in other internal af­fairs. The U.S. then began finan­cing the French in the Indo­Chinese War under President Truman. The Eisenhower ad­minsitration continued this sub­sidy. 
After Dienbienphu in 1953, the treaty which settled the war called for elections to be held in 1956. Here, however, General Hester claimed that Secretary of State John Dulles persuaded President Eisenhower to appoint Ngo Dinh Diem the chief of state of South Viet Nam. "Dulles was not only secretary of state, but he made foreign policy," accor­ding to Hester. 
In August, 1 Y54, Hester claims that Eisenhower explained U.S. involvement in Vietnam this way: "We are not there (in ~lietnam) for any idealistic pur­pose. We are there to get supplies that we need." The President's statement made no mention of any military or even economic commitments to Vietnam. Hester then claimed that President Johnson knows this fact, and ig­nores it. 
In the '60's, Hester asserted that Diem was initiating talks with Hanoi when Henry Cabot Lodge flew back from a Washing­ton conference and carefully let out the fact that the U.S. would not oppose a coup. "WE placed Diem and every other successor in Vietnam, if not through selec­tion, then through approval. .. These governments do not repre­sent anyone but the people in Washington who put them there."

The most recent legal claim, the Tonkin Resolution, was a fraud. The attacks on the Maddox and Turner Joy "never have been shown to be true as a fact that occurred." Even if the attack oc­curred, however, the United States ignored the UN charter in which "we promised not to act unilaterally unless we were faced by invasion," he reasoned. 
He based his claim of immora­lity on the fact that we are inter­vening in foreign internal affairs as a practice. "This country will pull the pillars of the world down if it does not reverse itself and substitute international co-opera­tion for international conflict.'' 
He dismissed the communist threat by stating that "instead of fighting communism, we are 
NewmanHere For Gene Speaks At ND, SMC 
Campaigning for Senator Eugene McCarthy on campus yesterday, actor Paul Newman said, "I have six children. When they bury me, I don't want them 
to be able to say I wasn't a part 
of my own time." About 700 students took part of their time 
to see Newman, who appeared at both Saint Mary's and Notre Dame to appeal for canvassers for the Democratic primary in May. 
Newman said that McCarthy's candidacy made possible a new sort of politics, which "may well turn into what is true, what is moral, what is ethical.'' He called Senator McCarthy a man of "extreme political courage';­who has given the people an al­ternative to which they are enti­tled, a chance to return govern­ment to the people. Striking a non-partisan note, Newman em­phasized the power of the indi­vidual to do away with machine politics and bloc voting. "It is refreshing," he said, "to have a candidate who isn't playing poli­tics with my vote." He cited the New Hampshire primary, in which what he called "a people's army" of McCarthy supporters gained a surprising victory for the Senator. 
When asked how McCarthy

The general is currently tour­
ing the country speaking against 
the war in Vietnam "No demo­
cracy can survive, no real freedom 
can be maintained if the people 
know that what is being done is 
not in their best interest and re­
main silent." 
Hester said that he supported 
the United States' role in World 
War II, and to a lesser extent, 
World War I, because they were 
wars of self-defense. He claimed 
that he was not a philosophical 
pacifist (as witness his 30 years 
in the Army) and that "if our 1 security was threatened I 
wouldn't be opposing it, but 
there's quite a bit of difference 
between self -defense and agres­
sion." 
expected to counteract Kennedy's wealth, Newman expressed confi­dence in "the young people of America, who are Senator McCarthy's capital." 
He called the Vietnam con­
flict a civil war' and said the United States should "let them 
handle it.'' After asking students to sign up as McCarthy volunteers, Newman reminded them that 500 canvassers were needed this week­end in South Bend, and suggested that young people "kick the eleven o'clock flick" in favor of getting out the vote for a man who has given youths without 
political  direction  a  chance  to  
make  their  presence  known in  
national politics.  

After leaving Notre Dame, Newman spent the rest of the afternoon speaking at the store front headquarters in town to over two thousand people, many of whom called him "the best thing that's ever happened to South Bend." Newman's son, Scott, joined his father at the Miami and Ewing Streets head­quarters which Scott flew here to manage. Newman said he was proud of his son's efforts in the 
campaign, even though he is cutting classes to do it."

What Kind Of Future? 
1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 
Since the Second World War, the American novel has become more and more Black Humor. Everything is funnv but no~hing is 1explainable unless in the form of a V or a Catch-22. No~ehsts ~ake 
events from life, remove the context, and the absurdity shmes through. 
There is a reason for the change in novelists' outlook, a method in their new madness. Many of them teach or have taught-Barth at Buffalo, Vonnegut at Iowa-and many, as a consequence, have be­come familiar with the academic environment. 
"Intellectuals are the hope of the future," one St. Mary's profes­sor said. "Just ask one sometime." That's true, the first tenet of academia. Academics are amazing people, men of vision able to ~e_e beyond the real concerns of existence-the Bomb, poverty, ciVIl rights-to the peripheral. One English professor, for example, ex­plained in a one hour lecture to a first semester class why he should not be called "Dr." Another will be called "Dr." and no­thing else. Others in other departments will not converse because the first has not publis..I-Jed enough and the second has published nothing but trash. Can Yoasarin be far away and which end of the egg should be broken first, anyway? 
The liberal arts are supposed to be the disciplines most conscious 
of what man is and it is unfortunate that those who teach in the 
college seem to understand the value of that the least._ ~~ose m~st 
in command of truth evidently have the least responsibility for Its 
implimentation. If beauty and truth (beauty which is truth, ~ruth 
which is beauty) can not be had in toto, they should not be achieved 
in part, thereby leaving those most against the war, t~ose most 
against America as it is, free to golf or garden, to ente~tam the ?ut­
spoken poet of their choice. They copy a student nusconceptJon: 
beards signify committment, wearing a button will end the war. 
In English classes, they ignore what a novelist says to concentrate 
on the minutiae of how he says it. Preparation for a degree in 
English involves dissatisfaction with the written word; after three 
of four years, a critical standard has been developed, all the books, 
all the plays, conforming to that standard have been read; and all 
that is left is to read bad novels, see bad movies, and bad plays. 
Nothing can be good and that is what makes it worth reading or 
worth seeing. In retrospect, even the good novels become bad be­
cause each suffers from at least one "fatal flaw". Like conservatives, 
who consider a man completely evil because he is part evil, they 
are most entertained when they are most disappointed. Pedantry is 
its own reward. 

In all colleges, a degree, especially an advanced degree, becomes 
the excuse for castigating all who are outside the sphere of the uni­
versity. Under one lump and undesireable appleation, garbagemen 
and G.l.'s, track coaches and bankers are snubbed as "the masses", 
sometimes called the "middle class." Some work is more dignified 
than others because of the intelligence which attends it. 
Academics moan about words wasted on those who will not 
hear; but intellectuals are not heard because they are snobs. Anyone 
who favors the war cannot be talked out of his belief since his 
thinking processes do not proceed along logical avenues; anyone 
who does not agree that America is lost cannot be anything other 
than hopeless. 

It's unfortunate that those who pretend to be most on top of 
reality are actually most removed. Granted that logic does not al­
ways prevail, that people vote according to appearances and not ac­
cording to substance, that old men snore and dogs bite, that's the 
way things are and that's what has to be dealt with. 
Intellectuals may be the hope of the future; but what kind of 
future is that?

New York A. C. Saga Goes On 
One of the prime movers in Notre Dame's baseball attatck this season is first baseman Dick Licini. The Yonkers, N.Y., junior is hitting close to .300. 
By Bob Scheuler During the past Easter va­cation, two separate events added to the saga of the New York Athletic Club and the various anti-segregation campaigns being waged against it. Last Feb. 16th, the NY AC's track meet at Madison Square Garden was boycotted and pick­eted by Negro athletes because of the club's exclusion of Neg­roes from membership. Prompted by this boycott, a committee of Notre Dame alumni was form­ed by Newsweek religious editor and Notre Dame alumnus Ken Woodward, '57, to support the boycott and to ask the NYAC to explain its policies. Woodward's committee att­empted to bring pressure on the ,NYAC by getting a statement from the National Board of the Notre Dame Alumni Association against the recial exclusionary policies of the NYAC.
