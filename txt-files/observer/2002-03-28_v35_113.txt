STUDENT SENATE 

Senate rejects club allocations increase 

Senators vote on an amendment to increase club allocations during their Wednesday evening session. The amendment failed, 14-8. 
. Resolution fails despite support from student organizations 
By MEGHANNE DOWNES Assistant News Editor 
-in the final Senate meeting before the new Senate takes over, the focus of much debate was the amendment regarding the increase to club allocations. This amendment calls for clubs and organizations to receive a minimum of 40 percent of the student activity fee allo­cations, a 3.25 percent increase. Additionally, the remaining funds would be distributed among student union organizations. 
Senators heard pleas from the Club Coordination Council and the Student Union Board to increase their respective allocations. 
Kaitlyn Dudley. a represen­tative from the CCC, appealed to the senators to increase their allocation despite the benefits they will gain from the recent student activity fee increase. Citing that the increased funds will barely sustain the current and new clubs, Dudley stressed that an increase in the allocation will create better programming and increase attendance. 
Dudley proposed that a new Club Collaboration Fund be guaranteed an allocation of funds so that clubs with com­mon interests can work together in improving the quality of programming. Currently, a club must work with a student organization to receive funds. 
"Giving us our own fund would thus avoid redundancy of jurisdiction and wasted time in highly repetitive dis­cussions," said Dudley. 
Dudley acknowledged that SUB exists to cater to the common interests of the stu­dent body, however, she pointed out that students do not have a narrow set of interests and that clubs can service the many interests of students. 
"Clubs, though created to 

serve special interests, do not deserve the short shrift because their appeal is 'limit­ed.' The student body as a whole does not have one nar­row set of interests, but many," said Dudley. 
Stephen Christ, the SUB representative, began his plea by saying. "Money is best spent going to SUB." 
Citing that SUB incurs a sig­nificant deficit and that their budget is less than 1/3 of what other universities receive, Christ asked that SUB be allocated more funds in order to provide the con­certs, comedians and other programming events that stu­dents want. Also, he stated that an increase would allow for "greater risk taking" with regard to their programming. 
Stephen Christ argued that because of their training in programming, that SUB should receive the money as opposed to the CCC. At times the debate became accusato­ry as the Stephen Christ attacked the CCC's capabili­ties at programming.

ND struggles with classroom space 
. Concerns over space arise as classrooms sit unused 
By MEGHAN MARTIN News Writer 
Prompted by what he called "anecdotal evidence from both students and faculty," engineer­ing professor Joe Powers decid­ed to conduct an investigation of his own. 
Aided bv statistics from Registrar Harold Pace's office, the professor found that a sig­nificant number of classrooms remained unused during viable hours of the-day, with consider­able disparities on Fridays. 
Concerned that llis findings might he an indication that the University is not using its avail­able academic space economi­cally, Powers raised the issue at an Academic Council meeting that subsequently resulted in the formation of an investigative 
The issue of academic space management at the University has become a significant con­cern as admission rates rise and departments attempt to expand. Every college, from Architecture to Arts and Letters, has been affected in some way by what has been perceived as a lack of space allotted for academic pur­poses. 
"This is an ongoing issue here at Notre Dame, as well as at any other university -there are always space needs, space crunches -we just don't have a lot of space here at Notre Dame," said Joe Schellinger, director of academic space management. 
The problem manifests itself to students in many ways, as well. While many architecture students have been forced to relocate to Brownson Hall, stu­dents from other colleges have endured endless headaches when scheduling classes each semester often in vain attempts to obtain the courses they need

INSIDE COLUMN THIS WEEK ON CAMPUS 
In the Resurrection 

Remember way back six weeks ago to Feb. 
12. Everyone was celebrating Mardi Gras, try­ing not to think about what they were going to give up the next day when Lent began. So what has changed over the past six weeks? How has it been to not eat a particu­
lar food, watch a particular show or behave a certain way? Did you learn some­thing from your experi­ence? 
Chances are that we did learn something. We proba­bly just didn't realize we were learning it. It probably 

just happened in a regular Angela Campos aspect of our lives, almost tricking us into learning it. Other things probably hap-Lab Tech pened that weren't so ordi­nary, run-of-the-mill types of events. And though we learn from all those events, the ones we'll remember are probably the latter. 
The Jewish celebration of Passover began last night at sunset. It commemorates the Israelites' pursuit of freedom and the final plague in Egypt in which the angel of death was to kill the first-born of each house. But those households who placed lamb's blood on the lintels of the door would be protected, so that the angel would pass over their homes. They were to eat a meal as if they were ready to flee, with unleavened bread and meat with bitter herbs. 
Jesus celebrated the Passover with his apos­tles in the Last Supper, dipping the unleavened bread into the dish, and remembered his ancestors and their quest for freedom. Celebrating with his friends, he became the sacrifice, the sustenance that would lead to freedom through the captivity of sin and death. They then went out to the Garden of Gethsemani where Jesus prayed that the cup pass over his head. But he knew he was the light in the darkness, and so endured the greatest challenge -giving up his life -so that others could live in the light. 
In light of the celebration of Easter, we are called to look at the extraordinary things in our lives. We are called to look at how life chal­lenges us to be stronger, how we are to learn from those trials and how we are to die to our­selves if we are to live in Christ. Lent has been a time of reflection, giving and learning. During it, there are times when we get lost in the darkness. Laetare Sunday recalled the good things that we have in our lives, the good times we had with our friends and family, a glimpse of the Resurrection. The fullness of life that we have experienced will be a source of that glad­ness. of that hope in the darkness. 
We've all passed through our own dark times. And yet, each darkness can be matched with a ray of light. In my own life, I have recently felt darkness in the death of my grand­father. But that darkness is matched with the light that he is no longer in pain, that he was a strong, hard-working man and he will live on in every memory my family and I have of him. He is at peace now and will partake in the Resurrection when we shall all be united again. He will be with me this Easter, helping me to see the light that filled his life and the love that filled his heart, so that the sorrow I have will be lifted away that I might rejoice with him in the Resurrection. I love you Grandpa. Happy Easter.

UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO 
Fair trade coffee offers alternative 
BOULDER, Colo. 

Beginning next month, students looking for a socially conscious caffeine fix will have options at theUniversity of Colorado. The activist group Developing Areas Research and Training (DART). began a campaign in early December 2001 to have "fair trade-certified coffee" offered at university locations. The group cited concerns that coffee growers in developing nations, such as Colombia and Nicaragua, are receiving payments for their crops that are less than the costs of production. The result of such transactions, activists say, is a contin­uous cycle of poverty. "Now more than ever it is impor­tant to support fair trade," Chelsea Primak, a DART activist said. "Buying fair-trade coffee is a simple action that ordinary people can do every day to help support farming families." After meeting with university admin­istrators earlier this semester, the fair trade option will make its debut in early April at select locations in the UMC.

PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY 
Death prompts suicide prevention 
UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. None of the people who knew Jeff Tohill could explain why he took his life the weekend before 
· Pennsylania State University students returned for spring semester. Friends described the junior mar­keting major as a happy, athletic and smart person who was always willing to try new things. Suicide is the third leading cause of death for people between the ages of 15 and 24 and is a frequent concern on college campuses, said Mary Anne Knapp, Penn State staff therapist. "It is common for people to think about suicide because of all the things that are hap­pening with the academic pressure on top of it," she said. About three Penn State student suicides are reported each year, said Vickie Lucas, staff assistant to student and family services. Between 80 and 90 percent of students suffering depression, both biolog­ical and situational, respond well to therapeutic treatment, she said. Daily Collegian

SMC community remembers Sloman 
By SARAH RYKOWSKI 
News \Vrircr 
She was a mother, daughter, sister and student. To her classmates and teachers, Misty Sloman was an example in all of these roles, especially to her fel­low social w o r k majors. 
"She was a model for all social workers­she wanted to make a change," Laura Porto, a Saint Mary's junior social work major, said. "She always brought a unique side to ethical issues. She was a

nontraditional student so she could show us different argu­ments on issues." 
Sloman was killed when she veered off of a road near her South Bend home crashing her car into a tree last Saturday morning. As an older student at Saint Mary's, the 29-ycar-old impressed her classmates and her teachers with her ability to stay on top of her schoolwork, her job and raise her two young daughters. Sloman also was a member of Saint Mary's chap­ter of the National Collegiate Honor Society for Social Work. 
"l was just so impressed with how she was able to keep up with things. I could see how having children shaped her perception in class," said Saint Mary's professor Marcia Good Maust said. Good Maust taught Sloman this semester in Anthropology of Women. 
"She put a lot of effort into her own intellectual journey," Good Maust said. "She always kept up with readings and had something to say. Misty was very participatory and the stu­d ents will miss her. This makes us miss her all the more." 
Although her fellow majors found her different, because she was older and lived off campus. they considered her an asset to their classes. 
"She was not afraid to speak her mind, in and out of class," Liz Bradley, a Saint Mary's junior social work major, said. 
Sometimes, Sloman would bring her two girls, Alexandria and Sierra, to class. Porto met the girls last year when she had to meet

that Misty did was for her daughters," Bradley said. "She was a wonderful mother. I would love to be like that when I have children. She always had a smile for them." 
Her mother died of cancer when Sloman was 17, and Good Maust felt that this loss affected Sloman strongly, and made her own death at such an early age all the more poignant. 
"[Misty's death] is just so hard to handle," Good Maust said. "Her own mother died 11 years ago. Misty was so young." 
Good Maust also believed that Sloman's mother's death also inspired her to work with children who have lost par­ents. Sloman had recently learned of her placement at the Madison Center, a mental health hospital located behind St. Joseph's, where she want­ed to work with such children.

The construction of such a diverse combination of facilities will serve to alleviate current stresses in faculty offices and research space and allowing for the renovation of Nieuwland Hall into much-needed faculty research laboratories. 
Affleck-Graves believes that the University's aggressive building plan, coupled with its innovative policy of upgrading a set of classrooms each summer, will sufficiently alleviate the dilemma that revolves around academic space issues at Notre Dame. 
In a situation as all-encom­passing as space management, nearly any proposal is a step in the right direction.

Passover dinner ends lecture series 
By LIZ KAHLING 
News Writer 
Nearly 50 participants were present for a traditional Passover Seder that finished a cHscussion series titled "Passover and Judaism in the Western Tradition" this week. 
C. Spencer Beggs, one of 11 Jewish undergraduates at Notre Dame, led the meal drawing upon his family's traditions. 
The idea for the discussion series and Seder originated from Beggs' Program of Liberal Studies class, "The Bible and Its Institutions." 
"While Notre Dame has a lot of intelligent people. sometimes we get jaded by the homogene­ity on campus. I thought this would be a good way to expose people to what most haven't been exposed to before and give them a basis of understanding themselves through the eyes of a different culture," Beggs explained. 
Beggs received an e-mail in January from the College of Arts and Letters about the "Residing a World of Ideas" program that offers a grant of $1,500 for stu­dents to organize events that bring students and faculty together to discuss an issue. Beggs then contacted various pro fessors within the PLS department, students and his family for the recipes and sto­ries that are part of the Passover Seder. 
The Seder took place at Greenfield's Cafe and began at sundown and lasted approxi­mately two hours. Faculty and students were provided a Haggadah, which is the book 
.; 

that contains the story and blessings of the Passover Seder. The Haggadah. which means "to tell," has been passed down in Beggs' family for over 50 years. Beggs actually did much of the transcribing and editing for the copy provided at dinner. 
The "required" parts of the Seder are the retelling of the story of the Exodus from Egypt, eating matza, as well as other symbolic foods, and drinking four cups of wine (representing the four stages of the Exodus). 
After four cups of wine and a group reading of the allegory "Had Gadyo" Beggs compli­mented the participants, "This is the best version of Had Gadyo I've ever heard." 
The Seder meal began with five foods in remembrance of the struggle of the Israelites in their quest and journey to free­dom. Some of the food was bit­ter to remind of the bitter exo­dus, but the students and facul­ty were adventurous and tried all the foods. A dinner followed that included matza halls soup, marinated asparagus, beef brisket, arni pisto and "Heart Attack" Potatoes, a recipe from Beggs' mother. 
Priga Varghesi enjoyed the meal and learning the tradition behind it. "There's a lot of stuff in our culture that we don't know what it's all about." 
The Passover Seder was pre­ceded by discussions on both Monday and Tuesday exploring "Judaism and the West" as well as "The Symbolism and Meaning of Passover."

President for Student Affairs Father Mark l! Poorman, has failed to seriously respond to under­graduates' concerns that they were locked out of the policy-making process, and that the statistical reasoning behind the policy remains undisclosed. 
But this is no joke. 
Protests, such as Tuesday's midnight rally outside Main Building, hurt the student cause more than they help. Students laughed and posed for pictures during the rally, all the while burning copies of the student hand.book and throvving bottles ofliquor on the steps in front of the administration headquarters. At a larger March 20 rally, students also burned the handbook and delivered speeches that amollilted to little more than administration bashing and dorm cheerlcading. While such frustration and acts are understandable given the child-like way in which the administration treats the stu­dents, the student body would do well to follow the more rational leadership of student government and those present at Sunday's that releasing statistics on which the changes were 
based "wouldn't advance the discussion at this point." 
It's time to get serious. 
For students, this means behaving as thoughtful adults and show­ing concern for a variety of campus issues -not merely alcohol restrictions. CLC, Student Senate and other meetings are always open to the public and officials encourage students to voice their opinions at such venues. 
For Poonnan and the administration, it means devoting a meeting or series of meetings, and not just an e-mail or quick appearance at the CLC, to fully answering student concerns. Administrators must respect students' intelligence and provide them with an open, infor­mation-fillcd forum in which they are capable of being constructive. 
Students and administrators may reach no happy medium in this issue, but a compromise from both sides at least makes Poorman's enactment of the changes, and campus response to them more than a joke. 
LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Readers decry alcohol protests 
Actions embarrasing 
As a student of the Notre Dame community, it angers and embarasses me greatly to see my fellow students acting in such an immature and disrespectful man­ner. With the change in the alco­hol policy, are we really going to be missing out on that much? 
Inside one of the largest "drink­ing schools" in the United States, will the lack of hard liquor inside the dorms really have such a negative effect on our communi­ty? Or will it help to make it just a little more safe and a more respectful place for those who live within it? 
Students are protesting the adminitration infringing on our rights while many of these same students are given more rights by the University than are legally theirs as minors. With rights come responsabilities. 
As for the issue of discontinuing SYRs, more times than not, we forget that we have the responsi­bility to clean up after ourselves and to fix what we break. How many times have we spent a weekend in a dorm absolutely trashed after an SYR, with bath­rooms that reek of vomit and are absolutely disgusting -bath­rooms that arc left for the clean­ing people to take care of Monday morning. That is not their responsibility, but being so con­cerned with our rights, we forget our responsibility. 
I am abroad this year, so obvi­ously I do not see this firsthand, but I read in The Observer online about students protesting by throwing liquor bottles at the Dome. Please, grow up. If you want to convince the administra­tion that we are mature enough to live in community without parietals or with more freedom in regards to alcohol, behaving like wild children is not going to do it. Take a step back and look at yourselves. 
When I read reports like this it makes me feel ashamed to be a Notre Dame student. Why is liquor always such an important rallying point for Notre Dame students? Why does it seem to be the first priority? Why don't we all just take a step back, realize that this is not the end of the world as we know it and concen­trate our efforts and protests toward some cause that legiti­mately deserves our time and attention.

Churchs crisis eclipsed 
I enthusiastically concur with Mary Ann Hennessey's letter on Tuesday entitled, "Alcohol is sole motivator." During my years at Notre Dame, not even the Gulf War or the demands of Students United for Respect (SUFR) could unite the stu­dent body to action. 
A brief examination of the articles on The Observer's website reveals no cam­pus coverage of the current crisis within the Catholic Church. Why are there no calls for Father Malloy to make a state­ment regarding sexual abuse in the Church and its equally dispicable cover­up? Why haven't students written letters demanding the University disclose if any campus priests have had complaints made against them? At the very least, the intellects of the student body should be stimulated to debate the relationship (if any) between celibacy and these allega­tions of abuse. 
It is deplorable that only changes to the alcohol policy could stir the students' emotions, while the rest of nation strug­gles with the current fragile state of the Catholic Church.

One of the interesting aspects uf the work of the University's anti-sweatshop task force is that while its undertaking is enormous. its focus is limited. Simply to track the activity of the companies that make Notre Dame products requires a lot of work. The Universitv also eval­uates the· activity of the companies in light of the Church's social teaching. 
Because of the appropriately lin1it­ed focus of the sweatshop task force, there are other areas of eco­nomic activity on the part of the University that await assessment. For instance, there is not an analogous task force looking into purchasing. Ifwe should not make Notre Dame products in China because of its laws against the free­dom of association, then it would at first seem that we also should not purchase goods -for instance, desks and chairs ­made there. Such issues are highly com­plex and time-consuming to address, as I found when serving on the sweatshop task force. 
There is one area of University econom­ic activity that, while complex, is certainly within Notre Dame's capacity to assess and respond, and that regards the condi­tions and the salaries or wages of those who work for the University. A number of years ago there was an effort to address the issue of the salaries of staff. It is worth revisiting the issue -the cost of living is not stagnant -while broadening the scope of concern to include all workers that serve Notre Dame, including those who do so when the University sub-con­tracts the work. Appeals simply to market value or prevailing wages in the South Bend area are not adequate guidelines. 


A full assessment will require looking at the salaries of faculty and administrators as well because Catholic teaching is con­cerned not only with the living wage, but also with the gap between rich and poor. Here is one of the more difficult areas to assess because detailed information is dif­ficult and sometimes impossible to obtain. Having such information, however, would help nuance the conversation consider­ably. Salaries, even for professors of the same rank, vary according to whether the professor works in the College of Business, for instance, or in Arts and Letters. 
The greatest tension may be between the University's legitimate desire to improve as a research institution and the payment of a living wage to staff and other workers. Bringing top scholars to Notre Dame requires the payment of competitive salaries and, particularly in the sciences, the provision of highly expensive lab or other research resources. This may not be a zero-sum game in every case. Good research in some instances may bring in both founda­tion and donor funds to compensate the 
cost. The tension needs to be acknowl­
edged, however, and assessed as part of 
the question of the Catholic identil.y of the 
University. 
There are other areas of expenditure 
that also require assessment in light of 
the issue of the payment of fair wages. In 
reference to the Church, John Paul II has 
pointed to the problem of "costly furnish­
ings" and commented that "it could be 
obligatory to sell these goods" in order to 
provide adequately for all people. Last 
Friday's South Bend Tribune reported 
that Notre Dame's administration build­
ing has the number-one-ranked bath­
rooms in the country according to a 
national poll. The bathrooms have Stovax 
Victorian tile, solid oak interior partition 
doors on marble finished partitions and 
designer-accented faucets. 
Here, too, there are complex trade-off 
questions. The bathrooms are ranked in 
part in light of their upkeep -the effort 
of workers. The argument is often made 
that the overall production of wealth, 
which in this case led to the donations 
which made refurbishing the bathrooms 
possible, also makes possible the job to 
clean the bathrooms, a job that otherwise 
would not exist. The argument is that the 
desire for costly furnishings benefits even 
the least well-off among us. 
It is important to evaluate such argu­
ments rather than dismiss them out of 
hand. When a number of neo-liberal 
economists joined to make a statement · regarding sweatshops, the most that they 
could say in good conscience was that 
when the corporations subcontracted, which is usually the case in the apparel industry, the workers were "generally paid no lesli than the prevailing market wage." Notre Dame needs to attend in an ongoing way to the relationship between prevailing and living wages in the South Bend area and seek to pay the latter. 

I have two recommendations. First, in its long-range planning Notre Dame should highlight the payment of living wages to all workers associated with the University in the same way that it high­lights, for instance, the number of new faculty lines it sets as a development goal. The University can seek to develop a spe­cial endowment for the supplemental pay­ment of workers of subcontracted compa­rlies that do not pay a living wage. Second, attention to living wages is sus­tained best when workers have the right to organize. 
Given the attention to the right to orga­nize as a key for facilitating worker digni­ty in Catholic teaching, Notre Dame should not simply allow workers to exer­cise the right but encourage its practice by hosting information meetings on the history and practice of worker organiza­tion for all of its employees.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Noting flawed reasoning 
Most, if not all, of the articles criticizing the new alcohol policy seem to share this argument: Students are going to get drunk no matter what the administration does, so the administration should stop trying to curb this behavior and should in fact facili­tate it. Perhaps this argument is valid when dealing with children, who merely throw tantrums when their wishes are frustrated and only with difficulty learn to adjust their actions to a changed reality, but I should hope college students are different. 
Then there follows the reasoning that by forcing students to go elsewhere to drink liquor straight, the administration is putting those students in danger. Apparently, in many minds the hands of Father Poorman and those who "pull the golden strings" above him are already drip­ping with the blood of poor alcoholic stu­dents who will now have to suffer the agony of venturing off-campus to engage in immoral, and in many cases illegal. behav­ior. These students subsequently may be injured in car wrecks or by drunkenly stumbling into open vats of acid or piles of broken glass. 
This is peculiar logic, even by freshman standards. So it seems the administration should not forbid anything, unless it is something nobody wants to do anyway. 
Pornography? Guys are going to look at it. plain and simple. Might as well just pro­vide it for them so they can defile them selves in the donns instead of making them go to fine establishments like "The Torch" [a local strip club] to stoke their lust and even do their shameful deeds. 
Abortion? Women (even good Notre Dame girls) will get them, no matter what anyone says. After all, it is their right. Might as well put a clinic on campus so pregnant students do not have to go off­campus to get them. 
There are plenty of other silly themes running through the prevailing angry opin­ions. For instance, take the appeal to "tra­dition." On the one hand, it is pleasant to see "progressive" people for whom tradi­tion is usually a four-letter word (an all­male campus and manual labor were also once traditions) invoke it in this case like it were synonymous with the will of God. Likewise, students vigorously championing traditions of which they themselves have been a part for a few years at most makes me wonder if they somehow experienced those traditions in a previous life. As for questioning the authority of the administra­tion to make and enforce this decision. it is beyond ridiculous. 
So far as I am aware, the administration has not said it will enforce underage drink­ing laws on campus. Nor has it said it will punish intoxication in those who are 21 or over. They could have, and perhaps should have, come up with something tougher than what they did, given the rampant abuse of alcohol among students. But the way stu­dents are wailing and gnashing their teeth, you would think it could not possibly get any worse. and that is a shame.

Two TICKETS FOR "E.T.: THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL" 
'E.T.' still has a home in cinema 
This week l\lel and Paul got reacquaint­ed with "E.T. " one of the mouie world's most repulsively cuddly aliens, whose story makes you glad to have Broadwing. 
MR: It feels a little odd to review "E.T." since everyone's already seen it. 
PC: Not everyone, because before this weekend, all l knew of the leathery little alien was his film's resonant tag lines, goose -pi nipling musical score and a bike flying across the moon. 
MR: Alright then, for those who need to refresh their memories, or for others, like Paul, who were busy reading Hemingway during their childhood and never saw "E.T.," here's the short-short version: A Reese's Pieces loving extra-ter­restrial is accidentally left behind on earth when scary, dangly keys-wearing, govern­ment agents scare his family away. He befriends a young boy named Elliot, who is going through a difficult time followin~ ~ parents' divorce. The two form a S):Ilb10tic relationship while trying to reumte E.T. with his family. Its mixture of comedy and drama is timeless; you'll still laugh when 
E.T. gets drunk (it's OK because it wasn't hard alcohol) and cry when the pair must say goodbye. 
PC: All that was great, but I got more choked up believing in the purity of a world in which Drew Barrymore has no tattoos. I mean, wow, what a concept. 
MR: While it is hard to imagine little Gertie as the future star of the Skinemax classic "Poison Ivy," it's interesting that your biggest take-away from this classic film was Drew's virgin skin. Nevertheless, it does highlight the fact that the three child actors in this film, especially Henry Thomas as Elliot, are phenomenal. They set a standard rarely met by young actors since. 
PC: That's because Ray Liotta didn't start making movies until he was an adult -but I digress. I went to the film denigrating Spielberg for contributing to the money-grubbing practice of re-releasing and thinking 20-year anniversaries seem better occasions for high school reunions.

newcomers to 
the film. In this case, I question Spielberg's motivation for putting time and effort into technically enhancing small details of a movie driven by simplicity. The film engages entire audi­ences, not just children, by bringing unbe­lievable circumstances into a realistic world and then resolving the differences. That fancy computing now exists to make 
E.T. more demonstrative is irrelevant. 
MR: You're right, for all its enhance­ments, the joy of the movie still emanates from the original footage. I could have done without all the added bonuses and just enjoyed the excitement of seeing_ the movie on the big screen for the first t1111e, but I don't blame Spielberg. He's not doing it for the money -he doesn't need it. Plus, he already has a full plate of projects stacking up. I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt and believing that he really wanted to go back and improve his early masterpiece. 
PC: Then I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt on any mistakes or miscues in the first version, which I'm sure was pro­duced as well as Spielberg could produce it at the time. Do we want to keep giving filmmakers the leeway of a revisionist pro­duction clause on all of their works? Film is shot to freeze life, as Robert Redford said just recently at the Oscars. If anyone'_s going to freeze and u_nfreeze fr~mcs, 1t should be Zack Morns. Otherwise, the grasp that movies have over time is an artistic quality that audiences concede to the medium and one that I don't need betrayed by directors retroactively chec~­ing over things. "E.T." belongs to a certain epoch in both movie history· and the cre­ative evolution of Steven Spielberg. You can't consider the artist as a young man if he can go back and remove the charming fingerprints of his learning curve. 

MR: I don't think he's trying to correct the mistakes as much as strengthen the charms. And with or without the changes, the film stands on its own as arguably the best children's movie of all time -the non-animated one, for sure. Some might criticize the film for its exaggeration of authority figures; the scientists look like an army of evil spacemen and an entire police force is devoted to chasing some teenagers on bicycles. but their extremism clearly portrays how the frightened children per­ceive them. It's reminiscent of "The Christmas Story," where Ralph imagines Santa as a nasty brute. Both films rely on a youthful perspective to enrich their story. 
PC: Only "E.T." is not a just a great chil­dren's movie, it's simply a great movie. I say this because I enjoyed it, for the first time, 16 years after I was supposed to. The re-release ironically comes in the same year in which the inaugural Oscar for Best Animated Feature seemingly creates a new template for ambitious child~en's filnun~k­ing, but gets by with classic stor_ytellmg rather than glamorous effects. I like that 
E.T. comes off looking a bit like a puppet, the same way that I like the diminutive cartoonish nature of Little Mac fighting a gargantuan Mike Tyson on Nintendo's "Mike Tyson's Punch-out." Flashy digitiza­tion does not a great movie make and cer­tainly does not take the place of timely and poignant emotion. 
MR: For all its glory, though, I wonder if parents ever complained that the children set a bad example. They smoke, get drunk and have quite the vulgar vocabulary for their age. This is a movie that added the phrase "penis-breath" to the typical eight­year-old lexicon. 
PC: Those aren't half as obnoxious as the corny product placements scattered throughout the movie. By the war "W~y ­not take a time out from readmg this review and enjoy an ice cold Coke?" 
MR: But really, that's nitpicking isn't it? As is the case in most "children's films," there is a temptation for adults to dismiss "E.T." as juvenile or perhaps one long market ploy. While the sales of action fig­ures, lunchboxes and Reese's Pieces may have skyrocketed following its release, "E.T" remains perhaps the best example of the cinema addressing an adult theme from a child's perspective. 
PC: Not that it doesn't have roots in the canon of classic imaginary tales; pursuing the wonder of childhood .while peddling across the sky echoes "Peter Pan," while the spaceman motifs (and Elliot's platoon of Star Wars action figures) is Spielberg's shout-out to his buddy George Lucas. Hiding the faces of the authority figures hinted at the teacher from Charlie Brown. The narrative Spielberg ultimately creates is like a Dutch door: It opens through two portions but is not fully accessible until both its halves align at the film's end. Who says this director has "zero charisma"? 
MR: Only a real "cinus supremis."

Martin Havlat scored two goals and had an assist and Patrick Lalime stopped 27 shots as the Ottawa Senators won for the first time in five games as they beat the New York Islanders. Marian Hossa and Benoit Brunet also scored for Ottawa, while Radek Bonk added a pair of assists. 
The Senators moved to within two points of fourth-place Toronto in the Eastern Conference. 
New York got its only goal from Mariusz Czerkawski. The loss snapped a three-game win­ning streak. Garth Snow, who made 31 saves in his first start at home since Jan. 24, missed picking up his 100th NHL career victory. 
It only took 17 seconds for Ottawa to grab the lead. Hossa stripped the puck from Islander forward Shawn Bates at New York's blue line, moved left, waited for Snow to commit, and then flicked in a wide-angle wrist shot. 
The Islanders capitalized on a two-man advantage to tie the game at 4:55 when Czerkawski, parked down low, tipped Alexei Yashin's one-timer past Lalime for his 20th goal this season. 
Ottawa went back out in front at 4:20 of the second period

when Snow twice put clearing pokes on Senator sticks. He stopped Radek Bonk, but he couldn't do anything to stop Brunet, who took the puck on his backhand, switched to his forehand and nudged it into the net. 
Havlat gave the Senators some breathing room 82 sec­onds into the final period when he broke in alone on Snow and snapped a shot between the goalie's pads. He added a power-play goal at 12:38 when he stole the puck from defense­man Kenny Jonsson behind the Islander net, moved up and quickly beat Snow with a back­hand between the pads. 
WIid 4, Thrashers 2 
Andrew Brunette made a tri­umphant return to Atlanta with a goal and an assist as the Minnesota Wild defeated the Thrashers. 
The Thrashers let Brunette go as a free agent last summer after he scored 38 goals in the team's first two seasons. In his first game back to Philips Arena, Brunette set up the first goal with a perfect cross-ice pass and scored the game-win­ner after a crafty move on goalie Frederic Cassivi. 
Brunette, serving as Minnesota's rotating captain for March, has a 10-game points streak [5 goals, 12 assists]. 
The win was the second straight for Minnesota, and the fourth straight for goalie Dwayne Roloson. Atlanta, last in the NHL with 50 points, had a modest two-game winning streak end and has yet to win three in row all season.

Holy Week 101 
¦ by Fr. Bill Wack, c.s.c. Director, Freshman Retreat Program 
Today we begin our holiest season of the entire church year, the Easter Triduum. Everything we do for the rest of che year find their origin in the liturgies of rhe next three days. In truth, it's all one liturgy, broken up in to three "parts": 
1) Holy Thursday "The Mass ofthe Lord's Supper." We start the great liturgy by commemorating Jesus' Last Supper with rhe apostles in the Upper Room the night before he died for us. The Eucha­rist, which was instituted at that time, takes on an even more awesome significance. We also recog­nize in this meal that service is to be the mark of the true Christian. We remember that, in the midst ofthe supper, Jesus washed the feec ofhis disciples and gave them the charge to do likewise. As we re­
enact that action in our churches today, it still serves as a powerful reminder of how our faith should be lived.
It's not as though we are just watching 
0 

these events unfold or are celebrating 
2) Good Friday "Passion of Jesus Christ." This service starts rather abruptly 
something that happened two 
(in fact, it is a continuation ofThursday's
millennia ago. We are active 
liturgy), with the presider entering in si­participants, for when we celebrate lence and prostrating himself before the al­tar as a sign of humility. The next major
these things in the liturgy they become 
element is the reading ofthe Passion ofJesus present to us and we to them. It is Christ according to the Gospel of John. Jesus is shown to us as one who is trium­
though we are being transported back 
phant in the face of suffering and death. Then we pray for the needs of all the world (as we do every
into the Upper Room, the foot of the 
Sunday). And finally, all Christians are invited to 
cross, and the entrance of the tomb. 
venerate the cross ofChrist, pledging out lives anew to "take up our crosses" and follow the Lord. 
We are really there. 
3) Easter Vigil. The whole Church gathers in 
darkness around a "new fire". A large candle is lie from chat fire and the light is shared with all. An ancient hymn, the "Exultet" is then sung, which tells of God's power over darkness and sin. The Liturgy of the Word is expanded on this night, giving a wonderful sense of the divine work over time. Then, those who have been preparing, through prayer and study, are baptized in the midst of the assembly, and others join in fuH Communion with the Church. The night is marked with lots of ''Alleluias" and lights and signing and symbolism. If you have never experienced chis incredible celebration, you are certainly missing out. 
Herein we celebrate all that the Lord has done for us. He has given us a perfect model of servtec and humility, even to the giving ofhis life on a cross. He left us an everlasting memorial in the Eucharist. And he gives us new life in Baptism here on earth, and in the Resurrection to everlasting life. 
I would urge you to celebrate these liturgies with your family or with our community at Notre Dame. If you are here for Easter Break, why not join us for these awesome liturgies at the Basilica or in the Church of Loretto at St. Mary's? We hate to boast (no we don't!) but Holy Week services here are something to behold. And they would be even better if you were to join us. 
We shouldn't be mere spectators or bystanders in these liturgies. It's not as though we are just watching these events unfold or are celebrating something that happened two millennia ago. We are active participants, for when we celebrate these things in the liturgy they become present to us and we to them. It is though we are being transported back into the Upper Room, the foot ofthe cross, and the entrance of the tomb. We are really there. 
Thar's what the Real Presence is all about. Every rime we celebrate che Eucharist or another sacrament, we believe that Christ is really and truly present to us. It's not rhar we believe we are "re-crucifying" Christ. That would be absolutely horrible (and impossible). But at every Mass we know that we are brought into the original event of the passion, death, and resurrection ofJesus. 
Then we are to take it co the world. We are to be the "real presence" ofChrist for others. We do that first ofall by giving over our lives in the service ofothers. We may not be called upon to die the way Jesus died, bur we are all commanded to serve the rest. As we celebrate Easter chis year, we want to become more Christ-like, affording hope and new life in the world in which we live. 
May God bless you during this holiest of times.

ROSTOCK, Germany 

G~rmany scored three goals in a 7-minute span to beat the United States 4-2 in an exhibi­tion game to prepare the teams for the World Cup. 
Clint Mathis scored both goals for the Americans, but their 
defense  could  not  hold  a  
German  team  depleted  by  
injuries.  

Mathis scored the first goal in the 17th minute, but Christian Ziege tied it in the 44th. Oliver Ncuville, Oliver Bierhoff and Torsten Frings scored in quick succession starting in the 61st minute. Mathis got his second goal in the 70th minute. 
"I thought the Germans played well. they dominated us physi­caHy,'' U.S. coach Bruce Arena said. "A couple of our guys bailed out on plays.... They moved better, they thought bet­ter, they beat us in all phases of the game." 
Germany, missing about half its likely World Cup roster because of injuries and other reasons, also lost key midfielder Michael Ballack, its top scorer in the qualifying, to a hamstring injury. 
The United States, which lost to Germany 2-0 in the 1998 World Cup, was without captain Claudio Reyna, while forward Brian McBride and midfielder John O'Brien were on the bench because of injuries.

The match in this chilly Baltic port city was played with tight security. Hundreds of police and border troops checked the crowd of about 29,000 in Ostsee. Stadium. 
Ziege beat Tottenham Hotspur teammate Kasey Keller in the American goal early on, but Jeff Agoos cleared the ball off the line. Keller then had to charge off the line twice for diving saves to deny Oliver Bierhoff and Bernd Schneider. 
Just as the Germans appeared to begin dominating, the Americans scored when Jovan Kirovski shook off Frank Baumann on the left side a slipped a pass to Mathis, who was unchallenged, His first effort bounced off the post and he tapped in the rebound past goalkeeper Frank Rost. 
In the 24th. Mathis should have made it 2-0 but he drove the ball over the bar from six yards out. Ziege then tied it with a curling free kick over the defensive wall, a shot that went in ofI Keller's fingertips. 
Neuville scored the go-ahead goal on a header. and Bierhoff got his 33rd international goal in 61 appearances off a pass from Schneider after Agoos failed to clear the ball. 
Frings scored off a pass from Joerg Boehme. After Mathis' goal, U.S. coach Bruce Arena reshuffled his shaky defense, sending in Gregg Berhalter and Tony Sanneh for Agoos and Steve Cherundolo.

Tyson-Lewis fight set 
Associated Press 
MEMPHIS, Tenn. 

Memphis wanted the atten­tion. and Mike Tyson needed a place to fight. It took awhile, but the match was finally made. 
Memphis ended up the win­ner in the bid to land Tyson's fight with heavyweight cham­pion Lennox Lewis, getting a fight that Nevada rejected and several other states found objectionable. 
One of the biggest fights in years was salvaged when pro­moters agreed for Tyson and Lewis to meet for the heavy­weight title. It's not Las Vegas, but for Memphis it will be the big time. 
"It certainly will boost the tourism awareness for that city," said John Wade, Tennessee's tourism commis­sioner. 
A fight that could make more than $100 million -and pay each fighter more than $20 million -is now sched­uled to take place at the 20,000-seat Pyramid arena, where ringside seats will fetch $2,500. 
And, unlike the New York press conference that caused the fight to be run out of Las Vegas when Tyson threw a punch and then a tantrum, the fighters will not get together for any prefight publicity this time around. 
"We're not having any more press conferences with the two of them together," Tyson adviser Shelly Finkel said. 
Weeks of trying to keep the fight alive culminated in an agreement for Lewis to defend his IBF and WBC heavyweight titles against the once-feared former champion. 
The fight is an intriguing matchup of boxer versus puncher, though it might have lost some of its appeal as the two boxers argued for years over whether they should meet, and Tyson has been largely inactive. 
"We now have close to 11 weeks before the fight and I believe everything is fine," Finkel said. "Mike is ready to fight." 
The fight that was rejected 
 I by Nevada boxing officials after Tyson misbehaved at a
'I 
I January press conference 
. ended up in Memphis after a road show in which it was 
shopped to various cities around the country. 
In some cities -including Washington, D.C., and Detroit -it was welcomed. In others, politicians gave Tyson a chilly reception and suggested pro­moters look elsewhere. 
Memphis landed it with promises of a $12.5 million site fee -not to mention a willingness to overlook Tyson antics that included a brawl and outburst at the January news conference first announcing the fight. 
In return, the city hopes to gain a reputation as a major player in sports. 
Those close to the negotia­tions said Memphis promoters still had not come up with the $12.5 million letter of credit and may not be involved with the fight. The money obstacle reportedly was overcome when Tyson's camp agreed to take its money only after the Lewis camp was paid. 
The much-shopped bout was in jeopardy as late as Friday when local promoters couldn't come up with the site fee after a bank refused to issue a letter of credit because of "moral issues." 
. Production representatives of the HBO and Showtime net­works were in Memphis to tour the Pyramid arena in advance of the pay-per-view telecast. 
The fight originally was going to be April 6 in Las Vegas, but Nevada boxing authorities refused to give Tyson a boxing license after an outburst at a January press conference. 
Finkel said the delay will help sell the fight because con­siderable publicity has been generated while the fight was being shopped around and negotiated.

Tyson and Lewis each are reportedly guaranteed $17.5 million to fight for the lBF and WBC titles Lewis holds, and could earn millions more if the tight grabs the attention of the public. 
Promoters also stand to make a bundle. with projec­tions that the fight could gross $100 million from the site fee and pay-per-view sales. 
The fight not only had to be made Monday to meet the IBF deadline, but it was also facing other deadlines. Cable opera­tors needed to keep the date open, and organizers generally need at least two months to properly promote the fight.

Carter was in Miami bank­ruptcy court for a meeting with creditors this week. He filed for Chapter 7 bankrupt­cy on Feb. 15, listing his debts to more than 20 credi­tors as $4. 9 million. his assets as more than $1 mil­lion. 
Carter, who missed 18 months of football the past two seasons because of drug suspensions, and his attorney met with representatives of two of the creditors -the Denver Broncos and the NFL Management Association, which was there on behalf of the NFL team -and James Fierberg, a lawyer with Berger and Singerman of Miami. 
Fierberg is representing the court-appointed trustee in the case, Corali Lopez-Castro, whose job is to liquidate Carter's property and distrib­ute it to his creditors. 
"[Carter] was there to answer some very specific questions concerning his 
assets," Fierberg said. "There are a lot of questions left to answer. I asked him to pro­duce a lot of documents, and he deferred to his agent, so I'll have to talk to his agent." 
Kevin Gleason, Carter's attorney, and Mitch Frankel, his agent, could not be reached for comment. 
Saints general manager Randy Mueller said the issue was a private matter that doesn't affect Carter's rela­tionship with the Saints. 
Carter signed a four-year, $22.8 million contract with lhe Broncos in 1999 that included a $7.8 million sign­ing bonus. He played the 1999 season and received $1.835 million in salary and bonus. He was suspended by the NFL for the 2000 season and signed last year at mid­season with the Minnesota Vikings. earning $267,000. 
Tbe Broncos contend Carter owes them $4 million in back bonus money because he played just one season. Among the other creditors are the Internal Revenue Service; a Georgia travel agency, which is owed $15,000 by Carter's manage­ment agency, Impact Sports; and Miami lawyer Susan Van Dusen, who says Carter owes her $2,000 for legal advice. IRS spokesman Mike Dobzinski would not disclose how much the government agency is owed or how far back the debt goes. 
It's possible that Carter will have to pay only the IRS.

Cubs land closer in deal 
. Alfonseca had 28 saves, 3.06 ERA last season 
Associated Press 
MELBOURNE. Fla. 
The Chicago Cubs got a much-needed closer in Antonio Alfonseca. The Florida Marlins got some much-wanted payroll flexibility. 
The Cubs, desperate for a relief ace since Tom Gordon was injured, acquired Alfonseca and pitcher Matt Clement from the Marlins in a six-player trade. 
Florida got pitcher Julian Tavarez and three minor lea­guers -pitchers Jose Cueto and Dontrellc Willis and catch­er Ryan Jorgensen. 
Alfonseca, who will make $3.55 million this season, led the majors with 45 saves in 2000. He had 28 saves and a career-best 3.06 ERA last sea­son despite pitching with back pain much of the season. 
"Alfonseca is a proven guy in the ninth inning," said Jim Hendry, the Cubs' vice presi­dent of player personnel. "It's just a chance to add a quality person late in the game." 
While Alfonseca left camp without extensive comment "I've got nothing to say," ­Clement cleaned out his locker, then aired out his feelings about the Marlins. 
The trade made little sense to Clement, and it may have sig­naled the start of another pay­roll purge for the floundering Marlins. 
The team says it needs a new ballpark to increase revenue Is it happening again? and be able to keep the young "This was something we did and talented team intact. New on the baseball side. I would let owner Jeffrey Loria says he is you editorialize that as you committed to making baseball want," Beinfest said.

"It doesn't take me to spell it out. It looks to me like it's a matter of time before the rest of the boys start going right along with me." 
Marlins general manager Larry Beinfest refused to dis­cuss the payroll move. other than to say it gave the team flexibility for the future. 
Of course, this is the same franchise that won the 1997 World Series, then dismantled the talent-laden lineup by unloading Al Leiter, Kevin Brown, Robb Nen, Livan Hernandez, Moises Alou, Gary Sheffield, Charles Johnson, Edgar Renteria and others.

Chicago tried to lure Jeff Shaw out of retirement, but couldn't come to an agreement. Splitting closer duties between Jeff Fassero and the hard­throwing Kyle Farnsworth was another option, but Farnsworth is just 3-of-9 in career save sit­uations. 
Alfonseca had surgery in October to repair a bulging disc in his back, but Hendry said there don't appear to be any lingering effects from it. The

singles by the score of 6-3, 6-1 
to close the gap to 2-1. 
The score was then evened at two apiece when the Hlini's Tiffany Elkov prevailed over the Irish's Nina Vaughan 6-4, 7-5. 
Fortunately for the Irish, Salas continued her trend of earning important wins this season, downing Illinois' Kate Boomershine in a 6-3, 7-6 (8-6) nail-biter. 
With a 3-2 lead, junior Katie Cunha made sure it didn't get any closer than that, topping Cynthia Goulet for a 6-4, 6-4 win and the clinching point in the match. 
"Katie didn't play as well as she could have today. but she stuck with it," said Louderback. "She made the other girl return a lot of balls and eventually she gutted it out for us." 
With one tough win behind them, the Irish can now set their sights on the difficult road ahead. The team will spend its Easter break in North Carolina playing matches against tough squads from Duke, Wake Forest and North Carolina. 
All three schools are ranked in the top 10 and Louderback is excited about the prospect of playing higher-level competi­tion. 
"As for as I'm concerned, there aren't any great teams in the country just a lot of really good teams," he said. ·1 think we can play with all of these teams and maybe cause an upset or two of our own." 
One motivating factor for the Irish may be the hope of redemption. Earlier in the sea­son, the Irish dropped an embarrassing 6-1 match to North Carolina at the National 
Indoor  Championships  in  
Madison, Wis.  
With the Tar Heels third  on  

the team's menu this weekend, the Irish should be well pre­pared for a rematch. 
"We've been looking forward to playing them," said Louderback. "I think it will be a good chance to prove ourselves, and the fact that they are ranked so far ahead of us might take a little bit of the pressure off."

Belles battle MIAA opponent Comets 
. Saint Mary's returns to court after week off 
By KATIE McVOY 
Associate Sports Editor 
The Saint Mary's tennis team should have a smooth transition back into competi­tion after a week-long break. The Belles will face the Olivet Comets Monday after taking a week off from MIAA play. 
The eighth-place Comets, who lost 9-0 to the Belles in their last face off, should pre­sent no physical challenge to the Belles. However, Saint Mary's will have to stay focused on its mental game to play up to potential. 
"Sometimes schools like that are the hardest to beat," said sophomore Kaitlin Cutler. "The players aren't as strong and you sink to their level and lose your focus. You have to go in with the same focus." 
Saint Mary's hasn't played a match since the team's 7-2 victory against Albion on Saturday. Albion, who was ranked second in the MIAA, proved to be tough competi­tion for the Belles despite the

score. The difficult win over Albion, followed by Monday's less-difficult match against Olivet, should get Saint Mary's ready for the rest of the sea­son. 
"I think it helps sometimes but I feel like the season is going to be the tough competi­tion will be equal -a tough match and an easier match," Cutler said. "We haven't played since Saturday so it will be nice to have a not real tough one." 
Despite the fact that this match should not present the Belles with problems they can't handle, they do have 

goals they hope to reach. As they head into their second game of the season as defend­ing MIAA Champions, another shut-out victory would help team morale. 
"Probably just to win 9-0 and to get as much out of it as we can," Cutler said. "We haven't played outside in a while so [we're] getting used to the wind. After this we kind of start all of our matches so it will be good to play outside and try to stay focused." 
Olivet is returning six play­ers from last season and the Belles will be starting all but one of the women that faced off against the Comets last season. However, after Natalie Cook graduated from No. 2 singles, the Saint Mary's ten­nis players have all switched positions and will be facing the same women, but at differ­ent positions. 
Saint Mary will have four days off from practice to go home for the Easter holiday before returning on Monday. 
The match will begin at 3 

p.m. Monday at Olivet.

believed what they said, though, is in doubt. 
"I think we all thought that we were a lot better than they were," said Tahorga. "To be honest with you, I thought that we were tough enough that if we were playing bad we could win the match. Apparently, that wasn't so. I think that every­one's really disappointed." 
Bayliss stopped short of say­ing the Irish were too compla­cent, but warned of the dangers of any smugness resulting from high rankings or past perfor­mances 
"I can't read what's in other people's minds. I think some of our guys were surprised. I wasn't shocked," Bayliss said. "I think you always have to guard against [complacency]. 
"I do think some of the guys have gotten wrapped up in [the rankings]. It's difficult not to become too outcome-oriented. If you become that way, I think it sets you up for a fall."

"We've always had great games with West Virginia," O'Connor said. "It's always seemed whether it's been at Notre Dame or West Virginia that it's been a great game. They usually come down to the end of the game, and it's often a one or two run game." 
Last season, the Irish swept the doubleheader at home from the Mountaineers 4-1 and 8-1, but those victories came largely on the efforts of two complete game perfor­mances from pitchers Aaron Heilman and Danny Tamayo, who have since graduated. 
On Saturday, the Irish square off against Georgetown, who has had a much rougher time this sea­son than either Notre Dame or West Virginia. The Hoyas began the season 0-7, and · since then have moved on to a 7-21 record while going 1-2 in their first three conference games. 
Irish pitchers should be more experienced against this Georgetown squad as starters J.P. Gagne and Drew Duff pitched 12 out of 16 pos­sible innings in Notre Dame's two victories last season over a Georgetown team that went 17-39. overall, the Irish hold a 16-2 advantage in competi­tion against the Hoyas. 
These four games are the last of 22 consecutive away games for the Irish to start the season. The Irish hope to do well in these last road games before returning to South Bend for an 11-game home stand beginning with BYU Monday. 
"These are big games. Every game is big," O'Connor said. "But we're going on the road, and we have four con­ference games on the road. We need to decide what it takes for us to win and get the job done."

both he and bis squad arc seri­ously concerned about Wednesday's performance, as well as with their recent dou­bles play. 
"Some days you're the dog and some days you're the fire hydrant," Irish coach Bob Bayliss said. "Today we were the fire hydrant." 
Concerned may not be a strong enough adjective for the players, though. The Irish are angry. 
"We know that we arc ranked really high and that it took a lot of effort from many people to 
get where we are and just to blow it out in one match is dis­appointing," senior Javier Taborga said. 
Michigan may have been ranked 46th, but before arriv­

"We prepared for it. We said all the right things," Bayliss said.

The No. 23 Notre Dame women's tennis team thought they needed a close match against tough competition to prepare them for the stretch run of the spring season. On Wednesday, they got their wish by earning a tough 4-3 decision over No. 65 lllinois. 
The win improves the Irish to 11-7 on the season, while Illinois drops to 7-11. 
'Tm proud of the way we fought in this one," said Irish head coach Jay Louderback. "The key for us was winning the doubles point. It made a big difference getting out to that 1­0 lead." 
The Irish jumped out to a quick advantage on the doubles side when Sarah Jane Connelly 
and Alicia Salas topped the 
Illini's Michelle Webb and 
Eldina Fazlic 8-3. The win gave 
the tandem their 10th doubles 
victory in 11 tries this season. 
Moments later, the 30th-ranked 
team of Becky Varnum and 
Lindsey Green wrapped up the 
point with an 8-3 victory of 
their own. 

Once singles action began, 
Green wasted no time disposing 
of the IIJini's Eva Choe at the 
No. 3 spot, winning handily 6-1, 
6-0. 

"Linsdey's quick victory was 
really important because it 
gave us a 2-0 lead and that 
really helped our confidence," 
said Louderback.

After a disappointing 0-3 weekend to kick off the Big East season, the Irish base­ball team hopes to rebound with a pair of conference doubleheaders on the road at West Virginia and Georgetown over Easter Break. 
For only the second time since joining the Big East Conference in baseball, the Irish were swept in a three­game series last weekend. At Connecticut, the Irish suf­fered some defensive trou­bles and the inability to come up with big hits in the clutch 
Over the weekend, the Irish committed seven errors and stranded 31 base run­ners. The team hopes to improve these numbers if it is to return to the success that it enjoyed last season in winning the Big East regular season title. 

"The biggest thing we have to work on as a: team is sewing up our infield defense and hitting in the clutch," Brian O'Connor, associate head coach, said. 
The bats have been alive for the Irish as they out hit the Huskies 32 to 26, but the team was still outscored by nine runs in the series. With three players -seniors Steve Stanley, Andrew Bushey, and Brian Stavisky -hitting .400 or better, the Irish hold a respectable team batting average of .286. The m ajar gap appears in the team's 4.12 earned run average and .284 opponents' batting average compared to last year's low marks of 3.22 for ERA and .246 for OBA. 
The Irish return to confer­ence play Thursday at West Virginia, slightly earlier than the usual Saturday/Sunday three-game series, but O'Connor feels that the soon­er the team can return to the field the better. 
''I'm glad we're playing again on Thursday, and that we don't have to wait until Saturday because we need to get right back out there and start playing again," O'Connor said. "We need to go out there and win those games and have a chance to get right back into playing our best." 
The Irish can expect a tough match up Thursday against West Virginia, as the Mountaineers bring another experienced squad that returns eight starters from last season. So far this year. West Virginia has gone 10-8, winning two of its first three Big East games last weekend against Georgetown.
