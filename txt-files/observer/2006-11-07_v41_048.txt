A Student Senate resolution calling for Notre Dame Food Services to serve only Fair Trade coffee will probably not be real­ized this year, Senate Social Concerns committee chair Sheena Plamoottil said Monday. 
Plamoottil and student body president Uzzi Shappell met with Director of Food Services David Prentkowski la'!t week to discuss the feasibility of a Senate resolu­tion that calls for all non-fran­chised Notre Dame Food Services locations to serve only Fair Trade coffee. At that meeting, Plamoottil sensed that "it's not feasible" for Food Services to pursue such a far-reaching initia­tive. 
"I don't think [only serving Fair Trade coffee is] going to happen this year.... [Food Services] made us aware of several initia­tives that they had already begun before [the resolution] had come to the table," Plamoottil said. 
Fair Trade pricing en'lures that farmers are paid $1.26 per pound of coffee beans, which is enough to support a family, according to an Oct. 5 Observer article. Fair Trade coffee elimi­nates the middle men -like millers, exporters and importers -and allows farmers to sell their beans directly to the roast­er. 
Prentkowski said in an e-mail Monday that Food Services has already established a committee to address social responsibility issues. The Food Service Social Responsibility Committee's mis­sion i'i "to continuously evaluate and monitor the industry and to recommend and advise the department regarding actions and practices related to social responsibility issues." 
The committee is specifically addressing coffee from the per­spective of social accountability, Prentkowski said, explaining that there are many methods of assuring a socially responsible

INSIDE COLUMN 
Absent 


absentee ballot 

Yesterday, I received a letter from Linda Stender, a Congressional can­didate from New Jersey, thanking me for requesting an absentee bal­lot for this year's general election. 
Well, here it is: Election Jen Metz Day. 

And, sadly, my absentee News Wzre Editor 
ballot is ... absent. 

The county clerk system of, what I have consid­ered until this moment the best state in the union, has failed me. I requested my ballot about a month ago, and they did not deliver. I will not be able to vote for Stender, or "Stender the Spender," according to the opposing campaign's advertise­ments, today. 
Granted, I haven't been following the New Jersey races as closely as I should have. 
I don't quite know what Congressman Mike Ferguson's peo­ple are accusing Stender of spend­ing. The pamphlet that came with her letter tells me she will stand up to the Bush Administration. 
So, I think that means Ferguson likes Bush. Do I like Bush? 
I'm not the most politically-mind­ed individual. Living out here in Indiana has very much removed me from the extremely accusatory and most likely untrue campaign com­mercials that interrupt more impor­tant things. Like the already too short episodes of The Office or my afternoon relaxation sessions spent cooking with the Barefoot Contessa. 
Yet, I still feel like I'm missing out on something important. 
I know voting is one of the essen­tial rights that most Americans often take for granted. 
But that's really not what's both­ering me. I feel as if I'm letting people down. Stender's secretary's computer addressed that letter to me personally. 
Actually, after reading it again, I realize I wouldn't have voted for her anyway. But now poor Ferguson, who isn't accused of doing anything that rhymes with his name, won't get my vote. 
I'm not trying to turn this into the lecture about how a single vote can make a difference, but what if mine would have? 
Now that this right, that's only been mine for a short eight months, is being denied due to an ineffectu­al filing system or too slow mail, I can't help but question why some of the millions of Americans who have the power to vote don't. 
I know the elections are being pushed on us from all directionns -on T.V., on posters, even on Facebook-but I think you should rock it today and share your opin­ions, even if they're as indifferent as mine, just because you can.

BOARD OF GOVERNANCE 
Dining Hall will stay open longer 
By LIZ HARTER News Writer 
In response to athletes' com­plaints about the Noble Family Dining Hall's 7 p.m. closing time, Saint Mary's Board of Governance (BOG) announced Monday that the dining hall has extend its dinner hours by 30 minutes. 
"Starting tonight the dining hall will be open until 7:30 p.m. [Monday through Thursday]," said student services commissioner Kelly Maus. 
Though the posted hours for din­ner were 4:30 to 7 p.m., some of the food stations had stopped serving food before 7 p.m. and would often take the food away. That left ath­letes, who didn't arrive at the dining hall until 6:45, with limited food options. 
Now, there will be one food sta­tion open after 7 p.m. and that sta­tion will rotate throughout the week. In addition, the salad bar, the deli bar and the cereal station will be open for the extra half-hour. 
"Barry [Bowles, head of campus food service provider Sodexho] talked with [College athletic direc­tor] Lynn Kachmarik about athletes' concerns on [dining halJ] closing time," Maus said. 
Members also discussed the upcoming "12 Days of Christmas "event, sponsored by the senior board. 
"Last week BOG committed to providing five Christmas trees to represent the five main boards [on campus)," student body president Susan Mcllduff said. "Those trees would [be donated] to needy fami­lies." 
BOG is also working with Sodexho to create a to-go mug as a fundrais­er for the "12 Days" event. The mug could be used as a "to-go" cup in the dining halls. 
Notes: 
+College President Carol Ann Mooney will attend the Nov. 20 BOG meeting to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of Saint Mary's. 

+Health and Wellness Commissioner Heidi Goeppinger announced that the Save Kids to Save Uves campaign is "going really well." The event ends Friday, and any Yoplait yogurt lids can be turned in to the front desk of resi­dence halls until then. 
+The freshman board has reserved the Vander Vennet theater Thursday for a First-year "Grey's Anatomy" viewing. 
+The Nov. 11 bus trip to Chicago has been canceled. Instead, there will be two buses available for the Dec. 2 trip because of an expected increase in demand for spots on that date, Mdlduff said.

" said political science professor Peri Arnold. 
Mike McKenna, who coordi­nated a Notre Dame "Rock the Vote" campaign that registered about 350 voters and delivered absentee ballots to 300 more, thinks such discontent runs the political gamut. 
"So many Americans, whether Democrat, Republican, Independent or Libertarian, are unsatisfied with the current situ­ation in Iraq," he said. "And the fact is that in re-cent months, the death toll is higher than when we first went to Iraq -it's 
increasing." 
Likening an election cam­paign to a wrestling match, Arnold said Democrats and Republicans define issues in their own ways. 
"Republicans would have it that thlc:; i., a very good economy. They would like that

they can provide for the communi­ty," he said. 
But the experts concur that nega­tive advertising is a necessary evil. 
"It's negative ads that have impact and bring 
story to be the one voters pay attention to," he said. "Democrats would like to respond and say middle-class incomes haven't grown signifi­cantly, in terms of real income. 
"In some sense," he said, "you can think of it as a battle over whose definition gets more attention from voters." 
Despite the many issues ­from Iraq to the economy to immigration -American Studies professor Jack Colwell says the election comes down to Tribune. "Should Bush have a Congress that wouid support him, or a Democratic House?" 

Freshman Kristofer Trujillo is one of the voters who has that detennining power, but he's not voting this year -obtaining an Illinois absentee ballot requires in-person registration, which he didn't have the opportunity to do. There's another aspect of the election that's bothering him: the rampant negative campaigning. 
"It turns you off from trying to care about the issues when all you hear i., a person explaining why another's bad rather than formulating a plan for them­selves, and explaining. what 
about change," 
Colwell said. "That's why they're used nation­wide." 
While negative ads can occa­sionally sour voters from going to the polls at all, Arnold said, they carry information that can occasionally prove seriously detrimental to candidates like Harold Ford, Tennessee's Democratic candidate for Congress. A recent ad question­ing Ford's morals depicted an attractive white woman asking Ford to "Call me." 
"It's very nasty, but it's doing something: it's reminding voters in a southern state that this Democratic nominee is black. That works in favor of white Republicans," Arnold said. "Harold Ford had been running a very good race, what had been a very tight race. After that [ad] he's fallen about 12 points behind. I don't think it's just the ad, but it's part of the effect that's led to his falling behind." 
As Notre Dame College Republicans Vice President Josh Kempf knows, those are the ads that stick. 
On behalf of Chocola, Kempf and other College RepubJicans have been canvassing and work­ing at a phone bank where threatening posters of potential Senate Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi and motivational Bush quotes line the walls. When Chocola calls undecided voters, he asks them to recall negative ads they've seen, Kempf said. Then he asks them to recall posi­tive ones -and they seldom can, Kempf said. 
"Chocola says, 'See? That's what you notice. That's what you remember,"' Kempf said. "I don't think anybody likes them, but that's a fact." 

Helen Adeosun, Notre Dame College Democrats co-president, said the College Democrats have been active in canvassing and phoning for Donnelly's cam­paign, especially since the National College Democrats identified the 2006 election as momentous.· 
"In more than a decade, there's never been a greater sweeping change than the one that could take place [today]," she said.

His race against Chocola for a seat in the House has garnered national media attention as one of the key dis­tricts that will determine which party has control of the House. On Nov. 3, the Associated Press reported that of 400 likely voters, 50 percent said they favored Donnelly while 4 7 percent favored Chocola. 
Visclosky is a Notre Dame Law School graduate and has represented the 1st district since 1984. 
Republican candidate Mark Souder is running for his third term re-election in the 3rd dis­trict. Souder -who received his MBA from Notre Dame in 197 4 -also served as a repre­sentative of the 4th district from 1995 until 2002. 
Other Republican candidates from Notre Dame seeking re­election are Michael Ferguson, Peter King and Dan Lungren. 
Ferguson completed his undergraduate work at Notre Dame, earning his bachelor's degree in political science. He has served as the representa­tive for New Jersey's 7th dis­trict since 2000. 
King is a 1968 graduate of the Notre Dame Law School, and is a current member of the University's Law Association board of directors. He repre­sents the 3rd district of New York and is seeking to enter into his ninth term of office. 
On the opposite coast, Lungren -who graduated with honors in English in 1968 -is running for re-election in the 3rd district of California. Lungren has also formerly held the positions of Representative for California's 34th district and served as the state's Attorney General. 
All of the four former Saint Mary's students up for re-elec­tion have made history as females in their political careers. 
''I'm impressed, but not sur­prised, that four women who were educated at [Saint Mary's) are United States law­makers," said College spokes­woman Melanie McDonald. "That's what this College does so well, it educates women to develop their talents and make a difference in the world." 
Eddie Bernice Johnson received her nursing certifi­cate from the College in 1955 and is one of two nurses in the United States House of Representatives. Johnson cur­rently represents the 30th dis­trict of Texas -a position she has held since 1992 -and is the first female and first African American Representative for the Dallas area.

Italian court convicts Egyptian man 
MilAN, Italy-An Egyptian man who is one of the chief suspect<; in the 2004 Madrid train bombings was sentenced to 10 years in jail by an Italian court on Monday. 
The court in Milan convicted Rabei Osman Sayed Ahmed, 35, and a co-defendant, Yahia Ragheh, 23, of subversive association aimed at international terrorism, a charge introduced in Italy after the attack.o;; on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The younger man was sen­tenced to five years. 
Prosecutor Maurizio Romanelli had sought a 14-year sentence for Ahmed, who was accused of having ties with the terror cell that carried out the March 11, 2004 bombings on the Madrid commuter rail system that killed 191 people and of trying to indoctrinate the younger man with a radical form of Islam after arriving in Italy in December 2003. 
Romane11i identified Ragheh as a would-be suicide bomber, and demanded a seven-year sentence. 
Kyrgyz president makes concessions 
BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan -The Kyrgyz presi­dent gave in Monday to opposition demands to ftre key law enforcement officials but refused calls to resign even as thousands protested and police guarding his headquarters switched over to the demonstrators' side. 
Early Tuesday, opposition lawmakers held an extraordinary Parliament session and voted on a new draft constitution that would trim President Kurmbanbek Bakiyev's powers. But it was unclear what legal weight their move would carry since only a minority of 39 lawmakers was present. 
There was no mention of an impeachment motion, which opposition legislators had earlier said they would demand at the session.

MONTGOMERY, Ala. -A federal judge on Monday scheduled a hearing to deter­mine if jurors who convicted former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman and former HealthSouth CEO Richard Scrushy of cor­ruption improperly considered informa­tion from the Internet or other outside sources. 
U.S. District Judge Mark Fuller said in an order that he decided to call the Nov. 17 hearing based on a juror's testimony last week that members of the panel vio­lated his instructions while deliberating. 
The two defendants were convicted in June on bribery and conspiracy charges. Prosecutors said Scrushy arranged $500,000 in contributions to Siegelman's campaign for a statewide lottery in exchange for being appointed by Siegelman to a seat on an influential hos­pital regulatory board.

said the committee might estab­lish a "student essay prize" and publish the winning essay in a campus publication. 
Senior Patrick Knapp, who is a member of the committee, said he has already started to reflect on the Encyclical's practical applica­tions. 
The most interesting aspect of "God is Love," Knapp said, is its "renewed exploration of Catholic political and sodal activism." 
"It essentially says that social justice is the duty of the laity to carry out in the political sphere, but effort'> should be made in the spirit of love and charity; there can be no social justice without love," he said. 
Knapp said the Encyclical serves "as a sort of polite admon­ishment towards liberation theolo­gy, a school of thought that holds that we are called to arms, literal­ly, to fight for social justice in the name of Christ. A crusade, if you will." 
Pope Benedict presented his Encyclical on Christmas Day 2005, drawing heavily from the First Letter of John. lie cited 1 John 

4:16: "God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him." In the intro­duction to "God is Love," Pope Benedict wrote that he wished "to speak of the love which God lav­ishes upon us and which we in turn must share with others." 
Jenkins' message in the opening mass of the 2006-2007 school year echoed the challenge pre­sented in Pope Benedict's encycli­cal.

way of coffee growing and pro­cessing without needing to only serve Fair Trade coffee. 
The University has had Fair Trade coffee available at select locations on campus for more than five years. The Huddlemart, Reekers and the Jordan Hall of Science serve Fair Trade coffee exclusively, and in 2003 Fair Trade was added to several cam­pus venues like Waddick's in O'Shaughnessy Hall and the Cafe Commons in the Mendoza College of Business, among others. 
But that's not good enough for Plamoottil and Amnesty International officials -who helped draft the Senate resolution. 

"This is something we thought was very important to the student body and we wanted to help facili­tate some progress on the situa­tion," Plamoottil said. 
But Prentkowski believes advances can be made without selling Fair Trade coffee exclu­sively. He believes Food Services must strike a balance between the interests of the people it serves and its commitment to social responsibility. North and South dining halls, for example, offer Fair Trade coffee beside flavored coffees, which an~ not Fair Trade­certified. 
"The flavored coffees are extremely popular at this time," Prentkowski said, "at the same time, our procurement staff is searching for socially responsible alternatives." 
Units that do not currently offer a socially responsible alternative will do so by the start of the next semester, he said. 
Prentkowski explained that although the campus franchise operations are under University control, franchisers determine the menus and would thus not be required to make Fair Trade cof-
Jenkins asked members of the Notre Dame community to reflect on whether they will use educa­tion, which he described as the greatest power in the world, "for ourselves or for others." 
He prayed that the Holy Spirit would enable the Notre Dame community to "go forth in this academic year to discover, under­stand and express the truth, and to serve others in love -particu­larly those in greatest need." 
Jenkins announced the mem­bers of his new committee last week. They include theology pro­fessors Lawrence Sullivan, Larry Cunningham and Virgilio Elizondo, history professor John McGreevy, political science profes­sor John Roos, civil engineering and geological sciences professor Stephen Silliman, and philosophy professor Gretchen Reydams­Schilo;;. 
Also included \\ill be film, televi­sion and theater professor Susan Ohmer, Law School professor Paolo Carozza, Dean of the First Year of Studies Hugh Page, Dean of the Mendoza College of Business Carolyn Woo, Associate Vice President of Student Affairs Ann Firth, Associate Vice President of News and Information Don Wycliff, student senators Danny Smith and Pat Knapp, student body president Uzzi Shappell, student Madeleine Ryland, Director of the Center for Social Concerns Father Bill Ues, preprofessional studies professor Father James Foster, Director of Campus Ministry Father Richard Warner and Senior Executive Assistant in the Office of the President Father Jim McDonald.

fee available. 
At least 50 percent of the coffee offered through Food Services is Fair Trade-certified, and it is up to the student, Prentkowski said, to choose whether or not to pur­chase Fair Trade coffee. 
In hopes of convincing more stu­dentc;; to choose Fair Trade coffee, Amnesty International and the Student Senate are directing their efforts towards educating the Notre Dame community about the issue. 
Amnesty International had been raising awareness about the issue through a series of posters. The club has alo;;o been in contact with Catholic Relief Services and the United Students for Fair Trade in hopes of "getting involved in a broader sense and seeing if we want to have events that are mon~ publicized throughout the coun­try," said Amnesty International secretary Gary Nijak. 
Plamoottil believes changing the minds of Notre Dame students can be as simple as disseminating information. 
"I wouldn't say students are uninterested," she said, noting that students she's spoken with have been receptive of the goal" of the project. 
The problem lies in the lack of awareness, she said. 
"Not many [students] are aware of exactly what [Fair Trade] is," Plamoottil said. 
A little more money for a cup of Fair Trade coffee, Nijak said, can go a long way. 
"You have the ability to pay a few more cents," he said. "It's about making a choice to do the right thing ... that's been a huge focus of our campaign -the fact that through your simple pur­chase every single day you can make a choice to live a moral life."

PayPal offers incentives for holidays 
NEW YORK -PayPal, the payment-service company owned by online auction site eBay Inc., said Monday it will launch an incentive program. allowing customers who subscribe to the service to receive cash rebates of up to $20 on several thousand merchants' sites in North America. 
In a release, PayPal said that the cash rebate programs, valued at $100 million, will be avail­able to consumers from Nov. 23 through May 15. Free shipping promotions will be available begin­ning Nov. 23. 
Some of the merchants' sites in addition to eBay that will offer PayPal customers cash rebate offers are cooking.com, starbucks.com, walgreens.com and buy.com, according to Amanda Pires, a PayPal spokeswoman. 
In the third quarter, PayPal contributed $350 million to eBay's top line, up 41 percent from a year ago, and claimed a total of 123 million users. The payment system faces competition from · Google Inc.'s Google Checkout, an online wallet and payment system that launched in June. 
Wal-Mart price cuts hurt competitors 
NEW YORK -A simple jar of baby food might not say much about the state of the economy, except when Wal-Mart is involved. 
The world's biggest retailer has slashed in half its price for some of its Gerber baby food, a bold move that no doubt is being welcomed by many parents with toddlers. It's also symp­tomatic of what's shaping up as a bruising brawl likely to break out among retailers nationwide as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. tries to re­ignite sales growth at its stores. 
In a roundabout way, Wal-Marts woes also could turn out to be good news for the econo­my. As it aggressively cuts prices and rivals are forced to follow, inflationary pressures could weaken. 
That could be a welcome sign to the Federal Reserve. Its policymakers raised interest rates 17 times over the last two years, attempting to control inflation by slowing the economy. They left rates unchanged at the last three meet­ings, hoping they'd done ('nough. 
With oil and gasoline prices sharply retreat­ing in recent months, a Wal-Mart-induced price-war could further deflate costs in cate­gories like toys, electronics and food.

In 1964, when conservative Republicanism was at its nadir, Ronald Reagan gave a speech in support of Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater entitled, "A Time for Choosing." In that speech, Reagan said, "This is the issue of this election: Whether we believe in our capacity for self-gov­ernment or whether we abandon the American revolution and confess that a lit­tle intellectual elite in a far-distant capitol can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves." Those words sparked Ronald Reagan's political career and a revived conservative movement which helped him win the White House. 
Today the people of Indiana's Second District face that same issue in this election. At the time this column was written, recent polls placed Democrat Joe Donnelly and Republican Chris Chocola in a statistical dead heat, and today voters must decide whether the candidate they elect will create a gov­ernment which works for the intellec­tual elite or the people of Indiana. 
Throughout his campaign, Donnelly has asserted that he is a pro-life mod­erate who would be an independent voice for Indiana. In fact, on his cam­paign website's section on life issues, Donnelly claims, "In keeping with my personal faith and family values, I have consistently opposed abortion and will continue to do so in Congress ... I will always vote according to my faith and my conscience on life issues." I would like to think that Joe Donnelly is an honorable and honest man, so I will take him at his word. 
Unfortunately, this forces Donnelly to choose between his conscience and his party. Nancy Pelosi, the current Democratic House Minority Leader,

would likely be the Speaker of the House in the event of a Democratic takeover. Nancy Pelosi's voting record, like those of most of the House Democratic leadership, has awarded her with a perfect 100 score from NAHAL Pro-Choice America, and a stark zero from National Right to Life. In order for Joe Donnelly to "always vote according to [his] faith and [his] conscience on life issues," he would have to vote against his party for Speaker, which is so serious that it is akin to changing from one party to another. 
If elected, Joe Donnelly would be forced to vote against his most cher­ished beliefs to install Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives who don't trust Hoosier values, but pursue the agenda of that small intellectual elite identified by Ronald Reagan. Joe Donnelly's Democratic House leadership would appoint Rep. Dennis Kucinich as chair­man of the House Government Reform Committee's Subcommittee on National Security. If you haven't heard, Dennis Kucinich once said that "we cannot justify giving the Attorney General the ability to designate domestic terror groups," and argued that the removal of the terrorist regime in Afghanistan was unjustified. 
The Democratic House leadership Joe Donnelly would put in power would place John Dingell in the chair­man's seat of the House Energy Committee. Rep. Dingell voted four times to raise the tax on gasoline. Gas taxes are arguably regressive, but the wallets of lower-income Americans are apparently unimportant compared to the theories of a small, intellectual elite. On key issues as energy, abor­tion, national security and others Joe Donnelly's Democratic leadership just doesn't trust the American people to govern themselves. 
I have never met Joe Donnelly, ·and as such I give him the benefit of the doubt that he is an honest man with good intentions. Unfortunately, the fact of the matter is that Joe Donnelly would vote for Democratic House lead­ers who care more for the machina­tions of a small intellectual elite than the needs of everyday workers. 
As Ronald Reagan so eloquently said, this is a time for choosing. Fortunately we do have a choice who would contin­ue Reagan's legacy and trust the peo­ple to govern themselves. Chris Chocola has a track record of inde­pendence, unblemished ethics and leadership (particularly in the area of spending discipline) in the House of Representatives which is consistent with the Indiana values he holds so dearly. 
In contrast to Chris' Democratic predecessor Tim Roemer, who lived in Washington and rarely returned home, Representative Chocola returns here every weekend on the red-eye flight and spends his time helping seniors sign up for Medicare prescription drug benefits, building support for job development and listening to the con­cerns of the people he serves. The dif­ference is clear. 
Regardless of the outcome, today will be a historic day in American politics. If we choose Joe Donnelly, our country will lose one of its brightest and most committed leaders, and our Congress will likely serve the interests of a small, intellectual elite. If we choose Chris Chocola, we can keep Reagan's legacy alive through at least one seat in Congress and build a renewed majority which believes in our capacity for self-government. It's your choice.

QUOTE OF THE DAY 
"Beauty is not caused. It is ... 
Emily Dickinson poet 



Vote Libertarian 
"The American political system is like a gigantic Mexican Christmas fiesta. Each political party is a huge pinata -a paper donkey, for example. The donkey is filled with full employment, low interest rates, affordable housing, comprehensive med­ical benefits, a bal­

other goodies. The American voter is Guest blindfolded and given Columnist a stick. The voter then swings the stick wildly in every direction, trying to hit a political candidate on the head and knock some sense into the silly fool." 
These lines ring as true today as they did fifteen years ago when PJ O'Rourke published his classic, "Parliament of Whores." 
Election time always brings out the worst in the candidates. While there isn't necessarily anything wrong with negative ads that attack the opposition candidate's voting record or policies, this is seldom the type of ad used. After taking a few actions of the opposing candidate out of context, the commercial not-so-subtly implies that not only does the other guy cheat on his payroll taxes and hate his constituents, he probably also eats babies and kills puppies for a living. These types of ad hominem attacks are cheap attempts to distract from the real issues in an election, yet character assassina­tion is usually the only strategy used. In the minds of the two major parties, there is no right or wrong. There is only power. 
While each party would have you believe that their party represents a clear alternative to the other fiscally, the difference is largely one of rhetoric, not of principle. Neither has a problem with taking your money and giving it to some­one else to whom it does not belong; the only debate is over who should be the recipient of this confiscated wealth. Whether your wealth goes to pay people not to work through welfare, to pay old people because they are old through Social Security or Medicare or to pay cor­porations because they are well connect­ed through no-bid contracts, it really doesn't make too much of a difference; Both parties either view the citizen as a sheep to be fleeced or a constituent to lavish the money of others upon. Each views the citizen as a thing to be regulat­ed and controlled. 
If you actually believe that the Republicans represent an alternative to the tax and spend Democrats, consider the fact that between the years 2001 and 2006, federal spending has increased from $1.657 trillion to $2.488 trillion, all years of Republican control of both the House of Representatives and the Presidency. The Republicans have been in full control of both the Executive and Legislative branches since 2002, yet the self-proclaimed "party of small govern­ment" has been responsible for this unprecedented increase in federal gov­ernment spending, unrivaled in the last 50 years except for the "great spender"-Lyndon B. Johnson. Clearly, the Republicans are no alternative. 
Similarly, while each party would have you believe that their party represents a clear alternative to the other on social issues, the difference is again largely one of rhetoric, not of prindple. Neither actu­ally believes that a person owns himself -if he owns himself, he has the right to do what he pleases with his own body and property, as long as he doesn't infringe on the right of others to do the same. No one's rights have been violated when a person decides he wants to play poker with his own money online. It is his property and he has the right to use it as he pleases. No one's rights have been vio­lated when a person decides that he wants to use drugs in his own home. He owns himself and therefore has the right to put whatever he wants in his own body, even if it hurts him. No one's rights have been violated when a person decides he doesn't want to live any more. 
Since he owns himself, he has the right to die if he wants. No one's rights have been violated when a person says some­thing offensive on a college campus. Victimless crimes are not crimes, yet internet gambling is illegal (except for a few exceptions), the Drug War persists, euthanasia is illegal in most states and speech codes are prevalent. Again, the citizen is viewed as a thing to be regulat­ed and controlled. 
This election, vote for the only party that wants you to keep what you earn.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Irish spirit strong among graduate students 
I was disappointed and offended to learn the "iew that under­graduates seem to have of graduate students at Notre Dame. The following statement could not be more unfounded: "The sense of identity that undergraduates derive from their place at the universi­ty is for the most part absent in graduate students who have stronger ties to their own colleges." 
I attended a public undergraduate university and dreamt of one day being able to have the college experience I had missed. I sacri­ficed to make that happen, cried the day I found out I got into Notre Dame and have taken on almost $100,000 worth ofloans to see my dream through. I pray at the grotto, attend mass in the basilica, and lived on campus last year. I purchased Father Hesburgh's book and got him to sign it for me. I have the "Here Come the Irish" video linked to my e-mail signature, and my eyes get watery every time I hear the Alma Mater. I played on the MBA Late-night Olympics team, which won last year, and I took photos on the sidelines as my classmates won the flag football championship in the stadium last year (many of them claimed it was the greatest moment of their lives). I am one of the MBA students who took an RV to the Georgia Tech game, rented a bus to attend the MSU game and woke up at 3 
a.m. to watch the UClA game online from a hotel room in China. 
I am not concerned with our right to purchase tickets to away games-as you can see, I've gone through the trouble of finding tickets on my own. My point is that I am just as Irish as anyone and no one can ever take that away from me. No one has a right to defme what someone else's experience at Notre Dame is (or isn't). Like most undergrads, I love Notre Dame with ali my heart, am proud to be a student here, have made some of the greatest friends in the world here, will always cheer for the Irish and give back to this community that has given me some of the best memories of my life. 
Most of the people I spend time with are MBA students and they have as much school spirit as anyone. They are outstanding people who possess the types of values that should characterize all Notre Dame students. We might not be fortunate enough to experience everything that Notre Dame offers its undergrads during their four years here, but we go out of our way to take in as much of Notre Dame as possible. And if you ask me, we appreciate it even more because of what we have sacrificed to be here and because we appreciate how great we have it here versus at other schools. 
I hope the letters we have sent will change the perspective that undergrads have of us. However, even if they don't, no one can take from us the right to call ourselves Irish or the wonderful experience we are getting as Notre Dame students.

A woman's view on Plan B 
I would like to add a female voice to the dis­cussion concerning Plan B. In Andrew Rosatostates' Letter to the Editor ("Plan B destroys embryo in some cases," Nov. 3), he writes, "Taking Plan B causes the destruction of a human embryo in those cases where it pre­vents its implantation." The use of the word "destruction" is a bit strong. If Plan B were a pill full of microscopic men with machetes and machine guns being transported directly to the uterus .vith the sole purpose of mutilating a fer­tilized egg, then "destruction" might be appro­priate. But from my understanding. that is not the case. 
Emergency contraceptives are to be used in case of an emergency (what a concept). Condoms fail. The pill fails. Furthermore, aren't those also ways of preventing pregnancy? Plan B is the second choice to preventing pregnan­cies when previous efforts break or when your mother-in-law manipulates your birth control pill a la Desperate Housewives. 
The distributors of Plan B do not deny the possibility of preventing the implantation of an embryo in the uterus, therefore neither will I. They do, however, confess that there is no evi­dence proving that Plan B will harm the fetus (nor the woman, but she's usually not the issue in these arguments) during early pregnancy. You see, friends, an embryo is not a pregnancy until it is implanted in the uterus. An abortifa­cient is something that terminates a pregnancy, not something that prevents an embryo from attaching to the uterus. So, riddle me this: Doesn't every embryo have the same possibility of not implanting, with or without the super dose of hormones? 
Pregnancy is such a fickle thing; sometimes it lasts nine months, sometimes it doesn't. When attacking Plan B, please keep in mind that the Food and Drug Administration and the manu­facturers of Plan B are required to state that it may prevent implantation. There is no indis­putable video evidence for either side, thus the call on the field must stand. This is the same FDA that has to warn you that your Viagra may cause blindness. But, then again, what do I know? I'm just a woman and it's just my body.

Vary the stadium wave 
There are two very different views on the wave's place in Notre Dame Stadium. One is that it belongs in the same place as "thunder sticks," and that place is nowhere near any sporting event (but that's a whole different issue). The other view is that it is harmless and fun. I happen to fall somewhere in between these views, but I want to bring up a few rules that I feel are necessary for good "waving." 
The first rule is that the game needs to be out of hand. This will be defined as a lead of over twenty points late in the third quarter. This means that the wave is not allowed late in the first half when we're trying to score more points (like this past week's game). The second rule is that we have to make the wave unique. We're talking about Notre Dame here. There are currently scientists working around the clock to find a way for us to "light up the universe." No ordinary wave will do. 
I suggest two wave variations to get us start­ed. The first is to split the wave into two parts. This has been done before; it's when the stu­dent section sends the wave back in the oppo­site direction so that two waves cross each other. The second is to do the slow motion wave. To my knowledge this has never been done before. During this variation, the student section will slow the wave down by standing up slowly and waiting a longer amount of time before starting their own individual wave. 
There is, of course, one more alternative to consider: sit (or stand) on your seat and watch the bloody football game.

SARAH LOVELAND 
'BIG LOVE' REVIEW 
Questions of love and gender politics have been central aspects of the human condition from the time of the ancient Greeks until the modern era. These questions also lie at the core of Charles 
L. Mee's play "Big Love," the first main­stage production of the film, television and theater (FTT) department's 2006­2007 season. 
Based on Aeschylus's "The Suppliant Women," which is considered the earli­est surviving play in Western drama, "Big Love" takes the ancient plot of its source material and updates it as an examination of modern gender politics, creating a theatrical hybrid of vaudeville and tragicomedy. 
The play opens in turmoil, with 50 Greek brides flee by boat to an Italian in order to escape their forced marriages to their 50 cousins. The 50 sisters are represented by three: Lydia (Sarah Loveland), Thyona (Megan O'Donoghue) and Olympia (Tashi Thomas). After con­vincing the villa's owner Piero (Luke Cieslewicz), his nephew Giuliano (Conor Woods) and grandmother Bella (Meg Robenalt) to allow them to stay, their plans are abruptly thwarted by the arrival of the 50 grooms, led by Constantine (Drew McElligott), Nikos {Matt Goodrich) and Oed {Mike Anderson). The two opposing sides find their strongest voices in the extreme positions of Thyona and Constantine. 
Plans are hatched, emotions explode and an engaging dialogue on the inequalities of the human experience is present throughout the play. Mee blends the age-old battle of the sexes found in Aeschylus's original text with various contemporary American themes, such as domestic abuse, date rape and gen­der inequality. Much of the play is taken up in an exhaustive and exhausting demonstration of just how deeply gen­der animosities can grow and how hor­rifying the consequences can be when a balance is not found. 
Directed by FTT faculty member Siiri Scott, "Big Love" has been an exciting,

yet difficult production for all involved. The performances are being held in the Philbin Studio Theater at the DeBartolo Center for the Performing Arts, as opposed to the Decio Mainstage. Senior Ashley Kelly, the production's stage manager, emphasized the flexibility and creativity that the Philbin grants any production. It allows for "limitless things in the space ... that wouldn't be possible in the Decio," Kelly said. 
Kelly also noted the challenge that the space presents for the actors. 
"I think its more challenging for an actor," Kelly said. "Because you get extremely close to the audience, where­as in the Decio you can't even see them." 
The smaller space also places more emphasis on the staging area itself. The set design is simple and attractive, high­lighted by the lighting design of Notre Dame professor Richard Dreyer. The technical difficulties of the play, mainly attributed to the transitions between the varying tempos, are solved through the expert use of music and light through­out the play. 
Sophomore crew member Caitlin Madden emphasized the use of the music and light in order to help the audience members follow along with the story. 
"You've got a whole bunch of difl'erent things trying to happen at .once and in order to have the audience sit there and respond to these different emotions, you have to make sure that they can feel it," Madden said. 
The fifteen cast members all work together to pull off an exciting and ener­getic storyline. Although many of the members are veterans of the Notre Dame stage, there are also five fresh­man members, which is unusual for a mainstage show. The lead actresses, Loveland, O'Donoghue and Thomas, do a skillful job of expressing the emotional distress and duress of the three sisters. Likewise, the three lead males, McElligott, Goodrich and Anderson, 

STORIES B y E 
serve as ideal balances to all of the points brought up by the women. 
The residents of the Italian villa, Cieslewicz, Woods and Hobenalt, also do an outstanding job in their roles as out­side observers of the central conflict. The cast is rounded out well by Eddie Velazquez, Stephanie Elise Newsome, Ashley Fox, Huyen Nguyen, John Maltese and Joe Vittoria. 
Kelly highlighted the struggles of working with such a large cast and crew. 
"It's a pretty big cast, we have 15, which is borderline between medium and large. We also have a huge stage management team, comparatively," she said. "We have myself, and then a stage manager and then two ASMs. 
"And then we also have a director, an assistant director and a fight choreogra­pher. So [there are] just a lot of people." 
Although "Big Love" is inspired by an ancient story, it impressively contains plenty of thoughtful and inspiring themes, bringing light to modern issues regarding gender politics and relation­ships. 
Loveland in particular notes the play's subject matter and its pertinence to young people. 
"It talks a lot about gender politics and the role of relationships and of men and men. And we're in that stage of our lives, and so are these characters," Loveland said. 
"Big Love" is an excellent produetion, due to both its outstanding script and the wonderful performances by both cast and crew. It is enjoyable not only as a performance piece, but also a re11ee­tion on modernity's approach to men, women and relationships. 
"Big Love" will be performed in the Philbin Studio Theater of the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center beginning today at 7:30 p.m. and continuing until Nov. 
17. For further information regarding admission and show times, visit the DPAC website, http://performing arts.nd.edu.

R I N MCGINN Q&A WITH 'BIG LOVE' SENIORS 

"Big Love," the latest mainstage pro­duction presented by the film, televi­sion and theater (FTT) department, features several Notre Dame seniors within its large· cast. Those actors -Conor Woods, Drew McElligott, Mike t\nderson and Sarah Loveland -see the production's message, director and unique staging as essential aspects of this latest production. 
Erin McGinn: Why did you decide to get involved with this production of "Big Love?" 
Conor Woods: Well, "Big Love" is a really challenging script in terms of it [having] a lot of movement. It's got a lot of monologues and it's not realistic in the sense of a Tennessee Williams play. It has a lot of abstract moments, and it's really an actor's dream. Almost every character has a moment where they tell their philosophy of life and what they think life and love [are] all about. And I really love the message of the play, which is that love trumps all. So, to be in that [production) is really a treat. 
Drew McElligott: I really liked the script, and I really liked a lot of the characters in it. It's a really character­driven show, [with) a lot of different people in it. That's something that really attracted me to it. We have a really talented director, Siiri Scott. She was actually a huge draw, not only for me, but also for the majority of the other people in the cast. It was just a great opportunity to work with her in a more professional stance. 
Mike Anderson: Well, I knew people that were auditioning, and I had Siiri Scott as a director in many of my class­es. I've had experience with her before, and I wanted to be directed by her, which is one of the main reasons why I auditioned. 
Sarah Loveland: It's always fun to do the departmental shows, and because it is so physical -that's why I was

:es In a physical battle of the wills with 
e) while the sisters take refuge In Italy. 
drawn to the play initially. And Siiri is a wonderful director. 
McGinn: Can you describe. your char­acter? 
Woods: Yeah, J play an openly gay character [Giulianol. which is always fun. And the character just really helps the three sisters -there are 50 sis­ters, but only three in the play -and just teaches them to be who they are, and in that sense it is a very socially­conscious play. It has a lot of mes­sages. He's very flamboyant and he is just like, "that's the way I am, and that's the way it's going to be." J really thought that was such a great mes­sage, and to get to play someone who is that self-confident is really such a treat. 
McElligott: I am the egotistical jack­ass of the play [Constantine], with a soft side, of course. I am kind of the "manly man" -I represent everything macho, basically. About four lines into the show, everyone hates me, and then it's kind of my fight through the rest of the show to kind of turn [the audience] around on me, and convince them that I actually have a point -that the way J am serves a purpose, which is kind of a big challenge. 
Anderson: My charactm is Oed, he's one of the brothers, cousins of the three girls, that they go to find them to marry them. Oed is kind of the sidekick of the brothers-he doesn't say much. He's quiet and he doesn't say anything unless it's important. He's more of the goofball out of the three brothers. 
Loveland: I am playing Lydia, [who] is one of the three sisters. She's sort of the wild sister who goes out all night, and is kind of crazy, but then she's sort of eventually tamed by love. Well, not necessarily tamed, but she's the one that actually acknowledges love and goes in that direction. 
McGinn: What was it like working on this production? 

Woods: It certainly has been a very challenging production to work on. I think it was a lot harder than wn thought it was going to be, but I feel like we're ready for audiences to just absorb the messages that are in it. And I think that we're really excited about that, and for them to see it. And it's really funny too. It has a lot of really funny moments, but a lot of really thoughtful moments as well. 
McElligott: This production actually has been very different from a lot of shows. In addition to FTT shows, I've done loads upon loads of student shows -I've done about 15 plays dur­ing my time at Notre Dame -and when you do an FTT show, you get to do a lot more technically-speaking. This will be the first time I get to rap­pel from the rafters, and I learned how to flip myself without hurting myself for this show, which was fun to learn. 
Anderson: It's the most physical play that I've ever been in. Just some of the stuff that we do -it's draining. Even though it's a short play, I've had to do a lot of things that I've never done before. This one, it jumps around a lot. It's kind of weird [because] it goes from this reality to this stylized dream stage and back and forth a lot. I think that was different than most of the plays I've done usually, which were more straightforward. 
And some of the stuff we're doing is a lot different, like rappelling down from the catwalks, which is pretty cool. A lot of music is involved in this play too, and usually there was not a ton of music in the shows that I've done in the past. 
Loveland: Well, I was really exeited to get started doing it because it's so physical. The whole time it's just been a bunch of surprises, and everything's been really exciting.

Associated Press 

SEATTLE -Craig Terrill and the Seattle Seahawks delivered the kind of defensive performance they needed with Shaun Alexander and Matt Hasselbeck on the sideline with injuries. 
Facing the Oakland Raiders on a stormy night sure helped the cause. 
Terrill had three of Seattle's nine sacks and Seneca Wallace threw a touchdown pass to get his first win as an NFL starter, a 16-0 victory over the Raiders on Monday night. 
The Seahawks (5-3) had lost three of four games c;ince Alexander, last year's league MVP, was sidelined with a broken foot. Hasselbeck, a Pro Bowl quarterback last year, has missed two straight games with a sprained knee liga­ment, limiting Seattle's big-strike ability. 
But backups Wallace and Maurice Morris did enough to make up for those losses on this night. Wallace went 18-of-30 for 176 yards, including a 22-yard TD pass to Deion Branch in the first quarter, against the Raiders (2-6). 
Morris ran for a career­high 138 yards on 30 car­ries as the Seahawks had a season-high 207 yards on the ground . 
While the backups 
stepped up to help give the defending NFC champion Seahawks a one-game lead over St. Louis in the NFC \Vest, it was the improve­ment on defense that was most notable. 
Seattle had allowed at least 28 points in five suc­cessive games for the first time since its first five games in existence in 1976, and held the opposi­tion scoreless in only one of the previous 17 quar­ters. 
But the Seahawks had little trouble shutting down Oakland's last-ranked offense on a wet and windy night that made it difficult for the offenses. The Raiders gained only 185 yards and failed to score an offensive touch­down for the fifth time in eight games this season. 
Andrew Walter was 16­of-35 for 166 yards and couldn't get the ball deep to Randy Moss against a defense that had been sus­ceptible to the long pass. 
Seattle sacked Walter five times in the first quar~ ter, including on three suc­cessive plays -the last two by Terrill. The Seahawks added four more in the game, raising Oakland's NFL worst total to 44 on the season. 
The Raiders had won two straight after dropping the first five games of the season. 
IN BRIEF 

Rangers hire Washington 
as new manager 

ARLINGTON, Texas -Ron Washington has always been a popu­lar coach with players, stressing communication and letting them be themselves. 
Now he will get his chance as a manager with the Texas Hangers, who wanted and needed somebody with those characteristics. 
''I'm going to be a players' manag­er. My job is solely to make sure that every player on the Texas Rangers feels like they are part of everything going on here," Washington said Monday night. 
"As a manager, I'm no good if the players don't get it done. If the play­ers get it done, I'm great." 
When Buck Showalter was fired after an 80-82 season with three years left on his contract, general manager Jon Daniels said the Rangers needed a "different per­spective." 
Malkin captures player of 
the month llonors 
It took less than a month for Evgeni Malkin to garner his first NHL award. 
Sure he was the rookie of the month for October, but it only took him one day of November to do something that hadn't been done in nearly a century. 
The latest Pittsburgh Penguins phenom has taken the league by storm, capturing piayer of the month honors despite dressing for only five games. 
On Wednesday, Malkin became the first player since the NHL started in 1917 to notch goals in his first six games. 
His second goal in that win over Los Angeles was the difference in a 4-3 overtime victory. 
"It's still a little bit difficult because I'm not used to playing on the wing. But I think it's going to take a little bit of time," said Malkin. 
3-year-old Preak.ness winner 
Bernardini retires LEXINGTON, Ky.-Bernardini has run his last race. 
Two days after finishing second in the $5 million Breeders' Cup Classic, the 3-year-old colt was retired Monday and will stand at stud at Sheik Mohammed's Darley farm. 
Bernardini was the leading Horse of the year contender entering the Classic at Churchill Downs off six straight victories, including the Preakness, the Travers and the Jockey Club Gold Cup. 
Sent off as the even-money favorite in the Classic, Bernardini made a bold move around the turn to take the lead but was overtaken in the stretch by Invasor. 
Bernardini is owned by Sheik Mohammed, the ruler of Dubai. Darley, one of the world's largest breeding operations, said on its Web site that Bernardini's stud fee is $100,000.


Miller to mtss at least four weeks 

Associated Press 
SACRAMENTO, Calif.-Kings center Brad Miller will miss at least four weeks with an injured left foot, adding the biggest problem yet to. Sacramento's early season woes. 
The 7 -foot Miller, a three-time All-Star, played for the U.S. national team at the world championships in Japan this summer. 
He was diagnosed with a torn plantar fascia in his left foot Monday after the injury limited his playing time on the Kings' road trip last week. 
The ninth-year pro has aver­aged 6.0 points in the Kings' first three games, going 8-for­28 from the field. An MHI yield­ed the result Sacramento feared 

 after Miller was limited to 15 minutes in Saturday's loss at Milwaukee. 
Miller declined comment when he showed up in the Kings' locker room 45 minutes before Monday's game with Minnesota, using crutches and wearing an immobilizing boot on his foot. 
Forwards Shareef Abdur­Rahim, Kenny Thomas and Maurice Taylor will team up to replace Miller for the Kings. The 6-9 Abdur-Rahim seemed confident in his ability to defend the NBA's tallest players. 
"It's not like it's something I haven't done before," Abdur­Rahim said. 
''I'll have to use the advan­tages I might have and just try to keep them off the glass." 
Coach Eric Musselman's first season in Sacramento already has been scarred by injuries. Guard Mike Bibby returned from a thumb injury two weeks earlier than expected to play in last week's season opener.

play we ran, I'd have all the time in the world." 
On the ensuing Stanford pos­session, the Griffins encountered a third and short. They ran twice, once with fullback Rick Loesing and once with tailback Tregg Duerson, and were stuffed both times by the Mob defensive line, resulting in a turnover on downs. 
Both defenses held strong until the ftrst play of the fourth quar­ter, when Mob running back Braden Turner stretched the ball across the goal line for a one­yard touchdown run to stretch the lead to 12. 
That score capped another 11­play drive that utilized short tim­ing routes to take advantage of Stanford's loose defensive arrangement. 
"The corners were playing ofT the ball seven to ten yards," Stroh said. 
Turner finished with 10 carries for 34 yards and a touchdown, and fullback Mike Mattingly car­ried 10 times for 4 7 yards. The offensive line cre­

McBrayer's first touchdown pass went to Carl Anderson, a play that capped a 1 0-play, 65­yard drive that successfully answered the Ramblers' 35-yard field goal in the first quarter. After forcing a three-and-out on the ensuing series, Morrissey went right back to the passing game. McBrayer hit wide out Dan Reimer over the middle, and the receiver turned it up field for a 41-yard touchdown. 
Following another Rambler three-and-out, McBrayer again led an efficient two-minute drill culminating in a 26-yard touch­down pass to Reimer just before half. 
"I think it was big to air it out before halftime, because at that point we were able to put our foot on their throat," Klein said. "We've defmitely had a stronger passing game this year than in the past." 
McBrayer would also convert several key third-down quarter­back sneaks throughout the con­test, including a 4-yard touch­down in the third quarter to push the score to 27-3. 
Morrissey turned to its tradi­tional power-running attack in 
the second half, 
behind the 
three-pronged 

but a dropped pass in the flat was ruled a fumble and O'Neill recov­ered. The Mob turned the ball over on downs, but left Stanford no time to do anything with the ball. 
"The line was opening up holes, and we were taking advantage of it," Mattingly said. 
Morrissey 27, Siegfried 10 
In the second quarter Sunday, Morrissey quarterback Joe McBrayer unleashed an aerial assault on Siegfried, scoring three touchdowns to put the game out of reach in the Manor's semifmal win. 
"The score was not really indicative of how Siegfried played today," Morrissey fullback Steve Klein said. "We've lost twice in the semis in the past four years, and I think that sen­ior leadership was what put us over the top." 
Senior leadership may have been one of the contributing fac­tors in the game, but Morrissey's passing game was what put it out of reach. McBrayer connect­ed on 6-of-9 passes for 117 yards in the win. 
able to muster a 

small raJly late in the third quarter behind some strong running by fullback Marcus Young, who had 7 car­ries for 36 yards. The Ramblers quickly answered McBrayer's touchdown dive with a quick S­play, 65-yard drive that ended with a 14-yard strike from quar­terback Max Young to receiver Kevin Kelly. 
Young struggled much of the day against a Morrissey line that seemed to get pressure early and often. He did, however manage to complete 7-of-13 passes for 91 yards. But a costly interception to the Manorites' Mike Fletcher on their first second-half posses­sion effectively snuffed out any chance of a rally. 
While the Cinderella run ended for the seventh-seeded Ramblers, Morrissey will face off against O'Neill in Notre Dame Stadium Sunday, Nov. 19. 
"I can't imagine what it's going to feel like," Klein said. "It's amazing."

The ensuing Whirlwind drive ended prematurely when Bulfin caught her second pick of the half, this time taking it untouched all the way for a touchdown to extend the lead to 14-0. 
Pasquerilla West tacked on a final score with 7:45 left to play in the second half when Davies converted another fourth­down, going back to Spring for a seven-yard touchdown. 
Purple Weasel defensive back Caitlin O'Connell clinched the game for Pasquerilla West with one final pick of a Gargula pass, this time with five min­utes remaining on the clock. 
The Purple Weasel sideline erupted after finishing the shutout against the No. 1 team. 
"It feels great to beat Welsh Fam. They're a great opponent and we really needed to exe­cute well to beat them the way we did," Spring said. 
Pasquerilla West will play Pangborn in a rematch of last year's championship game. The teams already faced off once this season, with the Phoxes escaping by the slimmest of margins in a 13-12 game. 
"We need to execute the way we did today to beat Pangborn," Spring said. "They're a really good team and we're excited to play them." 
Pangborn 20, Farley 7 

Early in the first half Sunday, Pangborn wide receiver caught a short pass and then ran downfield 35 yards for the touchdown in one of several big plays for the Phoxes in their semifinal win over Farley. 
The win puts the Phoxes back into the championship 

game for the second year in a row. 
"We are excited about play­ing in the stadium again this year. We are definitely planning on coming out on top," Pangborn quarterback Katie Mooney said 
In its opening drive, Pangborn's offense was met by strong pressure from Farley's defensive line. After the Finest forced the Phoxes to punt, Pangborn's defense took the field and refused to yield. Farley quarterback Brittany Baron's attempts to move the ball down the field were stopped by the Phoxes, setting up a Farley punt. 
Farley was determined to keep the game in reach, and on its first possession after the Bescher touchdown answered back with one of their own. Baron threw a short 5-yard pass into the endzone to even the score at 7-7. 
The Phoxes responded quick­ly, adding six more points when Mooney dropped back and found another receiver open in the endzone. A quarterback sneak stretched the lead back to seven and put the Finest away. 
With just seconds remaining in the half, it looked like Farley would be down by a single score, but the Phoxes wanted to insure their lead. On the first play of the drive, Mooney launched a deep pass for the game's final score, putting the Phoxes up ·20-7 and sealing the game. 
After such a high-powered first half, the two defenses came out strong after the break. Both defensive lines stuffed the opposing team's rushing attack and both sec­ondaries provided excellent pass coverage. 
Farley did make one final charge toward the goal line deep in the fourth quarter, but Finest comeback hopes van­ished when Baron's pass was intercepted on the 5-yard line.

"He's one of those guys who doesn't start for us, but even if he doesn't start he's going to be a finisher," Brey said. "I think he's going to finish a lot of games." 
The Knights stuck with Notre Dame for the first few minutes and trailed only 12-10 with 
15:22 left in the first half. Then the Irish switched to a full court press and went on a 14-0 run over the next five minutes. 
"We said we were going to try to get up into their guards, and the first couple times with points on 5-of-11 shooting (2­of-4 from 3-point range}. The senior guard also added five rebounds, two assists and one steal. 
Notre Dame led 50-33 at halftime, but the Knights trad­ed baskets with the Irish for most of the second half. With 
3:22 left in the game, the teams had played to a 23-23 tie after the break. 
"In the second half we got a little lackadaisical because we were up so many points," Carter said. 
The Irish then went on a 12­1 run to end the game, capped by a dunk by freshman guard Joe Harden at the buzzer.

"This team was definitely more physical than Rockhurst, which was good for us, espe­cially our front line," the fresh­man said.

Notes: 
+ Irish guard Colin Falls scored just eight points on 2­of-3 shooting in 30 minutes. But Brey was not concerned with his senior's lack of attempts because of the way he played off the ball and how he contributed to the team's performance. 
Brey has touted Falls early this season for being one of the smartest players he's coached at Notre Dame given his grasp of the system. 
"I looked at the box score and said 'God, Falls only took three shots.' He just kind of flowed and fit in," Brey said. "Teams know about him as our returning guy, but if we can take what the D gives us and not force things, we'll like to have that."

INTERHALL PLAYOFFS 

Headed to the House that Rock built 
By BILL BRINK and COLIN REIMER Sports Writers 
Playoff games are won in the trenches, and O'Neill dug its trenches deep. 
Both lines manhandled their Griffin opponents during the Mob's 12-0 victory over Stanford on Sunday to advance to Notre Dame Stadium for the Interhall championship game Nov. 19. 
O'Neill started strong, putting together an 11-play, 65-yard drive that resulted in a five-yard touchdown pass from quarter­back Chris Stroh to receiver Alex Fortunato. 
The scoring play was set up by a 34-yard completion from Stroh to receiver Nate Forte, who caught four balls for 94 yards, giving the Mob a first-and-goal on the five-yard line. Stroh praised the offensive line for its protection in the passing game. 
"Our offensive line is great," said Stroh, who completed 12­of-16 passes for 14 7 yards with

Irish seeded twelfth in NCAA Tournament 
By.GREG ARBOGAST

Twelve seems to be the number of the day for Notre Dame. 
The No. 12 Irish were given the 12th seed in the NCAA Tournament when the brackets were announced late Monday afternoon. 
By earning one of the 16 avail­able seeds to the 48 teams in the tournament, Notre Dame will receive a first round bye, and it will play the winner of the match between No. 23 Illinois-Chicago and Western Illinois at home Nov. 
15. The top four seeds in the tour­nament went to Duke (16-3-1), Wake Forest (15-3-3), SMU (17-1­
4) and Virginia (14-3-1). 
The Irish enter the NCAA Tournament with a record of 13­5-2 on the season, but they are coming off a loss in their last game -a 2-1 overtime defeat to Rutgers in the Big East quarterfi­nals. That game was played on

Oct. 28, meaning Notre Dame will have had almost three weeks without an official game by the time they take the field for its opening game of the NCAA Tournament. 
Irish coach Bobby Clark is doing everything he can to make sure his team puts the extra time to good use. 
"A break can make you rusty or it can make you sharp," Clark said. "It's up to myself and the staff to make sure that the break makes us sharp." 
Senior co-captain Greg Dalby, who was named Big East mid­fielder of the year, feels that the team has benefited from the time off as it has allowed the Irish to recuperate. 
"We took a couple of days off to decompress and just relax after the regular season," Dalby said. "It's very strenuous mentally, physically, and emotionally going through Wednesday-Saturday games almost the whole regular season, so we've just been laying low."

Sometimes, even Whirlwinds get blown away. 
Welsh Family's undefeated season was spoiled Sunday in a 21-0 loss to Pasquerilla West in the Interhall semifinals. 
Behind two interceptions from defensive back Brigid Bulfin ­one of which was returned 23 yards for a touchdown -and two touchdown passes from quarterback Cara Davies, the Purple Weasels were able to shut down the previously potent Whirlwinds. 
After a slow start by both teams in the opening 11 min­utes, Bulfin intercepted a Jenni Gargula pass on the Purple Weasel 12-yard line. The Pasquerilla West offense did not let her efforts go to waste. 
After driving to the Whirlwind 21-yard line, Davies rolled to her right on fourth-and-1 and found receiver Maureen Spring at the 17-yard line. Spring spun away from two defenders imme­

Zeller shines in preseason win 
By CHRIS KHOREY Associate Sports Editor 

Notre Dame jumped out to a 16-point lead early then coasted to an easy 85-57 win over Bellarmine Monday night at the Joyce Center in its sec­ond exhibition contest of the season. 
"I think we did pretty well," Irish guard RusselJ Carter said. "We're moving, we're talking, and we're rebounding -that's a big difference from last year. We're just getting to the ball faster." 
With junior forward Rob Kurz out with a broken nose, sophomore forward Luke Zeller stepped up in the post with 15 points on 6-of-1 0 shooting, nine rebounds and two blocks. Zeller led a bal­anced Irish attack that had three players in double fig­ures and six players with eight or more points. 
"Zeller is just getting more and more confident," Irish coach Mike Brey said. "He's found a nice rhythm. We just have to keep working with him and keep him confident." 
Sophomore forward Zach Hillesland took Kurz's place in the starting lineup, scoring
