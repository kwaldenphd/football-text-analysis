A $25,000 granthas been awarded to the University of Notre Dame by the Rockefeller Foundation to catalogue and preserve the papers of Fr. Theodore M. Hesburgh, University Presi­dent. The grant was in recognition ofHesburgh's 21 years ofservice on the foundation's board of trustees, five of them as chairman before his retirement earlier this year. Another grant of $25,000 was given to Yale University for work on the papers of-Cyrus R. Vance, former Secretary of State, who was a foundation board member for eight years, one of them as chairman. Vance also retired from the board earlier this year. Hesburgh's papers include those collected during almost three decades of public service, beginning with the first of 14 presidential appointments, that to the National Science Board in 1954. All are in the University's Archives, with the excep­tion of those from his 15 years on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, which are in the Center for Civil and Human Rights in the Notre Dame Law School. -The Observer 
LaPorte Mayor Aloysius RumelyJr., the 
victim of a gunman's attack at his home Memorial Day, was barely conscious and in very critical condition yesterday, officials at St. joseph's Medical Center said. Rumely's condition has steadily deteriorated in the last two weeks, hospital spokesman Russ Ken­nedy said. Rumely, who was shot three times by an intruder at his home May 31, has developed internal bleeding and still is plagued by abscess a~d internal infections, Kennedy said. The 71-year-old mayor has been in critical condition since the shooting at his home that claimed the life of his wife, Frances. She was shot twice in the attack and died from blood loss. Harold W. Lang, 30, a former LaPorte city employee, is charged with murder, attempted murder and burglary in the shootings. City officials have said Lang, who lived less than three blocks from the Rumelys, may have attacked the mayor and his wife because Rumely would not help him get his job back at the city's sewage treatment plant. -AP 
Asmall airplanepiloted by controversial evangelist Lester Roloff crashed in a field near here yesterday, killing all five people aboard, officials said. Roloff took off in his Cessna 210 about 
8:30 am. with four other people to go to Kansas City to preach at a service at Calvary Baptist Church in Roosterville, Mo., yesterday night, said Dave Walkden, communications director for Roloff Evan­gelistic Enterprises. Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman Sam Saxon confirmed that the 68-year-old Roloff, a Baptist minister, was among the dead. George Burlage of th Federal Aviation Ad­ministration in Fort Worth said Roloff was registered on the plane's flight plan as the pilot of the aircraft, which was registered to the Rooff organization. The plane, en route from Corpus Christi to Kansas City, disappeared off radar at 10:18 a.m. without any indica­tion oftrouble, Burlage said. The wreckage was discovered about an hour later, he said. -AP 
PopeJohn Paul IIshook hands with Spain's Socialist premier-designate yesterday, then hours later spoke out against the new leader's campaign pledges to liberalize laws on divorce, con­traception and abortion. The Roman Catholic pontiff said his meeting with Felipe Gonzalez, whose Socialist Party won last week's general election by a landslide, should "remove any doubts -if there ever were any -about my respect for the country's freely elected leaders." He told Gonzalez and other political and military leaders the church respects "the temporal order ofthings" but must make itself heard on matters "that have to do with God and influence the conscience of his children, in their private and public lives." john Paul followed up with one of his strongest statements on what his church calls "family issues" at a twilight, open-air "Mass for the Christian Family." Police estimated 1.5 million people jammed the Pasco de Ia Castellana, one of Madrid's main arteries. -AP 
James Broderick, who portrayed the father in ABC­TV's "Family" series in the late 1970s, has died after a long bout with thyroid cancer. He was 55. Broderick died Monday at Yale-New Haven Hospita~ where he had been treated since Oct. 12, according to hospital spokesman Eugene Cooney. Born in Charlestown, N.H., Broderick appeared in such movies as "Alice's Restaurant" as Alice's husband, Ray, "Dog Day Afternoon" and "The Taking ofPelham One Two Three." His 25-year acting career also included roles in the Broadway plays "Johnny No Trump," "Let Me Hear You Smile," "A View From the Bridge" and "Maggie." He won a Roger Award for best performance in a Chicago production ofEdward Albee's "Who's Afraid of Virginia Wooli" In 1961, Broderick tourd 15 countries with Helen Hayes in a production ofTennessee Williams' "The Glass Menagerie." -AP

I set our for fall break in Los Angeles with high ex­pectations. Like most people, I thought of L.A. as the Glitter City. Southern California conjured up visions of laid-back, casual, prosperous success. 
The first thing that struck me about the city was the sheer enormity. Because of this sprawl, someone once commented that the only place you see people in L.A. is in their cars. I found this to be true. And the major purpose ofthose cars (transportation is secondary) is to reflect the personality of the owners. This was readily 
apparent. The traditional Mercedes Coupe that turns heads in other locales abounds to the point of red4n­dancy. I seldom saw a regular license plate; the per­sonalized, so called "vanity plates" predominated. Nearly every car, it seem.ed, bore the not-so-subtle statement, "Look at me; I've succeeded." 
Surrounding it all was a pervasive sense of prosperouscomercialism. Billboards were everywhere. New high-rises (mostly banks) are going up all over the downtown. Even the L.A. airport is undergoing vast renovation in anticipation of the countless hordes and billions ofdollars arriving for the Olympics in 1984. 
It seems every way I turned I was struck anew by someone demanding I buy, eat, join, visit, or sell some­thing. The ultimate commercial 0"
irony came about mid-we~k. while I was visiting Dis­neyland. Walt Disney said he\. ~ wanted no glimpse of tbe real world to be visible from inside Disneyland. After fif­teen minutes of enjoying one of the more popular rides known as "It's a Small World," I felt my faded hope in human nature beginning to be restored. Rounding the last corner, however, the il­lusion was shattered by the sight of foot-high lettering on the exit wall: "Wherever you go in the world, United World Bank is there for you." A reassurance I didn't need. 
A tour of Universal Studios seemed in a way to epitomize L.A. Asquad ofaspiring Robert Redford look­alikes gave us a schmaltzy tour ofthe facilities, allowing ample time to stock up on "I've Been to Hollywood" paraphenalia The only real knowledge I gained was what a large part deception plays in movlemaking. Through modern equipment, camera tricks and special effects, what we think we see in moyies is often a delu­sion. Movie makers rely largely on conning theatregoers into thinking what they want them to see. 
The greatest deception seemed to be the city itself. Los Angeles, unlike any other city I had visited before, seemed to lack a personality. All the glitter and glamour, I realized, were as much a facade as anything to be found in the backlot of Universal. 
The greatest irony seemed to lie with the inhabitants. I was surprised at the number of people in a city of 7 million that fell for the deception, lock, stock, and bar­rel. Nowhere was this more obvious then in Beverly Hills. As I took the inevitable tour of the celebrities homes, I marveled that such a big deal could be made of gawking purely for gawking sake. ,Beverly Hills stores, from Neiman-Marcus to Bullock's, seemed to thrive on the chicanery. In one boutique on Rodeo Drive, I saw a young girl proudly modeling-an expensive fashion that resembled a long, white sequined sweatshirt. In anoth­er window, I glanced at a gold-handled toothbrush. While I was there I learned that Beverly Hills grew out ofwhat used to be a bean farm. I left wondering ifit was an improvement. 


Near the end ofthe week, I found myself riding a city bus to downtown L.A. Seated near the front ofthe bus I saw a man talking rather loudly to no one in particular. His speech was rambling, largely incoherent, and was punctuated by obscenities. His voice rose and fell with 
the speed of the bus. His eyes were constantly moving, settling on nothing. A few people around him gave him a curious stare, shied away and said nothing. Two older men behind him sat chuckling at his ram­blings. 
Another day I saw a bum huddled for warmth beneath a palm tree near the boardwalk at Santa Monica It was a cool evening and a few raindrops had just started to fall. No one ap­proached him either. 
These two scenes dis­. turbed me. Here was the ;{)0»(_ 1J., .~A.~ side of the city that the 
'rQ br.ochures and billboards didn't tell about. Neither scene would ever rate a postcard. At the same time, I realized that all the sportscars, Gucci bags, and gold-handled toothbrushes in Southern California didn't stack up against episodes like these that were being ignored all over the city. After that realization, a glimpse at Ricardo Montalban's front door or johnny Carson's garbage cans seemed ir­relevant. 
On the way to San Diego, it took a full two hours to get far enough from L.A. to gain a real glimpse of the natural beauty of the region. The untouched land gave 
met an appreciation ofthe original vast potential ofthe area. And I wondered if a great deal of that potential hadn't been squandered. 
Several years ago I had the opportunity to visit North­ern California. I left San Francisco with the feeling that I had gained something in terms of historical and cul­tural value. When I left L.A., I felt I had spent, not gained, a vacation.

PeaceCorps 

Recruiter eyes future v~lunteers 
By GREGORY SWIERCZ 
StaffReporter 
Calling Notre Dame students 
"more idealistic and service­
oriented," a recruiter from the 
Peace Corps passed out literature 
yesterday and today in the Memorial 
Library, offering students overseas 
job opportunities. 
Clovia Sloan, a recruiter from the 
Chicago Peace Corps regional office, 
visited the campus to preview inter­
views scheduled for Nov. 16 and 17 
through the Placement Bureau. 
According to Sloan, Notre Dame students have better attitudes toward the Peace Corps than other campuses she has visited. 
"Ifpeople feel they have a sense of adventure and would be able to adapt to a different environment, then the Peace Corps is for them," Sloan said. 
She distributed Peace Corps ;;p­plications to Notre Dame students, a move Sloan said is required for seniors interested in entering the Peace Corps after graduation. 
"The application process is such that the interested persons must have their applications in our office nine months prior to entering the program," Sloan said. "This is why it is crucial that the (graduating) stu­dents get them in at this time." 
Peace Corps volunteers serve two years in a developing nation teach­ing their acquired skills to the people of the country. Volunteers receive a monthly allowance, an amount, according to Sloan, that "fits the actual wage ofthe task in the 


'Tylenol' suspect sought in Kentucky 
CHICAGO (AP)-A man with a history of mental disorders is being sought for questioning in the Tylenol murders, ami the police chief in a Kentucky town where the 35-year-old was last reported said yesterday that the trail is at least two days old. 

An all-points bulletin for Kevin). 'tasterson was issued :vtonday by the task force investigating the seven Chicago-area deaths caused by cyanide-spiked capsules of Extra­Strength Tylenol. The bulletin t(><:used attention on Murray, Ky., where authorities believed .\'laster­son was visiting friends. 
Hut Mmray Police ChicfJerry Lee said in a telephone interview that of­ficials "believe he's left the area. All indications are it was prior to yester· day." 
Lee said .\lasterson, who has not been charged with any crime or named in an arrest warrant, had previously "been spotted in this area." He added police have talked with "quite a few people," including one of Masterson's friends. 
Illinois Attorney General Tyrone Fahner, who is heading the task force, said Monday that "an inter­view with Masterson is essential" to the investigation ofthe seven deaths. in September. 
Masterson was described as 5­foot-1 0, 165 pounds with red hair and blue eyes. Authorities said he was driving a 1965 Volkswagen with Illinois license plates. 

particular country." The monthly al­lowance ranges from SIOO to S300 per month. In addition, a fund of S175 per month is set up and given to the volunteer when their two-year term expires. 
Since the Peace Corps began in 1960, over 82,000 Americans have served as volunteers. Originally a product of the John F. Kennedy ad­ministration, (under the direction of 
R. Sargent Shriver, Jr.), the Peace Corps has evolved into a program which had an operating budget of S105 million last year, a budget Sloan said doesn't seem to be af­
fected by the recent state of the economy. Sloan said University President Fr. Theodore Hesburgh has cooperated with the Peace Corps and has played 
an  active  part  in  various  training  
programs  for  volunteers  in  past  
years.  

Other noted past Peace Corps volunteers include South Bend Mayor Roger 0. Parent, Director of Admissions John T. Goldrick and several graduate students in the Biology department. 
Sloan said the future of the Peace for technology in the world. 
"The Peace Corps has left countries such as Chile, Korea and Columbia simply because they don't need us anymore," she said. "This summer we will be entering Haiti for the first time. We have plans to ex­pand the number of volunteers in countries from 6,200 to 10,000, but it doesn't seem likely that this will happen in the next five years." 
The Peace Corps receives "about 12,000 applications" per year for nearly 3,000 openings, and it con­siders "about three applicants for every position." 
Sloan said while applicants need a 
skill  to  qualify  for  a  position,  
"leadership  qualities  are  also  
valuable.,  

While the average age of Peace Corps volunteers is 27, most ofthem are college graduates, Sloan said. "They're the people with little com­mittments, families, marriages, and other things to tie them down," she said. 
Interested students can pick up literature from the Placement Bureau or contact the Peace Corps recruiting office in Chicago.

that Hesburgh probably will take a position. 
Neiman had much to say about Schell's book: "The book has mobilized a lot of people. It states a position that won't be to everybody's liking, but at the very least, it's gotten people to think." 
"There is a clear resistance to thinking about this (issue)," Neiman said. "It's not a pleasant thought. So far we have been satisfied with the vague rhetoric of politicians. The Schell book brings these issues home." 
Neiman added that people should spend more time thinking about the issue. He said people get wrapped up in grades, their love lives, stocks and bonds, and perhaps, spend five minutes a day, maybe even a week, thinking about the nuclear issue ­one that may someday make these other things irrelevant by ex-
The book raises more questions than it answers," Neiman added. "It's a good place to start, but I don't think it's a good place to end. The purpose ofthe book is served only if people go on from there." 
The book was introduced as a three-part supplement in The New Yorker. Subsequently, it was published into a best-seller in April I982. During the summer, a com­mittee within the College ofArts and Letters decided to form the program · following the publishing of the publication and Hesburgh's involve­ment in the nuclear issue. 
Schell's book is used in the Sopho­more Core course, and all core course students are required to at­tend the program. But the con­terence is open to anyone. and according to Neiman, "the questions arc so large that people who have not read the book will be able to relate."

Sex assaults onthe rise: Silvern1an 
By MOLLY KINNUCAN 
.\"eu·s .~tajf 
The myth that rape is an act of sexual fulfillment rather than aggres­sion and violence was one ofseveral misconceptions dispelled by the Director of the Sex Offense Staff of South Bend last evening in the Hayes-Healy Auditorium. 
Marsha Silverman's presentation concentrated on changing the public's perception of rape. Con­trarv to common belief, over one­hair' of all rapes occur in the home and are committed by . acquain­tances of the victim. Nearly all cases of rape are premeditated, although a specific victim is not always chosen. 
A rape occurs once every six minutes in the United States, accord­ing 10 Silverman. Sexual assault is also the fastest growing crime in America. According to Silvt'fman. "only .05 percent of the sex often-. tiers ever spend any time in prison." This percentage results from tht· rdativdy small number of victims reporting assaults. 
"Rapists usually don't return to the same victim." according to Slver­man. The need to report the occa­sion of rape is compounded by the fact that the assaulter tends to repeat the offense, each time destroying the lite of another innocent victim. 
A victim's "trust in people is com­pletely gone" as well is the "trust in her own judgement." 
In Order to provide the informa­tion necessary to avoid rape or any other sexual offense. and to offer support in the case ofa rape already having occurred, the S.O.S has es­tablished a volunteer training branch. Eight ses~ions arc designed to inform these volunteers about the legal, mt:dical. and criminal aspects of sexual oftt:nse. A 2-t-hour hot line for sexual assault of victims is also available. 
Silvc:rnun empha~ized that there is tine-line between what is and what is not a sexual offense. "\Ve're talking ahum rape -we have to get at the subtkties here." 
"The Legal Aspects of Rape" will be tile topic of tonight's program which will be held in Hayes-Healey. Sgt. Bonnie Werntz of the South Bend Police Department and Notre Dame Security Officer Anne Schel­lingt:r will be speaking. A self­defenst: clinic will be held in the gymna~tics room in the Rockne Memorial huilding tomorrow eve­ning.

Liberalarts education stressed 

By PAM RICHARDSON 
News Staff 
Agraduate ofSaint Mary's College 

discussed how a liberal arts educa­
tion at a women's college provided 
her with the broad knowledge that 
helped her succeed in the business 
world last evening in the Stapleton 
lounge at Saint Mary's. 
Barbara Hamel, a 1979 graduate with a B.B.A. in finance and a bac­helor's degree in history was the first speaker in the College to Career Days '82' program for students in­terested in a liberal arts career. Hamel is currently a financial ad­viser with the Continental Illionis National Bank and Trust Company. 
After a day oftalking to classes and attending luncheons, Hamel ended her visit with an informal discussion on her post-graduate year~ in Chicago, and the influence Sat11t' Mary's had on her career. 
When asked ifthe classes she took at Saint Mary's had any correlation to her job, Hamel described them as "ends to the means." She believed that the business courses were "tools" for her job and gave her a "working knowledge of what is going on in the business world." 
Hamel stcssed the importance ofa liberal arts education in the work field today. She claimed that "once you're out, you have to have a broad approach and you must be abk to conver_.,e about interesting things." She commented that about 60 per­cent of her peers do not have busi­ness degrees; many of them arc government, Englbh and history majors. 'This makes for a rounded person.

Insights outward 
Break came at the perfect time this year for this Domer. The South Bend weather had just made its annual decision to turn mean, I had missed some classes due to the onslaught of midsemester fatigue, and I was suffering a fit of depression from advancing Notre Dame shock syndrome. During the last week prior to 
Robert lloyd Snyder 
lhen Mid-Week 

break, the only thing that really mattered to me was tanking up the car with gas, grabbing a road map and my girlfriend's luggage, and the two of us heading in a meandering line for Texas and home. 
For me, the best place for serious thought and pondering is behind the wheel of an automobile which is travelling at a high velocity, with extremely amplified music providing a backbeat. I was serenely grateful for the opportunity to sort out some random thoughts that have been cluttering my mind since the beginning of the school year; in es­sence, my main activity while I was physically absent from Notre Dame was the considera­tion ofall the items that I could not weigh and judge while I was at Notre Dame. 
I thought about my commitment to my parents in my education and academic effort; I compared the campus environment with an­other university that I became acquainted with over break; I examined my deportment here at Notre Dame with my fellow class-· mates, my dorm mates, my girl friend, and my closest cohorts. 
What triggered all of these pensive sessions was a series ofeditorials and letters which ap­peared in The Observer during the two weeks previous to break concerning the basic nature of the Notre Dame student body. 
Several of the articles truly disturbed me. While I realize that many of the letters which criticized the "closedmindedness" of the Notre Dame student body were possibly out­bursts of pent up frustration, a few of these letters were as righteous and closedminded as the very system which they attacked. On the other hand, the minority who took an oppos­ing stance and argued the benefits of Notre Dame life failed to acknowledge the serious social and institutional problems at Notre Dame. 
I am not sure that I am qualified to offer advice to anyone on the subject. Alii can real­ly express is personal opinion as it relates to each side. 
To those people who are truly unhappy at Notre Dame, who write off the Notre Dame student body as being wholly composed of elitist preps who suffer from terminal al­coholism and genetically inbred sexual neuroses -I maintain that you have been expecting Notre Dame to solve your social problems rather than attempting to improve your social situation yourself. Only you can seek out those individuals with whom you share a common ground: they will not automatically come to you. Notre Dame is on­ly a contributing factor. 
To those individuals who actively con­tribute to the stereotype of Notre Dame as being a "closedminded" and anti-intellectual society through ridicule ofdifferent or artistic people, or through "clique" social behavior which shames the exclusiveness oflvy League Greeks, I almost wish you would just go away. 
Perhaps to be a bit constructive, I would advise tl_lat you open your closed little minds and look at the real world around Notre Dame. You are not the norm to which the world should conform, but merely a segment ofAmerican student acadamia which perhaps defies the whole purpose of "education." Ex­amine your statements concerning others who are unlike you and ask yourself if these statements are made out of ignorance or fear. Instead of anonymous slander, take respon­
sibility for your actions. Most of all, can we reconcile Catholicism with a life based on mindless prejudices and elitism? 
Finally, to those of us who have "semi­sorted out" the difficulties and daily problems of this place, and are fairly happy with both yourselves and your situation at Notre Dame -don't stop the process ofbettering yourself. Stagnation in life in any respect can lead to regression. Continue to be sensitive to others, to further your intellect, to become involved in campus activities. You have solved the riddle ofhappiness at Notre Dame, the answer to which must start with being happy with oneself.

ad Company is back with their first album in three years. Rough Diamonds is their follow-up to the mildly-successful Desolation Angels. OnAngels they had the anthem of'79 with "Rock and Roll Fantasy." Rough Diamonds is just as good ifnot supe· rior to its predecessor, except that it has no anthem single in the mold of"Bad Company," "Can't Get Enough," and "Good Lovin' Gone Bad". 
Two cuts, "Untie the Knot" and "Electric Land" are getting some local airplay, but whether it is enough to bring this album to wide public acclaim remains to be seen. 


Ed Konrady 
record review 

Bad Company started out in the mid-seventies as a hard-rock band with boogie and blues undertones. Vocalist and guitarist Paul Rodgers and drummer Simon Kirke came from the rock group Free, a British heavy blues band that rode to fame on the tense cutting edge of Rodgers and Kirke, a sound that was simple in conception but was remarkable in its inherently dramatic execution, helping Free to rise above much ofthe over-playing sixties rock competi­tion. 
Bassist Boz Burrell came from King Crimson where he replaced the original bassist, Greg Lake (who went on to Emerson, Lake and Palmer). King Crimson was run by Robert Fripp, and the lack ofin­put matched by the criticism ofhis replacing the critic-favorite Lake led him to Bad Company. 
Lead guitarist Mick Ralphs came from Mott the Hoople, where Ralphs had a voice in the group but was overshadowed by leader Ian Hunter. The influence Ralphs had was not evident until his leaving and the subsequent Mott albums, which drove the group into dis­solution, leaving Hunter free to follow a solo career. 
Unfortunately for the band, Bad Company was expected to be a new and improved version of Free. The group could not, ofcourse, live up to this expectation and have been generally abused by critics. 
RoughDiamonds starts out very well with "Electric Land", which features the howling ofRodgers' guitar and the coyote cry ofRalphs. The song opens in a piano rhythm by an unknown musician. It is strange that he or she isn't listed on the album liner since the piano and keyboards just about steal the show. This added layer really brings out the material presented. 
Rodgers' guitar playing on form, especially in the second song, "Untie the Knot". This song has been gathering some local attention and deservedly so. It opens with a great piano melody and flies into two furious guitar solos. Kirke's drums are incredibly powerful, with Boz Burrell's bass blending in well without beingoverpowering. It is a great piece ofboogie/blues/rock. 
"Kickdown" ends the first side, with Rodgers taking over the lead guitar lines and adding some soft deft touches to the vocals by ec· hoing guitar licks. 
The second side opens with "Ballad of the Band", a nice boogie number written by Burrell, that features some sharp Chuck Berry licks by Rodgers and good horn work. 
"Cross Country Boy" and more Ralphs lead guitar work follow. The guitar is more than adequate, but the piano steals the show, especially in a break with Ralphs guitar and Collins' horns. 
Asloppy song, "Old Mexico", features some nice bass work by Burrell, but it isn't enough to make this song interesting. Their is a fine line between defining a musical genre and wallowing in it. It is to Bad Company's credit that they tip toe over the line only once or twice on this album. 
"Downhill Ryder" features a simple but effective solo on guitar by Ralphs, and is saved from the folly of"Old Mexico" by a solid 'rhythm section performance. .: 
The album ends with "Racetrack", and it ends on a l)igh note. There is great drum work by Kirke, nice solid bass by Burrell, very well done keyboard work by some great unknown, and the usual RaJphs/Rodgers awesome job. 
All in all, the album is a solid job in the art ofmastering the genre of boogie/blues/rock, and certainly does say more about Bad Com­pany as a group than their past Top 40 singles. There are a few weak spotson the album, but the overall quality ofthe songs overcome it. It took them three years, and although it wasn't worth the wait, it is 
l

worth the price.

Between now and when the team heads back onto the courts in early January, Coach Petro plans to keep her squad in shape. "We'll be working mainly on conditioning, both mental and physical. The girls will have a light schedule with not very much time being spent on the court until after the winter break." 
The spring schedule for the women netters should prove to be more challenging than this fall's, be­cause they will be facing many tough Division I opponents. Coach Petro explained, "It should not be a problem to get up for these teams and to maintain some consistency." The coach is "looking forward" to the spring season when she hopes that the team, will be "much tougher and healthier." The women will start off the season with a tournament in Hilton Head, North Carolina during spring break. They will face such class teams as Virginia, Wake Forest, Miami ofOhio, and Louisville. Coach Petro defines this tournament and the whole spring schedule as "a tune up for nationals," and she added, "hopefully we'll make it."

Kuhn still on the job in New York 
NEW YORK (AP) -A sleepy­
eyed but undaunted Bowie Kuhn 
returned to his desk yesterday, dis­
appointed but not embittered that a 
minority of baseball owners denied 
extension of his contract as the 
game's commissioner. 
He will continue until Aug. 13, the 
expiration date of his second seven­
year contract, while an eight-man 
executive board seeks a successor. 
"Am I bitter?" the 6-foot-5 
onetime Wall Street attorney said, 
repeating a question. There was a 
long pause while he pondered the 
query. 
'"Bitterness' h a foreign word to 
me," he said. "'Rancor' and 'hatred'­
they're not in my vocabulary. Hurt? 
yes. And confused. When I know 
that 70 percent of-the owners sup­
ported me and knowing I have done 
a good job and baseball has made 
tremendous strides, I am naturally 
disappointed. 
"I regret, too, that I will not be 
able to be a part of the great gains 
that I have envisioned for the game." 
Kuhn was rejected by eight of the 26 clubs -the five decisive ones coming in the National League -at a meeting of owners Monday in Chicago. 
He caught a plane and flew back to 
New York through a storm to find 
his family greeting him in a party at­
mosphere. He arose at 5 a.m. yester­
day to meet live broadcast 
commitments with the three major ­
television networks. 
Returning to his 16th floor office 
in a New York skyscraper, he found 
the telephone ringing incessantly. 
He didn't duck anyone. 
Kuhn said he could have saved his 
job if he had been willing to placate 
the hard core of his detractors and 
agree to compromise the role of his 
office. 
"I could never do that," he in­
sisted. "I firmly believe that 
baseball's survival depends on a 
strong commissioner. I don't think 
the game can be run by a two­
headed monster as suggested. There 
is a place for someone to con­
centrate on business enterprises but 
only one commissioner. 
"The tougher the problems, the 
tougher should be the commis­
sioner."

Irish look for football upset 

Irish Items 

TO CATCH A THIEF -Dave Duerson has proven to be adept at taking a football, whether someone gives it to him or not. .md run­ning with it. With his three interceptions in last Saturday's :"'avy game, he tied a Notre Dame record for interceptions in a game. and he broke Tom Schoen's record for interception return vardage at the same time. Duerson n.:turned Saturday's interceptions 56 yards, giving him I 0 interception returns t()r 156 yards in his· career. Schoen returned I I for 116 yards. 
Duerson is also tied with Frank Carideo for the all-rime lead in the number ofpunts returned with 92. His return yardage of"'"''* yards is second only to Carideo's 947. 
CONFIDENCE STRENGTHENED -Navy continues to be a con­
fidence booster for the Irish offense. Blair Kiel threw ~..f passes with­out an interception breaking a ~8-year record for attempts without an interception. Kiel completed 18 of those passes for 220 yards ­just 5 yards shy ofhis personal best. Tony Hunter tied a personal best with his seven catches for 85 yards, and Oklahoma was left the only division 1-A. team yet to throw a touchdown pass. 
GOLD RUSH PANNING OUT -The Irish defense continues to figure highly in the current NCAA statistics. Notre Dame is now second in rushing defense, fifth in total defense, and tenth in scoring defense. 
Although no sacks were recorded Saturday in Giants' Stadium, the Irish pass rush forced six interceptions-just one short ofthe Notre Dame record set against Northwestern in 1971. 
On 5 7-of-1 01 possessions, Irish opponents have been unable to make a first down. Only 11 of these possessio.ns have resulted in drives ofover 50 yards -and 67 have produced drives of 20 yards or less. 
SPOILERS -Notre Dame sports teams have a reputation for beating the nations top-ranked teams. Just ask the basketball teams of San Francisco (when they had one), UCLA, Kentucky, and Virginia. Ask Southern Cal, Alabama, and Texas in football. Pitt has to realize that they can't sit on a ten-point spread and hope to defeat the Irish. 
PANTHER POWER-Dan Marino leads a high-powered Panther offense. He has connected on I 26-of-218 passes for 1411 yards, 11 touchdowns, and 18 interceptions. Marino may be one of the country's top quarterbacks, but his third-leading receiver is still his opponent. 
The Pitt defense is also highly rated. They are seventh in rushing defense, tenth in total defense, and fifth in scoring defense. Satur­day's game promises to be a defensive struggle. 
SO WHO NEEDS PERFECTION -MikeJohnston is the most con­sistent part of the Notre Dame offense. Although he had his first attempt of the-Navy game blocked, he came back to kick field goals of 40, and 48 yards. The 48-yarder was the longest of his career. Johnston has connected on 1 5-of-16 field goal attempts, and has con­verted on all 12 ofhis point-after attempts. He is now only three field goals short of Harry Oliver's record of 18 for a season. 
PANTHER STREAK -Pitt is coming off two consecutive 1 I-1 seasons and have won 40 of their last 43 games, and 23 of their last 24 home games. 
The Irish lead in the series 31-13-1. This is the first meeting be­tween the two teams since Notre Dame won in 1978 by a 26-1 7 margin. The last time the Irish traveled to Pitt Stadium they won 19-9 to open the 1977 National Championship season. Notre Dame boasts a 16-7 record in games played at Pitt Stadium. The Irish last loss to the Panthers was in 1976 by a 31-10 margin. 
STRENGTH IN NUMBERS -Not always the case. Early in the season the NCAA rated the Irish schedule as the third toughest in the nation based on their opponents' records last year. Currently Irish opponents have a combined record of 43-38-2. Four teams on the schedule have records under .500. Four teams are still rated in the Top-Twenty, three of these still left to play. SMU should try it, 
HALLOWEEN GAME RESCHEDULED -Notre Dame's unbeaten JV football team's Oct. 31 game with Cincinatti will be played at 1:30 
p.m. on Sunday, Nov. 14 on Cartier Field. 
RED SMITH WRITING SCHOLARSHIP-The Notre Dame Alumni Club of Northern NewJersey and the NewJersey Sports and Exposi­tion Authority made contributions to the new Red Smith S('holarship at Notre Dame, Smith's alma mater, it was announced during halftime of last Saturday's game. The award will go annually to an outstanding Communications student.
