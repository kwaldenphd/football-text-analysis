The first of 
many steps to 

equality ... 

My job as an R.A. entails much more than simply being on duty and enforc­ing university rules. I try to make each member of my section feel comfort­able with her living arrangement, encourage her to take advantage of the university's resources, and make the most of her talents. However, as much as I try to empower her, I cannot protect her from the negative attitudes about women which are prevelant at Notre Dame. 
The Alumni and Carroll Hall newsletters which were read at "Notre Dame Speaks Out About Women" and printed in The Observer on October 13, should outrage every person at this university. Amazingly, however, I've heard some students say they thought Alumni's "Top Ten Ways to Spot a ND or SMC Chick over Break" and Carroll's "Definition of Woman" were funny. Even Alumni and Carroll residents who were offended by these newsletters when they were distributed, but did nothing to prevent them from being read by other residents, are condoning these nega­tive attitudes about women. If these com­ments were of a racial nature and printed in residence halls, would you laugh and/or let them be distributed? This behavior-racially or sexually aimed-is not acceptable and can­not be tolerated by Notre Dame women and men. 
As an R.A., I have dealt with eating disor­ders and sexual harassment in my dorm. When Notre Dame or Saint Mary's women read that Alumni Hall residents recognize them at the beach because, "They are wear­ing a huge ND sweatshirt over their bikinis so as to cover their huge ass" and " They are the pale hideous fat chicks on the beach," how does that make these women feel when they are wearing a bathing suit? These negative attitudes and unreal physical expectations about women on campus defmitely contribute to the large number of eating disorders. 
Even more intolerable are statements such as " ... slap your leg and say: 'Here girl!' If she comes, kick her in the mouth and move on" and "(a woman is) the attachment that you screw in the bed, that does the housework," which encourage violent acts against women. These are often the attitudes ofperpetrators of domestic and sexual violence. Even if you still think these newsletters are funny and harmless, acceptance of these attitudes towards women are destructive. 
Unfortunately, the administration will prob­ably do nothing to punish or prevent these actions. Mraid of infringing upon first amendment rights, administrators will proba­bly not censor dorm newsletters. The admin­istration restricts our freedom by strictly enforcing parietals, for example, but will not prevent these libelous comments in dorm pubJjcations. Because the university ignores these actions which are harmful to half of the student body, the responsibility of changing these negative attitudes falls upon both men and women students. We must inform the authors of these statements that their behav­ior is unacceptable. Ending these attitudes is only the first of many steps in ensuring com­plete equality for every Notre Dame man and woman.

Five die in raids on militants 
CAIRO, Egypt 

Five suspected Islamic militants, including the alleged mastermind of a plot to kill Nobel Prize-winning writer Naguib Mahfouz, were killed in raids across Egypt, police said Sunday. 
An Interior Ministry statement said seven suspects were arrested in connection with the stabbing of Mahfouz on Friday. It said the attack was part of a campaign by the Islamic Group to destabilize Egypt. 
Four suspected radicals were shot dead Saturday night in southern Egypt, where police are battling extremists trying to topple the government and install Islamic rule. 
More than 430 people, mostly police and militants, have died in 2 1/2 years of violence. 
The alleged leader of the Mahfouz plot, Basem Mo­hammed Khalil Shaheen, was killed in a shootout with police Saturday night at a coffee shop in a Cairo suburb, the ministry said. 
Shaheen had been sentenced in absentia to three years in prison for the 1990 assassination of anti-extremist writer and secular thinker Farag Foda. 
The ministry statement said the man who allegedly knifed Mahfouz was wounded in the gun battle and ar­rested. A bystander was also wounded. 
The 83-year-old Mahfouz, winner of the 1988 Nobel Prize for literature, was stabbed in the neck several times Friday by a man he· thought wanted to shake hands. The assailant fled in a waiting Mercedes. 
The ministry said the attempt to kill Mahfouz was the second in two days. It said two members of Shaheen's group went to Mahfouz's house on Thursday to kill him, but he was not home. 
Two other assailants were arrested in Ain Shams and four other plotters seized in raids elsewhere in Cairo, the ministry said. 
Mahfouz underwent surgery, and doctors have pro­nounced him in good condition, considering his age. He suffers from diabetes and is nearly blind. 
No one has claim!3d responsibility for the attack. 
But radicals have criticized Mahfouz for favoring peace with Israel and for what they say are blasphemous depic­tions of religious prophets Jesus Christ and Mohammed in his 1959 novel "Children of Gebelawi." The book is banned in Egypt. 
Islamic radicals pronounced a death sentence on the writer in 1989, soon after British author Salman Rushdie was condemned to death by Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini for the book, "Satanic Verses." 
Bloated budget may gas Costner's film 
NEW YORK 

Kevin Costner is determined to 
com­plete the sci-fi adventure "Waterworld," despite its bloated bud­get. After four months of filming on Hawaii's Big Island and more than two months to go, the movie has cost more than $100 million, the Daily News Sunday. Costner's salary is $12 million to play a half-man, half-fish pitted against bad guy Dennis Hopper, the newspaper said. Costner's ocean-view bungalow with butler and chef costs $4,500-a-night. Food  steak and lobsters included -and lodging for the cast and crew of about 1,500 has cost more than $25 million, the newspaper said. Universal Pictures President Casey Silver, MCA President Sidney Sheinberg and other executives went to Hawaii for a crisis meeting. Sheinberg came away optimistic. "I really be­lieve this picture has enormous potential," he said. "Do I wish the movie had cost less? Of course!" At times, Cost­ner said, the movie ..has been a mess. I try to be honest and there is no point pretending this is a normal film."

Warrant issued for weary elephant 
NEW DELHI, India 

Forest officials in India's remote Andaman islands are hunting down a healthy male elephant because he rested from hauling logs on a road, blocking VIP traffic for hours. The elephant, Bir Bahadur, is hiding in the jun­gles. But jeeploads of officials are trying to execute a death warrant issued by an angered official whose vehicle was blocked. Bir Bahadur, who was employed by the Forest Department to haul logs, was found resting on a road through which a motorcade of the top local civilian administrator was to pass. He had lost interest in his work after forest officials replaced his trainer. No reason was immediately available why his trainer was changed. Mter several hours Bir Bahadur did leave the road, but by that time the enraged administrator, who was not identi­fied by name, issued orders that the elephant should be examined to determine if it had turned mad. In India ele­phants are a protected species, but they can be killed if experts certify that an elephant has turned rogue. 

70.000 Protest Immigration Measure 
LOS ANGELES 

Nearly 70,000 people waving signs and Mexican flags surrounded City Hall on Sunday to denounce a ballot mea­sure that would deny health care, schooling and other public services to illegal immigrants .. "We are Hispanic and all the people who are Hispanic .:·; are suffering," one male shouted. Signs included "Stop Immigrant Bashing Now" and "These Hands Pick Your Food." Voters will decide on Proposition 187 at the Nov. 8 election. Opponents say the measure is racist, mean-spirited and unconstitutional. Supporters say the proposal is about economics not race, and. that undocumented immigrants cost the state $2.4 billion a year. Recent polls show that the majority of Californians support the initiative. Police said the demonstration was largely peaceful. Many in the crowd opposed Republican Gov. Pete Wilson as much as the measure. Wilson is one of the main supporters of the initiative. From the stage, former state Supreme Court Justice Cruz Reynoso denounced the measure's require­ment that teachers and doctors turn in suspected illegal immigrants. "Are we a people to tell on one another in that fashion?" he said. "I say, 'No!"'

Christopher says U.S. won't wait next ti01e 
ByJIM ABRAMS 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
The United States will not wait to retaliate the next time Saddam Hussein sends his troops south to threaten Kuwait, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Sunday. 
The warning came a day after the U.N. Security Council unan­imously voted to demand that Iraq end all "hostile or provocative" actions against Kuwait. 
"The message is clear," President Clinton said Sunday. "Iraq must complete its with­drawal. It must not threaten its neighbors in the future." 
Christopher, speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press," also said it was improbable that Saddam can stay in power even if he complies with all the U.N. resolutions required to bring about a lifting of economic sanctions. 
Christopher emphasized that the United States has all the necessary authority it needs under existing U.N. resolutions to attack Iraqi forces moving toward the Kuwaiti border. 
"Next time, we'll probably not wait. We will take action, strong action against him," the secretary said. . 
Christopher's warning was echoed by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Madeleine Albright, who said the Mideast region is vital to U.S. national interests and the United States is pre­pared to go it alone to stop Iraqi aggression. 
The United States will work "multilaterally when we can, unilaterally when we must," she said on ABC's "This Week With David Brinkley." 
The administration's tough words on Iraq came amid open differences with Russia over the lifting of sanctions and how far 
U.N. resolutions go in authoriz­ing attacks on Iraqi troops. 
Russia reluctantly went along with the Security Council vote Saturday demanding Iraq with­draw its elite troops from the Kuwaiti border.

The combination of these three myths helped to reinforce the Irish's image that they were an oppressed class, ac­cording to Larkin. 
"What gave the myths their real power was their cumula­tive effect," he said. "The myths were so effective that even [William] Gladstone [four­time prime minister of the United Kingdom from 1868­1894] believed the myth that the treaty of 1801 was oppres­sive."

The frequency of heterosex­ual transmission of HIV is ap­proximately 9,000 cases per year, and is growing steadily, Curran said. Substance abuse remains "at the root" of trans­mission between heterosexuals, said Curran, citing that there 
are  1.2 million  active  in­

In  order  to  combat  the

Pope

There are also a frenzy of re­ports concerning possible suc­cessors to Pope John Paul II should the pontiff's sickness prove fatal. 
"You can be very sure the cardinal electors are thinking very much about who should succeed John Paul II," Fr. McBrien said in a Sept. 25 New York Times article. 
With cardinals at work at the Roman Curia, and more still in town for the Synod, McBrien said that the cardinals are like­ly to talk about what qualities they look for in a successor. 
"Even the conservative cardi­nals recognize ... that the next pope should be someone who is less divisive," he said. 
Pope John Paul II is a man who has "worn his convictions on his sleeve," McBrien contin­ued. 
"His pontificate has alienated large segments of the church," McBrien said, adding that the cardinals think that the next for the sexually active, and studies are being conducted on the efficacy of female condoms and spermicide for HIV preven­tion. 
Curran advocated sex educa­tion and condom use at a rea­sonable age, stating that "giv­ing teens and other people the skills to protect themselves does not condone sexual activ­ity." He said that in Switzer­land, the government has an active sex education and HIV prevention program, but the Swiss have not seen any rise in sexual activity in either boys or girls since its adoption. 
He also supported the fund­ing of more drug treatment programs, especially for IV cocaine users, and longer treatment to help them stop their drug use permanently. 
When asked what advice he

"The next pope," he said, "is not going to be a carbon copy of the present pope, but some­one who is going to be very different in personality." 
Some names which have come up are Carlo Mario Cardinal Martini, Archbishop of Milan and former rector at the Gregorian University in would specifically give Notre Dame students amid the AIDS epidemic, Curran immediately answered, "Students need to assess their risk and drug use, including alcohol abuse, hon­estly ... The higher the risk, the more susceptible they will be to acquiring HIV. 

"And students should not think of AIDS as a health prob­lem. not a moral problem or another person's problem. It is our problem, and the first re­action people should have to­wards those with AIDS is one of compassion, not denounce­ment.

McBrien believes Cardinal Martini to be, at the very least, somewhere on the list of possi­ble successors of anyone at the Vatican who is "in the know." While he makes no predictions, McBrien identified Cardinal Martini as a biblical scholar, moderate and highly respected.

JERUSALEM 
Israel agreed Sunday to re­sume talks with the Palestini­ans on extending autonomy in the occupied lands, after they were suspended last week over the kidnapping of an Israeli sol­dier by Islamic militants. 
A spokesman for Prime Min­ister Yitzhak Rabin said negoti­ations would resume in Cairo, Egypt, on Tuesday. PLO leader Yasser Arafat declined com­ment, but Palestinian sources said privately that their side would attend the talks. 
The Israeli Cabinet also re­opened the Gaza Strip, sealed off during the kidnapping crisis. But ministers emphasized they expected Arafat to continue with his crackdown against Hamas, the militant fundamen­talist group that captured the soldier. 
On another front in the Mideast peace talks, Rabin made an unannounced visit to Jordan on Sunday amid signs that Jordan and Israel were nearing a full-blown peace treaty. 
It was Rabin's third visit to the kingdom in two weeks and the fourth since July 25, when Jordan and Israel declared an end to the 46-year state of war between them. The talks also focused on water sharing and border disputes, Israel radio reported. 
Israel's talks with the Pales­tinians were suspended follow­ing the abduction of 19-year­old Nachshon Waxman, who was killed by his captors Friday night when Israeli commandos stormed their hideout near Jerusalem. A commando and three militants also died in the raid. 
Fallout from the raid was still felt Sunday in Gaza, where hundreds of Palestinian police blocked roads in central Gaza City to prevent riots, then joined Israeli soldiers in defus­ing protests by hundreds of Is­~amic militants near an isolated

Jewish settlement. 
Violence also was reported in the West Bank, where soldiers shot and killed a Palestinian, 22-year-old Emad Edabe, near Hebron after he refused orders to halt. The army said Edabe had appeared to be committing a theft. 
Under intense pressure from Rabin, who believed incorrectly that Waxman was being held in Palestinian-controlled Gaza, Arafat arrested 160 fundamen­talists in a two-day sweep last week. 
Arafat had been reluctant to crack down on Hamas since au­tonomy was established in Gaza and Jericho in May, because the movement has considerable support in the strip. 
On Sunday, Palestinian police with shields and helmets formed a human chain around the Gaza's central prison, where thousands of Islamic militants had rallied Saturday, threatening to "make Gaza burn" if their arrested col­leagues were not released. Some jailed fundamentalists began a hunger strike, Israel radio said. 
After the police blocked eight busloads of students from Is­lamic University on the south­ern outskirts of Gaza City, the students marched toward the tiny Jewish settlement of Net­zarim. Netzarim is one of sev­eral Jewish settlements which remain in the strip under Is­raeli army guard pending a fi­nal agreement on their status. 
The students threw stones at the Israeli soldiers guarding the settlement and at Palestinian police who formed a buffer between the two groups, a Palestinian officer at the scene said. 
Settlers said the rioters were armed. Israeli troops ordered the settlers to go home and called a helicopter to take a woman in labor to the hospital, Israel radio said. 
Several hours later, Pales­
tinian police persuaded the ri­
oters to disperse. Lt. Abu Mo­
hammed said there were no 
casualties.

FSU band on probation for hazing of 'gunkies' 
Associated Press 
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. Florida State has put its march­ing band on probation for three years for hazing its new mem­bers, known as"gunkies," by blindfolding them and forcing them into drinking alcohol. 
A faculty disciplinary commit­tee said the band, the Marching Chiefs, must sit out one football game if any members are caught hazing before the end of the 1997 season. 
Music professors began an investigation in September after a campus newspaper printed allegations of hazing. Campus police also were inves­tigating new reports of hazing from last week, spokesman Jack Handley said Monday. 
Fraternity members reported the band and videotaped band members leading blindfolded "gunkies" through exercises outside one of the music build­ings. 
Music professor Clifford Madsen, who headed the fac­ulty probe said the band also put pressure on new members to drink, even if they were un­derage. 
"Any implied or encouraged competitive drinking where there is peer reinforcement for drunkenness is life threaten­ing," he said. 
But band members said the "gunkies" were already full members of the band, and the incidents could not be hazing if there was no fear of them being rejected.

 RIGHT OR WRONG?  

Read the Catechism before becoming God 
On Sept. 27, a National Institutes of Health panel urged federal funding of non-therapeutic experimentation on "preimplantation embryos resulting from in vitro fertilization (IVF) or other sources" (p. 17). Private laboratories in the United States already perform such research. Some states and foreign countries regulate it and some foreign countries forbid it. 
Why is this panel report such a big deal? First, it is the initial step toward funding and supervision of the field by 
Charles Rice 


the federal government, possibly within a year. Second, the embryos are no less human beings than are their grand­mothers. Science confirms the 1970 admission by the California Medical Association of "the scientific fact, which everyone really knows, the human life begins at conception and is continuous whether intra-or extra-uterine until death." The living offspring of human parents, at every stage, has to be human. What else could he be? As Dr. 
C. Ward Kischer, professor of anatomy at the University of Arizona College of Medicine, noted in his statement to the NIH Panel, "All of development [from fertilization] is a continuum." After con· ception, i.e., fertilization, the mother provides only nourishment and protec­tion as the child grows. 
The Panel rejected this reality: "The preimplantation human embryo ... does not have the same moral status as infants and children ... because of the absence of developmental individua­tion ... , the lack of even the possibility of sentience [ability to feel pain] and most other qualities considered relevant to the moral status of persons, and the very high rate of natural morality at this stage" (p. 77). 
Once we cut loose from the reality that the one-cell zygote, as the late geneti­cist, Dr. Jerome Lejeune, of the University of Paris, put it, is already and thereafter "a tiny human being," any effort to define the beginning of his humanity at a later point will be essen­tially arbitrary. 
"The Panel agreed that, for public pol­icy purposes, a clear time limit should be set" on experiments. But its limit was a political compromise: "While the Panel finally agreed on the appearance of the primitive streak as ... a limit to research, ... the choice of this stage rep­resents a compromise among competing viewpoints" (p. 60). The "primitive streak" is "an advancing groove that develops along the midline of the embry­onic disc ... about 14 to 15 days after fer­tilization ... [It] establishes and reveals the embryo's head-tail and left-right ori­entations" (p.107). The panel stressed that at least prior to the time, "the preimplantation embryo cannot experi­ence pain, has no brain activity, and is not conscious or self-aware" (p.48). 
If "sentience," consciousness or self­awareness is the criterion for humanity, where does that leave the severely retarded infant and the vegetative octo­genarian? The Panel's definition of some human beings as outside the human family, "for public policy purpos­es," is exactly what the Nazis did to the Jews. 
The Panel itself indicated the provi­sional character of its 14-day limit: "[F]or the present, research involving human embryos should not be permitted beyond... l4 days" {p. 79). {Emphasis added). The Panel explicitly reserved for "additional review" the question of "Research [up to] the beginning of clo­sure of the neural tube [17 to 21 days)" (p.91). 
The Panel went beyond the Nazis by approving "the use of oocytes (female eggs) fertilized expressly for research" (p.56). At least in spirit, Dr. Frankenstein is alive and well in Washington. The Panel hopes that this will not result in assembly-line produc­tion of humans for research. It said that such created-for-research human beings should be used only where "necessary for ... a study ... of outstanding... value" (p.57). And "oocytes should not be fer­tilized for research purposes because of scarcity of embryos remaining from infertility procedures nor should they be fertilized just to have a ready supply of embryos at hand or for routine purposes such as toxicology studies" (p.57). If you bet on the enduring character of that limitation, let me take your money on the Chicago Cubs. 
The Panel also left open the possibility of funding experiments on embryos cre­ated from eggs harvested from aborted female children, i.e., of "oocytes from aborted fetuses," pending an exploration of "the ethical implications... by a

Genesis script, with man making himself God. And it is a replay of Nazi Germany.' 
national advisory body" (p.72). Female children in the womb already have all the eggs they will ever have. Do you want to bet that such a source of supply will remain untapped? 
With respect to research on embryos intended for transfer to a woman's womb, the Panel said: "It would ... be unacceptable to transfer ... embryos if it is reasonable to believe that children who could be born from these proce­dures may suffer harm as a result of the research" (p.80). If the child may have been injured by the research, the Panel thinks the researchers ought to destroy

him rather than allow him to be born. 
Ideas have consequences. The contra· 
ceptive ethic attempts to take the unitive 
aspect of sex without the procreative. 
IVF, the main source of "spare" 
embryos, is the reserve. In contracep­
tion, man makes himself the arbiter of 
whether and when life shall begin and of 
which lives are worth living. The NIH 
report does the same thing. 
The issue here is the dignity of the 
person. Pope John Paul's 1987 
Instruction on Bioethics stated that 
"From the time that the ovum is fertil­
l
ized, ... the life of a new human being [is begun] with his own growth. It would never be made human if it were not 
j
human already ... From the moment of conception ... his rights as a person must 
1
be recognized, among which in the first , 
place is the inviolable right of every 
innocent human being to life ... If the 
embryos are living, whether viable or 
not, they must be respected just like any 
other human person; experimentation 
on embryos which is not directly thera­
peutic is illicit [and] ... a crime against 
their dignity as human beings." (1,1; 1,4) 
See also the Catechism of the Catholic 
Church, No. 22. 
The Panel proposals are premised on 
a functional definition of the human per­
son. The eugenic State claims the right 
to decide who are human persons 
according to their ability to function, 
e.g., to experience pleasure.· If the 
youngest can be so excluded from the 
human family, so can those who, at the 
other end of life, are unable to experi­
ence pleasure sufficiently to satisfy the 
criteria of the State. This is a replay of 
the Genesis script, with man making 
himself God. And it is a replay of Nazi 
Germany. If you want to keep your 
focus here, read the Instruction on 
Bioethics and the Catechism. Share 
them with your theology professor. And 
pray for our country.

Although grottos, parietals, and rules against sex are not normal things in late twentieth century America, Notre Dame is, in many other ways, not that much different than other schools. Students everywhere write last minute papers, drink a lot of beer, and stay up until four in the morning talking about random things. There is a tension between being Notre Dame-like and being like the rest of the colleges in our country. I think that's the reason that you-faithful Observer reader that you are-keep hearing about abortion and homosexu­als. We feel like we're different from the rest of the country, and we want to know why (and how). 
Well, I'll give it a shot. I say that Notre Dame and other top Catholic schools are attempting to fashion a counter-elite. We Notre Dame students are supposed to be as smart as the kids from the Ivy League schools, as successful in our careers, and as athletic (no, better), and yet, we are supposed to be Catholic. This is supposed to make a difference. 
If you look at the admissions policies from all the top schools across the coun­try you will see a change in the past 20­30 years. The top lvys stopped admit­ting mainly cfi.ildren of alumni, and started admitting mostly on a base of native intelligence. Herrnstein and Murray, in an article in the Wall Street Journal entitled "Aristocracy of Intelligence," (October 10. 1994. p. A14), suggest that the new "elite" is more sta­ble than the old elite of money and friends, precisely because it draws from a larger number of people. It draws only the best. They say that under the old system (the old boys network), peo­ple rose and fell from high society be­cause there were lots of smart people not in the top schools, and lots of dumb guys who got in. Now, not only can the top schools draw from non-elite groups, but they can draw from ethnic mi­norities and women. The result, borne out by SAT data, is that the top college students are becoming smarter every year. 
Now consider the well-documented fact that smart boys tend to marry smart girls. Chances are good that you, being a Notre Dame student, will end up with an intelligent, college educated spouse. According to Herrnstein and Murray, scientific evidence also shows that intel­ligence is partially genetic. While this point is debatable, consider what hap­pens if they are right. 
Charl,es Roth 
have a self-propagating elite. Smart dad plus smart mom equals smart kid, who marries another smart kid, and has more smart kids. And they all go to the best schools and make the most money and have the most power. 
Herrnstein and Murray think that the inbreeding among the smartest in America will lead us away from democ­racy and equality; I think they are probably right. They ask their readers, "Who are your twelve closest friends? How many of them went to college?" It turns out that if you took a random sam­ple of Americans, the chance of half of them being college educated is about six in a thousand. i think I can fairly assume that you and I are both friends with mostly college-educated folks. Our friends affect our outlook on life. A class that mainly associates with itself loses touch with the rest of the country. That happens to us here at Notre Dame, and to the Ivy students, too. 
So consider the Ivy students who marry, and associate with, mainly smart people like themselves. They become an inbred and self-referential elite, sepa­rate from the rest of the nation. Look what happens if a politician loses re­election: he or she just gets a job work­ing for a think-tank in DC, or working as a lobbyist. It's one big flshbowl. one big connection of friends. The concerns of normal Americans get lost in the shuffie. 
It seems to me that politics usually work (especially, but not only, in a democracy) by the people selecting lead­ers from among competing elite groups. The Republicans and Democrats, for instance, are two sets of elite groups, each competing for power. How do they compete? They otTer us things we like, such as lower taxes and universal health care. Alternately, they agree or pretend to agree with our feelings about certain issues (e.g. the Republicans on abor­tion). When the group in power becomes complacent and loses touch, another party gains our support. Usually, it is the other main party; some­times, a new party rises up from noth­ingness. Maybe it will be Perot's party, or maybe some other group that we haven't yet heard of. That group will seem like a group of "the people," because they still associate with normal Americans and know how they feel. But that new group will end up with leaders who will become the elite of that group. I think it is inevitable. 
Enter Notre Dame students. We have been trained well (and I'm not talking about our ability to drink lots of beer). We can write well, and think clearly. 
We have a work ethic (I include all­nighters in that category). We can, sim­ply put, get the job done. But what job will we get done? If we go ofT to work in corporate America, whose corporation will we represent? As a law student, I come up against this all the time. Should, we represent the underprivi­leged? Should we represent the good guys? I would love to say yes, but first I have to find a job that lets me work for only the good and/or the poor. Good luck. 
So of course, we live in the real world, taking a job that pays enough to buy a house. Enough to feed the kids. enough to pay for vacation at Disney World. Is that enough for us? We are, I suppose. "American elites," by virtue of the money and resources that have been put into our education and our lives. If only on that account, we should live our lives with grander hopes in mind. But we are also, rumor has it, children of the Church. The responsibility imposed by our position as (supposedly) educated and intelligent people is made only high­er by our position as Christians. Our education and our faith should give us a perspective on life, and remind us not only of our duties, but of the billions who have lived on this earth before us, and those who will follow. 
It is not enough for us to be just kind, or just friendly, or just smart, or just decent. We are a counter-elite in this country. This means that not only should our personal lives be different. but we should hope to alter the social makeup of our country. It is up to us to help the poor, the abused, the aborted, the victims in society. If we aren't going to try to flx things, who will?

After bemgminhandled by BostOn-College l a week ago. Notre Dame was believed to be l on the road to recovery. But somewhere along the way the Irish missed the on-ramp. For the second straight week the Irish got beat in the trenches, this time dropping a 21­14 contest to the BYU Cougars at Notre Dame Stadium. 
Notre Dame hadn't lost consecutive games since falling to Penn State and Tennessee in 1991 and dropped out of the Top 25 for the first time since 1986, Lou Holtz's first year as coach. 
"We sure made some teams happy the last couple weeks," Holtz said. "Please don't ask me for answers. I don't have any." 
Notre Dame's mediocrity on the season remains a mystery left to the Monday morn­ing quarterbacks, but Saturday's loss can be attributed to the Irish's inability to score once inside the 20-yard line. Four times Notre Dame (4-3) got in the '!red zone," twice inside the ten, but came away with only a touch-

Irish waste opportunities 
By MIKE NORBUT 
Associate Spons Editor 

The difference in Notre Dame's loss to Brigham Young was not the inability of the defense to hold the Cougars to less than 21 points. A Western Athletic Conference team scoring such a low total happens about as often as the sun comes out in December in South Bend. 
Rather, the Irish offense can once again be blamed for this loss. Two straight weeks of being unable to put the ball in the end zone has led to two straight wins for their opponents. 
The Irish were inside the Cougars' 20­yard line on four different occassions. They scored only once. 
"Having success inside the 20 is a matter of toughness," Irish fullback Marc Edwards said. "We were just out-toughed today." 
Less than three minutes into the game, Notre Dame scored to put them up 7-0. They immediately pounced on a fumble on the ensuing kickoff at the Cougar 11.. 
Notre Dame drove the ball down to the BYU 3-yard line, but they were then pushed back to the Cougar 19. Stefan Schroffner then proceeded to push his field goal attempt wide right. 
"You have to score when you have the opportunity," Irish head coach Lou Holtz said. 
Schroffner missed another field goal besides his first quarter failure, and Scott Cengia had an attempt blocked in the third quarter. 
"We just didn't make any plays," Holtz continued. "We didn't make anything hap­pen." 
Either that, or the Cougars turned it up a notch when it was desperately needed. 
BYU sacked Powlus four times and had him on the run all day. The thorough beat­ing that the quarterback took forced him to leave the game with a slight concussion in the fourth quarter.

down. 

That was easily the difference in the game. BYU {6-1) scored on both of it's chances inside the 20, one being Jamal Willis 2-yard scoring run in the opening seconds of the fourth quarter which proved to be the game-winner. 
The pass-happy Cougars used the ground as effectively as the air. Willis fmished with 75 yards on 18 carries to go with 83 yards receiving. 
"We felt like we had to be able to run the ball," BYU coach LaVell Edwards said of his offense which totaled 104 yards rushing. 
Even more key than the Cougars offensive balance {John Walsh, 17 -of-30 for 216 yards passing) was BYU's front seven on defense. Notre Dame quarter­back Ron Powlus was sacked four times and took a number of big hits. The biggest came late in the fourth quarter which knocked the Irish signal-caller from the game. 
Powlus suffered a concussion and a deep bruise on his left shoulder. He looked dazed on the sidelines and watched as sophomore Tom Krug at­tempted to guide the Irish on a game­saving drive with 1:36 remaining. 
It was a chance gifted on the Irish by a Mark Atuaia fumble, the fifth of the game for the Cougars, in what looked like a reoccurring attempt to give the game back to the Irish. 
But without Powlus, Notre Dame's offense never got the chance to sputter inside the 20. Krug followed a 19-yard pass to tight end Oscar McBride and an 11-yard strike to Derrick Mayes with four straight incompletions. 
"We had the chances," Holtz said. "If we're going to be a marginal team, as 

The Observer/Mark Alexion Ron Powlus releases a pass just before being hit by a BYU defender. 
The Cougars also held Notre Dame to only 115 yards rushing. Sophomore Randy Kinder saw his streak of four consecutive 100-yard rushing games snapped with only an 86-yard performance. 
"They had far too much penetration," Holtz said. "You can't play with players on your side of the line." 
Holtz's experiment of changing around the offensive line payed immediate divi­dends, as the team scored on its first pos­session. 
But it was all downhill from there. The Irish were overpowered by a tougher BYU defensive line, one which had been much maligned, but turned in a big performance Saturday. 
"They did nothing different (on defense) than expected," Holtz said. "We just didn't have the consistency." 
But consistency is not the only answer. 
Playing tough goes hand-in-hand. in new positions. Only left tackle Hollywood, Fla.  
we are now, we've got to take advan­tage of the chances." Notre Dame's offensive woes were again based on the line. Only tackle Mike McGlinn started at the position he played last week and David Quist made his first career start. The experiment looked like a success on Notre Dame's opening drive, a 62 yard, six-play gem, capped by Randy Kinder's 41-yard scoring jaunt. The drive gave Kinder a jump on another 100-yard rushing day, but he finished with 82 yards on 21 attempts which ended a four-game run over the century mark. After a few stalled drives and bobbled snaps, the offensive line was shifted back to its original alignment in the sec­ ond quarter. The unit clicked in the at the BYU three, the Irish failed to gain closing minutes of the half when Powlus on two runs and Powlus was sacked on hit Mayes for a 13-yard touchdown, set third down.

So you want to go bowling? 
It's still a possibility, though in this year's bowl picture Notre Dame will be little more than a spare. 
The Irish (4-3) need only to win three more games to be guaranteed a spot in one of the four major New Year's Day bowls-the Orange, the Sugar, the Cotton or the Fiesta. 
Seven once seemed a laughably low number of wins to warrant an appearance in a big bowl. Now, it's a mark Notre Dame is scraping to reach. 
If both the bowl and school agree, the Irish could play in a major bowl with only six victories. 
But the way the Irish played Saturday, there are no guarantees. New Year's Day is still a ways away. 
POWLUS POPPED: Fretting for their son's health, Ron Powlus' par­ents huddled with team doctors out­side the Irish locker room after Saturday's game. 
They were assured that his injury, listed as a mild concussion, was not even serious enough to warrant a trip to the hospital. 
But it was serious enough to keep him on the bench for Notre Dame's final drive. 
Backup quarterback Tom Krug, playing the first significant minutes of his career, directed the Irish drive which stalled at midfield. 
CH-CH-CH CHANGES: Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz indicated all week that he would make wholesale per­sonnel changes and Saturday he proved it. 
Most altered was the offensive line, where four of the five starters were Mike McGlinn stayed where he start­ed last week. 

Dusty Zeigler, considered Notre Dame's best lineman, moved to cen­ter, while Ryan Leahy took over his vacated left guard spot. Jeremy Akers and David Quist started on the right side of the line. 
Holtz admitted that it would be risky to make the moves at this point in the season, but he also acknowl­edged that something had to be done to cure his team's woes. 
"We came close to not making (the changes)," Holtz said. "The main rea­son we made the changes was to get a little more movement and a little more strength." 
OSCAR'S OVATION: Oscar McBride became the first Irish tight end since the season-opener against Northwestern to make a reception. 
He caught a pair of passes Saturday, for 30 yards. 
His first catch brought a mock cheer from the Irish fans, many of whom often complain about Holtz's limited use of the tight end as a receiver. 
KINDER HINDERED: Irish running back Randy Kinder rushed for 82 yards Saturday, snapping his streak of four consecutive 100-yard games. 
Half of those yards came on a 41­yard touchdown run in the first quar­ter. 
Senior Lee Becton holds the Notre Dame record with seven straight games over the century mark. 
A KICK IN THE PANTS: Holtz told a luncheon audience Friday that the Irish received a verbal committment from one of the nation's hottest high school kicking prospects. 
NCAA rules forbid him from men­tioning the player's name, but it is believed to be Kevin Kopka of

When the Atlantic Coast Conference has that many teams ranked ahead of Notre Dame, it better be in basketball or lacrosse. 
And how about Purdue, ranked 28th, with twice as many points as the Irish in the current poll? 
Not since the end of the 1986 season-that's 85 regular-season games-has Notre Dame fallen this far. 
Ironically, it happened six years to the day after the Irish reclaimed their spot among col­lege football's elite with a celebrated 31-30 win over Miami on October 15, 1988. 
Those flne football forecasters at the Sporting News, who defied all logic and picked the Irish to be the national champs again in 1994, are probably schlepping Schweppes at 7 -Eleven by now. 
Beaten up by Boston College and bruised by Brigham Young, Notre Dame looked more like national chumps. 
Quarterback and punching bag Ron Powlus, the battered beneficiary of a broken offensive line, left Saturday's game counting the stars -­hovering around his head. 
His helmet hit the turf so often that he was forced to sit out Notre Dame's final drive be­cause of a mild concussion. 
He staggered off the field with the No. 3 on the front of his jersey pulled up around his shoulder pads, and loss No.3 imminent. 
It was a moment symbolic of the current state of the Notre Dame football team, a unit more dazed and confused than Robert Plant could ever be. 
They searched for solutions to the worst cri­sis in almost a decade. 
A week after their resolve had been so strong, Notre Dame's players and coaches sounded flat-out stumped. 
A week after being happy about the hurt, Irish coach Lou Holtz wished he could ease his players' pain. 
And eight years after falling this far, he didn't know the path back to the top. "Please don't ask me for answers," Irish coach Lou Holtz said. "I don't have any."

Poco A Poco 


Little things make every world go 'round 
A rooster crows at six o'clock-before the sun comes up. Before my alarm clock goes off. It is morning in Cuernavaca, Mexico and without fail Evelia has breakfast waiting. Nothing fancy. Fresh fruit-usually papia or mango-bread, coffee. Even at 7:30 
a.m. she is ready to talk. Do I think it will rain today? Did I finish my home­work? I am still half asleep so she doesn't push. She and I have lived together in the same house for six weeks-she cooks acitos, sopes, que­sidillas and other fabulous Mexican dishes; she makes sure I have hot water; she keeps the cockroaches to a mini­mum-and we are just now beginning to really know each other. Evelia, my "mama Mexican a," doesn't speak a word of English. And still she doesn't seem to notice that I have the Spanish comprehension of a three-year-old. She talks to me incessantly, and I try to hang on. 
My fellow Holy Cross Associates, Katie Bergin and Scott Curtis, and I have six weeks left in Cuernevaca where we are studying Spanish and preparing for two years of post-graduate service work in Chile. It has been a fascinating, albeit frustrating, experience watching our knowledge of Spanish grow during our time here. We have witnessed an evolu­tion from stuttering fragment-"! go now"-to basic, but at least more com­plete, sentences-"Generally, after school I return to my house to eat"-to the exhilarating escape from the present tense to the past and future. What a joy to be able to explain, "We didn't go to the store before lunch, but we are going to go after dinner," still stuttering of course. Some days it feels like we make tremendous progress. Usually we won­der if we will ever graduate from the first grade. But what has been even more fascinating has been watching our relationships grow-often in spite of this language barrier. How is it possible, we asked ourselves when we first got here, to reveal ourselves and our personalities to others if we can't speak freely and openly in a common language? How can we tell jokes and be witty? How can we show compassion? How will they know anything about us? How will we

ever make friends? 
Every day surprises me a little bit more. I think Evelia is one of the most animated, energetic women I have ever met. She loves to laugh. She loves to have fun. She loves to dance. And she cares very much for her family and those around her. I know all this although I usually don't know exactly what she is saying. I know this because of her expressions, because of her actions, and because she has taken me to several weddings and a discoteque. It is similar with the teachers at our lan­guage school. Carlos is a jokester, Pepe is a music-driven, free spirited romantic. Elivia is a surrogate mom with a real gift for calming her frantic students. Again, I know this more from their 
actions than any words they have ever spoken to me. I often wonder what they see when they look at us. Do they see a shy girl who is afraid of making mistake after mistake, or can they see past that? Is the person who my Notre Dame friends knew still visible? Can they see all my gifts as clearly as I see theirs? I can't be sure. In spite of these nagging questions, however, the fact remains that we have made contact with our teachers, classmates and families. Contact that brings with it some degree of comfort and hope. And still, I can't help but wonder how this fits in with the next two years of my life in Chile doing service work It all seems so far away. Surely none of us expected to come to Latin America to "save the world." Rather it seems we were driven by a very real decision to grapple with understanding-understanding of a dif­ferent culture and way of life, as well as understanding of poverty and the poor in our communities. And yet studying here can be a somewhat paralyzing experience. We signed on to do "ser­vice" and we have found ourselves in beautiful houses with beautiful families. We have hot water (usually), and we are served nourishing food three times a day. We have teachers and companions who make every attempt to throw us into the Mexican culture, who listen patiently no matter how long it takes us to complete a sentence. Everything and everyone around us is a gift, and as those who come before us promised, we have learned to say "gracias" earnestly and often. We walk downtown to visit the Cathedral or to exchange travelers' checks, and as in any city we cannot escape the poverty. We cannot avoid 
the barefoot children selling packs of gum in the street or the elderly men and women with their hand-made baskets and hand-painted ceramic goods selling for heartbreakingly low prices. 
The gulf between us is huge; more huge still because we have not yet learned to communicate well. Not only do we feel powerless to do anything, but we cannot begin to understand their sit­uation. We do not live among them. We do not know who they are. It is difficult to remember that learning Spanish is the first step to the complete experience. I am impatient. It is difficult to remem­ber that we are not really idle, and that this frustration is part of a beginning to understand. Each of us is anxious to get to Chile, to get settled in our community and get to work like the Associates in 
U.S. cities who have been struggling for about two months now in Adult Day Care Centers, in agencies for sexually and physically abused children, and other organizations. 
And all the while we are still prepar­ing. We are still learning Spanish. But in reality, what we are learning here in Cuernevaca is more than a language. We are learning the importance of the little things: of a smile, of an embrace, of a kind word-no matter how simple. We are in the beginning stages of our "relationship classes" where there are no tests, but hours and hours of home­work every day. The breakfast table is my classroom, and Evelia and the others are quite remarkable professors.

Dear Editor: 
This letter is in response to the crit­icisms thrown at Erin Kish's letter in regards to Mayo Angelou's visit. It seems as though this discord between the women of Saint Mary's and Erin Kish has become more than an issue about Mayo Angelou. 
As a male at Notre Dame my judg­ment is not clouded by the social ten­sion between the women of Saint Mary's and the women of Notre Dame. As far as I can see if the bit­terness between the two groups is escalating and not only divides the women involved, but the men also. 
The relationship seems to be extremely parasitic. We allow the 
Saint Mary's an inclusive community? 
Dear Editor: 
As a junior at Notre Dame, I was delighted to see the issue of ND/SMC student interaction addressed in Je~nifer Green and Lisa fortman's let­ter "Ignorance strains ND/SCMC rela­tions" (Thurs., Oct. 13). I appreciated the fallacies that were addressed regarding the Maya Angelou lecture, although I do not understand why a greater effort was not made by the Saint Mary's Student Activities Board in securing a large auditorium in the community, since "the event was a gift to the community." Who exactly is this "entire community"? And is Notre Dame a part of it? 
Green and Fortman deserve an 
apology for feeling as if comments 
directed in Erin Kish's letter were 
"malicious" and bitter. In your own 
words, "by drawing upon the unique 
qualities that each (ND and SMC) 
have to offer, all are able to learn and 
grow ... " Traditionally ND and SMC 
have coexisted within the Notre Dame women of Saint Mary's to attend our classes, partake in our entertainment activities, and experience the spirit of Notre Dame. I do realize that Saint Mary's pays the SUB fee, but money is not the issue here. 
The fact remains, that those who are attending Notre Dame deserve to be here because of intelligence, abili­ty, and effort, not because of money. Notre Dame continuously gives to Saint Mary's only to be shunned and neglected in consideration of attend­ing Angelou's visit. All we ask for is a little courtesy by making their tickets as available to us as we make ours available to them. We advertise and openly invite Saint Mary's students to 
···~ 
community, giving SMC students the chance to participate in Notre Dame events and vice versa. We should never forget that we have been given the unique opportunity of interacting between the schools. 
As far as the cost of the football tickets, well, I have no idea why they charge SMC students more. Maybe it' s because the administration feels sorry for us ND students who have to pay a ton more for tuition. But please don't blame the ND students for these complaints about inequality, because I think the Maya Angelou incident enjoy our University events. Is their thanks to us overt bitterness and ani­mosity as displayed in letters to Kish? 
She was simply curious as to the availability of these tickets and the response to her curiosity was filled with skepticism and defensiveness. My suggestion to the women of Saint Mary's is to look at Notre Dame with appreciation instead of contempt. Saint Mary's should enjoy what is given to them and try not to take Notre Dame's numerous opportuni­ties for granted.

clearly displayed that we are not equal, since priority for tickets was given to SMC students. 
Green and Fortman note that "friendship is not based upon the thing one gets in return." Nobody at Notre Dame was looking for a "return" with regard to the Maya Angelou lecture. We were just look­ing for a fair shot to participate in the SMC event. After all, aren't friend­ships supposed to be give and take?

Time to stop victimization 
Dear Editor: 
The recent assaults on Notre Dame students in the Northeast Neighborhood have once again highlighted potential dangers in our area. 
Our natural reaction is probably to turn our backs and avoid our neighborhood. We would like to suggest, however, that the Notre Dame community reach out and work towards edu­cating both the students and the neighborhood residents to prevent crime instead of becoming its victims. 
We would like to invite any interested stu­dents, faculty, and staff to a Northeast Neighborhood Public Safety Meeting. The assaults as well as other crime issues will be discussed. It will be held on tonight at 6 p.m. in 
.. 

the Northeast Neighborhood Center which is located at 803 N. Notre Dame Avenue. 
We look forward to working with members of both the Notre Dame and South Bend commu­nities to educate and to protect all individuals in the Northeast Neighborhood.

Hong Kong 
and the 
Hamburglar 
This is the "Leprechaun III" part to a three-part series. When I last left you, the iron princess, known as the USS Cleveland, was sailing towards Hong Kong, courtesy of NROTC. My mission, according to Pentagon offi­cials, was to find the creator of the short-lived sitcom "ALF, " who had been kid-AccemColumnist napped by a Chinese com­mercial fishing mob, and bring him back to his family. Much to the chagrin of the Navy, I could not locate him, but Hong Kong proved to be enthralling nonetheless. 
Ahoy! As the Steamin' Cleve pulled up to the pier, I waved at the natives. Standing on the pier were two little girls who held a banner that read, "Welcome to Hong Kong, Kris Kazlauskas. We hope you have a very good time here. Our country loves your newspaper columns. Viva Mishawaka!" I had to admit that the emotion of the situation was too much to handle, and I swooned. Regaining consciousness an hour later, I set foot on land along with several other midshipmen (i.e. Navy kids). 
The first thing that one must be aware of in Hong Kong is the exchange rate. At about 7.7 Hong Kong dollars to one U.S. dollar, the prices can appear frightening. Seeking a familiar face in this strange land, I happened upon a McDonald's. The ceramic Hamburglar in the window beckoned me, and not being a fan of Chinese food, I paid homage to this burger-steal­ing, fry guy-taunting, robble-robbling icon of Western civilization. I was with three other guys at the time, and must admit that I thought Hamburglar had robbed me when I paid sixty four dollars for three value meals and a small Coke. In the end, it turned out to be cheaper than in the states (I'll let you do the math.). 
However, bargains do not come without paying the price somewhere else. Being true advocates of the assembly line, this particular McDonald's even had a pickle-slice guy, and they cranked out hundreds of burgers in advance. What this meant was that my burger had been waiting for me before we even pulled into port. This time span is long enough for a Big Mac to not only get cold, but time enough for the meat to osmotically suck the life out of helpless lettuce shreds. The only part of the burger that withstood the test of time was the secret sauce, which doubled as an epoxy, enabling me to lift the entire burger by the top bun. For the curious, I should mention that ordering is not difficult because you simply point to what you want. I found that this was where my ability to mime came in handy. 
In addition to a strict, McDonald's Mcdiet, I found time for a little sightseeing too. This included trips to 7-11. As a coke addict, I fed my habit with Big Gulps. However, I had the misfor­tune of spilling a little bit of the liquid gold on the floor, and the store clerk, as if exorcising a demon, started screaming, "OUT! OUT!" Fearing a terrible martial arts display that would leave me bloody and bruised amidst a soy sauce dis­play, I ran out the door. 
The only time I veered away from the golden arches was when I ate at a restaurant called the Spaghetti House. This place was an attempt by Chinese people to create Italian food for English­speaking people. Centered in a country at­mosphere, this Chinese chuckwagon hoe-down featured servers who seemingly designed their uniforms by watching an episode of Hee-Haw. 
Entertained by a waiter with a name tag that said, "Hello, my name is HANDSOME," We ate pizza that was no thicker than a triscuit. I thanked Handsome for an enchanting evening, and vowed to stick with Grimace and friends. 
In retrospect, I did little more than eat while in Hong Kong, though I took pictures of the places where I ate. I brought back a plethora of wooden gifts for the family because they smelled like they came from the Orient, and I filled the little knapsack in my heart with oodles of memories. Looking back, I can truly say that the trip from San Diego to Hong Kong was not just a job, it was an adventure. 

Students share football with Best Buddies 
By THOMAS KANE 
Accent Writer 

Would having a "Buddy" to watch Saturdays disappointing loss to BYU with have made the game a little more bearable? Notre Dame senior Mike Shea certainly thinks so. 
Shea is one of ten students partici­pating in conjunction with the Logan ·Center in South Bend in the Best 
Buddies program. 
Started four years ago, the pro­gram matches up students from Notre Dame and St. Mary's with mentally or physically disabled individuals for "long standing" relationships, accord­ing to Kristin Garvey, Recreation and Leisure Coordinator at Loga~ Center. 
Each fall applications are accepted from the community for the Best Buddies program, one of four pro­grams sponsored by Logan Center , that attempts to integrate disabled people into society. 
About sixteen students end up par­ticipating in the program, which involves a year or more commitment to a client of Logan center. 
"[We're looking] for students who are in it for the long term. It's one of our more serious commitments ... hurt feelings are possible," said Anne Lagormarcino, volunteer coordinator at Logan. 
Besides an annual trip to a Notre Dame football game, the students and their Buddies participate in other group events such as bowling and dances 
However, what makes the program successful is the individual attention that each student provides to their counterpart from Logan. Each stu­dent calls or writes their Buddy at least once every week, and plans a get together at least twice a month. 
This may seem quite a re­sponsibility, but for those willing to make that commitment, the Best Buddies program can prove to be an invaluable experience for both par­ties. 
The program benefits the disabled individual. "Its good for their self esteem to develop a constant friend­ship. Often they know only a boss or a social worker," said Shea. 
"They like coming to Notre Dame. They like getting out and being with others and treated as equals," said Katy Gorman, a Notre Dame senior in the program. 
"They brag about it and tell their friends at work," said Lagormarcino. 
Besides breaking up the routine of the disabled individual and giving them a friend to talk to, the program also provides an invaluable experi­ence for the student "Buddy." 
''I've learned a lot about myself and people with [disabilities]." said Shea. 
"Students learn that they're more the same than different," said Lagormacino. 
/ 
The skills required to be a Buddy are the same as those for any friend­ship: patience, compassion and com­mitment-and maybe, most impor­tantly, initiative. 
Gorman, a senior in the American Studies Program, said getting the ini­tial relationship started was the hard­est part. 
"I was nervous. I wasn't sure what to expect," said Gorman. 
However, after the initial ice break­er of watching a basketball game in Gorman's dorm room, the friendship blossomed. 
These friendships are built, as they were with Logan Resident Elizabeth Wabol and her Buddy, through activi­ties such as visiting the grotto to "light candles," or going out to dinner and "baking cookies" -activities many students take for granted but can mean the world to these individu­als. 
Wabol's experience has made her wish that all her friends Logan had buddies. 
"My friend Kevin wants a buddy, but doesn't have one," said Wabol. 
"There are stacks of people waiting for buddies," commented Lagoramacino. 
Despite the challenges these rela­tionships present, students generally seem pleased with the experience. 
"I like feeling appreciated," said Gorman. Would these students recommend it to others? 
"Definitely.. .It is a great opportunity to learn about self. It has been the most outstanding experience I've had since I've been here," said Shea. 
More the same than different? 
Maybe Shea's Logan buddy Ricky Hawkins, who finds the expensive concession stand food and bicycling through game traffic slightly bother­some, captures best the true mean­ing of friendship. 
"I go out [to the games] because Mike doesn't like to go out there by himself," said Hawkins, ''I'm a Bears fan." 

Quilt records college's history 
By NORA MEANY Accent Writer 
The Saint Mary's College Community Quilt clearly reflects the Sesquicentennial theme, "Honoring Tradition, Pioneering Change," by borrowing from the age-old art of quilting. 
This craft is often associated with women's creativity and nurturing, as well as its community history where quilters came together to contribute to a larger whole, according to the Sesquicentennial Campaign for Saint Mary's College. 
"The Saint Mary's College Community Quilt is a permanent record not only of it's Sesquicentennial Celebration year, but it's thriving community of stu­dents, faculty, staff, alumnae, and friends." said Marcia Rickard, the Chair of the Sesquicentennial Quilt Exhibition Committee. 
The quilt, which is presently hang­ing on display at the Cushwa­Leighton Library, measures eight feet by ten feet, and consists of eighty panels. These panels were sewn by Saint Mary's Alumnae, as well as pre­sent students, faculty, administrators and friends of the college. 
The quilt symbolizes the many happy and spiritual memories that have made up the Saint Mary's Community for the past one hundred and fifty years. 
A bounded notebook holds letters from some of the contributors explaining the significance behind their panels. The squares vary in technique and design, but every square has one thing in common: each was created out of memories so dear and precious that they had to be preserved for all to see. 

"It contains memories of places and people, of yesterday and today," said Ricard. "It is a true reflection of com­munity." 
The quilt honors an institution which has influenced and continues to effect our lives in diverse ways. It shows fine patchwork and applique and less traditional techniques, all age groups and abilities, according to 
Photo Courtesy of Saint Maly's Sesquicenlllnnlal Cornrnla.e 
the Sesquicentennial Quilt Exhibition Committee. 
Volunteers, Ruth Pedevilla and Dorothy Quinlan, sewed the squares together to make the final master­piece. Although neither woman had attended Saint Mary's, both have had family members graduate, and are vigorously involved with the school. In addition, both also created a square for the quilt themselves. 
The presentation of the quilt coin­cided with the official announcement by Saint Mary's President William Hickey to launch the $30 million Sesquicentennial Campaign.

1994·95 Notre Dame Men's Basketball Schedule
Recruiting Revival Step 
November 

By JASON KELLY 
Associate Spons Editor 
There's no question about what has sparked the revival of interest in the Notre Dame men's basketball program. 
Inclusion next season in the Big East Conference has given long-suffering Irish fans hope for a resurgence. 
It has also attracted some top-flight recruits, players who probably would have shunned Notre Dame not long ago. 
A quartet of coveted high school heroes will join the Irish next season, players who turned down places like UCLA, Kansas and Syracuse to come to Notre Dame. 
Gary Bell, a 6-5 forward, Doug Gottlieb, a 6-1 point guard, 6-5 shooting guard Antoni Wyche and 6-11 center Phil Hickey each have verbally committed to Notre Dame. 
All are expected to make it official when the early-signing period begins next month. 
"It has been an entirely dif­ferent experience (since joining the Big East)," Irish coach John MacLeod said. "It has disarmed opposing recruiters who used to tell recruits that they shouldn't go to Notre Dame be­cause it's not in a conference." 
Shine 
continued from page 20 
Texas was a solid ranked team, but also because it will proba­bly put the Irish into the top ten, a long awaited and deserved arrival for the Irish 
The Irish traveled to College Station on Saturday night to hand Texas A&M their second Irish defeat of the season. Once again, as they did on September 16 at the Colorado Invitational, the Irish defeated the Aggies. The Irish complet­ed the victory in four games with scores of 15-10, 15-8, 12­15, and 15-10. 
Christy Peters again led the team with 20 kills and a sea­son-high 26 digs, but the Irish also received strong perfor­mances from sophomore Jenny Birkner and senior co-captain Nicole Coates. Birkner tied her season best with 17 kills and 10 digs, and Coates added eight kills and a strong defensive show with two solo blocks.

MILLER'S TIME: Sophomore 
forward Pete Miller, a walk-on 
as a freshman, has been 
awarded a scholarship. 
His gutsy play and long-range 
marksmanship made him a 
crowd favorite last year, as well · as a favorite of Irish coach John 
MacLeod. 
"He reminds me of a Jeff 
Hornacek (a guard for the 
NBA's Utah Jazz)." MacLeod 
said. "He's tough, mentally fo­
cused and he's an excellent 
competitor." 
The scholarship is a reward 
for Miller, who fought through 
some tough times as a rookie, 
even doubting whether he 
wanted to continue his basket­
ball career. 
"I wasn't used to being on the 
bench and the time committ­
ment was more than I ex­
pected," Miller said. "But bas­
ketball is really important to 
me and I didn't want to just let 
it go." 
FOREVER YOUNG: 
Sophomore big man Marcus 
Young legally changed his 
name from Marcus Hughes. 
A stress fracture in his foot 
kept him out of most of the pre­
season conditioning, but he has 
begun jogging recently. Young 
is expected to be available for 
full workouts by Nov. 1. 
continued from page 20 
well at the end of last season, but freshman Admore White fumbled the ball at times. 
Without a steady floor gen­eral, the Irish offense will sput­ter. 
"I think (Admore) will do a much better job handling the ball. He'll have a better feel, he'll see things better and un­derstand them better," MacLeod said. 
Still, problems seem to out­weigh the positives for Notre Dame. It's almost the same team-minus Monty Williams­that went 10-17 in 1994. 
But the Irish, to the man, be­lieve that this year will be dif­ferent. 
"We're fed up with losing," Gotsch said. "And we're not gonna take it anymore."

credit to the players and their talents." 
One of the biggest plays for the Irish was made by sopho­more goalkeeper Jen Renola, whose diving deflection of a MacMillan shot with just over five minutes remaining in the game helped to ice the win for the Irish. 
"That was the type of save we've expected from Jen since we recruited her," Petrucelli said. 
The Irish win broke an 18­game win streak by the Pilots at Merlo Field, which will be the site of this year's NCAA women's soccer Final Four. 
"If you would have asked me two weeks ago if we had peaked too early, I might had thought so," Petrucelli said. "But the way we played today shows that we haven't. I would have been happy to have more wins than losses against top-20 teams, but to be 6-0-1 says a lot about our players."

Team can improve on second 
By KATIE CRISHAM 
Associate Sports Editor 
It wasn't the best of times or the worst of times. 
Men's cross country coach Joe Piane wasn't particularly pleased with his team's fifth place finish at this weekend's prestigious Michigan Wolverine Interregional meet. But he did acknowledge that many positive things resulted from it. 
"I wasn't necessarily happy with the way we ran, and I think we could have done a bit better," said Piane. "Still, there were a lot of positive things that came out of it." 
"We ran in a much tigher pack and our top nine runners finished in the top 50, which was better than anyone else except Stanford," he said. "This meet really showed the amount of depth we possess." 
Senior John Cowan agreed with Piane's assessment of the Irish performance. 
"We didn't do terrible, but we can do a heck of a lot better and everyone knows it," he said. "As individuals, a few of us could have run better, although our sixth, seventh, eigth, and ninth runners ran real well." 
"A lot of positive things came out of the meet, and we're go­ing to treat it as a learning ex­perience," he said. 
Senior Nate Ruder was the top Irish finisher, placing 9th with a time of 25:13.0. Sophomore Matt Althoff placed 18th with a time of 25:30.3, while junior Joe Dunlop placed 24th with a time of 25:44.8. Cowan placed 26th with a time of 25:47.3, and classmate Shane DuBois placed 31st with a time of 25:52.9.

Disappointing's only way to describe it 
By RANDY WASINGER 
Sports Writer 

Going into yesterday's Wolverine Interregional in Ann Arbor. Michigan, Coach Connelly hoped for big things from his Notre Dame women's cross country squad. 
Instead of a big victory, how­ever, all he got was a big disap­pointment. 
"Yeah, I was definitely disap­pointed," said Coach Connelly. "We could have and should have run a lot better than we did." 
Although Sunday's field was very though, Coach Connelly felt that his team was better than their 5th place showing (150 points) out of the 12 teams. Michigan and Stanford placed first and second in the meet with 43 and 61 points respectively. 
"Two of the teams that l}eat us (Arizona and Washington) had their 5th runner way back," explained Connelly. "We had 5 kids running pretty close together, but we needed to be up there a lot farther." 
For the fourth straight meet this season, Notre Dame senior Kristi Kramer led the Irish attack. She finished 19th 
(18:21.1) individually. Following closely behind was fellow senior Maureen Kelly in 20th place (18:21.7). 
"Both Kramer and Kelly ran pretty solid again," said Coach Connelly. "We just need some­one to go out and take control for once." 
The other top runners for the Irish were sophomore Emily Hood in 36th (18:46.0), senior Sarah Riley in 38th (18:47.0), and junior Kristen Dudas in 40th place (18:51.2). 
The Irish now have plenty of time to try to get things turned around before their next big meet. The end of the season is quickly approaching. 
"We'll now be preparing for the district meet on November 11, using the M.C.C. (Midwestern Collegiate Conference) meet on October 29th basically as part of our training. Traditionally that meet hasn't been overly com­petitive." 
course was significantly shorter than the team's home course played a factor in the finishes. 
"This course was 8000 me­ters, and these guys are used to running on 10,000 meter cours­es," said Piane. "I think the shorter distance had a lot to do with the fact that lot of guys got passed up on the last few hun­dred meters." 
"It was a demanding course and a competitive field, and they ran well," he said. "They just needed to run better, and every man knows that they can run a bit better." 
According to Cowan, this week was just another step in the team's strengthening pro­cess. 
"We're alternating from win­ning and losing right now, but the important thing is that we're learning from every meet," he said. "And that's what's going to help us at the end of the year."

Irish get out of their hole with tie and win 
By THOMAS SCHLIDT Spons Writer 
Every once and a while, one can forget who they are and what they are capable of. This was the case for the (7-7-1) Notre Dame men's soccer team as they experienced some tough luck and losses during their stretch of conference matches the last couple of weeks. 
Yet, thanks in part to a record crowd of over 3,000 and the strong play of Dane Whitley, the Irish were able to recapture their winning style. 
On Friday the Irish battled the perennial soccer power and No. 10 SMU Mustangs to a 0-0 tie. With a return of confi­dence, the Irish preceded to pound (10-3-1) Bowling Green, yesterday, 3-1. 
With starting sweeper Kevin Adkisson suspended because of a red card, the game against the Mustangs marked the return of senior sweeper Dane Whitley to the starting line-up. Whitley, who started at sweep­er last year for the Irish, has been the back-up to Adkisson this year as the Irish switched to a 3-5-2 formation, which deleted Adkisson's stopper position. 


Whitley did not miss a beat as he, Brian Engesser and Chris Dean shut down the Mustang offense. 
"After a tough run," coach Mike Berticelli said. "to play the No. 10 team and shut them out, this was a good game. Whitley stepped up well." 
"It was good to get in there and play again," Whitley com­mented. 
He played well enough for the Irish to return to the 4-4-2 for­mation when they played Bowling Green, so to keep both Whitley and Adkisson on the field. Whitley remained at sweeper and Adkisson returned to the stopper position he played last year. 
Other changes were to put Chris Mathis up at forward with Tim Oates and then play Tont Richardson, Tony Capasso, Konstantin Koloskov and Jason Fox at midfield. Brian Engesser and Chris Dean remained at their defensive

"The bench really came threw and helped out," said coach Larry Patterson. 
The second goal was crossed by Eileen Newell to Tiffany Raczynski for the shot. Saint Mary's tied the score 2-2, which led them into overtime. Lisa Nichols passed the ball to freshman Debi Diemer for the point. However, the ball reflect­ed off the goalie's chest and Nichols returned the ball over the goalie's head down into the net for the winning point. 
" Kicking the winning goal was great feeling after playing the whole game and then going into overtime," said Nichols. 
"It was a perfect shot," said Matelski. "Lisa really played hard the whole game and it paid off for all of us in the end."

 MEN'S BASKETBAll 

Players need to step up 
By JASON KELLY 
Associate Sports Editor 
And so it begins again, this annual winter wade through the world of college basketball. 
There are 302 teams out there all playing for the same prize. And there are maybe a dozen or so with a legitimate chance to claim it. 
Notre Dame, alas, is not one of them. 
If not for a schedule that in­cludes three different Loyolas, two Ivy League teams, a Lehigh and an Iona, double-digit victo­ries might not have seemed possible. 
The Irish are knee deep in familiar problems, though their optimism emerged as usual Friday when they met the me­dia for the first time. 
"We should be in the top 25 or 30," guard Keith Kurowski offered without being asked. "Our schedule isn't as tough as it has been. I don't see any rea­son why we shouldn't." 

Here's one: Monty Williams is now a New York Knick. That's 22 points a game now on some­body else's scoreboard. 
"We obviously have to find a way to make up for the points Monty scored," fourth-year Irish coach John MacLeod said. ''I'd prefer to have a balanced team. My hope is that we can get five to seven guys involved and have the points distributed fairly." 
Kurowski and fellow sharp­shooter Ryan Hoover will have to carry a heavy scoring load, with help hopefully coming from inside players Matt Gotsch and Marcus Young.j 
Gotsch, a bony freshman, has beefed up a bit for his sopho­more year. Sometimes swal­lowing as much as 7,000 calo­ries a day, the 6-11 center has gained about 12 pounds and 70 pounds on his bench press. 
His development, along with Young, will be a key to Notre Dame's success-or lack ofit. 
With expected production on the perimeter, the Irish need to find some inside potential. 
"Outside of Gotsch, Young and (6-5 senior) Billy Taylor, we don't have any size," MacLeod said. "The freshman will have to step up." 
Pat Garrity, a 6-9 freshman forward may be the quickest to contribute. 
He looked eerily like one of the infamous Ross brothers in his No. 53 jersey, but he ap­parently plays like another­more celebrated-Irish alum. 
"He's a mini Monty Williams," Kurowski offered, again with­out being asked. 
Fellow rookies Brian Watkins and Derek Manner also will be needed contributors-ready or not. 
But perhaps the most impor­tant area of development for the Irish is at point guard. Senior Lamarr Justice played

The No. 2 Notre Dame women's soccer team took a huge step this weekend toward finishing their season undefeat­ed when they downed the last two ranked opponents on their schedule. 
On Friday, the Irish posted

 
their fifth consecutive shutout and their eighth of the season in a 1-0 win over No. 13 Washington. Yesterday, Notre Dame came back from an early 0-1 deficit to beat No. 11 Portland 2-1, giving the Irish a 13-0-1 mark on the season. 
Against the Huskies junior forward Rosella Guerrero scored the game's only goal at the 35:34 mark on a 22-yard chip over the head of Washington goalkeeper Tina Thompson. The goal was Guerrero's tenth of the season, a team high, and came in her first start since spraining her ankle in Notre Dame's tie with North Carolina two weeks ago. 

Against Portland, the Irish had to contend with a vocal home crowd of 3,857 as well as the return of Pilot All-American Shannon MacMillan, the nation's second leading scorer who had been recovering from a foot injury. 
The homefield seemed an advantage early in the game as Portland took the lead 1-0 at the 9:38 mark on a breakaway goal by Pilot forward Ann Milbrett. Millbrett's goal had the Irish trailing for the first time since their September 11 match with then No. 4 William & Mary. 
Notre Dame managed to tie the match before half, when sophomore Cindy Daws headed a restart from Michelle McCarthy which two-bounced into the net. 
The game remained dead­locked until late in the second half when senior co-captain Tiffany Thompson tagged an Irish corner kick from Holly Manthei past the outstretched arms of the Pilot goalkeeper at the 75:57 mark. 
"This is one of the proudest moments I've ever had with a team," Irish coach Chris Petrucelli said. "The way we came together as a team in such a hostile environment and came away with a victory is a

Notre Dame head volleyball coach Debbie Brown joined the Irish "Century" Club Friday night with her hundredth victo­ry as head coach of Notre Dame. The Irish defeated the 14th ranked Lady Longhorns of Texas in four games with scores of 16-14, 11-15, 15-11, and 15-10. 
The Irish were led by 6-0 freshman Angie Harris who broke her own record with 8 services aces in a game. Harris had previously broken the sin­gle-match service ace record in the Irish victory over Loyola Marymount earlier this season. 
Monday, October 17, 1994 
She also contributed 19 kills and 17 digs to the victory. 
"Angie's serving was the key to the match," said Coach Brown. 
"She put a lot of pressure on Texas even when she didn't get the ace." 
All-American outside hitter Christy Peters topped the kill and dig column for the Irish with 22 kills and 19 digs. Junior setter Shannon Tuttle added 58 assists to her make her grand total 7 46 so far this season.
