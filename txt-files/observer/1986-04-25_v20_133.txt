11 Saint Mary's students in Rome come back early 
By T~IPP BALTZ and ROB HENNIG 
NewsSttiff 
Some students in the Saint Mary's Rome program have come home early, according to Assistant Professor Peter Checca, campus director of the program. 
"The students . . . have been given the option (that) if they want to come home, they can come home," Checca said. 
II students flew into New York Wednesday and 50 are remaining in Rome, according to Portia Spanu, director of the program. Checca said the program "will continue as scheduled." The semester will end for the program on May 9. 
Checca said he called the parents of the students to tell them the policy the College is adopting on the students' return. This policy was made in consultation with Ac­ting Vice President Dorothy Feigl and Spanu. 
Feigl said the College "is not recommending they come home." 
She said she conveyed this message to parents. 
"We want the parents to make the decision on their own best judg­ment," Feigl said. 
The College "would not do anything to make it difficult for returning students," Feigl added. She said Spanu will be meeting with the instructors to get exams and other materials so the students who have returned will be able to make up classes. "My expectations are 
that students who are close will pro­bably be administered their exams here, while those who are away will take theirs under proctors in their area," Feigl said. No decision has been made yet on how the returning students will complete final work in their classes. 
"These students will get credit (for their classes)," she added. 
Feigl said parents of the students watched news broadcasts of the developments in Libya and Europe over the last few weeks and became

SMC Board of Regents approves divestment plans 
By ELLYN MASTAKO 
Senior Staff Reporter 
The Board of Regents of Saint Mary's College, at its meeting on April 19, approved an investment policy which incorporates a section on ethical and social responsibility for security ownership. 
The issue of divestment was brought before the Board as a result of a petition calling for the College to divest, signed by more than I)()() students last week, and a vote by the faculty assembly to recommend that the College divest. In addition, the Board approved a policy st~tement on investment in South Africa which is the first for­
mal  statement  by  Saint  Mary's  
regarding  the  issue  of  South  
African investments.  

Although Saint Mary's endowment is currently listed to be $20 million, only a relatively small portion of that endowment is involved in these South African companies, accor­ding to reports. 
Saint Mary's College President William Hickey said, "The issue of apartheid is complex and com­mands our attention. Apartheid is an unjust system which brutally op­presses non-white peoples and disenfrachises the majority of peo­ple in South Africa. Good and 
Hurley comes back to visit ND 
By BETH CORNWELL 
Sttiff reporter 
Kevin Hurley, the Notre Dame student who was injured by a hit-and-run driver while crossing U.S. 31-33 last September 7, will be arriving with his parents this afternoon to spend An Tostal weekend at Notre Dame. 
Since last December, Hurley has been undergoing rehabilita­tion at the Greenery Center in Massachusetts. 
The Hurley family will arrive at Michiana Regional Airport at 2;37 p.m. according to senior Bill Healy. 
While serving as Student Body President, Healy organiz­ed that student support of Hurley's convalescence. "We'd really like it if we could get a lot of student out to meet the plane. It would be great to pump Kevin up for his visit like that," Healy said. 
According to Kevin's father, 

Richard Hurley, the family has been hoping to make the trip for several months, but only finaliz­ed their plans two weeks ago. "We had no idea that this weekend was a special one for the University. We just wanted to see some folks, and we knew 

Kevin Hurley 

that there were a lot of folks who wanted to see Kevin," Richard Hurley said. 
The weekend will be largely unstructured, according to Richard Hurley. "We have to play it by ear, see what Kevin's up for. We want him to talk with Dr. (Emil) Hofman, (Vice­President for Student Affiars) Father (David) Tyson, (Rector of Howard Hall) Father (Gene) Gorski, and Bill Healy. Mostly, we just want to psych him up even more that he already is. You know, he just got his tem­porary prosthesis yesterday. Yesterday he took one step and today he took a couple more. We're not bringing it with us, though. For now, that's just for therapy." 
According to Healy, the big­gest event planned for the visit will be a Mass in Sacred Heart Church on Sunday at 4:00. 
"The Mass honoring Kevin is really the biggest deal that we've got planned. We're also hoping that, pending on his physical condition, we can have him at­tend the Blue-Gold game pep rally. He might be kind of over­whelmed by all the people, but it would be great if we could just get him down on the sidelines to see all the action," Healy said.

South Africa repeals 'influx control' laws 
Al80dated Press 

Johannesburg, South Africa 
President P.W. Botha said yester­
day that lifting pass laws for blacks 
means "a new era of freedom" for 
this troubled land, but critics claim 
a tough new security law undercuts 
the reform. 

On Wednesday the white govern­
ment suspended enforcement of 
laws restricting the movements of 
blacks and introduced legislation to 
repeal them, but also proposed giv­
ing police greater powers in . designated unrest areas. 
Leaders of the United Democratic Front, the coalition against apartheid, said the propos­"e9 security law will give the law and ~order minister "almost dictatorial powers" and urged blacks to form 
self-defense committees. 
Botha said in a full-page adver­
tisement published in several major newspapers that his government :had confounded its detractors by 
delivering on a pledge to abolish 
the pass laws. 
The hated regulations, officially called influx control, have been cornerstones of apartheid. They severely restrict where blacks can travel, live and work. 
Botha's new policy will allow blacks to live wherever they can find an approved site, but residen­tial areas still will be segregated. 
'Rural blacks still may not be able to move to the cities because little housing is available in urban black areas . 
"The pass laws have gone," Botha said. "The prisons are emp­tied of the victims of this unhappy system. No South African will ever suffer the indignity of arrest for a pass offense aga:in. 
"The new South Africa will be a land where all decent people can

 Proponents of random-selection stress that their system is fairer. They say that a GPA selection puts undue emphasis on grades. As if the pressures here to perform well academically weren't as great as it is, they add, the added pressure of having one's room tied to one's grades just doesn't give everyone a fair shake.

fairness in GP A selection comes off as a punishment for those who can't cut it. GP A proponents stress that a room pick should be thought of as a reward, and thus, a good room is one more incentive to achieve good 
grades. 
One thing is sure: whatever system is employed should be approved by the dorm on a regular basis. Living in Grace Hall for three years, I believe in the system of GPA selection. The last two years the dorm residents voted overwhelmingly to continue its pre­sent policy. This year, however, Grace Hall neglected to vote on the issue. 
Hopefully, other dorms will reconsider their own policies periodically. The particular selection process should reflect the opinion of the residents of the hall; traditions should not be forced upon anyone .

RASTA plans benefit week of cultural enlightenment 
By MARA SMITH 
News Staff 
A Reggae concert will highlight a week-long series of events spon­sored by RASTA, Rally Against Starvation, to increase awareness of the ongoing hunger crisis in many African countries, according to RAST A president Cathyanne Reynolds. 
RAST A encourages "internaliza­tion" of African issues rather than mere "sympathy" for the victims, according to Reynolds. 
"I think that RAST A is trying to achieve an impact on the local com­munity which internalizes the issues of Africa and the crisis rather than just symphathize with the African people," she said. 
In sponsoring culture-related events, RAST A attempts to both increase the local community's ap­preciation of the African culture and raise money to aid the African people in their struggle with famine. 
"The easiest way to internalize things is to take part," Reynolds said. 
Highlighting this coming week's events is a Reggae concert schedul­ed for Saturday, May 3, from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. at Stepan Center. 

The Ethiopian Reggae group Dallol will head the performance and will be joined by the Pat Giblin Band and the Bulldogs Blues Band. 
Tickets are $5 and will be on sale at the dining halls and at the other RAST A sponsored events, accor­ding to Kevin Ledley, producer of the concert. 
Dallol recently released an album called "Land of Genesis." The album was produced by Rita Marley, the widow of Reggae per­former Bob Marley. 
RAST A organizes the concert annually to give the local communi­ty a sense of the African spirit por­trayed in the lyrics of Reggae music. 
According to Ledley, RAST A is concerned with the preservation of the African culture as well as the 
current famine.  
-~<It's  more  than  a  hunger  pro­ 
blem,"  said  Ledley.  "There  is  a  
culture we are trying to save."  

In addition to the concert, other events will take place this weekend, starting at 8 p.m. tonight at Lee's Ribs with an all you can drink special for $4. 
Monday's events will include "Rasta Java," which will take place

Under the CODEL program, money from the RAST A proceeds will go towards researching and implementing a development pro­gram for an African community, giving the Notre Dame/Saint Mary':; community the opportunity to see the results of its efforts. 
This program also allows the local community to be involved with the African community for more than just one week.

concerned for their children. She 
said the parents called them and the 
College "to ask what was happen­
ing." 
"The operations on (the Rome) 
campus are going on as you would 
expect it," Feigl added. In addition 
to the regular functioning of the 
Saint Mary's program, Feigl said 
programs of other schools are also 
remaining, although some students 
are choosing to return. 
"There are 40 American universi­
ty programs in Italy, and not one of 
them has found the situation too 
difficult to move out," said Spanu. 
"If the students were to be in any 
danger, we would, of course, close 
down the program," Checca added. 
None of the Notre Dame foreign 
study programs in Europe and the 
Middle East are returning or giving 
their students the option to return, 
according to Assistant Provost 
Isabel Charles, director of the 
University's programs. "Our own 
are not returning at this point," 
she said. However, a field trip to 
Sicily for the Rome Architecture 
Program was cancelled, according 
to Alice Wesoloski, administrative 
assistant at the Architecture 
Department. 
"We've heard of no problems at 
all," Charles said. She added that 
the directors of the programs in 
Cairo and Jerusalem have said the 
situations there are "very peaceful." 
"There is some anti-American 
sentiment," she said, but added, 
·~the directors have counseled the 
s,tudents not to travel to the main

They make a commitment for the businesses to: 
Use. their influence and support the unrestricted rights of black businesses to locate in the urban areas of the nation. 
Influence other companies in South Africa to follow the stan­dards of equal rights principles. 
Support the freedom of mobility of black ,workers to seek employ­ment opportunities wherever they 
exist.  
Support  the  rescission  of  all  
apartheid laws.  
The policy  continues,  "No  in­ 

vestments in the common stock debt securities of any financial in­stitution currently making loans to the government of South Africa will be purchased. None are presently held in the fund." 
The third part of the new invest­ment policy states that, "For the present, the College will continue to hold securities of signatories of the amplified Sullivan Principles so that the College may show support for those companies that are trying to improve conditions in South Africa. The Regents will continue to monitor these companies for j>erformance." 
According_ t(\ Hickey, "Following many hours ot deliberation and debate, the Regents approved the new policy! In arriving at this posi­
tion, the Regents emphasized the 
need to conduct a continued review 
of the College's policy on invest­
ment in South Africa." 
Peacemakers, a campus group 
dedicated to addressing issues of 
social injustice, was a major force 
behin'd both the petition and facul­
ty resolution. 
"My personal reaction to the new 
policy is that I'm very grateful that 
Saint Mary's has taken a first step," 
said Sister Mary Turgi, a member 
of Peacemakers. 
"The major difference of opinion with the Board of Regents' decision is whether or not the Sullivan Prin­ciples hold true. One can have quite a good rating on the Sullivan Prin­ciples and still be supporting the present government in South Africa," she said. 
In addition to Saint Mary's in­vestments, the Sisters of the Holy ·cross also have investments in companies doing business in South Africa. They, too, have recently formulated a Policy of divestment. 
Sister Francis Bernard, Superior General of the order, said, "The Sisters of the Holy Cross, after study and research of the South African situation in light of our own mission and philosophy, are taking immediate steps to remove from our investment portfolios those corporations which have holdings in South Africa. All Holy Cross sponsored institutions are en­couraged to take similar action."

The proceeds will be forwarded to Northeast Neighborhood Coun­cil, Inc., said Schweninger. 
This non-profit organization helps those who are needy but are not eligible for help from govern­ment programs, that is, "those who have fallen through the cracks," said Arthur Quigley, professor of engineering and president of the council. 
The organization runs a nutrition center, does income tx forms, gives food to the poor, helps pay utility bills, repairs houses, runs special 
prograllls,  and  generally  does  
"anything  that  helps  the  
neighborhood," said Quigley.  

The organization, which serves the northeast part of South Bend and a part of Mishawaka, last year operated with funds of $44,000 for about. 400 families and employed "only one-half of a staff person," according to Quigley. 
Since the organization recently lost its state funding, "we scratch along with what we get from chur­ches and things like the Grace Hall run," Quigley said. 
Motives for participation in the run are equally divided between a desire to help charity and a desire to increase hall spirit, said Mike Mara, a Grace resident. 
''We're trying to make this a Grace Hall tradition," said Schwen­inger. This is the second year the run has been a hall-wide event, hav­ing started as a one-section event, he said.

"And it will come about. Not because I say so, but because my government and I have the power to make it happen." 
Black leaders welcomed aboli­tion of the pass laws, but said the governmenl has not indicated it will address their demand for a share of political power. The apartheid race policy has maintained supremacy for South Africa's 5 million whites aw:l denied rights to the 24 million blacks for generations. 
Murpl!y~Morobe, spokesman for the United Democratic Front, said those praising the initiative "must remember that these repealed laws have already broken up families, led to the deaths of thousands of 
\)1acks and  cost  untold misery  to  
millions  of  disenfranchised  
Africans."

"Is there room for homosex­uals ? Two student mamagers resigned their jobs in campus radio, in protest over the censorship of homosexuals." 
I said: "Isn't there a confusion here between minority rights and minority politics?"

"It would be a sin against God to treat anyone unfairly, especially homosexuals,"I said. "That doesn't mean the University is presently prepared to deal with the politics. of a liberation movement which treats sexual freedom as though it were not a problem to the Christian

"Another student told me the

home, he had a sexual encounter. 
He phoned later to say he found 
nothing beautiful in something he 
was ashamed of." 
"I'm still a virgin," he said. "I'm looking forward to sex as a holy act." 
"Novelists often praise the first fien rapture of love's awakening," I said. "One doesn't have to be Dr. Ruth to be sympathetic. The movies make an artform of the sexual initi­tion. Old men on their death beds are said to murmur the names of their early loves like a prayer of thanksgiving. Only a blue nose would want to deny the poetry of lifes turning points." 
He seemed surprised to find me so liberal. 
I went on: "A thing of beauty is a joy ... until you discover the price you have to pay for it. Where is the poetry in the high school students who did know the gun was load­ed? True poetry doesn't leave you with a sour taste in your mouth, feeling cheap and betrayed. The holiness !eves off where the pain begins." 
He felt I was sermonizing, and so I lost him. What would I know anyway? I am only a priest who furnishes Kleenex for wet eyes. 
More important tha the land­marks at Notre Dame is the love that is passed down from genera­tion to generation. Love is here like the presence of God whom you cannot see. I can only prove love by continuing the arguments I seem to lose all the time. ·

'The Way of the 



Cross' enthusiastic 
FRAN NORTON 
Senior.StQ/1 Writer 
Last night in Washington Hall, the Notre 
Dame Department of Communications and 
theatre presented "The Way of The Cross," 
an adaption of the Stations of the Cross ac­
cording to the Gospel of Mark. For once, 
this reviewer is at a loss for words. 
At its best, this bold production pushed 
the audience into an expressionistic vision of 
the Stations of the Cross. At the very least, it 
is a superlative example of just what theatre 
cando. 
From the very start, it was evident that this ,production COlJid not be contained by the standard "fourth wall." Not only is the au­dienee surrounded by the play, it is swept along by the pace of the production and by 
.the constant movement of the actors. 
No one actor , or even part of the play, can actually stand out from the rest. Acting, music, lighting, and choreography meld together to form one unified whole. It is an experience that cannot be described. 
It is the experience and emotions of the Stations that are presented, rather than a purely doctrinal account. No one actor is Christ. His presence is created by employing several different actors, male and female, and a fixed symbol that is associated with Him. after only a few scenes, the symbol itself is powerful enough to stand alone as Christ. 
This performance could aptly be described as performed by Bain Productions, Ltd. The adaptation and lyrics are by Georgia Weber Bain and Reginald F. '3ain, Sr. It is directed by Reginald F. Bain, Jr. Among the or­chestra members are Laura M. Bain and Sharon L. Bain. It was Choreograped by Tom Barkes Bain, with Anne Marie Borgman Bain as the Production Stage Manager. 
It is impossible to pigeon-hole this produc­tion into any one category. It seems to simultaneously contain many different styles. Action changes from drama to ballet. 

Music may start as opera, and then careen into a wail of acid rock. At one moment the entire Hall is brightly illuminated, ath the next ci~ outlines of characters move acrou the stage. It is a stage production in the fullest sense of the term. 

Theater 
The Way of the Cross 

Perhaps the only fault of this production is its timing. Forcing a play to run during An Tostal is like staging a poetry recital during a home football game. Fortunately, low atten­dance did not dampen the enthusiasm of the performers. The show runs through Satur­day night. Hopefully, more people will come to this unique production.

Under a bright full moon, a low bass beat echoed in the cold evening on the Notre Dame campus. 
Out of the depths of construction-torn LaFortune Student Center they emerged. Nine members strong, the little company dressed in white began to spread the word throughout Notre Dame. 
They marched through South Quad first, then traversed the woodland path to North Quad to continue their CALL TO WOR­SHIP. They carried torches, candles, a drum, and a sacrificial animal, a large white plastic swan. As the enclave progressed, their numbers swelled. Chants of increasing volume could be heard from the group. 
"Worship Stonehenge!" 
"Spring shall arrive!" 
"AN TOSTAL!" 
It wasn't really a pagan ritual that took place that fateful Tuesday night. This year's An Tostal marks the beginning of the Druid Mass. 
Inspired by the Notre Dame War Memorial's resemblance to a certain English structure attributed to the Druids, the Mass was started by the An Tostal Zoo. The unof­ficial event was publicized by simple white chalk drawings of the fountain with the words "II :00 tonight" placed strategically near the dining halls. 
The campus-spanning march, which lasted about half an hour, culminated in a proces­sion down the middle of North Quad to the chants of "An Tostal" and the beat of the bass drum borrowed from the Notre Dame Marching Band. About a hundred onlookers, attracted by the noise and the chalk drawings, gathered to watch as the Druids circled a small treee in front of the fountain. 
"Bring forth the sacrificial animal!" cried the Head Druid. 
The innocent swan met its "death" at the hands of the blood-crazed Druids, much to the delight of the frenzied masses. Ritual torches, or candles and sparklers were distributed among the congregation, as the Druids invoked the powers of the monument to let spring begin. 

At one point during the ceremony, excited brethren began pitching their torches at the sacred stones, and the "keepers" of the monument dressed in Notre Dame Security uniforms, ran to prevent the crowd from disturbing the hallowed monoliths. 
Soon thereafter, "Brother Mike (Switek)" of the Student Government Order arrived to deliver a sermon. He said that all Notre Dame and Saint Mary's faithful should en­join him An Tostal activities, now that the Druids have called forth spring to campus. 
The Spring ceremony became the first in­augural ceremony in the history of An Tostal. If the moon is right and the powers of Stonehenge will it, next year's festival may see another Druid Mass.

Elite eight has strongest field in years 

By MIKE CARDINALE

Every basketball junkie on campus will be behind the bookstore this afternoon, as the eight remaining teams from an original field of 584 take to the courts for the homestretch drive to the coveted Bookstore Basketball XV crown. Each team remaining has faced a long and grueling road to the elite eight, and they each appreciated a day off yesterday to prepare for today's ganies and allow some wounds to heal and pains to dissipate. 
The quality of play in the tournament has grown tremendously in the 15 years since its birth, and this year is no exception. No less than five former varsity basketball players participated in the tournament, and three of them, Jim Dolan, Tim Kempton and Casey Newell, still re­main. 
Although intensity and a strong will to win tend to dominate . the final rounds of Bookstore Basketball, the emphasis on fun, the true spirit of the tournament, has not disappeared. Wednesday's game between The Embarassing Stains and Mr. Coffey and the Non-Dairy Creamers exemplified this light-hearted spirit. Although the Stains argued continually with the referees, they also took the time to show that they were enjoying themselves.

tras, our government argues, we may rid Nicaragua of the pestilence of communism so that he people may establish a free and democratic society, just as they have been aching to do all along. Of course no one in the White House or the State Department really believes such naive hogwash; we could not care less whether the Nicaraguan govern­ment preserves freedom and democracy, so long as it keeps us comfortable by spurning Moscow and Havana. The United States has a long, embarrassingly shameful history of intervention in the internal affairs of foreign nations. Though in such instances we always asserted that we were acting to liberate some freedom-loving nation from the Kremlin's oppressive fetters, invariably we only made matters worse. 
In 1954 American business interests in Guatemala collaborated with the CIA to in­stigate a coup to overthrow the only democratic government in that country's history, because it was beginning to in­troduce labor unions, child labor laws, minimum wages, among other institutions taken for granted in United States but mysteriously perceived as subversive in Guatemala. The Eisenhower Administration cited the Guatemalan government's purchase of a paltry shipment of Czechoslavakian weapons as conclusive evidence of extensive communist influence. The ousted govern­ment was replaced by a series of murderous dictatorships spanning more than three decades, regimes wholly repugnant to the values we cling to so dearly for ourselves but unscrupulously compromise for others. 
The menace of communist expansionism in Central America, about which President Reagan has been fulminating incessantly, exists largely as a fundamental misunderstanding of the effects of our policy toward the region. It hardly should be sur­pnsmg that the Sandinistas, confronted with the United States' onslaught of con­tempt and overt support of their moral enemies, are now relying upon Cuban and Soviet assistance. 
The Cuban missle crisis of 1962 took place after the United States had launched a massive covert war against the new Cuban government that included a CIA­orchestrated invasion at the Bay of Pigs in April, 1961, several attempts to assassinate Fidel Castro, and an exhaustive program of economic sabotage. It seems inconceivable that Castro would continue to tolerate any Soviet military presence in his country were it not for the presence 90 miles away of ana­tion that has tried to knock him off repeated­ly for a quarter of a century. Nor should Nicaragua be any different. 
As her ambassador JG---the United States, Carlos Tun~old St. Louis Post­Dispatch /editorial writers in March: 
"Nicar.lgua will never be a foreign base for any foreign powers ... once the aggression is over then all the foreign military advisers we have in Nicaragua today will go back to their countries." 
Every time the United States interferes in the domestic affairs of another nation, it makes a mockery of the principles for which its people have often fought and died. The people of Nicaragua must be left to deter­mine the future of their nation, independent of foreign pressure and animosity. Whether they choose liberty or oppression, democracy or authoritarianism, capitalism or communism, the United States remains morally bound to respect the sovereignty of Nicaragua. To the extent that we can en­courage and support the establishment of democratic institutions, we ought to do so, but we must not force our values down their throats. On the other hand, however, we should not hesitate to sharply criticize any foreign government whose activities run con­trary to our values. Nor should we shy away from enforcing external sanctions against such regimes when appropriate. 

The interests of the United States lie not in toppling foreign governments that we find distatsteful, but rather in asserting the right of all nations to self-determination. Toward this end we have a legitimate interest in halting Nicaraguan-sponsored subversion against the sovereign governments of her naighbors. Furthermore, in the interest of our national security, the United States must adamantly oppose the presence of any Soviet or Cuban military forces in Central America. The Contadora peace initiative ad­vocated by Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, and Panama provides the opportunity for a diplomatic solution to the Central American conflicts, but our support of the contras only thwarts the peace process. Nicaragua can scarcely be blamed for refusing to negotiate with the United States so long as it continues to promote civil war, bloodshed, and political turnoil within their country. Spen­ding millions of dollars in contra aid will do nothing but fill Nicaragua's graveyards and earn the United States the contempt of its southern neighbors. A genuine, lasting solu­tion acceptable to both adversaries demands adherence to a foreign policy consistent with our values. Whether the current administra­tion has the moral courage to do so remains dubious.

wish you were here 
With the reshuffling of the global balance of 
power following the Second World War, the 
Soviet Union, a nation whose fundamental 
political and ~onomic values were an­
tithetically opposed to our own, emerged as 
the United States' most formidable rival in 
our history. In response to the threat of com­
munism, the United States has unwittingly 
subordinated its values of democracy and 
free-market economics to the foreign-policy 
objective of containment. 
We perceive ourselves engaged in a critical struggle with the Soviets over the political and economic futures of the Third World na­tions as they are only beginning to attempt to define themselves. Rather than face com­munism with rational concern and cautious determination, we have responded hysterically. Consequently, we have allowed our moral fortitude to degenerate to such an extent that we have found ourselves propp­ing up many brutal, corrupt, right-wing tyrants who have styled themselves as enemies of communism.Nowadays we lavish economic and military aid upon any number of latter-day Hitlers, political criminals who have no more sympathy for democratic values than did Otto von Bismarck and con­siderably less regard for human life and dignity. 
Included in this category are President Ronald Reagan's beloved "freedom fighters" the Nicaraguan contras fighting to topple the leftist Sandinista government of that coun­try. The Sandinistas took power in 1979, en­ding more than four decades of authoritarian, feudal rule by the Somoza family. Not long therafter, the new regime began to face an internal insurrection from a guerilla army led by former Somoza proteges and trained by the CIA. Initially the CIA was dispatched to Nicaragua to attempt to halt the flow of weapons from the San­dinistas to leftist rebels in El Salvador, but today there is no doubt concerning the United States' intention: the overthrow of a legitimate foreign government. The Reagan Administration justifies its drastic action against the Sandinista regime on. two grounds: first, the United States, as a global champion of freedom and democracy, has a duty to liberate Nicaragua would gravely threaten the security of Central America and of the United States, since it would naturally allow the presence of Cuban and Soviet military forces within its borders, from which communist revolution may be spread throughout the region. 
How arrogant we have become, to believe that we can manage the internal affairs of another nation better than the indigenous people themselves. By supporting the con-

Use of 'Christian card' needed for divestment 
Dear Editor: 

I would like to thank Professor Donald Kommers for his letter of April 21 in The Observer because his comments came as a real reminder to me and, I assume, also to some of my fellow members of the Anti­-Apartheid Network that ours is not the sole correct Christian position on thr. issue of divestment. As human beings we have no closer contact with God or with the truth than anyone else and should make no such claims of superiority. When it comes to mat­ters of social and political policy, there is no single, definite Christian stand. If we have 
been "self-righteous and intolerant" we have 
erred and are grateful to Kommers for poin­
ting this out. 

I hope, however, that Kommers doesn't in­
tend to relativize Christian beliefs into com­
plete inactivity. Anyone who claims to be a 
follower of Jesus of Nazareth, must 
recognize that His love for humanity took 
the form of concrete action, not that of eter­
nal debate and indecision. There comes a 
time when Christians, having researched and 
deliberated extensively, must answer the call 
of their heart; hoping that this might ap­
proach the will of God. · 

Of course Jesus had the advantage of bet­
ter access to the truth than we have, but He 
did leave us a concrete life replete with ex­
amples of how we, too, might glimpse the 
truth. No Christian, no matter of what 
political bent can deny that one of Christ's 
supreme commands was that His followers 
heed the cry of those fellow human beings 
who are poor and oppressed. 

No Christian will deny that there are poor 
and oppressed human beings in South 
Africa. But how many have truly heard theu 
cries? 

When it takes continual prodding to get 
the Board of Trustees to even reexamine, 
much less change, the university's investment

policy, one wonders whether their ears are tuned in to Soweto or to Pretoria and Wall Street. When noble American corporation leaders suddenly become interested in reform after having taken advantage of virtual slave labor for the past twenty-five, one wonders who cry these courageous businessmen are heeding, that of the poor or that of the stockholders. 
When the president of this university con­tinues to insist that these corporations con­stitute the best lever for change in South Africa, one wonders whose cry he is hearing, that of Bishop Tutu, Allan Boesak, Steve Biko, Nelson Mandela, Albert Lutuli, Beyers Naude, Basil van Rensburg, the African Na­tional Congress of South African Trade Unions or Donald Keough et al. 
A Christian has a right to decide which ap­proach is best fit to bring an end to an op­pressive social and political structure; scrip­ture and tradition have no definite answer on the question of divestment. But if those we purport to be helping are begging and pleading in very unequivocal terms for us to divest, to put real economic pressure on the South African government, what right have we, Christian or not, to argue that we know better. 
If members of the Anti-Apartheid Net­work "pull the Christian or Catholic card out of the deck" it is because they want tore­mind those of us who profess to be followers of Jesus to open their ears wide to the cry of the poor and oppressed and disregard all other considerations. Up to this point, because of the reluctance of the administra­tion and the Board of Trustees to take a firm stand against apartheid, the Anti-Apartheid Network is not convinced these members of our Christian community have heard the call of black South Africa, and if more use of the "Christian trump card" is necessary, the Net­work will continue playing it, thanking the Son of God for at least this one lever of in­fluence to make up for otherwise powerless membership in the Notre Dame community.

Student gained insight as State Senate intern 
A notice posted on the bulletin board out­side the Government Department advertised the availability of internships with the In­diana State Senate during the 1986 General Assembly. Being a government major myself and a resident of Indianapolis, this seemed to be an option worth looking into. No one seemed to know a great deal about it, though tile solons at the Administration Building knew enough to tell me that it would not merit academic credit.

President Reagan right to defend our freedom 
Dear Editor: 
What has President Reagan's raid against Libya accomplished? We must examine this question upon two levels. First, can it not be that the act, in itself, was just? We have proof that employees of the Libyan embassy in East Berlin were behind the killing of inno­cent people in a West Berlin nightclub. We also have evidence pointing to Libyan in­volvement in the Rome and Vienna airport massacres. These attacks are the respon­sibility of Khadafy. Almost everyone ac­cepts this. Is he not, then, guilty of murder? And should he not be punished for it--he, and the nation that supports him? To me, simple justice demands it. 
Secondly, will our tactics work? They will, if we have the resolve to follow it through to the end. Undoubtedly there are things we do not understand about these ter­rorists. But we do comprehend the language they are using. It is one of state-sponsored terrorism--premeditated, indiscriminate violence against innocent civilians in an at­tempt to force us, through fear, to accept their conclusions. Will they not, then, understand our use of force? If states that are supporting terrorism are made to bear a tremendous cost for their actions, will they not eventually be forced to reconsider? And if the number of states willing to harbor ter­rorists dwindles, these outlaws will find it more and more difficult to operate. 
"But violence only leads to more violence," some will say. And indeed, even now terrorists are attempting to strike back. But what did you expect'? Did you really think that these zealots would knuckle under immediately? We realize that these people believe in a cause, no matter how wrong it may be. Thus we must expect counterat­tacks, and persevere in spite of them. History teaches us that those with a just cause can prevail. Abraham Lincoln felt his cause to be the right, and he met the force of the South with superior force. He did not give in when the South met his violence with its own. Neither did Franklin Roosevelt waver before the tenacious resistance of the Germans and Japanese. Ah, but these are different situations, you say. But how dif­
government had made no effort to know me. United States Senator Richard Lugar (R­IN) seems to think he knows me though we have never met. He sends me letters all of the time, and I am not even a Republican. Only as an intern was I able to meet the woman who represents my district in the State Senate. As it turns out, she is a homemaker from Indianapolis. I have known her for three months now and she has yet to send me a single letter. Maybe that is because she knows that I am not a Republ­
can. 
A good word to describe state government as I saw it in Indiana would be "modest." A legislator's office, here in Indianapolis, is nothing more than a desk and a phone. His or her staff consists of a secretary and an in­tern who also work for at least one other legislator. With legislators drawing an an­nual salary of $11 ,600, you have to wonder why bribes ever went out of style. While next year's "long" session will last until April, this year's "short" session had everyone home for good by March. All things considered, I don't see how anyone could expect anything but modest results from a legislative body so conceived. Hoosiers seem satisfied with the arrange­ment. It doesn't cost much, and for most of the year, legislators are where you want them, at home where they can do the least harm. 
The national government in Washington, 
D.C. and state governments are natural rivals in our federal system. It is a friendly rivalry, sort of like Notre Dame and Valparaiso. The national government has been the dominant force in American politics for over fifty years. It was Franklin Roosevelt who, believing that keeping banks open and putting people to work was a legitimate national concern, created federal regulations and programs to address pro­blems that states had been unable or unwill­ing to act against. Ronald Reagan has tried to reverse this concentration of power in Washington and return some responsibilities 
ferent are they? In the Civil War the United States fought for the ideals of Union and freedom. In World War II we again fought for the notion of a democratic socie­ty. Now we find freedom under attack again. Do we care enough to risk fighting and dying for it? Will we realize that ter­rorists, who will not immediately surrender in the face of our military actions, will cer­tainly not be swayed by more vague economic sanctions? The bottom line is: Does freedom mean enough to us to defend it? 
Fortunately President Reagan does care. applaud him for his bold and courageous ac­tion. Again, he has shown leadership; I only pray that those on this campus who proclaim their love of peace, will just as loudly show their love of freedom. Peace and freedom must go together, but both of these ideals are threatened when terrorism operates without impunity. Victory comes not without cost, but let us defend what we hold so dear; let us show we are worthy, however long it may take.

Homosexuals repressed into secrecy at ND 
Dear Editor: 
I can still recall my reaction as I sat staring at the personals ad in The Observer. "Gays and Lesbians at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's"-how peculiar. I have never seen nor met a gay person at Notre Dame or Saint Mary's. Is this a real organization? Do these people truly exist here'? 
It has been about a year since I read this ad and over this time I have learned the sickening reality of this phenomenon. I had not seen any gay people at Notre Dame or Saint Mary's because gay people here are repressed into secrecy through discrimina­tion. 
The suffering to which the gay Domer or Saint Mary's woman is subject because of discrimination is absolutely unbearable. "Gays and Lesbians at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's," an organization which tries to support those who are gay and those struggl­ing to come to terms with their sexuality and themselves, is not recognized by the Univer­sity. The administration claims that the group is not consistent with the "mission" of the University. Kind-hearted people, follow­ing Christ's example, by helping their fellow human being, who is hurt, frightened and lonely, are inconsistent with the University's mission? I hardly believe so. On the con­trary, denying gay individuals of the support and encouragement this group provides, leaving them to deal with this frightening ex­perience alone, while constantly reminding them that "you are bad to be gay," I believe, is inconsistent with the "mission" of the University. 
Discrimination, however, does not stop at this level. These exists a certain degree of in­tolerance among students which helps to repress homosexuals even more. Words such as "gay, faggot, homo, queer, flamer (and other obscene derivatives) are so ingrained in our daily language that we don't realize the effec they have on gay people. Almost ~!ways these words are used negatively. 
John,. Halissy's letter in The Observer on April 4 w~ a disheartening reminder of this prevailing attitude of intolerance, I believe the basis for·this discrimination is rooted in simple ignorance of homosexuality. Halissy disagreed with the student government's pro­posed constitution which included a non­discriminatory attitude towards sexual orien­tation or "homosexual perversion" as he would like to call it. He equates homosex­uality with murder, rape and 1incest. Homosexual love, however, is as real' and ge­nuine as heterosexual love in all aspects, sex­ually as well as emotionally. In fact, I believe it is the same. A homosexual finds the emotional attraction, the companionship and the joy of loving another person as a heterosexual does. To equate this natural and beautiful love with murder, rape and in­cest is a "perversion." 
As Mark Rabogliatti said in his letter in the April 14 Observer, the Catholic Church does not consider sexual orientation im­moral, but homosexual acts immoral. Rabogliatti claims ''there is a difference." The Church believes that the immorality lies in the fact that procreation, an integral part in heterosexual love is lacking in homosexual relations. Does this mean that impotent in­dividuals or married couples choosing not to have children are immoral? Does the Catholic Church expect homosexuals to repress all feeling of love and attraction, de­to states and localities. Actually, the Reagan approach has been to stop funding programs administered by the states. As a result, states are free to choose between raising taxes and shutting down "non-essential" services. Such is freedom in America. 

My time at the State House ended too soon for my liking. I will long remember my months there as my introduction to politics. I hope that introduction leads to a lifelong association with public concerns. And I en­courage others to get involved as well. I realize that it is not everyone who is willing to put up with the demands and frustrations of political life. But everyone has an opi­nion. Do us all a favor, yourself included: make your opinion an informed one and make it loud and clear to the rest of us. The country that benefits will be your own.

nying themselves the beauty of the ex­perience of sexual love? The philosophy, "It's alright to be gay, just don't live a gay lifestyle," makes as much sense to me as say­ing, "It's alright to be a woman, just don't live a feminine lifestyle," or "It's alright to be black, just don't live a black lifestyle," or "It's alright to be who you are, just don't live as who you are." 
Homophobia is a serious problem at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. And from this fear grows discrimination, a discrimination that truly does repress, frighten and hurt gays. The proposed constitution was an attempt to break away from these attitudes and accept homosexuals as they should be. Hlllissy claims our students representatives "HAVE CHOSEN TO SUCCOMB TO THE PRESSURE OF A SMALL GROUP." I believe Halissy, as well as many others have chosen to succuomb to the unfounded in­securities and fears which our society im­poses on gays. I would only hope that students will follow the example of their representatives and greet their fellow gay students with understanding and, yes, love.

Bullets came out on top last night, 116-111, to tie 
their NBA first-round playoffseries with the Sixers at two games apiece. Details are at right. 



Associated Press 

LANDOVER, Md. -Reserve Dudley Bradley set up the go­ahead basket by Jeff Malone with 43 seconds remaining and then added a free throw with 22 seconds left to give the Washington Bullets a 116-111 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers last night, ty­ing their NBA playoff series at 2-2. 
The deciding game of the best-of-five series will be played at Philadelphia on Sunday night. 
The 76ers, who rallied to win the last two games, overcame a nine-point deficit in the fourth quarter and took a 111-109 lead with 1:31 remaining. 
But after a blocked shot by Cliff Robinson, Jeff Ruland scored to make it 111-111. Ruland missed his ensuing foul shot, but Bradley grabbed the rebound and threw the ball off the shins of Charles Barkley. Washington retained possession out of bounds and Malone converted the tie-breakng basket.

semifinals, to Lewis Hall's eventual championship team. Laura Gleason, who scored eight points in The Almosts' victory over The Pacers Wednesday, explained what The Almosts must do to pull out a victory. 
"It's going to be a tough game," she said. "We just can't give them any second shots. We'll be playing a tight zone." 
The Almosts dominated the boards against The Pacers, with 5-9 Gleason, and 5-10 Patty and Mary Ellen Mileski each pulling down double figures. The Almosts have a height advantage but Revenge, led by aggressive Regi Richter and former varsity guard Denise Basford, probably edge out The Amosts in the strength depart­ment. 
"We really don't know what's go­ing to happen," Richter said. "We're out there to win, or else we wouldn't be here, but it's hard being seeded (the highest remaining seed, after Shooting Back forfeited). It puts a lot of pressure on us. We've all played against The Almosts in interhail, so we know its going to be tough." 
Kara England and Marilu Almeida both played on last year's near-miss at the title, while Colleen 
Donnelly  is a veteran  interhall  
player.  The  Almosts'  captain  
Claire  Welsh  runs  the  offense,  

while Laura Hellert plays in the off-guard position. A strong 2-3 zone defense with the towers of Gleason and the two Mileskis will try to shut down Richter's scoring potential.

Error helps Yanks defeat Tribe, 2-1 
Auodate4 Pre~~~ 
NEW YORK-Bobby Meacham 
scored the tie-breaking run on a 
two-out error by Cleveland first 
baseman Pat Tabler in the fifth in­
ning and the New York Yankees 
beat the Indians 2-1 last night, giv­
ing them an 11-4 start for the first 
time in 28 years. 
Ron Guidry, 3-0, scattered 10 
hits, all singles, and stolen bases by 
Rickey Henderson and Meacham 
set up both runs for the Yankees. 
Guidry did not walk a batter and 
struck out four to move into second 
place on the Yankees' all-time list 
with 1 ,529, three more than Red 
Ruffing. Whitey Ford is the leader 
with 1,956. 
The Yankees managed only five 
singles off Neal Heaton, 0-1, and 
reliever Ernie Camacho. 
Mets 5, Cards 4 
ST. LOUIS· George Foster singled 
home Wally Backman from second 
base with two outs in the lOth inn­
ing last night, and the New York 
Mets extended their winning streak 
to six games with a 5-4 victory over 
the St. Louis Cardinals. 
The de feat marked the first time 
the Cardinals had lost a regular­
season game in which they led go­
ing into the ninth inning since the 
final contest of 1984, a span of 90 
such games. 
The Mets trailed 4-2 entering the 
ninth, but tied it on Howard 
Johnson's two-run homer with one 
out off Todd Worrell, 0-l. 
Wally Backman led off the New 
York lOth with a walk and then 
stole second. Worrell retired Keith 
Hernandez and Gary Carter, and 
intentionally walked Darryl 
Strawberry. Foster then lined his 
game-winning single to left. 
Roger McDowell, the fifth New 
York pitcher, worked the final two 
innings and raised his record to 2-0. 
Dodgers 6, Braves 3 
LOS ANGELES -Mike Marshall and Greg Brock hit solo homers and Mariano Duncan ended a 2­for-21 drought with a two-run dou­ble last night to lead the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 6-3 victory over the Atlanta Braves.

This weekend the Irish find themselves on the road once again, as they travel to Southern Il­linois to take on SIU-Edwardsville and St. Louis University.

In the nightcap, the Belles got off to an early lead in the first inning when Cuti walked, stole second, and scored on an Adamo single. Adamo scored on a single by Malina. 
Two more runs were added in the third as Pantelleria singled, stole second and third, and scored on a passed ball. Next, Malina, Boldt, and White all walked. Malina scored on a passed ball but Boldt and White were left on base. 

Manchester bounced back in the bottom of the third to score four runs. In the fourth, Manchester capitalized on three Saint Mary's errors, scoring three more runs to take a 7-5lead. 
In the sixth, the Belles were only able to score one run. Laura Danch walked and moved to second on a sacrifice by Tierney. Pantelleria ad­ded another hit to drive in Danch. 
Pantelleria stole three bases, had two RBis and batted 3-for-4 in the second game. 
"We are getting the hits. Now the defense must support the offense and not compound the errors," said Head Coach Scott Beisel. "Right now we are going to have to learn through games because there is not enough time between games to work on the defense. Most errors are routine plays so I think we just need to concentrate more." 
With districts coming up next week, the Belles are looking to defeat their next opponents. That game will be against Aquinas Col­lege on Friday in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
