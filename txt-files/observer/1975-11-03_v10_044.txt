Tht> student housing contract does not giv<' administrators carte blanche to enter student rooms, according to Dean of StudPnts .Jaml's Hoerner. However, Roemer said that he was not thinking in terms of rules and rights when he had signs referring to ltw liSC Trojans removed from Dillon and Alumni halls last week. 
"'t\ecording to Indiana law on landlord­
tPml!1t rdations a landlord can enter a 
tPnant 's room only if he is invited, or if there 
is strong rt•ason to believe that there is a

Secondly. Roemer claimed that while students could put up any sign they wanted insidP their rooms they have no right to put up such offensive signs on the outsides of llniversity buildings. "Grounds and buildings are within my jurisdiction." he said. 
"'I would only have used the room as a passage to the outside of the building. It was simply a matter of common sense--I was not going to risk my neck crawling up the side of the building like a human fly." 
But Hoemt•r could cite no panicular rule or n•gulation prohibiting signs offennsive to ('Ommunity standards. "Certainly therl' is no spPcific rule or regulation on this.

IYear-offl progra:m :made for cultural experiences 
Law internship program expanded 
by Phil ('ackley Staff Ht>porter 

The National Center for Law and the llandicappPd INCLHl, in conjunction with the Notre Dame Law School, has broadened its internship program this year to include a wide range of graduate studies. 
The NCLH. located at 1235 NC~rth Eddy St. in South BPnd. is, according to Cathy Ursin, director of education. an organization ''t•stablished to help insure and secure the constitutional statutorial rights of all handicapped people to equal treatment under the law." 
Founded in September of 1972, NCLH carries on work in litigation assistance, rt-search, and public education to ac­complish its goals. The Center is funded by grants from the Dept. of Health, Education and Welfare. 
An internship program was established several years ago for law students at the Notre Dame Law School. Later, the program was expanded to include graduate students in the social sciences. This year, the expansion has continued with the ad­mission of communication arts, ar­chitecture and business administration students. 
The co-administrators at Notre Dame for the program are Charles Crutchfield, asst. prof. of law, and John Santos, prof. of psychology. Ann Wernz, visiting prof. of law is serving as the supervisor for the program. 
' Ursin said the program was created to provide a clinical internship program with special and unusual opportunities for law students. However, because the solutions arrived at are very often not of a strictly legal nature, the program now has an in­terdisciplinary approach. 
Interns vital 
The interns are a vital part of NCLH staff, Ursin stressed. "Our staff is relatively small for what we are supposed to do," she said. The Center receives a large number of requests for information from both groups and individuals for advice on specific matters. 
The Center receives a large number of requests for information from both groups and individuals for advice on specific matters. The interns do screen most of these requests aud make recommendations to the NCLH staff as to how to deal most ef­fectively with the requests. 
The interns also attend seminars and are rotated among the several departments in NCLH to receive the widest possible ex­posure to learning situations. 
There are 16 interns in the program, 12 are second and third year law students. The other 4 interns are in the social sciences, the 
communication  arts,  architecture,  or  
business  administration,  working  on  
master's degrees or Ph.D.'s.  

The interns are paid for their work by the NCLH. The Center has set aside $55,000 of federal funds for this purpose. 
The emphasis, however, is on learning, and not on getting paid for a certain number of hours work, Ursin stated. She emphasized especially that the program is mutually beneficial for both the NCLH and Notre Dame. "The program is a learning ex­perience for both," she said. 
reasons administrators can enter student rooms. But Hoerner cited "the orderly operation of an Pducational institution" as justifying his action, noting that the just­!ification was made after the fact .. ·•If I had had to mlt•r an unoccupit•d studPnt room I l'ould have argued that since a large numht•r of people were offended. including top pPopiP in the community. lht' signs \\(•rt• iniPrfPring with the operation nf tlw l 'niversitv.

But not all signs which offt•nd somPorw can he removed by the llpan.

They will tht•n becomP dirt-ctly involved in l'xisting community programs relatl'd to that program. Participants in this years program are working in areas as varied as school and field work. 
MeNd! explained that the students will also be <'Xp<'cted to develop a lifestyle and <In attitude toward the use of money that is appropriate to the culutre and a person "truly dPdicatPd to social reform." 
In iht• Chile program which is based in Satniago. students live with families. but nwPt wPekly as a group. with a contract person to share their experiences and discuss their goals. The contact person. usually a Holy Cross priest, is somPone who is directly involved with social change in that country. lie will guide the students in thl'ir work in the Community and serve as a rt-source person because of his extensive t·ontacts with lay leaders and other church groups involved in this type of work. 
Participants in the ::,antiago program IhiS vear are Pt>te Conrad, Jim McDonald Kathy Osberger. Bt-rnie Nahglen and Malt Kt•iffer. 
Pat Cimino. Mark IJames and Doug Kreifels are the students, who under the guidance of contact person Bob Plasker, C.S.C., make up the delegation to Chimhote. PPru. Unlike the Santiago group. the student~ in Chimbote live in th\> Spanish equivaknt of a boarding houst•. However. the sam<' procedure in regards to the con­taet person is kept. Pomerleau noted one of 
thP studPnts in Pl'ru  works in a  handicap  
centl'r which  is  one  of  the  fl'w  in  South  
Aml'rica.  

There are no students in Panama City this year. but Pomerleau sees "no reaso11 why t ht-re can't be next year of people want to go there intead of Chile or Peru." 
In regards to why hl' and Pomt•rleau set up the program. McNeil explained. "Our beliPf is that values cannot be taught by a teacher to a student but come from \'X· perirnce. Thus we see this Pxperience with the vitally concerned Christian groups who are involved in very dynamic social change in Latin America as a way for an American student to confront his own value system and thus become l'ducated." 
Pomerleau thought "a major follow­through goal would be to come hack to Notre Dame and live some of the things they learned in South America. "The response from the students to the program "has been Pxtraordinary." according to Pomerleau. "The response on the part of everybody involved has been very positive and met in fine fashion. For instance, when the students leave, we advise them to keep their budgets. They're spending so little on food,

BEIRUT, Lebanon <AP) -Sniper, machine gun and rocket battles raged in Beirut on Sunday as Premier Rashid Karami tried to patch together a new cease-fire. Officials reported 41 persons killed and 76 wounded in the past 24 hours but said this was only a partial count. 
TEL AVIV, Israel <AP) -For the first time in at least 15 years, a ship carrying cargo for Israel passed through the Suez Canal on Sunday. The voyage by a Greek freight~r I_oaded with R~manian cement was made possible by the new Sma1 accord negotiated by Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger. 
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. <AP) -President Fiord flew here Sunday 
with assurances for Egyptian President Anwar Sadat that he will 
be returning to Cairo with a U.S. nuclear deal. 
Ford's meeting with Sadat at the home of a local oil millionaire 
was viewed as an unusual gesture. Normally the visiting Egyptian 
leader would be expected to call on Ford at the White House, as he 
did last week.

Germancathedral robbed 
COLOGNE, West Germany (AP l -Two daring burglars using Alpine ropes broke into Cologne Cathedral, crawled through air ducts and escaped early Sunday with priceless Ro­man Catholic art works and 
gems stripped from other reli­
gious articles. 

Police estimated the value of some 15 stolen sacred objects at "several million marks," the equivalent of at least $1 mil­lion, one of the biggest art 
thefts in postwar Germany. 
But a church official at Ger­many's most famous medieval cathedral said, "They were priceless treasures belonging to the bishopric for hundreds of years. No one can say now how much they were worth." 
He added that the objects were insured but the size of the policy was not immediately known. Cologne's archbishopric

In a burglary reminiscent of 
the fictional Istanbul Topkapi break-in portrayed in a novel and film, the thieves on Satur­day night scaled outside scaf­folds used for repairing the pol-• lution-damaged exterior. 
Top security changes reported 
WASHINGTON <AP> A major shakeup in the national security apparatus was report­ed Sunday. including the re­movals of Defense Secretary James R. Schlesinger and CIA Director William Colby. 
It also was reported that Sec­retary of State Henry A. Kissin­ger would give up his role as National Security Council head at the request of President Ford. 
National security operations have come under increasing fire following disclosures of do­mestic spying, alleged assassi­nation attempts against foreign leaders and alleged failures of the security advisers in Cyprus, Vietnam and the Middle East. 
Sen. Henry Jackson, D-Wash., said he had been in­formed of Schlesinger's remov­al by an administration source, whom he did not name. 
"His abrupt removal in­dicates that the administration cannot tolerate differing views and honest advice on the most serious issues of national secur­ity." said Jackson, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. 
Colby refused to confirm or deny the report of his depar­ture. telling The Associated Press, "I think I better stay out of this one." 
Kissinger declined comment. 
At Schlesinger's home, a 
young woman said the secre­
tary was unavailable. She also 
said, ''The announcement won't 
come from the Defense Depart­
ment." Asked where newsmen 
could check on the report of 
Schlesinger's leaving, she re­
plied, "The White House." 
Administration sources say 
Kissinger's national security 
deputy, Air Force Lt. Gen. 
Brent Scowcroft, would succeed 
him as national security ad­
viser. according to Newsweek 
and NBC. 
Scowcroft could not be 
reached for comment imme­
diately. 
In Jacksonville, Fla., Presi­
dent Ford evaded reporters' 
questions about the Schlesinger 
and Kissinger reports, saying 
only, "I love you all" when 
asked by newspeople about 
them. 
The White House press secre­
tary, Ron Nessen, also dodge<i 
questiOI\S on the subject, say­ing, "I don't have anything at 
all."

working not only with them, but 
undPr thPm---but most important­
tv. for lhl'm" the director of 
thPprogram stated. 
l'onwrleau said in addition t 

working with the townspeople, the 
studPnts are expected to keep 
Journals, get in touch with the 
pt•oplt• around them and write 
IPtl!•rs hack to Notre Dame 

dPscribin._; their experiences. 
According. to Pomerleau, this 
~·par's group has been doing "just 
finl'." Although they are given a 
f!•w days off, students are not given 
1 irm• off to vacation or leave the 

country. It is understood that a 
studPnt will stay in the country 
from late August of one year to the 

Pnd of May of the next. 
l'omNh•au explained the 

program is designed to take place liP! ween a student's sophomore and junior year. "By the end of the sophomore year, an interested · '-lll<l!•nt ought to be able to handle this type of experience and when lw or she returns for the junior year he or she will have two years in which to share the experience 
with the Notre Dame campus." 
llowt>ver. he said that the 

program is not limited to this 
braekl't of students. "Three of the 

studPnts in Chile are going to be 
sPniors when they return so you 

can see it is not a mandatory 
n•quirl'ml'nt to be between your 
sophomore and junior year," he 
t'ommPnted. 
1\kN<·il said the program was looking "for studmts who are 11 II ling to takl' a risk and break wII h llw lradition a I Notre Dame ~·ducation. l't>ople wha are very <'Oill'l'rnl'd about getting in and out of lwn· in four yt•ars and starling on llwir careers are not suited for tlw purpost> of this program. \\'p'rl' looking for pl'ople with a spPcial motivatiOn and thus we will lin111 llw program to a certain <~nHnt.l. nf stud<·nts per country per 
~·par. 
l'onH'rlt•au and McNeil an­licipatt• thl' participants who take the "VPar-off" would graduate in lour imd-a half to five years. 
l'omt>rleau thought this program might appeal to lhl' studt•nt who,a at the present moment, ts disen­ehantPd with his studies or the pt•rson who wants to put off !!raduate s<·hool for a year. 
Students who wish to be con­sidt>red for the 1975-76 program must have extensive knowledge of Spanish or be willing to take an intensive language course next 
sPnwsiPr. Pomerleau stresseed that lhl' language requirement "not deter anybody" from the program. "Three out of five studPnts in Chile did not have an <·xtnsive knowledge of Spanish. llowPver. once you're in these rountril's, you'd better be ready to spt•ak Spanish for that's all you'll ht• spPaking for the next year, "he addt•d. 
Aftt>r indicating their interest to PithPr Torn Stella, Basil O'Leary, l'onwrleau or Ken Jameson. the applieants will be askPd to present a proposal outlining their ex­pt>clations and goals for the year abroad. Once a student has been aeceptl'd, financial assistance will hl' sought from outside benefac­tors. Although the program is co­sponsored by Notre Dme and the Congregation of the Holy Cross, outsidt> financial help is essential and students are asked to con­tribute what they can to the program. McNeil and Pomerleau anticipate that the year abroad will cost approximately $3,000. 
"Wl' don't want the students to make a cent but we don't want lht>m to lose money either. We will make an pffort to find a subsidy for Paeh student according to his or lwr nt•eds," McNil said. 
In regards to why he and l'omt•rieau set up the program, McNill explained, "Our belief is t­hat values cannot be taught by a t­Pacher to a student but come from t>xperience. Thus we see this t•xperience with the vitally con­
l't'rnl'd Christian groups who are 
involved in very dynamic social 
change in Latin America as a way 
for an American stdent to confront 
his own value system and thus 
become Pducatl'd."

Designed for exper1ence 
Pomerleau tought "a major follow through goal would be to eome back to Notre Dame and live some of the things they learned in South Aml'rica." 
Ponwrleau explained that some 
(Woplt• intPrested in the program

Stance 

From Mr. Corpora's article 
•·ntitled "Abortion and Women's Lib" I have learned that all men an· immature, myopic, un­rontrollabl~· lustful, deceiving, IITl'sponsi ble. greedy, conniving and entirelv to blame for that t ragpdy which occurs every twenty ~econds. I have also learned that 1\'0111!'11 art' a naive and unthinking lot that exist only to give birth and tot he objects of condescension. Oh H's. I have also learned that il'onH·n do not at all care for sex. 
I must thank Mr. Corpora for t­l'aching nw so much and for ~haring with all of us his uncanny insight into the heart of the probkm and also for his rare talent for creating the in­control·ertible argument. 
Steve Shea 

Bt•ar Editor: 
In reference to the endless flow of pro-life articles authored by Joe Corpora. WP find his reasoning rapidly deteriorating. His lat~st journalistic endeavor. "AbortiOn and Women's Lib," was at best nwre rationalization and at worst idiotic. 
Corpora's claim that abortion 

exploits women from a financial 
standpoint is entirely unfounded. 
If the nwdical profession is indeed 
i)('nt on exploiting the woman and 
fl'lus for monetary gain, then they 
dearly seem to be pursuing the 
IITong route. 
('onsider. Mr. Corpora, the 

astronomical fees that the "male­
dominated medical profession" 
~lands to gain from delivery of an 
infant as opposed to an abortion. 
\'hi ld birth entails pre-natal, 
hospital. operational. and post­
natal expenses. whereas a 
lt•galized aboution can be per­
lonm·d for under $300, with the 
''oman's entire stay lasting under 
:!.J hours. 
('orpora justifiably proclaims 

tlw l'qual intelligence of women, 
hut. uaradoxically, his article 
in~inuates that it is necessarr for 
LIKE I K££P TELL!W VOU, 771£ MONEY SHOULD ARRIVE FROM MY RICH UNCI£ ANY 17M£ NOW!' 
a male to reveal to women their 
contribution  to  their own ex­ 
ploitation. Although  his  original  pro-life  

article contained many valid points. Corpora's latest con­tribution gropes for further sub­stantiation. using reasoning bordering on the absurd. Such a misguided defense of the right to life stance can only serve as a 
detriment to that cause.

The Quinlan 
Case 
Dt•ar Editor: 
In your October 30 article on the Karen Quinlan case, much em­phasis was placed on the "ex­traordinary means" being used to maintain her condition. With all due respect to Pope Pius XII, the "l'xtraordinary means" distinc­tion just is not persuasive, at least in this context. 
If someone for whom I am responsible can be kept "alive" by som('thing I hold in my hand, the morality 1and hopefully the legality) of withholding that soml'thing cannot turn on what you label it. Whether extraordinary or not. it is anlilable and it is that fact ll'hich requires us to consider the moral and legal appropriateness of withholding it. 
Does anyone really think that the l~uinlan case would confront us with an essentially different problem if she could be kept in her pn'sent state not by a sophisticated machine. but by a daily glass of 11·ater'1 
The anguish would remain, as would the real and complex problems: whether life should be defined, at least in part, in terms of its meaningfulness, actual or pot('ntial: what control over one's own life a person should have; and, l'specially in cases where the subject. like Karen Quinlan, is not in a position to make a choice. 
I do not pretent to have answers to these difficult questions. But I do hope that the discussion oc­casioned by the Quinlan case will come to grips with the real issues.

Journalistic 

Regret 

Dt'al' Editor: 
Regarding my review of the Beach Boys Concert entitled "Fun, Fun Revisited," which appeared in last Monday's Observer: 
I have come to realize, in ret­rospect. that in the midst of scrambling to meet my deadline, I seriously breached what I consider to be my usually sober sense of journalistic responsibility. In the article, I referred to a police of­ficer. by name. There was ab­solutely no reason for my doing so. This reference was unnecessary for the spirit and substance of my article. It was not done out of malice. just out of blind stupidity in the interests of a realistic ac­count. I regret that this oversight may have caused this person any undue t•mbarrassment or recrimination.

J)par Editor: 
After watching the Notre Dame 
cheerleaders through half the 
season. I have come to the con­
clusion that they should stop trying 
to be a USC type cheerleader and 
start being a Notre Dame 
cheerleader. 
The new uniforms (duplicates of 
the USC cheerleaders) and dance 
routines are fine for the girls out 
west from USC but somehow the 
transference to Notre Dame lacks 
considerably. I have watched 
Notre Dame cheerleaders since 
the first female cheerleaders at 
Notre Dame a few years ago, and if 
I had to compare them to the 
present cheerleaders, I would 
select the former cheerleaders as 
the better. The old plaid uniforms 
were much more appropriate since 
we are the fighting Irish and not 
the Notre Dame Trojans.

People Who Need People 
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii_.paul herbig 
A thought occurred to me between the USC and the Heach Boys' 
Concert. Watching the thousands -I'd almost say tens of thousands of 
people the way the campus was covered like ants on a piece of candy -it 
occurred to me that what this university is all about is people. 
People. That sums it up pretty well. The people at this school make it 
what it is. I'm not going to talk about the school. I'm going to talk about 
the people. The people are the school. The school might be a hundred 
plus years old and might have traditions by the hundreds, but if the 
people there don't have spirit or care, the school is a bunch of buildings­
no more, no less. The people are the school. Their strengths are the 
college's strengths, and the reverse for their weaknesses. So what about 
the people of the school? 
First of all let us note the diversity of the people of this university. 
From everywhere they come. Not just the United States but from many 
of the countries in the world. From either coast, from the gulf, from the 
Rockies, southern belles, yankee boys, California girls and mounaineers, 
plainsmen and Hoosiers, Jerseyians and Chicagoans, look around and 
chances are (not a chance, a certainty) that somewhere on this campus 
there is someone from there. 
Diversity, not only geographically, but of all points of view, is com­
monplace here. Politically, economically, intellectually, physically, 
psychologically, whatever area of difference there might be, there is 
someone here who has it. All points of the spectrum in all areas and all 
points of the compass are to be found here. This blanketing effect is of 
great interest and profit. Anarrow population leads to narrow views with 
little possibility of expanding horizons. But if there are no limits, 
horizons can expand to whatever range one wishes. And beyond a doubt, 
all will benefit considerably from the diversity to begainedhere. 
Seconrl point of interest: experiences. A single individual has only a 
short range and limited quantity of experiences. But a group has many. 
A group's experiences are a combination of each individual's own ex­
periences. A group is morethanthe sum of the individual which makes it 
more powerful and worthwhile than the individual. Each person is ex­
posed to other's experiences and gains from it. Similarly there are 
thousands of people and thusly thousands.. of varied experiences here. 
Name a place and someone's been there. Name an event, someone was 
there. Name an occurrance and someone's been exposed to it. The range 
of experiences is endless and each of us gains from another's. The riches 
that exist experience-wise is are beyond measure. 
And then there is the know-how, the intellectual side. Engineers. 
Businessmen. Humanities. Science. The range of knowledge that exists 
in a multitude is immense and enriches the whole group not just the in­
dividual. Take a dorm for instance. On a single floor the range of majors 
tends to cover all fields. And the variety effects all positively Each person 
on the floor gains much from the contrasting special ties that abound. 
And collectively each is much better for the experience. 
The experiences you will have, those you'll share and those given will 
be the foundation forth rest of your life. The knowledge and skills gained 
will be the support for your career. But beyond it all are the people you 'II 
meet. People make up the world. People will be what matters. 
Mingle. The university is_ the spawning grounds for thought. I brings 
together people of all backgrounds, experiences, interests and goals. In 
this once in a lifetime experience, everyone is given the opportunity to 
converse, meet with, and exchange these facets of individual personality. 
It is to the betterment of all that as many people are met as possible, 
many cultural exchanges, many experiences are shared, and much k­
nowledge transfered. A richer, more complete person is the result. 
So you out there. Get off your rears. Don't stay in your rooms all of the 
time. Don'tmake the school one long venture in the library. Get out. Go 
to the parties. Meet people. Talk to them. Understand ·them. Get to k­
now them. Share experiences and good times with them. Go to concerts, 
games, shows, special events. Mingle. That's the keyword. Mix. Don't 
be shy. People aren't going to bite. Don't be shy. People aren't going to 
bite. There's an unlimited reservoir of experiences here. Don't be afraid 
of exhausting them -the reservoir is endless. Don't be narrow minded. 
Live a little. Talk to each other. Share and share alike. You'll be sur­
prised with what you'll learn. 
The courses you take, the studies ~ou have, will more likely be 
forgotten. But the people you meet, the friends you'll make, they are 
forever.

l•'rom the streets and byways, the sidewalks and alleyways, the closets and hallways, the Minstrel drew a throng to his gallery. Yes, one and all flocked to see the showmen from I<:ngland, Jethro Tull, lwadPd by that pied piper himself, Ian .-\ndPrson. Tull flew into South Bend on the strains of a flute and left the audience with thl' sound of "Locomotive Breath" ringing 111 tlwir ('ars. 
('omhination was the key to the concert. A tlwnw of old mixed generously with new pn•vaill'd. Open!ng with "Thick as a Brick". a much Pditcd version of their

Amid I hl' grunts and snorts of a perfectly

A sidl'light was introduced that met mix('d l'motions from the crowd. I<:van playl'd a piano concerto with a string accompaniml•nt of three violins and a t'Pllo.

It is com­forting to sPe that such talent can exist in ('Onjunrt ion with an otherwise rock and roll group. This is just another example of Tull's complete concert style.

Food deliveries allowed

The policy of preventing food delivery from entering the campu~ has been rescinded, said Dean of Students James Roemer last t'\'ening. 
The original policy of preventing dl'livery was initiated Thursday t'H'ning. and was designed "to limit the amount of traffic on campus. and to aid hall food

. of mterpretm~ rules an_d rt•gulatwnsRoemerclaimed tha~ It 
1s "imposstble to set up precise sales," said Roemer. 
Over the weekend, pizza deliveries were allowed entrance only as far as the Notre Dame circle. Students then picked up their pizza at the circle. 
Last evening, though, Roemer stated "On receiving further in­formation. I have discovered that there is a small number of vehicles delivering, and that students do· 
want to have this service." "I have decided that it is not in 
the best interests of the students to limit this type of delivery," said 
Roemer. 
Roemer received complaints 
over the weekend from both food 
delivery outlets and from students. It was pointed out that few students use this service, and that 
the extra cost of it does not hamper hall food sales. The inconvenience to floral deliveries was also noted. 

Alcohol. however, will not be permitteddeliveryon campus, as it would be in violation of the Fac­cenda Bill.

By the time Gerald Lucas got his college degree, he had two good jobs waiting for him. Ajob at AT&T. And, since he was graduating with a commission through Am1y ROTC, a job as an Army officer. 
He took them both. One at a time, of course. First he took his tour in the Army, then he took the skills he acquired there to AT&T. 
Because, through Army ROTC, Jen-y got some very practical experience in leading people and managing enterprises which he might not have got otherwise. 
Of course, AT&T had to wait a bit to get Jerry. But what they got for the wait was a seasoned manager, who is now a Super­vising Engineer with his eye on the next step up. 
Was the wait worth it to jetTy? "Well, to be honest:' he says, "it had its pluses and minuses. But the pluses won. And if I had it to do over again, I'd do it the same way:'
