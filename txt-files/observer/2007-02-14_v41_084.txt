Albion: Work for goals, not money 
By MEGHAN WONS News Writer 
Mark Albion co-founded six start-ups, wrote a New York Times bestseller, taught at Harvard Business School and spoke both in front of the United Nations and with Mother Teresa but he told his audience at the Mendoza College of Business Tuesday night he was simply a fellow journeyman. 
A social entrepreneur and cofounder of Net Impact, a nationwide organization of graduate students and profes­sionals supporting responsi­ble business, Albion came to campus after Notre Dame's MBA Net Impact chapter invited him to participate in its annual Ethics Week. 
Albion urged students to work for more than a pay­check. find an occupation that makes them passionate and use it to impact the world. 
"What's your contribution going to be?" he said. "What are you going to do with your God-given life? That's the big question." 
Albion recalled the day that changed his perception of his career and put him on a "dif­ferent path." 
On June 5, 1986, Albion said, he was a Harvard busi-

Engineers anticipate new hall 
By JOHN-PAUL WITT News Writer 
The $69.4 million Stinson­Remick Hall will house some of the most sophisticated equip­ment known to Notre Dame, College of Engineering officials said Tuesday. 
The new facilities, to be com­pleted in the next three years where the University Oub cur­rently stands, will allow for pioneering work in circuitry, particularly in the "clean room" -an advanced lab for constructing complex circuits, said Thomas Fuja, the chair of the department of electrical engineering. 
The clean room will contain air 20,000 times more pure than normal air, electrical engineering professor Gregory Snider said. 
"This will allow us to do computations with individual electrons, and construct at the nano level," Snider said. "This

Pellchange could ease high costs 
By STEVE KERINS 
News Writer 
President Bush's administra­tion recently announced his 2008 budget will include a proposal to increase the maxi­mum value of Pell Grants by $550 to $4,600. For low­income students who want to attend Notre Dame but cannot afford the high tuition, these grants could help bridge the payment gap, said Director of Financial Aid Joe Russo. 
Russo is optimistic about the implications for Notre Dame and its peers should Bush's proposed budget be approved by Congress. 
"The good news of possibly improved Pel! Grant funding should serve as an encourag­ing signal to many applicants and result in increases in applications nationally," he said. 
Pell Grants, which do not need to be repaid, are designed to help low-income students pay for college. Students who receive these grants can use them at Notre Dame to lower the total cost of their tuition. 
"Any improvement in maxi­mum awards would result in increases in the amount of such aid to our Pell-eligible students and thus result in increases in need-based assis­tance for our undergraduates," Russo said. 
But many questions remain. 
While educators and policy analysts have lauded the pro­posed increase, many are con­cerned about how it will be funded, including professor

Editor 
These lines open 

the Silver Star cita­
tion awarded to my uncle, James 
Patrick Witt, for his actions on 
Valentine's Day, 1969. 
This medal was awarded posthu­

mously. He succumbed to the wounds 
he suffered in combat 38 years ago. 
This letter is what I have of him, what 

I can touch and see. All else are ancient 
memories gleaned from once-soldiers 
over too much wine, too late at night. 
Read on: "the point element took the 

command post of a North Vietnamese 
Army company by surprise." 
The point element. My uncle. 
"Second lieutenant Witt ... while ini­

tiating an aggressive assault on the 
enemy bunker, received multiple 
wounds as he moved across the fire­
swept terrain ... Although painfully 
wounded, Second lieutenant Witt calm­
ly ... delivered explicit directions 
regarding the course of action to be fol­
lowed by his men." 
I never knew my uncle. In my home, 

he was always spoken of in quiet, 
hushed tones. 
"Your uncle Jim was a Marine," my 

father would say. 
Marine. Not "brave," not "a leader," 

but. Marine. As if no other word was 
necessary. 
But all I had of him was a sheafof 

paper bearing a red and gold seal, and 
a plaque of medals, for bravery and 
valor. 
I felt I was missing something. A part 

of my family. A part of me that runs 
through my veins. 
I don't know how my father bore it, 

every year. He would take me to a 
candy store on the 13th, and I would 
buy something for my mother. 
If I were him, I would still weep. 
As I grew in age and wisdom, I 

resolved to learn about my uncle, from 
the ones who knew him best. 
I traveled to Orlando for a reunion of 

the First Battalion, Seventh Marine 
Regiment. My uncle was part of Delta ·company. 
There, I met men who still bore the 

scars of the war that was consigned to 
history three decades ago. They live it 
every day. They weep in church, and 
drink in camaraderie. 
From them, I was able to paint a pic­

ture of my uncle that was more real 
than the words of the Commandant of 
the Marine Corps, or my parents' 
respectful silence. 
"He never asked anyone under his 

charge to do anything that he himself 
would not do," his men said. 
"It was my fault. I put Jim on point 

that day, because he was aggressive. It 
was my decision," said his captain. 
They told me about a man who cared about his men, was a good leader and a gallant soldier. 
I celebrate Valentine's Day, I weep as I write this, because "We Remember." Semper Fidelis.

COUNCIL OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Con1n1ittee created to explore fund options

"The groups don't always reach their budget. They're being responsible and so [the carry forward account] is grow­ing," SUB treasurer Steve Friend said. 
As of Jan. 31, he said, the carry forward account had $213,500, not including rev­enues from The Shirt or other student activities. Friend esti­mated the carry forward fund would hold around $221,000 once those revenues were added. 
Friend also mentioned "The Shirt Royalty Fund," which he described as a "rainy day fund" that currently holds $300,011. 
The fund only grows if The Shirt achieves record-high sales. Some of the money in the royalty fund could be put toward the student government endowment, Friend said. 
The money would then accu­mulate interest. 
Friend cautioned that though the carry forward and royalty funds have rapidly expanded over the past five or six years, it is still important to have money on

Lowry said an endowment fund would be possible for student government, "but we would have to go through Development if we wanted outside donors," he said.

Dame  gradu­ about their pur­ 
ates, Barbara Wardlow agrees. While Notre Dame  Rick Burden senior vice president NDFCU  chases. "The Linebacker probably isn't going to show up  

students' loans usually total more than $20,000, and debt occasionally blindsides them upon graduation, "our stu­dents are very good about paying back their loans," she said. 
Notre Dame's one-in-300 rate in 2004 translates to a .3 cohort default rate, lower than peer institutions such as Duke (.4), Georgetown (.5), Boston College (.9) and Northwestern (.9). 
It's their predecessors' near-spotless loan payback record that makes the board of directors at NDFCU feel comfortable granting credit cards to Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and Holy Cross stu­dents with no credit history. A student can receive up to a $1,000 credit card limit as a freshman or sophomore, $1,500 as a junior or senior and $2,000 as a graduate stu­dent. 
"It's unusual and frankly, kind of scary, when you think about it. When I first got here [about 13 years ago]. I thought the board of directors was nuts," Burden said. "College students have no money, generally, so how are they going to pay these bills back? 
"But in general, our stu­dents with credit cards proba­bly have a better pay record than our members." 
While that 
record is partly 
on that bill," he 
joked. 

Bad credit history occasion­ally occurs with incoming freshmen, though. Often they apply for credit cards they can't pay for as seniors in high school, Burden said, or they join a health club and don't pay the membership fees -prompting the club to notify the credit bureau. 
"It's rare, but it does hap­pen," Burden said, adding quickly that NDFCU would deny such students. "That shows we're not totally stu­pid." 
Nor is the University, which recognizes the staggering debt many graduates will face come graduation day. So it works to make students aware of and prepared for the money they'll owe after col­lege. 
The Career Center hosts a three-part Senior Transitions Course, now in its second year, which gives seniors a glimpse into the real world. Topics covered include devel­oping a career plan, netwnrk­ing with alumni, budgeting and investing. 
"If you graduate from Notre Dame and you owe $30,000, that's going to be a concern for you," said Father Joe Carey, a career advisor at the Center and an organizer for the course. "That's going to impact where you live, how much you can pay for rent, how much you spend on food. These sorts of things are big questions." 
The first leg of the series takes place tonight. 
The Financial Aid Office also warns seniors how much they will owe, how often, and in what size increments. They used to hold meetings, but now they forward this infor­mation online. Wardlow still encourages students to come in for an exit interview, where a financial aid representative can answer any questions a student might have. 
She also advises graduating seniors to keep in touch with their loan lenders, from noti­fying them of an address change to asking them for for­bearance if they know the money won't be available to pay back. 
"You should never ignore the billings and any corre­spondence you get from your lenders," she said. "It's very hard to clean up your credit once you get that black mark on it." 
And while Burden's job is to negotiate as many loans as he can, he admitted there are situations when credit isn't the right choice. 
"People borrow so much money nowadays," he said. "We shouldn't be in a hurry to get young people into debt."

Grants 
continued from page 1 
Notre Dame's Department of Economics and Policy Studies. The Bush administration plans to draw federal funds away from other student aid pro­grams, including Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (SEOG). 
"The [proposed] increase in the Pell Grant may not offset the supplemental grant in all cases," Warlick said. "It's going to redirect monies they have allocated for low-income stu­dents, so there are going to be some winners and some los­ers." 
And relatively expensive schools like Notre Dame would likely see less of a benefit from any funding increase com­pared to less costly state uni­versities. 
"I think we'll be less likely to see the effects because it's such a small drop in the buck­et [relative to total tuition costs]," she said. 
With more of the burden placed on lenders, legislation to raise the Pell Grant maxi­mum may also harm higher­income students who take out loans to pay for college. 
"This is really reallocating from one set of people to another set of people rather than increasing the budget," Warlick said. "They're going to shift the burden from the low­income families onto the mid­dle-class families, and the price of borrowing is going to rise." 
But Warlick said an increase in funding for Pell Grants could still attract more high-quality, low-income applicants to Notre Dame, holding other variables constant. 
"A [funding] increase would actually reduce the net price [of attending Notre Dame] if the amount of other aid isn't altered," she said. "But you have to ask, is the increase in Pell Grants equal to or greater than the increase in tuition?" 
Warlick said the number of low-income students who apply to Notre Dame could increase as a result of an increase in the value of the Pell Grant, but only if their finan­cial aid policies compare favor­ably to other universities. 
"It's not only what the inter­nal action is at Notre Dame, but also how other universities respond to the Pell Grant," Warlick said. 
But these changes are con­tingent on the Pell Grant pro­posal passing through Congress. Policy watchdogs and educators agree that Bush's budget may fail to pass in its current form. It could be months or years before the fate of the Pell Grant, along with other federal government student aid programs, will be known. 
"What remains a matter of contention and uncertainty," Russo said, "is how the resources necessary to support these proposed awards would actually be funded." 
Warlick agreed, citing the recent impasse between President Bush and the Democratic Congress. 
"This President has an extremely low public approval rating, and I don't think [the Pell Grant proposal] is any less controversial than any­thing else he's proposed," Warlick said. "I don't think [the budget] is going to pass like this."

Six dead in Algeria bombings 
ALGIERS -A group linked to al-Qaida staged seven near-simultaneous bomb attacks Tuesday, targeting police in several towns east of Algiers and killing six people, officials said. 
Al-Qaida in Islamic North Africa-the new name for the Salafist Group for Call and Combat, known by its French acronym GSPC -rlaimed responsibility for the attacks in a telephone call to the Al-Jazeera television net­work and in a statement on the Internet. The group allied itself with al-Qaida last year, rais­ing the stakes in the region's fight against ter­rorism. 
The seven bombings, some of them car explosions, hit the Kabylie region east of Algiers between 4 a.m. and 10 a.m. Tuesday, the state news agency said. 
The apparently coordinated attacks sur­prised the North African country, which has steadily emerged from an Islamic insurgency that killed more than 150,000 people in the 1990s. While scattered violence by the GSPC continues, such carefully planned strikes are rare in today's Algeria, an ally in the U.S.-led war against terrorism. 
Belgian elite collaborated with Nazis 
BRUSSELS -A government-backed report released Tuesday blamed Belgian authorities and the ruling elite for collaborating with the Nazi persecution of Jews during World War II. 
Although Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt has already recognized the level of collabo­ration, the report was the first time it had been presented in such detail. 
"The Belgian authorities cooperated with the racial anti-Jewish policies during the occupation," and acted in a way "unworthy for a democracy," said the study.

U.S. plans to forgive Liberia's debt 
WASHINGTON -The Bush administration plans to forgive Liberia's $391 million debt to the United States, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told an international con­ference on Tuesday. 
"We will cancel that debt, all of it," Rice said in a speech to a World Bank gathering of international development experts and delegates from at least 20 countries. 
With Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf seated nearby, Rice said the reduced debt burden should enable Liberia to devote more resources to reconstruction and devel­opment. 
The country's $3.7 billion overall debt is something that today's leadership and today's people of Liberia do not deserve, Rice said, a pointed reminder that it is a burden that authoritarian rulers of the past quarter century were responsible for. 
Tornado strikes New Orleans 
NEW ORLEANS -Eighteen months after Hurricane Katrina, Stella Chambers' modest red-brick house had finally been repaired, and she was waiting for one last utility hookup to move back in. But the 85-year-old woman never made it. 
A tornado tore through her neighborhood in the city's Gentilly neighborhood before daybreak Tuesday, flattening her house, rip­ping apart the front-yard FEMA trailer in which she was living, and killing her.

Students start nap club at IUSB 
SOUTH BEND -The idea of college students walking around campus with pillows and blankies seems funny, and the idea of a nap club at Indiana University South Bend did, indeed, start out as a joke. 
But students Michael Duttlinger and Joe Spencer, president and vice president, respec­tively, might have started something that could revolutionize the school. 
Science says napping can heighten creativity, boost memory and increase alertness. So stu­dents who nap potentially boost their GPAs, which could lead to better jobs. 
No joke.

Audiotape calls for Muslim unity, claims U.S. is losing in Iraq and Afghanistan 
Associated Press 
CAIRO -Al-Qaida's No. 2 said President Bush was an alcoholic and a lying gambler who wagered on Iraq and lost, according to a new audiotape released Tuesda~ · 
Ayman al-Zawahri said in the tape that Bush has been forced to admit his failure in Iraq after he was "stubborn" and repeated the "lie, which he became addicted to, that he is win­ning" in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
"Bush suffers from an addictive personality, and was an alcoholic. I don't know his present condition ... but the one who exam­ines his personality finds that he is addicted to two other faults -lying and gambling," al-Zawahri said in the audiotape. 
Bush, who is now 60, has acknowledged he had a problem with drinking but gave up alcohol when he was 40 years old. 
The 41-minute audiotape could not immediately be authenticated but was seen by The Associated Press on a Web site commonly used by insurgent groups and carried the logo of the multimedia arm of al­Qaida, as-Sahab. 

The audio was accompa­nied by a video that showed a still picture of ai­Zawahri, apparently join Barnas, the Islamic troops to Iraq.

Deputy to oversee Chinese trade 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is setting up a telephone hotline connecting him directly with the vice premier of China and naming a new deputy to oversee high level talks amid agita­tion in congressional quarters for a tougher line with Beijing on trade issues. 
Paulson's announcements came on the same day the U.S. government reported that the United States trade deficit set a record for a fifth consecutive year and the imbalance with China soared to the highest level ever for an individual country. 
Paulson said he understood there was growing pressure on the admin­istration to do something about the U.S.-China trade relationship but he said he believed that the high-level strategic dialogue he has created offers the best opportunity to achieve results. 
Alan Holmer, an executive of a pharmaceutical company and a for­mer trade official during the Reagan administration, was tapped to be Paulson's deputy in charge of the strategic dialogue talks. 
The first high-level talks were held in Beijing in December and Paulson said the second round would occur May 23-24 in Washington. 
Paulson is also scheduled to travel to China in early March, his third trip to China as Treasury secretary. He will give a speech in Shanghai urging the Chinese government to allow U.S. financial firms to operate more freely in the country. 
Holmer replaces Deborah Lehr, who quit after being in the job for just a few weeks. Paulson said that he would soon have a replacement as well for Timothy Adams, Treasury's undersecretary for inter­national affairs and a key architect of the administration's China poli­cies. Adams announced he was step­ping down earlier this month.

The new addition will also play an important role in the advance­ment of the University's national prestige, Merz said. 
"Students in all Colleges want to graduate from a top-ranked uni­versity and this new building will contribute to that," Merz said. 
Planning for Stinson-Remick Hall began in 1994, and ftmdraising has gone on for the past five years. Construetion is expected to begin in November 2007, Batil said.

restaurant tonight, and every woman will be greeted at the door with a long-stemmed red rose. 
At LaSalle Grill, which was completely booked for tonight more than a month ago, a spe­cial "Tastes of Love" Valentine's Day menu will be prepared for the evening. 
Another restaurant, Studebagels, capitalized on the holiday by making heart­shaped bagels. 
Freshman Michelle Ripple may visit one of these restau­rants tonight, but as she ven­tures into a classic Valentine's Day romance ritual -the blind date -she doesn't know her exact plans for the evening. 
"I arrived at my dorm to find a rose and an invitation to a private dinner with about five other couples, and those are all the details I know," she said with a smile. 
Ripple, however, was not the only one counting the hours before Valentine's Day. 
The staff at LeMans Hall set up multiple table in the front lobby anticipating the arrival of many bouquets and floral arrangements for its residents, something that surprised soph­omore Maggie McSorley. 
At Notre Dame, the Ballroom Dance Club will mark the occa­sion with a Valentine's Day dance tonight, but the group's excitement may not be shared by the entire community. 
More than 400 anti­Valentine's Day Facebook groups are available to cynics and lonely hearts, including the "Anti-Valentine's Day," "Boycott Valentine's Day" and "Valentine's Day Should Be Abolished" groups. 
Sophomore Ashleigh Cross joined the ranks of the dis­senters. 
"Valentine's Day is too com­mercialized and exclusive and if you don't have a certain someone to spend it with," she said. "It's not that fun." 
It may not be a cause for cel­ebration for Cross, but others may appreciate the historical significance of Valentine's Day. 
The holiday stemmed from three Catholic priests martyred on February 14. 
One of them, St. Valentine, defied Roman emperor Claudius II in the 3rd century by marrying young couples in secret. 
However, the happiest people today may not be the holiday's devotees, but the stockholders of the companies reaping the commercial benefits. 
Approximately 180 million roses and 36 millon heart­shaped candy boxes will be exchanged today, and profits associated with the holiday will near $14 billion, according to the History Channel.

is research which will greatly increase the speed and efficiency of computers." 
But this type of research has the potential to create an impact beyond the performance of com­puters, engineering Ph.D. student Trevor Cickovski said. 
''I'm excited to use these facilities for research that has significant contributions to society," Ockovski said. "We'll potentially be able to work with nanotechnology as small as human cells, which has count­less medical applications." 
This level of research is not pos­sible in the College of Engineering's current home, Fitzpatrick Hall, interim College of Engineering Dean James Merz said. 

"Our clean room now isn't much cleaner than the hallway, because we don't have the proper ventila­tion technology in Fitzpatrick." Merz said. "Our current building wasn't designed to do the latest engineering research." 
But Stinson-Remick Hall will be able to serve these needs as it is set to inelude architectural features especially designed for an engi­neering facility, said Mark McCready, the chair of the chemi­cal engineering department. 
"The structure will be built stiffer to minimize the vibration of the building, which affects our work on the nano level," McCready said. "The site will also be grounded against electromagnetic interfer­ence, which could interfere with our instruments." 
He said experiments that don't requjre cutting-edge facilities will still be conducted in Fitzpatrick Hall. 
The new building will also con­tain practical features for students -including a 24-hour discussion lounge, a small cafeteria and a chapel -which the College of Engineering currently lacks, McCready said. 
The facility will provide new lab spaces for graduate students and faculty members -but with the new Engineering Learning Center, Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering department chair Stephen Batil said the building will be geared toward undergraduates. 
The learning center will occupy four times the instructional space currently available to undergradu­ate students. 
Stinson-Remiek will also contain more labs than there are current engineering faculty members, but the department chairs said they expected the new infrastructure additions would attract new schol­ars and professors to Notre Dame. 
"We're 20 years behind where we need to be on buildings," Batil said. "Every other major research university has had 10 times the building construction we've had in engineering." 
New facilities are necessary for Notre Dame's undergraduate and research engineering programs to remain competitive against rivals like Princeton and Purdue, he said. 
"If we want an engineering pro­gram like l>rinceton, f(>r example, we need to invest like they do," Batil said.

IN BRIEF 
U.S. centers target chronic fatigue 
ATLANTA -The television spot shows a 40-year-old woman, in slow motion, as her family and co-workers rush by over the course of a day. It ends with her sitting alone, amid the remnants of a birthday party. 
"The worst part isn't even that everyone thinks the problem's in my head," a female voice intones. "The worst part of chronic fatigue syndrome is missing my life." 
The spot is the centerpiece of a remark­able $4.5 million public awareness cam­paign bankrolled by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It's remarkable, in part, because of the role advocacy and politics played in creating it. 
Chronic fatigue syndrome is not conta­gious or life-threatening, and medical skeptics continue to question its merits as a focus for public health. But the money is being spent, in part, thanks to strategic lobbying and congressional interest. 
It is not the only example, or the most successful. In 2000, the March of Dimes lobbied Congress to create a center on birth defects within the CDC. In December, advocates -including Autism Speaks, an effective fundraising organization founded by General Electric Co. Vice Chairman Bob Wright -were credited with passage of a bill that targeted nearly $1 billion over five years to research that condition. 

Developer Mills ends Brookfield deal 
WASHINGTON -Mall developer The Mills Corp. said Tuesday it now favors a $1.6 billion offer from Simon Property Group Inc. and hedge fund Farallon Capital Management LLC-a deal that tops an earlier takeover agreement Mills made with Brookfield Asset Management Inc. 
Chevy Chase, Md.-based Mills said its board of directors concluded that the Simon-Farallon deal, at $24 per share, is "superior" to Brookfield's pro­posed $21-per-share deal, valued at $1.35 billion. The board authorized Mills to end the Brookfield deal. 
Mills said in a statement that it will give Toronto-based Brookfield three days to top its previous offer, however, before it breaks the origi­nal agreement, signed Jan. 17. The company said it "is ready and willing to negotiate such an amendment" with Brookfield.

Top 10 w-orst Valentine's Day gifts to give a girl this year 
Valentine's Day is here once again. Many of you will spend this evening with your Valentine "same-side" dining at the dining hall, or if your boyfriend is lucky enough to have borrowed a roomie's car, enjoy­ing the oh-so-roman­tic atmosphere of Chili's, or perhaps even The Vine. If you are like me, however, you are most likely to be found pigging out on the box ofchoco­lates your mom sent you while watching "The Notebook" until your tear ducts run dry, alone in your room. Yet if you do fmd yourself single this Valentine's Day, fear not, for over the years I have dis­covered that on Valentine's Day, girl­friends are left unsatisfied, while their boyfriends are left in the doghouse because they cannot live up to their girl­friend's "unrealistic" expectations. That does not sound like "the Holiday of Love" to me. But being a girl myself, I understand a woman's expectations on Valentine's Day: they are not that high. Therefore, I have compiled a list of the Top Ten Worst Valentine's Day Gifts to Give a Girl this Year. This way, the fellas will know how not to end up in the dog­house, and unless I've missed a bad gift or two, the ladies will finally have a happy Valentine's Day. So men, read up,

and ladies ... you can thank me later. 
10. Anything that looks like it might have been purchased at a gas station­Sure, we all have a soft spot in our heart for last-minute spontaneity, but two packs of Big Hed and a Zippo lighter isn't exactly what we have in mind. 
9. Stale eandy-Candy is as much a part of Valentine's Day as the color red. That said, when we open up a box of choeolates and find three pieces miss­ing, two pieces cracked open in search of the caramel filled, and almost break a tooth on one of the remaining pieces, we're going to assume that you are sim­ply re-gifting the candy that you're ex­girlfriend gave you last year. 
8. Dinner on the cheap -Guys, Valentine's Day is not the time to call your girlfriend and say, "I know we had reservations at La Salle Grill, but I just found a ton of change in my car, and I could really go for some quarter dogs tonight." You may be thinking, "What guy would ever say that?" Well, the same thought just crossed my mind, but then I remembered I spent last year's Valentine's Day in the Huddle ... 
7. A Facebook gift-We all know you get one free gift to give. And while a lit­tle picture of a lava lamp or a bar of soap may appear to be the key to your lover's heart, trust me, it's not. 
6. A serenade -An exception will be made if your boyfriend can croon like Frank Sinatra. However, for the rest of us, if your guy shows up at your door dressed as Cupid and tries to belt out "My Funny Valentine," it's most likely going to end awkwardly for everyone involved. 
5. A membership to the local gym­There is a fairly good chance that you will end up in the doghouse if you use Valentine's Day as an opportunity to gently suggest that your Valentine could stand to lose a few pounds before spring break. 
4. A Lasercat-Unless your girl­friend's name is Dr. Scientist, a Lasercat should not be your Valentine's Day gift of choice, because after all, some will use Lasercats for good, and some will use them for evil ... 
3. A vacuum cleaner-Believe it or not, trying to pass cleaning supplies off as an acceptable gift will not result in us volunteering to come over and clean your dorm room on a weekly basis. 
2. An invitation to come over and watch "24" with your roommates-It's not that we don't like your friends. Really, they're great guys. It's just that we don't want to spend Valentine's Day in a crowded dorm room watching Jack Bauer bite someone in the neck while saving the world one hour at a time.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
From 'We need to talk,' the dialogue continues 
Proud to be from Saint Mary's 
I wrote an article about the Notre Dame football team in 2005 saying that I was proud of their sportsmanship. If I would have known it would have been used against me, I would have kept my mouth shut. 
I am a fourth generation Saint Mary's student, and that is some­thing I am proud of. I am proud to say that when I graduate with a chemistry degree, it will be from a nationally accredited program. I am proud to say that I know my physical chemistry teacher so well that I would gladly give up my football tickets to keep that close bond alive. Saint Mary's is more than being able to reap the perks of Notre Dame. I love the idea that I'll never step into a class that is over 30 people. I know my teachers to the point where I have been invited to their houses for dinner. I always feel that my voice will be heard. 
This may not be every Saint Mary's woman's case, but I know it is the majority. We're not all here for the football games or to be managers or to be in the marching band. Students can do that at any university. We are here for the education and environment we know Saint Mary's can provide us. Besides, if Notre Dame students are just using Saint Mary's for the education classes, O'Laughlin, and Semester Around the World, what is that guy doing in nurs­ing? And who was that in the calculus three course? And I'm pret­ty sure no girl here bench presses 300 pounds. There is a road connecting the two schools. They do not have to be under the same name for all students to take full advantage of the opportunities both schools have to offer. 
Lastly, go Kansas State football.

'Severing all ties' not the answer 
I graduated from Saint Mary's in 2005 and was a news writer for The Observer. Please don't kill me, girls (hear me out), but I think Jonathan Klingler's column ("Saint Mary's -We need to talk," Feb. 13) was a pretty good column. At least, it was well-written, well thought-out and not entirely one-sided. However, here are my opin­ions. · 
This issue is a matter of deep frustration for me and the majority of the Saint Mary's population. It's a struggle to legitimize our SMC-ness when, in fact, we do ass(')ciate ourselves so strongly with Notre Dame in many ways. I can't think of college without thinking of football, Notre Dame dorm/house parties, ski team (majority Notre Dame students), volunteering, eating in the Notre Dame dining hall; hell, outside of class I must have spent the majority of my college life across the street or with Notre Dame students. Even now I am attacked by the Notre Dame compari­son. 
We are supposed to justify why we are allowed these "rights" to "their" traditions, when we clearly did not get accepted or graduate from the same school. Well, true, Saint Mary's didn't agree to the terms of their merger. We want to hold on to our own identity. That's fme. But Saint Mary's also has to realize that it has to partly embrace the identity it has in Notre Dame as well. I think the label "Separate and Proud" opens the door to criticism and backlash, seeing as we enjoy so much of the Notre Dame culture. 
I'm proud to have been a Saint Mary's student. It was exactly what I wanted: my major, small classes, an excellent education. But can you imagine life without the school across the street? Some girls can't, and those girls transferred or found another school. But for those who thrive in the atmosphere that exists, they shouldn't be forced to "choose" one or the other. What is need­ed is not separate identities; Notre Dame and Saint Mary's need balance and an understanding. 
I don't know why I'm practically writing an edi­torial right now, but I'd hate to see us all rise up in revolt to throw rotten tomatoes across the street. It shouldn't have to come to that. If Saint Mary's is to remain separate, which it should, it needs to focus on its own unique strengths and not go head to head with the powerhouse that provides its students with so much opportunity or try to separate themselves even more. This shouldn't be a competition. 
So, I guess in all fairness, I appreciate opinions like this because the issue is one that won't go away and deserves addressing. I don't think it's a personal issue that Klingler has with Saint Mary's girls, but you know I'd say the same thing he did if Notre Dame was being hypocritical (taking pride in being separate yet clinging on to other traditions). I hope that, in the end, Saint Mary's will not be considered as tag-alongs, or as riding on the coat tails of Notre Dame, because we all know it's so much more than that. And all of our friends at Notre Dame would hopefully say the same thing. 
Anne Mahoney alumna Class of 2005 Feb. 13 

Saint Mary's alliance beneficial to both sides 
Notre Dame, it's your turn to listen. 
First and foremost, we understand why you feel taken advantage of by the stu­dents of Saint Mary's; however, we were under the impression that the Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and Holy Cross community hold a mutual relationship. You have not walked in the shoes of a Saint Mary's stu­dent-you have not seen how many of us have been mistreated while on the campus of "your" university for the sole reason that we are Saint Mary's students; you have not seen that although we participate in "your" clubs and activities, our partici­pation is limited because we are Saint Mary's students; you have not seen how hurt we were when our own sister school referred to us as a parasite of "your" uni­versity because we are Saint Mary's stu­dents. 
We support your sports, your publica­tions, your clubs and activities, your class­rooms, your traditions and heritage, and overall, your suc~ess. We give you the respect that we feel you deserve becaus'e you are a group of intelligent and hard­working college students. We smile with pride as we say, "I go to Saint Mary's, the school across the street from the University of Notre Dame." We love being a part of the community of Saint Mary's, Notre Dame and Holy Cross, and while many of you may think that we only want to be a part of your university because we "couldn't get in to Notre Dame," you could not be more wrong. 
We respect and honor you because the founders of both our colleges had a com­mon goal to educate men and women in a way in which they could learn to work and grow together -that is not the case today. Yes, we are given the opportunity to take classes at Notre Dame, but the number of students who actually t.ake classes is few. We are so busy with our own rigorous schedule and activities that it is very diffi­cult to find time or the opportunity to do so. 
While you disapprove of us taking classes across the street, we actually encourage you, Jonathan Klingler, to take full advan­tage of our classes, facilities and clubs. Our professors love to see new faces, hear new perspectives and teach anyone who is willing to put forth a great amount of effort. 
As far as our ability to purchase football tickets, we do not attend football games to see Brady Quinn and guys in tight l.mi­forms; we go because we have a genuine love for football. We know the players, the positions, the opponents, and some of us even know speCific plays. We wear head­to-toe apparel and we cheer as loud as we can. We ask you -the "best student body in the country" -would you rather have enthusiastic sports fans cheering in your student section, or mediocre fans who con­verse during the entire game? (Side note: Last season I was in section 63, the very last row in the student section, but I was too preoccupied cheering and doing push­ups to notice.) 
Saint Mary's students have a fond respect for the University and, in turn, we deserve the same. Our student body lead­ers use campaigns that exclaim, "Separate and Proud," because they realize we deserve a place that genuinely appreciates our intelligence as well as the contribu­tions we make to the College. If we are not receiving the same respect across the street why should we remain loyal when we are given the ultimatum, "choose whether [you] want to be 'separate and proud' or a part of Notre Dame." 
As much as we respect you, Notre Dame, we respect ourselves even m_ore to stand up for our dignity and our competence ... even if that means pulling away from something we love.

Klingler's column unfounded, unresearched 
This is in response to the unbiased and well-informed article writ­ten by Jonathan Klingler ("Saint Mary's-we need to talk," Feb. 13). I first wanted to thank Klingler for his intelligent analysis of the relationship between our two schools. 
Being a student at Saint Mary's, I was completely unaware of how much we were taking from the University, and I'd like to apologize for that. After all, students at Notre Dame certainly can't use our dining hall, our gym, participate in our activities, or join any of our clubs. That's obvious! And clearly the Notre Dame football ticket system must be rigged since SMC students get the better seats, despite paying more. So there is no way it could possibly be done randomly as we are all told. The students from Notre Dame that we Saint Mary's women see around campus must be illusions and not ­real people. They certainly wouldn't bother to participate in our Rome study abroad program and others, appear in our plays, and take classes here. I won't even bother mentioning that Klingler's own dorm, Keenan, must bring itself down by hosting its largest event, The Keenan Revue, on Saint Mary's campus. 
All that being said, I'd also like to thank Klingler for insulting an entire campus by using his poorly researched "facts," of which very few were correct, and clearly biased opinion. The elitist outlook he expressed is the kind of mindset that not only opposes the good rela­tionship our two schools have, but encourages more stereotyping of women here at Saint Mary's and perpetuates the silent rivalry between the women at both schools. 
More than that, though, I pity him. I pity Klingler because by writ­ing off an entire school he is missing out on around 1.500 opportuni­ties which he now undoubtedly misses out on of his own free will. This isn't referring to dates or "hook-ups" as I'm sure many are thinking. These opportunities are in getting to know and understand the women of Saint Mary's, and, in so doing, understanding better what makes our school "separate and proud" while still holding on to the traditions that created us. By saying that Saint Mary's needs to either sever all ties with the University or merge completely, Klingler forgets that he would be destroying a huge part of what makes the three schools in Notre Dame, Ind. so unique. His ridicu­lous accusations and unfair assumptions would destroy part of the identity that not only makes us the No. 1 Women's College in the Midwest (a fact which he failed to mention in Tuesday's article), but also mak~s his school the "top-20 undergraduate institution" it is.

TEN SONGS FOR THE ROMANTICALLY INCLINED 
Whether you're planning on celebrating this Valentine's Day by bringing sexy back or just engaging in some hardcore hand-hold­ing, it never hurts and can help in a lot of ways to have some mood-setting musical ambience as you spend some quality time with your significant other.

Tae Andrews 

"Complicated"-Avril Lavigne 
As a teeny-bopper wannabe-rock star, Avril Assistant Lavigne is clearly the heir apparent to angry female Scene Editor artists such as Alanis Morisette, poised and ready in the wings to take over the title of "Most Disgruntled Female Star on the Planet." This heartfelt track goes into depth about the complexities of trying to reconcile adolescent romance with the social challenges of being cool. 
"You Are So Last Summer" -Taking Back Sunday 
Nothing says, "this relationship is over and I'm in no way bitter at all" than using some valley-girl speak to tell off your ex. Using such lyrics as "You could slit my throat I And with my one last gasping breath I'd apologize for bleeding on your shoes," this song will be sure to keep that tail droopy, Eeyore. Remember, you can't spell "mope" without "e-m-o." 
"Ain't No Sunshine" -Bill Withers 
This track by the serendipitously-named Bill Withers will let you feel right at home as you wither and waste away in your dorm room. Interestingly enough, "Ain't No Sunshine" could also be a fitting com­ment to describe the current fresh-air situation here on campus. Seasonal Affective Disorder? Singles Awareness Day? Coincidence? Probably not. Either way, you're SAD. 
"My Paper Heart" -The All-American Rejects 
Feeling insecure in your relationship? Time to embrace some emo. Take refuge with these Rejects, who not only revel in their exalted loser status, but feel compelled enough to share their lack of luck in love with the rest of the free world. 
"Let Her Cry" -Hootie and the Blowfish 
Sometimes the best way to get over a painful breakup is to take it out on the next person who has the misfortune of crossing paths with you. So here's to letting her down hard, gentlemen. 
"Jude Law and a Semester Abroad"-Brand New 
Girlfriend studying abroad? Take comfort by celebrating your inse­curities with this song, in which college-aged frat boys wax poetic about the pain of their unrequited love from overseas ex-girlfriends. 
"Layia" -Eric Clapton 
Despite your Facebook stalking and awkward forays on the quad, does that special someone in your life rebuff your every advance? Enter "Layla," Eric Clapton's song about the most famously ruthless female of all time. So the next time you find that your unicorn has "got you on your knees," feel a sense of compatriotism with Mr. Clapton. 
"I Want You To Want Me" -Cheap Trick 
This one's pretty straightforward, but unlike the kill-yourself ethos of the emo genre, the song manages to stay fairly upbeat with a hip, old-school rock sentiment. Play this track if you're trying to say, "I like you, but I'm not desperate." 
"Respect" -Aretha Franklin 
The anthem of scorned women everywhere, this classic simultane­ously allows women to stand up for themselves while expressing female solidarity, much as the Spice Girls did several decades later with their hit, "If You Wanna Be My Lover." If you're looking for a little added backbone, feel free to throw this one on and feel better about yourself. 
"Cry Me A River" -Justin Timberlake 
Perhaps nothing speaks more about unreturl).ed romance than the poppy sensibilities of a former boy band head honcho. Best of all, lis­tening to the high-pitched mourning of JT will allow you to bust out some sweet choreography to Timbaland's unique beats. As the saying goes, cry yourself a river, then build a bridge and get over it.

'MISS SUNSHINE,' THE 'LITTLE' FILM THAT COULD 
By BRIAN DOXTADER 
Scene Editor 

Editor's Note: This is the third in a five­part series on the 2007 Oscar nominees for Best Picture. 
"Little Miss Sunshine" is the Little Movie That Could, a small film that flew under the radar upon its initial release, but gradually gained steam to become this year's dark horse Best Picture nomi­nee. 
There seems to be one every year ­the film whose very nomination is a bit perplexing, who seems overmatched and undermanned in the furious race for cin­ema's biggest prize. "Little Miss Sunshine" garnered a nod over bigger and more visible films like "Dreamgirls" (the leader of the pack in terms of pure numbers, with eight nods) and "Children of Men." 
For some reason, the Academy really likes to throw in one of these kinds of films every year. Consider some of the Best Picture nominees over the past decade: "Chocolat" (2000). "In the Bedroom" (2001). "The Cider House Rules" (1999). "Elizabeth" (1998), and "The Full Monty" (1997). None of these films had the clout and marketing power of the bigger studio productions and each was doomed almost from the start to be an also-ran. 
So why, without fail, does the Academy nominate a film that has almost no chance of winning? Well, history has proven that these kinds of films actually do have a slim chance of winning. The appeal with a film like "Little Miss Sunshine," which isn't being marketed as hard as some of the bigger pictures in the race (including the no-show "Dreamgirls") is that it allows voters to "discover" it on their own without being told to like it. It's the same kind of appeal that drove the last two Best Picture win­ners, Paul Haggis' "Crash" and Clint Eastwood's "Million Dollar Baby," respectively. Neither of those two films had much Oscar buzz in the early going ("Crash" was even released in the sum­mer, an almost definite sign that it was­n't being considered for the awards sea­son), but the buzz gradually gained momentum and hit its apex on Oscar night -before any backlash could befall it. 
Those two wins indicate that there's something of a shift in mentaiity -the "Miramax Marketing Machine," which so succe·ssfuily used snob appeal to drive "The English Patient" (1996) and "Shakespeare in Love" to Best Picture wins, has come up empty in the past few years. Oversaturation of the last two Scorsese pies, "Gangs of New York" (2002) and "The Aviator" (2004), led to a backlash that cost the films (and some say Scorsese as well) come Oscar night. 
Unlike the Best Actor and Best Actress races, which seem to be sewn up well before Oscar night, there really aren't very many guarantees in the Best Picture race. Upsets happen, and with startling frequency. Neither "Crash" nor "Million Dollar Baby" nor "Shakespeare in Love" were the favorites walking in the door, and it seemed almost inconceivable at the time that they would topple the jug-gernauts that were "Brokeback Mountain," "The Aviator" and "Saving Private Ryan," respectively. 

If "Little Miss Sunshine" wins the Best Picture Oscar on February 25, it will indeed be an upset, but perhaps not as big an upset as people will make it. With no clear frontrunner, it's entirely possible that "The Departed" and "Babel" will split the vote, allowing a smaller fllm like "Little Miss Sunshine" to slip through the cracks and take home the top prize. 
Is it probable? No. But it wouldn't be the first time that an upstart fllm came from left field to be named the Best Picture. Just ask Clint Eastwood or Paul Haggis.

ECLECTIC CAST GAINS CRITICAL ACCLAIM 
By MARTY SCHROEDER Assistant Scene Editor 

"Little Miss Sunshine" stole the hearts of millions with its quirky humor about a, dysfunctional family riding across the country in an aged, yellow VW Bus. While the film itself represents some of the best of American art-house cinema, the cast is composed of Hollywood vet­erans, staples of comedy and newcom­ers whose stars are rising. Alan Arkin, Steve Carell and Abigail Breslin fill these labels and headline the cast of this impressive riff on pre-teen beauty pageants. 
Alan Arkin 
The multi-talented Alan Arkin has acted, directed and composed literature and music for longer than most of the rest of the cast has been able to say "Oscar." He starred in films such as "Catch-22" and "Edward Scissorhands" and even made an appearance on the children's staple "Sesame Street" in the early 1970s. He is nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor due to his outstanding performance as the heroin-addicted Grandpa in "Little Miss Sunshine." However, this is not the first time acting accolades have come his way. 

In his first screen appearance as Lt. Rozanov in the 1966 film "The Russians are Coming, the Russians are Coming," Arkin became one of only five men to be nominated for Best Actor in their debut performance. He went on to star as Bill in the Tim Burton classic "Edward Scissorhands," and played George Aaronow in the film adaptation of David Mamet's Pulitzer Prize winning stage play "Glengarry Glen Ross." With this resume, Arkin was perhaps the most highly regarded actor in "Little Miss Sunshine." 
Steve arell 
Most know this rising star as Michael Scott, the boss on the American version of "The Office." His goofy antics have graced films such as "Bruce Almighty" and "Anchorman." But in "Little Miss Sunshine," he took a page out of "Bruce" co-star Jim Carrey's book and took on a more serious, dramatic role as the gay Proust scholar, Uncle Frank. Although funny at times, this role allowed Carell the dramatic space to explore a character more complex than any of his previous roles. 
With his breakout role in "The Office," Carell won a Golden Globe for the Best Performance by an Actor in a TV Series Musical or Comedy in 2006 and was nominated for the same cate­gory in 2007. He was also nominated for an Emmy in the equivalent category in 2006. After getting his start as a cor­respondent on "The Daily Show" and working with comedic greats like Jim Carrey and Will Ferrell, Carell has at last found his own niche where he can thrive. 
Abigail Breslin 
For her portrayal of Olive Hoover in "Little Miss Sunshine," 10-year-old Abigail Breslin has become the fourth youngest actress to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She earlier appeared in films such as Mel Gibson's "Signs" and "The Princess Diaries 2." Even at such a young age, Breslin has earned the respect of fellow actors such as Arkin and Greg Kinnear for her work in "Little Miss Sunshine." Although this rising star does not yet have many credits-to her name, she will be an actress to watch in the coming years. 
Arkin, Carell and Breslin anchor this cast and give the strongest performanc­es in "Little Miss Sunshine," but the other actors, including Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette and Paul Dana also do admirable jobs. Together, they combine to form the engine which has propelled "Little Miss Sunshine" to the brink of Oscar glory.

Associated Press 
DAYfONA BEACH, Fla. ­NASCAR vowed last sum­mer to crack down on cheaters, pledging to toughen penalties in a sport where bending the rules is as common as banging bumpers. 
Officials made good on that promise Tuesday. 
NASCAR suspended the crew chiefs for Matt Kenseth, Kasey Kahne, Scott Riggs and Elliott Sadler and docked all four drivers points before the season-opening Daytona 500 its strongest statement to date on cheating. 
All four cars failed quali­fying inspection, and a fifth, Michael Waltrip's startup Toyota Camry, faces additional penalties that could be even more severe. 

"It'_s obvious that we've ramped up our penalties and we're going to get peo­ple's attention," competi­tion director Robin Pemberton said. "We're going to grab this one by the horns." 
Robbie Reiser, crew chief for Kenseth, and Kenny Francis, crew chief for Kahne, were suspended four races. Rodney Childers, crew chief for Riggs, and Josh Brown, crew chief for Sadler, were suspended two races.

IN BRIEF 

Barber ends NFL career, set to 
join NBC's 'Today' Show 

NEW YORK -Former NFL running back and new "Today" show corre­spondent Tiki Barber said his offsea­son work at Fox News Channel made him recognize he had a passion for a career outside of sports. 
Barber also said his problems with New York Giants head coach Tom Coughlin had "started to take its toll on me." 
The just-retired NFL running back was formally introduced as an NBC Universal employee Tuesday. He'll con­tribute news and human interest sto­ries to "Today," and he'll be an analyst on NBC's Sunday highlight show "Football Night in America" in the fall. 
He spurned offers from Fox and ABC/Disney to take the NBC job. "My dream has always been to be on the "Today" show," Barber said. 
Barber, 31, retired as a Pro Bowl running back, scoring a touchdown in the NFL all-star game last weekend. 
are teammates at Evernham Motorsports. Kenseth, the 2003 series champion and runner-up last season, drives for Roush Racing. 
All four crew chiefs can appeal, a process that could allow them to work the Great American Race. If they do and the commit· tee cannot schedule a hearing before Sunday's race, they would be allowed to participate. 
But Roush Racing already has a replacement for Reiser, and said the 500 will be the first race he has missed since the team's inception in 1999 -a stretch of 255 races.

Allen?. Qkur chosen to play in 
NBA: i\11-Star Game 
NEW YORK-Seattle's Ray Allen and Utah's Mehmet Okur were cho­sen Tuesday by commissioner David Stern as injury replacements for the All-Star game. 
With Steve Nash (shoulder) and Allen Iverson (ankle) both pulling out of Sunday's game in Las Vegas, the Western Conference was in need of a guard. Allen is seventh in the league with 26.9 points per game. 
Okur's clutch late-game play has helped Utah keep rolling despite the absence of Carlos Boozer, who was chosen for the All-Star game but also was forced to pull out because of a hairline fracture in his leg. That had left the Jazz, whose 34-17 record is third-best in the league, without a player in Sunday's game. 
Allen is headed to his fourth straight All-Star game and seventh overall. Okur is a first-time selec­tion 
not appeal because delay­ing the suspension could cause them to miss the debut of the Car of Tomorrow at Bristol Motor Speedway in March. 
In toughening its penal­ties, NASCAR made the unprecedented move of taking points away before the season has even start­ed. Kahne and Kenseth were docked 50 points apiece, while Riggs and· Sadler lost 25 each. 
Reiser and Francis also were fined $50,000 each, while Childers and Brown were fined $25,000 each. 
All four drivers will start the season with negative points a move that most likely infuriated the team.

CHAMPAIGN, Ill.-Brian Carlwell, one of two Illinois basketball players injured when their car went ofT the road and slammed into a tree on Monday night, is improving and could move into a regular hospital room soon, according to a University of Illinois spokesperson. 
Carlwell is expected to move out of intensive care on Tuesday night. He suffered a severe concussion in the single-car accident, according to Illinois spokesperson Kent Brown. 
Teammate Jamar Smith, who was driving, had a concussion as well. He was treated and released and, according to reports, should be fine physically. 
Illinois coach Bruce Weber spent the night in the hospital with Carlwell, a 6-foot-11 freshman cen­ter. 
"We just hope and pray Brian is going to be OK," Weber said.

Belles prepare for Albion 
Conference foes to square offagain after overtime battle last month 
By DAN COOPER Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's will look to avenge its Jan. 17 overtime loss to Albion at 7:30 tonight at the Angela Athletic Center. 
Since that loss, the Belles are 5-1 and have worked their way to third in the MIAA with a 10-11 overall record and a 9-5 league mark. 
Albion, which is riding a two game winning streak, is 13-9 and 8-6, respectively. 
"We definitely have our hands full. They are a good team and they're on a roll," Belles coach Jennifer Henley said. "We're going to try to win the boards and limit their second chance opportu­nities." 
In its last meeting with Saint Mary's, Albion had a balanced offensive attack that showcased four double­digit scoring efforts. Three starters had 11 or more points, including junior for­ward Jessica Babcock, who scored 19. Sophomore for­ward Kati Till added 14 points off the bench. 
The Britons out-rebounded the Belles and shot a higher percentage from the floor en route to a 72-69 victory. 
"Babcock's a lot like [Belles guard Alison] Kessler. She will always get her points. We need to keep her below her average and limit the rest of the team," Henley said. 
Kessler had one of her best 
ND WOMEN'S TENNIS 

Irish get set to take on trio of ranked teains 

games on the season in the loss to the Britons. She was 12-of-22 from the floor with 31 points, four steals and three assists. Senior guard Bridget Lipke had a solid game with 12 points and 10 assists and freshman for­ward Anna Kammrath pulled down a game-high 12 rebounds. 
Albion has continued its winning ways since the last meeting, and the Belles had already matured by the time they first faced Albion. The Belles had a strong, balanced performance in their last game against Albion so the "we've improved s-ince then" pep talk that has worked for Henley all year does not apply. 
Regardless, Henley said Saint Mary's should enter this game with confidence knowing it played AI bion close in their last meeting and this time it has home court advantage. 
"We haven't played well our last two games and we need to get back on track," she said. "It will be nice to have a game at home because we have played well at home all year."

No. 2 Notre Dame hosts No. 23 Michigan to kick off a tough three-match home stand today at the Eck Tennis Pavilion at 4 p.m. 
"Michigan is always a good team to play because you know they're going to play hard and fair," Notre Dame coach Jay Louderback said. "It should be a really good match. They're undefeated and they beat Vanderbilt, Oregon, and 
Washington,  which  are  all  
quality teams."  
Michigan  senior  Jenny  

Kuehn, a fifth-year transfer from Tulane, leads the Wolverines with a spotless dual-match record this season. 
"[KuehnJ has a lot of experi­ence," Louderback said. "She played No. 1 and No. 2 singles at Tulane, and they were a top-20 team when she was there." 
After Michigan, No. 7 North Carolina {9-2) and No. 20 Wake Forest (4-0) will travel to South Bend for matches on Friday and Sunday, respective­ly. The Irish (6-1) are accus­tomed to playing highly ranked teams in a short time span. Two weeks ago at the ITA National Team Indoor Tournament, Notre Dame knocked off No. 13 Clemson, No. 10 Baylor and No. 6 Northwestern in consecutive days before falling to No. 3 Georgia Tech in the finals. 
"[The experience at the ITA] is really going to help, espe­cially against Michigan and Wake Forest," Louderback said. "They're just going through the tough part of their schedule now and they haven't gone through what we have, but North Carolina has." 

A key factor in Notre Dame's success has been its ability to capture the doubles point at the beginning of every match. The only time this season the Irish failed to capture the dou­bles point was in their loss against Georgia Tech. 
But even if Notre Dame does start the match ahead 1-0, Louderback says the Irish still have to remain cautious. 
"The thing that'll be interest­ing with Michigan is that they're 3-0, but they haven't won the doubles point yet," Louderback said. "So they struggle in the doubles but then they've come out and at least won four singles match­es." 
On the singles side, Irish freshman Cosmina Ciobanu has won all seven of her sin­gles matches this season while Catrina Thompson has gone 5­
2. No. 31 Colleen Rielley will try to halt a three-match los­ing streak against the Wolverines. 
"We've just had her hit a lot of balls. She just needs her confidence back. She's just had some tight matches and played pretty well," Louderback said. "The more she plays at the top of our lineup and gets more experience, she'II be fine."

Nixon said. "We have a lot to look forward to in addition to the Big East." 
Such confidence should not be mistaken for a lack of respect for the 11 teams who will be trying to break Notre Dame's strangle­hold on the Big East Championships, Nixon said. 
"I feel like every year there's always some team that's gunning to take us down," senior Jessica Stephens said. "When you're on top, you always have to watch out because there's some team trying to knock you down." 
When asked who she expected that team to be this year, Stephens selected No. 22 Rutgers -an unsurprising pick given that the Scarlet Knights have fin­ished as the runner-up to Notre Dame in five of the previous seven Big East Championships. 
This season, Rutgers has com­piled a dual meet record of 6-1. The only blemish on the Scarlet Knights' dual meet resume came at the hands of No. 15 Penn State who defeated them 195­105 Jan. 20. 
The other team that could pose a threat to Notre Dame is West Virginia. Although the Irish defeated the Mountaineers earli­er this season 22~50-147.50 at the Shamrock Invitational, Nixon said West Virginia is a rapidly improving squad. 
"The West Virginia coach has done a great job recruiting since he took over two years ago," Nixon said of Mountaineers coach Sergio Gomez. "I don't know if they have the depth to compete with us, but they're up and coming." 
While the Mountaineers are a young team on the rise, the Irish are an experienced team full of confidence from previous suc­cess at the Big East Championship. Notre Dame will be led by senior captain Katie Carroll, a three-time NCAA tour-and Notre Dame's 
freshmen have been up to the challenge so far this season. 
Andrew Deters (1,650-yard freestyle), John Lytle (1 00­yard freestyle) and MacKenzie LeBlanc (200-yard fly) all hold the fastest team times in their respective events. Welsh described the role these swim­mers would play this weekend as pivotal. 
"We have a lot of freshmen in key positions," Welsh said. "We just want our freshmen to do what we want all our other guys to do, something we've been working towards all sea­son, and that's swim lifetime bests."

nament qualifier. In her three trips to the Big East Championship, Carroll has amassed 11 Big East titles and 21 Big East honors. She was the named the Big East Championships' most outstand­ing swimmer in 2004. 
In addition to Carroll, the Irish will lean on the experience of junior Caroline Johnson, an eight-time Big East champion, senior Julia Quinn, the champion in the 200 breaststroke at the 2006 Championships, and soph­omore Christa Riggins, an all-Big East performer in five events her freshman year. 
"I think it's crucial, and I think it's a big part of how much suc­cess we've had," Nixon said, referring to her team's past suc­cess at the Big East Championships. "It gives you a lot of confidence in what you're doing, and it helps you know what it takes to win."

D'Amico, who had totaled just eight points her last five games and was riding a three-game streak without a field goal, bounced back with 15 points in 18 minutes. 
On the defensive end, Notre Dame forced 20 turnovers, resulting in 22 Irish points. It was the 18th time in 25 games that Notre Dame has forced 20 or more turnovers. 
"We did a good job of get­ting turnovers and turning those into points at the other end," McGraw said. "Our transition offense is where we were able to break the game open," 
Villanova had no such defensive prowess. The· Irish turned the ball over only 8 times, a season low. 
Notre Dame led 34-25 at the half, and Allen had scored 15 of her 25 points on 7 -of-1 0 shooting 
"I thought we executed well, especially on the offen­sive end of the floor," McGraw said. 
In the second half, Villanova closed the gap, at one point trailing by 3. Forwards Stacie Witman and Jackie Adamshick, who led the Wildcats with 16 points each, combined for 12 quick points in the first five min­utes after the break. 
But after that point, the Irish steadily increased their lead, due in part to their abil­ity to get to the free throw line. Notre Dame made 10-of­14 free throws, while Villanova finished 4-of-6. 
Irish freshman Ashley Barlow started her second consecutive game and scored 15 points. Although the fresh­man did not make a field goal until 12 minutes into the sec­ond half, McGraw said Barlow's defense and stamina during her 38 minutes on the floor was a big part of the win. Barlow was also 5-for-7 from the charity stripe. 
For the second consecutive game, the Irish had four players in double figures. Senior guard Breona Gray rounded out the group, scor­ing 10 points and sinking both 3-pointers she attempt­ed.

Piane sends runners to Windsor to i111prove 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Sports Writer 
Practice makes perfect. 

At least that's what Irish coach Joe Piane was thinking when he decided to send com­petitors to the Windsor Team Challenge Saturday. Even though the Irish did not quali­fy any additional competitors for the Big East champi­onships, which start this weekend, they improved their times in a competitive atmos­phere. 
"We had a couple of per­formances improve, like Jose [Genao] and Domenique Manning in the 60 [meter dash]," assistant coach John Millar said. "But in the most part it was more of a meet that we were using to prepare for this weekend and just give them a chance to compete away from the Loftus Center." 
The Irish women excelled once again in the sprints, tak­ing the top three spots in the 60-meter and 300-meter runs. In the 60, senior Maryann Erigha won the event, fol­lowed by juniors Brienne Davis and Manning. Freshman Joanna Schultz placed first for the Irish in the 300 with sen­ior Okechi Ogbuokiri and jun­ior Crysta Swayzer taking the second and third spots. 
Manning also took first in the 60 meters, while the Irish women won the 800-meter relay. 
"Overall for the women, the ones that competed here ran pretty well. And most of them ran pretty close to their sea­sonal best," Millar said. "But they ran better than last year at the same time so I felt real­ly good about that." 
On the men's side, the Irish were equally impressive. Genao set a seasonal best mark Saturday in the 60 meters while senior Jordan Powell set his own personal best in the 300 meters. 
The Irish won the 600-meter in convincing fashion, with juniors Austin Wechter and Robert Kueny taking first and second, respectively. 
Even though no one from the limited Irish squad qualified for the Big East champi­onships, the Irish still consid­ered the weekend a success. Going into the tournament, Piane said the main goal was to taper some of the runs for qualified runners in order to give them a little extra prepa­ration for the conference meet this weekend. This meant many of the races Notre Dame competed in, such as the 300­meter sprint and the 800­meter relay, are not Big East events. Millar also said the main goal was to help get the team ready for the Big East. 
"It was mainly a group of sprinters and quarter-miters and that sort of thing," Millar said. "But I think overall it was successful from the stand­point of preparing them for the conference meet and just getting one last competitive opportunity."

Notre Dame was choosy but effective with its outside shooting, making 3-of-5 on the night. Villanova, by con­trast, took 19 3-pointers and made only four. 
Notre Dame improved to 17-8 overall and 8-4 in the Big East. The win was the second conference road win for the Irish this season.

Lawyers give opening statelllents in Weis suit 
Coach alleges botched surgery; defense denies carelessness by doctors 
Associated Press 
BOSTON -Doctors failed to recognize life-threatening complications after Notre Dame coach Charlie Weis' gas­tric bypass surgery, allowing him to bleed internally for more than a day, his lawyer said Tuesday at the start of the coach's malpractice trial. 
Weis had the surgery in June 2002 while he was offensive coordinator for the New England Patriots. He weighed 350 pounds and has said he wanted a permanent solution to years of weight problems, both for his family's well being and to improve his chances of becoming a head coach. 
Weis alleges that Massachusetts General Hospital surgeons Charles Ferguson and Richard Hodin acted negligently and left Weis 


so close to death that he received the Roman Catholic sacrament of last rites. 
The doctors maintain they did nothing wrong. 
Weis had difficulty breathing in the early morning a day after his June 14 surgery, his lawyer, Michael Mone, said in an opening statement in Suffolk Superior Court. On June 16, doctors performed a much more invasive surgery to fix problems caused by the ini­tial procedure. 
"For more than 30 hours, Mr. Weis continued to bleed," Mone said. 
Ferguson performed the sur­gery on a Friday, then left for the weekend. Hodin was charged with caring for Ferguson's patients while the doctor was gone, and per­formed the follow-up surgery on a Sunday. 
William J. Dailey Jr., an attorney for the doctors, told jurors the doctors acted appro­priately and that Weis was believed to be in good condi­tion the morning of the second procedure. 
"There was no carelessness," Dailey said. "Unfortunately, Mr. Weis experienced one of the complications that is known to exist."

Irish win fourth straight 
ND forces 20 Villanova turnovers, cruises to 75-58 road victory 
By BILL BRINK Sports Writer 
A tough defensive per­formance and strong play by center Melissa D'Amico and guard Charel Allen led Notre Dame to its fourth straight win, 75-58 at Villanova Tuesday. 
"It's always a difficult place to play, at Villanova," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said during her post-game press conference. "We were fortunate to come out with a victory tonight." 
The Irish started out hot, taking a 6-0 lead, but the Wildcats battled back to lead the game 11-8. 
That would be the last lead they would have. 
Jump-started by an Allen 3-pointer, Notre Dame went on an 11-point run and never looked back. 
Allen came out firing, scoring 13 of her 25 points in the first eight minutes of the game. She also took ­and made -the only Irish 3-point attempt of the first half. 
"I thought Charel Allen played an exceptional game tonight," McGraw said.
