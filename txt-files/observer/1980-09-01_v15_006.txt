Ten hostages held aboard a Braniff Airways jetliner in Lima,Peru, returned here yesterday aboard the same plane which wasseized by Cuban refugees for 23 hours at Lima'sJorge ChavezAirport. The returning travelers,who were met at Los Angeles InternationalAirport by family members and friends, said theircaptors did not mistreat or. threaten them during the ordeal.The incident began Friday &rhen about 400 Cubans smashed throughglass doors at the Lima Airport and swarl?ed onto the runway. TheBr~niff jetliner, en route to Los Angeles, was taken over by 168 Cubans who demanded to be flown to the United States. 
A fire blamed on boys playing with matches burned out of control for a sixth day yesterday after consuming more than 21,000acres of brush and timber and causing an estimated $250,000 damage to homes on Mount SanJacinto above Palm Springs, Calif. Authorities would not predict when they might contain the blaze, which was being battled by more than 1,000 firefighters and which has led to 14 firefighters receiving minor injuries. "It's about 40 percent contained now, but we're not predicting full con­tainment,"said California Department of Forestry fire in­formation officer Fred Snow. "The containment is not concentrated on a particular side, which is sort of our problem-the fire really dependson what the wind does," Snow explained. On Saturday, the fire damaged or destroyed six winter homes in the Andreas Canyon onthe Eastern flank of the mountain.

Although he learned how to handle a wind surfboard only a little more than a year ago, the tall, muscular Frenchman has chalked up two long voyages since then. He "sailed" across 850 blistering miles of the Sahara Desert on a windsurf skate board in a 56-hour trip in March1979. Five months later he crossed the icy waters of the Bering Strait, between Alaska and Siberia, in eight hours."What you want to do is feel very humble and justacceptand use any element thatyou can take to go faster and faster and the farthest," de Rosnay said.

"Oil inventories in some Europeannations have now reached the equivalent of 120 days' supplywhileJapan is at a record 110 days and rising, and the United States at about 75 days," it said.The newsletter attributed the surplus to high levels ofSaudi oil outputandan "unexpectedly sharp drop" in Western oil demand following a 132 percent jump in world oil prices since ~he beginningof 1979.

Half asleep while one of the other editors drove, I looked out the window on what appeared to be a beautiful morning,but after a full night at the paper I could hardly be blamed for not fully appreciting it. Yet, just before I could fall asleep, something did catch my half­closed eye. 
Tied to the trees in front of every main building down the highway was a yellow ribbon. I also recalled seeing them tied·to trees along Saint Mary's Avenue, but never really took note. But here they were-not in the hundreds ofcourse, more like a respectable 20 or 30, but enough to wake me up and ask, "What are these things?" "For the hostages, it started in Battle Creek Mich. and spread around," was th_e reply. 
Everyone has heard the song-"Tie a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree" released some seven years ago. Granted, it was about a man returing from prison wanting to know ifhis girl still wanted him, andconsidering the hostages committed no crime and yet are being held prisoner, there is some comparison in that respect. But what the yellow ribbon tied to a tree now means as a result of that song, is"We want you back." 
On the return trip from the printer, I was still pondering the yellow ribbons and what they meant, when we approached the viaduct c;rossing 31 just before Angela. Written on the columns in spray paint were the words,".F-­Iran." 
Ordinarily I hate grafi:tti; it's so destructive and often vulgar -which this message was, except that this comment, made as an answer to the hostage crisis, shows more than just juvenile delinquency. 
This person had to be very, very angry to write those words and by this anger, he also must have cared a great deal.His words are now a daily reminder to anyone who travels US 31 that Iran is causing us trouble and still has52 of our people hostage.

One hostage has returned. In Chicago I read a quiet story on page five that said Richard Queen had been well treated by Iran and would be all right. 
Here it is folks-Campaign Year, filled with promises and speeches and plans to build a better America. The conventions were held and the rats for the Rat Race ofall rat races have been picked. 52 Americ.ans are still being held hostage and not one word has been said by anyone at either convention or in the campaign about getting them freed.Not one word! 
This should be a major issue. Reagan should be able to do wonders with it, saying, "See how Carter has messed up!"And Carter should be saying things like,"l'll have them home by Christmas!" Actually, I don't care what they 
say, I just wish they'd say something. 
Why isn't anything being done or said? Why did the rescue attempt fail? (Sorry, I can't buy sand in the engines.) Why did Carter even wait 
~ so long? Why is no one saying anything!? National security? Come on. Have we for­gotten all the classic leaks thatshould have been hushed in that hallowed name, but weren't? Label something national security and chances are greater that someone will find out about it. 
I wish I knew what was going on. But I don't. And no one else seems to know either. But you know what I'm really afraid of? The less we hear about it, the more apathetic we will become and our countrymen could remain hostage forever with nothing ever being done in the name of "national security." If they are not freed soon it soon it will be the fault of the American people for falling asleep.Like I almost did before I saw the yellow ribbons, and the angry message on the viaduct column to "F--Iran."

(continuedfrom page 1] 
the beginning of this year when we passed that balanced bud­get, we would have about a $25 billion surplus instead of a deficit, but when people are out of work, they're not paying 
taxes, they're drawing unem­ployment compensation and. welfare which increased expen­ses. So what we hope is that by spending that money in the tax cut, we get the economy turned right now, about 6.2 percent unemployment, that we had at around, we get people put back to work, so that really we have a better chance of balancing the budget than when they're outof work. 
Q: Are the Democrats unified now? Do you think that there was any split caused by the Carter-Kennedy rift that will carry over into the fall campaign, or is everything patched up and are the Kennedy people readyto go behind Carter? 
A:I don't know. My judgement is that there was a deep division between Kennedy and Carter supporters, that went beyond personalities, it went to pro­grams and substance.With this new economic plan, I think the President has accepted some of Sen. Kennedy's ideas. He hasn't gone as far as Sen. Kennedy wanted, but I think Sen. Kennedy has responded and is enthusiastically supporting President Carter now. To an­swer your other question, I think that some of that hard feeling is still there. How long itwilllast, I don't know. I think the thing that will come closest to healing the divisions within the Democratic party, more than anything else, is Ronald 
Reagan. When he comes out and tells what a glorious war Vietnam was,right away you have about all the Kennedy Democrats saying 'wait a min­ute, I'm not going ·to vote for somebody like that'. When he talks abouthow unemployment compensation is a welfare va­cation for loafers, you got a lot of other people saying 'wait a minute, I'm not going to vote for a fellow like that'. When he can't determine whether you have one, two or three China policies, then you're going to have people who are concerned about a lot of things, won­dering, 'Dowe want a man like that in the White House?' I think that is one thing that President Carter has going for him, and that the Democrats have going for us, to unify our party against a man who is representing the other party. I think there're going to be more and more Democrats who are dissatisfied or disenchanted with President Carter who will say, 'Well wait, I'm not going to throw my vote away on a third 

· party candidate, and I'm sure not going to vote for Ronald Reagan, and I'm not going to stay home.' I know I don't agree with some of the things that President Carter has done; I think this high interest rate/ tight money policy was abso­lutely asmme. That's Republican economics, that's the same thing that Nixon and Ford three times in eight years, and we got three recessions. So why wouldn't you get it if a Democrat uses it. It doesn't make any sense. There should

has prompted enthusiasm from both businesses and students. Local realtors have already con­tacted Method and expressed their interest in the project. 
"The Mall is a convenient place for students to buy things for their rooms, and they don't have to go offcampus," Method commented. 
Though this yearis the Mall's first, Method hopes to com­mence a tradition. He believes "everyone wins" with the Mall: retailers make money; students benefit from convenience,and the Services Commission makes a profit.The profit is then fed back to students when SU allocates funds to deserving clubs and organizations on campus. 
Students expressed their en­thusiasm over the Mall.Com­ments ranged from "It's nice" to "I'm glad I can get shelving without the hassle of going off campus." 
One student, however, did comment that he thought prices were "steep" and said he wished the Mall sold used items. 
A spokesman for Interior Concepts commented that his firm plans to return next year "for sure."

Rajai appoints new cabinet in Iran 
,l 

by the Associated Press 
Iran's prime minister yester­day named a new Cabinet-the country's first since the take­over of the U. S.Embassy in Tehran almost 10 months ago. 
U. S. officials hope the appoint­ments will speed the release of the 52 American hostages. 
Several of those named by Mohammad Ali Rajai, the Iran­ian prime minister, were edu­cated in the United States and other Western nations. Many, including some who lived in the West, were said to have close ties to the hard-line Islamic Republican pa£ty that controls Parliament and were foes of the U.S.-backed Shah of Iran. 
Hossein Musavi Khameneie, nominated to become Iran's minister of foreign affairs, was described by the official Iranian news agency Pars as being a member of the central com­mittee of Islamic Republican Party and the editor of the party's newspaper. He was re­ported to have been arrested in 1973 by SAVAK, the shah's 
secret  police,for  activities  a­ 
gainst  the  then  all-powerful  
monarch.

Another appointee, Seyyed Asadollah Lajevardi, named minister ofcommerce, was -re­ported by Pars to have been tortured in prison for his pol­itical activites against the late monarch. 
The news agency said Rajai announced the appointments in a letter to Hashemi Rafsan­jani, speaker of the Majlis, or Parliament.Parliament is ex­pected to act on thein this week. ­
The speaker had been quoted as saying the legislators would spend this week considering the Cabinet appointments, then begin the hostage debate. No new defense minister was named. 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Kho­memt, Iran's revolutionary leader, has ordered the Parli­ament to consider the 302-day­old hostage issue, but the de­bate has been postponed re­peatedly. Iran's president, AbolhassanBani Sadr, last week spoke out against spy trials for the hostages, but many mem­bers of parliament are thought to favor such trials. 
The last Iranian Cabinet was headed by Mehdi Bazargan, who re-signed as prime minister shortly after the storming ofthe 
U. S.Embassy in Tehran and the hostage-taking last Nov. 4. American officials have main­tained that the absence of a government structure in Iran has blocked negotiations for the hostages' release. 
According to Pars, the other new appointees include: 
MahmudWandi, minisster of post and telegraph and tele­phone, who received a doctor­ate in electronics from the Uni­versityof California. He is said to have "cooperated" with the IRP butis described as a polit­ical independent. 
Mohammad Norbakhsh,min­ister ofeconomics and financial affairs, who is said to have been active in Islamic student asso­ciations while studying in the U. 
S. He is now said to be form­ulating a plan to relieve the country's high unemployment rate. 

[continuedfrom page 1] 
reached an agreementwith the government, and some enter­prises were already operating again. 
There were unconfirme-d re­ports that the Gdansk and Szczecin agreements would ap­ply to the other strikers. 
The strike, begun over a meat-price hike announced]uly 1, ended with promises oflabor unions independent of gov­ernment control, the right to strike for worker demands, and reforms affecting nearly ev­ery facet of life in a communist country. 
"We will see to it that the new union always be independent for the sake ofPoland," Walesa 
...Strikers 

said as he and Jagielski signed the 21-point agreement."And now I declare the strike over." 
In addition to independent unions, the settlement requires authorities to review all cases of political prisoners within two weeks,freeing them during the review. 
"I am glad to say we ended our dispute without the use of force but by the way of dis­cussion. We showed that we can understand one another." 
Jagielski drew cheers when he said: "I have done for you what you have asked for. We were talking like Poles should talk to each other, like a Pole talks to a Pole." 
"There are no winners and there are no losers,"he said.

I emphasize the "normal" aspect of co-ed living because that's exactly what this campus lacks: a normalliying alternative.  WASHINGTON ­The Republicans have pledged $100 billion for new arms to "catch up with the Russians." This will presumably include new missiles, the B-1 bomber, super submarines, more surface naval ships, and beefed up tactical forces that can be flown to any part of the world. The country is all for it. The only thing the GOP hasn't explained is where they are going to get the personnel to man the new hardware. The truth of the matter is the Air Force, Navy and Army cannot find the crews for the equipment they now have. The mood of the country is to spend money on anything the military says it needs, as long as American sons and daughters are not required to put on a uniform and use it. What's the answer? The solution is to draft all the illegal aliens who have come across the border and swear them into the armed forces. While military pay may be a pittance to an American, it is a fortune to an illegal South American, Mexican or Haitian refugee. Rather than pick tomatoes or grapes the illegals would be trained to use our new military equipment, and be taught all the latest methods of warfare. Instead of being hounded by immigration officials, they would be given PX privileges, USO dances and food stamps for their families. We would have Cuban pilots, Chinese tank drivers and Vietnamese misslemen. The officer corps would be made up of foreign generals, colonels, majors admirals and captains who have been overthrown in their respective countries by communist takeovers as well as those who have failed in right-wing junta revolutions in their respective countries. By the time the $100 billion allocated by the Republican party would be accounted for, not one American would have to spend a day in the military to defend his country. It is estimated that there are over 10 million illegal aliens in the United States right now. All we need is 5 million for a

The administration's Vic­torian attitudes have sought to avoid the issue of co-ed dorms ever since economic necessity forced them to admit women to Notre Dame. Parietals, kegs, etc. have been their smoke­screen to keep the students occupied and to keep the issue buried.For those of you out there who are tired of the "strained" social atmosphere here at Notre Dame, a co-ed dorm is just what you need and deserve. Let the administration know how you feel-they'll just keep their heads in the sand until you pull them out.

respectable defense capability. The other 5 million could be 
signed up for the reserve, and be permitted to work in the 
fields until an emergency required them to be called up. 
While the illegal aliens would only be required to serve for four years, those who refused to re-enlist would immediately be deported to their country oforigin for being in the United States without a visa. 
The beauty of this plan is that we could fulfill all our military commitments without fear of political fallout because we are endangering the lives of American boys. It would also resolve the debate as to whetherAmerican women should be required to serve in the armed forces. 
But best ofall, it would alleviate the bitterness that some Americans feel toward various boat people arriving in the United States Instead of wanting to send them back, we would welcome those refugees with open arms as fresh mercenaries, ready to fight to keep America free. 
If the United States wants to be number 1 in the world again, as the Republicans intend us to be, we are going to need all the illegal foreigners we can get.

Security arrests Huddle patron 
A man described as being a "little off the wall", but"harm­less" was arrested last night by two Notre Dame security uards for "blocking traffic" in the Huddle. 
According to two Huddle employees, the suspect, who is in his early 30s, was standing next to the door of the LaFor­tune entrance to the Huddle when two ND security officers approached the man and began questioning him. After several minutes, the suspect, who showed no signs of resistance, was pushed to the wall, frisked, handcuffed and subsequently arrested. 
"I can't believe that they would handcuff the poor guy", said one Huddle employee, "he was just standing there minding his own business." 
ND security refused to com­ment on the incident until a later date.

I think the Democratic National Chairman trying to keep him offthe ballot does not look good and it is not good. I think that anybody who wants to run for president, or senator, or anything else, ought to have the chance to do so. Now having said that, I go back to what I said a moment ago. I thinkthe closer we get to the elections, the more gaffes Ronald Reagan pulls and the more dangerous he appears as a man who would be sitting there with his hand on the button, so to speak,I think the more Democrats who might be in­clined to vote for John Anderson are going to perceive their vote as making it possible to elect Ronald Reagan, and

they won't want to do hat. That's what happened the last time we had a major third party candidacy like the Wallace candidacy, where his strength went down and down and down as people began re­turning to the fold recognizing that Wallace wasn't going to win,all they could do was elect Richard Nixon, and that's ex­actly what they did do. 
Q: Wbataboutyourcampaign? What sort of tack will you take? 
A: Dan Quayle talks about a new brand of leadershjp, but that new brand of leadership is one that's for giving the biggest tax breaks to the wealthy, not to the lower and middle income people, giving the oil com­panies free rein to run prices at whatever they want. That kind of thinking he feels very sin­cerely, very genuinely, but I think he's wrong, and my re­cord, on the other hand, is there for people to see. I'm on the other side of that question, and we'll just have to let (the voters) decide. I don't think Dan Quayle can come across like Santa Claus because he isn't Santa Claus. He's had the vote for four years, and I think the people have a right to see how he votes because I assume that's how he'll vote as a senator. 
Q: Where is the recession right now, in your opinion? 
A: I don't know. I was one who thought it was comingwhile everybody else thought we weren't in it yet. Unfortunate­ly,! guess maybe I was right and some other folks were wrong but it's not the kind ofthing you want to brag about.Now I see that this latest report of eco­nomic indicators shows that they're strengthening, maybe things are looking up.
