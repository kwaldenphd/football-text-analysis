By MEG SHUFF 
News Writer 
Arehbishop Denis llurley feels that soda! eoneern, lay participation. and the praetice of eommunity go hand-in-hand in the struggle of Catholic public opinion for fmedom and politieal institutions throughout thn world. 
Hurley, thf~ arehbishop of Durban. Hepublie of South Ameriea, was one of the nu­nwrous seholars who discussed topies coneerning politieal insti­tutions and the qunst for free­dom on the seeond day of "One Hundred Years of Catholie So­da! Thought." 
During the symposium, spon­sored by till' University of Notre Dame and the Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Religious Values in Business, Hurley noted that the overwhelming majority of the Church is lay and it is through their influence that soda! eoncern develops. 
"If social concern is to be a reality it must be so through the laity," he said "There can be no promotion of soeial coneern without the participation of the laity." 
From the beginnings of the Church and up to the Second Vatiean Coundl, the role of the laity in the Church has been in­strumental. according to Hur­ley. This was especially true

a tremendous start in the short period of time it's been in exis­tence," Attanasio said. 
Attanasio said he hopes to "carry the Institute forward from this very strong founda­tion." He said he wants to "continue the very important teaching mission of the Insti­tute and make it more and more influential both in schol­arship and in the formation of public policy." 
Attanasio returned to Notre Dame this year after a semester as a Fulbright Seholar in the Soviet Union, where he lectured to groups including deputies of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R., the ethics department of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences, and the Institute of International Rela­tions of the U.S.S.R. Foreign Ministry. 

He has lectured to members of the German Federal Court and continues to work with leg­islators and judges from the 
U.S.S.R. and Eastern European nations. 

In Hungary, Attanasio re­cently presented a specially compiled book of information on market legal structures to the leadership of seven Eastern European parliaments. held meetings with the chief judge of the Hungarian constitutional court, and lectured at the Uni­versity of Budapest. 
At Notre Dame this year, At­tanasio team-taught, with Igor Grazin, a deputy of the Supreme Soviet, a course com­paring the constitutional sys­tems of the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. 
A member of the Notre Dame faculty since 1985 and named the Law School's out­standing faculty member by its students in 1988, he serves as chair of the advisory board of Notre Dame's Center for Civil and Human Rights and as fac­ulty advisor of the Notre Dame Law Review. 
Attanasio plans to continue teaching courses in Constitu­tional Law and First Amend­ment in the Law School next year.

Nationwide railroad strike possible amid collapse of contract debate 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Last­ditch contract talks between freight railroads and their unions broke up Monday evening, all but assuring a coast-to-coast strike after midnight that could strand rail passengers and stop the flow of one-third of the nation's goods. 
The nation's 235,000 freight workers had vowed to go on strike early Wednesday if a settlement was not reaehed by the midnight deadline. Several unions set the strike for 7 a.m. loeal time, although under fed­eral law, workers were free to walk off their jobs anytime after midnight. 
"I assume there was just no reason to go on," Jim Reiter. a spokesman for the Association of American Railroads, said about three hours before a fed­erally imposed "cooling off" period was set to expire at midnight. Washington time. 
Even as the talks broke off, unions still insisted that they were willing to try to avoid a strike. 
"The unions, at this point, while we recognize that there are still a great many problems to resolve, the door is open to try to engage in meaningful ne­gotiations," said Ed Wytkind, a spokesman for the unions. 

Dan Lang, another industry spokesman, said the carriers made an 11th-hour attempt to settle by offering a new pro­posal. He offered no specifics, but said, "Obviously. it came to naught." 
Wytkind said he was unaware of any substantive new pro­posal. 
Earlier, Larry McFather, president of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, said "we feel we have no choice" but to strike. "Our people have been eut to the bone." 
"We'll probably shut the whole system down," said William Fairchild of the Trans­portation Communication Workers' carmen's division. 
Presidential spokesman Mar­lin Fitzwater said the Bush administration was prepared to work with Congress on speedy legislation "to impose a settle­ment and end the strike." 
Congressional leaders had refused to enaet legislation to stop a strike before it started. but Tuesday, meeting behind closed doors, said that if a walkout occurred. they would hurry legislation to resolve the dispute. 
"My feeling is that, given the nature of the eeonomy, it is im­portant to act in a timely fash­ion," said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Education and La­bor Committee. 
A House panel had already scheduled a hearing for early Wednesday, with both labor, management and Transporta­tion Secretary Samuel Skinner set to testify on the impasse. 
At issue is a three-year-old dispute over wages, work rules and health eare costs. 
Unions contend the railroads have not offered high enough pay increases to make up for wage freezes of the past. Man­agement argues that railroad workers' salaries are already

D-2 lot reorganization proposed 
By STEVEN KRAUSS 
News Writer 
Dave McManus of Parking Services unveiled, at the Hall Presidents' Council (HPC) meeting last night, a new proposal by the organization concerning the D-2 parking lot. 
Beginning next fall, D-2 will officially become two lots; the southern portion will be for South Quad, while North Quad residents will park in the northern part of the lot. 
The idea is an effort to ap· pease drivers from South Quad who found their parking spaces squeezed out by construction near the post office and the football stadium. These stu­dents will now have a little less of a trek to get to their cars. 
Reaction to the proposal was mixed: Flanner Hall Co-presi­dent Rich Delevan called the idea unnecessary. "Adding one more level of bureaucracy in order to save people thirty steps is ludicrous." 

Megan Sullivan of Badin Hall thought that th~l new parking plan is "a nice gesture for the people who got displaced due to the construction. It's also a good idea for north quad fe­males to be placed in the southern lot." 
Under McManus' plan, North Quad females will be permitted to park in the south lot for safety reasons, as well as to avoid overcrowding in the two North Quad lots. South Quad females would continue parking in the D-6 lot. 
While McManus had the floor, he addressed questions about some current parking prob­lems. Asked about the paving schedule for the D-6 parking lot, he said that the new part of the lot is over a swamp and must settle first. The portion that was paved prior to expan­sion, however, is expected to be repaved "sometime during the summer months." 
McManus also stated that markers and signs to assist students in finding their cars in all lots are "on order." · 
In other HPC action. Joe Cas­sidy was introduced to the presidents as HPC moderator. When asked about his goals for next year, Cassidy said, "It's up to the presidonts what they want to get accomplished. I'm here merely as a moderator." In addition to his involvement with HPC, Cassidy is director of Student Activities.

INSIDE COLUMN 

Mourning the close of freshman year 
"Good bye and good luck," Mr. McNeill said to me, as he firmly shook my hand during the conclusion of my final conference with my freshman advisor. 
Megan Junius 

His words prompted me News Copy Editor think about the upcoming years in my life. Then, my ------­thoughts turned back to the numerous ad­vantages of having "freshman" beside my name. 

At the beginning of the year, when people would ask what year I was, I would reply, "Oh, I'm JUST a freshman." 
Looking back on that statement I realize all of the advantages and benefits being "just a freshman" has to offer. 
As a freshman I was enrolled in required courses. Very few choices had to be made. Now , approaching my sophomore year, I am expected to select my courses myself. 
Being a freshman is so much fun. Every­thing is planned -nice and simple. 
We freshmen have our own advisors, just for freshmen. We have our own major, Fresh­man Year. We even have special classes la­beled for "freshmen only." 
At these thoughts, I realized all that Notre Dame has offered, not only me, but to all freshman. And, I thought about all that I have already experienced on my own during freshman year. 
At the beginning of the year, during football season, when I forgot my ID, all I had to do was tell the guard the name of my rector and, of course, the fact that I was a JUST a freshman. I didn't know any better -Of course, I got in. 
Now, think way, way back to Orientation Weekend. What other time of your life have you had the opportunity to randomly walk up to people and find out their name, hometown and dorm? 
Speaking of randomness, when else, besides freshman year, would it be acceptable to hand pick your date out of the dogbook, then have your roommate call the guy and set you both up for your SYR? 
As first semester continues, the shock of college exams becomes reality. "I received a D-on my first paper for Freshman Seminar," I told my mother tearfully over the telephone. My parents, the ones I have learned to love dearly since coming to college, told me not to worry about my grades, I was still adjusting. 
As freshman year comes to a close, I realize the necessity to accept the fact that life does go on. Although it may seem that I mourn the close of freshman year, in actuality, I look forward to the years to come. However, this is only because upperclassmen have guaranteed that it only gets better.

Media challenge of war coverage restriction fails 
Department's request to dismiss on the number of journalists Jones Magazine, The L.A. constitutional claims. 
American ExpressAnnouncesA Great New Travel Program. 
NEW YORK (AP) -A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit by news organizations that ehallenged the eonstitu­tionality of Pentagon rules gov­erning media access to combat. 
U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand said the media had the right to sue the government, but he ruled he did not have enough information to decide the case now that the Persian Gulf War was over. 
"Prudence dictates that a final d11termination of the important constitutional issues at stake be h1ft for another day when the controversy is more sharply focused," Sand said in a written decision granting the Defense the case. 
Pentagon rules in the war against Iraq established pool coverage, restricted descrip­tions of combat and required military review of combat dis­patches. 
Sand said the case raised new and important questions about the relationship between the First Amendment and national security, especially about the role of American journalists in wars abroad. 
But he said he couldn't decide the issues because he had no way of knowing what future military conflicts would bring. 
"Who can say that during the next American overseas mili­tary operation some restriction granted access at a particular time to a particular battlefield may not be a reasonable time, place and manner restriction?" Sand said. 
The judge complained that the news organizations never responded when he asked for alternatives to the Pentagon regulations that they thought would be constitutional. 
"Plaintiffs' only response was that the press be allowed unlimited, unilateral access," Sand said. 
The lawsuit was filed on be­half of The Nation, Harper's, In These Times, Pacific News Ser­vice, The Guardian, The Pro­gressive Magazine, Mother Weekly and The Village Voice. 

Journalists who joined in the lawsuit were Sydney Schanberg, a columnist for Newsday; Michael Klare, defense correspondent for The Nation; and novelists E.L. Doctorow and William Styron, who wrote about the Gulf War for The Nation. 
Franklin Siegel, an attorney with the Center for Constitu­tional Rights, which prepared the lawsuit, said he was review­ing the decision and would comment later. 
Sand also dismissed a sepa­rate lawsuit brought by Agence France Presse, the French news service, which raised similar 
The lawsuit said the Pen­tagon's position that the rules were adopted for security rea­sons was a cover for the rules' true purpose -"to control and manipulate information avail­able to the American public." 
The complaint said the prac­tices and the rules used in the war violated or threatened to violate the news organizations' rights to freedom of press and freedom of speech and associa­tion. 
It said pool coverage violated the right to freedom of press and equal protection by "giving some reporters preferential treatment and access not ac­corded to others."

If a nationwide strike oc­curred, it was expected to im­mediately choke the flow of one-third of the nation's goods and idle as many.as 550,000 other American workers who depend on train-delivered goods to complete their jobs. 
Chrysler Corp. said in a statement, "Obviously, a rail strike of any length could result in massive closings. Our indus­try is already facing tough times, and this would be an­other blow which would slow our recovery." 
Production and employment levels in auto, paper, lumber, steel, coal mining, glass pro­duction, plastics and chemical industries were expected to be hardest hit, administration of­ficials said. 
Thousands of train-riding commuters and Amtrak pas­sengers could be stranded, too. 
Though the unions involved work on freight lines, most Am­trak trains, and many com­muter trains such as those in the Chicago area, share tracks with freight lines and therefore service would be disrupted. 
Amtrak's busiest region, the Northeast corridor from Washington to Boston, would not be affected because Amtrak owns that track. 
A key issue in the negotia­tions is how closely railroad workers' contracts should mir­ror a presidential emergency board's report issued in Jan­uary. That study recommended yearly pay boosts for workers, but also said they should start paying part of their health cost premiums. 
Unions were highly critical of the report, saying its pay scale was not high enough in light of a wage freeze in effect since 1988.

The initiatives include the use of brown bags made of recyded paper, smaller paper napkins, recycling of behind-the-counter cardboard boxes, and the elim­ination of plastic cutlery wrap­pers where allowed by local health codes. And the company is trying out reusable coffee mugs, reusable coffee filters, and pump-style bulk condiment dispensers. 
McDonald's, the world's largest food service organiza­tion, said also it is looking into replacing the plastic forks, spoons and knives with starch­based cutlery that could be composted. It also plans large­scale, soil-enriching composting of food and paper wastes on an experimental basis. 
Parts of the plan have already been implemented, such as the switch last fall from polystyrene sandwich boxes to a thin­layered wrap. Before the changes were begun, McDon­ald's outlets sent 2 million pounds of garbage per day to incinerators and landfills in the United States. 
The initiative was developed in collaboration with the Envi­ronmental Defense Fund, an environmental advocacy group, which set up a joint task force with McDonald's to scrutinize the company's trash. 
Keith Magnuson, McDonald's director of operations devel­opment, said he was "somewhere between surprised and shocked," when he realized how much of the garbage pro­duced at McDonald's restau­rants could be reduced, reused, recycled or composted. 

"It's entirely possible that we can divert more than 80 per­cent of our on-premises solid waste," Magnuson said in an interview. "That came as a great surprise." 
The plan also has environ­mental goals other than waste reduction, such as converting to unbleached brown paper when possible, or to paper bleached with processes that don't use harmful chlorine. 

Robert Langert, director of environmental affairs for the Perseco Co., the exclusive pack­aging purchaser for MeDon­aid's, said it wasn't easy to abandon whitn carryout bags. 
"The decision to go to a brown bag was very dil'ficult." said Langert. one of four com­pany representatives on the task force. "In focus groups we got more negatives than posi­tives," he said, with peopln say­ing the brown bags seemed cheap and not as clean as they expected from McDonald's. 
But once the bags were intro­duced in stores, along with an explanation of the environrnen­tal benefits, "what came out of the real customer opinions was 100 percent positive," Langert said. 
Richard Denison, a senior scientist for EDF, said the Mc­Donald's initiative could set a trend for the food service in­dustry. 
"They have a major role to play. They can serve as a cata­lyst," Denison said. "We felt if we could find solutions that 
would work for McDonald's, it would work for others." 
Magnuson said the company does not know how much its plan will cost, but expeets most of the changes it makes will break even or save money in the long run. 
Terri Capatosto, director of communications, said McDon­ald's had no plans to promote the environmental policy to at­tract customers. 
"We're not necessarily ex­pecting to have a marketing edge," she said. "The majority 
!
of the things in the plan...the customer will never see." 
j 

The task force found that most of McDonald's trash comes ~ from "behind the counter." One 
, example is corrugated shipping , boxes that can be recycled or 1 
replaced by reusable cartons. 
For the remaining amounts of food and paper wastes gen­erated at a McDonald's restau­rant, the company pledged to develop large-scale composting, which would convert the garbage into marketable soil enrichers. 
A pilot test involving nine McDonald's outlets in Maine began last month. 
McDonald's, founded in 1948 in San Bernardino, Calif., has more than 11,000 outlets in 54 countries around the world. In the United States, more than 18 million people visit a McDon­ald's each day. One in every 15 working Americans gets his or her first job at McDonald's.

Attanasio 
Continued from page 1 
book with the former dean and 
another member of the faculty 
of New York University S_shool 
of Law. 
Attanasio was graduated Phi 
Beta Kappa from the University 
of Virginia in 1976 and earned 
a J.D. from the New York Uni­
versity School of Law in 1979. 
He also holds a diploma from 
the University of Oxford and an 
LL.M. from Yale Law School. 
Attanasio will become the director of the Institute on July 

1. He plans to "consult with people associated with the Institute and members of the wider University community on ways the Institute can best serve the University community." 
He said that he has some personal interest in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and structural reform in those places. "This is one of a num­ber of directions in which I would like to see the Institute go," Attanasio said. Another area he would like the Institute to explore is conflict and dis­pute resolution. 
"This is an interdisciplinary enterprise," Attanasio said. "There are many talented peo­ple with many areas of exper­tise." He said he would like to enhance the scholarly compo­nent but not to the exclusion of influencing public policy, a goal he has for the Institute. 
Attanasio outlined some of the many challenges facing the Institute. One of these he called, "the new world order, as yet undefined." Other challenges are not all military related, Attanasio said, citing the environment as an example. 
These problems may lead to opportunities, because they "vividly impress nations with the necessity of cooperation," he said. "As Father Hesburgh says, 'we all breath the same air,'" Attanasio added. 
According to Attanasio, 100 students with undergraduate concentrations and a signifi­cant group of graduate stu­dents are connected to the In­stitute. 
There are also 14 interna­tional peace scholars who study at the Institute and live in a place called the peace house. "They have diverse back­grounds and cultures and ex­change ideas," Attanasio said. 
The Peace Institute "ought to be a place where people of all the various disciplines can come together as faculty and students to exchange ideas in the pursuit of a noble enter­prise, the pursuit of peace," At­tanasio said. 
Gilligan is leaving the direc­
torship and retiring from his 
faculty position as George N. 
Shuster University Professor 
and professor of law. 
"As the Peace Institute's 
founding director, Jack Gilligan 
formulated a vision and trans­
lated it into a vital academic 
program," O'Meara said. "He 
conceived its unique emphasis, 
developed its structure and 
brought together an excellent 
faculty," O'Meara said. 
A native of Cincinnati and a 
1942 Notre Dame graduate, 
Gilligan became nationally 
known for his work in urban 
renewal and neighborhood or­
ganization. He was elected to 
the U.S. House of Representa­
tives in 1964 and in 1970 was 
elected governor of Ohio. Presi­
dent Carter appointed him ad­
ministrator of the Agency for 
International Development in 
1975. 
Gilligan said there are many things that make him proud: "that we have an Institute, that it came into being." 
"This is the most comprehensive program of peace studies anywhere in the world," Gilligan said. "It is organized around 20 faculty fellows." 
"There is a sliding group of 19-20 faculty fellows not com­pensated; they do it because of their interest in the program," Gilligan said. "It is unlike any­thing in the University." 
Gilligan said he is proud of the quality of the students, especially in the graduate pro­gram and the international scholars. "You could write a small book on the qualifications of these students," he said. 
"The key question is whether the University will give adequate financial support to the development of the program," Gilligan said. "The main source of revenue now is a three year grant." 

"The University gives tuition waivers at the graduate level, but other than that there is no direct University support," Gilligan added. 
Attanasio said that he is "privileged to follow after Gov. Gilligan. He gave the Institute a magnificent start, tremendous leadership and something which we can build on." 
Gilligan said that Attanasio is "very bright, very able,'' and that he will be a "marvelous di­rector."

Archbishop of Durban, Republic of South America, Denis Hurley speaks at a symposium on the second day of "One Hundred Years of Catholic Social Thought." He discussed the Church's role in the quest for freedom throughout the world. 
Lean, epic filmmaker, dies 
NEW YORK (AP) -When film students, critics, historians and other buffs are asked to list the best movies ever made, 'David Lean's 'Lawrence of Arabia" appears with well-deserved frequency. 
It was indeed the singular masterpiece in the illustrious career of the British filmmaker, who died Tuesday at age 83. 
Compared to other leaders in the movie industry, his career outpouring may be considered by some to be well, lean -he made only 16 movies. But all are rare and exquisite jewels, each in its own special way. 
'From the lovely "Brief En­counter," to the the heroic "The Bridge on the River Kwai," or the passionate "Doctor Zhivago," Lean's fa­vorite of his own movies was "Lawrence of Arabia." "His legacy is that he's the only filmmaker to make intelligent epics, and I really think our greatest narrative filmmaker," his biographer, Stephen Silver­man, said Tuesday. 
"He had been in declining health since returning home to England after the 1989 re-re­lease of 'Lawrence of Arabia,"' Silverman said. 
Lean had a keen eye for detail and strove for cultural accu­racy.

Hurley 
Continued from page 1 
during the early 1900s when the lay apostolate realized that it was not just an extension of the hierarchy, but that it had its own job to do. 
Hurley said this job, which flows from baptism and is more important than the ordained ministry, was emphasized as "consecrating the world" and "promoting the full value of freedom as an integral part of social doctrine." 
Today it is the Latin Ameri­can Church which has been leading the world through its liberation theology and its Christian base communities, according to Hurley. 
It is this Latin American ex­perience that molds a lesson for the rest of the world. "It (the lesson) is about freedom, that most precious of human attributes, often suppressed and easily abused,'' said Hurley. 
"Freedom and rights go hand in hand," he added. "In a way the greatest human right is freedom to serve others." 
In serving others, we are so­cial beings and cannot survive outside society, said Hurley. Without this intense practice of community, Catholic public opinion cannot be created and maintained. 
It took the Catholic Church a long time to come to terms with the modern understanding of freedom and its expression in political democracy, he added. 
"The theology of religious freedom took longer. The Catholic Church saw itself and still sees itself as the true Church of Christ." 
Today, however, the Church has relinquished all inhibitions about promoting the full value of freedom as an integral part of social doctrine. 
The symposium was held at the Center for Continuing Edu­cation.

TOKYO (AP) -Soviet Presi­dent Mikhail Gorbachev devoted his first day in Japan on Tuesday to chipping away at the mutual animosity that has kept Tokyo from sharing its im­mense wealth with its impover­ished neighbor. 
Briefly leaving behind eco­nomic and political woes at home, Gorbachev set out to woo the Japanese as he has done with Americans and Europeans. He is the first Soviet leader to travel to Japan. 
He spent the day meeting with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, cheerfully chatting with Emperor Akihito and shaking hands with many Tokyo resi­dents. 
But a more serious tone is expected Wednesday in Gor­bachev's parliamentary ad­dress. According to an advance text of the speech, Gorbachev will warn Japanese lawmakers that his nation needs help to 
avert turmoil and  a  return to  
dictatorship.  
The  text  also  contained  

promises to reduce the Soviet military presence in the region and suggests multilateral naval reductions. 
"If we don't halt the disinte­gration of the state -of the economy, the law and relations between republics; if we don't support the new social pro­cesses in a peaceful framework -the country could fall into the chaos that gives birth to dictatorship," Gorbachev says in the text. 
"Despair and hopelessness are a serious threat to the progress of civilization. There­fore, advanced countries help themselves by helping others." 
Gorbachev also was report­edly planning to present busi­ness leaders with several trade proposals, including bartering Soviet fuel and raw materials for Japanese equipment to pro­duce consumer goods, and re­vival of a long-stalled $2.5 bil­lion oil project on Sakhalin, a Soviet island north of Japan. 
"It is time to do everything so that our peoples...will never again drift into the disaster of enmity," Gorbachev said at a nationally televised court ban­quet Tuesday night. "On the threshold of a new century and millennium, we must take from the past only that which brings us together and enriches both sides." 
He was referring to the huge task of healing the wounds left from World War II, when the Soviets seized four islands off Japan's northern coast and tens of thousands of Japanese prisoners of war died in Si­berian camps. 
In his banquet toast, Gor­bachev offered condolences to the families of the Japanese prisoners who perished, but stopped short of a formal apology. IIe is expected to give the Japanese a list of the dead before he leaves Friday. 
That follows the tone of rec­onciliation he set Monday in the Siberian city of Khabarovsk, where he visited the graves of Japanese who died while being held prisoner by the Soviel'>. 
The territorial dispute re­mains a formidable obstacle. Japan demands return of all four islands -known to Soviets as the Kuril Islands and to Japanese as the Northern Ter­ritories -before it will sign a treaty formally ending World War II hostilities with the Sovi­ets, thereby clearing the way for aid. 
Gorbachev faces strong op­position at home to any territo­rial concessions. 
Half of his three-hour summit meeting with Kaifu. which was described by a Japanese official as a "frank exchange of views," was devoted to the dispute, and the leaders agreed not to divulge any details until after further talks. 
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Japanese economic aid was not discussed. 
In the meeting, Gorbachev said Soviet relations were ad­vancing with nations through­out the West and that bilateral ties with Tokyo "must be im­proved substantially," another Japanese official said. The offi­cial also spoke on condition of anonymity. 
In some areas, Soviet­Japanese relations are frozen and in other areas "life can hardly be seen," Gorbachev spokesman Viltaly lgnatenko quoted the Soviet leader as saying. 
An invitation from Gorbaehev for Kaifu to visit Moscow was immediately accepted, and the two leaders were shown fre­quently on television smiling, shaking hands and sharing laughs.

Tape of alleged Mafia inductions to be used in trial 
BOSTON (AP) -A secretly recorded tape of an alleged Mafia induction ceremony ~an be used as crucial evidence against purported crime boss Raymond Patriarca and six of his lieutenants, a federal judge ruled Tuesday. 
The tape is the first of an al­leged mob initiation. On it, a convicted killer and three other men are heard allegedly swear­ing allegiance to the Mafia with blood drawn from their trigger fingers and pledging to murder any person who could pose a threat, including their own rel­atives. 
U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf, who ruled the tape could be admitted into evidence, ac-

knowledged its importance to the case. 
"Absent the evidence inter­cepted {by a hidden micro­phone), there may not be a prosecutable case against some of the defendants, including Raymond Patriarca, the alleged 'boss' of the Patriarca family," Wolf said. 
Patriarca's lawyer said he may ask the judge to reconsider the decision. 
The ruling also sets a prece­dent that could affect the Hart­ford. Conn., trial of nine other men reputed to be linked to Pa­triarca. Their attorneys have raised similar objections to the secret tape. Jury selection in the case begins this week. U.S. District Judge Alan Nevas also was considering whether to al­low the tapes into evidence. 
Procedural motions are still being heard in Patriarca's case and no trial date has been set. 
Seventeen Mafia members from Connecticut, Rhode Island and ·Massachusetts attended the supposed induction ceremony in October 1989 at a home in suburban Medford, the government says. 
"I enter alive into this orga­nization and leave it dead," each inductee swore in a cere­mony spoken mostly in Italian, the FBI said. 
Defense attorneys argued that when prosecutor Diane Kottmyer got a judge's autho­rization to secretly bug the house, she did so without re-

vealing information about the imminent initiation. 
The lawyers argued that the Fourth Amendment protects the rights of citizens to associate without government inter­ference. 
Wolf criticized Kottmyer for the lapse, but said that was not enough to force suppression of the tapes. He said permission for the bugs probably would have been given even if Kottmyer's knowledge of the ceremony was disclosed. 
Patriarca's lawyer, Martin 

Weinberg, said he planned to review the judge's 127-page de­cision "and make a determina­tion whether to move for re­consideration." 
Kottmyer said the court pro­hibited her from commenting on any aspect of the case. 
The FBI learned in 1989 that four new members were to be inducted into the alleged Patri­arca family, including Vincent Federico, then serving a sen­tence for murder in a Mas­sachusetts prison.

EDITORIAL LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Digger leaves behind legacy of highlights, high standards 
After 20 years, Digger Phelps, the man who put Notre Dame basketball on the map is gone. 
Digger guided the Fighting Irish basketball program through a transitional period in college athletics. Phelps, who wrote a letter to then-Irish football coach Ara Parseghian relating his dream to coach at Notre Dame, endured a rough first year with the Irish. The years from then on, however, were filled with successes and milestones. In his second season, Notre Dame reached the NIT semifinals. Five years later the Irish advanced all the way to the Final Four, only to fall to Duke when Duck Editor's note: The following will his co-signers to my Feb. 5 Bartky were concerned with

Editor's note: The following is part two ofa two part column. 
The "academic community," external as well as internal, long ago assumed the authori­tative role formerly played by the teaching Church in the life of Notre Dame. At the Land O'Lakes conference in 1967, the presidents of the leading Catholic universities, including Notre Dame, declared that, "To perform its teaching and re­search functions effectively, the Catholic university must have a true autonomy and academic freedom in the face of authority of whatever kind, lay or cleri­cal, external to the academic community itself." The Land 0' Lakes concept tends predictably toward an institutional renun­ciation of the duty to affirm re­ligious truth. 
Thus, in the fall of 1989, Notre Dame sponsored a public showing of a blasphemy of Christ, in the film "The Last Temptation of Christ." That event remains crucial in the history of Notre Dame. The University decided there that the First and Second Com­mandments were superseded by the authority of the secular establishment. As Professor Dean Porter. Director of the Snite Museum, said, "when (the museum) was built nine years ago, we decided if a film could be seen at the Museum of Modern Art, it could be seen here" (South Bend Tribune, Sept. 29, 1989, p. Cl, col. 1). 
The X-rated "Desperate Living" and "The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover" have since been shown at the Snite. The latter classic, origi­nally rated X, was released un­rated and helped precipitate the new NC-17 rating system. It was described by critic Michael Medved as a "putrid, pointless, and pretentious piece of filth." However, if the University is so unsure of itself that it cannot draw the line short of sponsor­ing a blasphemy of Christ Himself, X-rated films are small change; those latter showings generated no protest. To spon­sor such films is the politically correct thing to do, especially at a university in danger of being considered narrow-minded because it is Catholic. 
A serio-comic example of Notre Dame's tendency to en­dorse almost anything that is "politically correct" is the Academic Council's recent pre­scription for gender inclusive language. Only in the eighth decade of the twentieth century did academics ever discover that such words as "he," "man," and "mankind" caused women to feel inferior. Now, Dean Eileen Kolman of the Freshman Year of Studies believes "it would be an absolute shame if any student leaves Notre Dame in 1991 without knowing that exclusive language is simply no longer acceptable" (The Observer, March 7, 1991). 
More likely, Notre Dame graduates (will they have "bachelor's" degrees?) will dis­cover in the world outside academe a less than unlimited tolerance for the neologisms and ambiguities generated by the ideological corruption of language. Meanwhile, unfortu­nately, linguistic vandals will mutilate some treasures of English literature, including the Bible. Thus, "An Inclusive Lectionary," produced by the National Council of Churches, describes God as "the motherly father of the Church who comes forth" and has St. John, in 3:16, tell us, "For God so loved the 
Guest Columnist 
world that God gave God's only Child, that whoever believes in that Child should not perish but have eternal life." 
When the Facuity Senate be­stirred itself to pass the gender resolution, Professor Paul Conway, chairman of the Senate, said, "We're 10-15 years behind the others [other universities] in making this resolution" (The Observer, Feb. 6, 1991). What next? And will we ever catch up? While the gender policy represents a mi­nor and probably transitory feminoid triumph, it does mani­fest the other-directed bent of an institution unsure of its her­itage and beliefs. 
The pursuit of PC can some­times take priority even over the health of students. An ex­ample is the muted policy of the University on homosexual activ­ity. The University commend­ably refuses to officially recog­nize homosexual groups on campus. The University also rightly emphasizes that the ob­jective wrongness of homosex­ual activity does not warrant unjust discrimination against persons who may have homo­sexual tendencies. Nor does the objective wrongness of the act confer a license to judge the subjective culpability of anyone. 
Homosexual activity, however, is the main factor in the onset of AIDS. One could reasonably think that if the University is going to say anything to its students on the homosexual issue, it ought to include a demand that homosexuals refrain from the objectively wrong behavior which is a men­ace to themselves and poten­tially to the health of the com­munity. I have yet to see any such public insistence from any office of the University. 
See, for example, the state­ments of Campus Ministry and of 39 members of the Notre Dame community on National Coming Out Day (The Observer, Oct. 11, 1990). Justice to the homosexuals as well as to the rest of the community requires an insistence on the duty to re­frain from homosexual activity. Political correctness demands instead an emphasis on the evil of homophobia and on the duty of others to exercise tolerance and compassion. And that is predominantly what we hear on the subject. 
The two "Research Uni­versity" signs can be fairly regarded as a public acknowl­edgment of the other-directed pursuit of PC which has been on the Notre Dame agenda for decades. The research preoccu­pation and other PC examples arise from good faith judgments made by administrators and others who act in what they see as the best interest of Notre Dame. My criticism is of policies, not persons. 
We ought to ask, however, where this PC trend is leading us in educational and spiritual as well as financial terms. We have lost sight of some basic realities: tl1at undergraduate education is entitled to the pri­mary focus at Notre Dame; that research is collateral, i.e., that Notre Dame exists mainly for the benefit of its students rather than of the government, industry, foundations or the publishing professors; that graduate education and atten­dant research are important to Notre Dame but that there, too, the interests of the students are paramount; that the Catholic character of Notre Dame entails a responsibility to help its stu­dents who are so minded to prepare for service to the community and the Church without having to incur pro­hibitive loans just to make it through college. 
We need a recommitment to education in the tradition of Notre Dame, centered on the Congregation of Holy Cross, whose members founded and built this institution. In more re­cent years, regrettably, the Holy Cross priests have adopted, or acquiesced in, policies that have subordinated Notre Dame to the standards of the secular estab­lishment. And they have relin­quished the principal offices controlling academics, theology, student affairs and admissions. It is no reflection on the lay ad­ministrators to say that Notre Dame has lost much of its iden­tity with none of those posts held by Holy Cross priests. 
I hope, perhaps unrealisti­cally, that Notre Dame will sur­vive as a Catholic institution loyal to the Vicar of Christ and actively seeking the aid of the Mother of God. The pursuit of PC and of "research" greatness, however, is leading us in the op­posite direction. 
What matters, in truth, is not whether we are favorably re­garded at Princeton, Yale, the National Organization for Women, or Beijing. What counts is the service we provide for our students. Holy Cross priests are six of the 12 Fellows of the Uni­versity. It is time for them to return this institution to its his­toric mission, which is the education of students in the Catholic tradition.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Student targets poor publicity as reason for lack of participation at SMC/ND dinner 
Dear Editor: 
How much participation in the recent Saint Mary's/Notre Dame Freshwoman's dinner did the Freshman Board expect with such poor publicity about the event ("Sparse participa­tion impairs goals of SMC/ND Freshwoman's dinner," The Observer, April 10)? On the en­tire Saint Mary's campus, I saw one poster announcing in the event. This poster was on the bulletin board by the steps in the dining hall (LeMans side). The poster itself was drab (the information was printed in dark letters on white posterboard with no graphics) and was hung in a poor location. 
The signs concerning the re­cent Saint Mary's Freshman Formal were in great contrast to this poster. Formal signs were posted everywhere on campus-on practically every door, mirror and wall in sight-and were printed on light blue paper with a large graphic in the center, which made them very eye-catching. 
Since the Freshman Boards are so concerned about the re­lations between women at the two schools, it is ironic that the formal (exclusively a Saint Mary's event) was so highly publicized while the dinner (a joint Saint Mary's/Notre Dame event) received virtually no publicity, at least on Saint Mary's campus. 
I do not know how much publicity the dinner received on Notre Dame's campus, but when I asked a friend of mine from Notre Dame to come for the dinner, she responded that she had not heard anything about it. Before criticizing the poor participation of Saint Mary's and Notre Dame fresh­women at a joint event, the Freshman Boards should eval­uate to what extent their classmates have been informed about the event.

Ignorance perpetuates environmental problem 
Dear Editor: 
I find it particularly disturb­ing that several Saint Mary's students find it necessary to feed the squirrels that live on this campus. This may not seem like a serious problem, however, since when has any animal's diet included cereal, chips, or ice cream cones? 
I suppose that the girls who do partake in feeding the squir­rels with food from the dining hall don't realize that soon, come summertime, these ani­mals will have to find their own food. Their ecosystem has been disrupted by the ignorance of a "smarter" species-the human being. This is a perfect exam­ple of the ignorance that is often the root of many larger (or smaller) environmental problems. 
But is it ignorance that has perpetuated the problem? Or do these girls actually think that since small rodents eat nuts and berries, that this includes "Crunch Berries?" It is cruel to feed the squirrels. Sure, they are "cute" but it is true, they can exist in their natural environment without the aid of sugar-coated preservatives. 
Both the administration and the Marriott Corporation have failed to even address the prob­lem. But perhaps inhumane treatment of animals is not something that concerns them? Nevertheless, feeding the squir­rels is a problem that needs to be stopped. These animals do not need to be fed. These ani­mals can forage on their own and survive without our food.

Minoso deserves Fay Vincent's support to play in sixth decade 
Dear Editor: 
Preventing Minnie Minoso from playing in a single game in 1990 or 1991 so that he could become the only six­decade professional baseball player is dumb, stupid and an insult to real baseball fans. 
The Commissioner of Baseball should realize that Minoso had, and has, more heart and competitive spirit than all of the .208 hitters that get paid millions and go to arbitration requesting more money. The Commissioner felt that it would "trivialize the game" to let Minnie Minoso play. Come on, Commissioner Vincent! 
If you took a poll of all baseball fans in the U.S. and asked, "Would you like to see Minnie Minoso pinch run one time in the major league today?", I feel confident of the answer-and I'll bet-oops (no wagering allowed) that Minnie would get a standing ovation and that parents would be able to say to their daughters and sons, "He's a real ballplayer." By the way, Minnie would touch up on third and score on a fly ball with less than two outs, even today.

Lectures trace the legend of Saturday Night Live throughout the years 
By MEREDITH McCULLOUGH Accent Writer 
WAHNING: This "is about people­highly creative and consciously eccentric people ... who were operating under extreme pressure... The effects on the psyche of major stardom, though a part of popular legend, are underAstimated ... Keep this in mind." -Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad. 
On October 11, 197 5, the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) made television history, when it launched Saturday Night Live, a program Keppler Assodatns describnd as "a potent blend of innovative comedy, irreverence and occasionally tasteless satire." 
On April 1R, 1991, Doug Hill and Jeff WAingrad, coauthors of the best seller "A Backstage History of 'Saturday Night,"' will mtnll that dynamic history to Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students in a riveting performance that Time magazinn dubbed "bntter than reruns." 
Hill and Weingrad have been brought to Notre Dame's Center for Continuing Education to "recount the tumultuous history of the show from its beginnings as an outlaw program produced by an unruly band of comedy underground rerwgades through its evolution into a comedy institution," according to Keppler Associates. 
Armed with 40 minutes of film clips, which are not available anywhere else, these two talented speakers will be on hand to fill students in on what happerwd behind the scenes-to reveal such mystnries as why: 
Garrett 
Morris rarely appeared as a leading man in sketches. 

Eddie Murphy almost always did. 

Chevy 
Chase was resented by the enst. 

Bill 
Murray once punched out Chevy live minutes before air time. 


Dan Aykroyd trashed a wall on the 17th floor of the NBC Building. 
John 
Belushi disliked Lily Tomlin. 

John 
Belushi disliked Chevy Chase. 

John 
Belushi disliked "the Bees." 


For many weeks, the NBC censor had trouble sleeping. 
In their presentation, Hill and Weingrad will cover the same areas they discussed in their book which was praised by the Gannett News Service for "the willingness to name names-to say who was taking drugs, who was trying to upstage who, to tell what money people were making." 
The Baltimore Sun added, "For someone who has followed TV, or the show, or its stars, it is unflaggingly ab­sorbing, frequently fascinating and occasionally amazing." 
According to Hill and Weingrad, Saturday Night Live, "SNL" or "the show" as the program was more af­fectionately called, began somewhat vaguely. 
In "Saturday Night," they describe how once the show was scheduled to air Lorne Michaels, the youthful producer, told his staff. "Do anything you want." lie did, however, "Jay down some ground rules:" No Carol Burnett. "There will be more integrity and respect for writing here," he said. 
Once the show got on its feet it began to grow-in popularity and personality. Each performer brought something dif­ferent to "Saturday Night Live" which resulted in "battles the show waged with network executive and censors, and the chaotic whirls of rewrites, tantrums, and rivalries among the cast members." 
On Thursday at 8 p.m. in the auditorium of the Center for Continuing Education, Hill and Weingrad will explore the aspects of "Saturday Night Live" that made the show a television legend. TickAts are $3 and will be sold at the LaFortune information desk. 
"A Backstage History of 'Saturday Night Live'" is sponsored by the Student (As seen on Nick at Nite's ~~aest of Saturday Night Live" series)

Send Off to 'affirm service' for student summer volunteers 
By STEVE TANKOVICH 
Accent Writer 
Service is a vital part of life h11re at Notre Dame/Saint Mary's, and many students choose to volunteer for a sum­nwr or a year aft1~r graduation. In r11cognition of their commit­ment to service, the Center for Soda! Concerns is sponsoring a Volunt11nr Send-Off service for the students, their families. and anyone else who is interested in showing their support for the students. 
This is the second year for the Send-Off. The idea behind it is that it helps to "affirm service," according to Mary Ann Hoerner, director of senior/alumni programs at the CSC. "There anm't enough vehicles for supporting service," says Hoerner. 
'There are doctor.s,
Iawvers, and a vanetv 
othcnner orofess1onals 
w o ao serv1ce. 
There are doctors, lawyers, and a variety of other profes­sionals who do service. These people integrate service into their profession. "This Send-Off helps people to see how service can be integrated into one's life," Hoerner adds. 
Last year, talks by former law student and year-long volunteer Irene Loftus and by President Malloy were highlights of the program. There was also a reading with a reflection and a candle lighting service. This year's service promises to be as equally impressive a program. 
Jay Caponigro, a senior who will volunteer this summer in Spokane, Washington, was able to assist with and attend last year's service. "It was a useful and touching ceremony," states Caponigro. 
"It was useful in that the stu­dents were recognized by their peers and parents for their work ... touching in that it was the culmination of four years growth and that it was the culmination of moving toward a lifestyle of service," Caponigro added. 
Caponigro and Roemer both are in agreement about the im­portance of the Send-Off to al­low the parents to Jearn more about and show their support for their son's or daughter's experience. "It was very healthy for the students to see the sup­port of the parents," Caponigro stated. 
Students in the program are planning to work with a variety of different organizations. Some of these include the Holy Cross Associates, the Jesuit Volunteer Program, the Peace Corps, Habitat for Humanity, and the Lutheran Volunteer Corps. They will be travelling to such diverse locations as Chile, Spokane, Washington, Chicago, Illinois, and Phoenix, Arizona.

Seniors who are volunteering for a year or summer of service after graduation should register for the Volunteer Send-Off at the esc and give their parents' address so that invitations can be mailed to them. Off campus students reading this article should be doubly aware about registration, as there are no hall service commissioners to give them further reminders. 
'The Senior Solution' offers alternative to formal 
By AL PISA Accent Writer 
As a senior, you are faced with a problem. 
Senior Formal is quickly approaching but you're not going 
because you just can't afford it. You start to get dt~pressed 
when you think about being stuck on campus for the weekend 
while the rest of the class is in Chicago. A group of seniors, 
along with the Office of Campus Ministry, have come up with an 
answer to your problem, and they call it "The Senior Solution." 
"The Senior Solution" is an off-campus senior dinner/dance 
that will be held Friday night at St. Hedwig's Memorial Hall 
from 7 p.m. to midnight. 
The idea for the dinner/dance first eame about when a group 
of off-campus seniors expressed their concern to Father Tom 
McDermott, a member of the Office of Campus Ministry, about 
the high price of the Senior Formal. 
"One senior said he wished there was some alternative for 
people who couldn't go to Senior Formal. The more we talked 
about it, the more we thought, 'why can't there be?"' said Mc­
Dermott. McDermott explained that he got involved with the 
planning of the dinner/dance because, " ... at times things can 
become too glitzy and expensive and that's not necessarily the 
key to having a good time. This dinner/dance will be a lot of fun 
while not costing much." 
For only $25 a couple, "The Senior Solution" otTers a sit 
down, family style dinner of chicken, mashed potatoes and 
gravy, and Polish sausage along with desserts. 
Beer and wine will be served and the campus band Jester 
will provide the entertainment for the night. The organizers of 
the dinner/dance want to emphasize that the purpose of the 
night will be to give those who couldn't make the Prom the 
chance to have a good time in a more relaxed style. 
So, if you haven't purchased a Senior Formal bid but want to 
have one more memorable time to add to the memories of your 
senior year, it's not too late. Tickets for "The Senior Solution" 
are still available from either McDermott, or off-campus presi­
dents Mark Bettencourt and Steve Leinenweber.

Digger 
continued from page 24 
ing back tears. "Thanks to the greatest group of players any­where, my dream has come true." 
I was there for most of the best of Digger's Double Decades; from 1976-81. I cov­ered those games for this newspaper. I wrote about the big wins, the dumb losses. I usually gave Digger more credit than he deserved, but only, I assured myself, to balance the unfair criticism I believed he sometimes received. 
'Digger PheiP,s onlywanfed two th1ngsfrom his profession­to coach at Notre Dame and to bringhome a national championship. That the latter never happened must not ... detract trow what is remembered about Digger's time at Notre Dame.' 


everything I can out of this player;, this situation, this team... 
The private times with Digger seemed to reinforce that. 
The midnight flight from Raleigh, North Carolina after a tough loss to NC State. Relaxed, unwound, a philosophical Digger did not want to talk about basketball. 
"Hey, Toohey," he yelled to the team's chaplain, Father William Toohey, sitting a few rows up on the chartered flight. "Hell of a homily tonight. I liked that stuff about inner strength." 
The wink. 

"Where'd you steal it from, Toohey, the Pope?" 
Father Toohey, one of Digger's closest friends, was not to be outdone. 
"No, Digger," was Toohey's deadpan response. "I stole it from Al McGuire, the same guy you steal your best lines from." 
Everyone laughed, Digger hardest of all. 
Several months later, after Bill Toohey's sudden death, Digger and I remembered our mutual friend. 
"What a guy," he said after he served his friend as pallbearer at the funeral. "No ego, no loud mouth, just a soft, quiet message that helped people understand a little bit about life." 
In his own way (never, how­ever soft, nor quiet) Digger had a similar effect on people around him. Like the Friday afternoon he called me and asked what I was doing at eight the next morning. 
"It's Saturday, I'll be sleep­ing," was my unimaginative re­sponse. 
He invited me to Logan Center with him to play basketball with handicapped children. 
'A Notre Dame Man is someone who cares passionatelyabout things that need caring about ... who refuses to acceptthings that are wrong, even though accept~ng lhem would be eas1er ... Someone like Digger Phelps. 
So I went. He played, I watched. He signed autographs, posed for pictures, talked to every kid and every family and it was noon when we were finished. No newspapers, no television cameras, no publicity, no credit. 
"Hey, I got it lucky," he said on the way back to campus. "I'm healthy, my family is healthy, we're doing OK. What you get, sometimes, you gotta give back." 
For many years Notre Dame and Digger had a give and take relationship. Notre Dame gave him fame and fortune, a plat­form to speak from, and, quite frankly, a lifetime's ability to earn a much-better-than-good living. 
In return, Digger gave back a sense of pride in knowing that nothing that happened on his side of the ACC was illegal, or unethical or potentially embarrassing to those of us who care about such things. He gave us memories, 'moments,' and the very best years of a life and a career during the which there was never one second that any of us had to wonder whether he wanted to be somewhere else. 
For you can be sure of this: Digger Phelps only wanted two things from his profession-to coach at Notre Dame and to bring home a national championship. That the latter never happened must not, in any way, tarnish or somehow detract from what is remembered about Digger's time at Notre Dame. 
"Who's a man? He's a man! He's a Notre Dame Man!" 
-old Notre Dame cheer 

things aboutMacintosh. 
You cansaymany 
You would think that some­where in Webster's Unabridged that there would be a definition of such an oft-used phrase. 
Notre Dame Man. 
With all due respect to Webster (and to the women of Notre Dame who must allow me to use the phrase under­standing it's generic applica­tion) I would like to offer a definition of my own. 
A Notre Dame Man is some­one-not necessarily a student or alumnus-who loves the place and knows that it is spe­cial. Someone who takes what good the place has to offer and gives back anything it asks. 
A Notre Dame Man is some­one who cares passionately about things that need caring about. Someone who refuses to accept things that are wrong, even though accepting them would be easier. Someone who yells sometimes and fights sometimes and cries sometimes and is not afraid to do any of those things when he feels a need to. Someone who doesn't always win or even come close, but who knows instinctively that trying is what counts. 
Someone Notre Dame is proud of. 
Someone like Digger Phelps. 


You can talk about how simple the Apple Macintosh computer is to use. Or how it can think the way you think. Or how compatible it is with other computers. 
But think again when the word "expensive" comes to mind. Because it's just not true any more. 
Introducing the Macintosh Classic· computer. It's the most affordable Macintosh, yet it has all the capabilities you need to handle basic applications, such as 
analysis. The Classic is acompletely integrated Macintosh system. Its monitor, keyboard, mouse and system software are all included, as are extras you might not expect-such as built-in networking and the Apple SuperDrive~ disk drive, which lets the Classic read from and write to MS-OOS, OS/2, and Prooosftles. 
Stop in today. We'll show you how it's possible for nearly anyone to afford a Macintosh. Comfortably.

Men's tennis readies for final home match vs. Michigan 
By JENNIFER MARTEN 
Sports Writer 
The seniors on the Notre Dame men's tennis team will hav1~ several goals in mind when they play in front of a home crowd for the last time today in a dual meet with Michigan. 
After not being invited to the NCM tournament last year, the team and especially the seniors would like to receive an invita­tion this year. 
Senior Hyan Wenger would like to see the team at the NCAAs this year. "It (making the NCAAs) has been a goal of the team all year after we came so close last year. I'll do whatever I can to help the team realize that goal," he said. 
The team closes their home season this afternoon just a few days after capturing the Midwestern Collegiate Con­ference championship. The match holds special meaning for the seniors. 
"It's kind of sad. I've had four fun years playing for Notre Dame with good guys and great coaches. It hasn't really hit me yet that this is my last home match," said Wenger. 
Team captain Paul Odland expressed similar feelings about his last home match. 
"It's bittersweet. We control our own destiny. There's no way we'll be ashamed of our season, because we worked hard all season," he said. 
The 19th-ranked Irish will have to remain intense against the Wolverines, who come to Notre Dame ranked third in the region and sporting a 10-3 overall record. With a 16-10 record, the Irish are ranked second in the region just above the Michigan squad.

Wednesday's match holds several repercussions in terms of an invitation to the NCAA tournament. A strong showing against the respected Michigan team could improve the Irish's ranking and their chances of making the tournament. 
Last year, the Irish, ranked 16th in the nation, were not in­vited, but the 17th-and 19th­ranked teams were. Notre Dame's schedule was cited as the reason. With a tougher schedule this year, the Irish are hoping to win a bid, but still standing in their way the rest of the season are Michigan, Wisconsin, and Ball State. 
Barring any unexpected problems, junior David DiLucia, sophomores Hon Rosas, Mark Schmidt, Chuck Coleman, Andy Zurcher, and Will Forsyth will be playing for the Irish. According the Notre Dame coach Bob Bayliss, the group is "healthy and ready to go." 
They will most likely face Michigan's David Kass, Dan Brakus, Scott Cuppett, John Karzen, Mitch Hubenstein, and John Lingon. 
Kass will provide a formidable threat to DiLucia. Ranked in the top 10 as a sin­gles player all year, Kass is one of the quickest players in the country. Brakus, one of the top players in Canada, could also cause problems for the Irish. 
"Michigan is a powerful team, aggressive and very danger­ous," said Bayliss. "We will have to be at our best to beat them."

HOUSTON -Defending champion Katerina Maleeva o Bulgaria used a steady serve to overcome erratic Christina Papadaki of Greece on Tuesday night in a second-round match o the $350,000 Virginia Slims of Houston. 
Maleeva, seeded fourth, lost only one point on her serve in tlH~ first set and put 70 percent of her first serves into play as she beat Papadaki, 6-3, 6-2 in a 67-minute match. 
"I didn't have much fun because all she did was miss," Maleeva said. "The second set she was missing so mut:h but I was glad we had some battles at the end." 
Sabo loses in divorce trial 
LANSING, Mich. -Chris Sabo has struck out in the Michigan Court of Appeals. 
The $1.25 million-a-year Cincinnati Reds third baseman must pay 10 percent of his salary, or $125,000, as alimony to ex-wife Catherine Sabo, the court ruled in a decision released Monday. 
"Given the personal sacrlnces she made for his now-successful major league baseball career, and the noticeable diserepan<~y be­tween their earning potentials, the amount of alimony Is fair and equitable," the three-judge panel unanimously rul<ld. 
The Sabos met at the University of Michigan, where he play~~d baseball and studied history while she was an education major. They were married in 198a, the year he dropped out of school after being drafted into the Reds' minor league system. 
The couple separated six. weeks after the 1988 sHason began, when Sabo filed for divorce. Circuit Judge Honald Taylor ordered him to turn over 10 percent of his salary as alimony for five years, beginning in 1989. 
On appeal, Sabo argued that his ex-wife was not entitled to al­imony based on the short duration of their marriage and her own professional skills and college degree. 
"If Chris Sabo were injured and lost his baseball job, his only other job skill would be 'flipping burgers,"' his legal papers said.

Softball splits twin bill with Sycamores 
Special to the Observer 
The Notre Dame softball team (19-19) split a doubleheader with Indiana State yesterday afternoon, winning the opener, 4-0 and losing the nightcap, 6­1. 
In the first game, junior Missy Linn pitched her fourth shutout of the season to raise her record to 9-10. Linn gave up only four hits and did not walk a batter. 
The Irish gave Linn all the support she would need in the fourth inning when Megan Fay hit a two-run single to score Ronny Alvarez and Ruth Kmak. Notre Dame tacked on two insurance runs in the sixth off losing pitcher Heather Fuller (6-9), who was hurt by three Sycamore errors. 

Indiana State (11-24) made up for its lack of offense quickly in game two, scoring two runs in the first. Connie Fiems and Lisa Watkins hit back-to-back doubles with two outs off Irish starter Carrie Miller (3-5), followed by Cindy Wilson's RBI single. 
Notre Dame answered back in its half of the first when Laurie Sommerlad reached on a Sycamore error, took second on a wild pitch, advanced to third on another error, and scored on Rachel Crossen's two-out single. 
Indiana State put the game away in the third, scoring two more runs off Miller. The Sycamores then tallied twice in the fifth off reliever Staci Alford to account for the final score. 
The Irish are next in action today at 3:30 p.m. on the Notre Dame Softball Field, hosting a doubleheader with Saint Joseph's (7-11). 
Magic dishes his way to NBA assist record 
INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) ­James Worthy first met Magic Johnson when the two were teenagers -Johnson was a star at Michigan State trying to convince Worthy to join him there. 
Worthy didn't, attending North Carolina instead, but Johnson made an impression on him. 
"He was a real nice person then, and that hasn't changed," Worthy said Monday night after Johnson, his teammate with the Los Angeles Lakers for nine seasons, surpassed Oscar Robertson as the NBA's assist leader. "He was raised the right way, his parents deserve a lot of the credit. 
"He's such a giving person. That makes this record so ap­propriate." 
Johnson, the conductor of "Showtime" for the Lakers since 1979, got 19 assists in a 112-106 victory over the Dallas Mavericks. 
Playing in his 12th NBA sea­son, Johnson needed nine as­sists to break Robertson's record of9,887. 
Robertson got his total in 1,040 games over 14 seasons, averaging 9.5 assists. Johnson now has 9,898 assists in 871 games, an average of 11.4 as­sists per game. 
The record-tying assist came with 6:46 left in the second quarter when Johnson set up Worthy for a short jump shot. 
Johnson got his record­breaker with 5:44 left in the pe­riod, lobbing a pass to Terry Teagle, who made a 15-foot turnaround jumper from the right baseline. 
Worthy said he wasn't disap­pointed he didn't get to score the record-breaking basket. 
"Not at all," he said. "We just wanted to make sure he got it." 
Johnson said he tried to get the ball to Worthy twice, "but he wouldn't take the shot." 
Teagle said he would have preferred for either Worthy or Byron Scott to have scored the big basket because they've been Johnson's teammates for so long. 
"But you have to take your shots," Teagle said. "I think it's 

Soon after Johnson surpassed Robertson's record, he was in tears during a 15-minute on­court celebration before a sellout crowd of 17,505 at the Forum. 
"I figured it would be emo­tional," he said. "I thought about all the times we played shirts and skins, hoping one day to get into the NBA. Then finally getting into the NBA. ... 
"I cried for all the times I shoveled snow off the walk and practiced hook shots with my dad (in Michigan growing up). I cried for my dad. He's the one -he's the only reason I'm here. He explained to me how to share the basketball." 
Johnson's father, Earvin Johnson Sr., watched the game via satellite from his home in Michigan. 
It was a rather interesting irony that Teagle was on the receiving end of the record­breaking assist since Teagle wouldn't be with the Lakers right now had it not been for Johnson's generosity last Seotemb?.r.

Kindred to deliver Red Smith Lecture 

By RICH SZABO 
Sports Writer 

Following a grueling 27 -game road schedule to open up the season, the Notre Dame base­ball team sought to find a rhythm in the comforts of home. 
After sweeping a three-game series against Xavier this past weekend, the Irish (19-12) look to continue their solid play as they take on Chicago State in a doubleheader tonight at Covaleski Stadium, starting at 5:00pm. 
"It's great to play well," said Irish coach Pat Murphy, "and we have been starting to play with a bit of an attitude since we've been home. We had a few meetings to talk about attitude, and I think the team is taking it to heart. 
The Irish have come up win­ners against Chicago State in 12 of their last 13 meetings, but, says Murphy, "They play tough every game, with everything to gain and nothing to lose. After a while, it can start to catch up with you a bit." 
In the first game of the dou­bleheader, freshman Tom Price (3-2) is slated to pitch for the Irish. Price, a highly recruited freshman out of Edwardsville, Ill, has fit well into the Irish starting rotation, and Murphy feels that he can count on six quality innings every time Price pitches. 
The nightcap has Pat Leahy scheduled as the probable starter. Leahy was an All­American as a freshman last year, but Murphy feels that such national success has not affected him or David Sinnes, another 1990 freshman All­American. 
"We've talked about their sit­uation," said Murphy, "and they try to block out all of those dis­tractions. Leahy and Sinnes are having better years, but it just doesn't show up in the stats be­cause our schedule has been so much tougher. We wanted to play this way though. If you ask the players how they feel about the schedule, they'll tell you they wanted it like this." 
Matt Haas, a freshman catcher who had a home run 
ag'ainst Xavier, said, "Coach Murphy is great, and he moti­vates well. Mostly, though, we motivate ourselves, and try to stay mentally tough all the time. We've competed against the best teams in the country, and we've been in just about all of the games. It's not like we went in and just got blown off the field, so our record is not frustrating. It's not frustrating 
. when you realize that with a couple breaks, the outcome would have been different." The Irish will be playing tonight's twinbill at Covaleski Stadium, which is the Irish home field along with Jake Kline field, but which Murphy feels is not the true home of the Irish. "We probably get about 200 people for each game at Covaleski," said Murphy. "When we play on the road, we some­times play in front of 5,000 to 6,000 people. It's a huge advan­tage to be a home team and have 5,000 people behind you, because the support does affect young people. If we had a place on campus for the students, they would get involved and would start to realize what kind of program we have." The Irish are finally at home, but they have to face the added adversity of the weather here in South Bend. Three home games have already been rained out in the past week, but the team has stayed focused. They Irish will have plenty of offensive firepower as they bat­tle Chicago State. Captain Joe Binkiewicz went 4-for-9 this weekend, raising his season slugging percentage to .923. Eric Danapilis also had a im­pressive series, going 7 -for-11 with four runs scored and six RBis. Frank Jacobs and Greg Layson will also provide offen­sive sparks for Notre Dame. Murphy recorded his 150th win at Notre Dame over the weekend, and the Irish look to add to that total against their non-conference opponent. The Irish currently stand at 19-12, seeking to strengthen their claim as one of the nation's best and prove that the NCAA made a mistake in not inviting them to the tournament last year.

You are a Notre Dame or Saint Mary's student, some­where between the ages of 18 and 21. 
You do not remember, most likely because you cannot re­member, when you were three or four or six years old and the University of San Francisco had a basketball team and that basketball team had a record of 29-0. You were too young to know that Notre Dame was hosting San Francisco in a game the Irish had to win to extend its season into the NCAA playoffs. 
You were not on campus the week before the game so you do not remember the atmosphere or the excitement. You didn't attend the Friday night pep rally, nor hear the coach's promise and the students' response. 
"Tomorrow," the coach in­structed, "be in your seat one hour before game time. All you have to do is chant 'Twenty nine -and -one!' and we'll do the rest." 

A native of Atlanta, Ill., and a graduate of Illinois Wesleyan University, Kindred has covered sporting events in 47 states and nine countries. Since becoming a columnist he has written about every World Series, Super Bowl, Kentucky Derby and NCAA Basketball Championship as well as five Olympics. 
Kindred's is the first Red Smith Lecture on sportswriting. Bob Hammel, sports editor of the Bloomington (Ind.) Herald­Times and president of the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association, will respond to Kindred's speech during a discussion period fol­lowing the lecture.

Because he could throw bet­ter than most of his buddies, the boy was the shortstop in baseball games and the quar­terback in football. He grew up in a New Jersey town of 10,000 people, an hour's drive from the big city. With his father, the boy would go to the bus station in their little town. They took the Port Authority bus into New York City. They hopped into the subway to Shea Stadium and got out behind the center-field wall. The hoy stood under an open sky and looked up at how big the place was. Years later he would remember what he said the first time he saw it. He said, "Wow."
