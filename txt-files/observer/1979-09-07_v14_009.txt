No policy change is reported in 
the consumption of alcohol by 
minors on the grounds of Saint 
Mary's College, according to 
Sister Karol]ackowski, director 
of Residence Life and Housing. 
The SMC 1979-1980 Student 
Handbook states that: "Indi­
ana State Law prohibits those 
who are under 21 years of age 
from buying or consuming al­
coholic beverages. Therefore 
only those students who are 
over 21 years may use alcohol 
on the campus of Saint 
Mary's." 

Even with this permit senior 
students at SMC are not per­
mitted to have either room or 
section parties. There are 
designated areas within each 
hall where residents of the 
college and their guests may 
consume alcohol at social 
events. 

The areas set aside for this 
purpose include: the Saint 
Mary's clubhouse located by 
Holy Cross Hall, the Le Mans 
Tower party room, the student 
lounges in Regina, and the 
McCandless piano room. When 
holding parties in these rooms 
the host students must secure 
permission from the Director of 
Student Activities and insure 
that all guests are 21 or over. 

Jackowski stated that, while she believes over-<;onsumption of alcohol to be a problem among students, there 1s rarely a flagrant violation of the rule by minors on Saint Mary's campus. When questioned as to whether the rules of the

The United Way of St. Joseph County will kick off its annual fund-raising campaign with a family picnic Saturday at Potawatomi Park. The picnic will begin at 11 a.m., and the official opening of the campaign wUI take place at the band shell 
at 1 p.m.

Saint Mary's has both an alcohol education council and a program dealing with alcohol abuse. The alcohol education council's purpose is to set up alcohol education programs and bring in speakers to deal with the problems of both addiction and abuse. The council is made 
up of hall presidents, resident assistants and representatives from the faculty, the admini­stration, and campus ministry.

Katz lectures on holocaust 
by Kathryn Casey 
Professor Steven T. Katz, chairman of the Department of Religious Studies at Dartmouth University, told a crowd of about 225 in the Memorial Library last night that he has "become an expen on killings" as a result of his studies concerning the holocaust which destroyed six million ] ews in Europe between 1941 and 1945. 
Katz observed that ] ews have suffered many tragedies over the last 2,000 years. He said that while ] ewish tradition it­self has not been successfully challenged, there were never­theless unigue elements in­volved in Hitler's anti-Semitic crusade. 
Katz explained that the pri­mary oddrty in the slaughter of the Jews rests on the fact that Hitfer intended genocide, which Katz defined as the "intent to destroy an entire people or an entire nation.'' He cited such massive killings as those of the Armenians in World War I and of the native American Indians as instances in which the intent was not genocide, but a desire to make space for those in power. 
"Hitler viewed the world as basically a spiritual struggle,'' Katz sard. "He saw himself as doing God's work by destroying the forces of darkness." 
Accordins to Katz, while Nazi anti-Semiusm has its basis' in Christian attitudes and the "mythic image of the ] ew as devil,'' it is unique in that it is founded in racial rather than religious discrimination. 

Begin flys home happy with evergrowing friendship 
TEL AVlV, Israel (AP) ­Egyptian President Anwar Sad­at flew home Thursday after a summit with Prime Minister Menachem Begin, happy with "the ever-growing friendship" between the Egyptians and Israelis but urging quick pro­gress on the Palestinian issue. 
Shortly after Sadat's plane left Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport, the Israeli military command announced that an army patrol had intercepted a band of Arab terrorists slipping across the Jordanian border 14 hours earl­ier. A communique said the band was driven off after an exchange of flre, dropping gre­nades and ammunition belts as it fled, in action 35 miles east of Haifa where Sadat stayed dur­ing his three-day visit. There was no report of casualities.

peace as well as efforts to _J... negotiate an autonomous Pa­lestinian region in Israeli-occu­pied territory. 
Sadat, apparently unaware of the border action during the last night of his stay, stressed in a departure ceremony "the vital necessity to make progress on the Palestinian question soon.'' 
The "true nature of peace... is a comprehensive peace that encompasses every aspect of the dispute," said Sadat. re­peating a favorite theme. 
ture political status of]eru­salem's Arab population, an emotional issue that Sadat said needed more time·and careful study. 
"Christian anti-Semitism al­ways allowed for conversion... Like and M&M, Christian on the outside, ] ewish on the inside," Katz observed. "Race made the Jewish people perm­anently inferior and sub-human in the eyes of the Nazis," he said. ''And what do you do if 
you have lice?  You  call  the  
exterminator.''  
Nazi  racist  policy  was  an  

unusual blend of technolosy, bureaucracy and totalitanan principles, Katz noted. It was an anonymous system in which everyone did his job as best he could without worry of personal 
re~ponsib~lity. P~ofessional 
pnde requrred a grven worker to be the "best damned ] ew­catcher in the business." 
Katz remarked that the broad­cast of ''Holocaust'' had more impact on the public than all prior books and reports on the 
·slaughter of the]ews. 
the lecture was the first in a series of lectures on J udaica sponsored by Mr. and 'Mrs. Bun Liss. 
Katz holds degrees from the ·Universities of Rutgers, Cam­bridge and New York. He is the author of The Nature of Reli­

Architects present library model 
by Charlotte Bradley 
Models of the new Saint Mary's library were presented by architects Evans Woolen and Erik Sueberkrop at a forum last night. 
The site for the new library is the southeast portion of the dining green. The architects said the design for the building is "sympathetic" to the other buildmgs on campus. 
The two-story brick building will have gables and dormer windows sloping up to a flat roof. Inside, mezzanines will overlook each floor. The interi­or design includes plans for an area with vending machines, and group study rooms. 
The matn entrance will be on the south side of the building. The structure will be accessible from the underground -tunnel system. 
One of the architects said he had hopes the new library would bring back to the Saint Mary's campus "the people who ought to be here in their own library." 
Sr. Bernice Hollenhorst, head librarian at Saint Mary's, said she is "very excited" about the designs. She added that Saint Mary's has needed a new library for a long time because the old one is overcrowded.

tion, students asked questions concerning the design, accessi­bility of the library to the ' handicapped, and security mat­ters. 
The architects said there were  tentative plans to begin con­struction of the new library next spring, depending on monetary factors. According to Woollen, the structure will take approxi­mately a year and a half to build. 
A special Board of Regents meetmg will take place tonight to approve the schematic draw­ings so that further plans for construction can be made.

Vanek noted, however, that the bookstore is short on gener­al biology books because the biology department recently ad­mitted 30 more students to the class. She explained that the textbook companies need three weeks to fill an order, conse­quently, students are in for an uncomfortable wait if books for a certain course run out. 
The primary reason for a textbook shortage is "shifting class enrollments at the semes­ter's start," Vanek said. 
If even a few students add a certain class, the books could run out simply because the

ou'd think that after six semesters of buying books I'd get used to the ordeal. But I s_till hold my breath everytime I lift the cover to check the price · ofa book. And I still shudder as I count the digit~ .... 
I can't decide which is worse: the science course with a $25.00 hardcover text and $6.00 ac­companying workbook, or the government course with seven $6. 50 paperbacks. I guess it's a toss-up; they're both pretty hard on the pocketbook. 
Perhaps book-buying would be if there were more

selling books se­
Unfortunately, I have had very little luck selling used books, and even less luck buying them. 
As near as I can calculate it, the average life SJ?an of a ~ardcover text on this campus IS two or three semesters; for paperbacks it's three or four at most. (fhis accounts for the heavy box of lntro. texts and obscure paperbacks sitting on the floor of every domer' s closet.) 
Of eleven books I bought this week, four were 1979 editions,· and most of the rest were 1978 editions. Many of these were updated editions of texis used last semester for the same class. 
Presumably, these updated versions ensure that the quality of our education remains top-

I realize that rapid advances are being made in some fields of study,· and texts for courses in these fields should be up­dated as often as necessary. But I don't believe a yearly text change is necessary or justifi­able for a majority of the courses offered on this campus. 
In my opinion, professors should carefully select good texts and stick by them for a few years--until a change is truly necessary. A good profes­sor should be able to incor­porate a moderate amount of new material into his class lectures, rather than requiring students to purchase brand new texts every year.

'Dreaded alumni' steal away 
Michigan tix 
Dear Editor: 
The Notre Dame student of today has a grim future await­ing him. For his destiny defines that he become the "dreaded alumnus" within the 
·matter of but a few years. The "dreaded alumnus," that ghastly beast who by contri­buting a few dollars per year receives the monster status which enables him to perch his repulsive body on the fifty yard line at home games and thoughtlessly steal away all of the student tickets to any away football game. 
I personally can't picture my­self returnins to a game in three years wuh the threat that eight thousand students, if given a dark alley, knife and alibi, would with no hesi;ation slit my throat. 
The fact of the matter is that as the Michigan game draws closer, there are no student tickets available. Maybe should correct myself. Sixty tickets will be available to students next week, as a result of alumni cancellations. This amount is outrageous compared to the six thousand tickets that Michigan gave Notre Dame. 
Ah yes, but I am merely a foolish ND student who refuses to accept the decrees of that almighty Notre Dame sovereign himself. May his grace forgive my selfishness and accept my pledge of loyalty.

Letters to a Lone~y God 
Sometimes I wish that God would try a little harder. Sometimes, when people are grieving or in trouble, I wish I could scream: ''God, get off your everlasting duff and HELP 1HEM!" I know he's busy. I know He needed a rest on the seventh day. But it's already half-time to etermty of the week following creation, and He still hasn't tempered the north wind to shorn the lamb's nakedness. 
Sometimes, for me as a priest, God's inefficiency is embarrassing. There are ghettos in the country where the rats are eating the child­ren. Dachau could happen again; and if racism triumphs, Martin Luther King could have died in vain. The Pope musn't visit the North of Ireland, and there are families in India too hungry to cry themselves to sleep. 
Thts summer, I dined with a couple whose son had been killed last year in a senseless act of violence. Six months later, their only child was hospitalized from a psychotic react­ion to mescaline. During the dinner, a friend of the grieved mother kept whispering to me: "She has never forgiven God for what has happen­ed." I thought: "Imagine God needing a.n absolution." That's what it's like being a priest: You are forced to become an apologist for an unabsolved Father. You think: the Father would have more friends ifHe made His own apologies. 
Last week, there was a death of a young man from Brooklyn. Supersti­tious people have a belief that deaths, when they occur, come upon us in sets of three. I am not 
~ superstitious, merely Irish; heaven seems more faithful in confirming our fears than sustaining our hopes. Last w·eek, having heard of the deaths of Prr.>fessor Evans and of Cathy Guth­erY: I found myself waiting to hear the\~ws of a third death. I did not

IfI could have flexed my muscles in a tank top vestment, they might have listened. I had only the vulgarities of an undertaking parlor to assist me, and the promises of a liturgy that Italians have resisted being hooked on for over a thousand years. 
On Saturday, in Brooklyn, God wasn't conspicuous for His presence at Stephen's funeral. I invoked His 'name, /raised His wisdom, and declare Him to be lovable. I couldn't do more for Him, unless He helped Himself. Maybe He was there, helping Himself; not meaning to be disresl?ectful, I got the feeling He was leavmg all the work for me. 
I told them in the homily: "Steve came from jBrooklyn· to the green acres of Notre Dame because he had questions to ask. Sometimes at the grotto of Our Lady near the lake, he would ask questions of God. Some­times in my room, he would ask questions of me. Steve was always more curious about matters of faith than most people. I would .quickly run out of answers to the things he wanted to know. Now he has theologians to answer him, and the experience of the saints. Now he has the living God as his teacher, and God's holy light as his wisdom." 
I don't think the rapture found in the 
living God was a truth they felt close · 
to. They would rather think of Steven 
with them, at home in Brooklyn, 
competing in the discos for the 
sexiest chick. 
They Ithanked me for coming from Notre Dame, and being there. They were pleased I had come. God, from his long experience, must know that it's not what you say or do; it'~ simply being there that counts.-I wtsh God could be more communicative on the occasions when He's being there .

have to wait long. The day after Joe Evan's funeral, the phone rang JUSt , before dinner. A votce unfamiliar to me said: "I'm sorry to be calling with bad news, but Steve Sanfilippo, a friend of yours, died this mornin~.'' "But he can't have died," I satd. "He was never even sick." Only later did I remember: it was the third death. The third death always happens to someone you consider 
most immune. 
On Monday, last week, I was one of 
the concelebrants at Joe Evan's re­
quiem mass. On Saturday, I offi­
ciated at Steve's funeral in Brooklyn. 
Death is thoughtless in scheduling us 
for/rief. You sometimes wonder if 
Go pays attention to what death is 
doing. 
Every death, in its particular cir­
cumstances, brings us sadness; yet at 
the edge of sorrow, a hope of 
resurrection is celebrated. In Brook­
lyn, among Italians, Lazarus appears 
to be a man of no reputation; the grief 
at Steven's death seemed to be 
without hope. The consolation of the 
liturgy had the appearance of bounc­
ing off the dark sorrow of the 
mourners as though they were shi­
elded behind bullet-proof glass. 
Steve;s grandmother kept lament­
ing in a loud voice: ''This is not fair. 
They have taken my baby, and it's 
not fair; it's not fair." 
Steve's father said: "He was only twenty-three, and he never had a chance. When he graduated from Notre Dame two years ago, I wanted him to be a doctor, and he never had a chance." 
"It was the sickness that got him," 
Steve's uncle said. "He didn't have 
the strength to study.'' 
''Last March, he blacked out for a 
couple of days," Steve's father said. 
''They told me it was a nervous 
breakdown. The doctor put him on 
. tranquilizers. Last week, when he got sick away from home, he went to the psychiatric ward of the hospital because they had told him in March he was schizophrenic." 

"The doctors 1don't know from nothing," the uncle said. 
''At the psych ward, they thought he might be on drugs," the father continued. "They checked him for drugs, and he was dean as a whistle. He never took drugs, and his body was clean, without a mark or a scar on it. So they did an autopsy, to fmd out what he died of. I didn't want them carving up the body, without a mark on it and clean as a whistle, but it would have killed me not knowing what my boy died of." 
''The poor kid never had a chance,'' said the uncle. 
"He had a cancer on the brain," his father said. "For a long time, he had a.cancer on the brain, and they said it was very massive. Last March, they told me he had a nervous breakdown; they told me he was a schizophrenic, and all the time he had a cancer on the brain.'' 
So, on Saturday, I went to Brooklyn 
to help an Italian family that. 
couldn't be conned with the pieties of 
faith. A year ago, Steven had taken 
me to see "Saturday Night Fever." 
"That's it," he satd. "That's my 
world, that's my Brooklyn. The 2001 
disco where the kids danced is just 
three blocks from my house." 
After the movie, we travelled over to 
the Verazanno bridge, from which 
a kid in the movie had fallen as he 
tried to prove he had a man's 
courage.

"In Brooklyn," Steve said, "it's not 
enough to be merely macho, because 
Brooklyn is a super-macho world. 4t 
the discos, all the guys wear thetr 
tank top suits and flex their muscles 
as though they could bust out of 
chains. All the chicks love it, and put 
out their sexiest vibes."

"Oh no, we're still alive and kicking. We're not in any trouble.'' He would not com­ment on whether the incidents would affect the admission policy of Goose's. 
The students in question will next go to court, where they may receive a small fine and a maximum of 60 days in jail. However, Captain Vince Smith·, head of the Police Depart­ment's Special Operations Divi­sion, pomted out that he has never heard of violators receiv­ing such a stiff sentence, or anything more than probation. 
Smith also noted that although falsifying identification is a felony, it is normally treated as a misdemeanor, and offenders are charged only with ):5osses­sion, unless a bar chooses to press charges, which is ex­tremely rare. 
"For every ten arrests, we let another 20 go,'' Smith added. "We're not trying to cause any big problems, but four or five years ago, it was common to see 16-or 17-year-olds in these establishments. So our object then was to really crack down and maintain a tighter stan­dard.'' 
Smith also refuted Cor­by's claim that this was their first incident in several years. ''We went in there three or four times last year, and several times the year before that. We monitor these establishments day in and day out, but we let more go than we keep." 
He also discounted the term "raid" for the actions his department has taken, because they only go into uncrowded establishments with just two to four officers. "We would rather not arrest a large num­ber ofpeople. We get the same benefit by arresung two or three as by arresting 40 or 50.'' However, Smith added that when his officers do enter an establishment, there is no "se­lective enforcement,'' and all violators are taken out. 
The captain also noted that the Indiana Excise Police: do con­duct what may be more ac­curately termed a raid. The Excise Police are special en­forcers of the Alcoholic Beve­rage Control regulations, and along with State Police may enter crowded bars with 20 or more officers to make mass arrests.

'Fill-in' Stephan looks toward second trip to tennis Nationals 
by Mark Hannuksela Sports Writer 
"Game, set, and match to Miss Stephan. She wins 2-6, 6-4, 6-3." As the umpire declared her the Midwest Regional champion in the number six singles bracket, Tina Stephan expected to find herself waking up back home in 
Barrin~ton,  Illinois.  But she  wasn't  
dreammg.  She  had  indeed  won  a  
storybook championship.  

"I never expected anything like that to happen-it just took me completely by surprise,'' stated the sophomore bust­ness major recently. "I was quite nervous at the beginning of the match, but luckily I settled down as things got going." 
Getting to the finals of the regional tournament was no easy task for Stephan, a girl who had played doubles all through high school and last year as a member of Sharon Petro's women's tennis team. To begin with, she only played the tournament as a last minute replacement for Stacey Obremskey, Petro's regular number six player. Obremskey, an Indiana native, was chosen last spring to be a member of the Queen's Court for the Indianapolis 500 auto race. 
''When Stacey came up with her . conflict, we decided to go ahead and use Tina, even though she had always been a doubles player," said Petro. "Then, when we saw the draw, we feared the worst." 
That draw would see Stephan meet Angie Nyland of Augustana College, the top seeded player in the tournament, in th~ first round. Stephan managed a hard fought three set victory in a match marred by the appearance of linesmen (not a normal procedure unless there is an excess of questionable calls in the course of a match.) 
Tina had little time to savor her victory, because ''the luck of the draw'' had pttted her against the number three seed, Esther Cleaves of Dennison, in round two. Stephan's straight set victory put her in the fmals against unseeded Merrill Smith of Kalamazoo. After two tough opponents, this one should have been easy. It wasn't. 
''In the first set, all I could think of was going to Nationals," said Stepans. ''But when I lost the set, I told myself to forget about Nationals and to. just concentrate on this match. Once I got that concentration back, I forgot all about being nervous.'' 
That concentration earned Tina the right to travel to the "University of Denver, the site of the National tour­nament. Unfortunately for Stephan, this was the beginning of the end of her Cinderella story. 
"I was really in awe of the fact that I was actually playing in the tournament. I was somewhat nervous because I had another tough draw (Donna Morris of Cal State Bakersfield, the third seed, in the first round.) I really wanted 'to play 
as  well  as  I  had  in  Regionals,  but  
unfortunately I didn't."  
With the 6-3, 6-4 loss, Stephan  was  

placed into the consolation bracket where she met Barbara Mangan of the tournament's host school, the Univer­sity of Denver. 
After the match, Coach Petro com­mented, "Tina didn't really play poorly (she lost 6-2, 6-4), but she didn't play her best tennis etther. In spite of that, I'm not disappointed with her perfor­mance. She really exerted a tremen­dous amount of effort, and I think the experience will · pay off for her next season. She is willing to work hard, and I ·think shel actually will work to reach her potential. I have great hopes for her future." 
Rather than assess her own future, Tina was more inclined to talk about the upcoming season of her Irish team­mates. . 
"We are a much improved team over last year. I think that we are capable of

Buchanan breaks 
ankle, out 
for entire year 

by Paul Mullaney Assistant Sports Editor 
Notre Dame's 1979 football outlook took a turn for the worse Thursday afternoon when sophomore fullback Pete Buchanan suffered a broken left ankle. 
Irish coach Dan Devine announced that Buchanan was scheduled to undergo surgery at St. Joseph's Hospital this morning and will miss the entire 1979 season.

Navratilova wins at U.S. Open 
NEW YORK (AP) -Second-seeded Martina Navratilova easily beat eighth­seeded Kerry Reid 6-4, 6-1, and fourth-seeded Vitas Gerulaitis got by South AfricanJohan Kriek 5-7, 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 Thursday night in the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open Tennis Champion­ships. 
Navratilova, the two-time Wimbledon champion who never has won the U.S. title, made short work of Reid, who had trouble at the net. They traded service breaks in the second set, but Reid could not hold her own thereafter. 
In the final game, she had break point, but Navratilova drew even wtth a cross-court volley winner, and Reid overhit on the next two points to yield the match. 
Navratilova will face third-seeded Tra­cy Austin in the semifinals.
