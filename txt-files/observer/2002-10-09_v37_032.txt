As the international atmos­phere increases in volatility and the United States prepares for military action in the Middle East, war is becoming a looming reality for Notre Dame ROTC stu­denl<i. "One of my friends who gradu­ated last year was with the 82nd Airborne," said Sara McMahon, a junior in the Army ROTC pro­gram. "He was going to get sent over there [the Middle East]. but now they're holding him back. It kind of hit home when he told us that." Despite this daunting possibili­ty, however, Notre Dame ROTC students and officers said that combat has not been a frequent topic of discussion. "It's more or less just business as usual with us," said John Phunter, a senior marine. "I think it's probably because, in selecting the military, you sort of just have to go into it."

Harris speaks on dangers to democracy 
By SHEiIA FLYNN News Writer 
Jay T. Harris, who sparked a national journalistic debate when he resigned as publish­er of the San Jose Mercury News in 2001 on ethical principles, s a i d Tu-esday that the American experi­ment of democracy is in dan­ger of disintegration. 
"It has come to my attention that fewer people than I would think have a clear understanding of what the framers were trying to do," said Harris, the 2002-03 John 
W. Gallivan Journalist in Residence at the University of Notre Dame. 
In his lecture entitled "Journalism, Democracy and the 'American Experiment,'" Harris traced the develop­ment of America's democratic republic since its conception, citing observations about democracy and journalisn¥ by politicians and philosophers throughout its history. 
"It's sad to say both are less vital than they have been in the past," Harris said. 
Harris said the decline in citizen participation in gov­ernment and highlighted this passivity as a threat to true democracy. 
"Being a good citizen is more a matter of collective 


responsibility than it is a mat­
ter of individual rights," 
Harris said. "Citizenship is 
about responsibility -having 
more than a passing familiari­
ty of the issues of the day." 
Phrases such as "the com­
mon good" have been forgot­
ten, Harris said, and need to 
be brought back into focus in 
order for democracy to exist 
as the institution that the 
Framers of the Constitution 
originally intended. 
Journalism, he said, is a tool 
that can be used to revamp 
the government. 
"Journalism is not responsi­ble for this state of affairs," Harris said of the media's influence on political and social life in America. "But it is certainly the case that jour­nalism has contributed to the lack of understanding and acceptance." 
When citizens are not seri­ous about the government, Harris said, it becomes diffi­cult for the press to focus on weighty issues because the audience is not receptive. 
Harris said this precarious situation is fixable, however, invoking the words of Jim Cary of the Columbia school of Journalism: "The American experiment is still in the lab. There is no nobler task for our generation than to move it along." 
'"Move it along' means get­ting it back on track," Harris said. "The pendulum has gone about as far as it can in one direction without it starting to swing back."

INSIDE COLUMN 
Alternative fall breaks 

I have a suggestion for anyone who is planning on going home for fall break and spending every day sleeping and watching television. 
Go on a service trip. Last year I was fortunate to be a part of a well-honored 
Mark

tradition, the Sorin 
Hall fall break ser­Zavodnyik 
vice trip. On the 
first Sunday of fall 
break, 50 residents Sports Wire from Sorin College, Editor 
1/3 of the dorm's 
population, 
embarked on a journey to Toronto. 
With the Canadians' hilarious accents and casual attitude towards carousing, we were certainly excited about the prospects of spending a week in Canada. However, in the end we found a place that gave us a chance to learn more about each other and gain some perspective on our lives. 
Eight hours later, when I saw the bright neon signs of the Labatt's Blue factory, I knew that we were home. We stayed at a Jesuit mission in Toronto that normally housed Jesuit retirees and other priests traveling through Canada. You can imagine the look on their faces when 50 American college students showed up at breakfast and ate all of the frosted flakes. 
Like most people on vacation, my compatriots and I were hoping to catch up on some sleep. We thought the ser­vice part ofthe trip was just something to pass the time between sleeping and going out. However that was not the case. On the first morning we were awakened at 8 a.m. and warned to get ready to be at work at 9. So, at 9:15 the gentlemen of Sorin College arrived at the work site to begin their service project. 
Our service project was to renovate halfway houses for troubled teens in the Toronto metropolitan area. The man who ran the organization was absolutely unforgettable. His name was David Baxter. He wore dangly, gold earrings, Nike warm-up suits, and enjoyed Maximum Ice. Despite his appearance and taste for strong Canadian beer, David Baxter was one of those people that can just blow you away with his complete selflessness. He got so much joy from helping others. 
There were three houses owned by the group and they all needed work. Over the course of the week, we did everything from cleaning gutters to painting kitchens. 
It was a vacation where not one man got any rest. Everyday we were up with the sun, not necessarily ready to work, but certainly present. During the day we worked hard, and at night we got an opportunity to enjoy the culture of Toronto. It was like we earned the right to party. 
Going on a service trip over fall break can teach you a great many lessons. Doing service gave me the opportunity to put into perspective what I'm doing with my life. Grades, internships, and other junk just aren't that important. When you can help other people improve their daily lives, it becomes very easy to identify and weed out the unimportant tribulations in your own iife. 
Sorin Hall is going to Detroit this

vice president for ethics and business conduct, at Tuesday's installment of the Cardinal O'Hara Lecture Series. 
An intentions-centered model is the most effective way to ensure ethical decision-making, said Andrews. 
Andrews, who oversees 70 ethics advisors, emphasized the importance of a pervasive ethi­cal culture. Advisers are placed in each business unit, from rocket engines to commercial airplanes. to implement ethical policies throughout the corpo­ration. "It's about each person addressing his own intentions," Andrews said. 
He added that all Boeing business plans must include a statement of their intentions. so that consequences and inten­tions can be compared. "There is a differ-ence between real intentions and window dress­ing," Andrews said. 
The corporate ethics center at Boeing takes an active role in dealing with and learning from ethical problems, Andrews said. His office trains more than 95 percent of Boeing's 170,000 employees and managers at all levels, and Andrews personally reports to the chairman of the board.

While Andrews spoke about the importance of ethics for all employees, especially the need for well-intentioned executives. 
"It's not a grassroots effort," Andrews said. "It starts at the top."

. Hollywood art director advises students to express their talents 
~ 
By AMANDA MISNIK News Writer 
Hollywood Art Director Peg McClellan provided advice to students providing a career in any art field at Tuesday's lec­ture titled, "Filmmaking: the Art Director's Role." 
"When you're starting out, 
you have to have a can­do atti­tude," she 
said.  "You  
have  to  
have  that  

[mobile] personality to deal with free-lance w o r k . Concentrate on what you can do instead of what you can't do." 
McClellan told the audience members not to limit them­selves and to follow their pas­sions. 
"Ms. McClellan's speech reassured me, as a possible art major, that there are plen­ty of job opportunities avail­able in today's market for an individual willing to apply themselves. I enjoyed her enthusiasm and appreciated her expertise," Adrienne Brockhaus said. 
While she always desired to have a career in the arts, she never thought she would be active on the sets of Hollywood.

Patricia McClellan 
art director 
McClellan is currently work­ing on Universal Pictures' "Seabiscuit," which stars Tobey Maguire, and finds it to be a rewarding experience. Also she works with photogra­phy classes to offer her experi­ence and knowledge. 
"I really love what I do. [In each film]. I adapt an approach to each director's style. I help to form the direc­tor's vision," said McClellan. 
McClellan worked on "Melrose Place," "Quantum Leap" and "Columbo." She also worked on six Disney 
60-second trailer commercial for Nintendo. 
The theme of the ad focused on "Lord of the Rings," and McClellan's artistic ideas had to be translated into computer images. This task showed that one project contains "so many layers, and so many job oppor­tunities." 
McClellan graduated from Michigan State University with a bachelor of fine arts degree. 
She  took  classes  at  the  
Associates  of Art  Center,

Sniper terrorizes D.C. area, citizens fearful 
Associated Press 
BOWIE, Md. 
Playgrounds and parks were empty, shoppers darted warily across parking lots and shaken parents escorted children to and from school Tuesday, a day after a youngster was wounded by the sniper roaming suburban Washington. 
"Usually I'm embarrassed to walk around and hold my mom's hand, but I don't care today," said Amanda Wiedmaier, 13, whose Benjamin Tasker Middle School was the scene of Monday's shooting of a class­mate. 
Security firms across the region reported a surge in inter­est. About 50 Starbucks stores removed their outside seats. And mental health counselors scram­bled to set up crisis hot lines for people upset by the string of shootings that have left six peo­ple dead and two wounded since last week. 
"This is a person who is shoot­ing elderly men, shooting women and now shooting little chil­dren,"Gov. Parris Glendening said. "This is the act of an absolute coward." 
The latest victim, a 13-year-old boy, remained in critical but sta­ble condition Tuesday with a wound to the chest. He was shot early Monday after he was dropped off at school. 
With few solid clues or witness 
accounts, a task force of federal. 
state and local investigators is 
sifting through more than 6,000 
phoned-in tips. Police said they 
have 1,250 credible leads but 
refused to disclose details. 
Many Tasker parents kept their children home Tuesday; attendance was down by one­third. Other parents served as volunteer guards, watching over intersections. 
Dorothy Prather. a Tasker teacher, was impressed by how well students responded to the traumatic events. "They came right in today and sat down and went right on with their work,"she said. "The only ones who seemed really concerned were the parents." 
Before classes started, Prather said, the principal addressed the students over the intercom, urg­ing them to get back to business but reminding them that coun­selors were available if needed. 
Less than a mile from Tasker, the colorful playground equip­ment at the Cresthill Baptist Church nursery school went unused. School director Stacie Hall decided to keep her 2-to 6­year-old charges indoors all day, and let the teachers choose their own gentle explanations. 
"One little girl told me, 'We can't go outside today because we might get sunburned,"'Hall said. 
Her 13-year-old daughter, Krystle, attends Tasker and was a friend of the wounded boy. 


Zuma Press Photo Prince George's County Police officials gather outside Benjamin Tasker Middle School in Bowle, Md., where a 13-year-old boy was shot and critically wounded as he was dropped off at school by his aunt Monday. Police have linked the boy's shooting to seven other sniper attacks in the area.

Police believe the sniper is picking victims at random and firing from a distance with a high-powered hunting or mili­tary-style rifle. All of the victims were cut down by a single bul­let. 



Kuwaiti terrorists attack US forces in Gulf 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

Two Kuwaiti gunmen in a pickup truck attacked U.S. forces during war games Tuesday on an island in the Persian Gulf, killing one Marine and wounding another before they were shot to death by U.S. troops. Kuwait called the assault a "terrorist act." 
The Pentagon said the assailants pulled up to a group of Marines conduct­ing urban assault training on Failaka, an uninhabited island off Kuwait's coast, and opened fire with small arms. They then drove to another site, stopped and attacked again before being killed by Marines, the Pentagon said. 
Marines later found three AK-47s and ammunition inside the vehicle, accord­ing to a statement released in Wa~hington by the Bahrain-based U.S. Fifth Fleet. It said the injured Marine was hit in the arm. 
In a brief statement, the Kuwaiti Interior Ministry condemned the attack and identified the assailants as Anas al­Kandari, born in 1981, and Jassem al­Hajiri, born in 1976. It said both were Kuwaiti civilians. 
U.S. intelligence has not determined if the attackers had any terrorist links, said an intelligence official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. 
An Interior Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, described the two men as fundamentalist Muslims. More than 30 of their friends and rela­tives were detained for questioning, he said. 
"The ministry announces that this is a terrorist act," the Interior Ministry said in a statement. "It will not allow anyone to undermine the country's security." 
Pentagon spokesman Lt. Daniel Hetlage said the Marines returned to their ships shortly after the attack, but would resume exercises on the island Wednesday. 
Failaka Island, about 10 miles east of Kuwait City, was abandoned by its inhabitants when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, and Iraqi forces heavily mined it during their occupation. 
After a U.S.-led coalition liberated Kuwait in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the government compensated islanders for their property and resettled them on the mainland. The island has since been cleared of mines and many Kuwaitis fish there on weekends. Some former resi­dents visit occasionally. 
The shooting attack was unprecedent­ed in Kuwait, a Washington ally since the Gulf War. More than a decade later, most Kuwaitis remain supportive of the close relationship. 
Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria Clarke said the two Marines were taken to the Armed Forces Hospital in Kuwait City. where one of them died of his wounds. Their names were withheld until relatives were contacted. 
The military exercise, dubbed Eager Mace 2002, involves Kuwaitis at some stages.

Farrakhan criticizes Bush Iraq policy: 
Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan suggest­ed Tuesday that the greatest threat to world peace is President Bush, not Saddam Hussein. "Is [Saddam] the greatest threat to world peace? Or is it the president of the United States?" Farrakhan asked. "It seems like there are only three nations that want to attack Iraq: Israel, Britain and the United States." 
Buffalo terror suspect released on bail: A federal judge granted bail Tuesday to only one of six men accused of being part of an al-Qaida sleeper cell. In granting $600,000 bond to Sahim Alwan, Magistrate H. Kenneth Schroeder Jr. said Alwan had "disclaimed any continued participation in the activities of al-Qaida" and had extricated himself from a training camp in Afghanistan. The judge detained the five others in fear of their possible flight. 
Tenet: Iraq may wait until provoked: 
CIA Director George Tenet told lawmakers Tuesday that Saddam Hussein might not use his weapons of mass destruction -unless provoked by fear of an imminent U.S.-led attack. Tenet's assessment, which came as both the House and the Senate debated a resolution to authorize President Bush to use force against Iraq. appeared somewhat at odds with Bush's assertion that the Iraqi leader might be planning a chemical or biological attack on U.S. interests. 
Men charged in bank guard death: 
Three men were in custody and two were charged with murder Tuesday, a day after a bank guard was fatally shot during a scuffie with would-be robbers, authorities said. Two men were charged with first­degree murder, attempted armed robbery and other charges in Monday's fatal shooting of Nathan Ley outside a Bank of America branch, police said.

New study shows abortion rate dropped significantly 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK 

The U.S. abortion rate dropped significantly during the second half of the 1990s, partic­ularly among teenagers, and experts attribute the decline to better awareness of contracep­tion and a fear of disease that has cut down on sexual activity. 
The rate fell 11 percent between 1994 and 2000, from 24 to 21 abortions for every 1,000 women of childbearing age, the nonprofit Alan Guttmacher Institute reported Tuesday. The rate among girls ages 15 to 17 declined a dra­matic 39 percent, from 24 to 15 abortions per 1,000 girls. 
At the same time, researchers were surprised by a sharp increase in abortions among poorer women, or those who earn less than twice the federal poverty level of about $17,000 for a family of four. 
"Their abortion rates were increasing while they were going down for everyone else," said Rachel K. Jones, who led the study, which was based on questionnaires completed by more than 10,000 women who had abortions. 

Sarah Brown, director of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, noted that the drop in abortions was accompa­nied by a decline in teen sex, teen pregnancies and teen births during the late 1990s. 
"This signals a deep and pro­found and robust change in adolescent sexual behavior in this country," she said. "I think it's cause for -I don't know if 'celebration' is the right word -but certainly our full atten­tion." 
Analysts have credited a broad set of factors for those trends. including fear of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases and more open discus­sion with youngsters about sex. 
"People are really aware, and we talk more about abstinence and staying away from it alto­gether," said Shannon Kilcoyne, 18, a high school senior from Greenville, S.C. Kilcoyne was not aware of the study, but said the findings about teenagers reflect concerns of sexual activ­ity among her peers. 
"It's more a fear of STDs,"she said. "feople always talk about how you have to know someone well enough to find out their past history and who they've had sex with." 
The Guttmacher institute receives some funding from Planned Parenthood, but its abortion statistics are generally regarded by both anti-abortion groups and abortion-rights sup­porters as accurate.

"The campus was really, really polarized," McCarthy said. "You could tell who was in ROTC. They had the crew cuts and everyone else had the hippie hair.

"Young people today are less likely to be interested in political events than the young people of 30 years ago," said David Campbell, assistant professor of political science. 
Yet despite the general trend toward political indifference, Ardizzone still cautioned that the campus could yet erupt into a politically tense "hotbed." 
"I would actually say you would find the same thing in the early period of the 60s," she said. "We're at a different point in the war."

Bush port request approved 
. Federal judge ends 10-day labor lockout 
Associated Press 

SAN FRANCISCO 
A federal judge approved 
President Bush's request 
Tuesday to reopen West 
Coast ports, ending a caus­
tic 10-day labor lockout 
that has cost the fragile U.S. 
economy $1 billion to $2 
billion a day. 

Three hours after Justice 
Department officials filed 
documents in a San 
Francisco federal court, 
Judge William Alsup agreed 
to impose an 80-day cool­
ing-off period in the dispute 
under the Taft-Hartley Act. 
"This dispute between 
management and labor 
cannot be allowed to fur­
ther harm the economy and 
force thousands of working 
Americans from their jobs," 
Bush said earlier Tuesday. 
Bush's politically charged decision made him the first president in a quarter-cen­tury to intervene in a labor dispute with Taft-Hartley. His speech, which was moved up 15 minutes, coin­cided with an announce­ment by the dockworkers' union agreeing to an eleventh-hour truce to return to work for 30 days under terms of the expired

This summer I worked in a jewelry store. Situated in downtown Cincinnati, the store was an upscale establishment specializing in Rolex watches. However, nobody told this to 
the customers, as our clientele seemed to consist mostly of guys named Ray­Ray who came in with their girl­friends looking for replacement gold teeth. 

I was hired  
because the  Joe Muto  
owner, when he  
wasn't glued to a  
security monitor  
with his finger  Muto Time  
resting on the  
"911" speed-dial  
button, also ran an  

online store. My job was to take mer­chandise, photograph it and put it on the Internet. Not exactly brain surgery. Actually. only a notch or two above trash collection. 
But it paid the bills, kept me out of the sun and I didn't have to come in until 11 a.m. Plus the girls who sold the jewelry were hot. Not that they'd talk to the creepy, pale computer guy who worked upstairs, but I'd take what I could get. 
So, exiled to my upstairs computer room and scared to associate with the Rolex Bunnies downstairs, I used my lunch break to engage in political dis­course on the Internet. And it just so happened that one of the best sites on the Internet for highbrow political dis­course was playboy.com. 
I should add a disclaimer here for all future and past employers stating that I do not habitually view nude women in my spare time at work. I typed "Playboy" into the browser on a whim, hoping for the indication of an impend­ing Olsen twins appearance in the 
' magazine. Finding nothing about . Mary-Kate, nor Ashley, I was about to close the window when something caught my eye: large fake breasts. Actually, it was an ad at the top of the page. It said "Become a Playboy Campus Representative!" Underneath the text, a grinning Aryan frat-boy type had his arms around two gor­geous blondes wearing tiny cut-off black tees with the bunny logo. And underneath the tees? You guessed it: large fake breasts. rm going to digress here and talk about a subject that's close to the hearts of men and directly in front of the hearts of women. I'm one of the roughly five or six men in the world who don't like fake breasts. Sure, they fill a blouse quite aptly. They allow women to defy gravity well into their 80s. I'll admit that every time I talk to my friend here on campus who continues to deny her highly obvious reception of a breast enlargement last year, I can't stop my mouth from watering a little. But fake breasts are bad, because as any connoisseur of fine video pornog­raphy will tell you, they just don't move right. Porn breasts usually remind me of two sweaty, skin-covered tetherballs trying to escape the hot set lights. Despite my disapproval of silicon enhancement, I found the prospect of being Notre Dame's representative for Playboy Magazine very attractive. So, my head filled with visions of invita­tions to the Mansion, I tackled the rep­resentative application. It was remark­ably wordy and full of surreal juxtapo­sitions. One question demanded an essay on freedom of speech, while the next page queried, "How would you describe the way you dress?" I ended up doing the lengthy application at home. It took me 45 minutes. I could already taste the champagne that I'd be licking off bare Playmates. 
My initiation packet came last week. I am now the Official Playboy Magazine Representative to Notre Dame. I'm thinking of getting business cards made up. 
So what are my duties as a campus representative? Well, the first thing they sent me was a packet of promo­tional flyers I'm supposed to hand out. The grand prize in the contest they advertise is a rock climbing. kayaking and mountain biking trip with two members of the "Playboy Playmate X­Treme Team." 
I received the flyers and immediately had a little mental debate with myself. I couldn't decide what was more pathetic -me handing these out by the entrance to DeBartolo Hall or par­ents proudly telling their friends that they have a daughter on the Playmate X-Treme Team. I entered the contest five times. 
The agreement that I signed specifi­cally told me that it's not my job to find models. Someone got the crazy notion that propositioning women to pose constitutes sexual harassment. I am, however, allowed to accept pictures. So, anyone with a tasteful nude selec­tion of pictures can give them to me. Theoretically, I will pass them on to Playboy Magazine. 
So, my main goal at this point is to parlay my rep-hood into a job with Playboy. I'm a writer, and I hear that Playboy has articles, although oddly enough I've never noticed them. 

Joe Muto is a junior FIT and English double major who will be the emcee at the pep rally on Friday. He invites any women with large fake breasts who disagree with him to argue about it over dinner. His column appears every other Wednesday. Contact him at jmuto@nd.edu.

Moose Krause embodied Notre Dame spirit 
Who is that big guy with the politically incorrect cigar on the bench outside the Joyce Center? Moose Krause. All­American, coach, athletic director and truly "Mr. Notre Dame." 
That is the title of Jason Kelly's excellent new book. If you have a Domer in your fami­ly. this takes care of one item on your Christmas list. Or you can find a miniature replica of Moose and the bench at the bookstore for only $1,500 (no kidding). Moose could not have afforded it on his salary, which never exceeded $30,000. He turned down job offers many times higher because he would not leave Notre Dame. 
Edward Walter Krauciunas was born in 1913 into a "cash-poor but spirit-rich" family in Chicago's Back of the Yards. His high school coach, Norm Barry, a team­mate ofGeorge Gipp, gave him the name "Moose" and shortened Krauciunas to Krause. Krause entered Notre Dame in 1930, Rockne's last yea.r of coaching, and was an All-American in football and bas­ketball. He joined Frank Leahy's football staff in 1942 and was also head basket-ball coach. 


In World War II, Moose was a Marine Corps intelligence officer with an aviation unit in the Solomon Islands. He routinely did his own reconnaissance, squeezing into the nose turret of a B-25 with no parachute. 
One night, a Moro scout, Antoun, led Krause and the chaplain, Father James Gannon, to Rabaul to recover the remains of six Marines. They escaped capture because Antoun hid them in a leper colony that the Japanese feared to enter. Krause later collected over $2,000 from the Marines to finance Antoun's studies for the priesthood. Moose carried Notre Dame to the Solomons. 
At a tense briefing before an important raid, he brought in 20 Moro scouts. The Marines expected the usual message, that if they got lost the Moros would bring them back safely. This time Moose turned to the young Moros and they broke into the Notre Dame Victory March in their native language. "The ... 200 men went berserk," Gannon says, "laughing and cheering and whistling." The raid was successful with not a man lost. 
During 1946-49, Krause was Leahy's assistant and head basketball coach. He served as athletic director from 1951 until his retirement in 1982. He built a program to serve all the students, emphasizing intramural and club sports. 
In January 1967, Moose's wife Elise suffered severe brain and other injuries when a car broadsided the taxi in which 
she was riding. She lost her rationality 
and control of her emotions. Moose 
Krause devoted himself utterly to the 
care of Elise until her death in 1990. He 
turned to alcohol but changed his life 
after a heart attack and pleas from his 
children. He became a leader in 
Alcoholics Anonymous. 
Jason Kelly concludes that Krause's greatest achievement occurred at Cardinal Nursing Home, where he spoon fed meals and sang to his ailing wife. Although he described it as "a veritable crucifixion for both of us," there was no self-pity in Moose. 
"There's really no place I'd rather be than in that room with your mother," Krause said. "I know a lot of people feel sorry for me, but I'm the lucky one. I'm in the fortunate position of being able to extend care. That's the easy part. Mother has the hard part." 
"I call him Saint Edward," said Ara Parseghian. "[I]f every person had that kind of compassion and ... respect for his spouse, this would be a ... lot better world." 
Father Theodore Hesburgh concurred, describing Moose as, "Absolutely the Rock of Gibraltar, the soul of integrity. If I ever met a saint, he was one ofthem." 
Moose's son, Father Edward Krause, who teaches theology at Gannon University, calls Mr. Notre Dame the story of a whole generation who took God, the 10 Commandments and their faith seri­ously. Moose, as Father Krause put it, had a special affection for John Paul II as fell ow athlete and successor to Peter. In his funeral homily in 1992, Krause quot­ed his father: "Unless my eyes are getting bad, the Bible doesn't say, 'Thou art Peter, and upon this teenie weenie peb­ble, I will found my debating society. [It doesn't say] take up a Gallup poll, and tell 'em what they want to hear."' Moose Krause knew what he believed and why. 
College sports are now a major busi­ness, driven by money, media and gov­ernment regulation. Moose and his assis­tant, Colonel Jack Stephens, ran the show in a different and, in various ways. a bet­ter era. The common wisdom has it that it took 23 people to replace Moose. The athletic department has new faces and new skills. But the important things have not changed, like character and commit­ment. Moose would be pleased. 
Notre Dame will never see the likes of Moose Krause again. So buy the book. You can sit on the bench and read it with Moose. You will learn something about the real Notre Dame. And about yourself.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Ticket prices and procedures should be fair for all 
When I was young, and if I remember, we paid about $2 to attend the football games. We had perfect se~ts. right under the press box on the 50-yard line. To attend the home basketball games, all we had to do to get into the old gym was to wear our habit -the "price of admission" was free. 
The price oftickets has gone up. And I personally think, at this time, the tickets are not only priced obscenely, but prohibitive for the same Religious 
of Holy Cross who, by historical facts, helped build this University almost single-handed­ly. But do we get any gratitude? Do we get any breaks? My answer is no. It costs me $116 to attend a single foot­ball game. I have to pay the regular price of $43 for two people, one to push my wheelchair in and one for me as a spectator, then I have to pay another $20 for a "special" parking space which is about three blocks away from the stadium. I might as well have the other brother push me across 933. 
One of the reasons I am writing this letter is because of a quote I read in Scholastic on Sept. 12 in the section called "Listening In." I quote from a pro­fessor of history commenting on the infla­tion ofstudent football prices. He said, "What do I care? I get my tickets for free." 
The Brothers of the Holy Cross don't get free tickets. I guess this professor probably makes about $80,000 a year to teach here, and I also guess that he is one of those scalpers on Angela Boulevard and 933 selling his free tickets. What a deal. I.have given 56 years to this community and I have to pay $116 to get into this very expensive Stadium for a single game. 
You figure it out. This amounts to $696 to see six foot­ball games, which I couldn't pay, even if I wanted too. I am poor, not rich like the University or its personnel. 
I realize that Notre Dame is a very wealthy University, for I get the donation letters all the time. I graduated in 1950, and this must go with the territory. No, the broth­ers of Holy Cross don't get any breaks. I do not forcer­tain, but I will bet that the Holy Cross priests either get their tickets for free or they do not have to pay the full price. 
A couple years ago, I asked University President Father Edward Malloy ifI could sit in the press box. He wrote me back to say, "No, we have spaces for wheel­
chairs down on the field for the disabled." This was 
before millions were spent on the Stadium. But I still had to pay the going rate just to sit on the field -the going rate at that time. I was not about to spend four hours looking at ankles -especially when they were 100 yards away, during half of the game. 
Now I know recently our Superior General, Father Hugh Cleary and one of his assistants were seated in the press box. vVhere they given free tick­ets? Why should the priests and lay people get all the perks? I was talking 
with a former employee of the University this morning and he told me, "You would be surprised how many free tickets were given out to many parties to the football games. Why, even the players get free tickets," he said. "You should see how plush the private box for Father Hesburgh is. I was invited to watch the game from that box one time. And how stocked it is with drinks and free food." "Well," I told my friend, "he was the former president, and he deserves some perks." Get my point? 
I had to get this off my chest, for at my age, as one who will probably never see another Notre Dame football game in person, I am broke from paying all that money at all those other football and basketball games for the past 50 years.

Questioning 
womens' 
equality at ND 
I am writing in response to Joanna Mikulski's Oct. 8 
column. She's right. The rules for guys and the rules 
for girls are totally different at Notre Dame. However, 
why does she want to ruin the fun for everyone? Why 
does she want more security at guys' dorms? Guys 
don't want or need more security from what I've heard 
from my friends. And, as a frequent visitor ofguys' 
dorms, I don't think they need to be more secure 
either. 

Instead, why don't they dial down the tone of the security guards for girls' dorms? Maybe Mikulski doesn't have that problem in her dorm, but I think most girls do. I mean, my boyfriend practically breaks out in hives whenever he comes over to my dorm when the security guard is on duty. Feeling paranoid around the opposite sex is not a good step toward good gender relations. 
The other comment that bothered me is the one about football receiving the most money and attention than any other sport. I think Mikulski has forgotten where she goes to school. Of course footbaQ is our showcase sport. I think Mikulski must spend her game days knocked unconscious because that would be the only way to ignore what goes on at Notre Dame because of a simple football game. She must not have heard about Knute Rockne or the Four Horsemen either. Also, could it be that football receives the most money because it makes more money that any other 
\ 
sport. male or female? Yep, that could be it. 
Mikulski is not the first to realize the gender issues on campus. We all know things are weird. However, don't ruin the fun for the guys. Yes, our rules are stricter, but why make the guys' rules like ours? Why don't we try to make our rules like the guys'? And don't try to downplay the importance of Notre Dame football. That's just dumb. Solutions are needed, but not ~ers.

HBO relates 'Sex 
In a place without sex and without city, 


l I 
By KATE NAGENGAST

f 
i 
I The topics Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda discuss on HBO's hit show "Sex and the City" are not typi­cal dining hall fodder. These independ­ent women celebrate, question and fix­ate upon their sexuality almost con­stantly, a practice easier done in a New York nightclub than said at a Catholic university. But despite the culture gap created by Notre Dame and Saint Mary's lack of both sex and city, the show's witty writing and situational comedy makes the characters, their exploits and

especially their friendships, accessible and enjoyable even for viewers in South Bend. 
The show began five seasons ago on a fairly innocent premise: four 30-some­thing, single women living and loving in the Big Apple. Carrie Bradshaw, a news­paper sex columnist played by Sarah Jessica Parker, narrates "Sex." Her character is based on the actual New York Observer columns of the popular journalist Candace Bushnell (who visited Notre Dame during last spring's Sophomore Literary Festival). 
Within the first five minutes of most of the 30-minute, commercial free 
episodes, Carrie composes a question 
across the screen of her laptop in a 
practice slightly reminiscent of Doogie 
Howser, M.D.'s nightly diary. Typically 
inspired by a problem she or one of her 
three best friends is experiencing, the 
question leads her weekly column and 
frames that episode's content. 
Carrie's three best friends comprise 
the rest of "Sex's" core female cast. 
Samantha Jones, played by Kim 
Cattrall, is a seductive, and often lewd 
public relations executive whose bed­
room habits could have inspired Hall 
and Oates, "Man-eater." Charlotte York, 
played by Kristin Davis, is an idealis­
independent, if 
prominent New York 
law firm who refuses 
to let a man play a 
significant part in 
her life. 
In fact many of 
the show's male 
characters 
come and go with little emo­tion al attach­
~u~~:nc~~ rTh~hu~h the fourth season brought a series of more stable y-chromo­somes than its prede­cessors: a fiance for Carrie, a steady beau for Samantha, an .ex­h usban d Charlotte and newborn son and his father for Miranda; even they were flat charac­ters that often fell into the shadows of the women's many dimensions. Make no mis­take, HBO has not packaged soft­core pornography in expensive New York fash­ions and called it a series. Rather the cable station set a new standard for social acceptability by allowing women to candidly dis­cuss sex. These are notjust any women: They are four suc­cessful, eloquent a n d attractive women 
who are as ambitious in their sexual exploits as they are their professions. Though their language and topics are often uncouth, it's hardly a show you'd watch with your family after Sunday dinner; it's indisputable that they raise issues many women have long-pondered and probably wanted to discuss, but lacked the venue to do so. Thanks to "Sex" women can talk about their femi­ninity and passions without feeling licentious. They merely ask, "Did you see what Carrie was wearing last night?" and wait for the conversation to 
turn to the true top­

For example, Samantha hires a response to the tunnel vision of a previ­

ship, they struggle constantly with the seeming impossibility of that occurring while they juggle the rest of their obligations. The fifth season shifts some as it introduces the serious possibility for choosing commitment over quick flings, but one thing remains the same: The show is real. The men they date look like real men, not under-we a r

are real women's con­cerns. The most unreason­able facet of the show is their wardrobe, and the 
clothes provide entertain­ment in their own right. 
The contrasting opinions, sexual practices and social habits of Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda are the thrust of the series. "Sex" has coined terms such trendy terms as man­thrax, a man who invades your life, but is terrible for you; f---buddy, someone 
you barely know, but keep around for conjugal visits; and frenemies. women who cannot be trusted, but often play nice to get what they want. The women wax eloquent on life, love and lan­guish in a city that might not sleep, but certainly sleeps 
around. 

In its fifth season the show's characters have matured and its subject matter has changed to fit a changed New York. The post­Sept. 11 city has a differ­ent feel for natives, an ambiance 
"Sex" was 
AFIPhoto wise not 
to ignore. Without being cheesy, in a way a show on which the characters focus primarily on orgasms never could, "Sex" paid tribute to the culture of a city damaged, but invincible by making its characters behave in much the same way. They may go down, but they always bounce back. 
Although sex is admittedly the focus of most of their dialogue, the show's senti­ment is truly friendly. The four main characters are inseparable and loyal friends who support each other through not only male-related traumas, but other emotional, economic and physical crises as well. In fact, the prevalence of

sex in the women's conversations and behaviors has a numbing effect on view­ers, but in a positive way. After a few half-hour episodes, the nudity and cru­dity fades into the background. What true "Sex" addicts come to appreciate is the relationships among the women themselves. Their urban family is not unlike close roommates or lifelong friendships and this is where college viewers' ability to identify with the "Sex" women lies.

There's a new No. 1 in the Sendwich Index, and they aren't from the Sunshine State. 
Despite a less than impressive 27 -16 vic­tory over No. 7 4 Northwest-ern, Ohio State tops the charts this week. 
With quality victories 
by former Buckeye vic­tims No. 26 Texas Tech and No. 7 Washing-ton State, Ohio State got a major boost to their strength of schedule, propelling them up three spots to the top of the charts. They previously 


defeated Texas Tech  Eric Chanowich  
by 24 and Washington  
State by 18.  
The Buckeyes hold a lead of only 0.17476  Sports Columnist  
Sendwich points over  
last  week's  No.  1  
Miami.  

The Hurricanes took a hit when their only prior top-notch opponent, Florida, fell to Mississippi. 
Don't expect Ohio State to stay on top long though. as they face both No. 13 Penn State and No. 11 Wisconsin in the next three weeks and Miami will likely get a major boost with a victory over No. 3 Florida State next weekend. 
Take Ty's Advice 
When asked about important upcoming games, Notre Dame head coach Tyrone Willingham consistently answers with a nonchalant dismissal that his team is tak­ing its schedule one game at a time. 
Perhaps Texas and Oklahoma should have followed Willingham's lead this weekend, as they both narrowly escaped meager opponents while looking ahead to their face-off next week. 
Without a two-point conversion stop and a late interception, the Longhorns' nation­al championship hopes could have been damaged, if not dashed, by No. 77 Oklahoma State. 
With the close call, Texas slid 5 spots to No. 16. 
Oklahoma had to pull out all of the stops to defeat No. 70 Missouri. The Sooners scored the go-ahead touchdown on a fake field goal with 6 minutes. 33 seconds remaining. 
After the near-upset, Oklahoma fell five spots to No. 10. 
With the caste system that is the A.P. and Coaches' polls, the Longhorns and Sooners share No. 2 and 3 national rank-

Thanks, but we'll pass on the Red River Shootout to catch Miami versus Florida State. 
Rebels Overthrow Gators 
Despite a prolific college career, former Tennessee quarter­back Peyton Manning was never able to accomplish what his little brother Eli did on Saturday; the younger Manning defeated Florida. 
It took Matt Grier's interception returned for the winning touch­down to propel Manning and 
Mississippi to a 17 -14 victory over former No. 10 Florida. 
With the win, the Rebels moved up from No. 45 to No. 29. Florida dropped 12 spots to No. 22. 
The fans in Florida may be one step closer to a verdict on rookie head coach Ron Zook. Despite a recent win against rival Tennessee, the Gator nation is up in arms after Florida's faster two-loss season since 1993. Check out www.fireronzook.com to see just how they feel. 
Wrecking Crew Gets Wrecked 
Texas A&M's Wrecking Crew defense came into this weekend ranked third nationally in yards allowed, but this meant nothing to No. 26 Texas Tech and Kliff Kingsburry. In a 48-47 overtime victory, Kingsburry completed 49 of 59 passes for 4 7 4 yards and five touchdowns to lead the Red Raiders to victory over former No. 27 TexasA&M. 
The Aggies led for most of the game, but gave up a field goal as regulation expired that tied the game at 41. A&M struck first in overtime but missed the point after attempt, allowing for Kingsburry to toss another touchdown and Texas Tech to dramatically win on a successful point after. 
With its only losses to No. 1 Ohio State and No. 14 N.C. State, Texas Tech may be the best team you haven't head much about, and Kliff Kingsburry may be the best player you haven't heard much about -yet.

Lions, Pyros enter playoffs with wins 
By PAT LEONARD and LISA 
REIJUlA 
Sports Wrirers 

Lyons coach Andy Kowieski remained on the sideline for the end ofthis game. 
Coming off a 7 -6 loss to Lewis Sunday in which referees ejected Kowieski for arguing, the Lions needed their coaches and players to buckle down and keep their heads to defeat the Pangborn Phoxes. Tuesday night at Riehle fields, the Lions trampled the Phoxes 20-0 to end the regular season with a 3-2-1, good enough to secure a spot in the playoffs. 
The game was never in doubt. 

"I'm proud of the team tonight," Kowieski said. "We rebounded well from a tough loss -a game we should have won." 
Lyons quarterback Sara Jenkins threw for 140 yards and two touchdowns against a scram­bling Pangborn defense. The first Lyons touchdown came on a 5­yard draw. In the second half, a 15-yard pass interference call ignited a second touchdown drive for the Lions. 
Pangborn managed only 40 yards rushing and 25 yards pass­ing in the contest. The Lyons picked off the Phoxes once and penetrated into the backfield all

once, her performance against 
Pangborn was a huge step for­

game against Lewis. . i I 
!
"We dropped some balls last ! game and had a tough time on offense," Jenkins said. "We need­ed to win this one and the team really stepped up." 
Pasquerilla East 13, McGlinn 0 
Pasquerilla East continued its 
winning ways Tuesday night in women's interhall play, beating McGlinn 13-0. 
The Pyros have not lost since their season opener against the Chaos of Cavanaugh and will cruise into the playoffs with a 5-1 record. 
Quarterback Abbey Coons again led her team to victory by throwing for a touchdown and running for another. Lindsay Terifay made a diving catch in the end zone to put the Pyros up 
in the first half. The extra point conversion was snuffed by the McGlinn defense. 
In the second half Coons ran in a score from the 3-yard line. The try for the extra point was good, as Coons connected in the end zone with freshman wide receiv­er Christin O'Brien. The Pyros dominated offensively and held possession for the majority of the 
game. Passing was the mainstay 
of the offense, as Coons was 14 
of 22 with one interception. 
Despite the loss, the Shamrocks most likely earned themselves a playoff spot. Their chances depended on a Lyons victory over Pangborn, and the Lions delivered with a 20-0 win. McGlinn came through the regu­lar season with a record of 3-3, and freshman lineman Jessica Fedor said her team is excited about making the playoffs. 
"We have improved so much since our first game," she said. 
However, the Shamrocks still have plenty of room for improve­ment. 
"We had a couple of break­downs on defense against PE, so we need to work on covering long passes," said Fedor. "It was good that we held them to only two touchdowns." 
Coons said her team will take a vacation from practice and then start preparing for the playoffs after fall break.

Coaches still hush-hush about status of Holiday's injury 

By ANDREW SOUKUP 
Spons Writer 

So goes the story with Carlyle Holiday and his oft-discussed shoulder. According to Irish coaches, Holiday has improved from last week, but they're not saying whether Holiday will play Saturday against Pittsburgh. 
When asked if he would wait until game time to make a deci­sion, as the Irish did last week, Willingham responded, "It could be, and it could come before that." 
Holiday's backup, Pat Dillingham, has already launched himself into another round of game week mental preparations, where he practices with the intent of being the starter. The preparation paid off last week, as Dillingham finished 14-of-27 with 129 passing yards. While his start won't rank among the great Notre Dame debuts -Dillingham had trouble throwing the deep pass and never tossed a touch­down -it gave the sophomore enough confidence that he can play when he gets into the game. 
"You can't simulate a game that much in practice," he said. "The only way to get those under your belt is to be out there. I got 60-70 snaps on Saturday. and that helped a lot." 
Dillingham said Holiday, who was not available for interviews after practice, is looking increas­ingly better in practice and added that the two split reps Tuesday about evenly. And from Notre Dame's perspective, the best aspect of having Dillingham working as the starter is he's under no illusion, at least pub­licly, that can wrestle the starting job away from Holiday. 
"Its Carlyle's team," Dillingham said Tuesday after practice. "He's started all last year and every­thing. I'm just going to do my job, if my job is backing him up, then that's what I'll do." 
If nothing else, Dillingham's selfless attitude helps create posi­tive team chemistry and earned him praise from his head coach. 
"At the quarterback position, if you can have two young men that are really focused on the team first, then you have a chance to have a very successful organiza­tion," Willingham said. "Quarterbacks, by the nature of their position, are natural lead­ers, and a team follows their sprit and the mindset. When you have Pat Dillingham following that approach, it really makes your team a lot stronger." 
Panther fear 

Nothing scared the Irish more than watching Pittsburgh disman­tle Syracuse 48-24 last week in the Carrier Dome. No. 8 Notre Dame isn't taking the 5-1 Panthers lightly, especially con­sidering their only loss of the sea­son was a narrow defeat at the hands of Texas A&M. 
"You need to start with what they are doing well, which is their defense," Willingham said. "It is an aggressive, get-after-it group that has a lot of confidence. They are really limiting what they can do offensively." 
Pittsburgh boasts the No. 8 defense in the country in number of yards allowed. Notre Dame's defense is just ahead of them, ranked No. 7. 
But Pittsburgh is far from an entirely defensive-minded unit. Quarterback Rod Rutherford, who has a phenomenal quarter­back rating of 149.2, directs a potent offense that features a trio of talented wide receivers in Larry Fitzgerald, Roosevelt Bynes and Lamar Slade, who are each averaging at least 13 yards per catch. 
"They've won four in a row, and beat a very good football team in Syracuse last week," defensive coordinator Kent Baer said. " ... Anytime you go into the Dome and beat them like that, it raises a flag in a hurry. We're going to have our hands full Saturday."

Setta keeps on kicking despite recent struggles 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Sports Writer 
Put slump and Setta in the same sentence and Tyrone Willingham snaps. 
"I haven't seen a kicker that's been in a slump," Notre Dame's head coach said Tuesday. "The one we have is not in a slump. He's missed a couple of field goals." 
That's putting it mildly. Since Nicholas Setta began the year with a 5-for-6 field goal kicking performance against Maryland, the normally dependable Irish kicker has struggled. He's made just three See Also of his last 10 field goal attempts and sunk to a new low against "Coaches still

misses this season are as many as he had in 2000 and 2001 combined. 
"It's unfortunate the way things are going," Setta said. "The biggest thing for me is you're not helping your team out any. Games could have come down to those field goals and you want to be there.... You want the whole package." 
The Irish kicker isn't quite sure what the source of his recent problems is. The only thing he has noticed when he watched film of his errant kicks is that he started lifting his head up earlier to watch the ball's flight. But whether the fact that he's raisjng his head after a kick is the reason he's dropping his head after the ball sails wide, he's not quite sure. 
But what Setta doesn't have to worry about is losing the support of his head coach. 
"I don't believe in kicking slumps, that's a per­sonal thing," Willingham said. "Sometimes you can notice certain things, but usually the young men themselves, because they are so well taught in their fundamental skills, will notice some things during films that may be off. But there is always the possibility that they just missed it." 
If Willingham is losing faith in his kicker, even privately, he's not showing it by the frequency he

WOMENS SOCCER 
Irish continue on string of bad luck in 3-1 loss to Purdue

Soccer can be a very frus­trating sport. Sometimes one team can take three times as many shots as the other team, yet still end up on the wrong side of the outcome. 
Tuesday night, the Notre Dame womens soccer team outplayed Purdue for almost the entire game, but still lost 3-1. The Irish outshot the Boilermakers 15 to four. but three of Purdue's shots found the back of the net, propelling them to victory. 
span of six days, the Irish were hoping that a win against No. 20 Purdue would help erase some of the bad memo­ries from Sunday's tough 3-0 road loss to ninth-rankedWest Virginia. Unfortunately, the first half against Purdue was all too familiar for a Notre Dame team that has struggled recently. 
In the 25th minute, Purdue defender Chrissy Creamer took a shot from 10 yards beyond the goalie box that curled over the outstretched arms of Irish goalkeeper Erika Bohn to give the Boilermakers a 1-0 lead. 
Less than two minutes later., 
another goal when Purdue's Annette Kent sent a shot past Bohn on a golden one-on-one opportunity. 
With just under four minutes left in the first half, the Boilermakers struck a third time. This time forward Jennie Moppert streaked past the Irish defense to a loose ball on the right sideline. Teammate Jessica Baumhoff took Moppert's pass and promptly shot the ball to the right corner of the net. 
Fifteen minutes into the sec­ond half, the Irish offense finally broke through when forward Amy Warner slipped 
sent a cross to Katie Thorlakson. Purdue goalie Jacelyn Cavalier deflected Thorlakson's shot, but Irish forward Amanda Guertin quickly pounced on the rebound for her fifth goal of the season. 
Midfielder and senior cap tain Ashley Dryer could only play five minutes of the game due to an ankle injury that has kept her out of action the past few weeks. The Irish were also without starting forward Melissa Tancredi, who served a one-game suspension for receiving her fifth yellow card Sunday and defender Gudrun returned to action last week­end from a stress fracture but went down with another injury with 17 minutes left in the contest. It is unlikely that she will play this Sunday against Connecticut. 
With the loss, Notre Dame's record dropped to 7-6 on the season. While the Irish have already been eliminated from the Big East post-season tour­nament, they still could receive an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament provided they perform well in their last five games.
