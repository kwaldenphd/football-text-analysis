Micinski received through Crimestoppers led to a two-year prison sentence for Micinski's arrest in August i98~: 
One of the most heated debates concerned the proposed amend­ment on the death penalty which read,"When a victim's right to life is violated by an individual, who is then found guilty of that crime in a court of law, the individual forfeits his right to life for the safety of the community and the attainment of justice." 
Those who supported the amend­ment pointed out it costs taxpayers $22,000 to support a man in prison for one year. The delegates opposing the amendment argued those who favor the death penalty are no better than the person who committed the crime and only God should decide whether a person should live or die. Lyons freshman Patricia Warth said Notre Dame should "follow the ex­ample of our Pope who is able to forgive the attempt on his own life." The delegates supported this and voted to defeat the amendment on the death penalty. 
The second ~ebate of the t;vening centered 01,1 ail amen<Jfllent ,which 
Several of the amendment's op­ponents contended that a Constitu­tional amendment would not stop abortion, but would only force people to obtain illegal abortions in unsanitary conditions. These op­ponents recommended government agencies be established to en­courage women to carry their preg­nancies to full term. Although the delegates voted that abortions should be allowed in the case ofrape or incest, the amendment was defeated because the delegates did not agree the Constitution should be amended to outlaw abortion except in the case ofrape or incest. 
An amendment affirming the Equal Rights Amendment easily passed after supporters argued that sex discrimination is commonplace in our society and women must no longer be viewed as second-class citizens. 
The fourth proposed amendment suggested "a sweeping tax reform which would establish a flat-rate ta.." .of 10 percent for air people." Adv-
An amendment supporting military aid to Central American countries threatened by a Com­munist takeover sparked a great deal ofcontroversy among the delegates. Supporters of the amendment stressed the importance of keeping democratic governments in Central American countries. Opponents suggested that by supporting ter­rorist governments, the amendment took a stand against human rights. The delegates defeated the amend­
ment. 
The last four amendments to the platform were voted on without debate. Delegates passed an amend­ment proposing the Salt II treaty be re-sent to the U.S. Senate for ratifica­tion. A proposal to set a national drinking age of 21 was resoundingly defeated. The delegates voted to support an amendment opposing prayer in public schools. And an amendment encouraging the use of fission nuclear reactors to decrease American dependence on foreign oil was defeated by the delegates.

Great John Cavanaugh: A man worth remembering 
Back when there was no Hesburgh, the name Cavanaugh meant the same thing. 
As the ninth president ofNotre Dame, FatherJohn W. Cavanaugh walked across his campus as if he owned it. He was, say some Notre Dame historians, the most im­pressive leader of the University since Father Edward 
Sorin: firm, striking, innovative, and bold. 
Cavanaugh's tenure from I90S to 1919 is exceeded· 
only by Sorin and Hesburgh, and during that time, 
Cavanaugh gave Notre Dame a facclift from a tight little 
prep school to an impressive national university. He 
was a tall man, with charm and courage, whose large 
handshake would crush those who greeted him. 
Cavanaugh -like Hesburgh -was inclined to be dictatorial, something of a one-man show, but he got things done. Academically, he made Notre Dame re­spcctablc; it would be left to Hesburgh to make it pres­tigious. In 1908, the undergraduate and graduate enrollment passed 1,000, and a rapid flux of faculty members followed.

was hired three years later, and a tradition was born. 
In 1919, Cavanaugh was forced to retire his position, 
which at that time also included duties as Local Supe­
rior. The new Code of Canon Law decreed that super­
iors could lierve no more than six years. (Consequently, 
the presidents between Cavanaugh and Hesburgh have 
served abbreviated terms, including Hesburgh's im­

Cavanaugh also established a program in mining and chemical engineering, a move that insured Notre Dame's commitment to science and engineering as well as the arts. It was, however, the arts where Cavanaugh excelled. Those who knew him say he was the best writer and best speaker ever to walk along the south bend of the St. Joseph River. 
It was this charisma that probably aided Cavanaugh in his mission to lift Notre Dame to national prominence. In his first sermon as president, Cavanaugh said the Uni­versity would always be committed to educating young Catholic men superbly, despite the size of the endow­ment. But perhaps the move that had the most surpris­ing effect on the University was Cavanaugh's appointment of an Irishman named McGiew as "part­heroic statue ofSorin was erected on the Main Quad at a cost of $2';,000 -an enormous sum for the early I 900s.

Another change made by the registrar's office is increasing the cost of each transcript from $1 to $2

The reason the first transcript is no longer free is mainly because of the bookkeeping involved. Said Winicur,"lt's too difficult to keep track if it is their tlrst request. Frank­ly, I didn't think the $.2 would matter that much, especially since they are a.o;king for so many." 
Those affected by the increase are mostly seniors, alumni, and under­graduates who are required to provide transcripts to student loan agencies and Reserve Officer Train­ing Corp. 
Obtaining a transcript can still be: done by completing the correct form in the registrar's office. The transcript will then be mailed within one and a half to seven days. 
During the peak period in january, it may take seven days for the registrar to mail the transcript. According to Winicur, "that's one of the reasons we asked for the in­crease -to hire additional staff to hdp us process transcript requests in really busy periods."

Space Shuttle Challenger prepares to begin new space flight today; on mission to fix broken satellite 
Associated Press 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) NASA began the countdown Wed­nesday for the I Ith shuttle flight, and officials said a storm that forced five astronauts to scrub jet training exercises did not appear to threaten Friday's launch of Challenger on a satellite-repair mission. 
The crew remained in their quar­ters studying the complex flight plan that will send a free-flying astronaut to capture a wobbly, slightly spin­ning payload 305 miles up in space. 
Meanwhile. India's first spaceman and two Soviet colleagues success­fully docked a Soyuz spacecraft with the orbiting Salyut 7 space station, already occupied by three cos­monauts. 
When Challenger soars into orbit, there will be II men in space, break­ing the record of eight set in February when five Americans and three Soviets were aloft at the same time. 
A thunderstorm with winds, rain and lightning pelted the launch area shortly before the countdown began at 3 a.m. Wednesday, and rain con· tinucd most of the day, with more than 2 inches recorded. 
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said. the weather had no impact on the count because the early hours primarily in­volve remote systems checks per­formed at the control center three miles from the launch pad. 

Commanding the flight is space veteran Robert Crippen, who will become the first person to fly three 'huttle missions. The other crew­men, all space rookies, arc pilot Dick 
Scobee  and  msswn  specialists  
George Nelson. James  van  Hoftcn  
and Terry Hart.  

Challenger is to return to Earth next Thursday after six days in orbit, landing at.Cape Canaveral. 
Notre Dame civil defense system includes list of campus shelters 
By MIKE KRISKO 
StaffReporter 
There is much talk today about the possibility of nuclear war, and the subject has many worried. Yet most people at Notre Dame, ifasked, would have little idea what woul~ happen here in the event of a nuclear catastrophe. 
Director of Security Glenn Terry said he knows there is a University plan in which Notre Dame works along with the county civil defense program. "We have a working agree­ment with the county," Terry said. Terry believed the plan would be similar to a tornado warning as described in Du Lac or the phone book. 
The St. Joseph County Director of Civil Defense, Don German, ex­plained that since the role of civil defense is to help others in time of need, the public doesn't think about it until a particular situation arises. "People don't realize there's been lots of planning done without their knowing it. Until the time comes, we don't ask for help or talk shop. Ifyou start talking about the atomic bomb, you send the public into a tither. They don't want to listen to some· thing bad. 
"Notre Dame is included in our county-wide evil defense plan. Depending on the details ofa hypot­hetical fallout situation, we would probably move everyone into shel­ters. Ifwe opted to do this, the civil

defense office would radio ND security telling them what to do," said German. 
Notre Dame has the capacity to house 43,570 people in their fallout shelters, German said. The civil defense office lists the campus shel­ters as including the dining halls, the library, the infirmary, the Rockne Memorial, the ACC, the Snite Museum, Breen·Phillips, Cavanaugh, Dillon, Farley, Fisher, Flanner, Grace, Howard, Keenan, Lewis, Mor· rissey, Pangborn, Stanford, and Zahm Halls, as well as the Math­Computer, Law, Art, Architecture, Engineering and Biology buildings. 
Food was stored in shelters using federal government money aut· horized by the 1950 Civil Defense Act. As the program stands today, however, food would have to be brought into the shelters from local stores and government warehouses. 
Many people have no idea as to what they would do ifthey knew the area soon would be under seige. Senior Frank Creed resolved to "dig the deepest hole l could and pray like hell." Flanner Freshman Don Urgo. said "I had never thought about what I would do. I'd probably just sit right here and watch the fireworks." Sophomore Geoff Westrich said ''I'd just take a lawn chair, a six pack ofcold brew. and an umbrella and just watch everyone go nuts." 
According to the public affairs of­ficer at the Defense Nuclear Agency in Washington D.C., Lt. Col. William KellarJr., "The situation may or may not be bleak. Based on any hypot­hetical attack, the amount ofdamage done would depend on three things --the type of detonation, the size yield ofthe weapon, and the climatic conditions." 
If Chicago or St. Louis were to receive a direct hit, the fallout might affect the South Bend area, depend· ing on the three forementioned fac· tors.

School prayer issue debated; moment of silence opposed 

Associated Press 
BLOOMINGTON. Ind. -School prayl'f advocates and foes agreed yeMcrday that they werr against allowing a period of silent prayer in clas~rooms hcc:ause it st·t a had pnTnknt. 
In a dchatc sponson·d hy the In· diana llniversity !Inion Board, area religious kader~ anlllnlliana llnivt:r· sity proti:!>!>ors said an officially spon~ort·d "nwmcnt of silenct·" during the .~chool day would dcfcat both lhdr purposes.

But Frank Simmons, st·crc:tary· trcasurc:r of thc Moral Majority of Kc:ntut·ky, saill hc is Vt'f}' much opposcll to the: momcnt ofsih:ncc. 
"Tht· right of silence: is a shallow right. Wt· alrt·ady have: the: right to be :o.ilent. This l!'> a poor precedent to t·stahlish," he: said. 

Jim At· kerman, a professor of rc:ligious studies at Indiana llnivc:r· sity, said allowing a momcnt of silc:nce would have: many of the dan· gcrs of officially sponsored school prayer. 
"It is the foot in the door that would break the: separation that is <:rudal to American society," Acker­man said. 
The debaters, who spoke hcfore more than I00 people, differed on cvery otht·r point.

"We can always say to children, 'You can go out in th<: hall while we gooll li>lks stay in h<:re anll pray.' Of course, it's rcally cool for a 7-year· olll to kavc," Ackerman said.

"I  don't  want  my  kids  to  ex­

But Simmons said the proposed amt·ndmt·nt would not aff<:ct children as much as past Supreme Court decisions.

Then they said, 'Now we: are going to start com­pulsory sex education,' but when a little girl raises her hand anll says. 'Teacher, that emharrasses me,' the Supreme Court says in t:ffect, 'Shut your mouth and take it."' 
In 1962, the Supreme Court ruled that prayer composed by state c:ducation otlkials could not be recitcd in public school classrooms. In 1963, tbe court saill any form of prayer or Bibk reading in clas­srooms was unconstitutional. 
"See the double standard?" Sim­mons asked. 
"The prayer amendment doesn't change the Constitution, it puts frredom of prayer back in the Con­stitution," Simmons saill.

Moving toward the future heading backwards 
How do we know Wyoming really exists? 

by Randy Fahs 
Moving Into the Future by Headirzg Backwards 
It seems that every Notre Dame alumnus looks back with fondness on his days under 
RandyFahs 
Friday analysis 
the Golden Dome. They love to tell stories about their personal experiences and what it used to be like when they were here. The tales about mandatory attendance at mass and lights out at IIPM make us laugh about how cloistered and conservative Notre Dame used to be. 
Things have changed a great deal since the days when this place was a combination foot­ball factory and monastery. Attitudes have become more liberal and the reputation and atmosphere have been greatly altered. 
These changes are largely due to the efforts of one man, Father Theodore Hesburgh. His career at Notre Dame is drawing to a close, although not as rapidly as mine. 
Lately, the liberal trends have been reversed and there has been a defmite tighten­ing of control. As a senior I find that a great many traditions which existed when I arrived here have been extinguished. It's almost like Notre Dame is trying to freeze itself in time before Father Ted leaves so that this place will remain fairly unchanged in the future. 
It seems odd to me that the person who brought about the liberal changes at Notre Dame, which have helped to make it the fine university that it is today, is presently leading us on a more regressive path. 
When I talked to some of the freshmen and sophomores about my experiences at their stage ofmy undergraduate career, I found that I'm like an old alumnus in that I was discussing activities which no longer take place. This began to bother me, so I sat down and made a list ofa few campus activities which have gone out of existence. It was an exercise which I can only describe as depressing. 
In the area ofsocial activities, campus wide events have suffered heavy casualties. Gone are the Irish Wake and the Polish Wedding. The Senior Death March is also no more and now even the Beaux Arts Ball seems to be destined to become another punch and cookies affair. 
Anything even remotely associated with the consumption ofalcohol presents itselfas a lucrative target for the administration's right wing social death squads. All we can do now is wait for Father Beauchamp's committee to release its report on changes in the campus alcohol policy -it could prove to be the most damaging blow to social life yet delivered. 
The administration has also worked to un­dercut the non-alcohol related activities. They are discouraging the Panty Raid as being juvenile and out of line with Christian moral ethics. I will grant that its maturity level is questionable, but so what? The Panty Raid is the type of pressure release which helps to make the transition to college life a little smoother. 
Another event which has been torpedoed, but which hasn't sunk is Mardi Gras. The un­doing ofthis much awaited winter event is not due to the administration, but rather to the bishop who decided that gambling, even ifthe proceeds go to charity, should not be allowed. 
Recent Mardi Gras organizers have worked hard to bring the event back to prominence, but its popularity is merely a fraction of what it once was when each dorm built a booth in Stepan Center. 
One move which caused quite a stir this year, but whose real implications will surface in the future is the act ofbringing the Observer under the thumb of the university's Budget Unit Control System. When you give control of a a newspaper's finances to someone, you also give them ultimate authority as to what gets printed. 
I guess that the present situation is better than selling the paper to Rupert Murdoch, but I bet he would at least put the guidelines ofthe working relationship in writing. 
I do not want to bemoan the present state of our football and basketball teams as both seem to be showing signs ofimprovements. It does seem a shame though that we are no longer allowed to go onto the field or pass girls up in 
the stands at football games. The loss of the 
latter tradition is due to the obvious safety 
questions, but the end of the former seems to 
do little more than put a damper on the spirit 
of the crowd. 
Oh well, it could be worse. they could make us stay home and watch games on TV because we make too much noise (besides, they could double the price of student tickets and sell them to the public so as to make more money). 
While we are on the topic of sports and money, I think the plight of the Hockey Program (or lack thereof) should be men­tioned. After dropping them to club status be­cause they lost too much money, FatherJoyce and company are now going to bring them to Division I without scholarships. 
I said all along in my columns last year that all they really wanted to do is strip the program of its scholarships. After two years without recruiting and with no scholarships, the Hockey program will be about as com­petitive as the Chicago Cubs would be if they were transferred into the National Hockey League. 
After all that has been shot down around here during the last four years, I shudder to think about what the future holds. Hopefully some brash young priest will come along once again and reshape the lhiversity in a more liberal and progressive mold. Also, hopefully he'll have the good sense to retire early. 
Is Gary Hart a candidate ofnew ideas or just a candidate with resurrected old ideas? Has Walter Mondale sold out to special interest groups? What is a person to believe? 
It seems that it is getting harder and harder 
Mark Boennighausen 
Gravity is a myth 
to believe anything these days. We were first told, after Hart's upset victory in the New 
Hampshire primary, that he was the candidate of the future. CBS news ran stories comparing him to John F. Kennedy. Now, he has no "beef." Things change so quickly that before a decision can be made there is no longer a question. 
Much of the difficulty in knowing what to believe comes from the quick pace of today's society. Information is produced, analyzed and changed before anyone can digest it. No longer is there time to debate an issue and find out all the facts and then decide -all a person has to grab on~o is fleeting images. 
The problem of what to believe is not limited to politics. Everything moves so fast these days that we tend to just accept things, rather then believe them. Take a look around at the normal events ofa day. 
At the dining halls a poster proclaims a new special dinner: "A Hoosier Festival." Personal­ly, I can't believe such a thing as a Hoosier Festival exists, let alone that I am going to have the pleasure of experiencing one. I will, ofcourse, accept it because I am conditioned to (and I can't afford to eat off-campus.) 
This example may seem a bit trivial, but a look at what one truly believes and what one just accepts may be startling. A government professor once told me that he didn't believe Wyoming existed. He said he had never met anyone from the state, flown over it, or been to it. 
In fact, he said, Wyoming was a myth. Of course he also thought the only thing west of the Hudson River was Dayton, Ohio -but then again how many people really believe Wyoming exists? 
Part of why it is so difficult to believe any­thing these days is that there is no one to trust. Dan Rather, even with a sweater, is not someone to put complete faith in. Anyone who interrogates people the way he did on segments of 60 Minutes seems to lack some trustworthiness. Whatever happened to avun­cular Walter Cronkite? With his baritone

voice and craggy features Uncle Walter was someone you could trust. 
It is now the fashion for presidents to lie to us, or at least now we find out about it. In newspapers some reporters frabricate stories or, in many instances, embellish them a little to fit their viewpoint. At Notre Dame, changes such as the alcohol policy stay "secret" until, in most cases, rumors are confirmed. 
Indeed, a lot of the apparent cynicism around campus can probably be traced to a lack of anything to believe in. The idealism of the 60 s has been replaced by the acceptance ofthe way things are in the 80s. 
But what should be done? After all, there are jobs to get, tests to study for and more special dinners to attend. Philosophy majors would undoubtedly suggest that the question of whether to believe or not should be based on a rational weighing of all the available evidence. What is needed is for people to make time to gather such evidence instead of just going along for the ride. 
Big Brother, in 1984, claimed that "ignorance is strength" and apathetic accep­tance is too close to ignorance for comfort. Uncle Walter isn't doing the evening news anymore and I hope we can get i;!long without him.

A lesson in lively introductions 

served in friendly surroundings can 
still be had at Louie's. To those ofyou who enjoy Italian foo.d: give Louie's a try before it's too late. The pizza can hold its own with the best ofthcm, but the real stand­out is the Louie's pasta ­the mos­taccioli with sausage or meatballs in particular. The sauce and sausage used for the pasta and the pizza are both products ofa long standing Rappelli family recipe. Both arc ex­quisite. Italian bread is included in the price of the meal and, yes, beer as well ao; a good selection ofltalian wines are available (Ifyou're 21 that is). As the closest restaurant to campus and the tlve points bars (Louie's is still at the cornerofNotre Dame and South Bend Aves., 100 feet from Notre Dame Apartments and a two minute walk from Corby's).

"We're like a great old movie actor: we've been off the screen for awhile but we still got our stuff. We just have to be patient until we're rediscovered."

Quick quiz: What is the single essential element offilm comedy? The answer is, ofcourse,laughter. There's nothing very sophisticated about the question, but amazingly there are people in the smoggy hills of Hollywood who would probably have difficulty answering it correct­!y. lj When a producer, director and major movie studio collaborate to make a motion picture, they usually know whether it will be a rip-roaring comedy, a tearjerker or a mushy love story. Apparently Pato Guzman, Paul Mazursky, and Columbia Pictures were a little confused about exactly what type offilm "Moscow on the Hudson" should be. Yes, it is supposed to be a comedy, but unfor­tunately for the audience it doesn't come offthat way. After a promising first 30 minutes or so, the humor in "Moscow on the Hudson" fades fast. The comedy of the situation, in which Vladimir Ivanhoff, a Russian clarinet player adroitly played by Robin Williams, defects to the good old decadent U.S.A. in very decadent Bloomingdale's in ultra-decadent New York City, docs not la~t throughout the film.

Home quadrangular 
Men's tennis team hosts meet 
By ED KONRADY 
Sports Writer 

The Notre Dame men's tennis team, after defeating Bowling Green 8-1 Wednesday, hosts a quadran­gular meet this weekend with Illinois-Chicago, Indiana State, and Wisconsin-Oshkosh. 
The victory over the Falcons boosted the team's ss;ason record to 11-6, its third victory in a row and fifth ofthe last six. 
"We did some juggling of the lineup against Bowling Green," said Head Coach Tom Fallon. "Pat Shields, because of his good chal­lenge matches, played sixth singles, and Mike Gibbons moved from second singles to first. 
"Pat was bothered by some injury problems, hut if he can concentrate, he can help us. Mike is one of our most steady performers. He is con­sistent time in and time out." 
Bowling Green proved to be an easy foe for the Irish, as they swept the singles and lost only at second doubles. 
This weekend the Irish will have a tough time, playing three matches in two days. Last year, Notre Dame defeated Indiana State, 5-l, and Wisconsin-Oshkosh twice, 8-1 and 6-0. 
"Illinois-Chicago has a good coach and a couple of really good players," said Fallon, "but I don't know what to expect from them. 
"We have to play as well or better than we played against Bowling Green. We defeated both Wisconsin-Oshkosh and Indiana State last year, so if history holds up, we should be able to handle those two teams." 
The action between these four teams starts today at 3 p.m. and con­tinues tomorrow starting at 9 a.m. at the Courtney Tennis Center. 

Most important game so far 
Lacrosse team visits Ohio Wesleyan 
The Notre Dame lacrosse team, coming off its third straight win on Wednesday, travels to Delaware, Ohio, to take on the Midwest Lacrosse Association defending champion, Ohio Wesleyan, tomor­row afternoon. The game is the most important one so far this season for the Irish as Wesleyan is the favorite to repeat as MLA champion. 
Notre Dame faces an even tough­er task in that it has to play Wesleyan away from Cartier Field. Last year, the Irish benefited from a large home crowd and put up a strong fight before falling to Wesleyan, 14­
12. This year's game is the only time that the Irish have to leave home to play a tough team, as the three other major rivals -Denison, Ohio State, and Wooster College-have to visit Cartier. 
Coach Rich O'Leary would like to see his team keep the momentum that it gathered in the final quarter of Wednesday's game against a gritty Lake Forest team. The Irish took a fairly decisive 11-5 win to improve their record to 3-2, but needed a five-goal fourth quarter to break open a close game.· 
Until the final quarter, though, the Foresters gave Notre Dame all it could handle, tying the score at 3-3 and trailing by a lone goal, 6-5, at the end of the third quarter. However, goals byJoe Hart, Tim Corrigan, and Tom Grote, as well as two by Joe Franklin, ended Lake Forest's hopes for an upset. 
Once again, attackman Bob Troc­chi led the Irish offense, scoring four goals and increasing his goal total to 1 7 through five gamb. Franklin added three goals and an assist, while tri-captain Steve Pearsall, Hart, Corrigan, and Grote all contributed a goal each. Don Gayhardt chipped in three assists. 
Rob Simpson once again started in the goal for Notre Dame, stopping 1 I Forester shots before being relieved by Pat Poletti, who picked up two saves. 
After the Ohio Wesleyan game, the Irish will travel to Mt. Union Col­lege for a game Tuesday afternoon. The first Notre Dame home game of the season will be next Saturday when Wooster visits Cartier for a 
1:30 p.m. game.

The Most SophisticatedTraining Ground For NudearEngineeringIsn't OnThe Ground. 
It's on a Navy ship. 

The Navy has more than 1,900 reactor-years of nuclear power experience­more than anyone else in America. The Navy has the most sophisti­cated nuclear equip­ment in the world. And the Navy operates over half of the nuclear reactors in America. 
With a nuclear program like that, you know the Navy also offers the most compre­hensive and sophisticated nuclear training. 
Every officer in the Nuclear Navy completes a full year of graduate level technical training. Outside the Navy, this kind of program would cost you thousands. In the Navy, you're paid while you learn. 
Then, as a nuclear-trained officer, you supervise highly trained personnel in the get them fast. Because in the Navy, as your knowledge grows, so do your responsibilities. 

Today's Nuclear Navy is one of the most challenging and reward­ing career choices a man can make. And that choice can pay off 
while you're still in school. Qualified juniors and seniors earn approximately $1,000 per month while they finish school. 
As a nuclear-trained officer, after 4 years with regular promotions and pay increases, you can be earning as much as $40,500. That's on top of a full benefits pack­age that includes medical and dental care, and 30 days' vacation earned each year. 
As a nuclear-trained officer, you also earn a place among this nation's most qualified and respected professionals. So,

Tomorrow the Notre Dame golf team faces tough Big Ten competi­tion as it travels to Purdue, where it hopes to expand on its opening meet wins last weekend and better its current 2-0 record. 
Last Saturday, the Irish beat Tri­State by 19 shots on the Burke Memorial Golf Course, taking the match 375-394. Leading the way for the Irish was senior captain Dave Moorman, who shot a two-over-par 73 to lead all golfers. 
"It (the Tri-State match-up) was a beautiful performance for the first time out," commented Notre Dame head coach Noel O'Sullivan. 
Sunday the Irish maintained their perfect record in the early going by taking Xavier, 375-405. Helping the Irish were strong performances by sophomore John Anthony, 73, and freshman Chris Bona, 74. 
O'Sullivan's squad is led by three seniors: Moorman, Dave Pangrase, and Frank Leyes. "They have

maturity, experience, and excellent skill," comments O'Sullivan. "I con­sider this to be one of my best teams on paper." 
Other than these three seniors, O'Sullivan is endowed with a fine supporting cast, including ex­perienced senior Jack Eisenbeis, four sophomores, and four fresh­men. 
An Irish "blue team" proved this depth by finishing second W ednes­day afternoon in a 10-team tourna­ment at the Hamshire Country Club outside ofGrand Rapids, Mich. Soph­omore jon Huffman, medalist for the day with a 78, led an Irish attack which fell short by two strokes to Grand Rapids Community College, who hosted the event. 
"This (Wednesday tournament) 

was the first time that I had a team 
finish so well without playing the 
course previously," commented 
O'Sullivan. 
Teeing off early tomorrow morn­

ing, the Irish will face some of the 
best competition from the Big Ten 
and across the Midwest in the 
Purdue Invitational. Three of the 
best teams who will participate are 
Purdue, Ohio State, and Indiana. The 
Irish, who finished 1Oth in the 
Purdue field last year, are looking to 
fmish among the top five this year in 
the 15-team, 54-hole event. 
"Purdue has to have an edge be­cause it's their home course," says O'Sullivan. "The number-one team in our district is Ohio State; they're awesome with their first-string all­American Chris Perry." 
The lineup for Notre Dame will in­clude Moorman, Bona, sophomores John O'Donovan and Jon Huffman, Leyes, and Pangraze. 
"We're· looking forward to a 

weekend that is nothing spectacular 
in weather but spectacular in our 
team performance and team place­
ment," comments O'Sullivan. "It's 
going to be a test of stamina and en­
durance (but) we're prepared psy­
chologically and physiologically. 
After this invitational, we'll really 
know what kind ofteam we have." 
The Irish will play 36 holes tomor­row, beginning at 7:30 a.m., followed by 18 more on Sunday at the South Course in West Lafayette, Ind. 
Scores from last weekend's action 

against Tri-State include: Moorman, 
73; Leyes, 76; Pangraze, 78; 
O'Donovan, 77; Bona, 75; and Huf­
fman, 74. Against Xavier the scores 
were: Moorman, 76; Leyes, 77; 
Pangraze, 80; O'Donovan, 74; Bona, 
74; and Anthony, 73. 
Hawaii

Dame's doubles pairs lost their first sets to Hawaii. Then the number­one doubles team of Colligan and Fischette lost their second set, which gave Hawaii a 4-3 edge over the Irish. 
The score was subsequently tied at 4-4 as the number-two doubles pair of Panther and Lee won their second and third sets. 
Fans and team members then moved to neighboring courts as the number-three doubles match was won by Notre Dame's Greta Roemer and Cathy Schnell. 
"I hope we learn from our mistakes and improve our con­centration," said Petro. "We want to be champions, and to do that we must concentrate."

Passes Chamberlain 
Jabbar becomes all-time scorer 
A.'isoclated Press 
LAS vegas, Nef. -Kareem Abdul Jabhar became the National Basket­hall Association's all-time leading scorer when he hit a sky hook to break Wilt Chamberlain's mark of ~ 1,419 points last night. 
Ahdui-Jabhar took a feed from Ear­

vin "'Magic" Johnson and hit the I 0­
foot shot with H:c; -~ left in the Los 
Angdes Lakl·rs' game against the 
lltah Jazz. 
A sellout crowd of 18,3H9 gave thc 7-2 ccntcr a thunderous stand­ing ovation aftcr he broke the record as his teammates surrounded him in a cirde at midcourt. 
The rdert't."s stopped the game .md NBA commissioner David Stern went to midcourt to congratulate Ahdul-Jabbar. 
"'I'd like to give thanks to the great Allah for gifting me," Abdui-Jabbar told the crowd over the public­address system. ''I'd like to give thanks to my parents who are both here tonight for a lot of inspiration and a lot ofcourage and a lot ofsup­port. 

"I want to give my best to my fami­ly and lastly, I want to thank all of you tans for your tremendous sup­port," he said. 
Chamberlain, who had been ex­
pected at the game, was not in 
attendance. 

!.akers Coach Pat Riley sub­stituted Mitch Kupchak for Abdul­)abbar after he broke the record. 
Jabhar's shot, which gave him 22 points for the game, came after he missed a sky hook in the Lakers' pre­vious trip down thc court.

Appeals court upholds Perez drug conviction 
i\ ssociated Press 
SANTIAGO, Dominican Republic -Atlanta Braves pitcher Pascual Perez appean·d m:aring the end of his three-month imprisonment yes­tcrday as a three-judge appeals court upheld his March 23 conviction on the reduced charge of cocaine pos­session, the equivalent of a mis­demeanor. 
However, Perez was returned to the Fort San Luis prison, where he has been hdd since his arrest on jan. 9, to await the possible appeal of the ruling by the prosecution to the Dominican Supreme Court. 
Both sides have I 0 days to file an appt.·al ofyestcrday's ruling. 
Tht.· panl'l handed down the ruling after a five-and-one-half-hour hearing in which witnesses were recalled and evidence re-t·xamined. 
The court also upheld the S I ,000 fine imposed on Perez by Criminal Courtjudge Fanny Cervantes for tht.· 
possession conviction. Perez has al­ready paid the fine. 
"I'm very happy," the 24-year-old right-hander said as he left the crowded courtroom. "I knew th~t my innocence would be proven once again." 
dinand Lewis Alcindor looking on, Abdui-Jabbar wasted no time in going after the record, scoring on a left-handed hook with less than two minutes gone in the game and quick­ly following it with a dunk. 
Abdul-Jabbar hit his frrst six shots of the game and his stuff with four seconds left in the frrst half gave him 16 points. five short of the record. 
The six-time NBA Most Valuable Player, who had scored 20 or more points in his last I 7 games, moved to within three of the record when he hit one of his patented sky hooks midway through the third quarter. 
But, with the crowd roaring everytime he touched the hall, Abdul-Jahbar missed his only other shot of the quarter. 
With I0:45 left in the game, Abdui-Jahbar took a feed from james Worthy and dunked to tie the record. 
Less than two minutes later, with the crowd on its feet clapping in uni­son, Johnson looked for the ball, waited for Abdul-Jabbar to get downcourt, and then hit the great center on the right baseline. 
Abdul-Jabbar turned to his left, and, guarded by two defenders, hit his record-breaking shot.

Patrick says he is not at all in­timidated by the compeuuon his team faces in tonight's game. 
"I saw them play last year," he says, adding confidently, "We'll take care ofthem in pretty short time. I'm sure they're pretty good, but we had a pretty extensive training program with that (eating) contest." 
Blumb says the 1OK Champs were selected for tonight's game because the Bookstore commissioners felt that the team "has potentiaL" 
"They're willing to put on a good show," Blumb says, "and that's a good way to start off the tourna­ment, because this is a fun tourna­ment. 
"They've told me that they're going to cater the game," Blumb continues. "They will be eating throughout the entire game. The on­ly problem is that this is a Friday during Lent, so they will not be able to have any meat. But the way it sounds, they're going to do some very interesting things." 
The games in this tournament should continue to be interesting even after tonight. There has been a tremendous amount of interest in this year's event, and 22 teams were turned away from competition when the 512-team limit was reached. Blumb cites a classified ad which appeared in Wednesday'sOb­server as evidence ofthis interest. 
"I think it's going to be a good tournament," he says. "The fact that we had a team wanting to buy a spot for 25 dollars ought to say how valuable those spots are and how seem to worry Blumb about this tournament: the weather and the constant reappearance of the num­ber 13.

"It's Bookstore Basketball XIII, and it's starting on a Friday," the mildly-superstitious commissioner jokes. "We're even playing on Friday the 13th next week, but I'm hoping things will go welL 
"It was so nice last weekend, but watch -this Sunday it will snow, and we'll have ro play in it," Blumb laments. "Who knows what we're going to get in South Bend this time of year. We've got to hope that it's nice. I can control a lot of things with this tournament, but the weather is one thing that I can't do a darn thing about." 
Rain, snow. or sunshine, the 
games will go on, with the first 
regular games beginning Sunday af­

One game to watch on Sunday will be at 3 p.m. on Stepan 6. That game will pit Four K & O.C. against Four Guys That Would Rather Be At Quarter Beer Night And One Guy That Would Rather Be At Lewis.

counted for a total of 18 tackles in the Pitt and Penn State games. Bars is continuing to "work hard," accord­ing to his coach, and will again lend depth and experience to the posi­tion. 
Banks, who gained a start against Air Force in 1983, brings a good combination of strength and quick­ness to the position. The 6-5, 234­pound Banks was named national prep player of the year in 1982 by the COlumbus (Ohio) Touchdown Club. 
"Banks has the potential to become a very good player," Harris notes. "Although he still needs some experience, he has a good attitude and has made up his mind to work hard." 
With all of the demands on an outside linebacker, Harris is still confident that his players can do well, as long as they are consistent. 
"Our outside linebackers take an academic approach to the game ­knowing what to do in all cir­cumstances," Harris adds. "But we must strive for consistency. 
"The goal we have for our players is for them to become the·best that they can be. That will enable the coaches to determine who are.the best people for each situation so we can have them in the game at that time." 
But until then, Harris is g<:tting used to all of the new people, and they are getting used to him.

Bookstore Basketball XIII begins tonight with Hall of Fame Game 
By PHIL WOLF 
Sports Writer 

You won't find it in The Guinness Book ofWorld Records, but it is the largest single-elimination basketball tournament in the world. Although the editors of the record book decline to list it presently, the '512­team tournament is the most ex­tensive anywhere. 
It is the one-and-only Bookstore Basketball Tournament, and it is back again for the 13th straight year. 
The tournament begins tonight at 6 p.m. on Bookstore court 9 with the annual Hall of Fame Game. The par­ticipants in this year's Hall of Fame matchup will be Tequila White Lightning IV and The IOK Caloric Champ Fastbreakers, and Bookstore Commissioner Jeff Blumb says he is excited about the opening game. 
"We're hoping it (the Hall ofFame Game) is as good as last year's," Blumb says. "It's going to be hard to top or match last year's, hut we think we have a game that might come close." 
Last year, The Even Worse Off fell to Love and the Shooting Stars, 2I-7, in a very entertaining Hall of Fame Game. The Even Worse Off arrived 
at the Bookstore in a limousine and 
stepped out onto a red carpet. After 
the team used a small trampoline to 
slam dunk during warmups, Univer­
sity President Father Theodore Hes­
burgh arrived on the scene to bless The Even Worse Off in Latin. The prayer was not enough help, however, and the team was overcome by Karl Love (a varsity walk-on), john Frierot, and the rest ofthe Shooting Stars. 
Tonight's game possibly could rival the fun of that game a year ago. Tequila White Lightning should provide most of the talent, and the IOK Champs should provide most of the fun for the night. 
Tequila White Lightning finished as runner-up to Bookstore XII Champion Macri's Preferred Stock last year, and the team has four players returning. The only new member of the squad is freshman Steve Beuerlein, a varsity ti>othall player who also led Sorin Hall to the 
interhall  basketball  championship  
this winter.  
Lightning captain  Brian  Enright  

says that he is looking forward to the game. 
"Everyone is excited about it," says Enright, who adds that his team never has formal practices or strategy meetings. "Everybody's in pretty good shape, and we like to play, so we just take one game at a time." 
The IOK Caloric Champ Fastbrcakers, however, definitely 
Bookstore XIII 
have been preparing for tonight's big evt:nt. The team, which consists of the top five finishers in the Law School IOK Caloric Course ('ating contest, will be playing what captain Wayne Patrick calls "a buffet game." 
According to a news release from the Fastbrcakcrs, the team ··avcragl·s over 46,000 calories per game." In addition, thc IOK Champs havl· a special offense, called the "dunka· stuffa-jamma offense," and they run

With last match victory 
Women's tennis team tops Hawaii 
By MARY SIEGER 
Sports Writer 

A tennis match isn't over until the last ball is served. The Notre Dame women's tennis team proved how true this sports cliche can be as the Irish narrowly defeated a highly­rated squad from the University of Hawaii, 5-4, last night under the north dome of the ACC. 
"It feels good to win," said Irish head coach Sharon Petro. "It shouldn't have been as close as 5-4, but we came from behind and that's nice considering a team like Hawaii." 
Hawaii came to South Bend on the 24th day of its month-long tour of the mainland boasting an impressive I9-'5 season record. Despite Hawaii's strong record, Petro was confident of an Irish victory. "We had comparable scores and we ex­pected to win," she said. 
Although the Irish dropped their first match, 7-'5 and 6-4, sophomore Susie Panther played well at first 
Unfamiliar faces at linebacker 
By THERON ROBERTS 
Sports W'n'ter 
Unfamiliar faces abound this spring in thc outside linebacker area of thl· football practice field behind the ACC. 
In addition to new outside linebacker coach Bishop Harris, the two players who last year started for the Irish at those postions arc noticeably abscnt. 
Rick Naylor, the second-leading tackler on last year's team, does not return for next season. Naylor boasted fine career statistics: I46 tackles, three fumble recoveries and three interceptions, while earning starting assignments 24 times in the past three rears. 
Senior (to-be) Mike Golic is also not to be seen at spring drills. The defensive co-captain is sitting out this spring due to an injury,. 
The 6-'5, 2'57-pound Golic was the defensive MVP for the Irish last season and an honorable mention choice on The Associated Press' All­America team. Golic was fourth on the team in tackles, accounting for '59 stops. He led the team in tackles behind the line of scrimmage with ten, and in fumble recoveries with two. He also had tour quarterback sacks. 

In addition, Golic has Jogged a lot oftime on the field during his career, playing in 33 of 34 games since his arrival three years ago. 
Golic was listed as a defensive end last year, and although the position will bc referred to as outside linebacker in I9B4, the respon­sibilities will be the same. 
"The outside linebacker probably has the most difficult position on defense in college football because ofthe way offenses attack," says Har­ris. " He has to be able to play many roles: pass rusher, be able to play runs, contain the sweep, and cover backs running pass patterns. 
So far this spring, Harris has had an opportunity to look at a lot of dif­ferent people, and he is happy with what he has seen. 
"I'm pleased with ~lle way the players are working and with their attitude," notes Harris. "But we need to improve on our consistency." 
With Golic's position the only sure bet for next fall, four other players are in the running for the other spot. 
Junior Rick DiBernardo was the leading candidate for the other start­ing assignment before suffering aft injury earlier this spring. The 6-3, 238-pound DiBernardo backed up Naylor last season and was having a good spring until he pulled a hamstr­ing muscle last week. 
"With a good spring, Rick will be able to help us," says his coach. "He's missed some valuable scrimmage time, however." 
Also in contention for the position are seniors Brian Behmer and Joe Bars, and sophomore Robert Banks. 
The 6-6, 232-pound Behmer, who switched from his tight end slot in order to help add some depth on 
defense,  has  been  the  biggest  
surprise for Har ris.  
"Brian  has  been  a  pleasant

singles in two long and gruelhng sets. Panther became frustrated 
· when she missed shots, revealing her determination to win. "Her opponent was steady and strong," explained Petro. "Sometimes her concentration waned, but she came right back again." In the number-two singles slot, Irish co-captain Lisa Lafratta lost her frrst set, 6-2, to Rose Thomas. However, she rallied in the second and third sets, 6-4 and 6-2, to give the Irish an important point against the Rainbows. At the number-three singles spot, · Mary Colligan easily defeated her opponent, 6-I and 6-2, giving the Irish another crucial point. Pam Fischette lost two close sets, 6-5 and 6-4. "Pam's opponent was strong," said Petro. "She had a Jot of concentration which you usually don't see in the number-four spot." The fifth match was a disappointe­ment for the Irish as junior Laura Lee dropped two sets, 6-4 and 6-3. Lee 

attempted to compensate for a slow start in the first set, but she was unable to overcome her opponent. 
"She can play better," said Petro. "But she improved and played a good doubles game." 
Freshman joanne Biafore was im­pressive in the number-six singles spot and easily won in two sets, 6-I and 6-2, to retain an undefeated 
spring  record.  "She's  been  im­ 
pressive all spring and is still  un­ 
defeated," said Petro.  

The score between the two teams was tied .3-.3 as they completed the singles competition, and the Irish needed to win at least two of the three doubles matches to claim the entire match. Petro wasdisappointcd with some players performances and th<mght the Irish should have lead Hawaii 4-2 or '5-l going into the doubles. 
Things looked grim for thc Irish as they entered the second round of doubles competition. Each of Notre
