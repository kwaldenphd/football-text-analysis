Celebrating the 75th anniver­sary of the Bengal Bouts, alum­ni boxers gathered this week­end and looked on as the Notre Dame Boxing Club gave birth to 11 new "million dollar babies" at Saturday night's final rounds. 
Well, $100,000 babies, at least. 
Through a combination of fundraising techniques ­Bengal Bouts alumni donations as well as the sale of tickets, program advertising and mer­chandise-the dub has raised a preliminary amount of $75,000. However, Pat Farrell, Bengal Bouts coach and chair of the alumni reunion commit­teo for this year's bouts, said he "has no doubt" that the final total will exceed $100,000. 
That's a long way from the 1931 donation of $500. Considering that in recent years the dub usually donates

INSIDE COLUMN 


You can be Latin too 
Its not about you not being Latin, its how you express it. 
Perfect words to describe Latin Expressions. Never heard of it? Well, I'm glad you asked. 
Each year, dur­
ing Spring Vis  Lukas Mendoza  
Weekend, a show  
is put on that highlights the  Photographer  
many talents that  
can be found on  

this campus. If you are wondering if this is a shameless plug, then you would be correct. I can't help it though, I happen to be in the show. 
But first, Latin Expressions allows people to show their Latin side. From the music to the lan­guage, everything in the show is distinctly Latin. And it ranges from all of Latin America, and Spain too, the origin of the culture that domi­nates south of the US border, and heck, many parts of this country too. You will love the thing that is Latin Expressions. I haven't meet one person yet who has not been satisfied with the show. Not only Latinos perform in the show, as you will see when you go check out the show. 
With prospective students coming to see the show, the university also shows a side of itself that some­times isn't clearly seen. That of the diversity that does exist here. I used to believe that the minority students were only that, a minority that didn't do much at all. I believed that all the way up until last year's show. I realized that there is so much for minority stu­dents, in clubs and organizations, in activities that go on and in cele­brations that are thrown. That is the beauty of this show. No matter what your background is, you can perform in the show. The only thing is that it has to be Latin in some way. I know a few non-latin people who can shake their "bon-bon." The best part of all of these things are that everyone is welcome. 
Having said that, I'm glad I'm a part of the minority students body here, but that doesn't mean if you aren't a minority, you can't be a part of these things. Evidence of this is in Latin Expressions and in the Fashion Show ti")at is the night after. And it also doesn't mean that you can't go to the show. 
Come see traditional Mexican dancing, music from different artists throughout Latin America, traditional Spanish dancing, mod­ern dancing to Latin music, origi­nal poems written by our peers and· a closing act that will blow you away. 
So remember, April 1, 7 p.m., Palais Royale, downtown South Bend. 
That night, everyone is a Latino.

Notre Dame's llaiti Program. led by biologist Father Thomas Streit, has as its goal the elimination of LF from llaiti by 2012. As many as 2 million of Haiti's 8.3 million people are believed infected with the mosquito­borne parasites that eause LF. 
The focus of the Haiti sympo­sium will be fortified salt pro­duction in llaiti. Under the leadership of the llaiti lleallh Ministry, Notre Dame and prin­cipal partners Holy Cross llospital, the Centers for Disease Control and UNICEF have been working to fortify the Haiti salt supply with the drug diethylcarbamazine (DEC) and iodine to interrupt the transmission of LF and amelio­rate iodinn deficiency stan­dards.

got." 

McDonald said part of recog­nizing each individual's leader­ship potential comes from women who epitomize leader­ship. 
"We wanted this experience to reinforce in them what it is like to be at Saint Mary's and additionally, we were hoping there would be a sort of discov­ery -that the attendees would realize that they were already exhibiting a lot of leadership skills, even if they didn't realize it yet," McDonald said. "There are many different ways to be a leader at Saint Mary's." 
The conference attendees ranged from corporate execu­tives to stay-at-home moms to self-employed small business owners. The conference gave alums an opportunity to recon­nect with one another as well as meet and talk with current students at Saint Mary's. 
Friday night's keynote speak­ers -Superintendent of Benton Harbor schools Paula Dawning and Presidential Medal of Freedom winner Frances Hesselbein drew a large crowd of not only alumnae but current students and other members of the campus community. 
Before planning of the confer­ence, Earley and McDonald studied other college's alumnae leadership programs as well as collaborating with the Center for Women's Intercultural Leadership (CWIL) and the Office of Multicultural Affairs (OMA). 
"We did a lot of leadership studies, looking at models cre­ated by Duke, Georgetown, Welsley and more, but when we sat down to do it, we created a program that was all our own," Earley said. "This took two years of planning, but it's t.r;-ue what they say, if you build it, they will come." 
McDonald said since this con­ference was so successful, she is hoping more will be planned for the future. 
"We are hopeful that this is the beginning of a tradition," McDonald said. "This is just another example of what Saint Mary's women can do."

about $50,000, this year's contributiQn is "amazing," sen­ior captain Nathan Lohmeyer said. 
The additional money, said both Farrell and Lohmeyer, came from the pockets of Bengal Bouts alumni. The club sent letters to· alumni request­ing donations, with a $750 gift establishing an alumnus as a founding member of the Nappy Legacy Fund, named in honor of the first coach of the bouts, Dominic "Nappy" Napolitano. 
Alumni were also invited to campus for a series of events surrounding the 75th anniver­sary, including a reception in the press box Friday night and a banquet in the Monogram Room Saturday evening. The weekend culminated in Saturday night's finals. 
"We just want to get people back here and get them upped again," Farrell said. "They'll say, 'Hey, this is kind of a nice place.' And of course, whatever we can raise for the missions is fantastic." 
Ticket prices were $1 0 for a general, all-nights ticket, $5 for a student single-night ticket and $8 or $10 (during the final rounds) for a non-student sin­gle-night ticket. Reserved seat­ing near the ring was also available for a higher fee. Tickets were sold at the dining hall during the week before the event, but they were also avail­able at the door. 
Each boxer was required to sell 1 0 tickets as well as adver­tising for the programs, which were, in turn, sold each night of the bouts for $1. Advertisers varied from dorms to clubs to parents of the boxers. 
Hecognizing the lucrative industry that is the T-shirt busi­ness at Notre Dame, the club sold Bengal Bouts shirts for $15 in the dining halls and at each night of the bouts. Polo shirts, hats and stickers recognizing the 75th anniversary were also on sale. 
Another money-saver for the club came from Adidas, which agreed to cover the cost of the clothing for each boxer (two shirts and a pair of shorts). The "$1 ,000 or so," according to Lohmeyer, that would have been removed for that expense remained a part of the dona­tion. 
After asking for something from the alumni, the club gave something back to them: they presented the Bengal Bouts Award -given annually to someone who has gone "above and beyond the call in service to the club," according to Lohmeyer -to anyone who has ever been a member of the Notre Dame Boxing Club, or spent time in the ring. 
Alumni from the class of 1944 to the class of 2003 gathered in the ring to accept the award. 
"It was cool to see a guy who was 82 standing next to a guy who was 22," Lohmeyer said. "They were both part of the same organization." 
Sophomore boxer Clayton Lougee emphasized the bonds formed through the Bengal Bouts experience. 
"The amazing part about the Bengal bouts is that we train so hard all together before we get in the ring, then we go and face off ... but then once the fight is over, after we've tried so hard to completely beat each other up for three rounds, we're right back to being friends," he said. 
They fight, but they're friends. And they fight for something more than a title. 
The money they raise goes to the Holy Cross Mission in Daka, Bangladesh, which is made up of a school, college, seminary, orphanage and hospital. 
The Boxing Club is the single largest supporter of this mis­sion; "their financial stability depends on how much money [the club] raise[s]," Lohmeyer said. 
Indeed, according to the Bengal Bouts Web site, one American dol.lar can feed and clothe a family of five for a day in Bangledesh. 
Reflecting upon a visit to the mission, Bengal Bouts coach Tom Suddes wrote, "I have never fully realized the impact of the Bengal Bouts and the boxing program on people's lives in Bangledesh." 
Lohmeyer said it succinctly. 
"I think they're going to bP really, really happy to receive a $100,000 check over there."

before losing to St. John's Serjay Isayenko 15-12. 
"I know that Patrick made big progress this year," head coach Janusz Bednarski said. "He was competing very well so it was not a surprise for me [that he made the finals]." 
Orlando, who had gone from 11th place in the round robin after Saturday to fourth place by the end of Sunday, beat Holly Buechel of Penn 15-5 before losing to Anna Garina of Wayne State 15-6. 
The largest upset of the event came as Kryczalo, the three-time defending cham­pion, attempted to join only 29 other athletes in NCAA history as winners (}f the same event four years in a row. After triumphing over Erszebet Garay of St. John's 15-8, Harvard freshman Emily Cross defeated Kryczalo 15-5 in the finals. 
Along with the medalists, freshman foil Jakub Jedrkowiak (7th), senior sabre Andrea Ament (7th) and sophomore sabre Matt Stearns (lOth) were All­Americans at the event, giv­ing Notre Dame 9 total. 
Despite the individual accolades and troubles, the defining moments of the tournament came when Ohio State's Metta Thompson lost to St. John's Katia Larchanka immediately after Kryczalo had claimed victory over Columbia's Cassidy Luitjen, giving Notre Dame its seventh national championship and securing the team as the sole champi­on. 
"If we win first, we win first, we shouldn't tie it," Providenza said. "We have done that great in a long time, so it was amazing." 
This is the second national championship for Notre Dame this year. The women's soccer team won Dec. 5 with a 4-3 penalty kick decision against UCLA.

The trip was sponsored by CWIL, which also footed the bill since the goals of the con­ference aligned with CWIL's goal of fostering intercultural knowledge. Zayed University, a women's college founded in 1998 in the United Arab Emirates, paid for almost all student accommodations. 
Saint Mary's contributed to three lectures with themes of Muslim-Catholic dialogue, social justice teachings and compassionate listening as a form of reconciliation. 
"We had all shown interest to be in more than just a dia­logue," Madison said. "We still get together every other week to reflect and practice what we learned in the dialogue." 
Upon arriving, Fritz, Madison, Johnston and Quddoura, along with Farina and moderator Tracy Robison, director of the InterCultural Living Community, were "greeted in ... waves of women in black with red triangles [around their necks] saying 'Women as Global Leaders.' I didn't expect to be greeted by women leaders," said Madison. Every aspect of the conference was presented in English except for the welcome, which was in Arabic. 
Entertainment was large­scale and noteworthy, provided with all-out hospitality, according to Johnston. Nothing was held back. A night at a desert resort included fire­works and "a fabulous cook­out, henna tattoos, camel rides and flame throwers," Johnston said. The night the SMC repre­sentatives arrived, there was a laser show in an auditorium and a gala dinner complete with sand art, ice sculptures and a young pianist, cellist and violinist -all from different countries, who collaborated to provide background music the entire night. 
Keynote speakers at the con­ference were multi-genera­tional and included some of the most notable female world leaders. Tipper Gore, wife of former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, spoke about mental health issues; Gro Harlem Brundtland, former Director­General of the World Health Organization, the Right Honourable Kim Campbell, former Prime Minister of Canada, and Patricia de Stacy Harrison, U.S. Assistant

Saint Mary's delegates gather in Dublai for a leadership conference. From left are Veronica Fritz, Angela Johnson, Sister Marianne Farina, Tracy Robinson, Asma Quddura and Carolyn Madison. 
Secretary of State for Education and Cultural Affairs also contributed. 
Other participants in the conference included women and men from the business world. 
According to the Saint Mary's participants, panels and workshops throughout the course of the conference helped to break up the huge amount of women who attend­ed and also served to cater to each woman's individual con­cerns. 
Participation in the Women as, Global Leaders Conference has had profound affects on the Saint Mary's Women who attended. 
Fritz said she initially had reservations about going to a country in the Middle East, but her eyes were opened by the welcome she received. 
"Because we were treated so graciously, I was able to appreciate the different cul­ture as well as the other cul­tures that were there," Fritz said. "We're all the same, and if we focus on our similarities rather than our differences, the world can be a better place." 
Johnston said she felt safe and welcomed "not just in the conference, but everywhere I went in Dubai. Through this conference, my knowledge of the world has grown to include an understanding and appreci­ation of a Middle Eastern cul­ture that I didn't have before." 
"It's a good thing to under­stand a different culture and put into action the respect of a different culture I thought I had before. I realized people the world over are trying to make changes," said Madison, who appreciated Kim Campbell's idea: "You can be a leader whoever you are ­whether a man or a woman." 
Johnston said she could see a need for this leadership con­ference, saying, "It's not likely to see a ton of women out and about in the city." 
"All speakers encouraged leadership both inside families and outside families and how those roles can compliment each other," Johnston said. "To be a good leader, it involves both men and women working together," she said. 
Madison said she learned the importance of realizing one's potential as a leader, but also how to follow other's leader­ship. 
"Without one culture, you couldn't have your own ideas. It's easy to forget that most ideas we have weren't founded by Americans," Madison said. "It's good to remember how similar we are, especially in human rights -inalienable rights." 
Participants hope to main­tain contact with the women they met in Dubai and are already planning future con­ferences.

Nations dispute, re111ove delegates 
Associated Press 

BAGHDAD -Iraq and Jordan engaged in a tit-for­tat withdrawal of ambassa­dors Sunday in a growing dispute over Shiite Muslim claims that Jordan is failing to block terrorists from entering Iraq, while U.S. forces killed 24 insurgents in a clash south of Baghdad. 
An American convoy was traveling through the Salman Pak area, 20 miles southeast of Baghdad, when it was attacked, U.S. offi­cials said. The military returned fire and killed 24 militants. Seven militants and six soldiers were also wounded. 
No further details were available about the attack or the conditions of the wounded soldiers. 
The clash was among the largest involving insurgents since the Jan. 30 elections, and came on a day of bloody attacks by militants throughout the country. 
Sunday's diplomatic row erupted even as a Jordanian court sentenced in absentia Iraq's most feared terrorist -who was born in Jordan -to a 15­year prison term.

Stonecipher resigned at the request of Boning's board of din~ctors for what Chairman l.ew Platt said was unprofessional conduct r11lated to the alTair.

Wlwn Boeing announced Stonecipher's ouster March 7. it said it also was investigating tho woman's artivitins surrounding the matter and did not know wlwthnr she would remain with thn eompany.

Courthouse shooter hurts Atlanta's itnage 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -Atlanta has spent years promoting itself as the welcoming, friendly Capital of the New South ­"the city too busy to hate." 
That image has taken a beating following a deadly courthouse rampage that left many with the impression that the city is unsafe and its police inept. It only gets worse as more details about what went wrong continue to trickle out daily. 
National television and radio talk show hosts have ripped on the city's response to the ram­page, with some referring to the local police as "Keystone Kops." 
A local radio personality even said: "Thank God he left Atlanta, otherwise they never would have found him," refer­ring to the suspect's capture in a suburb. 
Among the missteps: A sur­veillance camera that record­ed images of a rape suspect overpowering a petite deputy and taking her gun was not monitored even as he allegedly entered a courtroom and gunned down a judge and a court reporter. 
Local police did not take control of the crime scene until some 20 minutes after the shootings, as the suspect carjacked five vehicles within a mile of the courthouse before walking to atrain sta­tion in the heart of the city's downtown. 
The first photos of the sus­pect were not circulated until an hour after the initial attack, about the time the suspect escaped on a commuter train. 
Although he asked a reporter whose car he stole for directions to a busy mall, the suspect spent as many as 12 hours milling around out­side the mall, undetected, before assaulting a couple and killing a federal agent. 
And those are just the mis­steps that have come to light in recent days. Others were known by the time the sus­pect, .Brian Nichols, was arrested March 12, following a 26-hour manhunt. 
Mayor Shirley Franklin responded to all the hammer­ing on the city's image Friday, simply by saying: "We're not perfect, but we seek to be the best we can be." 
City officials have nurtured the city's image as a safe, sophisticated place. Atlanta came through the civil rights era with relatively little vio­lence because civic leaders feared trouble would be bad for businnss. 
The city's reputation has helped draw business, sport­ing events and tourists -it is consistently listed among the Top 10 destinations for con­ventions and other large meet­ings. 
But Atlanta also landed third on a list of the nation's most dangerous large cities in November, although the study's authors said it would have been fourth if they had known about unreported crimes in St. Louis. 
Atlanta has done much to play down its crime -even cooking its crime statistics to help land the 1996 Olympics and pump up tourism, accord­ing to an audit commissioned by police and released last year. 

The city's police chief, Richard Pennington, has said he is making widespread improvements in the city's policing and said he will over­see a full review of mistakes in the wake of the courthouse slayings. 
The manhunt and its mis­steps were dissected in the national media, creating a high-profile problem for the city's reputation. 
"Regardless of who failed or why they failed, to the general public the fact is they failed," said Joe King, associate pro­fessor of law and police sci­ence at the John Jay College of Justice in New York. 
"The biggest black eye you could say happened to the Atlanta Police Department and the Sheriff's office is they failed to see this coming and they failed to gear up for it," King said. 
Fulton County Sheriff Myron Freeman did not answer ques­tions about why a 51-year-old, 5-foot female deputy was left alone with an uncuffed, 6-foot­1, 200-pound former college linebacker on trial for rape. 
One of Nichols' alleged vic­tims, the judge on his rape ease, had requested extra security the day before after Nichols was found with shanks in each of his shoes. Even after killing the judge and court reporter, the gunman made it down eight flights of stairs and walked out onto the street before being confronted by a deputy, who was shot and killed. 
Freeman has said his department provided the secu­rity the judge requested, but refused to elaborate. Four days after the shootings, he said he would increase the number of deputies at the courthouse and use more stun belts on defendants. 
"We will do everything in our power to keep such a tragedy from ever occurring again," Freeman said in a written statement. 
Police, meanwhile, focused their manhunt on a vehicle carjacked by the suspect -its description appeared on TVs and highway message boards across the state. However, the vehicle was found 13 hours later on a lower level in the same garage where it was stolen, discovered by one of the garage's customers, not police. 
"We should have gone through the entire building," Pennington said. "We didn't, based on the information we had at the time," which was a report that someone saw the vehide exit the garage. 
In the meantime, Nichols allegedly hijacked other cars and lled on the Atlanta com­muter-train systf~m MARTA 
"There was a huge effort under way to catch this guy. But in many ways he was good and sometimes he was just damn lucky," said Gene Wilson, the police chief of MAHTA. 
Although the incident has brought bad publicity for Atlanta, it shouldn't cause lasting damage to the city's drawing power, said Colin Rorrie, president of Dallas­based Meeting Professionals International.

U.S. defends Pacific, Rice says 
European Union may soon lift embargo imposed on China in 1989 
Associated Press 

BEIJING -Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice suggested Sunday that European govern­ments are irresponsible if they sell sophisticated weaponry to China that might one day be used against U.S. forces in the Pacific. · 
"It is the United States, not Europe, that is defending the Pacific," Rice said. She spoke in Seoul, the penultimate stop on her weeklong tour of Asia.

Lawyer killed by lethal injections 
Prosecutor and family man murdered via forced cocaine overdose 
Associated Press 

MACON, Mo. -A former prosecutor and family man once known for a firm grasp of the difference between right and wrong, David Masters arrived at his death bound to a chair, his final stop along a road of poor choices. 
Two housemates are accused of being his judge and jury, condemning Masters for ·owing three weeks of rent and making passes at a woman with whom he lived. When the woman pulled out a gun, court papers say, Masters said he'd rather die from drugs -so the father of seven was injected with syringe after syringe of cocaine. 
The 52-year-old's body was found the next day, March 3, near a river in the Ozarks, a couple hundred miles from this small town where he made his name upholding the law. 
"No one in their wildest imagination would ever dream he would succumb to an illicit drug problem and associate with the people he did," said James Foley, a former Macon County prosecutor and retired judge. "They try and rational­ize it, but you couldn't even make this up in TV fiction. That's what his life became." 
No one will say if Masters might have been using drugs as his life fell apart. Since los­ing re-election in 1998.. he'd abandoned clients, s·eparated from his wife and surrounded himself with drug users, his daughter said. 
Brad Funk, an assistant prosecutor under Masters for more than five years in the 1990s, said his one-time men­tor always "tried to do the right thing. That's why it's so shocking, sickening that David ended up such a lost soul." 
Masters came to Macon in 1990, when then-Gov. John Ashcroft tapped him to be the county's prosecutor. 
Masters was a sharp, organ­ized litigator who devoted full-time hours to the part­time job, and had a private law practice on the side to make ends meet. 
Masters often was in the courthouse readying his eases before dawn, then could be seen at his private practice downtown into the wee hours of some mornings. 
"He was as productive as two or three attorneys put together," says Funk, since 2001 an associate circuit judge in Mercer County. "I never questioned his decency or his integrity or his abilities as an attorney. He was an offi­cer of the court, and he took that very seriously." 
The job took a physical toll on Masters, a Diet Coke-swig­ging diabetic who didn't seem to make his health a priority. 
"Some days he just wouldn't look good, his color wouldn't be good or whatever. He just didn't look rested or healthy," said Judy Roberts, who has run the county's circuit clerk's office for the past 11 years. "I just figured he was working too hard, too many hours." 
Masters and his family lived in one of Macon's best-known homes, the 19th century Wardell Mansion, which was on the National H.egister of Historic Places. 
But after two terms, Masters lost re-election in 1998. lie soon seemed overwhelmed by his work. 
In late 2003, an ex-client was arrested, suspected of setting Masters' law office ablaze. That month, court records show, Masters' wife filed for divorce; they separat­ed but never officially ended the marriage. The historic house became a money pit.

"The European Union should do nothing to contribute," to the possibility that Chinese forces might turn European technolo­gy on Americans, Rice said after meetings with the South Korean president and foreign minister. 
Rice has earlier said that China's recent statements about a possible invasion of Taiwan should give the Europeans pause. China passed a law this month codifying its intention to use military force against Taiwan should the island declare formal independence. 
Rice said she would raise U.S. 

"His life seemed to unravel," Foley says. 
Masters left Macon County for a fresh start around Springfield in southwest Missouri, but he failed to tell dozens of his clients -some already having paid for his services-and his law license was suspended in January 2004. 
Masters fell in with the wrong crowd, by many accounts sinking into a sub­culture of drugs and depres­sion. 
Today, his housemates ­Crystal Broyles, 27, and Thomas Naumann, 49 -and Broyles' sister, 23-year-old Brandi Storment are charged with first-degree murder in his slaying. 
Prosecutors say Storment was at the house and stole some of Masters' possessions but did not inject him with any cocaine. The defendants are scheduled for a prelimi­nary hearing April 1 and are jailed without bail. 
In Macon, gold letters on the glass door of a mostly empty downtown office still read "Law Office of David A. Masters."

KYRGYZSTAN 
Pro-detnocracy riots protnote negotiation 
Associated Press 
BISIIKEK-Thousands of protesters demanding the res­ignation of President Askar Akaynv rampaged through a southern city Sunday amid growing anger over allegedly fraudulent elections in the for­nwr Soviet republic. 
Tlw government said it was ready to rwgotiate, but opposi­tion leader Kurmanbek Bakiy1w said talks would only he possible if the president himself is involvml. 
"All other lownr level negoti­ations will be just a waste of time," Bakiyev said. 
Snveral people were believod to lw injun~d in thn southern dty of .lalai-Ahad, though it was not dear how many. 
l'rolnswrs also oeeupied gov­ernment buildings in other parts_of Kyrgyzstan, accusing the government of rigging par­liamnntary ballots on Feb. 27 and Mard1 I:l that gave Akayev an overwhelrning majority and won placns for his daughter and son in the legislature. 
European countries and the Unitnd Stales also said the polls were seriously flawed, a charge denied by the govern­ment. 
Some analysts have suggest­ed Kyrgyzstan is ripe for an outburst of the mass protests expnrienced by other post­Soviet eounlries, sueh as those that recently brought pro­Wostern leaders to power in Ukrairw and Georgia. 
Akayev, who has led the Central Asian nation sinee it gained independenee after the 1991 Soviet collapse, was regarded as the most reform­minded leader in the region and the country won praise for its comparative openness. 
But Akayev in recent years has shown increasing signs of cracking down. In 2002, his reputation was tarnished after police killed six demonstrators who Wflre protesting the arrest of an opposition lawmaker. 
Tho Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe issued a statnmont Sunday, urging the government and the opposition to rofrain from using force and to begin a dia­logue. 
In Jalal-Abad, stone-throw­ing protosters stormed a police station, causing some officers to takn to tho roof and fire warning shots in the air, regional governmnnt spokns­man Orazaly Karasartov said. He said smoke could be seen rising from the police station and that protesters brokfl win­dows. 
Police estimatnd the number of protesters at 10,000, but local activist Cholpon Ergcshova said 20,000 pnoplo participated. She said the pro­testers ended the attack on the police station after burning down two of its three buildings and forcing all tho officers to nne.. 
Ergesheva also said the pro­testers had occupied thn mayor's office in Jalal-Abad, after the soldiers guarding it had voluntarily vacated it. 
Jalal-Abad govnrnor Jusup Sharipov said tho government did not have nnough police force in the region to restore order right now. 
As the protests have gathered steam, the opposition has demanded Akayev step down. 
"The authorities' decision to use force against people won't bring any good. It will only pro­voke anger," said Bakiyev, 
leader  of  the  opposition  
Pnopl!l's  Movement  of  
Kyrgyzstan.  

Sunday's riot came a day after police forcibly evicted demonstrators from the gover­nor's office in Jalal-Abad and another government building in the city of Osh. More than a dozen people, including three police officers, were injured and more than 200 demonstra­tors were arrested, police and civic activists said. 
Street rallies across the country have also increasingly gained momentum. On Saturday, about 8,000 protest­ed in three cities. 
Atnerican ends 14-year drought 
Associated Press 
SANTA MONICA, Calif. ­Thomas Mayne, the bad boy of architncturfl for years before reaping international acelaim in his mid-50s, was named Sunday as the winner of the Pritzker Prize, the 11eld's most pr!lstigious honor. 
Mayne, 61, is the first American to win thn Pritzker in 14 years. and only the eighth U.S. architect to win in the 27-year history of the contest. 
The jury cited Mayne ~'or crnating a bold architeetural style that reflects the "unique, somewhat rootless, culture of Southern California" through angular lines and an unfinished, open-ended feel. 
"Thorn Mayne is a product of the turbulent 1960s who has carried that rebflllious attitude and fervent desire for change into his practice, the fruits of which are only now becoming visible," the jury wrote. 
For Mayne, winning the Pritzker is vindication for the years he spent struggling to maintain the purity of his unorthodox ideas. llis stand earned him a reputation as 
an  angry young  man  and  
alienated many elients.  
"My  whole  nssencn  was  

attempting to do something I believed in. I didn't under­stand how to negotiate that notion of the private and the public world," he said in an interview at Morphosis, his Santa Monica studio. "Your whole life you're told you're an outsider and you can't do tha~. ~nd then you're honored for It. 
Mayne will be awarded a $100,000 grant and a bronze medallion on May 31 during a ceremony at tho Jay Pritzker Pavilion in Chicago's Millennium Park. Past win­ners of the Pritzker Prize, sponsored by the family that developed the llyatt Hotel chain, include I.M. Pei, Frank Gehry, Renzo Piano and Hem Koolhaas. · 
Firod from a teaching job at California State Polytechnic. Univ11rsity, Pomona, Maynn founded an altnrnativo archi­teeture school called SCI-Arc in IIJ72 with six eollnaguns and 40 students. That ynar, he started Morphosis and two years latnr won his first award for designing a Pasadnna school attended by his SOil. 
For two decades, Mayne worked in rnlativfl obscurity on local houses, rnstaurants and office buildings and a handful of overseas projnets. Then, in the mid-l990s, a sories of convention-bending designs won Mayne his first major international praise. 
lie has sinen won competi­tions and commissions for an array of major public proj­flcts, including the nnw Alaska state capitol, a new acadnrnic building for Thn Cooper Union in New York, and Nnw York's 2012 Olympic Villago, which will be buill even if the city doosn 't get tho games for that year. 

Governtnent data kept private 
Novel excuses multiply for withholding infornzation from public 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The gov­ernment argues that a health official's requimd public finan­cial disclosure reports should not become public. Some of President Bush's military records were not released because officials did not want to search boxes filled with rat excrement. Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge's public schedules were withheld until he left office. 
Those roadblocks to obtain­ing government data arose in response to requests during the past year by The Associated Press. In recent years, the AP and other regu­lar users of the Freedom of Information Act have been presented with a growing list of never-before-seen excuses for denying the public release of government documents. 
"It's become much, much harder to get responses to FOIA requests, and it's taking much, much longer," said David A. Schulz, the attorney who helps the AP with FOIA requests. "Agencies seem to view their role as coming up with techniques to keep infor­mation secret rather than the other way around. That's com­pletely contrary to the goal of the act." 
It has taken administrative appeals or lawsuits to over­come some obstacles, but not before requesters had to wait -sometimes until the infor­mation sought was no longer useful -and often had to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars for lawyers. 
Other times, ordinary citi­zens were thwarted because they lacked time or money.

Whether journalists, advoca­cy groups or private citizens make thn reqm1sts, the ulti­mato loser is the public, which learns less about its govern­ment, say those who have fought the fights. 
Steve Hendricks, a Montana resident writing a book about tumultuous relations between American Indians and thfl gov­ernment in the 1970s, said he could never afford an expnn­sive legal battle. He said he was fortunate that his wife, an FOIA lawyer, could wage his battle against the FBI to uncover documents the agency at first said did not exist. 
Bush administration officials acknowledge reining in the policies of earlier administra­tions to protect privacy and national security, particularly after the Sept. 11 attacks. 
"We were more attuned to privacy concerns, as Wflll as the security matters, than prior to this administration eoming in," said Mark Corallo, who just retired as the Justice Dopartment's spokesman. 
Corallo said the department relied on recommendations of carenr exports to handle infor­mation release requests. llo said that nlsnwhere "perhaps the bureaucracy took advan­tage of the national security imperative at times to with­hold non-national socurity stuIT."

tnanston auctioned 
Unknown buyer pays $4 million for castle 
Associated Press 

DENVEH -A historic castle 
where John D. Hockefeller and 
Theodore Hoosevelt were guests 
-and where a coal baron's ghost 
is said to haunt the halls -was 
auctioned for $4 million Saturday, 
two years after the ms seized the 
century-old mansion in a fraud 
investigation. 

A Pasadena, Calif., man made 
the winning bid, said John 
Harrison, an IHS special agent. 
The unidentified buyer declined to 
talk with reporters. 

"I had a brief moment to meet 
him, and I think he's going to be a . real asset to the Hedstone com­munity," said .Walter Stanaszek, a University of Oklahoma professor who had the winning bid for a nearby Victorian home. ''I'm just excited to say I have a neighbor 
that owns a castle." 

lHS agents seized the 42-room 
Redstone Castle in the mountains 
near Aspen in March 2003 while 
investigating an international 
Ponzi investment scheme. They 
also seized about $17 million in 
cash from bank accounts and 
race cars worth $2 million. 

The castle's previous owner, 
Leon Harte, was being investigat­
ed before he died in 2003. Court 
documents said Harte and others 
had formed three companies to 
buy the castle and the Victorian 
home for $6 million five years 
ago. 

Investigators say about 1 ,000 
people were bilked of a total of 
$56 million on the promise of 400 
percent investment returns. A 
grand jury indicted seven people 
last year and trial proceedings are 
scheduled for September. 

Proceeds from the auction will 
help reimburse victims, Harrison 
said. 

The sale was the latest twist in 
the castle's almost epic past. 

Teddy Hoosevelt stayed at the 
estate during a hunting trip after 
he left the White I louse; oil tycoon 
John D. Hockefeller did, too. 

But it was nearly abandoned 
after a mining bust, and some say 
the cigar-smoking ghost of its 
builder, coal baron John 
Cleveland Osgood -who died in 
the castle he named Cleveholm 
Manor-still haunts the place. 

The castle, filled with antiques 
and surrounded by a carriage 
house, barn and other outbuild­
ings in the Crystal River Valley 
about 1 70 miles west of Denver, 
was finished in 1902 at a price of 
$2.5 million-an astonishing 
sum at the time. 

It was erected on a mountain­
side overlooking the coal-mining 
town Osgood built for his employ­
ees. 

"It's kind of likn a medieval 
manor. The castle was about an 
aristocratic mile away from the 
village," said Darrell Munsell, 
president of the Hedstone 
llistorical Society. . "It demonstrates Osgood's phi­losophy or industrial paternalism. Osgood believed that his employ­ees should be contented, satisfied workers," said Munsell, who is writing a book about Osgood's labor policies. "lie thought if they were satislied with their condi­tions, they wouldn't join the union, and he would be rewarded with more production and less labor strife."

A Mississippi native with a 
master's  degree  from

other areas, too.  

He became the country's first black billionaire after BET's sale for $3 billion nearly five years ago. lie is the first black owner of a major sports team, the NBA's first-year Charlotte Bobcats, which Johnson named after himself. 
A lifelong sports fan, Johnson was a partner in the effort to return baseball to the nation's capital, but he pulled 
pline for U.S. Olympic athletes. 
Davis, whose committee sub­poenaed current and former stars and baseball executives to testify Thursday, said he's willing to wait and see how Major League Baseball handles drug testing and punishment in 2005. 
"They've got this season. We'll see how they respond when they find someone testing positive," Davis told CBS. 
Asked about possible govern­ment intervention, baseball's executive vice president for labor relations, Rob Manfred. told CBS, "Commissioner Selig said unequivocally in the hearing

that if Congress decides that fed­eral legislation is appropriate, that he would be supportive." 
In March 2004, McCain's Senate Commerce Committee held a hearing on steroids in baseball, pressure that helped lead to the drug-testing plan that owners and players agreed to in January. 
Several lawmakers were criti­cal of two provisions in that agreement: one that allows play­ers to be fined instead of sus­pended for failing a drug test, and another that calls for testing to be suspended if there's a gov­ernment investigation. 
President to sever ties, focus on NBA team 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -Hobert Johnson and Black Entertainment Television are known for one thing: each other. Soon. they could go their separate ways after a prof­itable 25-year relationship. 
Johnson is busy with other projects, including his losing NBA franchise in Charlotte, N.C., while the deal that let him stay on as BET's chief executive after he sold the net­work in 2000 expires this year. 
Stepping down at BET would give Johnson more time to pursue his varied interests. 
A divorced father of two, Democratic Party donor and consummate schmoozer who counts former President Clinton among his friends, Johnson set his sights high early on. 
Not taken seriously when he first talked about serving a then-untapped market, Johnson was 34 when he launched BET -which is cele­brating its silver anniversary this year -from the basement of his Washington home in January 1980. 
It is the country's first and largest black-oriented cable network, and has proved an unmatched success.

Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -Saying Major League Baseball "can't be trusted," Sen. John McCain warned Sunday that legislation might be needed to force the sport to change its steroids poli­cy. 
The Arizona Republican joined the chorus of congressmen expressing disappointment with baseball's drug-testing plan after testimony from commissioner Bud Selig and union head Donald Fehr at the House Government Reform Committee hearing on steroids Thursday. 

"It just seems to me they can't be trusted," McCain told ABC's 'This Week." 
"What do we need to do? It seems to me that we ought to seriously consider ... a law that says all professional sports have a minimum level of perform­ance-enhancing drug testing," McCain said. 
Committee chairman Tom Davis, H-Va., said on CBS' "Face the Nation" that he agreed with McCain's suggestion that the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency could be called in to govern baseball's testing. The independent agency oversees drug testing and disci­Monday, March 21, 2005

VATICAN CITY 
St. Peter's garners thousands at lllass 
Pilgrims flood square for Holy Week service 
Associated Press 
V/\TIC/\N CITY -Tens of thousands of pilgrims lillnd St. Peter's Square for Palm Sunday Mass, hoping for an appearance by ailing Pope John Paul II, who was unabln to preside at the ceremony that ushers in Holy WnPk for the first time in his 26-year papa­cy. 
Cardinal Camillo Huini, thn pope's viear for Home, led tho service, but the Vatican said John Paul might make a brief appearance. !lis third-floor window above the square remained open, with thn red papal banner outside. 
!\ long line of cardinals, bish­ops and priests holding olivn branches and palm ~onds walked into the square in pro­cession at the start of thn Mass. 
Potted olive trees surrounded the obelisk at the center of the square, and row after row of gray plastic chairs were lined up for the Mass, which com­memorates Christ's triumphant entry into Jerusalem. 
"We eertainly hopn to see the pope," said /\nna Prati, bring­ing her visiting sister from Turin to the square. "lin likes to surprise." 
John Paul, who was dis­charged from the hospital last Sunday, has long presided over the ceremony marking the start of the most important week in the Homan Catholic liturgical year and whieh has been one of this pope's favoritn appointments. 
"It will be an unusual opnn­ing, that of Holy Wonk" without the pope at Palm Sunday Mass, Vatican Hadio commented. 
In his homily, Huini spoke of' Christ's ordeal and the "drama and mystery" of suffering and its meaning for humanity. The Italian cardinal said Christ's cross brings "new energies" and "shines with spoeial clarity on the weary face of' the Holy Father." 
The pope is officially conva­lescing at the Vatican after Feb. 24 throat surgery to insert a tube in his windpipe and ease his second breathing cri­sis in less than a month.

I need a.. hero 
This past week, I couldn't help but think back to that classic "Liar, Liar" scene in which a desperate Jim Carrey is dragged out of a courtroom scream­ing, "But I'm Jose Canseco! I'm Jose Canseco!" Yes, even 
Joey

though recent events 
Falco
might lead one to believe otherwise, 

there actually was a Forty Ounces to time when emulating Falco Jose Canseco was the cool thing to do. After all, at least in some respects, he was a hero. 
Not only did he and fellow "Bash Brother" Mark McGwire lead the Oakland Athletics to three consecutive World Series appearances as a notori­ous tag team of home run hitters, but posters featuring the two hulks posing with their biceps flexed also dotted the bedroom walls of Little Leaguers all across America, myself included. Without fail, throughout most of the early '90s, if my eyes were not glued to the television screen watching the com­paratively lackluster New York Yankees and my own personal uber-hero, Don Mattingly, you could bet that I was run­ning around my living room swinging a yellow plastic wiffle ball bat in the hopes of hitting an unlucky household object with the force of a Bash Brother grand slam. Oh, those were the days. 
Granted, it was a lot easier to find a hero in the sports world back when we were growing up. The multi-million dollar advertising deals that tend to go to the heads of today's top athletes really only emerged on the scene after the Michael Jordan era, so the holier­than-thou attitudes of a Barry Bonds or a Kobe Bryant were typically never an issue. Professional athletes were blessed with unthinkable God-given tal­ents, and they never felt the need to appear on ESPN telling us exactly how much better than us they really were, and we loved and respected them for that. Life was good. 
Speaking of everyone's favorite Los 
II' 

Angeles Laker, the typical American sports fan also never had to worry about their heroes showing up on tele­vision defending themselves against charges of rape (Bryant), assault (Ron Artest), murder (O.J. Simpson, Jayson Williams), steroid use (Canseco, McGwire, Sammy Sosa, et. al.) or drug use (Ricky Williams, the entire NBA). Rape, murder and drugs, after all, only existed in AI Pacino movies. I'm pretty sure the only guy I knew growing up who used performance-enhancing steroids was the gargantuan Hussian boxer in "Hocky IV." 
Professional sports were simply an arena for the best Little League ath­letes who became the best high school athletes who later were the best college athletes to have the honor of playing the games they loved more than any­thing in front of millions of hot dog-eat­ing fans. It was a natural progression to greatness that every little boy want­ed to take, and steroids, felonies and ego trips simply were not a part of the picture. That was, of course, until something went terribly wrong, and those heroes on our posters, trading cards and cereal boxes ended up in our courtrooms, prison cells and congres­sional hearings. 
Switching gears for a second, I should also note that professional athletes were not the only heroes and role mod­els who provided the driving force behind much of the child development of America. There were the billionaire inventors turned businessmen -men like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs-who certainly inspired many of my more financially-savvy peers with imaginings of inconceivable wealth and fame. 
There were the beautiful and talent­ed heroes of Hollywood -stars like the gorgeous Julia Roberts and the incom­parably-cool Sean Connery -who motivated would-be actors and actress­es to stick with their pipe dreams of cinematic success. 
There were the legendary and inspi­rational political heroes of history ­great leaders like Presients George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Delano Hoosevelt -who helped direct the futures of budding politicians. Generally speaking, no mat­ter whom you were and what you wanted to do with your life, there was always a hero out there to help drive you to turn your dreams into realities. 
Cue Canseco and his 304-page piece of literary lilth, "Juiced," and the steroid scandal in Major League Baseball found itself reignited. Cue Enron and WorldCom and the business world became a bastion of greed, scan­dal and corruption. Cue Paris Hilton, Pamela Anderson and Hobert Blake, who forced Hollywood to begin to look more like a hedonistic sin bin than the euphoric Shangri-La profiled in "Lifestyles of the Hich and Famous." Cue President Bill Clinton's oral office and President George W. Bush's neo­conservative imperialism, and even the presidency lost its luster as the head of state, commander in chief and hero of heroes for the free world. 
As a result, we have reached a cross­roads in American society in which our youth are now faced with a dangerous hero dilemma. They can either set their sights on a future as a thug (50 Cent), a an alleged rapist (Bryant), a loose star (Lindsay Lohan), a thief (Kenneth Lay) or a Hepublican (see all), or they can set off on their difficult journeys into the gloomy caves of adulthood without heroes by their sides to light the way to success. Call me pessimistic, but I just don't think they're going to make it. 
Not without their heroes. Not without their Jose Cansecos.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Symposium on women in war biased 
I find tlw Iwad lirw from tlw March I R issun of Thn Ohsnrvnr, "Symposium to dd>atn wonwn in baltlns," about Saint Mary's upcoming "Womnn, War, and l'naen: FIHninisllnlnrvnnl.ions in a Tinw of Conlliet" symposium vory disingenuous, as no dnhatn Pxists in this program. Hatlwr, it is a propaganda nfTorl against tlw wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and tho lsnwli "o('.cupalion" of l'alnslinn. 
I would nvnn dnscrilw some of the SJwaknrs fnaturnd as anli-Sf1milic. For nxampln, pont Lisa Suhair Majaj wrote a pomn -found at www.f'nministpmu:f1nnt­work.org-honoring "martyr" Hachnl Corrin, who was "killnd by an lsraoli bull­doznr whiln trying to prnvnnt the domoli­tion of a l'alnstinian family's house." lmagnry in this poPm evoked Tianannwn Squarn and thn studnnls dmnonstraling for dnmocraey and frnndorn in 19H9. 
Hadwl Corrin had nothing in common with thosn studnnl demonstrators, thou­sands of whom were killed or imprisoned for voicing tlwir support for democracy an£! fn~mlom. Corrie, contrary to thn imagnry nvoknd in Majaj's poem, was killed while slw was attempting to impedf1 an lsranli bulldoznr knocking down the honws of Palestinian terrorists and build­ings hiding tunnnls through which illegal wnapons wnrn bning smuggled through by tPrrorists. 
Additionally, Corrin was a mnrnbnr of tlw lnlnrnational Solidarity Movement, a lnrrorisl organization which urges armed uprising against lsralll. While Corrie did not ask to din in this accident, neitlwr did thn hundrnds of truly innocent Israelis murdnrnd by l'alnstinian terrorists in tho suicidn bombings of recent yflars, which arn terrorist attacks akin to our Sept. 11, 2001. 
Another work of Majaj, an essay found at www.afsc.org, accuses Israelis of viola­tions of the Gmwva Accords. In a region openly hostile to its very oxistm1ee, Israel has for rwarly 60 years been a bnacon or hopn, democraey and freedom while also acting as an inspiration to millions around the world. Its citizens have been victim­ized by terrorist attacks on an unpreee­denlml seale for decades. Israel never laundws military action unprovoked, it nnver deliberately targets civilians, and it has never lacked accountability when tragedy strikes. Accusing Israel of violat­ing the Gnneva Accords plays right into tlw tnrrorists' playbook. 
Perhaps the organizers or this forum ­and the other speakers on the agenda ­missed tho free and fair elections recently conducted in Afghanistan, Iraq and among the Palestinians. 
Perhaps the organizers missed the pur­pin fingers of Iraqis lifted sky-high into the air after voting for the first lime in their livns. 
Was anyone supportive of' the Afghan and Iraqi wars invited to respond to what looks like a very biasnd, one-sided pro­gram'? 
I fear that acadnmie discussion is bning sliflnd beforn it even begins if feminism is only defined in an anli-Unitnd States, anti-Israel and anti-democratic frame­work. 
While I am very proud of my degree from Saint Mary's, I am very disappointed in my school for sponsoring this sympo­sium.

Congress should not have expected players to nam_e nam.es

Thursday.  Staff  
Tho House  Editorial  
Government Hef'orm  
Committen had eallod  Ball State  
on them to eome elean about the use of steroids in basnball. It  UniversityThe Daily News  

was nationally telovised on ESPN and highly promoted by thn media. Was this going to bn the day that the big bomb fell on MLB and busted all those rneords from the "Steroid Era'?" 
In a packed hearing room, with cam­eras shoved in their facos, Joso Canseeo, Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire, Haf'ael Palmero and Curt Schilling looked straight ahead and said, well, nothing nnw. 
No namns were namnd, and no player admitted to having over used steroids nxenpl for Canseco, who has dono so previously on a number or oeeasions. 
Congress was hoping to shed some light on the issue of' steroids, and what it got was a handful or baseball's brightosl stars from tho past two decades zipping thflir lips. 
This should have all been expected though. The hearing took place in front of a very eritieal public nye, and Congress 
offered no immunity to any of the play­ers. 
Admitting to using steroids in this set­ling, under these circumstances left players with nothing to gain and every­thing to lose. 
As MeGwire, who refused to answer a number of times whether he had used steroids, said, "If a player answers, 'No,' he simply will not be believed. If he answers, 'Yes,' he risks public scorn and endless government investiga­tions." 
With that in mind, it would be ridicu­lous for Congress to believe that these l'ive players, three of whom are still active, could possibly be candid on such a sensitive issue. 
Any steroid mess in baseball, which would not be surprising, needs to be eleaned up, one way or another. But Congress needs to realize that using intimidation and pressure are probably not tho most effective taeties in this sit­uation. 
If Congress pushes on in this manner, it will fail to go deep into the issue and continue to strike out.

I have never been a particularly rnligious person. My inquisitive nature and gnneral obstinacy have always made it dillicult for me to follow rigid doctrine or trust in 
blind l:aith. . Sowmya 
Orgamzed reb-Krishnamurth gion is often con­tradictory, archa­University of ic and divisive, Michigan and those who Michigan Daily preach the loud­est from the pulpit arn often the most hypocritical and corrupt. So I've always adhered to a homemade dogma of being a good person and worshiping whatever God(s) exist in my own personal way. I feel that others have the freedom to vennr­ate or not venerate, whatever the ease may be, as they deem appro­priate. 
Because of our nation's long­standing tradition of separating the church from the state, Americans have been able to practice this "live and let live" mentality for over two centuries. But now a pair of U.S. Supreme Court eases threaten to destroy that very sacred freedom. 
In one ease, two Kentucky execu­tives posted the Ten Commandments on courthouse walls, while in the other ease, Thomas Van Orden filed suit against the placement of a 6-foot­tall monument of the Ten Commandments on the grounds of the Texas state capitol building bearing a symbol representing Jesus Christ with the words "I am the Lord thy God." 
The Bush administration and 26 state attorneys general have, to no surprise, filed a brief supporting the Texas and Kentucky Decalogue dis­plays. 
The ostensibly landmark eases could rewrite precedent on whether the commandments and similar religious symbols that dot public spheres are a federal endorsement of religion or simply a reflection of the Judeo-Christian influence in 
U.S. history. There is nothing explicit in our Constitution that demarks a separation between church and state, but pro­Separatists have long read the First Amendment's "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ... " as a govern­montallaissez-faire over religion. 
Despite federal regulations against overt religious pageantry, the majority of Americans are at least nominally Christian. Consequently, our country has always had a long-standing tradi­tion of civic faith: The proverbial "In God We Trust" monetary seal, holiday songs performed in public schools during Christmas, the Pledge of Allegiance and the Supreme Court f'reseo of Moses. Furthnrmorn, according to a recent CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll. U1 pnr­cont of Americans support tho dis­play of the Ten Commandments in courthouses. 
There is nothing fundamentally wrong with intermingling devotion into public life if such action can invoke the betterment of sodety through tolerance, personal disd­pline and saerilke and kindness toward others. And given the pres­ent tenuous staln of Ameriea's social fabric-malaises like vio­lence and materialism abound ­increased spirituality doesn't semn all that bad of an idea. If displaying the Ten Commandments could dHerease the national divorce rate or mend broken homes, I would wholeheartedly support it. But real­istically speaking, little will actually change-religious imagery is meaningless without soeietal rein­forcement, and we arn far too over the edge to be salvaged by a few slabs of stone. 
What is more detrimental than propagation of the status quo is tho invidious distinction that will undoubtedly result betwmm the religious majority and minority. Permitting the Decalogue in public areas theorotieally moans that opposing devotional material can be publicly viewnd too. Yet given the faet that most religions are at odds with one another, what is thn liknli­hood that alternative faiths will be accepted in an overwhelmingly Judeo-Christian country'? Most pno­ple in this nation do not even acknowledge that anything exists outside the so-callnd "Big 3" reli­gions-Christianity, Judaism and Islam (Islam only because of the obsessive fear after Sept. 11 ). Ignorance is usually not condudvn to liberalism, so I wonder how gung ho such individuals would be seeing a picture of Lord Krishna hanging in their post ollieo or a 6-foot bronze statue of a laughing Buddha on the White House lawn. 
I have a hunch thi1y would not be too pleasnd. 
Only when, if ever, we get to that point of universal acceptance of' every faith is it fnasible to conceive blurring the line between church and the government. Untilthnn, religion should be kept a personal matter away from the public sphere and out of the courts.

CONCERT REVIEW 

Ladysmith Black Mambazo is 
still mesmerizing 

By MARIA SMITH Senior SraffWrirer 

Not many groups out there have been touring as long as Ladysmith Black Mambazo, and it shows. 
The singer-dancers in the group took the stage so comfortably you would think there wasn't a huge crowd of people watching them. And yet there were near­ly 1000 mesmerized spectators at the show. 
Mambazo is a cultural icon, and their music is technically excellent, but even beyond that their performance is simply infectious. Mambazo has a goofy stage presence that promptly breaks down any barrier that might stand between a world-renowned group and its audience. Being able to clown around onstage is a mark of a natural performer, and Mambazo catches its audience by doing exactly that. 
Mambazo's performance was certainly not silly. Several songs related to political and other important issues from the group's native South Africa. The group performed "Homeless," its most famous hit ballad from Paul Simon's "Graceland" album, which despite its tranquil sound is about a dark time in South African his­tory. 
And yet there remained a sense that just as South Africa's history couldn't keep Mambazo from worldwide fame, neither could it keep the singers from enjoying their music. Some lines of the songs were beau-tifully poignant, but overall the show was joyful. 
Some of the performers in Mambazo have retired and been replaced over the years -four of founder Joseph Shabalala's sons have notably begun to sing with the group -bui some have been singing for decades. Shabalala and several others rank right up there with Bono for staying in amazing physical shape throughout a career. All eight per­formers danced and kicked their feet up through entire numbers and barely broke a sweat. Few men Shabalala's age would have the urge, or the capability, to dance and jump right alongside their sons onstage. 
Mambazo recently won a Grammy Award for their release "Haise Your Spirit Higher," proving that as members have come and gone, the quality of the group's music has not decreased. Mambazo sings with the same tight, smooth harmonies that brought them to world attention 30 years ago. 
Mambazo also released an album with the English Chamber Orchestra in 2005. While the recording is as excellent as all of Mambazo's crossover work, this per­formance was proof that the group's music needs nothing else to back it up.

The strong bass, and the distinct tone of Shabalala's tenor, might sound strange to American ears at first, but it doesn't take long to realize that these singers are masters of a capella harmony and per­formance. The way Mambazo's music started may still be its best face. 
Mambazo's universal appeal is obvious -their music, and their shtick onstage, is the kind that can appeal to anyone of any age. Forty years on the road have not slowed the group down, and if Sunday night's performance is any kind of evidence, they won't stop touring any­time soon. Mambazo's recordings are excellent, but seeing the group live shows an entirely different face of their per­formance style. Anyone who had the chance to get this first-hand feel for the singers of Ladysmith Black Mambazo was lucky to catch the group in action.

THEATRE REVIEW 
'Angels in Amefica' full of emotions and laughs 
Hy CHRISTIE BOLSEN Assiswnt Scene Editor 
!\ l l he begi n IIi n g 0 r part Tw0 0 r "1\ngnls in 1\nwrica," a character whoso husband left her wanders around in a mystilind daze. 
"Wiwn your lwart breaks, you should din," she says. 
This lirw captures tho app<~al of Tony Kush rw r 's two-part "!\ n g n Is in 1\nwriea." The St. l:dward's llall Playnrs performed thn sncond part last weekend as a staged reading. Even if the audi­enen can't nxaetly identify with an apparnntly insane woman, or· any of the otlwr quirky eharaetnrs, the tlwmcs rnach out to nvnry p<~rson who has nvnr fnlt brokenlwart<~d. hopeful, angry, eon­rusml or bdrayml. 
"Part Two: Perestroika" was pnr­formed Saturday and Sunday in tho Washington llall l.ah Theatre as a bene­lit; "Part One: Millennium 1\pproadws" was perrormnd last semester. Admission was froe, but donations worn collected at tlw door for tho 1\moriean Foundation for !\IDS rnseareh. Tho Pulitzer Prizo­winning play addresses many issues that spark controversy on this campus -homosexuality, religion, polities, racism and morn. 
J·:al'h part of "1\ngels in 1\mnrica" is long enough and eomprelwnsive enough to stand alone, tackling thnso difTieult issuns freely and with plnnty or sexuali­ty. profanity and hysterically funny ono­lirwrs and scenns. Last somnstnr's pro­dudion introduced the east of eomplox <·haractnrs, who interact during the Hnagan prnsidnncy as !\IDS spreads in 1\nwriea. 
Prior Walter (1\ndre Valdivia) has 1\II>S-and as if he doesn't have nnough stress, hn is chosen by angels to 
be a prophet. Hoy Cohn (Scott Wagner), based on the actual attorney who became famous f'or high-profile anti­communist cases and celebrity clients, also has !\IDS but is in denial. Belize (Mark Hoss), a gay black nurse, provides comie relinf as well as a voice or reason and truth; Joe (!\dam Bonosky), a gay Mormon man who is married to llarper (Lnna Caligiuri), struggles with his homosexuality throughout tho play. 
Caligiuri saw hnr character, with all of hor oddities, as representing any man who makes no apologies for being homosexual, black or a nurse. 
llis altitude contrasts nieely with another of the best-played characters, the hateful yet hysterically funny Hoy. Hoy's offensive tirades keep up despite Belize's attempt to give him advice on his treatmnnt, so Hoy asks him why lw should listen to him instead of his WASP doctor. 
"lie's not queer, I am," Belize says.

Jon's mother, llannah (Ellen Kennedy), is more compassionate than most of the crowd, although she claims not to fncl pity. Louis (Joe Garlock), who left Prior out of fnar of his !\IDS, helps the uncom­fortable Joe accept his sexuality. Through it all, Cricket Slattery as the 1\ngel America haunts Prior about being a prophet. 
Tho actors' portrayals of these pas­sionate characters are what make the lengthy production worth a viewing. Prior and Belize, even with the tragedy of all tho dying in their lives, are con­stantly hilarious -espncially Belize. lie's the stereotypieal flamboyant gay

The seript is full or heartbreak, but also makes room for forgiveness and hope. Prior and Harper epitomize tho phenomnnon of not being able to move forward from unrequited lovn. lingering instead in the past and what went wrong. When Louis and Joe make "Swingers" -like reappearances, though, their rejected lovers must rnevaluato the one thing they've been wanting for so long. 
Dealing with sueh weighty issues for three hours could have been quite draining, so the lighter moments were refreshing. One or the funniest seenes was when Prior and Bnlize decide to confront .Joe at tho l:ourthousn where he works, as Prior snaps, "I have a hobby now!

''I'm trapped in a world of white (WO­ple, that's my problnm," BPlizn laments.

Novel highlights hilarious shopping antics 
By SARAH YAHULAS Scene Critic 
"Confessions or a Shopaholic" is the pnrl'nd gntaway. Tho lirst two pages of Sophin Kinsella's high-energy novel are tlw hook as the roader is immediately dmwn into the dnvnloping plot. 
Thn hook's main thomn is just what the covn r suggests -"going broke the haunting bills, letters and phone calls, Becky spends enormous amounts or money on a daily basis for things she bnlieves are necessities. llownver; in any other person's mind, her buying habits arn highly unhealthy and unnec­essary." But she continues and finds great joy in doing so. 
Beeky works as a 11naneial journalist in downtown London and lives in a

She <~an hn quite crnative, and hnr actions are simply so absurd that she makes you laugh until you cry. 
The problem with Beeky is that she's a shopaholie. She can't makn herself stop buying the most frivolous things, no matter how hard she tries. Despite closet full of the 
season's chicest 
fashions. 
Healizing she is in trouble, Bocky lirst attempts to cut baek her addiction by purchasing a book called "Controlling Your Cash," by David E. Barton. llcr efforts to see her pitfalls and what she spends money on are quite hilarious. Every page was full or laughter detail­ing how Becky manages to dig herself deeper into debt. 
Beeky then attempts to make more money by getting another job and by making crafts out of her own home. But both or these only provide more trouble for Becky. She certainly has a knack for getting in tight spots. When something goes wrong for Becky, she turns to shopping to feel better. This does not help her financial situation, but she feels it eases her emotions. 1\nd that's the important thing for her. 
Finally, after her spit of bad luck, Becky actually finds a story that offers her some interest. llcr neighbors are in trouble, and she wants to help them. !\!though she is not eon­fident in her skills as a reporter, she gives it her best shot. Littln docs she know the events to follow will ehange her life forever -both socially and financially. 
Kinsella is a former financial journalist and the author or the four bestselling "Shopaholie" novels, in addition to her stand-alone New York Times bestseller, "Can you keep a Secret?"

MEN'S lACROSSE 

Karwick leads Irish to 22-6 pounding of Butler 
Midfielder comes up one point short of tying school record 
By BOBBY GRIFFIN Associate Sports Editor 
Even for Notre Dame's most loyal fans, the sound of the fight song became a bit repet­itive Saturday afternoon. 
With the music blaring after each Notre Dame goal, the Irish crushed Butler 22-6 to improve to 3-1 on the season. 
It was Notre Dame's first league game of the season, and a good start for the Irish, who were coming off a close win over North Carolina. 
Matt Karwick had eight points for Notre Dame, five goals and three assists, high­lighting the team's offensive dominance. 
The school record for most points in a game is nine. 
Pat Walsh had six points, three goals and three assists, and now has eight goals on the season. 
Jim Morrison also scored three goals for the Irish for the fourth consecutive time this season. 
Irish coach Kevin Corrigan was happy with his team's performance, even though the level of competition was clearly not the same as Notre Dame's previous opponents this season -Penn State, Cornell and North Carolina. 

"[Butler] had an overtime game on Wednesday night and I think they must have left a little bit on .t-he field there, because we were able to get on them," Corrigan said. "We thought coming into the game that it was going to be impor­tant to get a lead on them. They wanted to play a little bit slower and a little bit more deliberately, and they can't control that tempo if they are down." 
That's exactly what Notre Dame did, getting out to a 12­0 lead before Butler scored their first goal. 
"I thought that certainly the key to the game is getting that quick early lead and then forcing them to play our tempo which we were a lot more comfortable with than they are," Corrigan said. 
Notre Dame was able to control much of the clock, keeping the ball on offense and in the Butler zone. 
"Our face off guys did a great job, our ground ball play was very sharp, and those are the possessions that are up for grab," Corrigan said. "We got the vast majori­ty of those early ... it was hard for them to get settled in, 
"I think it went from 1-0 to 4-0 before they got another possession." 
In fact, Butler did not score until 5:09 remained in the second period, when Kyle Tietjen put home his third goal of the season. 
Notre Dame's scoring came quickly and often, allowing Corrigan to play some of his other players in larger amounts later in the game. 

"Its certainly one game that were thrilled with and espe­cially happy that a bunch 'of guys who have been working extremely hard in practice and doing a great job got to play a lot of minutes today 
and did very well with it," 

Corrigan said.  
Notre Dame will take  on  
Hofstra  this  weekend  in  
Hempstead, N.Y.  

The game is scheduled for 
1:30 p.m. Saturday.

The hits keep on coming for the Irish. 
Even poor weather could not cool down the Notre Dame softball team's red-hot bats. The Irish outhit opponents 28 to 12 in three games. 
The Irish are coming off a spring break trip in which they went 6-1 and captured the Hawaii Invitational Tournament. Notre Dame went 2-1 in this weekend's Buckeye Invitational Tournament in Columbus, Ohio, after having their first game cancelled against host­ing Ohio State. 
"The weather has no effect, we are used to bad weather, it should never be a problem," Irish coach Deanna Gumpf said. 
The Irish beat the Eastern Michigan Eagles 4-1 in their third game late Sunday after­noon. The team was carried in part by the efforts of pitcher Heather Booth, who allowed only two hits in seven innings, and senior Liz Hartmann, who went 3-4 with 3 RBI in the tournament's final game.

"In some things I'm better and in some things she's better, as a captain, so we kind of share it," Kryczalo said of her teammate. "We just cooperate very well together." 
Sunday, Zagunis and Orlando joined Kryczalo in the finals, marking only the second time that 3 women from the same team have made the champi­onship bout in all three disci­plines in the same year, the only other time being when the Irish did it in 2004. 
Over the course of the year, the six had formed an identity as a unit. 
"I think we work really well together, and we're all very strong fencers" Zagunis said. 
In part because of this, the largest aim for any of them seemed to be winning the team goal. 
"My job was to win bouts, and I won as many bouts as I could [for the team]," Zagunis said. 
Those staying on after this year feel somewhat bittersweet, as they will be saying goodbye to three of their close teammates.

ND WOMEN'S TRACK 
Erigha leads Irish at Williains Invitational 

By RYAN KEIFER Sports Writer 
The Irish enjoyed warm weather and fast times at the Willie Williams Invitational, their first outdoor track meet in Tucson, Ariz. this weekend. 
Notre Dame sent a limited number of athletes to Arizona, mostly sprinters and hurdlers, but was able to score five top­three Ilnishes and qualify one athlete for the NCAA regional meet. 
Maryann Erigha was the star of the meet for Notre Dame as she notched the lone victory for the Irish in the 200 meters and also finished fourth in the 100 meters. Her time in the 200 earned her a place in the NCAA regional meet, while her time in the 100 left her just one tenth of a second short of the qualify­ing mark. 
Sophomore Okechi Ogbuokiri also ran well, finishing second in the 400 meters and eighth in the 200. Freshman Dominique Manning showed promise in her outdoor debut, finishing fourth in the 100-meter hurdles and running on the fourth place 4-by-100 team, which also fea­tured Erigha, Brienne Davis and Crysta Swayzer. 
Petra Dankova and Cassie Gullickson highlighted the field events for the Irish. Dankova finished third in the triple jump and long jump competitions, and Gullickson finished second in the high jump. 
Notre Dame's goals entering this meet were to get some of its younger athletes experience, affording them as many oppor­tunities as possible to qualify for the NCAA regionals. The Irish showed promise in this area, as the athletes showed their ability to adapt to the warm, dry conditions in the desert. 
The outdoor portion of the schedule also brings a different NCAA qualification process. Indoors, athletes must hit an automatic qualification mark to be guaranteed a spot in the NCAA field. After that, the NCAA selects a number of ath­letes from each event among a pool who have earned a lesser, provisional standard. 
This number varies from year to year and can leave athletes in limbo as to whether they have qualified for the champi­onships. 
Outdoors, athletes strive for one mark, which earns them a place in the NCAA regional where two athletes from each event advance to the champi­onships. 
Coach Tim Connelly feels the outdoor process favors his ath­letes. 
"It's so much clearer out­doors. The athletes know exact­ly what they have to do. We just have to get them to a point where they can achieve these times," Connelly said last week. 
The Irish will continue their quest for qualification times next weekend with two meets, one at Baylor University and one at Stanford University.

MEN'S TRACK 

Team begins outdoor season 
By NATHAN DYER Sports Writer 

The Irish kicked off their outdoor season over the week­end, sending a contingent of athletes to Tucson, Ariz., at the Willie Williams Invitational at the University of Arizona. 
The Irish sent 26 men's and women's competitors t.o the event, which was held at Roy 
P. Drachman Track and Field Stadium. 
While it was the women who stole the show -namely sophomore sprinter Maryann Erigha, who ran a personal­best and NCAA Hegional quali­fying time of 23.70 seconds on her way to victory in the 200­meter dash -the men's team also left its mark in the desert. 
Competing in mostly field events in this non-scoring meet, as opposed to the women who sent more run­ners, the men's team was led by junior Chris Staron, who claimed fifth place overall with a clearance of 1.95 meters 
Teammate Chris Jacques came in at ninth, with a leap of 1. 90 meters 
Staron, who finished in third in the Big East Indoor Championships, said this meet was a good warm-up to begin the outdoor season. 
"[It was a nice way to] work the kinks out and hopefully set myself up for some better fin­ishes later in the season," Staron said. 
Not satisfied with his finish in the indoor season, Staron was hopeful that the out-and hopes to garner such accolades during the outdoor season. 
Senior thrower Chip Roberts came in seventh in the ham­mer throw with a throw of 
48.13 meters, and teammate Caret Koxlein finished right behind Hoberts in eighth place with a throw of 46.41 meters.

Saracino said he was impressed with the coaehes' desire to learn the recruit­ing process from the alter­native perspective of an admissions director. 
Weis said he and his assis­tants understand the guide­lines Saracino has laid before them. 
"I think lthel admissions [department! is on tho same page with athletics here and vice versa," Weis said. "I think that not every athlete that comes to Notre Dame has to have a 1350 on their SATs, but it's niee if some of' them do. I think from the president right through the admissions office, there's some give and take there, but I think it's important that you try to get those guys, realizing that not everyone has that." 
Weis also understands how emphasis on academics at Notre Dame can affect the recruiting process. 
Academic Influence 

"What's happened," Weis said, "is that the student body's SAT average contin­ues to get higher and high­er." 
In an article published on April 14, 2004, The Observer reported the aver­age SAT score of football players at Notre Dame had risen in almost direct pro­portion to rising standard­ized test scores of the aver­age student from 1993 to 2004-6.3 to 6.7 percent, respectively, according to data compiled from a Social Science Quarterly artiele. 
At the time of the reported findings, Saracino disagreed standards for football play­ers had toughened in terms of overall curriculum, grades and other factors. 
"We have not been any 'tougher' on the admissions of football players in recent years as we have with the overall applicants," he said in the April 14 article. 
Over the past few years, critics have questioned Notre Dame's recruiting capabilities, but Saracino maintains the roots of these complaints are not in a neg­ative relationship between admissions and coaches. 
"It wasn't bad before," Saracino said of his relation­ship with former Notre Dame head coach Tyrone Willingham. "If we were having some difficulty in recruiting the student-ath­letes that we wanted, it was­n't because they were trying to get young men admitted who could not do the work. It was just that they weren't getting them." 
Saracino said the admis­sions department has remained consistent in its standards fqr student-ath­letes, reiterating its empha­sis on a high school course­load that demonstrates an

ability to handle the Notre 
Dame eurriculum. 
Such a eourseload, 
Saracino said, ensures "tho 
transition from high school 
to Notre Dame will bn rnini­·mizod." 
"It's insulting to think 
every single athlot<1 ean't b11 
a solid student," Saracino 
said. "Overall, our concern 
is that they are students that 
can be successful at Notrn 
Dame, and rnally that's no 
dif'f'erent than tho way it's 
bnen for years at Notrn 
Dame." 
Developing relationships 
Irish assistant coaches 
have already brought poten­
tial recruit information over 
for Saracino to evaluatn. 
Saracino said hn has mel 
individually with coaches lw 
called "passionate" and 
"hard-working" who exhibit 
serious intenlst in bocoming 
experts in operating recruit­
ing practices within the 
expectations of the 
University. 
"In talking with them, I 
was really struck by how 
interested they were in tho 
type of student who comes 
to Notre Dame," Saracino 
said. "One of the coaches 
has a son who's applied to 
Notre Dame and hopefully 
will be coming next year ... 
His son could pretty much 
go anywhere and really is 
looking at Notre Dame. I 
take that as a good sign this 
coach specifically under­
stands this is the kind of 
student that comes to Notre 
Dame." 
Once assistant coaches 
like recruiting coordinator 
Hob lanello fully grasp Notre 
Dame, they can fully explain 
it to potential recruits. 
"Notre Dame doesn't have 
to be so much sold as the 
story told," Saracino said. 
"If the student-athletes 
know what's going on here, 
they're going to want to be 
here." 
Weis has made himself 
responsible for maintaining 
a solid relationship between 
Saracino, the admissions 
department and tho coach­
ing staff. In maintaining that 
relationship, the head coach 
-who has spent the majori­
ty of his coaching career in 
the NFL -has learned a 
few intricacies himself about 
what to look for in a recruit 
at Notre Dame. 
"I think that there are 
really three things that I 
think are independent that 
you have to bring together," 
Weis said. "We're all looking 
for good athletes. We're all 
looking for high-character 
kids. And we're all looking 
for kids that can graduate. 
Everyone's looking for that. 
"Obviously, in almost every 
kid there's a deficiency in 
one or two of those areas. 
The question is to what 
extent will you go down to, 
and it's really got to be a 
mesh of all three of those 
ingredients."

Irish prepare for deep Arizona State team in 2nd round 
By MATT LOZAR 
Senior SraffWrirer 

FRESNO, Calif. -Shutting down one Sun Devil won't send the Irish to their third straight Sweet 16. 
Arizona State just has too much depth. 
Facing a team with 10 play­ers logging double-digit min­utes and no one scoring more than 11.4 points per game, overcoming Arizona State's deep bench will be the chal­lenge for Notre Dame in tonight's second-round NCAA tournament game at 9 p.m. on ESPN2. 
"They have a very balanced attack," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said at Sunday's press conference. "We can't just shut down a [Kristen] Mann to win this game." 

Tonight's game figures to be a defensive struggle since both teams normally play that type of the style. Unlike the 8 7 points Arizona State scored in its first-round win over Eastern Kentucky Saturday, the Sun Devils aver­age 63 points per game. 
The Irish played their nor­mal style of game in the 61-51 win over UC Santa Barbara. McGraw knows her team needs that type of perform­ance on defense again tonight. 

"They are really physical and play great defense," McGraw said. "I was pleased with our defensive effort and we need it again [tonight]. 
"We're not a team that blows people out." More than just Batteast 
With Jacqueline Batteast struggling from the field and the post players in foul trou­ble, McGraw needed her role players to step · up on Saturday to defeat the pesky Gauchos. 
She got just that. 

"I was pleased with every­body," McGraw said. "We got great contributions from our starters and everyone gave us a lift." 
One interesting lineup McGraw used late in the first half saw three freshmen -Charel Allen, Tulyah Gaines and Melissa D'Amico -on the court with sophomore Breona Gray and Batteast. McGraw hadn't used that combination very often this season, but she was pleased with the results. 
"It was great to get them. some minutes. You're not sure what to expect," McGraw said. "I was pleased to see the freshmen play like that." 
What may have been most satisfying for McGraw was seeing her team excel with Batteast only scoring eight points. 
"I thought that was one of our best games of the year," McGraw said. "It was great to see us win with [Batteastl get­ting eight points and 10 boards and not 20 points." Quick hits 
+ Saturday's win gave the Irish 27 on the season. the third highest total in school history. Notre Dame's 1996-97 team, which advanced to the Final Four and won more games than any team in histo­ry, won 31 games. 

+ 
Batteast started her 96th consecutive game against the Gauchos, which set a school record. Katryna Gaither, who played at Notre Dame from 1994-97, previously held the mark. 

+ 
McGraw earned her 499th career victory Saturday. 

+ 
Since the Irish joined the Big East for the 1995-96 sea­son, the Irish have qualified for 10 straight NCAA tourna­ments. Each year, the Irish 


have advanced to at least the second round. 
+ Current Notre Dame ath­letic director Kevin White held the same position at Arizona State from 1996­2000. Current Arizona State athletic director Gene Smith, who is leaving for the same position at Ohio State in Columbus, is a former football player at Notre Dame and graduated in 1977.

McGraw is now 22­10 in NCAA Tournament games and gunning for career victory No. 500 as a head coach. She knows how to prepare her teams for second round match-ups with six of the past nine reaching the Sweet 16.  The Irish focus on defense, then scoring. They did a great job of that against UCSB by shutting down Mann and then getting their points. Against ASU, Notre Dame must once again play stifling 'D' and find ways to score enough for a victory.  LaVere played very well against UCSB, while Erwin grabbed six boards off the bench. Notre Dame needs those two, plus Borton, to con­trol the paint in terms of both scoring and rebounding. Batteast should have a better shooting game.  Duffy had a game­high 18 against UCSB, picking up the slack for Batteast. She continues to play well on both ends. Allen and Gray · played pivotal roles in the first round as well, contributing on offense and defense.  McGraw praised her bench after the UCSB game, and the Irish need another solid per­formance against ASU. Allen and Erwin are the two most consistent and significant sixth and seventh players ­both had good games in the first round.  The Irish expect noth­ing less than their third straight Sweet 16 appearance. They'll have to get there with little crowd support and the pressure of being the higher-seeded team. Notre Dame does, how­ever, have much more tournament experience.  
Turner Thorne is the all-time winningest coach at ASU. but her career record is just 145-121. She has led the Sun Devils to three NCAA bids and one 20­win season during her nine years at the helm.  The Sun Devils rely on a balanced offensive attack and solid defense for their suc­cess. They average just 63 points a gaine, but give up only 53. Ten players average double figure minutes with no one logging more than 26 a game.  Westerberg and Kovesdy are the only two ASU players to average double figures in scoring. Against Eastern Kentucky, the two combined for 38 poinl'l. Look for ASU to feed these two the ball first, then look for other scoring options.  ASU's key guard is Loney, who averages 9 points and three assists a game. She's also the only real 3-point threat, making 35 percent .for the season. Freshman guard Johnson gives the Sun Devils a spark off the bench.  Turner Thorne uses 10 players for double figures in minutes and all 10 have contributed, with no one tallying more than 26 minutes a game. The Sun Devils are very balanced and should have fresh legs all game, thank'l to fre­quent substitutions.  The Sun Devils are especially confident after trouncing Eastern Kentucky. They have quietly had a very good season. ASU should also have a distinct home court advantage and have nothing to lose against the favored Irish.  
Turner Throne has done a nice job form­ing ASU into a com­petitive program, hut McGraw easily takes the cake here. She has a national title and routinely leads the Irish to the Sweet 16.  Expect a low-scoring affair, with defense as both teams' strengths. The Irish want to get Batteast the ball early and often, hoping she can firid her. rhythm<. The Sun Devils could use a full court press to disrupt Notre Dame.  Slight edge to the Irish here, at least on paper. Notre Dame's post has steadily improved throughout the season and they played tough against UCSR The Irish have a go-to player in Batt~ast, while ASU isn't sure who will be the star each game.  No one really stands out for ASU, while Notre Dame has Duffy, Allen and Gray. The Irish must try and take Loney out of her game to disrupt the Sun Devils offense. If the forwards cancel each other out, Notre.Dame should have the advan­tage.

Admissions, staff 'on the same page' 
This is the third of a three­part series detailing the recruiting methods and policies under new head coach Charlie Weis. 
By PAT LEONARD Sports Writer 
Charlie Weis established his recruiting priority immediately by inviting 80 juniors to campus. He con­firmed his concern for bringing top talent to Notre Dame by assembling an experienced coaching staff. But from the beginning, Weis understood his most significant relationship throughout the recruiting process would be his inter­action with the admissions department. 
Over the brief time span Weis has spent in South Bend thus far, the head coach said his relationship and interactions with the admissions department have been positive and encouraging in accordance with his expectations of his alma mater. 
"I think that having a working relationship with the director of admissions, and the admissions staff is imperative to success," Weis said. 
Standards for Notre Dame student-athletes dif­fer from those of compet­ing programs and schools. Dan Saracino, director of admissions, believes Weis, a 1978 Notre Dame gradu­ate, has an advantage in being more familiar with the school. 
"One of the benefits of having a Notre Dame alumnus in that position is he understands Notre Dame," ·Saracino said. "He understands and does not believe that we need to admit anyone just because they're a good athlete." 
Saracino visited Weis' staff on Feb. 19 to inform the less-familiar assistant coaches of Notre Dame's recruiting history and expectations, both Weis and Saracino said.

BENGAL BouTs ~ 
Champions crowned Saturday 
By TOM DORWART Sports Writer 
Another year of Bengal Bouts came to a dose Saturday, with 11 new champions named after a night of furious fights. Sarpong def. Gallegos 
The lights dimmed, the crowd buzzed and the judges peered. It was time for the championship rounds of the 75th annual Bengal Boul'l. 
In the 126-pound weight divi­sion, Peter Sarpong took on Daniel Gallegos. Throughout the first round, Sarpong attacked. He looked like the aggressor until the first bell rang. 
But Gallegos fought back in the second round. Gallegos wailed, blocked and wailed more. At one point, he had Sarpong stumbling. Sarpong kept his balance and kept up for the remainder of the

Batteast's play not stellar, but rest of team makes up for it 
FRESNO, Calif.-Clank after clank, brick after briek, Jacqueline Batteast kept chucking up jumpers in Notre Dame's first-round NCAA Tourna­ment game against California Santa Barbara Saturday, and she kept watching helplessly as the ball went any­where but through the hoop. 
After dra­wing a foul late in the second half, in the midst of missing yet another short field goal, Batteast fired the ball off the
