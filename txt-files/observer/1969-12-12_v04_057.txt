THE OBSERIIM FRIDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1969
PAGE 2 

Summa-new direction for No-
This is the second and final part of a series on SUMMA. It was written by OBSERVER Staff Reporter Mike Moon­
ey. 
The SUMMA project booklet lists four general categories of proposed develope­ment. The single objective of Faculty Developement rates a category by itself, compared with the many faced objectives of Growth of Graduate Education, Spec­ial Research Programs and general developement. 
The second and third categories ­Growth of Graduate Education and Spec­ial Research Programs -are of special importance. They hint at a new direction for Notre Dame in the coming years. The combined expenditure on these two areas is suggested as $18,475,000; of this total, only the $250,000 earmarked for Area Studies can be said to be directly aimed at undergraduates. 
It would be very rash to suggest that the University is beginning to improve graduate education at the expense of undergraduate developement; after all, the $18 million-plus is only about 35% of the total goal, and the $20 million for Faculty Developement and over $13 mil­lion set for General Developement will vrobably prove to be of more benefit to undergrads than grad students. Yet, it is 35%, and in at least the cases of Engineer­ing and Science, additional aid is expect­ed in the form of private gifts and government assistance. 
If financial directions are any indica­tion of University goals it must be judged that the days of .. the downgrading -· unconscious or not -of graduate educa­tion at Notre Dame are dying if not already dead. 
SUMMA aimed at undergrads 
It is difficult to foretell what this 

improvement in graduate education bodes 
for future Notre Dame undergrads. Again, .it would be rash to suggest that the University is altering its direction to the emphasis of graduate over undergraduate education. Notre Dame has a long histori­cal and philosophical commitment to undergraduate education and, perhaps more important, several thousand alumni who probably _would not support any major turning of the Umverstty trom the 
production of Bachelors to that of Docto­rates. Such a new direction would be an uncharacteristic and, perhaps, a finan­cially poor choice for Notre Dame to make. 

ATTENTION! 
Those who paid their Cotton Bowl deposit for the Student Union trip may pick up a ticket for the Football game on Monday, Dec. 12, at the SERVICES OFFICE, 4th Floor La­Fortune. 
The very real advantages of an im­proved graduate program would seem to outweigh any supposed liabilities. Im­provements in graduate education and research programs would mean improve­ments in facilities, faculty, libraries ­much of which is bound to positively effect Notre Dame undergraduate popula­tion. 
What the University must avoid is an all-out rush to upgrade graduate educa­tion at the expense of the undergrads; with at least 65% of SUMMA aimed primarily at undergraduate education and life, that move is presently unlikely at Notre Dame. 
SUMMA has allocated $13,525,000 for "General Developement" of the Univer­sity. Included within the booklet's listings under this title are "Residence and Dining Facilities," and "Cooperation with St. Mary's College" --also a few surprises for an undergraduate reader. 
The description of the residence hall situation begins with a restatement of the often-heard position that "It is no coin­cidence that' many of the very best universities in America are residential universities." The copy adds that "today approximately 4500 undergraduates live in nineteen campus residences" while "almost one thousand students, most of whom would prefer to live on campus, 
must find rooms m the South Bend area", (italics my own). 
Trend towards off-campus 
The suggested solution is quite clear: "In order to accommodate these students on campus and to relieve the crowded conditions in many of the existing halls, Notre Dame is planning to build three, high-rise residence halls as well as an addition to the North Dining Hall." 
The booklet which suggests this solu­tion was published in 1967, and the plans, at least in the case of "three, high--';rise residence halls" have been alterdi. With the movement of student residents actually more towards off­campus' than on, the University is in no position to build dorms that will not be used. 
"We will build new dorms if they are needed," Commented Mr. Frick and added that Notre Dame does not intend to heat empt~ room~. 
There ts no hint of formal co-education in t!le SUMMA outline of future relations with St. Mar(s, only "inter-institutional cooperation.' This relationship is set against an outright merger of the two institutions, emphasizing instead the shar­ing of facilities, faculties, and courses -a stepped-up co-ex program. 
Faculty-student contacbs 
One surprise does emerge from the outline, however: a suggested academic halfway house between ND and SMC. 
"Physically, it is hoped the growing cooperation between Notre Dame and Saint Mary's will come to be symbolized by a facility equidistant from the two campuses which will serve as a combined academic building and student union," the booklet states. Such a facility would provide an opportunity for "closer, infor­mal contacts between professors and stu­dents of both schools." 
In short, SUMMA certainly means con­tinued growth for the University. The promised expansion in many graduate and research programs is certain to have an effect, hopefully a beneficial one, on the undergraduates. SUMMA offers an improved faculty and facilities for Notre Dame. It offers at least the promise of continued academic growth at the Univer­sity.

FOUNDED NOVEMBER 3, 1966 NOTRE DAME, INDIANA 
The art of giving 
In February of 1950, Notre Dame students staged the first Mardi Gras carnival. Their stated purpose was to "raise money for charities throughout the world". No doubt, they also had in mind to provide a social function that would relieve the 'long South Bend winter'. 
The first eighteen years were successful. The carnival grew each year until it averaged a profit in excess of $22,000 a year. These profits were then distributed to charities in South Bend and around the world. 
Mardi Gras will celebrate its twentieth anniversary this February and possibly its last. If the carnival winds up in the red again, there is little reason to continue it in its present form. 
We would hate to see Mardi Gras discontinued. But if this is the last year, it will be our own fault. The main source of income for the carnival is the raffle sales. Last year's Mardi Gras lost money primarily because the net revenue of raffle sales was less than half of the preceeding year's. 
There are many reasons cited to explain this drop in revenue. There were many administrative problems, such as failure to distribute the raffle books before Christmans

. 

vacation. However the real burden most likely rests with the student body and our lack of concern for the real purpose of Mardi Gras: to raise money for charity. 
Dave Dewan and his Mardi Gras staff are trying this year to bring the carnival back into proper focus. We congratulate them for their efforts but we realize that they are limited. The main responsibility falls on the individual student. The committee has set a goal this year of $30,000 net revenue from the raffle sales. It will truely be amazing if they cannot realize it, for this sum is attainable if only half the student body sold one book of tickets. 
It is rather depressing what has to be done these days in order to compel someone to contribute a small part of their affluence to others. There is nothing wrong with having fun while you raise money, but to have to offer incentives ranging from a new car to color tv's, trips to Bermuda and gift certificates from local merchants is totally out of context with the concept of charity. 
We urge each student to look beyond all the frivolity and to realize the main purpose of Mardi Gras. We think each student should find time over Christmas to sell the two books that were distributed to him.

Letters 
Apollo prayers 
Editor: 
I am using this opportunity of 
writing to you in order that I 
might urge all those students who 
have a little time in these busy 
days to write a short letter. 
I recently received a letter 
concerning Madeline Murray of 
Baltimore, who is circulating pe­
titions condemning the profes­
sion of faith by our astronauts 
during last summer's moon shot. 
It urged that as many people as 
possible write just a short note 
supporting the astronauts, and 
send it to Bill Mansdoerfer, Direc­
tor of Communications for 
Family Radio, San Francisco, 
California, 94134. Bill plans to 
personally deliver these toN ASA 
headquarters in Houston and to 
call a press conference. 
Thanks for your concern. A Student 
Woman's limited sphe'"e 
Editor: 
The recent election of a Miss Notre Dame was based solely on the pictures of those girls who were nominated, exactly what is miss n.d. to represent? the desir­able object? the beautiful acqui­sition? the valuable commodity? Woman has been forced to de­fine her femininity, for some time, in reaction to men. The media presents her as an object to be obtained and so an object which is useful in selling other objects (which are seen as neces­sary because they help one to possess the woman whom the media establishes as desirable). The limited sphere in which a woman is allowed to operate successfully has been set down by men. Since she has been convinced that she may be a woman only if she fulfills certain arbitrary obligations the woman comes to view herself as object. The election of miss n.d. illus­trates this problem rather blat­antly. Woman convinced she is woman when viewed as beautiful 
object never sees the irony of her position, never recognizes the injustice of the implications. Man "honors" beautiful object while somewhat indignantly as­serting that he truly respects her for herself. Should this woman ever assert herself by some form of independent thought she would be immediately seen as a threat. The expression of her ideas would be seen as aggressive and masculine and so peremptor­ily dismissed. It is time that woman learned to express their femininity by less arbitrary means and did so instead in a way which does them more jus­tice. It is time that woman did not fit easily, refused to fit so easily.

Everglades upset 
Editor: 

Recent)y circulated a p e t i t i o n p r ,o testing t he construction of a government owned airstrip (to be used for t rajn ing pilots) across the Everglades of Florida . This airstrip, when completed will d,efinately dest,roy the Everglades National Park and displace the Indians now 'living 
in the area. The airstrips will cut off the flow of the Everglades River which waters the Park dump pollutants into the water' will create frequent soni~ booms,--all of which will drastically upset the ecological balance of a most beautiful wilderness area (one of our relatively few National Parks) 
unique not only to the United States, but to the world. Once an area of this sort is destroyed, 
the damage is permanent and, irreversible -the consequences to be suffered not only by us, but by our posterity forever atter. 
I was quite mildly shocked by the apathy shown by so many of the ND and SMC students con­cerning such an important issue. I would therefore like to thank Skipper (the Bush Kangaroo), Gentle Ben, Hymen Breaker, Smokey the Bear, Knute R. Rockne, and Ratzo for the help they gave me in my endeavor. 
May I also mention that to whomever signed the petition "Jack the Fart"-1 whole­heartedly agree!!! 
However, I sincerely would like to send my thanks to those who did give genuine support to a very worthy cause.

The worst Christmas story ever told 
Tom Ehrbar 

Henry Peter Christian gently tilted his head so that the nape of his neck was brought into soft contact with the plush of the throne. He dropped his eyelids, wheezed a prayer of exhaustion, and slid his thighs slightly forward so as to distort the calm of his cushioned seat. Christian' braced himself on. two hard rubber boot-heels and found comfort. 
For nearly three seconds he slept, then from somewhere in the store a balloon broke and a child wailed and a mother yelled and Christian awoke with a frantic jump. "Oh" was all he said. 
If Christian had slept longer he would have dreamed; and in the dream (it was always the same) Christian would see himself, comically at first, then more vividly, caught by the mistaken narrowness of someone's chimney, his limbs wrapped in all sorts of amazing contortions, his sack of treasures trapped above him. The position was futile, frozen. And from down below, muffled and vague, the darkened moan of what sounded like a disturbed child would leap its way up the chimney, up to him, banging its way against the walls of brick, followed by a louder, clearer echo, followed by an echo of even greater amplitude, followed by another. Until this insane, evil clamor surrounded the grotesque Christian and released a million angry pins into his throbbing brain. And his head would whirl, and his body would revolve in a splendid arc of motion, and his sack would spin in wild, contrary, 
dazzling gryations. Faster, faster, faster. And he, Henry Peter Christian, would suddenly dissolve, just spin himself right out of existence. 
But this time Christian had not dreamed, had not had time to. The wailing of a distant child saved him. "Oh" 
was  all  he  said,  but it  was  more  than  
enough.  
The  fairyland  clock  with  

elfin-characters for hands said 8 O'clock, so Christian, with an immense effort rose onto his wobbly ankles and lumbered toward the alterations room; a fat bag of stocking-shaped, red and white striped candy canes trailing his steps. 
Chrstian reached the door and closed it locked it behind him. The burden of e~dless, grinning, wondrous, fearful faces; and the burden of carefully practiced ho ho ho's and what do you want for 
Christmas Sally, were eased as he triumphantly hurled the bag into an empty corner. He heard the candy snap and break as the bag hit the floor. With a faint and hollow chuckle Christian collapsed his bulk on a tiny stool and sat strangely before an improvised dressing table. He knew he must hurry and so the ritual began. First the boots. Santa Claus slapped them loudly onto the floor with vigorous kicks, giving his feet some room to manuever; then he yanked and tugged until the awesome boots fell and sat in a silent pile. He rolled his dripping socks into a neat block and bounced them against the ceiling. 
He must hurry, Christian thought again. Why had he taken this crazy job anyway? Well he did need the money. Debts to be paid, obligations to be met, people depending on him, people needing his help, people he had made promises to. And this was his job just for the Christmas season and would soon be over anyway. But a red suit and a white beard? 
White beard. Santa Claus loosened the frail strings with awkward hands trying to be deft ones. He lifted the beard from his ears; white fluffs of cotton still clinging to his cheeks. Santa splashed warm soapy water over his head and massaged his face with a washcloth. Then he hoisted the great red coat from his shoulders and hung it on a hook. The suspenders came next, springing to normal shape; then the undershirt which stuck tenderly to his chest. With the washcloth he dabbed beneath his arms. 
From outside his door, Christian heard garbled sounds; the words "hope we're not too late" hid amid a rush of other ones. 
Santa scowled in a mirror with tired eyes. Hurry. His face, he thought, was too heavy. A bowl full of jelly, he laughed. Sant tightened the muscles in his face, pushing the skin around in odd directions and shapes. He read somewhere that this helped the complexion. He couldn't figure out how though. 
A knock on the door, persistent and urgent. Christian wondered who at this hour, his mind went blank, he unlocked the door, and opened it to three squirming, impatient boyish faces. "Where's Santa Claus" one of them demanded. The man in bare feet and red _trousers with pale, bare chest and a frightened look simply stuttered. The three boys looked at Christian curioiusly. Christian said "Santa has gone away ,boys, uh, up to the North Pole, he has alot of work to do. Tomorrow's Christmas, you know. I'm, uh, just one of his helpers. Why don't you all go home now and by the time you wake up all your presents will be there under the tree." 

Christian loaded the boys with broken candy canes and led them to the door. As they left in their hushed, imaginative thoughts, Christian closed his eyes in relaxed gratitude, saw the grotesque image of himself dangling in a chimney, and leaped back to the dressing table. 
In a flurry he tore his trousers from his legs, and hung a dark suit onto his frame. Hurry: 
As he left the room Santa Claus turned and sawutter disarray; his flashy, familiar outfit scattered in random chaos; a soapy puddle of water standing in a low spot on the floor. Santa sped past the shoppers making their last-minute purchases at this the last minute. He sped past a gyro-train that ran on the under-side of its tracks, past a Raggetty Ann Doll with an idiotic grin and a saleslady with an expression to match. He scampered through the revolving doors almost knocking the false teeth out of an old man's mouth. 
Santa Claus ran and ran, and he didn't stop till he had reached the sleigh over-loaded with treasures and glistening in the winter night's brilliance. He hopped into his seat, cracked a loud whip, and moved into the sky. 
And the next day was Christmas.

Seniors aid in fresh man orientation 
by John Imler and John Broderick . 
/Jelow is reproduced a dialogue re­cently recorded by an OBSERVER writer who followed the speakers as they walked across the campus. For maximum noon­time chuckles may we suggest a choric reading performed by two of the people at your table whose voices fit the parts. Joe is a real brute of a senior, with a cavernous slow voice to match. Wilbert, a spindly first year man, makes high­pitched noises. 
Wilbert: Gosh, Joe, it's sure swell of you to show me the ropes like this. I mean otherwise I'd still be like the rest of those dumb innocent freshmen. 
Joe: Shucks, that's ok, Wilbert. I'm glad ta help a guy out-anything ta make ya more of an individual. 
W: flow's that one over in front of the dining ha ... 
J: Gees, watch yourself, kid! A guy could bust his ankle trippin' on one a them coffee cups like that. Wonder who the dumb idiot was what jest threw it in the grass out here. Least he coulda done was ta bust it against the side a Dillon like the rest a us do. 
W: It's ok, Joe... Maybe in front of LaFortune. 
J: D'ya know 'bout that place? Ya gotta be on your toes all the time kid. Sometimes, even on Saturday game morn­ings, a woman or girl'll walk through the place. I say any a them what's nervey enough ta walk through here deserves ta 
Once upon a time there was a girl known as Rudolpha, the red-nosed SMC girl. Rudolpha was a senior who had been an exemplary student for the last three previous years. But Rudolpha was un­happy. Poor Rudolpha, everyone knew her by her red, shiny nose and wherever she went everyone would say, "there goes Rudolpha, the girl with the red nose which glows!" Well you can just imagine how Rudolpha felt. 
But what really bothered Rudolpha most, was her failure to ever be asked out on a date by one of those fine-looking lads across the road. Neither Cupid Tell it to Tommy, Blitzen McCoy, Prancer Barz, nor Dasher McKenna would ask her out. Rudolpha didn't have any friends so naturally nobody could get her a blind date. When she resorted to the sopho­more dating system once again alas, her red nose foiled her attempts. 
Well as Christmas vacation rolled around all of the SMC girls and ND lads busily got ready to go home. But it came upon the midnight clear an extremely dense fog over our little town of South Bend. In fact the fog was so bad that nobody could leave by road, by train, or by plane because it would he too much of a risk. Can you imagine the plight of all the students? 
All of the SMC girls appealed to Santa Turnbull, asking what they were to do. Santa immediately sought the advice of be sexually molested. It's our campus. 
W: Joe, how come the Dome's gold? That's not an Irish color. Green is. It oughtta be green! You know that green paint in my room? I'm gonna paint it. .. The Green Dome. 
J: Shoot, why not; it's your paint and a g_uy oughtta be able ta do what he wants with what's his. 
W: You recognize that girl over by the fieldhouse? She's wavin' at ya, Joe. 
J: 
Uh... Yeh! Sure. That's Anne. She was one of the famous "Milwaukee 7." Also one of the "Lower Bogaloosa 32" who poured that pineapple nectar all over Dole's fruitpicker files. The rotten imperi­alists wouldn't let their fruitpickers pick their noses while they was pickin' fruit. 

W: Wow! What a girl that Anne Arkie! 

J: 
Hey, let's check over by the library. . . Look at that damn ugly mud path with 


all those puddles cut right across the grass. 
W: Yeh. The lazy grounds crew ought­ta get over here with a Rota-Tiller and dig it all up. That way we could have straight mud, with no puddles. And we wouldn't 
have to hypotenuse across water to save those 6 seconds. 
W: Joe, I forget, does Jacko live in Grace or Flanner Hall? I can never remember. 
J: You remember how I told ya ta keep 'em straight, kid: Peter Grace/Pet Hampster. 
W: Oh yeh. I always remember how he taught us to scalp those little beasts with your bare teeth. Sure makes swallowing 


her Student Assembly, but alas they were still in suspension. She then ran on to see Scrooge McGrath, who was too busy counting his money from his recent tui­tion hike of $200, to even listen to Santa Turnbull. Oh, said Santa, what shall I do? Dasher McKenna and Santa Turnbull put their heads together but all seemed hope­less. Good King Hesburg naturally wasn't around so they didn't know what to do. 
All of a sudden Santa Turnbull had a brain storm. Hark, she said, rest you merry gentleman, I have solved our prob­lem. Naturally our heroess Rudolpha was the solution. Santa ran over to Rudol­pha's room and beseeched her saying, "Rudolpha with your nose so bright won't you dimb to the top of Grace Tower tonight." So Rudvlpha climbed the decks of the hall until she reached the top. With her shiny red nose she lit up the sky and South Bend's usual bright wea­ther seemed to have returned. 
Well now you can imagine how all the SMC girls loved her and they shouted out with glee, "Rudolpha the red nose SMC girl, you'll go down in SMC history." 
Oh yes and by the way Rudolpha never had to worry about dates again after this because while she was climbing up to the top of Grace Tower, she encountered a ND lad who had an equally red nose from his indulging in the "spirits". Their noses immediately fell in love and they are now dating forever happily.

As King explains it, this meeting was originally set up to help with the T A question, but now that this seems to be settled, he sees it as a means of keeping the lines of communication open between the two groups in a hope that the Trustees will be moro aware of the various problems facing today's graduate student.

At this point, said Lawless, "the effect of inadequate en­forcement becomes evid1~nt." Lawless stated that cities of 500,000 average two inspectors. Even those few inspectors become frustrated as they find the city's attorney poorly pre­pared in court and are taken away from their jobs by red tape, he said. "It may be three years after the offense that the case getw into the court," Lawless explained. 
The one effective technique, Lawless said, is an injunction procedure where the evidence is clear and has become over­whelmingly distracting. "'This requires impetus. An aggrieved individual may launch such an action," he said. Lawless stated that the industries are hurt more by the denting of their public relations image rather than the fine imposed.

Offense must have their day 
Well 1 assume you all saw it on TV. Texas who is supposed to run well and who is supposed to pass poorly didn't and won anyw~y. Which makes awful hard to make judgements on the upcommg Cotton Bowl. 
The invaders from South Bend will try their luck against the No. I 
team in the country on Jan.! in a game which may draw the 
biggest TV audience of the whole day. Texas won the right to ~Ia~ 
by beating Arkansas 15-14 on Saturday, Dec.6. The _Longhorn~ d1d It 
with a great fourth down pass and an interception, negatmg an 
inspired defensive performance by Arkansas. 
Notre Dame's job on New Year's day will be the same as the 
Razorbacks' last Saturday-stop the run. Texas utilizes the 
Wishbone-T to devastating effect wht:n given a chance. The 
Longhorn backs are all tough runners, including quarterback J_ames 
Street. His passing credentials may be open to debate, but he directs 
the offense well. And he has an excellent line in front of him. Texas' 
main difficulty seems to come on 3rd and Xsituations. They'd rather 
be looking at 3rd and 2. The first play from scrimmage in every set 
of downs should be the crucial one. Give the Longhorns a 2nd and 4 
and you can forget about getting a punt. 
To make Texas pass, that is the big problem. Given that Street 
threw a great pass in the fourth quarter, he still remains a so-s? 
passer. Hdping him become better is split end Cotton Speyrer who IS 
a legitamately fine receiver. . 
It won't be the first time the Irish have faced the optiOn-type 
offense. Duffy Daughterly from Michigan State came into this 
season's game with the Wishbone-T offense. But faced with the ND 
four linebacker defense, he dumped it in favor of a more 
conventional offense.Duffy did, however, put in the Option 
whenever tht: Spartans came in scoring range and the Irish weren't 
very successful in stopping it. . 
1 think N D can assume that Texas will stick to the same basic 
stuff rather than pull out somt:thing special. With this in mind, the 
Irish can plan to concentrate on the Longhorns' running game. They 
can be stopped, Arkansas proved that. And when thay are s~opped, 
they can really have nowhere to go. Either Clarence Elhs, or a 
double-team on Speyrer should shut-out the passing threat. And the 
Irish certainly have ithe personnel on defense to do the job on the 
Wishbone-T. 
In my opinion, the game will revolve around dthc ND 
offense-Texas defense struggle. It was the defense which kept the 
Longhorns close and gave them the chance to win. Notre Dame's 
offense has had days this year when it too trembled at a 3rd and 8, 
namely against Purdue. Yet the Irish have shown that they possess a 
versitilc offense. If Dewey Poskon recovers from his shoulder woes, 
ND will have as fine a split end-tight end combination as can be 
needed. The Irish ground game is very solid and deep. Joe 
Theismann is certainly a better than average passer. 
I feel that the Irish defense can take care of itself. In order to be a' 
Tt:xas, the offense must have an exceptional day.
