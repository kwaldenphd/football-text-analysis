Student leaders emphasized tlwir concern regarding the University's stressed relation­ship with the community at a Couneil of Hepresentatives (COH) meeting Monday, where they discussed a resolution to amend the South Bend Public Nuisance Ordinance and recent break-ins occurring at off-campus housing. 
Community Helations chair Nick Guzman said the issue of his eommittne's namesake has "raised in the eyes of many students" due to the passing of the July 25, 2005 ordinance as well as the repeated break­ins in past weeks. 
"Student's don't see [the South Bend community! as being part of their lives, but (these instances] are showing it is," Guzman said. 
A resolution to tweak the ordinance was passed unani­mously within Student Senate on Nov. 30. It both recognizes the eoncerns of the South Bend community regarding

Faculty angry, pleased

Furiously scratching .down notes, leaning over to confer­ence quietly with a neighbor, murmuring with approval or dissent -all things consid­ered, the crowd of faculty members gathernd to hear University President Fathnr John Jenkins speak Monday night looked thn part of the students they normally pre­side ovnr. 
But this was not thn typical class lecture, as sovnral of thn listeners were quick to respond to the presidnnt with high praise and fiery t~ritiques. 
Encouraged to add their voices to the "convnrsation" about the struggle to maintain both tho Catholic charactnr of 
·Notre Dame and the acadnmic freedom necessary cultivate a healthy University environ­ment, faculty took advantage of the post-speech formal question-and-answnr sossion as well as time set aside for more personal discussion dur­ing the post-address reception to raise concerns about the more controversial elements of Jenkins' statement.

Donors flood University phones 
Hundreds of concerned ND benefactors make calls, express anxiety 
By HEATHER

News Writer 
On the first business day after Notre Dame announced a Development Office server security breach, the University received hundreds of phone ealls about the inci­dent University vice presi­dent of Public Affairs and Communication Hilary Crnkovich said Monday. 
Many of the calls on Monday were to confirm that the incident did actually hap­pen, Crnkovich said. 
Meanwhile, investigation of how exactly the server was 

hacked into continued Monday. 
"I don't think our forensic experts have had an oppor­tunity to do full-circle analy­sis," Crnkovich said Monday afternoon. "That's still ongo­ing, so we probably need a little more time there. I would give them a little bit more time to do their due diligence." 
Crnkovich said that between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m. on Monday, about 200 people called the toll-free helpline set up by the University to facilitate concerns about the breach. Most, she said, were calling to make sure the e­mail they received from the University was not fake. 
"The calls are going well," Crnkovich. "The majority of them this morning, interest­ingly enough, were people confirming that it was real and that it wasn't a hoax. It's been pretty positive so far. So we hope it stays that way." 
She also said that the University has had no con­vincingly negative phone calls from donors who are upset to the point of threat­ening not to donate to the University as a result of this security breach.

Sports Writer 
cisely why he won't get the credit he deserves: he's not the old Kobe, and he's just not very likeable. 
He came into the league an intro­verted 17 year-old who spoke fluent Italian and showed flashes of bril­liance, making his first All-Star team just two years later and later win­ning three championships for the Lakers. 
But times change. Bitter feuds with Shaq and Phil eventually sent both O'Neal and the coach packing, and just when the questions about his inability to be a team player were at their peak, the Eagle, Colo. sex scan­dal surfaced. After that tearful apol­ogy to his wife on national television failed to restore his perfect image, he never did. 
LeBron James has usurped the title of "the next Michael Jordan," as well as the endorsement deals with Nike, Sprite and Upper Deck. Kobe is no longer the NBA's favorite son, but he has embraced his new image, show­ing up to camp this year with some new tattoos and a self-bestowed vil­lainous nickname: the Black Mamba. 
No matter what Bryant accom­plishes, he will always have his crit­ics. "He's selfish," "he's too much trouble," they say. But they've left out one thing-he's amazing. 
There's nothing bad you can say about his play. He's a classic example of a good player on a bad team. And this bad team is winning -all because of him. 
Kobe is showing once again that you don't have to be a good person to be a good player. Bill Laimbeer, Rodman, 'Sheed -they never won any sportsmanship awards, but they did win championships. While the Lakers are far from a championship team this year, Kobe has willed them into seventh place in the West less help than the aforementioned bad boys. 
Look at the stat line of Sunday's game. You'll see six rebounds, three steals and a blocked shot. The man wasn't just gunning, he was playing defense, playing hard. He can't help that he is on the Lakers. 
He's angry, he's nasty, he's got a chip on his shoulder, but he's playing like no one has in years. It doesn't matter if you like Kobe, he probably doesn't like you either. 
It doesn't matter that he's no longer the angelic Kobe of old. This Kobe is new, improved and deserving of recognition. So, put aside your personal grudges, let go of those old memories of a baby-faced Kobe hawking Big Macs. 
It's best to do just what the rest of the Lakers are doing: sit back, relax, and enjoy.

the discourteous behavior of Notre Dame students and points out what student body president Dave Baron called "contradictory" elements of the ordinance. 
"The resolution ... recog­nizes the space between the community as a whole and the student body [and] recognizes that these are issues we can deal with," Guzman said. "We can take a proactive role." 
The resolution said the Public Nuisance Ordinance should be amended so it could be consistent with its original intent -that eviction pro­ceedings take place only after an initial "Notice to Abate" letter fails to change the behavior of the admonished tenant. 
Baron and Guzman's inten­tion for the resolution was to go in front of the city -and strides were made to realize that specific goal at Monday's COR meeting. 
Baron suggested the resolu­tion be brought up at the Feb. 27 South Bend Common Council meeting by COR repre­sentatives, who will each -by virtue of Council practices and policies -have three minutes to speak freely at meeting's conclusion. 
The central goals of a Notre Dame presence are to "talk about eviction proceedings as a defense provision" and "increase the scope" of the University's community partic­ipation, Baron said. 
"My hope is that it will [pose] our position in a light they haven't seen before," he said. 
Members said speakers at the event should present coherent arguments instead of being redundant. Additionally, members agreed it would be best to approach the meeting with professionalism and tact. 
"It is not my intention to spring this on [the council]," Baron said. "I'd like to tell them we're going to come and talk about this on a particular day ... It's prudent and courte­ous to let them know. I think it's our duty to go and present our case." 
Members agreed there should be more permanent Notre Dame representation and participation at future Council meetings -an aspira­tion that might be achieved by student liaisons. 
Baron said the issue of off­campus break-ins was also paramount in the struggle to ameliorate Notre Dame's rela­tionship with the South Bend community. 
"The mayor's office has approached me and showed signs of [its] affinity for help­ing students out," he said. "They want to do something proactive." 
But members agreed stu­dents must first take an initia­tive to protect themselves. 
Guzinan presented two measures that might prevent crimes occurring at student homes off-campus. Project MARC enables students to enter valuables into a South Bend Police Department (SPBD) database so they might be returned following a theft. Students can also partake in the SBPD-run neighborhood watch program led by cap­tains within their respective neighborhoods.

Bush defends domestic spying 
President clarifies plan, terming it a 'terrorist surveillance program' 
Associated Press 
MANHATTAN, Kan. ­President Bush pushed back Monday at critics of his once-socrnt domestic spying effort. saying it should be termed a "ter­rorist surveillance pro­gram" and contending it has tho backing of legal experts, key lawmakers and the Supremn Court. 
Several membnrs of_ Congress from both parties havn questioned whether the warrantlnss snooping is logal. That is beeausn it bypasses a spndal fnderal court that. by law, must authorize eavesdropping on Amerjc:ans and because the pn~sidnnt provided lim­ited notification to only a fnw lawmakers. 
"It's amazing that people say to mn, 'Well, he's just brnaking the law.' If I wanted to break the law, why was I briefing Congress?" asked Bush. One of those who had been informed, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Pat Hoberts, H­Kan., was sitting behind Bush during his appear­
ance  at  Kansas  State  
University.  
Bush's  remarks  were  

part of an aggressive administration campaign to defend the four-year-old program as a crucial and legal terror-fighting tool. Thn White Ilouse is trying to sell its side of the story before the Senatn Judieiary Committee opens hearings on it in two weeks. 
Back in Washington, Gen. Michael Hayden, the former National Security Agency director who is now the government's No. 2 intelligenee off1eial, eon­tended the surveillance was narrowly targeted. lie acknowledged that the program established a lower legal standard to eavesdrop on terror-relat­ed eommunieations than a surveillance law imple­mented in 1978. 
Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, government ol'l'icials had to prove to a secretivn intelligenee eourt that there was "probable cause" to believe that a person was tied to terror­ism. Bush's program allows senior NSA officials to approve surveillanee when there was "reason to believe" the call may involve ai-Qaida and its aiTI!iates. 


Hayden maintained that the work was within the law. "The constitutional standard is reasonable.... I am convinced that we are lawful because what it is we are doing is reason­able," he said at the National Press Club. 
Hayden also rejeeted suggestions that the NSA rank-and-file had prob­lems with the eleetronie monitoring, saying that the agency's independent watehdog told him Friday that "not a single employ­

ee" had registered a eon­cern with that offiee about the program. 
Democrats countered that many important ques­tions remain. 
"We can be strong and operate under the rule of law," said Senate Minority Leader Harry Heid, D-Nev. "These are not mutually exelusive prineiples -they are the principles upon which our nation was founded." 
In his remarks, Bush said that allowing the NSA to monitor the internation­al phone calls and e-mails of Amerieans with suspeet­ed ties to terrorists ean hardly be eonsidered "domestic spying." 
"It's what I would eall a terrorist surveillance~ pro­gram," Bush said at Kansas State. "If they're making a phone 1~all in the United States, it seems like to me we want to know why." 
lie said he "had all kinds of lawyers revinw thn proeoss" to ensure it didn't violate civil liberties or the law. 
And he insisted that a recent Supreme Court decision backs his eon­tnntion that he had the authority to order the pro­gram through a rnsolution Congress passed af'tnr the 200 I terrorist attacks that lets him use force in the anti-terror light. 
''I'm not a lawynr, but I ean tell you what it moans: It means Congross gave me the authority to usn neces­sary force to protect tlw Ameriean peopln, but it didn't preseribn the tac­tics," Bush said. 
KUWAIT 


Emir agrees to abdicate position 
Associated Press 
KUWAIT CITY -Kuwait's ailing emir has agreed to abdicate under a dnal worked out within the ruling family, a lawmaker said Monday ­paving the way for the prime minis­ter and longtime de facto ruler to take the reins of power. 
The aecord followed an unprece­dentnd public quarrel within the rul­ing family over who would lead the country, one of Washington's most steadfast allies in the Middle East and a major oil producer, after the death of its longtime leader.

Hacker adtnits using 1Zotnbie netw-ork' 
Associated Press 
SAN FRANCISCO -A 20-year­old hacker admitted Monday to surreptitiously seizing control of hundreds of thousands of Internet-connected computers, using the zombie network to serve pop-up ads and renting it to people who mounted attacks on Web sites and sent out spam. 
Jeanson James Ancheta, of Downey, Calif., pleaded guilty in Los Angeles federal court to four felony charges for crimes, includ­ing infecting machines at two 
U.S. military sites, that earned him more than $61 ,000, said fed­eral prosecutor James Aquilina. 
Under a plea agreement, which still must be approved by a judge, Ancheta faces up to 6 years in prison and must pay the federal government restitution. He also will forfeit his profits and a 1993 BMW. Sentencing is schedule for May 1. 
Prosecutors called the case the first to target profits derived from use of "botnets," large numbers of computers that hack­ers commandeer and marshal for various nefar:ious deeds, their owners unaware that parasitic programs have been installed are being run by remote control. 
Botnets are being used increasingly to overwhelm Web sites with streams of data, often by extortionists. They feed off of vulnerabilities in computers that run Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system, typically machines whose owners haven't bothered to install security patches. 
A November indictment charged Ancheta with 17 counts of conspiracy, fraud and other crimes connected to a 14-month hacking spree that started in June 2004 and that authorities say continued even after FBI agents raided his house the fol­lowing December. 

"Part of what's most troubling about those who commit these kinds of offenses is they think they'll never be caught," said Aquilina, who spent more than a year investigating Ancheta and several of Ancheta's online asso­ciates who remain uncharged co­conspirators. 
Ancheta's attorney, federal public defender Greg Wesley, did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment. 
Ancheta has been in federal custody since his November indictment. lie previously worRcd at an Internet cafe owned by a relative and had hoped to join the military reserves, according to his aunt, Sharon Gregorio. Court docu­ments suggested he had a taste for expensive goods, spending $600 a week on new clothes and car parts. 
The guilty plea comes less than a week after the FBI released a report that estimates viruses, worms and Trojan horse pro­grams like the ones Ancheta employed cost U.S. organizations $11.9 billion each year. 
November's 52-page indict­ment, along with papers filed last week, offer an unusually detailed glimpse into a shadowy world where hackers, often not old enough to vote, brag in online chat groups about their prowess in taking over vast numbers of computers and herding them into large armies of junk mail robots and arsenals for so-called denial of service attacks on Web sites.

Congress to co111bat phone record selling 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Disclosures that companies arc selling pri­vate phone records have law­makers and federal regulators moving to try to halt the prac­tice. 
Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., said in a state­ment Monday that he will work with the head of the Senate Commerce Committee, Sen. Ted Stevens, H-Alaska, on a bill to criminalize the practice. 
"Fraudulently obtaining a customer's cell phone records and selling them over the Internet is wrong and must be stopped," Frist said. "Consumers have a right to expect that this information will be kept private, with very limit­ed exceptions." 
Sens. Charles Schumer, D­N.Y., Arlen Specter, H-Pa., and Bill Nelson, D-Fla., have also introduced a bill outlawing the practice. Similar House legisla­tion is being proposed. 
The companies that offer peo­ple's cell and landline records can get the information a few different ways. One method is called "pretexting," in which data brokers or those working for them call a phone company pretending to be a customer and persuade it to release the information. 

~ Pretexting for financial data is 
illegal, but there's no specific 
law against pretexting for 
phone records. The data bro­
kers also can use insiders at the 
phone companies to get the 
records. 
The Federal Communications 
Commission is investigating the 
online data brokers. The agency 
has subpoenaed DataFind.org 
and Locatecell.com for informa­
tion on how they obtain the 
phone records. A follow-up let­
ter sent last week gave the Web 
sites a week to comply before 
facing fines of up to $11,000 for 
each day they are in violation of 
the citation. 
An attorney for 
Locatecell.com, which is run by 
a Florida-based company called 
1st Source Information 
Specialists, did not return sev­
eral phone calls on Monday. A 
company official with 
DataFind.org in Tennessee had 
an unpublished phone number 
and was not reachable. 
Experts say the breadth of 
information one could glean 
from a person's phone records 
is alarming.

"We found that Ameriquest's lend­ing practices too often violated prin­ciples of fairness," said California Attorney General Bill Lockyer. "This settlement provides a good measure of justice by compensating victims for previous practices and to soc there aren't problems in the future."

American politics has devolved into the art of gaining and maintaining power. The two major political parties cast off ideological beliefs when they appear to be politically damaging and thus run the risk of losing re-election. The recent corruption scandals are indica­tive of the crumbling ethical foundations that are necessary for the maintenance of a republic. Republics rely upon the people entrusting statesmen of their choosing to carry out governance for benefit of the body politic. If the states­men are not ethical and the people's trust is misplaced, then the social contract particular to a republic begins to be torn. 
Contemporary American events show the bonds of our republic being strained and put to the test. This is not to say America is in danger of abandoning its representational system, but rather that America is in danger of continuing to function as an actual, healthy republic. The largest danger is presented by the role that large monied interests continue to exert upon the state via lobbyists. Lobbying has evolved to the point where influential powerbrokers funnel enor­mous sums of money to politicians with the understanding that a quid pro quo will occur. Timorous politicians, deathly terrified of losing their positions, accept these "campaign contributions" and then proceed to forward the agenda that the particular lobbying group is interested in. The will of the people is bypassed, and government becomes a republic of inter­ests. Powerful interests help to make and break politicians by their contributions; many politicians have decided that their true electorate consists of these interests, and have accordingly governed in their benefit and not that of the body politic. 

I an Ronderos 
Liberated 

The Jack Abram off scandal has brought a widespread problem to the forefront of the national news. The man crept so deep into the roots of American government that had faced or faces investigations by the Justice Department, the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, the IRS, the Department of the Interior and the FBI. He has already plep guilty to three felony charges and has been connected to numerous members of congress from both parties -most prominently Representative Bob Ney from Ohio. Lavish contributions, personal gifts and exotic trips were bestowed upon promi­nent politicians of both parties. The bless­ing of the enormity of his crime is that it brings to light a serious problem in American politics. Abram off and his client politicians are by no means alone-in the recent few years many other less dra­matic, yet equally troubling, scandals and convictions have occurn~d. The former governor of my home state, Connecticut, John G. Howland, accepted free work from contractors to improve his weekend cottage and pled guilty to corruption charges on Dec. 24, 2004. For brevity's sake, I will pass over the numerous other examples of corruption that have come to light within the recent years. 
It is not enough merely to decry the sad state of public corruption; rather, a solu­tion must be posited. Complaining about a problem never solves it; one must arrive at a solution if anything is truly to be done. As the influence of wealthy inter­ests has grown to the point that it is deeply entrenched in the current political status quo, it is imperative to cull this venomous root. Campaigns should be publicly funded with equal funds assigned to the two major parties. A threshold of signatures could be required where if met a third party would be allowed to receive funds as well, corresponding to the amount of support they can demonstrate. The threshold should not be high, because the two-party system is already far too entrenched to begin with -this entrenchment has created a system where the two major parties are essen­tially coalitions of various interests that have united in an effort to get a voice in governing. This system could indeed pro­mote the growth of third parties by allow­ing them access to federal funding and by eliminating fundraising from the equa­tion. The elimination of fundraising from political parties would help to eliminate the vast logistical barriers that exist for third parties to challenge the well-estab­lished and powerful Democratic and Hepublican parties. 
The rise of third parties would most likely have a positive eflect upon the cor­ruption that is plaguing the current American political scene. Although the majority of current corruption scandals seem to involve Hepublicans, the issue is not contained to one party. It is true that the Republican politidans are to blame and the party must be held accountable, but the faet that more Hepublicans seem to be implicated has a lot to do with the faet that they control all the curnmt branches of government. If the Democrats were in control, the lobbyists would apply more pressure on them, and their internsts seem to be the same as the Republicans'-namely, the acquisition and maintenance of power. New blood needs to be injected into the system. This increased competition from less-estab­lished parties would increase pressure upon the two major parties to become more ethical and refrain from accepting favors from lobbyists.

U-WIRE 
To thEJ President of the United States of America: 
I'v11 reeently become aware that you signed an executive order bypassing dun proeess in wiretapping cases. Whnther or not you bPiieve it, you'vn Ramsey ov11rsteppnd your Tesdell wartime presiden­tial powers. 
Iowa State 
You've allowed the 

University
fnar and hysteria of Iowa State Sept. 11 tPrrorist 
Daily

attaeks to breach our eountry's eonsti­
tutional foundations. 
Let me explain how you havn failed as president. 
During your inauguration, you swore to uphold and protect the Constitution Qf' the UnitHd States of America. You swore to do this over thn Holy Bible. But the media has Hxposed your latest and most horril'ic lies and put them before the public oye. Your gross disrngard for the Constitution has pulled us hauntingly nearnr to a state ruh1d by a dictator. You said yourself, "Being president would be a lot easier if it were a dic­tatorship." What a frightening thing for the leader of the free world to say. 
You said we went to war in Iraq bneause of weapons of mass destruc­tion, but you couldn't share the source of this information because 
Dear Mr. President 
that would compromise national secu­rity. Some believed you, and our nation marched off to war. When the weapons couldn't be found, your justi­l'ication IWolved to say Saddam posed a risk to democracy and the free world. You accused him of gassing the Kurds and attacking Kuwait unpro­voked, horrible aetions that we know Saddam undertook. But you never mentioned that Saddam got those chemical weapons from the United States during and after the Ronald Reagan administration, and apparent­ly got rid of them before your inva­sion. 
Your administration's philosophy is based on lies and deception. And because of it, people have died ­countless innocent civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan and more than 2,000 of our brothers and sisters in the mili­tary. I have more respect for these men and women than I ever will for you. 
Mr. President, you promised to make the world safer. You promised that you would rid the world of "evil­doers" and bring democracy and jus­tice to the heathens. You have done just the opposite: We live in fear of terrorism at home, terrorism abroad and an overall rise in religious funda­mentalism. Our country has seen the highest national debt in recent histo­ry. our educational system is becom­ing too expensive for the people and we've let Americans suffer because of the incompetence of government agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, whieh you stuffed with unqualified cronies. 
Your war in Iraq, the prison abuses, your lies to the American people and your utter incompetence have caught up to you. You have done nothing to make us safer and everything to make our world more dangerous. 
You will be remembered in the his­tory books, just as you wished, but not for stunning speeches or epic poli­cy. Instead, you will be remembered as the president whose exit strategy was foiled by a locked door or as the president that did the most damage to our Constitution by failing to protect it. 
I have some suggestions, Mr. President, to help solve the problems you've created. 
+ At home, repeal your authoriza­tion for the National Security Agency to spy on U.S. citizens and repeal the Patriot Act. If you think someone has suspected terrorist connections, fol­low due process and seek permission from a court to listen to his or her conversations. Do as you swore in your inauguration and protect our freedoms and liberties by defending the Constitution. 
+ 
Develop an exit strategy in Iraq, and ask the world for help. You've ousted a horrible dictator; now use the opportunity to help the Iraqis cre­ate a modern Arab state that balances the principles of Islam with the virtues of democracy. Don't allow oil, military and reconstruction contracts to dictate how and when we leave Iraq.

+ 
Support people here in the United States. Instead of cutting l'inancial aid and loan programs to students, Medicare coverage for the poor and Social Security benefits for the elder­ly, you should slash unnecessary and wasteful projects within the military's bloated budget. 


Mr. President, you have failed us as a leader when we needed one most. You have failed us at home, and because of this, failed to convey the message of peace, democracy and jus­tice to the world stage.

Intelligent design: Fact or fiction? 
From the earliest times of recorded history, humanity has been obsessed with its origins. Where did lifll begin, why and most importantly, how? Various religions sprang up, eaeh with their own creation story. Some of these stories w11re vastly dif­fnrllnt from one another; others werll dosely related. Th11 people Carrie accepted these stories, as they Weidner rnally had nothing else to go on, and the beliefs were of'len

did their ideas. Creationism reli­gions evolved, divided, united and soon became the religions they are today. However, seience itself also grew, rapidly giving itself a name as a source of secular explanation, a way to view the earth without assuming, as the religions did, a higher power. To science, human exploration of the earth was the only method of explanation. 
The most infamous of these secular scientists, although he himself was a Christian, was Charles Darwin, whose name has become synonymous with his theory of evolution and natural selection. His idea refuted the basic Christian teaching that God created all beings as they were, are now and will be in the future. However, his theories were basically accepted and remain so today, with modifications caused by advances in science and further experi­mentation. Because of this general acceptance, Darwinism is now taught in most high school biolo­gy classes. 
Recently, though, the Creationists have risen up, as they have in the past. and are protesting the teaching of evolution in the classroom, claiming that it is no more than a theory. They believe their views, more commonly known as intelligent design, should also be presented in biology classes. There are some problems with this view. First and fore­most, creationism and evolution are not competing theories, never have been and never will be. Intelligent design, the idea that an unknown higher power exists, has no relevance to science. It speaks of the origins of life, not of what happened after­wards. Evolution does not regard how the life on this planet came to be, it merely attempts to describe what happened after that. For a scientific theory, evolution is fairly solid, although it has its holes. Then again, even Newton's laws have their holes (they don't hold at the quantum level). 
Intelligent design is not science. Karl Popper, the Austrian philosopher, claims that an integral part of scientific hypotheses is their ability to be disproved. There is always a chance remaining that everything we hold to be scientil'ically true will be thrown out the window tomorrow. That is part of science as a construct of the imperfect human mind. 
There is no theory to intelligent design. It cannot be proven or disproved, because it assumes a high­er power as an explanation. Belief in this higher power is a matter of faith, and faith is not science. 
The truth is, no one can explain the origins of life scientifically. Stephen Hawking, the famous physi­cist, claimed that at the origin of the universe, all of the laws of nature come to a singularity. This is sci­ence-talk for "no one has a clue." Does this mean we should stop looking?

College students decide value of education 
The first literacy study to target the skills of graduating students found that more than half of students at four-year colleges -no matter their field of study -lack the literaey to handle seemingly mundane real-life Staff tasks, the Associated Editorial Press reported 
Friday. University of 
The study found Houston that most students The Daily could perform mod­Cougarerately challenging tasks such as identifying a location on a map, but they often lacked "profi­cient" skills-those needed to per­form more complex tasks. Many stu­dents could not understand the argu­ments of newspaper editorials, com­pare credit card offers with different interest rates and annual fees or inter­pret a table about exercise and blood pressure. 
Those results are more than a little frightening. 
College students, the intellectual elite of yesterday, have become the intellectual mediocrity of today. 
The "college lifestyle" may account for some of the deeply saddening results. Perhaps the partying that comes with being immersed in an environment dominated by young peo­pie and alcohol is partially to blame ­something that does not affect UH as much as it does other schools. 
UH is largely a commuter school, and as such, many students need to work one or two jobs and pay their own bills regularly. That kind of real­life experience undoubtedly helps stu­dents improve their pragmatic literacy. 
That said, the results are still dis­heartening at best. The only silver lin­ing to be plucked out of the study's storm clouds seems to be the fact that college students had an average litera­cy score significantly higher than other adults. But even that can be mis­leading. Adults who did not make it past middle school were also included in the group of "other adults." 
As depressing as the results are, they also serve as a reminder that a college education is only worth as much as each individual experience, and it looks like the responsibility to get a quality education has fallen to each individual student as well.

Learning from 


movie romance 
As January melts away into February, one can't help but think of the chalky conversation hearts, red roses and love-or sugar-induced euphoria that the upcoming month 
inevitably brings. Furthermore, with Valentine's Day looming on the horizon, some of us might feel the need to quickly master the art of romantic relation­ships in time to 


receive Valentine's 

affections in a Mary Squillace form that does not merely consist of Scene Critic 
the words "Love, Mom." 

However, in an environment where the road to romance is often the same path that leads to TC on the weekends and "dating" does not entail actually going on a date ever, where can Darners turn for guid­ance? 
By now, our compulsive insideND checks have revealed that romance isn't exactly an integral part of aca­demia. And by turning to parental wisdom, we run the risk of hearing them recount personal tales of "going steady" back in the day ... or worse. Instead, seeing as most Hollywood films are synonymous with "happy endings," we can turn to the seemingly foolproof antics of some of our favorite characters in hopes that, by emulating them, we too will be graced with all the love Hallmark can provide. 
First of all, deception and false · pretenses are key. Sure, all our lives we've heard that honesty is the best . policy, but according to the relation­ships that unfold on the big screen, a little white lie, or even a false identi­ty, is the ticket to true love, as long as the truth surfaces eventually. 
Fabricating a name, profession or identity are practically commonplace when it comes to cinematic cou­plings. Just check-out "Wedding Crashers" or "Maid in Manhattan." In fact, going as far as dressing in drag seems to be a great way to break the ice and ignite some kind of passion, as illustrated by films like "Tootsie" and "Shakespeare in Love." 
Also in this vein, relationships that are spawned from some kind of bet or deal end particularly well. "She's All That" and "How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days" both lend themselves to this notion. 
Of course, any romantic hero is only as good as the dramatic ges­tures he or she makes. While Shakespeare's Romeo set the trend centuries ago with his impromptu visit to Juliet's balcony, his success has been cemented on screen by a variety of love-struck characters, such as "Say Anything"'s Lloyd Dabbler, who sends his love via a stereo, courtesy of Peter Gabriel's "In Your Eyes." 
Although, if the prospect of shout­ing sweet nothings to a second floor window on Notre Dame Avenue rais­es the concern of a potential restraining order, there are plenty of other outlets for expressing your most heartfelt romantic emotions. Take "The Wedding Singer"'s Robbie Hart, for example, who offered the object of his affection an original song. 
Regardless of how the sentiment is expressed, there also appears to be a particular pattern that might help us all select Ms. or Mr. Right. Straight­laced, uptight males should be seek­ing their more cheerful and eccentric counterpart in the women they date. This formula proves to be flawless in the films "Pretty Woman" and "Along Came Polly." 
Though, this trend is not strictly limited to typical romantic comedies. Even films with critical acclaim and audiences within more of an indie market point to the "opposites attract" paradigm. "Garden State" and "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" offer similarly-con­structed relationships. Shy, brooding boy meets kooky or volatile girl, and voila! A life-altering love affair ensues. 
Finally, as the movies have it, in order to cement a Hollywood-esque romance, it is essential that you take part in any of the following: literally bumping-into someone, some kind of chase or embracing in front of a crowd. Ideally, this should happen in the rain while a ballad plays in the background. 
With such realistic representations of relationships in film that can be attained through following narrative conventions, it's a wonder why any of us struggle with relationships in the first place.

VIDEO GAME REVIEW 
'Colossus' a fanas 
By MARK BEMENDERFER Assistant Scene Editor 
"Shadow of the Colossus" is a cinematic masterpiece. It's not the latest Hollywood blockbuster, nor an independent cinema production. It is a game for the PlayStation 2 and is completely different from any other game available. 
The game follows the notion that beauty lies in simplicity. The story is minimal, as the player is never completely certain what is going on. All that is known is a girl is possi­bly dying, or may be already dead. The pro­tagonist takes the girl to an isolated temple, where a disembodied voice promises to restore her if the colossi are slain. Who the girl is, or the protagonist is, are never explained. Why the world is so empty is also never explained. It is simple, but it is within that simplicity that an awe-inspiring cine­matic genius is found. 
Stripped down to its base nature, "Shadow of the Colossus" is a series of video game boss battles. Before every boss, the player is given a general direction in which to travel. The digital avatar then travels through the landscape, navigating cliffs and valleys on horseback, before confronting the boss. The bosses themselves take only a few minutes to dispatch, and then the player moves onto the next one . 
But to boil the game down to that descrip­tion would be to deny what makes the game, in a word, beautiful. The world in which the game resides is fantastic and is the equiva­lent to any Peter Jackson blockbuster. Almost completely devoid of life, it manages to convey a sense of sorrow, isolation and grandness in scope that has to be seen to be believed. Whether one is traveling along the edge of a cliff, or through the dry bed of a lake, the game is always equally gorgeous, pushing the aging PlayStation 2 hardware to its limits. 
It is the small touches that make the land so vibrant and add to the isolation of the experience. The player can travel through the game without observing any signs of life for minutes, and then a solitary hawk will appear to follow avatar. Just as quickly as it appears, it will disappear, leaving the player alone once again. Instances like this remind the player that they world is not completely empty, but that it is a lonely place. 
This majestic, isolated qualities are also used to describe the colossi in the game. Each colossus is unique and magnificent in scope, often dwarfmg the player. They wan­

VIDEO GAME REVIEW 
'DDR Extreme· 2' a 
By MARK BEMENDERFER Assistant Scene Editor 
The latest iteration of the college party game of choice has been released. It's not the next "Halo" or "Smash Brothers," how­ever. It is "Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2" for the PlayStation 2 and continues the brand's tradition of excellence. 
"Dance Dance Revolution," or as it is more commonly known, "DDR," is a rhythm-based video game in which players are encouraged to groove to a gamut of different songs. While it is possible to play the game using the standard controller, that is generally not the preferred method by any "Dance Dance Revolution" fan. Dance mats can be pur­chased and used in conjunction with the game, which is the tool of choice when play­ing the game. 
A new tool was added, however, with the original "Dance Dance Revolution Extreme." The Sony Eyetoy can now be used with the game to increase the depth of the game play. Instead of simply using feet to play the game, hands are also used. The Eyetoy plays a real-time video of the player, casting them upon the screen. This increases the game's usefulness as a social event. 
However, the main draw for every "Dance Dance Revolution" game is the music. Previous versions were known for their use of Japanese pop, and remakes of famous songs. Some Western music was employed, such as with the use of Dirty Vegas and Kylie Minogue. But the majorities of the songs were techno, or of the aforementioned pop variety. · 
"Dance Dancer Revolution Extreme 2" knows its history and follows this trend. The majority of the songs are once again techno remixes and Japanese pop. Fan favorites such as "Dive," "Brilliant 2U" and "Dynamite Rave" all make reappearances, among other returning favorites. Other favorites have been remixed, such as Captain Jack, "Candy <3" and "Sana Mollete Ne Ente (B.L.T. Style)." 
Despite this emphasis on techno and pop, some of the new songs will appeal to fans of popular American music. Sean Paul makes an addition to the music library with "Get Busy," while Beyonce Knowles lends "Crazy 
in Love." There is a grand total of 7 4 songs in the game, with 50 of them initially locked. They can be unlocked through com­pleting challenges of varying difficulty in the game. 
The only truly new addition to the series is the use of an online mode however. For the first time, "Dance Dance Revolution" fans on the PlayStation 2 can play the game online. However, the game is vastly more fun and

Music fans rocked out Saturday at Saint Mary's first ever Battle of the Bands competition. A crowd of approx­imately 50 people gathered in the College's student center to listen to four bands and two solo artists, all Saint Mary's and Notre Dame students. 
The performers were competing to open for the nationally-touring group Phantom Planet when they play at "SMC Tostal" this spring. The winner also received 24 hours studio record­ing time. 
Emo-rock band Somersault opened the show and was well received by the crowd as they preformed three origi­nal songs. Their music got everyone out of their seats and gathered around the stage. 
Following Somersault was solo artist Robbie Hazen. Hazen really worked the crowd, performing five cover songs while asking the audience to sing along if they knew the words. He also sang three original songs and infused humor into his set, making fun of his roommate with one of his songs, which the crowd seemed to really enjoy. 
Slap Bracelet Suicide, the self-pro­claimed "only metal band at Notre Dame" took the stage next, treating the crowd to non-stop music with great beats. The audience really got into their set, dancing and yelling for the band. 
"I liked how Slap Bracelet Suicide interacted with the crowd," stated audience member Lindsey Appelquist "They were different from the Notre Dame norm, which was a welcome contrast." 
The crowd seemed to dwindle after intermission, though they missed another crowd favorite, two-man group Hyde. At the beginning of the four-song set, people were still trick­ling back into the concert, though after the first song Hyde played, most were riveted. 
"The lyrics were original and seemed heartfelt," stated student Deirdre Hayden. "The piano was a nice touch too." 
While Slap Bracelet Suicide got a heavy amount of praise when they 
were announced, it seemed as though Hyde won the crowd over by the end of their set with their subdued sounds. 
The second to last performer, Hyan Connaughton, also played cover songs. He got everyone singing when he played his acoustic version of the pop­ular Fall Out Boy Song "Sugar We're Goin' Down." lie had an interesting voice and kept the attention of the crowd throughout all five of his songs. 
The final performer of the evnning was the group Speedplay, which brought the energy of the show back up for its finale. They had to think fast when their guitarist's string broke at the end of the first song, but they held on to the crowd throughout. 
While all of the bands provided something for all musical tastes, the judges had to choose one to take the top prize. The judges, music producer and sound engineer Ulysses Noriega and the indie-rock band Thornbird, chose Slap Bracelet Suicide for first place. Before announcing the winners, the judges stated that there had been a lot of disagreement between them. However, Francesca Johnson, presi­dent of the Class of 2009, claril'ied later in the evening that the judges said Slap Bracelet Suicide showed a lot of creativity for that particular type of music. 
All the performers from Saturday received studio time, and Hobbie Hazen, who came in second place, also won a Thursday spot at Legends. 
The disagreement over the winner did not just stay between the judges. 
"Hyde was poorly placed because they had original lyrics, which was mesmerizing," said audience member Valerie Patterson. 
The Battle of the Bands raised money to benefit Hiley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis. It was the first of the fundraisers planned by the freshman board to raise money for this cause, which will culminate in the Dance Marathon in April. 
"We're still looking for dancers," Johnson adds.

Dick Jauron speaks at a press conference Monday announcing his hiring as head coach of the Buffalo Bills. Jauron had a 35-46 record in his only other NFL head coaching position, a five year stint with the Bears. 
Buffalo chooses Jauron to coach Bills in 2006 
Associated Press 

OHCHAHD PARK, N.Y. -Diek Jauron didn't need to attend Yale to learn what it'll take to make his second stint as an NFL head coach more suecessful than his first. 
"In our business, it comes out in wins and losses. And if you win, it was a great decision. And if you don't win, it was not a great deci­sion," Jauron said Monday after being hired by the Buffalo Bills. "And we know that our baek is against the wall to win." 
Jauron coached the Chieago Bears for five sea­sons, going 35-46 with one playoff appearance before being fired in 2003. It's a resume that even he acknowledges could cause some skeptieism among Bills fans. 
But it didn't stop Hall of Fame coach and new Buffalo general manager Marv Levy from picking Jauron to replace Mike Mularkey, who abruptly resigned two weeks ago. 
Jauron becomes Buffalo's fourth coach since Levy retired after the 1997 sea­son. And he takes over a team that's coming ofT a 5­11 season and missed the playoffs for the sixth straight year. 
Hiring Jauron is Levy's 
IN BRIEF 

Bulls fan will not sue Davis,
wife for incident in stands 
CHICAGO -The Chieago Bulls fan whose confrontation with Antonio Davis' wife led the Knieks forward to rush into the stands will not sue the player and his family. 
In a joint statement released Monday, Michael Axelrod and the Davises said: "It's clear that the episode at the United Center last week, and its aftermath, evolved from some misunderstandings. This has produced regrets from all parties involved. Common sense strongly sug­gests that we colleetively put this episode behind us and move on. That's what the Davises and Michael Axelrod plan to do, and we hope everyone else will, as well." 
Axelrod's attorney, Jay Paul Deratany, said in a telephone inter­view: "Both sides expressed regret for any miscommunieation that occurred. Both parties want to move forward ­with being a fan and watching the game and being a ballplayer. They've first decision since replae­ing president/GM Tom Donahoe, who was fired three weeks ago. And Levy, who attended Harvard, said he had no bias in seleeting a fellow Ivy Leaguer in Jauron, who graduated from Yale with a history degree. 
"We were seleeting the best head coaeh, the man who was going to direct it and put it all together," Levy said. 
Jauron had only one win­ning season with Chicago, going 13-3 in 2001 when he was named the NFJ:s eoaeh of the year. 
A eandidate for the Bills job when Mularkey was hirnd in 2004, Jauron spent the past two seasons as the Detroit Lions defensive eoordinator and finished last season as thn team's interim head coach after Steve Mariueci was firnd in late Novembnr. 
Jauron's hiring was backed by Bills guard Chris Villarrial, who played with the Bears during .Jauron's entire tenure. 
"You guys will sen and Buffalo fans ltre going to see that he's a true li10tball eoach, a down-to-earth guy and a winner," Villarrial said. 'The fastnr we get this thing turned around, it's going to be much better f(Jr him and for us." 

expressed their regret and that's good enough for the family. And we're sat­isfied with the result." NCAA to release RPI ratings
for first time to public INDIANAPOLIS-The NCAA men's and women's basketball tournament committees will begin releasing the Hatings Percentage Index on their Web site beginning next week. 
It marks the first time the NCAA will publicly release the RPI ratings, which are used to help select the postseason tournament fields. Updated rankings can be found at http://www.ncaasports.com from Feb. 2 through the rest of the season. 
"One of the committees' primary objectives over the last few years has been to increase the transpareney and understanding regarding the process of selecting teams for the tournament," said Craig Littlepage, chairman of the Division I men's selection committee. "We think that announcing the results of the RPI ranking on a weekly basis has its ben­

CONCOHD, N.C. -Toyota is plan­ning to move up to NASCAH's top two stock ear series and not evnrybody is happy about it. 
The Japanese automaker, whid1 has competed in NASCAH's Craftsman Truck S1~ries the past two seasons, announced Monday it will also run its Camry brand in both the Nextel Cup and Busch Series in 2007.

Top dogs: UConn grabs No. 1 spot 

Georgetown seventh Big East team in top 25; ties all-time record 
Associated Press 
UConn is No. 1; one of seven Big East teams in top 25 
With no more unbeaten teams left, Connecticut took over the No. 1 spot in The Associated Press college basketball poll Monday. 
Two days after Duke, Florida and Pittsburgh lost, the Huskies (16-1) moved from No. 3 to the top of the rankings for the sixth time in school history and the first since a one-week run in December 2004. The Blue Devils, Gators and Panthers were the last three undefeated Division I teams. 
The Huskies are one of seven 
Big East teams in the Top 25, in anything but it's not great at this time of year. I want it at the beginning of April, but I'll take it now," Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun said Monday. "Being No. 1 isn't a goal of ours like the Big East championship or the national championship, but we feel we're one of the better programs in the country for the last 15 years and being No. 1 is another notch for us as a total program." 
Duke was No. 1 on seven bal­lots and had 1,711 points. Memphis and Texas each moved up one place to third and fourth, respectively. 
Following Florida was Villanova (13-2), which received one first-place vote, Gonzaga, Illinois, West Virginia and Washington. 
West Virginia is in the top 10 for the first time since the 

Mountaineers "Just look at the top 10 team 
Georgetown was last ranked for the first eight polls of the 2001-02 season. The previous March was the last NCAA tour­nament appearance for the Hoyas, who were 0-3 against ranked teams before beating the Blue Devils. 
"I tell our guys our success depends on what happens on the court and what people say or think about us is irrelevant especially at this time of the year because it's so early," Hoyas coach John Thompson III said Monday. "There are so many tough teams in our league from top to bottom that there is no time to sit back and enjoy something like the win over Duke. We just have to keep improving as the season goes on."

SKIING 
New Olympics, same old Tomba 
Associated Press 
TURIN, Italy -Asked what advice he'd give Bode Miller, Alberto Tomba threw his head back and let out a roar of laughter that bounced around the hotel lobby's marble noor. 
"Don't win too much," Tomba said during a recent interview with The Associated Press. 
"Then they won't make stuff up about you. Because. if you win all the time, they won't write about your victories," he said, "they'll write about your private life or things you say." 
The man known as La Bomba still is a star in Italy and figures to be in the spot­light during the Feb. 10-26 Turin Olympics-more than seven years after he retired from the slopes. 
He's still burly, still con­cerned about his image (his manager didn't want a pho­tographer present during the hour-long chat with the AP because Tomba had been traveling all day), still charm­ing and quick with a joke. 
Oh, and still fond of refer­ring to himself in the third person. 
Current skiers grew up watching him, some now try to emulate his go-for-broke competitive style, and all would probably love to accom­plish just a fraction of what he did. 
Italy's top skier at the moment and best medal hope for Turin, Giorgio Rocca, calls his predecessor a "legend" and acknowledges: "There is just one Tomba." 
Someone who would never argue with that assessment: Tomba himself. 
After all, this is a man who, after his very first World Cup victory in November 1987, told reporters: "I am really talented." 
Now 39, Tomba is wary when present-day stars such as Miller or Rocca are com­pared to him. Of Hocca, Tomba said: "Hemember, Tomba won the Olympics at 
20. He's already 30. I won 35 slaloms, he's at nine or 10.... There's more to do if you want to be Alberto's heir." 
When Italians speak about the upcoming Olympics, it doesn't take long for Tomba's name to arise. His exploits on and off the course made him an icon. 
Tomba, who said he consid­ered making a comeback about two or three years after retiring, now spends his time making appearances for per­sonal sponsors and as an ambassador for the Turin Olympics. 
He helped lobby the International Olympic Committee when the city bid for these games, and one of his endorsement deals is with a company sponsoring the torch relay. His face beams on billboards around the country, including a giant sign looking out from the ancient Homan amphitheater in Verona. 
When Hocca won a fourth straight World Cup slalom this month, Italian TV made as big a deal over Tomba's reaction to the performance as the race itself. 
Tomba won't be analyzing races during the Olym pies: "I'd rather look an athlete in the eyes and tell him what I think than say things on TV," he said, adding that he occa­sionally offers tips to Italian skiers. 
He'll certainly be part of the show next month. 
That includes the opening ceremony, although Tomba won't acknowledge that he'll be the final torchbearer. Nor will anyone from the Torino Organizing Committee; that honor has traditionally been kept under wraps. 
Everyone in Italy assumes it'll be him. 
'Til be happy if it's me. It would be like another Olympic gold." 
tying the record for most schools from one conference. The Atlantic Coast Conference and Big Ten have each done it twice, and the ACC did it most recently last season. 

Duke (17 -1), which had been No. 1 since the preseason poll, dropped one spot after losing 87-84 at Georgetown on Saturday. The win sent the Hoyas (12-4) into the Top 25 for the first time since Dec. 31, 2001. 
Florida (17 -1). second in the poll the last two weeks, dropped to No. 5 after losing 80-76 at Tennessee on Saturday. The win got the Volunteers (12-3) back in the rankings after being out for four weeks. 
Pittsburgh (15-1) lost 55-50 at St. John's on Saturday and fell from ninth to No. 12. 
Connecticut received 64 first­place votes and 1,790 points from the 72-member national media panel. The Huskies have spent a total of 21 weeks at No. 
1. The longest run was 10 straight polls in 1998-99, when they won the first of their two national championships.

The last five ranked teams were George-town, Louisville, Wisconsin, Oklahoma and Syracuse.

NFL 
Seahawks impress foes with NFC championship win

SI\ATTI.I: -Fnw tnams ram­page through their sehndule tlw way tlw Snahawks did this season, only to lw confronted by so many doubtnrs during the playoffs.

The Seahawks have all that. 
Forget that they are ·3 1/2 point underdogs, hardly sur­prising considnring the AFC is thn stronger conference and the Pittsburgh Stnelers are on an amazing run all thn way from a sixth snPd to tho Sup<~r Bowl.

"No onn is going to give us anything," tight nnd Jerramy Stnvnns said after the 34-14 win over Carolina, a game Seattln so dominated that the l'antlwrs couldn't even come up with any Hxeuses for being routed. "Wn havnn't donn any­thing in thH past." 
But what they are doing in the present is what makes champions. 
First, the Seahawks have the NFL Most Valuable Player, Shaun Alexander. Arter sHtting a league reeord with 28 touch­downs and topping the rush­ing charts, Alexandnr missnd most of the seeond-round playoff win over Washington with a concussion. lie rntu rnod to carry the ball 34 times for a dub-record 132 yards and scored twice against Carolina. 
AIPxandor is Seattle's ol'fen­sivn standby, mueh the same way Emmitt Smith was for Dallas and Terrell Davis was for Denver. There are 11ashier players around him, but he's the focal point. 
"lie's not thH type of guy that just wallows or lays down," All-Pro fullback Mack Strong said of his backfield partner. "lie comes out to compete ... and that's the rea­son he's tho MVP. llo comes out and put up MVP num­bers."

"Seattle is a very admirable team," said All-Pro receiver Steve Smith, who was shut down in the title game after 

sensational performances in first two weeks of the playoffs. "They're very experienced. Everything that team did today was superb." 
The Seahawks were pre­pared for everything Carolina could offer, from Delhomme­to-Smith to Julius PeppHrs and a dangerous defensive line to the ballhawking of cornerback Ken Lucas, a former team­mate. Credit Holmgren and his staff for that. 
Holmgren struggled early in his tenure in Seattle after win­ning one Super Bowl in Green Bay and losing another. But the ups and downs with the Seahawks, including losing some of his front-office con­trol, never steered him in thH wrong direction. 
Nor did tight playoff losses the last two years, first at the Packers in overtime, then at

Still, you have to get every­one to perform, and he's done a wonderful job of it. 
"A couple of things happnn," Holmgren explained. "You have players who won't buy in or never buy in, or you havn guys with problems.

NBA 
Kobe's 81 make guard's next goal a tall order 
Chamberlain's 100 remains the highest NBA total ... for now? 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES Wilt Chamberlain's record 1 00-point game seemed unreachable from the time he accomplished the feat nearly 44 years ago. 
Perhaps it's not. 
Maybe Kobe Bryant can do it. 

"I guess it's possible. I don't know. bro'. It's unthinkable," the Los Angeles Lakers' star said. 
So was 81. At least before Sunday night. 
But Bryant, so often unstop­pable, was better than ever against the Toronto Raptors, scoring 28 of his team's 31 points in the fourth quarter to reach the second-highest sin­gle-game total in NBA history. 
"Not even in my dreams," he said. 
Chamberlain scored 100 points when basketball was a far different game, accomplish­ing the feat for Philadelphia against the New York Knicks at Hershey, Pa., on March 2, 1962. 
There was no 3-point shot ­not that it would have mattered since Chamberlain was a 7 -foot­er who dominated the middle. 
The 6-6 Bryant made seven from outside the are. Defense was generally an afterthought when Chamberlain 
played. not that the Haptors are much good at it now. ranking near the bottom of the league in that department. 
Whatever the case, both per­formances were astonishing. 
Chamberlain shot 36-of-63 from the field and 28-of-32 from the foul line while playing all 48 minutes. He averaged an NBA-record 50.4 points per game that season. 
Bryant, playing a little less than 42 minutes, shot 28-of-46 from the llt)()r including 7 -of-13 from 3-point range, and 18-of­20 from the foul line. l-Ie raised his NBA-leading average to 35.9 points. If the season ended now, that would be the highest aver­age since Michael Jordan scored 37.1 points per game 19 years ago. 
Bryant appeared on his way to 80 a month ago, scoring a then-career high 62 in a one­sided win over Dallas. He sat out the fourth quarter because the outcome was decided after three. 
Not so Sunday night. The Raptors led by as many as 18 in the third period, and that more than anything triggered Bryant's scoring explosion, which led to a 122-104 Los Angeles victory. 
"We have four days off com­ing up here and I would be sick as a dog if we would have lost this game," he said. "I just wanted to step up and inspire us to play well and it turned into something pretty special." 


Indeed, it did as Bryant recorded just the 1Oth game ever of at least 70 points. 
Chamberlain scored 59 in the second half in his big game ­the only player with more points in a half than Bryant's 55 after halftime in this game. 
In the second half, it was Bryant 55, Toronto 42. 
"IIe couldn't be stopped tonight," Haptors guard Mike James said. "lie basically beat us by himself." 
Chamberlain's second-highest total was 78 against the Lakers in three overtimes on Dec. 8, 1961. That drops to No. 3 on the all-time list. 
Next are the 73 points scored twice by Chamberlain in 1962 and once by Denver's David Thompson in 1978. 
The only other players to reach 70 were former Lakers star Elgin Baylor, who scored 71 points in November 1960, and David Robinson, who also scored 71 for San Antonio in April 1994. Chamberlain scored 70 in 1963. 
Bryant broke Baylor's fran­chise record with 4:25 remain­ing on a 14-footjumper. 
"Scoring 81 points is a truly amazing accomplishment," Baylor, general manager of the Clippers, said in a statement. "Of course, the most important thing is that his effort con­tributed to a victory for his team."

TENNIS 
Hingis reaches Australian Open quarterfinals 

·Federer commits 58 errors, needs all five sets to defeat Haas 
Associated Press 
MELBOURNE, Australia ­Martina Hingis' comeback has gone so smoothly that she's in . the Australian Open quarterfi­nals following a three-year lay­off. 
Back on the tour for just three weeks, the three-time Australian Open champion advanced Monday with a 6-1, 7­6 (8) victory over Samantha Stosur 6-1, 7-6 (8) and will face second-seeded Kim Clijsters. 
Ilingis needed four match points to beat Stosur. The five­time Grand Slam winner, who dropped off the tour because of ankle, heel and foot injuries, returned to competitive tennis Jan. 2 and hasn't lost a set at this tournament. 
"I started off very well, I knew that I had to be right there from thH' start -we both probably were very nervous," llingis said. "I knew I couldn't give her any momentum." 
On the men's side, top-ranked Roger Federer overcame an uncharacteristic 58 errors in his 6-4, 6-0, 3-6, 4-6, 6-2 fourth-round win over Tommy Haas. 
"I was really trying to just break his momentum. Tommy was making it difficult for me to play," Federer said. "To be hon­est, I like to be pushed like this." 
Hingis was in vintage form, working Stosur around with angled volleys, drop shots, pin­point lobs and a stunning, run­ning forehand crosscourt win­ner. 
But the 25-year-old twice missed chances to serve for the match in the second set and wasting three match points in the tiebreaker before convert­ing on a Stosur error. 
"I played really well the first 1 1/2 sets," she said. 
Stosur was the last Aussie in the draw and had the partisan crowd on her side. Clusters of people in pink shirts embla­zoned with "Smash 'em Sam" and waving inflatable kanga­roos chanted for her from the stands. 
Hingis became a favorite at Melbourne when she won her first Grand Slam title age 16 and won three finals in succes­sion. She lost three in a row from 2000-2002, including an '02 defeat to Jennifer Capriati when she wasted four match 
points.  
In  her  absence,  Clijsters  
became  known  locally  as  
"Aussie  Kim"  during  her  

engagement to Lleyton Hewitt -which ended last year -and remains popular. 
They're two of the six current or former No. 1-ranked players into the quarterfinals -a record for a Grand Slam tour­nament. Top-ranked Lindsay Davenport, No. 3 Amelie Mauresmo, No. 4 Maria Sharapova, No. 8 Justin 1-lenin­llardenne are the others. 
Davenport and llenin-Hardennc meet Tuesday, while 2004 Wimbledon champion Sharapova goes against fellow Russian Nadia Petrova. 
After Federer crashed simph1 overheads into the net in ·the third and fourth sets, he regained an unwavering calm opening the fifth, when he hit 18 of his 66 winners and cut his errors to six. 
Federer was 8-9 in five-set matches, including a 2-6 run from his loss to former No. 2­ranked llaas here in the same round in 2002. 

NFL 
Steelers find themselves in unfarrriliar position -favorites 
Associated Press 
PITTSBURGH -Uh, oh, those king-of-the-road Pittsburgh Steelers aren't going to like this, not at all. 
They are four-point favorites to beat the Seattle Seahawks in the Super Bowl on Feb. 5 in Detroit after being underdogs against Indianapolis and Denver in their last two playoff games. 
That means the Steelers can no longer recite that nobody's­picking-us theme that has car­ried them through seven con­secutive victories, all but two away from home. They can no longer say that they're flying under the radar and are being overlooked even as they take down one higher-seeded team after another. 
No wonder linebacker Joey Porter, the demonstrative and very confident leader of Pittsburgh's defense, was prac­tically begging oddsmakers to make the NFC champion the favorite following the Steelers' 34-17 AFC championship game victory over Denver on Sunday. 
"Nobody's been pickin' us, don't jump on the bandwagon now," Porter said. "People are still crying about the Colts, and their stuff has been over for a week now. So pick them (the Seahawks) so we can keep our edge." 
Of course, Porter might not have felt that way if he knew the Steelers are 4-0 when favored to win the Super Bowl, as they were in the 1974, 1975, 1978 and 1979 seasons, and 0­1 as underdogs, by 13 1/2 points before losing 10 years ago to the Cowboys 27-17 in Tempe, Ariz. 
If nothing else, the Steelers' remarkable and unequaled playoff run also has quieted talk that they didn't have enough quality r()ceivers to give Ben Roethlisberger much help when opposing defenses stack the line of scrimmage to shut down the run -as the Colts and Broncos did the last two weeks. 
Hines Ward's credentials can't be disputed as a four-time Pro Bowl receiver, but there were considerable doubts when the playoffs started about whether No. 2 receiver Antwaan Randle El (no touchdown catches since the first game of the season) and No. 3 receiver Cedrick Wilson (no TO catches all sea­son) could be reliable and pro­ductive. 
But with Roethlisberger com­ing out throwing in each of the last two games, look what those receivers have done. 

Wilson, who questioned at midseason if he should have signed with a team that throws as little as the Steelers do, had five catches for 92 yards and a TO in Denver and has two scor­ing catches in the postseason. Randle El has nine catches and· a touchdown. And rookie Nate Washington, an undrafted rook­ie from Tiffin University, made his first NFL catch Sunday to keep the Steelers' first scoring drive going. 
Apparently, it hasn't been 


only Roethlisberger, Jerome scoring Bengals, Colts and Bettis and a defense that has Broncos that have gotten the allowed 1 7, 18 and 17 points Steelers to only their second respectively against the high-Super Bowl in 26 years.

remaining, Notre Dame man­aged to make just one field goal the rest of regulation, and only a missed three-pointer at the buzzer by Georgetown's Katie Carlin saved the Irish vic­tory. 
McGraw said she has a plan for the Irish to stay on their toes against a top foe. 
"I think we just have to stay aggressive," she said. "I think we do need to control the tempo a little bit." 
Part of the problem for Notre Dame in control­ling the tempo 

will be Rutgers' "When we go into a and 8 versatile lineup. game when we're the rebounds.

"We had a little more confi­dence going into the DePaul game probably because we weren't expected to win," she said. "When we go into a game when we're the underdogs, we have a great record against top-25 teams." 
Notes: 
+ Notre Dame senior guard Megan Duffy was named Big East player of the week after leading the Irish past DePaul and Georgetown last week. In the game against DePaul, Duffy

Sophomore Matee Ajavon is central in the Scarlet Knights' offense, second on Rutgers in assists (3.8) and points (11) per game, while only starting eight of 16 contests. 
The only one to top Ajavon in each category is Rutgers top offensive threat, senior guard Cappie Pondexter. Pondexter leads all Scarlet Knights with 22 points and 3. 9 assists per game. 
McGraw said the challenge of

"She's the heart and soul of our team -a great leader for us," McGraw said. "She makes us go."

Mike Brey said. "From that standpoint the glass is half full, and we have to keep plugging. If our four losses were by an aver­age of 15 points, I could song and dance you. but we have some issues. 
"We're down to game situa­tions, and we just have to be a little bit better." 
To swing the season this week, Notre Dame must face Georgetown tonight and Villanova (13-2, 4-1) on Saturday in back-to-back home games. The Irish then go on the road Feb. 1 to meet West Virginia, the only undefeated team (5-0) in conference play. 
The Hoyas are tied with Cincinnati and St. John's for the fourth-best Big East record. Playing within the Princeton oflimse implemented by second­year coach John Thompson III, four Georgetown players sport double-digit scoring averages along a balanced box score. 
Senior forward Brandon Bowman leads the Hoyas with 
11.9 points per game, followed closely by center Roy Hibbert 
(11.3 points per game), guard Ashanti Cook (10.3) and for­ward Jeff Green (10.3). 
Bowman had 23 points, eight rebounds and three blocks in the win over Duke. 
Brey said he does not antici­pate having to drastically alter his lineup to deal with a larger Hoyas team. But the coach said he knows this Georgetown team well from last year's win and additional observation, and the 

Irish guard Chris Quinn dribbles before Michigan's Dion Harris 
on Dec. 3. 
players know defense will be a factor against a hot offensive team. 
"If you look at their team, they shot 60-some percent against a good Duke defense," Irish point guard Chris Quinn said. "It's definitely something we have to take a look at." 
Notre Dame is 1-1 at home in Big East play, its lone confer­ence win being a 92-77 victory over Providence Jan. 14. 
But the Irish have not played at the Joyce Center since the return of the University's stu­dents. 
Brey thinks a more normal game atmosphere can only help his team, despite their oppo­nents' strengths. 
"[Georgetown is] the sexiest team in the country," Brey said. "!just hope we can hang in there with them. They're really good. They're really hot. They're really confident. I'm just happy our home atmos­phere will be kind of our normal atmosphere." 
Notre Dame sits above only DePaul (1-5), who beat the Irish 73-67 on Jan. 7, and South Florida in league standings. Louisville and Providence are each 1-4 and tied with the Irish in-conference.

Nerve 1 RAC'ing 
Team enters hostile Rutgers arena on two-game win streak 
By KEN FOWLER Spores Writer 
Notre Dame head coach Muffet McGraw knows the No. 21 Irish will have their hands full tonight when they travel to the hostile confines of the Rutgers Athletic Center (RAC) in Piscataway, N.J., to take on the No. 9 Scarlet Knights. 
"If you look at our history there, it's always been a tough place to play, and Tuesday won't be an exception," McGraw said Monday in a Big East conference call. 
Rutgers (13-3'0verall, 5-0 Big East) is 6-2 at the RAC against the Irish since joining the Big East and has lost only once there -last week to Temple ­since the 2003-04 season. 
Notre Dame (12-5, 3-3) bare­ly defeated Georgetown Saturday in the much different atmosphere of McDonough Arena, where 1,106 fans filled a high school-style gymnasium. 
Tonight, the Irish will try to avoid a repeat performance of their second-half near-melt­down against the Hoyas -but in the rowdy RAC.

Recruits remain 1n the family 
By DAN MURPHY Sporrs Writer 
Three years in a row, the Notre Dame swimming and diving team has landed its best recruiting class in school history. Last year, however, was slightly easier for head recruiter Matt Tallman. Of the eight new freshmen this year, three -Bill Bauman, David Cavadini and Danny Lutkus-join older brothers already swimming for the Irish. 
Having experience with the three families helped Tallman with his decision-making, 
"Just knowing who they were, they stood above a pack of kids who were at a similar level," Tallman said. 
"We went after them since we knew their baekground and how their brothers had improved." 
Looking at the track record of Doug Bauman, Jamie Lutkus ­both seniors -and junior Louis Cavadini, it is no mystery why Tallman was interested in their younger brothers. Doug Bauman and Jamie Lutkus both own school records in the 100 back­stroke and 400 individual medley (IM), respectively.

16-year old Oglesby at top of junior class 
Irish plan to sign six senior 0-linemen 
By MIKE GILLOON Sports Editor 
Fifteen of the country's top 100 high school juniors were among the players to attend a recruiting Junior Day held by Irish coach Charlie Weis and his staff earlier this month. 
But according to Mike Frank of Irisheyes.com, the only junior who has a schol­arship offer from Notre Dame was a player who did not even attend the Jan. 14 event -offensive lineman Josh Oglesby. 
The 16-year old Oglesby is a 6-foot-7, 325-pound offen­sive tackle out of Saint Francis High School in St. Francis, Wis. Despite his age, he is one of the top recruits in the nation with offers already from Notre Dame, Ohio State, Tennessee and Michigan, among several oth­ers. 

The Observer could not reach Oglesby for comment Monday. 
He was unable to make it to South Bend for the Junior Day (which coincided with the Irish men's basketball team's 92-77 home victory over Providence) but told Irisheyes.com that he has "not eliminated a school" from his list of potential des­
