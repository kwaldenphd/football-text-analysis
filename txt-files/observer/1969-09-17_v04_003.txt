Turnbull considers academic reform ma1n goal 
by Prudence Wear 
In an interview yesterday, Saint Mary's Student Body President Sue Turnbull said she expects community government to have its most effective year. She feels this will result from a "new sense of cooperation between students, faculty, ami administrators." 
Turnbull said, "There will be problems getting some of our plans through. Many of them arc controversial around here. But, I feel that all arising problems will be workable." 
"Both last year's and this year's freshman classes have been more cooperative than I ever expected. Father McCrath came to our workshops this summer with many exciting ideas. We learned from last year's mistakes. They were groping and I don't feel we arc So I have high hopes for all our plans." . ' 
ller first intention is to deal with the Shuttle Hus fare. 
"We knew nothing at all about a charge to the students. And we're going to get this cleared up immediately." 
Turnbull's main goal will be the examination of academic problems and possibilities. Emphasis will be on re-evaluating the pass-fail system and the freshman and sophomore curriculum, attempting to obtain exemptions from finals for seniors, and exploring the idea of changing the basis of the curriculum from "majors" to "areas of concentration." 
On the probability of obtaining senior exemptions, Turnbull's only comment was "I don't know." 
The plan to change from the concept of majors to areas of concentration has been under consideration for some time. The aim of such a change is to supply the student with "inner disciplinary studies previously lacking." 
One of Turnbull's major goals this year is the precise definition of the role of the Student Affairs Council in community government. She also intends to ask for clarification of the rule on demonstrations. 

Another goal is the strengthening of 
hall government to facilitate on-campus communication. Hall councils will be given more responsibility and a greater allottment of the budget. 
The communication gap between the on-campus students and the day students has been somewhat bridged by the appointment of day-students to_ project chairmanships and Student·-. Services Organization memberships. Turnbull hopes soon to make available lunch passes for them to be purchased at a flat fee. 
Presently being researched is the possibility of Off Campus housing to be in effect by next fall. 
"The argument before was that the buildi_ng of the sister dorm to McCandless 
would monetarily necessitate the college 
to demand on-campus living. Now, in 
principle they can't oppose it. The money 
didn't come in, yet, and they have

The Student Body President's personal

"This year I want all the stuuents

by Cliff Wintrode 
and Joe Cottrell 

The co-exchange program between Notre Dame and St. Mary's reached a new dimension of cooperation last night as each school took turns hosting a romp through their residence halls. 
Notre Dame initiated the evening's festivities when after the Dillon Hall pep rally they spontaneously decided to stage a preemptive raid on Holy Cross Hall. Without pausing to stop and ask for panties, the guys plunged into the hallway and adjacent rooms. 
After roaming through the corridors for over ten minutes, some were still inside thirty minutes later, the raiders headed for Le Mans, which fell within seconds to the human seige. 
The crowd lost their fire after roaming through Le Mans and the raid reached its end in the halls of McCandless. 
The Notre Dame students were predictably quite enthusiastic and delirious with excitement and joy at the conclusion. 
"I've heard about Notre Dame 
spirit but I never knew it was 
like this." 
"I wish the girls had had more clothes to give away." 
The men were quite

welcome that the belles of St.

NO TRANSPORTATION NECESSARY 
by Chuck Darst 
About 80 people attended the first meeting of the Coalition for Political Action last night in O'Shaughnessy Hall. Chuck Leoni conducted the meeting and said, "The CPA is an organization formed to meet the changing need of the Notre Dame-South Bend community for semi-independent, project oriented groups with a radical outlook. Each group will have a particular project and will operate in an autonomous 
manner within its ownt particular area." One of these groups, coordinated by Tim MacCarry, is involved in community research. 
MacCarry noted that present sociology textbooks and the media do not really "tell it like it is" and that there is a definite need for a new intellectual analysis of America. He went on to say that the purpose of his group is to first get people together who are interested in constructing a new radical analysis of the social structure in the Notre Dame-South Bend community, and then "cross-fertilize" this information with other aspects of the Coalition. 
Junior John Wilson from Students Against Racism said that they hoped to educate the students as to the evils of racism, 
change their thinking as much as. possible, and hopefully certain structures that perpetuate racism. 
Chuck Leoni disclosed suggested CPA actions in conjunction with the October 15th Vietnam War Moratorium. Among the possibilities were: a march to the ROTC building and reading of the list of Notre Dame war dead, a teach-in and rally with guest speakers, fasting on an individual basis, a religious celebration-perhaps a Mass-where students might turn in their draft cards, and a formal Catholic exorcism of the ROTC building. 

Brian Mcinerney said that one reason radical efforts like the Dow-CIA sit-in last fall were not too successful is because not enough work was done to educate people and create sentiment, and that CPA hopes to conduct discussions in all the halls prior to any CPA actions concerning how, why, and if such actions should be taken. 
Professor Douglas of the Department of Non-Violence also spoke, saying that inspite of stiffer sentences, the number of people resisting the draft has grown to what the government would consider epidemic proportions. 
He cited that of the 275 men to be inducted in Oakland on August 14th, only 155 actually reported. And of those, 35 refused induction. 
Planned shuttle fare attacked 
(continued from page 1) 
additional monies the university received as a result of tuition hikes has been used for raises in faculty salaries, and for an inflationary rise in operating costs. Student Union is operating on a tight budget this year, because of the need to pay off the debts accumulated by previous Student Governments, so they are not in a position to provide the service free of charge either. 
Susan Turnbull, Student Body President of St. Mary's was critical of both the decision, and its timing. 
"The Student Government knew nothing about (the decision to charge a dime) until T h u r s d a y morning," she claimed, "We were not told that there would be a charge for the students." 
Miss Turnbull pointed out that both the Saint Mary's and Notre Dame student governments had been asked by 
the university for $5,000 apiece tor tne snutue ous service. ''The bus costs the university $6.50 an hour. If all the girls at SMC took a round trip on the bus once a week, at a

dime a ride, the students would e n d up paying over $6,000 per year," Miss Turnbull claimed 
Por further SMC reaction, see Jeannne Sweeny's story on the meeting of the SMC legislature. 
Shuttle bus fo change route 
Due to the expanded Notre Dame Saint Mary's co-exchange program, there will be increased shuttle bus service between the two schools. 
This year, there will be buses every fifteen minutes, between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 4: 30, during the week. After 4:30 one bus will run until 12: 15. On weekends, one bus will run, until 
2:30 in the morning. 
The route this year has also been changed. The first stop will be the library circle, then the stadium, the waiting room at the circle, the ROTC building, and the grotto. 
Due to the increased service the University has chartered the buses from the South Bend Public Transportation. The buses and drivers will be the same as those in South Bend. 
The increase in service has generated a rise in costs. The university has deemed it necessary to charge a dime per passenger after 6 p.m. The reason being that the university 
felt it did not have to "subsidize the social lives of the students" according to Tim Collins, Stude~t Union Manager of Transporta­tion.

CPA to deal with rac1sm, ROTC, other ISSUeS 
by Cliff Wintrode 
This summer Notre Dame was the scene of the birth of the Coalition for Political Action. The Coalition was formed to address itself to national as well as to local issues. 
Fred Dedrick, Student Body Vice-President and one of the founders of the coalition, explained that the purpose of the Coalition was twofold: 
"First, we will try to set up a liberal to leftist organization that would be able to respond to certain situations which require some sort of action. Second, we will probably be essentially an organization which will work with other groups and try to be available to help them in any way they can usc us." 
Ed Roickle, a member of the 
coalition, elaborated on this 
idea. He said that the coalition 
"is not a party at all, not 
political" in the Sl'nsc that it will 
not put up candidates for 
election of campus offices nor 
will it endorse candidates. 
Chuck Leoni, in commenting on tht organizational structure of the walition, said, "We are setting up projects. The structure will evolvr from the projects." 
The force of the coalition was 
noticed by nearly all the 
fr.~shman class as the coalition, 
in conjunction with individuals 
from the Sttdents Against 
J<.acism grou 1, s.:nt out letters to 
the parents on the subject of an 
"Anti-Racism Project" that was 
started at Notre Dame. 
l'hil McKenna, Student Body 
Presidl~nt and primary author of 
the Jette as a member of the coalition stated that: "It is our <im to um·eil to each member of the univer!.IIy community the racism inherent in both individuals and institutions." 
The letter went on to urge that upon realization of this inherent racism, the Notre Dame community should undertake a program of remedial education which was considered the primary method of attacking racism, followed by preparation to act. 
"We feel that this two-fold approach of educ;tion and action is essential to the ;'roject's true success." 
Roickle. in defending the a~·; :rtion in tl>e letter that the racism in our university and society was "more unconscious than conscious, more covert than overt, and more behavioral than attitudinal" answered: 
"We can legislate open housing. We can not legislate against racism. We have to change their hearts." 
In the same envelope as the anti-racism letter, the coalition sent out a letter to "present a more accurate picture of the limitations and obligations" of the ROTC program than is given by ROTC during orientation. 
The Coalition's counter efforts were centered around four arguments why a student should delay a decision on whether or not to join ROTC. 
First consideration was directed at the moral decision a student makes while not "seriously considering the implications involved." They felt that to "decide to join ROTC before a thorough investigation of the theological, philosophical, psychological, and sociological consequences would be a mistake." 
Second priority was that ROTC "limits the opportunity of the student to pursue areas of study by requiring him to usc many of his electives in order to take ROTC courses." 
Third, the coalition deplored the situation where a decision will "affect the next ten years of one's life." They mentioned two alternatives: Officer Candidate School and the ROTC two year program. 
The fourth argument was expressed in this way: "Finally the uncertainties of the status of the selective service system make a choice to join ROTC at this time somewhat imprudent." 
The coalition closed the letter asking, as fellow students, "to discuss these (serious issues) with you when you arrive in the fall." 
Leoni said the letter represented a "rational kind of level headed approach which would appeal to parents more than any other way." 
Roickle replied that in the letter "We are not attacking ROTC as such. We are asking people to stop and take a look at both sides of the story because the decision to join ROTC may be one of the most important decisions he will make at the university. It will affect the next few years of his life after graduation."

WASHINGTON (UPI)-The American Bar Association endorsed 1udge Clement F. Haynsworth 1r.'s nomination to the Supreme Court yesterday and said it had found no evidence of conflict of interest in his ruling on a controversial court case in 1963. 
But AFL-CIO President George Meany said Haynsworth was simply unfit to serve as an associate justice. And Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D Mass., questioned whether the 56 year old South Carolinian was enough of a "man of the times" for a court some view as "the last bastion for social change in America."

Engineering Dept 
"Branching," "matrix" and "core course," are a few terms engineers at ~ :otrc Dame will have to add to their vocabulary this fall. The terms do not come from a new branch of science-but from innovations within the College of Engineering. 
During the past year, the college has completely revamped its curriculum, reorganized its faculty, replanned its facilities, and reevaluated its requirements. Dr. 1oseph C. Hogan, dean of the college and chief instigator of the sweeping changes, sees the goal as improved engineering education at all levels. 
"Under the old, departmental system," he explained, "we had unnecessary duplication of effort. Five of our eight departments taught courses in fluid mechanics, some to very small classes. Several departments taught other similar courses, using the ··;a me text." 
Under the new "branching" system of curriculum specialization, such undesirable duplication would not occur. Fluid mechanics would become a "sub-core course, taught by one professor to students of five departments. 
The branching curriculum is so nam~.:d because a student's program begins with general "core" co ursc s, progresses through the more specialized "sub-core" courses, and finally ends with the highly specialized "departmental" courses. 
The College Council, an advisory body in the college, created the core program to give students the basic science, e ngi nee ring and humanities every cngi neeri ng graduate needs. All students in the Co II e g e of Engineering are required to take the core series. 
The next level of specialization is the sub-core ourscs taught to the students of two or more departments. For 
. i nstancc, mechanical and aerospace engineers might share similar courses until late in their programs, while electrical 
engineers would branch out earlier into their specialties. At the level of greatest specialization is the departmental course, taught only to students of one department. 
Students will also gain by the recommended lowering of degree requirements from 140 to I28 credits. 
"About I20 to 128 credits is the range of credits required at colleges of cngmcenng around the country," Hogan explained. "Even so, the student will have to take 16 credits a semester to graduate in four years." 
The new curriculum also gains from the decreased duplication of effort created by better 
Assembly will study shuttle bus finances 
by Jeanne Sweeny 
At the first meeting for this 
academic year, the St. Mary's 
Student Assembly took action 
on the newly established ten 
cent fare for the shuttle bus 
conncding the St. Mary's and 
Notre Dame campuses. 
Student Body Vice President Beth Driscoll, who chairs the Student Assembly, proposed a rcsolr. ·ion to investigate the fare which is effective after 6 PM every evening. 
Miss Driscoll called for an "investigation into the financing of the shut tic bus," which is operated by the South Bend City Bus Co., but is financed by Notre Dame and St. Mary's. Aceo rding to the proposal passed unianimously by the assembly, the funds allocated for the bus' expense will be frozen pending the outcome of the investigation. 
The purpose of this in vcstigafion 1s to examine "certain difficulties and m is u n d c r standings in the financing of the said service." 
The difficulties discussed were 
the gross overcharge of ten cents 
and what will be done with the 
receipts which will come from 
this new system. 
The Assembly also confirmed the executive cabinet's appointment of nine girls to the academic committees of the College. These girls will be the first students to hold scats on their respective academic committees. 
Sally Trippel and Fran Nixon were approved by the Assembly for the Admissions and Scholarship Committee. Miss Trippel is a senior day student who has worked in the student aid office for three years, and Fran Nixon is a senior staff student who has a great interest in this committee. 
Marilyn Reidy, a senior, will be seated on the Academic Standing Committee. 
The library committee will have two new members, one a senior, Carolyn Bayer, and Jeanne Luczai, a junior who has worked in New York public libraries. 
revamped 
communication between departments. The vehicle of improved communication i~ a new body called the "matrix group," composed of faculty from several departments who share a common research j,nterest. For instance, a 
· professor of the department of civil engineering and another from chemical engineering could share an interest in environmental studies. Both would then join the matrix group in the field. The new faculty organization is based around two bodies-the department and the matrix group. There arc now five e ngi n cering departments: aerospace and mechanical engineering, chemical e nginecring, civil engineering, electrical engineering, and metallurgy and material sciences. Seven new matrix groups have been formed so far-with plenty of room for more as the need arises. They arc: electrical sciences, environmental studies, fluid mechanics, materials sciences, solid mechanics, systems, and thermal sciences. In matrix organizatiOn, communication can flow two ways, within and between departments. The departments might be thought of as the columns, crossed by the matrix groups, which provide communication between departments. Under the old departmental plan, only the dean and chairmen needed to approve new course offerings and curriculum changes. Under the matrix organization, however, both the appropriate department and the concerned matrix group must make recommendations on almost every important change within the college. As an example, the matrix group plays a major role in designing courses for the new curriculum. In fact, a core course in solid mechanics would be created from scratch by the solid mechanics matrix group. The appropriate matrix group must also make recommenda­tions on any departmental course related to 1ts field ot mterest. In this way, the group will know if two or more departments plan to offer similar courses, and can suggest offering a sub-core course for students in both departments. 
However, the matrix group is not -theonly change in college reorganization. The departments of aerospace engineering and mechanical engineering recently merged, to form aerospace and mechanical engineering. 
.. Hoth departments have very similar interests," Hogan explained. "In fact, a survey of their courses showed only_ ab~ut

40 credits of difference between the two programs. However, we will continue to offer separate degree programs in the two fields," he added. 
The department of engineering science, which offered highly theoretical courses for students interested in research, will cease to exist as a department, but will continue as a degree program. 
Hogan believes the same degree can be administered more efficiently as a program by an interdisciplinary committee. 
"In fact, we hope to add several interdisciplinary degrees in the future," Hogan explained. "If we offered a bio-medical engineering degree, or an ocean engineering degree, these would be administered in the program format, by staff members interested in these areas." 
Another goal-efficient use of space-becomes more important in view of the college's plan for a new building. The engineering college is already planning laboratory, office, and classroom space for this facility. "The matrix groups will help us design labs that can be used by several departments," Hogan said. 
As an added bonus to the efficiency and flexibility of his new matrix organization, Hogan hopes the matrix groups will stimulate research. 
Validation cards introduced here; 
supplement IDs 
The new validation cards that were issued to all students at registration ate designed to take the place of the combination schedule-certificate of validation paper issued in previous years. 
The validation card will also be used for all embossing which is done at the bookstore and the library. The new freshman ID cards will be flat, with no raised lettering. 
There are six different types of validation cards. Two types for the students of ND and SMC and two types for the staffs and the faculties of both schools. All will be re-issued annually, except student cards, which will be re-issued each semester. 
Some students, especially those accepted to the university late, did not receive their cards. A notice pertaining to this will be issued by the Dean of Students sometime next week. Those freshmen not receiving their cards will get them in the mail with their regular ID cards, within the next two weeks.

hy Jim E. Brogan 
Earlier this summer, Newsweek magazine gave Joe South the review of a lifetime. Superlatives were not enough to describe his latest album, Games l'eople Play. 
After listening to it though, the only reaction can be one of disappointment. It is a good album, but only good. It is not the combination Otis Redding, Johnny Rivcrs, and Scargcnt Pepper that Newsweek made it out to be. It is Joe South's second album and not his best. llis first album, Introspect was a little better but not much. 
(;ames People !'lay starts out strong with the title song. This million seller was one of the best premier singles of the past year. This single song gives us a great insight into what to expect in the remainder of the album. South wrote and produced this sales giant (as he did all the rest of the songs on this album). The words seem to have some well thought out meaning rcsem bling Simon and Garfunkcl's lack of communications hag. 
Oh we make another cr.v; 
Break a heart, then we· .l'ay gooclhye; 
Cross our hearts and we !rope/odie; 
That the other was to blame . .. 
Oh the games fleople play now; 
Hverv night and even' dav now: 
Nev~r meaning what. tire.; say now; 
And never saying what they mean. 
The first side moves on very slowly from here. Included is a completely ridiculous one minute interlude of unintelligible coughing, laughing, and talking. This wasted cut docs little to enhance a very dull side (excepting the title song). The only oth~:r bright spot on this side of the longplay waffle is a tunc entitled Concrete Jungle. Although the lyrical thought sounds like a cross somewhere between the Drifters' Up on tire Roof and the Bcatlcs' flare/ Days Night, his hope of seeking refuge from an impersonal world and finding it in another person is a valid undertaking. While other people have taken this idea and have written great songs, the best Joe South could do was write a good song. 
The last cut on side one of this wax deserves spc~.:ial recognition. It is without a doubt the we~rst song to he written since Rats in my Room about 8 years ago. In case you don't, or don't want to remember this oldie, it was the song of a young man bemoaning his living conditions. The lyrics went something like "I've got a fish in my dish, I've got bears in my hair, and I've got rats in my room." Perhaps hearing this song on an oldie show gave South the inspiration that he needed to write, sing, and produce //ole in Your Soul. It consists of such unforgettable lyrics as: 
You 'vc got ~/ide in your stride . .. 
You got the heat in your feet; 
You're uptight. outa sight: 
Baby, you groove when you move: 
11 nd you grind on my mind; 
You give me rain on the brain. 
It is an unforgivable error that such a weak song is on the same side with his powerful (;ames l'eotJ/e /'lay. 
After a so-so first side, (;amcs starts to pick up momentum. This is achieved through two songs that were hits for Billy Jo Royal a few years hack. Although the front of the alhum cover prodaims that flush and Down in the Uoondocks arc wntaincd in the alhurn, in reality what is heard is /lush and I knew rou When. These were both produced by Joe South for Billy Jo Royal and sounded much better when Billy Jo did them. In fact the version of flush done by the Deep Purple in the summer of llJ6H, which South also produced, ~:omcs off better than his own. flowcvcr these arc bot.h excellent songs. and arc certainly done well cn<)ugh to appL'ar on any album.

book, The /Iuman Condition. A st udcnt of Martin lleiddigcr and Rudolph Bull mann, she has questioned the possibility of doing meaningful speculative thinking and is noted for her analysis of the political man. 
Formerly a prisoner of a Nazi concentration camp, Miss Arendt has also reflected extensively on issues raised in the Jchmann trials -the nature of a totalitarian state, the nature of man's freedom. 
Walter Cronkite, CBS news 
analyst and John Siegenthaler, 
city editor of the Nashville 
Tennessean and formerly 
campaign manager for the late 
Senator Robert Kennedy in 
California, will come to Notre 
Dame in early October. 
According to commJssJoner 
Dowdall, the pair will discuss the 
news-covering versus the 
news-making roles of the press. 
"They'll consider how the 
news media really effect actual 
events and their outcome," said 
the Notre Dame commission 
chief. 

Siegenthaler is also concerned 
about the barring of the press 
from court trials, Dowdall 
added. 

Paul Racoucr, a popular con­temporary theologian will be joining S.I. Hayakawa, San Francisco State's besieged presi­dent, and six other scholars in­cluding french novelist Michel Butor in a symposium at St. Mary's entitled, "Language, Symbol and Reality," set for the first week of November. 
Although his lecture topic is 
still unknown, Racouer, most 
recently on the faculty of the 
University of Chicago, has been 
concerned with the reach of 
symbol and myth into human 
lives and human dis course. 
Other members of the St. 
Mary's symposium will be Karl 
Pat Dowdall Menninger of the Menninger Clinic, Roman Jacobsen, a famed linguist from M.I.T., Meyer Scapiro of Columbia, and Rulon Wells from Yale Univer­sity. According to SMC coordi­nator Mrs. Carl Grasser, the sympQsium will be open to only approximately 250 obscrvors due to limited space. However, the entire program will be video-taped and possibly recorded by closed circuit TV for usc by interested classes. Henritt Ott, a guest of the Notre Dame theology department, will visit the cam pus during the week preceding the St. Mary's symposium. Ott, now holding a chair at the University of Basil long held by theologian Karl Barth, works primarily in the 

area of systematic theology. tic will speak to a ND-SMC audience Monday evening, September 29. 
Specifics have not yet been worked out in a program involving former vice-president Hubert Humphrey and Senator George McGovern. However, both Humphrey and McGovern will participate in a conference sponsored by the N D student government concerning the American Indian scheduled for the week of January 6-10. 
Philosopher Thomas Langan returns to campus October 3, for a series of lectures on the Philosophy of History. 
The popular lecturer returns, says St. Mary's philosophy department head Richard Hutchinson, Jo conduct a seminar for SMC and Notre Dame students as well as to present the four lecture series. 
Langan has expressed a desire to meet and discuss philosophy with any students on either campus that are interested, said Hutchinson. Although still with the University of Toronto, Langan will commute for the seminar and ·lecture series and will have a regular office at St. Mary's to facilitate meeting with students. 
Paul Goodman, an outspoken critic of the American educational system and author of a battery of books on the subject, notably Growing Up Absurd and Compulsory Mis-/:"ducation, will highlight a conference on academic reform scheduled for early November. Good man will be one of a series of experts who will address themselves to the issue of education in America. 
The 4th annual "Challenges in Science" lecture series sponsored by the Arthur J. Schmidt foundation will be on a par with Challenges I, 2, and 3, and will be available to all in!crested Notre Dame and St. Mary's stud c nts regardless of their major, said Professor Emil Hoffman of the chemistry department. 
There had been some uncertaintly about funding for this year's series until very recently, making advance arrangement with possible lecturers impossible, said Hoffman. However, funding has been renewed, and the program which has brought scientists such as Nobel Prize winning chemist Linus Paulmg and bchavioralist James Watson to NotreDame will soon be extending mvitations to men of similar calibre this year. 
A "comprehensive study of black history" is the focus of the greater part of lectures to be sponsored by the history 

department this year. Twenty-seven lectures on various aspects of the development of the black man will be offered by members of the Notre Dame and SMC history faculties and experts from the South Bend area. 
According to Professor Samuel Shapiro, anyone who is determined enough to attend all twenty-seven lertures will have a good overview of the development of the black man. The program, says Shapiro, is designed with a broad base, covering areas in art and biology as well as history proper. 
In late October Senator Franch Church will team up with author Roger Hilsman and southeast Asian expert Mary Wright in a series called "Asian Perspective." 
0 t her not abIes planning lectures for the Notre Dame-SMC community are Indiana Senator Vance Hartke, physicist Henry Margenau, church historian Joseph Altholz, economist Milton Friedman from the University of Chicago, ''business conglomerate" experimentalist Rol-,ert Ling and Northwestern poetry critic Erich Heller. 
Connell resigns 
(continued from page 1) 
Student Body President Phil McKenna and Vice-President Fred Dedrick about this year's sophomore class government, and how it will be affected by Connell's resignation. The possibility of a triumvirate leading the class has been discussed, but is not likely. 
Soph VP Joe Stankus said that the same power which the officers had last year will be returned to the current officers. 
As for the future of Ray Connell, he intends to help tht government as much as possible this year, but he will not consider an officiaJ return to campus government until his grades are in. He also stressed his desire for "more participation on the part of the students in the future."

Teacher Preparation Office to aid Education students 
by Jim Holsinger 
1\ new department was added to the university this year as a result of the im:rcasc in co-exchange classes with St. Mary's College. 
The Institute for Studies in Education was ,officially established on Scp~emhcr I, and Rev. Neil G. McClusky, S.J ., was named as dcan-dirc.:to; of the program. 
The Institute will contain the Graduate Department of Education, St. Mary's Education Department, and the Office of Educational Research, as well as a counseling center and programs to aid students in obtaining teaching certification. 
Previously, Notre Dame students had to rely solely on the facilities of St. Mary's College for any education courses or counscUing. 
Now, through the Office of Teacher Preparation, a division 
o f t he n c w I y formed dcpardnent, undergraduate students can obtain teaching licenses in almost ar.y state upon graduation. 
Dr. Eugene V. Campanale is the Associate Director of OTP. 
His office works in close co-operation with other departments of the university to insure that a student need !10t major in education to obtain a license upon graduation. 
"We hope tt>at a No~re Dame student who graduates in any particular area will not only hr able to get a degree in that area, but will also be able to teach in any state," Campanale said. 
The OTP has two types of programs. One allows any undergraduate student to lake up to 6 credit hours in 
education. The other is designed for students who plan to teach upon graduation. 
All the classes arc taken from

Two hundred Notre Dame u ndcrgrads arc currently involved in some aspect of teacher preparation, and ten arc doing practice teaching in the South Bend area this semester. 
Dr. Campanale is hopeful that this number will increase to thirty or more by next semester.

The National Council for Accreditation for Teacher Education (NCATE) has given an initial approval to the 
program, but a hoard of examiners must still inspect the courses and facilities. 
Dr. Campanale, who is also the certifying officer for Notre Dame, indicated that if Notre Dame receives approval from NC/\TE, students who graduate from the program could be given a license almost anywhere in the United States through reciprocity. 

He has submitted a copy of the program to the State of Indiana, and he is presently preparing a brochure on the courses.

Academic Council decides to retain ROTC 
by Clifr Wintrode 
At its last meeting of the 6 H-69 academh.: year, Notre Dame's Academic Council voted overwhelmingly to retain the University's affiliation with the three ROTC' programs now on 
campus. 
Jlowcvcr the council, which is 
Notre Dame's major academic 
policy-making body, passed six 
resolutions regulating ROTC's 
role in the academic struct urc of 
the university. 
The first resolution passed by 
the Council left the 
determination of academic 
credit for ROTC offerings in the 
hands of the deans of the 
individual Colleges, as is 
presently the case for other 
courses. 
The decisions of the deans arc 
tempered by the decisions of 
that dean's College Council. 
Although the deans are not 
bound to follow the wishes of 
their College Council, it is a very 
rare circumstance when they do 
not. 
The three departments of 
military science arc part of thl' 
College of Arts and Letters. The 
College of Arts and Letters will 
give credit for the "upper 
division" phase of ROTC' classes. 
The College of Business 
Administration's policy is to 
grant credit in the third and 
fourth years up to a maximum 
of twelve hours. 
A maximum of nine credits is 
a II owed by the College of 
Science, but each department is 
free to set its own requirements. 
For instance, the Biology 
department accepts no credit for 
ROTC. 
The College of 1-:ngineering is 
wherever feasible, ot other 
University courses." 
Dean Waddick, Assistant Dean of the College of Arts and Letters, said that the courses switched would be "the more academic courses rather than the professional courses." The academic courses arc generally in the history and government areas. 
Waddick offered three reasons 
for this change. 
"The course would fit better 
in the academic structure of the 
university," he said. "It would 
be highly objective, and there is 
a duplication of the military 
department's offerings and 
university offerings," he added. 
Dean Plunkett, Director of 
Military Affairs, cited another 
reason. 
"The technical, instead of the 
professional courses, should 
more properly he taught by 
professional personnel trained in 
that area." Plunkett commented, 
"They might better he taught by 
men in our department who 
have such cxpcrtisl'." 
No changes will take place 
this semester because the 
Academic Council's ruling came 
after course selections for this 
semester had already been 
determined. 
Dean Plunkett thought some changes would be possible in the second semester hut he added that "academic units of the university will start to move this year" and some course substitutions will be accepted for the following year. 
The Academic Council's third 
resolution stressed the necessity 
of prior approval by appropriate 
university academic authorities 
of appointments of military 
teaching personnel. 
The process by which a military officer is accepted to be an instructor has been amended this year. Plunkett stated that the reason this was done was to "keep it more in line with the practice in other departments." 
Presently, a service nominates an offico.:r to be an instructor. 
rhe faculty committee of that service screens the candidate's record and passes along its approval or disapproval to the dean of the College of Arts and Ll't tcrs. 
The dean, after studying the man's LJUalifications, passes along the nomination with his approval or disapproval to Father John Walsh, Vice-President for Academic Affairs, who makes the final decision on the nominee's acceptance. 
T h c fourth · resolution interpreted the University's faculty manual to mean that military teaching personnel have "Non-tenurahle" status on the teaching and research faculty. which means that time spent in this status cannot be applied toward tenure. 
This resolution is a reaffirmation of past policy. The question has not been raised in the past because the military has avoided assigning an officer to be an instructor on his last assignment before retirement. Also, a military instructor is at the University too short a time to actruire any tenure even if he could be granted it. 
The fifth resolution asked responsible military and gov­ern mental officials to develop 

procedures for separation from 
ROTC units, without military or 
academic penalty, for students 
"who demonstrate a serious 
personal reason for separation." 
In the academic regulations of the university, a student who withdraws from a ROTC scholarship agreement in his junior or senior year would be subject to immediate callup in the reserves as an enlisted man. Dean Plunkett said it had never been imposed until last year. 
The student who was called up at the end of the year was in Navy ROTC' and had failed to give ''any satisfactory reason" for wanting out. Plunkett said the services will release a student if he provides a "very good reason." 
Plunkett described a "very good reason" as "a complete change in a boy's attituue toward war, a conscientious objector." 
The sixth resolution recommended that the University re-examine its contractual obligations with the Depart m cnt of Defense. It suggested that aspects of military training more appropriate to military installations be transferred to summer l'amps. 
Dean Plunkett said the 
university's contract with the 
armed service can he 
terminated by l'ithcr party with 
a years notice but that the 
contracts are continuous unless 
either party demands that the 
contract be broken or requests 
changes in the contract." 
"Every kind of military act of physical training type should be done at summer camps or cruises whc~e these arc appropriate," he contmued. "Most of the drilling might be done best at summer 
camp."

EVANSTON, ILL., September -That rarity on a Northwestern football squad ­depth -exists in at least one area for the 1969 Wildcats, and its presence will dictate the type of offense Northwestern will unveil in the opening game at Notre Dame, September 20. 
The depth is available in quality at the primary receiving positions, flankerback and split end, and, fortunately, is complemented by the passing skills needed to deliver the ball. 
"You've got to utilize what you do best-and passing and catching are the things we do best," said Coach Alex Agase. 
Agase's confidence in his receivers is based partly on p~ov­en performance and partly on exciting potential. The proven performers arc senior standouts, split end 13ruce Hubbard and flankcrback Ken Luxton. The potential is supplied by a pair of sophomores who arc challenging the veterans for the starting jobs,

Ice hockey comes early to the 
Notre Dame campus this year as 
the Chicago Black Hawks take 
on their Dallas farm club Sunday 
night in the Convo Center. 
Dallas won the Central Hockey 
League championship last year. 
The exhibition will be the 
third of the season for the Black

Ice meeting 
Varsity hockey coach Lefty Smith has announced that registration meeting will be held this Thursday night at 9:00 for all those interested in trying out for varsity hockey this year. The meeting will be held inside Gate 3 of the Convo Center. Off-icc conditioning and some skating will be in on Monday, Sept. 22. 
split end Jerry Brown and flankerback Barry Pearson. 
Hubbard, tallest man on the squad at 6-6, led the team in receiving lasy year with 33 receptions for 551 yards. His two-year total (49 catches for 782 yards) puts him within range of school career records for total receptions, (88, Cas Banaszck) and total yards (I ,239, Joe Collier). 
Luxton lasy year caught 13 passes for 202 yards as a running back, despite missing almost half the season with a kidney injury. Throughout early drills he matched spectacular receptions with Hubbard, who has built a reputation for the diving circus catch. 
Responsible for the solid improvement of the veterans has been the steady pressure exerted by the newcomers. Brown, who is seven inches shorter than Hubbard, compensates with fluid moves and the best speed of a Wildcat receiver in recent years. In a freshman game 
-

Controversial Chicago Black Hawk center Pit Martin is scheduled to play Sunday night in the Convo. 
against Purdue, he caught bombs 
of 65 and 60 yards. 
Pearson resembles Luxton in 
size and style. Agase has 
compared his moves and hands 
fav6rably with those of 1962 
Wildcat star, Paul Flatley, who 
went on to become the 
professional "rookie of the 
year" in 1963. Pearson caught 
l 9 passes for 327 yards in two 
freshman games. 
A fifth first-rate receiver is 
co-captain Pat Harrington, tight 
end, who last year had I 7 
receptions for 163 yards. 
Agase calls this quintet the finest group of receivers he has seen at Northwestern in 14 seasons. 
Regardless of who starts at split end and flankerback, the backup man figures to see an equal amount of action. As a result, the Wildcats can expect to have their top receivers comparatively fresh late in the game--a factor bound to put added pressure upon opposing secondaries. 

Pit Martin has publically blasted coach Billy Reay, general manager Tommy Ivan, team president Bill Wirtz, and all but four teammates for mismanagement and lack of hustle. Competition is expected to be fierce during the game since several Dallas players are currently fighting for places on the parent club's roster and are thus pitted against their former teammates. 
All reserved seats for the game have been sold out, but general admission tickets are on sale for $3.00 at the ACC ticket office.
