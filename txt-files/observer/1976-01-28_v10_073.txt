'Many dead' inN. African battles 
ALGIERS -Fierce fighting erupted yesterday between Algerian ar.d Moroccan troops along the border of the Spanish Sahara. Morocan officials said ''apparently there are many dead'' in this first reported clash between the armies of the two North African states in their Sahara dispute. 
Last November Morocco's King Hassan II sent tens of thousands of unarmed Moroccan volunteers on a "March of Conquest" into the phosphate-rich desert territory and won from Spain an agreement to divide it between Morocco and Mauritania. 

King plays darts 
MADRID -Spanish King Juan Carolos has taken up darts, standby of British pubs, a spokesman for the royal household said Tuesday. 
Juan Carolos, second cousin to Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, played his first game five years ago while visiting England. He beat Iavid Lawrence Edgar Balls, a London businessman who recently sent a darts set to the king to remind him of the game.

US must act now 

WASHINGTON-Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld warned Congress on Tuesday that the United States must act now to reverse a military power shift toward the Soviet Union. 
The secretary said U.S. forces currently are strong enough to balance Soviet strength, but he warned that the Russians have been making substantial gains in nuclear and conventional forces. He urged approval of the Pentagon's record $101.1 billion porposed budget.

"Unless increased public funding enables us in the near term to slacken the pace of rate increases, we may be caught in a vicious cycle of rate increases to compensate for volume decreases brought on by rate increases,'' Bailar said.

Giancana investigators are 

close to solution of murder 
CHICAGO (AP) -The state's attorney's office said today it has a prime suspect under investigation and may be "very close" to solving the June 19 slaying of reputed mob boss Sam Giancana. 
Giancana was found shot to death in the basement kitchen of his Oak Park clwelling. 
"Things point to one guy who we think did it,'' said investigator. "We are very close to a solution. We have to find one missing link.'' 
He said the missing link was the time factor. The suspect was described as a crime syndicate member who attended a small gathering for Giancana at his suburban home earlier in the evening, authorities said. They said they hope to be able to show

Two days before the slaying, the 67-year-old Giancana had returned from a H puston hospital after having gall bladder surgery. The gathering at his home was a welcome back party.

Games relaxed in lnnsbruck 
INNSBRUCK,.Austria-The Olympic 
Village opened its doors to athletes and Games' officials yesterday, and word spread quickly that visiting rules for men and women competitors aren't nearly so prud­ish as the Austrian hosts initially claimed. 
With the Winter Games' opening ceremony eight days away, Japan­host of the 1972 Sapporo Games raised its flag just ahead of Sweden to become the first nation officially in residence here. 
"Men can't come to our part of the village, but we can go to their quarters. Not bad, huh?" said a pretty Austrian luge racer after a midday visit, with two girlfriends, to the Austrian men's residence. 
Heavily armed Austrian police and soliders guarding the fenced complex only smiled when an attractive blonde walked into the 11-story building where the first 16 British male athletes and 10 team officials had just arrived. 
"There's a recreation center, dan­ce floor, film theater and shops where men and women athletes can visit one another. They shouldn't have to go to men's quarters," village press spokesman Ludwig Stecewicz said. 
But an Austrian woman at the athletes reception desk confirmed that there are no rules against women visiting in the men's dorm­itories. 
"The girls are free to go in as long as the soldier at the door lets them pass," the receptionist said. 
The security-conscious Austrians earlier had reported that athletes from various nations would be forbidden from entering each­other's qurters, and that men and women would be strictly segre­
gated. 
Dressed in navy blue great coats, with matching berets and red, white and blue scarves hanging to their knees, 30 Japanese bobsled­ders and ice hockey players stood to attention as their national hymn was played at the brief ceremony in the mid-village square reserved for flags of the 38 competing nations. 
"We will do all we can to make 
your stay here pleasant and we 
hope you will leave here satisfied.'' 
Olympic Village mayor Hans Jilg 
said in welcome in bright sunlight 
and sub freezing temperatures, 
with the snow-capped Tyrolian 
Alps towering in the background. 
Sweden also raised its flag of sky blue with a yellow cross for its early-arriving 25 luge and bobsled racers.

Mock stock market opens dealing 
by Jim Hershey Staff Reporter 

The Notre Dame Finance Club's Mock Stock Market will open at 10

The prizes are being donated by fhomson, McKinnon, Auchincloss and Kohlmeyer, Inc., a South Bend brokerage firm. The firm's dona­tion has allowed an increase in total 'rize money this yer from $85 to

Dr. Harvey Bender 

(Photos by Paul Cleve.1ger) Gary Burleson and Chienkuo Chang have used drugs to control tumor spread. 
"We do have evidence now that we can interfere with this metasta­tic spread if immunostimulants-­drugs' which stimulate the body's immune system--are applied early enough," PoHard said. "We also have found drugs which, if given in large enough dosages to germfre(· animals, will so shrink metastatic lung lesions that they are difficult to find.'' 
By controlling tumor spread with drugs, they have been able to extend survival of sick animals at least three times the usual 40 days to 150 days and longer. But, Pollard emphasized, the animals survive the drastic drug treatment without evident discomfort because they live in a sterile environment. The problem in applying the ther­apy to human patients is that the large drug dosage would destroy the body's immune mechanism as well as the cancer. A patient might survice cancer only to die of infection. 
Pollard, who has directed Notre Dame's germfree research labora­tory for 15 years, noted that germfree facilities are being devel­oped in many of the world's large medical centers where infection is recognized as one of the great complications of cancer therapy. A sterile environment also is vital to protect individuals born without an immune system until it can be restored, as well as to protect burn patients, who have lost their natur­
al barrier of skin, from antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

Arbitrary Party Rules 

Dear Editor: 
Every year various Administra­tion policies are invariably discus­ed and re-examined. This past

after th~ UCLA game, punative measures were imposed on several students for violating University policies on drinking and parti~s. This seems to be an appropnate time to reanalyze the school's stand on these issues. 
It is evident that the University's regulations are wholly . ar~i!rary and reinforced by techmcahtles. For example, the legality of alco­holic consumption in the privacy of a student's room is determined by the size and shape of the container 
from which the beverage is poured. To be more precise, beer in bottles is permissable, while beer in a keg

however, leaves one question un­answered. "What is the difference between beer in a keg and an equivalent amount in bottles?"

Bearing this in mind, punative 
measures should only be taken when a party is clearly out of control. That is, if many people are loitering in the corridors and obviously disturbing the privacy of other students on the floor. 
The time has come to put an end to the friction that exists between students, rectors, and rector's assi­stants. The issue here should not be kegs, nor should it be parties. The important question is whether we will be reasonable with each other. It seems the only hope for a solution is if we work together and formulate good rules. As unthink­able as it sounds, perhaps students and R.A.'s could even collaborate in organizing parties. Let's face it,

,:. ~ A Christian in ROTC? 
( ( 
} 
I was enraged upon reading "A 

I ( Christian in ROTC'', by Stephen K. Judge in the January 21 Observer. Although Mr. Judge clarifies the basic purpose of the program, his further attempts to justify his participation in the light of Christi­
i an morality distort fact and defy 
I ( logic. While presenting the well­known political rationale for maint­enance of the Armed Forces, he dodges the moral issues involved. 
The author's initial point is well taken: that Notre Dame students in ROTC are not war mongers, and that the aim of ROTC is to
j 
''familiarize the officer candidate with the principles of leadership,
{ 
personnel management and the nation's defense policy". Such an education of future officers is, in Mr. Judge's estimation, essential to the preservation of a dem~ratic society as well as to the proper functioning of its military. 
It is important to bear in mind, however, that even if our military leadership is "drawn from a pool of intelligent, sensitive and educated young men and women" , one cannot simply conclude that such status implies an allegiance to Christian ethics. But this discrep­ancy is minor compared to the 
barrage of twisted logic which 
follows to defend an already weak 
argument. 
The author insists that ''very few Christian churches have a consist­ent doctrine on the morality of war". I quite agree: in the past, faith in Christ's love has not been strong enough to include the immediate enemy, considered unr­edeemable by love and thus subject to violence. But does this ambival­ence permit us to endorse war? Emphatically not! The author proc­laims, "Each war has different moral problems attending to it". While this may be true to a certain extent, it is essential to remember that all wars do share one indisput­able moral problem -killing. And to rationalize killing is a serious per version of the life and teaching of Christ. 
To retreat, as Mr. Judge does,. behind the largely misunderstood "just-war theory" has no place in modern society. James Douglass, founder of the Program in Non-vio­lence at Notre Dame, remarked that the just-war theory is "a doctrine whose theoretical purpose has never been to justify war as such but rather to provide those norms by which particular wars could be judged justifiable or not....the just-war doctrine today serves the primary function of condemning as unjust all warfare in the Nuclear Age." 
Next, Mr. Judge infers that because Christ did not stage a verbal assault on the Roman legio­ns, He therefore condoned the existence of a military establishm­ent. The logic behind this mislead­ing insinuation is idiotic. I could think of many things which Christ did NOT say, but such idle specula­tion proves nothing. Besides, in searching for justification of the military, I'm afraid the choice of the Prince of Peace as a proponent leaves much to be desired. 
Furthermore, St. Francis Xavier 

was  neither  a  soldier  nor  the  
founder  of  the  Jesuits,  as  the  
author  erroneously  indicates.  St.  

Ignatius Loyola, after renouncing his years as a soldier in the Spanish Army, founded the order. "Ignati­us' emphasis upon obedience has often givena misguided impression of inflexibility and militaristic reg­ime,'' cites the Catholic Encyclop­edia.

On Fasting 
Barb Robinson 
Today the Notre Dame World Hunger Coalition will again be soliciting support for the Campus Pledge Drive begun last year. 
. Students who wish to fast on Wednesday evenings will be asked to complete a Pledge Drive form and return it at the dining halls or to their dorm representatives. As in the past, the money saved from these meals will be distributed to the poor within our own community and overseas, by voluntary agencies. 
This drive is a concrete means for students to spark and show their concern for millions who lack the basic requirements for a humane and dignified existence. Money is essential to help these millions. 
But for many who participate in this drive, it is not an end in itself. It is only a first step. Our temporary hunger can direct our attention to the permanent hunger of millions of other people. It can prod us to stand against the global injustice that is the root of mass starvation. 
The figures on maldistribution ar jolting at best. As individuals we often find ourselves so overwhelmed by famine, drought, massive starvation, that we despair or allow ourselves to become ~ paralysed and unable to work for change. Undoubtedly, our easiest choice is to give up, to claim that this is a hopeless struggle and that no individual can affect the institutions and patterns that need to be changed. 
Perhaps at this point we are the ones who stand in greatest need. The questions and complexities of global development can all too readily be dismissed, forgotten, exchanged for the more "pressing" problems of ur everyday lives. We have choices before us, however. We have an opportunity to fast for a short time each week within a community of other caring persons. If we so choose, that time can give us a commitment to live out our concern for those 
·,
lacking the freedom to make such decisions. 
It can become a means of sensitizing ourselves to poverty we have I never experienced. For those who have worked in underdeveloped areas images of children lethargic from malnutrition remain vivid. The ;tark reality of insufficient food (!nd medicine are not easily forgotten. Still, one seeks to forget such disturbing memories. But starvation wi II not go away if we turn away. We need to be reminded and to participate in some act of fidelity to those experiences. 
In starting this Pledge Drive, the Coalition is not contending that fasting, by itself, will cure global inequality. But it helps us realize the suffering of a distant world. Hopefully, we will understand that our own patterns of consumption do in fact bear some relationship to the resources others have to live free from want. 
The present world food situation and maldistribution are not crises. They are more alarming than that. They are permanent conditions--unless we as individuals make certain choices in our own lives and find ways to act on those decisions.

ies...prove such a view unjustifi­ed.'' To declare, as Mr. Judge does, that the Society of Jesus was "founded on military principles" is inept and crude. 
Not content to let his alleged case rest, after a brutal torture of reason that would make a logician cringe, the author proceeds to take potshots at those who ''pass them­selves off as firm believers in non-violence". In exposing the ''shallow dishonesty'' of these hypocrites, whose ''reasoning is more political than moral'', Mr. Judge conveniently skirts the very real problem of confronting a truly non-violent stance. · 
Mr. Judge's apparent distaste for war (which he finds "about as appealing as a case of tuberculos­is") might seem commendable, except for the fact that he implicitly endorses it. For in perceiving war as "the most desperate sort of diplomacy", he admits that it remains a viable, albeit desperate, course of action. This. is hardly a Christ-like attitude. If I may borrow one of Mr. Judge's more enlighte­ned comments, it is obvious that his ''reasoning is more political than moral." More precisely, he 
Edward Small 
parrots national defense policy rationale while his argument gasps hopelessly for air, lacking any moral validity. 
To "hope" for world peace, as the author does in his conclusion, a peace "which should be the life's work and prayer of every Notre Dame graduate", may appear well­intentioned. But to then assert that "Until that day comes, we must deal with the world on its own terms" is contradictory, hypocriti­cal and disgusting. By supporting an establishment which counters violence with violence, which main­tains and perpetuates the very problems he purportedly hopes will be solved, the author displays an acute lack of reflection, as well as a dearth of moral sensitivity. The lyrics of a Mose Allison song "Everybody's Cryin' Mercy" help to illustrate Mr. Judge's confusion: 
Well, you know, the people running round in circles 
don't know what they're headed 
for;  ·  
Everybody's cryin',  "Peace  on  
Earth!  

just as soon as we win this war.''

''An Almost Chosen People'' seems like a very cynical title for a bi-centennial art show. It is a deliberately ambigous choice (taken from a sppech by Abraham Lincoln) and reflects some of the unique aspects of America's growth. By thinking ourselves immune from the passage of time and history, we deny the inevitability of a fall. Because we believe so strongly in our own immortality, we are almost chosen. Also implied in this quote is the misuse of potentials and resources. We had all the potential to be really great, but something still went wrong, and we missed the mark in the end. For a more positive view of this statement,. Profes$or Ronald Weber says, "Well, at least we were in the running." 
The current exhibit in the Notre Dame Gallery, running from now until March 21, does not force itself on the viewer because the objectives of the artists are extremely diverse. Since either a positive or negative atitude can be drawn from the show, Dean Porter, the Gallery Director, would like the viewer to decide for himself. When looking at America through the eyes of several of its artists, one will find striking contrasts Some American artists are grotesquely cynical, while others indulge in the practice of over-sentimentality. Certain patterns, however, do emerge. Five divisions in the current show can roughly be assigned to the pieces. Wars, the Frontier, rural and urban life and leisure or play. Even within these catagories, both positive and nega­tive statements of the respective artists reveal themselves. 
War is an aspect of history which is treated by artists of all countries. As many different opinions on the war arise in the nation, so too, the art concerning it will express radically different standpoints. Monuments and commemorative paintings will be done to praise the leaders and glorify the great battles. The portrait of General Sherman exemplifies his great capacity for leadership, but then not all American artists take such pride in the wars of their countries. In a subdu~d opposition to violence, an oil by Scott portrays peace and beauty in the raising of the flag of truce. Oddly enough, the only expression of the real brutality of war is an Indian wall hanging done in 1840. The Indian artists portrayed themselves as 

most......... . 
methodically destroying each other with guns and horses, both gifts of the original white settlers in North America. 
One of the most powerful pieces in the show, this Indian Wall hanging provides an ironic contrast with "The World was All Before Them'' by Russell. Done around 1900, this work depicts the frontiersmen of about 80 years before. Purple sunrise glows mystically in the background as the men gaze piercingly Westward. This historical event took place before the wall-hanging was done. What practically became a great empire in North America, was brutally wrenched from the Indians so the prophecy of Manifest Destiny could be fulfilled.. Also hanging in this section, are two photographs of Ansel Adams. These photos of untouched land in America lament its loss and destruction, yet point out its beauty and grandeur. 
Moving from the frontier to the rural areas, we can still see a great division of the treatment of the various subjects. Rothstein's "Dust Bowl" shows the plight of the Oklahoma sharecroppers during the dust storms of the 1930's. It is a bleak photograph of the Depression and the natural disaster which caused destruction to many Americans. Hanging nearby is another portrayal of American rural life. Farm boys plough the fields in an atmosphere of peace and abundance. 
As the move from the rural areas to the cities took place, life became much more complex and fast moving. Cynical views of the entr~pment of urban life are obvious in many of the works dealing with existence in the city. A photograph of a polluted factory at sunrise shows the oppressive implications of mechanization, a garish lithograph of a prospective pick-up,"One and.One" by Lindner, reflects the isolation and cynicism which breeds in the city. Lonelinessand isolation in the city are also treated by Edward Hopper in his etching, "Night Shadows." Other urban artists, however, show a positive side to this theme by finding and pointing out aesthetic beauty in the technological aspects of the city. A Standard station (with olive) and a neon sign, "HOT" become objects for artistic appreciation. Even the human form can become an object purely for its aesthetic qualities. This is shown in "Falling Man Variant", a serigraph by Trova, which depicts a cyclic progression of figures. 
The final section of leisure and play expresses a concern for the personal lives of the subjects. Children swirl around in a blur of color in an oil by Potthast, and play crack the whip in one of Winslow Homer's etchings. "Newport Beach" captures a moment of peace by the ocean; a lone figure fishes on the shore. These glimpses into the private lives of the subjects demonstrate their ability to find pleasure and relaxation in any environment. It is not a function of rural or urban, or of wartime or peacetime. The search for pleasure and solitude is an essential part of existance, and the concentration on child­ren as subjects of these works implies a direct hope for the future. As the phrase, "An Almost Chosen People" can refer to a process of time, it can also imply that, although we are not the chosen ones, our children will be.

EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the first part of a tri-partite article by Kathy Mills, Observer Staff Reporter. In this series, we shall examine the situation and phllosopby of drinking at Notre Dame. . 
Let's go out drinking tonight." 
How often does this suggestion come up 
when students are looking for something to 
do on a Friday or a Saturday or even a 
weekday night? How often do students go 
to beer parties and drink for the entire 
evening? Surveys on U.S. college campus­
es report that between 71 and 96 percent of 
college students drink. 
"The amount of drinking at Notre Dame 
is getting higher and higher,'' stated 
Margaret Barnum. Barnum was recently 
hired to work in the Psychological Services 
Center with alcohol and drug problems on 
campus. 

"The whole setting is ideal for heavy 
drinking," she pointed out. "The amount 
of other things to do isn't all that great." 
"I've noticed an increase in drinking 
problems lately," said Father Terrence 
Lally, assistant vice-president for student 
affairs. "More people are drinking now; 
our revenue at Senior Bar tells us that," he 
added. 

Lally attributed the increase in student 
drinking to greater academic_ pressures. 
"Students don't know how to relax," he 
explained, ''and drinking is a way to wipe 
away the strain." Barnum also said 
drinking is involved with academic .pre~: 
sureas well as the lack of "other things to 
do." 

"I have a feeling that there is much more 
heavy drinking that is quietly tolerated 
here," Barnum stated. "I would guess it 
would be more than one out of ten at Notre 
Dame who will have a drinking problem; 
over ten to 15 percent are heavy drinkers." 
Maggie Waltman, cocktail waitress at the local bar Fat Wally's, said the bar is crowded when she works on Monday nights. The crowd comes because F~t Wally's has a giant television screen for Monday Night Football she explained. Waltman also works on ithursday nights. "Fat Wally's is "slow" then, she said. 
Senior Bar, the on-campus bar which is open Wednesday through Saturday nights, has its largest crowd on Wednesday nights, according to Betsy Kall, who tends bar there. Kall added the bar "tends to get crowded later at night" on the weekends. The Thursday night crowd is "better than the weekends," she said. 
...drinking 
Tom Conaty, one ofthe bartenders at the "student bar" Nickie's, said the bar gets "really crowded" on Thursday nights. He noted Nickie's also has a crowd on Monday nights for Monday Night Football and on Friday and Saturday nights after 11 p.m. Many students also go to Nickie's on Wednesday nights after Senior Bar closes, Conaty added. Senior Bar closes at 2 a.m. while Nickie's is open until 3 a.m. 

The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) defines a prob­lem drinker as "one who drinks enough to cause trouble for himself and society." 
According to the NIAAA, about ten percent of the 95 million Americans who drink are problem drinkers or full-fledged alcoholics. The-Rutgers University Center of Alcohol Studies defines an alcoholic as "one who is unable consistently to choose whether he shall drink or not, and who, if he drinks, is unable consistently to choose 
whether he shall stop or not." 
Delegates to the alcohol conference held in November at Notre Dame which involved 62 colleges recognized that in­creased use of alcohol among students is a problem. 
As the April 22, 1974 issue of Time magazine noted, alcoholism is the coun­trty's biggest health problem after heart disease and cancer. An alcoholic's life span is shortened by 10 to 12 years. Ac­cording to the August, 1974, Reader's Digest, alcoholic liver disease, especially cirrhosis, is one of the world's chief public health problems. In large U.S. cities, cirrhosis is the fourth-leading cause of death for people between the ages of 24 and 45. 
Reader's Digest also noted recent animal 
research has shown alcohol can do profound, long-term harm to mental pro­cesses. The mental troubles of alcoholics had long been attributed wholly or partly to malnutrition, but the experiment's results were achieved with excellent diet for the animals. 
Also, Time said at least one-half of 55,000 auto deaths that occur in the U.S. each year and one-half of the one million major injuries resulting from auto acci­dents can be linked directly to a driver or a pedestrian who was "under the influence" of alcohol. Many of the deaths and injuries are caused by those in the under-21 age group, Time pointed out, and arrests of young people for drunken driving have soared since states began lowering the legal drinking age from 21. For example, in the year after Michigan lowered its legal drinking age, the state reported an increase of 141 percent in such arrests. 
Finally, alcohol misuse and alcoholism cost the American people approximately $25 billion each year in lost production, health and medical costs, property damage and welfare and criminal justice costs, according to Alcohol and Health; New Knowledge, published by the U.S. Depart­ment of Health, Education and Welfare.

Speaking to 60 graduate students last night in the Administration Building, Director of the Notre Dame Placement Bureau Richard Willemin discussed the declining academic market and the Bureau's services. Willemin stressed that despite the scarcity of academic careers ''there are always jobs out there." For students intent on teaching careers, the Center offers a dossier service. After the student has prepared his or her dossier (academic record and letters of recommendation), it is sent to any potential employer on 24 hours notice. 
For the student who pursues a non-academic career, the Place­ment Bureau issues weekly annou­ncements of job openings and interviews on campus.

He advised them to attend professional meetings in their fields. He cited booklets of resumes made up by the English and Government departments sent to colleges and universities as useful in stirring up interest. 
Though reevaluating career choices is a traumatic step, Wil­lemin encouraged students who decide on business careers instead of academic to "go 100 percent in that direction.'' If the potential employer senses hesitation, "you won't get a nibble," Willemin said. 
Training a new employee is too costly to risk on a person who will return to teaching at the first chance. 
The Director advised: avoid dis­couragement, take stock of your skills, intelligence, problem solving and communication abilities. Sign up for interview spots that are not filled, even though your degree is not specifically called for by that

Willemin's presentation was fol­lowed by brief talks by Larry Carlson of Northwestern Mutual Insurance and Jim O'Donnell of Northern Trust of Chicago. Both recruiters urged liberal arts gradu­ates to consider financial fields such as insurance and banking. 
O'Donnell pointed out that 40 to SO percent of his bank's new employ­ees are liberal arts graduates, many of whom have advanced degrees. O'Donnell echoed Wille­min, "There are jobs out there. You have to be aggressive."

Student Managers

Freshmen entering Notre Dame are special people. One look at their
' { 
high school records show that some were valedictorians, some class
' 
officers, others the editors of school newspapers and yearbooks, or the 
captain of a varsity sport. When they come to Notre Dame, they want to build on their talents. While only a small part of their education takes place in the classroom, they want to explore the larger part of their education, the extracurricular activities at Notre Dame. They see four years spent' in the dorm as a waste of time and money. Notre Dame is blessed with a wide range of activities for all different interests. Student n~anaging is one of these activities. 
Many people have preconceived notions about managers--those short, weak waterboys who carry dummies during practice and always have a football on them. Well, that's part of the manager's job, but not nearly all of it. Next to the basketball office in the ACC is the student managers' office. In that office managers keep records and files about all the athletes, in case they're needed by a coach or sports information. The managers prepare all the paperwork and accounting for every game. 
Managers. work not only with coaches but also with the athletic business directors. College sports today is big business and student managing has had to adjust to meet the increasing demands. It is an education in itself to see the efficiency of a modern athletic 
r 

r, department. dI To most, the image of a manager is limited to football. The Notre ' \ Dame Student Manager's Organization works with all varsity sports, 
including basketball, hockey, wrestling, fencing, tennis, swimming, track, cross-country, and baseball. A manager gets a well-rounded view of all these different teams. Working these different sports provides a change of pace for those managers who may prefer to work hockey or basketball. This too is part of a manager's education. 
Managing is hard work which many times seems to interfere with the ability to survive .in the classroom. The long hours are just another part of the manager's education, a lesson .. in self-discipline. Class, studying. and managing must be scheduled and arranged to fit into 
/ one day. Sophomore managers prepare equipment on Thursday nights 
I 
for away football games; they know well that studying for a quiz Friday 
must be done on Wednesday. \ The manager's creed is very simple: "We expect 100% from 100% ( of our managers 100% of the time". Hustle--that's what managing is ( all about. Managers have to be on their toes all the time to be on the 
lookout for anything, whether it be a missing uniform or a missing player. Some days it is tough to hustle, but those are the days hustle is / I ' needed the most. The coaches and players constantly depend on the managers at a moments notice. One slip could make matters difficult for everyone. The coaches and players respect the managers for their 
' 
hustle and the only way to maintain that respect is by more of that same hustle. 
Right now we are in the midst of a recruiting drive for freshmen managers. The work is there, but so are the rewards. If you're interested in becoming a student manager now is the time to get involved. There will be a meeting on Sunday, February 1 at 6:30pm in the auditorium of the ACC for all prospective freshmen managers. Please bring a pen or pencil and your class sche~ule

Chicagoland school since the days 
of World War II. His 520 victories 
in 35 years at DePaul makes him 
the winningest active basketball 
coach. 

The Irish and DePaul have met at 
least once a season since Meyer 
took over as the head man of the 
Blue Demons. Over the span the 
Irish have won 35 and lost 22. 
Notre Dame has won nine of the 
last ten meetings. 

Last year Phelps' and crew were 
stung by DePaul, 75-70, before an 
overflow crowd of almost 6,000 in 
the cozy confines of Alumni Hall. 
Adrian Dantley had 19 points and 
13 rebounds in a losing cause. 
The DePaul victory touched off a 
bit of furor and controversy when 
the NCAA Tournament Committee 
chose the 18-8 Irish for an at-large 
berth and left the 16-9 Blue 
Demons to contemplate about the 
future. 

The Blue Demons might catch 
the 11-3 Irish ripe for upset once 
more. For DePaul has found itself 
sandwiched in between the form~­
dible basketball powers of Mary­
land and UCLA in the Notre Dame 
schedule. It is conceivable DePaul 
might find the tenth ranked Irish 
either coming down off of the b1g 
UCLA win or keying up for the 
Maryland game. 

"We realize," Phelps concludes, ''that this is a big week for Notre Dame basketball. We played real well against UCLA, now we must keep up that sort of tempo versus DePaul. We must be very careful to take one game at a time.'' 
Due to conflict of interest, Chan­
nel 16 will not air tonight's game. 
Ski trip planned on February 6-8 
A ski trip to Crystal Mountain, Michigan, sponsored by Student Union, has been arranged for Feb. 6-8. 
The cost of the trip is $37. This includes lift tickets Friday night through Sunday, Saturday break­fast and dinner, live entertainment at night and two nights lodging. Weekend ski rentals cost $13-$14. 
Skiers will be accommodated at either Frankfort or Thompson con­dominiums, with four persons to a 
room 

Transportation must be arranged by the skiers. By car, it takes about six hours to reach Crystal Moun­tain. 
A $10 deposit must be paid by Friday, Jan. 30. Reservations and deposits will be taken until Friday, from 11-4 at the Student Union Ticket Office. 


Fencers score three wins; continue national assent 
Notre Dame's fencing team con­tinued its rise toward national prominence by scoring three victor­ies, including two major upsets, last night at the ACC. The 5-0 Irish downed heavyweights Wayne State 
 )19-8), N.Y.U. (15-12) and crushed 

Tri-State (24-3). 

Freshman Mike Sullivan was a 
standout for the Irish as he posted a 
perfect 6-0 record on the night. 
Sullivan defeated defending NCAA 
champion Yuri Rabinovich, 5-1, in · one of the key matches of the night. Olympic contender Tim Glass downed Swedish Olympic squad member Hans Weiselgren by a S-3 margin._ 
The women's fencing team also did well on the night. Notre Dame defeated Tri-State, 5-4 and Culver Military, 7-2 in women's action. 
In one other match, Wayne State edged N.Y.U., 14-13. 
The fencers swept their initial 
matches of the season last weekend 
by defeating Cleveland State 24-3, 
and Indiana, 19-8. Cleveland State 
overcame Indiana 14-13 to round : out the triangular meet. 
All Irish weapons showed good 
strength with the foil fencers 
highlighting the competition by 
sweeping all nine of their bouts 
against Cleveland State. The epee 
team was led by All-Americans, Ed 
Fellows and Tim Glass, as they 
defeated all opponents handily. 
The Irish fencing team travels west this weekend to take on three foes. ~riday ~ight they will compe­te agamst Milwaukee Area Techni­cal College while on Saturday they move to Minnesota to fe·r,ce both the University of Minnesota and Winnepeg College. All three schoo­ls are new on Notre Dame's schedule.
