ELECTION 2008 

Campus groups mobilize over 2008 election 
College Dem, GOP clubs support their candidates 
By KAITLYNN RIELY Associate News Editor 
No matter who wins the presidential election this fall, there's going to be a big celebration at Notre Dame. 
"We'll have the biggest party that Notre Dame's ever seen," Edward Yap, the president of the Notre Dame College Republicans, said. "Regardless of who­ever wins, we'll have tons of fun at it." 
But Yap is hoping for a victory by the Republican ticket of Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska. He said the club might look into booking an off-campus location to watch the election returns Nov. 4.

''I've experienced the highs of a BCS game and the lows of a loss to Navy," senior Dennis · Rankin said. "So I'm excited to experience the highs again." 
San Diego State is anticipated to be an easier opening game than Georgia Tech last season, and many students say they expect a win.

Band holds annual plaiding ceremony 
By LIZ HARTER Saint Mary's Editor 
Tailgating, watching the foot­ball players head to the stadi­um after the team Mass, buying steak sandwiches from the Knights of Columbus on South Quad. Students and fans in town for the Notre Dame home opener against San Diego State have a lot of entertainment opportunities vying for their attention before the 3:30 p.m. kick-ofT. 
If tradition is what catches their interest though, the Irish faithful can attend the Band of the Fighting Irish's plaiding ceremony, which will take place before the traditional concert on the steps in front of Bond Hall at 1:25 Saturday. 
At the ceremony the senior members will present plaids to the first year members of the band to complete their uniform. 
After the seniors present their plaids they receive a spe­cial senior plaid that is distin­guished by the gold cording along its edges from a family member or friend. 
"It's a way to honor the new band members for their first home game, and a way to rec­ognize the seniors at the begin-

Since the beginning of the fall semester, NDVotes '08 has regis­tered 91 new voters and added 410 people to its database, senior Mallory Laurel, a co-chair for the nonpartisan education campaign run by the Center for Social Concerns (CSC) said. 
At the CSC's opening picnic last week, the NDVotes '08 table was "just swarmed the entire time," Laurel said.

By MANDl STIRONE Assistant News Editor 
Saint Mary's underwent a massive renovation effort this summer with 11 of the College's buildings undergoing construction. According to an e-mail sent to the student body by Director of Facilities Bill Hambling. LeMans Hall, Havican Hall, Holy Cross Hall, Haggar College Center, Cushwa-Leighton Library, Angela Athletic Facility, Madaleva Hall, McCandless Hall, Moreau Hall, Regina Hall, Reidinger House and the Science Building have all been renovated. 
LeMans Hall was under con­struction as early ~s spring semester last year, Hambling said in an April 29 Observer article.

INSIDE COLUMN 


Pageantry Rankings 
Football weekend is here again! That, of course, means that campus will transform from a sleepy little place and turn into Disneyland for a eoupln days. 
To celebrate the occasion, John Tierney 
we dneided to 
rnlease the offi­cial Notre News Writer Dame Football Pageantry Power Hankings, 08. (Disclaimer: power rankings are not oftieial.) 
Our goal is to rank football pageantry items 1-10. We might not get that far, but we'II give it a college try. 
1. 
The game. This is too obvious. It shouldn't even really count. 

2. 
The Alma Mater at the end of the game. People complained last year that we shouldn't sing it after we lose, or at least the players shouldn't sing it with us, but we should sing it and the players should join us. The Alma Mater is more than a school tradition. It's a prayer. And it's really cool that Charlie Weis and the players are willing to join with nveryone else in the stadium for it. 


:~. Knights of Columbus Steak Sandwich sale. Best grub you can get before the game. Plus, the it raised over $60,000 for eharity last year. 
4. 
The jig. I think the jig is more fun than the touchdown pushups. It gets even better when the band speed up the tempo cause someone in the row winds up messing up and everyone falls over. 

5. 
Ollicer Tim McCarthy from the Indiana State Poliee. Bad puns are so much fun. 


I'm a fan. Only not really. Think about it. 
6. Candlelight Dinner. I like food. And the food at Candlelight Dinner is good. This would be higher, but the line is significantly longer than it is at 12:20 on Tuesdays.

~ 
7. 
Trumpets in the Dome. I didn't know about it until sophomore year, but it's worth fighting the crowds to see it. The Victory March is really powerful in the Dome. I like it more than Concert on the Steps because it doesn't spoil the half-time show. But a friend just disputed the spoil factor of Concert via text message. She likes the concert because "you can listen to the music, then you can focus on watching at halftime." 

8. 
Drummer's circle. Between the people climbing the trees on God Quad, the undergrads on the steps of the Dome, and the mosh pit that develops, there's plenty of fun to go around. 

9. 
Going to the Grotto before the game. This is a tip from the same column contributor who advocated for Concert on the Steps: "You almost catch fire because of all the can­dles." 


10. 
The players taking the walk from the Basilica to the Stadium. Since I live in Sorin, it's pretty easy for me to attend this one, but it's worth a trip. 


Moral of the story? Go Irish, beat Aztecs!

UPS driver surpasses 1 million miles In truck 
PALESTINE, Texas -A routine package delivery turned into a milestone for a UPS driver in East Texas. Brent Boyd, 51, on Thursday surpassed one million miles on his UPS delivery truck, the same vehicle he's driven for 22 years with the company. 
The odometer on Boyd's 1987 GMC truck rolled over to all zeros as he began his delivery route near Palestine. He said he's never had an acci­dent with his company vehicle.

Boyd told The Associated Press that his truck's gone through at least three engines and been repaint­ed several times. 
But he's resisted offers for a new van. Boyd says the truck is "like home" and feels like "sitting in the recliner in your house." 
House cats rescued after starting fire 
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. ­Chattanooga firefighters rescued several cats during a house ftre that investiga­tors say was probably caused by the cats them­selves. 


Fire department spokesman Bruce Garner said firefighters responded to an alarm Thursday morning and found a fire in the kitchen. While no one was home, they found about 10 cats inside. 
Some of the cats escaped the house on their own, but some showed signs of smoke inhalation. 
Capt. Lesley Morgan said the cause of the fire appears to be accidental and most likely was caused by a cat knocking over an unattend­ed candle in the kitchen.

"I think having it at the beginning of Saint Mary's freshman 
the year is an excel­lent way for our students to show school pride and get excited for the year ahead," student body vice president Sarah Falvey said. 
This year the Board of Governance hopes to get the stu­dent body more involved. Instead of just advertising through e-mail, they plan to go dorm to dorm to spread the word.

FEMA aids Gustav victims 
Associated Press 
NEW ORLEANS -The fed­eral government says it will pay the hotel expenses of some of the nearly 2 million people who fled their homes ahead of Hurricane Gustav, but exactly who will be eligi­ble for assistance and how much it will cost taxpayers was uncertain. 
Officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency planned a telephone news conference Thursday to answer questions. 
Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said Wednesday in Baton Rouge that FEMA would pay hotel costs "to make sure that people don't feel eco­nomic pressure to return home prematurely, before it's safe." 
He said FEMA would pay hotels directly, so it was unclear whether those who had already paid for rooms and checked out would be eligible for reimbursement. 
With two other hurricanes threatening the East Coast, the decision to pay for hotels could make it easier to evac­uate residents during the next disaster. But doing so would also burden the agency with huge expenses. 
The news that hotel costs might be reimbursed came too late for people who have been sleeping at public shel­ters, such as those in a con­vention center in Birmingham, Ala. Some of those evacuees said they But he was uncertain what would have preferred a the agency would offer such hotel if they had known a family, in part because FEMA money would be various other factors ­available. including the family's insur­

agency and to save receipts that document their spending during the evacuation. 
"We'd need receipts, and we'd need to know whether the area they were evacuat­ed from is one of the manda­tory evacuation areas," said Ed Conley, a FEMA spokesman. 
Conley was asked, as an example, whether a family could be reimbursed for hotel expenses after leaving New Orleans on Sunday, checking into a Tennessee hotel, then returning after two, three or four nights. 
"That's exactly the family we want to get in touch with us," Conley said.

Thursday that the agency had received a handful of calls in recent days from evacuees asking for gas money to return home. The state is referring those people to FEMA and the Red Cross. 
Some evacuees also won­dered whether FEMA would cover their lost wages and other expenses after they return to New Orleans. 
In the Birmingham shelter, Carlos Pavilus of New Orleans said he would give anything to be in a hotel. 
''I'm so tired of smelling tennis shoes and diapers. We have no laundry. We have nothing," Pavilus said.

With relations between the two nations in a nearly Cold Warlike freeze over Russia's actions against its neighbor last month. planning is under way at the White House for the largely sym­bolic move by Bush, accord­ing to senior administration ollicials, who spoke on con­dition of anonymity because the decision was not yet final. Action could come quickly, within days at the most, and officials see no need to wait until Vice President Dick Cheney returns next Wednesday from an overseas trip that includes stops in three for­mer Soviet republics. 
Withdrawing the agree­ment from CapitollliU would have little aetual impact, as the deal very likely would not gain approval during Bush's presidency.

IN BRIEF 
Consumer spending down, stocks fall 
NEW YORK -Dejected investors sent stocks plunging Thursday, hurtling the Dow Jones industrials down more than 340 points after retailers and the government added to a moun­tain of bad economic news and devastated hopes for a late-year recovery. 
The market was already nervous as it waited for the government to release its August employ­ment report on Friday. So news from the nation's major retailers that shoppers curtailed their spending last month due to higher gas and food prices came as a heavy blow.

The seats cost $869 for a pair and will have a place of honor in Buono's basement in New Hyde Park when they are shipped, sometime after the last game is played at Shea this fall and the Mets begin dismantling the stadium. 
"My wife kind of gave me a strange look when I told her I was doing it," Buono admit­ted. "But she was OK with it."

Corrupt lobbyist sent to prison 
Abramoffsentenced to four years for cutting deals between lobbyists and politicians 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -Jack Abramoff, the once powerful lobbyist at the heart of a far­reaching political corruption scandal, was sentenced to four years in prison Thursday by a judge who said the case had shattered the public's confidence in government. 
Abramoff, who fought back tears as he declared himself a broken man, appeared crestfallen as the judge handed down a sen­tence lengthier than prose­cutors had sought. 
Over the past three years, Abramoff has come to sym­bolize corruption and the secret deals cut between lobbyists and politicians in back rooms or on golf cours­es or private jets. The scan­dal shook Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House to Capitol Hill and contributed to the Republicans' loss of Congress in 2006.

Senator leads boycott in underfunding protest 
Associated l'ress 
CIIICA<;o -The statn snna­tor who led a school boycott to protest underfunded Chicago schools cut it short af'tor two days and said Thursday he will be talking to Gov. Bod Blagojnvieh soon to discuss solutions. 
Snn . .lamns Mlleks said the governor's office has suggest­ed Monday or Tuesday as pos­sible datns for a menting. 
Meeks had announced latH Wednesday that his boycott, which began Tuesday. was being ended bncause Blagojevich said hn wouldn't meet while it was still in n!Tnct. It was to have lasted through Friday. 

"The governor stated that he would not meet until the boycott was called ofT. so we are going to not only call his bluff' but trust that he keeps this word." Meeks said in cut­ting thn protest short. "We 
trust that the governor is a man of' good will and good sense." 
Meeks said he eould not yet estimate how many students participated in the boycott's sec.ond day, but he said the number was in the hundreds. While the number was only a fraction of the district's 400,000 students, Meeks said it was successful in publiciz­ing the funding problem. 
Blagojevich spokesman Lueio Guerrero said the gov­ernor was happy to talk with Meeks but it was up to the legislature to approve fund­ing. 
Meeks spokeswoman Tasha !farris said all boycotting chil­dren should have returned to school Thursday. Schools spokeswoman Anitra Schulte had no immediate detail on the day's turnout, but said first-day attendance Tuesday had actually risen from last year, despite the boycott.

Five sect members, ineluding Jeffs, have been indicted in Schleicher County for sexual assault of a child; several have also been charged with bigamy. A sixth FLDS member is charged with failing to report. child abuse, a misdemeanor. Jeffs, convicted as an accom­plice to rape in Utah, remains jailed in Arizona where he awaits trial on charges stem­ming from the alleged under­age marriage of sect girls. 
Crimmins said the agency never intended to take the FLDS children from their par­ents pnrmanently. 
"We never brought the kids into care to keep them in care. We brought them into care to do an efficient and effective investigation," he said. 
Jessica Dixon, a law profes­sor who oversees the child advocacy clinic at. Southern Methodist University in Dallas, said CPS cases do sometimes result in children quickly being dropped from court supervi­sion, even after initial foster placement. But it doesn't hap­pen often. 
To remove a child, "legally, you've got to be able to show risk," she said. 
CPS now usually looks for a way children can remain with their parents safely, Dixon said, though she noted that cases of alleged sexual abuse will usually trigger swifter action. 
"In most child welfare courts, they're going to bn safe rather than sorry, and in some cases, that will result in removals that shouldn't have happened," she said. 
Since the April raid and ran­corous custody case, the FLDS, which believe polygamy brings glorification in heaven, has said it will not sanction mar­riages of underage girls. The seet is a breakaway of the Mormon church, which renounced polygamy more than a century ago.

spokesman Patrick Crimmins said more cases are likely to be dropped but he was unsure how many. 
They're being dropped "as fast as we can because it's a burden on everyone," he said. 
He said the dismissals do not mean that abuse never oceurred, only that many of the children can safely live with a parent or other relative ­something that sect members and lawyers argued early on in the chaotic custody case. 
"It most certainly goes back to the idea that the proper way to have conducted this process was to get evidence as to what children, if any, were at risk," said Cynthia Martinez, a spokeswoman for Texas RioGrande Legal Aid, which represented dozens of mothers in the case. "They went through this ordeal, and in the end, CPS found they were a good parent." 
The ehildren of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of' Latter Day 
ties had the chil­
dren at a San Angelo shelter, they said the sect members refused to coop­erate with the investigation, refusing to give last names or identify parents or siblings. CPS officials said they had no choice but to treat all the chil­dren as potentially members of the same family.. 
They were scattered to foster care facilities across the state in April and remained there for_ about two months until the Texas Supreme Court ruled that authorities were wrong to take all the children. Half the children sent to foster care were younger than 6. 
When state District Judge Barbara Walther ordered them returned to their parents in June, she also ordered them to stay in Texas, take parenting classes, allow psychological assessments and be available to investigators from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. every day.

Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej hopes the vote will allow him to keep his job while placating the People's Alliance for Democracy, which has vowed to continue its cam­paign, including occupying the seat of government, until Samak quits. 
The referendum will ask the public to choose between the alliance and the government, but many analysts say a simple yes-no vote is insufficient in the face of a complicated political crisis. 
The alliance ridiculed the plan, saying Samak will manip­ulate the vote, just as they allege he did during general elections in December 2007. 
"The referendum is an. attempt by Mr. Samak to buy himself some more time in the office," Sondhi Limthongkul, a media tycoon and one of the protest leaders, told The Associated Press. 
Before announcing the refer­endum, which caught the nation by surprise, Samak delivered a combative speech on national radio, again refus­ing to step down. 
"I will not abandon the ship, and I will take responsibility for the crew on board," Samak said, peppering his speech with folksy language. "I am not resigning. I have to protect the democracy of this country." 
But some have said the refer­endum could aggravate rather than alleviate the political deadlock. 
"A referendum is normally used to test public approval on whether to go to war or pass an important law. It would not be effective as a tool to solve a complicated political crisis with many conditions and layers," said Panithan Wattanayagorn, a political science professor at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University. 
"The problem is complex and nuanced and asking a yes or no question will only further divide the country," Panithan said. 
Before any referendum can be held, the Senate must pass a law because current statutes do not provide for the possibility. Samak said once the law is passed, it would take about a month to hold the vote. 
The alliance, which claims to be apolitical, is a loosely knit group of royalists, wealthy and middle-class urban residents, and union activists. It wants Parliament to be revamped so most lawmakers are appointed rather than elected, arguing that Thailand's impoverished rural majority is too susceptible to vote buying. 
The group has already had a hand in bringing down one gov­ernment, when it staged demonstrations in 2006 that paved the way for the bloodless coup that removed then Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra from office. 
Thaksin, a telecommunica­tions tycoon, recently f1ed to Britain to escape corruption charges. The protesters say Samak is Thaksin's stooge and is running the government for him by proxy. They accuse Samak's government of corrup­tion and making unconstitution­al decisions. 
After months of protests in the capital, thousands of PAD supporters stormed the gates of the Government House, the stately domed building that houses Samak's office, on Aug. 
26. They have occupied the compound's lush lawns, set up a thriving community under tents and refused to budge. 
Even though Samak imposed a state of emergency on Bangkok on Tuesday, the mili­tary has not stepped in to evict the protesters for fear it would lead to a bloodbath. 
Rioting between supporters of Samak and the alliance left one person dead and dozens injured early Tuesday, the only violence since the deadlock began.

Medical staff strike cripples hospitals 
Associated Press 
GAZA CITY -A walkout of medical staff throughout Gaza has strained services at hospitals and clinics throughout the terri­tory, the latest in a series of crip­pling strikes that are deepening bitter divisions between Gaza's militant Hamas rulers and loyal­ists of moderate Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. 
The strike has forced non­complying doctors to pull double shifts and left residents strug­gling for treatment, adding to the hardships in a territory suf­fering from international isola­tion since Hamas wrested con­trol of Gaza from Fatah-allied security forces in June 2007. 
The Medical Workers' Union, dominated by Abbas' Fatah movement, called the strike last week to demand Hamas rein­state workers Fatah says have been fired for their political loy­alties. The union said Hamas police have forced some essen­tial staff to report to duty under the threat of arrest. 
Hamas has accused Fatah of calling the walkout at state-run hospitals and clinics as a politi­cal ploy -but has aggravated the crisis by shutting down pri­vate clinics run by striking doc­tors. 
Around half of Gaza's thou­sands of doctors, nurses and administrative medical workers have walked off the job since last week, according to the World Health Organization. Hospital workers carried out a similar strike last year after Hamas fired several senior doc­tors, but the doctors weren't rehired and the slowdown fiz­zled after five days. 

Gaza hospitals are barely grinding along because working doctors and nurses are putting in 12-hour to 24-hour shifts and running on skeleton staff, many only treating emergency cases. Many clinics are closed. 
"I want to ask something. The doctors and nurses that went on strike, if their son or brother is sick, will they watch him die?'' asked Mohammed Musa, an unemployed, 36-year-old father who could not find a doctor to treat his son's fever. 
Union leader Osama Najjar said hundreds of medical staff were called in for interrogations, and dozens of pro-Fatah employees have been fired and replaced with Hamas loyalists. 
Mahmoud Zahar, a top Hamas leader and physician by training, said the government had to take action because key staff were not turning up. He said there isn't enough medical staff in Gaza to replace strikers, prompting police to force them to work.

A class by class guide to a Notre Dame football weekend 
After impatiently waiting for the past nine months, and avoiding excuses for that abomination of a season, it's morning again at Notre Dame. Our football team is back in 
action this weekend, and campus is mor­phing to account for it. Trash cans are being put everywhere, food stand equipment is 


being laid across Bob Kessler 
campus, tempo­rary fences are House ofStix being erected and alums have start­ed arriving on campus. Notre Dame is a different place on a football week­end, and this list should get every­body in the mood, and remind each class of students of what they are supposed to do throughout the week­end. 
Freshmen: 

Watch Hudy on Thursday night. Go to the pep rally on Friday. Attend Drummer's Cirele at midnight. Wear The Shirt on Saturday. Watch the Band play at Bond Hall Arrive at the game 45 minutes before kickoff Do the cheers incorrectly Try to start The Wave in the 3rd quarter. Eat at the Candlelight Dinner in South Dining Hall. Fall asleep early. 
Sophomores: 

Pregame the Pep Hally with beer and/or liquor. Lead dorm cheers on the way to the JACC. Host an oppo­nent themed party such as "Beat them Back to the Aztec Era" where everybody comes dressed as an Aztec Warrior. Wake up early after the party to sell Brats and Burgers at a dorm/club concession stand. Head out to the Stadium Lot with a group of friends looking for some friendly alums or a random friend's relative to give you free food. Arrive at the game 25 minutes before kickoff to watch the band perform. Complain about the freshmen doing cheers wrong in the 1st quarter. Purchase a platter of Nachos in the 2nd quarter. Try to start The Wave in the 4th quarter. Order Pizza in the Dorm after the game. 
Juniors: 

Utilize fake IDs at Club Fever on Thursday Night. Attend the Pep Hally on Friday. Complain about the length of the Pep Rally. Party at the oppo­nent themed party, but ditch early for Washington Street. Wake up in mid­morning and watch College GameDay. Complain about Lee Corso's anti­Notre Dame comments. Wear The Shirt or a green Brady Quinn jersey. Drink some beer at a relative's tail­gate. Hun from the cops through the Stadium parking lot. Arrive at the game five minutes before Kickoff with a good buzz going. Complain about The Wave. Get a free dinner from your roommates parents after the game. Fall asleep early while watch­ing College Football Final. Complain about Mark May on Sunday morning 
Seniors: 
Go to Finnegan's on Thursday Night. Skip the Pep Rally with an enormous hangover. Welcome recent Alums back for a party on Friday Night. Wake up early on Saturday for Tailgating. Wear whatever you want to wear, which probably isn't The Shirt. Host a tailgate at an oiT campus house or at the Hadio Tower lot. Keep BAC high enough so that you can feel free to yell loudly whenever you like about how Matt Leinart and Heggie Bush ruined the best moment of your life. Shotgun approximately seven beers in the 90 minutes leading up to kickoff. Stumble into the game 10 minutes after kickoff because you were busy playing one last round of Can Of Shame. Participate in one out of every seven cheers. Complain that the sophomore year Leprechaun was way better than this one. Walk home to OfT-Campus house after game. Go to The Backer at night. Sing/yell "Oh What a Night." Pass Out at home. Watch Entourage on Sunday night. 
Freshmen/Sophomores/Juniors/Sen­iors: 
Do it all again next weekend! 
Now that we're all clear on the game plan, let's go out and do it.

Eulogy for my ND classmate, Steve Pallucca 
Thirty-nine years ago this evening, we Notre Dame freshmen from Lyons Hall eagerly trekked across campus to witness our first football pep rally in the old Field House. Ara Parseghian and his players appeared on a bal­cony as though standing on a cloud above the crowd. The reverberating sounds of the band mixed with the stu­dent cheers drowned out any conversation among us. We could merely gesture in jubilation during our exciting experience. 
At the rally's conclusion, we experienced our first "cattle call." Students pushed so hard and close together during their exit from the building that I and my classmate, Stephen Raymond Pallucca, both jumped up about a foot so that the crowd carried us above the dirt floor without ever touch­ing the ground. Despite my fear of falling under the stampede, Steve marveled at how his 280-pound frame never wavered during the exit. While dropping back to his feet outside he said, "I love the first game of a season." 
We never thought that following our freshman year Steve would only enjoy 38 more opening season game days. Looking back, his life could not have been a more heroic and humorous time mixed with tragedy. He was our campus John Belushi, endearing himself to everyone he met with a reservoir of jokes and entertaining rou­tines. Lookfug through old photographs, it is remarkable how much he actually did look like Belushi. 

The Pallucca family owned a grocery store, and fed Steve's discriminating pallet with exotic foods. Opening his care pack­ages became a dorm event, anticipating what delicacies awaited discovery ... even at the end of his supply. With the premier foods gone, I noticed that the more hungry we were after midnight. the more willing we became to try some ofhis personal favorites -Kipper Snacks, smoked oys­ters, sardines and anchovies. 
Life with Steve at times was not easy. He smoked Wrnstons and stayed awake at least until 4 a.m., well past other late-night owls. Steve was a prankster and instigator. Senior year, one early morning after the bars had closed, I opened the door ofmy single to find the soda machine brightly shinning in my face. Without a beat, I plopped on what was available of my unus­able day bed and fell immediately to sleep. My camera's film revealed the culprits ­Steve was among those posing around the machine. 
College life for Steve was not all fun and games. Some courses posed problems either in content or as a result ofhis atti­tude. A nun at St. Mary's College chastised him once by saying that he would never get along in life with his attitude. As he further explained, "Failing geometry twice merely proves that I am a student of literature." 
On a whim, Steve assembled a slate and ran for sophomore class president. The campaign turned serious when I lent my efforts to his election. Students today can thank him for breaking the sophomore car restriction by arranging to pave a new lot near Grace Hall. He also led an experimen­tal sophomore parents weekend during football season, complete with hundreds of 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Fair-trade in line with mission statement 
If we do away with fair trade coffee for the sake of cost efficiency, let's just get rid of locally grown veggies too and the organic choco­late from the Huddle that donates a portion of its profits to wildlife. 
Forcing students to pay for the difference in fair trade coffee ver­sus free trade coffee is such a minute and minimal aspect of the required meal plan. The meal plan requirement is the real issue in question. 
Realizing that Dan Kamp ("Stop wasting my money," Sept. 4) is not arguing for or against fair trade coffee, I'm not writing to argue about ethics. Simply, fair trade coffee is not the only item in the meal plan that isn't the most cost effective alternative. Maybe, just maybe, there's a reason beyond cost that Notre Dame promotes fair trade items or locally grown products. 
Supporting human rights and human endeavor -yeah, that's all part of Catholic social teaching. Living in accordance with Catholic social teaching is not confined to involvement in the Center for Social Concerns. We don't recycle because we like to spend more money on numerous types of waste receptacles. We recycle because being a steward of the Earth is also part of Catholic social teaching. 
The University does not spend money frivolously on "their own ethical qualms." Please. These "ethical qualms" are not merely their own. By the simple fact that you attend Notre Dame, you are subject to Catholic ethics in all areas of life -from theology course requirements to traditions like opening mass at the beginning of the school year. Why should the standards for food be any differ­ent? 
The University is not here to "[hold] others hostage to [its] own set of values." The last time I checked, the Notre Dame mission statement says, "What the University asks of all its scholars and students, however, is not a particular creedal affiliation, but a respect for the objectives of Notre Dame ... " 
Granted, the meal plan is expensive, but the requirement itself is the real issue -not the promotion of Catholic social teaching over cost-effective, economic consumerism..

game tickets for parents. His success got him reelected president junior year. 
Steve's humanity was at times larger than life. He taught me generosity through his charity and apathy offinancial gain. Steve's dad, "Big Ray," taught Steve a love of mankind and the duty of charity. Raymond would always sign his notes, "Be good, be careful, I love you. Your Old Man." Together they shared a devotion to Our Lady and her university. Attending Notre Dame was the purpose of Steve's life. Graduation was the fulfillment of his life's goal. 
Following graduation, Steve attended Washburn law school for a year and a half. He fondly said that he learned to handle mayhem, but not murder. His Catholicism, Italian heritage and rotund physical stature did not fit that campus. I once sent him $5 to "buy a beer" which he showed to a classmate when he had no cash. He said, "Now that is a true friend." 
When asked ifhe ever had any regrets, Steve replied, "I never filled out a job appli­cation." But I recently found a note describing his application to teach in a high school after our graduation. Eventually Steve settled into a routine which he described, "As a graduate ofliterature, I have become a maker ofbooks." 
An avid football fan, Steve taught himself how to handicap games. He could bet on an opening point spread, bet against him­self as points adjusted, and eventually be guaranteed wins by combining overs and unders-numerical science only a litera­ture student can understand. 
The test in Steve's life came when his father developed Alzheimer's disease. For nearly a decade, Steve cared for Raymond at the nursing home. He discovered 1940's sayings like, "hubba hubba," made Ray laugh. Eventually, Ray did not know Steve but said, "Here comes that man again." 
During this time Steve found refuge in substances. He nearly died 15 years ago with Cardiomyopathy, having been induced into a coma. Steve said that he never remembered anything while in the coma. But he confessed that he prayed to the Lady on the Golden Dome -he would clean himself up ifshe gave him another chance. 
Their agreement ended in early July. Yet he was able to speak with classmates at reunion this spring. Faces beamed as they once did nearly 40 years ago while speak­ing with him on the phone. Steve was a Kansas classic who became a Notre Dame Oass icon. 
It is typical of Steve's life that the last per­son to see him was in a grocery store. Steve bought the groceries for a town drunk who could barely care for his family through odd jobs. Steve's love of mankind was no less than angelic for the company he kept was a modern-day version of Gentiles, tax collectors and stray animals. 
No doubt, Steve was my best friend from college. I sent him an iPod which he used while riding his bicycle 20 miles a day. My telephone recorded his voice, "It arrived. You are the king, and I salute you!" 
No, my friend and classmate-especial­ly during this, your favorite first football weekend -for all ofthe life lessons you taught me, I salute you.

Implications of our ethics 
Dan Kamp ("Stop wasting my money," Sept. 4) seems to argue that we do not have a common responsibility to construct a better and more just world. He contends that the fair-trade coffee on campus is an imposition of the ethics of a "sub­set of the student body." 
It would be one thing to criticize the choice of fair-trade coffee, but not on ethical grounds, only because there may be better ways for our campus community to support dignity and jus­tice internationally. We, as a university, as a society and as individuals, have a responsibility to act out Christian love, dignity and justice in everything we do. The fact that our community encourages things like fair-trade coffee and going green is laudable, and such efforts help us engage in the most important issues in our world. 
However, there is still a long way to go, for 
Be 
considerate 
Dear students, We hope you've had a great start in these first few 
weeks of classes and are looking forward to a very suc­cessful year. As we prepare for the first football game of the season, it is important for all of us to remember to be considerate to those around us, particularly residents of the South Bend area. ln order to sustain a positive rela­tionship with the local community, we encourage you to be good neighbors this weekend. By demonstrating mature judgment, we, as a student body, will continue to improve 
the relations between Notre Dame and South Bend.

example, the University has not made serious efforts to pay a living wage to our thousands of workers. We can and should debate the best way to apply our commitment to social justice, but it is undeniable that we have a .responsibility to our fellow brothers and sisters in all our actions. 
Compassion and justice should be our values, and applying them to what the University buys and promotes is the responsible thing to do. In the same way our ethical principles guide our lives, our society and university should reflect our community's ongoing conversation about how best to promote social justice and human dignity.

CENE 
It has the largest collection of Olmec art in North America, with artifacts covering more than 3000 years of Mexico's mother culture­the Olrnec Civilization's history. It contains Native American art predating European contact, countless paintings from the last live centuries and is currently exhibiting Hichard Serra's groundbreaking Arc of the Curve and Paths & Edges. But most Notre Dame· stu­dents have never been inside. 
The Snite Museum of the Arts sits in the silhouette of Notre Dame Stadium, but its col­lections are anything but overshadowed. 
Located immediately to the east the of museum's main entrance is The Dragon and the Goddess: Olmee Art and Its Legacy exhib­it, which houses over 270 works of art, more than HO of which are Olmec, and 169 of which were made before A.D. 250. The gallery is the museum's largest collection and one which Gina Costa, the Museum's Public Helations and Marketing Specialist, says is the most important Mesoamerican collection outside~ of Mexieo City. 
And it is. 

The gallery eontains artifacts and sculp­tures from the Aztec, the Toltec, the Mayan and the Teotihuacan Civilizations. to name a few. Notable among them is the "God L Helief Panel" attributed to Toltec and Mayan culture of the Late Classic and Early Post Classie periods (A.D. 850-950). God L, the Lord of Hell, can be seen smoking a cigar in the stone sculpture. 
Also eye-catching is the basalt sculpture "Palma depi!~ting the God of Death as a ballplayer holding a knife and a severed head" from the Classic Veracruz Culture (A.D. 700-900), which nearly resembles the shape of a tiara. 
In the center of the exhibit there are selec­tions from the museum's collection of Spanish Colonial Christian art interpreted by Indian and Latino artists, including a stone Atrial Cross with the face of Christ and instruments of the passion, i.e. torture devices, carved into it. The cross predates the conquest of the Aztec Empire. 
But the Olmec collection is only one of many at the Snite Museum of the Arts. 
On the upper level of the museum are the 18th and 19th Century Galleries. the American Gallery and the Beardsley 20th and 21st Century Gallery. The 18th and 19th Century Galleries contain works by numerous European artists including Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot, Franr;ois Boucher, Gerard de Lairesse and Charles Louis Muller, who's "Holl Call of the Last Victims of the Reign of Terror" calls out pertinently from a wall in the Virginia A. Marten Gallery. 
In the American Gallery, Father William J. Corby, CSC, can be seen addressing troops of the Irish Brigade on July 2, 1863 at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania in Paul Henry Wood's "Absolution Under Fire," which he painted at the age of 19 in 1891. Demanding attention from the other side of the room with its stunningly bright color scheme hangs Jeanette Pasin Sloan's more modern, acrylic on canvas, "Mercato Stripes," (1983) which shows chalices reflecting off one another. Inside the Beardsley Gallery are a number of contemporary art pieces including Kenneth Snelson's "Mozart 1," whose shadow is almost as impressive as the intricate brass tubing'"'· and wire design creating it. 
The lower level of houses the Arts of Afri

has also exhibited work at the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, the Netherlands, and a retrospective on his work in New York at that dty's Museum of Modern Art. Hardly one to shy away from political content in his work, in 2006 Serra showed a litho cray­on drawing of an Abu Grahib prisoner with the caption "STOP BUSH" at New York's Whitney Museum of American Art. The drawing was then adapted for promotional materials surround­ing the Whitney's Biennial show. lie has also worked with video as an artistic medium. 
Like his sculpture, his collec­tion of prints currently being shown at the Snite is often focused on pushing the bound­aries of printmaking. With alter­native sizing and dimensions, the prints are fascin;;tting, dominat­ing pieces of art. The exhibit con­sists of 26 prints from two of Serra's collections, 2004's "Are of the Curve" and 2007's "Paths and Edges." The prints will appear at the Snite courtesy of collector Paul Schupl', in honor of Rev. 

Theodore  M. Hesburgh.  The  
exhibit  is  scheduled  to  run  
through Octobnr 12th.

If 2005's "X&Y" was Coldplay's way of becoming more commercial and connecting 
the masses, then their latest alb_um, "Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends" must be the band's way of showing that they 
;can be boldly experimental while still con­necting with the masses. Three years in the making, Viva Ia Vida is, as it's opening track "Life in Technicolor" suggests, bursting with color and life. Chris Martin, Johnny Buckland, Will Champion, and Guy Berryman are still the Coldplay we have grown to know and love with their brooding ballads and heartfelt songs about love, and doubts and fears, but this time around they've put their musical chops on full display en route to recreating their sound. It may not connect 
Viva Ia Vida or Death and All His Friends 
Coldplay Released by: Capitol Records Recommended Tracks: "Viva La Vida", "Lost!", and "Lovers in Japan" 
By SHANE STEINBERG 
Scene Writer 

A flier outside the Laurel Tree, a local Camden club, read "January 16th, 1998, Starfish + others live at the Laurel Tree". A one-man tech crew could be seen through the crowd of rowdy teenagers on the decrepit stage setting up microphones for the night's act. Around one hundred and fif­teen people were stuffed into a room, all of them unable to maneuver their way through the commotion. Backstage, ready to lay their musical aspirations on the line for the first time was the band Starfish. Yes, Starfish. Not exactly the name of a band anyone in their right mind would expect to make it in the music industry. 
But here we are, ten years, four studio albums, five EPs, and one name change later, and Coldplay is selling out the world's largest arenas and topping charts in every­where from Chile to Malaysia. Coldplay may have started out at the Laurel Tree by mak­ing the mistake of playing the same song twice in a row under a band name they had come up with an hour before taking the stage, but now, as lead singer Chris Martin said in a recent television appearance, "it doesn't get any bigger than us." 
Of course Coldplay didn't start out selling millions of albums and headlining shows at Madison Square Garden. No, their humble beginnings as four Brits trying to make it big with listeners as much as "A Rush of Blood to the Head" and it most certainly isn't as dreamy and moodily dramatic as their debut album "Parachutes," but "Viva la Vida," despite its shortcomings, is in fact a resound­ing experimental success that has solidified Coldplay's status as one today's fmest bands. 
From the band's newly dawned 19th centu­ry French peasant army attire, to the album artwork, to the title track, Coldplay seems to scream revolution from every which way. It's no "OK Computer" or "The Joshua Tree". Then again, Coldplay isn't exactly sticking to their formula this time around. Sure, tracks like "Lovers in Japan" and "Lost?" could have come from any other Coldplay album, but they're still worthy nonetheless. Meanwhile "42" sounds like nothing before it while "Lost!," "Chinese Sleep Chant", and "Str~wberry Swing," although not revolution­ary, are surely uncharted waters for Coldplay. 
Viva Ia Vida starts ofT quite appropriately 
with a beautifully celebratory instrumental 
prelude that truly lives up to its name, "Life 
in Technicolor". Next up is "Cemeteries of 
London", which despite its dreary name is 
actually mellow, and sees Martin's voice 
operating at a lower register, which is quite 
common throughout the album. Following 
"Cemeteries of London" are a host of truly 
engrossing, contemplative songs, that 
includes the likes of "Lost!" with its drum­
circle flare and engaging lyrics, "Lovers in 
Japan", a pure Coldplay ballad with a great 
hook, the title track "Viva la Vida", a truly 
inventive, unbelievably catchy portrayal of a 
dethroned king recounting his fall from 
with piano laden ballads started with a lit­
tle-known song called "So Sad" and their 
first attention grabber, "Ode to Deodorant." 
From there they released five EPs, the most 
popular of which, Brothers and Sisters, 
helped garner them a spot with a major 
record label in 1999. 
The very next year, Coldplay released its 
first studio album, Parachutes, an incredibly 
well-crafted debut with a singular resound­
ing message as well as a breakthrough hit, 
"Yellow," which put Coldplay into the public 
consciousness. Having earnfld a Grammy 
award and beHn nominated for the presti­
gious Mereury Prize, Coldplay returned in 
2002 with what is arguably their best 
album, "A Rush of Blood to The Head." 
Both genuinely moving and eonsistently 
majestic from the first note to the last, "A 
Rush of Blood to The Head" reeeived over­
whelming critical acclaim and served notice 
that Coldplay was not just another flash in 
the pan. 

2005 saw what may very well be 
Coldplay's only misstflp in ten years. "X&\"' 
was Coldplay's way of creating more main­
stream music and while it was successful 
commercially, it lacked in many ways and 
for a while it seemed as though the band 
had traded itself in to please the masses. 
Then, three years later, Coldplay finally 
released their fourth, much-awaited album, 
the oddly but aptly titled "Viva Ia Vida or 
Death and All His Friends." This fourth 
effort saw the band aim for the stratosphere 
-~--­
power, but the true standout in the album is "42." Ingeniously dark and artistically abra­sive, "42", with its brooding lyrics and sud­den change of course into what initially seems like a completely different song, is the revolution Coldplay had been hopfng to achieve with this album. 
Of course "Viva Ia Vida" does have its fair share of missteps. To being with, it is over­produced and spotty in both quality and in delivering a central message with each song. Songs like "Chinese Sleep Chant" which, lets face it, is better ofT skipped than· listened to, and "Reign Of Love" have no business being in the album. "Chinese Sleep Chant" sounds like a bad impression of My Bloody Valentine and "Reign Of Love" almost feels like a rehashed version of "A Rush Of Blood to the Head" minus the artistic genius. Redefining one's sounds isn't always a good thing when an editing eye isn't used, and such is definite-. ly the case with "Viva la Vida." 
When all is said and done, "Viva la Vida" isn't Coldplay's best album. It simply takes a longer time to digest, because, upon first listen it tends to bewilder rather than immediately pierce the listener like Coldplay's first two studio albums did. In the end, however, "Viva Ia Vida," which to this point has topped charts throughout the world and has produced a No.1 hit single, is a grand creative leap for a band that has already proven its immense artistic capacity as well as its ability to have commercial suc­cess while staying true to itself. 
with bold experimentation that involved the incorporation of many new international sounds, new dimensions of Chris Martin's voice, and evolved songwriting, all of which made the album an instant success. 
Coldplay's formula f.or success mixes a knack for piercing song writing, a flair for moodily dramatic craftsmanship, and an ability to maintain a high quality from wire to wire while striking gold numerous times on each album. Their music manages to be dark one song yet vivid the very next. It is a culmination of thoughts on love. ruminations .... on fears and doubts, and reflections on the journey of finding oneself, all of which the band has managed to stay true to since crossing the threshold to the mainstream. 
In ten years, Coldplay has risen from the depths of tiny clubs in the heart of Camden to a headlining mega-band with an automat­ic success factor. They've been through it all. They've sold 35 million albums (and count­ing), won three Grammy awards, received positive (and ne,gative) comparisons to Radiohead and U2, been accused of ripping of another band in the song "Viva Ia Vida", and, most importantly, have provided the world with a brand of dreamy Britpop that trulytranscends the shortcomings of today's music industry. 
With music as good as their's, who knows, maybe they could have actually gotten away with the name Starfish.

league overall 

COLUMBUS, Ohio­Ohio State coach Jim Tressel said tailback Chris "Beanie" Wells will not play when the third­ranked Buckeyes take on Ohio on Saturday. 
Wells injured his right foot in last weekend's 43­0 victory over Youngstown State. He has not practiced with the team this week and has spent much of the time wearing a protective boot. 
"Beanie won't go this week," Tressel said Thursday afternoon. "I feel good about his progress, but it wasn't enough progress to prac­tice through yesterday." 
Asked if he worries that Wells may not be avail­able when the Buckeyes play at No. 1 Southern California on Sept. 13, Tressel added: ·"No, not at all. Not at all. But that's easy to say today." 
The junior running back was considered one of the top contenders for the Reisman Trophy behind returning winner Tim Tebow of Florida. Despite several nagging injuries last year, Wells rushed for 1,609 yards and 15 touchdowns. 
Ohio State has not allowed him to speak with reporters since he was injured, although he was 
IN BRIEF Cubs' Zambrano diagnosed
with shoulder tendonitis 
CHICAGO -Cubs ace Carlos Zambrano has right rotator cuff ten­dinitis and inflammation, an MRI con­firmed Thursday, a potential obstacle to Chicago's chances of winning the World Series for the first time in a cen­tury. 
Zambrano received a shot of anti­inflammatory medication and hopes to return to the rotation next week. 
General manager Jim Hendry said Zambrano hopes to start throwing again when the team begins a series in St. Louis on Sept. 10. If all goes well, Zambrano would start at Houston in the following series. 
Zambrano, 13-5 this year, left his start Tuesday night against the Astros after five innings, saying he did not feel well. He was examined Wednesday by team orthopedist Dr. Stephen Gryzlo. 
Zambrano is 1-1 over his last six starts and has made it past the fifth inning only twice. 
quoted as saying by a team spokesman that he was relieved that X-rays had not shown any bro­ken bones. He was seen walking between meet­ings at the team's prac­tice facility on Tuesday, carrying the protective boot while gingerly mak­ing his way in stockinged feet. 
Running backs coach Dick Tressel, Jim's older brother, said on Wednesday night that Wells had not been per­mitted to have contact, or to even put weight on his injured foot. 
"Any time you have a foot injury and you have to tote around 238 pounds at high velocity, it's a day-by-day thing," he said. 
Jim Tressel said Chris Wells' inability to practice all but prevented him from playing against Ohio. 
"I think there's a little bit of risk when you don't practice, not just in the injury department but in the execution depart­ment," he said. 
The Buckeyes will rotate Maurice Wells (who is no relation), Brandon Saine and Dan Herron at the position.

NFL officially recognizes
Bengals' 'Ocho Cinco' CINCINNATI -Call him Ocho Cinco on the field, too. 
The National Football League decid­ed on Thursday to recognize receiver Chad Johnson's legal name change to Chad Ocho Cinco. The new name will be on the back of his Cincinnati Bengals uniform for the season open­er in Baltimore on Sunday. 
The receiver had his name changed in his home state of Florida last week. It's a reference to his uniform number -Ocho Cinco means "eight five" in Spanish. When the NFL celebrated Hispanic Heritage month in 2006, he wore it on the back of his uniform for pregame warmups, but had to remove it for the game because of NFL rules -itwasn't his real name. 
The Pro Bowl receiver asked the media to start calling him by his new name this week. The Bengals couldn't change the name on his uniform until the NFL gave permission. 
Federer reaches 18th 
consecutive major final 
NEW YORK-Roger Federer edged 130th-ranked qualifier Gilles Muller 7-6 (5), 6-4, 7-6 (5) at the U.S. Open on Thursday to reach the semi­finals for the 18th consecutive Grand Slam tournament 
It was Federer's 32nd victory in a row at Flushing Meadows, where he has won the past four championships. 
Despite playing a man who never before was past the third round at a major event, Federer had some trou­ble. He wasted six set points in the opener but closed it out on his sev­enth chance when Muller missed a backhand volley. Federer only went 1-for-11 on break-point chances. 
No other man has played in more than 10 major semifinals in a row. Bidding for a 13th Grand Slam title, which would move him one shy of Pete Sampras' record, Federer will meet No. 3 Novak Djokovic or No. 8 Andy Roddick in the semifinals.

Will Venable hit his first eareer homer and the San Diego Padres beat Milwaukee Thursday night, handing the slumping Brewers their fourth straight loss. 
Nick Hundley and Luis Hodriguez each drove in two runs for San Diego, which had lost nine straight on the road and is tied with Washington and Seattle for the fewest wins in the majors. 
With all of the NL's playoff hopefuls taking the day off, maybe Milwaukee should have, too. The Brewers' wild-card lead was trimmed to four games over Philadelphia, and they fell live games behind NL Central-leading Chicago with 22 games left. 
Fresh off being swept by the New York Mets, Milwaukee fell to 0-4 on a 10-game homes­land, but this loss was much more troubling. 
The Padres, mired in last in the NL West, took advantage of every opportunity Jeff Suppan (10-8) and Milwaukee gave them. 
San Di.ego eliminated Milwaukee from postseason contention in its visit last year before the Brewers won the final two of the season to force the Padres into a one-game playoff with Colorado for the wild card that the Rockies won. 
In this four-game series, only San Diego can play spoiler, but the Brewers' problems were self-inflicted Thursday. Milwaukee stranded nine run­ners after leaving 26 on in the series against the Mets. 

Shawn Estes (2-1), making his first start since May after being sidelined with a broken left thumb, allowed one run and seven hits over six innings for San Diego. Trevor Hoffman allowed a leadoff single to Jason Kendall in the ninth before finishing for his 28th save. 
Suppan, who had won his last five decisions and posted a 
3.00 EHA since July 1, strug­gled against the youthful Padres. 
Venable, who was called up from Triple-A Portland last Friday, went deep in the sixth in his sixth big league game. Suppan was chased minutes later after loading the bases on a single to Hundley, an error and an intentional walk. Hodriguez's sacrifice fly off Guillermo Mota gave San Diego a 5-1 lead. 
Hundley had a sacrifice fly in the second and a two-out RBI double in the fourth. Rodriguez's fifth-inning single drove in Brian Giles, who slid in just around Kendall's tag at the plate. . 
J .J. Hardy hit his 22nd homer off Mike Adams in the seventh, cutting the lead to 5­2. 
Milwaukee had its chances, stranding two runners in the first, two in the second, one in the third, three in the fourth after loading the bases with one out and one in the ninth.

NFL 
Fins circle around Favre 
Associated Press 
DAVIE, Fla. -The messages are spread in black paint across the Miami Dolphins' locker room walls. 
"The fastest way to lose is divi­sion from within," reads one wall. 
"Miami Dolphins players have the makeup!" exclaims another slogan. 
The new regime has tried all sorts of gimmicks to get players motivated. Defensive coordinator Paul Pasqualoni, inheriting one of the NFCs worst units, has fed players old stories and an intense attitude to get them hyped. 
Despite all the offseason tricks, the greatest motivation Pasqualoni gave his defense came in the playbooks this week: stopping Brett Favre and the New York Jets. 
''lie's just such a veteran and has had such a great career and can take over a game," Pasqualoni said Thursday. "He's one of those quarterbacks that can beat you. It's just going to be a big ehallenge going into this game, trying to play with this guy and trying to contain him." 
Trying to contain anyone -let alone a three-time MVP quarter­back -was tough enough last season lor the Dolphins. 
Miami is coming off a 1-15 sea­son that was a defensive mess. The Dolphins ranked last in the AFC in 2007 in scoring defense, giving up 27.3 points a game. 
And some of the best players -Jason Taylor and Zach Thomas -are gone, and an anonymous group is faced with trying to stop the quarterback who broke Dan Marino's touch­down record. 
"I know the kind of quarter­back he is. He's no different than the other 31 quarterbacks in the league," safety Chris Crocker said, chuckling. "lie's just a Hall of Farner. So, you know, I can't say he's too much different." 
The defense has a weapon to help game-plan against Favre: Chad Pennington. 

Perhaps no one knows the Jets' offense better than Pennington, who spent the past eight seasons as the Jets quarterback before he was released to clear space for Favre. It's a unique tool for the Dolphins, even if it's something they're not ready to admit. 
'Til put it to you like this," cor­nerback Will Allen said, "if we did get some things from Chad, we wouldn't tell you." 
Game planning for Favre ­and the rest of the NFL -has been an offseason in the making for Miami's defense. 
The coaching staff has tried to wipe away any leftovers from the losing attitude that surrounded the NFI.:s worst team. In the case of Pasqualoni, the former line­backers coach with the Dallas Cowboys, his favorite tool is sup­plying analogies to keep players interested. 
His defensive motto: Know your assignment, and know you know your assignment. 
But perhaps nothing has res­onated more with the defense than his description of the unit as an old car trying to be "cranked up." 
The metaphor has become a routine discussion among play­ers, who were inspired to create a signature celebration named the "The Flywheel," where they crouch low to the ground and mimic cranking an antique ear after a big play. 
Pasqualoni also has tried to keep players' attention through intimidation, a change from the Cam Cameron-led coaching stafT that seemingly babied players. And Pasqualoni's deep voice has helped. 
Linebacker Channing Crowder, who receives the plays from Pasqualoni in his helmet, called it the "voice of God" last week. Other players also have taken notice. 
MLB 
Injuries, losing streak raise concerns for Cubs· 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -Ryan Dempster stepped out in front of the team's headquarters at the beginning of spring training nearly seven months ago and made a bold statement: He said he thought the Chicago Cubs would win the World Series. 
Dempster's optimism remains intact, despite a recent funk that has seen the first-place Cubs drop five straight games for the first time this season. 
And not only are the Cubs try­ing to weather the losing skid, they learned Thursday that ace Carlos Zambrano has rotator cuff tendinitis, a condition that required an injection of anti­inflammatory medication. 
Zambrano, who will miss his turn Sunday in Cincinnati, hopes to begin throwing in St. Louis when the Cubs go there next Wednesday. 10. And if all goes well, he could rejoin the rotation for a series in Houston and pitch against the Astros. 
"It's a relief knowing Z doesn't have anything more significant than what we thought. And hopefully he'll pitch in Houston, which means he will only miss one turn," general manager Jim Hendry said Thursday. 
So, in the 1OOth anniversary year of their last World Series win, the Cubs are sorting out some major issues. They have 22 games remaining and just six are at Wrigley Field, where they are 51-24. 
"Obviously you lose five in a row and don't play as well as you are capable, it's frustrating for everybody," said Dempster, who has 15 wins after being converted from a closer. "There are better times ahead. I prom­ise that." 
But will those days ahead include Zambrano? Big Z left his start Tuesday 
night after five innings, telling pitching coach Larry Rothschild he didn't feel well and wanted to be taken out. He had been slat­ed to pitch last Sunday but got two days extra rest for what was described as a tired arm. 
!lis right arm was more than just weary. 
Zambrano, on the disabled list in June with a sore shoulder, was examined by team orthope­dist Dr. Stephen Gryzlo and then had an MHI on Thursday that confirmed the original diagno­sis. 
"Dr. Gryzlo has been right-on with all his evaluations this year, and he felt this was not going to be a significant prob­lem," Hendry said. "It was not like the situation where he had to be put on the DL after Tampa. And Carlos never felt it was going to be that serious either." 
Chicago also is taking a cau­tious approach with hard­throwing Hich Harden -who will go 12 days between starts because he has some discomfort in his arm. Sean Marshall will start for Zambrano on Sunday. 
"There's no good time when people are out," Hendry said. "We have a lot of confidence in Marshall, Dempster's had a great year, Ted Lilly's as tough as they come and (Jason) Marquis has been throwing the ball real well." 
Sore arms, bad luck and strange occurrences are part of the Cubs' lore, especially since their 2003 collapse in the NLCS, when they were five outs from their first World Series appear­ance since 1945. In the ensuing seasons, repeated arm problems for Kerry Wood and Mark Prior sidetracked the Cubs and even­tually led to the departures of both manager Dusty Baker and chief executive officer Andy MacPhail. Wood has since returned as a top closer.

Culpeppers rolls out of NFL after 9 seasons 
Former Vikings, Dolphins, and Raiders quarterback anounces retirement after failing to land starting job 
Associated l'ress 
MIAMI -l>auntn Culpeppnr summed up his thoughts Thursday in two words, whieh ushnrml in the start of a nnw era for thP fornwr Pro Bowl quartllrhack. 
"Farewnll NFL," lw wrote. 
With that. a r.arnnr onen

But hn hurt his right krwe in Oetolwr 2005, nnvPr playod for the Vikings again, and never Slwmnd to return to his past lnvnl. oithnr. 
"When frno agnncy lwgan this ynar, I had a nnw snnso of exr.itnmPnt about continuing to rnbuild my carnor in tho samn way that I had rebuilt my krwn aftPr my catastrophic injury in 2005," Culpoppor said. "Unfortunatnly, what I found out was that the ll~ague did not share any of thn opti­mism about me as an unr<~­strietod l'rne agent that I oxpected. In l'aet. there was an overwlwlming snnsn that thoro was no room for me among this year's group of' quarter­backs." 
Tho Miami Dolphins a c q u i r o d h i m i n 2 0 0 (J i n oxd1angn for a soeond-round pick, but CulpPppnr played only four games lwforn being shut. down boeausn of eontin­und knon problnms. 1111 was saeknd 21 times in those f1lur ganws. and his brinf stint with Miami had two compelling images:

-Walking off the field dur­
ing minicamp in June 2007 
because the Dolphins wouldn't 
let him play. and flanked by a 
team security of'lieial. 
"Now that dream to get back on the field and prove every­body wrong is behind him," said Dolphins defensive line­man Vonnie llolliday, who talked to Culpepper about his ongoing comeback qunst this sumnwr. "It has to be tough.... Wlwn lw was healthy, hn was clnl1nitPiy onn of the best." 
Last season, the Oakland Haidnrs took a shot on Culpepper. and he madn fivP starts tlwrn. albnit only getting live touchdown passes in thosn ganws. And ovnr the past few months, lw tried to gel. any opportunity around the leaguP. even saying just last wm~k that lw'd be willing to be Aaron Hodgers' backup in (;reon Bay. 
There were no takers, and Culpnpper saw no reason to kenp waiting. 
"Since I was not given a fair chance to come in and com­pete for a job, I would rather move on and win in othnr are­nas of' life." Culpoppnr said. 
In Minnesota, Culpepper's deeision was met with disap­pointment, evnn though he hadn't played there for years. 
"Very surprising. Surprising that he hasn't gotten a job, too. Sad," Vikings safety Darren Sharper said. "Last year I didn't think he played bad in Oakland. I've seen quarterbacks that are still playing in this league today play a lot worse.... And they still have jobs. So I don't know thn rnason for it." 
Culpepper completed 64 per­ennt of his passes in a nine­year career, with 142 touch­downs. The 6-f'oot-4, 265­pounder out of Central Florida was a thrne-time Pro Bowl selection, and he was at his bnst in 2004, whnn he estab­lished earner-highs in yards (4,717), touchdowns (39) and 


passing rating (110.9). 

Tlwn came the knee injury, and it all went downhill from thoro, even though Culpepper -who has served as his own agent and announced his retirement in an e-mail ­believes he can still compete. 
"No matter what I did or said, there seemed to bo a uni­fied message from teams that I was not welcome to compete for one of the many jobs that were available at the quarter­back position," Culpepper said. 
Culpepper said, without cit­ing anyone by name, that he 
was told he'd get a chance with some teams this season when other quarterbacks got injurml. Friends, family mem­bers and "league personnel" also advised him, Culpepper said, to continue waiting for a chance and postponing any decision on retirement. 
"If he was anywhere close to 100 percent, it would seem teams would have to take a shot at him," Holliday said. "You look at the league and you see a lot of teams don't have that high-profile. quality quarterback." 
Sometime in the past six days, though, Culpnpper's mind was made up. 
"I want to thank my family and my fans for their unwa­vering belief in me as a person and a player," Culpepper said. "I embraced both th1~ peaks and the valleys of thn game and my earner. I am a better pnrson today as a direct result of the experience of playing in the NFL. I can now focus on the enjoyment of watching some of the greatest athletes in the world play tho game I love without the distraction of waiting for thosn nlusive return phone ealls."

NeVVlllan' s injury 111ay 111ake Parman a starter 
Associated Press 
IRVING, Texas -Call him Adam Jones or Pacman. Maybe even call him a starter. 
Because the Dallas Cowboys are wary of corner­back Terence Newman's groin injury, there's a chance .Iones will make his Dallas debut as part of the starting lineup Sunday in Cleveland. 
"Yeah, if we didn't start Newman, Adam .Iones would start," coach Wade Phillips said Thursday. 
Even if Newman can play and starts, he's likely to get more rest than usual ­which still means more play­ing time for Jones in his first NFL game since the finale of the 2006 season. when he was with Tennessee. 
"I don't have a prefer­ence," Phillips said. "I wouldn't want to hold back Adam if that was the case. I feel good about how he's play~d and he is ready to play. 
Newman missed nearly all of training camp, and the entire preseason, while dealing with a slightly torn groin muscle. He returned to practice last week and was listed as fully going through drills Wednesday. On Thursday, however, he was 
listed as limited participa­tion. 
Phillips said there was no setback, just a mistake in the way Newman was listed Wednesday. Phillips said Newman did the same thing both days. 
"I don't definitely say he'll play. It looks good for him right now. But we'll see where he is tomorrow," Phillips said. "I don't think he's completely back yet. We're being cautious and I think that's the right thing to do." 
Newman missed the first two games last season because of a foot injury. The Cowboys eased him back into action, bringing him off the bench each of the next two games. 
"We learned last year about Terence that you need to bring him along slowly when he's missed rather than just throwing him in there," Phillips said. "We kind of winged him in last year and that's pretty much the .same process right now. ... It could be that situation (again). Or it might be that he plays the whole game. I don't have a feel for it yet. We'll see how he did after today's practice and if we're going to limit him some tomorrow or not."

Giants begin title defense 
Super Bowl champs shut down Redskins offense in 16-7 victory 
Associated Press 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. ­The New York Giants won the Super Bowl with defense and they kicked off defense of that title with more of the same. 
Playing without Pro Bowl line­men Michael Strahan and Osi Umenyiora, New York limited the new-look Washington Redskins to 11 first downs and 209 total yards and gave indications that these Giants are back for another run in a 16-7 victory that ushered in the NFL season Thursday night. 
"We played well and it's no sur­prise to us," defensive tackle Barry Cofield said. "We feel like we got capable guys and we held them for very few yards other than the two-niinute situations where the got most of their yardage. We are confident in our defense and feel like if we stick with the scheme we'll have suc­cess all year." 
Super Bowl MVP Eli Manning, Plaxico Burress and the rest of the offense that started the Super Bowl against the New England Patriots also came up big in spoil­ing the debut of Redskins coach Jim Zorn and his West Coast offense. 
Manning capped a game-open­ing 84-yard drive with a 1-yard touchdown run and recently signed John Carney kicked three field goals as the Giants scored on their first four possessions in post­ing a rare home win. They won their final 11 away from Giants Stadium in capturing their third Super Bowl, but they were 3-5 at home, losing the last four games. 
The win capped a fun-filled opening night for Giants fans, who saw the retired Strahan hold up the Lombardi Trophy just minutes before the opening kickoff . 
"It was a great opening to the season," said Manning, who com­pleted 19 of 35 for 216 yards and an interception. "There was a lot of emotion, a lot of excitement. You could feel it in the crowd. It was great to see Michael holding the trophy. 
"It was a great crowd. They were fired up. It was good to play well at home and to win a game at home. It's been a while." 
Coordinator Steve Spagnuolo· and his defense made sure the home woes came to an end. In the process he might have mad~ Hedskins owner Dan Synder think twice about trying harder to hire him. 
Spagnuolo was a serious candi­date to replace Joe Gibbs until backing out to stay with the Giants. 
Zorn eventually got the job, but his offense did little against Spagnuolo's aggressive defense, which limited Washington to three of 13 third-down conver­sions. 
Jason Campbell threw a 12­yard touchdown pass to Santana Moss with 13 seconds to play in the first half to account for the Redskins' points. The score was set up by a Giants' special teams lapse, a 50-yard kickoff return by Rock Cartwright. 

Washington only got in New York territory three times in the game, the last time in the final seconds. 
"A team held us to three and out for over half the game," said Redskins halfback Clinton Portis, who had 84 yards on 23 carries. "We have to be better than that." 
The only concern for the Giants was that defensive end Mathias Kiwanuka went down with an ankle injury on the final play, but he said after the game that he was OK. He was switched from linebacker to end when Umenyiora was lost for the season with a knee injury in the presea­son. 
Other than that the game belonged to the Giants, who have been overlooked when it comes to their chances of repeating. Their odds were 25-1 heading into the game. 
"We are not worried about what people are saying," middle linebacker Antonio Pierce said. "We are trying to win games. You have to get to the Super Bowl to repeat, and if we don't make the playoffs if won't matter. Right now our goal is to win the divi­sion."

Saint Mary's starts year slovvly 
By MIKE GOTIMER Sports Writer 

Entering the first MIAA Jamboree of the season, Saint Mary's had hoped to make some noise and establish itself as the premier team in the conference and one of the pre­mier teams in Division Ill golf. 
The Belles, however, found themselves in a familiar posi­tion after the 18-hole competi­tion, finishing in third place with a cumulative score of 340 behind defending ehampion Olivet College and llope College, who finished with scores of 322 and :n&. respee­tively. 
Despite the third place fin­ish, the Belles had their fair share of strong individual rounds. All five Saint Mary's golfers finished with one of the 25 lowest scores of the tourna­ment. Sophomore Rosie O'Connell's 83 was the low round for the Belles and 1Oth­best in the field. 
The three Saint Mary's fresh­men that started did not disap­point, as each golfer broke 90. Freshman Natalie Matuszak continued hnr solid play and finished right on O'Connell's heels with an 84. good for 11th in the field. Fellow freshman Christine Brown finished with an 85, which tied for the 12th lowest round in the finld. 
Matuszak and Brown's elass­mate Kailey Jacob finished in a tie for the 17th lowest round in the field with her seem~ of 88. Senior Perri Hamma's 92 was tied for the 23th lowest score in the field. 
Olivet's 322 set a new MIM course reeord at the Medalist Golf Club. Olivefs strong per­formance was a result of superb individual performane­es, as all five Olivet golfers fin­ished with seores of 85 or lower. Junior Megan Rimnwl's 78 was the lowost seorn of the day. 
Saint Mary's returns to the course on Sept. 20 at the Zollner Golf Course, the home coursn of Trinn University.

Collier showing progress 
Associated Press 

.JACKSONVILLE, Fla. ­Jaguars offensive tackle Hichard Collier is making grad­ual improvement from gunshot wounds but is "not out of the woods yet," his agent told a newspaper Thursday. 
Collier remained in eritieal but stable condition in the intonsive care unit at Shands .Jacksonville Medical Center, but agent Jeff Jankovich told the Florida Times-Union he was encouraged by what limited knowledge he has of Collier's condition. 
"(The family) seems pretty upbeat he's going to make it," Jankovich told the paper. "He's awake at times. lin's still in intensive care. but he's stable. Every time they've talked to the doctors. it seems like it's a little bit better. It's still pn~carious. There may be morn surgery needed, but it seems oncourag­ing at this point." 
Jankovich did not imnwdiatn­ly rnturn a phone call or an e­mail from The Associated Press. 
Collil~r. a 6-foot-7, 345-pound backup, was shot several times while sitting in his Cadillac Escalade early Tuesday morn­ing. Collier and former team­mate Kenneth Pettway were waiting outside an apartment complex for two women when the attack occurred. 


Police have no suspects in the case, and Collinr's family has n'questPd privac:y from the hos­pital and tlHl Jaguars regarding his mndical condition. 
.Jankovieh mnphasized the need for caution because Collior's progress has bnPn gradual, though tlw family rnmains hopeful that his rncov­ery will continue moving in a positive direction. The agent didn't give any specifies about where or how many times Collier was shot or what type of surgery he had.

an area he needs to continue to recruit to succeed." 
Another New Jersey product that committed in the middle of May is inside linebacker Carlo Calabrese. Coming out of Verona High School in Verona, N.J., Calabrese is a force to be reckoned with in terms of stop­ping the run. More than any­thing, Frank feels, Calabrese has the type of attitude that the Irish are looking for in high school recruits. 
"Carlo plays the game like it should be played," Frank said. "The play stops when Carlo hits you. He's a guy that's going to hit you every play he goes out there. He's fast and I think some will be surprised with how aggressive he is on the field." 
Over the summer, the Irish coaches hit the recruiting trail and picked up some big names along the way. The second week of July, however, proved to be one that solidified some of the key players of the class of 2009 thus far. In the span of seven days, Notre Dame picked up verbal commitments from cornerback Marlon Pollard, who originally committed to UCLA, tight end Tyler Eifert and offensive guard Chris Watt. 
Pollard originally wasn't scheduled to visit the Notre Dame campus, but after the Cajon High School product had an extra day in Chicago at the Offense-Defense Sports Select Football Camp, he decided to visit the Irish. That was all the coaching staff needed as spe­cial teams coach Brian Polian showed the four-star corner around campus and received his pledge to play for Notre Dame. Frank thinks Pollard could eventually be one of the biggest commits of the class. 
"It was a real big deal to land another corner this early on in the process," Frank said: "Pollard's a little undersized, but at 6-foot-1, he's got good height to play against other receivers. He has extremely quick feet, maybe quicker than anybody on the [Irish] roster right now. He could be a leader in the secondary with his tal­ent." 
Watt, out of Glenbard West High School in Illinois is a phys­ical presence and is exactly what Notre Dame needed, according to Frank. 
"Chris is exactly what the coaching staff was looking for," he said. "He's a player that's going to hit you during the play, and he might hit you after the whistle too. Not to say that he gives cheap shots, but he's extremely aggressive and loves the contact. 
"It was a big get because he's a Chicago kid and it was impor­tant to land him. With him on one side and Trevor Robinson on the other, the Notre Dame running game could be good for years to come." 
Lying in the road ahead for the Irish are a couple of blue­chip prospects that are being heavily recruited by most large programs across the nation. Outside linebackers Jelani Jenkins out of Wheaton, Md., and Manti Te'o out of Honolulu, Hawaii headline the names along the defense. 
"It's hard to tell with Jenkins because no one really talks to him," Frank said. "He came for a visit with his stepfather and mother, and his father likes Notre Dame too. I'd say Notre Dame will definitely be in his top five. If the Irish can win some games, they'll be in better shape." 
Te'o's situation is very simi­lar, Frank said. 
"Manti's case is almost the same situation," he said. "Weis has done an excellent job of staying in touch with him and recruiting him very hard. Notre Dame needs to bring him up for a visit to have a shot here. I've been hearing that they're working on bringing him for the [Pittsburgh] game, but I think the Irish have a better shot at Te'o than most people think." 
The other big name Irish fans are hearing a lot of is Xavier Nixon, a left tackle out of Jack Britt in Fayetteville, N.C. This is perhaps the most vital position left on the board for the Notre Dame, due to its recent strug­gles with the position. Like most recruits, Frank thinks the visit will tell the story. 
"Xavier will definitely come up at some point," he said. "If not during the s~ason, they'll look to bring him afterwards, but they need him on campus. His family likes the coaching staff and the education that Notre Dame brings. He's a highly recruited guy, so he's hearing from just about every program in the nation. He wants to know how the Irish will play and how he'll fit in. Having Corwin Brown recruit­ing him has been an advantage because Brown has struck up an excellent relationship with Nixon and his family." 
As the season kicks off Saturday against San Diego State, all eyes will be on the Irish and how they will respond to last year. None will be as important as the high school recruits on the fence about the Irish.

Senior forward Bright Dike led the Irish charge against Duke, scoring two goals for his first career multi-goal game. Junior midfielder Justin Morrow scored Notre Dame's first goal -a erucial one, Clark said. 
"Jt's very important to get the first goal," he said. "When Akron got the first goal. we had to open up to get back in the game and that gave them space to give us a tough time and score some goals -and it was the opposite against Duke. The first goal is always very important -if you don't get it, you've got to chase it carefully." 

The Irish hope to avoid that ehase by taking the advantage from the opening kick-off ­right after Nino Berticelli, the son of the tournament's name­sake and a 1999 Notre Dame graduate, makes a ceremonial opening kick-off. Berticelli was an assistant coach for the Irish in 2000, the year after his father's passing and before Clark took the helm.

fOOTBALL RECRUITING 

Wood, Stockton highlight impressive early 2009 commitments 
By LORENZO REYES 
Spons Writer 
I low Notre Dame was able to havn a 3-<J rneord last season and still retain arguably the top recruiting class in the nation has boggled the minds of many across the nation. If anything, it is a testament to the effort and skill that head coaeh Charlie Wnis and the rest of the Irish eoaehing staff has to bring in top taltmt. 
Although the 2008 season has yet to start, Notre Dame has already received verbal com­mitments from many of the top players in the nation -some of these coming in positions of key needs. 
The first notable player to jump on board was running back Cierre Wood from Santa Clara lligh School in Oxnard, Calif. Hanked as a five-star recruit at Scout.com, Wood brings an element of speed, explosiveness and playmaking ability from both the backfield and special teams. Wood com­mitted during the weekend of the spring Blue-Gold game and his interest in the Irish turned some heads due to last season's record and the heavy competi­tion at the running back posi­tion. 

Tyler Stockton, a defensive tackle out of The Hun School in Princeton, N.J., also verbally committed to Notre Dame dur­ing the spring game. Irisheyes.com's Mike Frank thinks very highly of Stockton and feels that Irish fans will recall a recent ~tandout along the defensive front when watching Stockton. 
"Tyler is a very big pickup for the coaching staff," Frank said. "He's short, compact and can penetrate and make some plays in the backfield. He's a huge piekup because defensive tack­le has been a position that· Notre Dame has struggled to recruit in the past. I think he'll remind a lot of people of Trevor

COMMENTARY 

Past is unspoken but not forgotten 
The frightening images of 3-9 are still fresh in the mind.

Southern Cal coming into the Stadium and laying another 38-0 beatdown on the Irish. Fans

ing of teeth Sports Writer 
and so on. 
So fright­nning, in fact, that coach Charlie Weis instructed his team to no longer speak of last sea­son. 
But try as Weis might, those images are hard to repmss for anybody. 
For many of his players, it was a rude awakening to the eollnge game. 
Unspoken now, but still mmmnbered. 
Thn problems were well-docu­mented -poor oll"ensive line coupled with anemic ollimsive production, a defense that '~ouldn't stop the run. 
Before the year, you eould nxpect Notre Dame wasn't going to match previous years suc­cess. but who knew they wen~ going to be 3-9 bad'? 
All the Irish can do now is learn from it. Don't speak about it, but don't forget it either. Quarterback Jimmy Clausen and the rest of the oll"ense shownd sihrns of progress toward the end of the year, but in the back of their minds, moti­vating them this season, should be the memories of those early­season mishaps. Fear of failure can bn the best motivational tool. 
That fear of failure also resides deep within Notre Dame fans. Some fans on the surface are optimistic about the coming year, and will give you their rosy prediction. After all, look at that schedule, look at that tal­ent, everyone's a year older, and God can't hate Notre Dame that much. Still, they know another 3-9 is still possible. 
Others are mom pessimistic, and project a defeatist attitude about the coming year as a defense mechanism because the thought of another 3-9 is too much for them to think about. 
But next to that fear of failure resides the pride of being a Notre Dame fan, the intimate connection each fan feels toward this University. It's a 
connection that's forged with 
family, with tradition, and a 
connection forged in part by 
unprecedented success on the 
field. 
Unspoken now, but still 
expected. 
It doesn't matter if Notre 
Dame was 3-9 last year. It does­
n't matter that this team is 
young and may still need a year 
or two to get back to national 
prominence. That's not the atti­
tude fans are accustomed to. 
Notre Dame football is not allowed to go 3-9, it just isn't supposed to happen. In the eyes of every Notre Dame fan, this year must be dilTerent. This year must be a success or else something needs to change. That's why Tyrone Willingham got fired. A middling Notre Dame team just won't do. Not with the fans, and not with the administration, and not with NBC, who just re-negotiated its eontraet with Notre Dame. One year of 3-9 didn't concern the NBC suits, but a few more, and those ad revenues will start to shrink, and the suits at NBC and Notre Dame will start to sweat a little bit. 
Notre Dame is one of the few places where the term low expectations doesn't exist, and it shouldn't. And nobody knows that better than Weis, the for­mer student who once met with then-University president Fr. llesburgh to complain about the football team. I wonder what Weis, the student, would've thought of 3-9. 
And nobody knows better than Weis that last year can't happen again. Yes, there are personnel holes on the team that Weis inherited and has done a great job recruiting to fill those holes, but at some point, those recruits have to produce. 
Weis called his book "No Excuses," and rightfully so. It's the attitude you need at Notre Dame. There are no excuses for 3-9. And there will be no excus­es should it happen again. 
He was a student here, he knows what it's like to sit in the stands when the team stinks and he knows the anger fans and alumni feel when the team stinks. And he knows what those fans will be thinking if there's a repeat of 3-9. 
Unspoken now, but still very much understood.

The firentan's son 
Eric Olsen gained perspective on life from his dad's hardships on Sept. 11 
By JAY FITZPATRICK 
Sports Writer 
This offseason, Notre Dame guard Eric Olsen's body changed. Not only did it get bigger (along with the rest of the offensive line), it got more colorful. 
The change was the addition of a tattoo covering his entire right upper arm. 
The tattoo took months to finish, with Olsen beginning it in Dnenmber after the season ended and not finishing it until this summer. 
Tlw tattoo has some more common aspects, including an American flag and a family crest. but the back of his arm has a more personal design: angels crying on the shoulders of a fin~lighter. 
"It's a real famous image in New York from September 11. My father was a firefighter, so it fits in with the theme lof the tattoo! 'Only the strong will survive,'" Olsen said.

pened," Olsen said. 
When the attacks initially happened, Olsen was in eighth grade and, like many other students that day, was unaware that the attacks had occurred. After he found out about the attacks, Olsen said he felt "a lot of anger that someone could do something like that." 
"I felt a lot of anger toward the terrorists, a lot of pride in New York. Knowing the pain that my dad had to go through -it just hits home on a real· personal level," he said. 
Olsen also said that he felt helpless and frustrated because, at only 14-years-old, he said he felt there was not much he could do to help his dad. 
Olsen said one of the worst parts of the day was his father's direct involvement in the rescue efforts. Olsen said some of his father's best friends had died in the effort.

Olsen was at horne when the planes first hit the build­ings, on a two-week vacation after being promoted. But after the attacks, he and other off-duty personnel were called to Manhattan to assist with the emergency relief. 
Olsen said his father was stuck in trartic on his way into Manhattan and forgot that he had his officer plates with him. lie put them on his wind­shield, and a police officer escorted him to Ground Zero. Olsen said his father arrived shortly after the towers fell. 
"If he had noticed that he had \the plates] sooner ... who knows what could have hap-and the people 
that we're close with, it was a really hard time for us." 
Olsen said every anniver­sary of the attack -which is coming up on Thursday ­brings back his memories and emotions from that day. 
"It hits you when you are sitting in class and on the top corner of the page you write 'September 11,"' he said. 
Olsen said that helping with the attacks was just one ordeal his father has had to go through. Andy Olsen has had 12 surgeries, including two for his anterior cruciate ligaments (ACL) and quadru­ple bypass surgery three

ior. Olsen said he still weighed over 300 pounds when he played lacrosse, but it was "a little different 300" and that he was leaner and had more muscle than in the past. 
"It was easy [playing attack]. The little guys could­n't stop me," he said. 
Olsen said he tries to keep up with playing lacrosse, and has been trying to play with tight end Will Yeatman -who also plays lacrosse for Notre Dame -but has not done that yet. 
Even though Olsen described playing lacrosse was one of the happiest times in his life, he said he never 
had any interest in playing any­thing other than football in col­lege. 
Olsen fell into tight end coach Bernie Parmalee's recruiting area, but offensive line coach John

Olsen said the recent suc­cess of the program is excit­ing and that he is impressed by some of the projects his classmates have done. 
He also said managing his time as an industrial design major is tough because of the number and length of classes involved.

dio classes each semester and the studio class­es can be up to three hours long," he said. "It kind of fills up my schedule a lot because I'm just going from class-to­class and then straight to practice." 
This seas{m, Olsen is slated as the No. 1 right guard on 

tackle in high school. The coach said that is the easier transition to make than guard to tackle because tackles often play against faster oppo­nents and have no one cover­ing their outside. Latina said guards play "big guys like yourself in a phone book amount of space," making it an easier adjustment. 
Latina said Olsen has done well since transitioning per­manently to guard after his freshman season. 
Olsen played sparingly as a freshman, but saw increased playing time last season, including his first Irish start against Boston College. That added experience has given him more confidence to per­form well, Latina said. 
"He's just older, smarter, wiser, more confident," he said. " ... Now he gets to reflect back and pull from past experience." 
Notre Dame head coach Charlie Weis agreed, saying the game has slowed down for Olsen since last season. 
"When you first start going out there and you're lining up there the first time on the offensive line as a young guy, okay, it's like, whoa, every­thing is happening real fast," Weis said. "Everything's hap­pening real fast and those guys you're playing against are pretty good. Now it's a year later and he thinks he's one of those good guys now. Where last year he was trying to get his feet wet." 
Even defensive coordinator Corwin Brown said Olsen has improved to the point that he has been a big help in improv­ing the defensive line play this season. 
"Olsen is a tough guy. Everybody else has to be tougher because they are watching him play," Brown said. "I gotta choose my words right. You gotta do your business or get off the pot." 
But despite this confidence and improvement. Olsen said the only thing that matters is a win. 
"That's the only thing we can do," Olsen said. "We can talk the talk all we want, we can talk all off-season and have confidence and be excit­ed about the season. But all that matters is Saturday."

Kamara and Floyd add some much needed height for the the Irish receivers. The team will miss tight end John Carlson's good hands over the middle, but as long as Clausen can stay on his feet the pa<;sing game should be much­improved from his rookie season. 
With a pair of six-foot­ers at corner back the Aztecs will match up well against the Irish receivers. They didn't see too much of a test last weHk but were able to shut down most of the Cal Poly passing attack.

COACHING 
Charlie Weis handed over play calling responsibilities to his coordinators so he could focus more on what is going on in the field. The once-wor­shiped coach must be feeling the pressure to win quick after last year's 3-9 record.

FINAL SCORE: Notre Dame 27 
QUARTERBACKS 
Jimmy Clausen has an extra year under his belt and a healthy throwing arm for the first time in his career. A stronger 0-line should keep him off of his back for a little longer, but it is still far from Brady Quinn under center. 
Hedshirt freshman Ryan Lindley settled down for some impres­sive stats after a rocky start to his career last week. Standing in front of 80,000 screaming fans in Notre Dame Stadium is a big jump up for act two. 
IRISH RUSHING 

A combination of speed and power in the backfield looks promis­ing for Notre Dame's new "pound it" mentali­ty. However, it's all up to the big boys in the trenches who have yet to prove themselves as a force to be reckoned with. 
Despite returning eight starters, the Aztocs gave up 263 yards on the ground against Div. 1-AA Cal Poly last week. They struggled to stop the option and will most likely struggle to slow down the speedy, youthful Notre Dame backfield. 



Everything that Notre Dame was at this time last year, it is no longer for this sea­son's opener. Weis has a clear strategy going into the first game and all the players who debuted last year are

AZTECS RUSHING AZTECS PASSING 
Fifth-year linebacker Mo Crum anchors a group of linebackers that could only improve. Smith and Ne'al add some much-needed ath­leticism and a bigger, stronger defensive line should be able to clog up some holes against San Diego State.  
SDSU running back Brandon Sullivan picked up only 43 yards on 15 carries. The offensive line is smaller than average and will have trouble push­ing around an Irish defense that spent the summer in the dining halls and weight rooms.  

The loss of Darrin Walls at corner hurts the already inexperienced defensive backfield. McCarthy and Parris should be strong over the middle but the front seven will have to pro­vide a consistent pass rush for the Irish to keep the ball on the ground. 
Long, who knows a thing or two about quarterbacks, is excited about his passing attack which gained 352 yards through the air and threw for three touchdowns last week. The learning curve is still pretty sharp for a young, talented group. 
SPECIAL TEAMS 
Brandon Walker went 6­for-12 kicking field goals last season, only one of those was 30 yards are more. The Irish lost fire­cracker returner Tom Zbikowski but still have some speed in their return game with Armando Allen and Golden Tate returning kicks. 
Punter Brian Stahovich averaged 39.5 yards per kick last week including two pinned inside the 20. The placekickers were perfect on extra points but did not attempt any field goals. The Aztecs also averaged 25 yards per return in the punt 
game. 

INTANGIBLES 
In case you have been living under a rock for a year, this game is a must win for Weis and the Irish. Notre Dame was embarrassed on their own turf week after week last season. Expect them to be fired up and looking to make a statement. 
The Aztecs play in front of less than 30,000 fans on a regu­lar basis. If 80,000 peo­ple and a national tele­vision spotlight don't get these guys crawling with goosebumps, it's time to check for a 
pulse.
