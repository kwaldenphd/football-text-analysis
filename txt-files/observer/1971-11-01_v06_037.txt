Fulbright announces opposition to $400-million foreig:p. aid bill 
Washington, Oct. 31--Sen J.W. Fulbright, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, prdicted today that Congress would approve an interim solution to keep foreign aid alive, but he indicated opposition to the formula being devised by the Nixon administration. 
The Arkansas democrat, one of the leaders in the Senate's defeat of the administration's Foreign Aid Bill Friday night, pledged'his personal backing for what he called "the least controversial" aspects of foreign aid, such as refugee relief and military aid to Israel. 
But, affirming his well-known opposition to other American military assistance programs, Fulbright said he thought administration efforts to retain miliary aid to Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos -as well as to Greece --would again be defeated by the Senate, or at least produce a lengthy fight. 
Administration sources said today that they hoped to push through a continuing resolution to extend economic and military programs for 90 days when the present continuing resolution expires on Nov. 15. 
This would continue aid at the rate of last years expenditures --$2.64 billion a year. 
In addition, officials plan to ask for a sup­plemental appropriation of some $400 million --$250 million for Pakistani refugee relief and $150 million for Vietnam economic programs. 
Scott, Javits support bill 
Approval of this package would carry the aid program into 1972 by which time the administration would have a new coordinated program to offer the Congress, aides said. 
Sen. llugh Scott of Pennsylvania, the Senate Republican leader, and Sen. Jacob K. Javits, R­N.Y., have already indicated their desire to carry the administration's fight for a continuation bill. 
But Fulbright, reflecting the views of the liberals who opposed the Aid Bill, largely because of anger over the administration's support for the Anti-Communist regimes in Cambodia, Laos and South Vietnam, indicated he would not support such and administration package. 
Fulbright said that when his Foreign Relations Committee meets tomorrow morning the members 

will discuss the situation and see what can be done. 
"I would say --without having talked to them at all -· that some kind of interim program will probably be devised. There are various ways of approaching it.We do not like ·-I do not like --the continuing resolution approach," he said. 
"I am thinking generally along the lines of an interim program which would take care of those parts of the program which are the least con­troversial. There are such things. The Children's Program is universally applauded, the Palestinian refugees, the Pakistan refugees. No one is opposed to them. A number of things of this character can be put together," he said. 
present military aid opposed 
Fulbright said "The really controversial things are the use of this program for part of the military domination of other countries." 
Critics of the Administration's Bill cite the fact that some 55 per cent of the $3 billion request was for military aid. 
Asked if he would support a filibuster on the Senate floor if the administration introduced its continuing resolution, Fulbright said that this depended on whether the administration sought to keep things as they are now with military aid in­cluded. If it did, then he predicted "great op­position." 
Israel, he noted, was "a special case," and should be supported. 
In general, Fulbright expounded his own critical thinking about the way American Foreign Policy has developed in the postwar years, particularly his view that the defeat of the Foreign Aid Bill was something of a turning point in the country. 
He said the vote was "the beginning of a new era­a change in our basic foreign policy." 
Foreign aid, he said, started out as a worthy endeavor, but "turned into a tool of the cold war." He said it was a form of "welfare imperialism" by which the United States exerted influence on many counries. 
"I think this is the beginning of a re-evaluation of of our foreign policy. This is one aspect of it, an important aspect of it. I think we have followed the idea that we could dominate other countries and make them be subservient to our will," hesaid. 


Fulbright: not isolationism 
Fulbright rejected suggestions that the vote was 
indicative of the rise of nco-isolationism in the 
country --a withdrawing from foreign com­
mitments. 
"The idea of nco-isolationism is absolutely a 
misuse of language," he said. 
Citing his support for the passage in the Senate 
recently of a $2 billion appropriation for in­
ternational organizations--as as distinct from 
bilateral aid which he largely opposes, he said: 
"The true internationalist is the one who wants to 
internationalize these things, who supports things 
like the United Nations or the International Bank." 
Bilateral aid, Fulbright said, was "a vehicle for 
imperialism, not internationalism." 
He said that the Aid Bill's Military Sections were 
used "for the influencing and perpetuation of 
existing regimes." 
"This has been part of the policy of preservation 
of the status quo, the prevention of any change in so 
many countres that need change. And this has -­
this has generally, I think, eroded the basis of the 
whole program," he said. 
Like Sen. George Aiken, R-Vt., Fulbri'ght at­
tributed the Foreign Aid Bill's defeat partly to 
"over-lobbying" by the administration in an effort 
to defeat amendments limiting aid to Cambodia. 
In another development, George Bush, the United 
States Ambassador to the United Nations, ap­
pearing on the American Broadcasting Company 
Proj!ram, "Face The Nation," said he admitted 
there has been much discontent with the Foreign 
Aid Program, "But I think in the final analysis 
when calm and consideration take over, that there 
will be a program because people recognize there 
are some fundamental things being done there that 
affect the self-interest of everybody in our coun­
try." 
Barlow: letter a 'repressive fiat' 

Barlow, Under~nan protest Hesburgh letter 
by Ann McCarry 
A letter released by University President Rev. Theodore Hesburgh last Thursday has induced strong responses from two top St. Mary's Student Go­vernment officials, the Observer learned last night. 
St. Mary's Student Body President Kathy Barlow and Student Body Vice­President Missy Underman both ex­pressed unequivical disapproval of the letter, which said that the Board of Trustees had decided to determine Notre Dame parietal hours themselves. 
Miss Barlow called the ruling a "fiat" in a full-page statement she released to the Observer. 
"First of all," Miss Barlow said, "Father Hesburgh's letter makes a comparison of the academic situation with student life. That seems to me to be a poor analogy. The question I would ask is 'are we here to be tested and graded on our 
lifestyles.' 

"Also, he is talking about moving towards a better Notre Dame. It appears to me that his top priority is the institution and r.ot the people who are here. 
"In the letter. Fr. Hesburgh says, 'student life is a responsibility that the Trustees can never surrender.' It appears to me that what they're saying is that they will not 'allow' individuals here to determine their own lifestyles. 
"I would be extremely disappointed if the students here accept this repressive fiat because the Trustees are not merely addressing themselves to the issue of parietal hours, but more importantly to the issue of self-determination." 
Miss Barlow continued. "If the goal of this school is to develop mature in­dividuals then the school must realize that they only become so having to make responsible decisions for themselves.'' 
Miss Underman voiced a similar opinion in reaction to the letter and the Board of Trustees' decision. 
"I read the letter with much interest. Naturally I was disappointed by the whole parietal issue not passing because I felt the Student Life Council had devoted enough time to the issue and that a lot of thought had gone into the proposals. 
"I was bothered," continued Missy, "by the tone of the letter, especially by the assumption of Father Hesburgh and the Board that leaving the determination of parietals up to each hall would ultimately result in open dormitories. 
"I don't agree with Father Hesburgh's theory that the proposal would mean open dorms. Each hall knows its own limitations best and can determine its own hours best. The students are mature enQugh to decide if they need limitations.'' 
Jean Seymour, Student Affairs Com­missioner, had this to say: "I think Father Hesburgh and the Board of Trustees are very sincere in what they say and I think they truly respect our student representatives to the Board, namely, John Barkett, Orlando Rodriguez, and Bob Weaver, as evidenced by their acceptance of the other recommendations of the SLC. 
"However," she went on, "it still goes back to the same argument of where the power lies. And, in this case, since they feel ultimate responsibility in regards to parietals, they don't feel that they can accept the responsibility of relinquishing this power to students."

Communist Chinese flag to he raised at UN 
(C) 1971 New York Times 
United Nations, N.Y., Oct. 31 -­
Communist China today cleared 
the way for the raising of its flag 
Monday at the United Nations. 
Peking sent a cablegram to Secretary General Thant ad­vising him that it wants to be listed as "China, People's Republic Of." Thus, the red flag with five gold stars will be hoisted by U.N. guards shortly after 9 a.m. together with all the other 131 flags of the member countries. There will be no special ceremony. 
The Chinese Communist flag, like the Nationalist flag before Taiwan's expulsion, will fly bet­ween those of Chile and Colombia. The flags are arranged in English alphabetical order in the United Nations Plaza. 
Diplomats with close ties to the mainland government said today they expected its delegates to arrive Thursday or Friday. But today's communication from Foreign Minister Chi Peng­Fei to Thant gave no arrival date 

and no indication on the com­position of the delegation. 
Chiao Kuan-Hua, one of about six vice foreign ministers and a close confidant of Premier Chou En-Lai, is thought by irformed diplomats here to be the most lfkely head of the delegation. 
The diplomats, who specialize in Chinese affairs, said that Chiao has long been responsible for European affairs in the ministry and is regarded as perhaps the highest-ranking

Despite what Publicity Chairman Jerry Nagle termed a "disappointing turnout of new people" at yesterday's meeting of the consumer research group, lnPRIG, organization leaders are "confident" of the six-week old group's future. 
The meeting, designed to in­troduce new InPRIG members to the organization and to demonstrate techniques suc­cessful at Indiana University at South Bend, drew less than twenty people, none of them new members, according to Nagle. 
Campus INPRIG director Bill Rahner said that originally the meeting was supposed to be a conference between statewide coordinator Dave Hersch and local InPRIG representatives. On Wednesday, however, ND lnPRIG decided to throw the meeting open to the public and official in foreign affairs, after Chi. 
Communist diplomats with close ties with Peking were un­derstood today to have sought further assurances from Thant that all the specialized agencies related to the U.N. would follow the General Assembly's lead in admitting Peking and expelling the Nationalists. 
But informed sources said that there was no suggestion that Peking might delay the dispatch of its delegation until all the agencies had acted. Unesco, the 
U.N. 
Educational Social and Cultural Organization, acted on the assembly's recommendation Friday. 

U.N. 
officials close to Thant today said that the Secretary General !;lad dpne all he could do, namely to inform the heads of all the agencies of the assembly's decision. The officials said that they expected all the agencies to act swiftly in the same sense as Unesco, exce~t for World Bank

MANASA goal to meet and help people 

by Andy Winiarczyk Jr. Observer Insight "To proviae an opportunity for -meeting people and for helping people." -Goal of MANASA 
The Mental Health Association 

at Notre Dame is called 
MANASA. It supplies volunteers 
for the Hot line (not the one you 
get girls on -that's been 
discontinued), the Halfway 
House, Beatty Hospital, the 
Psychiatric Ward of St. Joseph's 
Hospital, the Psychiatric Ward of 
St. Joseph's Hospital, and Nor­
thern Indiana Children's 
Hospital. 
By far the organization in which most students are involved is Northern Indiana Children's Hospital. Located near the Notre Dame campus, this hospital is an inpatient hospital for retarded children. Student volunteers may choose to be involved in any number of programs. There is an activities program where volunteers generally play with children. There are feeding programs where volunteers assist feeding the children at one of the meal times. There are also programs which do not directly involve contact with the patients. 
Notre Dame students have 

been working at the hospital 
since 1961. That was the year 
when it became an institution for 
the retarded. At that time there 
were 120 volunteers who went to 
play with the children. There 
are presently 84 ND-SMC men 
and women in the program now. 
Now there is a greater variety of 
tasks to· be performed. Each 
student has a definite schedule to 
adhere to. 
Gerald Mast, Director of 

Volunteer Services, has said of 
those under his charge, "They 
want to be involved and there are 
willing to do most anything." 
Dr. Thomas Whitman, an assistant professor of Psychology at the University of Notre Dame, presents an opportunity to work down at Northern Indiana to his class of psychology majors. Each of them works on a one-to-one basis with one of the children. Re feels that the experience will help them when they make psychology their career. 
Tom Ferry, a volunteer, said, "By being in the program we learn more about ourselves." 
Paul Condon, another volun­

teer, added, "I'm in it because I Trustees to provide funds for an enlarged student-run drug center.

Irish Frosh drub MSU38-14 

by Mike Pavlin 

While MSU scatback Eric Allen was enjoying an NCAA record performance in Lafayette, the Spartan frosh were having much less fun back home in East Lansing. 
Led by the pitch-catch team of Tom Clements to Pete Demerle, the Mutt and Jeff running combo of Eric Penick and Chuck Kelly, and a ball-hungry defense, the Notre Dame freshmen crushed MSU 38-14 last Saturday on the latter's Tartan Turf. 
Rolling up 566 yards in 98 plays (the varsity record is 104)), the ND frosh throttled the Spartans on land and in the air, leaving the spectators wisliing they'd spent the morning watching the soccer match across the street. 
Perhaps even Eric Allen himself wouldn't have mattered as the fierce Irish defense held the Spartans to 180 yards total offense and two pass completions while recovering seven fumbles plus a pass interception. In fact, the only Spartan scores came after fumble recoveries deep in Irish territory. 
The Irish offense shook off some ball-handling jitters of its own and broke the contest open with two touchdowns by Penick in a three-minute span of the fourth quarter. 
The Clements-to-Demerle combination clicked for seven receptions, 176 yards and a touchdown while Penick and Kelly combined for 174 yards on the ground. Clements,whose physical measurements (6-0, 175 lbsl resemble Joe Theismann's, led the Irish offense on sustained drives of 74; 70, and 77 yards in the first half. He completed 9-21 passes on the day for an ex-

varder to Demerle for a TD. ('lements also scrambled like a Theismann, with 62 yards in 14 carries. Demerle, a 6-1, 187 lb split end from New Canaan, Conn., averaged 25 yards per reception having the kind of day Irish fans associate with a Seymour or a Gatewooq. 
On the ground the Irish were equally impressive. There is another Di Narcfo on campus, offensive tackle Gerry, who goes 6-1, 230 lbs. He and his mates on the offensive line moved the Spartans about with relative ease, allowing Irish runners to pile up 338 yards on 74 carries. 
Someone had better check what kind of padding Penick is wearing because he looks a whole lot bigger than 6-1, 195lbs. He is tough to bring down, agile, and-­above all--fast. He showed his best form early in the fourth quarter, scoring on runs of 11 and 15 yards while seeming to drift by defenders without effort. He also appears able to take punishment, shaking off a leg injury just before his final TD run. 
Penick totalled 89 yards on 20 carries, but the diminuative Kelly was equally impressive. Standing only 5-9, Chuck bobbed and weaved for 85 yards on 17 carries. He showed great skill at hiding behind his larger blockers, darting in and out the way Mike Garrett used to do at Kansas City. For good measure, Kelly grabbed a Clements' pass good for 28 yards. Fullback Wayne Bullock added 51 yards on 11 earries. 
The Irish opened the scoring with a 12-play, 72-yard drive capped by a four-yard plunge by Hon Goodman at the 10:40 mark of the first quarter. AI Stripe then added the first of his five extra points. Then an Irish fumble gave the Spartans field position at the ND five. The Irish defense stif­fened and it was not until fourth down that Arnold Morgado plowed over from the one. 
Penick put the Irish back in front With a one-yard plunge. The T .D.came at the 7:20 mark of the second quarter after a 12-play, 70­ya·d drive. But another Irish fumble proved costly. Given possession at the ND 32, Spartan qb Steve Moerdyk wasted no time in lofting a T.D. pass to Mike Jones. Clements and Demerle eame right back to give the Irish a 21-14 halftime advantage. At 
2: 17, Clements hit his split end with a 40-yarder. 
Stripe opened the second-half scoringwith a 27-yard field goal; then Penick added his two scoring jaunts. The ND Defense completely shut off the Spartans 

The sound all the record and stereo equipment companies say you should get. 
We felt Santana's "Samba Pate'' crying for it. Then we found the depth Emerson, Lake and Palmer's "Lonely Man" was searching for. It happened when we heard LWE speakers. 
Somebody had been talking about LWE speaker systems and how different they are. They're different because LWE uses a feedback system that makes your set-up deliver all the sound, especially the critical highs and lows. Clean. 
The LWE Clip-Kit hooks your amplifier to the speakers. And then you've got a whole system that won't let anything through but pure sounds. High trebles and low bass tones came out like they were played in the studio-sharp and clear. And that's all we want. 



through penalties and fumbles. I~ the air, MSU was a mere 2-16. 
Varsity coach Duffy Daugherty need not despair, however. Morgado, another of Duffy's Hawaiian recruits, carried 21 times for 80 yards. Spartan punter Jim l.rannell averaged a superb 46 yards on six punts. And Jones even tried his hand at qb, showing some dazzling moves while scrambling for his life from the ND front four, picking up 17 yards on four carries. 
But the day belonged to the Irish who played ball control offense at its finest. Having proved they can handle big Americans as well as small Mexicans, the Irish take on the Michigan Wolverines this Saturday morning at home. MSU topped the Wolverines 20-18 in a rainstorm earlier this season.

::::::::=:===========================================================:::Gordie Howe, V.P. 
New York, Oct. 31--Since Rocket Richard scored 50 goals in a season during World War II, people have been saying the National Hockey League is embarking on "a new era". The various eras can be marked by Boom Boom Geoffrion's slap shot, expansion, the two-goalie system, and the recognition that hockey players are subject to, of all things, emotional stress. 
During most of those significant milestones, there was one constant: Gordie Howe. Now the league is in another era-the one without the great Detroit Red Wing. Two events will happen today in New York to 
symbolize the new change. First, an upstart group called the World Hockey Association will announce its plans to challenge the N .H.L. next season. Then, at night, Howe will be deservedly honored by the Metropolitan New York Hockey Writers Association for long and distinguished service to the game. 
If the W.H.A. lasts as long as Howe did, it will have accomplished something. But the persistence of Howe's memory continues, and today it still overshadows the W.H.A. On a recent morning, Howe was in his office at 8:30 o'clock, and squeezed in some time to talk about his life of leisure following 25 seasons as a big-leaguer. 
They've made me a vice president of the Wings," said Howe. "I guess you need a title to draw a salary." 
Howe knew it would be over last season. "It wasn't so much that I was 43 and my arm hurt from arthritis and my legs were going," he explained. "I used to be testy the day of a game. But I could feel that I wasn't concentrating. I wasn't feeling as nasty." 
Now Howe is a fan, "a quiet fan," sometimes Howe wants to shout at the crowd: "Don't you know these guys are trying? How do you think you'd feel if fans were screaming at you?" but he doesn't 
"I suppose it's part of the game, but I can't get used to it," he ad­mitted. "I remember if I were on the ice and it was a dead house, it'd be reflected in your play. Hockey players can hear everything. The fans are so close to the action. I've been in games where the fans would take a whack at you. They'd hold your stick as you were coming off and swing." 
If there is a major change in retirement, it is his appreciation for what the players are doing. He tries to remember that these are people on the ice, even though some are slashing, some are butt-ending, some are punching. 
"If I tell a fan some guy's got a family, and they don't like the guy, they reply, 'He's married? He can't be.' They refuse to see that a guy can be a family man and still be dirty on the ice." 
When Howe realized it was all over for him, he spoke to the Wings' president, Bruce Norris. "Don't give me one title or position," he told Norris. "Let me touch the bases on all phases of the game." 
Howe now is a sort of superstar-as-troubleshooter. "I'm almost like Joe Fan," he said. "I get on the ice a lot and get rid of baby fat. I'll skate with some of the new poeple we've got--and we've got a lot of them. I'll watch our new minor league team in Tidewater, I'll do a little bit of scouting." 
Howe was hockey's unofficial greeter. His stick or his elbow would 
welcome upstarts to the big time. But he appreciates the new breed. "I 
think the kids are different today. They're more educated, more 
diversified. When I came up many of us didn't prepare for the future." 
And in the old days, teams faced each other 14 times a season 
<compared to six today>. There was more animosity among players. 
Howe used to avoid associating with Richard. 
Besides never reaching Richard's 50-goal total, the only other 
dream Howe never realized was skating with his sons in a big-league 
game. But he did appear with them once in a benefit game, and has the 
tape and loves to play it. 
"It seems like only yesterday that I started," he recalled. "I 
remember once playing golf with Gerry Pinder's father, and his dad 
said, 'Hey, I just had a boy.' Then I wound up playing against his son. 
I was around a long timP." 
The game's outcome was decided in the first 30 minutes, whPn Minnix ran for two touch­downs and Gulyas one, while the Irish defense limited the Middies to only three yards rushing, 24 yards passing and just two first downs. 
The Irish wasted no time in establishing their offensive and defensive superiority over the Middies. After stopping Navy on the opening series of downs, Notre Dame marched 78 yards in 15 plays for their first touchdown. 
The Irish went all the way on the ground, Gulyas cutting over right tackle from the one for the score. Parker carried five times for 27 yards and Andy Huff, three times for 22 yards, in the drive. 
Bob Thomas kicked the extra point to give Notre Dmae a 7..0 lead with 6:49 left to play in the first quarter. 
Notre Dame missed a scoring opportunity the second time they had possession when a fumble stopped them at the Navy 31 but the Irish put together another sustained drive midway through the second quarter to pick up their second touchdown. 
Staying exclusively on the ground, Notre Dame covered 64 yards in 11 plays. Cliff Brown, who ran for a pair of first downs, and Gulyas, who picked up 18 yards on an end sweep, turned in the big plays to get the Irish into scoring position and Minnix picked up his first six-pointer of the afternoon when he plunged over the goal line from a yard out. Thomas again converted to make it 14..0 with 6:14left in the half. 
lt didn't take long for the Irish to score again. Navy's George Berry returned the ensuing kickoff to the Middie 28 where he was hit hard and fumbled. Ralph Stcpaniak recovered for Notre Dame at the Navy 36. 
It took the Irish just seven running plays to score. Minnix recorded his second touchdown by darting into the end zone on a ten yard burst, breaking a couple of tackles enroute. 
Parker set up Minnix's score, carrying four times for 20 yards in the drive. 
Thomas' placement was perfect and the Irish led 21-o with 


2:35 re~aining. The second half was not so exciting. The Irish defense continued to keep Navy in check, although the Middies did threaten to score late in the game, but the NO offense was unable to put a.ny more points on the board against a stubborn Navy defense. The third quarter passed quickly as neither team did much offensively. Early in the final quarter, the Irish drove to the Middie 17, thanks largely to a 25 yard, Brown to Tom Gatewood 
pass, before losing the ball on a fumble. 
The Irish came close to scoring the next time they had possession, too, but this time a penalty crushed their touchdown hopes. 

After taking over at the Irish 29, Brown flipped a first down screen pass to John Cieszkowski and the big fullback rambled all the way to the Navy four, a 67 yard gain, before being tackled. The play was called back, however, because Notre Dame had an ineligible receiver downfield. 
Navy launched their only scoring threat shortly thereafter. The Middies got their hands on the ball at their own 39 with 7:50 remaining in the game and quickly moved down the field. 
Fullback Andy Pease got the drive started by picking up 21 yards on a draw on a second down and 18 play. Pease carried again for 12 yards to the Irish 36 on the next play and and Middie quarterback Fred Stuvek followed with a 16 yard pass to his ace wide receiver, Larry Van Loan. 
Then the Irish defense, which has not been sdored on in the second half all season, stiffened. Pease was able to gain just two yards, to the Notre Dame 18, on first down. Stuvek threw in­complete on second down but tossed a pass to Pease, good for four yards, on the next play. 
Faced with a fourth-and-five situation, Stuvek tried to hit Van Loan but the pass was incomplete and the Irish preserved their shutout. 
After the game, Irish coach Ara Parseghian remarked, "I thought we played a very good first half and a very ordinary second half. 
"We were sharp in the first half, had excellent blocking, and moved the ball very well," he continued. "We made mistakes in the second half that kept us from scoring. I was not satisfied with our offensive performance in the second half. 
"Our defense also had a very good first half," Ara added, "but they were a bit ragged in the second half." 
The Irish will take their 6-1 record to Pittsburgh nest weekend to battle the Panthers, 31-21 victors over Syracuse Saturday, while Navy travels to Atlanta to play Georgia Tech.

Some of those who have been called are: Noam Chomsky, a linguist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and ·a leading New Left spokesman; Richard A. Falk, Princeton professor and frequent war critic; Stavins, co-author of "Washington Plans an Aggressive War;" Samuel L. Popkin, a Vietnam expert at Harvard who is a war opponent; David Halberstam, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who is writing a history of American involvement in Vietnam; K. Dun Gifford, former legislative aide to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and a friend of Ellsberg; and Rod­berg, who transmitted Gravel's copy of the war study to the Beacon Press in Boston for republication. 
Most have expressed puzzlement at being summoned and have raised elaborate and often novel constitutional ob­jections. 
Employing some of the most skilled civil rights lawyers in the country, they have invoked First Amendment freedoms, Fourth Amendment protection against illegal search and Fifth Amen­ment bars against self­incrimination. 
The process has settled into a kind of routine. At the appointed hour' each witness takes the elevator to the 11th floor of the Main Post Office Building, which houses the federal courts. 
There he generally refuses to testify or to answer any questions of substance. 
Thereupon, he goes one flight up to the wood-paneled cqur­troom of United States District Court Judge W. Arthur Garriety Jr., the genial white-haired jurist who is supervising the grand jury. The witness's lawyers argue that the subpoena should be quashed, stayed or restricted.
