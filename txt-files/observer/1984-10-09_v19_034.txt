"Even if you disagree with our view that we won the debate, a draw was a win for us," said White House staff chief James Baker, sounding several degrees short oftriumphant.

Johnson said the Mondale cam­paign's polling immediately after the debate said the challenger was seen as the winner by 52 percent of people surveyed, while 32 percent picked Reagan. Baker also had a post-debate poll and said it had Reagan the winner by a margin of 41 to 38. He said the same sample said they would vote for Reagan in November by a margin of 54 to 36. The two sets of figures in the Reagan campaign poll could be seen as supporting the view of Mondale aides that immediately after a debate, people tend to think the can­didate they support was the winner. Under that theory, a lot of Reagan supporters were conceding Mondale finished on top Sunday night.

Becoming famous and killing cockroaches 
Most people inherently want or need some sort of recognition on a regular basis. The recognition that they want is, of course, the positiYe kind. Recognition, after all, gives a person a sense ofaccomplishment as it entails someone, or a lot ofsomeones, noticing them

or their work. And when a whole bunch of people notice someone, that person becomes famous. 
Fame is something a lot of people want. People see Michael Jackson on the cover of thousands ofmagazines, marvel at the millions of fanatic fans and wonder why he is so fa­mous. The fact that he is able to dance like a puppet and sing like a choirboy is often over­looked by the envious. 

A certain group of people, called athletes, often become famous. The recent Olympic games gave the nation a whole host of new personalities. And many of these athletes will admit that part of the reason they work so hard to excel at their sport is because of a desire to gain recognition. 
Although it is more common with individ­uals, in some cases entire teams reach the plateau offame. The 1969 Cubs' team is a per­fect example. The 1984 version of the same 
,' team could have joined this category, albeit in a different manner.' ,.. This need for fame has been analyzed by the most eminent psychiatrists and psychologists. Many theories have been developed to ex­plain it. One such theory explains the desire to be famous as an example of the human species' denial ofdeath. In this interesting ex­planation a person seeks immortality by trying to become a historical figure. It follows from this theory that anyone who makes the World Book Encyclopedia receives a degree of im­mortality. And I will freely admit that I have a secret desire to make it into the "B" book of that collection. Realistically, however, most of us will not become historically famous or famous for even a week. Nevertheless, there is hope that 

Give us something to relax to also 

Dear Editor: 
I would like to thank you for your inclusion of Pat Beaudine's insightful review of Lou Reed's "New Sensations" album. It was one of the most enjoyable articles I've seen so far in The Obseroer. While it certainly takes an ap­preciation of the album in question, really to appreciate Beaudine's careful analysis, I think that even non-listeners could get some enjoy­ment from this review. 
It is exactly this king offeature article that I think The Obseroer needs more of. Often, I find myself glancing through the whole paper without finding a single interesting article, and so I end up throwing the paper away reading the comics. I am not some uned­ucated cretin who is uninterested in world ar­ticles, but Ido find the articles on the progress of the presidential race (if, in fact, there really is any) a bit repetitive and boring. I am not proposing the The Observer become a type of tabloid like The National Enquirer, but I wish your staff would make an effort to print arti­cles on things students are really interested in. 
I realize that Notre Dame has a reputation for beiflll a hiRh&y-respectcd educational insti­we will receive some sort of widespread 
recognition. Indeed, a recent article in The New York Times reinforces this hope. 
In the article, a person who was working in relative obscurity burst into the news scene and received widespread recognition in a fas­cinating way. Dr. Stuart L. Schreiber, an associ­ate professor of chemistry at Yale University, received eight inches and a picture in The New York Times for synthesizing an aphrodisiac to lure cockroaches to their deaths. Schreiber did, though, have to share the picture with a cockroach. 
As described in the article, the substance Schreiber synthesized causes cockroaches to "stand on their back legs and start flapping their wings." And afterwards, the article con­tinues, it is easy to see that the cockroaches are suffering from sexual excess as many have "broken antennae, gnawed legs and tattered wings." 
This substance, named periplanone-B, is so powerful that several quadrillionths of a gram is enough to send seven or eight cockroaches into sexual frenzies leading ultimately to their deaths. Undoubtedly, this is not cruelty to in­sects. Although modest about his accomplish­ment, Schreiber does admit that his new sex attractant "could save lives" by preventing famines in some parts of the world where cockroaches infest and consume valuable amounts offoodstocks. 
Not everybody can create such a valuable product but Schreiber does provide a sterling example for the rest of us. As we finally leave school, whether it be in one, three or whatever number of years, the career world will provide ample opportunities for a bit of fame. 
Although out in the "real world" there will no longer be Dean's Honor lists or chances to write for the college newspaper to get one's name in print, Schreiber has shown that no matter how obscure or seemingly unimpor­tant a person's work, the possibility of being recognized on a widespread level and perhaps grabbing a piece ofimmortality is within one's grasp.

Notre Dame spirit shines against Miami 
Dear Editor: 
Although Saturday's game against Miami may be recorded in the scorebooks as a Notre Dame loss, it represents a victory far greater than that which the Hurricanes achieved. Across the nation Notre Dame and spirit are considered synonymous, and the cheers that rocked our stadium Saturday truly fulfilled that reputation. Despite a driving rain and a wind that chilled the bone, Notre Dame fans remained steadfast. And the cheers for the alumni ~and were just as loud and supportive as those after the first touchdown. 
As a freshman, I am especially warmed by the friendliness and spirit that Domers emit. The Miami players could not help but know that 'We are NO'-and we're proud ofit!

Jerry Falwell brings back McCarthyism 
I do believe my second-favorite journalist (second to Murray Kempton) Is Myra Mac­Pherson of The Washington Post. Her coverage of this election year has been as­tonishingly good. I remember especially her 
Garry Wills outrider 

articles on the Jesse Jackson candidacy. And in a new series she has found just the right tone ofcoverage for the pious lubricity ofJerry Fal­well. 
MacPherson does her homework. She is able to show the continuity ofstrategy behind Falwell's changing views. Back in the 1950's, Falwell defended segregation by claiming in­tegration was just a plot hatched in Moscow. In the 1980's, he opposes the Democratic Party because it is just the stalking horse for homosexuals. He opposes a plan not for its in­ternal flaws, but for its unworthy sponsors. 
The simple and accurate word for this is McCarthyism. The McCarthyites saw commu­nist plots everywhere, even within President Eisenhower's executive staff. At the Demo­cratic National Convention this year, Falwell saw homosexual conspiracy everywhere. This is not simply a campaign to secure gay rights, but to bring about "a different America." To rape our children. 
"Militant homosexuals plan to force every major American corporation to set official policies giving them favored job status...to pass laws forcing churches and Christian schools to hire homosexuals and lesbians even if they flaunt their lifestyle ...and they do have their eyes on our children!" 
How does he know this? Because his son : · J.filtratf'.-1 the ranks of the enemy in San Fran­cisco. How did he do that? By walking down the street. In Falwell's words, "He went incog­nito into the streets." The description ofwhat happens on the streets of San Fransisco makes it seem that no one could remain incognito without traveling in drag. Why did Falwell subject his 17 -year-old son to this experience? Because the boy is a photographer, and Fal­well wants to send his followers, in sealed en­velopes, pictures of homosexuals seen in flagrante. These are enclosed in his missive "in a sealed envelope to protect children from such sights." What about his own child? The old sin-sniffer knows how to ginger up a ser­mon, all right. 
In the 1950's, the plotters were more dis­creet. Integrators did not kiss pictures of Stalin on the streets in the South. But only Stalin had a motive to eliminate segregation in America. According to Falwell: "The true Negro does not want integration. He realizes his potential is far better among his own race. Who then is propagating this terrible thing? First of all, we see the hand of Moscow in the background..." 
Falwell's doctrine of "the true Negro" is an interesting one. What is a false Negro? Some­one pretending to be black? Maybe a KGB agent in burnt cork. The absurdity of Ameri­can politics can only be grasped when we re­member that the president and the vice president of the United States honored, at the other convention, this lurid ecclesiastical clown. Vice President Bush even found a way to give Falwell credit for preventing a second Holocaust. The second Holocaust, I suppose, would murder millions ofheterosexuals ifFal­well's son had not exposed the Democratic plotters with his camera. 
Our taste in saviors ofthe republic certainly has declined. Even McCarthy's charges look sober by comparison with Falwell's.

sive tackle. He played for three years under Notre Dame head coach Gerry Faust when Faust was with the Moeller program. 
"I had visited most of the schools that were after me," explains the 6-6, 271-pmmd sophomore. "But I al­ways kept Notre Dame in the back of my mind. Then when I found out the Coach Faust was coming here, it made my decision that much easier. The school was just so impressive and its football tradition speaks for itself." 
Askin entered Notre Dame in the fall of'82 with hopes ofcontributing the most he could to the team. But a major setback occurred prior to the start of the fall season. After hard work and dedication all through the summer, Askin suffered a stress fracture ofthe lower leg . 
"It was the worst feeling ever," recalls Askin. "I had put in so much time during the summer getting conditioned and working out, only to get injured two months before the season." 
Askin didn't get down on himself and his career at that point, however. Through an extensive weight training rehabilitation, Askin began to recuperate from the fracture. He also used the time to learn more about the game and his position. 
Askin returned to competition for 

the  1983  season,  earning  a  
monogram  as  a  backup  offensive  
tackle.  He  played  mainly  at  the  

strong tackle postion. Askin ap­peared in every game except for the Penn State contest and saw lenghty duty stints against Purdue, Michigan State, Colorado and Army. 
Fortunately, because of the injury to Williams, the newest starter on the offensive line has continued to improve. 
Though his efforts were diminished due to an Irish loss on Saturday, Askin turned in a fine per­formance against a tough Miami team. He and his teammates on the offensive line will have to look for­ward to re-establishing the running game this week. The Irish could look to Askin for an example of coming back against adversity.

Irish fall short in Indiana match 
By ERIC SCHEUERMANN 
Sports Writer 
After three straight convincing wins last week, the Notre Dame volleyball team had high hopes for another victory Saturday night against the Hoosiers of the Indiana University. 
But Indiana, behind strong net play and the benefit ofan experi­enced setter, foiled those hopes by shooting down the Irish by scores of 15-5, I5-13, and I 5-5. 
With the loss, Notre Dame's record fell to 7-7 on the season, while the Hoosiers lifted their mark to 7-9. 
After being wiped out in the first game by the score of 15-5, the Irish appeared to be making a match ofit when they took a 12-8 lead in the second contest. But Indiana played well from that point on, and the Irish could not hold back the comeback, losing by the close score of 15-13. 
After taking the momentum away from the Irish, the Hoosiers had no problem cleaning up the match with an easy final game win, 15-5. 
Leading the Irish in this match were hitters Tracy Bennington and Kathy Baker. Bennington led the squad with seven kills. Baker, who had come back from a shoulder injury, had six kills in 12 attempts with zero errors. 
The key to this matchup was the experience of Hoosier setter Karen Dunham. Time and time again, Dunham set up her front line for easy kills. Two players who stood out for Indiana with their play at the net were Heather 

Minnealy and Julie Cauley, with 
nine kills and eight kills, 
respectively. 
As a team, Indiana finished the 
match with 39 kills in 80 at­
tempts for a .488 efficiency. Dun­
ham finished with 30 assists, a 
very impressive total. 
In contrast, the Irish could only convert 30 out of 82 at­tempts into kills, finishing with a poor .366 percentage. Irish set­ters accounted for only 13 assists, showing that inconsistency still prevails at the setter position. 
Even with the disappointing loss, last week must still be con­sidered a success. Entering the week with a 4-6 record, the Irish needed victories badly, and proceeded to win three of four games against some formidable competition. 
Notre Dame needed a 
confidence-building victory 
against St. Louis on Friday, and 
responded with a three-game tri­
umph over the Billikens. Lambert 
had hoped that his team would 
use the momentum from the win 
in that match against the 
Hoosiers. 
But the showing of the team was not up to how it had per­formed against St. Louis, as many errors were scattered through­out Notre Dame's play. 
The team will have to continue to improve, though, as it faces tough North Star Conference foe Loyola Wednesday night in the ACC Arena. Both the Ramblers and the Irish are undefeated in conference play, so tomorrow's game should turn out to be quite a battle.

Women's tennis team takes second with good play in ND Invitational 
By MICHAEL). CHMIEL 
Sports Writer 

Western Michigan continued its reign as winners of the Irish Invita­tional for the third straight year by edging out Notre Dame in its own tournament by two points yesterday on the Courtney Tennis Courts. 
Western Michigan won 33 of the 36 matches it played to overcome the Irish who finished with 31 wins (points). Coming in third was Toledo with I4 points, followed by Saint Mary's with I2, Central Mic­higan with nine, and Ferris State with four. 
"Western Michigan has a really good team," commented Irish co­captain Lisa LaFratta. "We were get­ting a little tired at the end, but I think we played well overall. 
In the tournament, the Irish 
singles players did fairly well, win­
played. All four downfalls came at 
the hands of the eventual champs. 
For the Irish, junior Mary Col­
ligan, who played in the number one 
spot, went 5-1 in the two day tourna­
ment. Colligan lost only to Amy 
Yeast of Western Michigan, 6-2,6-1. 
Senior LaFratta, who also was 5-1, 
lost to Maria Whitfield, 7-6, 6-0 to 
scar her otherwise perfect outing.

Askin replaces injured Williams at guard spot 
ByTRISH SULLIVAN 
Sports Writer 

Following a rough beginning in his college years, it seems that some of the rewards that are due to John Askin after his hard work and dedica­tion are finally materializing for John Askin. 
This past spring, Askin switched from the tackle to the guard posi­tion. His top-flight performance as a run blocker and his proven quick­ness prompted the change. The change ofposition did not grab a lot of attention at the time, because it made him a back-up to consensus all-America Larry Williams. But due to Williams' nagging injuries this season in games against Purdue and Missouri, Askin got his opportunity to start for the Irish against Michigan State, Colorado and Miami. 
"To be quite honest, when I first came to Notre Dame I didn't think my chances were very good at even playing," says Askin. "When I was put behind Larry, I thought that I would have two more years left to play after Larry graduated. It really feels good to be starting. The coaches showed that they have a lot ofconfidence in me." 
"I was happy to make the switch to guard. I like to run more, and a guard has to move a lot more. I also can't keep weight on like Tom Doerger can, for example." 
The switch did not change the di­lemma of an offensive lineman for Askin, however. 
When a running back has an out­standing effort, his name is splashed on the front page of the paper the next day. Yet when an outstanding running back does not do as well as most people expect, some of the criticism is directed to the play of the offensive line. 
Whether it is justified or not, it must be difficult for an offensive lineman to give his best effort and not see much ofthe glory. But Askin has a different view on the position he plays. 
"Sure, we don't get all the press, but we have the satisfaction of knowing that we put forth an effort to the team's success," says Askin. "It takes eleven players out on that field, and we all have to do our job." 
A consensus prep All-American, Askin earned four letters at Moeller High School in Cincinnati as offen­
see ASKIN, page 6 
Third for the Irish was sophomore JoAnne Biafore, who was defeated in close sets, 6-4, 7-6, by Sonya Garshnek, for her only loss in the tournament in six games. Junior Izzy O'Brien was downed by identical 6­4 scores byJan Weigand. 
In doubles, the Irish were aiso 
very successful as they took I I of I 2 challenges. In the number one spot for the Irish, junior Susie Panther and senior co-captain Laura Lee compiled a 5-I record, losing only to the Western Michigan team ofjanet Ray and Sherry Collins, 6-2, 7-6. 
"We could have done a lot better, but we waited until the last set to get going," said Lee. "Western Michigan played well throughout the whole tournament." 
The second Irish doubles team of senior Cathy Schnell and freshman Michelle Dasso wound up the tourn­ament as the only undefeated Irish unit going 6-0. This senior-freshman duo provided Western Michigan with one of its three losses in the tournament. They were successful in downing team of Karen Seaman and Michelle Coddens, 6-I, 7-5. 
"The last match was exciting," said Lee. Lee believed that the sue­cess ofthe winners could be accred­ited to their lineup which placed their number one and two singles players against the number two and three players for Notre Dame. 
"Overall, we looked great the first matches," said Lee. "But we didn't pull it off when we needed to." 
"The doubles teams are finally starting to look good," commented LaFratta. "I think that on any given day we could beat Western Mic­higan in a dual match." 
In the tournament, the Saint Mary's Belles also had a good outing as they won 14 matches to finish fourth overall against these stronger teams who had scholarship players. 
"We always enjoy playing in the Irish Invitational. We thought that we did very good," said Belles head coach John Killeen. "Our overall play and concentration was very good." 
In singles action, the Belles won 11 out of 24 matches. Outstanding for Saint Mary's was Mary Carol Hall. The number two player in singles for the Belles wound up with a 4-2 record. Her only two losses were close and came against two of the top players in the tournament as she lost 6-3,6-3 to Whitfield of Western Michigan and 6-4, 7-6 to LaFratta of Notre Dame. 
In doubles, the Belles met less success as they were able to win

up a little, but they got into their rhythm pretty well after that, said Notre Dame coach Dennis Grace. "The guys knew this was a big game and they were a little tight to start with." 
The Irish tightened up after that initial shock and held the Billikens scoreless for the remainder of the half. 
Senior Dan Coughlin, a native of St. Louis, was in the Irish goal for the first half. Coughlin was well protected by freshman fullback Steve Lowney and sweeper Dominick Driano. 
"Dan Coughlin did a fine job once he settled down," Grace said. 
At halftime, Grace made some de­fensive adjustments to slow the SLU offense, and the Irish came out at­tacking as the second half began. 
The Irish were unable to mou.nt any serious scoring threats, however, but the acrobatic saves and aggressive play of keeper Jim Flynn kept the Billikens at bay also. 
St. Louis, held scoreless for the first 21 minutes of the second per­iod, later struck twice in ten minutes to put the game out ofreach. 
Notre Dame forward Rich Her­degen was given credit for the sole Irish goal of the day when an over­anxious St. Louis defender stole the ball from Herdegen and drilled the ball into his own net. Had SLU been so charitable from the start, the final score would have been much more pleasing for the Irish. 
"This was a key game for us, to say the least." Grace said. "Our players really didn't let SLU's national ranking get to them and I think they saw again today as they did against Indiana that we can play with the big guys. Their performance ought to give them some confidence." 
The Irish will need that confi­dence in the coming weeks as their upcoming schedule includes matches with perennial rivals Mar­quette and Akron. Akron is currently ranked second in the nation. 

Notre Dame will have a few days off to rest up from the loss to St. Louis and to prepare for Friday night's 8 p.m.' clash with Central Michigan on Cartier field.
