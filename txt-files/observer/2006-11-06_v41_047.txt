Due to scheduling conflicts, United Nations Secretary­General Koti Annan has can­celed his planned Nov. 12 visit to Notre Dame, a Mendoza College of Business official said Sunday. 
Annan was scheduled to be the keynote speaker at a peace conference Nov. 12-14 exploring how commerce can be a tool for building peace. Father Oliver Williams, the director of Mendoza's Center for Ethics and Culture and the conference's lead organ­izer, said he booked Annan

North Carolina governor emphasizes reliance on core values when enacting public policy 
By EVA BINDA News Writer 
Declaring ethics and core val­ues in policy-making as "not optional" Friday afternoon, North Carolina Gov. Michael Easley delivered a speech in the Snite Museum on the importance of drawing upon personal values in setting the right policy. 
In the talk, entitled "Intersection of Politics and Values in the 21st Century," Easley said the right policy is "the one that allows people to reach their potential so they can use their God-given gift<>."

"We realized students did­n't have access to the full alumni network until at least six weeks after graduation and sometimes even [longer]," said student body vice president Bill Andrichik.

Easley admitted that his "reli­gious faith guides [his] policy," but insisted this view does not violate the separation of church and state. 
"It's natural and appropriate to navigate public policy with our own internal moral compass," Easley said. 
He repeatedly referred to the importance of relying on one's core values in making and enforcing policy, helping less powerful members of society.

Soldiers request ND ite111s 
Student-run project sends care packages to 
U.S. forces overseas 
By KATE ANTONACCI News Editor 
For organizers of the Notre Dame Accounting Association's care package project, it is not the Gatorade mix, sunflower seeds or ban­dannas that they need the largest stock of-it is "some­thing, anything to do with Notre Dame," according to senior organizer Rena Zarah. 
Though the group collects everything from Christmas COs and DVDs to beef jerky and ChapStick, it is Notre Dame memorabilia that mem­bers of the armed forces serv­ing overseas ask for most fre­quently. 

"We collect names and addresses of soldiers overseas serving our country. These men and women either grad­uated from Notre Dame, are related or are friends with a Notre Dame student, faculty or staff, or are from the Notre Dame community," Zarah said. "This is the most rewarding project I personal­ly have ever been involved 
in." 
The care package project, which began four years ago, started out small, sending "at most 20" packages overseas in its first year, said Zarah, who is organizing the project with junior Liz Byrum. The

I'm no conservative. Terms like "family values" make me cringe, and whenever I hear mention of "traditional marriage" this election season, I want to run back to my apartment and put on Steve Kerins my rainbow bandanna. 
In spite of News Writer 
all that, I've 
always 
thought of 
Notre Dame and its surrounding 
community as a place where the 
norms of a simpler time are 
embraced, and where a refreshing 
sense of common courtesy holds the 
day. And while I might not always 
agree with Notre Dame's values, I 
know that they stem from a sincere 
desire to set right the ills of the 
larger world. 
This is why I'm concerned that 
the decency for which our 
University is known is under threat 
from the outside. 
In my small East Coast hometown, 
our local coffee shop recently made 
the news following a fight over a 
parking space in which one driver 
maced another, sending her to the 
hospital. 
Now, this is a feeling I can relate to. We've all felt frustrated when that self1sh mom in the ugly hip­buggers takes up two parking spaces with her Suburban, forcing us to park illegally so we can run in to get our dry-cleaning. We all know the pain of waiting in line at the store as that fool with the comb-over pays for his $1.50 tube of toothpaste with a debit card. 
I know a Notre Dame woman who 
carries a "rape whistle" to defend 
herself in the event of an attack, 
which I find a bit quaint. A friend 
at home carries nunchucks in her 
purse for the same purpose. 
I am frequently offended by cer­tain local drivers, who seem to find the concept of the "fast lane" diffi­cult to grasp. I am not at all ashamed of peppering them with obscene gestures and choice lan­guage as I zoom past them in the right-hand lane. But I try to remind myself that Notre Dame is a world unto itself, and screaming at the elderly as they wind their way to the Bookstore won't help me fit into this culture. 

I love that visitors write into The Observer to tell us how nicely they were treated at football games. I love that my school has a reputa­tion for personal conduct that pre­cedes me wherever I go. And I hope that Notre Dame continues to set itself apart, and that its students continue to conduct themselves with class when they leave this place. 
This is one rare instance in which I hope we never bend to seculariz­ing, depersonalizing elements in the world around us.

During his time as governor. Easley has taken steps to improve education and shorten the achievement gap between people of different races in North Carolina. One example, Easley said, is reducing the sizes of kindergarten classes.

project has continued to grow each year, sending a record number of 150 packages last fall. 
The group is expecting to send fewer packages -about 120 -this year because "there has been a drop in the number of people overseas," Zarah said. Sixty names have alreadv been collected and Zarah expects that number to increase as the deadline approaches. All the packages should be put together and shipped overseas the Tuesday before Thanksgiving. 
While the number of pack­ages has decreased, the num­ber of supporters has done just the opposite. 
"I think it's definitely become a more school-wide project rather than just the Notre Dame Accounting Association project," Zarah said. 
After sending an e-mail to the campus community, Zarah said her inbox was "flooded" with more than 200 messages from people who want to help out or donate. 
"Everyone is really support­ive of it," she said. Some are from those asking 

for packages to be sent to a particular soldier -"he has a wife and with their first child on the way at home," one e­mail read -and others from those asking what they can do to help. 
''I'm an NO (Alliance for Catholic Education] teacher in Baton Rouge, Louisiana," read one e-mail. "I was wondering if it would be possible to have my students (1Oth-11th grade) write letters to the troops to be included in packages ... J think that this would be an excellent service-learning project for them." 
But help is not coming just from Notre Dame graduates; the greater South Bend com­munity has heard about the Accounting Association's proj­ect, and many people have expressed interest. 
"A local elementary school is having the students write letters to put in the boxes," Zarah said. 
Local businesses like CVS Pharmacy on Ironwood and Meijer have donated to the cause, Zarah said. 
"NO Food Services and The Shirt also give us a large amount of items," she said. 
Zarah said that sending such letters and packages is the "least we can do to demonstrate our gratitude."

For the next two weeks beginning today. the Association will collect dona­tions in the lobby of the Mendoza College of Business from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday through Friday. 
Zarah said monetary dona­tions may also be given to cover the costs of shipping and purchasing items for the packages. 
Other items needed for packages include: letters, non-crushable snacks, Christmas lights, decorations, cookies, microwave popcorn, copies of campus publica­tions, magazines, sunscreen, candy, baby wipes and eye drops. 
"It is important to let these men and women know that they are in our hearts and prayers, especially through the holiday season," Zarah said.

The University of Notre Dame will offer a new mas­ter's degree in educational administration beginning next summer. 
The new degree program is an expansion of the Alliance for Catholic Education (ACE] Leadership Program, which is itself an outgrowth of Notre Dame's ACE, which provides eollege graduates an opportu­nity to earn master of educa­tion degrees while serving as teachers in understaffed Catholic schools nationwide. Since it began in 2002. the ACE Leadership Program has trained 82 teachers in profes­sional administration. foster­ing community within schools, and spiritual formation. All of these teachers have remained in Catholic schools, 50 of them in administrative positions. 
According to Father Ronald R. Nuzzi, director of the ACE Leadership Program, the master's in educational administration will require the addition of new courses and 11 credit hours to the curriculum of the ACE Leadership Program. The required courses include "Exceptionalities in Education," "Educational Hesearch and Methodology," "Action Research," and "The History and Philosophy of Catholic Education." 
"All of us in ACE believe that Catholic schools are at the heart of the Church," Nuzzi said. "It is a great privi­lege to launch this new degree which says that Notre Dame ·is serious about the renewal of K-12 Catholic schools." 
Among the most ardent advocates of the new mastpr's program has been University President Emeritus Father Theodore llesburgh.

Although Easley said much progress had been made on the state-level in North Carolina, he had plenty of criticism for the politics in Washington, D.C. 
"Too many in Washington have forgotten their core prin­ciples and left Americans in their wake," Easley said. In the nation's capital, he said, there is "too much concern for party politics" and not enough con­cern for constituents. 
"[Politicians in Washington] are focused more on future elections than future genera­tions," Easley said. 
He said that among other reductions, Washington has cut Federal 'Pell grant scholarships, despite "the clear need for a more educated population." Whenever cuts are made on the federal level, the states have to make up for that loss, Easley said. He also criticized how Washington has been funding the war effort.

Iran prepared to open negotiations 
TEHRAN -Iran said Sunday it was open to negotiations with the United States on Iraq and other regional issues but hinted it would not drop its refusal to talk about its con­tentious nuclear program. 
As the U.N. Security Council geared up for a protracted debate on !>auctioning Iran over its nuclear program, Tehran praised Russia for its "softer" stance on the issue. 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini said Iran would consider talks with the U.S. over regional issues, including Iraq, if Washington requested. He would not elaborate, and there was no immediate response from the United States on the offer. 
"If there is any official request about regional issues, we are ready to review it," Hosseini told reporters. 
However, he said Iran would not change its position regarding bilateral relations with the U.S., suggesting Tehran would refuse to talk about the nuelear issue. 
Unrest over federal police continues 
OAXACA, Mexico -Thousands of anti-gov­ernment demonstrators marched through this tense colonial city on Sunday, demanding the security forces abandon camps they set up last week to end a five-month protest. 
Masked police officers clutching automatic weapons watched the protesters from rooftops as they marched to a plaza about a block away from the encampments, yelling "Get out federal police!" 
The leaders then formed a human chain to keep the crowd of 20,000 from confronting police, but about 400 people broke through and attacked the officers with stones and bottles. The forces raised shields to protect themselves but did not use tear gas or fire their weapons.

Evangelist apologizes after dismissal 
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -Saying that he was a "deceiver and liar" who had given in to his dark side, the Rev. Ted Haggard confessed to sexual immorality Sunday in a letter read from the pulpit of the megachurch he founded. 
The disgraced former president of the National Evangelical Association, which repre­sents 30 million evangelical Christians, apolo­gized and said "because of pride, I began deceiv­ing those I love the most because I didn't want to hurt or disappoint them." 
"The fact is I am guilty of sexual immorality. And I take responsibility for the entire problem. I am a deceiver and a liar," he said. 
Haggard, 50, resigned last week as NFA presi­dent, where he held sway in Washington and condemned homosexuality, after a man claimed to have had drug-fueled homosexual trysts with him.

''I'm optimistic," Vice President Dick Cheney said. Republicans hoped their party's acclaimed get-out­the-vote operation would prevent a Democratic rout in a campaign marked by voter fury over the Iraq war. "Things have been coming our way the~e last couple of weeks," Cheney said. 
Pelosi, D-Calif., said if the election had been held Sunday, Democrats would gain the 15 seats needed to run the House. "But a lot can happen in 48 hours," she said in New Britain, Conn. "This is a tough fight." 
Her party appears increasingly confident it can ride a wave of public disen­chantment with the admin­istration's policies to victory in the House, and. possibly, the Senate, too.

SUDAN TAIWAN 
Leaders deny role in latest Darfur violence 
Associated Press 

KHARTOUM -The Sudanese government on Sunday denied involvement in a new wave of violence in the Darfur region that killed more than 50 people, blaming "outlaws" for the attacks. 
The United Nations released a report Friday accusing the gov­ernment-allied janjaweed mili­tia of raiding seven villages and a refugee camp in the Jebel Moon area of West Darfur on Oct. 29-30. 
The U.N. cited witnesses say­ing that men clad in Sudanese military officers' garb were with the horse-mounted militia when they attacked, killing at least 27 children and about as many adults. 
"At the very least, the attacks demonstrated the government of Sudan's continued failure to disarm militia in Darfur, and at worst its use of militia forces that target civilian populations," the U.N. report said. 
Sudan's government dis­missed the report as misleading. 
"We should be cautious about these reports circulated by the western media because they contain huge amounts of lies, manipulation and lack of credi­bility," Foreign Ministry spokesman Ali Sadeq told the official Sudan News Agency. 
"There are active outlaws in Darfur and it is not fair to accuse the government for all the looting, killing and vio­lence," Sadeq added. 
Sudan's Arab-dominated gov­ernment has long denied back­ing the janjaweed, a militia of Arab nomads blamed for much of the atrocities against ethnic African villagers in Darfur since 2003, when African rebels first took up arms against Khartoum. 
More than 200,000 people have since been killed, and 2.5 million displaced in the conflict. 
A May peace agreement between the government and one rebel group has been large­ly ignored and violence has escalated in recent months, with increased rebel infighting and a large army offensive in the north of the region. 
The foreign ministry said that neither the Sudanese army nor regular pro-government para­military groups were at present fighting in Darfur, contradicting multiple reports by internation­al observers in Darfur that the army and pro-government mili­tia continue to regularly clash with rebels in the region. 
In August, the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution that would allow the U.N. to take control of and significantly expand a peacekeeping force in Darfur, run so far by the African Union. But Khartoum opposes the move as "neocolonial." 
President denies e111bezzle111ent 
Shui-bian refuses to resign, maintains first lady wrongly accused 
Associated Press 

TAIPEI -Taiwan's president refused to resign on Sunday and denied allegations that he and his wife had embezzled public money. But the opposi­tion did not buy his defense and prepared to launch a new campaign to remove him from office. 
President Chen Shui-bian's comments were his first since prosecutors indicted first lady Wu Shu-chen on embezzle­ment, forgery and perjury charges on Friday. She was accused of taking $450,000 from a special diplomacy fund in 2002-06. 
Prosecutors said Chen could be implicated in the case, but he cannot be indicted as a sit­ting president. 
The graft allegations have re-energized an opposition campaign to topple Chen, who has served for six rocky years and has 18 months left in his term. Thousands of protesters marched in the streets this weekend in Taiwan's two biggest cities. They honked air horns and carried signs read­ing, "End Corruption." 
Chen said the accusations announced Friday were painful and felt like a "politi­cal death sentence." 
"How can Chen Shui-bian be that kind of person, collecting false invoices to embezzle money?" he said Sunday in an hourlong televised address from the presidential office. 
He refused calls to resign immediately but said: "If my wife is convicted, then because the prosecutors believe my wife and I act together, I cannot escape. I'm willing to resign before my term is up." 
The president and his family have been dogged by corrup­tion rumors for months, hut the latest scandal blew up with Friday's indictment. 
Some 4,000 protesters gath­ered earlier Sunday to demand Chen's resignation, and the deafening sound of blaring air horns rose from the crowd marching through downtown Taipei toward the wide boulevard in front of the presidential office. 
"The prosecutor's report was crystal clear," said Tsai Wen-chih, a computer engi­neer. "Without concrete evi­dence, would any prosecutor dare to accuse the president of corruption?" 
"Chen had better admit his errors," said Peter Huang, a businessman. "The longer he tries to hang on, the more cat­astrophic his outcome will be." 
In his address, Chen denied that he or his wife pocketed money from the special diplo­matic fund and complained that the regulations for the fund were "confusing and dif­ficult to follow." He then launched into a long, technical explanation about how the fund works, and he argued that the rules for using it needed to be more flexible. 
Chen failed to convince the Nationalists, the biggest oppo­sition party. 
"It sounded like a lawyer's, not a president's defense. We still want him to resign imme­diately," said the party's spokesman Huang Yu-chen. 
Opposition lawmakers said they planned Monday to launch their third attempt at passing a measure to recall Chen. They made a similar attempt in June and in October, but failed to muster the required two-thirds major­ity in the legislature needed to pass the motion calling for a referendum of Taiwanese vot­ers on whether to oust Chen. 
The opposition is hoping that ruling party lawmakers will begin defecting to their cause and give them enough votes to pass the recall meas­ure later this month. Already, the small pro-Chen Taiwan Solidarity Union announced its 12 lawmakers would be encouraged to vote for the recall measure.

IN BRIEF 
Researchers tout new lice treabnent 
SALT lAKE CITY -Head lice -those nasty nuisances for schoolchildren and parent<> -were blown away in half an hour by a new blow dryer­like device it<> inventors call the "Louse Buster," university researchers report. 
The device, which kills bugs and eggs by drying them out, might one day offer an alternative to the powerful delousing shampoos and literal nit­picking currently necessary for dealing with this widespread problem. 
The LouseBuster results were reported in the November issue of the journal Pediatrics by University of Utah researchers who said the device eliminates infestations by preventing reproduction. 
The study, involving 169 children in the Salt Lake area, showed the LouseBuster killed 80 per­cent of hatched lice and 98 percent of eggs on infested children. Enough bugs were killed to prevent remaining lice from breeding so "virtual­ly all subjects were cured of head lice when examined one week following treatment with the Louse Buster," the scientist<> wrote. 
'The idea would be that instead of sending kids home from school, which is a hardship on kids and the parent<>, a kid might be able to go to the front office and get treated" and return to class, said biologist Dale Clayton, the co-inventor and leader of the research.

Google Earth aids local initiative 
Environnzental groups use program to display effects of mountaintop mining 
Associated Press 

VICCO, Ky. -Benny Campbell expertences mountaintop mining day and night. His bed is rattled by the blasting. Gray dust blankets his porch and car if a few days go by without rain. His electricity goes out repeatedly when the coal miners accidentally knock down power lines. 
But the worst thing of all, he says, is that the moun­tain peaks that once loomed over his lifelong eastern Kentucky home have been flattened by dynamite and bulldozers. 
"When I was young, it was a really pretty place," said Campbell, 53, who lives in a hollow called Bull Creek near Vicco. "Now it's just a rock pile. You can't do nothing with it." 
Now environmentalists have found a way to let the rest of the world see what mountaintop coal mining has done to Appalachia: They have started a Web site that uses the Google Earth database to enable people to see aerial recon­naissance photos of the scarred countryside. 
"The point is mountaintop removal has gone on under a cloak of secrecy," said Mary Anne llitt, executive director of Appalachian Voices, one of a half-dozen environmental groups involved in the Internet campaign. "Unless you have the experience of flying over the region in a small plane, it's hard to understand the scale of mountaintop removal." 
Their Web site, http://www.ilovemountains.o rg/, was launched in mid­September with a link to the campaign's "National Memorial of the Moun­tains," which shows a Coo­gle Earth map of Appa­lachia. The map pinpoints areas of mountaintop removal with graphics of flags at half-staff, and a 3-d tour reveals clear views of 
' sludge ponds, blasting holes and mountains scraped of their peaks. The coal industry says the 

Web site buries the benefits of mountaintop mining. 
"I clearly think it's for shock value," said Bill Caylor, head of the Kentucky Coal Association. "They're playing the emo­tional card on us." 
Caylor and Carol Raul­ston, spokeswoman for the National Mining Associa­tion, said the Web site is misleading because it fails to acknowledge mine reda­mation project'>. 
"In many parts of Appalachia, these reclama­tion activities have provided much needed level land above the flood plain for construction of schools, gov­ernment offices, medical facilities, airport<>, shopping centers and housing devel­opments," Raulston said in an e-mail. 
For James Bowling, mountaintop removal has been a blessing. The 59­year-old built his dream home atop a flattened mountain called Red Oak and has 250 acres of newly leveled land to raise 80 head of cattle and vegeta­bles. 
"If it wasn't for mountain­top removal, l wouldn't be here," said Bowling, who lived in the valley below Red Oak before allowing a mine company to extract coal from his property at 50 cents per ton. 
Chester Stevens of Hazard, one of the most heavily mined areas in ea.St­ern Kentucky, said moun­taintop removal allowed him to build the home in which he lived for 15 years. 
"We in Hazard had no place to build," said Stevens, 58. "Mining looks bad when it's going on, but then you have some beauti­ful land after that and that can be used by people." 
Bitt said the harm to the environment should be of greater concern than devel­opment. "We're eliminating mountains off the face of the Earth," she said, adding, "The reclaimed sites look nothing more than anemic golf courses." 
Folks Jiving near Camp­bell's hollow also say there's no good side to mountaintop mining and that their small commun1ty values the natu­ral beauty of the mountains over new buildings and resorts. 

Stocks fall as oil rises amid threats 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK-Wall Street ended the week with a moderate decline Friday aft1~r oil prices jumpPd on word of pos­sible attacks in Nigeria npar produc­tion facilities. The rise in crude prices sapped enthusiasm over a Labor Department report that the nation's unemployment rate fell to a five-year low. 
While stocks overall fell for a third straight day. the Dow Jones industrial average. the best-known stock index, logged its first six consecutive day drop since June 2005. Light, sweet crude rose $1.26 to $59.14 on the New York Mercantile Exchange after U.S. diplomat-; in Nigeria warnf'd that mili­tant'> are planning a series of kidnap­pings and bombing attacks in the com­ing days in areas where oil is extract­ed. 
The Labor Department said the unemployment rate fell to 4.4 percent last month from 4.6 percent in September, easing some concerns that the economy has slowed too quickly. For more than a week, investors have been nervous about the strength of the economy following a stream of disap­pointing data. While Wall Street want-; growth to cool so the threat of inflation will dissipate and the Federal Reserve can eut int11rest rates, a precipitous slowdown could slice into consumf'r spPnding and corporate profit<;. 
Alan Gayit'. senior investmPnt stratf'gist and director of asset alloca­tion for Trusco Capital Managenumt, said the employment figures suggest the economy has more power than expected going into the holiday spend­ing season but warned that the strength could make the Fed uneasy. "Investors have to digest the notion that the Fed is going to remain poised to lift interest rates as we go into 2007." 
The Dow closed down 32.50, or 0.27 percent, at 11 ,986.04. It was the aver­age's first close under 12,000 since Oct. 19, when it finished above that milestone for the first time. 
Broadt>r stock indicators also closed lower. The Standard & Poor's 500 indPx fell 3.04. or 0.22 percent, to 1,364.30. and the Nasdaq composite index fell 3.23, or 0.14 percent, to 2,330.79. 
Diet books shovvn on 'Oprah' selllllillions 
Associated Press 

NEW YOHK -The Oprah book dub has been quiet for months, but the Winfrey touch remains golden. 
Just ask the publishers of diet doctors Michael F. Hoizen and Mehmet C. Oz. 
Since an appearance last Thursday on Winfrey's televi­sion talk show. books by Roizen and Oz have occupied the top three spots on the best seller list of Amazon.com, with customers buying both the book alone and the book and DVD of their new work, "YOU: On a Diet," and the hardcover edition of a previ­ous text. "YOU: The Owner's Manual," a million seller in 2005 thanks in part to Winfrey. 
"Oprah obviously has a pas­sion for their work. It's very exciting," said Martha Levin, publisher of the Free Press, an imprint of Simon & Schuster that has increased the print run of "YOU: On a Diet," from 650,000 to 950,000. 
Hoizen and Oz specialize in easy-to-understand guides to healthy living, written with hip, simple language. The authors regard the human body as a house _ the heart is the water main, the digestive system part of the plumbing and the bones the foundation. 
Winfrey's support. for Hoizen and Oz is separate from her book club picks, which virtu­ally guarantees hundreds of thousands of sales. Her last official selection was 10 months ago, when she chose Elie Wiesel's "Night," her longest hiatus since she sus­pended the club for a year in 2002-2003. 
"It has been a long time," Levin told the AP on Sunday, "and publishers have been thinking about her club with nostalgia." 
NBC .~Nightly Ne-ws' back on top 
Associated Press 

NEW YOHK Brian Williams has the smile of a man about to unleash a secret weapon. 
Or two. He's preparing for his first election night as NBC News' chief anchor Tuesday knowing he'll be flanked on the broadcast by his predeces­sor, Tom Brokaw, and Tim Hussert, the Washington veter­an popular for his plainspoken intensity during tense nights of vote counting. 
It's a formidable edge to take into competition with two other rookies in the role, CBS' Katie Couric and ABC's Charles Gibson, and could help cement his status as the most popular network news anchor. 
Not that there weren't a few anxious moments around NBC News earlier this fall. 
Williams' "Nightly News" was knocked from its first­place perch for two weeks by Couric's "CBS Evening News" upon her early September debut, falling perilously close to third. But NBC returned to the top during Couric's third week, and hasn't been beaten since. 
Williams got letters from regular viewers telling him they had tried Couric's broad­cast, including one man who admitted his wife made him watch for a week, he said. 
"As one of our executives put it, (they came) crawling home with the vague hint of cheap perfume and lipstick on their collar, crawling back after having an affair with another network," Williams told The Associated Press. "People are so loyal, is my point, that they feel the need to tell me that they've been watching someone else." 
In retrospect, Williams and his executive producer, John Heiss, said they expected "Nightly News" would be hurt initially since Couric was a former colleague at NBC News. 
They also said they weren't surprised that the evening­news competition quickly returned to the same pecking order that was in place for the last few years when Brokaw, Peter Jennings and Dan Rather were on each night ­NBC first, ABC second and CBS third. 
"I go home each night with the confidence of' knowing we did the best broadcast that evening," Williams said. "I believe the best journalism wins the most viewers on tele­vision. It finds its audience. The audience finds it. So I never for a moment thought these long-established pat­terns were going to be upend­ed for the long haul." 
It's probably safe now for people at NBC News to exhale, said Andrew Tyndall, a con­sultant who studies the con­tent of the evening newscasts. 
To upend Williams, Couric has to prove she is markedly better at the job and she has­n't done that, he said. 
"His newscast is not a work in progress," Tyndall said. "It's sure of itself and has got its own rhythm so there are very few missteps in a half hour. They know what they're doing and they execute their plan."

Man serving life for civil rights killing dies 
Associated Press 
Former Ku Klux Klan Imperial Wizard Samuel H. Bowers, who was convicted eight years ago of ordering the 1966 bombing death of a civil rights leader, died Sunday in a state penitentiary, officials said. He was 82. 
He died of cardio pulmonary arrest, said Mississippi Department of Corrections spokeswoman Tara Booth. 
Bowers was convicted in August of 1998 of ordering the assassination ofVernon Dahmer Sr., a civil rights activist who had fought for black rights dur­ing Mississippi's turbulent struggle for racial equality. He was sentenced to life in prison. 
"He was supposed to stay there until he died. I guess he fulfilled that," Dahmer's widow, Ellie Dahmer, told The Associated Press on Sunday. "He lived a lot longer than Vernon Dahmer did." 
Booth said that the Klansman died at approximately 11:30 
a.m. in the Mississippi State Penitentiary Hospital in Parchman, a sprawling prison carved out of the cotton and soybean fields in the impover­ished Mississippi Delta. 
Dahmer, who championed equal voting rights for blacks, died at the age of 58 after being fire-bombed outside his Hattiesburg-area home on Jan. 10, 1966. The attack came after 
Dahmer announced that resi­
dents could pay their poll taxes 
at his grocery store, which was 
next to his home. The home and 
store also were torched. 
When the Dahmer family awoke to honking horns in the pre-dawn hours that January morning, two carloads of Klansmen were waiting outside. They firebombed Dahmer when he exited the home, according to court testimony during a four-day trial in Forrest County Circuit Court in 1998. 
Dahmer was able keep the Klansmen at bay with a shotgun while his family fled, but flames had already seared his lungs and he died in his wife's arms about 12 hours later. 
During the trial, prosecutors claimed Bowers ordered the attack after becoming enraged that Dahmer was trying to reg­ister blacks to vote. 
Bowers' lawyers claimed he was "sacrificed to the media" to further the political ambitions of the attorney general at the time, Mike Moore. 
Earlier trials for Bowers, including at least two before all­white juries, ended in mistrials. A 1968 state jury split 11-1 in favor of guilty, while a 1969 jury split 10-2 in favor of cpn­viction. 
Bowers' conviction was just one in string of civil rights killings to be successfully prose­cuted in the South decades after the crimes were committed. 
Marathon tough for Artnstrong 
Cycler calls NYC competition ;hardest physical thing I've ever done' 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -His face twist­ed in pain, Lance Armstrong virtually walked the last couple of steps. lie slowed to a halt immediately after the finish line and bent to the ground, his green shirt soaked with sweat. 
No one's more familiar with how painful achieving goals can be. 
Still, not even he saw this coming. 
Armstrong barely met his lofty goal of breaking 3 hours in his first marathon, but it came at a price. No Alpine climb on his bicycle had ever been as tough as Sunday's New York City Marathon, he said. 
"For the level of condition that I have now, that was with­out a doubt the hardest physi­cal thing I have ever done," said Armstrong, who finished 856th. "I never felt a point where I hit the wall, it was really a gradual progression of fatigue and soreness." 
Armstrong's time was 2 hours, 59 minutes and 36 sec­onds. Afterward, he shuffled into a post-race news confer­ence, his right shin heavily taped. 
"I think I bit off more than I could chew, I thought the marathon would be easier," he said. "(My shins) started to hurt in the second half, espe­cially the right one. I could barely walk up here, because the calves are completely knot­ted up." 
Armstrong's build presented a stark contrast to the elite men's runners who preceded him on the course. The cycling champion's heavily muscled legs and powerful chest set him apart from the slender Kenyans who traditionally dominate the race. Even Armstrong compared the lead­ers' legs to pencils. 
And while there was little joy among the leaders during the race, Armstrong smiled and chat­ted amiably dur­miles. He started to fall off the pace n~quired to break 3 hours before a final push allowed him to meet his personal goal. 
"Before the race that was my goal, I wanted to break 3 hours. But if you told me with 3 miles to go, 'You're going to do 3:05,' I wouldn't have cared," he said. "Honestly, at the end I was so tired, I could­n't care. Now I'm glad I did."

Bush hails Saddam verdict

President celebrates sentence as nzilestonefor Iraq's young democracy 
New research shows 17,000 children are injured each year 
Associated Press 

CHICAGO -New national data show school bus-related accidents send 17,000 U.S. chil­dren to emergency rooms each year, more than double the num­ber in previous estimates that only includnd crashfls. 
Nearly one-fourth of the acci­dp,nts occur when children are board-on school bus safety," McGeehan said. 

The study appears in November's Pediatrics, being released Monday. 
The research, involving nonfa­tal injuries treated in emergency rooms. is based on 2001-2003 data from a surveillance system operated by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. Some 51,100 children up to age 19 were injured during the study period, or about 17,000 annual­ly, the researchers said.

GHAND ISLAND, Ncb. ­President Rush celebrated Saddam Hussein's death sen­tence as a victory for "Iraq's young democracy" and U.S. security, highlighting Sunday's verdict in the last hours of an eleetion campaign in which Hepublieans are suflering from publie discontent with the Iraq war.

Injuries range from cuts and sprains to broken bones, but most are not life-threatening and don't require hospitaliza­tion. And while the numbers are higher than previously reported, they represent a small fraction of the 23.5 million children who travel on school buses nation­wide each year, the researchers said. 
The researchers said the results provide a strong argu­ment for requiring safety belts on school buses, something industry groups say is unneces­sary and is more than many school districts can afford. 
Safety belts, particularly lap­shoulder belts "could not only prevent injuries related to crashes," they could also keep kids seated "so they're not falling out of their seats when buses make normal turns or brake," said lead author Jennifer McGeehan, a researcher at Columbus Children's Hospital's Center for Injury Research and Policy in Columbus, Ohio. 
"Our study shows that there needs to be continued vigilance With the verdict a chance to

high points of the war for Bush 
-he repeated these points later 
during campaign visil'i to two of 
America's n~ddest states. 

"Today we witnessed a land­mark event in the history of Iraq," Bush said in western Nebraska. where he was trying to boost GOP state Sen. Adrian Smith in a tightened race against Democrat Scott Kleeb. Deliwred in solid Bush Country, in an arena awash in red clothing, the president's Iraq lines earned the most sustained cheering of his speech. 
"My decision to remove Saddam Hussein was the right decision and the world is better off for it," he said to raucous applause. 
An Iraqi court convicted Saddam narlier Sunday and sen­tenced him to die by hanging for ordering the torture and murder of nearly 150 Shiites from the city of Dujail in 1982. Six subor­dinates were also found guilty of crimes against humanity, which came after what Saddam said was an assassination attempt against him. 
Shiites rejoiced at the death sentence for the former dictator who terrorized their population. But Saddam's fellow Sunnis paraded through his hometown in protest. With sectarian vio­lence already pushing Iraq to the brink of civil war, presidential counselor Dan Bartlett said Bush is confident U.S. forces and Iraqi soldiers were prepared to con­tain any spike in bloodshed. 
Democral'i -hoping for large gains that could put them in con­trol of the House and possibly the 
Senate -moved quickly to both 
applaud thP sentence and repeat 
their campaign-trail argument 
that Bush's leadership on Iraq 
has been a failure. 

"The scope of that failure is not 
lessened by the results of 
Sad dam's trial," House Minority 
Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., 
poised to become I louse speaker 
if Democrats wrest the majority 
from the GOP. 

A history of Election Day disap­pointments and a constantly shifting pre-eleetion landscape appeared to have Democrats a bit jittery. New York Sen. Charles Schumer, in charge of Democratic campaign efforts in the Senate, said, "I don't think (Sad-dam's) conviction makes much of a difference in this elec­tion, even though it's a very good thing that happened." 
Other Republicans backed Bush's contention of the verdict as evidence of success in Iraq. "The United States and the world are safer because Saddam Hussein sits on death row, not in a palace in Baghdad plotting to harm millions of innocent Americans and Iraqis," said House Majority Whip Roy Blunt. R-Mo. 
But at least one Republican said the news must be viewed in the context of the difficult situa­tion in Iraq. 
"Saddam Hussein's trial is a step forward because it was a result of a legal system in opera­tion, not a dictator in operation, so that's the good news," Sen. Undsey Graham, R-S.C., said on CNN's "Late Edition." "But when you look at the institutions of government in Iraq, they're all under siege.... We just need a strategy to provide better securi­ty to get this right." 
for the last decade 
or so, the agency said. The tally is based on police reports, and not all injuries resulted in emergency room treatment. 
In a 2002 report to Congress, NHTSA recommended against lap-only belts in school buses because they can be risky, espe­cially in small children, by restraining them high on the abdomen, potentially causing internal injury in a crash. 
Five states -California, Florida, Louisiana, New Jersey and New York -and some dis­tricts have implemented varying safety belt requirements for school buses, according to the National Coalition for School Bus Safety, a nonprofit advocacy group. 
"It's an expensive proposition administration insists is evident in Iraq. 
'This is getting the Iraqis to stand up on their own," Snow said. "You can't have civil society without rule of law." 
Rush painted Saddam's convic­tion and sentence as vindication of the sacrifices made by American soldiers in Iraq. More than 2,800 members of the U.S. military have died since the U.S.­led invasion in March 2003. 
"They've sacrificed for the seeurity of the United States," said the president, who spoke to reporters for two minutes in Texas before flying to campaign appearances on behalf of newly in-peril Republicans in Nebraska and Kansas. "Without their courage and skill, today's verdict would not have happened."

What a cam-pain in the butt 
January 2007: After sweeping to victory in la<>t November's midterm elections, the Democratic Party regained control of the House and Senate for the first time in more than a decade. Now, only a week into the new Congressional term, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid are already up to their ears in scan­dals that the Republican Party so wisely forecasted in its 2006 campaign advertisements ­all of which turned out to be 1 00-per­cent true. 
As predicted by the Republican National Committee, newly elected Tennessee Senator Harold E. Ford Jr., the first African-American Senator from the South since Reconstruction, has already convert­ed his Russell Senate Building office into an East Coast annex of the Playboy Mansion. The scantily clad blonde who winked suggestively and said, "Harold, call me," in last fall's campaign ad has ironi­cally been named Ford's chief mistress, and she ha<> not wasted any time in installing hot tubs, saunas, ma<>sage tables, stripper poles and sex swings in his new office. 
Unfortunately, the controversies facing the Democrats do not end with Senator Ford. Freshman Virginia Senator Jim Webb, as well, has taken heat for his attempts to pass legislation that would make his often-explicit, adult novels required reading for all students in America's public elementary schools. Webb reportedly has no concern that chil­dren will be forced to read passages like the following from his book, A COtmtry Such As This: "Two North Vietnamese 

Joey 
Falco 

forty Ounces 
to Falco 
nurses attended Red in the hospital, flirt­ing with him coyly, until one day when one of them came to him, took off her top [and performed a sexual aet]." According to Webb's office, the senator hopes to encour­age similar erotic behavior in America's youths. 
In this sadistic venture, Webb dearly has been in cahoots with Ohio's newly elected Democratic governor, Ted Strickland, who -as everyone who watched his former opponent's ad campaign knows -is a vehement supporter of man-boy love. Specifically, according to gubernatorial loser Ken Blackwell, Strickland once failed to support a resolution condemning sex between adults and children, and this his­tory of vicarious pedophilia has certainly returned to the political forefront. Just yes­terday, Strickland introduced legislation that would permit teacher-student sexual relations in Ohio's public schools -as long as the teacher is over the age of 40 and the student under the age of 13. When reached for comment from his bedroom in his parents' basement, Blackwell would only say, "I told ya so." 
The situation is similar in the House of Representatives, where Pelosi clearly appears to be losing control of her party. Rep. Ron Kind of Wisconsin, whom a Republican opponent accused of "paying for sex" in a campaign ad la<>t fall.. has indeed lived up to the GOP's worst fears. Word for word from the ads criticizing him, Kind has already continued spending tax dollars to study "the sex lives of Vietnamese prostitutes," "the ma<>turba­tion habits of old men," and "to pay teenage girls to watch pornographic movies with probes connected to their genitalia." What's more, Kind ha<> pushed this reckless disregard for common decen­cy even further by using the results of these sex studies to determine why Vietnamese hookers are the best, how many Viagra pills Kind's heart can sustain at once, and how he ean get his female interns to start watching porn with him. 
According to Kind. he is enjoying sticking 
it to the social conservatives who ran the 
eountry since 1994 by paying for sex with 
government dollars. 
Of course, a penchant for sexual inde­
cency and an inherent desire to corrupt 
the virgin minds of America's youth have 
not been the only criticisms of the new 
Democratic Congressional leadership. As 
predicted by an ad sponsored by Indiana 
Congressman John N. Hostettler, Pelosi 
has immediately set to work putting in 
motion "her radical plan to advance the 
homosexual agenda." In fact, for the pa<>t 
several days, gays and lesbians have been 
dancing in the streets in response to 
Pelosi's legislation that not only renamed 
traditional heterosexual marriage "civil 
unions," but also allocated federal funds to 
the production of television shows like 
"The Gay Bachelor," "A Lesbian Wedding 
Story" and "Leave It to Beaver." 
In the Senate as well, Reid has wa<>ted no time in pa.<>sing a bill that would requirn all American soldiers in Iraq to "cut and run" home so that they can assist in giving abortions at the country's numerous understaffed family planning clinics. Just as the Republicans predicted in their ad campaign last fall, the Democrats would like nothing more than to undermine the social well-being of America and send us all straight to hell. 
Let this be a lesson to everyone who doubted the veracity and intent behind the negative ad campaigns of 2006: Mudslinging is the keystone ofAmerican democracy, and without it, we are no bet­ter than the terrorist<>.

LETIERS TO THE EDITOR 
Plan B 
Since the publication of my Letter to the Editor ("Women, students deserve apology," Nov. 2), I have received several emails in the spirit of the Andrew Rosato Letter to the Editor ("Plan B destroys embryo in some cases," Nov. 3), challenging my assertions that Plan B only prevents pregnancy by pre­venting ovulation, and no evidence has been found that it interferes with implantation. 
In light of these letters, I feel I owe my readers a slight apology, for not including citations to support these assertions; since I had no trouble finding supporting evidence, I assumed that the citations would simply be a waste of space. That assumption was incor­rect, and I am sorry for making it. Please allow me to correct my mistake now. In a brief written in 2005, the Population Council cites a peer-reviewed article to support the claim that "levonorgestrel [the drug used in Plan B] did not interfere with any postfertil­ization process required for embryo implan­tation." (As of this writing, that brief can be viewed online here: http://tinyurl.com/rkv48.) 
This year, in a summary of research on hormonal contraceptives and the copper IUD, Family Health International \\TOte that "There is no data available to support pre­vention of implantation as a contraceptive action of DMPA or any of the other currently available hormonal contraceptives, including pills and implants." (As of this writing, this source can be viewed online here: http://tinyurl.com/yyfc3g.) 
Regarding Barr Pharmaceuticals' own Web site, as quoted in Rosato's letter, I would point out that they use the qualifier "may," do not provide citations, and use nontechni­cal, informal language. This makes it difli­cult, at best, to accurately interpret and evaluate the quoted claims. I thank you for the opportunity to correct my previous mis­take.

Club leaders to discuss global health crisis 
I'd like to follow up with Amanda Golbabai's Letter to the Editor ("Club leaders discuss global health crisis," Oct. 27) two weeks ago and reemphasize the excite­ment and hope that the global health committee has towards the initiative to make a positive impact on the global health crisis through a united effort amongst student groups on campus. 
However, support and co-spon­sorship are needed amongst all these groups and I'm calling upon club and organization leaders, along with any other interested persons, to attend the initial meet­ing that will provide details with regard to our plans for action including fundraising, continuing education, the Notre Dame cur­riculum, political action and faith. Please join us and find out where your club fits into this campus­wide effort on Wednesday at 10 
p.m. in the Notre Dame Room of LaFortune. 
Once the Notre Dame student body is united, we can truly make a difference in the global health crisis on a scale we'd never dream possible as an individual. Come be a part of the difference. 
Katlyn Regan senior off campus Nov. 3 

Ticket lottery divides students 
Be fair about debate 
So now that we've all aired our opposing views on the ticket lottery situation, perhaps it's time to take a step back and look at what has been said and what has been ignored. Let's establish who I am first: I am a graduate student in my fifth year, so I've seen a lot of social and justice issues being aired in this debate. 
The Observer editorial made some good points but failed to offer proper context. Graduate students are removed from the social identity of the campus, but in large part that is because Notre Dame is so inwardly focused on its small families that it excludes anyone who doesn't enter into that structure their way. Don't blame or punish the grad students because they don't fit the traditional mold. 
At the same time, please do not belittle us by claiming the undergraduate "identity." The reason Notre Dame is a top-notch undergraduate school is because it attracts top-notch graduate students to help teach its classes and labs. Without those gradu­ate students, many important classes would cease to function in the way you have come to know. 
That said, I think this whole argument arises from a lack of focus on the part of the graduate students who started it. While we are students by definition, we are here with a very different purpose. Most of us are here not to be traditional students, but to make the step from students to professionals. 
In many cases the students raising these issues.are on stipend programs, which means we don't pay tuition, and right there is the best argument for excluding us from the lottery. As I read the initial protest e-mail I was stunned by the amount of energy and intensity that people would put into even a chance to get tickets. I can only imagine what these people might be accomplishing in their research if they weren't planning protests. Maybe the sad­dest part of this to me is that of all the problems we as graduate students have, from healthcare costs to cost-of-living adjust­ments and child-care to parking, that we have wasted what little bargaining power we have on sports tickets. In my opinion it's a sad situation -there are so many positive things we could have fought for that would have united, not divided. This is just the opinion of one graduate student who has been around the block. 
Take it or leave it, but let this die and solve bigger problems next time. 
Chris Nicholson grad student off campus Nov. 3 

We are ND: grad/undergrad relations 
When it comes to debating away game ticket lotteries, must students are forgetting one thing: We are ND. That means, no matter what program we are in or what degree we gradu­ate with, we are all part of an institution that has a tradition of making every student feel welcome and a part of the Notre Dame Family. 
We did this in the early 1900s by disrupting meetings of the KKK in nearby communities (which, incidentally, helped us earn the nick­name "The Fighting Irish"). In the 1970s, we continued this by becoming one of America's first co-ed Catholic Colleges. And, in 1989, when Zhengde Wang (a graduate student) was paralyzed in a senseless hit and run, we formed "The Shirt" to raise money for his ris­ing medical costs. 
We have never been like any other college in America -we have always been better. We have always been more welcoming. We have always been more generous. We have always been more inclusive. We have always seen past age, sex, race, religion, and university degree. We are -and have always been ­ND. Don't let this issue break that tradition. 
Shawn Ahmed grad student off campus Nov. 3 

Respect, not generalize 
I want to make a comment regarding your opinion of graduate students at Notre Dame. I believe your com­ments to be misdirected and instead of trying to include and respect all students on campus as you are taught to do, you are trying to create a division. 
How can you say I do not have as much passion as you do because I am a graduate student? You do not know me; you do not know what I had to go through in order to get here. Where were you when our team was losing to Michigan in the fourth quar­ter? I was still in the stands cheering our team on, while I saw many of the under­
graduate students leaving. 
I have an incredible pas­sion for this school and I · have had to drop everything in my life to come here. I do not regret this decision because it is the only place I have ever been that makes me feel like I am at home, that I belong here. I under­stand the passion, the sor­rows, the joys, the sweat and tears, and courage that have gone into making Notre Dame the greatest university in the world. It is by courage alone that I am here -if it were not for a priest who had the courage to follow the life God created for him, and then help others including myself to find that courage, I would not be here today. I could never fully describe in words how deep my passion runs for Notre Dame, but understand that it is there. 
I truly believe that we are all here for a greater pur­pose than attending school, so remember you did not choose Notre Dame, She chose you. She chose you because She knew you would go out into the world and have the courage to stand up for what is right. Please do not let her down while you are here.

Director Tony Bill returns for film screening 
Notre Dame alumnus presents latest project 'Flyboys,' reflects on career in industry 


Tony Bill, left, and Digger Phelps converse at a gathering before the screening of "Fiyboys." Bill graduated In 1962 and won an Oscar In 1973. 
By BRIAN DOXTADER 
Scene Editor 

Academy Award winner and Notre Dame graduate Tony Bill came back to his alma mater this weekend to screen his latest directorial effort "Flyboys." Bill has worked as an actor, director and producer over a four-decade career. His first major acting role was in the 1963 Frank Sinatra film "Come Blow Your Horn." After acting in sever­al films, he switched to producing, and in 1973 produced the Robert Redford­Paul Newman classic "The Sting," for which he won an Oscar. 
Bill graduated from Notre Dame in 1962, majoring in Art and English, and originally planned to be an actor. His first taste of acting was at Saint Mary's College, where he performed in several shows. As his career progressed, he moved away from acting (whieh he calls "easy") into directing (which he calls "challenging") and producing. He had a major success early in 1973's "The 
Sting," which remains  a  classic of  
American cinema.  
"The Sting" began life  as a  screen­ 

play, whieh was pitched by UCLA grad­uate David S. Ward. Ward wrote an excellent script (for which he would later win the Best Original Screenplay Oscarl. which Bill agreed to fund and help make, with the effort of fellow pro­ducers Julia and Michael Philips. He hired director George Roy Hill ("Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," also starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford), which in turn brought Robert Redford onboard in the starring role. Newman requested to be in the film, which required rewrites, since "The Sting" was written for a child, rather than an older man manifested in Newman.

"The film industry is, in a lot of ways, a game of chance," said Bill. "If you're lucky enough to get a good hand, and you're lucky or skillful enough to stick with it, you can succeed."

the long run. character-oriented 
"The Oscar had no effect on my career," said Bill. "At least, it didn't feel like it did." 
However, Bill said that the success of "The Sting" did not, for the most part, surprise him. 
"When we were making the film, we had no idea that it was going to be such a big critical and commercial hit," Bill said. "You can't think about that stuff. But when we were sitting in the award ceremony and it had already won six awards, we thought, 'yeah, it has a pretty good shot at winning.' But you never know, there was a one in five chante." 
Bill likened the film industry to gam­
approach. 
Bill's latest project, the dog-fighting period piece "Flyboys," combined two of the director's passions -aviation (he is a life-long pilot) and filmmaking. 
Though the film met with commercial failure, Bill takes comfort in some of the positive critical responses, and hopes for a better reception in the for­eign markets. He also noted that the film's financial failure was disappoint­ing, but his directorial work was gener­ally praised, which alleviates some of the apprehensions about future proj­ects. For instance, Bill sent a copy of "Flyboys" to Tom Cruise, who requested to see it and reportedly loved the film. 
What makes "Flyboys" particularly unique is that it was made outside of the studio system, and was thus com­pletely independently funded. Bill is inclined toward what he calls "the smaller film," and while he admits that "nobody wants to [work withiil the stu­dio system]," he has often done it with positive results, among them "My Bodyguard" and "The Sting." 
Of all the aspects of filmmaking that Bill has participated in, he noted that he enjoys directing the most. 
"Directing is the most challenging, and therefore the most rewarding," said Bill. 
At a master class session, Bill dis­cussed his Notre Dame education, but was dismissive of film school as a nec­essary way to enter the industry. 
"It doesn't matter where you go to school, and that's not the point of edu­cation," said Bill, who believes that education is about broadening the mind, rather than trying to break into a particular industry. 
Although Bill does not know what his next project will be, he hopes to direct another film and is searching for the right script. Whatever he chooses, his history of critical acclaim will ensure his credibility and talent, whether or not his project is the next "The Sting."

No Carolina blues 
Notre Dame tops North Carolina, but Tar Heels keep Irish on their toes 
By KEN FOWLER Sporrs Ediror 
No. 11 Notrfl Dame had both 
highs and lows Saturday, but 
the explosive Irish offense was 
too much for struggling North 
Carolina. 
Notre Dame quarterback 
Brady Quinn was 23-of-35 for 
346 yards. passing with four 
touchdowns and no intercep­
tions as the Irish securfld a 45­
26 victory at Notre Dame 
Stadium. He compiled most of 
his stats early, with 148 yards 
and two touchdowns coming in 
the first quarter as coach 
Charlie Wefs had the Irish 
operate out of the no-huddle 
ofl'ense for most of the period. 
"I said all week that I was 
trying to control the tempo of 
the game, and we came out of 
the no huddle and [Quinn] exe­
cuted very well," Weis said. 
"Those four touchdown passes, 
no interceptions, that's usually 
a pretty good day at the 
office." 
Behind the steady play of Quinn, Notre Damp, took a 31­13 lead into the half. Halfway through the third quarter, the Tar Heels cut their deficit to 38-26 on a 72-yard pass from North Carolina quarterback Joe Dailey to freshman wide out Hakeem Nicks. 
But there would be no Tar 
Heel upset in South Bend. 
The Irish defense clamped down, and North Carolina gained just 32 yards of offense in the final 22 minutes of the contest. 
"I thought the defense came out and set the tempo of the game," Weis said. "We got after them pretty good. I think that third quarter, giving a couple big plays up, that didn't exactly lift my spirits, but I did like how hard they played." 
And with the way Quinn played, the Irish defense had room to bend. 
Notre Dame found the end zone early, scoring on its open­ing drive. Utilizing the no-hud­dle offense that has brought the Irish so much success this season, the senior quarterback directed a six-play, 65-yard drive in just 2:03. lie hit Irish wide out Samardzija over the middle for a 37-yard gain to the North Carolina 7 and two plays later found Irish wide receiver Rhema McKnight on a quick out for the score. 
Samardzija finished with 177 yards on six catches, and McKnight added 56 yards and two touchdowns on six catches of his own. 

"I think North Carolina tried to get a lot of guys in the box and make us one-dimension­al," Quinn said. "But if they want to play that game, we're willing to play it as well." 
Tar Heels linebacker Durell Mapp, Jr., said Notre Dame's personnel weren't as good as the Irish scheme. 
"Brady Quinn is a good quar­terback, but 
"I gave [the defender] a small, little move, and I guess he bit on it, and ended up slip­ping, too," McKnight said. "I just came wide open, Brady found me, and I got in the end zone." 
Quinn's second touchdown toss of the first quarter came with 1:47 lPft in the period. Quinn capped a 10-play, 74­yard drive with an 11-yard 
touchdown

for the Irish. After Notre Dame 
took its early 7-0 lead, the Tar 
Heels showed they would not 
go down easy. 
The Tar Heels lone offensive touchdown of the first half came on their second posses­sion. Starting from its own 20, North Carolina took chunks of yardage against the Irish at a time. Tar Heels running back Ronnie McGill had runs of 11 and 35 yards on the drive, and Dailey found Jesse llolley in the near left corner of the end zone for a 12-yard scor.e. 
"There was a lot of passion out there today," Dailey said. "However, once again we beat ourselves and Notre Dame did­n't beat us. We were confident in attacking them today, but we didn't make enough plays on both sides of the ball." 
North Carolina's only other score in the first 30 minutes came after Carl Gioia's 27-yard field goal put the Irish up 24-7. Tar Heels kickoff return spe­cialist Brandon Tate took Hyan Burkart's ensuing kickoff 90 yards for a touchdown, break­ing tackle attempts by Irish defensive lineman Casey Cullen and cornerback Terrail Lambert in the process. 
The Tar Heels had an easier time getting their offensfl going in the second half. 
North Carolina went 83 yards on 10 plays on the first drive out of the locker room. Dailey hit wide receiver Hakeem Nicks for a key 42-yard gain 
during thfl drive, and Dailey 
found Nicks again for a 13­
yard touchdown on a fade 
route to put it in for the Tar 
Heels. 
Hicks finished with six catch­
es for 171 yards. inducting five 
for 150 in the third quartflr 
alone. 
"[Hicks isl a freshman player 
that we knflw coming in had an 
opportunity to be a really, real­
ly good player, not only as a 
freshman who will really 
develop into a great player 
over time." Tar Heels coach 
John Bunting said. "He's got a 
tremendous work ethic in my 
opinion and ... hfl has a war­
rior mentality, which is what 
you ne~d to be a good football 
player. 
But Notre Dame responded 
quickly. Irish receiver David 
Grimes returned the ensuing 
kickoff 20 yards to the North 
Carolina 43, and three plays 
later Samardzija hauled in a 
lofted pass from Quinn on the 
goal line. The 6-foot-5 receiver 
fell into the end zone as the 
Irish staked a38-19 lead with 
8:10 left in the third quarter. 
The touchdown reception gave Samardzija 23 for his career -all in the last two seasons -to pass former Irish wide out Derrick Mayes' for the program record. 
If Notre Dame's answer was quick, North Carolina's was brutally efficient. Dailey was flushed out of the pocket on first down and found Nicks again, this timfl for a 72-yard touchdown pass. With that, the Tar lJp,els cut the Irish lead to 38-26. 
"Big players step up in big time games," Nicks said. "I felt like they weren't respecting me becausp, I was a freshman, so I wanted to make a big impact." 
Irish safety and punt return­er Tom Zbikowski gave the Irish a 31-13 lead with 2:54 left in the first half on a 52­yard punt return score. 
Notre Dame brought 10 men to the line of scrimmage as North Carolina punter David Wooldridge set to kick from thfl back of his own end zone. Zbikowski caught the ball with more than 10 yards of open space, used a block and darted up the middle to the end zone. 
Irish running back Darius Walker scored on 1-yard run with 11:13 left in the fourth quarter to give Notre Damfl the decisive 45-26 lead.

Sports Editor 

In seven of the team's nine games this year, Quinn hasn't thrown an interception. After Saturday's 45-26 win, he has 25 touchdowns against just four picks. 
He's seventh in Division I-A for both total passing yards and pass­ing yards per game. He's also eighth in total offense, despite com­piling a season net rushing yardage of -37. 
It's easy to forget how much rests on Quinn's shoulders. Weis went into Saturday's game with a gun­slinging mentality -to get ahead quickly by throwing a few touch­downs and control the tempo of the game from there. 
That's all well and good, but it means that a quarterback has to be nearly flawless from the moment he steps onto the turf. 
The two-minute offense gives Notre Dame an edge as the team tries for an early lead. But that puts even more pressure on a quarter­back-to make good decisions and to make them quickly. 
One slip-up. and instead of gun­ning for the lead you're digging yourself out of a hole -see the end result of the Michigan game on Sept. 16. 
But Quinn has been masterful out of the gate this season, particularly recently. Against Navy t\'10 weeks ago and North Carolina last week, he started out games with almost inhuman efficiency -scoring on six of the first seven possessions against Navy and four out of the first five against the Tar Heels. 
Most of the offensive production seems to come when Quinn is throwing the ball. Part of that is having talented receivers like Jeff Samardzija, Rhema McKnight and David Grimes. 
Part of it is having John Carlson, a big tight end who's a formidable target across the middle. 
Part of it is Darius Walker's pass­catching ability, enabling Quinn and Weis to keep drives alive with screens and draws. 
But Quinn consistently puts these receivers in a position to make a big play. Sure, Samardzija's height doesn't hurt Quinn's stats. Carlson is a tough matchup for any line­backer. But Quinn gets the ball there, and that's what he did against the Tar Heels. 
And that's why the Irish are 8-1. 
Quinn's a perfectionist, and he isn't satisfied with his performance against North Carolina either. 
"I was hoping to have a little bit better day at the office, if you want to put it that way," he said Saturday night.

Under that kind of pressure, he's performed admirably. Against Michigan State, Quinn lifted the team on his shoulders and carried it as far as he could, putting Terrail Lambert in the position to ice the game with an interception returned for a touchdown. 
Against Georgia Tech, he played a good defense in a hostile stadium with the calm and poise of an elite quarterback, which he is. 
No one does more for his team than Quinn does. He might not be perfect. Every spiral doesn't lead the receivers. He overthrows in the end zone. No one is more aware of Quinn's shortcomings than Quinn himself. 
But every time Quinn gets hit, the Irish season is on the line. Evan Sharpley is 1-of-2 in passing this season with seven yards, and Samardzija is 0-of-2. The running game isn't going to carry Notre Dame past Air Force next week.

Inside pressure -wreaks havoc on Tar Heels 
Irish seniors Landri, Laws combine for 2 blocked PATs

Sports Editor· 
Irish senior Jeff Samardzija set the program record for career touchdown receptions Saturday with his 23rd scor­ing catch. 
Samardzija grabbed a 42­yard pass from Irish quarter­back Brady Quinn with 8:10 left in the third quarter to set the record, previously held by former Notre Dame wide out Derriek Mayes. The play gave the Irish a 38-19 lead over North Carolina. 
"It was just another touch­down out there, but I'm sure down the road it will be a cool thing to look back on," Samardzija said. ''I'm just happy that it was a big touch­down the game that really pulled us away.... I hope someone breaks it sometime soon." 
All of Samardzija's touch­downs have come in the past two seasons. The 2005 con­sensus All-American started just one game -the 2004 Insight Bowl -and had only 24 reeeptions before his jun­ior season. lie has 136 in Notre Dame's last 21 games. Samardzija had 15 touch­downs last season as he replaced an injured Rhema McKnight in the team's start­ing lineup. 
"There's a guy, a perfect example of a guy who is mak­ing the most of the opportuni­ty when it's presenting itself," Irish coach Charlie Weis said. "He's running with it. He's putting himself in a position to not only have a great career at this level but ~o on and have a great one at the next level." 
With two receiving touch­downs Saturday, McKnight tied former teammate Maurice Stovall for fourth on Notre Dame's all-time list at 18. 
Defenses can't stop Quinn 
Quinn extended his sehool­record streak of pass attempts without an interception to 204 Saturday. His last interception came in the second quartPr of Notre Dame's 40-37 win over Michigan State Sept. 23 when Spartans defensive end Ervin Baldwin ran 19 yards for a touchdown on Quinn's errant pass. 
"Brady Quinn is a hell of a player," Tar Heels coach John Bunting said. "I knew that eoming in. They do a terrific job." 
With his four touehdown throws, Quinn moved into 16th place all-time in NCAA with 83 touchdown scores for his career. His single-season high of 346 passing yards give him 10,915 for his career, which is good for 20th in Division 1-A history. 
Third quarter was Nicks' time 
Tar Heels freshman wide receiver Hakeem Nicks' 171 receiving yards marked the second time this year an Irish opponent recorded more than 150 yards receiving. Hicks had five catches for 150 yards in the third quarter, and his only other reception was a 21-yard catch in the first quarter. 
Weis declined to comment on Nicks' play. 
''I'm not talking about their players," Weis said. ''I'm talk­ing about our players. You ask them about their players." 
Purdue sophomore wide receiver Selwyn I.ymon had eight catehes for 238 yards in the Boilermakers' 35-21 loss to Notre Dame Sept. :30. 
Zibby closes In on Rossum 
Irish senior safety and punt returner Tom Zbikowski's 53­yard punt return fqr a touch­down in the second quarter was his seventh return touch­down. 
"Once I made those first two guys miss, it was all green grass ahead," Zbikowski said. 
Zbikowski has three punt returns, two fumble returns and two interception returns for scores. 
He is now two return touch­downs away from former Irish cornerback Allen Hossum's NCAA record in the category. 
Big plays hurt the Irish 
The Tar Heels managed just 244 yards of offense on 49 plays, but 221 of those yards came on just eight plays. North Carolina had three runs of 10 yards or more and three passes of 20 yards or more, which fall into Weis' category off ~'big plays." 
The Irish also surrf'ndered a 90-yard kickoff return for a touchdown -the first time a Notre Dame opponent has scored on a kickoff since DeAndrea Cobb of Michigan State took one baek 89 yards against the Irish in 2004. 
Weis said he wasn't happy about the amount of large gains Notre Dame gave up but also mentioned that several players on both teams slipped at times, which helped create some openings for receivers. 
"For you to have to have a good game, [opponent's big plays! have to be at a mini­mum because if not then you really haven't achieved your goals," Weis said.

No PowDER 
PUFF 
The matchup with Notre Dame was North Carolina's bowl game, and the lowly Tar Heels played with that mentality. After falling behind early, they tied the score within seven minutes. After entering the locker room down 31-13, they came right back and scored on the opening possession of the second half. But the Irish offense was just too· explosive and too precise for the vulnerable North Carolina defense to contain. And any hope for a major upset faded in the dimming South Bend twilight.

Celebrity friendships are not wishful thinking 
I'm prone to judging the worth of a celebrity on one factor alone ­whether I want to be friends with him or her. Since I don't want to be friends with Lindsay Lohan, her celebrity is inconsequential to me. 
However, I would love to be friends with Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson. Therefore, I greatly value this Hollywood super-couple -even though I secretly want Tom Hanks to myself. 
I can imagine the three of us eating together at a bar and grill, catching the latest Spielberg and making each other laugh. Oh, how we would laugh! Slowly, I would steal Tom away and he would ask me to host "Saturday Night Live" with him. Lorne Michaels would be so impressed with my stint that he would hire me as a regular and I would single­handedly save the show from unfunni­ness. It would be quite glorious. 
But if I may be serious, there are quite a few other celebrities that I would love to befriend for one reason or another. Perhaps I want to be friends with these people because they are the anti-Lohan. They do not seek out fame by scandalizing their image, but rather through their body of work. And they seem down-to-earth and totally for real in all their interviews. They must be legit. The following are the celebrities I

most desire to be BFFs with, but trust 
me, there are more. 

Allison Janney. Janney portrayed my beloved Claudia Jean in "The West Wing" and a deliciously trashy woman in "Drop Dead Gorgeous." She's won Emmys for her drama, but her comedy is top-notch. She has an infectious laugh, she rocks a green gown just as much as Mariska Ilargitay, and she's friends with Ellen. The three of us could have crazy cool dance parties at all hours of the day and re-enact scenes from "Finding Nemo" just for kicks. 
Jenna Fischer. Who could not be obsessed with Fischer's Pam on "The Office?" Pam is sweet and funny, and as far as I can tell, so is Fischer. How do I know? Because the only reason I joined MySpace was to add her as a friend and read her blogs. Fischer has a unique relationship with her fans since she is so involved in her MySpace. She also wrote, starred in and directed a mockumentary called "LolliLove." I want to write, star in and direct a mockumentary called something else. And if we did become BFFs, she could introduce me to John Krasinski, and I could stop stalking Tom Hanks. 
Kate Winslet. After seeing her in that American Express commercial, I've had the strangest desire to go flea market shopping with her. Winslet is one of those rare actresses who carefully chooses film roles and makes sure they won't embarrass her later. At 31, she's already accumulated four Academy Award nominations. I desire to be her friend not only because I respect her talent but also because she can be the friend that brings a little culture to my life. 

Maybe she'll introduce me to Thai food or we can take in a ballet. Afterwards, we can rent a good British comedy and I can help her choose movie scripts that will further empower her as an actress and maybe finally snag her that Oscar. As a thank you, she will introduce me to Colin Firth, and I can die a little bit happier. 
I desperately want to be friends with these people, but for now, I'll have to find empty replacements for them in my own life. Janney, Fischer and Winslet are among my favorite celebrities because I feel that friendship with them is not entirely impossible. Call me a creeper or call me a dreamer. I like to call me a creeper. But I'll have the last laugh when the four of us are playing Mall Madness and prank calling old grade school teachers. Maybe there will even be ice cream.

DVD REVIEW 
'Nacho Libre 'fails to satiate comedic appetites 
By SEAN SWEANY Asistant Scene Editor 
Jack Black. The director of "Napoleon Dynamite." So read the promotional posters for this past summer's hopefully­hit comedy "Nacho Libre." It seemed certain that the pairing of this comedic duo would mean major box office suc­cess, especially with previews showing a mustached Jack Black wearing spandex and a cape crooning, "Nachooooooooo" to a group of Mexican school children. 
Unfortunately, "Nacho Libre," now out on DVD, did not live up to these expecta­tions and died a quick death in theaters shortly after its release. In spite of a major marketing campaign for the Paramount IND. expect the disc to fade quickly from the spotlight and be on sale for less than $10 fairly soon. 
"Nacho Libre" stars Black ("School of Hock") as Nacho, a young man raised in a monastery in Mexico who goes on to work there as a eook. Inspired by a zeal for wrestling, he dons a mask and tights to compete as a Luchador, or Mexican wrestler, in a tournament in order to win money for the children in his monastery. 
Nacho teams with a street urchin named Esqueleto (Hector Jimenez) to win the money while he personally tries to win the favor of Sister Encarnacion (Ana de Ia Reguera). The rest of the film follows the exploits of the two wrestlers towards their goals in a fashion much like that of "Napoleon Dynamite." 
Much of the problem with "Nacho Libre" stems from its similarity to Hess's first film. "Napoleon Dynamite" achieved its great success because John Heder was. the perfect actor to play Napoleon. Hess tries to use Jack Black in the same way, but Black is a different type of actor. 
Black's fame stems from his band, Tenacious D. and his ability to use "in­your-face" humor with perfect timing and effect. Trying to get Black to try the more subtle, off-beat humor found in "Napoleon Dynamitfl" works only so far. Several moments are quitfl funny, but Black shows much of his true, brazen 
self here, unlike in 

the rest of the movie. 
Black's talent is clear, but the writ­ing does not allow him to fully utilize his comedic ability in the film. Ana de Ia Reguera and· Hector Jimenez dis­play some talent here, but they are very young actors who cannot yet hold their own in a major motion picture. 

Another problem with "Nacho Libre'' lies in the fact that Nirkf'lodeon Films played a major role in its development, production and promotion. Typically known as a child-oriented film company, this moniker may have prevented cre­ative decisions from being made that could have aided the comedy with more adult humor. As it turned out. "Nacho Libre" struggled to find an audience with both children and adults. By doing so, it did not live up to expectations at the box oflice. 
The DVD features a sparse collection of extras mostly trying to use Jack Black as a vehicle for humor. Some. including a spot whern Jack Black sings songs from the f1lrn and a funny commercial for Naeho I.ibrn action figures, are enjoyable, but most are a waste of time. 
In trying to make another cult classic movie with a bigger budget and bigger stars, Jared Hess missed the mark. What resulted from a movie with mueh poten­tial for hilarity was a boring piece that, like a bad joke, tried too hard to bP funny and fell flat on its face.

FOXBOHOUGH, Mass.­Peyton Manning got help from an unlikely source ­his defense -and the Colts remained the NFL's only unbeaten team. 
The Patriots also were victimized for the first time by Adam Vinatieri as Indianapolis won 27-20 Sunday night. With his once adoring fans booing, he kicked two field goals in his first game against New England since leav­ing as a free agent. 
But he also missed twicP in the second half. 
A steady Manning kept the crowd quiet for most of the game and threw for 326 yards and two touch­downs. The Colts, who began the game with five interceptions in seven games, intercepted Tom Brady four times. They allowed no touchdown passes, only two scoring runs by Corey Dillon and two field goals by rookie Stephen Gostkowski. 
Gostkowski replaced Vinatieri, the longtime Patriots kicker whose field goals in the final sec­onds won two Super Bowls.

Pine Island's fatal bmakdown and Fleet Indian's injury in the Distaff showed the sad side of racing -the second time a premier race has been marred this year. The other, of course, was Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro's devastating misstep at the start of the Preakness.

four-game winning streak and dropped a second straight to Indianapolis after winning six in a row. 
The Colts became the only team to start consec­utive seasons at 8-0 since the Green Bay Packers did it three straight years from 1929-31. And for the first time in his brilliant career, Manning has thrown for 300 yards in three consecutive games. 
The Patriots had one last chance after Vinatieri missed from 37 yards with 1:55 left. But on the Patriots' second play, Brady was intercepted one last time by Cato June 
For the first time in six games, the Colts never trailed as Manning threw the first of his two touch­down passes to Marvin Harrison, a 5-yarder, on their opening possession. Harrison finished with eight catches for 145 yards, just 56 yards fewer than Brady's total of 201 yards passing. 
The Colts began the day tied for 21st in points allowed. But the first sign the defense would be a positive factor came when Antoine Bethea ended the Patriots' first drive with an interception in the end zone. Manning, now 4-10 against the Patriots, then drove the Colts 68 yards to his first scoring pass to Harrison.

Most of the action was well behind him, where Jimmie Johnson quietly grabbed away the point lead from Matt Kenseth by 17 points with a sec­ond-place-place finish. Stewart easily raced away to his second straight win. 
TOP FLIGHT AUTO RACING 
Goodwin charged with racecar driver's death 
Trial set to begin today, 18 years after Mickey Thompson's murder 
Associated Press 

PASADENA, Calif. -The 
1988 murder of racing legend 
Mickey Thompson and his wife 
may be the ultimate cold case, 
having remained unsolved for 
nearly 19 years. 
But Thompson's sister would­n't let it drop ofT investigators' radar and the case, which involves the glamorous world of top flight auto racing and a daredevil driver allegedly caught in a feud over money, will finally come to trial on Monday. 
Michael Frank Goodwin, 
Thompson's estranged business 
partner., is accused of killing 
the racing superstar and his 
wife, Trudy. 
"This has been a long endurance race for justice." Thompson's sister, Colleen Campbell, said recently. "We don't plan to drop out till we get to the finish line." 
Goodwin, 61, is charged with two counts of murder with the special circumstances of lying in wait and committing multi­ple murders. Prosecutors, how­ever, have decided not to seek the death penalty. 
His lawyer maintains there is no physical evidence or witness putting Goodwin at the crime scene or linking him to arrang­ing the killings of the Thompsons. 
"We've always maintained this case is based on baseless suspicion," said defense attor­ney Elena Saris. "The whole defense team feels that if the jury is allowed to hear the truth, Michael will be acquit­ted." 
But prosecutors contend cir­cumstantial evidence leads directly to the former concert promoter, who merged his motocross racing business with Thompson's before the pair had a bitter falling out. They say Goodwin became so consumed with anger after losing a $750,000 judgment to Thompson that he set out to kill him. 
The racer, who was 59 when he died, was inducted posthu­mously into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 1990. He set hundreds of speed and endurance records and was the first person to travel more than 400 mph on land. He also built and drove racing's first slingshot dragster. 
He and his 41-year-old wife were leaving for work in March 1988 when they were ambushed outside their home in the gated Los Angeles sub­urb of Bradbury. 
The two men who shot the couple before fleeing on bicy­cles were never caught, and prosecutors are expected to argue they were hired by Goodwin. 
Authorities say the former promoter had talked of killing Thompson rather than pay him the court judgment Thompson had won. 
At a preliminary hearing three years ago, Gregory Keay said Goodwin, his cousin, told him that before Thompson could collect his money he would "have him wasted."

Scott gets first PGA victory 

Australian moves to third on money list at Tour Championship 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA Moving his potential closer to promise, Adam Scott had his best year in golf. He wound up third on the PGA Tour money list, and can move as high as No. 3 in the world ranking over the next two months. 
None of that would have mat­tered without a PGA Tour victo­ry. 
Scott took care of that miss­ing piece Sunday in the Tour Championship by holding off every challenge that came his way, closing with a 4-under 66 to win the season finale by three shots over Jim Furyk. 
"You can't be that (No.) 3 or 4 player in the world without winning tournaments," Scott

said. "That shouldn't happen. I feel more comfortable in that position seeing I've won an event." 
He won convincingly at the PGA Tour's version of an All­Star game. 
Staked to a three-shot lead on a cool, colorful afternoon of autumn at East Lake, he sank a slick. 15-foot birdie putt on No. 3 to turn back an early threat from Vijay Singh. When he saw Furyk and Joe Durant make a move, Scott responded with three birdies in a four-hole stretch around the turn. 
For good measure, he turned bogey into birdie by holing a bunker shot on the 13th. 
"That was a chance for us to piek up a shot, and we ended up losing a shot," Furyk said. "A guy gets a three-or four­shot lead and he keeps making birdies, he's tough to catch." 
Scott finished at 11-under 269 and earned $1.17 million to finish his PGA Tour season with nearly $5 million. With tournaments coming up in Australia, he will have a chance to surpass Phil Mickelson at No. 3 in the world ranking by the end of the year. 
Furyk shot a 65 to match low round of the week, but never got closer than two strokes and trailed by as many as five on the back nine. 
He played bogey-free golf over his final 31 holes, and it was meaningful. Furyk cap­tured the Vardon Trophy for the first time with the lowest adjusted scoring average on tour at 68.86. 
Scott was second at 68.95. 

Tiger Woods had the lowest average (68.11). but failed to play the required 60 rounds. Woods skipped the Tour Championship for the first time, although he still would have come up one round short even if he had played. 
''I'm wondering if anyone is going to put an asterisk on it because Tiger didn't play 
enough rounds," Furyk said. 
"But it's a nice honor. It's icing 
on the cake for a good year and 
a consistent year." 
Durant closed with a 67 to 

finish third at 273 and end his 
season with a stunning turn­
around. He was worried about 
keeping his card three months 
ago, then finished the year with 
five straight top-1 0 finishes, 
including a victory at Disney. 
He wound up 13th on the 
money list, making him eligible 
for all four majors next year. 
Those con;;olation prizes 

were the best anyone could 
hope for. 
"We just couldn't get any­

where near him, really," Durant 
said. 
Scott has been regarded as one of the game's best young players since he turned pro at age 19, but he had stretches where he vanished. His goal this year was to be more con­sistent, and he couldn't argue with the results. He had nine top 1Os -six of those finishes no worse than third -coming into the Tour Championship. 
After missing the cut last week at Innisbrook, he fixed his flaws on the range this week with coach Butch Harmon, then ran away from the 27-man field at the Tour Championship. 
It was his fourth career PGA Tour victory, and it earned him the last spot at Kapalua for the winners-only Mercedes-Benz Championship that starts the 2007 season in 61 days. 
"It's been a long time since I've been here, winning on the PGA Tour," Scott said. "I had to work hard for it.·· 
The next step is contending in the majors, and eventually moving closer to Woods. 
"It might take awhile," Scott said. "But I think if I was to be No. 1 in the world at some point in my career, then I think that would be maybe the best achievement I could ever do in golf, to get past Tiger Woods." 
Scott's performance was so strong that hundreds of fans headed for the parking lot when he made the turn with a three-shot lead, and no one got any closer the rest of the way. 
But there were plenty of peo­ple left to rock East Lake with cheers when Scott holed his bunker shot on the 13th hole, sending a message down the 14th fairway that Furyk and Durant could not ignore.

Paterno fractures leg during game 
Nittany Lions coach may need surgery to expedite recovery 
Associated Press 
STATE COLLEGE, Pa. -Joe Paterno isn't going to let a broken leg keep him from coaching his team again. 
The 79-year-old Penn State coach broke his left leg and damaged a knee ligament when two players ran into him during the Nittany Lions' loss to Wisconsin, and team offi­cials said Sunday that surgery was being considered. 
Paterno's son and quarter­backs coach, Jay, said he spoke with his father Sunday and there was "no thought whatsoever of not coming back this year.... It's not even in the discussion. There's nothing more to read into this in terms of his career." 
Paterno fractured the top of his tibia, or shin bone, on Saturday, according to team doctor Wayne Sebastianelli. The injury typ­ically heals on 
his team from the coach's box 
above the stands. 
Fans hoped for the best. A statue of Paterno outside Beaver Stadium had a band­age wrapped around his left leg, and one fan left a sign that read, "Get well soon JoePa, we love you!" Former players such as O.J. McDuffie, KiJana Carter and Michael Robinson called or sent mes­sages of concern. 
Paterno's 360 career wins are second among major col­lege coaches to the 364 of Florida State's Bobby Bowden. 
Paterno was knocked to the turf at Camp Randall Stadium in Madison, Wis., when Nittany Lions tight end Andrew Quarless and Wisconsin linebacker DeAndre Levy barreled into him. Quarless had just caught a pass along the sideline early in the second half of the Nittany Lions' 13-3 loss to the Badgers (9-1, 6-1 Big Ten). Penn State (6-4, 4-3) lost to a ranked opponent for the fourth time this season. 
Replays showed Levy collid­
ing helmet-first

said Guido D'Elia, director of communications for foot­ball. 
"He wants to make the quickest fix," D'Elia said. 
Paterno had some ligament damage to the left knee, though the extent was unknown, assistant athletic director Jeff Nelson said. 
Paterno, who turns 80 next month, was trying to maintain his normal routine while working from home Sunday, reviewing tapes, talking to staff by speakerphone and getting ready for the next game at home against Temple. 
"It was a matter of we should have done that, we should have done this," Jay Paterno said. "He had sugges­tions for everybody this morn­ing." 
The elder Paterno is in his 41st year as Penn State head coach and under contract through the end of 2008. Only Amos Alonzo Stagg coached as long with one school, leading the University of Chicago from 1892 to 1932. 
No determination had been made about whether Paterno could return to the sideline for the Temple game or monitor 
bench, where he remained seated most of the third quarter sur­
rounded  by  trainers  and  
police.  
"He's a  wily old rascal,"  

Penn State defensive coordi­nator Tom Bradley, who filled in for Paterno in the second half, said after Saturday's game. "He's not going any­where unless he has to. He's pretty tough." 
Paterno was then carted to the locker room with less than two minutes remaining in the quarter, and flown back to State College on Saturday night ahead of his team. 
It has been a rough season physically for Paterno. 
Paterno hall to leave the sideline in Penn State's game at Ohio State on Sept. 23 after he became ill -the first time he left the field during a game in more than four decades as head coach. 
He returned briefly at half­time. then left again before coming back at the start of the fourth quarter. 
In practice the following week, Paterno was blindsided by two players -one of whom was Quarless -going full­bore for a pass.

Top teatns barely survive sleepers 
Michigan, Ohio State get wake-up call this weekend with close games 
Associated Press 
ANN ARBOR, Mich. -This is why coaches plead with their players to take it one game at a time. 
Ohio State and Michigan near­ly had their perfect seasons ruined Saturday by pair of teams with five combined wins. That huge game Nov. 18 between the Buckeyes and Wolverines almost lost much of its appeal. 
First, No. 2 Michigan with­stood a furious rally by Ball State and hung on for a 34-26 victory at the Big House. Later, No. 1 Ohio State survived a scoreless second half and held on to beat Illinois 17-10, the closest game of the year for the Buckeyes. 
Maybe all that hype is starting to distract the top two teams in the Big Ten and the nation. 
"It's a reality check to all of us," Michigan offensive tackle Jake Long said. "We were close to losing, the closest we've been all year. We all have to refocus." 
Michigan (1 0-0, 6-0) plays at Indiana (5-5, 3-3) next week while Ohio State (10-0, 5-0) trav­els to Northwestern (3-7, 1-5). 
It's a safe bet that both the Buckeyes and Wolverines will take those games more seriously after what happened Saturday. 
"We've got to keep our heads tight and just keep on playing as a team and moving forward," Ohio State wide receiver Ted Ginn Jr. said. "We came out and had a dog fight. We just will come back next week and play hard." 
Michigan made a couple of early mistakes against the Cardinals (3-7), handing the five-touchdown underdogs nine points and the lead. 
Mike Hart's first fumble in two years bounced through the end zone for a safety, Chad Henne threw an interception that was returned for a score and Ball State had a 9-7 lead, just the second deficit for Michigan this season. 
Michigan ·regained control behind a powerful running game and il'> usual swarming defense, going up 31-12 in the third quarter. It looked as if the Wolverines would cruise, but instead they gave up a 54-yard TD pass and a 62­
Ohio State wasn't in quite as much danger as Michigan, but the Buckeyes clearly played their worst half of the season in the final 30 minutes against Illinois (2-8, 1-5). 
Up 17-0 at the break, Ohio State never got its offense going and the Illini took kept plugging away. A field goal with 8:54 left made it 17-3 and Illinois finally got into the end zone with 1:40 left on Rashard Mendenhall's 3­yard run.

With Mountaineers loss, Buckeyes are unanitnous No.1 
Jason Whitlock of Kansas City Star ranks unbeaten Louisville No. 9, but Cardinals move to No. 3 in media poll 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -It's unani­mous. 
Ohio State received all 65 first-place votes in The Associated Press Top 25 released Sunday to beeome the first unanimous No. 1 during the regular season in three years. 
The last team to sweep the media panel voting was Oklahoma on Nov. 30, 2003, the week before the Sooners lost the Big 12 championship game to Kansas State. 
The Buckeyes have been top­ranked all season, and for the fourth straight week their Big Ten rival, Michigan. was No. 2. 
The Buckeyes and Wolverines had closer-than­expected wins Saturday. Ohio State won 17-10 at Illinois and Michigan held off Ball State 34-26. 
Louisville received its best ranking, moving up two spots to No. 3 after its 44-34 victory over West Virginia on Thursday. The Mountaineers had been No. 3, but their first loss of the season dropped them seven spots to No. 10. 
No. 4 Texas was just three points behind unbeaten Louisville. 
The Cardinals were ranked as high as No. 2 by five voters and as low as ninth by Jason Whitlock of the Kansas City Star. 
"After watching the West Virginia-Louisville game Thursday night I was shocked at how poorly the defenses played," Whitlock said inane­mail to the AP on Sunday. "I don't think either one of those teams would survive against the best teams in the SEC. So there are four SEC teams that I think are better than Louisville. I also think Ohio State, Texas, USC and Michigan are better than Louisville." 
Kirk Bohls of the Austin American-Statesman had Louisville No. 2 and said the Cardinals deserve credit for having one of the nation's best offenses. 
"This has got to be one of the most complex voting situa­tions I've seen because people don't know what to make of the Big East," he said. "Style points mean everything this

Three SEC teams start the second 10, with Arkansas, LSU and Tennessee. The Tigers beat the Volunteers 28-24 on Saturday and the Razorbacks host Tennessee this week. 
Unbeaten Boise State was No. 14 and unbeaten Hutgers was 15th. The Scarlet Knights get a chance to make a big leap in the ranking on Thursday night when they host Louisville. 
"If Louisville beats Hutgers by two touchdowns, I might reconsider my position," Whitlock said. 
No. 1-6 was Wisconsin, fol­lowed by Oklahoma and three Atlantic Coast Conference teams -Wake Forest, Georgia Tech and Virginia Tech. 
Oregon is No. 21 with Boston College, Maryland, Texas A&M and BYU rounding out the Top 25. 
Maryland and BYU were in the rankings for the first time this season. The Terps defeat­ed Clemson 13-12 on a last­second field goal to move into the rankings for the first time since the middle of the 2003 season. The loss knocked Clemson out of the rankings for the second time this sea­son. 


Washington State also dropped out of the rankings after being in for just one week. The Cougars lost 2 7-17 at home to Arizona.

But the Cardinals were the big winners this week. Their 44-34 victory over West Virginia, last week's third-place team, gave them the necessary boost to jump over fourth-place Florida.

Team snaps three-game losing streak in D.C. 
Notre Dame picks up wins against Georgetown and South Florida this weekend to improve to 9-3 in the Big East 

By DEVIN PRESTON 
Spons Writer 
The losing is over, as Notre Dame snapped its three-game skid this weekend with two wins over Big East opponents. 
Switching to a 5-l offense, the Irish (15-10) swept Georgetown (8-17, 2-10 Big East) and South Florida (12­13, 7-5 Big East) to advance their conference record to 9-3. 
"It was a really good week­end for us," Irish coach Debbie Brown said. "We felt like we played just a good level of volleyball the entire weekend. It was good to get our feet back under us after last weekend." 
Led by the offensive efforts of sophomores Mallorie Croal and Justine Stremick, the Irish turned around their momen­tum and got in the winning column. 
Notre Dame 3, Georgetown 0 
Croat led the Irish attack with 13 kills at a hitting per­centage of .417 as Notre Dame took the match 30-21, 30-21, 30-14 over Georgetown. 
On the Hoya side, sopho­more Jessica Buffum led with 11 kills, though only muster­ing a hitting percentage of .200. As a team, Notre Dame played against the Bulls only out-hit Georgetown .356 to once before, Brown said they .121. were well prepared for their

Bass still fishing for first -win over Moneke 
OSU freshman takes fourth straight meeting 
By DEIRDRE KRASULA Spons Writer 
To Stephen Bass, it may seem like he will never be able to escape the forehand of Steven Moneke. 
Bass and Ohio State's Moneke last faced off Oct. 23 when Moneke topped the Irish junior 7-6, 3-6, 6-4 in the quarterfinals of the ITA Midwest Regional Championship. The two bat­tled again Sunday in the semi­finals of the ITA National Indoor Championship. 
Bass forced Moneke to pull off a tight win in the first set -Moneke took one set point 5-4 and rallied to win the set 7-5. 
Bass was not able to chal­lenge Moneke as much in the second set as the Buckeyes freshman walked away with 6­3 win and a place in the finals. It marked the fourth straight win that week for the German sophomore. 
Moneke -unranked as of preseason polls -is becoming a trial for anyone who steps on his court. The Buckeye came close to knocking off UCLA's Ben Kohlloeffel -the No. 1 player in the country ­but fell to him 6-3, 3-6, 7 -6(7} in the finals. 
En route to the semifinals, Bass pulled off a shocking upset defeating No. 2 John Isner of Georgia. Bass knocked off Isner in straight sets with a 6-4, 7-6(6) victory. The win placed Bass in the quarterfi­nals against Boise State's Luke Shields. Bass fell 6-1 in the opening set but rallied to post 7 -6(3) and 7 -6(5) tiebreakers. 
Bass' teammate Sheeva Parbhu fell to Old Dominion's Harel Srugo 6-7(8), 6-4, 6-1. Parbhu defeated Jakob Cech of Fresno State 7-5, 7-6 in the first round of the consolation. Georgia's Luis Flores defeated Parbhu 7-5, 5-7, 7-5 in the quarterfinals. 
Parbhu and doubles partner Ryan Keckley lost to San Diego State's Markus Dickhardt and Christian Groh 8-6 in the first round of the tournament. But that did not deter the duo, who went on to knock off three pairs and win the conso­lation final. Parbhu and Keckley defeated William and Mary's Alex Cojanu and Colin O'Brien 8-5 to secure their vic­tory.

After slow start, Irish rebound to drub Northwood 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Sports Writer 

Notre Dame allowed Division­11 Northwood University to take a 16-13 lead 12 minutes into Sunday's game at the Joyce Center, but the Irish exploded for a 9-0 run during the next two minutes and rolled to a 82­35 win. 
"That was a great game for us to be able to be down three in the first half," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. "We haven't had that opportunity yet this year, and I think we handled that really well." 

Irish guard Charel Allen willed her team ahead of Northwood. putting up eight points during Notre Dame's run. 
"(Allen] wanted to be the one to score," McGraw said. "She got some nice looks, she didn't settle for the jumper all the time -she really tried to get an 8-0 run to stretch the lead to inside." 40-21. In the second half, Notre

Late surge earns squad victory 
By CHRIS HINE Sports Writer 
With the scoreboard reading 124-121 in favor of Purdue head­ing into the fmal three events of Friday's meet, the No. 17 ranked Irish men swimmers gathered around the pool for an impromp­tu team meeting. 
"We told each other that this was our moment, our time," sen­ior Ted Brown said. "We knew we had to win those last events if we were going 
ry over No. 18 Purdue -the first victory for the Irish against the Boilermakers since 1966. 
"We have great confidence in one another. This team really showed its competitive edge in that meet," Brown said. "This was [head coach Tim Welsh's] first time beating Purdue, so to come out on top was really spe­cial." 
The first of those last three crucial events was the three­meter dive. Purdue's Steve LoBue, a national qualifier in both the three-meter and one­meter dives, had already cap­tured first in the one-meter earli­er in the meet. 

Notre Dame, however, has a national qualifier of its own ­sophomore Michael Bulfin. Bulfin (with a score of 315.00) edged out LoBue (308. 70) in the three­meter to capture nine crucial points, while junior Sam Stoner captured third (303.22) to give the Irish the lead 133-131.

a 156-144 victo­today, and so did everybody else," Irish associate 

head coach Matt Tallman said. Next up was the 200-yard individual med­ley. Brown touched the wall .66 seconds ahead of Purdue's Romain Marie to give the Irish the 
key victory, while freshman MacKenzie LeBlanc claimed fifth. 
Even though Purdue grabbed second, third and fourth in the event, the scoring went 10-9 in favor of the Irish, preserving their 143-140 lead, heading into the final even of the meet, the 400-yard relay. 
"Going into that next to last event, everything was still up in the air. Ted pulling out that victo­ry in the 200-JM was huge," Tallman said. "It made sure that all we had to do in the 400-relay was win." 
Freshman John Lytle, sopho­more Jeff Wood, freshman Andrew Hoffman and senior Louis Cavadini sealed the victory for the Irish with a 3:03.83 time, two and a half second ahead of Purdue's Craig Thompson, John Schmitt, Tim Watts and Eddie Kenney. 
"I hate losing, but it was a great meet," Purdue coach Dan Ross said. 
Notre Dame claimed first in nine of the meet's 16 events. Other Irish winners included jun­ior Jay Vanden Berg in the 1,000-yard and 500-yard freestyle, Brown in the 200-yard freestyle, Wood in the 100-yard backstroke, Lytle in the 1 00-yard freestyle, and the 400-yard med­ley relay team of Wood, Lytle, senior Tim Kegelman and sopho­more Sam Pendergast. 
"This victory felt good because year in and year out Purdue has a solid team," Tallman said." 
While the victory is nice, Brown said, the Irish have big­ger goals in mind the rest of the season. 
"Our whole focus is to keep training hard, and to be ready to race these dual meets in the beginning of the year," Brown said. "But we also have to make sure we're ready for the Big East meet later in the year."

Barlow did not ha\'e the only great performance for Notre Dame off the bench. Irish sub­stitutes combined for 44 points against Northwood's 14 bench points. Sophomore forward Chandrica Smith (eight points, six rebounds), freshman guard Melissa Lechlitner (eight points) and freshman center Erica Williamson (nine points) were Notre Dame's leading reserves. 
Williamson and junior center Melissa D'Amico provided a great inside presence against the Timberwolves throughout the game. D'Amico added nine points of her own on the post, while helping set up the Irish guards. 
"I thought Mel [D'Amico] just started out the second half real­ly well," McGraw said. "We were more determined to get her the ball, and I think both her and Erica [Williamson] worked well on the post and that's something that we've got

Senior guard Colin Falls and freshman forward Luke Harangody led the IrL'>h in their first exhibition game with 15 and 1 7 points, respectively. Junior forward Rob Kurz added a double-double for Notre Dame, finishing with 11 points and 10 rebounds. 
Brey was especially pleased with the efforts of his junior for­ward. While contributing on the offensive end and being efficient on the boards, Kurz used his superior size against Rockhurst's forwards to estab­lish his position on the block. 
"[Kurz] is a lunch pail, blue collar guy,'' Brey said. "What doesn't show up in the stats is the number of times he gets over and helps out, then gets back to his guy, then gets a rebound." 
Rotating Kurz, Harangody and sophomore forward Luke Zeller through two post posi­tions, the Irish looked quick and athletic on both offense and defense. Brey also used point guards Kyle McAlarney and freshman Tory Jackson in the same backcourt sets. 
"One thing we should be able to do is pressure the ball with Tory and Kyle," Brey said. "That's so important." 
With Brey going to his bench freely throughout the game, players who Notre Dame expects to contribute this sea­son -namely Jackson and Harangody -were able to get their feet wet. 
"I'm excited for Luke 
to have." 

The post play was crucial for the Irish, whose goal in the Northwood game was to rebound more effectively -and they did, 46-28. 
"They were out-rebounding us in the first half and we out­rebounded them 26-8 in the second half," McGraw said. "Those were the most impor­tant numbers we were looking at." 
Overall, McGraw has figured out where her team stands after the preseason and knows what it needs to work on for its first matchup Nov. 10 with a Division-) school -Central Michigan. 
"I think we're where we want to be defensively," she said. "I don't think we're where we want to be offensively yet. We didn't shoot well from the line."

[Harangody] because we need him confident quickly because of what's coming up with our schedule," Brey said. 
Harangody was strong on the offensive end against Rockhurst, showing a willingness to play under the basket and an ability to use his size (6-foot-8, 250 pounds) to get to the rim. 
"We've been playing with him, battling with him all sum­mer and he's gonna be a great player in the Big East," Kurz said after Thursday's game. "We know the good thing is that he's only a freshman, you get better with time, and he's gonna be a big part of our season this year.... He's definitely fearless." 
Against Rockhurst, Notre Dame played a more up-tempo style of its traditional motion offense from last season. The Irish moved the ball quickly during their offensive sets and pressured the ball on defense, which translated to transition opportunities. 
"It's easy to be able to go through the motions, full speed the whole length of the game when you're better condi­tioned," Carter said. "When you're fatigued, that's when you look slow and start to make mental mistakes." 
Bellarmine, a Division-11 uni­versity in Louisville, Ky., beat Indiana-Southeast 84-75 Thursday in its first exhibition game of the season. 
Guard Marcus Flynn led the Knights with 16 points on 6-of­16 shooting (2-of-7 from 3-point range). while adding three assL'>ts and three steals.

In Notre Dame's final tune­up before the NCAA Tournament, they physically dominated Rutgers -often to the audible dismay of scream­ing scarlet supporters. 
Many New Jersey natives looked at Notre Dame's rough­ness (the Irish committed 14 first-half fouls while Rutgers committed five) as if the game were being playing down in Jungleland. 
Wrong Springsteen tune. Because as the game played out, it became clear that "Hungry Heart" was more applicable. 
The truth is, when the team bus took Rutgers out of New Brunswick, it also took the New Brunswick out of Rutgers, as Notre Dame scratched and clawed their way to victory with intensity and willpower unmatched by its opponent. 
"Our energy level was a lot higher," captain and tourna­ment defensive MVP Kim Lorenzen said. "That kind of factors into winning tackles and ultimately getting fouls called." 
All day, the Irish aggressively attacked every loose ball, and left tracks behind them -cut­ting through the Knights' armor like Hanks through the back line. The sophomore sen­sation sparked Notre Dame's engines when she followed up her first score by outrunning one defender and out-willing center back Meghan Ryan to gain possession of the ball before sending it through goal­keeper Erin Guthriel's legs and into the net. No one could blame Guthrie! if she blushed. 
In the end, the four Irish goals were almost half as much as the 10 Rutgers sur­rendered throughout the regu­lar season -not the nationally televised image they wanted to show to the NCAA selection committee as they continued to make their case for a higher Tournament seed. 
Notre Dame's dominance Sunday was aided by the pas­sionate play of Hanks. While her rousing performance before the intermission left lit­tle room for late dramatics, she upstaged herself with some impromptu second-half drama. After Rutgers defender Meghan Ryan's boot high­kicked closer than she appre­ciated, Hanks grabbed her face in seeming anguish, prompting a whistle against the Scarlet Knights. 
"I kind of didn't get kicked in the face," Hanks admitted. "But it was a high kick, and I knew it was, so I just acted 
like I did [get kicked)." 
Thus, after she and her defense were outplayed all day, Meg Ryan was even out­acted. As a well-known jour­nalist ~nee noted: "Burgundy down. 
Hanks, to be sure, had plen­ty of help. From the defense to the midfield, everyone played her role-all Jerry Bruckheimer action scenes, all game long. 
Sunday, Notre Dame played like they had something to prove. And with center defender and Big East defen­sive player of the year Carrie Dew and her torn ACL on the sidelines, they did. 
Not to themselves-after all they have now won eight games this year without her. The NCAA selection commit­tee, however, certainly should have no qualms awarding the Irish the top tournament seed and home field advantage until the Final Four Dec. 1 in Cary, NC. No one else has the fire­power. And as they proved Sunday, no one has a hungrier heart.

The Scarlet Knights (15-3-3) 
came into the title game Sunday 
off an emotional, come-from­
behind 3-2 victory over West 
Virginia in the semifinal Friday. 
Rutgers fell behind 2-0 before 
scoring three unanswered goals to 
win. 

"We thought that coming off of Friday's game there might be a lit­tle letdown, especially if we could jump on them early," Notre Dame coach Randy Waldrum said. 
That's exactly what the Irish 
did. 

Hanks gave Notre Dame a 1-0 lead just 57 seconds into the game. The sophomore took a cen­tering pass from Bock and found the back of the net for the quickest goal in Irish postseason history. 
The Scarlet Knights had a chance to tie a few minutes later when Notre Dame keeper Lauren Karas tried to pick up a ball that had rolled just outside the box and got called for a hand ball. The ensuing free kick was deflected and ended up just wide of the net. The Irish bounced back, however, scoring two minutes after the near miss on another pass from Bock to Hanks. Bock sent a pass down the right sideline and Hanks beat a defender to it and nutmegged Rutgers keeper Erin Guthrie. 
Hanks credited a tactical change by Waldrum with getting her open for the two scores. The Irish looked for more through-balls to create breakaways, rather than slowly building up offensively. 
"We decided to play it through and just be off to the races," Hanks said. "Usually we're a team that likes to pass it around and actually play soccer, but they hun­kered in and we had to change our formation a little." 
After 55 scoreless minutes, Weissenhofer added to the Notre Dame lead. The freshman got the ball at the top of the box, turned and put a shot into the bottom left corner, just out of Guthrie's reach. 
Five minutes later, Notre Dame defender Ashley Jones lofted a pass into the box right onto the head of midfielder Amanda Cinalli. Guthrie dove and tipped Cinalli's header, but the ball hit the inside of the post and went in the net to give the Irish a 4-0 lead. 
Hutgers finally got on the board on a goal by midfielder Gina DeMaio with 15 minutes left in the game. DeMaio fired a shot from outside the box and Karas 
appeared to slow down, thinking 
it was going wide, but the ball 
snuck inside the left post for the 
score. 
Rutgers got its second goal with 
two minutes to play. Lorenzen, the 
onlv Notre Dame starter left in the 
game after Waldrum decided to 
clear his bench, lost the ball trying 
to clear it and Scarlet Knights for­
ward Kim Mineo took it in and 
beat freshman keeper Kelsey 
Lysander, who had replaced 
Karas. 
"It was a total lack of communi­
cation all around," the senior cap­
tain said of the goal. "I was going 
to head it out, but it didn't take a 
big enough bounce, then 
[Lysander and I] looked at each 
other and I thought she was going 
to get it. Then I played it, but it 
went right to one of their girls that 
I didn't know was there. 
"It was a breakdown, but it won't happen again." 
After the goal cut the lead to two, Waldrum put most of the starters back in the game. 
"I wanted to send a message to those kids that when we make changes the level of play has to stay the same," he said. "We'll talk to them about that." 
The game was unusually physi­cal, with 40 combined fouls, and two Rutgers players -midfielders Alicia Hall and Tierney Brady ­suffered serious injuries in the first half. Hall limped off the field after a vicious collision with Cinalli and didn't return. Cinalli was yellow carded on the play. 
"Anyone who knows Amanda Cinalli, knows she wouldn't have purposefully hit somebody," Waldrum said. "She just came in hard for the ball." 
Brady had to be taken off on a stretcher with 18 minutes left in the half and was later airlifted to the hospital after colliding with Irish midfielder Courtney Rosen. No foul was called. 
"They just ran into each other," Waldrum said. "I hope that girl is okay. We didn't feel like we did anything dirty. I know Courtney felt bad, so I talked to her a little bit. She was just playing hard soc­cer." 
The Irish, who are almost assured of a No. 1 seed in the upcoming NCAA Tournament, will find out their first-round opponent today. The game will be played Friday at Alumni Field, with the second round, if necessary, also at home Sunday.

Irish senior goalie Dave Brown stopped 46 shots in the two games, but saw his 
Brown was second in the nation in goals-against aver­age and save percentage, behind Alaska's Chad Johnson. 
Jackson said Brown's domi­nance in net could be attrib­uted to the confidence and maturity that he developed in the latter half of his junior year and carried over into this season. 
"IIis sophomore year had a lot to be desired," Jackson said. "IIis confidence was down. I just think the whole aspe<:t wouldn't have gotten it." 
While honored, Dalby felt that individual awards were more of a reflection on the team's success. 
"I don't think [an award] val­idates whether a player is good or not," Dalby said. "I

As one of the better players on a talented squad, Lapira saw his award as a justifica­tion of the faith his coach has in him. 
"I guess it was kind of spe­cial, because before the season Boss [Clark] had stressed to me how, if I fulfilled my poten­tial this year, I could be the Big East Player of the Year," Lapira said. "I thought it was kind of unrealistic, but it came to fruition and showed how smart Boss [Clark] is." 
The Irish will now await news of where they will play in the NCAA Tournament, which begins Friday. The tournament brackets will be announced today between 4 p.m. and 5 on ESPNNEWS.

Twice is nice over Scarlet Knights 
Hanks' two goals lead Irish to second straight conference crown 
By CHRIS KHOREY Associate Sports Editor 

STORRS, Conn. -Sophomore forward Kerri Hanks scored two goals in the first 10 minutes and Notre Dame hung on at the end to beat Rutgers 4-2 Sunday and claim its ninth Big East Championship at Morrone Field. 
"Our ultimate goal is a nation­al championship, but it's a big deal to win the Big East champi­onship," Irish senior captain Kim Lorenzen said. "Our fresh­man year we didn't win it, so the senior class made it a point to win it each year since then." 
Notre Dame (20-0-1) advanced to the conference fmal with a 2­0 win over Marquette Friday in Storrs, getting goals from sopho­more Brittany Bock and fresh­man Michele Weissenhofer.
