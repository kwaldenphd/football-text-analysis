by Marian Ulicny Staff Reporter 
Student Union's board of direc~ tors met for the first time this year to define its' role in guiding Student Union policy. 
According to the Student Go­vernment constitution, the Student Union board of directors "shall determine the policies of the Stu­dent Union and be responsible for its smooth operation." The board is comprised of Ken Ricci, Student Union director and board chair­man, Walt Ling, associate director, Mary Ann Morgan, comptroller, Mike Gassman, student body presi­dent, Mike Casey, vice-president, Eric Ryan, treasurer and Brother John Benesh, representative of the Office of Student Affairs. 
Student Union officials expres­sed differing opinions concerning the revival of the board and its function. 
Ling stated that the board ''has always been there, just never used. 
The feeling has been that there's no need for its use, not as long as there was constant communication between the Union and Student Government. Because the Student Government board of commis­sioners gives us our money, we are responsible to them." 
According to Ling, communica­
tion between the two organizations 
has decreased. "The Student 
Union director was making· the 
decisions a board was supposed to 
be making," he explained. "This 
was holding loosely to the consti­
tution in the past, but, of course, 
it's very vague." 
Ling stressed the board ''should 
not meet to discuss every little 
policy issue, just define major 
policy such as concert ticket blocks 
for dorms, possible hiring and firing 
of upper Student Union officials, 
and purchasing, rather than rent­
ing, refrigerators used on campus 
as a money-making project for the 
Union." 
In addition, Ling saw an advan­
tage to the board in producing 
group decisions. ''A group can 
easily take in all the facts, give a 
wide range of opinions and vote on 
it. If it doesn't decide, at least it can make recommendations," he added. 
The first goal of the board is ''to look at the constitution and say, 'What exactly are we supposed to be doing?" Ling stated. "We will work to come up with a proposal of what the board of directors should be responsible for. After it is discussed and approved, the Stu­dent Government Board of Com­missioners will form a constitu­tional convention to vote it into the Student Government constitution." 
Ling stated the role of the board of directors should be "more explicit." "It should be responsi­ble for giving the Student Union direction and re-evaluation. It will make it easier on future adminis­trations concerning policy deci­sions." he added. 
According to Ricci, "Nobody knows the exact relation of the board to the Student Union. Up to now, we've been executing what's been in the constitution. It never says, 'Meet.' It doesn't require meetings." 
Leo Garonski, Student Union 
recording secretary, stated the 
board "has never really been 
implemented before, but some 
people feel it's appropriate now. 
Its purpose is never clearly defined 
in the constitution. The language 
is extremely ambiguous." 
Ricci does not view the board as 
a means of decentralization but as 
''tatiq the brunt of decision­
mating higher." I'd see the board 
pointing direction, but others 
would see them playing a more 
active role. That's the point we're 
at now," he explained. 
''The gist is how much power the 
board should have," Garonski 
noted. "That's the conflict. Peoplt 
want the board to review the 
decisions made by the director. 
Some see it more as a decision­
making body rather than setting 
general policies," he added. 
According to Ricci, "We're 
starting from scratch. Even at the 
first meeting we had to begin with 
the preliminaries of how to record 
th,. minutes and vote." 
''Something should be organized, 
he concluded, "In the future, we 
hope to set up some guidelines 
about policy that are not presently 
written down."

There's nothing wrong with a little materialism. 
We'll admit it. One of the selling features of Army ROTC is just plain cold cash ... nearly $2000 during your junior and senior years of college. There's also the opportunity for full-tuition scholarships. And a $10,000 a year salary as an Army officer when you graduate. 
But we've got other good things to offer you, too. College courses which challenge you both mentally and physically. Management training and experi­ence you'll find valuable in civilian as well as military jobs. And instant leadership responsibil­ity in your first job after college. 
Ifany of this interests you,. check out Army ROTC. And even if you enroll just for the money, you'll graduate with something worth a lot more ... gold bars of an Army officer.

In September, 1974. St. Mary's needed additional housing facilities and the college· s seniors wanted additional freedom and responsi­bility. so the north end of Augusta Hall was leased from the Sisters of the Holy Cross and it became an all-senior residence hall. 
Now. two and a half years later, although life in Augusta has be­come more of a small group experience than the originally con­ceived community experience, it has remained a hall where the residents solve their own problems while abiding by all college rules. Residents have their own keys to the dorm's front door and come and go as they please without any hall director or resident advisor super­vision. Visitors must use the phone outside to call their hostess in order to gain entrance to the building. much like and apartment complex. 
Fifty-five students live in Augus­ta at present, but since its opening. the number of residents has ranged from 50 to 62. Two of its current occupants are juniors who were permitted to live there because fewer seniors wished to move to Augusta than in the past. Life there has lost much of its glamor, according to Stevie Wernig, vice president of student affairs. New things are always popular at first, but later. interest in them wanes. she explained. 
There are several disadvantages to living in Augusta Hall. It is

to have replaced. Wernig _added 
that, "Augusta has become a dorm 
of many cliques. Although other 
dorms have the same problem, it is 
much more apparent in a small 
situation like the one at Augusta." 
Although the hall's residents 
admit to some disadvantages, such 
as a limited hall budget and 
substandard kitchen and lounge 
facilities, they seem to feel that 
Augusta's good poi,pts far outweigh 
its bad points. 
According to Augusta's co-chair­men. Liz White and Happy Rey­nolds, who jointly cast the hall's one student assembly vote, it is the huge rooms, senior atmosphere, community spirit, privilege of go­verning themselves and quiet which are the dorm's main attrac­tions. 
Augusta Hall may in the not-too­distant future become a regular dormitorv with a hall director and RA 's, however. due to overcrowd­ing on campus. In fact, St. Mary's administration considered putting a part-time graduate student and a few RA · s in Augusta this year but decided against it. according to Wernig. "Anything is conceivable concerning Augusta. It is an old building. though. and would need to be fixed up quite a bit. Since it is owned by the convent, anv renova­tion would have to be approved by them." she said. In any event Augusta will always ren;ain th~ college's smallest ~esidence hall, she added.

Driver injured 

Shuttlebus collides with truck 
by Paul Hesse Staff Reporter 
A shuttlebus to St. Mary's carrying about 40 Notre Dame and SMC students, collided with a truck in the northbound lane of U.S. 31 on Friday afternoon's 3:30 shuttle run. The driver of the bus, Will A. Surratt, 27 of South Bend was the only person injured in the mishap. 
Surratt was taken to St. Joseph's Hospital and treated for minor injuries, which included a cut forehead and a badly bruised knee. 
"I was sort of towards the rear of the bus, when I heard the driver hit his horn," reported Charlie Weis, a rider on the bus. "I looked up as he slammed on the brakes, and saw this truck coming into the front of the bus. Then glass went flying all over the place, and everyone was sort of panicky. I was worried about the people in the front." he 
said,  "and I  was  afraid  the  bus  
driver  might  be  in  pretty  bad  
shape."  

Others who had been on the bus 
voiced similar views. Pam Iammar­ino. a St. Mary's freshman and a regular on the 3:30 shuttle, was on her way back from a class at Notre Dame. "I kind of got thrown around," she explained, "but I really wasn't too worried about mys~lf." Instead, her first thoughts were also of Surratt. "I had visions of him being crushed or something." she said. "I was really surprised -and really happy ­when I saw that he was all right." 
The damage to the bus was extensive. The front windshield shattered ·almost completely on impact and the instrument panel ended up in the street. St. Mary's senior Mary McMahon recalled, '·All I kept thinking was what would have happened had we been a foot or two farther out into the street. I guess we were really lucky." 
. The driver of the truck was Jerry Glisson, 23. of South Haven, Michigan. He was headed north on Route 31 and. according to wit­nesses.failed to observe· the traffic signal at the intersection of U.S. 31 and St. Mary's gate road. The bus was travelling west and had just entered the intersection when the accident occured. Glisson was uninjured and his truck was virtual­ly undamaged. However, he was cited for negligent driving. 

Traffic on-U.S. 31 was slowed for over an hour. Weis and another bus-rider channelled the north­bound traffic into the left-hand southbound lane. "Then we just directed traffic for a good half hour or so," Weis said, "until the police 
O'Laughlin Auditorium 
got there." 
Weis, Iammarino and McMahon were all somewhat critical of the police response to the accident. "I was surprised how long it took the police and ambulance to arrive." said McMahon. "Thev were kind of slow." Weis was -a bit more outspoken. "You can blame the weather conditions all vou want." he concluded. "but if am·one had been seriouslv hurt. thcv would have been in trouble." ­

Last year I authored :: moder­ately successful column that took a humorous view of life here at Notre Dame. Recently some people have asked why the column has dis­appeared from these pages. I can only presume these inquirers either enjoyed my column or are afflicted with some form of masochism. I have refrained from offering an explanation in print only because I thought it was so obvious. But perhaps an explanation is in order. 
I believe The Observer should concern itself with the serious issues of the day like the food co-op or the bus shuttle and allow a minimal amount of space to frivo­lous endeavors like my columns. And I feel the space allotted for humor in The Observer is being most adequately handled by the pen of "Chip Spina." I must admit I was not one of those who readily appreciated the force of "Spina's" satire, but now I'm one of his biggest fans. And I think you will be too, after I let you in on the joke behind "Chip Spina's" column. 
First of all. there is no real life person called "Chip Spina." Rather. it is a clever pseudonym for an ingenious first-year graduate student named Rufus Willington. Willington does graduate work in philosophy here at the university after previously pursuing his un­dergraduate studies at North­western. In fact. Willington ("Spina") worked as a student manager at Northwestern and is a good friend of football coach Johnny Pont. So now you under­stand that everyone at Northwester realizes when they read a column by "Chip Spina" it's really Rufus Willington pulling their leg again. Why else would The Observer print such classless insults unless they were meant in a spirit of jest? 
But that's just a trivial insight. Let's get to the real essence of "Spina's" humor. 
At the beginning of the year, Willington ("Spina") set. out to satirize. in the sports section, the bench-jock attitude so prominent at Notre Dame. You know who Willington means: the guys who act as if they scored the TD, they intercepted the pass; who act as if they personally received an invita­tion to the Orange Bowl. And how brilliantly "Spina" cultivated this fertile ground for parody. 

For example consider Willing­ton's ("Spina's") remarks after Notre Dame's openning loss to Pittsburgh. 
"At another school. a game such as Saturday's could be shrugged off. But at Notre Dame, football, winning football, seems to be the center around which all else re­volves. It stopped revolving Satur­day. ND no longer has winning football." 
I mean, how funny can you get. What better way to satirize the over-zealous portion of our student body than to put into print what many of them were no doubt thinking. 
Two weeks later the Notre Dame Football team tried to soothe it~ bruised ego by running up the score on an undermanned North­western squad. Willington anger­ily watched as the students from Notre Dame rubbed it in on the despondent Northwestern fans. "How can I capture this brutality in print," Willington thought. He hit upon the idea of insulting the Northwestern team with an as­sortment of "cheap shots" in his column to represent the fanaticism of the Notre Dame fans at the game. He was gratified when The Observer received many letters protesting his continued insults proving to Willington that not all Notre Dame students condoned such classless activities. 
But now a problem arose. Perhaps Willington had been too blatant in his critical satire. People were beginning to suspect that "Chip Spina" was not who he claimed to be. For a time, many on The Observer staff thought Will­ington had blown his cover. 
john zygmunt 
Willington. however. rebounded magnificiently. He had "Chip Spina" send a letter to The Observer defending his columns! The fictitious "Spina" not only refused to acknowledge any error but accused his detractors of having a poor grasp of the English language. The following is an excerpt from "Spina's" hilarious reply to his critics. 
"Now just because certain illiter· ate clements of the student body are unable to recognize sarcasm and hyperbole (know what they are?) when they read doesn't mean that I should cease using these techniques.'' 
After reading that passager I angerily went up to The Observer office to confront "Chip Spina." As chance would have it, I ran into Rufus Willington, who. after lead· ing me on a bit admitted "Chip's" columns were all meant as satire. Willington explained he would stop writing the column "till things cool down" but assured me "Chip Spina" would reappear. 
And indeed he has and as funny as ever. All year "Spina" has wailed on about The Observer's sport section and their promise to tell it like it is. Willington, of course. realizes just the exact opposite is true. 
Willington portrayed this-inde· cisivcness in The Observer Sports Department by having "Chip Spina" write about Notre Dame's controversial win over Alabama without having Spina give an opinion about the game! Instead, Willington. using his background in philosophy, modeled his column after Gralieo's "Diaologue Con­cering 
the New Science," so two stand-ins represented the two sides of the question freeing "Spina" from any responsibility about what "the skeptic" and the "rah-rah" said. Brilliant. 
As the football season draws to a close. I would like to thank Willing­ton for teaching me the true meaning of satire and parody.

The Georgetown Watcliers 
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii art b u c h waI d 
WASHINGTON -You have probably all been following Jimmy Carter's transition efforts with interest. One of the headlines that keeps cropping up is "Georgetown Awaits Carter People." 
There is a myth in Washington that "Georgetown" controls the country and what is said at George­town parties affects the lives of every man, woman and child in the United States. 
The first place the Carter transi­tion people go when they arrive in Washington is Georgetown. They stand around holding a glass of white wine in their hands hoping to find out what is happening in the nation's capital. The truth of the matter is that Georgetown over the years has lost its influence 'and most of the power brokers in this town have moved up to W esl.ey Heights and Cleveland Park. 
The reason for this is quite simple. The houses in Georgetown are all bunched together, and the walls are so thin that whatever is said in one house can be heard in another. There are no secrets in Georgetown but the press people -­always the last ones to get the word --still keep covering Georgetown as they did in the Sixties, when the 
Kennedy  folk  used  to  hang  out  
their  laundry  on  each  other's  
clotheslines.  

It's true that there are some opinion makers who still live in Georgetown. Kay Graham, pub­lisher of The Washington Post, has her home there. Joe Kraft still lives in Georgetown as does Rowland Evans, but his partner, Robert Novak, lives in Maryland. Jack Anderson is in Bethesda and Scotty Reston lives in Kalorama. Ben Bradlee, editor of The Wash­ington Post, moved out of George­town long ago, and Woodward and Bernstein live next to "Deep Throat," wherever that is. 
So what you get in Georgetown are really leftovers from the "Camelot" years. 
I was at ..a cocktail party in Georgetown last week and the conversation went something like this. 
"I hear there is talk at the agency that the Cuban exiles might land at the Bay of Pigs." 
"Bobby Baker is in real trouble and may be indicted bv the Grand Jury." : · 
"Billie Sol Estes is going broke in Texas." 
"Arthur Schlesinger is writing a book exposing John Foster Dulles." 
"The White House is thinking of sending Vice President Johnson to Berlin." 
"The CIA is tapping Dean Rusk's telephone." "Krushchev is fighting with the Politburo and may be out any day.'' 
"Robert McNamara is going to Vietman to find out what the story is over there." 
"Jackie Kennedy is thinking of redoing the White House." 
The Carter people kept writing everything down in large black looseleaf notebooks which eventu­ally would be turned over to the President-elect. 
I tried to point out to one of them that if they wanted fresher news on Washington they should go to a cocktail party in Cleveland Park. 
But the poor fellow said he didn't know where Cleveland Park was. 
Besides, he said, Carter was very interested in what they were saying about him in Georgetown. 
The only place in Georgetown where you can still get up-to-date news about what is going on is Doc Dalinsky's Drugstore on 0 Street. The reason for this is that while many of the power brokers have moved out of Georgetown, they still come to Dalinsky for their prescrip­tions. I suggested to one of Carter's transition men that if he really wanted the straight poop on Washington he should go to Dalinsky's coffee klatch on Sunday morning. 
But the Carter man shook his head. "I was told to stay with the cocktail circuit in Georgetown. They say that's where it's all happening." 
A man came by at that moment and said, "Did you hear Lynda Bird Johnson is getting married?" 
The Carter man wrote it down in his big black book.

"Well. here's Christmas--at our throats again!'· This cry of the cynic manifests an attitude that is shared by many who are fed up with the mad commercialism of this season. Advent seems to be a question of just so many shopping days until Christ­mas, a time for office parties, gift selecting and card sending. It is hard to penetrate through the tinsel and fat Santas, the reindeer and candv canes. the mistletoe and "chestnuts roasting on the open fire," to discover the real meaning of it all. 
Almost everyone has a different rcac­iion. Ask the clerk in the store what this season means to her and she'll tell you. .. An avalanche of wild shoppers." For the cop on the corner it means a nightmare of snarled traffic; for the mailman it means an aching back; and for Notre Dame students. the pressure of papers and exams. 
There docs seem to be some general agreement. however. that Advent is a time of preparation. But too often this has meant a rather silly pretending that we arc awaiting the birth of Jesus. as though he hasn't ah-ead\· come. T. S. Eliot mav be right: "Hu~wnkind cannot bear ,-;uu:h rcalitv." But if we lose the sense of rcalitv. we a'rc ripe for the easy m\'thology of liturgical·ycar gamesmanship. Ycar after year people act as though Christ is about to come as a bab\' (some churches even have the tasteless J~racticc of sending a plater

Jesus-doll down a wire. strung from the choir-loft. to land in the crib precisely at midnight on Christmas eve). Frequently. children arc taken to Christmas mangers and told to pray to the infant Jesus. Sentimentalists may get terribly upset, and yell "Scrougc!" but still the plain truth reveals that there is no infant Jesus. There was. But he grew up. died. rose on the third day; and he remains with us now in his gloriticd presence. 
It has not been helpful to youngsters (and those not so young) to have them play games with the trut~. The church. which has not always had perfect grades for being in touch with realitv. shows her wisdom bv not allowing even o.nc ofticial prayer that i:-; addressed to the infant Jesus. Prayer is meant to be realistic; it is for the here and now. as things are !">ere and now. None of this should be interpreted to mean that the Christmas crib is out of place. Quite the contrar~·! But the crib scene calls for some authentic understanding. It necessitates a realization that there is a difference between rctlccting on the past and the rcalit~· of the present moment. The 
Dedication of a new Basilica 
Most foreign studies programs otfer continual travel. a new culture, and a different language to students who venture a year abroad. The Mexico program, however, added another touch to these benefits this year. It offered students a spot in its history. 
On October 12. as more than 600,000 people crowded around the new basilica to see its dedication to the Virgin of Guadalupe. two Notre Dame sophomores, Dave Leibowitz and Brian Hogan, played a vital role in the event. . 
"Basically," said Hogan. "our job was to welcome representatives and dignitaries from 33 different countries, and on the day of the dedication itself form a protective wall around the bishops and cardinals so that they could leave freely after celebrat­ing mass... The three day function climaxed with 500 cardinals, bishops. and priests concelebrating a mass in the new basilica. Among them was John Cardinal Krol from Philadelohia. 
According to Leibowitz, besides ·senUlu~;; invitations to reliigious figures, officials also sent 11,000 invitations to dignitaries throughout the world, even though the church itself only holds 10.000 people. 
Leibowitz was also confronted with the huge crowd. and on one particular occasion slipped an invitation to a man who had walked for a month in order to see the dedication. 
This demonstration offaith on the part of the Mexican people evolves from their strong religious beliefs concerning mira­cles. One such miracle involves the Virgin of Guadelupe. 
On December 10, 11. and 12 in 1531, the Virgin of Guadalupe appeared to the Indian Juan Diego on the hill Tepeyacac, and a series of churches were established at the bottom of the hill until 1695 when the current standing basilica was completed. 
Since this basilica had slowly sunk into the ground at an awkward angle and was dangerous to visitors, engineers started construction on a new basilica about a year and a half ago. By the time of its dedication. the modern basilica located at the side of the old one was nearly completed. ' 
As workers frantically tried to prepare the church for the dedication, Hogan and Leibowitz also began preparing for the event. Selected from a group of more than 300 volunteers, they met with 48 other collegians almost two months beforehand under the direction of Mayu Gutierrez in order to acquaint themselves with the basilica and its history. "During one meeting in particular we spent three hours touring the old basilica so that we could inform the visitors," Leibowitz noted. 
According to Hogan, each person had a different assignment. ''During the first night I was stationed at the Fiesta Palace, a hotel on Reforma, to welcome the visitors and representatives. Then, on the follow­
ing  day,  both  Dave  and  I  met  the  
dignitaries  when  they  arrived  at  the  
airport."  

At six o'clock on the morning of the twelfth, Hogan, Leibowitz, and the other collegians led the cardinals, bishops, and 
John Dilenschneider 
priests to a bus, and then rode to the basilica where they arrived at eight o'clock. 
On the way the students used a microphone to give a spontaneous speech to the representatives concerning this history of the basilica and the Virgin of Guadalupe. 
"When we got there officials were all over the place to keep order," Hogan explained. "Some ofthe people (represen­tatives) went to the old basilica to prepare for the procession, while others went directly to the new building.'' 
At 10 o'clock the doormen began to take invitations, and swarms of people gathered to see the procession from the old basilica. In the procession the dignitaries wore their national wardrobe and carried their country's falg. 
The purpose of the procession was to carry Juan Diego's white cloak on which the image of the Virgin Mary miraculously appeared 445 years ago from the old basilica to the new basilica where it was to be situated on the wall behind the altar in plain view. 
After the procession, mass started. Speakers had been placed outside the church to enable the people without invitations to hear the singing and the mass itself. 
"During the mass I was stationed on the balcony and tried to keep the people in their seats," said Leibowitz. "Sometimes though they got too anxious and started climbing over each other like animals." 
Meanwhile, after taking invitations, Hogan had seated himself near the altar in order to assist the religious figures during their exit. 
At the offertory 15 children brought up gifts of wine, corn, grapes, beans, and flowers to the altar. All these offerings were typical Mexican foods, and had a symbolic meaning to the people of Mexico. 
"They set up two large screens on both sides of the altar," added Hogan, "and sometime around two o'clock, after the offertory, the people were able to see a televised message from the Pope." The message's theme focused upon the idea that the Virgin of Guadalupe is special to the latin American people, and acts as their go-between in relation to God. The Pope also emphasized the undying faith of the Latin American people. 
Around 2:30, 100 priests pushed out into 
the crowds which waited outside to give 
communion to 500,000 people. The mass 
ended a half an hour later, and the 
religious group that had stood around the 
main altar filed out the side aisles 
protected by the group of students. At that 
time the people waiting outside were 
allowecl to enter the new basilica to look 
around and bring up offerings. 
Following the mass the dignitaries 
proceeded to a banquet held at ~he 
Hacienda de los Morales, an exclustve 
Mexican restaurant. "We also had to 
accompany the visitors during the concert 
held on the afternoon of the following day 
at the new basilica," said Hogan. "And 
then that completed our role in the event." 
Both Hogan and Leibowitz were im­
pressed by the event, and formulated some

Christmas scene is meant to point us

Thus the crib can give us the kcv to understanding what Christmas is all about. Christmas loses its significance if it doc~ not lead us to what it initiated. It is a bit like a senior from Farley who will go home this Christmas and receive an engagement ring.

Christmas is like that for each of us: It marked the day the tina! phase of our redemption began. It initiated the last stage in the Father's strategy for rescuing us; it was the time mankind's hope and longing for salvation was brought to the 
high·st pitch of int··nsit,·.

vation for choosing this drama. To produce : an Edward Albee play with . college 

 
students is ambitious--to produce it well with college students (and in the vault of O'Laughlin Auditorium) is next to im­possible. This second production of the season is marked by a number of flaws: problems which are ten percent the locale, thirty percent the cast, thirty percent the director and thirty percent Edward Albee. 


Manv times audiences and actors have

remarked alike during intermissions and : rehearsals that the lack of a useable theater : at this university is more than an injustice 

 
to both producers and audiences: it should : be an embarrassment. The low quality of 

 
facilities i.nherently cramps any produc­: tion. : Portraying a middle-aged character in 


any rer.listic play is inevitably a difficult task for a seasoned college-age actor and an insurmountable one for an inexperi­enced performer. The sic-character cast of A Delicate Balance exhibits a frustrating lack of depth as a result, brightened only the performance of two veterans: Matt McKenzie as Tobias and Shevawn O'Connor as his alcoholic sister-in-law, Claire. McKenzie captures the .character of Tobias, a middle-aged passive husband "plagued" by three witches in the caul­dron of his own home. It is a difficult role, but McKenzie's experience and talent keep him floating and allow this performance to achieve believability. Shevawn O'Connor is a born comedienne, a one-woman show 
 
and a delight. She exhibits total express­ion, acting with both her voice and her body in a rare display of dramatir: communication. Her vigor_ sends tht: audience laughing with a walk, a simple gesture and an accordian concert handled naturally and with a perfect timing and sensitivity. 

Agnes, the imperious head of the household, is likewise an ambiguous role and the directorial interpretation in this case remains questionable. Agnes' "madness" opens and closes the play, but she is portrayed by high-pitched Anne Christine Massulo as madness that is anger rather than lunacy. This matriarch, whose xonstant preoccupation it is to 

 
maintain the family's delicate balance in a social malaise, needs to be played subtly and carefully. She, like the play she inhabits, exists in a state of delicate balance between sanity and frenzy and serves as the chorus of the play. This performance has the subtlety of a train wreck and never achieves a delicacy of any kind. 


Likewise, Ann Kenny, who plays an but she never fully portrays that deep internal tension which haunts the four-time divorcee. We see her only as a victim and not as the torturer she sometimes is and only as a child and never as a woman. 
This lack of subtlety is characteristic of the entire production. Albee's language is: rich with suggestion and insinuation. but: the directorial concept expresses none of  this gentleness. The players act as if they: are saying something. but we are never quite sure what is being said. The Terror: that Edna and Harry flee from is never 
defined;  we  never  hear  the  details  of:  
Teddy's  death;  the  script  embodies  a  
hatin.ess  and  an  ambiguity  that  the:  

production fails to illuminate. Unless we: arc to place the entire blame on Albee, it ise clear that the flaw lies in the production. : The inexpressible Terror must be under- stood indirectly and serve as a mirror to: articulate the fears ofthe entire household.  This production fails to convince us that: anvthing lies either inside or outside the world that the characters inhabit. : 
Lou St. Ville as Edna is the most convincing as a middle-aged character. : She has some fine moments in her: rambling speeches. Gary Aumiller. however, is flimsy and unconvincing as the: husband Harry and never lifts his head juring the entire two and one-half hour: production.  Costuming creates still another problem.: 
It is impossible to believe that Harry and Edna, who wear leisure suits and house-: dresses and probably go bowling one Wednesday nights, are best frieds and! belong to the same club as Tobias and: Agnes, who wear velvet pants. smoking jacket and flowing caftans. Moreover.: wigs are useful to create a new charactcre but they should look like hair. and not like: wigs.  
Dramatic production demands consist-: ency in all aspects. The setting of this! production is an expressionistk design ofe cold black shapes scattered around an: elevated black platform. A Delicate Balance is a realistic play and anything but: a realistic setting opposes a fundamental aspect of the script. :

opint«ns from their experiences. ''I achieved a better understanding of the psychology of power," Hogan said. "Every time a person saw my badge, he knew that it meant authority.'' 
Leibowitz, however, was more im­pressed by the people. 
Both Leibowitz and Hogan agree that the event was one of "historical importance," and they're not liable to forget it ... especially when they have a constant reminder hanging in their closets. Each got to keep the blue suit and striped tie they were given to wear at the dedication.

Grit plans community tree 
Plans are underway for a University Christmas Tree. Fr. Robert Griffin, the University chaplain, initiated the project yesterday. "In the wake of the 
' criticism of the OSHA bans last week, it occurred to me that we do not have an official tree," commented Fr. Griffin. 

The University Chaplain cited several cities which include a Christmas tree in their festivities as precedents for one at Notre Dame. "It would be a tree that everyone could contribute to and take care of," he noted. 
So far the individuals consulted by Fr. Griffin have been favorable to the plan. A collection was taken at Fr. Griffin's S:OO p.m. Sunday mass and approximately $100 was donated toward the community tree and decorations. · 
A possible site for the tree is Crossroads Park. The University Chaplain hopes to have the tree set up by Thursday, December 9, 1976. At II :00 p.m. that night the tree would be blessed by the highest available cleric, officially lit-up, and then carols sung. Fr. Griffin intends to invite one of the campus choral groups to perform at the ceremony. The event would be followed by hot choco­late and donuts at Darby's Place. 

raid as "the largest operation the state police have ever participated in." Off-duty policemen from every state police post north of U.S. Highway 40 participated. 
In all, more than 2SO officers took part in the raid. This number included about ISO South Bend policemen and more than 100 from state and county forces. An estimated SO FBI agents also participated in the arrests. 
South Bend Police Chief Michael Borkowski commented that South Bend Police will be watching the number of burglaries and arrests that take place in the near future, to see how effective a deterrent last week's arrests have been. 
Borkowski also threatened to use operations of this type in the future, because of the apparent success with which stolen goods are recovered. With the police competing with other fencing operations, burglars are less sure of being able to get rid of stolen property. This in turn. according to police officials, should cut down the number of burglaries. ·

A lot of you fly west for vacation break. But many are in the strange habit of taking the toll road to O'Hare. Or roller skating, or something.We don't know. 
We're surprised that more beleaguered students don't take the easy way out: your handy local airport, right here in South Bend. Flying from South Bend isn't just quicker and easier. It's no more expensive. 
For example, one-way Coach air fare from South Bend to Los Angeles is only $4.00 more than the same ticket from Chicago. Now, unless you're stuffing a \'<)lkswagen or know a way to make tolls, gas and parking disappear, it's probably going to cost you at least four bucks to drive to O'Hare. It1l also cost you time and hassle.

Notre DamecagerswhipValparaiso 
by Ted Robinson Sports Writer 

That wasn't really a college basketball team in those brown and gold uniforms Saturday afternoon in the A.C.C. They might have been a high school team flown in for a special appearance. The only problem was that a more suitable opponent would have been the St. Louis Zips. 
Nevertheless. the team that wore Valparaiso on the front of their jerseys took one on the chin Saturday. Notre Dame hardly broke a sweat in a sleep-inducing 93-56 victory. 
"The first five or six minutes is what killed us. I thought it was awfully important to stay close early in the game and we didn't do that," said Ken Rochilitz. Valpo's head coach. Perhaps he meant the first five or six minutes of the warmups because his team was out of it from the opening jump. 
It was very hard to judge the Notre Dame performance as they were not forced to put forth an inspired effort. 
Rich Branning's game was not hard to judge. The 6-3 freshman guard. whose middle name is becoming "Blue Chip," had 18

points, five assists and four steals in only 20 minutes of action. The smoothness with which he directs the offense lends credence to his California buildup as a young Jerry West. 
Combine his totals with the nine points and four assists logged by Dice Martin and you have potent production from the point guard position. Incidentally, Martin's now made eight consecutive shots from the floor covering the last two games. 
With Dave Batton sitting out the game due to a 104-degree fever, Toby Knight and Bruce Flowers carried the slack underneath. Knight shot 7-11 from the floor, as he compiled 17 points. Knight seems to have mastered the role of the big man in the Irish full-court press that has been missing since the graduation of Peter Crotty. 
Flowers had his second consecu­tive strong game under the basket. With 14 points and 12 rebounds, he completely dominated any center Valparaiso could throw in the game. 
For the capacity crowd of 11,345, the game's most exciting moments came during the appearances of Notre Dame's now famous SWAT team, or as Sports Dlustrated terms them in their upcoming issued, a self-named hit squad. 
The identification of the student body with the walk-ons led to the final basket of the first half, a row-H bomb by Billy "Hawk-Eye" Sahm. It seems as if Digger Phelps may have found a new crowd­pleaser in the SWAT team, and the walk-ons certainly can't complain about the playing time.

Early in the afternoon, before many of the late-arriving fans settled in their seats, the dunk made its real debut in the A.C.C. Knight showed the fans the nearest thing to Dr. J that college basket­ball can offer. A flying slam dunk with a 10-foot takeoff provided a glimpse of what the game has been missing for years. 
In those early minutes, the game was settled when Valpo missed close to a dozen shots of 10 feet or less. Their high-scoring guard. Nolan Petties. missed six of those. and in the process the Irish took an 18-6 lead. 
As Valparaiso connected on only 29 percent of their first-half shots. Notre Dame widened their halftime lead to 37-18. The second half set the stage for the women's basket­ball arne that was to follow. 
The two home games that Notre Dame played in the past week can serve only as a partial barometer of the true potential that this team possesses. If a team only plays as well as its opponent's potential. then this team has its best moments ahead of them. UCLA and Indiana in the span of four days could show some of those moments. 
Before the Irish take off for Los Angeles, they entertain the North· western Wildcats Tuesday even­ing. Northwestern brings with them their All-American candidate. guard Billy McKinney.
