In Brief 
Poltergeist actress Heather O'Rourke died Monday at the age of 12. O'Rourke died while being rushed to Children's Hospital in San Diego after an apparent bout with the flu, her manager said Tuesday. The angelic­looking O'Rourke is the second actress from the "Polter­geist" movies to die unexpectedly. Dominique Dunne, who played a teen-age daughter in the original, was strangled in October 1982.-Associated Press 
A preacher's wife will be counting her pennies from heaven -more than 120 million of them -for the next 20 years, with a little help from the Illinois Lottery. Barbara Springfield, whose husband, Jim, gave up a $30,000-a-year job to become pastor of a storefront church, won more than $1.2 million in Saturday's drawing of the state's Lotto game. She had purchased only a few tickets and said she kept those hidden from her husband because he preaches that gambling is a sin. So, what does he think of her windfall? "I prayed for her and asked the Lord to forgive her," said Springfield, pastor of Good Hope Free Will Bap­tist Church, who was willing to overlook the sin in this case. "It seems to me like the Lord is saying, 'Hey, here's your salary for the next 20 years; now preach my word,"' said Springfield. -Associated Press 
Law officers arrested Alabama NAACP President Thomas Reed and 10 other black leaders on Tuesday when they tried to climb a fence around the Capitol to take down the Confederate battle flag flying over the dome. Reed contends the flag represents racism and oppression and said that if it was not taken down voluntarily he planned to "enter the Capitol grounds and climb to the top of the state Capitol dome and remove the Confederate battle flag." He said the banner is resented by blacks and "better-thinking white people." -Associated Press

Seniors relax; forget anxiety about next year 
It's getting pretty intense down at the Career and Placement office this time of year. Seniors in search of a jobs can be as irritable as Robert Young before he discovered decaffeinated cof­fee. I should know, I am one. 
Since the beginning of this semseter, a week 

has not gone by when my classmates have not 
seen me sporting my blue suit and heading for the basement of the library. I am really getting into this interview thing while the getting is good. Sooner or later, somebody is going to make me leave Notre Dame and the confines of a well-organized placement service. I cannot imagine trying to get an interview on my own. 
Because no senior is in his or her own private sinking career boat, there are plenty of people with whom we can share war stories about the job hunt. Ask just about any senior and he or she will have an interview story to tell. 
One of my friends who works for the paper has labelled himself an "interview geek" until he gets a job. "What's an interview geek?" you ask. When this guy walks into an interview he has already spent at least an hour psyching himself up for possible questions. He does all of the research on a company and then some. He even goes through a sort of mental push-ups to further hone his mind for the interview chal­lenge. 
But his "geekiness" does not stop in the in­terview room. If he watches TV, he looks for commercials an ad agency he is interested in has produced. If he gets a letter from any com­pany, he asks himself aloud (before opening the envelope) if this could be the job offer he is waiting for. 
My friend's being an interview geek will pay 
off, however. As the saying goes, the squeaky 
wheel gets the grease. Potential employers 
have never heard a guy squeak so loudly. 
My problem with this whole job hunt process 
is that I am not patient enough. After I have 
been in an interview for 30 minutes, I wish the 
guy would just look at me and tell me whether 
or not I have a job. Instead, everybody gives 
you the same big grin, shakes your hand and 
tells you to wait for infinity (or two weeks, 
whatever comes first) before you get your 
nickel beer notice (rejection letter is such a 
nasty term). At that point, you do not know if 
the interviewer thought you were God's gift to 
the waste products industry or the biggest 
schlep he or she has ever met. 
Another problem that I have in particular 
about the waiting factor is that I have been 
reading Forbes and Fortune religiously for the 
past year. (If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.) 
Needless to say, these magazines do not run 

Kevin Becker 
Editor-in-Chief 


-----------------­
articles about guys and gals two years out of college who are still so low on the totem pole that moving down would put the street people out of work. The pages of those magazines are reserved for the truly elite, the people that many of us would like to be in the next six to eight ... months. 
In every issue, Forbes runs a feature on "The Up & Comers." These articles are about the people to watch in the world of business, people that many of us may be working for in the next couple of years. A sample feature would be about some 27-year-old making 300K a year as he scratches his way up the corporate ladder (making sure not to chip the crystal on his Rolex, of course.) 
Recently, Fortune ran a small article on a 30-year-old who had founded a nation-wide yo­gurt franchise. The barely post-adolescent multi-millionaire was quoted at the end of the article as saying that he felt he missed out on the college experience. For that kind of money, I could be convinced to give up going to Bridget's for a while. 
But for now, all that we seniors can do is wait and hope for the best. While we're waiting, however, we might as well wait at Bridget's. For some reason, the frustration of it all seems to go down a lot easier there.

Associated Press 
TUSCALOOSA, Ala. -A gun­man was taken into custody and 26 children and a teacher who were held hostage in a day­long siege at a private school were released Tuesday night, police told the children's par­ents. 
"It's over," said Assistant Chief of Police Billy Wilkins. He said the kids were "all right.''

Reagan attempts to save 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -President Reagan made a last-ditch ef­fort to salvage his $36.2 million aid package for the Contra rebels on Tuesday by promis­ing to release money for arms and ammunition only if Congress agrees. 
In an Oval Office address shunned by three major televi­sion networks, Reagan argued that Wednesday's vote in the House amounted to nothing less than "win or lose for peace and freedom. It is yes or no to America's national security." 
"Our support is needed now ­
tomorrow will be too late," Reagan said, pleading support for the Contras' battle against the leftist government of Nicaragua.

Student Campaign Against Hunger which is responsible for organizing cleanups all over the country. 
To pick the work sites for the event, applications have been sent out to non-profit organiza­tions. 
The applications ask if the group has any work which could be done by area students and how many students the job would require. The returned applications are then reviewed and sites are chosen, said Durkin. 
Prizes are being donated by area businesses to be awarded to the students who collect the most money. 
Last year, prizes included a round trip flight to anywhere in the continental United States, an escape weekend at the Marriot, dinner for two at Tippicanoe Place, and dinners at other fine restaraunts in South Bend. 
Although prizes for this year have not been confirmed, they will be comparable to those of­fered last year, reports Durkin. 
This year Notre Dame, Saint Mary's, and area high school students have expressed an in­terest in participating in the event. 
Last year was the first year Notre Dame took part in the cleanup. Notre Dame was ranked twelveth of all univer­sities that paticipated. Approx­imately 120 students were in­volved and succeeded in raising $2,000. 
Durkin is hopeful that with better organization and more publicity this year will be even more successful.

LUMBERTON, N.C. -When heads were counted during the hostage siege at The Robesonian newspaper, reporter Raymond Godfrey was nowhere to be found. He had slipped away during the confusing early minutes and hidden in a darkened office. 
During the next 10 hours Godfrey would become a vital link to Gov. Jim Martin's office, which was negotiating the release of 17 people taken hostage Monday by two armed American Indians who said they were protesting the death of a black jail inmate. 
Hostages were released throughout the day until the last seven were freed and Eddie Hatcher, 30, and Timothy Jacobs, 19, members of the Tuscarora faction of the Lumbee Indians, surrendered at 8 p.m. 
Hatcher and Jacobs ap­peared Tuesday before U.S. magistrate Wallace Dixon in Raleigh, who set a probable cause hearing for Feb. 12 on the charges of hostage-taking and possession of sawed-off shotguns. No bond was set, and both were taken to the Federal Corrections Center in Butner. 
If convicted, each could receive a maximum of life in prison for hostage-taking, and 20 years and $500,000 fine on the two weapons charges, Dixon said. 
When two men charged into the newspaper office, "I 

Staffer hid, kept cops informed during siege 
backed slowly into the room and pulled the door shut," said Godfrey, 32, who covers city government. "I left the light off, locked the door and grabbed the phone." 
After calls to his wife and the 911 emergency number, Godfrey called Lumberton police, describing the in­truders, their weapons and other details. Then he had a brainstorm. 
"I heard what they were 
saying about wanting to talk to 
the governor, so I called his of­
fice," he said. "We kept an 
open line the whole time." 

Godfrey provided the State 
Bureau of Investigation with 
vital details about the scene in 
the adjacent room, including 
his observations on Hatcher 
and Jacobs' mental and physi­
cal condition. 

"I told them they weren't 
threatening anyone and that I 
didn't see any explosives, 
which they claimed they had," 
Godfrey said. 

Crouched silently under the 
accounting manager's desk, 
Godfrey also dictated the cap­
tors' list of demands, which he 
overheard. 

At one point, Godfrey said he climbed on a bookcase and into the small space between the ceiling and a drop ceiling in an effort to find an escape route. 
"I thought 'This is it. This is the day you are going to die,"' he said. "I thought about my kids. I began to believe I had to get out."

ND Grad tells his 
P.O. Box Q
Nicaraguan story 
ND Security heartless humor of "fat jokes." 
Editor's Note: A copy of the following column has been sent to Representative John Hiler. 
As a resident of South Bend, now living and working in Nicaragua, I believe that it is essential to keep you in touch with the realities of life here. In several weeks, you and your fellow representatives will be debating fur­ther aid to the Contra forces attacking this nation. I ask you today to prevent the widening of this war in Central America. 
John Kellenberg 
guest column 
In early December, the Contra forces hit a series of small refugee resettle­ments north of the Nicaraguan town of Esteli, killing 12 campesinos, burning houses, a school and its contents to the ground and destroying a health center thatservedthelocalcommunity.~ean­while, a Contra mortar attack launched against the Atlantic coastal town of Puerto Cabezas killed six Nicaraguans, five of whom were under the age of 14. 
At the same time that President Os­car Arias of Costa Rica was receiving the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for his ef­forts to end the Central American wars, President Reagan was pressuring Congress to provide further assistance for the U.S.-financed Contras. Three days after Reagan's successful lobby­ing effort, over 1000 Contras struck the northern mining towns of Bonanza, Siuna and La Rosita. The fighting was fierce, and more than 200 Nicaraguans were killed, including 90 civilians. 
These are just several events which have occurred in the past month, af­fecting the lives of the Nicaraguan people and my work here. I am working at the Jesuit-run Institute of John XXIII, a Catholic organization that has gras­sroots development projects in each region of Nicaragua, as well as dis­tributing food, clothing, medicine, sewing and educational supplies, seeds and toys throughout the countryside to those affected by war. 
Supplies from the Institute of John XXIII go out to rural refugee commun­ities, churches and Christian base com­munities, sewing, fishing, and farming cooperatives, orphanages, maternity hospitals and health centers -locations

frequently struck by the Contras in their hit-and-run actions. Jeeps and pick-up trucks with nuns, priests and pastoral workers come to our office to receive supplies -some vehicles with Vatican flags affixed to their roofs in hopes of protecting themselves from Contra attacks on the highways. 
Sadly enough, trucks carrying humanitarian aid are prime targets of the U.S.-financed Contras, as the sup­plies are meant to improve the living conditions of the rural population in this poor nation. Religious and lay workers returning to their communities with supplies have been wounded or killed by land mines set by the Contras on dirt roads between the highway and the rural villages. Likewise, vehicles have been stopped along the road with pas­sengers kidnapped as forced recruits into the Contra forces. 
Life in Nicaragua means parents un­able to feed their clhildren, as food prices are exorbitant. There is no run­ning water on a regular basis, while electricity is out for hours at a time and gasoline is rationed. A drought over the past year has hit all of Central America, which will mean food shortages in the months ahead. Yet in the United States, President Reagan feels that Nicaragua is a threat to our national security. 
All of the money spent on defense weaponry over the past seven years cannot protect the United States from the mothers nursing their babies while making tortillas over a wood fire? Or from the street children of ~anagua selling Chiclets to passing motorists? Or from the poor campesino farmers trying to raise beans and rice under the hot Central American sun? To the Nicaraguan people and a vast majority of the American public, the war makes no sense. 
Despite the peace initiatives at­tempted by the nations of Latin America, a true cessation of the hostil­ities here depends upon the will of the United States government to stop fun­ding for the Contra forces. I appeal to you in the name of the suffering people of Nicaragua and in the name of God ­stop the bloodshed.

worthy of praise 
Dear Editor: 

Everyone rips on Notre Dame secur­ity for all the bad things they do to stu­dents. A time has come for students to thank ND security. Last Thursday night, security did an outstanding job of handling a situation in Cavanaugh Hall involving larceny. Security responded moments after being called, and arrested one of two subjects in the crime. The other had fled. Upon giving a description over the radio, it took se­curity merely two minutes to ap­prehend the second subject. 
Notre Dame security deserves a big round of applause for their excellent work. Thanks a lot. Special thanks to officers Dan Kavanaugh, Debbie Qualls, Captain Joe Araman, and As­sistant Security Director Phil Johnson. They were only doing "their job," but to us it meant much more. But most of all, thanks for being there when we needed help. We, as Notre Dame stu­dents, are truly grateful for the protec­tion ND security gives us. They do a great job.

As a Notre Dame Admissions Coun­selor I have read literally thousands of tributes to the sensitivity, cleverness and individuality of Notre Dame stu­dents. Surely every dorm on campus has talent enough to create entertaining and thoroughly delightful skits and pro­grams. To do so would require time, commitment and original thinking ­precious commodities to all. 
Unfortunately, as many 1988 appli­cants have quoted in their ~artin Lut­her King, Jr., essays: "It is easier to be immoral in a crowd." 
It is this crowd mentality which I challenge the script writers to courageously combat. Who will be the first to produce a "fat free" variety show -trashing the traditional stale jokes and mutually degrading sit­coms? I believe the individuals of the NI}SMC community could pioneer a new caliber of entertainment. One which is truly humorous. 
The women and men of ND and S~C have much to learn about venerating the Feminine Spirit, Mother God. Elim­inating sexist slurs from campus enter­tainment would be an encouraging for­ward step. 
Why not give Our Lady something she can truly "cheer" about?

Big Ten coaches are split on non-conference games 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -Big Ten basket­
ball coaches were split Tues­
day on the question of breaking 
up the conference schedule 
with nonconference games for 
the sole purpose of television. 
"It's good for college basket­
ball,'' said Michigan Coach Bill 
Frieder at the Big Ten coaches' 
weekly telephone interview. 
"But I don't know if it will cost 
us a victory this week. If it 
does, it will be a big, big disad­-vantage." 
Michigan's 11th-ranked Wol­
verines lost to No.12 Syracuse 
89-71 in a nationally televised 
game Sunday, and face Iowa 
and Purdue this week. Illinois, 
ranked 17th, dropped a 78-70 
decision Saturday at No. 1 
Arizona and plays Ohio State 
and Indiana this week. 
"You get so much pressure," 
said Frieder. "There's money 
and media pressure. CBS put a lot of pressure on us. Originally the game was scheduled in December, but it was changed for national TV. 

"But it was exciting, we played before 35,000 people and the kids enjoyed it." 
Illinois' Lou Henson has had two interruptions and is not in favor of such games. Earlier in the season, the Illini had their conference schedule broken for a game against Tennessee. 
"I don't like it," said Henson. "Most coaches feel as I do . But it was national television and the No.1 team (Arizona). From a coach's point, I'd prefer not to do it. But there are a lot of other things you have to look at." 
Purdue had a date at Louis­ville and came off with a 91-85 victory in a game that also had been scheduled for December but moved to January. 
"It's because of money and national television and usually 
they are great games," said 
Gene Keady of sixth-ranked 

Purdue. "Our Louisville game 
was a great one." 
Iowa has played two noncon­

ference games since the race 
started and Coach Tom Davis 
welcomes all such games for 
his 13th-ranked Hawkeyes. 
"We do it for two reasons, television and national expo­sure," said Davis. "Those are hard terms to turn down. We saved an open date and told them we'd play anybody in the country, home or away. It's good for the school and the con­ference." 
Jud Heathcote of Michigan State, Gary Williams of Ohio State and Bill Foster of Northwestern are among the coaches who do not have such interruptions because their teams have not been asked to move games for television pur­poses.

In addition to her remarkable voice, O'Connor writes or co­writes all her songs and produces and arranges her own material.

of others which allows them to 
keep from looking at them­
selves. 
Recovery for Adult Children Is 
similar to that for alcoholics. 
They need to re-learn patterns 
of behavior which are some­
what "normal". 
Last May Tina began treat­ment for her addictions. She learned that her desire to con­quer men sexually stemmed from her desire to be accepted, as well as her desire to control. 
"(When I was younger) I never knew what I was going to come home to," she said. "I didn't know If I was going to be greeted with a smile or smacked across the face. 
"When I was with guys I could control what was going to happen. I could have It my way. Or at least that's what I thought." 
Tina Is grateful for the alco­hol education Information that has been made available to her. Notre Dame plans to ex­
pand Its alcohol education 
through the Offlce of Alcohol 
and Drug Education which Is 
having its dedication ceremony 
Friday. 
"Most people don't know about being addicted to relationships, especially destructive ones. It sounds so weird," Tina said. "For me, It was behavior that I just didn't have control of." 
For Adult Children, this ad­diction to relationships can manifest itself In what is known as co-dependency. "Co­de~ndency Is an obsession with controlling another per­son," said Coleman, especially one who appears to need con­trol or help, such as an al­coholic or other type of addict. 
"In a normal relationship, a person Is Independent to be lnt&dependent. In a co­dependent relationship, the Independence is not there, "she said. 
For Tina co-dependence meant entering relationships with men who did not care about her. She would do anyth­Ing to hold onto them. In her attempt to control them, she ended up being controlled by 
them and by the situations in 
which she found herself. 
Co-dependents enter relation­ships with people who fulfill their need for abandonment ­something th~ir parents taught them. As children they were often Isolated or abandoned because of an alcohol problem. 
The college environment of­ten allows the "child" In these Adult Children to run rampant. They are thrown Into a compet­itive environment as well as an environment which asks them to deflne their roles as sexual beings. Receiving alcohol edu­cation In their college years can make a big difference In their futures. 
"Sometimes I really hate my parents," Tina said. "But then I remember that the disease was passed down to them. The best thing that I can do is to stop it." 
Note: A few of Tina's {acts were slighUy altered to protect her anonymity. 
This is the third in a series of articles on alcohol education at Notre Dame. 

"Frankenstein" shows a human perspective 
MARIA DOTI 
accent writer 
1\Jtln is created In the likeness of his creator, so the Bible l"'lsays. Inside every man Is a creator, and inside every creator Is a man. 
This 1<1ea Is wonderfully depleted In the Guthrie Theatre presentatlorvBarbara f"'eld adaptation of "Frankenstein,". which was performed at O'Laughlln Auditorium at Saint Mary's College last night. 
Most people, when hearing the word "Frankenstein," as­sociate It with the traditional image of the original monster -something close to what Herman looked like on "The Adams Family." Barbara Field, with the help of director Michael Maggio, approaches the embedded monster Image from a very different perspective -a human perspective. 
What better way Is there to relate to people than to speak in human terms, on ground level? This is exactly what f"'eld tries to do, and she more than accomplishes her goal. She greatly emphasizes the dynamics of the rela­tionship between a creator and his creation. 
The creator In "Frankenstein" is extremely proud of his achievement once he sees his creation come to life, yet he becomes fearful as he watches the destruction that arises. It Is his greed, his burning desire to preserve and prolong life, that is his motivation for creating the perfect man. But the problem comes about when the flawless man Dr. Frankenstein thinks he has created turns out to be a horrendous-looking monster. 
The performance opens with a very elderly Dr. Franken­stein, lame and lying stationary In the snow, on top of the 
..,4 world at the North Pole. Suddenly, his aged monster, now much wiser to the ways of the world. flnds him burled in snow. The creator Is unable to move about without his stick, much like a beggar -a low-life. Yet the monster, after months of carefully observing a family In the woods, has learned how to speak as well as feel emotions. It seems the monster has reached a level of Immense understand­Ing, a level much higher than that of Dr. Frankenstein. 
Through the art of flashbacks, the portrayal of scenes from the past alternately or simultaneously with scenes from the present. the members of the audience have the opportunity to use their minds and make them work. While experiencing the leaps from past to present and back again, It is easy to recognize the constant reiteration of key lines. 
One of the first questions the monster asks his master Is, "Why do you hate me?" This question arises In one of the clips from the past when a much younger, but equally Intelligent. Dr. Frankenstein Is with his college professor and mentor, who continuously urges him to do better. FI­nally, after arriving at the correct answe.rs and passing his test young Frankenstein asks this same question of his teacher. His professor explains the trials of teaching Idiots all of his life and admits that when finally stumbling upon a genius such as Frankenstein, he doesn't quite know how to act. 
Another example of a recurring theme Is when old Frankenstein and his monster take a glance at the past as well as at the monster's history of violence toward his creator. When Frankenstein first creates his monster, he Is disgusted at the sight of him. All of the monster's efforts to show companionship and gratefulness toward his creator are n;jected, thus resulting In the monster's first experiences of pain and true anger. 
The monster requests that the doctor make him a mate that will accept his ugliness, someone who can make him happy. When the doctor backs out of his agreement. the monster sees violence as the only means of making young Dr. Frankenstein feel grief equivalent to his own. This vio­lence results in the death of Elizabeth, young Franken­stein's mate. If the monster had to grieve the loss of his Jove, the price was going to be Frankenstein's happiness. 
One other theme that Is woven throughout the story Is the Issue of created versus born. The monster contin­uously refers to his creation as birth. Yet when an elderly Or. Frankenstein hears this he corrects him, saying. "You weren't born. I created you." 
From the time of his creation, the monster grows In strength while young Dr. Frankenstein gradually weakens. During the time the monster Is tied down, and for some time during his escape, the young doctor is bed-ridden. It becomes evident that young Frankenstein Is draining en­ergy from himself, almost risking his own life. to create new life. This is similar to the Bible, in which Christ died for all people, so that they would have eternal life. 
In the end, the time finally comes for the monster to be destroyed, for fear of lingering violence. The monster Is now fulfilled. He has received the answers to his many questions and Is willing to die. At this point, by embracing 
his creator, the monster is able to show the affection he has been forced to hold back during his life. And his creator acknowledges the embrace. 


Can't wake up and smell the coffee? Blame it on the flu 
Associated Press 
I 
f you recently suffered the 
flu and have not recovered 
your sense of smell. you aren't 
alone, researchers say. 
Some patients complain they are unable to smell things or to taste food after suffering a bout of influenza. Researchers at the University of Pennsylva­nia and the University of Con­necticut flrst reported the prob­lem and have been looking Into it. 
It has also come to the atten­tion of researchers at the Uni­versity of Cincinnati College of Medicine, where patients who come In for treatment at a cen­ter for taste and smell disor­ders have complained of the malady. 
It can happen to people who suffer flu or upper respiratory Infections, said Robert Frank. a University of Cincinnati psyc­hophysicist. It Is common for sufferers with colds or the flu to lose their sense of smell ­and, as a result their ability to taste -briefly during the time of the ailment. But Frank said, some people do not regain their sense of smell for months, or longer. 
"These people are seeing us six months after the flu has passed, and they still don't have their sense of smell," he said in an Interview. "We still don't even know if it's per­manent or not ... We don't know for sure right now, but we think there may be people who permanently lose their 
sense of smell after this kind 
of episode." 
After a period of time, some victims report sensing a persis­tent strange odor. Researchers have not determined what that means, Frank said. 
"There's some Indication in 
some people we've seen that 
they get this persistent odor," 
he said. "We hope that when 
people report these smells, 
that's a start of recovery." 
About 25 percent of the patients who come to the taste­smell center complaining of a loss of smell have a strain of flu that appears to be the culprit Frank said. 
He said specialists have a theory that the flu viruses may take away the victim's .ability to smell by damaging the olfac­tory epithelium -the skin on the inside of the nose. But he said, "We really don't know what happens." 
University of Cincinnati re­searchers are preparing an ap­plication for a U.S. department of Health and Human Services public health grant to study the problem. They would like fun­ding to follow the progress of people with the loss-of-smell problem, Frank said. 
The work could include taking samples of tissue from inside the noses of victims for analysis to determine whether flu viruses cause damage, he said. 
Researchers hope to develop treatment methods. "As It 
stands right now, for a person 
like this, we really have little 
idea of what to do," Frank said. 
Victims often complain that they have lost their sense of taste, because they cannot taste food. But inability to taste Is commonly caused by loss of smell, Frank said. A true loss of taste Is rare because three different nerves bring smell information to the brain and it Is unusual for all three to mal­function, he said. 
The problem can be danger­ous when It prevents people from smelling warning odors such as a natural gas buildup In a house. 
"One of the big problems is, you can't smell warning odors. There are a lot of older people who can't smell the gas, so they blow themselves up," Frank said. 
Frank ls researching the problem with David Smith, director of the university's cen­ter for taste and smell disorders. Frank and Smith are not medical doctors, but they have training in physics and biology, and specialize in evaluating human sensory sys­tems. 
"We still don't really know what the basic mechanisms are for how you taste and smell," he said. "We don't really know what makes certain chemicals important, in terms of how you smell them. In that sense, the study of taste and smell Is In Its Infancy."

Sorin, Morrissey, dominating men's 
By BOB MITCHELL Sports Writer 
While the temperatures out­side remain frigid, the compe­tition in men's Interhall basket­ball remains hot. The early season favorites, Sorin, Mor­rissey, and Off Campus Thunder, have done nothing to lose their distinction as the best teams. These three teams have dominated the most highly skilled league of the three A divisions -the ACC. They seem to be in a league of their own and destined for head-to-head competition in the playoffs. 
Morrissey is the only unde­feated team in the ACC with a 5-0 record. The Manorites have already defeated Sorin and are setting their sights on their reg­ular season matchup with O.C. Thunder. 
"Basically, we are well dis­tributed in talent; however the key to our team is Kevin "Star­boy" Keyes," said Morrissey captain Matt Dingens. "He controls the tempo of the game and is our clutch player. He realizes what must be done and gets it done." 
Dingens attributes much of the team's success to the physi­cal stature of its players and its depth of talent. The shortest player in the starting lineup for Morrissey is 6-0 and the tallest is 6-5. Opposing teams have a difficult time trying to match up defensively. 
Also, Morrissey has the abil­ity to play nine to ten men during the course of the game. This characteristic physically wears down opponennts. 
"Another critical part of our success is our ability to out­rebound our opponents," says Ding ens. 
Dingens believes that the toughest opponent in the ACC is Sorin. 
"We beat them by ten points during the regular season; however, they were missing some key players. It will be a totally different game with both teams at full strength," says Dingens. 
Sorin, the two-time defend­ing champion, has been plagued by injuries to key per­sonnel, yet they have a 4-1 record. Coach Sean Cullinan does not believe that his team 

Thunder IH hoops 
has the right ingredients for a championship unless things change. 
"We are not contenders in the 
league unless our key players 
get healthy." said Cullinan. 
So far this season the team has been guided by the play of Kent Graham, Dan Reynolds, and Andy Heck. This trio has been the core of their winning ways. Sorin has beaten O.C. Thunder and has Carroll left to play, giving them time to heal their bodies. 
"This is the least talented team I have been on in my four years here. However, I believe that if everyone works hard we will have a chance to win the championship." says Cullinan. "Morrissey is the team to beat. At this point in the season, they are the best team." 
In third place, but far from out of it, is O.C. Thunder. The Off-Campus team has posted four victories and one loss. Their only defeat came at the hands of Sorin. The Thunder has yet to play Morrissey whom they will square off against February 6.

Besides being a contender for a national title, the men's and women's team both feature a legitimate contender for an in­dividual national champion in seniors Yehuda Kovacs and Molly Sullivan. Kovacs, who missed an undefeated 1987 reg­ular season by just one touch in a 5-4 loss in February, raised his career record to 100-7 in last weekend's action.

"That disrupted our offen­sive game inside. We wanted to get them to leave their feet. We wanted to ball-fake inside. This was an ACC crew, and I didn't understand their inter­pretation. This is the first time we've had that problem all year with that call." 
Irish center Gary Voce, who finished with 13 points, nine from the free throw line, agreed that it was a key factor in Notre Dame's early woes. 
"It had some effect in the first half," Voce said. "Our gameplan was to ball-fake and shoot or ball-fake and drive. We knew they'd jump (on the fake). We had six turnovers on that, so we had to stop and be more cautious." 
In the second half, the Irish made several runs at the Terps, but couldn't close it out. Notre Dame cut the lead to three at 61-58 with 6: 13 left to

"It's frustrating to lose," Rivers, who finished with a game high 27, said. "You've got to keep your composure and go down and score the next time. You have to try to stop them on defense and try to get the momentum back in our favor."

Ditka, NO's Page 
-... in Hall of Fame 

Associated Press 
CANTON, Ohio -Mike Ditka said it really wasn't fair to have had as much fun as he did playing football and still be elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. 
The Chicago Bears coach was elected Tuesday along with Fred Biletnikoff, Jack Ham and Alan Page. 
"It's mind-boggling," said Ditka, who played 12 years in the NFL as a tight end. 
Biletnikoff, a flanker with the Oakland Raiders famed for his timing and exacting pass routes, said, "I can't tell you how excited I am. It's a big, big thrill for me." 
Ham, a key performer in the Pittsburgh Steelers' "Steel Curtain" during four Super Bowl victories in the 1970s, said, "I'm ecstatic. I'm going in with some pretty good com­pany." 
Page, a cornerstone at defen­sive tackle on the Minnesota Vikings' famed "Purple People Eaters" defense, said, "(My) whole career was a highlight." 
Ditka, 48, out of the Univer­sity of Pittsburgh, was named NFL rookie of the year in 1961 after catching 56 passes for 1,076 yards and 12 touchdowns. Three years later, he had 75 catches, a record for tight ends that stood for 16 years. 
The 6-foot-3, 225-pound native of Carnegie, Pa., did not miss a start in 84 games with the Bears and earned All-Pro honors his first four seasons. He had 427 receptions for 5,812 yards and 43 touchdowns in his career. 
After being traded to Philadelphia in 1967, Ditka finished his career with four seasons at Dallas. In 1971, he had 30 receptions and scored the clinching touchdown in the Cowboys' 24-3 victory over the Miami Dolphins in the 1972 Super Bowl. 
Biletnikoff, who will turn 45 later this month, spent 14 years with the Raiders. The 6--1, 190­pound flanker caught 589 passes -seventh best all-time ­for 8,974 yards and 76 touch­downs. 
The native of Erie, Pa., caught 40 or more passes for 10 straight seasons, and his 70 catches for 1,167 yards and 10 touchdowns in 19 postseason games were records at the time of his retirement 
Biletnikoff, now an assistant coach with Calgary of the Canadian Football League, caught four passes for 79 yards to set up three Oakland scores in a 32-14 victory over Min­nesota in the 1977 Super Bowl and was named the game's most valuable player. 
Ham, 39, missed only four games in his first 10 seasons in the NFL. The outside linebacker from Penn State finished a 12-year career with 25-and-a-half sacks, 21 fumble recoveries and 32 intercep­tions. 
Ham, who is a salesman for a coal company and also a radio analyst on NFL games, traced his success to Joe Paterno, his college coach. 
"I was a young kid who didn't have a lot of confidence until I went to Penn State. Paterno ... he's the kind of guy who put me on first team defense in my first year. It kind of made me a little more confident," he said. 
Page, a 42-year-old native of Canton, home of the Hall of Fame, became the first defen­sive player to be named NFL most valuable player in 1971. He was the NFC's defensive player of the year four times and was an all-league choice nine years in a row. 
Page, now a staff lawyer for the Minnesota Attorney Gen­eral's office, said of his selec­tion: "I don't know if it's about time, but it's certainly a nice time." 
A graduate of Notre Dame, Page was the Vikings' second pick in the first round of the first combined AFL-NFL draft in 1967. A defensive end in col­lege, he was moved to defen­sive tackle by the Vikings. 
He played 238 games, all but three as a starter, for the Vikings and Bears. Unofficial statistics show Page blocked 28 kicks and had 164 sacks during his 15 seasons. In 1976, he had a career-high 21-and-a-half sacks. Page never missed a game during his career.

The Observer I Mike Moran Matt Hanzel fires a shot on goal earlier this Irish to an lmpresslve19-2-2 record thus far. Pete season. The junior left wing has helped lead the Sklko features him below. 


High-scoring junior Hanzel adds needed punch 
By PETE SKIKO Sports Writer 
If you would have asked Matt Hanzel two years ago what he'd be doing now, he probably wouldn't have said that he'd be the second-line left wing of the 19-2-2 Notre Dame hockey team. 
In fact, the word 'hockey' probably would not have even been mentioned. 
Hanzel, a 6-1, 175-pound na­tive of St. Paul, MN., was heav­ily recruited for both hockey and baseball out of Cretin High School, and came to Notre Dame fully expecting to chase baseballs, not hockey pucks. 
"I played first base in the fall of my freshman year,'' said the junior left winger, "and I came out to the last day of hockey tryouts to talk to (then-Irish hockey coach) Lefty Smith. I told him I had decided on baseball, but he talked me into at least trying out, with no strings attached. I felt great out on the ice again, met some super guys, and switched sports right there." 
Smith recognized Hanzel's potential, and as a freshman Hanzel saw action in 28 games, scoring two goals and and as­sisting on five others. Last year, despite playing in only 25 of the team's 30 games, Hanzel was third on the Irish in scoring, with 25 points (ten goals, 15 assists). 

This year, in 22 games, Han­zel already has 29 points but is sixth on the team in scoring. Matt says that is a great sign for both him and the team. 
"It's good for me because I'm scoring at a pretty good pace," said Hanzel. "But it's better for the team that more people are scoring above me. In 23 games we've already scored 150 (actually, 156) more goals than we did all last year in 30 games. 
"It's exciting playing on the team this year. We haven't played the toughest schedule, and that might keep us out of the NCAA's. But we seem to know how to win this year. We don't panic when we get into trouble anymore because everyone is confident in our ability to come back." 
Hanzel gives a lot of credit to his linemates, sophomore Tim Kuehl and junior Brian Montgomery. 
"Tim and I have worked to­
gether for two years now," said 
Hanzel, "including over the 
summer. There's a real good 
chemistry between Brian and 
us on the line. Each of us knows 
where the others will be on the 
ice at any time. I think most of 
the guys on the team can 
honestly say that we don't lose 
too much as we go down our 
first three lines." 
Hanzel, who has 13 goals, 16 
assists, and one game-winning 
goal to his credit this year, en­joys this year even more when thinking back to seasons past. 
"It's always been fun to play here," said Hanzel. "The guys were always great and I've never regretted it. But whereas there were a few days during the last couple of seasons when I didn't really want to drag myself to practice, this year there is an attitude on the team that we can win, and so prac­tices are more than bearable." 

Matt has nothing but good things to say about first-year Irish head coach Ric Schafer, who so far has led the Irish to one of their best seasons ever. 
"Coach Schafer has done so much with the program in just one year," said Hanzel. "With the scholarship situation (ten scholarships over four years), a tough but more respectable schedule next year, and the way he can relate to the players, it's hard to expect anything more from him. 
"Since the prospects are pretty slim for making the NCAA tournament, of course my goals for the team is to win the rest of the games this season and then take the (ACHA) conference tourna­ment. It's more than possible, and it would be good for the team's confidence next year if we wrap up the year with only two losses. Next year, we lose a lot of key seniors, so I hope I can gear up for a really big season."

Irish lose to Maryland 78-75 
Women get shot at defending champs 
as late rally falls just short 
By DENNIS CORRIGAN Sports Editor 
Sometimes you dig and dig only to realize you've gone to deep. Then you can't get out. 
The Notre Dame basketball team experienced that situa­tion Tuesday night, falling 78-75 to Maryland. Trailing by as much as 15 in the first half and 13 in the second to the Terps, the Irish couldn't extricate themselves from the hole that poor shooting, 9-of-26 in the first half (.346), had dug for them. 
Maryland, on the other hand, was red hot, shooting 57 per­cent in the first half (16-of-28) and 59 percent (16-of-27) in the second. 
"We couldn't stop their out­side scoring or their inside scoring," said Irish head coach Digger Phelps, whose squad suffered its second-straight defeat in falling to 12-6. "We

Facing the defending NCAA cham­pion is nothing new to the Notre Dame women's basketball program. Having a chance to win is. · 
Tonight the 12-5 Irish host fourth­ranked Tennessee, the defending cham­pions of women's college basketball. The Lady Vols come into the Joyce ACC with a 16-2 record, losing only to fifth­ranked Texas and third-ranked Auburn. Last season en route to their coronation as NCAA queens, the Lady Vols thumped Notre Dame 90-55 before the Irish began a season-ending six­game winning streak. 
The 1987-88 Irish are certainly not the Irish-of-old who were trounced by the NCAA champs last year. First-year head coach Muffet McGraw has Notre Dame pressing on defense and running on offense, while at the same time

got in a hole, came back and had a couple of key plays at the end where we had a chance to cut it to one, but the best we could do was get down to three." 
The Irish never led in the game and while their shots weren't fqlling, those of Brian Williams (who finished with 18 on 8-of-12 shooting) and Tony Massenburg (16, 7-of-8) were dropping from inside. 
"We wanted to get it inside to Williams and Massenburg," said Terrapin head man Bob Wade, whose squad now stands at 11-6. "I thought Williams played fantastically both offen­sively and defensively." 
Complementing the Terps potent inside attack was the outside shooting of Teyone McCoy and Rudy Archer, both of whom finished with 10 points. 
For the Irish, it was another frustrating loss, as they could

"Teams like Kentucky and Maryland are just too good to be getting down to," said soph­omore guard Joe Fredrick, whose play against the Wildcats earned him a starting nod against the Terps. "This team is too good to be having mental breakdowns at key times. They were getting good shots, while ours seemed to be contested." 
The first half was all Maryland. The Terps roared to a 25-12lead with 9:50 to play in the opening half. Massenburg had come off the bench to drop in eight points. The Irish were hindered by blocked shots and walking calls on the inside, calls that Phelps took excep­tion with.

Vols' Summitt has done it all 
By THERESA KELLY Sports Writer 

Who says you can't have it all? 
In the world of coaching, Tennessee's 
head women's basketball coach Pat 
Summitt has it all: 11 consecutive 20­
victory seasons with the Lady Volun­
teers, eight Final Four appearances, 
one national championship (1987) and 
five gold medals in international com­
petition, including the greatest victory 
of them all, a gold medal in the 1984 
Olympic Games. 

''That was really an honor,'' Summitt 
says of the Olympic job. "It was as big 
a challenge as I've ever faced. Looking 
back, it was more stressful and de­
manding than I realized at the time. I 
wouldn't trade it for anything, but I 
wouldn't do it again." 

In 13 years at Tennessee, Summitt 
has given "the women's basketball pro­
gram her all, establishing a 33fi-104 
record (18-2 this season) coming into

ND fencing 
At a University which so covets national cham­pionships, it is ironic that Notre Dame's last two national titles have produced such little hoopla. And it is still ironic as the Irish men's and women's fencing teams quietly chase the top spot aga~n in 1988. But that is the nature of fencing, it seems. 
Fencing has never been much of a spectator sport. With masked competitors and several bouts occur­ring at the same time, the sport is both anonymous and decentralized. Let's just say there will never be TV timeouts in fencing. 
But that does not preclude the idea that fencing can't grip an audience, because certainly the inten­sity and concentration in fencing can be as addictive as that of any other athletic event. 
In late March the Notre Dame campus will be the site of the 1988 Junior World Fencing Champion­ships. Branded as the "training grounds for future Olympians," by Notre Dame men's fencing coach Mike DeCicco, the Championships have been held in the Western Hemisphere just five times in its 39-year history. Three of those times it has been held here at Notre Dame. 
Before the world's best converge on South Bend, some of the nation's most talented collegiate fen­cers will come to Notre Dame this weekend. The

For the men's team and DeCicco, it is a chance to continue a 90-meet winning streak which stretches back to 1984. On the other hand, for the women and head coach Yves Auriol it is a chance to begin ~other win streak

after Wayne State narrowly defeated the Irish last weekend to snap the women's string of 50 consecu­tive victories over three years. 
DeCicco graduated from Notre Dame in 1949 and has been here ever since, becoming the men's fen­cing coach in 1962. Auriol graduated from Lycee de Toulouse in Toulouse, France in 1955 and came to Notre Dame just two years ago. But these different backgrounds have combined to make Notre Dame a powerhouse in men's and women's fencing. With four NCAA championships (one for the women, three for the men), Notre Dame fencing has become as dominating as any team in Irish history in any sport, including the football 'Glory Years.' 
Among fencing circles, there is little doubt that DeCicco is the dean of college coaches. His Admin­istration Building office, where he serves as Aca­demic Advisor for Notre Dame athletes, is filled with hardware recognizing his contributions to the University and the fencing world. His accomplish­ments are seemingly endless. 
Coach of three national championship teams (1977, 1978, 1986), eight undefeated teams and 23 All-Americans. Coach of the Year in 1966, 1975 and 1977. A career record of 502-40 for an incredible .926 winning percentage. Though comparisons are often trite and misused, DeCicco is undoubtedly the Knute Rockne of Notre Dame fencing. 
In less than three years, Auriol has begun to create a legacy of his own. Last March, the Irish won Notre Dame's only national championship in a women's sport by capturing the title in the NCAA Tournament held here on campus. Before last week's 9-7loss to Wayne State, Auriol had a perfect
