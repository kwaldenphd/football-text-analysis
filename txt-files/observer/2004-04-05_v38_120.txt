Protests prompt Taco Bell response 
University has not reacted to PSA inquiries about marketing relationship 
By ClAIRE HEININGER 
News Editor 
A publicized hunger strike last week by freshman Antonio Hivas and a protest outside of a Taco Bell restaurant Friday received a corporate statement from Taco Bell but have yet to lead to an official response from the University. 
Both the demonstration ­which brought about 50 chant­ing and sign-waving students and scattered faculty members to the intersection of Lafayette Boulevard and LaSalle Street -and the hunger strike were carried out to coincide with the end of the National Student Week of Action, but organizers said their struggle is ongoing. 
"[Rivas]'s hunger strike is over, National Student Week of Action is over, but our fight is not over," said Melody Gonzalez, a leader in the protest. 
Friday's demonstration was the latest in a string of weekly protests titled "Fair Food Fridays" started by the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW) in April 2001. The campaign aims to con­vince customers to boycott Taco Bell due to alleged unfair labor standards and wages for the migrant workers who pick tomatoes for the chain's sup-

Republican plan might affect ND's financial aid 
By SHEILA FLYNN Senior StaffWrirer 
A Hepublican-backed plan to redistribute financial aid alloca­tions to universities could aiTect Notre Dame in the future, but changes would most likely not be immediate or insurmountable, said Joseph Husso, director of student financial services. 
"There's been a rising level of interest to try to rectify what appears to be a procnss that doesn't seem to work," Husso said. 
The President George W. Bush­backed proposal calls for a decrease in federal education money sent to wmtlthier universi­ties with a smaller percentage of low-income students, instead of allocating more funds to institu­tions in which a larger population of low-income students are enrolled. In a March 26 article, The New York Times reported that several Ivy League schools, for example, receive government amounts significantly larger than the median sum given to univer­sities across the nation. Supporters of the aid revision plan charge that such esteemed and rich schools have secured these amounl'> because they were better able to negotiate or were more experienced in navigating red tape and paperwork. 
Russo, who has been monitor­ing the financial aid develop­ments since the 1960s, said more savvy university administrations definitely did have the upper hand in the past -especially in the "earlier years," circa 1965, when schools were required to complete a "very, very complicat­ed application." 
He said this diiTicult application procedure was changed in the

Off-campus porch incidents raise no resident concern 
By KATE GALES News Writer 
While a high profile balcony collapse during a party in Chicago last surnnwr Jell 13 dead and 30 injured. Notre Dame students said they are not concerned that a similar incident could take place at ofT-campus apartment cornplnxns. 
llowever, there have been at least three recent incidents where stucllmts partying have fallen oil' of balconies, including at St. Patrick's Day parties at the College Park apartment complex both this year and last year and a party this fall at the '1\Jrtle Creek apartment complex. 
For students, these incidents have caused more concern than the possibility of a balcony col­lapse. 
"It has never really crossed our minds -we never have that many people out there that it's a weight concern," said Lindsay Wind. a senior who lives in College Park. "Before all of this started to come up, I probably wouldn't even think about it. Usually it's not what you're think­ing about when you're having a party." 
"It's not something we're con­cerned about," said fellow resi­dent Lindsay Zika. "Most of our friends know how to be safe. 
People like to hang out there; it's never been an issue for us." 
Patty Russwurm, a property manager with Paramount Management. the company that manages College Park, said she is not aware of any other incidents at College Park when a partier had fallen off a balcony during the last two years that Paramount has managed the property. 
Though less publicized, Turtle Creek Apartments has also faced a problem with irresponsible bal­cony use, according to property manager Tammy Michelbrink.

INSIDE COLUMN 

All about ICPA 
This weekend was the stuff of which legends are made. 
The Observer staff took its annu­al trip to ICPA (the Indiana Collegiate Press Association) con­vention, but in reporting back

ism and heavy on scandal. 

ICPA is an opportunity for aspir­ing journalists from the state to attend workshops and panels, and then enjoy a lunch and awards cer­emony. But I guess since The Observer is traditionally snubbed at these awards in favor of papers whose "big story" is the theft of its April Fools edition over a year ago, our staff generally sees the week­end as an opportunity for bonding before the new term. 
Upon our arrival in Muncie, Ind., we enjoyed dinner together. Then, true to form. we returned to the hotel to begin the night's festivities. 
At 9:30 p.m., since we had already received several warning phone calls from the front desk (due to the oversensitivity of the woman staying below). we decided to go swimming. The water was warm and over-chlorinated, and we were ready for a return to our younger days of pool games. Let's just say that my arms still hurt from the chicken fighting. 
After being told that chicken fighting was indeed NOT allowed in the hotel pool, it was time to return upstairs, where some of us changed into pajamas, and some of us took 45 minutes to get ready for a simple game of Never Have I Ever. 
Never Have I Ever is a game in which things you never wanted to know about your friends are revealed for all the world to know. I can now say I'm definitely closer to my fellow staffers because I know of their secret hook-ups and embarrassing moments. 
After the games ended, the debauchery continued, and I was able to find out even more little­known facts about my friends. 
I now know that a certain friend of mine can impersonate a ptero­dactyl flawlessly and doesn't have the slightest problem mooning the rest of us in a hotel room -or in the hotel hallway. 
And I also know that, even though someone may look very easy to pick up, I won't be able to do it when she needs to be dragged into our room from the hallway. 
Finally, I know that, no matter what you may hear, at no point did two of our female staffers make out -sorry guys. 
The next day, The Observer once again was severely underappreciat­ed (probably because we don't con­tinue to beat the dead horse of paper theft.) 
But that doesn't matter, because it's Friday night that counts any­way.

pliers in Florida. 
Taco Bell employees provided a corporate memo to cus­tomers, and protesters did not intrude onto company property to seek further response. 
The statement, signed by Laurie Schalow of the Taco Bell Corp., details the history of Taco Bell's dialogue with the CIW and claims that all condi­tions of the company's Supplier Code of Conduct have been met, including specific anti­slave labor language and a $9 minimum wage for farm employees. 
"[The CIWJ think that if we simply charge our customers more money for our products, we can pay more money for the ingredients and this will some­how trickle into their pay­checks." the memo states. "That is a fallacy." 
The statement said that the free market, not Taco Bell, was responsible for determining produce prices. and said the restaurant was being unfairly targeted in -a "labor dispute" between tomato suppliers and their workers. 
However, Progressive Student Alliance member and protest participant Brigitte Gynther refuted the restaurant's argu­ment of detachment, saying that since the corporation is capable of initiating anti-slav­ery legislation, it can also play a role in labor disputes between tomato providers and migrant workers. 
"Major buyers do have power to impose regulations," she said. "Taco Bell only needs to charge 1/4 cent more per item been delivered to Malloy by the to pay a penny more per weekend, University pound" of tomatoes -the tar­spokesman Matt Storin said the get figure to president was achieve and traveling out of exceed minimum "Every day you town and was wage. unaware of the

"You'd have to pick a whole lot of buckets to make $9 an hour," she said. "Anyone who picks tomatoes can tell you that's not true." 
Despite Taco Bell's insistence of uninvolvement, Gonzalez said that she and fellow mem­bers of the PSA planned to con­tinue flooding the offices and Sorin Hall residence of University President Edward Malloy with copies of a letter asking the University to refuse to renew its marketing rela­tionship with the restaurant. 
The letter also expresses sup­port for Rivas' hunger strike and asks for Notre Dame to address several different fronts. including its standards of eval­uating members of the Board of Trustees.

when he received the Eucharist at a small mass service in St. Edward's Hall. He claimed that encouragement from peers and campus work­ers helped him maintain his motivation during the last few days of the strike. 
"That's what kept me going -it was unbelievable," Rivas said. "I just want to see [the University] take more responsi­bility for their actions ... [and] be more socially conscious." 
The University has met with PSA members repeatedly dur­ing the school year to discuss concerns about the Taco Bell marketing relationship and committed to reviewing the sit­uation in February, but has not issued a statement since. 
Members of PSA criticized the delay, saying that the adminis­tration is wasting time with dis­cussion in place of acti"n. Gynther said that a public statement of the evaluation was overdue. 

"Justice delayed is justice denied," she said. "Every day you don't do something is another day farm workers are poor ... [the University has] had plenty of time." 
She added that she hoped a public statement would be issued before Easter. 
Gonzalez agreed, claiming Notre Dame's Catholic priorities obligate the University to go beyond researching labor prac­tices and terminate its contract. 
"The best thing Notre Dame can do is take action," she said. "It is a research institution but also an institution of society, and it has to respond to the injustices of society."

Fighting rages in four Iraqi cities in response to arrest of 21-year-old cleric

NAJi\F, Iraq Supporters of an anti­American cleric rioted in four Iraqi cities Sunday, battling coalition troops in the worst unrest since the spasm of looting and arson immediately after the fall of Saddam llussein. At least 22 Iraqis. eight U.S. troops and one Salvadoran soldier died.

Head of Madrid attack dies in blast 
Associated Press 

MADHID, Spain -The suicide apartment house blast that killed the alleged ringleader of last month's Madrid train bombings and four other terror suspects left the core of the terror group either dead or in jail, Spain's interior minister said on Sunday. 
Explosives discovered in the building where the five killed them­selves to avoid capture Saturday night indicated they were plotting more violence and were linked to the failed bombing of a high-speed rail line Friday. 
Two or three suspects may have escaped before blast, which also 
killed a special forces officer and wounded 15 other policeman, Interior Minister Angel Acebes told a news conference. 
Preliminary forensic tests on human remains in and around the apartment showed that five sus­pects had died in the blast, one more than previously reported, an Interior Ministry official said Sunday. 
Sarhane Ben Abdelmajid Fakhet, a 35-year-old Tunisian accused of spearheading the March 11 attacks that killed 191 people, was among those who died in the explosion in Leganes south of Madrid, Acebes said. 
"The core of the group that car­ried out the attacks is either arrest­ed or dead in yesterday's collective suicide, including the head of the operative commando unit," Acebes said. 
Fifteen suspects arc already in custody in the Madrid attacks. Six have been charged with mass mur­der and nine with collaborating with or belonging to a terrorist organization. 
The 22 pounds of dynamite and 200 detonators found in the apart­ment are the same as that used in the March 11 attacks and in the bomb that was discovered Friday before it could explode along the high-speed rail line between Madrid and Seville, Acebes said.

Both complexes also limit to the number of adults allowed on the balconies -eight at College Park and five at Thrtle Creek.

The property managers said they do not supervise residents, but are aware that some lease­holders may be using the bal­conies irresponsibly. 
"We have seen people have too many people on their bal­conies," Michelbrink said, "but we're not here to monitor every night to see what they do." 
When it comes to manage­ment's attention that the con­tracts are being violated with this type of behavior, notices are sent out to offenders, Michelbrink said. Continued problems could cost them their leases.

early 1980s in an attempt to make it more fair, requiring uni­versities to fill out only a single sheet of paper. 
"[The process changed] for the very reason not only that it was too complicated, but also to try and remove from the process what clearly had become known as grantsmanship," Russo said. 
"Those who knew how to get the money were advantaged." 
Despite the fact that the process was simplified, however, Russ0 said levels of funds were "grand­fathered" to ensure that "those institutions that historically had been getting dollars" would still be able to support their schools and their students. 
"The grandfathering factor still remains very significant in the funding process, all the way up to today," Husso said. 
He also said that a main compo­nent of aid allocation relates to a school's tuition, and Notre Dame's cost guarantees aid to students who might not necessarily qualify elsewhere. 
"If some were enrolled at the local community college, they might not be eligible," Russo said. 
"What this comes down to is a pretty basic policy matter: Is fed­eral student aid intended to pro­vide access or access and choice?" 
Another factor prompting the new proposal is the appearance of more proprietary schools across the country, Russo said. 
"A lot of new schools have entered the process, proprietary schools," he said. "Because so much of the funding is already set aside, they're left with not as much opportunity. Some of the lowest income students today are enrolled in those types of institu­tions." 
If the government does decide to increase aid to these types of institutions and limit funding to Notre Dame, Russo said the fman­cial dent will be felt, but it will not affect all types of aid. Money from Stafford and Pellloans, for exam­ple, comes with students and is not directly distributed by the University. 
"We're involved with the process of getting them [students] money here, but they bring both of those programs here to the tune of millions of dollars annual­ly," Russo said. 
"The kind of money they're talking about refers to the other three of the campus-based federal student aid programs." 

These campus-based programs include a grant, a loan and work­study, Russo said. 
"Ten percent of the current fed­eral dollars this year are what we're talking about," Russo said. 
"One hundred thirty-five million is being administered for under­graduate total student financial aid; 35 million is federal; of the 35 million federal, about 3.5 million of that -10 percent -would be through this campus-based feder­al allocation process," the process being revised, Russo said. 
The impact would be signifi­cant, he said, but not disastrous. 
"The federal dollars here are significant, but they're not the only dollars," Russo said. 
He predicted that, if the changes do occur, they would not hit the University at once; rather, they will be instituted as a "phase-out," H.usso said. And, given time and reconsideration of policies, he said he believes the University would figure out a solution. 
"If that [aid] were to totally dis­appear, we think we would still be able to manage," Russo said.

Stocks climb due to job report 
More than 300,000 jobs created, Dow posts best performance since April 2003 
Associated Press 

NEW YOHK -Pleased with a better-than-expected jobs report, investors sent stocks higher on Wall Street, setting aside worries on the potential for higher interest rates to focus on the 308,000 jobs created in March. 
The day capped Wall Street's best week so far this year. The Dow posted its best weekly performance since April 28, 2003, and the Nasdaq saw its strongest weekly gain since May 13, 2002. 
The Labor Department employment report also included upward revisions in the January and February figures. For the quarter, the economy added a total of 513,000 jobs. 
"You certainly can't call this a jobless recovery any more," said Joseph Battipaglia, chief invest­ment officer at Hyan Beck & Co. 
The unemployment rate, however, rose to 5.7 percent in March from 5.6 percent in February as more people came back into the job mar­ket. That could help ease the eoncerns of some investors that the Federal Heserve may speed up its timetable for raising rates.

Father Jim King, is the starting 
point for all those interested in 
religious life. From there, men can 
choose either the Old College pro­
gram if they are undergraduates 
or the candidate program if they 
are seniors in college or have 
already graduated. 
The Oid College program allows those interested in the priesthood to experience Notre Dame's on­campus life for three years before they move to Moreau for their senior year. 
"There was definitely a call in 
my life to the ministry and priest­
hood that I could no longer ignore, 
and Old College gave me the 
opportunity to answer it without 
sacrificing an undergrad experi­
ence," Notre Dame junior Jake 
Grenier said. 
After their third year at Old College, the students move into Moreau, where they are joined by older candidates in the program just deciding to join the seminary. 
"During the Candidate year, the men get a feel for the life of prayer, study, commitment and apostolic works," Moreau rector Father Wilson Miscamblc said. 
The following year -called the novitiate -is spent in an intense, retreat-like environment outside of Colorado Springs, Colo. that features manual labor. prolonged periods of silence and personal prayer and introspection. 
After this experience, the men make their first vows and return as the newly-professed to begin theological studies for the Master of Divinity program. Three to four years later, the seminarians peti­tion to become deacons and take their final vows during an ordina­tion ceremony. 
This year, six men will enter into the ranks of the Holy Cross com­munity that spans across the globe and is rooted on the banks of St. Joseph's Lake. For many of them, the journey to the final vows begins at Old College, where young men discern their future under the watch of priests past and present. 
Welcome to the 'O.C.' 
"Once at a party in Farley, a girl was looking for a group of Old Collegians that were supposed to come, and when she saw some guys sitting quietly in the corner, she assumed it was them. Thrns out they were from Alumni," laughed Old College freshman Joe Wysocki. "My friend told me that story -it basically sums up how a lot of students of campus see us over here at Old College." 
Seven undergraduates -many of whom have contemplated the priesthood for years -live and study in Old College along with seminarian Tom King and Father Charles Gordon. 
According to Grenier, the small group of men with common goals is a great draw to the program. 
"There's a different atmosphere here, like a house. You get to know people on a different level," added Wysocki. . 
Like other undergrads, the Old Collegians go through the normal track of courses and majors. but must additionally complete 24 credit hours of philosophy and 12 credit hours of theology. They can join clubs, play on intcrhall teams and study abroad. 
And what about the question on everyone's mind? 
"Dating is a grey area," Wysocki . said. "It's acceptable and you shouldn't deny it, but the general rule is you don't look for it. It's all part of discernment." 
More stringent parietals, which begin at 11 p.m. on weekdays and 1 a.m. on weekends, and the restriction of female visitors to the basement and first floor make it harder for the couple as docs the 
Old Collegian's commitment, said 
King. 

"The goal L<> to try to work into living the vows, and by the time they get to Moreau, they can't date," King said. "llonestly. I would think it'd b1~ more dillicult on the person dating the Old Collegian because most times, in the end .Jesus wins out." 
Though their families and friends are. as a whole, supportive of their decision, the Old Collegians must deal with miscon­ceptions and ignorance from those who know nothing about the pro­gram. 
"When I first meet people and say, 'lley, I live in Old College!' I get a lot of 'What's that? Who's that? Whore's that?"' Tucker said. "llonestly, we're regular stu­dents, we do regular things. we have fun too." 
Though regular studenl<> at Old College, their lives take an excep­tional turn as they make the next step in their journey to priesthood. Across the pond at Moreau 
"This is our 'Wall of Fame,' if you will," said Miscamble, gestur­ing proudly down the hallway lined with pictures of the semi­nary's past ordained. 
From among the black and white photos appear such well­known faces as Father Edward Malloy and Father Mark Poorman -constant reminders of the high standard of achievement expected of those living and studying in Moreau. 
Centered around what seminar­
ian Greg !Iaake calls the "three 
pillars" -common prayer, com­
mon table and study -life within 
the walls of Moreau is a struc­
tured combination of introspection 
and interaction with the other 
professed and those in the outside 
community. 

For the men in the formation program, Moreau is a place to seek support during what can be a long and trying process. 
"It takes serious consideration to take vows of poverty, chastity and obedience [that arc required of seminarians and priests [. Poverty and obedience are just as hard as chastity. Each day a dif­ferent one can be diiTicult," I Iaake said. "The support of your broth­ers helps you live your vows, because you're all in it together." 
Though the men have the option to quit the program at any time before taking their final vows, the mere prospect of spending years in the prolonged formation pro­gram dissuades many from taking the chance. 
"The way I sec it, formation is sort of like dating. You don't get married before you date, in the same way you want to live the life before you commit yourself to it," said Tom Smith. a May 2003 grad­uate of Notre Dame and new can­didate. 
The seminarians spoke highly about the feeling of family within the Iloly Cross order that drew them to Moreau, and Haake admitted that a visit to Moreau was all it took to alleviate his mother's reservations about his decision to enter the priesthood. 
Life across the lake, however, has il<> drawbacks as well. 
"The single biggest challenge is the fact that it's institutional living. with a big kitchen and common baths," Koeth said. "There are times when that can wear on you, even though the sense of family helps make it more of a home." 
Unlike common perception, Moreau is a place for men to dL<>­ccrn whether the call to priest­hood is right for them. and even those with the slightest question in their mind are encouraged to join. 
"If you're thinking about the priesthood, as Jesus said to Andrew, 'Come and sec,"' Koetl1 said.

Targeted killings must end 




News Amanda Michaels 
ScottBrodfeuhrer 
Eile~n DUffy Graphics 


SiBce the start of the second intifada in September 2000, many Palestinians, frustrated by diplomacy's failure to achieve any progress, have turned to more violent means to try to attain Palestinian statehood. In 
Greg Parnell 
response, Israel has taken a more militant stance as Ideas, Issues well, using targeted and killings and other Ideologuesconfrontational methods to try to end the terrorist threat and provide a sense of security for its citizens. According to Israel, these operations are necessary in order to protect its citizens. From the Arab viewpoint, they are brutal murders of political leaders intended to suppress the Palestinians' ability to organize a legitimate independence movement. 
This situation leaves the United States in somewhat of an awkward position. As Israel's closest ally and primary supplier of weapons and eco­nomic aid, the American government typically does everything it can to help Israel. However, our nation follows a policy prohibiting assassinations of any kind. Therefore, should the global community reach a consensus that Israel's targeted killings are indeed forms of assassination, the United States will be left treading a thin line of conflicting loyalties. Furthermore, even if such a consensus is not reached, it is important that our gov­ernment be willing to take measures against Israel, should targeted killings put our interests in the Middle East at risk. 
In support of the Israeli policy, there is some evidence that targeted killings do inhibit terrorist operations. In the early years of Israel's independence, terrorist infiltration from Egypt less­ened as a result of a strike on Egyptian intelligence officers. In the 1960s, Israeli mail bombs sent to Egyptian scientists effectively termi­nated President Gamal Abdel Nasser's plans to construct missiles capable of reaching Israel. Finally, the 199 5 assassination of Islamic Jihad leader Fathi Shikaki left a power vacuum in the terrorist organization that under­mined the effectiveness of this group for several years. 
On the other hand, there are equally strong arguments that targeted killings are not only ineffective, but may actually encourage terrorism. As Israel has increased its use of target­ed killings to a higher rate than ever, record numbers of Israeli civilians have become victims of Palestinian attacks. Numerically, about 600 Israelis have been killed during the second intifada, most of whom are civilians. Meanwhile, l-lamas, the most radical group and probably the biggest obstacle to a peace settlement, has grown more popular with every attack. Polls indicate that Israel's bru­tal tactics are pushing large numbers of moderate Palestinians towards the radicals' camp, rather than the other way around. 
Targeted killings give l-lamas ample political cover to continue suicide bombings -attacks that may not have been possible had Israel not pro­vided them with a motive. In May 2003, for example, the Palestinian political organization "Fatah" declared a unilateral cease-fire, with the help of the United States, United Nations, European Union and Russia. l-lamas, not wanting to look like the spoiler of a chance at statehood, called a temporary halt to its opera­tions. However, Israel released only a small portion of the Palestinian pris­oners that were proposed, and did not completely suspend its use of targeted killings. Just months later, suicide bombings were reinstated, officially said to be in direct retaliation for the targeted killings carried out during the months of June and July. The short window of opportunity was missed, and support for l-lamas con­tinued to grow daily. 
Although it may be politically unpopular, it is time for the U.S. gov­ernment to condemn Israel's use of targeted killings and, if necessary, apply diplomatic and economic pres­sures to try to change its policy. A two-state solution to the Arab-Israel conflict is the outcome that best suits America's interests throughout the entire region. However, such a resolu­tion will only arise if popular support among Palestinians shifts away from radical groups and towards more moderate leaders. Currently, Israel's practice of targeted killings is reduc­ing the power of moderate Palestinian voices and increasing the influence of groups like l-lamas. 
The best way to defeat l-lamas is to take away the reason that Palestinians support it. Most Palestinians desire peace and statehood, not the destruc­tion of Israel (which is the stated goal of l-lamas). They support Hamas because they admire the militants' willingness to sacrifice their lives for the Palestinian cause. Therefore, sig­nificant diplomatic progress towards granting Palestine its own state would make the radical acts of l-lamas unnecessary and even detrimental to the cause in the eyes of many Palestinians. 
In order to promote fairness and objectivity, the United States could simultaneously make a more system­atic attempt to reduce corruption in the ranks of the Palestinian Authority. Penalizing the PA for corrupt and dan­gerous policies would lead to a more effective, powerful and more popular leadership. This is the leadership that must be in a position to negotiate with Israel once a cease-fire has been reached. 
The United States has historically been reluctant to condemn Israel. However, the issue of targeted killings is seen by enough people to be wrong that some amount of pressure could be applied without suffering terrible political costs. Temporary bitterness among Israel citizens and pro-Israel groups within the United States would be a small price to pay for subduing the violence and creating a chance for Palestinian moderates to gain power , against the more radical groups. It is time to show the world that we are on the side of peace, not the side of Israel.

The fact is that a large cross-section of the nation does not understand, nor does it wish to under­stand. homosexuality and the issues that surround it. A significant portion of our nation cannot understand why a gay youth would choose to be open about himself, and immediately brands me as an attention-hungry showoff at best or some sort of lurid and sex-mad sodomy­evangelist at worst. 
The saddest truth is that a very small, but vocal, "Christian" minority hates me merely for existing, and if I were to wan­der openly in certain part of the country I might never wander out again. Their mantra and drumbeat, "God hates fag­gots," pounds a steady rhythm in the back of nightmares. 
This is not an easy world to come out into, but coming out is too important to avoid. For what is at stake for me, and what is at stake for other gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgcndered (GLBT) stu­dents, faculty and staff on this campus is much more than politics. While I cannot pretend to speak for the entire GLBT community, even here at Notre Dame, I can speak to my own mind, and I think many would concur. What is at stake here is our identity. 
l'oryousee,Jcannotchangethecen­tral tenets of who I am, no more than any other person, mightiest saint to lowliest sinner, can do so; nor should I be expected to. To reject my identity, to deny what God has -for whatever rea­son-made me to be, is both a grave sin against him, and against myself. Matthew 5:48, a Latin scholar once told me, is properly translated as this: "Be completely what you are, as your heav­enly Father is completely what He is." And yet it is precisely this rejection of self that society, and worst of all the Church, tries to force upon us. 
And yet, hurt as I am by this rejection, 
lETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Continuing social action 
Friday, after the Taco Bell protest downtown, Tony Rivas ate for the first time after a seven-day hunger strike. But the end of his fast and the end of the Week of Action do not mean an end for the fight for justice and the call for Notre Dame to take action. Tony willingly sacrificed his health for one week to call attention to some of the injustices at Notre Dame. We cannot ignore the values in Catholic Social Teaching and Liberation Theology-values that talk about the dignity of work, the right to a living wage, the right to organize, and our call to love and respect all human beings. Notre Dame has a lot of great courses, programs and research about these issues-we must be willing to take action. 
Some of the demands of Tony's hunger strike include: 
-Issue a statement guaranteeing that Notre Dame will not enter into any more contracts with Taco Bell until Taco Bell takes responsibility for the conditions from which its tomatoes come, as determined in conjunction with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers. Every day that the Notre Dame Athletic Department receives money from Taco Bell while failing to pressure them is a day too many. 
-Develop and announce a plan and timeline to ensure that, starting at the beginning of the fall 2004 semester, Fair Trade Coffee is available in both dining halls and other food service out­lets on campus. We understand that Notre Dame's current coffee provider has been planning for some time to release bulk Fair Trade coffee, but every day that we continue to not serve Fair Trade Coffee is a day that coffee farmers and their children starve. 
Students and organizations across the nation are aware of Tony's hunger strike and are also organizing their own actions in solidarity. Tony's sacrifice has also motivated the Coalition of Immokalee Workers to continue fighting for their rights because they know they have people who believe in them and their cause. Tony has started a national movement that is calling students to take action to end the exploitation of workers. · 
As students, consumers and members of society, we have the obligation to take action and demand justice. Notre Dame is now in a position where it can set an example to other universities, that not only does it preach to and teach its students about social justice, but also actively participates in the fight for justice.

I also see the seeds of reparation, for I know this: God did not send his only son to use as a doctrine, or a law, or any scale of justice. He sent a human. This is the heart and soul of all Christian truth. All theology is incarnational theology, and all Catholic truth must be under­stood through the person of Jesus. For only through the person of Jesus does the law obtain life, only through the per­son of Jesus can one see that these are not simply issues of right and wrong to be judged and thrown away, a closed book soon forgotten. These issues have faces, and hearts, and souls. They live and they breathe, they love, laugh, hope, hurt and yearn. This is why, above all else -above justice, above "righteous condemnation"-the most Christian virtue of all is compassion. 
The birthright of every human is this: self-love, respect and dignity. But by calling homosexuality an "objective dis­order" -a useless term which has never been formally defined -it is immediately implied that we have no right to be happy in who we are, no right to be joyful (yes, joyful) that God made us gay or lesbian. For this is what we are and every person has the duty to love himself for what he is. The other road leads only into darkness. 
For this reason, the most insulting arguments are those that would decon­struct this debate down to questions of pure sex. As if life is a two-bit pinball game of who gets to screw whom and how, as if we are so petty that we cannot see·beyond our genitals. Sexuality is not as clear-cut as that; it is holistic, compli­cated, messy, far reaching and confus­ing. Far more than an act performed with another person, it is a large portion of what it means to be a human, and it turns up in many places that are not classically understood as "sexual." 
This is why we struggle for accept­ance; this is why we struggle for formal recognition. This is why we have a sea of orange. A thousand whispered glances and a veil of intolerable silence have stolen our intrinsic dignity from us. For recognition leads-eventually-to understanding, and understanding leads to acceptance and respect. And the day will come when it does not take a young man six years to come to terms with himself because all he could see was a road paved with pain. The day will come when homosexuality is no more remarked upon than a love of music or the ability to sing well. At least, this is my deepest conviction. Time will tell if I am wrong.

Alleviate overall poverty 
John Infranca's April 2 column "Hethinking worldly justice" argues that the parable of the vineyard owner (Matthew 20: 1-16) calls us to an economic standard ofjustice sharply differ­ent from the conventional one. In the parable, those workers who only worked part of the day are paid the same wage as those who worked a full day. lnfranca states that "Hence Jesus presents an understanding ofjustice predicat­ed on giving to individuals based upon their need, not on their 'contribution."' In doing this he takes this parable out of its original context as a parable showing God's mercy and munifi­cence to those who have found God late in their lives. Infranca has instead tried to construct an economic argument out of a parable that has a purely theological meaning. 
However, what we need to further examine is what, exactly, lnfranca is advocating under the guise of Christianity. He seems to be advocating an economic system in which people are not rewarded according to their abilities and con­tributions to society but only according to their needs. This sounds uncannily similar to Karl Marx's dictum "From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs," and this dictum has brought suffering, death and enslavement to millions. It is interesting that many thousands have risked their lives cross­ing the "straits of Florida" to escape the "work­er's paradise" of Cuba, where Marx's dictum is enshrined, when hardly anyone wants to leave the capitalistic United States to get into Cuba. Now, I do not believe for a moment that Infranca is advocating totalitarian communism, but he does seem to be advocating some form of socialism that shares its ideological heritage with communism and Marxism. 
The problem with Infranca's argument is that if everyone were guaranteed the same outcome -no matter if or how hard they worked -no one would want to work. There would be no incentive to get ahead and every incentive to not work. One does not have to look to the totalitarian communism to see the flaws of socialism, either. India is a perfect example of a democratic country with free elections that has pursued socialistic policies of economic planning that have kept India impoverished. Though the intentions of these policies like Mr. Infranca's are good-natured, they have led to misery. 
One may argue that India is suffering from the legacy of colonialism, but let's look at two other jurisdictions that were also British colonies and have done quite well. The former British colonies of Hong Kong and Singapore embraced free markets and now have the high­est standard of living in Asia except for .Japan. There is in fact a direct correlation to per capi­ta income and economic freedom. The United States, Hong Kong and Western Europe arc the most economically free and enjoy the highest standards of living, while countries such as Cuba, Iraq and India are not economically free and are impoverished. In fact, only one third world country, Chile, is rated as economically "free" by the 2004 Heritage l'oundation Index of Economic Freedom, and not one first world country was rated as "mostly unfree" or "repressed." 
If we wish to do the truly Christian thing and work to eradicate poverty, especially in the third world, we must embrace a system that encourages the creation of wealth and not a system that destroys wealth. Though the free market has its problems and should probably be regulated in a few areas it leads to a. healthy, happy and wealthy population. Socialistic policies, however well-intentioned, time and time again have led to misery and poverty, the very ailments the policies were designed to correct. 
As the great Sir Winston Churchill said, "The inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal shar­ing of blessings; the inherent virtue of social­ism is the equal sharing of miseries." Therefore, as Catholics, we should embrace the economic system that leads to plenty and alle­viates overall poverty instead of pursuing poli­cies that only further misery.

Brophy surges, Irish finish fifth 
By ERIC RETTER Sports Writer 
Katie Brophy feels a lot bet­ter about her golf game after this past weekend. She has every right to. 
The sophomore paced the Irish this weekend at the Indiana Invitational with rounds of 74-72-77. leading the team with the second best performance of her college career, a l-over par 223, tying for second place overall out of the field of 95 golfers. 
Brophy attributed her suc­cess to an improved mental side of the game. 
"I was able to focus on one shot at a time and not worry about the total score," she said. 
Irish coach Debby King agreed.

'­
"They were a lot more focused, and it paid off in the end," King said. 
As a team, the Irish finished wen, shooting a combined 46­over par 934 and placing fifth out of a field of 15 strong teams, including familiar foes Indiana and Missouri. Missouri turned in a weekend low 296 on Sunday to claim the title, finishing 26 strokes ahead of the Irish with a 908. 

For the first time in the spring season, King has expressed satisfaction in her team's weekend performance. 
"I was very much pleased; this was a par-74 course, but we were still very close to our goal of 300 each round," King said. 
Behind Brophy, the Notre Dame team was led by junior Karen Lotta, who tied for 17th with individual round scores of 80-76-79, giving her a 235 for the weekend, an individual spring low. Freshmen Noriko Nakazaki and Stacy Brown fol­lowed, tying for 27th and 43rd, respectively. Nakazaki shot a total of 238 with rounds of 73­84-81, and Brown scored 78­86-80 in each round, giving her a total of 244. Sophomore Sarah Bassett finished with a 247 after shooting rounds of 81-82-84, and senior co-cap­tain Rebecca Rogers rounded out the lineup with rounds of 80-82-90 and a total of 252. 
Overall, confidence was the most prevalent theme of the weekend for the Irish team. 
"We had a serious talk about proper practice to be more confident in competition," King said. "A lot of [the team's suc­cess] had to do with a better mental attitude." 
Brophy agreed. 
"I had a lot more confidence with every shot," she said. "Instead of don't hit this [shot] in a bad place, I'd think hit it down the fairway, straight and far. I felt excited as opposed to scared." 
Brophy attributes the newly found mental edge to more productive practices in the week leading up to the tourna­ment. 
"Practice has been a lot more structured, and we've been using our time more wisely," she said. 
For the Irish, it appears as though the poise they demon­strated this past weekend could potentially snowball, giv­ing the team the mental edge that could help the team reach its first ever NCAA tournament. 
"We're much more positive, and I definitely think it's a step in the right direction," Brophy said.

UConn's Okafor in spotlight of Finals 
Associated Press SAN ANTONIO-Few people draw the distinction between life and basketball more clearly than Emeka Okafor, the star center for Connecticut. The son of a man who grew up in war-ravaged Nigeria, Okafor has led an easy life by comparison, and he's the first to concede that. "My dad's high school educa­tion was interrupted by a civil war and they weren't sure they were going to eat the next day," Okafor said. "And here I am in the United States won­dering what I'm going to get for Christmas." On Monday, Okafor will lead UConn against Georgia Tech in the national final, hoping to push the Huskies to one half of a possible sweep of the men's and women's championships. The Connecticut women beat Minnesota 67-58 Sunday night to advance to the champi­onship game. A win for the guys would mark the crowning achieve­ment on the basketball court

This course will introduce students to a broad view ofearly American social history that foregrounds the gendered aspects ofwork in Early America-defined loosely a.s the period from colonial settlement to r82o. On one level, this approach allows for the recovety ofwomen and girls' con­tributions to the formal and inf()rmal economies ofpre-Industrial early America, including their work activities within the household. This perspective is especially crucial to the examination ofwhite, Indian and African servimde and/or slavery since gender ideologies dictated the work experiences of large race-and cla..,s-detlned segment<; of the population. Yet culmral retention also played a part and this course will invite students to investigate the impact ofderivative work practices (t<x example examining African women's dominance of market activities in the New World through the lens of West Ati·ican work practices). Further, while the course title emphasizes women's experiences, the class and race implications of male work practices in early America will be similarly illuminated by a gender studies approach. Thus, an overarching purpose of the course will be to highlight the fluid and instable conceptions ofwork that were applied alternately to masculine a_<; opposed to feminine occupations, just as they were alternately applied to European versus non-European, free versus enslaved, and public·versus private sphere.,.

This course explores American \vorkers' collective effort<; as workers in their search for economic security, political power, and social and cultur­al autonomy ti·om the 1S9os to the near present. For the most patt, this course will focus on the unions and related organizations forged by workers throughout the past centul)·-from major umbrella groups like the American Federation of Labor, the Industrial Workers of the World, and the Congress of Industrial Organizations, to important sectoral actors like the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Poners, the United Automobile Workers, the American Federation ofTcachers, and the Unin:d Farm Workers. The central questions of the course will be: when, where, and why have US workers organized collectively in the twentieth centllt)' and how successful have they been? What have been the responses ofemployers, the govern­ment, and the public at large to these collective efforts ofworkers, and how and why have those responses changed over time? What ha.'i been the rela­tionship between organized labor and racial and gender discrimination, a.s well as the cause" of racial and gender equality? And how have Americans gcncmlly, and workers in particular, understood the labor movement in relation to capitalism, freedom, and democracy? Students will be expected to write several shott papers, engage in regular classroom discussion, and screen several tllms outside ofcla.ss.

Irish upset by Virginia Tech 4-3 
By KATE GALES 
Sports Writer 
Does a week change things? 

Apparently, it can. No. 50 Virginia Tech upset No. 26 Notre Dame 4-3 in a match that was eerily dissimilar to last week's victory over Ball State. 
"Today I think we were just out-toughed and out-compet­ed," tri-captain Matthew Scott said. "We came into this match pretty decently prepared, it just served as a reminder that we have some work to do before the Big East [Tournament) and we're likely to play them again." 
This week, the top of the line­up kept the Irish alive. The team again lost the doubles point, with only the No. 1 team of Luis Haddock and Scott com­ing out on top. Haddock and Scott are 10-2 as a team in the dual-match season. 
At No. 2, Brent D'Amico and Ryan Keckley dropped a close 9-7 decision, and Steven Bass and Eric Langenkamp lost in an even closer 9-8 match. 
"I think the doubles point was a big disappointment for us," Scott said. "We were in a posi­tion to win at all three spots and unfortunately we came up short in two of them, and that ended up deciding.the final outcome." 
In singles, senior experience showed, as Haddock won 6-3, 6-4 at No. 1 and Scott took the No. 2 spot 6-2, 6-0. 
Barry King also put a point up for the Irish at No. 5, winning 6­4, 6-7, 6-4 in three hard-fought sets. 
In a switch from the usual lineup, Bass played No. 3 and D'Amico was moved to No. 4. Bass lost 5-7, 5-7 and D'Amico was defeated 6-3, 6-1. 
The match again came down to Keckley at No. 6, who was unable to clinch the victory, los­ing 6-3, 4-6, 6-0. 
The loss could have a serious effect on seedings for the Big East Tournament, held April 28 -May 1 in Coral Gables, Fla. 
"We have a full week before our next match at Florida State, and we have to get to work right away and fix the things we can and look to bounce back from this in the Big East,'' Scott said.

Five-gaine win streak snapped at Valparaiso 
By RYAN DUFFY 
Sports Writer 

All good things must come to an end. 
Saint Mary's had its five-game win streak snapped this weekend when it suffered its worst defeat of the season, a 9-0 loss to Valparaiso. The Belles then trav­eled to Chicago, where they got back on track with a 7-2 win over the University of Chicago. 
Friday's home match proved to be a difficult day for everyone who played. The team faced numerous setbacks in its quest for victory. No. 4 singles player Kris Spriggle was unable to par­ticipate in the match due to a scheduling conflict with her exams. The team also had to deal with the loss of Kaitlin Cutler, who entered the contest with the flu and was forced to forfeit her match only four games in when she became too ill to continue. The automatic loss gave Cutler only her second l:oss on the year, which currently gives her the top record (13-2) among Saint Mary's singles play­ers. 
The rest of the squad was unable to continue its strong play against Valparaiso. 
"The Valparaiso team was a lot stronger than the year before," Miranda Mikulyuk said, who lost 0-6, 1-6 in straight sets. "And we gave it our all but it just wasn't enough. We were all proud with how we played." 
Sophomore Kristen Palombo, who had won her last four matches heading into the Valparaiso contest, lost 2-6, 2-6. 
"We were all just a little off our games against Valpo," she said. "We all just sort of had an off day." 
No. 1 singles player Jeannie 

Knish also was defeated 2-6, 2-6 in straight sets. "They were a tough team," Knish said. 
"We had trouble pulling our­selves together. Plus, it was freezing outside. It was really cold, and it was just hard to get warmed up." 
In her first singles match of the year, freshman Grace Gordon lost 1-6, 1-6, and Kate Bowler was also unsuccessful. losing 4-6, 2-6. 
Palombo hoped she and her team had learned something from this match. 
"It was a good learning experi­ence," Palombo said. "Since we had won so many matches in a row, this loss to Valparaiso served as a wake-up call. After the match, we made some adjustments, and I think that that really showed on Saturday." 
The team was able to rebound strongly with its match against the University of Chicago on Saturday. Their 7-2 victory moved them to a record of 11-4 on the year (3-0 in MIAA confer­ence play). 
"We had to fight the weather as much as we had to fight the team," Mikulyuk said. 
"The wind was just horrible." 
However, the team seemed to play up to their ability again, and the return of Spriggle and a healthy Cutler provided an added boost. All but one of the singles players won, and the doubles teams also enjoyed improved success. 
"It was a 180-degree difference from the previous game. We tried our best to use the cold and wind to our advantage," Palombo said. "We're looking to start a new streak from this one."

Red-hot Belles tally two wins 
By JUSTIN STETZ 
SportS Writer 
After a nine-game losing stn~ak, the Belles have fought back to win five out of their last six. On a chilly Saturday after­noon, Saint Mary's posted two impressive victories against Adrian College in conference play. 
After stressing the importance of improving their offense, the team went on to win game one by a score of 9-5 and followed with a 4-0 victory in the second part of the doubleheader. 
Marnie Walsh said that an increase in batting practice was the key to the oiTensive improve­nwnt in Saturday's game. 
In th1~ first inning, Angie 1-:llison doubled to left center from tlw number two spot, while Laura lleline continued to shine as she singled to ccmter field, scoring the first run. Katrina T1~bb1~ then smacked her first of' thrne hits into right field, good for a triple. She came home to score shortly after on Erin Sullivan's HBI single. And, the B1dlc$' offense wasn't done. 
They erupted in the second 
inning as seven runs crossed the plate giving pitcher Kate Sajcwich a large cushion to work with. The inning began with Jean Downes reaching lirst on a single. After an Adrian error, she came all the way around to score. 
Amy Parker also reached on an error by the second baseman and scored on a Walsh double. Next up was Angie Ellison who nailed a double into center, giv­ing the Belles a 5-0 lead. With two outs, Tebbe knocked a hit into right giving her an RBI before Sullivan singled to the opposite side. 
After Sajewich was hit by a pitch, Downes cleared the bases with a blistering double giving Saint Mary's a 9-0 lead. Adrian fought back with two runs in the fourth and sixth innings, but was unable to overcome the delicit. 
Game two was highlighted by the dominating pitching of Libby Wilhelmy. 
"[Wilhelmy! has been amaz­ing, especially in the last three games posting all shutouts," Walsh said. 
And Saturday was no diiTerent as Wilhelmy went the distance giving up only two hits in seven scoreless innings. The Belles' first run came in the first on a Heline double that scored Walsh. Saint Mary's was back at it again in the second when Tiffany Griffin and Audrey Gajor came around to score on a Walsh single. 
The !ina! run came in the sev­enth when Wilhelmy showed that she could do more than just pitch. She dropped a double into center scoring Ellison. The Bulldogs' two hits came in the first and fourth and both were singles. 
As the MIAA conference tour­nament rapidly approaches, Walsh believes that the Belles have a very good chance at earning a spot. 
"In making the tournament, we must continue to play like we did in the last game," Walsh said. "Our defense and hitting arc very important." 
This weekend's doubleheader improves Saint Mary's record to 10-12 on the season and 3-3 in the MIAA.

Irish earn more NCAA berths 


By MIKE GILLOON Sports Writer 
Despite battling less than ideal weather conditions the Irish won ten events in its Spring Opener this weekend. 
Selim Nurudeen led the way with the unofficial eighth fastest 110 meter hurdle time in the country this year. lie clocked in at 13.92 seconds but technical difficulties will prevent all times from being made oflicial until sometime this week. 
Nurudeen was pleased with his performance despite the cold, windy weather he faced. 
"It was hard to get warmed up in the cold weather," Nurudeen said. "It was diffi­cult to get as loose as you'd like and open up your stride like you want to." 
Godwin Mbagwu was also a winner on the men's side as he placed first in the triple jump. He hopped, skipped and jumped his way to a dis­tance of 48-9 3/4, which is only eight inches short of the qualifying mark for the NCM Regionals held in May. 
The biggest standout for the women's team was distance runner Stephanie Madia. 
She was a double winner by taking first in both the 1 ,500 and 3,000 meters. Madia took 
4:40.1 to win the 1,500 meters and finished the 3,000 meters in 9:52.94. 
Megan Johnson competed in the steeplechase for the first time in her Irish career and came away with a victo­ry. ller unofficial time of 
10:54.70 should qualify her for the NCAA regional. 

The third winner on the men's side was Dan Driscoll as he won the 5000 meters with a time of 15:08.69. I lowever, Driscoll will need to lower his time to 14:50.44 to qualify for the Big East cham­pionships. 
The 400 meter relay team was victorious as well. They lowered their 42.59 second time from last weekend down to 41.00 seconds and easily qualified for the Big East meet. 
Pole vaulter Laura lluarte was the third winner for the women as she cleared a height of 11-5 3/4 Fellow field event competitor Stacy Cowan placed first in the high jump with a height of 5-6 1/4. 
The final winner of the women's team was Tiffany Gunn as she ran the 400 meter hurdles in a time of 1 :05.94 seconds.

SolliTiann could be out for rest of season 
By CHRIS FEDERICO Senior Staff Writer 
No. 5 Notre Dame got a couple of big wins Saturday over Villanova, but they also lost a big player when second baseman Steve Sollmann went down with · a broken jaw in the fifth inning of the opening game. The senior tri-captain was chasing down a ball in shallow right field when he collided with teammate Cody Rizzo. 
Sollmann also suffered a con­cussion on the play, and· the game was stopped as an ambu­lance came on the field to carry Sollmann off to the hospital. 
Irish coach Paul Mainieri stat­ed Sollmann was discharged from the hospital Sunday morn­ing and traveled with his family to a hospital in his hometown Cincinnati. He will undergo sur­gery on his fractured jaw today, and his prognosis for a return to the Irish this season is unknown. 
"When the injury happened, I was just glad he was alive and could walk and move his arms. The last thing on my mind was him playing again for us," Mainieri said. " ... But then [Saturday] night, the word peo­ple were telling me is that people can come back in five to six weeks from a broken jaw. 
"And if anybody can do it, it would be Sollmann. He's the toughest kid I've known." 
Until that time, Mainieri says 
' he plans for senior reserve Zach Sisko to see time at second base in place of Sollmann. The Irish skipper says he will also consider moving catcher Javi Sanchez ­who started at third base this year against Penn State on March 8 '----out from behind the plate and using the senior cap­tain at second base. 

''I'm still toying with the possi­bility of maybe putting Javi [Sanchez] out there and catching with [freshman catcher] Sean Gaston," Mainieri said. "[Gaston] was not available to us this weekend, because Thursday night, he had a badly sprained thumb [against Hillsdale College]. We'll see how [Gaston's] thumb comes around, and we'll probably get [Sanchez] a little work there." 
During the 2002 season, Sanchez came off the bench for the Irish to play shortstop for the remainder of the season in place of injured starters Matt Macri and Matt Edwards. The senior was actually recruited out of Christopher Columbus High School in Miami as an infielder and had not played catcher until the start of the 2003 season with Notre Dame. 
But until Gaston's thumb heals and he could take over for Sanchez at catcher, Mainieri says he has confidence in Sisko to handle the starting role at sec­ond. 
"And we'll continue to play Zach [Sisko]. and I have a lot of confidence in him," Mainieri said. "I think he did a good job [Sunday], and if that's the way we go, then we'll be fme."

Irish remain undefeated 
No.3 Notre Dame defeats Connecticut to go 8-0 
By MATT PUGLISI Sports Writer 
Make it eight. 

Attack/midfield Meredith Simon netted her third straight four-goal game and defender Kassen Delano turned in a hat trick with all three of her scores coming in the contest's final 25 minutes as No. 3 Notre Dame tallied its eight straight win this sea­son. The Irish exploded for nine second-half goals to defeat a struggling Connecticut (3-6, 0-2 in the Big East) sq.uad ·14-8 in Storrs, Conn., Saturday. 
The victory extends Notre Dame's winning streak to a school-record 12 games and leaves the Irish with a perfect 8-0 start to the season, including a 3-0 mark in con­ference play. 
"I was happy [with the team's play]," head coach Tracy Coyne said. "There was a lot of adversity. The game was pushed up to 7:00 p.m., we were playing under the lights on their turf. it was really cold and wet, and I was just happy to leave with a win." 
In a see-saw first half that included five lead changes, midfield Meghan Murphy struck first for the Irish 51 seconds after the opening whistle to give the Irish a temporary 1-0 advantage. 
After the Huskies picked up a couple of scores to claim the first of a pair of first-half Connecticut leads, attack Abby Owen responded three minutes later to knot the score at 2-2 and Simon found the back of the net 90 sec­onds after Owen to provide Notre Dame a 3-2 lead with 
19:21 left in the half. 
The Irish and Huskies con­tinued to trade goals for the remainder of the half as a pair of Connecticut tallies left the Irish down 4-3 before midfield/defender Andrea Kinnik, and Simon beat Huskie goalkeeper Jennifer Wong to restore a 5-4 Irish lead. 
A Huskie goal by Tracy Mullaney -her third of the half -with 4 7 seconds left evened the score at 5-5 head­ing into half time. 
"We switched some defen­sive match ups [at halftime]," Coyne said. "We just needed to change our offense because they were playing a zone -we had to play a dif­ferent offensive strategy against that, and I thought we handled it pretty well." 
Playing more like the squad that has run off victories over four teams currently ranked in the nation's top 20, includ­ing wins over then No. 2 Duke and No. 6 James Madison, the Irish netted the first three goals of the second half and eight of the next ten to turn the one-time nail bit­ter into yet another solid Irish victory. 
Delano kicked off the Irish second half run with a goal 

4:34 into the period and attack Jackie Bowers and Simon quickly followed suit to boost the lead to 8-5. 
Although a Huskie tally 
1:50 later brought the under­dogs within two at 8-6 Irish, it would be as close as Connecticut would get. 
Midfield/attack Crysti Foote and attack Kristen Gaudreau delivered to bump the advan­tage to four goals with Gaudreau's goal coming with 
14:45 remaining. 
Connecticut's. Kristen Link kept the Huskies in the game on a free position goal with 
13:39 left, but the hosts were ultimately unable to over­come Irish stalling tactics as Notre Dame managed to keep the Huskies off the board for the next 12:41. 
Attack Lauren Fischer broke Notre Dame's own 
12:01 scoring drought with just under three minutes. left and Delano posted her sec­ond and third goals within the next two minutes to put the game away. 
"Connecticut always plays us tough," Coyne said. "We were up against a lot and we knew that they were going to come out and give us a very competitive game. We want to be in those types of situa­tions because I think it will only make us better in the long run."

Malloy responded, saying the University has "made progress toward great diversity" and currently has a minority popu­lation of 20 percent -an increase of 8 points from 1984. 
Malloy also supported Willingham and his ability as a college head coach who "will continue to recruit outstanding athletes who fit Notre Dame."

Freshman Stephanie Brown had by far her best performance of the year in an Irish uniform in Friday's sweep, as she finished the day with a 5-for-6 perform­ance with six ·RBI, four runs scored and two home runs. One of those home runs was a grand slam in the second game of the doubleheader. 
"Stephanie was awesome for us on Friday," Gumpf said. "It was a really great day for her and you could tell she was really having fun out there as well."

Suzie deBarry countered with an HBI single in the top of the second for Connecticut, but Notre Dame jumped back ahead in the bottom of the inning with an HBI single from Megan Ciolli. 
The Irish scored three more runs in the bottom of the third and never looked back en route to the eight-run victory. 
Notre Dame continued its offensive onslaught in game two, with Megan Huthrauff crushing a pitch to right field for a three­run home run in the top of the first inning. It was Ruthraul'f's eighth home run already this season. The Irish put the game away in the third. scoring seven runs in the inning including Brown's grand slam.

The Irish went on to defeat Villanova 6-5 Saturday in the nightcap of the doubleheader and then knocked off the Wildcats 13-1 Sunday. 
Despite the possible season­ending injury to Sollmann, Mainieri is pleased about his team's position in the early standings of the Big East. 
''I'm really happy obviously to be 6-0 in the league and to have the record that we have overall," he said. "I feel like we've kind of made a statement in this early part of the season that we're the team that people have to chase." 
The Irish got off to a good start in the opener Saturday, staking Irish pitcher Chris Niese! to a 10-0 lead after three innings. 
In the second inning, Notre Dame sent 13 batters to the plate, as left fielder Steve Andres led off with a solo home run and designated hitter Matt Bransfield had a three-run homer. Catcher Javi Sanchez also had a pair of singles in the frame, as the Irish plated eight runs to post their highest-scor­ing inning of the year. 
After Sollmann's injury, how­ever, things started to turn towards the Wildcats' favor. In the top of the sixth, Villanova narrowed the Irish lead to 11-6 and had bases loaded with only one out when Mainieri decided to go to closer Ryan Doherty an

The move paid off as the 7­foot-1 sophomore struck out the next two batters to end the inning. 
"Ryan Doherty has done a great job or us all year," Mainieri said. "[Saturday] in that first game, when I felt it all kind of slipping away from us, I went ahead and used Ryan Doherty right there, and he came in and got those two big strikeouts for us." 
The Irish put the game out of reach in the bottom of the inning with four runs on the strength of a two-run triple from third baseman Matt Macri and RBI doubles from center­fielder Danny Dressman and first baseman Matt Edwards. 
Niese! got the win for the Irish to improve to 4-1 on the season but was hit hard for six runs (five earned) in five innings pitched. Sanchez fin­ished a perfect 4-for-4 in the game. Macri was 2-for-3 with three runs scored and 2 RBis, while Bransfield was 2-for-4 with three RBis and two runs scored. 
The nightcap of the double­header Saturday proved to be the real nail-biter, as the Irish and Wildcats played neck-and­neck all game and required 10 innings to decide a winner. 
Down 5-3 in the eighth inning, the Wildcats got a lead­off walk from first baseman Adrian Schau followed by a home run from shortstop Brian Trotta off Irish reliever Joe Thaman to tie the game. Thaman then buckled down and induced a pair of ground­outs and a popup to prevent any further damage. 
In the bottom of the lOth, with one out and runners on first and second, Macri fouled off pitch after pitch from Schau -now in the game at pitcher -before sending a two-two pitch to left field for a game­winning single.

Malloy responds to criticism 
By MATT LOZAR .Sports Writer 
University President Father Edward Malloy responded to recent comments made about the football program's aca­demic standards with a published letter in Sunday's edition of The New York Times. 
Storin said the sports opinion pages of The New York Times provided a national outlet for Malloy's piece that responded to the recent national attention former Notre Dame football player Paul Hornung's comment on football recruiting and admission standards at Notre Dame received last week. 

During an interview with Detroit radio station WXYT-AM on Tuesday, Hornung said, "We can't stay as strict as we are as far as the academic structure is con­cerned because we've got to get the black athlete. We must get the black athlete if we want to compete." 
Hornung's comments garnered atten­tion nationwide resulting in reactions from columnists across the country. A col­umn by William C. Rhoden entitled "Hornung Has Failed to Meet Standard of Common Sense," ran in Thursday's print edition of the Times and was another rea­son for Malloy's letter. 
"There was a column in the Times that didn't make the print edition here, but we felt that although you can't address a spe­cific column with another," Storin said. "There were some things said about the University and its attraction to players of color that needed to be said." 
Rhoden took the comments made by Hornung one step further and said Notre Dame must do a "better job of selling the

Irish sweep first four conference gam.es

Irish softball players huddle during Sunday's game. 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER Associate Sports Editor 
After just four games, the Irish have already shown that they will be a force to be reckoned with in the Big East this season. 
Notre Dame (28-1 0, 4-0 in the Big East) opened its conference schedule by sweeping Connecticut (13-14. 1-3) by scores of 9-1 and 10-0 Friday, and then followed that up with a sweep of Boston College (20-15, 2-4) by the scores of 5-0 and 7-1 Sunday. 
''I'm very proud of the girls," coach Deanna Gumpf said. "Coming into conference play I wasn't really sure how they would react, but we really played our game this weekend. We were able to shut people

Goolsby prepares for return to gridiron, not blacktop 
ByANDREW SOUKUP Senior Staff Writer 
For the thousandth time, Mike Goolsby is not playing Bookstore Basketball this year. 
Not after he re-broke his collar­bone playing in the campus tour­nament last year, earned the wrath of his coaching staff and put his left arm and his 2003 sea­son in a sling that hung from his neck. 

"Now," he grinned, ''I'm going to stick to safe sports, like foot­ball." 
What happened to Goolsby in 2003 was often a mystery to most outside the football program. Reporters rarely had the opportu­nity to interview him and Irish head coach Tyrone Willingham always said that Goolsby's status was "week-to-week" with an undisclosed injury. 
Most thought that Goolsby's Bookstore injury a year ago kept him off the field. But this spring, the soon-to-be fifth-year senior revealed that both his shoulders were ·hurt when he decided to play Bookstore Basketball. 
Goolsby first hurt his left collar­bone in Notre Dame's 28-6 Gator Bowl loss. While that injury healed, he had surgery to repair cartilage in his right shoulder. Then, just weeks after he took the sling off his right shoulder, he again fractured his collarbone playing in Bookstore Basketball. The healing process began all over again, and Goolsby had to miss the entire season as a result. 
"It was really rough," he said. "Had we had a successful season, it would have been different. It's tough to watch your buddies put everything into it and not come out on [top] -and I felt partially responsible for it, too." 

"It was a bad decision to play Bookstore." 
Goolsby didn't put on pads until two-thirds of the way through Notre Dame's season, when he lined up with the scout team. He could have played had the Irish needed him, but at that point in the season, it simply wasn't worth it. 
"What we were looking for was
