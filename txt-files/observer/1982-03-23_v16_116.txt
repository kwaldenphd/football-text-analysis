A man described as "husky and very muscular" ac­costed a Saint Mary's student in the area west ofFlanner Hall shortly after 1 am. Friday, March 12. lbe woman escaped to the nearby security office when she struck him in the face after he grabbed her arm. The assailant was described as about 21 years old, six feet, two inches in height, 170 to 180 pounds, dark brown hair and beard, wearing a blue jacket and blue jeans. The victim said he did not 
appear to be the "student type." -The Observer 
Saint Mary's student Laura Hartigan, freshman, suf­fered a broken neck in a car accident on the Florida Turnpike near Fort Lauderdale duringSpring Break. She was taken by her parents to an Atlanta Hospital, close to their Georgia home. Four other Saint Mary's students were in the car, but they were not injured. Hartigan was asleep when the car hit a rut in the road and then bumped into the guard rail twice before going into a spin. Hartigan expects to be out ofthe Atlanta hospital today ifher tests are satisfactory, and she should return to school later next week. -The Observer 
After 100 days of military rule the same refrain is heard from weary Poles waiting in mind numbing lines for scarce goods: the martial law regime has brought a certain order to Poland, but no oranges. The long lines and shortages are essentially unrelieved and, in some cases, worsening. "The people are weary," concedes a government official. "They have no idea ofhow the future is going to tum out, and that is a cause for much concern." The objective ofthe military crackdown was to stop what the government saw as the independent union Solidarity's challenges to Communist Party con­trol of the country. The premier also wanted to halt Poland's economic decline that brought chronic shortages of food and raw materials, constant labor unrest and a crushing foreign debt. Martial law authorities ha-.e said that economic recovery is at least two or three years away. "I don't think they have that kind of time, or that the people can wait that long," said the Western diplomat. "Pol~d is already an economic basket case." -AP 
With its tentative pact with the united Auto Workers Union, General Motors Corp. gained more ammunition to battle Japanese competitors than Ford Motor Co. got in its contract signed earlier, industry analysts said yesterday in Detroit. "GM wanted more from the start," said Harvey E. Heinbach, vice presi­dent at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Inc. in New York. "And they worked a little harder to get it." The UAW's 26-member international executive board was expected to approve the tentative pact yesterday, said union spokesman David Mitchell. The next step is a vote Thursday in Chicago by the UAW's 290-member GM council The council, made up oflocal union leaders, can vote to recommend that rank and file approve or reject the pact, or make no recommendation. Heinbach said GM clearly intends to improve productivity as well as inhibit the growth in workers' pay. He cited GM's push for help from the union in curbing rising health care costs and worker absenteeism, and strong insistence on changes in plant work rules -things not included in the Ford agreement. -AP 
While plans for nuclear plants are being abandoned in the West because ofgrowing expense and opposition, Eastern Europe is forging ahead with ambitious nuclear power projects. The communist countries of Eastern Europe are planning to sharply increase their reliance on nuclear power, and have set high goals for expansion. The region's trend toward nuclear power was accelerated by the poor performance of the Soviet bloc's centrally planned economies last year. In the United States, where there are 71 plants in operation, construction is being stopped on 19 nuclear plants, partly because of fierce resistance by local com­munities, according to figures of the Nuclear Regulatory Commis­sion in Washington. Nuclear power provides about I 0 percent ofthe electricity produced in the United States. Increasing costs of con­struction and expensive safety features combined with a decreasing growth rate in demand for electricity have also helped stop work on some U.S. plants. In recent months the government-run media of every East European nation has said the communist countries can no longer afford growing energy costs caused in pan by imported oil Most East European cities are dimly lit after dark and neon signs are rare. In cities throughout Romania, which has one of the Soviet 
bloc's hardest-hit economies, authorities imposed regular cutoffs of electricity as pan ofa fuel-saving program. -AP 
Municipal leaders in four Midwestern states say they liked President Nixon's program for cities better than President Reagan's reductions and grant consolidations, a Purdue University pollster says. Federal budget cuts for cities may mean layoffs, elimination of some city services and user fees for the ones that remain, the leaders told David Caputo, a political science professor. Caputo surveyed mayors, city managers and finance officers of 163 communities in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin. Each of the cities had populations of 25,000 or more. Caputo said he found that city officials were about evenly divided over tax increases. Many said they could not realistically raise taxes. Consequently, they predicted some services would be eliminated. When the survey was taken in October 1981, all four states were experiencing substa,ntial economic difficulties. In the five months that the results were tab­ulated, not much has happened to improve the financial outlook for 
those states, he said. As a result, Caputo said he doesn't think the 
attitudes of the municipal leaders have undergone any major 
chafiges. -AP

Blasting off into limbo 
Just as it has done twice before, the space shuttle Columbia blasted into space yesterday. The glamour of the launches is beginning to fade somewhat. Dan Rather (complete with sweaters) is spending less time interupting the morning game shows and afternoon soaps to report the latest rocket bum. The actual blas­toffs are all beginning to look alike, and Astronauts 
Lousma and Fullerton would no doubt be disheartened 
to discover public recognition of their names is rather 
low. 
But as the saying goes every cloud has a silver lining, 
and the lack ofsheen on the shuttle is fine as far NASA is 
concerned. They would much rather have the public 
saying: "Oh that shuttle thing is up there again?" as 
opposed to: "Well Earl, how big an explosion do you 
think it'll make this time?" 
However after all the investment of time and money 
in the shuttle system, it would be unfortunate indeed if 
the attitude of the public and congress for that matter 
became one of disintrest. In this same space about a 
year ago after the successful completion ofthe first mis­sion, I outlined the great potential and almost limitless uses this country could derive from the shuttle. During the past year the concept of the system has been more than proven. The

more ominous nature. The military has already 
reserved over 60 percent of the flights for classified

Unfortunately, the shuttle makes an expensive truck.

One argument long offered is that space belongs to everyone, and that all the nations of the world should work together in exploration. Not only does this spread the cost over a larger base, but it promotes international harmony, something that is worth any price. The Rus­sians have plans to launch a joint manned mission with the French. Those same French along with most of the rest ofWestern Europe made plans to _send a spacecraft to analyze Haley's Comet when it makes its net ap­pearence in 1986.

Space shuttle Columbia launches 
CAPE CANAVERAL (AP)-Colum­bia set olf spectacularly on its third and longest journey yesterday -a 3 million-mile test of the shuttle's ability to withstand the incredible temperature extremes ofspace. 
One hundred-fifty miles above Earth, Commander Jack R. Lousma and Pilot C. C.ordon Fullerton im­mediately began scientific and ther­mal tests that will make their seven-day, 116-orbit flight Colum­bia's busiest yet. 
They circled the globe every 89 
minutes, .20 seconds. 
"Unbelievable -much fun," Fullerton, a rookie astronaut, told Mission Control's Sally Ride, an un­tested colleague. "You've got to try it." She agreed, and he called working in weightlessness like "learning to swim." 
lousma and Fullerton asked for, and got, permission to spend a few minutes being just tourists: to gawk at Mother Earth. Their reaction to a view privileged to few mortals was typical ofall the astronauts who had been there before them. 
"The first part of the flight was a real barnburner," said Commander Lousma 
"We've got a pretty spectacular view. We're looking down at Hawaii down there somewhere. We see a lot ofdouds and blue water.' .' 
"We have a very clean spacecraft," 
said Flight Director Tom Holloway, 
who guided the ascent. "It looks like 
we're offto a great start.'' 
And a great start it was. 
More than a million people watched the launch from waterside sites along the Florida Space Coast. Authorities said it may have been the largest spaceshot crowd ever. Spec­tators are being permitted next Monday when Columbia is scheduled to land on the Army's White Sands Missile Range. 
President Reagan watched liftoff on television and called it "a magnfi­cient achievement." On launch-eve, he telephoned the astronauts, wished them Godspeed and good luck and said: "All America is proud of you and those who made it pos­sible." 

Oak Room popularity 


mcreases, Senate says 
ByDANKOPP 
N~sStaff 
The Oak Room, established last year, finally ha-; begun to gain popularity with the student body. l.ocated in the South Dining Hall, the late-night eating facility's popularity hao; almost doubled since Septem­ber. 
This encouraging statistic wa'! revealed at the Student Senate meeting last night. This government body lobbied hard for the res­taurant. 'lbe increa'IC is said to be due to better advertising. 
Student Body President Don Mur­day concluded that the Oak Room's popularity "shows the need for anal­ternative to the Huddle on campus.'' lie said that the administration docs not necessarily want to make money on the facility but it does want to see student support. 
In other business Student Govern­ment Executive: Coordinator Frank Tighe explained the difficulties stu­dents have been having at the dining halb when they lose their l.D.s. 
In pa<;t years when students forgot or lost their l.D.s, they were able to obtain a refund for the meal charge by showing their l.D.s when they were found. Director of Food Services James Robinson told Tighe that system swamped his office with paperwork and encouraged fraud. 
Since September refunds have been very difficult to obtain. Tighe reports that Robinson does not refund charges due to athletic ticket 
istribution. Tighe said, "The only oplc who seem to get refunds are hose who have gouen their wallets He then makes sure they 
vc: reported the loss to Security.'' Other students without I.D.s are reed to pay more than four dollars 
or a dinner that they have already aid for in their room and board. Tighe proposes that a better sys­can be established, especially 
lth the new computer system. He tans to work further on the project, oping to convince Robinson to 
come more lcniant. Also in the meeting Julian Rowe, nior Class President, complained 
fthe limitations upon class govern­c:nts. S7')0 is allocated to each lass but Rowe claims that is not nough to make class governments 
c:ctivc:. 
Rowe said, "We are considering oposing a S 1 class fee on tuition d that would upgrade class vernment." Murday concluded the meeting with a report of his visit to several other campus's student centers. His trip was part of a study he is undertaking for the Board of Trus­tees on the need for a Student Cen­ter at Notre Dame. 
By looking at the facilities at Northwestern, Duke, Villanova, and several other universities, Murday plans to be able to make some general conclusions. u Acentral loca­tion is a must," he said. 
If the Student Center ever is es­tablished he said, "It really is the students who will make this thing go." He called for strong coopera­tion between the halls, the Student Union, the class governments, and the student government. 
There was a cauldron of fire and an outlandish roar as Columbia's three engines and two rocket boos­ters catapulted the ship off launch pad 39A at 11 :00:08 a.m. Seven seconds later, the ship cleared the 347-foot launch tower and arced majestically backward over the At· !antic Ocean. Ten minutes into the flight, the astronauts were in orbit, skimming over the world at 17,400 mph. 
Lousma had been in space before, on the 59-day flight of Skylab 2, but his heart rate at launch jumped to 132 beat per minute -double the rate at rest. Fullerton took launch with a placid 92 beats. 
Half-way to orbit, one of Colum­bia's three auxiliary power units (APUs) overheated, but Holloway said it probably would right itself when cool. "Right now the APU is considered healthy and usable: for entry," he said. The same unit gave trouble on the Flight 2 launch, had to be shut down prematurely, and worked on reentry. 
The units operate the steering sys­
tems on ascent and reentry. 
The errant unit reached a tem­
perature of 330 degrees -five 
degrees above the danger line ­
when it was turned off. 
During the flight, Columbia will be a methodical sunbather, carefully measuring exposure on all sides to gauge its effects. Late yesterday, the astronauts were to point the ship's tail to the sun, holding it there for 28 hours. Tomorrow, Lousma turns the ship's nose to the sun and leaves it that way for 80 hours. Saturday, the 
open cargo bay and its instruments are pointed to the sun for 28 hours. 
In sunlight, Columbia's systems must endure temperatures of 250 degrees Fahrentieit; in shadow, readings drop to 215 below zero. 
Lousma and Fullerton were un­abashedly enthusiastic in the opening hours of flight. Lousma looked into the cargo bay and told Mission Control: "We see the American flag and we've got 'Canada' written on the arm." Canadians built the robot arm that sits in the bay.

City officials step up Fort Wayne recovery plan 
FORT WAYNE (AP) -As the 
flood swollen rivers of Fort Wayne 
neared the magic number of 20 feet 
yesterday, city officials stepped up 
their recovery plans. 
Mayor Winfield Moses Jr. said he would not lift the city's flood emer­gency declaration until the flood­waters drop to 20 feet. By midday yesterday, the Maumee River stood at 20.5 feet. 
Some of the 9,000 people made homeless by a week of flooding con­tinued returning home Sunday as city and county building inspectors certified some of their dwellings were safe. 
"Our goal is to wrap this up in 30 days," said Moses, who was out sick yesterday after a week of round-the­clock supervision of flood emer­gency efforts. 
State pollee and national guard 
troops, on special duty in Fort 
Wayne all of last week, returned to 
their regular posts yesterday in Allen 
County. 
City police said all major streets 
were open in Fort Wayne. 
All city schools, except Nebraska 
Elementary School on the city's 
westside which was hardest hit by 
flooding. alo;o were open yesterday. 
The massive sandbag filling opera­tion at the city's Memorial Coliseum was shut down over the weekend and a stockpile of 97,000 sandbags was transferred to city garages. 
Moses said an additional one mil­
lion sandbag.~ fortifying the city's 
eight miles ofdikes would remain in 
place until "well into the spring." 
The flood victims' assistance cen­
ter, a central clearinghouse for 
flood-related problems, was to open 
today at Central Catholic High 
School. 
Federal, state an<l local agencies were to have representatives available for counseling victims and helping them apply for assistance. Private agencies also were to be on hand to provide emergency food, clothing and other items. 
City officials said the initial bill for fighting the flood was S600,000. That included only the price ofsand, dirt and equipment purchases. It will be at least two to three weeks before the .city knows the final total flood bill, not counting the overtime for city workers. 
More than 35,000 volunteers also worked in emergency operations through the week offlooding. 
Building inspectors started a house-to-house check of structural damage and electrical and heating problems Sunday. 
Of the 500 homes inspected, 
about one-third still had water in 
basements and could not have utility 
service restored. Despite announce­
ments ofthe inspection schedule by 
the local media, some residents 
were not at home to let inspectors 
conduct their tours. 
Most homes in evacuated areas 
had the utilities disconnected and 
city officials said gas and electrical 
power would not be restored with­
out a building inspection. 
Some evacuees, though, returned to their homes even if they didn't have heat and electricity. 
Inspections are expected to take a week to I 0 days, said Betty Collins, the inspection team's coordinator.

are boycotting the elections for two reasons. Many leftist leaders refuse to enter the country for fear ofassas­sination by rightist death squads. Secondly, the party representing the leftists has been forced to split into smaller parties. The division will certainly divide the vote, decreasing the party's chances for victory. 
Duarte has been ostracized by both sides in the country. His sup­port for the Land Reform Policy in the country caused members ofthe right to label him a communist. Left­ists have called him a puppet of the military. Hesburgh believes a vic­tory for Duarte will give him leverage to pursue more peaceful means in the country and the pos­sibility for the containment of the military. 
Critics feel that Hesburgh's presence in El Salvador will appear as a legitimization of the govern­ment. Fr. Ernest Bartell, Economic Executive Director ofthe Helen Kel­logg Institute for International Studies at Notre Dame thinks that Hesburgh "is not there to baptize the military junta and to sanction humaln right violations." 
"I am not legitimizing anything," said Hes!Jurgh.."1 am just going to look at the elections to see whether or not they are being run honestly." 
Hesburgh added that with all the 
concern over the process in El Sal­
vador, people should be "screaming" about the situation in Nicaragua where there will not be a democratic election until 1986. 
The Notre Dame-Saint Mary's El Salvador Solidarity Group has planned several events for the week of the election. On March 25, the group will march from Notre Dame to Saint Mary's and then to the Justice and Peace Center in downtown South Bend. A service will follow in St. Stephen's Church. The group sponsored a similar event last year. Several members also plan to attend the national rally in 
Chicago on March 27,

Economic Update

l· An OPEC agreement to reduce its output of oil to 
17.5 million barrels a day has raised doubts about predictions of further widespread oil price cuts. Few oil experts believe that OPEC's agreement on Saturday to trim production by about 700,000 barrels a day will, by itself, tighten the oil market. Rather, they say, the accord is part ofa strategy ofholding the troops together in the

Ford Motor Argentina, struggling with the rest of the auto industry through the country's worst recession in 50 years, announced the discharge ofnearly 3,000 employees on Friday night. The action, reported in a statement by the company's president,jose Courard, affects 22 percent of the 13,000 administrative and as­sembly line workers at the auto maker's three plants here. Ford ear­lier had furloughed most workers on half pay and nearly halted production this month because ofoverstock. Auto sales in February fell to their lowest level since 1966.

Editorials 
El Salvador's 
whole picture 
In a three-part essay, Venezuelan Edgardo Tenreiro examines the his­tory and current events ofthe El Sal­vadoran crisis. Edgardo J. Tenreiro is a freshman from Caracas, plan­ning an economics/engineering double major. Part one portrays the social and political climate which the Duarte government inherited. 
Yes, we are concerned about El Salvador. Yes, we read in newspapers, magazines and witness through television the terrible mo­ments that this Central American country experiences. I have also had the opportunity to read articles in Latin American newspapers, espe­cially Venezuelan reports on El Sal­
vador. 

After comparing both, I have come to the conclusion that the American media, including the Notre Dame press, film and lecture series, are not presenting the complete picture of the whole situation. Con­sequently, we are not able to form an objective view of El Salvador's Civil War. 
The main responsibility in El Sal­vador's plight falls on the dictator­ships and the inflexible social, economic and political structures maintained by the conservative oligarchy throughout the history of El Salvador. This structure has stopped the growth of liberal institu­tions and has stunted social, economic and political progress. 
The constant struggle between the 
conservative oligarchy and the 
emerging institutions generated a tur­
bulence, common in many Latin 
American countries, a struggle 
which continues to confront the 
modem political parties of El Sal­vador. Also, the Marxists, supported by Cuba and Nicaragua, are the root of the guerrillas' actions. 
The dictorial regime, closely tied 
to the extreme right, generates a two fold response: one directed by the military government, and the other by para-military organizations welded into the Armed Forces. 
Democratic groups, syndicates, the Church and other institutions began to seek a democratic solution. After long discussions, a successful strike against the dictorial regime was instituted by young military offi­cials. All the groups, including those who were involved in the armed in­surrection, were called to join the new government. Under these ad­
verse conditions, a first junta and then a second junta were formed. Un­fortunately they both failed primarily . because neither the guerrillas nor the extreme right recognized either of the juntas; therefore, the violent actions of both left and right extremist groups persisted. Moreover, Social Democrats and dissident Christian Democrats joined opposition groups. 
After much turmoil and continued political chaos, a third junta was created. Napoleon Duarte, a Notre Dame-educated reformer and formal founder of the Christian Democratic Party in El Salvador, was named president. This new junta chose representatives from both the young military force and from the moderate business sectors of El Salvador and of other nations.

The Notre Dame golf team en_loyed Its spring break, finishing sixth out of a field of 21 in the Florida International Sunshine Golf Tournament in Miami, Florida 
The team had a stroke total of 1,264. They were led by sopho­mores Dave Pangraze and Frank Lcyes, who tied for I7th place, out of 126 players, with a score of 316. Senior Bob Horak shot 319, good for 23rd place. 
"It was an outstanding team per· formance for this time ofyear," said Head Coach Nod O'Sullivan, noting that only Florida schools finished 
ahead of the Irish. Florida lqterna­
tional University won the tourna­ment with a score of 1,201, fQilowed by Miami, Tampa, Florida Atlantic, and Jacksonville University. Even though the Irish golfers had no out­door practice before the tourna­ment, they managed to finish ahead ofthree Florida schools. 
looking ahead, O'Sullivan said, "The season looks very promising. We were 25 strokes better than last year at the same tournament." 

The team's next match is March <' 31 against Valparaiso at the Burke Memorial GolfCourse.

Women's tennis 
Irish get burned on Southern trip 
ByJANE HEALEY 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's tennis 
team returned home late Sunday 
night from Louisiana drained and ex­
hausted The optimism and excite­
ment which they departed with was 
not present. The Irish were coming 
home with a 0-6 record for their 
spring trip and the start of their 
spring season. 
The first three scheduled matches were close contests. Cenetary Col­lege handed the Irish their first loss with a score of 5-4. At third singles, sophomore Pam Fischette high­lighted the action for Notre Dame battling a three set match against a girl Coach Sharon Petro called "the best tennis player Cenetary had." According to Petro, Fischette's op­ponent could easily have been playing first singles and was obvious­ly playing beneath her abilities. 
Louisiana Tech and Northwestern State were the Irish's second and third oponents with both matches being played on the same day. The Louisiana Tech score was 6-3 in favor of Louisiana during the morn­ing and in the afternoon Northwes­tern State defeated the Irish 5-4. 
The second half of the trip was worse than the first part. Tulane, New Mexico State, and LSU all pounded on Notre Dame with final scores of7-2, 8-1, and 8-1 respectful­ly. Although Petro does not want to

make excuses for the losses, all things must be considered. It was the first time Notre Dame had played outside since October. The Irish, unlike their southern challen­gers had difficulty dealing with the sun and the heat. 
The Irish were also competing without the talents of senior co­captain Usa Stephan. Stephan travelled with the team in hopes of playing, but tendonitis in her wrist prevented her from doing so. 
Freshman Usa I..aFratta at first singles was also injured while on the trip. After her match against Northwestern State, I..afratta was plagued with severe muscle cramps and soreness in her legs. The pain became so bad that she was forced to default two days later against New Mexico State. Petro commented that I..afratta was never able to play to 100percent due to her legs. 
Amidst all these negative ele­ments, there are always a few bright spots. Freshman J..aura Lee from Agoura, California ended the trip with an individual winning record. Lee in the fifth singles spot was 4-2. Previously mentioned Fischette was able to break even at 3-3. She also teamed up with Usa Gleason at second doubles for another 3-3 
score. 
Petro admits that she is disap­pointed. Yet, she comments, "The trip was not a total failure. We can learn from our mistakes in order to help our spring season." 
Cautiosuly, Petro goes on to say, "The trip was a learning experience so it was okay. And yet, ifwe actually don't learn from it and keep losing, then it was a waste oftime." 
Notre Dame's next chance to redeem themselves will be against Illinois and Western Illinois in Macomb, Illinois tlli.s Saturday. As Petro puts it, "Only time will tell."

continuedfrom page 12 
Although Janis placed 18th in the 
sabre competition, only four fencers 
who finished above him will be 
returning to collegiate competition 
next season. 
The highlight of the champion­ships for Notre Dame was undoubt­edly epee captain Rich Daly, who finished in sixth place and earned all-America honors. Daly, seeded sixth in the finals, posted a 14-1 record in the first day of finals com­petition, then lost to the five fencers seeded above him and beat the three below on the last day of the cham­pionships. Such was the rule of the epee event, as the top six seeds finished in the first six places in the epee finals. 
"Rich fenced as well as he could -he really gave his all," remarked DeCicco. "He beat the fencers he was supposed to beat, and lost to people who really were better than he was. I am really pleased that all of his hard work is paying off for him. 
"Rich is a real scrapper," DeCicco continued "IfI were in a dark alley, I would definitely want Rich on my side. 
Daly's sixth place finish improved on the 12th he earned in last year's event. 
Wayne State led the final team scoring with 85 points, while Clem­son was second at 77 followed by Penn (74), Columbia (73), Harvard 
(68) and Princeton (68) Notre Dame finished seventh with 66 points. -the finals will probably beat those lower seeds, so a loss there really hurts. 
"Of course, in both Mike's and Marc's cases, It was their first NCAA championship, and I am sure there was a certain amount of awe in­volved. Maybe it just caught up with Mike a day earlier." 
Janis recovered on Thursday to post a 4-4 record against the top­seeded sabre men, including a 5-3 decision over eventual runner-up John Friedberg ofNorth Carolina 
"Most of the entrants in sabre were seniors," said DeCicco. "Considering their experience, I think Mike fenced fairly well. I am confident that if Mike advances to the NCAAs again in the next three years, he will be a real contender.
