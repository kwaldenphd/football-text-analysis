Children joining ranks of homeless in U.S. 
By CLIFF STEVENS 
Copy Editor 
The ranks of the U.S. urban homeless are rapidly expanding to include poor children and their families, according to New York City Homeless Coalition member Robert Hayes. 
Hayes said that a "radical repudiation" of government hous­ing policy and a "squeezing out" of urban poor from inner-city neighborhoods by affluent redevelopment is causing the hous­ing shortage responsible for the "explosion of homeless families" during the past 18 months. 
"The face of the homeless is literally the face of a child," said Hayes, asserting that the stereotype of the older mentally-ill or han­dicapped homeless is inaccurate. 
According to Hayes, one out of four U.S. children live in poverty. "Poverty is becoming a function of children and often single-parent families," he said. Notre Dame could advance the cause of the homeless poor through opening a building to area homeless or lobbying for government action, said Hayes, whose lecture was part of Peace With Justice Week.

The Notre Dame lacrosse team, now almost midway through its season, is 3-2 and looking forward to the rest of the year with hope for a strong finish. Irish head coach Rich O'Leary can look even farther forward than that, three years far­ther to be exact, largely due to the presence of John Olmstead. 
The freshman has received a good deal of playing time this season and has responded by scor­ing four goals in five games. O'Leary understands the amount of his young player's potential and says that experience in the form of varsity action is the most effective way to get at it. 
"John has a great deal of maturi­ty for a freshman," said the sixth­year head coach. "He's playing out of his high school position because we needed IVOre attackers than midfielders. He's worked hard to improve his game, and it's showed. 

John works with a lot of com­posure in front of the goal, and he always seems to beat the goalie." 
Olmstead appreciates the con­fidence that O'Leary has shown in his ability, and has completely gell­ed with a team composed of many juniors and seniors. 
"So far, my transition from high school lacrosse to Notre Dame's has been pretty smooth," said Olmstead. "The coaches have been totally understanding, and they've shown me a lot of little tricks that I've used to adjust to college play. 
"Coach O'Leary doesn't hesitate to put me in during the tight spots, and that's the type of playing time I need to improve. The team is easily the best group of guys I've ever worked with. 
"I can see how the upperclassmen might be upset at seeing me play as much as I do, but I've never gotten any indication that they're (not) just trying to help me out as much as they can. A lot of my improve­ment just comes from doing what I

AUGUSTA, Ga. -Tradition in the Masters, at least as overpower­ing as the beauty of the settmg, is fac,ing a. chl\llen~e from a b;mc;l of fiercely competitiVe yotu1g niert, some of whom had never even seen the Augusta National Golf Club before. 

"We're a new breed," said Dan Forsman, a winner on the PGA tour earlier this season who will make his first Masters start today on a course that once belonged to the likes of Jack Nicklaus and Ar­nold Palmer, and before them, Sam Snead and Ben Hogan. 
"We are not afraid to tee it up with the established players and go head to head," said Forsman, one of a group of young stars who have, over the last few years, began 
-to supplement some of the game's more familiar names. 
He is among those to be con­sidered a contender in the 50th Masters, the first of the year's four major tournaments. 
"They've showed they can win," Andy Bean said of the upstarts. "With the level of competition we have on the tour now, with the ex­perience they get from the college programs, they're ready to win when they join the tour." 
The select international field in­cludes Scott Verplank and nine other amateurs, along with 78 pro­fessionals, including such new breed players as Bob Tway, Donnie Hammond and Kenny Knox, all winners chis year and all making their first appearance in golrs an­nual spring rites.

see the more experienced players do." 
Olmstead, who has started three of the last five games the Irish have played thus far, attributes part of his success to his early recognition that the college game would be, to say the least, different from his high school career. 
"I knew when I got here that the lacrosse would be more physical and much faster than before," said Olmstead, "so I really tried to get myself into shape. But I didn't ex­pect to play as much as I have this early, so my physical condition is more important. I'd like to become quicker and to become better at spotting the open man earlier. I guess those are my personal goals at this point." 
Olmstead is happy to be involved with the Irish lacrosse program and hopes the team can put a string of wins together leading up to the postseason play. 
"It's been a lot of pressure," said Olmstead, who led the Irish in scor­ing during last fall's Chicago tour­nament, "but it's been even more fun. We played pretty well in Virginia (over break), and I think we've got the potential to do some great things this year." 
O'Leary is expecting great things from Olmstead for the next three years. 
"John will definitely be a vital part of our program in the future," said O'Leary. "All we want is for him to expand his great natural ability into pure lacrosse form." 
He could be the man to watch on upcoming Irish lacrosse squads. 
Olmstead and the rest of the Irish travel to Ohio for two games this weekend. Notre Dame faces Mount Union at 3:30p.m. on Friday and Kenyon College at I p.m. Satur­day. The next Irish game will be Saturday, April 19, against peren­nial power Denison. The game will be at I :30 p.m. on Cartier Field.

The second instance occurred when Chicks Are Still Dumb faced the Nads. Early in the game, Dave Twohy, playing for Chicks Are Still Dumb, injured his hip. While waiting for the ambulance, Twohy, lying on his back, told the guys not to give up. Following Twohy's removal from the court, the Nads, in a show of sportsmanship, decid­ed to sit one player and continue the game as a four-on-four contest. The Nads eventually won the game, 21-11. 
Two more teams were dis­qualified. One · team was dis­qualified because it had no current Notre Dame students. All the players were Notre Dame alumni. The other disqualification came out when a student was caught playing for two different teams. At the pre­sent time, only one of the teams has been officially disqualified. 
In the Nads victory, Tony Casieri grabbed 22 rebounds and Dan Genreau grabbed 16 for a combin­ed total of 38. The hot shooter of the day was Michael Shim who shot 0-for-12 for Mag and the Nipple Cippers in a losing effort.

popularized the fast break, slam dunk, weave pattern and the fancy passing now commonly associated with the NBA. In those early years, the Trotters carried the new pro league, often playing doubleheaders with the fledgling league's teams to boost their atten­dance. 
But now with players like David Rivers abounding in the college ranks and the NBA filled with the likes of Dominique Wilkins, the Trotters aren't as innovative as they once were. But with some of the plays and routines that the Trotter run, Austin says the NBA and the Globetrotters can't be compared. 
"We can do anything those guys (in the NBA) can do," says Austin. "In fact, we can do more. It takes a lot of practice to do the things we do. There are things they just can't do, and they'll tell you that. We're professionals on one level, they're on another. There's no com­parison." 
Austin admits that the Globetrot­ters schedule of 150 games and the accompanying life on the road can be tough, but he says that he's do­ing something that he enjoys. 
"You know, all my life I dreamed about playing for a team that wins every game, and here I am," Austin notes. "It happened, I love what I do and it fits my personality. I en­joy making people happy and the razzle-dazzle aspect. And I can give them my best game."

Belles track scores big upset, defeats Goshen and Defiance 
By ANDREA LaFRENIERE 
Saint Mary's Sports Editor 
The Saint Mary's track and field captured first place in eight events to solidly defeat Goshen and De­fiance Colleges at a meet on Tues­day. 
The Belles totaled 80 points at the competition, placing them ahead of both schools, which had 55 and 33 points, respectively. 
The team's performance was a definite improvement over last weekend's competition at Man­chester College, according to Belles head coach Jean Kerich. 
"We beat two teams that had beaten us at the Invitational, so we were very pleased with the results," she said. "That's the first time we've ever beaten both Goshen and De­fiance." 
Among the first-place finishers 
for the  Belles  was  Cass  Pearl,  a  
junior,  who  ran  the  400-meter

Showboat Gorilla in Bookstore, top-rated teams at Stepan today 
By MICHAEL KEEGAN 
Sports Writer 
Before being captured and returned to his home, the Potawatomi Zoo, Homo Gorillus swung into action on Stepan Court 4 yesterday. Followed by a large crowd of banana-throwing crazes, Homo Gorillus lead 4 Guys in Muppet Shorts and a Gorilla against Sometimes the Best Things in Life Cost $10. 
Only moments into action, Homo Gorillus's team scored the first basket. In celebration, yellow torpedos, disguised as bananas, were hurled onto the court in an at­tempt to appease the gorilla and marne the opposition. Sometimes the Best Things in Life rebounded from this initial set back and went on to demolish the banana-loving ape and his team, 21-6. Homo Gorillus shot a memorable 1-of-7 from the field; the highest shooting percentage of an ape in Bookstore Basket ball history. Treemate Pat Murphy said that Homo Gorillus was a direct descendent of King Kong. 

"Homo Gorillus is the long-lost offspring of King Kong," said Mur­phy. "We found him shooting baskets at the Potawatomi Zoo and thought that he would dominate the boards. Today though, there was a 

Bookstore Basketball XV 
problem with the weather. Homo Gorillus was not accustomed to this environment and, as a result, his play suffered." 
Jay "Tito" Hizon, disguised as the ape, commented on the loss before being taken to the zoo. 
"UGH!!," said Homo Gorillus. That about sums it up. 
In other action, probably one of the most impressive efforts in the tournament to date was turned in by Chris "Manute Bol" Wepner in the game between 4 Real Men and the Tongue Virgin and Scintilating Inducements. Even though, Wepner's team, 4 R.M.A.T.T.V., !sot, "Manute" scored a triple dou­ble. He had 10 baskets, 11 re­bounds, and 14 blocked shots. John Gibbs scored 13 baskets and grabbed 10 rebounds while leading the Scincilating Inducements to a 
21-18 victory. 

Positive attitudes concerning competition and spirit were highlighted in two games yesterday. 
The first instance of the impor­tance of Bookstore Basketball in the life of the average student oc­curred in the game between One Hung and 4 Dragons and Dave's Heavy Towing. With the score tied at 20-20 at 7:20p.m., a nagging fan screamed to Brian Moffitt telling him that he had a test in 10 minutes. Moffitt, not willing to sacrifice his team's chances and realizing the importance of school in relation to Bookstore Basketball,

Globetrotters bring new player, basketball antics to the ACC 
By DENNIS CORRIGAN 
Sports Editor 
When the Harlem Globetrotters visit the ACC tomorrow night (tickets are on sale at the ACC) they'll be featuring something new and no, she's not the ball girl. The newest member of the Trotters is Lynette Woodard, the first woman ever to play for the world-famous team. 
Woodard, a 6-0 guard, was the captain of the 1984 gold medal­winning women's Olympic basket­ball team and holds the NCAA record for points in a career with 3,649. After playing a year of pro­fessional ball in Italy and coaching at her alma mater, Kansas, she became a Globetrotter after taking part in two tryouts this summer. 

"Personally, on a business level, I thought it was a good move," says Clyde "The Glide" Austin, a four­year Harlem veteran. "It's proven to be so, as our crowds have been bigger. 
"Lynette was a cut above the rest of the girls at the tryouts. If I had to choose, I would have chosen Lynette." 
"Off the court, you have to be more of a gentleman on the bus and all," says Austin, when asked what it's like to suddenly have a woman in a previously all-male environ­n_u:nt~."Qn the court, we're all pro­'i~ssionals so we just go out and play." 

Austin was a four-year starter at

When he joined his new team, he found he had to put a little more entertainment into his already dazzling style of play. 
"It wasn't real hard to learn the entertainment part," says Austin. "I like the razzle-dazzle style. I just had to ease up on the competitive side and not worry about winning. Right now we play about 70 percent basketball and 30 percent of it is skits. 
"When we're overseas, we have to put more entertainment into the game. Those people are there for the laughs. When we're in the United States, we have to play more basketball because that's what the people want to see. After all, basketball was founded here." 
Yet the question remains, how serious are the Globetrotters about basketball? 
"We do try to play to win every night," says Austin. "The Washington_Generals (the Trotters' travelling opponents and straight men) try to win every night, too. We have to be prepared." .

Women's basketball signs 2 prep players 
Special to The Observer 
The Notre Dame women's basketball team signed two high 
school seniors to letters of intent yesterday, bringing to three the 
total of recruits for the 86-87 season. 
The first player signed is Anne Schwartz a 6-2 forward from Gabriel Richard High School in Ann Arbor, Mich. Schwartz averaged 21 points and 10 rebounds last year and was named to the all-state first team. In addition the Detroit Free Press and Ann Ar­bor Journal both named Schwartz to their All-Metor Teams. 
"Anne's biggest asset is her ability to rebound well offensively," said Irish head coach Mary DiStanislao. "She also has the agility and speed to fill the lane and pull up and hit the 17-foot jumper. She complements our total program, and she is an outstanding student-athlete." 
The other recruit signed is Julie Garske, a 5-10 swingman from Amherst High School in Amherst, Wis. Garske averaged 25 points and 12 rebounds in her senior campaign and was named to both the UPI and AP all-state first teams. 
"Julie is an excellent shooter and a good passer," said DiStanislao. "She also has the ability to get up and down the floor. She still has a·lot to learn, but we think she will grow into our pro­gram." 
DiStanislao also said that she got the best player in Wisconsin for the third year in a row (the first two were Sandy Botbam and Heidi Bunek) to complete the hat trick. 
Schwartz and Garske will join Cathy Emigolz, who signed with the Irish during the November signing period, as next year's freshmen, and Coach DiStanislao said that all three complement each other as well as the team's style of play.
