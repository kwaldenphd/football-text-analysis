Fisher Roof Sit raises $3,000 for charities 
ByJEN ROWLING NewsWrirer 
Fisher Hall completed its third annual Roof Sit fundrais­er this weekend, collecting about $3,000 for charity pro­grams. 

The Roof Sit, which ran from Friday evening to Sunday evening, serves as fisher Hall's signature event, in which resi­dents from all Notre Dame dorms sit on top of the roof for 50 hours and collect donations from students passing by below. 
About 1,300 students donat­ed money, which will be dis­tributed to St. Aldabert's Catholic School in South Bend and the Chad Sharon Memorial 
Fund, Fisher Hall vice presi­dent Jeremy Moreno said. 
The fund honors the former Fisher freshman Sharon who died in December 2002. 
As part of the roof sit, Fisher also sponsored an interhall dodgeball game which was new this year. The winners, Dillon and Keenan, received $150 to donate to the charity of their choice. 
Though student organizers deemed the event a success, last year's roof sit raised near­ly twice as much money, about $7,500. 
"We are still learning," Moreno said. "Next year will make adjustments to make it more successful, it is only the

WRC tries to adjust identity 
Center receives new name, redefined campus role 
By DOLORES DIAZ NewsWrirer 

Formerly the Women's Resource Center, the Women in Social Service and Health club has donned a new title and a new approach since steadily declining member­ship hit a new low with the opening of the new Gender Resource Center. 
For WISSH, every meeting -like last week's, when co­president Corinne Liamzon walked in to rows of empty chairs -is particularly criti­cal. 
"The WRC, no longer a resource center, will be renamed Women in Social 
Service and Health because we will now be focusing our efforts on community service, fundraising and social event planning on campus," co­president Ashley Merusi said. 

This shift in focus -from primarily counseling to com­munity service -occurred this year, now that many of WISSH's responsibilities have fallen under the jurisdiction of the new Student Affairs-fund­ed GRC. 
"We're changing perspective and changing focus," Liamzon said, "and I really hope we can get things going," 
But for WISSH, the GRC's opening has meant more than just an attitude adjustment. This year their office, previ­ously located on the third floor of Lafortune Student Center, was relocated by the Student Activities Office to a smaller space in the same building. 
According to Liamzon, things were very different when WISSH, then the Women's Resource Center, first opened in 1993 as a stu­dent-run center. 
"It was a very big deal," she said. "It was the first center in the school where you could come and talk about whatever you wanted. It wasn't pro­women or pro-men, but pro­humanity." 
Liamzon said WISSH has

Maggie Oldham 
I jfeguarding for thn~e months on the beaches of Sports Wire Hilton Head Island. Editor 
S.C. wa..'i not only the most fun sum­mer of my life. but also taught some valuables lessons. I learned how to treat stingray wounds. usc radio ten-codes and clear the water for Signal 200s, 
a.k.a. sharks. 
Morn important than learning how to properly apply sunscreen to which an hour of orientation was devoted, this summer gave me a good "heads up" at what single life in the "real world" post­graduation is going to be like. Spending a summer in near paradise taught me live valuable lessons and things to expect once I leave "the bubble." 
1) Don't expect to live glamorously the lirst year atlt~r graduation. On May 15, I arrived at the "resort," my home for the next three months. Don't let "resort" writtnn on the brochure and front sign fool you. Although it makes the Howard Johnson resemble the Taj Mahal. the lifi1guard apartment<; at the "resort" were typical apartmnnl<; for young peo­ple just starting their careers. Head: safe. fun, but not nice. 

2) Expect to work with people from many backgrounds. Them were 60 col­leg11-agn lifeguards living. working and partying together with polar opposite pnrsonalities and diversn lifi1styles, a studly Canadian Buddhist for nxample. Oncn graduated out of the liomogeneity that is Saint Mary's and Notre Dame, an nntry-llwd job will no doubt be just as divnrsn. 
:~) You will not always get the credit you dnserve. Jjfeguarding on the beach is hard. You hav11 to be in top physical shape. There are no rotations and only one 30-minute lunch break. And don't expnct to talk to other lifeguards; they arn probably 100 yards down the beach. Not very many people wem on the beach at 7:30a.m. when the lifeguards each set up 30-plus sets of umbrellas and chairs bnforc nine. only to tear those sets down eight hours later. Neither did many b11ar.h-goers know that the lifeguards worked 50-hour weeks with mandatory ocean rescue training. Don't expect your entry-level paycheck to be a positive indicator of your hours and cfl'orts. 
4) The friends you meet at college will b1~ your friends for life. Students here are top-quality. My roommates' visit for my birthday was a refreshing break from the lifeguard scandals that would make MTV's Real World look like an episode of the Golden Girls. Make friends with the locals and party with your hot co-workers, but remember the friends that have been there for you these four years. 
5) Expand your comfort zone. I had never been to South Carolina. I didn't know a single person. I decided to go because it was something I wanted to do and it was the perfect time in my life to do it. Don't wait. Mer graduation, fol­low your heart. Go where you want to go and do what you want to do, be who you want to become. You will never stop thanking yourself.

Hawaii park seeks hunters of feral sheep 
VOLCANO, Hawaii Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is lookin ~ for volunteers with rifles to help rid the park's new 116,000 acres of thou­sands of feral sheep. 
The National Par { Service recently acquired the land on the Big Island from Kahuku Ranch. With the land came thousand> of mouflon sheep, nativ·~ to Corsica and Sardinia in the Mediterranean, that were brought to the ranch for hunting in the 1960s. Their population has mul· tiplied over the year:; because they have-no nat­ural predators. 
"Their grazing inhibits the regeneration of Hawaii's endemic plants, which are defenseless against sheep. goats and other chompers and stom­pers," the park service said in a news release. 
The park service is required by law to control alien species that inter­fere with native species or habitats, park spokesman Jim Gale said

Racial equality speaker denounces racism_, advocates justice 

By APRIL THOMAS 
NewsWrirer 
Hacial equality speaker Tim Wise addrPsscd the need to develop equity -not merely tolerance -for all people dur­ing a talk Tuesday at Saint Mary's College. 
"Tolerance is just a buzz word," Wise said. "I have never nwt a woman or person of color who wanted only to be to! Prated." 
Wise asserted that equity can be achieved through five dis­tinct steps: confronting denial of opprossion, acknowledging the rnsulting privilege, halting the use of liberal platforms as avoidance, admitting that racism is engrained societal conditioning and taking action. 
WisP mnphasized a dominant group's tendency to ignore any minority group's insistence of oppression. 
"We say. 'Let me define your reality for you,"' Wise said. "We deny their credibility in identifying their own oppres­sion." 
The primary obstacle is to a!Tirm racism as a real social problem. he said. In recogniz­ing oppression. Wise added, we must acknowledge the flip­side -when groups are oppressed, othef groups must 
. by definition benefit. "Privilege is attached to oppression," Wise said. But privilege is not as simple as it sounds -it encompasses personal safety, materialistic 
advantage. societal acceptance and approval and opportuni­ties. Wise said. Often white people can recognize another group's oppression, he said, but cannot recognize their own resulting privilege. 
Wise said many people skirt around racism with liberal platforms. 
"They say, 'I'm not racist because I have African­American friends,"' he said. 
He noted that while this point is valid and positive, it is not always consistent in poten­tially discriminatory situations. 
Wise said living in American society means we will ingest racist conditioning. Even if we are not individually hateful or violent, he said, racism is built into the very structure of our culture. 
"We point at the problem 'out there,' never in our own lives," he said. 
After admitting we are con­ditioned in racism, we can begin to set our sights on establishing total equity. Wise said, and we are finally ready for the final step -taking action. 
Wise declared that. as stu­dents, we can begin locally, interrupting the functioning of racism, sexism and heterosex­ism immediately around us. The dominant group must take that risk, he said. 
"Because of your status. your voice is elevated. The question is, what will you do with it?" he said. 
Wise has spoken on nearly 300 college campuses nationwide and has trained government, law officials and journalists in anti­racism efforts. The 2001 British Diversity Award winner explained that through his years of writing and lecturing, he has observed two popular reactions: audiences either show him exag­gerated respect for addressing racism and sexism as a white man, or he faces hostility from white audiences outraged at his accusations of white privilege. His Saint Mary's attendees had their own opinions. 

"! feel Tim Wise's presence on campus was so important to the future of Saint Mary's," said Lety Verduzco, a 2004 Saint Mary's graduate and the assistant director of community connec­tions at the Center for 

Women's  InterCultural  
Leadership.  
"So often  we, the College,  

praise ourselves in doing our part to promote diversity, but there is so much more to it than just putting someone's picture in a brochure," she said. "We must address the true issues of systematic racism in order to change it rather than remedying our own guilt." 
Saint Mary's senior Katie Larsen attended the lecture for her American Minorities course. 
"! didn't realize how closely he would apply this to Saint Mary's," said Larson. "Wise's talk was energetic and pas­sionate. I would love to have him as a professor."

esc to host annual service fair tonight 
By PAUL SPADAFORA 
News Writer 
To promote interest in volun­teer work after graduation. the Center for Social Concerns will help students review the choices available at the Post-Graduate Service Fair tonight. 
The annually held fair pro­motes service opportunities and volunteer positions for Notre Dame and Saint Mary's gradu­ates both domestically and abroad. 
Andrea Smith Shappel, direc­tor of the Center For Social Concerns' senior transition pro­gram, said more than 80 service organizations have been invited to campus to help recruit stu­dents. principally from religious groups. 
"There are a few secular groups. such as the Peace Corps, but the large majority are faith­based programs," Shappel said. 
According to Shappel, the reli­gious programs work to combine faith and service. 
"The faith-based programs have the volunteers live in one community with each other, and they are involved in a variety of services for the community," she said. 
Shappel said the student turnout and commitment at the activities fair is usually very high. . 
"We usually have 400-500 stu­dents come to the fair, and about half of them decide on a pro­gram." Shappel said. "About 10 percent of every [graduating] class ... commits to a program." 
Programs sponsored through Notre Dame also have a large part in the fair. The Echo pro­gram, a student service and edu­cation program from the Institute for Church Life. will be in attendance at the fair tonight for its second year. 
· Leonard DeLorenzo, Outreach Projects Coordinator for Echo, said the fair gives newer service organizations the opportunity to build interest within the University. "We got to explain the program to students, we generated a list of people inter­ested in the program and we were able to keep them in the loop," DeLonmzo said. "It helped us get started and get the word out to seniors." 
Colleen Garvey, an assistant director with the Alliance for Catholic Education, agreed that the fair helps promote student interest in volunteerism. 
"It seems like every year the interest grows as the word of mouth goes out, and people graduate," Garvey said. "I think students here are really excited about [service]." 
The Fair will be held tonight from 5:00 t~ 8:00p.m. in the Stepan Center. Although the fair is intended for juniors and sen­iors. any interested pa.rty is encouraged to attend.

Official defends janjaweed 
KHARTOUM, Sudan -A top Sudanese offi­cial on Tuesday defended an accused ring­leader of Arab militia attacks on Mrican vil­lagers as a legitimate tribal leader and warned any attempt to go after such men could ignite warfare that would tear the country apart. 
Separately, the U.N. refugee chief said Khartoum has agreed to a stepped-up U.N. civilian role and possible expansion of an African Union monitoring team in the western Sudanese region of Darfur, where 19 months of conflict have left more than 50,000 dead and uprooted 1.4 million. 
The U.S. State Department has named Sheik Musa Hila! and six other Sudanese as suspect­ed coordinators of the government-allied Janjaweed, the Arab militia largely blamed for the violence in Darfur. 
But Sudan's state minister for foreign affairs defended Hila! as a prominent tribal chief. 
Blair admits faulty evidence 
BRIGHTON, England -Prime Minister Tony Blair, skirting a direct apology, acknowledged to his Labour Party Tuesday that intelligence used to justify the invasion of Iraq was wrong, but insisted the world was safer with Saddam Hussein in prison. 
In a rousing address to the party's annual conference, interrupted twice by delegates booing and heckling, Blair defended the war and said Labour members even the war's opponents must believe he backed the U.S.­led campaign in Iraq to protect Britain. 
"The evidence about Saddam having actual biological and chemical weapons, as opposed to the capability to develop them, has turned out to be wrong. I acknowledge that and accept it," said Blair, whose primary reason for backing the U.S.-led war was the threat posed by those weapons.

Murderer commits suicide 
lAS VEGAS -A man jumped to his death at Hoover Dam early Tuesday, hours after calling police to say he had killed his girlfriend at their hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, authorities said. 
The 911 caller told police they could find a woman's body at a room at the Treasure Island hotel-casino, police Capt. Tom Lozich said. The man matter-of-factly provided the woman's Social Security number and her driver's license information, he said. 
A short time after the 911 call, Hoover Dam police noticed a man sitting atop the dam wall, said Colleen Dwyer, spokeswoman for the Bureau of Reclamation, the federal agency that oversees the dam about 30 miles east of Las Vegas. 
Board fires university president 
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -The president of Florida's historically black public university was fired Tuesday after a little more than two-year tenure marked by a dispute over the. school's football program and bookkeeping problems. 
Florida A&M board of trustees voted 9-4 to dismiss Fred Gainous effective Dec. 31. It pro­vided what all agreed was a meaningless caveat that he could keep the job if he wins unanimous board support by then. 
"We knew the job was dangerous when we took it," Gainous said. "We thought we could make a difference. And I think we have."

Gubernatorial candidates debate 
FRANKLIN-Democratic Gov. Joe Kernan and Republican Mitch Daniels sparred over jobs, full-day kindergarten and other issues Tuesday in a sometimes sharply worded debate that captured their campaign themes and criticisms of each other. 
Libertarian Kenn Gividen, meanwhile, large­ly used the 90-minute debate to introduce himself as an alternative candidate who favors smaller government, elimination of property taxes and the only one of the three candidates who opposes a new-terrain extension of Interstate 69 through southwestern Indiana.

Palestinians celebrate 4 years 
Militants parade in celebration of the beginning of the Intifadah in 2000 
Associated Press 
RAMALLAH, West Bank -Palestinians marked the fourth anniversary of their uprising Tuesday amid signs that the extremist Hamas group is preparing a political challenge to Yasser Arafat despite a series of Israeli military blows at the movement's leadership. 
Hamas published news­paper ads urging support­ers to vote in upcoming municipal elections, saying "it's time for change." And a top Hamas leader indi­cated the group might try to unseat Arafat in presi­dential elections, which have not yet been sched­uled. 
Meanwhile, Palestinian militants released an Arab-Israeli television pro­ducer for CNN a day after his abduction in the Gaza Strip. It remained unclear why he was taken hostage. 
The kidnapping, coupled with Hamas' electoral challenge, were apt reflec­tions of the state of affairs in the West Bank and Gaza Strip after four years of fighting with Israel. The violence has left Arafat's Palestinian Authority severely weakened, lead­ing to widespread chaos and boosting Hamas' pop­ularity. 
"We need an evaluation of these four years," Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qureia said. "Where have we been right and where have we been wrong? What did we achieve and what didn't we achieve?" Qureia also called on Israel to reassess its policies. 
The uprising erupted on Sept. 28, 2000, after Ariel Sharon, then Israel's oppo­sition leader, visited a sen­sitive Jerusalem hilltop revered by both Jews and Muslims. Palestinian riots broke out, and five months later Sharon defeated Ehud Barak in a special election for prime minis­ter. 
The fighting has taken a heavy toll on both sides, killing more than 3,000 Palestinians and nearly 1 ,000 Israelis. 

In the latest violence, about 30 Israeli tanks moved into northern Gaza Tuesday night and fired several shells, witnesses said. The military said the purpose was to try to stop militants from shooting rockets at nearby Israeli towns. Earlier, the Israelis blew up a building next to the Gaza settlement of Netzarim, saying it con­tained a tunnel used by militants. No casualties were reported in either incident. 
Israel appears to have gained the upper hand in the fighting. It has con­fined Arafat to his West Bank headquarters for three years and killed hundreds of leading mili­tants. The Palestinian economy is in tatters. 

In a sign of Palestinian weariness, a recent opin­ion poll by An-Najah University found that two­thirds of Palestinians sup­port a cease-fire with Israel. 
"The uprising has not been defeated, but it has not brought victory. Frankly, it is now closer to defeat than victory," com­mentator Hani al-Masri wrote in the Palestinian daily Al Ayyam. 
Sharon has abandoned peace talks with the Palestinians and instead launched a "unilateral dis­engagement" plan meant to separate the two peo­ples. The plan includes building a huge barrier to separate Israel from the West Bank and ma~ing a 
complete  pullout  from  
Gaza next year.  
Hamas  is  vying  with  

other groups for a promi­nent role after the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, where Hamas wields great influence despite Israeli assassinations of its top leaders. 
On Tuesday, Hamas pub­lished newspaper ads urg­ing its followers to register to vote in local Palestinian elections, which are scheduled to begin Dec. 9. "Fellow citizens, it's time for change. It's time to register your name," the ad said.

liant and complementary ideas. Solomon said. Issues discussed includod the importance of disci­pleship to the Church. the role of the Church in the study of bioethics and the societal changes that have cmated a growing dissi­dence between Catholic moral tradition and contemporary med­ical ethics. 
"Discipleship is common to all religions; it works f(Jr a common goal, allowing personal relation­ship with the Lord and bringing together a community," Dulles said. "Everyone who is a teacher develops disciples ... teachers must understand their obligation to teach their students so students can take that knowledge and apply it to life." 
Discipleship, Pellegrino added, is essential to the continuation of bionthics. 
"People aren't accepting bioeth­ical doctors because we arc not providing stem cell research and contraception alternatives," he said. "We must train peoplo who know both about philosophy and medicine to enter in the dis­courso." 
lie called on Catholic universi­ties to "(putl their money into bioethical research to convince the world that we have something to say and that we are going somewhem." 
Pellegrino then explained his views on the feasibility of doing sciontific rnsnarch within the con­fines of catholic medicine. 
"Stem cell research. for exam­ple. is not morally acceptable ­th1~ embryo is killed," he said. "We have alternate sources like 
placental blood and apparent 
adult cells that are changeable. 
Emergency contraception is not 
an alternative -the devil will be 
there to collect on [a woman's] 
soul [if she goes through with it]." 
Mcinerny urged the audience to 
remember the importance of faith 
and responsibility in the home. 
"Don't forget that you were born as a baby, don't forget that an infant is born without the abili­ty to speak, and learns under the tutelage of their parents." he said. "Parents have the responsibility to work for the common good of the family ... for the way to the civic common good passes by way through the family." 
Dulles agreed the home is an essential starting point in recon­structing the sense of an individ­ual in society. He coneluded with a call for renewed loyalty to the Church in challenging times. 
"Culture is in trouble ... even people that like parts of it, know it's in trouble," he said. "Intellectual challenges are signif­icant and will not be met without deep participation."

harassment, the GHC will now be the official resource for information about topics asso­ciated with gender. 
"As a resource center. the WHC has strived to dissemi­nate information on resources available in the campus and community for counseling and health care for women. With only student members. the WHC has struggled to meet the needs of the female Notre Dame community," Merusi said. "For this reason, the Gender Hesource Center was created last spring as a more permanent and reliable response to the issues con­fronting the campus." 
Liamzon said WISSH real­izes the new GRC will have more resources available than the former WHC did. 
"We're happy it's opening because they have more resources available to them than we ever had," Liamzon said. "The Women's Resource Center was student run. thereby relying mainly on the availability of its members to have someone at the office. [but] the Gender Helations Center has actually been able 
to hire a person to be at the office at allot­ted times." 
lleather Hakozcy. direc­tor of the new GHC, said she intends to work closely with student leaders of the former WHC as the new center develops this year. 
"The only way the Gender Hesource Center is going to nourish is if students express an interest in it." she said. "We hope there's going to be a very close relationship lwith WISSIIJ." 
Hakoczy, who has served as rector of Pangborn Hall for the past seven years. said she sees the WRC as a precursor to the new center and believes the change represents an important transition in the University's attitude toward women and gender issues. 
"The kinds of issues that the 
WHC would've taken up are 
certainly continued in our 
efforts," she said. "It's the 
forerunner to the GHC in 
many ways." 
Specifically. Hakoczy said she planned to be in contact with Merusi this fall to receive input on the new center's direction. Ultimately. Hokoczy said WISSH might become a part of the GHC gradually over the next several years. 
The new GHC is the result of a student-led initiative started three years ago by 2001-02 student body president Brooke Norton. who investigated gen­der studies at the University as a way to commemorate Notre Dame's 30-year anniversary of female stu­dents. 
Despite this year's changes, Liamzon and Merusi said they still plan to continue the annual WISSII Distinguished Notn~ Dame Woman /\wards. The awards are WISSH's main project and honor four women faculty members for dedica­tion and improvement of the Notre Damn community on women's issues. Each year, members of WISSII collect student nominations and assemble a panel of faculty and staff to select the winners. 
"We think that the club is an important part of Notre Dame's history. and we mean to keep it that way," Liamzon said.

Raises in oil production planned 
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -Saudi Arabia. the world's largest oil exporter, will raise produc­tion capacity from 9.5 million barrels a day to 11 million barrels in an attempt to rein in prices that topped $50 a barrel for the first time. the Oil Ministry said Tuesday. 
By increasing capacity, Saudi Arabia will be able to raise production when it wants. A Saudi oil ministry official, speaking on condi­tion of anonymity, said that the kingdom would increase production, "depending on demand." 
Oil Minister Ali Naimi announced that the capacity increase would come into effect in the next few weeks. using fields where pro­duction has just begun. 
"The fields of Abu Safa and al-Qatif. which· have just started production. will be used to increase the kingdom's production capacity in the coming few weeks to 11 million barrels per day." Naimi said in a statement.

Crude oil reaches $50 a barrel 
Unrest in the Middle East and political instability in Nigeria push up prices 
Associated Press 
Crude oil surpassed $50 a barrel for the first time and analysts said Tuesday that prices could keep rising because of a sharp rise in global demand. tight sup­plies and threats to output in petroleum-producing nations such as Iraq and Nigeria. 
Homeowners and energy­intensive industries could feel the sting from high oil prices worsen as seasonal demand picks up this win­ter. and there is already evi­dence that the supply dis­ruptions caused by Hurricane Ivan are making it more costly to drive. 
The 75 percent increase in the price of oil in the past year also promises to heat up as a political issue, with just over a month until the presidential election.

Black fartners to join conltnittees 
Agriculture Department seeks input on allocation offarm subsidies 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON The Agriculture Department plans to put more black farmers on tlw committees that have over­sight in how fedPral farm sub­sidins am allocatPd. 
The increase in black voters on tlw eommittees should hap­pen soon after the November Plection. Vernon Parker. the department's top civil rights oflkial. said Tuesday. 
Parker spoke on a street out­sidP the departnwnt's head­quartPrs while about 75 clPnwnstrators rallied against what they saw as the depart­nwn t 's continuing refusal to rertify a history of discrimina­tion. The department has set­tled one major class-action dis­crimination suit and faces the possibility of another. 
The planned expansion of minority participation focuses on county committees elected by farmers. The committees review eligibility for programs administered by the Agriculture Department's Farm Service Agency. 
The department's plan is a step in the right direction. said .John Boyd, president of the National Black Farnwrs Association. but is "a dime too late." If the change had been mad1~ a decade or more ago, "it could have saved a lot of black farmers." he said. 
Black farmers contend that white-dominated panels of three to five members in many 
counties have used their power 
to force the foreclosure of 
many black farms. which then 
are purchased by whites. 
The committee system is undergoing "a severe over­haul," said Parker. The depart­ment announced plans to change the committee struc­ture in August. 
The department currently has the option of appointing nonvoting minority members to county committees if farm­ers do not elect them to voting seal<> on the panels. Under the proposed changes, the depart­ment could independently nominate members from minority groups to run for vot­ing scats. It also could appoint voting members from minority groups to the committees if none run or win election. said Ed Loyd, a department spokesman. 
Placing minority group mem­bers on the committees would be an option if. for instance, a committee has been the target of bias complaints, Loyd said. 
Speakers during Tuesday's demonstration also accused the department of obstructing the process through which claims are paid under a land­mark discrimination class action settlement in 1999. 
In that case. black farmers complained they were denied loans and other assistance because of a pattern of dis­crimination. A new federal lawsuit contends discrimina­tion has continued since the 
last settlement, and seeks class action status on behalf of 25,000 blacks who farmed or attempted to farm between 1997 und 2004. 
At a hearing of the House Judici.try Committee's subcom­mitte .1 on the Constitution. lawm; kers said the 1999 class action settlement did not help most of the farmers in the class. About 65,000 black farm1·rs were excluded becau:;e they did not file claims in tirr.e, said subcommittee chair nan Steve Chabot. R­Ohio. 
"We cannot in good con­scienc ~ allow a settlement that leave.; out more potential claim<Lnts than it allows in to go ur examined or remain unresolved," Chabot said. 
CouJt-appointed administra­tors of the settlement coun­tered that their hands were tied by the settlement's own restrh Lions. To qualify for an extension, farmers had to show they were delayed by extraordinary circumstances such c.s a hurricane or serious illnes ;, and most could not, said J\.lichacl J. Lewis. the set­tlement's arbitrator. 
Con1~ress could pass a law to let th·~ excl udcd farmers try again for restitution from the Agriculture Department. said Alexander Pires. the class action's lead lawyer. But if he askec the court simply to chang~ the terms of the settle­ment, the department would object he said.

IRAQ 
Itali an women freed 
Kidnappers release 2 female aid workers, 5 others raising hopes for further cooperation 
Associated Press 
HAGIIDAD. Iraq-Kidnappers rr.leased two female Italian aid workers and five other hostages Tuesday, raising hopes for at least 18 foreigners still in cap­tivity. But insurgents showed no sign of easing their blood­soaked campaign against the 
U.S. presence in Iraq, staging a show of defiance in Samarra and striking twice with deadly force in Basra. 
It was unclear what prompted the two separate groups of kid­nappers to release the Italians, three Egyptians and two Iraqis, and whether any ransom had bnen paid. It was the second day in a row that foreigners were freed. 
The Italian women were wear­ing full black veils that revealed only their eyes as they were recr.ived by the Italian Red Cross in a Baghdad neighbor­hood. according to video broad­cast by the Arab news station AI-Jazeera. 
Looking dazed but smiling, Simona Torretta lifted her veil and repeated. "Thank you," in Arabic. Simona Pari hesitated before also lifting her veil. 
Later Tuesday, the two women were flown home aboard a Falcon 20 plane, arriving at a military airport in Rome shortly after 11 p.m. The two, now in long, white dresses, emerged smiling and held hands as they walked on the tarmac, their rel­atives by their side. 
Asked by reporters how she felt. Pari just said, "Good." 
Pari and Torretta were abducted Sept. 7 in a bold raid on the Baghdad office of their aid agency "Un Ponte Per ... " ("A Bridge To ... "). Two Iraqis, Raad Ali Aziz and Mahnaz Bassam. were also seized. 
Two different groups claimed responsibility for the abduc­tions, demanding the withdraw­al of Italian troops from the country or the release of Iraqi female prisoners. The same two groups later put out Web state­ments saying the two Italians had been killed, but the Italian government said the claims were not credible. 
News of the release came after a Muslim leader from Italy met with an influential Muslim asso­ciation in Baghdad on Tuesday to press for their freedom. though it was not immediately known if there was a connec­tion. The two women. both 29, had been working on school and water projects in Iraq. 
The Kuwaiti newspaper AI-Rai al-Aam had reported Tuesday that they could be released by Friday in return for a $1 million ransom. But AI-Arabiya TV, cit­ing unidentified sources involved in the negotiations. said no ransom was paid. 
Pope John Paul II, who recent­ly urged that all hostages held in Iraq be freed, expressed "great joy" over the release of the Italian aid workers, the Vatican said. 
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi went before Parliament to announce their release.

MOSCOW -Two Chechen men suspected of taking part in the murder of American journalist Paul Klebnikov have been arrest­ed, police said Tuesday, and one commentator cited his interviews with a rebel leader as a possible motive. 
Three guns were seized from the men, and prelimi­nary findings indicated that one of the weapons might have been used in the July 9 murder of Klebnikov, the editor of Forbes magazine's Russian edition, police chief Vladimir Pronin told the lnterfax news agency. He added that the suspects, who were detained overnight, had kidnapped an unidentified person prior to the killing. 
Police spokesman Pavel Klimovsky confirmed the suspects had been detained, but gave no other details. 
The chief prosecutor's office later sharply repri­manded Pronin, telling Interfax that nobody is authorized to comment on the case except the appro­priate investigator and prosecutor. The release of information by anyone else is "unacceptable" and could seriously hurt efforts to solve the crime, Interfax quoted the prrosecutor gen­eral's office as saying. 
In a telephone call to The Associated Press in New York, Klebnikov's brother, Michael, read a statement from the family saying it w o u I d " w a it to .s e e t h e incontrovertible evidence that the-individuals appre­hended today in Moscow are indeed responsible for Paul's murder. In any case, this would be only a first step to identifying, appre­hending and convicting those responsible for order­ing his assassination." 
Klebnikov, an American of Russian ancestry, was gunned down outside the magazine's office in down­town Moscow in a slaying that compound­ed concerns

has focused on Klebnikov's writing about the Russian business world. In the spring, Forbes published a list of Russia's 100 richest people, which could have drawn unwanted attention to people sensitive about the source of their wealth. 
But some commentators have said a. Chechen link was also possible, pointing to Klebnikov's book based on his interviews with Khozh-Akhmed Nukhayev, a former deputy prime minis­ter in the Che.chen sepa­ratist government, which was published last yea~ 
The book, "Conversations With a Barbarian," cast Nukhayev and other Chechen rebels in a sharply negative light. "I think that Chechens killed Klebnikov for publishing this book," said Yulia Latynina, a prominent Russian colum­nist who has written exten­sively about Chechnya. 

Latynina speculated that Nukhayev's entourage expected a more friendly book from an American journalist and considered it an insult. 
"Kiebnikov fell victim of a 
cultural gap," 
Latynina said. 

But Chechens don't go to court." 
Others were skeptical. "If Chechens had killed authors of all such books, we would have seen their bodies on weekly basis," said Oleg Panfilov, the head of Center of Journalism for Extreme Situations, a media advoca­cy group. 
Panfilov speculated that blaming Chechens for Klebnikov's murder could be an attempt by Moscow to win Western support for its tough course in Chechnya. "If Chechens killed a U.S. citizen, that may force the United States to change its view," Panfilov said.

lions of lives at. their most inde­fensible stage. 
Embryonic stern-cell research is not a proven v1nue for providing a panacea to many of the world's aff1ictions. and frankly it is disingenuous for those who are suffering to place too much hope in it. The scientific evidence suggesting embryonic stem cell research has a greater viable treatment potential for a plethora of diseases than non-embryonic stem-cell research is limited at best. In all actuality, embryonic stem-cell research applicable to humans could eventually prove to be a dead end. Lanza and Nadia Rosenthal, British stem cell researchers at the very forefront of the issue, found "embryonic stem cells pose the prob­lem of spontaneously differentiating into a hodge­podge of tissue types." Embryos also carry the "likelihood of immune rejection in humans" and present infinitely more danger than would a tradi­tional organ transplant. 
Adult stem cells, however, are less likely to be a scientific dead end. As reported in Scientific American, Catherine Verfaillie of the University of Minnesota Stem Cell Institute found adult stem cells "derived from bone marrow and dubbed a multi-potent adult progenitor cell {MAPC) can dif­ferentiate into nearly all types of mouse tissue" and are not "fusing with cells already present in the body." Another promising venue-as report­ed in The New York Times-is currently being explored at the Tufts New England Medical Center in Boston. where Dr. Bianchi found fetal cells remain in a woman's body after a pregnancy and can. after organ damage, "migrate there, divide and turn into the needed cell type." 
The American people have suffered at the hands of a partisan debate concerning stem-cell research. Thankfully, President Bush was able to find an important compromise in limiting embry­onic stem-cell research to existing cell lines, and to strongly support adult stem-cell research "by providing $190.7 million for human non-embry­onic stem cells" in the 2003 fiscal year, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 
In the second half of the nineteenth century slavery and polygamy existed in the United Sates -what Robert P. George and William L. Saunders dubbed the "twin relics of barbarism." They fur­ther go on to mention that it was the Republican Party that emerged to take on these "two great moral struggles." 
In their course to eradicate these evils, "Pro­slavery Democrats condemned them as fanatics and zealots," and yet. they prevailed. Today, George and Saunders believe a modern union of barbarism has reared its ugly head, among them, "abortion and embryo-destructive research." The Republican Party, amidst renewed contemptuous calls of religious fundamentalism. must again engage in a campaign to defeat moral evils. 
We cannot wantonly engage in the destruction of innocent life at any stage, especially in the ear­liest ones, for sheer scientific curiosity. Is it look­ing at scientific discoveries with fear, as Sen. John Kerry accuses President Bush of doing? No. Is it placing ideology before science? Perhaps. But by placing science before an ideology based on ethics and giving scientists free reign to conduct any research, we veer dangerously close to becoming passive participants in a massive genocide con­ducted by well-intentioned-but misguided­Joseph Mengeles. 
According to Dr. John Shea, a retired radiologist and ethicist from Toronto: "If we decide that there are certain classes of human beings which can be used like a product for some other good reason even, then we send a sign: We've gone right back to Nuremberg. People's rights don't come from the government." In this country, the Declaration of Independence made it clear that "all Men are created equal ... endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights," first among which is life. 
If we continue to degrade life in all of its forms and pursue a culture of death, we risk losing the very essence Of our humanity. In the end, would it be worth it? "For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" {Mt. 16:26). The life of one human being is never and can never be more valuable than that of another.

Changing abortion at the human level 
If there is an overarching flaw in the American Catholic Church {though, by no means a unique flaw), it is the deeply held, unspoken conviction that leadership is the source of all change and that the most effective solution to a problem is the "top-down" approach of an enlightened management effecting sweeping changes. 
You can see this clearly in the machina-Lance Gallop tions and strategies of the pro-life move­ment; its focus is the election of pro-life The Third Way politicians with an eye to eventual Supreme Court reform. For their part, the politicians love this. because it allows them to reduce issues to a strug­gle between good and evil, and the ensuing political hand-to­hand tends to mask more trivial factors, like how qualified the candidates are, and whether or not they can make good decisions. 
And although it admittedly began as a touch of political cyn­icism, I have become convinced that not only is pro-life poli­tics as it is now written a grievous waste of time, it so effec­tively masks the real problems and their solutions and is so incredibly self-defeating that I have no reluctance in saying that unless pro-life politics as we understand it is eliminated, abortion will always be prevalent and legal in this nation. 
The crime of politics is that it absolutely simplifies issues until they lose all connections to their origins, and in doing so it transforms politicians into antibiotic heroes with a one-dose cure-all to heal the nation. Once they become political litmus tests, people tend to stop thinking about issues, their devotion to a side clouds their judgment, and they become fixed at their end of the spectrum. Moderates are scared off by what they perceive as extremism and discussion of the topic effec­tively becomes taboo. In short, everything stands still until one side can get its particular political bandage applied, then they congratulate themselves on a job well done. 
But this is a terribly misleading situation, and worse, com­pletely ineffective. Abortion is not new, nor is it political in origin. There have been abortions in all ages, and all coun­tries, though admittedly not so many as today. It did not emerge from a vacuum; it emerged from a perceived need. It can only fully be addressed by addressing that need; no politi­cal bandage will suffice. 
Being that I am male, I can only speculate to one degree or another, but I do not see that a woman can decide to obtain an abortion without reasons. 
By all accounts the choice is so difficult that these women must possess what, in their own minds, is a very good justifi­cation indeed. The candidate I suspect most of all is fear: fear of being young and pregnant, fear of commitment, fear of consequences, fear of violence. Anger as well, and tiredness, and pain and self-delusion play into the mix. Only rarely do you see the apathetic and dispassionate "abortion shopper" that those who favor a legislative bandage solutions seem to implicitly believe in. In short, many people who seek abor­tions have, underneath everything else, a layer of desperation that drives them to that end. Today abortion is so prominent, and so well understood. and so accepted by those who seek it, that, were it taken away, they would still look for it in other nations, international waters and underground clinics. Desperate people do not listen to legislation; they do not have that luxury. 
And if the choice for an abortion is taken from them, des­perate people will fight to gain it back. In our political climate in which abortion is so polarized that most people refuse to discuss the issue, and where neither Democrat nor Republican can offer any explanation for their views beyond the abstract policy tool that abortion has become. the argu­ment of a desperate person is much more significant that the outrage of an ideology. Abortion would return. 
To address the problem of abortion, what is needed is not a political solution. Politics only gets in the way, prevents peo­ple from being open to discussion, and drives them into polar­ity or blind avoidance. Abortion must change at the grass­roots level, and to do so it cannot be a political issue, but must be a human one. Individuals must be approached with 
' the tact, empathy and understanding politics can never have and care given to solving the root issues causing abortion that politics always overlooks. People's hearts must change so that they do not want abor­tion, and more over so they do not need abortion. This cannot happen within a ridged political framework, or even as a reli­gious ideology, the solution must speak to hearts of a human level, and po bandage solution will ever succeed in changing hearts. In short, let the pro-life movement die and a holistic pro-life culture be built from its ashes. Only then will we ever see the end to abortion.

Ari Hest disappoints small crowd at Sl\tiC 
Singer has talent but lacks lyrical depth 

By LAUREN WENDEL Scene Writer 

Thorn se1m1s to be a curse on modern musie coming to college campuses these days. Since the emergence of John Mayer to radio, tlwrn has bmm a rush by labels to pro­du!~n as many Mayer-sounding musicians as possible. Unfortunately. this leaves the gener­al publie with little variety or sense of honest talent. Ari llest brought his version of "Mayerdom" to kick-off Saint Mary's "Pride Week" Monday evening. 
I lest, signed to Columbia Hecords this past year, is touring to promote his first major­label debut "Someone to Tell." This commu­nieations major and New York University graduate plays primarily acoustic pop/roek!funk/folk littered with generic lyrics about love and the quest to find oneself in the world. II is singer/songwriter status easily places him among the likes of Mayer and llowie Day, but with less personality than his counterparts. 
The set started on· slow with only Hest and his guitar in front of the crowd of about 50, playing long, slow love songs such as "Upper Hand" from his third self-released album "Story After Story." Gradually, he added bassist, Hob Caulder and drummer Scott Sever to the mix, creating a deeper sound as the set wore on. "Caught up in Your Love" picked up the pace with more upbeat drums and harmonies, but still lacked in lyrical complexity. 
Things began to improve with the catchy "Consistency" which caught the crowd off guard with its intense opening drums and sing-a-long refrain. llest mumbled the majority of the rest of the lyrics outside the refrain, making it difficult to appreciate the entire song. lie followed up this catchy tune with another single-ready, "Fascinate You." In faet, most of the songs sound like potential singles musically, but need lyrieal depth and variety. 
The erowd added some light cheers throughout this time, even shouting about his tall, dark and handsome appearance. Hest did not respond to much of these jests, nor did he speak during the long pauses in bntween songs. lie had a great deal of charisma on stage while singing, but shied away from the limelight otherwise. The only observance he cared to share with the large­ly female crowd was how he found it "cool not to have a balance around, it being an all­girls school." 
Songs from his new a bum kept the set fresh and moving along Jn a cold evening. llest's "Anne Marie" is a heartfelt ballad about "coexisting with someone who argues better than you, which rr, akes you break-up with them." The crowd b1:gan to warm up to Hest after this song and stayed with him through the TV soundtra1:k-esque "Monster" and "Not for Long." 0{ spite showcasing Best's vocal range nicely, these dragged on longer than necessary with lyrics that did not dick with the music. 
One of the best and m(lre unique songs of the set was a cover of Peter Gabriel's "Mercy Street." This darker ballad was nicely played with full harmonies and interweaving of instruments. Hest made a wise decision to cover this song, as it shovred a more complex view of his musical abilities. If he would con­centrate on honing thi~ sound, his music would move beyond "Mayerdom" and into a new realm of creating his own personality. Hest followed up this cover with yet another cover of Bonnie Hait's "I Can't Make You Love Me" which was less spectacular than "Mercy Street" but still a good fit for Hest's voice. 
IIest returned to his o\\ n songs with "Head for the Hills," a song written while on tour. With lyrics "Let's head for the hills/If only for tonight baby," the song needs some fine tun­ing and more attention grabbing composi­tions. Fortunately, Best {'nded his set strong with a string of single-roady tunes from his new album. 
"Holding On" was quickly followed by "They're Onto Me," Hest s first single off the album. Both of these gaye the crowd a good sense of his album, all "bile providing beats to bounce around to. "A Fond Farewell," one of Hest's personal favorites, like the majority of his other songs, lacks lyrical depth and is strongly reminiscent c·f Mayer's musical library. The long set concluded with "Aberdeen" -an almost lullaby-like song about leaving home. 
In Hest's case, if home were considered "Mayerdom," he has yet to leave and break out with his own personality. With more time, and more writing, Hest has the capabilities and hard work ethic to make an impression on the music industry, but not until he leaves "Mayerdom."

For fish and seafood, the Bone fish Grill proves consistently delicious 
By SEAN SWEANY Scene Writer 
South Bend restaurants are busiest during the Notre Dame football season. Large numbers of parents make the journey to South Bend to visit their son or daughter for a weekend. A great benefit to a visit from the family is having the chance to eat an actual meal at a restaurant instead of the dining hall. The Bonefish Grill is a restaurant where both par­ents and students can enjoy first class food, service and atmos­phere. Located at 620 West Edison Avenue in the St. Andrews Plaza Mall, the Bonefish Grill opened in July 2003 as part of a nationwide chain of fish restaurants dedicated to serving fresh

salmon fillet b<iked on a plank of cedar wood and then covered in breadcrumbs. This infuses a won­derful wood flavor into the fish which is offset by delidous sides of garlic mashed potatoes and fresh vegetables. In addition to the fish and other seafood, the Bonefish Grill serves excellent entrees that do not come from the sea. Both the sirloin and fillet of steak are highly recommended, along with the filling chicken marsala. To end a spectacular meal, the restaurant offers sever­al desserts, including outstanding key lime pie and a large warm brownie topped with vanilla ice cream and smothered in raspber­

The Bang Bang Shrimp is a spicy fried shrimp served on a bed of lettuce and eaten with chopsticks. Each day, more than eight types of fresh fish are flown in to the restaurant to be served in the evening. The premise of the main course at the Bonefish Grill begins with choosing a type of fresh grilled fish and then select­ing a signature sauce or topping for your fish. Sauce and topping selections include lime tomato garlic sauce, warm mango salsa, garlic butter sauce and crispy shrimp piccata. Each sauce is fla­vorful and unique, offering many possibilities for savory grilled fish. The Bonefish offers a variety of unique specials, including the seasonal Cedar Plank King Salmon. which consists of a 
may be con­sidered on the small side, but the four-course meal is well propor­tioned. The staff at the restaurant is friendly, helpful and attentive, especially in offering suggestions regarding which sauce fits a par­ticular type of fish the best. The restaurant is designed to be very open with metallic fish artwork decorating the walls. The lighting makes each table seem like its own island which is secluded enough to make for enjoyable din­ner conversation. The Bonefish Grill is one of the finer restau­rants in South Bend, and as such, prices are not cheap. If you are looking for an inexpensive restau­rant for a night out, this is not it. However, if you are willing to pay for a fine meal, the Bonefish Grill is an outstanding choice for a night away from the dining hall.

Soviet Propaganda exhibit showcases region's history 
Newest Snite exhibit is both aesthetically and academically interesting 
By MARIA SMITH Scene Editor 
When college students think about the Sovint Union, it might seem like some-· thing that has already faded into the annals of history. 
It wasn't so long ago that Soviet officials still exerted close control over information and art through vast areas of Russia, eastern Europe and central Asia. "Darker Shades of Red: Official Soviet Propaganda from the Cold War," an exhibit currently on display at the Snite Museum of Art, features propaganda posters and other artifacts from the emergence of the Soviet Union in the early 1940s until its collapse in the late 1980s. 
Posters were the main method for spreading propa­ganda in the Soviet Union for several reasons. After the Bolshevik Revolution most Russians were illiterate. In an era before television, officials made use of posters to spread images that would promote a desirable image of Soviet leaders and lifestyles. The political poster also played off the strong Russian tradition of dewtioaaJ. icons and popular prints. 
Tuesday afternoon's lecture by Karen L. Kettering, associ­ate curator of Russian art for the Hillwood Museum & Gardens in Washington, D.C., provided further insight into the methods and his­torical periods of Soviet art. Under the strict censorship of the Soviets Socialist Realism, the officially espoused method of art in the Soviet Union, became the main form of expression in almost all forms of art, including literature, drama and painting. Kettering described how Socialist Realism in the visual sphere was used to send messages to Russian citizens. 

One of the most important terms in 
understanding Socialist Realism is the 
untranslatable Russian word "zhiznera­
dostnost." The term might be loosely 
translated "joie de vivre" or "joy of life," but the terms fail to capture the full meaning of the focal term. "What you're supposed to get is a sense of pleas­ure," Kettering said. "Also, there is an idea that there is no natu­ral force· Soviets can't overcome." Soviet artists used many meth­ods to obscure the difficulties of life in the Soviet Union and try to portray this image and ideal­ize Soviet life for citizens. One overriding feature o.f the propaganda posters is the emphasis on vivid colors and bright lighting unlike what is really found in the Russian land­scape. "The intense light almost Mediterranean. It doesn't exist in northern Europe, certainly not in St. Petersburg," Kettering said. "You start to feel like you're look­ing at Mediterranean 
travel posters." 

Early in Soviet history many of the posters featured idealized images of Soviet leaders, often portraying figures like Josef Stalin not only as courageous leaders but also as caring and benevo­lent figures. Stalin was portrayed as fol­
lowing in the footsteps of great figures like Marx and Lenin. 
Other figures also began to infiltrate Soviet art as images that would show progress. Images of Uzbeks, for exam­ple, were fre­quently depicted as progressing towards an ideal state because Uzbeks citizens often had the lowest incomes and literacy rates. 
The figure of the strong Russian woman also became prevalent, partly as an image of Mother Russia. 
During post­war reconstruc­tion, there was a great emphasis on images of agriculture and industry to encourage the effort of brute force that would be needed to pull the Soviet econo­my back from the edge. Since so many young men had been killed in combat and the recovery depend­ed largely on women, women were often depicted at the center of agricul­tural and indus­
was the border guard. Soviet officials 
played off the fear that lingered from 
German attacks long past WWII to pro­
mote loyalty to the Soviet government. "They used an innate fear of war, of immanent attack at any time," Kettering said, "This was successful into the 50s, 
60s and 70s." 
In later examples of Soviet imagery the concentrated fear of war and work towards progress is replaced by images denouncing foreign organiza­tions and officials. These were less successful than posters that did not idealize the Soviets, and dealt with social problems like alcoholism. 
"There was a feeling that 'We have enough problems right here to deal with,"' Kettering said. "Artists were allowed to address current problems." 
Many of the Soviet posters feature rhymed quatrains that are powerful in Russian, but are difficult to translate. For the Snite exhibit Russian pro­fessor Alyssa Gillespie ren­dered the literal English trans­lation into rhymed verses that have not previously been included in the exhibit. 
The Soviet Union may be fad­ing into history, but its methods of propaganda are not. 
"Eighteen months ago when 
U.S. forces entered Baghdad, they found similar imagery with Saddam Hussein," Kettering said. "Hussein stud­ied Stalin. It is amazing to see the parallels." 
If history can teach lessons, this exhib­it of Soviet propaganda has many to teach.

Expos move to Washington official 
Announcement will take place today 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Major League Baseball will announce today that Washington will be the new home of the Montreal Expos, The Associated Press has learned. 
A city official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington has been notified by Major League Baseball of the impending announcement that will return the national pastime to the nation's capital for the first time in 33 years. 
The city is planning its own news conference at a down­town location Wednesday after­noon, the official said. 
The announcement will come one day before the 33rd anniversary of the Washington Senators' final game. The Senators moved to Texas after the 1971 season, which was also the last time a major league team changed cities. 
Baseball has been looking for a new home for the Expos since the financially troubled team was bought by the other 29 major league owners in 2002. 
Las Vegas; Norfolk, Va.; Monterrey, Mexico; Portland, Ore.; and Northern Virginia also made bids, but Washington clearly took the lead during negotiations over recent weeks. 
ThQse_n.~gotiatiol}s h11ve pro-,~ duced a 30-page document that would conditionally award the Expos to Washington, pending approval by the City Council. The document had not yet been signed as of Tuesday night, the city source told the AP. 
Final talks have been ongoing since a meeting of the sport's executive council last Thursday. Plans call for a $13 million refurbishment of RFK Stadium and a new ballpark costing slightly over $400 mil­lion, which would be built along the Anacostia River in the southeast section of the city. 
The move must be approved by three-quarters of major league owners and survive legal challenges by the Expos' former limited 'partners and possibly by Baltimore owner Peter Angelos, who objects to having a team just 40 miles from the Orioles. Bob DuPuy,

Orton and Stubblefield key to Purdue's success 
Quarterback and r~ceiver reason for Purdue's solid start 
Associated Press 
WEST LAFAYETTE -When Kyle Orton arrived at Purdue, his future favorite receiver was already there. It just took awhile for the shy quarterback from Iowa to connect with a skinny, slow wideout named Taylor Stubblefield. 
Four years later, they have blossomed into one of the nation's best pass-and-catch duos.

Not bad for a player who is listed at 6-1, but is much closer to 5-10. But that's never both­ered him. 
"I don't have the little-man syndrome because I'm not that little," Stubblefield insists. 
He's certainly a big enough target for Orton. 
The two have developed a close friendship on and off the field, and the Boilermakers, who play at Notre Dame on Saturday, 
are reaping the 
benefits.

The original Washington Senators played 4,610 home games before becoming the Minnesota Twins after the 1960 season, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. The expansion Senators played 883 home games before moving to Texas. 
In the Senators' last game, on Sept. 30, 1971, they led the New York Yankees 7-5 with two outs in the ninth inning when fans seeking souvenirs went on the RFK Stadium field, which could not be cleared. The Yankees wound up winning the game in a forfeit.

They hooked up on the field for the first time later that season, when Orton threw two touchdown passes to Stubblefield in the 2001 Sun Bowl -and they haven't slowed down since.

Purdue (3-0).

touchdowns in the first three games -eight to Stubblefield ­who is closing in on the Big Ten and NCAA records for career receptions. 
"They have a feel for one another," Tiller said Tuesday. "They're not attached at the hip, but it end. The fifth­
year senior has 
21 catches for 324 yards, and his eight touch­downs are three more than he had in his first three seasons in West Lafayette. 
"Before the snap, they really have an understanding of what each other is going to do," Tiller said. "That's always a great advantage for a quarterback. He's not getting involved in a guessing game because of the coverage." 
That much was illustrated on one play in Purdue's 38-30 win over Illinois last week.

the overachiever. He's not 6-foot-4. He doesn't run the 40-yard dash in 4.3 seconds. All he does is run razor-sharp routes and catch everything thrown his way. 
"I don't have what everybody looks for in a wide receiver," Stubblefield said. "But there's only a handful of others in the nation that do." 
It's worked so far. 
Stubblefield is nine catches away from breaking former teammate John Standeford's Big Ten career receptions re.cord and 52 away from breaking the NCAA mark. 
"If it happens, it's going to

Stubblefield for a 34-yard touchdown and a 15­point lead. 
"He wanted to run something different," Orton said. "I have enough trust in him to say 'OK, run what you want' and he ran it and it was a great route and a great play." 
That trust and communication has been four years in the mak­ing. 
"They're more comfortable with one another today than they've ever been," Tiller said. "Orton has really been the same all along, but I see a big change in Stubblefield. He just seems to think he can go out and beat anybody." 
It would be hard to argue with him at this point, as the touch­downs keep piling up and the records start to fall. 
At this rate, both players could be in contention for the Reisman Trophy, but Stubblefield joked that the ultra-competitive Orton might not let that happen. 
"I think you'll see my numbers drop off if I start to catch him," Stubblefield quipped. "Hopefully we can both be there."

The Court of Ar Jitration for Sport held an 11 1/2­hour hearing Monday to determine whether Hamm should again be declared the winner of the Olympic gymnastics all· around competition, or th ~ victory should go to Ya [}g Tae­young of South Korea. 
Within the noxt two weeks, the arbitrators will take the testimony from the hearing in U.usanne, 

Switzerland, make their ruling and finalize the result of the first Olympic gymnastics meet that couldn't get settled in the gym. 
"Everything went very smoothly," Hamm said in a teleconference after the courtroom hearing. "It was a very fair hearing and everyone got the chance to say what they thought. 
"If they determine by the rules of gymnastics I should give back my medal, I will." 
It has been quite an odyssey for Hamm and Yang, who was wrongly docked 0.1 points for the level of difficulty of his par-

Philli_pP.ous~,is upset At Shangfiai Open 
SHANGHAI, China-Defending champion Mark P 1ilippoussis lost in the first round of .he Shanghai Open on Tuesday, beaten 3·6, 6-4, 6-4 by Glenn Weiner, an American ranked No. 133. 
Philippoussis, seeded fourth, has yet to win a title this year and his ranking has fallen from No. 9 to No. 76, mostly because of injuries. He hasn't won a mat,;h since the fourth round at Wimble jon, and this was his fifth straight dllfeat. 
"It was a terril: le day out there," Philippoussis saic. "I wasn't hitting the ball well at .til. I pretty much beat myself out th,~re." 
The Australia 1 was broken by Weiner in the se'lenth game of the third set. '

allel bars routine in the a]]. around. He ended up with the bronze, 0.049 points behind Hamm. 
The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) reviewed the meet the next day and suspend­ed the judges, admitting a mistake and adding fuel to the South Korean protest. 
Despite the suspensions, officials for the federation said repeatedly they wouldn't change the results because the South Koreans didn't file a protest in time. 
FIG president Bruno Grandi confused the issue, however, when he wrote a letter to Hamm asking him to surrender the gold medal voluntarily. 
The South Koreans brought the case to CAS ­the sports world's highest court and final authority on Olympic matte-rs -and argued that had Yang received that extra tenth. he would have won the meet by 0.051. 
Arguing on Hamm's behalf, U.S. Olympic · Committee attorney Jeff Benz said there was no way to assume Yang would have won, because there was one event left after the parallel bars and there was no guarantee everything would have turned out the same.

MIAMI -Jay Fiedler will replace 
A.J. Feeley at quarterback and start for the winless Miami Dolphins against the New York Jets on Sunday, a team source told The Associated Press· on Tuesday on condition of anonymity. 
That's not the only lineup change: The Dolphins placed running back Lamar Gordon on injured reserve with a dislocated shoulder, meaning he's out for the season. 
Feeley has thrown two touchdown passes and five interceptions since supplanting Fiedler at halftime of the Dolphins' opener. 
Fiedler will rejoin a lineup that has endured weekly shakeups. Both quarterbacks have operated behind a patchwork line, and with the loss of Gordon, the Dolphins are on their fifth running back since July, when Ricky Williams retired. Bonds home run fight goes to court 
SAN FRANCISCO-A court hear­ing is scheduled for Wednesday in the dispute over who is the rightful owner of the ball Barry Bonds hit for his 700th home run. 
The hearing will be in San Francisco County Superior Court, according to Daniel Horowitz, the attorney representing Steve Williams. Williams is the Giants fan who ended up with the prized ball during a melee in the bleachers at SBC Park on Sept. 17. 
Williams was notified that he was being sued by attorneys for Timothy Murphy, who said he pinned the ball underneath his leg during a serum for it after the baseball struck Murphy's chin. Murphy claims he is the ball's owner because Williams stole it from him.

NFL 
Eagles have right attitude to go with talent 

Team off to first 3-0 start and clicking on both sides of the ball 
Associated Press 
PIIILADELPIIIA The Philadelphia Eagles had talent. Now they have swagger and per­sonality. too. 
No. these aren't the same old Eagles, who lost the last three NFC championship games. And it isn't just because they added Terrell Owens and Jevon Kearse and brought back Ilugh Douglas and Jeremiah Trotter. 
Sure. Owens and Kearse have proved to be the missing pieces on offense and defense, helping the Eagles start 3-0 for the first time since they won four in a row to open the 1993 season. 
But they've also helped pro­vide another missing ingredient: attitude. 
These Eagles are cocky and confident. They strut their stuff on the field, in the end zone and in the locker room. 
When they're not connecting on long passes, Owens and quar­terback Donovan McNabb are sharing laughs on the sidelines, or critiquing each other's dance moves. 
McNabb prefers old-school Michael Jackson routines, seem­ingly oblivious to the fact the moonwalk went out in the '80s. 
Owens likes the hip-hop style, though he has stuck to flexing and posing after scoring touch­downs this season. He hammed it up at a Monday night game by giving the national TV audience a close look at his golden mouth­piece, grinning into the camera. 
McNabb and Owens are also rubbing off on teammates. In Philadelphia's latest rout, a 30­13 victory at Detroit on Sunday, Mike Bartrum -yes, a third­string tight end who usually gets in just to snap on punts and kicks -became the first Eagles player penalized for excessive celebration this season. 
The 11-year veteran caught a 1-yard TD pass from McNabb ­four of Bartrum 's six career catches are TDs -and celebrat­ed by snapping the ball nearly 20 yards between his and tight end L.J. Smith's legs. The inno­vative move cost the Eagles 15 yards they could afford against the overmatched Lions, and assured Bartrum a spot on high­light shows. 
And, of course, there's wide receiver Freddie Mitchell, who gestures and prances after every catch he makes, including 8­yard receptions on third-and-10. 
Even stoic coach Andy Reid has joined in, occasionally mix­ing a self-deprecating fat joke into his bland news conferences. 
The Eagles are enjoying them­selves for good reason. They're not just winning, they're domi­nating opponents, outscoring teams by an average of two touchdowns. 

First, the Eagles steamrolled the New York Giants 31-17, with Owens catching three TDs in his Philadelphia debut. Then came a 27-16 Monday night victory over Daunte Culpepper, Randy Moss and the Minnesota Vikings that wasn't as close as the final indi­cates. The previously unbeaten Lions were the easiest victim, falling behind 21-0 in the second quarter. 
Five other teams remain unde­feated. None has won each of its games by double digits. 
"The guys can really challenge themselves this year," McNabb said. "Everything that happened last year has made us hungry." 

A third consecutive loss in the NFC title game -underdog Carolina won 13-3 at the Line last season-didn't sit well with fans, players, coaches or man­agement. The Eagles needed a drastic change to help them get to the Super Bqwl. 
On the first day of the NFL's free agency period. they signed Kearse to a $66 million, eight­year deal. A three-time Pro Bowl defensive end with Tennessee, Kearse has returned to his old form, becoming a disruptive force. 
Though he doesn't have an oversized ego like Owens, Kearse brings tenacity and intensity to a defense that hasn't had a player cause this many problems for quarterbacks since Reggie White wore silver and green. 
"This is a beautiful thing," said Kearse, who had all three of his sacks against Detroit. ''I'm lining up wherever they want me to and I'm having fun doing it. They just put me in the open and let me line up with someone that is not really that good at block­ing."

NCAA FOOTBALL 

Indiana looks to reverse offensive woes Saturday 
DiNardo will need big effort from team to upset Michigan 
Associated Press 
BLOOMINGTON. Ind. Gerry DiNardo prepares for each game with a mission statement. 
Last week, it was better tackling. 
This week. it is resuscitating an offense that has developed a troubling habit of stalling late in games. 
"I think you achieve what you emphasize," DiNardo said Tuesday. "We have to make sure we start playing better in the second half." 
The numbers illustrate the problems. 
In the last three games, Indiana has managed just 264 yards and one offensive touch­down in the 11nal two quarters. On Saturday, Michigan State pitched a second-half shutout by limiting the Hoosiers to 41 total yards. 
DiNardo blamed the most recent lapse on a unit that got out of sync and that didn't exe­cute well enough against a Spartans defense that made few. if any, halftime adjust­ments. 
If the Hoosiers are to turn that around against a Michigan defense that leads the nation in turnovers (19) and is ranked No. 2 nationally against the run (43.8 yards per game), DiNardo knows corrections must be made. The Wolverines (3-1) enter the game ranked No. 19 and haven't lost to Indiana since 1987. 
"We have to play better," DiNardo said. "My post-game feelings were only reinforced by what I saw on tape. I think we were all in position to make plays." 
Still. DiNardo did not blame quarterback Matt LoVecchio for the problems and indicated he was not ready to make a change. 
LoVncchio has completed 50 percent of his passes, thrown for an average of 145.2 yards per game and has five touch­downs and four interceptions -two in the second half against the Spartans. His pass­er efficiency rating, something DiNardo has stressed since August, is 123.5 and third­worst in the Big Ten. Only Northwestern's Brett Basanez and Illinois' Brad Bower have lower ratings. 

If LoVecchio were replaced, the Hoosiers' next option would be redshirt freshman Blake Powers, who has thrown just five career passes. But DiNardo made it clear he was­n't prepared to insert an untested youngster against one of the nation's best defenses. 
"Anytime you change person­nel. you have to take into account practice games, the game plan, the opponent, whether you're home or away," he said. "I remember last year, (center) Chris Mangiero started his first game at Michigan and that's not the best place to start your first game." 
DiNardo has already made some changes offensively. 
Before the season began, he decided to primarily use one running back. Sophomore BenJarvus Green-Ellis won the starting job. 
Last week, however, DiNardo more frequently used Chris Taylor and Yamar Washington, both of whom had lost the job to Green-Ellis earlier. 
"We h'ld both guys in there Saturday, and, yes, I like it," DiNardo said of the running backs. "We're going to try and find a way to get Chris and Yamar in the game." 
DiNardo also changed his game plan by adding some dif­ferent plays -LoVecchio on an option, shovel passes and deep passes. . 
The Hoosiers had some suc­cess -for a half. 
What DiNardo wants now is more consistency for four full quarters. 
"I think it could be a lot of things," he said. "I thought we got out of sync Saturday and we just have to play better."

Browns' Winslow out for season 
Tight end to recieve more surgery on injured right knee 
Associated Press 

CLEVELAND Browns rookie tight end Kellen Winslow Jr. needs a second operation on his right leg and will miss the remainder of this season. 
Winslow. who broke his fibu­la during a loss on Sept. 19 in Dallas and had it operated on last week. will have surgery Wednesday to stabilize liga­ments. 
Winslow, the No. 6 overall pick in this year's dr(lft, was initially expected to be out for at least eight to 10 weeks but will now need longer to recov­er. 
"Our No. 1 concern is Kellnn's health and his long­term contribution to the Cleveland Browns," coach Butch Davis said in a statement Tuesday. "We know he will approach his rehabilitation with the same determination that he shows on the football field and look forward to his return for the 2005 season." 
Winslow fractured his fibula -the outer bone in his lower leg -while scrambling to recover an onside kick in the final seconds of the Browns' 19-12 loss to the Cowboys. 
Last week, the first-round drart pick had screws and plates inserted to stabilize the

Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -Marvin !Iarrison always draws the most attention from opponents. Now the Indianapolis Colts' other receivers are getting in on the action. 
With Reggie Wayne and Brandon Stokley emerging as options for Peyton Manning, defenses are left with a con­founding choice. Take Harrison out of the game, and Wayne and Stokley can beat you. Try to ddend all three and Harrison can get loose. 
"There's only so many people you can take away. and whatev­c~r you take away. there are cer­tain things you're not going to take away," Stokley said. "They're not going to take away me. they're going to try to take away Marvin." 
The Colts' high-scoring offense has always created matchup problems. But by handing Manning. last year's co­MVP. the deepest and most experienced recPiving corps he's had in seven NFL seasons. the Colts (2-1) have suddenly become even tougher. 
Wayne. a first-round pick in 2001. has become a threat to any defense that focuses too much on !Iarrison. the NFL's most consistent receiver. In thme weeks. Wayne has already produced two 100-yard games and trails only Pittsburgh's !lines Ward in yards receiving (346-345). 
If there were questions about Wayne's talent, he answered them in a victory over Green Bay on Sunday. 
While the Packers focused on !Iarrison. Wayne broke free with 11 receptions for 184 yards -both career-highs -and one touchdown. lie just missed a second TD when Manning over­thrc~w him after he'd beat the thrown your way." 
Stokley has added a critical 
over-the-middle presence and 
doubles as a big-play threat. 
After missing most of the first 
13 games last year because of a 
foot injury and concussion, 
Stokley now has nine TO catch­
es in the Colts' last nine games, 
counting the playoffs. 
On Sunday, when Harrison 
was limited to five catches for 
65 yards and one touchdown, 
Stokley hauled in eight passes . for 110 yards and two TDs. The internal competition is both fierce and friendly. 
"When Stokley has one TD. he 
wants two more," backup 
receiver Aaron Moorehead said. 
"When Marvin has one, he 
wants another. That's how it is 
with these guys." 
Beyond the big three, the Colts 
have even more options. 
Troy Walters was coming off 
his best season and was expect­
ed to play a bigger role this year 
until he broke his right arm 
during a preseason loss to the 
New York Jets. The Colts have 
not placed him on injured 
reserve, hoping they can get the 
small speedster back in action 
for a late playoff run. 
At 6-foot-3. Moorehead gives 
Manning a jump-ball threat, 
and Brad Pyatt, another second­
year receiver, may be the fastest 
of the bunch. He's been a solid 
kickoff returner. but with so 
much talent in front of him. has

The McGlinn offense proved to be a valiant foe, especially in the opening minutes of the game, when it moved its first offensive drive deep into the Walsh red zone. The star of that drive was McGlinn's offensive weapon, receiver On-Kay Wong. 
Wong's receiving skills backed the heels of the Walsh defense all the way to its own goal line, but, after going four-and-out inside the red zone, McGlinn regained control of the ball. 
After trading possessions, Wong again showed her receiving abilities to the Walsh defense. However, the strong Wild Women would not allow a touchdown, and it was on this drive that Hesmond made her first of two interceptions, stopping the Shamrock drive at the goal line. 
Freshman quarterback Mary Sullivan then took over. Sullivan threw a long, 30-yard run, fol­lowed by a 25-yard pass to fellow freshman CiGi Low close to the half. 
Coming out of the break, Hesmond brought down her sec­ond interception deep in McGlinn territory. While Walsh was unable to convert the scoring opportuni­ty, it did pin the Shamrocks back up against their own goal line. 
Soon after, Walsh senior Amanda Borys caught an inter­ception that gave the ball back to the Wiid Women and set up the only scoring of the game. With the ball back in the hands of Sullivan, Walsh scored on a quick pass to freshman Marie Brenner. 
The 6-0 lead was all the Walsh defense would need, as it suc­ceeded in holding the Shamrocks scoreless for the rest of the game. Breen-Phillips 12, Pasquerilla East 6 
With a slight drizzle falling throughout the second half, mud puddles building and the lights illuminating the slick field, Breen­Phillips and Pasquerilla East played on -cleats or no cleats, injury or no injury, quarterback or no quarterback. BP came out victorious 12-6. 
"The conditions were awful. The field was disgusting," PE captain Allison Ferber said. "It was like a great mud pit, but it was fun playing at night under the lights." 
To begin the game, BP struck first when wide receiver Megan Ohlenforst snagged a 15-yard touchdown pass from quarter­back Ali Brosnan midway through the first quarter. However, the Babes failed to complete the extra point to make 
the score 6-0. 
The Pyros fired back with a 
short touchdown pass of their 
own with 3 minutes remaining in 
the half to tie up the score. Wide 
receiver Caroline Murray caught 
the sharply thrown ball from sub­
stitute quarterback Stephanie 
Adams. 
Locked in a 6-6 tie, the Babes 
defense continuously worked on 
trying to figure out the Pyros' 
tricky offense, full of double 
reverses and pitches. 
"The defense did wonders," BP 
senior safety Rachel Kemp said. 
"The Pyros ran a really tricky 
offense. Once we figured it out, 
we were able to hold them." 
Kemp credited the dominance 
to the team's defense. 
"[Defensive lineman] Emily 
Voge was able to pick up a lot of 
flags, get tackles behind the line," 
Kemp said. 
Three minutes into the second 
half, Kemp broke the tie when 
she intercepted an Adams pass 
and sprinted 20-yards for the 
game-winning score. The 
defense held up for the rest of the 
game, preventing PE from com­
ing any closer than 20-yards from 
scoring. 
However, conditions did not 
benefit either team. 
Several players competed with­
out cleats, causing several colli­
sions. One of the most brutal 
clashes came when Pyros wide · receiver Caroline Murray collided 
with a defender. 
"It really looked like she swal­
lowed a golf ball through her lip. 
She had a big lump, and her eye 
was shut," Ferber said. "Our QB 
was not at the game, and we ­
were missing a lot of key play­
ers." 
Despite all of the obstacles, the 
Pyros kept up with the undefeat­
ed Babes. 
"We haven't won a game yet, 
but we play with a lot of heart," 
Ferber said. "I don't think there 
is any magic formula to make us 
win; we're a strong, athletic 
team. We're just inexperienced." 
While 3-0 BP pushes towards 
the playoffs, the team knows it 
must remain humble in order to 
achieve its goal. 
"We're just trying to keep our 
heads on straight," Kemp said. 
"This would be awesome if we 
got to fmish in the Stadium."

Invitational. 
After his first tournament this season, Balderston believes his troubles may be coming to an end. 
"I've been kind of struggling the first couple weeks back, but my game's slowly been coming back," he said. ''I'm happy with the way I played, happy to have my game back and be a presence on the team." 
Balderston also felt that it was up to him to make it back to this point. 
"I've been practicing pretty hard, [this victory) is kind of like payoff for all the hard work," Balderston said. 
Southern Illinois won the invi­tational as the Irish sent five players to the event, but did not enter as a team. This was due to NCAA regulations of each team only being allowed 24 days of competition during the course of the season. Therefore the Irish could send players who need more experience at the varsity level. The challenge for Balderston proved to be a sue-impossible for us not to be there. 

"There are opportunities. We just have to play, and if we do that, everything will unfold in a wonderful manner." Vemaglia strong and healthy 
True freshman Anthony Vernaglia is healthy after missing some of fall camp with injuries. The former linebacker is playing strong safety in practice, Willingham confirmed Tuesday.

Following Balderston in the standings were sophomore Adam Gifford and freshman Eddie Peckels. This was the first NCAA event for Peckels. The pair tied for 17th in the field by shooting three-round total scores of 222 each. 
Junior Daniel Klauer finished in 37th place with a total of 230. Junior Federico Salazar, who was also competing in his first event as a collegian, placed 52nd by finishing with an 18-over-par total of 234. 
After the way he performed at the John Dallio Memorial, Balderston feels ready to become a contributing member to the varsity team once again and hopes to join the team next week. 
"It's where I should be, I feel like I can have a huge impact on the team," he said. "Being on the varsity team is where I play the hardest and my best."

No player on either Purdue or Notre Damn was alive the last time the Boilermakers beat the Irish on their home turf. · 
The last timn Purdue did accomplish this feat was in l974, wlwn th1~ Boilermakers upset the then-No. 2 Irish, 31­
20. Since 1 S96, this SPries has hnm1 a rivalry of two top foot­ball teams. 
"I think this is the second most common opporwnt that Notre Danw has. and this will lw lnu~ e t i ng I No . 7 6 . " I r is h lwad coarh Tyrone Willingham said.

Irish lose to rival Michigan in 4 sets 
Lauren Kelbley led the team with 24 kills 
By ANN LOUGHERY Sports Writer 

Notre Dame fell to Michigan Tuesday night, losing 30-23, 30-25, 27-30, 32-30, despite a career-high performance in kills by outside hitter Lauren Kelbley. 
Kelbley led the Irish effort with 24 kills and .404 hitting, notching just f'ive attack errors on 47 attempts. Junior Kelly Burrell described her teammate as the cornerstone of the offense during Tuesday's match. 
"She really performed at a high level tonight." Burrell said. "She's one of our best offensive players, and it was really important that she. played well tonight. She was basically the only person get­ting kills tonight." 
The Irish (5-5I ovPrcame the Wolverines' (11-2) early lead in the first game, pulling ahead 18-17. Michigan surged back, earning the next f'ive points. but Notre Dame bounced back to put the score at 25-2:3. Claiming the f'irst set of the game, the Wolverines collected the next five points. 
While the second game· 
looked promising at times for the Irish, the Wolverines kept Notre Dame at arm's length for much of the game. After a 21-14 Michigan lead, the Irish rallied to nearly ev1~n the score at 26-25. However, the Wolverines extended their lead, taking the next four points for the win. The Irish recorded a .170 hitting mark as a result of Michi!-{an 's dogged defensive efforts. 
"We definitely w1~ren 't play­ing our best and they bought their game tonight," Burrell said. "We really needed to execute, and we didn't."

Although the Wolverines jumped to an early lead, the Irish made a comeback and tied the score at 13-13. The teams matched naeh other point for point before the Irish pulled ahead 20-17. Michigan was unable to recover its lead and junior Lauren Brewster ~nded 1he game with a kill.

Cavanaugh defeats Farley 14-0 
By TOM STILES, NATHAN 
DYER and TOM DARWORT 
Sports Writers 
Farley's Finest n1wer knew what hit them. 
Cavanaugh came onto the field with intensity as it drove down lhe field on its first offensive pos­session. The Chaos scored on the fourth play from scrimmage, en route to a 14-0 shutout of Farley. 
The notion that the Chaos ofl'ense might come out a little rusty after not playing a game in over a week was quiekly put to rest. In fact, Cavanaugh viewed the time ofT as an advantage. 
"It was actually good to be able to make corrections in practice during that week in between games," Cavanaugh coach Hunter Craig said. "We were really motivated to come out and get that first win, espe­cially since we were ranked No. 1 in preseason." 

The highly-talented Chaos defense dominated the Finest offense throughout the night, recording its second shutout in, as many games this season. Farley was held to only 80 yards of total offense for the game, as constant pressure from the defensive line kept Farley's offense ofT-balance.

"The three practices that we had this last week allowed us to work on the passing game," Chaos quarterback Lisa Ruffer said. "We knew we had to win this game." 
Ruffer contributed to the team's success by throwing for 155 yards and two touchdowns and running for another 35 yarli s. Despite her contribution to t 1e total yards the Chaos gained, she still credited the defense for the win. 
"We always try to shout and scream to motivate our defense and intimidate the other team," Ruffer said. "We want the defense to know how important the)' are."
