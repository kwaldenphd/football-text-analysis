AffairsCofllfllittee, Trustees n1eet to discuss aspects of student life 
by Rosemary Mills Editor-in-Chief and Tony Pace Editor Emen'tus 
The Student Affairs committee of the Board of Trustees met with student leaders yesterday afternoon to discuss various aspects of student life. The major proposal of the day, made by Student Rody Vice-President Bill Vtta, was for the resurfacing of the floor of Stepan Center in order to make more effective use of the building as an athletic facility. 
The proposal was made in response to what Vita called overcrowding resulting from an increase in the use of existing athletic facilties by varsity, club, interhall and tntramural sports. 
"In the warm weather," the proposal reads, "overflow from indoor facilities IS accomodated by the outside basketball courts and volleyball sites set up by many of tht· dorms. This includes the basketball courts behind the Hammes Bookstore and in front of Stepan Center. The problem remains, however, that during the five months between November and April, a major portion of the school year, outdoor facilities are rendered,, useless by the inclemency of the weather. 
Srudent A fairs committee chairman Jack Schneider responded favorably to Vita's propos­al. He indicated 1har it was a positive step toward making some complete use of a good building. 
Although the cost of the project was not discussed at length, Vita said that the lowest possible cost for the project would be $8,000. 
The proposal concludes by recommending that "the responsibility of producing and implementing this program be delegated to the Offices of Student Affairs and Maintenance in conjunction with Student Government." Schneider stated that the Commitcee would recommend the proposal to the full Board of Trustees. 
The Student Affairs committee, according to Schneider, serves as a link between students and the full Board of Trustees. Student initiated proposals, such as the resurfacing of the Stepan Center floor, are reviewed by the Student Affairs committee which then recommends a course of action for the proposal to the full Board. 
The members of the Student Affairs commit­tee are: Schneider, Donald J. Mattews, Paul Hellmuth, Jane C. Pfeiffer, Catherine B. Cleary, the Honorable John D. Rockefeller IV, Anthony 
F. Early, Donald Keough, Fr. Thomas Blantz, Fr. John Van Wolvlear and Fr. Gregory Green. Pfetffer, Cleary, Rockefeller and Early were not in attendance at yesterday's meeting. 
The committee was also presented with a proposal to ammend the by-laws of the campus

Those students who did vote, however, voted in favor· of the b(>ycott by a narrow margin of 10 votes. The results show that 10 out of 16 men's dorms rejected the measure while all of the women's dorms favored the boycott. 
Members of the Ohio Farm­workers Support Committee (OFSC) declined to spr-culate on the disparity of support be­tween male and female dorms. They did, however, offer rea­sons for the weak turnout. 
"Timing was the problem," stated committee member Rick Coronado. "Students were feeling pressured by exams and papers and many were engross­ed in room picks," he said. 
Coronado also believed that the issue had not been suffic­iently discussed. "I had the feeling that students didn4 t look into the issue as well as they should have," he remarked. Coronado was also surprized at the voter turnout because of 1973 student support of the lettuce and grape referenda. 
Committee organizer Anne Huber stated that the boycott may have been rejected "be­cause the issue became one of

NEW YORK (AP)-Americans overwhelmingly favor President Carter's proposal for a windfall profits tax on oil companies even if they don't care much fo; his decision to lift price controls on domestic crude oil, an Associated Press-NBC News poll shows. 
The public favors a new tax to keep oil company profits down, and they also blame oil companies the most for higher prices on gasoline and heating oil, accordmg to the poll, taken Monday and Tuesday. 
Their rejection of Carter's statement that "the energy crisis is real,'' apears to lie behind the public's refusal to accept removal of oil price controls as a necessary element of national energy policy. 
On April 5, Carter made the s~cond f!l~jor e~ergy speech of h~s adm_1~1strauon, announcing h1s dec1s10n to gradually lift price controls on old domestic crude oil and asking Congress to impose a new tax on oil companies to prevent them from reaping excessive profits due to his decision.

The president argues that 
lifting price controls would give 
greater incentives for searching 
for new oil fields. But now, less 
than a month after his speech, 
the public doesn't accept that 
rationale for lifting oil price 
controls. 
Carter's decision gathered 
the support of only 37 percent ·of the public, while half said they opposed it. Thirteen percent of the 1,600 adults mterviewed nationwide by tele­
phone were not sure. 
But the flipside of Carter's 
decision -askmg for a .windfall

~rew substantiar public back­
mg. 
Nearly two-thirds of those interviewed said they support a 
new tax on oil companies. 
About 24 percent opposed the 
action and 10 percent were not 
sure. 
One of the undercurrents in 
public opnion about energy that 
lies behind these results is a 
substantial negative feeling 
about he oil companies. 
Thirty-nine percent of 
those interviewed laid the 
blame for higher gasoline and 
heating oil prices at the door of 
the oil compnies. Next in line 
for blame came the oil pro­
ducing countries, named by 29 
percent. The U.S. government 
was picked by 19 percent. The 
rest of the respondents

other targets or were not sure.

and were to resume the tally at 10 a.m. (5 a.m. EDT). 
At that point, with results in from 500 of the 635 parlia­mentary districts, the Conser­vatives had 248 seats, Labor 240, Liberals 7, minor parties 5. 
A total of 318 seats are needed for a majority. 
Computer projections by three British news organiza­tions said the Conservatives had halted five years of socialist rule by Prime Minister ] ames Callaghan's Labor Party. The British Broadcasting Corp. forecast a 31-seat majority and te domestic news agency Press Association estimated the ma­jority at 41. 
In the last election in October 1974, Labor gained 39.3 percent of the votes and that gave them 319 seats in Commons -a majority of two. 
Returns showed a 74.8 per-

Few women in moder history have led their naitons' govern­ments. Sirimavo Bandaraike was prime minister of Sri! Lanka in 1960-6~ and 1970-77; Indira Gandhi served as prime minister of India in 1966-77; Golda Meir was Israel's prime miniser in 1969-74, and Isabel Peron was/resident of Argen­tina in 197 -76. 
Callaghan fought an uphill battle smce a vote of no-confi­dence brought about a dissolu­tion of Commons in March. Labor won 319 seats, a major­ity, in the last election, in October 1974. But deaths, by-elections and party defec­tions eventually cut that num­ber to 306, and Callaghan had depended O(l the support of the Liberals and other small parties to stay in power. 
The campaign was waged mainly over the pocketbook issues of jobs -1.3 million Britons are out of work, a 5.6 percent unemployment rate­and prices, most of which have doubled in the past five years. 
Callaghan stressed his exper­ience as a former foreign secre­tary, home secretary, chancel­lor of the exchequer and prime minister, the post he moved into in April 1976 when Harold Wilson resigned as government chief and Labor Parry leader.

"There's also the possibility of using photo-voltaic applica­tions on street lighting," Ma­hern said in an interview. ''The cities have been trying to get the state to pick up the tab for lighting the interstates as they pass through the cities. This has really been a financial burden on the cities. But it is now possible to install the photo-voltaic cells that convert sunlight to electricity, put a battery in the base of the street light and light the thing with solar.'' 
One of the problems with the photo-voltaic cells is that they are expensive, Mahern said. And that creates a vicious circle. 
''The price is too high be­cause there's no market. There's no market because the price is too high," he ex­plained. 
Mahern noted that the feder­al government already has done a study on how to create a market for the device and thus help bring the price to within the range of average consum­ers. But due to austerity programs, Mahern said, the program has been held up. 
''To what extent could Indi­ana benefit from making such purchases, not only to meet our Immediate needs but to createa market for these products?'' Mahern asked.

Mrs. Thatcher, Dallaghan and Liberal leader David Steel were all re-elected in their constituencies, although Cal­laghan's personal victory mar­gin was sharply reduced. 
Pollsters, bookmakers and stockbrokers had been confi­dent of a Conservative victory. 
Despite teh chilliest May weather in almost 50 years, voters trooped to polling sta­tions in schools and pubs, town halls and cricket ,pavilions to decide whether Bntain should have another round of moderate socialism under 67-year-old Prime Minister ] ames Callag­han and his Labor Party or veer to the right with Mrs. Thatcher, 53. 
"We never count our chick­ens before they are hatched, and we don't count No. 10 Downing St. before it is thatched," quipped the blonde, elegantly coiffed opposition leader, a chamion of free enter­prise, when asked Thursday whether she was confident of wmntng. 
Five opinion polls published Election Day gave her Conser­vative Party leads ranging from 2 to 8 percentage points. The nation's legal bookmakers re­ported heavy wagering in favor of the Tories, including one bet of 20,000 pounds ($41 ,000). Stock prices nudged record highs on hopes that party that traditionally backs big business would win.

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -Two Indianapolis legislators un­veiled plans yesterday for the formation of the Indiana Solar Energy Coalition to promote the use of the sun as an alternate energy source. 
Jotned by organizer Laura Arnold, Repoblican Rep. Steph­en H. Stoughton and Democrat­ic Sen Lows Mahern called for the formation of a legislative sutdy commission on the issue. 
Mahern noted that the Legis­lative Council will meet Thurs­day to decide what interin committees will be appointed. 
The first goal of the coalition, Ms. Arnold said, "is to reduce non-renewable energy use through energy conservation and s_9lar energy by 10 percent within the state of Ind1ana by 1985 and by 25 percent by the year 2000." 
In the event that a solar study committee is named, Stoughton suggested it should look into the area of state tax incentives that would be conducive to the development of solar energy. 
Mahern said another area of study could be the applications of solar energy the state could

Labor Department reports 
Wholesale prices rise .9 percent 
WASHINGTON (AP)­wholesale prices declined in April for the first time in eight momhs, but not enough to offset hefty price increases in other goods such as gasoline and home heating oil, the government said yesterday. 
As a result, wholesale prices in April rose .9 percent, the Labor Department reported. 
It was the smallest rise so far this year, but still far in excess of the rate needed to pull inflation below 10 percent. The April increase, if continued for a year, would l?roduce an 11.5 percent boost m prices at the wholesale level. 
The Afril rise followed in­crease o one percent in the preceding months and 1.2 per­cent in January. 
Wholesale food prices, which. have been rising smce Septem­ber, fell . 3 percent in April. The drop likely will be seen in · retail pnces in supermarkets in future months, especially for pork, coffee, fresh vegetables and poultry, said Lyle E. Gram· ley of the presidenr's Council · of Economic Advisers. 
The prices of non-good goods rose 1.3 percent in April, the largest since October 1974. when the economy was sinking into recession. 
Gasoline prices rose 4.4 per­cent, "the ninth consecutive monthly increase in excess of one percent,'' Labor said, gas prices at the wholesale level have risen nearly 10 percent so far this year and in April stood 25 percent ahead of April 1978, figures indicated. 
Meanwhile, the price of home-heating oil jumped 6. 7 percent in April, for a 12.9 percent increase so far this year. 
Petroleum product prices have been on the rise since last fall because of domestic supply imbalance, the Iranian produc­tion cutback and higher charges from Mideast producers. 
President Carter's proposal to decontrol domestic crude oil prices likely will push fuel costs even higher in the months ahead. 
"There's a wee ray of cheer from the leveling of food prices. which had been expected," said Commerce Department economist William Cox, "But energy prices have come along to bedevil us just as food did.'' 
He added that although the April wholesale price rise was the lowest since November, "We have to make a lot more progress than that before any­one is going to relax.'' 
The wholesale price changes were reported in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index for finished goods . those which are ready for sale to the consumer. 
The department said the index in April stood at 211.2 percent of the 1967 average of 100, meaning that gods priced at $100 then had increased in price to $211.20 last month. 
The price increase since April 1978 was 10.3 percent. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department announced that the 
U.S. merchandise trade deficit was $6.2 billion for the first three months of 1979, com­pared with $6.4 billion in the first quarter of 1978. 
''The deficit was the smallest 
since  the  fourth  quarter  of  
1976,"  the  report  said,  "and  
reflected  a  larger  increase  in  

efforts than in imports.

State Department guilty
of mistak:es in Guyana case 
about a possible tragedy. 
One instance cited as a grave error was the handling of a June 1978 exchange of tele­grams between the Georgetown embassy and Washington. 
U.S. ambassador John Burke recommended in his cable that he be authorized to ask the Guyana ~overnment to take a more acuve role in policing the commune. 
But, the report said, the embassy staff was fearful the Peoples Temple would obtain a copy of the cable through the Freedom of Information Act, which gives citizens the right to see government documents. The temple was adept at seizing on any shred of evidence to claim harassment and conspiracy, the report said. 
Therefore, the cable contained none of the embassy staff's subjective evaluauons of paranoia of Jones or the potential for tragedy. 
Burke's recommendation for urging more Guyanese super­vision of the commune was rejected by the State Department in Washington "because it could be construed by some as U.S. government interference. '' Burke, though disappointed, accepted Washmgton's judgement. 
More errors occurred in the handling of the warning from Jonestown defector Deborah Layton Blakey that Jones was rehearsing his followers in mass suie1de. 
Ms. Blakely escaped from the commune May 12, 1978, and went to the embassy for help. She gave a signed statement to consul Righard McCoy accusing Jones of runnmg ''a concentration camp.'' 
Ms. Blakey flew to Washington with McCoy after the embassy gave her an emergency passport. On the plane, she told him about the suicide rehearsals. 
A month later, in San Francisco, she signed an affidavit repeating her charges. 
Copies were sent to the department. 
Her warnings had little or no impact, the report said. The statement she signed at the· embassy was never forwarded to Washington.

WASHINGTON (AP) . The State Department was guilty of extreme inefficiency and serious mistakes in judgement in its reaction to events leading up to the mass murder-suicide at the Peoples Temple commune in Guyana, a depart­ment report said yesterday. 
But the report said it would be "pure speculation" to say whether improved performance by the department might have prevented the deaths of Rep. Leo J. Ryan, D-Calif., and four companions or those of more than 900 followers of the Rev. Ji m J o n e s . The report noted that U.S. embassy officials in Guyana 
· 
''were severely circumscribed by their basic lack of police or investigative authority." The Guyanese government did not try to keep a close watch on the ju':lgle encampment, the report sa1d. 
A congressional investigation of the]ones town tragedy also is under way . 
The State De~;>artment report, written by reured department officials John H. Crimmins and Stanley Carpenter, paints a picture of a U.S. embassy that feared harassment by the Peoples Temple and what might happen there, and of a Washington Bureaucracy that buried warnings it received

Education 
Department 
holds fair 
by Ellen Buddy Saint Mary's Editor 
Today adn tomorrow the department of Education at Saint Mary's Collge is hosting a Curriculum Fair-. The fair is the climax of an experimental lab­oratory class that was initiated by the department of education this semester. 
The course is team taught by Dr. Karilee Watson and Dr. Albert Shannon. The students in this course have spent their class time developing the cur­riculum, planning activities, forming-committees and taking field tnps just as they would as actual elementary school teach­ers. 
They formulated instruction­al units in the areas of Langu­age Arts, Social Studies, Math and Science. The development of the instructional units in­clude not only the daily plan­ning of classroom activities, but also the creation and~,construc­tion of all the materials such as educational games, maps, worksheets and furniture that would be used in such an instructional unit.

Demand for coal 

to rtse 
WASHINGTON [AP]-National Coal production could triple without necessitating a rollback in federal environmental health and safety standards, a con­gressional agency reported yes­terday. 
However. in a report to Congress, the Office of Tech­nology Assessment said the demand for coal will stay rela­tively level unless other fuel options are denied to industry and power plants. 
·'Coal is nor normally the fuel of choice unless it offers a large cost advantage.·· the report said. ··Many users will prefer oil and narural gas as long as they are available despite high­er ·prices, because of their greater convenience and lo:wer capital investment requtre­mcnrs. ·' 
Environmental, health and 
safetv laws add ·'substantially'· 
to the cost of producing and 
using coal, thus reducing it's 
competitiveness, the agency's 
report said. . . 
Bur if a sharp tncrease to demand for coal develops, the report added. "A tripling of coal production and use by 2000 appears to be possible without etther substantial regulatory relaxati~m ~~ major technical innovations. 
As it looks now, coal demand should at least double by the turn of the century because of likely shortages of competing fuels.,it said. 
The report said that if coal becomes the nation's main source of fuel, environmental conrols should prevent a repeat of "at least the worst of coal's past impacts, soot-laden cities, scarred landscapes and ruined or discolored waterways. 
·'Wide uncertainties" still surround its srudv of the impact of increased coal use' the reporr said. 
It said the that air pollution will increase, but probably nor proportionally, adding that more may be learned about the effects of coal burning on health and rhe atmosphere. 
Other conclusions of the re­port were: . . 
Existing technology for _elimi­nating sulfur from coal chimney gas is expensive, but should be adequate for meeting proposed air pollution stadards. . 
Mine operator compliance with federal strip mining laws raises the cost of mining coal, but should not prevent industry from meeting demand. 
Existing federal Ja:ws pr~mo­ting the use ofcoal will continue to assure some growth in coal demand. 
Short of a swee.ring new law, Congress can do little to smooth out coal miner-operator labor relations. Coal miner produc­tivity has declined since 1969, but gradual improvement may be expected. Regardless, pro­ductivity seems to have no effect on the ability of the industry to meet demand. 
By 2000, coal miner death and disability could triple, de­spite federal safety laws. 
The trends of coal companh mergers, oil company involve­ment in coal and utihty owner­ship of coal fields are likely to continue. 
Last year the nation used ?04 million tons of coal, meetmg approximately 19 percent of national demand.

astde.'' 
This urgent message is from a woman at the 
Universitv of Texas to those Notre Dame men 
and wom'en who want to see the end ot' sex 
disc!'imination in intercollegiate sports. 
There is currently a strong, well-fun(h d lobbying effort in Congress being made rn exempt all or part of college athletic program.., from Title IX. The lobbying is being spons0red by the-NCAA and a group of approximately 300 universities for which the UniversitY of Notre Dame is acting as a major leader. · 
In a statement appearing in The Observer. 
The South Bend Tn'bune, and pJblicarions 
throughout the country, Father EJmund Joyce 
of Notre Dame wrote the Department of HEW 
saying that only by giving nothing to each 
program could the Umvers1ty meet proposed 
requirements to equalize financial support for 
men's and women's sports. He added that the 
school would have to spend as much on 
non-~evenue-producing wom.e_n's sports as on a 
men s sport that would pay ItS own expenses. 
Father Joyce has obviously misinterpreted Title IX or he would not be so alarmed at the prospect of complying with the law. 
Title IX does not say equal amounts must be spent on men and women's athletic programs; it says that equal per capita amounts must be spent. 
What FatherJoyce and other opponents of the bill apparently have not noted IS that the law allows dispanties in spending, by taking into account the different "nature or level of competition of a particular sport.'' This protects the revenue-producing sports by stating that disparities in spending are legal if the schools

non-discriminatory factors such as "the cost of 
other activities that may vary in accordance with 
the requirements of local, regional, or national 
organizations.'' 
Father Joyce did not take into account thl~ 
important proviso when in taking the percentage 
of undergraduate women in the school he 
calculated that Notre Dame wou~d have to spend 
$800,000 for women's sports. 
Notre Dame has come under the eye of HEW because of the very blatant di-;parity in athletic e~penditure~ ~or men and women. One percent of the $3 mtllwn athletic budget is spent on women's sports; al?proximately $20 per female student is spent whtle the average amount spent on male students is approximately $650. Schools which have complied with Title IX guidelines have f~>Und tha.t increased support given to women s athletics has not affected men's programs. 
Yet Father Joyce prediced "disaster in the areas of inter-collegiate athletics'', ifchanges are not made in Title IX guidelines. Here are a few of my predictions: 
If athl,~n.t pr~~rams are exempt from Title IX, the victory for Notre Dame men will be s~ort-lived. Young women who have grown up wtth the respect and support given to serious athletes will not accept the la.me excuses women have accepted in past years. They will look to other schools after they have looked at the· "great Notre Dame tradition'' and seen it for what it is--a tradition which offers athletic excellence to only some of its students. And while these women athletes raise revenue for other universities, Notre Dame men will watch sadly from the sidelines. 
Renee Leuchten 
The following exceq>ts are taken from letters wntten by Micheal Moyo ofRhodesia, who was imprisoned for three years without trial after being ptcked up by the police in a wave of arbitrary arrests in 1975. Michael was adopted by the Notre Dame chapter of AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL who wrote letters on his behalf until his release in March of 
1978. 
... One thing which I would like you to know is my emanci­pation, of which I think will make you beyond happiness. I was set free on the 14th of April, 1978 at 9:00a.m. As you were praying for my release the Lord of a,l1 living understood your prayers and brought me out of the gtave. Which I think

Right to Ufe objects 
to endorsement 
Dear Editor: 
We object to your supportive advertising for the March of Dimes whtch appeared in the Wednesday, May 2nd issue of The Observer. The information upon which such action was taken was poorly researched. The March of Dimes promotes and finances amniocentesis, a testing of the amniotic fluid surrounding the unborn child for the purpose of detecting birth defects. They advocate use of this technique . in the second trime.ster of pregn~ncy. When used m the third tnmes­ter, amniocentesis can bethera­peutically beneficial. During 

the second trimester, however, amniocentesis serves no thera­peutic purpose. lr serves only to forecast birth defects. Te main purpose of such forecasts is to "search and destroy" defective children. "In 1974, sixty out of sixty-two defective children so identified by physi­cians funded by March of Dimes were aborted. 'Y' [The Wanderer 
Rather than pur their funds coward making rhe lives of these people (the defective children) more comfortable, or, researching for better medical help for them, rhe March of Dimes only facilitates a decision ro eliminate them. One is reminded of Nazi Germany where children who were deter­mined ro be bed-wetters, and therefore defective, were exter­minated. 
A second objection to the National Foundation of the March of Dimes has been the financing. through grams of amounts as large as $38,000.00 of Dr. Pierrt" Soupart of Vander­bilt, whost" research in vitro fertilization has led ro the disposal and, therefore, abor­tion of live human ovum. 
But the main objection remains. The National Founda­tion ''Five Acts-I 976) stares "The Naiional Foundation con­sidno., the most important right of all individuals is the right to be born healthy." This clearly creates an arbitrary distinction of two classes: those who have the potential to be born healthy and those who do not. There is no compelling reason for making such a distinction. Supreme court decisions, such as Yick Wo vs. Hopkins, Smith 
v. Alwnght and Rrown v. Board of Hducalion, firmly establish the fact that all citizens have inherent rights,· regardless of their generic or other such irrelevant differences. These rights include ''/rfe, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.'' 
Although the March ofDimes does perform many benefrt5 for handtcapped people, the aspect of amniocentesis acts as a significant detriment. The March of Dimes does not deserve the endorsement of The Observer, or of any consci­entious organization. 
This letter is not intended as a condemnation of The Obser­ver. It is written in the hope that the newspaper of the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's community will, in the future, make more careful and considered deci­sions as to their advertising and supporting policies.

In a recent article in Scho/astz~· Theresa Rebuck unfavorably compares the laboratory facil­ities available to studnets in the College of Arts and Letters with 
those available  to  students in  
other colleges.  
Althougn  I  personally  

sympathize with her position, she fails to see, I believe, that the lack of facilities is not an oversight but rather a logical extenston of certain implicit ideological assumptions that underlie the College of Arts and Letters. 
The peculiar detachment of the sCiences from the liberal arts at Notre Dame is an attempt co keep the liberal arts free from a certain kind of contamination, the contamina­tion of the present. Although the scientist may respect the genius of a Newton or an Einstein, there can be no preservation. The disciplin~s of physics, mathematics.. chemistry, and t~e ~Ife .so­ences, push the soenusts Into the future. The great mile­stones of scientific culture are simplv milestones, not monu­ments to eternal truth. 
In the arts and humanities, however, the past is preserved for its own sake. There are no cultural milestones, only cul­tural monuments. Dane and Shakespere, Sr. Thomas a~d Kant, Michelangelo and Ro.dtn are preserved. As humantsts we approach these monuments with awe. We seek to analyze their work, understand it. If we serve a useful function it is to prepare stu~ent~ ~o b.e intelli­gent and d1scnm10attng con­sumers of culture. To be a tasteful consumer of culture is, after all, a class privlege, and a

The Pope's Little Joke 
Rev. Robert Griffin 
On June 5, 1954, I telephoned from Washington, D.C., to my mother in Portland, Maine. 
''Hello, Mom,'' I said. I could hear the tears glistening in my voice. "I was ordained a priest this morning.'' 
"I know; dear," she said. "Your picture was on the front page, and your name was in a11 the papers." In Yankee towns, only crooks and Democrats got thejr pictures in the paper; nice people didn't want their names published, beqlllse that way, rhe neighbors couldn't know your business. 
Because she could hear me nakedly weeping, my mother said: ''What are you crying about?'' 
Considerably impressed with myself as one of the newest members of an eternal priesthood, I said: "I was just ordained, and the experience was beautiful.'' 
"Well, Robert, "she said, "there's no sense in getting yourself all-nerved up about it." Getting nerved-up, in our familv. referred to one's indulgence' in self-destructive emotion; it was something, like getting your name in the paper, that wise Yankees didn't do. "Anyway," she said, "you come home, and we'll talk about ir."

highway When in fact, we're Slip Slidin' Away. 
--(Paul Simon) 
Do you ever wonder--really wonder-­why you came to Notre Dame? I had a whole flock of crazy reasons, but there are some very important reasons why I didn't come. 
I didn't come because of my father, who was neither a Notre Dame alumnus nor a high school graduate. He was dead long before I ever arrived at du Lac, a casualty to emphysema and heart disease. He was always the patriot, though. He died on Lincoln's birthday and was buried on Washing­ton's birthday. Stars and stripes forever. 
I didn't come because of my mother, a wizened woman who was a high school graduate, Peekskill High School (New York) class of '40. Her life-long devotion was to her children, and many good ones she bore. She was a fine babymaker, as most first genera­tion Italian Catholics were. ·She produced eight of us, one stillborn. One 
of them attends this fair school, which she has yet to visit. 
I didn't come for Notre Dame football (is Dan Divine , or a bumblin~ behind?), basketball (consensus has It that Digger could get bigger, which triggered me to snigger) or Rockne's ghost (he should've travelled Grey­hound). 
Maybe if I was 18 again, when most of us are naive twinkling innocents stupified by the rhetoric adults lavishly foist upon us to insure their own 
stunted stature, I'd feel different.

Yes, long before I came to this idyllic Wonderland of Hesburgian Hellenism, catholic christianity and corporate casuistry, my spirit was disturbed and disemboweled; by what, you protest?

Why, then, did this Wanderer come to Notre Dame? 
For theology, yes. 
But mostly to partake of her greatest resource: people. The glory and prestige all fade so quickly. The shining, sparkling image portrayed by this much lionized mecca of media hype is crumbling under the incredible weight of artifice. Its true sons and daughters are crying for release from

Adrian continued: ''The story lines and dramatic presentation are very enjoyable. It's just the type of opera to introduce oneself to, especially if you've lacked prior exposure to this art for.n." 
"La Boheme" and "Carmen" are 
the first student organized productions 
presented at Notre Dame. In addition 
to the fifty member orchestra, a chorus 
of thirteen and four professional 
soloists from Chicago will contribute :their musical talents. 
''La Boheme'' is a traditional opera. It has a realistic set (designed by Mark Harris) containing an Inn, tree, toll gate, a gaslight, and snow falling to set the mood. Written by the Italian Puccini, it is a .i:r.agic tale uf a misbegotten young Io've affair betw~e·n Mimi, a poor working girl, and Rodolfo, a struggling poet. Composed in 1896, this masterpiect' is pne of the most popular operas of all time, having 
been translated into every major 
language. 
"Carmen" is a tantalizing recons­truction of.Bizet' s opera. Reworked by the Russian composer Schedrin in the early 1960's, it tells the tale of a gypsy.

Notre Dame has become a villainous

liberal autocrats immersed in their

control, religiosity, and most repug­

Where is the genuine flock, the

in scorning the conventions which 
abound this sterile plain? Where are 
the pugnacious dandies, the Dionysian 
revellers, the closet Machiavellis and

Instead, we exalt an obscure Galilean, an itinerant preacher in whose name more have been slaughtered than have ever been saved. He saved no one, least of all himself. Betrayed with a dusty kiss by the lips of an emasculated accountant; a disciple whose political conscious­ness overshadowed the pressing de­sire of so many idiots--membership in the Eternal Hall of Fame, where the sign posted outside the gates reads: For Good Guys Only. 
Good work, Judas. Human, and quite noble. Having come to Notre Dame for its people, I have found it wanting.

For this production, Bryttan has innovatively included a charactt'r named Destiny. This character br:ngs a heightent'd dramatic etfect to the opera, as its symbolism is merged with another symbol, the tarot cards. These two images combine to give an indication of the direction of Carmen's life in the ballet. 
The Bt>aux Arts Ballet Company of
South Bt>nd will perform in 
"Carmen". Carolynn Hine, Beaux 
Art's director, has choreographed the 
balit't, and will also dance the pan of

For the set design of "Carmen", Brvttan sorted through various engra­vings andprints of Picasso. The ones he chose will be projected onto two screens to form the visual background
for the ballet.
The four soloists for "Ll Boheme" 
include Ann Perillo (Mimi), Virgilio Di~tRodolfo)., William Oi:1r.a (~) and Margaret :Nykaza (Musetta)'. For 'Carmen'., Scott Forkner will be the Torreador, Pam Andrews will perform Destiny, and

~ 
Features Editor Note: This is the second of a three part series which culminates with the graduation issue on May 17th. It is based on the recent experiences I had during a trip to Toronto for the first international World Symposium on Humanity, held from Apnl 7-14, 1979. 
One of the first items each partici­pant of the WSH received was a green program. This thirty-page booklet outlined the daily schedule of events, which went as follows: 
9:30-11:30 am--Morning panels, fea­turing the three preeminent speakers of the day. 
1-4 pro--Satellite sessions. This telecommunications network linked the three symposium sites (Toronto, London, and Los Angeles) via commer­cial satellite and microwave services. The major speakers in each city would chen become accessible to the people in the other two cities during each afternoon session. 
5-6:30 pm--Kiva groups. These were organized groups of 10-12 people who shared a common interest or general intellectual focus. Kiva groups met four times during the symposium. Each member chose from among the eight available typ.es of kiva groups. These included holistic health, myth/vision, energy/ecolo~y/ economics, creative art, commumty/ education, communications network­ing, maps of consciousness, and sptritual paths. 
In a kiva group, the members discussed their experiences, express­ed needs, and evaluated the sympos­um's programs. My choice was the myth/symbol kiva group. 
8-lOpm--Evening lecture. There were two major lectures each night. These lectures were held at the Convocation Hall on the University of Toronto campus, Varsity Arena or the OISE building on Bloor Street. 
10-12 pm--Arts Festival. This was the evening entertainment package. It consisted of such people as Richie Havens, Ann Mortifee, Odetta (the legendary black folksinger), Taj Mahal, and the Symfhony for the U.N. 
The Arts Festiva itself was co-or­dinated by the Omega Company Theatre Company of Boston. This group guided a "Theatre Workshop of Healmg and Transformation'' dur­ing the symposium. These drama seminars attempted to integrate intui­tion and inspiration to then explore alternative theatre techniques, devel­op harmony between the body, mind, voice and heart, and allow constructive .:hange to occur within each person by stimulating their untapped interior 
creative energies. 
There was a specific theme for ech of the eight days of the workShop. These themes were interwoven with. the lectures of the speakers ead~ day. These themes included holistic living, the power in myth, energy1ecologyI economics Learning in Community, the Media: Planetary Nervous System, Maps of Consciousness: The Human Nervous System, Spirituality for a New Age, and lastly, 2001: Odyssey of Spaceship Earth. 
Sound wild, esoteric, and other­worldly? Not really. For example, the day Marshall McLuhan (author of The Gutenberg Galaxy, Understanding Media and currently a professor of english at Toronto University) spoke would obviously be the day when media was the theme; or Joseph Campbell, (retired professor of Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, New York) America's foremost scholar in world mythology, speaking when myths and spiritual symbolism was the key topic of the day. . 
I woke up late Saturday mormng, 
the 7th. Being somewhat annoyed 
with myself, I hurriedly dressed and 
ran over to the QISE building to see 
how the program was progressing. 
The lobby of OISE was congested 
with tables, billboards, and new 
arrivals inquiring about housing, 
speakers or locations of particular 
buildings on the U ofT campus. What 
caught my eye was the black~o~d 
with the words boldly proclatmmg 
"CANCELLATIONS" and "ADDI­
TIONS."

missed the first morning panel. It was cancelled, and ( mvemently shuffled into the 1-4 pm time slot. This made 
me apprehensive, since this time period was designated for the satellite transmissions. Was there going to be satellite seminars? I though someth­ing was seriously amiss, and I was determined to pierce the veneer of hospitality and instant comradeship and discover why the schedule was being altered on the very first day. 
· 1 d ·
The mormng pane seeme mterest­ing enough. It was comprised of Mtchio Kushi, an expert in macrobiotic diet; Buckminster Fuller, the 84-year­old patron saint of alternative move­ments; and Nancy Todd, the director of New Alchemy Institute in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, an experimental group . dedicated to redirecting mod-· ern technology toward supporting
ecologically-sound networks of self­suffictent communities. The purpose of the morning panel was to engage in free form dialogue

with symposium attendants, answering queries and offering words of wisdom to those seekinl! it. 
It was almost noon. I asked a staff 
~.member about the satellite hookup. Would there be one today? He spoke to me methodically, attempting to assuage my skepticism with a preten­tious spiritual atr. 
He explained that there was a slight malfunction in one of the microwave stations, which would result in a one-day delay of satellite communica­tions. However, a taping of speakers (scheduled in Los Angeles and London) was being made, so that I (and other members at Toronto) would be able to view therr later in the week. 
Wonderful, wonderful I thought. Saturday'sscheduledsatellite speakers were Elizabeth Kubler-Ross (LA), Marcel Marceau (London), Sri Chinmoy and Bucky Fuller (Toronto). I wasn't quite satisfied with his seemingly suspect explanation, so I sought another, which I quickly dis­covered only added to the confusion. The second "official" expanded the cancellation of the satellite sessions until Tuesday. I was now quite perturbed. Upon pressing him further, his ignorance ~ave way. ''As far as I know, there mtght not be any satellites at all.'' 
I had a much deeper understanding of the Galilean's words--' 'the blind lead the blind" --after I spoke to yet another staff member. Being more intellectually dishevelled than the other two, his concocted narrative was at least more interesting, albeit more 
absurd. His gospel went like this: the symposium officials had cancelled
the satellite seminars for financial 
reasons! "It took 2 1/2 years to realize this fact?" I asked him. 
He sheepishly replied that the recent costs became prohibitively high. This revelation had only recently been bestowed from the gods of Humanitarian Olympus, I assumed, upon the symposium's hierarchy of money maHagers. He wasn't finished. 
"We also lost our London connec­tion." "Where, and how?" 
"I'm not positive, but there was a technical blowout in the London sub­station. This is being re'ctified. However even when the microwave is 
1 fixed, th~re's another hitch. Toronto city officials invoked a 1917 fire ordinance last Thursday (Apnl 5th) prohibiting us from using the Varsity Arena. This is where all of ouir the satellite, now there would be nowhere to show it. It would take several days to transport all the material to Convocation Hall, and the university won't allow us to set there anyway. The officials claim the build­ing is a firetrap, and for the size crowd we anticipate, they feel it would be a dangerous risk." 
If this scenario seems implausible to you, the reader, I experienced it. Having travelled over 500 miles (it seemed like 5000 with North Central at the heln;t), I never expected a humani-­tarian adventure would degenerate into a circus. But it did. Reason never had a chance, particularly in light of--you guessed tt!--a fourth explana­tion. 
This one was more mundane, since it dealt with the machinations of the British political system. This charac­ter assured me that his particular story was "the truth,"~and the best thing for me to do was to forget that I ever spoke to anyone else. I was about to be. delivered from my womb of ignorance, but yet I felt this jeremiah had more sorrowful news. 
''Because of the recent recall elec­tions in England between the Conser­vatives and Labor (all you poly-sci and government majors should get into this one--I never imagined Margaret Thatcher or James Callaghan would abruptly interfere with my life), which resulted in a stalemate in Parliament, the BBC reclaimed the microwave and commercial satellite contract that the WSH officials signed with them. This means that not only do we lose the ability to transmit the London sympos­ium to Toronto and LA, we also lose the deposit that we make for the use of the satellite.'' 
"How much was it?" I caustically questioned. 
"$50,000 dollars. And it's doubtful that we'll be refunded. You know how crooked politicians are.'' 
At this point, I ~rew oppressively weary. These instpid, monumental myths only beclouded the issue, which was simply:, what really happened to the satellite system? 
I'll probably never know. However, this disappointment did not prevent me from taking in what was still available at the Toronto Symposium. In the final article, to appear in the graduation issue, I will give you a taste of the colorful optimtsm of Bucky Fuller's philosophy; Joseph Campbell's incredible discoveries about some very ancient myths, espec­ially the Christian myths of creation, incarnation, and the second coming; and som~ general impressions of Toronto, acity of magnificent beauty, cleanliness and almost awesome pros­perity.

Hesburgh to officiate ceremony 
An informal ground breaking ceremony for a new chemistry hall will take place today at 1:30 
p.m. near the southeast end of 
Nieuwland Science Hall. 
University President Fr. Theodore Hesburgh will offici­ate at the ceremony and bless the site. 
The facility will cost an estimated six million dollars to build. The Stepan Chemical 
Company  has  donated  $1.5  
million  of  that  sum.  The  
building  will  be  name  the  
Stepan Chemistry Hall.  

Alfred C. Stepan, the founder and chairman of the company is an alumnus and trustee of the University. 
Mr. and Mrs. Stepan will participate in the ground break­mg ceremonies and University Provost 0. Timothy O'Meara will serve as master of cere­monies. The University Trus­tees and officers will attend as well as the officials of the College of Science.

The committee also heard reports on the status of the Judicial Council and the Off-Cam­pus Council. 
Judicial Coordinator Jim O'Hare stressed a need for the increased visibility of the Judicial Council. He plans to heighten student awareness of the Council by holding workshops for hall j-board chairman and hall j-boards. O'Hare would also like to see j-board chairmen participate in freshman orientation and bring speakers on student rights to campus. 
The Judicial Coordinator told the committee that he would like to make the Judicial Council more responsive to student neeJs; research and propose changes in University rules, regulations and procedures; continue to strengthen the efforts of hall j-boards and increase student awareness of present judicial procedure. 
Off-Campus Commissioner Shannon Neville summarized the accomplishments and goals fo the Off-Campus Council. She particularly emphasized the need for a full-time Off-Campus Housing director.

Schneider noted that social space has been discussed at every meeting of the Committee ever since he has been a member. 
The $84,000 figure is the sum of individual requests from each hall and was included in a lengthy report containing requests and statements on the social space situations in individual halls. 
Former Student Body Vice-President Mike Roohan presented a report on the performance of student government during the past year and his assessment of student attitudes toward the administration. Roohan indicated that some student dissatisfaction with the administration resulted from a lack of visibility on the part of administration officials. 
Representatives from lnPIRG presented a report on an optional check-off funding mechan­ism for.their organization. The mechanism had been approved earlier by University President Fr. Theodore Hesburgh. 
The meeting concluded with a discussion of the role of graduate students at Notre Dame.

Person-rems measure the to­tal radiation exposure in a given population. The figures repre­sent the product of the number of peiople livng in the area multiplied by the average dose received by each indtvidual, measure in "rems." 
A rem is the standard unit of radiation exposure. An indivi­dual dose of 600 rems is considered fatal and 10 rems can damage vital organs. The average person receives close to 200 millirems a year fr~m background radiation, medtcal X-rays, home appliances and other sources. A millirem is one-thousandths of a rem. 
Califano said he based his projections on the traditional formula for computing the link between radiation doses and cancer. But, he noted, ''scien­tists who believe that tradition­a!theoryunderestimates the risk of low-level radiation would predict up to 10 additional cancer deaths for this popula­tion.''

ret:eiver among that group last year, and heads the depth chart at this time. 
Former quarterback Pete Holohan was pressed in start­ing duty at flanker after the injury to Tom Domin, and ended up as the second leading receiver on the team, and the top returnee. Dave Condeni is the leading candidate to replace Kris Haines at die split end position, although Dan Stone, the equally fast brother ofJim, should provide depth at tha.t position. Mike Boushka was also a leading candidate for one of the receiver positions, but a separated shoulder will keep him our of the Blue-Gold con­test. 
In the backfield, Notre Dame returns four players who had a lot of playing time, including last year's leading ground gainer, Vagas Ferguson. 
"Right now we have as much depth at halfback and fullback as any spot on the team,'' said offensive back coach Jim Grueden. ''All the guys are working hard, and are all talented as well. They know what it takes to win, and they work well together.'' 
~In addition to Ferguson, who rushed for 1192 yards last season and is a candidate for All-American honors this year, the Irish also return junior Jim Stone at halfback and senior Dave Mitchell and sophomore Pete Buchanan at fullback. All were used in the backfield last year. Bernie Adell, Ty Barber, and Joe W ozneak have also had strong springs, giving the coaches plenty to draw from in the backfield. 
So with all this strength displayed at the various posi­tions, it would seem that no matter who gets the nod for the quarterback slot, he will have a talented group of athletes to help him out. 
Simms is a quarterback. While he may be talented, he certainly would have lasted another round or two if the Giants had not heed so desperate for a quarterback. Some of the players who were still available when the Giants picked were: Missouri tight end Kellen Winslow, LSU running back Charles Alexander, Oklahoma guard Greg Roberts and USC guard Pat Howell. Watch and see which players perform better over the next few seasons ... A close second to the Giants is Cleveland. The Browns chose Houston wide receiver Willis Adams. He may become a fine receiver, but the Browns need defensive linemen and there are plenty of good ones available today....NFL bias against white wide receivers became obvious when pass catchers like Haines and Penn State's Scott Fitzkee were overlooked in favor of such non-producers like Tenness~e's.Jeff.Moore, who was taken by Los Angeles 10 the rhtrd round.

curred when Scott Zettek, slated for starting duty at right defensive end, tore cartilage in his right knee 12 days ago. Although the injury required surgery two days ago, Irish coaches are optimistic that Zet­tek will be able to perform come fall. 
In the meantime, sophomc>re Jeff Lueken steps into Zettek's spot, with strong competition from junior Mark Pulawski Senior Hardy Rayam, with Jtm. ired varsity experience, has the inside track at the left bookend, and is being pushed by sopho­more Pat Kramer. 
Senior Jay Case will become a fifth-year student to take advantage of his final year of eligibility, and has a strong hold at left tackle. Case, originally a tackle, moved to end last year to allow Jeff Watson and Mike Calhoun to occupy the middle positions. He'll now return to the inner trenches. 
Sophomore Joe Gramke, who has played both tackle and end, will join Case inside. Gramke was another freshman standout in last year's 35-34 Cotton Bowl victory over Houston. 
"We've been very pleased with their work this spring," included Yonto, also the defen. sive line coach for 15 years. ''The three defensive coaches have been very pleased, in fact, with the team's total prog­ress.'' 
Progress has also been madt.: 
Joining Waymer is sopho­more John Krimm at the other corner. 
Sophomore Steve Cichy, im­pressive in specialty team roles last year, appears to be headed for_ a starting spot a strong safety. Cichy, by the way, may also see action off the kicking tee. The left-footed straight­ahead kicker easily hit a 60-yard field goal attempt at a scrim­mage two weeks ago. 
Junior Tom Gibbons moves from right corner to free safety this year to replace Joe Res tic and Randv Harrison, who shared thar'spot in 1978 
Nonetheless, some of the most encouraging signs, ac­cording to Yonto, have come in the play of some backup people in the secondary. 
"Angelo Fasano at free safe­ty, Bill Doran at strong safety, and Dick Boushka at the corner ~ave all been a. great inspira­tiOn to the enure secondary, and have looked very promis­ing," said Yonto. 
''In fact, the enthusiasm which they have shown is typical of the attitude that the entire squad has exhibited so far this spring. Hopefully, this enthusiasm will offset any weakness we might have in depth." 
And if Yon to has anything to do with it, you can rest assured that there won't be too many weaknesses in the Notre Dame defense come September 15.

Whittington and Leopold, both seniors to be, will more than likely hold down the outside positions with sopho­more Bob Crable anchoring the middle. 
"They will be the quickest three linebackers I've had in my 10 years here," added Kelly. "I don't think we're sacrificing too much in strength, but they will be the most untested I've had."

Golic, Haines play -waiting gam.e 
For pro football fans the National Football League's annual draft of graduating college semors is an exciting affair. The fans eagerly await their home team's selections because they know a good draft means good teams in the future. Sports desks at radio and television stations as well as in newspaper offices are flooded with calls as fans anticipate the arrival of new heroes. 
But for the players who are involved in the process, draft day can be nerve-wrecking and disappointing. The college seniors just sit by the phone and wait. Their agents might give them a call to encourage them and their friends might stop by to help them pass the time, but they are all alone, just waiting to hear something ... wait­ing for that phone to ring. 
For Bob Golic it seemed as thought the call would never come. Golic waited out the draft in his room in Planner Hall. Recent reports of an increase in his weight and 40 yard dash times of over five seconds cast some doubt on his draft status. So he waited. The more time that went by, the more he wondered about his status. He drd get some phone calls: one from a tuxedo shop, another from a florist, and a third from a member of the Planner Hall staff asking that he return a vaccuum cleaner he borrowed. As these calls came in, some of Golic 's friends called NFL information in New York to find out what players had been drafted and how far the draft had progressed. In the middle of the second round, they learned that the first Notre Dame player, center Dave Huffman, had been drafted. He was chosen by the Minnesota Vikings. But still no call for Golic. 
Soon after this he received a call from the New York Giants. Had he been drafted? No, the 
Tony 
Pace 

Giants wanted to know if Golic wanted to play offensive center. He responded he preferred linebacker and then middle guard, but he said nothing about center. The conversation ended and Golic's feelings sank even lower. Were the pros no longer interested in him as a linebacker? 
Before Golic had time to worry about that, his friends had already dismissed the idea. After reminding Golic of the Giants' horrendous drafting history, J ohnJordon proclaimed, "In a few years, that call by the Giants will be a standing joke. Bob Golic at center ... that's ridiculous." The whole room was in hysterics. But there was still no phone call. 
Finally at about 2:05, the call came. Five hours and five minutes after the draft had begun, Bob Golic could relax .. :he would be playing for the New England Patnots next fall. 
But while Golic could go out and celebrate, Kris Haines still had to wait. Haines did not expect to be picked in the fir.st roun~ or two, but he did watch to see how qUickly wrde receivers were being picked. Hames had been rated anywhere from eighth to twentieth among wide receivers dependin.g upon which s~out you. believed. So Hames watched whrch wrde receivers were drafted and waited.

wide receivers he expected to be picked before

Buffalo tnakes Cousineau No.1 
Sports Writer 
NEW YORK (AP)-The last great linebacker to come out of Ohio State was Randy Gradi­shar. He helped turn the Den­ver Broncos mto a Super Bowl team. Now comes Tom Cousi­neau. He may be the man who starts Buffalo back toward re­spectability. 
''The thought I've had from watching the Bills is that they need defensive help. They score a lot of points,'' the 6 foot 3, 227 pound Cousineau said Thursday after they made him an instant millionaire by making him the No. 1 selection in the National Football League ·draft. 
''Being No. 1 is something 
I've looked forward to for 
years,'' he added during a news conference one floor down from the NFL's draft headquarters, the Starlight Roof Ballroom on the 18th floor of the Waldorf­Astoria. 
The Bills had the chance to make Cousineau No. 1 thanks to the trade they engineered last year when they sent 0.]. Simpson to the San Francisco 49ers. Losing him didn't hurt their offense any. They wound up drafting Terry Miller and he wound up with more than 1 ,000 yards last season. 
It was obvious the leather medallion Cousineau wore around his neck, a gift from a close friend, had done its job. ''He gave it to me to ensure my

The human arm was never meant to undergo the stress, wear and pain that are a pitcher's pli~ht. So unnat~ral are the mouons that go mto throwing a 90 m.p.h. fastball or a sharp breaking curve that the day after an assignment, a hurler's wing is about as useful as a wet washrag. And, since every play starts with the delivery from the hill, this central characte must possess equal measures of cool and courage to be effective. 
Mike Bobinski, the elder statesman of the Irish mound corps, is well aware of the pain that accompanies the pleasure of being pitcher for the Notre Dame baseball team. And, in his last year of diamond action, the pressure on his elbow is so intense that he has been ad­vised not to throw and risk permanent injury; in his last start, against Xavier on Sun­day, Bobinski was forced to depart afer only I 1-3 innings. 
Indeed, Bobrnski has had a history of arm ailments that have plagued him since high school "My high school coach started me every Monday and Thursday, and sometimes I'd be used in a relief role," the Long Island native relates. 
''By my senior year was only able to pitch a week, and I could barely lift my arm after each start. Then, there's the South Bend climate. I can only remember about five or six games I've pitched here in good weather, and I'm much more effective when the weather is warm and my arm can get loose.'.' 
Still, Bobinski harbors no regrets over his decision to matriculate at ·du Lac. When healthy, he's the n;Imber one starter on the staff,and last year he finished third in team ERA despite a string of tough-luck outmgs that would have un­raveled a lesser competitor. 
In addition, Bobrnski is a 
member of the Beta Alpha Psi 
and Betta Gamma Sigma honor 
societies, and has garnered a 
job with Deloitte, Haskin~ and 
Sells, one of the l?restrgious 
"Big Eight" accounting firms. 
He derives great satisfaction from the strides he has seen the program make in his four years, ''Coach Kelly has been a tire­less recruiter, and he's done a lot to instill a positive attitude on the squad," Mike enthuses. '·Ricky Pullano has been great as an on-the-field leader. With the foundation established by

"Bygoing varsity, the team would oe in a midwest lea_gue against Division I teams.

In coming years, with added revenues from the athletic de­partment, the team will have the chance to travel to lacrosse hotbeds in the country and be able to recruit first-rate· players on a level with other sdiools.

their efforts, the future for Notre Dame baseball looks very bright." 
Bobinski's best pitch is his hard slider, and he'll use that or his fastball when he needs a big out. Number 28 faces every batter ''with the intention of striking him out. Even though this means I have to throw more pitches, a strikeout is the easiest way to retire a batter, and every pitcher gets satisfac­

When Bobinski steps on the slab at Jake ·Kline Field, his demeanor and class shine through, and he has the com­plete confidence of those play­mg behind him. For Mike Bobinski, four years as a pitcher at Notre Dame has been an enriching experience that will help prepare him for what lies ahead.
