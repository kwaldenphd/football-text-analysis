INSIDE COLUMN 

Turning 21 is the key to freedom, independence 
Senior Bar .... A place that strikes desire in the hearts of many who have not yet come of Mark age. For the first time, I was finally legal to enter this famed establishment, where alumni Ridgeway and graduating seniors reside. I found it to be a facinating place--not quite as populated as I ­expected, (then again there WAS an away game Saturday night), but definitely a place to which I will return in the near future. 

My 21st birthday was one of those days in my life that I had looked forward to ever since I came to this university four years ago. Coming from a home in the state of Ohio, where the bar-entering age is 18, I have been able to enter bars with my friends back home for the last three years. 
I enjoy it immensely, mainly for the con­versation and togetherness that takes place there. Going to the bars with friends is like going to your favorite family gathering, only a little louder and far more crowded. The bar is always the place to meet new people and to be with all the old friends that you have not seen since high school. 
But not being of age while being a Notre Dame senior can really put a damper on one's social life. While the majority of the graduating class is flocking to Senior Bar on Thursdays, Chi Chi's 


on Tuesdays and the other "hot spots" on other nights of the week, the "under-agers" are sit­ting in their rooms deciding which book to read or Which re-run to watch on television. The on­campus parties (about the only comfort for those who are not yet legal) can be a lot of fun, but their size is limited. And because of Notre Dame alcohol policy, everyone attending one is in danger of being fined or, in some cases, even suspended. 
Now that I have turned 21, I can go out to the bars with my friends at Notre Dame, get to know my fellow classmates and have an active social life like every student should. 
This off-campus "bar scene" makes the Notre Dame social experience complete. Not only is the size of the "party" larger, but the atmosphere is far more relaxed. There are no fears or anxieties of being in violation of campus laws and regulations and possibly ruining a future career. 
But the part I like most about this birthday is that, for once in my life, I feel like the world is finally treating me like an adult. Even though the bouncers will still want to see my ID and check me over, and even though my fellow peers will occasionally call me immature, I will still live with the satisfaction that I am a legal adult. 

Being 21 is having the ability to do what you want in society, with the laws of the state and one's own moral values as the only guidelines. These guidelines (especially the moral ones) should be well known and familiar to each graduate as he or she prepares to enter the real world of the work place. 
Notre Dame has definitly been a major influ­ence on me in this regard. Now that I have the freedom to chose what I want to drink, where I want to go out and what to do with the rest of my life, I have come to a realization. 
The rules of this administration, which I may have griped about in the past, have been a key in understanding my responsibility to both myself and to society. 
Although most graduates want to break most of the rules which they have lived under in the past four years, I have personally found that I will probably live my life in a very similar man­ner to what this university practices. But most importantly, I will do it by my own choice. I may have had one night of going wild and not caring, but I know that eventually it will be a thing of the past.

First AIDS victim dies in USSR 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW--The Soviet Union on Sunday reported its first AIDS death, that of a pregnant prostitute from Leningrad, and authorities may publish her photograph to alert her sexual partners. 
The 29-year-old woman died Sept. 5 of pneumonia following a 26-pound weight loss, chronic tonsillitis and bronchitis and a serious decline in the count of her immune system's T-cells, the labor newspaper Trud re­ported. 
All are common symptoms of aquired immune deficiency syndrome, and the newspaper noted that epidemiologists were incensed that the wo­man's doctors failed to diag­nose AIDS before she died. 
They are now trying to locate the victim's sexual partners to determine who else might be infected with the disease, and authorities are considering publishing the woman's photo­graph to alert her partners, Trud said. 
She was registered as a night school student and as a worker at a factory, but police said she earned her living as a pros­titute for foreigners. 
Soviet officials say they have identified 83 AIDS carriers but only one person who has developed the deadly disease. However, they say other cases may have been diagnosed in­correctly. 
High tuition means high quality 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK--Fewer than six out of 10 young people say they have saved for college, and nearly 50 percent said tuition costs prevent many from seeking a higher education, ac­cording to a poll released Sun­day. 
In addition, more than one out of three teen-agers and young adults questioned in a survey commissioned by the Council for Advancement and Support of Education believe the most expensive colleges of­fer the best education. 
The poll, aimed at measuring student awareness of college is­sues, was based on telephone interviews of 1,001 people age 13 to 21 from Aug. 24 to Sept. 
7. It was released as part of National Higher Education Week, which began Sunday. The poll, conducted by the Gal­lup Organization, had a margin of sampling error of plus or mi­nus 3 percentage points. 
Thirty-eight percent agreed that ''the higher the tuition costs of a college, the better the quality of education a student will receive." Among pre­college-age students, the fig­ures were higher: 53 percent of 13-to 15-year-olds agreed with the statement; 41 percent of 16­and 17-year-olds surveyed did. But only 27 percent of current college students and graduates felt that way.

Hospital official dies of many gunshot wounds 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS--A hospital administrator found dead in his car died of multiple gunshot wounds, Marion County Coroner Dennis Nicholas said Saturday. 
An autopsy on Charles McGraw, 53, showed he had been shot at least once in the upper body, Nicholas said. 
McGraw, director of food services for St. Francis Hospi­tal, was found by hospital employees about 5:20 p.m. Friday. His car was parked on the second floor of the hospi­tal's parking garage, police said. 
Police said they have no mo­tive and no suspect in the kil­ling. 
Detective Sgt. Lowell Shroyer of the Beech Grove Police said police consider rob­bery a possible motive in McGraw's death. But Shroyer said police were unsure whe­ther any money or jewelry was missing from McGraw's body. 
McGraw worked at St. Francis 22 years. He on occa­sion carried large sums of cash to pay for hospital food orders, said hospital spokesman Fred­erick Bagg. He said he did not know how much, if any, cash 
McGraw was  carrying  on  
Friday.  
Shroyer  said  hospital  

employees described McGraw as the most popular employee. 
"He was an institution at St. Francis," Bagg said. "He was an individual that epitomized the philosophy of the (religious) sisters, who cared about people, worked with people. He was a people person:'

WASHINGTON--Two out of three small investors who ex­perienced problems during the stock market crash are still waiting a year later for their complaints to be resolved, ac­cording to a survey released Sunday by state regulators. 
The North American Securi­ties Administrators Adminis­tration said 64 percent of inves­tors responding to a survey said their problems arising from the collapse of the stock market in October 1987 had not been resolved. 
"This confirms our suspicions that small investors were and remain the invisible victims of the Oct. 19 stock market crash," said John Baldwin, the new president of the NASAA, the national or­ganization for state securities regulators. 
"A full year after Black Mon­day, those of us who regulate the markets at the grass roots level are still finding a surpris­ing number of dazed investors stumbling through the ruins of their post-crash finances," said Baldwin, who is director of the utah Securities Division. 
Baldwin said the organiza­
tion's survey showed that in­
vestors who had been burned 
were not rushing back into the 
market. One out of seven small 
investors said they had bailed out of the market altogetner or were holding less than $500 in securities. 

Of those still in the market, two-thirds indicated they had changed or were planning to change brokerage firms. 
The most common com­plaint, made by half of the sur­vey respondents, concerned problems with brokers executing trades late or getting trades wrong during the hectic period surrounding the crash. The next most common gripe, made by 33.7 percent of those in the survey, concerned charges that their broker had misled them. 
Senate discusses anti-drug bill 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON--President Reagan warned Congress on Saturday that "time is fast run­ning out," and pressed the Sen­ate to approve a House-passed anti-drug bill before adjourn­ment. 
Reagan, as he has in several other speeches during the past week, said he supports the death penalty provision in the 
measure.  ,  
But  in  the  Democratic  
response,  Sen.  Daniel  

Moynihan praised the Senate's version as the better legislation and argued the House bill "has just too many extras." 
"The House bill has many good and tough provisions that express our national commit­ment to five simple but power­ful words--those words are 'zero tolerance' and 'Just say no,"' Reagan said, lifting the slogan from his wife Nancy's anti-drug education campaign. 
"By zero tolerance, we mean simply, that we've had it," Reagan said in his weekly radio address from Camp David, Md. 
"We will no longer tolerate those who sell drugs and those who buy drugs. All Americans of good will are determined to stamp out those parasites who survive and even prosper by feeding off the energy and vitality and humanity of others. They must pay," the president said. 
Reagan said he supports moves to deny federal benefits to anyone convicted of drug
--·


sales or use, user penalties and allowing the admission in federal court of evidence seized illegally, but in "good faith." 
While the House passed its version of the legislation ear­lier this month on a 375-30 vote, the measure has not yet come before the Senate. 
"We must, we need and we will have this law," the presi­dent said. "I challenge the U.S. Senate to get that bill passed." 
Reagan pointed out that the House bill includes the death penalty for those who authorize drug-related killings or anyone who kills a law enforcement of­ficer in a drug-related crime. 
"It marks a major departure in federal policy," noted Moynihan.

Sense of self-justice obliges action 
One of the great efforts of the Greek philosopher Plato in his philosophic and literary masterpiece "The Republic" is to get his readers to think about jus­tice in an entirely new way. As true now as it was four centuries before Christ in Athens, we human beings tend to think about justice as a thing primarily other-directed. To be just is to be fair: to pay one's debts, to not borrow from others without asking, to do our part in making sure society func­tions as it ought and so on. A just indi­vidual is one who does good to others, he respects their rights and perhaps their needs. 
Thomas D'Andrea 
inside out 
What we frequently forget, and this is Plato's great lament, is how impor­tant it is for us, for our own individual souls, to be just. No less than our society and our world needs our justice, we our­selves need to be just. This is the self­directed side of justice: our develop­ment, fulfillment and happiness as rational creatures requires and even depends on our being just. The unjust man is a warped man as much at odds with himself as with his society, his family and his God. 
This sounds paradoxical. Typically, we think we have the duty to be just so as to provide for the well-being of others. We would think it strange, al­most perverse, if someone went around performing acts of justice entirely for his own benefit. But level-headed philosopers, pre-and post-Christian, and nearly all Christians have long thought that the search for authentic individual happiness and the providing for the well-being of others are two ac­tivities strictly correlative. Though the details of their correlation have always to be worked out in the concrete (an ongoing process and something by no 
means easy), the two have long been thought to exist in a relation of com­plimentarity instead of opposition. 
The self-directed side of justice has particular significance in a Christian context. We live in a world teeming with injustice--injustice producing great human suffering. Whether it be denial of the rights of the unborn, racial op­pression, supresssion of religious and political rights, economic enslavement of poor and wealthy alike (and the list goes on), ours is a world far from just. Yet as Christians we believe in a God both infinitely merciful and om­nipotent. He could, if He wanted step, in and stop all injustice in an instant. But He doesn't: He gives His grace and leaves the solution of the problems of injustice largely up to us, and to our cooperation with Him. And this is a very striking thing. God, unlike our world, does not need our justice--He wants it. And we need to freely give God what He wants because our happi­ness here and beyond depends on it. 
This is not simply or even mainly be­cause God will punish us if we are un­just. It is rather that in our injustice we will be cheating and punishing our­selves. To be just (and merciful) is to be most godlike, and to be most godlike is to be most happy. 
So God won't force us to be just--He created us to be free and autonomous. Nor will our world--it can't. And we probably won't be just if we simply think in the abstract about the needs of others and toss a bit of our heart their way. Unless we are well aware of the need our own souls have to be just (our flourishing as individuals depends on it), we will probably fall far short of the mark. This commonplace of Chris­tian wisdom, often neglected (though certainly not by John Paul II in his recent encyclical "On Social Con­cerns"), is a good thing for us to keep in mind as the many requests go out, in and around the University, for our time, our energy and talents, and our money. We need to teach catechism, to visit the elderly, the homeless and the underpriviliged; we need to take an ac­tive interest in the problems of human development throughout the world and the promotion of respect for all human life. And we're not doing anyone a fa­vor.

P.O. Box Q 
Stanford band behavior 'rude' 
Dear Editor: 
I am writing in response to Mark McLaughlin's column of Oct. 5 in which he asserts that "We need more trees at Notre Dame." I believe his logic is easily felled. Mr. McLaughlin's unique brand of "forestation" is not welcome in this community. 
The author maintains that Stanford University is tolerant enough to allow the students to develop a sense of humor. Was it a sense of humor that the band exhibited last Saturday night? 
This is not the only discrepancy in opinion between the author and myself. While he so delicately refers to the Stan­ford Band as "non-conservative," I un­ambiguously deem them rude. Running onto the field during the Notre Dame Band's post-game performance over­stepped any boundary of silliness or fun. It was inexcusable. And as for Stanford's tolerant administration, they thought the band was so "funny" last year that they banned it from per­forming at all home games. 
Mr. McLaughlin even goes so far as to slight our band (though he denies doing so) by saying that in comparison it "seemed rather staid with its rendi­tion of 'Amazing Grace' at the half." It is an insult to imply that a comparison can even be made between the two; there is virtually no common ground except that they both call themselves "bands." 
Mr. McLaughlin voices a ridiculous complaint when he asks if we must be 
Garry Trudeau 

classy all the time. He makes it sound as if this is a negative attribute, that class is essentially a deterrent to fun on campus. Needless to say, this is not the case. Notre Dame's reputation as a classy university is hardly a stigma. 
The author's logic falters again when he grants that, although the Stanford Band's actions may have been imma­ture, weird, rebellious, and stupid, col­lege is our only chance to act like this. I don't know about Mr. McLaughlin, but when I chose to come here the oppor­tunity to act immature and stupid was not a prime motivation. 
Finally, even if the Notre Dame ad­ministration did ask the Stanford Band to tone down for its appearance in Notre Dame Stadium, what harm is there in that? Given free reign, who knows what kind of "creative, energetic, and im­aginative" ways they would have.found to insult us. There is no need to subject ourselves to such conduct in our own stadium. 
In conclusion, the author accuses Notre Dame students of being lapdogs of the administration with their submis­sive "Father knows best" attitude. If Mr. McLaughlin wanted to attend a liberal college where student protest runs rampant and, more importantly, where there are few blue blazers, why did he choose traditional Notre Dame? Perhaps it is the author himself, and not the entire Notre Dame community, that is barking up the wrong tree.

Manilow's oldies: 'Big Fun' 
PETE SKIKO AND BRIAN O'GARA accent writer 
8 arry Manilow. 
What images does that name conjure up in your mind? 
A born showman, saunter­ing down pseudo-marble stage stairs in a hot pink jacket and black spandex pants, belting out one of his new pop tunes to a capacity crowd of gentile senior citizens and gushing teenage devotees, clinging to his every croon? 
A philosopher (a Ia Springsteen), prefacing each of his new songs with some kind of poignant message, however trite, which might replace previously engr:1ined images of the hcfttest spot north of Havana? 
Or the old beagle himself, 
stirring up memories of yes­
teryear? You know, all the 
old favorites, up in the attic 
with baseball cards, broken 
radios and posters of the 
Grease cast and Charlie's An­
gels: I Write the Songs, Even 
Now, Somewhere Down the 
Road, This One's For 
You, ... the list goes on and on. 
To two dubious reviewers, 
who cast aside both some­what negative preconceptions and much of a Friday night to spend two-and-a-half hours with the Old Smoothie, he was all of these. Certainly not great, but definitely enter­taining. 
Barry tended to overes­timate his ability to dissemi­nate grandfatherly advice and deliver stand-up comedy. But when it came down to what he was there at the Joyce ACC to do, sing, he did not disappoint, especially during his medley of the old songs near the end of the show. 
The show, which featured a talented troop of singersldancers1nusicians ac­centing Barry's every piece, never lacked in energy. But Maniiow seemed strangely out of place cascading up and down staircases, while barking out lyrics to fast­paced Latin tunes like the frenzied "Hey Mambo" and "I'm Your Man", both off of his new "pop" album. 
The crowd definitely noticed the lack of sentimen­tality in Manilow's new, jazzed-up work, and were never really in the show until he sang the first of his Golden Oldies, "Ships". The opening set included such non­remarkable newcomers as "Sweet Life", "Brooklyn Blues", and "I Am Your Child", which showed hints at the old Manilow, but had a new, slick look that just didn't fit the Manilow style. 

His "comedy" routine had 
some bright moments, includ­ing his pathetic accordion renditions of current pop tunes "Born in the U.S.A.", "I'm So Excited" and "Like A Virgin" ("Madonna would have stayed a virgin a little tonger if she had played it like that," suggested Manilow). 

During a salute to his days as an audition pianist for Broadway shows, he dis­cussed the early Barry Manilow look, "I was always uptight--slicked back hair, horned rim glasses ... basically I was a real geek. I was a real geek, that is," r.:r1uckled Manilow, inl5lrii.lating he has left that part of his life be­hind (the jury's still out on that one). 
But one thing is for sure-­Manilow can still melt the hearts of his audience with the tunes that made him fa­mous back in the mid-70's. That was apparent during the climactic 35-minute medley of his greatest hits, which spanned from "One Voice" to his moving trademark "I Write the Songs". But even during this testament to his past successes, the new Manilow couldn't resist moon­walking right before launch­ing into "Copacabana." 
Barry Manilow's new ma­terial lacked punch and sin­cerity, seeming to get old in a hurry. But certainly, Manilow has earned a place in the hearts of many, for his soul­ful music of 10-15 years ago, and he did a splendid job of keeping the toes tapping and the music fresh Friday night. 
Chocolate DELIGHT! 
SARAH VOIGT accent writer 
H
ow do you make people feel good about them­selves after indulging in the richest chocolate desserts that South Bend restaurants have to offer? How about making it a charity benefit? That's exactly what the Friends of the Unemployed did with the Chocolate Fes­tival in the Joyce ACC yester­day afternoon. 
The Friends of the Un­employed, a non-profit or­ganization, invited 30 local restaurants, grocery stores, and confectioners to offer their dessert specialities. Proceeds from the admission fee of $6 for adults and $3 for children went to support the Friends of the Unemployed's free job-counseling services for unemployed Michiana area residents. 
The JACC was transformed into a chocolate lovers paradise. A chocolate moose mascot wandered around shaking children's sticky hands. People of all ages sampled the wide variety of desserts including frozen yo­gurt, chocolate covered strawberries, elaborate wed­ding cakes, and rich brownies. Alka Seltzer tablets were distributed at the door for obvious reasons. 

Just as the Chocolate Fes­tival is open to anyone with a sweet tooth, the Friends of 

Calvin and Hobbes Bill Watterson 

the Unemployed's services 
are offered to anyone who is looking for a job or who would like a better position. The organization attempts to help unemployed people in both the practical and psycho­logical aspects of their job search. 
Kathy Nafe, the director of the Friends of the Un­employed, explains the pro­gram's functions, "We offer help on resumes and inter­view techniques to teach our clients how to market them­selves. We also offer counsell­ing and motivational assis­tance to let them know that we are behind them every step of the way in their job search." 
Kathy Nafe leads a staff of three, paid, part-time coun­selors and a large group of volunteers that help with spe­cial projects such as the Chocolate Festival. In the past Notre Dame students have interned at the pro­gram's office located in the 

First United Methodist 
Church in South Bend. 
Although the local un­employment rate is now lower than it has been in a few years, about 7,000 people are still out of work, The Friends of the Unemployed hopes to extent their office hours and to expand their staff in order to better ac­commodate these un­employed. "We hope that fund raisers like this Choco­late Festival will help us achieve our goals," Kathy Nafe said. 
The Friends of the Un­employed offers programs and services that hope to sweeten the lives of its clients for a much longer time than it takes for a chocolate cup­cake to last in a child's hand.

Injuries plague ND at Ball State Invite 
By BOB MITCHELL Sports Writer 
This weekend the Notre Dame's men's tennis team did not build much momentum. In­juries slowed the Irish as they recorded a disappointing 11-15 record in the three rounds of singles and doubles competi­tion. 
In its quest to the top ranks of collegiate tennis world, the Irish travelled to Ball State to clash heads with four of the eight top eight teams of the Big 10 --Purdue, Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin --as well as host Ball State, Miami (Ohio), and West­ern Michigan. 
"We learned that we are very human," said Bayliss. 
One Irish player, however, is playing out of this world. Paul Odland, the No. 6 player, downed his three foes to cap­ture his flight championship. On his way to victory Odland (5-1 for the season) conquered Greg Kennett of Illinois 6-4, 6-3 and Bryan Stoksteak of Iowa 6-3, 6-2. In the championship match Odland ignored a first set loss and respended with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 victory. 
"Odland carried the day," said Bayliss. "He did what he had to do to win." 
In other singles competition, the Irish experienced some physically brutal matches. No. 1 player Dave DiLucia bruised his shoulder in his first match of the compettition. He posted an overall record of 1-2 which placed him seventh in the num­ber one flight. 
Adding insult to injury, DiLucia was up 4-1 in the third set of his first No. 1 singles match only to go on to drop the set. But DiLucia's · did not stop him from knocking of Purdue's John Winegardneer 6­1, 6-0, in what Bayliss said was the most decisive match of the weekend. 
Brian Kalbas, the No. 2 player, placed second in his flight despite suffering a sprained thumb. Kalbas was edged by Claus Ramel of Iowa, 4-6, 6-3,6-3 in the championship match. 
"Brian's thumb was as big as a football," said Bayliss. "He could not hold the racket on Saturday." 
Adding to the injury list, Wal­ter Dohlare was forced to withdraw in the third round due to a chronic ankle problem. 
Sophmore Ryan Wenger could not end his seasonal woes, dropping all three of his matches. Wenger dropped his final match to Pep Llinas of Miami(Ohio), 3-6, 7-5,6-4 in his final match. At the No. 5 spot Dave Reiter came up winless posting an 0-3 record. 
In the doubles competition the Irish found better success. At the No. 1 spot, DiLucia and Dohlare dropped their first match, then Dolhare withdrew because of his ankle. But his replacement, Odland, teamed with DiLucia to to place third in the flight. The tandem defeated Pearne and Kennett of Illinois 6-2, 6-4, in the cham­pionship. The No.2 team of Mike Wallace and Dave Reiter won their flight in impressive fashion. They posted first and second round victories over Ritz and Lynch of Purdue, 6-3, 6-2 and Schneider and Mersberger of Wisconson, 1-6, 7-6, 6-2, respectively. In their championship match, the com­bination defeated Kaska and Demarchi of Ball State 4-6, 6-4, 6-4.

John Elway and the Denver Broncos won an In NFL action Sunday. Rich Karlls' 22-yard field overtime victory over the San Francisco 49ers goal gave the Broncos a 17-14 win. 
Cincinnati stays unbeaten in NFL 
Associated Press Boomer Esiason's three first-half touchdown passes kept the Cincinnati Bengals as the NFL's only unbeaten team Sunday, while five more quar­terbacks were sidelined with injuries. The Bengals are 6-0, match­ing the best start in the team's history. Esiason, the league's top­rated passer, burned the New York Jets with touchdown pass plays of 60 and eight yards to Eddie Brown and 38 yards to Tim McGee to help the Bengals overcome a safety and fumbles that led to an early 9-0 lead by the Jets. Cincinnati also got a pair of second-half touchdown runs from lckey Woods, who carried 30 times for 139 yards--the first 100-yard game of the rookie's career. The Jets, 3-2-1, took the lead when Esiason was sacked in the end zone by Lyons for a safety on Cincinnati's first play from scrimmage. On the Ben­gals' next offensive play, Stan­ley Wilson fumbled and Lyons recovered on the Cincinnati 7. 
Roger Vick's 1-yard run gave the Jets a 9-0 lead. 
Bears 24, Lions 7 
Jim McMahon completed eight of 11 passes for 78 yards, including an 11-yard touch­down to Dennis McKinnon, before leaving the game with a 
slight concussion  as  Chicago  
defeated  Detroit  in  Pontiac,  
Mich.  

The Bears, 5-1, remained in first place in the NFC Central Division, while the Lions, 1-5, lost quarterback Chuck Long with a sprained knee. 
Mike Tomczak replaced McMahon and completed 12 of 22 for 158 yards, including a 31­yard touchdown pass to Ron Morris. 
Rusty Hilger, who was signed Monday as a free agent, replaced Long and threw a 7­yard touchdown pass to Pete Mandley for the Lions' only score.

gave Denver an overtime vic­
tory over San Francisco, 4-2. 
Steve Young, who took over 
at quarterback for the 49ers 
after Joe Montana left with 
bruised ribs, threw a pass from 
his 3-yard line and Wilson

Rice. Wilson returned seven 
yards to the San Francisco 5. 
One play later, Karlis made the 
winning kick. 
Packers 45, Patriots 3 
Playing at Milwaukee, Brent Fullwood rushed for three second-half touchdowns and Green Bay intercepted five passes in its first victory of the season. 
Green Bay, 1-5, scored two touchdowns in the final five minutes of the second quarter for a 17-3 halftime lead. Ful­lwood finished with a career­high 118 yards on 14 carries. 
Kenneth Davis' 8-yard run with 2:59 to go capped the scoring as the Packers produced their most points since a 45-17 win over Min­nesota in 1984. 
Oilers 7, Chiefs 6 
Backup quarterback Brent Pease threw three early pass interceptions, but ran four yards for a touchdown and Toni Zendejas kicked the extra point in the third quarter to give Houston the victory over Kansas City. 
Pease replaced Cody Carlson, who fractured the thumb on his throwing hand with 33 seconds left in the first half. 
'Skins 35, Cowboys 17 
Mark Rypien threw three touchdown passes and ran for another to rally Washington over Dallas. Kelvin Bryant caught two scoring passes, ran for a touchdown and rushed for 118 yards as the defending Super Bowl champions evened their record at 3-3. Dallas is 2-4.

Green, Rice, Anthony Johnson and Braxston Banks. Rice was 8-of-14 in the air, for 97 yards and two interceptions. 
Pitt took the early lead on its second drive of the game as Dickerson threw a perfect 42­yard touchdown pass to Reggie Williams. The Irish responded with a two-yard run by Rice to tie the game, and the teams traded touchdowns and field goals to tie at 17 until Banks' one-yard run with 34 seconds remaining in the third quarter put the Irish ahead to stay 23­17. 
The Kaplan field goal and an eight-yard struggle into the end zone by Green on the remainder of the drive after the 12 men were caught on the field, making the final score 30­20.

Because the Michigan State astroturf was partly respon­sible for his knee injury, it seemed a little unlucky to bring Banks back for the last game Notre Dame will play on Johnson's one-yard touchdown run in the first quarter, and Ryan sprained his shoulder.

What's the most feared foot­ball stadium in the United States? 
A 1987 College Football Asso­ciation poll of the nation's 104 Division 1-A head coaches ranked LSU's Tiger Stadium as No. 1. 
It's doubtful Auburn coach Pat Dye would disagree. 
His unbeaten Tigers went into Saturday night's contest in Death Valley with the fourth­best offense in the nation and the third-best defense. They crawled out with a 7-6 defeat after LSU quarterback Tommy Hodson hit tailback Eddie Ful­ler with a dramatic fourth-down, 11-yard touchdown pass with 1:41 to play and David Browndyke kicked the extra point. 
"I'm exhausted. I don't have anything left," said Hodson, who was 6-of-14 for 74 yards on the final drive. "Talk about leaving it all on the field ... That's the only pass I had left in me. If football was a five­down game, I don't know if I had it in me." 
Auburn's defense lived up to its billing. Despite the deafen­ing cheers from the crowd of 79,431, fourth-largest in Tiger Stadium history, LSU never got beyond its 44-yard line in the first half and managed only 54

Irish finish sixth behind Rice, Filar 
By MARY GARINO 
Sports Writer 
There was good news and bad news for the Notre Dame wo­men's cross country team as it placed sixth at the Notre Dame Invitational Friday. 
The good news was the per­formances of Notre Dame's top three runners, Theresa Rice, Linda Filar and Lucy Nusrala. Rice, in her final home meet, finished third and recorded her best time ever at the Burke Memorial Golf Course, 18:21. Filar followed up on last week's encouraging effort by crossing the finish line in lOth place. Next was Nusrala, who was 13th. 
The bad news is that the two runners who filled out the top 5 for the Irish, Terese Lemanski and Kevaleen Ryan, came in 50th and 58th, respec­tively, giving Notre Dame a total of 134 points, 54 behind the champion, Ohio University. Women's coach Tim Connelly conceded that this has been a recurring problem for his team. 
"A couple of individuals ran well, but our fourth and fifth runners fell off," Connelly said. "It's the same thing every week." 
Rice, a senior and the captain of the Irish squad, said that the team will be stronger when Jenny Ledrick returns to form and Terry Kibelstis recovers from an injury. Led rick finished in 77th place out of the 90 runners in the Invitational, her first race this season, and

Kibelstis was a spectator. 
Rice also said that the field was very competitve, although it was not as tough as last week's National Catholics. Fol­lowing Ohio U in the standings were Western Ontario, Wisconsin-Oshkosh, Bowling Green and Kent State. 
During the race, Rice, Filar and Nusrala ran the first mile together in the lead. Gradually some of the rest of the runners overtook them, but the triv stayed in contention. 
"It was a comfortable first mile. We paced each other," 
said Rice.  "The results  were  
good."  
For Rice, the results  were  

better than good, they were out­standing. She was beaten only by two women from Wisconsin­Oshkosh, Tiffany Fox and Cheryl Niederberger. It was a fitting way for Rice to race for the last time at Notre Dame. 
"I was glad I ran as well as I did," she said. 
Filar was also impressive. She came through for the Irish for the second consecutive meet, having finished fifteenth at the National Catholics. She also trimmed 16 seconds off her time from last week, moving up from 19:19 to 19:03. 
"I started quicker than I wanted to," the junior from Michigan said, "but the way the three of us ran together in­timidated and surprised a lot of people." 
Connelly pointed out, however, that three good ef­forts are not enough to win races, especially against the quality teams in the Invitation­al. He wants contributions from the lower part of the lineup. 
"It's a team sport," he said, "and we didn't do well as a team." 
One of the team's goals is to improve from one meet to the next, and the Irish runners will have two weeks until their next meet at USC on October 22 to work on their performances.

Men settle for fourth at ND Invite 
By SCOTT BRUTOCAO Sports Writer 
The men's cross country team faced a setback on Friday, tying for fourth place at the 33rd Annual Notre Dame Invitational at the Burke Memorial Golf Course. 
Central Michigan edged out Michigan for the victory, ac­cumulating 79 points to Mic­higan's 91. Notre Dame had 154, which gave them a tie with Eastern Michigan for fourth overall. 
The problem, as predicted, was not the front runners, but the gap in between the first and fifth man. 
The situation did not improve when junior Mike O'Connor, the number three runner for the Irish, was unable to finish the race due to a nagging leg injury. 
Nor did the Irish gain any ground when fifth-year senior Rick Mulvey, shaking off an in­jury to participate in his first meet this season, twisted his ankle in a warmup right before the meet. 
"We didn't run really well," said Head Coach Joe Piane. "But why dwell on the setbacks and injuries?" 
Piane is referring to the spec­tacular running from his num­ber one and two men senior captain and All-American Dan Garrett and senior Ron Markezich. 
Garrett just missed winning the race, as he was unable to catch Bill Tavlor from Central Michigan at the finish line. Taylor ran the five-mile course in 23:51.7, while Garrett ran a very commendable 23:52.4, his best time to date on a five-mile course. 
Markezich also had an out­standing race, finishing right behind Garrett, taking third place in 23:57.7, which is also his best time to date. 
"Garrett and Markezich ran extremely well," said Piane. "I have to be very pleased with them. They ran a perfect race up to the last 100 or 200 yards." 
Michigan's John Scherer, who was defending champion of the Invitational, finished a full ten seconds behind Markezich for fourth place. He improved his time over last year's meet, but the top run­
ners  this  year  were  much  
stronger.  
Junior  Tom  O'Rourke  

finished 25th for the Irish in 25:03.7, also his best time. 
Rounding out the results for the Irish, sophomore Matt Ron­zone finished 58th in 25:39.9, sophomore Ryan Cahill finished 66th in 25: 58.5, and 
Rick ended a_ -··-~··· Irish performance in 74th place with a time of 26:09.1. 

With a healthy Mike O'Connor the Irish would have fared better, but still would not have come close to winning the meet. 
O'Rourke offered a bit of op­timism in this less-than­desirable outcome. 
"It was a good awakening for us," O'Rourke said. "We might have been getting a little cocky, because all of the runners up to this date have been dying in front of us and letting us win." 
"We don't have to change anything," agreed Piane. "We just have to realize people will not roll over and die because we have 'Notre Dame' on our chest. 
"We have to run up to our capabilities and get healthy," he continued. ''Getting healthy is the most important thing. We had the capability to win this race." 
The Irish now have a two­week break before facing USC away on October 22. What steps do the Irish take now to get back on track? 
"We're going to take these two weeks and go back to the drawing board," said Ryan Cahill. "We know we're one of the best teams in the country

L.A. wins to knot series 2-2 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK --Kirk Gibson homered with two outs in the 12th inning and Orel Hershiser, who twice failed to win games as a starter, got the final out as the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the New York Mets 5-4 to even the National League playoffs at two games apiece. 
Hershiser, called into a bases-loaded, two-out situation as the seventh Dodgers pitcher of the day, got Kevin McReynolds on a pop fly to cen­ter fielder John Shelby. 
Alejandro Pena got .the vic­tory with three innings of hit­less relief as the Dodgers played without reliever Jay Howell. Howell was suspended Sunday for using an illegal sub­stance in his glove. Howell, who led the Dodgers with 21 saves, was ejected in the eighth inning of Game 3 on Saturday when pine tar was found on the heel of his glove. 
Howell was suspended for three days by NL president Bart Giamatti and would be el­igible for Game 7, if the series goes that far. 

Game 5 of the best-of-seven series is scheduled Monday at 
12:08 p.m. EDT, giving the teams less than 12 hours to recover. 
Left-bander Sid Fernandez will pitch against rookie Tim Belcher, winner of Game 2 at Los Angeles. 
Mets starter Dwight Gooden carried a three-hit, 4-2lead into the ninth inning. But Gooden, who had walked four, thrown two wild pitches and commit­ted a balk, got into trouble again when he walked Shelby leading off the inning. Then Dodgers catcher Mike Sciosia homered into the right-field bullpen to tie it. It was the Dodgers' first home run in 47 innings, including the last 13 in­nings of the regular season. 
The Mets rallied for victories in Games 1 and 3, but this time it was the Dodgers' turn. 
Reliever Roger McDowell got the first two outs in the 12th before Gibson homered deep over the right field fence to break a 1-for-16 playoff batting slump. Gibson, who has been playing with a painful hamstr­ing strain, led the Dodgers with 25 homers but hadn't homered since Sept. 11. 
Tim Leary, a 17-game winner for the Dodgers, attempted to close out the game in the bot­tom of the 12th. But Mackey Sasser and pinch-hitter Lee Mazzilli leading off the inning. Gregg Jefferies, after failing to get down a sacrifice bunt, flied out to left and former Met Jesse Orosco relieved. 
Orosco walked Keith Her­nandez on a 3-2 count to load the bases, then got Darryl Strawberry on a popout to second. 
Darryl Strawberry and Kevin McReynolds hit consecu­tive home runs off John Tudor in the fourth inning to give New York a 3-2 lead.

struck out with the bases loaded to end the first inning -­he was 6-for-12 with the bases loaded in the regular season ­and fanned with the tying run on second base to end the sixth. 
Oakland won an AL west­record 104 games, one season after Minnesota won the pen­nant with 85 victories. The Ath­letics' sweep marked for the first time since division play began in 1969 that two different AL west teams have gone to the World Series in successive years. 
Boston, whose 89 victories were the fewest for any AL east title in a full season, lost its final three games of the year and continued to wobble. Manager Joe Morgan, a 
miracle worker after inheirit­ing a fourth-place team when John McNamara was fired at the All-Star break, could do little as the Red Sox fell. 
Canseco, the only hitless Oakland player in a 10-6 romp in Game 3, struck back with vengeance. He went 3-for-4 with a homer and double to wind up 5-for-16 in the series. 
Canseco, the first player to

hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases in the same season, sin­gled in the eighth against Lee Smith, stole second and scored on Mark McGwire's single. 
Oakland's other run came in the third. Walt Weiss and Car­ney Lansford singled and Dave Henderson, Boston's playoff hero in 1986, hit an RBI double. The Athletics missed a chance to break open the game in that inning as Hurst got Canseco on a short fly, intentionally walked McGwire to load the bases and retired Dave Parker

and Terry Steinbach. 

That was enough, though, to the delight of 49,406 fans that chanted "sweep, sweep," throughout the sunny after­noon. Many in the crowd came carrying brooms to help whisk away the Red Sox. 
Oakland led the league with a 3.42 earned-run average and was second to Boston with 800 runs. The Athletics out­homered the Red Sox 13-1 in head-to-head meetings during the season and 7-2 in the playoffs.
