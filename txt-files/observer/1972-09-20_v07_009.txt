Disscussion centers on SLC elections 
Hall presidents meet in St. Ed's 
By Pete McHugh Obscrvt>r Staff Reporter 

Student Life Council elections, allotment of hall finances and bicycle theft were among the topics discussed last night in St. Edward's Hall. 
The meeting was closed for discussion among the presidents, until HPC Chairman William "Butch" Ward opened it ten minutes after its start. 
Ed Ellis, a member of the Student Government Election Committee explained voting procedures for today's election, and stressed the need for attendants to observe the balloting at all times. He urged that everyone who votes be registered, and Ward em­phasized the importance of the elections noting that the winners may have to choose the successor of King Kersten should he resign. 
Election boxes will be delievered to the halls between 
10:30 and 11:00 a.m. today, according to Ellis. Voting will continue until 7 p.m. Registration before voting is mandatory, with each student giving his name, class and identification number. 
Ward added, "If we are to create an atmosphere at all conducive to Student Government, we will have to show responsibility." 
Hall Allocations 
Ward brought up the subject of hall allotments for 
renovation, or other needs. He said this money is not to 
be used for gerieral maintainance, but for larger needs 
such as the creation of study areas or lounges. 
There will be $50,000 available for distribution. 

Mentioning that the Board of Trustees isin no hurry to dispense this fund, Ward urged the council to submit their reports as soon as possible. Distribution decisions will be made by Fr. Jerome Wilson, vice president for business affairs. 
Noting the continued incidence of bicycle theft on campus, Research and Development Commissioner Jim Clark described the planned bike registration procedu-re. 

There will be a 75 cent registration fee, and serial 
numbers will be punched into the frames of bicycles 
without them. It will be done by halls beginning with 
Flanner and Grace, where the theft rate has been 
highest. For more information, contact Clark at the 
Student Governnment offices. 
In a related traffic matter, Ward called for the en­for~ement of campus speed limits to prevent any more accidents such as the Friday night hit and run incident. Ward has met with the acting vice president for student 
affairs about the matter. 
Coed Housing 
A significant part of the meeting was given to 
discussion of coed housing. No opposition was voiced 
against men and women sharing the same hall, but 
there was mixed emotions about the reality of such a 
dorm on campus. 
Mike Cunningham, of Dillon, felt the council should 
wait before forming a position since the coeducational 
experience is only two weeks old. 
Jim Ferguson, of Howard, felt that any HPC action 
would be useless. Inresponse to plans to organize coed 
housing study groups hs said, "No matter how many 
'SLCs you have and how much you put into student 
government, the fate of the University will still be in 'the hands of the trustees and the administration." 
In other matters the HPC agreed to admit a 
representative from the Old College, and discussed 
homecoming activities, judicial boards, housing for 
visiting high school seniors, and a request by the St. 
Joseph's County United Fund for student volunteers.

UNITED NATIONS, N.Y.-The General Assembly of the United Nations convened Tuesday for its 27th annual session, and hears its newly usually strong statement, say that the war in Vietnam should be stopped "once and for all." Normally, a General Assembly President in his inaugural address steers clear of controversy. 
LONDON-An Israeli diplomat was killed and another injured when a envelope sent through the mail expleded in the emb~ssy. RDr. Ami Shachori, 44-year-old counselor for Agricultural Mfairs, was hit in the chest and abdomen by the explosive charge. Theodor Kaddar, who recently arrived to replace Shachori, was slightly injured and hospitalized. Three more explosive devices, in envelopes understood to be addressed to Senior Embassy Of­ficials, were discovered and rendered harmless. 
WASHINGTON --The Senate approved a major environmental bill designed to meet a developing "land crisis" by authorizing the Federal Government for the first time to help states develop long-range plans for use of land. The vote was 60 to 18. The legislation represents an evolutionary departure from the traditional practice of private and local control over use of land.

Shriver 
by Steven V. Roberts 
<c> 1972 New York Times 
Pittsburgh, Pa., Sept. 19 -The motor launch cruised down the placid Monongahela River last night, as the neon lights on the surrounding hills reflected in the dark water. The boating party included many of the top democratic and labor leaders in the area, and after a roast beef dinner and plenty of wine, Sargent Shriver picked up a microphone and told them: 
"I don't care whether you love George McGovern, or whether you like me, that's almost beside the point. The question is, what are your going to for for yourselves?" 
In that kind of blunt language, the Democratic Vice-presidential nominee has been bringing this message to the big city, big state politicians: We're all in this boat together, so let's cooperate. 
On the basis of three days of campaigning in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, it seems that the McGovern-Shriver team is getting through, at least to the politicians. Shriver's punchy talk was in­terrupted a dozen times for ap­plause last night, but no line drew a better cheer than this one: 
""If Franklin Roosevelt were on this boat tonight, if Harry Truman were on this boat, if John F. Kennedy or Rob Kennedy were on this boat, if Lyndon Johnson or Hubert Humphrey were on this boat, you know what they would be

Tommorrow night, the Bureau will sponsor the same event for Seniors and Grads in Science and Engineering. On both evenings the events will be held in the Engineering Auditorium at 7:00. 
The Placement Nights will feature mock interviews, a question and answer period, and the opportunity for the students to pick up the necessary registration materials. 
Today, the same students will be receiving in the mail the placement manual. The manual, according to Richard W­illemin,Placement Bureau Director, will contain instructions for Seniors and Grads interested in using the bureau's facilities. Also covered in the manual will be the schedule of employer's interviews as they have been scheduled already.

Some important people are obviously not sold yet. In Las Vegas· yesterday, I. W. Abel, President of the United Steelworkers of America and the district's most important labor leader, was reiterating his position of neutrality in the Presidential Race. Mayor Peter Flaherty of Pittsburgh was conspricuously absent, and Mayor Frank Rizzo of Philadelphia is supporting President Nixon. 
Some McGovern people are still not happy about cooperating with the same politicians they have sworn to annihilate. The local leader who drew up last night's guest list omitted some of her old enemies, and only last minute repair work kept a lot of noses in joint. 
More seriously, the attitudes of the politicians and labor leaders are not necessarily shared by their followers. The reform movement in the Democratic Party, led by McGovern, has been rooted in the

rising educational level and in­dependence of the Electorate, but this year that independence might work against the reformers. 
In addition, as Shriver tries to appeal to "traditional Democrats, the cracks in the old Roosevelt coalition show clearly. Yesterday morning, following a meeting with Philadelphia black leaders, a Shriver aide indicated that the candidate favored hiring minorities in roughly the same proportion as they appear in the electorate. 
But at a news conference an hokr later, Shriver denounced the concept of set "quotas" in the hiring of minorities, an idea bit­terly opposed by many labor unions and Jewish leaders. As the conference broke up, the candidate expressed the dilemna to a black newsman this way: 
"I want to help you, but I don't want to help you and hurt everyone else. I don't think that's fair."' 
As it has been developing on the campaign trail, Shriver's appeal to Urban Democrats has three main 
themes. The first is the invocation 
of party loyalty' the recitations of 
party heroes and ac­
complishments, the insistence that 
a McGovern-led party is open to 
all. 
The second theme is economics, 
the traditional democratic issue. 
Asked at a News conference 
yesterday to name the most im­
portant issue in the campaign, 
Shriver declared: "The economic 
issue is most important for most 
people --unemployment, welfare, 
the price of consumer goods." 
Again and again he invokes the 
democratic record --social 
security, unemployment com­
pensation, Medicare. The 
Republicans, he always notes, 
oppose these measures, and thus 
do not "care about the working 
man." 
The tird thrust is to make people 
realize one simple fact: The only 
alternative to George McGovern is 
Richard Nixon. As one labor 
leader said on the boat last night, 
"Richard Nixon finally brought us ~ together."

what we need is honesty and open 
communications between the 
freshmen and the upperclassmen 
and among the freshmen them­

members of my class the op­
portunity to make their ideas

Comments and complaints abound among the freshmen. I've found that out in my first two weeks here. By selecting two people who are willing to give the time and effort this assembly requires, we can start off on the right track. I feel I can do the job here and my first hope will be that this election can unify our class. Right now, to many of us, the girls here are just a sea of nameless faces. Through The Assembly, 1 hope to be able to bring our fresh. men class closer together--and by this I don't just mean getting to know the girls on your floor or in your classes--! mean getting to know everyone in all the dorms. This is my number one goal. 1 hope that you, the students in my

My platform is posted here in the hope that you will only cast your 

' vote tor me in the event that you believe the following can benefit our school. 
I believe student government should try to accomplish the following: 
Work with the college in at­tempting to establish Saint Mary's as a unique institution independent from Notre Dame but always willing to work in attempting to establish its strengths and weaknesses and this might best be accomplished by embarking on a year of intense self study. Student government can and should take an active role in this. 
SMC student government should also make itself more responsible to the immediate needs of its constituency and should work for now as well as for the future. We should be able to provide more for student needs by initiating more interaction between halls ori an academic as well as social·lev'el. SMC student government should avail itself to those students in need of tutorial help and attempt to establish a course of evaluation booklet similar to that currently being done at Notre Dame, but 

,more complete in its range and scope. 
We should also attempt to seek new sources of social outlet for ourselves and the Notre Dame com~unity were applicable to relieve the "party syndrome"; the scipe of this should be as diver­sified and imaginative as we can make it. Finally student govern­ment should take and maintain a strong stand on the position Qf parietals. 
I feel that individual halls should be able to establish parietal hours as they deem necessary. 
As your freshman represen­tative to the Student Assembly 1 will try my best to be conscientious in my duties, open to any ideas you might have, and offer to devote sufficient time and interest on the Assembly. I would appreciate your vote, 
Sincerely,

The HPC's Task 

A significant part of last night's Hall Pr.esident's Council meeting was dedicated to a discussion of coresidential housing at Notre Dame. HPC Chairman Butch Ward initiated the discussion and despite his optimism, the Council reacted skeptically. 
There was no opposition to coresidential housing voiced at the meeting, but nonetheless, the overriding attitude was one of defeat. 
Jim Ferguson, President of Howard Hall, summarized the feeling that was prevalent. "No matter how many SLC's you have and how much you put into Student Government, the fate of the University will still be in the hands of the trustees and the administration." 
Reason for Ferguson's skepticism is apparent. Last year the administration and trustees ignored the fact that 18 of the 20 rectors on campus supported coresidential housing facilities. They also ignored a proposition submitted by Alumni Hall urging that Alumni be transformed into a "salt and pepper" dormitory. They further ignored a Student Government report on the choice of female dorms. 
Itappears that skepticism is the proper· attitude. 
Time For Initiative 

But this is not the time for skepticism, rather it is the time for positive action. In IIIIIIIII II II II1111111111111111111 11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111IllI

recent times, the HPC has begun to drag its feet. Instead of initiating action, the HPC has always reacted to the actions of others. If ever there was a 'time and an issue for the HPC to take the initiative on, this is it. 
The Council is meant to serve the wishes, desires, and needs of the halls on campus. Thus, the coresidential housing issue is one on which the HPC should initiate action instead of stalling until others move first. 
Ward feels that the worst thing that can happen would be if the University said no to the coed hall proposals. But the fact remains that if the University says no, they will also be forced in a public forum to give a reason and that alone will be a step forward. 
At this time, the University doesn't seem prepared to initiate coresidential housing. But it must also be remembered that five years ago, Fr. Theodore Hesburgh published an article citing the reasons why coeducation would not be good for Notre Dame. 
Times can change as can opinions. And the initiative must begin now if this University will ever see coresidential housing in the foreseeable future. 
HPC's Responsibility 
Therefore, the responsibility seems to lie on the HPC. They have the greatest contact with the halls of any governing organization on campus. If they must serve as an. advisory board to a higher organization (i.e. SLC or the Board of Trustees) then let that be the case, for who could advise them better in this instance than the HPC. 
The HPC cannot let this issue die. It should unite to resubmit the Alumni proposal. It should develop a number of additional proposals to be offered as alternatives. And it should submit these proposals directly to the Student Affairs Subcommittee of the Board of Trustees. 
This would handing the trustees a hot potato that they could not ignore. They would be dealing with a powerful and progressive statement from the student body indicating their ideals. It would not be the type of proposal that the trustees could quietly relegate to a committee. 
So, the initiative lies with the HPC. Itis their turn to lead and to be out front. Action must be forecoming from them. The responsibility is theirs.

Clearing the Air 
dan ruane 
A letter written by Student Body President Bob Kersten appeared Monday accusing a staff member of a "conscious attempt to besmirch my flawless character" in an SLC story, and challenging the responsibility and credibility of the Observer in general. 
Obviously the staff member is myself, and I want to publicly reply to SBP Kersten's letter, and apologize for my injustice. 
There is no need to repeat the quote in question, as it was quite apparent in the SL~ story Friday. SBP Kersten is quite correct in his charge of breach of promise, but not libel. 
After he made the comment he quickly added "Don't print that." I replied in such a way as to indicate that it would not be used, which was just the same as promising. 
It was a gross mistake on my part. I have often criticized other members of the media for allowing other concerns, be they in the interest of one's self or the public, to be given priority over the ethics of good journalism. Just last week I berated ABC and CBS for their stingy roles concerning the use of satellite time during the terrorism at the Olympics. 
It also violated advice I frequently give to others around the office, that is, never promise anyone anything in this business, because there is no guarantee you will be able to fulfill a promise in spite of good intentions, or because you might allow other considerations to enter the situation and persuade you to foolishly do something otherwise. 
The use of the quote, however, was not intended as a malicious at­tempt to make SBP Kersten look crude, callous and bold to other SLC members, the faculty, trustees, administration, or any other group or person. 
My reasons were as follows: 1. After considering its use, I concluded that the quote was an accurate and forceful expression of SBP Ker­sten's opinion of the SLC as it appears to him. 2. It is my impression that this is how many students believe the Kersten administration feels about the SLC and many other things. 3. The story was an Ob­sl.'rver Insight, which allows for some speculation, interpretation, and editorializing as opposed to a straight news story. 4. SBP Kersten should be more aware of his office, and thus be more careful in what he says while speaking from that office. I feel that he treats his ac­cepted responsibility too lightly, and that the use of this quote might bring the seriousness of the student body presidency to bear a little stronger in his mind. Had I not made the promise, I probably would have used the quote for the same reasons, adding "Don't print that." 
In spite of these reasons, I did make the promise and should not have violated it. I apologize and retract the statement. 
As for SBP Kersten's other comments in his letter, I would like to set the record straight. As Executive Editor I have a great deal of freedom to write responsibly outside the restrictions of a straight news story. I failed in that responsibility when I used the quote. If you consider this to be representative of the entire staff, so be it; but I prefer to consider it a personal mistake, and not a reflection on the others since they were not aware of the situation. 
As for the credibility of the Observer, it did not reach any low point during the campus elections last spring. I believe that this is an un­derstandable, but over-emotional reaction of SBP Kersten to get his point across. The Observer's credibility has risen substantially during the last year and a half, and I hope my mistake has not set it back to any degree. 
I hope SBP Kersten will consider this an adequate explanation and response, and that he will be willing to resume his previous relationship with the Observer, with the understanding that it was not a deliberate or calculated attempt by the Observer to libel him or his administration.

Viewpoint 
Fr. James T. Burtchaell 
In Loco Parentis 
or Life With(out) Father 
The following is the first part of an article by University Provost Fr. James T. Burt­cahell which originally appeared in the August edition of Notre Dame Magazine. 
Since the article is of general interest to students Fr. Burtchaell has given The Observer permission to reprint it. No passages have been deleted or edited. The second part will appear tomorrow. ed. 
Time was when universities and colleges proposed to exercise parental authority over their students. That was a time, be it said, when everything about parenth(l(){} itself seemed somehow less ominous: when "family planning" meant planning to have one; when childbirth could be contemplated without the aid of Spock; and when youngsters could generally count on growing up with a single set of parents. But today surrogate parenthood, like its natural model, has fallen upon hard times. 
Few today acquiesce in the notion of a university's standing in loco parentis, "in the parents' stead." The last decade has seen this once traditional legal doctrine virtually extinguished by the federal and state courts. The results have gone in both directions. In some cases, students have successfully resisted peremptory dismissal; the courts held that university authorities were obliged to state their rules more clearly and administer them with due process. In other cases, students have failed to win damages claimed for negligence since the colleges were no longer expected . to exercise such a careful vigilance over them. Hitherto, nearly all of these cases have dealt with public in­stitutions, and the courts have, with rising consistency, been holding that the student­school relationship should be that of a citizeri to any state agency, just as professors in state schools are increasingly likened to civil service employees. Private schools will not be indefinitely immune to this growing legal tradition and to the philosophy behind it, surely alien to that older view of the campus as a domestic household. 
Many university officials seem pleased to 

shake the onus of supervision that was 
theirs in loco parentis. The issue of room 
visitation between the sexes provides a 
contemporary illustration. When several 
Oxford colleges announced this year that 
they would admit their first female un­
dergraduates next fall, Hertford College 
explained that coeds would lodge in no 
special wing of college buildings. Asked if 
that would not lead to cohabitation, the 
master of Hertford stated emphatically that 
it was none of his concern. The former 
president of Parsons College has recently 
founded another proprietary school in the 
East with open dorm visitation. Asked the 
same question, he snorted that he was 
running a college, not a church. 
The most vociferous dismantlers of the in 

loco parentis policy, of course, have been 
the students themselves. Entering into the 
university often relieves strained relations 
at home between parental authority and the 
striving for independence by the child. He 
does not leave home in pursuit of new 
authoritarian adults, but to breath new 
adult freedom for himself. Curriculum 
requirements, disciplinary rules, university 
requirements, disciplinary rules, university 
decision-making bodies without student 
involvement--all can seem disconcerting to 
a young man or woman whose driving 
personal need at the time is to assert his or 
her own arrival at adult freedom. 
Well, despite its unpopularity and un­timeliness, the notion of senior members of the university standing in loco parentis to their undergraduate students in one that I should like to sustain. 
While standing for the formula, I suppose I shape its meaning somewhat differently than its despisers. It need not imply, for example, that the student is a juvenile, while his teacher is adult. Admittedly, when one says "parents and children" the imagination tends to picture a couple in their twenties or thirties, with the customary two or three children, probably at elementary school age or younger. But surely parenthood is a lifelong identity, and the parent-child relationship remains asymmetrical throughout all the long seasons of its maturation. This same young couple will still be parents--and, please God, actively parents--when they are in 
their eighties and their children are gran­
dparents. Indeed, parenthood does not 
lapse when one's offspring move onto their 
own. It really comes into its own only when 
one's children are adults. 
Nor need that parent-child relation always be colored by authority. One of the frustrations of being mother and father is that so much of the early experience of families demands firm parental control. When comes the time for tearing loose, for taking wing, the season for the children to gather -their own privacy and autonomy about themselves--in short, when comes the end of command and control--so many fathers and mothers feel their parenthood lifted from them and are at a loss to negotiate new ways of dealing with sons and daughters. Yet parenthood should have a fuller abundance of gifts to share than that: much of what parents can bestow is only available anyway in those years when their children are no longer dependent upon them. It is a mutual devastation if at the very age when the parent has the richest wisdom and perpective to share with his child, both have likely shut each other off in the belief that the family's interchange is at an end now that they have quit the same roof. 
A parent, then, at whatever age or 
maturity, no matter what his degree of 
control, authority, or involvement, retains a 
total concern for every feature of his child's 
life. 
And why should a university educator not 
stand in the same situation of total concern: 
in loco parentis? We have the dubious 
privilege of entering the scene at exactly 
that awkward and restless period of break­
way (a matter of years rather than the crisi 
of a moment), when young men and women 
of 18-22 years' age are renegotiating their 
relations with their parents. They are no 
longer at their command, nor have they yet 
cast off lines completely. Itis an ambiguous 
time, and strained, and quarrelsome, and 
critically influential. 
Bear in mind that I speak specifically of 
our stand at Notre Dame. At virtually all 
universities in Europe and Latin America, 
at most state schools in North America, and 
now in many of our private colleges, too, the 
senior scholars decline and often repudiate 
all active concern and certainly all 
responsibility for the personal growth and 
integration of the students. The interchange 
is specifically academic. Students may be 
fortunate enough to find one or another 
professor of administrator with a shrewd 
eye and a giving heart for them, but will 
more often encounter resentment if they 
impinge of faculty time or seek their at­. tention beyond what is statutorily required. At Notre Dame it is possible to encounter the same disappointment, but we publicly 

Fr. James Burtchaell discusses the role of administators and faculty at a university which adopts a modified goal of in loco Parentis. 
profess and hold ourselves accountable for a personal regard for our students. I like to think that we live up to this commitment better even than many of those few universities that accept the same charge, and that we do it in some special and precious ways that make our tradition distinctive and deeply memorable. 
To assume to stand in loco parentis is to share the chancy fortune of any father or mother of an intelligent young man or woman. Just as at home, in a residential college there is the recurring struggle to determine who is really master of the house, 
It is no good simply pounding the table, reminding the students that they are on our turf,and showing them the door if they fail to abide by our rules. On the other hand, little challenge and slight growth will ensue if older and younger scholars simply turn their backs on one another. Like parents, academics care aboutmore!in their students than they can control and must often forego command in favor of persuasion and debate. 
Often, but not always. There is an asym­metrical exchange: teachers always have new insights afforded them by their junior colleagues; yet the whole academic en­terprise would not exist save by the common belief that teachers see, hear, and know more and perceive more deeply than their students. 
Like a parent, a stringently effective teacher will be appreciateed only in retrospect . . . and will often have to do without the satisfaction of hearing much by way of thanks. Like a prent, a teacher in­vests his mind and heart in the growth of the students he loves, and can only hope that the seed he plants is sound, the soil sweet enough for future fruit. One always teachers with one's heart in his mouth, and doesn't always succeed. But then again he often does. 
We are terribly vulnerable and we do our 
work for love and not for gain--none quite so 
vulnerable, I imagine, as those who lay 
aside natural parenthood to give their whole 
soul and strength to this other begetting and 
have such single-minded desire that these, 
their sons and daughters, succeed. 
Our vices and virtues are the common 
domestic varietals. Sometimes we frown 
top often when encouragement is needed. 
We can be too protective or not demanding 
enough, or lose our tempers, and (worse) 
our wits, and we can give in to the strain and 
fatigue and simply not give a damn. But 
there are times when the work goes well, 
and we sense somehow just when to push, 
when to wink, when to commend, when to 
laugh, when to ridicule, when to listen, when 
to explode. 

Particularly in these years when student 
rights, and dignity, and Jperogatives; have 
been struggled for and enlarged, one of the 
slur words for the over-authoritarian 
teacher or adminstrator is "paternalistic." 
I hope the word can be purged of this un­
pleasant meaning, for so many of us in the 
profession do feel that fatherhood is is our 
blood, and while acknowledging the great 
risk it presents, don't really want to be 
ahsamed of it. 

We tend to remain in correspondence with 
many alumni--and this mail continually 
impresses me with the similarity of fortune 
between teacher and parent. One young 
man who had lived in our hall <Dillon) wrote 
recently after his first year in grad school.

The transition from a private, residential university and relatively small enrollment to a public commuter university with an enrollment of about 28.000, was an experience even at the ' ripe old age of twnety-two. More and More I appreciate the commitment to a university community that Notre Dame has made. I

Hopefully every set of parents receives a letter something like this after their own son or daughter has moved out of the home into other circumstances.

Counciling center sees role asadvisor and trainer 
by James i\bowd 
Since 1!!67 the third floor east wing of the Administration Building '· has been the location of the Notre Dame counseling center. 
Dr. Sheridan McCabe, head of the counseling center staff, sees two, functions for the center: advice and training. 
Advice, maintains Dr. McCabe, is the traditional responsibility of the center. "We tell students to make the most out of their lives at Notre Dame," Dr. McCabe says. "This means a much broader program than just helping individuals in need·" 
Dr. McCabe explains that counseling has three distinct II purposes. First, to remedy a bad situation such as grades or majors. 
Secondly its purpose is to prevent situations in which students are faced with major problems. 
Thirdly, counseling produces programs which stimulate student interest. 
"In spite of these programs, which are as broad in concept, in concept, student counseling still centers mostly around remedial care," states Dr. McCabe. 
Training 
Dr. McCabe considers training
the second important function of the center. We will train in­dividuals, groups, faculty and staff in whatever capacity necessary," 
he says.
Dr. McCabe documents this by citing a recent training program in Howard Hall. Last year the· counseling center ran a leadership training program for section leaders. "It was successful and many hc-11 " are requesting similar training ::n.minars." 
On coeduation, Dr. McCabe ex­plains that the center has been working with SMC for four years in anticipation of a merger. 
"We have been ready for women at ND. The current counseling staff includes two women one of says. 

Also along these lines, Dr. McCabe explains that Mrs. Susan Roberts, a special assistant to the Provost, has worked extensively with the counseling center. Preliminary discussions have been held with the hall governments of both Badin and Walsh, and this consultation and training will 
continue in Walsh. 
Minority Service 

Two new counselors have been added to this program. They are: Ann Williams, a law student with a 
Arrington, also a law student.

financing operation, on the advice of campaign officials. At one point Stans prepared a complete statement but campaign leaders talked him out of releasing it. 
The feeling at the finance committee is that Magruder or his public relations men would have spoken out in defense of Stans and openly discussed the use of the $114,000. But Magruder has not spoken out or made himself available to the press. 
The dispute between Stans and Magruder has seeped down the rank and file of the Finance Committee. Some of these aides are harshly critical of top officials of the Nixon Re~lection Com­mittee, and have let their views seep out publicly. 

Stans has talked about his problems privately with former Attorney General John N. Mit­chell, who resigned in July as Nixon's campaign manager, and, a few weeks ago, Stans even got a cheerful call of encouragement from the White House. 
But now Stans apparently has decided to make his own defense, circumventing the campaign committee public relations staff, which reports to Magruder. 
This is apparent from the fact that a former White House counsel, Clark Mollenhoff, reported in the Des Moines Register yesterday that Stans had conferred with Nixon counsel John Dean about a $25,000 campaign contribution which was cashed by one of the bugging suspects. 
According to Mollenhoff's report, Dean assured Stans that even though the $25,000 con­tribution came to Stans after April 7, when the new Federal Campaign Disclosure Act went into effect, the donation still did not have to be reported. 
The White House counsel based his decision on a provision of the law which says that whenever an agreement to deliver funds is made, it shall be considered a contribution. 
In the revised account of the $25,000, the contributor, Dwayne Andreas, a Minneapolis businessman and former sup­porter of Democrat Hubert H. ­Humphrey; Kenneth Dahlberg, midwest fund raiser for Nixon and the man who collected the money; and Stans all agree that Andreas promised the contribution last January. They said he reaffirmed his promise in February but did not get around to handing over the cash to Dahlberg until April 9. 
Before Dean gave legal counsel to Stans, he was commissioned by the president to conduct a "thorough" investigation of the Watergate incident.

Separate incorporation of the University Press from the University is another possible solution. By this action, the Press would lose its tax-exempt, non­income 1 producing status. 
"I can see an inherent danger in this," mused William T. Liu, editorial press board member. "The Press director would humanly be steered to take profit as a motive rather than schlarship. 
This isn't the real objective of a university press." 
In its stead, Liu suggests a separate endowment. "I think this might be hard for the University to take," he said, " but this would free the hands of the press director. He could get good manuscripts and not have to worry about the cost. Without a separate

Presently the University financiers are preparing a three­year projected budget. If the University Press's loss escalates as Ehmann anticipates that it will (to $30,000), the Press may very well be the victim of the crunch in private higher education. 
But, Ms. Schessberger recalled, the University of Chicago Press was dormant for 10 years in 1870. Then, it discovered Dewey and new life. 
There may be an idea lurking around O'O'Shaughnessy or Galvin Life which when matured may gross more for the Press than the whole University budget. Until then, the Press will wait until "the end of autumn draws to a close" for its verdict.
