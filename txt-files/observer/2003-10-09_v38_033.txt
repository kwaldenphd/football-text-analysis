Vice President Dick Cheney is scheduled to speak at the Joyce Center today as the keynote speaker in a non-Notre Dame­sponsored fundraising event for Indiana Congressman Chris Chocola. 
The $250 per-plate fundraiser will be preceded by a $2,000 meet-and-greet session with Cheney. The combination of these events could potentially raise over $250,000 for Chocola's re-election campaign. 
The official purpose of Cheney's visit is unrelated to the University of Notre Dame. University officials said they are renting out the Joyce Center to Chocola's campaign as a busi­ness decision and are in no way endorsing Chocola as a political candidate. 
Various groups on cam pus oppose the polices of Cheney and Chocola, both Republicans. The Notre Dame Peace Coalition is sponsoring a protest today in alliance with other campus and community organizations, including the Notre Dame Progressive Alliance, the Notre Dame College Democrats, Notre Dame Amnesty International. 
Women's Action for New Directions, Notre Dame Faculty and Staff Progressive Alliance, and Michiana Peace and Justice Coalition, peace groups from IUSB and Bethel College. 
"We are using the protest as a forum to express our dissent. We arc protesting what Dick Cheney represents, including his ideology of pre-emptive war. We are also upset with his decision to support Congressman Chris Chocola, whose policies we dis­agree with," said Liz Fallon, co­founder of the Notre Dame Peace Coalition. Protesters will meet at 10 a.m. at the Clarke Memorial Fountain, and the protest will take place at the Joyce Center from 10:30 a.m. to 
1:00 p.m. 
Thirty members of the Notre Dame College Republicans, however, will be volunteering at the event, according to Brandi Gill. vice president of the College Republicans. These stu­dents will help with check-in and escort people to their seats. 
"I think it's great that Cheney cares enough about Chocola to come and speak at his fundrais­er again," Gill said.

INSIDE COLUMN 

For the love of the game 
As the 2003 major-league season draws to a close, I find that people are wearing their hearts on their sleeves -literally. In the last week I've noticed an increase in the Cubs jerseys worn around campus Katherine Gales and the Red Sox hats on people's 
heads. For every Wire Editor 
person wearing 

a Yankees cap sideways. I've seen a "Yankees Suck" trucker hat, 
-T-shirt or sticker in someone's dorm room. I've personally been a disappoint­ed baseball fan this year. The Phillies, despite the acquisition of Jim Thome, lost a tough Wild Card race and also lost me a bet. I also grew up watching the Twins, thanks to my dad, an Iowa native -and yes, we've been to Dyersville, where "Field of Dreams" was filmed. Unfortunately, their fleeting moment of victory over the Yankees ended in bitter defeat. The sweet part of this, however, means I can sit back comfortably, albeit bitterly, and watch the post­season unfold. The Cubs fans are my personal favorites; they believe in their team in a way that I find endearing. Our interhall football coaches bring a portable radio when the Cubs are playing, and can barely contain their excitement between . Cavanaugh football and Cubbies baseball. Red Sox supporters are a close second -anyone from Boston who can butcher "Nomar Garciaparra" in the name of love deserves recog­nition, and the fact that every year can be a championship year­despite Babe Ruth's famous curse -leaves me admiring their opti­mism. And memo to all Yankees fans: it doesn't take talent to buy talent. But I think the real baseball game is never televised. Sure, it's cracker jack and $100 million pay­rolls, but it's also the kid on his or her field of dreams. Baseball gives every kid a chance to be a hero-Hollywood has capi­talized on this with countless movies. It's my dad in the backyard hit­ting countless balls to us in games, and the Little Leaguers who look like bobble-head dolls in their bat­ting helmets. Baseball is a game for all ages ­when fourteen to fifty-year olds can play pick up games on a summer afternoon in dying sunlight, with all talent levels and good-natured fun for everyone. As much as I enjoy watching the big leagues, to me, the beauty of baseball is in the people who play for love, not money.

Cerneka discusses Brazilian prisons 
Slop Art hits Moreau Galleries
By ANNIE BASINSKI 
News Writer 

Heidi Cerneka, a Maryknoll lay volunteer, spoke yesterday about her experiences of working with women living under inhuman conditions in Brazilian prisons. 
The brown bag lunch discus­sion, titled, "A Life on the Margins: Faith and Solidarity with Brazil's Poor," was attended by approximately 30 students and faculty members and took place in Haggar Parlor Wednesday as part of Poverty and Hunger Awareness Week. 
Cerneka, a 1987 graduate of Saint Mary's, has worked in Brazil w i t h

One of Cerneka's goals as a mis­sionary worker is to "bring that question of women in prison to the forefront. so that the more people that know, the more we 
have  a  chance  of  changing  
things," she said.  
Cerneka,  who  speaks  

Portuguese, Spanish and English, works and talks with female pris­oners who are not provided with adequate health care, who are tortured in prison, are living in overcrowded jails and are forced to wait years for their trials because of Brazil's slow judicial system.

Instead of imprisonment, 
Cerneka proposes treatment and 
alternative sentencing, but she 
admits that there is no clear solu­
tion to the problem of ending 
crime. 

Cerneka said people often 
asked her the question, "Why do 
you bother?" in regard to her 
efforts to fight poverty and other 
problems that seem to have no 
solutions. 

Her answer, she said, is that, 
"[Problems of injustice are) not 
about to stop, so we're not going 
to give up." 

Cerneka concluded her talk with a message of hope by read­ing an excerpt from a speech written by Czechoslovakian politi­cal hero Vaclav Havel: "Hope is not the same as joy that things are going well. or willingness to invest in enterprises that are obvi­ously headed for early success, but rather, an ability to work for something that is good, not just because it stands a chance to suc­ceed." 
Kristen Carrigan, Saint Mary's senior and member of Peacemakers, a club that aims to educate the College community about social injustices, described Cerneka's discussion as an inspi­ration to all those seeking social justice. 
Carrigan said that "even when an issue [about social injustice] is so overwhelming, when you step back and focus on the people involved -that's where you fmd hope-because they don't give up, so you can't either."

"Slop Art," the latest exhibi­tion to hit Moreau Art Galleries. has received an enthusiastic reaction from the Saint Mary's community, possibly because of its unconventional artistic qual­ity.

above a bright yellow price tag with the consumer-grabbing phrase, "Perfect for Pro­American Art Lovers!" A Slop Art brand quilt boasts its price of $4,999.99, prominently sewed on the front. 
"They are trying to make the art world more accessible to the average Joe," said Moreau Galleries Director Krista Hoefle. "These young artists are more concerned with start­ing conversation and raising questions, not exactly giving answers." 
And they have raised ques­tions. Wary passers-by have been caught off-guard by the context of the gallery setting combined with their role as 
customers. 

Contrary to popular skepti­cism. Slop Art really is for sale. Curators/artists Adriene Herman and Brian Reeves appeared for the opening as salespeople -complete with price scanners -urging their potential customers to take home a vile of museum dust or a "George Dub-Ya" coaster. They were also available to provide information on the common misgivings of contem­porary art.

Body Vice President be given voting membership on the com­mittee and fmally that the power to amend the Student Union Constitution. 
Hallahan said that the reason­ing behind these changes came from the concerns expressed regarding the current inefficien­cies of Student Government. 
"A lot of the concerns we heard were that Student Government is inefficient in many ways . . . there is certainly room for improvement," Hallahan said. 

He said that tentative long­term plans to improve efficiency .include converting the Executive Cabinet into a new committee entitled the Council of Representatives, which would seat members from each com­mittee in Student Government. 
Student Government would then be grouped into four divi­sions: policy, which would include the Office of the President and the Student Senate; programming, which would include the Student Union Board, the Club Coordination Council and the Hall Presidents' Council; the Financial Management Board; and finally, the Judicial Council. The Financial Management Board divisions to ensure their impar­tiality. 

"The idea for this is to fmd a way to collaborate better and be more efficient," Hallahan said. "What we want to do is work out a situation in which all poli­cy groups come together and work more efficiently, and all the programming groups come together and work more effi­ciently." 
Currently, the Executive Cabinet represents all upper­level student government com­mittees, except for the Senate. 
"We need to fmd a group that brings all student groups togeth­er," Hallahan said. "We've gone too long on separate paths." 
Hallahan asked the Senate to pass the resolution Wednesday so he could report their progress on the issue to the Board of Trustees in his report to them next Thursday. His report will center on the administration's interaction, particularly the Campus Life Council, with the Student Government and the student body. 
Hallahan said he believes that if he can show the board that Student Government is making strides to become more efficient, then the board will be more inclined to make strides to improve. communication with Student Government. 
But senators felt this issue was were concerned that the Senate would give up too much power by passing all three sections of this resolution. They decided, therefore, to table the discussion until their next official meeting. 
Hallahan protested their deci­sion, saying that these changes are not about the power of one group relative to another. 
"This isn't about a single per­son, a single commission or a single group," he said. "This is about the Student Union as a whole." 
In order to reach a conclusion on this resolution before Hallahan's Board of Trustees report. senators decided to hold an additional official meeting on Sunday. They will then continue debate on the content of the res­olution before voting on it. 
Suggestions regarding content of the resolution included removing the clause that the Executive Cabinet be given the authority to approve the budget in order to debate that as a sep­arate issue. Also suggested was changing the second clause to state that four senators be appointed to the Executive Cabinet, ensuring equal repre­sentation of male and female dorms.

multi-step process that began in the spring of 2001 when the five-year Lilly grant came to term. The end of the grant led to the establishment of a gov­erning board that consists of members from 15 universities across the country. 
In addition to providing the finances required to cover the costs of operating the journal, the universities are also dedi­cated to promoting advances in Catholic education. Twice a year, representatives of the board meet to discuss the over­all policies and direction of the journal to ensure that each uni­versity has the ability to con­tribute its ideas for the journal. 
After a six-year tenure at the University of Dayton, the gov­erning board chose to move the journal's facilities to Notre Dame in part because this University was willing to make the additional financial contri­bution to house the editorial offices. Furthermore, Notre Dame's Institute for Educational Initiatives has developed inno­vative approaches to Catholic education that are unique to this University alone. 
The most innovative programs for education at Notre Dame are made possible through the Alliance for Catholic Education (ACE), a two-year service pro­gram that offers college gradu­ates the opportunity to teach in under-funded Catholic schools in the United States. Catholic Education is also supported by the ACE Leadership Program. ACE Consulting, the Center for Research on Educational Opportunity and the Mendelson Center for Sport, Character and Culture. The editorial offices of the journal are housed within ACE. and the journal is co-edit­ed by Rev. Ronald Nuzzi, the director of the ACE Leadership Program. 
Each issue of Catholic Education, which has over 500 individual and institutional sub­scriptions in the United States and over 60 subscriptions inter­nationally, contains several arti­cles. a section that focuses on one particular aspect of Catholic education, several reviews of research that is currently being conducted and book reviews. Information in the journal is not confined to post-secondary insti­tutions but also covers educa­tional programs from kinder­garten through the grade 12. 
The next edition of the jour­nal. to be published in December, will include two arti­cles on Catholic schools in Australia, a focus section devot­ed to the experiences of Latino students at Notre Dame, and two articles detailing the differ­ences between private and pub­lic schools. 
Julie Wernick, the managing editor of the journal and a grad­uate of the ACE program, said that one of the aspects of Catholic Education that distin­guishes it from other Catholic magazines is the fact that it is entirely academic, and that each article is written by a pro­fessional in the field of educa­tion. 
"It is the only refereed schol­arly research journal on Catholic education," Wernick s~d. . 
Currently, Catholic Education will continue to be sponsored by Notre Dame for the next five years. At that time, there will be an opportunity for one of the other 15 universities to host it and support its purposes of fur­thering a new vision of Catholic education.

Rival Afghan factions battle 
KABUL, Afghanistan-Fighting erupted Wednesday between rival warlords who both claim allegiance to the government of President Hamid Karzai, and an official of one of the warring groups said as many as 60 people were killed and scores more wounded. 
A commander for the other side, however, said only three people had been killed in a battle outside the northern city of Mazar-e­Sharif. It was impossible to verify either account. 
The fighting came as a deal was signed in the capital of Kabul between the Afghan gov­ernment and the United Nations that paves the way for teams of U.N. and Afghan per­sonnel to deploy to cities across Afghanistan to start a much-delayed program to disarm militiamen loyal to warlords. 
U.S.-Vietnam air travel to resume 
HANOI, Vietnam-Vietnam and the United States tentatively agreed on Wednesday to allow the first commercial flights between the two countries since the end of the Vietnam War, an official said .. 
The two sides were still working out the final details, but were expected to initial an agreement Thursday, according to an official from Vietnam's Civil Aviation Administration who participated in the talks. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Vietnam's relations with the United States have broadened since a bilateral trade agreement went into effect in December 2001. The pact has significantly increased two-way trade between the former foes, but negotiators have been unable to reach an agreement on air travel.

Cheap brush may help shuttle 
WASHINGTON -A simple foam paint brush that costs only pennies at hardware stores could be an essential tool in returning the space shuttle to orbit, NASA's administra­tor said Wednesday. 
Space agency engineers found that the brush may be just what astronauts need to spread a patching compound on a space shuttle's damaged heat shield while the craft is in orbit. 
"This thing turns out to be one of the most valuable tools we could have invented," said Sean O'Keefe, head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. "We're going to buy it at Wal-Mart." 
Heart stents recalled after failure 
INDIANAPOLIS -Guidant Corp. has begun a voluntary partial recall of a stent that just won federal approval less than three months ago, the company said Wednesday. 
The Indianapolis-based medical device maker said it was recalling certain lots of its 3mm-diameter Multi-Link Vision stent because some of the devices failed in quality tests. A stent is a metal-mesh tube inserted into a coronary artery to prop it open after a blockage has been cleared. · 
Patients who already have received the stents are not affected by the recall, but doc­tors have been notified, the company said.

Bayer sells plant to charity for $1 
ELKHART -A massive building formerly used to make tablets to relieve indigestion will now be used to store food to feed the poor. 
Feed the Children, a not-for-profit Christian charity based in Oklahoma City, announced Wednesday it has bought Bayer Corp.'s vacant 933,000-square-foot factory. The $1 cost of the building is less than the cost of a package of Alka-Seltzer, which was once made in the building. 
Bayer sold the building for $1 because it would have cost an estimated $20 million to demolish. 



Arnold begins transition moves 
Governor elect plans tax cuts, budget audits to reduce state's $8 billion deficit 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES-On his 
first full day as governor 
elect, Arnold 
Schwarzenegger expressed 
confidence that he would 
make a seamless transition 
to the governor's office, but 
provided no new specifics 
on how he plans to cure 
California's ills. 
In a news conference at a 
Los Angeles hotel, 
Schwarzenegger repeated 
many themes from the 
campaign trail, including a 
pledge to repeal the recent 
tripling of the car tax and a 
call to "open up the books" 
in search of a solution to 
the state's gaping deficit. 
He also promised again not 
to raise taxes. 
"What we have to do is, open up the books ... do the audit and find what the waste is," the action hero­turned-politician said. 
Schwarzenegger said he was promised "a very smooth transition" by oust­ed Gov. Gray Davis, and he received similar assur­ances from other state leaders. He will be sworn into the office by mid­November, becoming California's 38th governor. 
The Republican actor also expressed confidence that California lawmakers would see the message vot­ers delivered in Tuesday night's election and follow his leadership as he takes over the reins of the state. 
"The legislators up there have gotten this message last night, that the people of California want change," he said. 
Schwarzenegger said he had spoken with an array of leaders including Nelson Mandela of South Africa and President Bush, who he said promised to do "whatever is possible to help California." 
''I'm looking forward to working with him and ask­ing him for a lot, a lot of 

favors," Schwarzenegger 
said, adding that he hoped 
to meet with the president 
when he is in the state next 
week for fund-raisers. 
Schwarzenegger said he 

would make sure the feder­
al government helps 
California with such prob­
lems as energy and water. 
The "Terminator" star also vowed that Hollywood will not interfere with his job as governor. 
"I will work as much as I 

can, even if it is around the 
clock," he said. "There will 
be no time for movies or 
anything else. I will pay full 
attention to this job." 
Schwarzenegger's transi­tion team is being headed by Rep. David Dreier, R­Calif., who was to give more details about the team Thursday. 
Schwarzenegger's pro­posals will have to go through a Legislature con­trolled by Democrats angry over what some of them consider a hostile takeover of the state's top political job. And he will have to quickly deliver a budget that can close the giant deficit. 
It is an unusually fast transition, particularly for a political neophyte who declared his candidacy just two months ago. . "The last 60 days has been pretty difficult as well, but I would say there's probably never been a governor elect who's stepped into a situa­tion with the challenges he'II be confronting here in California. But that's why he wanted the job," spokesman Rob Stutzman said. 
Schwarzenegger takes office as the Republican Party's lone statewide officeholder in a state where the congressional delegation and both houses of the Legislature are heav­ily Democratic. 
And while the voters 
gave Schwarzenegger a resounding victory, they lean Democratic, too -44 percent to 35 percent Republican. 
"I think he's in for a rude awakening to the fact that he won't be able to get done all the things he has said because politics just doesn't work that way," said Fresno resident Don Lesher, 71, a registered Democrat who voted yes on the recall and for Republican Tom McClintock. "Unfortunately, everybody is voting along party lines, rather than what's best for the state." 
Still, more voters sup-

ported Schwarzenegger, 
3.6 million, than ·voted against recalling Davis, 3.5 million -an outcome Schwarzenegger aides touted as a mandate after weeks of predictions from Democrats that the winner might triumph with a small percentage of the vote. 
"The fact that he got more votes than Gray Davis puts him in a position of strength," said Allan Hoffenblum, a GOP con­sultant. "There's going to be some Democrats up there who are going to want to play ball reason­ably with Arnold Schwarzenegger." 
IRAQ 

2,000 Shiites stage protest march 
Associated Press 

BAGHDAD -About 2,000 Shiite Muslims marched to the headquar­ters of the U.S.-run coalition Wednesday, demanding the release of a detained cleric and vowing daily protests until he is freed. 
Moayed al-Khazraji was arrested Monday as he led a 12-man delega­tion to negotiate with the Americans in the municipal council building. A large crowd of his supporters con­fronted American troops late Tuesday outside his mosque, but the confrontation ended peacefully after 
U.S. 
troops withdrew. 


U.S. 
officials held talks with a group of clerics at the mosque Wednesday but failed to resolve the standoff. Following the talks, pro­


testers began marching toward the c~nter of the city, chanting Islamic slogans, as U.S. helicopters hovered overhead. 
Brig. Gen. Martin Dempsey, com­mander of the 1st Armored Division, said al-Khazraji was being held "on charges of criminal and anti-coali­tion activities" but would not elabo­rate. Shiites at the mosque said he had been wrongly accused of keep­ing weapons in the mosque. 
By early afternoon, the marchers converged on the heavily guarded presidential palace that serves as coalition headquarters. A senior offi­cial came out and talked with a dele­gation of clerics but told them to raise the issue of the arrest with Iraqi police. 
That failed to satisfy the clerics or their followers, who .insisted the Americans were holding al-Khazraji and it was up to them to set him free. At one point, some protesters lay in the street, blocking two U.S. armored personnel carriers. 
After hours of fruitless negotia­tions, the crowd began to disperse in late afternoon, hurling stones and sandals -a sign of contempt -at 
U.S. troops guarding the compound. 
Al-Khazraji is said to be close to Muqtada al-Sadr, a young radical Shiite cleric who is strongly critical of the U.S. military occupation. However, al-Sadr's influence within Iraq's Shiite majority is believed to be less than that of older clerics who have spoken out against violence and have been generally more coop­erative with American authorities.

Brit, Yank share economics Nobel 
NEW YORK -American Robert Engle and Briton Clive W.J. Granger won the 2003 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for developing statistical tools that have improved the forecasting of rates of economic growth, interest rates and stock prices. 
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said Wednesday in announcing the award that the academics devised new methods for meas­uring volatility, or the rate at which prices, interest and other economic variables move up and down. 
Engle and Granger, who were colleagues for decades at the University of California at San Diego, will share the prize worth 10 million kronor ($1.3 million). 
Napster to return, charge fees 
LOS ANGELES -The Napster name, once synonymous with the digital song-swapping bazaar that enraged the recording industry, revives Thursday as an Internet music store that will go head to head with such competi­tors as Apple's iTunes and MusicMatch. 
Santa Clara-based Roxio Inc., which bought the rights to the Napster name for about $5 million, has shelved its former online music service, pressplay, and plans to move sub­scribers to a beta, or working version, of Napster 2.0 beginning Thursday. 
Napster 2.0 will be available to the general public within a month, according to sources familiar with the plans. 
Simon drops bid for rival 
DETROIT-Simon Property Group Inc. on Wednesday withdrew its hostile $1.7 billion takeover bid for rival shopping mall developer Taubman Centers Inc. 
The announcement by Indianapolis-based Simon and its partner Westfield America Inc. came a day after Gov. Jennifer Granholm signed legislation aimed at helping Bloomfield Hills, Mich. -based Taubman fend off the takeover effort. 
The bill changes Michigan's takeover law to say that shareholders acting together do not violate the law, but it would be against the law for a group to act together with the purpose of acquiring additional shares. 
GE, Vivendi sign merger deal 
NBC Universal will become $43 billion media titan with television, film assets

FBI planted bugs in office of PA mayor 
Associated Press PHILADELPHIA -Federal law enforcement officials on Wednesday confirmed that lis­tening devices found in the offices of Mayor John Street were planted by the FBI -a discovery that touched off a political furor just weeks before Election Day. Three federal law enforce­ment officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, acknowledged that the FBI 
was responsible for the bugs but refused to comment on whether the Democratic mayor is a target of an investi­gation or to provide any details about the nature of the probe. 
Street issued a statement late Wednesday saying that one of his advisers had been told by the U.S. Attorney's office that the mayor was not the target of an investigation. 
"I never believed that I was the target of any investiga­tion," Street said. ''I'm happy to confirm that tonight." 
The devices were found Tuesday during a routine sweep of Street's office by police. Street is locked in a bitter rematch against Republican busin-essman Sam Katz, and the campaign has been marked by charges of threats and race-baiting. Election Day is Nov. 4. 
FBI spokeswoman Linda Vizi declined to comment on the devices, other than to say they were not connected to cam­paign espionage. 
The U.S. Attorney's office in Philadelphia also did not acknowledge responsibility for the bugs but said it had been in touch with Street. "We have stated very clearly to both Mayor Street and his attorney the mayor's status in this mat­ter," spokesman Richard Manieri said Wednesday night. 
He would not elaborate on what federal prosecutors told Street. 
Throughout the day Wednesday, Street said he did not believe he was under investigation. 
"I haven't done anything wrong, and I don't know that anybody in my cabinet or in my staff around me has done anything wrong," he said. 
Street's campaign suggested the bugging was instigated by the U.S. Justice Department for political reasons. 
"The timing of the discovery of these listening devices seems incredibly strange, see­ing that we are four weeks out of the election, and we have a Democratic mayor ahead in the polls, and we are on the eve of the first mayoral debate," Street campaign spokesman Frank Keel said. 
"Do we believe that the Republican Party, both at the federal level and state level, is pulling out every stop to get Pennsylvania in 2004? Absolutely," Keel said. "Is the Republican Party capable of dirty tricks? I think that is well-documented." 
U.S. Attorney Patrick Meehan, the top federal prose­cutor in Philadelphia, declined to say what federal agents might know about the bugs but denied politics plays any role in his office's decisions. 
"The U.S. Attorney's office in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania has a long and proud history of doing its work without regard to partisan politics. That was the practice of my predecessors, and it is my practice as well," Meehan said in a statement. 
Philadelphia Police Commissioner Sylvester Johnson said he turned the matter over to the FBI. He said the security sweeps of the mayor's office have been going on for decades.

Downey begins '03 lecture series 
By DUSTIN VONHANDORF News Writer 
Greg Downey, assistant pro­fessor in the Department of Anthropology, presented "The Pleasure of Dissent: Selfish Reasons for Activism," the first in the "Last Lecture Series" in the basement of Lewis Hall Wednesday night. 
The lecture blended personal examination with intellectual reflection and concentrated on his personal opinions on dis­sent. 
After talking of dissent, he touched briefly upon religion, and the role of faith in dissent. 
"Faith," Downey said, "is not certainty." He said that it takes faith to start anything. 
The series asks faculty to present a lecture as if it were their last. 
The Academic Division of the Office of the Student Body President and the dorm that hosts that lecture cohost the series, in its fourth year. The series is presented so that "students can meet popular professors outside the class­room," series coordinator Mary Mullen said. 
Professors are chosen by the hall presidents, and the list of nominations come from a ran­dom survey of students. 
Other lecturers in the series are Jill Godmillow, Joseph Buttigieg, _Peter Walshe, Matthew Bloom and Charles Rosenburg. Each will lecture on a topic of personal interest. 
"Hopefully, by sharing my self-motivations, it might help students to become more involved in political and socie­tal action," Downey said.

an attraction to someone when being in their presence stirs the heart and hormones in a direction which contradicts everything wlve been taught about being good Christians? And what about peer pressure? How do our friends inform our choices when, in an intimate moment~ deciding how far is too far is the relationship's defining moment? For some, sex is a valid and acceptable way to respond to these impulses and connect to another human being in a very intimate and private way. For others, being faced with being human is a part ofthe college experi­ence, and waiting until we learn more about love and its many dimensions is worth 
. waiting for. 
The thing about sex is that Jesus never talked much about it (except in Matthew when he refers to adultery). As far as we know, Jesus was single, religious, outspoken, and hung around a mixed bag ofkindred rev-olutionaries.

A soldier's experience in war 
We'll call him Joe. As a part of a force protection -security forces ­unit in the United States Marine Corps, he helped protect a camp that had a medical unit and provided sup­plies to opera­tions elsewhere Andrew in Iraq. This DeBerry was his war experience in 
ND Changing
Iraq. 

Times
Joe arrived in February 2003. The troops wanted to get the job done and return quickly. but for the present wanted to contribute to something they felt was worthwhile. 
They endured the field conditions and could go weeks without shower­ing, living off of three Meals Ready to Eat (MREs) daily. For their work, the government gave them an extra 700 dollars per month. 
On the first day of war, the troops didn't know what to expect and kept gas masks on hand. The Navy doc­tors had shots that could keep chem­icals from spreading through the body. 
While his unit was still crossing the border, the Iraqi military shot four SCUD missiles at them. People ran everywhere, jumping into their trenches and thinking that they were going to die. 
"It was pandemonium," Joe said. 
A lot of non-religious people sud­denly got religious in different ways: They prayed to Allah, cast Wiccan spells and cried to Jesus: "We had to hit all of them." 
The Army was prepared a few miles away and sent Patriot missiles that destroyed the SCUDs overhead. 
Unity across the services kept the soldiers alive. "All you have is each other. You never know who you're going to die for. Everybody was one." 
Enemy Prisoners of War were kept at Joe's camp and the wounded Iraqis were treated. Some soldiers thought it would have been better to kill them to conserve their limited medical supplies. But the Navy doc­tors kept them in line, reminding them that they were there to help. 
Other Marines recognized that some of the soldiers were forced to fight. They didn't want anyone to die and hoped that they would surren­der. 
Some Iraqi soldiers even rebelled. Joe heard of one group who rounded up their officers and shot them before running off. 
Chaplains provided moral support to the troops. Some soldiers felt guilty about how badly they were defeating the Iraqi soldiers. Some were relieved when the chaplain 
· clarified the commandment as for­bidding murder and not killing. although Joe thought it was hard to explain the difference. 
He was with a group that entered a town that the Unit~d States military had won control over, and the.lraqis welcomed them on the streets with celebrations. He thinks that Iraq is better off: "The majority of the Iraqis are glad we're there." 
But he also thought the war was all about oil. When asked if he thought God would approve of what was done in Iraq, Joe deliberated and said, "You know, I don't know." But no matter what their thoughts, soldiers were more focused on just staying alive. 
When Joe's time in Iraq was done, he spent some time in Kuwait City and felt a little closer to home with its American fast food chains and cars. After 65 days in Iraq, he returned to the United States. 
Joe's group came home after the first wave of soldiers had returned. There were no parades, cheering crowds, or bands to welcome them. He had four days to adjust and then went back to his old job. 
The hardest part of Joe's home­coming has been the people who have no real idea about war and make no effort to understand. He appreciates those who ask him about his experiences and how he is doing. He's glad for those he's met who have supported the troops even if they didn't support the war. 
Joe doesn't watch the news. "I did­n't want to hear about stuff anymore. War changes you. War changes you forever." But his intent remains fixed: "I would go again for what they're trying to do-freedom." 
And so are the ironies of war. Soldiers try to get away from the experience but wouldn't hesitate if called upon to do it again. Once there, they may feel guilty about their actions but are too focused on survival to think about it. Prussian military philosopher, Carl von Clausewitz. rightly said, "War has its own grammar, but not its own logic." It's a part of a process where some are torn down and others are built up. For the soldier, it leaves him or her changed forever. 
No matter what your views are about the war, remember those who have given themselves in unparal­leled devotion toward causes they have pursued with hopeful hearts. If there's someone you know who went to Iraq, ask about his or her experi­ence, listen to his or story through­out, and return some of the devotion that soldiers have showed in their hope for freedom.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 


Discussing abortion protest 
Last week was National Respect life week and to make a statement regard­ing abortion, a Pro-Life group displayed a number of crosses near the Law School. This display did not represent the opinions of many students on cam­pus -both Catholic and non-Catholic -who favor legalized abortion and, under the Constitution and the natural law, these students have a right to their opinion. The student who deliberately trampled the crosses, however, indicat­ed either one of two things to the Pro-Life group: That the opinion they were expressing was intolerable and they had no right to it; or, deeming that the stu­dents had at least the right to their opinion, they still had no right to express it. 
The first possibility is a simple issue oftolerance. The Cross is a universal symbol used to represent Christianity and also to mark tombstones. The Pro­Life group used the Cross to convey their faith and their belief that abortion kills unborn people. It was a clear yet non-graphic and peaceful demonstra­tion. On the other hand, the vandal did not peacefully or thoughtfully promote his views. His actions only said that he did not like and in fact would not toler­ate the opinions of the Pro-Lifers. 
The second possibility is that the student did not want the group to express their beliefs on campus. Abortion is a controversial and emotional issue. It would have been inappropriate and insensitive to put the crosses in the yard of a woman known to have had an abortion. Notre Dame, however, is the most widely recognized Catholic university in the country. Being that the Catholic Church has a clear anti-abortion stance, it would seem that the students chose a logical and "safe" environment to make their display. Would anyone think it acceptable to vandalize expressions of Muslim thought at a Muslim school? Of course not, and, likewise, it seems equally inappropriate for a student to destroy expressions of Catholic thought on campus.

Death penalty produces injustice 
Last Friday, 39-year-old Eddie Hartman was killed in North Carolina. 
What made his death distinctive is that the state sponsored it. His 
constitutionally guaranteed "fair" trial was far from perfect. He was 
sexually abused as a child, which is usually a mitigating factor. 
However, the prosecution used Hartman's homosexuality to suggest 
that he may have enjoyed the acts. His court-appointed lawyer failed 
to challenge these claims and has since been disbarred. The state did 
not reconsider Hartman's sentence. 
His case demonstrates just one of the many problems in the current capital punishment system. 
The death penalty relies on people and is therefore inherently flawed. One hundred seven inmates have been released from death row after DNA testing and revoked testimonies. David Spence was put to death in 1997 after prison inmates received favors to testify against him. A detective who worked the crime said, "Nothing from the inves­tigation ever led us to any evidence that he was involved." 
When invoking an irreversible punishment, there is no margin for error. 
The death penalty is also prone to discrimination against the poor and United States minorities. Ninety-five percent of all people sen­tenced to die in the United States could not afford their own attor­neys. Eighty percent of those executed since 1976 were convicted of murdering white victims, while minorities represent more than half of all homicide victims. The justice system cannot be considered "just" if race and economic resources are factors in the punishment. 
Fifty seven people have been executed this year, and more are scheduled to die. The death penalty needs to be abolished to prevent more question­able executions from occurring. 
On Sunday night at 6 p.m. in 102 DeBartolo, Professor Garth Meintjes will be speaking on the Death Penalty in the United States. A screening of "The Farm: Angola, USA" will follow his lecture at 6:45 
p.m. The 90-minute film follows six inmates through the largest maxi­mum-security prison in the United States. It won the Grand Jury Award at Sundance in 1998 and was nominated for Best Documentary that year at the Academy Awards. At 8:15 p.m. Professor Greg Downey will moderate an informal discussion on the prison system. 
Amnesty International invites all who are interested in these issues to attend any or all of these events to commemorate the National Weekend of Faith in Action on the Death Penalty. All events are free and open to the public. Refreshments will be provided.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 


Debating church and state separation 
Abigail Wheetley's Oct. 6 U-Wire col­umn defended the Alabama Ten Commandments ruling which invoked the principle of separation of church and state. She made the comment that this principle of separation is being under­mined by laws restricting abortions. In this subtle line, however, Wheetley underscored the fallacious claim that restricting abortions is somehow a reli­gious imposition which should therefore be separated from the legal matters of the state. 
The problem is, as detestable as abortion is from a moral or religious standpoint, it is also abhorrent in the eyes of the state. Restricting abortions holds pragmatic purposes. The common argu­ment is that no state has the right to impose any authority over a woman's "right" to choose whether or not to abort her child. 

Using this same line of reasoning, the state is out of line when it prohibits murder. Who is the state to say that we can't kill our fellow citizens? After all, we have a "right" to do whatever we want. The point is, as much as we like to isolate our actions from the world, we can't. The absurd notion of permitting murder fails to acknowledge that we can't act freely to the extent that we harm others. 
From a purely legal standpoint. heroin is illegal not because it is immoral. but because its use creates myriad problems. from psychological problems to violence to death. And society pays the price. Its tax dollars go to work to aid addicts in rehabilitation. It pays the medical bills. In the instance of murder, society pays

for the murderer's court cases. Try as we might, we can't separate these "individ­ual" actions from their subsequent con­sequences. The job of the government, therefore, is to protect the welfare of all its citizens. Call it a religious principle, call it a law, call it whatever you wish: our laws should protect us and see the human dignity inherent in every person. 
With this in mind, it is a wonder that abortion has flourished so much in this country. You have a living, breathing fetus with its own heartbeat and a body completely distinct from its mother's, with its own distinct DNA and 
traits, its own brain and its own organs, and our govern­
ment gives the green light for us to terminate it. Whenever we want, 
by the way. Not just in the beginning phases, but up to the ninth month, when the child is fully grown 
-if a nine-month old child isn't a life, what is? How can we fail to see the 
monstrosity in puncturing the skull of a partially delivered child? Because it's "our" body and ·"our" deci­sion. No, it isn't our body. It's the distinct body of the being we brought into life. And the government has just as much a need of protecting that defenseless fetus as it does every other human being. Abortion, plain and simple, is taking the life and dignity away from a child. from a son, from a daughter and from a citi­zen.

Assistant Scene Editor 
Before "School Daze" and "Fives," before "Fourth and Inches" and "Happy Town," there was another zany and toony way of looking at the world of Notre Dame. It was seen through the eyes of four friends named Nate, Dez. Sheldon and Carrie. These four Notre Dame students were the brainchild of Dave Kellet, a '96 Notre Dame graduate, and the main characters the comic strip "Four Food Groups of the Apocalypse." 
The name of the strip was the result of a humor-filled brainstorming session between Kellet and his roommates. He was a sophomore and had just submit­ted his first comic for print, but it still didn't have a name. Finally, the head editor called him at midnight before the paper went to press and said that they needed a title. Kellet is sure that they had gone through at least a hundred names that night trying to come -up with something. Why "Four Food Groups?" Besides being a play on the Notre Dame legendary status of the Four Horseman, Kellet admits "everything seems funnier at 1:30 a.m. And the name haunted me for the next three years. I thought it sounded like the ingredients for a dietary supplement." 
Though sketching characters and comic strips had been a hobby of his since the third grade, prior to college Kellet had never done anything more than one or two cartoons for his high school paper. When he was a freshman in college he drew a few "Far Side"-

esque comics for Scholastic, but his big break came as a sophomore when he submitted a sample strip to The Observer and they took him on as a daily cartoonist for the 1993-94 school year. 
Writer's block was something he always feared and had to deal with, but it was easily rectified by "watching [his] ... roommates. Ideas would flow freely." The comic strip was primarily character based, but it allowed him to comment on campus politics and world issues without getting into trouble. 
"Things visually in a cute little pack­age can get away from the harsh black­and-white of print," he said, which gave him a great deal of freedom to comment on everything from dining hall food to human cloning to the NRA. One of the biggest differences, he said now that he's away from campus, is the separa­tion from his audience. As a student, inspiration often came from "opening his eyes to the jokes all around him. [He] could tell when people in the dining were looking at "Four Food Groups." People had no problem letting [him] know if a story line stunk or if it was really good. And if it was really good, [he'd] go with it." One series of strips with Regis Philbin seemed to end and segue way into a Notre Dame squirrel joke, but Philbin showed up at the end to tie the two story lines together. As one character was quoted at the end of that strip: "Never-ending story lines: the hall­mark of quality cartooning." 
Kellet's ideas were broad reaching and usually very creative. "I think there was one time that I turned in a strip at mid-

night and the editor wanted something changed," he recalls. His larger-than-life characters were always fun to read about and easy to connect with. Originally the concept for "Four Food Groups" arose out of the idea of having two roommates, one a literature major and the other a chemical engineer, and capitalizing on the conflict between Arts and Letters majors and the sciences. Both captured the general buffoon nature of your average male Notre Dame student. He soon brought in Carrie, a marketing major. with the intent of having her play the voice of reason for Nate and Dez. Occasionally other characters would emerge, but they would typically not last more than one strip to repre­

sent a particular major or administrative role. It wasn't until his second year that Kellet introduced Sheldon, a 10-year­old genius that attended Notre Dame, majored in PLS, and whom Nate took under his wing. Sheldon, as young as he was and new to the University. was able to offer that outsider­looking-in approach to the comic, often commenting on the enjoyed. He did one better, after being crazy antics of Nate and Dez in a matu­laughed out of the offices of Notre Dame rity that far exceeded his age.

with his girlfriend, this time liv­ing in Los Angeles. Based on the success of "Sheldon" as of yet, he launched the "Sheldon" Web site where fans could con­tinue to see the strip. He began submitting "Sheldon" to several newspaper syndicates across the country with hopes that "Sheldon" might be published. This proved to be frustrating until he was contacted by a syn­dication company that had seen his Web site and decided that they wanted to look more into the idea of "Sheldon." Kellet is now what is known as the "syn­dication testing phase" in which his strip has been placed on a Web site with the intent of building an audience and monitoring the success of the strip online to get an idea of how it would do in a daily newspaper setting. Somewhere between 4,000 and 6,000 new comic strips are submitted each year to syndicates for perusal. Kellet

from "Four Food Groups" ­"Sheldon." Kellet took the basic concept behind Sheldon, but gave it a new spin by taking him away from Notre Dame and making him a 1 0-year-old child prodigy that wrote software to speed up the Internet and became the second richest per­son in the United States after Bill Gates. He put it online so that people back in the States could see it and he began to develop an audience. 
Kellet moved back to the U.S. 
Masters degree in 18th century car­toons, and he interned at the San Diego Daily Tribune where he was able to draw political cartoons once or twice a week. This was, he remembers, "really good for a kid just out of college" and he quickly learned important rules of the cartoon/newspaper world, such as "don't make fun of businesses owned by the publisher of the paper." He was also able to spend time with his high school sweetheart that he had continued to see throughout college despite being in dif­ferent cities. 
While in San Diego, Kellet was hon­ored with a Rotary scholarship to study in Canterbury, England, at the University of Canterbury's Center for Cartoon Holdings. He moved there with his girlfriend and began his studies. There he received his Masters in 19th century cartooning and continued to draw strips for fun and for local papers. 
It was while he was in England that he started building up a comic strip based around one of the original characters hopes to be one of the two or three lucky ones that actually becomes published. 
Sheldon character was based on the "old Disney equation" of giving charac­ters short limbs and big eyes to evoke a "ooh, ahh" response from readers. Though he began as a PLS major, he has evolved into a software geek, interested in Lord of the Rings and obscure history and literature trivia. 
Sheldon is not alone in his adventures. Much like "Four Food Groups," "Sheldon" is set-up with four main char­acters that interact with each other and share comic insights or get into funny situations together. Sheldon is raised by his grandfather, a befuddled old man who doesn't know how to program his VCR in stark contrast to Sheldon's tech­no-background. By having Sheldon raised by his grandfather rather than parents, Kellet feels it allows for Sheldon to have more freedom to grow as his own person without having a very specific base from which to sprout off of. Sheldon is also joined by Dante, Sheldon's best friend, who Kellet describes as being "a few chairs short of a dinette set," offering a comic foil to Sheldon's pre-teen genius. 
Arthur, Sheldon's sarcastic and wise­cracking talking pet duck, rounds ofT the group. Sheldon created Arthur when he downloaded the Encyclopedia Britannica and some voice-recognition software into his pet duck. Arthur gained the ability to talk and it quickly became evident that most of what Arthur had to· say was smart-alecky and facetious. 
One of the big difficulties of making a comic strip like this is not having the constant source of inspiration that he was able to bask in at Notre Dame. He cites his wife as his biggest source of inspiration, calling her the "most ... funny human being all around." As an actress and writer, she has helped him with ideas and remains his biggest fan. Kellet also reads a lot of books and sub­scribes to six or seven different maga­zines to stay up on pop culture and find inspiration. He also moonlights with an Los Angeles-based sketch-comedy group where he is constantly brainstorming up new skit ideas with some very funny comedians and writers. 

Where is Kellet now in comparison to where he thought he would be? "The Observer was great experience for the real world.... [Working there] showed me I could and I wanted to be a cartoon­ist.... [Things] still haven't happened as I hoped it would, but I keep plugging away with hopes that I can pull it off." He reminds students, especially those interested in an artistic career, that "the world does not go out of the way to open doors unless you have an amazing stick­to-it-ness.... Lots of times I thought about quitting. The rewards may not be what you thought. But they may be bet­ter." 
See "Sheldon" online now at Sheldoncomics. com. Dave Kellet resides in Los Angeles with his wife where he writes hilarious strips at his cartoon desk everyday for the world to enjoy.

NHL 


Bruins hold their own, tie Devils in season opener 
Associated Press 
BOSTON -The Bruins are fighting the Red Sox for atten­tion in Boston these days. In the NHL, though, they might be moving up in the pecking order. 
Jeff Jillson scored twice in his Bruins debut, the second to tie the game with 3:58 left in regu­lation on Wednesday night as Boston opened the season with a 3-3 tie against the Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils. 
"Every year, they're up there and battling for the Stanley Cup," said Bruins goalie Felix Potvin. who stopped 32 shots in his Boston debut. "I think we held our own against those guys." 
With many in the crowd fol­lowing the AL playoff game between the Yankees and Red Sox in New York, the Bruins ral­lied from a 2-0 deficit in the sec­ond period only to fall behind on Scott Nied ermayer's second goal. 
But Jillson tied it when he faked out a defenseman in front of the left circle and wristed a shot past goaltender Martin Brodeur. Joe Thornton also scored for the Bruins, who got new coach Mike Sullivan a point in his debut as an NHL head coach. 
Brian Rafalski had two assists, and Jeff Friesen also scored for the Devils. Brodeur stopped 28 shots for New Jersey, which beat Boston in the first round of the playoffs 4-1 on its way to the title. 
"It's been a long training camp," Brodeur said. "But we're all looking forward to the chal­lenge of defending the Cup." 
Niedermayer's second goal was the 1OOth of his career. The defenseman also cleared the puck off the goal line with just over two minutes left. 
The first period was scoreless, then New Jersey took a 2-0 lead on a pair of power-play goals. 
Blackhawks 1, Wild 0 
.Jocelyn Thibault and the Chicago Blackhawks' penalty killers beat the defensive-mind­ed Minnesota Wild at their own game. 
Thibault stopped 33 shots and helped his teammates snuff all seven Minnesota power plays to lead the Blackhawks to a 1-0 victory Wednesday night in the season opener for both teams. 
Chicago's tight play and Thibault's sharp work allowed an early second-period goal by Tyler Arnason to stand up. 
"Our penalty killers were good -they had to be," Chicago coach Brian Sutter said. "We played a good team tonight and had to earn it." 
Chicago had three power-play opportunities, two in the first period. One of those chances lasted only eight seconds. 
"We did a great job of penalty killing," he added. "For the most part they kept the shots to the outside and I was able to see them." 
Thibault had eight shutouts last season, second best in the NHL. He beat Buffalo 3-0 in the Blackhawks' home opener a year ago.

Redskins playing injury-ridden teams all season 
Associated Press 

ASHBURN. Va. -When the Washington Redskins play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday, it's the Buffalo Bills who should beware. 
That's because the Bills play the Redskins next week and
' ~ 
\ 
Washington's opponents this sea­son almost always turn up beset by key injuries. 
So the Bills might consider petitioning the NFL to wear full body armor for their game against the New York Jets. Quarterback Drew Bledsoe should hide a rabbit's foot in his uniform for luck. Owner Ralph Wilson should make sure his players' insurance is paid up. 
It's known as the curse of the Redskins. 
"I don't know what it is," line­backer LaVar Arrington said, "but we have been running into a lot of teams that have been injury-ridden." 
No kidding. Arrington used to complain that the Redskins never get any breaks, but that's hard to swallow these days. Just the ask the Jets, Falcons, Giants, Patriots, Eagles -and now the Buccaneers. 
"Hello. How's it going? Real quick, I'll update our injury sta­tus," were the first words out of Tampa Bay coach Jon Gruden's mouth during his conference call Wednesday with Washington reporters. 
Gruden then ran down a list of nine names, the aftermath of the Bucs' Monday night loss to Indianapolis. Fullback Mike Alstott is out for the season. Joe Jurevicius is out this week, and fellow receiver Keyshawn Johnson is "very questionable." Cornerback Brian Kelly probably won't play, while linebacker Shelton Quarles is a 50-50 call. Charles Lee had to be re-signed just to give the team a full com­plement of receivers. 
"Quite honestly, it's hard to produce a game plan not know­ing the status of so many players who have played key roles," Gruden said. "It'll be a great challenge to see if we can over-

Leslie and Staley to play for U.S. team 
Associated Press 

Lisa Leslie and Dawn Staley will team again for another shot at Olympic gold -maybe for the last time. 
The two WNBA veterans were among the first seven players selected Wednesday for the U.S. women's national basketball team that's expect­ed to compete at the Athens Games next year. 
Leslie, from the Los Angeles Sparks, and Staley, from the Charlotte Sting, helped the

Others named to the team were Tamika Catchings of the Indiana Fever, Shannon Johnson of the Connecticut Sun, DeLisha Milton-Jones of the Sparks. Katie Smith of the Minnesota Lynx and Tina Thompson of the Houston the Comets. Houston's Van Chancellor will coach the team. "I think we have seven tremendous players," Chancellor said. The biggest name missing is the Comets' Sheryl Swoopes, who played on the 1996 and 2000 Olympic teams and twice has been the WNBA's most valuable player. Swoopes could not make a \' j commitment to the team at

that Teresa Edwards played in five. 
Staley, 33, the women's bas­ketball coach at Temple, said this would be her last Olympics. 
"I've enjoyed the ride, defi­nitely," said Staley, a 5-foot-6 guard known for her leader­ship, passing and fiery play. 
"I also want them to know we don't just compete for gold medals, we win gold medals. I want to make sure it's left in good hands." 
Leslie said she was a junior in high school when she first met Staley. 
"She's the floor leader and general," Leslie said. "She can lead us to gold. Having Dawn there is one reason I keep playing USA Basketball. She can help us win."

"Everybody's got injuries," safety Matt Bowen said. "We've just been on the lucky side."

-Week 1: The Jets came to town without quarterback Chad Pennington, who broke his wrist in preseason. New York got just 158 total yards in the Redskins' 16-13 victory. 
-Week 2: Atlanta didn't have Michael Vick, out with a broken leg. The Falcons led 17-0 before the Redskins rallied for a 33-31 win. 
-Week 3: The Giants were the healthiest team the Redskins have played yet; their chief defi­ciency was merely that they had to start two rookies on the offen­sive line. Like Tampa Bay, New York was coming off a tough Monday loss, but they beat Washington 24-21 in overtime. 
-Week 4: The Patriots were missing nine opening-day starters, including three line­backers. Two offensive linemen made their first NFL starts, and quarterback Tom Brady had a sore elbow. Somehow New England lost by only three, 20­17. 
-Week 5: The Eagles didn't have the three Pro Bowl players in their secondary, yet coach Steve Spurrier's offense managed only 171 yards passing until the final two drives of the game. Philadelphia held on, 27-25. 
Conversely, while other teams have been taking roll call in the trainer's room, the Redskins have been relatively unscathed. Guard Dave Fiore's two-game rest for his sore knee is the clos­est thing to a serious injury so far this season. 
"We've had pretty healthy teams," Spurrier said. "We've been very fortunate." 
That about sums up why the Redskins are the most frustrated 3-2 team around.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL 
Georgia's Davis makes his name known on defense 
Associated Press 
ATHENS. Ga. -Everyone at Georgia has their favorite Thomas Davis hit. 
Fred Gibson likes the one where Davis lifted Clemson quar­terback Charlie Whitehurst into the air. then drove his body into the turf. The only thing missing was the chalk outline. 
"He stuck him right in the mid­dle of the chest," crowed Gibson, a Bulldogs receiver. "If I was a quarterback, I would not want to get hit in the middle of the chest by Thomas Davis." 
Running back Tyson Browning prefers the one where Davis was getting blocked but still managed to knock over Alabama quarter­back Spencer Pennington with a one-arm clothesline. Hulk Hogan would have been proud. 
"Thomas is the best athlete I've been around -ever," Browning said. "He's capable of running you down, or he can play straight smash-mouth football with you." 
Just five games into his sopho­more season at No. 8 Georgia. Davis has emerged as one of the country's most dominating play­ers -a fusion of safety and out­side linebacker who seems to be in on every big play for the Dawgs. 
Not bad, considering he wasn't even recruited by another Division I -A school. 
That little tidbit is still baffiing to Georgia defensive coordinator Brian VanGorder, who merely throws up his arms when some­one asks why the Bulldogs were the lone major school to offer a scholarship. 
VanGorder had only seen Davis 

NFL 

Jets fans look to place blam.e for bad start 

Marvin Jones said. 
"Accountability is the No. 1 issue. 
If you're not playing, don't give 
yourself a false sense that you 
are playing. It's a reality check." 
Accountability starts at the top, 
where Bradway makes many of 
the personnel decisions. Though 
he does have input from coaches 
and scouts, Bradway ultimately 
takes the brunt of the criticism. 
It all started when the 
Redskins came calling for Coles, 
guard Randy Thomas, special 
teams player Chad Morton and 
kicker John Hall. They offered 
Coles a seven-year, $35 million 
offer sheet that included a $13 
million signing bonus, which the 
Jets did not match. 
But if they had made Coles a 
slightly higher tender offer, the 
Jets could have received even 
more compensation, and the 
Redskins acknowledge they 
probably would have backed off . pursuing Coles. 
The Jets then packaged that 
No. 1 pick (13th overall) and 
their own pick at No. 22 for the 
No. 4 overall spot and took 
Dewayne Robertson, a junior 
from Kentucky. Robertson is 
starting and does not have a 
sack, though he is still learning 
how to play the position as a pro. 
"It's still too early to judge this 
group of players," Bradway said. 
"The time we took in making 
those decisions, the input that we 
had in making those decisions. l 
can't sit here and tell you that I 
wish we had done things differ­
ently, because that would be fool­
ish on my part. Decisions were 
made and you move on. 
"It's easy to sit here at 0-4 and 
question everything you do in 
your entire organization." 
In his last comments to the 
media last month, owner Woody 
Johnson defended Bradway. 
"I think that's a little bit unfair 
because it's the whole organiza­
tion," Johnson said. "It's not just 
Terry. It's the 80 people that 
work here." 
Bradway knows how to win. 
He was with the Giants when 
they won two Super Bowls and 
with the Chiefs he helped draft 
Tony Gonzalez, Donnie Edwards 
and Joe Horn. 
With the Jets in 2001, he cleared cap space by letting Aaron Glenn and Marcus Coleman go in the expansion draft, enabling Edwards to get the type of defensive backs he wanted. Bradway also signed Curtis Martin, Vinny Testaverde and Kevin Mawae to long-term deals for stability.

"After about 10 minutes, I was like, 'Geez, this guy can do some special things,"' VanGorder recalled. 
Davis leads the Bulldogs in tackles· (51), including five behind the line of scrimmage. He has three sacks and has pres­sured the quarterback five other times. Last week, he returned a blocked punt for a touchdown against Alabama -his personal favorite. 
Davis has become an especially lethal player in the hybrid posi­tion the Bulldogs created for him. He came to Georgia as a safety, but was supposed to start at out­side linebacker this season. When senior Kentrell Curry went

Associated Press 
HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. -Every week, Jets general manager Terry Bradway answers ques­tions from callers on an evening radio show. 
Last week, following a 17-6 loss to Dallas, Bradway fielded a query from one irate listener who shouted, "You should be fired!" 
Jets fans are trying to find someone to blame for an 0-4 start. 
Bradway seems the perfect target after an offseason in which the Redskins plucked four players -including top receiver Laveranues Coles -from the team. Bradway ::tlso traded two No. 1 picks to move up and take defensive tackle Dwayne Robertson, who has not had an immediate impact. 
''I'm disappointed because we lose," Bradway said. ''I'm not worried about draft, free agency all that stuff. Whether we like it or not. this is the team that we put together as a group. If they don't play well, I understand what my role is. 
"I've said all along if you do well you stay. if you don't then you probably leave. That is the standard that has been set." 

After making the playoffs in Bradway's first two seasons run­ning the organization, things could not have started worse for the Jets in 2003. 
Following the offseason losses, starting tackle Josh Evans was suspended indefinitely for violat­ing the league's substance-abuse policy. forcing the team to start Robertson at a position that's often tough for rookies. 
Then came the biggest hit of all: Quarterback Chad Pennington broke and dislocated his left wrist in the preseason and will not return for several weeks. Officials inside the organ­ization acknowledge privately the loss hurt the team more than anything that happened in the offseason, though publicly they have tried to downplay his absence. 
It is no wonder the sight of Pennington throwing again made coach Herman Edwards sound downright giddy Wednesday. But he knows Pennington cannot. solve everything. 
So does the rest of the team, coming off a bye week to play the Buffalo Bills on Sunday.

Associated Press 

DALLAS Jean-Sebastien Giguere wasn't able to carry his postsea­son magic into the new season. 
Giguere allowed goals on the second and third shots against him, then gave up another in each of the final two periods as the Dallas Stars beat the Anaheim Mighty Ducks 4­1 Wednesday night in the season opener. 
Sergei Zubov and Stu Barnes beat him on shots 30 seconds apart in the game's opening minutes, then Zubov made a superb pass to set up Barnes for the third goal, which Giguere had little chance to stop. Bill Guerin flipped in the final goal on a breakaway midway through the third period. 
Giguere finished with 18 saves in his first game since winning the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoffs MVP. 
He had a 1.62 goals­against average, .945 save percentage and five shutouts during the post­season as the Mighty Ducks took New Jersey to seven games in the Stanley Cup finals. 
In rising from seventh seed to Western Conference champions, Anaheim ousted Dallas in the second round. It was a bitter early exit for the conference's top team in the regular season. 
Both teams were break­ing in new captains, hav­ing lost their longtime leaders in the offseason. 
Dallas saw defensive brute Derian Hatcher sign with Detroit, while Paul 
Kariya  signed  with  
Colorado.  
The  Mighty  Ducks  

replaced him by adding Sergei Fedorov and Vaclav Prospal, both of whom led their teams in scoring last season. 
Fedorov's Anaheim debut coincidentally came on the 10-year anniver­sary of the first game in Mighty Ducks history: a 7­2 loss to Detroit in which he scored the winning goal and had two assists for the Red Wings. 
Mike Modano, Dallas' new captain, assisted on Zubov's goal. He now has 44 assists and 63 points against Anaheim, the most by a Mighty Ducks oppo­nent in both categories. 
Modano's linemate Jere Lehtinen, who last season was named the league's top defensive forward for a third time, left in the second period because of a shoulder injury. He was hurt in a first-period colli­sion. 
IN BRIEF 

Colts tackle Glenn ques­
tionable for Sunday 
INDIANAPOLIS -Indianapolis Colts starting offensive tackle Tarik Glenn was listed Wednesday as questionable for Sunday's game against Carolina. 
Coach Tony Dungy said Glenn had an MRI Tuesday that revealed a strained ligament in his left knee. 
Glenn has started 101 straight games since joining the Colts as a first-round pick in 1997 and pro­tects Peyton Manning's blindside as the left tackle. 
Glen, who was held out of prac­tice Wednesday, said he hoped to practice Friday and that he would play Sunday if he was needed. 
Meanwhile, running back Edgerrin James practiced sparingly Wednesday as he continues to recover from a sore back that has caused him to miss the last two games. 
James said he would like to play, but Dungy indicated Tuesday that if he wasn't feeling better, the Colts were likely to keep him off the field against the unbeaten Panthers. 
One of James' backups, James Mungro, also missed Wednesday's practice because of an injured right knee. 
Dungy did not elaborate on the injury and said Mungro was ques­tionable for Sunday. 
Ryan Diem, the Colts starting right tackle, already has been ruled out of Sunday's game. 
Diem has missed two games with an injured left ankle. 
Linebacker Jim Nelson also will sit out this weekend after breaking his left collar bone in Monday night's 38-35 victory at Tampa Bay. 
Nelson is expected to miss eight to 12 weeks and might be placed on injured reserve if he needs surgery. 
Man pleads innocent in 
Williams' sister's shooting 
COMPTON, Calif. -A man accused of killing the half-sister of 

tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams pleaded innocent Wednesday to murder and other charges. 
The suspect, Aaron Michael Hammer, was scheduled to return to court on Oct. 22, when a date for his preliminary hearing would be set. 
Yetunde Price, 31, was shot Sept. 14 while riding with a companion in a sports utility vehicle in Compton. 
Price, a registered nurse and beauty shop owner. was also a per­sonal assistant to her half-sisters. 
Authorities have said Hammer had ties to a gang but is not a mem­ber. 
In addition to murder, Hammer was arraigned Wednesday on charges of personal use of a firearm and possession of a firearm by a felon. 
The Williams sisters began their tennis careers in Compton before moving to Florida.

Notre Dame had their first of two bye weeks last week, and that gave the coaching staff a chance to reevaluate goals and set new ones for the remainder of the season. 
"We set goals for the sea­son, which obviously have to be readjusted as you go through the season.

Rizzo and Sanchez lead Blue to victory 
Special to The Observer 
Cody Rizzo's three-run shot down the leftfield line and Javi Sanchez' bases-clearing triple to the left-center gap fueled a 15-hit attack as the Blue team won again in Game 2 of the Notre Dame baseball team's annual intrasquad scrimmage, holding off another Gold rally for the 13-10 win in Wednesday's action at Eck Stadium. 
The tournament format still allows the Gold a chance to win the Series title but they must defeat the Blue by six or more runs to claim the title. Thursday's third and final game will feature a pitching matchup of the team's lofty sophomore tandem, with 7­

Tom Thornton is the Blue's 
Game 3 starter. 
Sophomore Nick Mainieri ­
son of 1Oth-year Irish head 
coach Paul Mainieri and for­
merly the starting quarterback 
at St. Joseph's High School ­
joined the Irish this fall as the 
team's bullpen catcher but he 
has played a key offensive role 
in both wins for the Blue. 
Mainieri is batting 3-for-5 in 
the series with his 3 RBls tied 
with Rizzo for second on the 
team (Sanchez, with 5, is the 
only other Blue player with 
multiple RBis in the series). 
Mainieri poked an RBI single 
into right field to spark the 
five-run bottom of the second 
that gave the Blue a 6-5 lead 
and he plated another run with 
a squeeze bunt in the fifth as 
the Blue stretched to a 9-5 
cushion. 

Tuesday's game saw the Gold 
commit five errors and yield 
eight unearned runs but it was 
the Blue that struggled defen­
sively in Game 2. making six 
errors that helped bring home 
three unearned runs. Rizzo 
and Sanchez each had a hand 
in either scoring or driving in 
five of the Blue's runs. 
The Blue's four runs in the 
sixth proved to be valuable 
insurance runs, with the Gold 
then scoring three times in the 
seventh with the tying run left 
on deck. The insurance runs 
came after walks by Brennan 
Grogan and Matt Macri ­
sandwiched around Cody Rizzo 
getting hit by a pitch -before 
Sanchez drilled his three-run 
triple and Sean Gaston added 
an RBI single up the middle . 
Senior lefthander Cody Wilkins -who struck out the only two batters he faced in Game 1 -was credited with the Game 2 win after entering in the fourth and retiring five of the seven batters he faced, with one hit and one walk allowed while keeping the Gold from adding to its five early runs. 
Several players continued their hot hitting, with Blue senior infielder Zach Sisko bat­ting 5-for-7 in the series (RBI, 3 R, 3B, 2 2B) while three Gold players are batting .500-plus in the series, led by sophomore catcher Matt Bransfield's seven times on base (4-for-6, 5 RBI. 3 R, 2 2B. 2 BB, HBP), plus sen­ior second baseman Steve Sollmann (5-for-9, 4 R. HBP. 2 SB) and freshman centerfielder Danny Dressman (4-for-8, RBI, 4 R, 2 2B, 2 BB, 2 SB). 
The teams have posted near­ly-identical statistics in the series, with the Blue owning the slight edge in team batting average (.368-.359) but an added advantage in extra-base hits with one home run, two triples and three doubles (all four of the Gold's extra-base hits have been doubles}. Both pitching staffs own a 9.00 staff ERA, with the Gold pitchers owning the strikeout edge (11­
6) while the Blue have issued fewer walks (7 -9; with each staff hitting three batters). Both teams also have totaled six stolen bases while the Blue have seven errors and the Gold six.

While the Irish might rely on Tarin Francis to generate points down low or Chris Quinn and Colin Falls to launch 3-pointers, there is no secret that Thomas is the lynchpin to Notre Dame's suc­cess. In the past, if Thomas has played well, so have the Irish. If they've struggled, so has Thomas. 
"Sometimes before, it wasn't him so much trying to force the issue, but him putting pressure on himself to make the big play," sen­ior Torrian Jones said. "It wasn't himself being selfish but him try­ing to help the team out in any way he can. He is ready to step up and be a big player this year." 
In Notre Dame's four practices this season, Brey said Thomas has done a better job managing the flow of the game. If a teammate grabs a bunch of rebounds, Thomas ensures he gets a pass on offense. If Thomas penetrates, he now looks to pass it to the wing as much as he tries to make a shot. 

"We need him to manage the game better, absolutely," Brey said. "He could make better deci­sions, but he has to score for us, too. He has to make plays for us. I want him to be fearless, daring and go for things. That's a little bit of a fine line with him." 
Thomas brushes off questions about his flirtations with his NBA future, saying that he's totally committed to Notre Dame's suc­cess this season. Ironically, he's counting on his experience with his NBA past to carry the Irish through the season. 
"Through my experiences, the better that you become, the more you learn and the better experi­ence you gain," Thomas said. "I feel like each and every year, I gain more understanding of how to run the team and how to play the game."

''I'm really excited about who we have back," Brey said. "When we think about this team all summer and watching them in four practices, the six returning guys, that if we had to toss it up tonight in a Big East game, I would feel pretty good about it." 
One of those players, who has waited his turn in his first three years at Notre Dame, is Jones. Since his freshman year, Jones has been behind Danny Graves, Carroll and Miller and had not had the team and coaching staff look to him as a leader. 
Being named a captain by Brey over the summer, Jones took that role very seriously, leading the Irish in their off­season workouts. 
"Coach Brey is a class act, and I know he had a plan for me or he wouldn't have brought me here," Jones said. "I knew that if I paid my dues, later on, it would pay divi­dends. 
"I would have the opportuni­ty this year to be a captain ­which is a great honor -and to be a leader and play great minutes for this team." 
With only six players cur­rently in the rotation, Brey wants to use the upcoming trip to Barbados over fall break to experiment with some new

Willingham said he thinks the Irish can have that same type of turnaround, but they can't try and win all their remaining games at once. The team must take it one game at a time. 
"What we have to continue to do is continue to improve, believe in self, the individual and team, and I think we can get some things done," Willingham said. "But it is impossible to write that story that you're writing unless we do it game by game.

Thomas is back and ready to go 
By ANDREW SOUKUP 
Sporrs Writer 
When Chris Thomas pulled his name out of the NBA Draft and decided to return to Notre Dame for his junior year, NBA scouts told Mike Brey he was gaining a much more mature point guard. 
At the time, Brey didn't quite believe what the scouts said. But after a summer leading the team in pick-up games and four full­fledged practices, Brey is starting to realize the scouts were right 
"I told him when he decided to come back, 'You didn't need to go work Nike camp, you need to be here with our team for six weeks and you need to lead,"' Brey said. "I thought he did a great job of that, and I think he took a lot of pride in that 
"I didn't know if I agreed with those NBA people when they told me that, but they were prophetic in that statement." 
Thomas, a 6-foot-1 guard who has started every game of his Notre Dame career, averaged 
18.7 points and 6.9 assists a game last year. And while Brey allowed his star point guard to play fearlessly -and the Irish benefited from his playmaking ability -Thomas also committed back-breaking turnovers. 
But if what Brey has said he's seen in practice carries over into the season, those mistakes will be
