the NAACP has issued a call for Notre Dame and St. Mary's stud­ents to participate in a biracial protest at the Central Adminis­tration Building of the South Bend school system (located at 1228

This proposed action arises in 
response to an incident which occured April 5. Valdez Maxwell a Negro student at Washington High School, was injured by an off-duty policeman who works as a part time security officer at the school. According to Max-a wall because he "had not tucked 
his shirt into his pants properly." Maxwell was later treated at Mem­orial Hospital for injuries to his arm. 
After the alleged assault, the security officer took Maxwell to a police precinct station. The NAACP chapter reports that neith­
er the school principal nor Max­well's parents were informed be­fore this action was taken. 
After what they considered an unsatisfactory meeting with Sup­erintendent of Schools Charles Holt concerning their son's treat­ment and subsequent injury, Mr. and Mrs. Maxwell requested the

acterized his attitude as "hostile 
and deprecating." Miss Barbara

to call off classes. 
At a meeting Sat. Night, the 

NAACP decided to protest Dr. Holt's actions at the regular Mon. meeting of the Board of Ed­ucation. They will demand the right to represent any Negro stu­dent at his request.

WAS KEATS THE BOB DYLAN OF HIS DAY? 

Who was the greatest of the English Romantic Poets­Byron, Shelley or Keats? This question has given rise to many lively campus discussions and not a few stabbings. Let us today try to find an answer. 
First, Keats (or The Louisville Slugger, as he is com­monly called.) Keats' talent bloomed early. While still a schoolboy at St. Swithin's he wrote his epic lines: 
If I am good I get an apple, 
So I don't whistle in the chapel. 

From this distinguished beginning he went on to write another 40 million poems, an achievement all the more re­markable when you consider that he was only five feet tall! I mention this fact only to show that physical prob­lems never keep the true artist from creating. Byron, for example, was lame. Shelley suffered from prickly heat all winter long. Nonetheless, these three titans of literature never stopped writing poetry for one day. 
Nor did they neglect their personal lives. Byron, a ·devil with the ladies, was expelled from Oxford for dipping Nell Gwynne's pigtails in an inkwell. (This later became known as Guy Fawkes Day.) He left England to fight in the Greek war of independence. He fought bravely and well, but women were never far from his mind, as evi­denced by th~se immortal lines: 
How splendid it is to fight for the Greek, But I don't enjoy it half as much as dancing cheek to cheek. 
While Byron fought in Greece, Shelley stayed in Eng­land, where he became razor sharpener to the Duke of Gloucester. Shelley was happy in his work, as we know from his classic poem, Hail to thee, blithe strop, but no matter how he tried he was never able to get a proper edge on the Duke's razor, and he was soon banished to Coventry. (This later became known as The Industrial Revolution.) 
One wonders how Shelley's life-and the course of Eng­lish poetry-would have differed if Personna Super Stain­less Steel Blades had been invented 200 years earlier. For Personna is a blade that needs no stropping, honing or whetting. It's sharp when you get it, and sharp it stays through shave after luxury shave. Here truly is a blade fit for a Duke or a freshman. Moreover, this Personna, this jewel of the blade-maker's art, this boon to the cheek and bounty to the dewlap, comes to you both in double­edge style and Injector style. Get some now during "Be Kind to Your Kisser Week." 
But I digress. Byron, I say, was in Greece and Shelley in England. Meanwhile Keats went to Rome to try to grow. Who does not remember his wistful lyric: 
Although I am only five feet high, 
Some day I will look in an elephant's eye. 

But Keats did not grow. His friends, Shelley and Byron, touched to the heart, rushed to Rome to stretch him. This too failed. Then Byron, ever the ladies man, took up with Lucrezia Borgia, Catherine of Aragon, and Annie Oakley. Shelley, a more domestic type, stayed home with his wife Mary and wrote his famous poem: 
I love to stay home with the missus and write, 
And hug her and kiss her and give her a bite. 


Mary Shelley finally got so tired of being bitten that she went into another room and wrote Frankenstein. Upon reading the manuscript, Shelley and Byron got so scared they immediately booked passage home to Eng­land. Keats tried to go too, but he was so small that the clerk at the steamship office couldn't see him over the top of the counter. So Keats remained in F.ome and died of shortness. 
Byron and Shelley cried a lot and then together com­posed this immortal epitaph: 
Good old Keats, he mirht have been short, But he was a great American and a heck of a good sport.

Vivian Advocates Black Power At Moreau Conference 
gy PAT GAFFNEY 

For the past three days, while most of the campus was still calm, and in the dorms there was only the shuffle of feet pushing dustmops down dim, empty cor­ridors, one building, on the north shore of St. Joseph Lake was at a state of unmitigated activity. The scene was Moreau Seminary (or Moreau Hall, as the inhabitants 
prefer) and the occasion was the National Seminary Conference. This was the second such Con­ference, following a similiar assem­bly of a somewhat smaller scale, which met last year in Glen Ellyn, 
Illinois. 
The second session, and un­doubtly the high point of the Conference for many of the del­egates, was an address by Rev. 
C.T. Vivian, of the Urban Training Center for Christian Mission at the University of Chicago. A long time associate of the late Martin Luther King Jr., Vivian spoke on the plight of the black man in "racist America." "Integration as we have known it, is dead." He suggested that black people have done everything they were told in their attempt to gain acceptance into the mainstream of American life and still they have been rejected. They have sought education, and found that this was not the ticket. They became skilled craftsmen, and this too did not grant entry into Am­
erican society. Later, said Vivian, "We were told, the thing for you to do is develop a middle class, and we set about this task, only to find that the leaders 
that were trained to lead us be-perverted our ends misread our came the traitors that deceived intentions and did not care to 
us, for in the final analysis their money was given to them by white people." 
Frustrated once again, the Black man turned and asked what more he had to do. "Our liberal friends 
said 'Well, it's too late. There's nothing we liberals can do now­they've passed laws. These segreg­ation laws limit you so you have to get rid of those laws. Laws made by a racist society to keep you in bondage.' So we went about that task... until finally we came to that tremendous day, May 17, 1954, when that Supreme Court decision was handed down." Now, at last, the court has spoken; "was this not a society of law and order, wO'!'tld it not in fact be willing now to deal on a 
basis of law and hopefully on a basis of humaness with the black people of this culture? But nothing happened for there was an impasse." 
Black people have no control over their own affairs, their ed­ucation, their housing, their $tores "the institutions within the ghetto 
are controlled by white people who hate black people, who put nothing into the black comm-accept our humanity then you 
must realize how desperate black America is ... We are a colony, and a colonial people have a right not to riot, but to revolt so that what you call a riot, black people call a revolt against ty­ranny." 
The Conference gave birth to two and almost three national organizations. The one not es­tablished was a National Sem­inary Organization as such. Its establishment was suggested be­fore at last year's Conference, where it also met with the feeling that such an organization was not felt to be necessary. The second is a clearing house for all social action activities, involving anything from inner city work

The figure for 196 7 was more than $2 million dollars over the total for the previous year and is topped only by the $12.4 million given to Notre Dame in 196 2 and the $14.1 in 1964. 
Increases were noted in the areas of non-alumni contribut­ions, research grants and fellow­ships from public and private sources, alumni and non-alumni parents, and corporations and foundations. 
While the second largest num­

ber of alumni in history con­tributed to Notre Dame, alumni giving was down from $2,165,699 in 1966 to $1,579,765 in 1967. Frick said fewer major cash gifts were made by .alumni to Notre Dame in 196 7, pricipally be­cause many alumni who nor­mally make year~nd cash gifts instead made substantial pledges toward the University's current $52 million "Summa" develop­ment campaign. 
The largest increase came in the area of research grants and fellowships, where the total went from $4,708,177 in 1966 to $7,271,395 in 196 7. Although 76 fewer corporations and found­
ations gave to Notre Dame in 1967, they contributed $1,885, 824 versus $1 ,613,390 in 1966.

My baptism of fire came midway through freshman year. I had been in the LaFortune Student Center many times, but perhaps due to the odor of the Huddle I had yet to discover the true atmosphere of the place. My date and I were sitting in the Fiesta (sic!) Lounge 
when, raising our eyes for just a moment, we gazed upon a short 
man dressed entirely in black scurrying about gazing with stern dis­
approval upon those who were embracing. The passion patrol was 
in action. 
I have learned much since that day, but the farcical sight of that 
afternoon remains somehow illustrative of the spirit of the Student 
Center. This is not our facility, something put at our disposal for 
use. In spite of merry pronouncements and non-functioning com­
mittees, we the students have no control over the operations of La­
Fortune. Our requests are ignored as the place is run in the spirit 
of an old time freshman dorm. 
Have you ever tried to get into "your" student center early on 
a Sunday morning? After midnight? During a vacation? If you have, 
you are out of luck. LaFortune closes promptly at midnight! To 
boot, "your" student center does not open on many days during 
vacations. It does not open until 9 a.m. on mornings. 
Have you ever wanted to sit in one of the lounges after 11 :30? 
Have you ever wanted to have a room unlocked for a meeting of 
some sort? Have you ever tried to get into the Fiesta Lounge early 
in the afternoon? If you have, you have come upon another part of 
the LaFortune operation plan. As much of the student center as 
possible is kept under lock and key as much of the time as possible. 
You are even made to plan a rather unique version of roulette, 
too, as doors are often locked at random throughout the building 
making it impossible to travel from one place to another without 
a maximum of stealth and cunning. 
In our discussion of "your" student center we must inevitably 
turn, too, to the sparkling cuisine of the Huddle. The place, while 
kept as clean as possible, is much too small. In seeing the long lines 
form where food is being served, Herbert Hoover would have felt 
right at home. 
It would seem that the Huddle also has a problem of pricing. Remember the "good old days" (like last year) when a decent sized Coke cost but a thin dime. Now, however, all that has changed as prices are up. The Huddle, which was making a profit, now pre­sumably is making a killing (Remember, though, that it all goes back into our education). We p::y for it, even as we are locked out 
of our Center facilities. 
Finally we come to the issue of sex and the Student Center. The two are clearly incompah ble. Brother Gorch sees to that. While I have witnessed a clerical tearing apart but once, still there is super­vision. If you want to get any action, you must run the risk that big Brother will be watching. One of the reasons why there was such a demand for the halfway house was, simply, that couples found themselves without a decent place to converse with Gorch staring down in the Center and the ghoulish football players staring down 
from the mural in the back of the Huddle. 
Clearly change is needed in the case of "your" Student Center. Appeals in the past, even for reactivation of the committee which is supposed to supervise the place, have failed. Of the Administra­tion only Fr. McCarragher is in constant contact with the affairs of the Center. However, as we all know, Mac is in the business of calming troubled waters, not of making waves. Thus the task falls to Student Government. 
What should be done? The first step is to leave the Center, all of it including the myriad of locked rooms, open until 2 ·a.m. The Huddle, which closes at 10, should stay open at least until 11. The present closing time is totally unrealistic considering the fact that many study in the Library until 10:30 or so and that most of the campus is up and about until past midnight. Moving back to the Center, a Hi-Fi room and a T.V. room should be opened immediate· ly. If the University takes so much money out of the Huddle, it can damned well spend a little on creating a true center for its students. 
As to management, Brother Gorch ought to be replaced. He is symbolic of the passion patrol and the very literal closed door policy being pursued at the present time. This is our student center and we should not be supervised except by ourselves. Student Govern­
ment should proceed at once to establish some sort of viable student management of the Center. Only then will the spectre of absurdity be removed from LaFortune.

New Kind of Spring For Some 
BY GREG WINGENFELD 

Twenty -one Senior football players depart from Notre Dame this year­eleven of them starters. The players have mixed emotions about the leave-taking. There is a liberation from the daily drudgery of practice. However, there is also the realization that they will never again don the uniform of the Fighting Irish. 
For the first time their spring is devoid of football. "It's great to be a free body," quipped Kevin Rasses, who pl<iyed most of his Notre Dame football on the practice field. "After four years of football, the second semester senior ·year is a new life." Jim Smithberger, 
one-third of the S.O.S. defensive back­
field, commented that "most people don't 
realize that the pressure is as great if 
not greater in the spring as in fall." 
Hob "Rocky" Bleier, last year's team 
captain, concurred. "In the spring prac­
tice you make or break a player. It is 
largely here that positions are won or 
lost." 

"It's great not to have to work," 
said Dan Harshman as he expressed "mixed 
emotions about being on the sidelines." 
Harshman, who played in both the offen­
sive backfields in his career, countered that 
he would "miss the games." Steve Quinn 
last year's center, admitted happily that 
he was "enjoying ·the freedom from 
practice and pressure." He noted that he 
doesn't "have to worry about my name moving up on the list anymore, but I was always willing to grind it out in . practice if it meant we would win." Dave Martin, who was responsible for 203 career tackles from his linebacking slot ventured that he "feels like an 
outsider" when he goes in the locker 
room now. 

The challenge of a career in pre­fessional football lies ahead of some of the players. Deep back Smithberger, commenting on his chances of making it with the Boston Patriots, said, "I've had the finest coaching available and I've played against the toughest competition in the country here at Notre Dame. I feel I'm fortunate in being better pre­pared for professional ball than many other players. If I didn't feel I could 
make the team I would not be ne­
gotiating with them now." 
Formidable John Pergine, a draft pick 
of the Los Angeles Rams, expressed 
satisfaction with his situation. Reminded 
of the fine line backing corps possessed by 
the Rams, Pergine stated that he felt 
"I 'II have accomplished something if I 
make it." Pittsburgh's draft choi~e Bleier 
reasoned, "Considering my abilities and 
the team's need I think there might be 
a position for me." 
Passed over in the draft, Steve Quinn 
has signed as a free agent with the 
Housten Oilers. "I'm kind of small for 
at the Westinghouse plant, yet saves enough of him­

the pros." he reflected, "but players like Mike Tinglehoff, Jim Otto and Jim Ringo, all about my size, have established themselves. So maybe I have a shot." 
Not all the players will go on to pro ball. Kevin Rassas puts it aptly. "Everybody can't be All-American." And all the All-Americans can't be pros. Blue Circle member Martin, presently negot­iating with the Philidelphia Eagles, re­marked that he would "Like to feel that I don't have to play football." He, Smith berger, and Bleier are con­sidering law school. Public Relations ap­peals to Pergine, coaching to Rasses and graduate work to Quinn and Harshman. 
Graduation brings with it expectedly mixed feelings. The relief of getting the sheepskin is tempered by the nostalgia of past good times. "Right now I'll say that Notre Dame is a nice place to be from," offered Smith berger. "I'll miss it later." Pergine agreed, "You can't 
appreciate the place till you're out." 
The challenge of the future was neatly summed up by Dan Harshman. "In school you had time to think. Now is the time to act."

Runners Place At Columbus 
The Notre Dame track team turned in some fine individual and team perfor­mances to sweep the 44th Annual Ohio Relays at Columbus Sat. afternoon. Bob Walsh led off with a victory in the three­mile run, setting the stage for Irish domi­nance of the other twenty-five schools in the field. Bill "Soul Bird" Hurd bested a field of 32 with a 9.5 second 100-yard dash, then assisted in victories in the Sprint Medley Relay and 440-yard Relay. Anchorman Ken Howard set the pace in the Distance Medley Relay, but faded and 
had to settle for 2nd. The Irish placed fifth in both the long jump and discus field events.
