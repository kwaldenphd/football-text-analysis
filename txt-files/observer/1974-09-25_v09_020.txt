HPC to assume lund collection for United Way 
by Bob Radziewicz Staff Reporter 
Responsibility for this year's United Way campaign will be undertaken by the Hall President's CQUllcil, according to Chairman Bob Howl. 
Last year the United Way campaign was conducted by a campus-wide drive through the mail. In co-Qrdinating this year's student drive therrough the HPC, Howl expressed hopes for a more direct involvement on the student level and an even greater success in fund-raising. Tom Suddes, regional director of development for the United Way, ad­dressed last night's meeting, explaining that he felt that the HPC was "the best body to co-Qrdinate this year's drive." 
"The goal we're shooting for this year from student con­tributions is $2,000.. ," Howl explained. "That comes out to something like 40 cents per person. The idea is not to take money out of the students' pockets. In fact, I look at it as a challenge to be creative and innovative in fund-raising for the United Way." 
Howl then went on to suggest selling shamrocks or spon­soring hot dog stands at home football games as a potential means in raising funds. 
In other business, the HPC chairman opened the discussion for consideration of a more legalized judicial system. Suggested avenues of discussion include having a law student available to accompany any student who has been brought before a judicial board. This student advocate would advise the accused of his legal rights. Howl decided to table further discussion until next week's meeting, when John Mazza, now a first-year law student who had served on the University Appeals board as an undergrad last year, will address the HPC. 
Bill McLean, student ombudsman, announced to the hall presidents that "efforts are now underway" to set up an off­campus shuttle system throughout South Bend. A final decisison is expected in the next day or two, according to Mc­Lean. If approved, the shuttle service is scheduled to begin after Friday night's pep rally. 
Howl then told the council that the 1974 HPC hall im­
provement budgets will be reviewed at the next meeting. He 
stressed that budget requests should reflect "honest, 
legitimate expenditures" and that no money would be 
allocated for hall parties or banquets. 
Howl estimated that the funds for each hall would be ap­
proximately $400 although he noted that consideration would 
be made according to the individual needs of the hall. 
Final business included an announcement that Dillon, 
Howard, andMorrisseyhalls are sponsoring a free concert in 
Stepan .. Center following Friday night's pep rally.

Powell speaks of progress 
By Matt Yokom Powell, who was once general counsel of the CivU Staff Reporter Rights Commission, was appointed chairman of the EEOC this January. He pointed out that a 1972 John H. Powell Jr., chairman of the Equal Em­amendment to the 1964 act gave broad powers to his ployment Opportunity Commission, spoke in the Notre commission to eradicate causes of job discrimination 
Dame Law School Lounge yesterday on the progress based on race; religion, sex and national origin.
that his commission has seen in the last nine years. Referring to inequalities that minorities experienced In recalling the days when job abilities and training before the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which created the were "particulary irrelevant if you were a woman or EEOC, Powell stated, "If we view progress in terms of black," Powell said consideration of these where we were a little over ten years ago, I must say qualifications are a reaction to the enforcement of we've come a long way." minority employment rights. 
"But while there is a considerable amount of 
hypocrasy in the concern now being expressed for job 
qualifications, it is progress," Powell stated. 
In discussing the purpose of the EEOC, Powell said "America's most important asset is its' multi-cultural, multi-racial people. When everyone has an opportunity to compete anywhere their abilities and aspiration· carry them, this nation will truly deserve to be called the 'Leader of the Free World.' 
In this spirit, Powell asserted that he is determined to make the "Commission the cutting edge in the national effort to eliminate employment discrimination. 
Powell remarked upon a variety of other subjects, ranging from Indians to the Nixon Administration. Powell felt that the Indians are the most oppressed minority group in the country. "Not enough has been done by any agency," including the EEOC. However Powell said that a task force is being planned to in­vestigate their employment situation. 
When asked about the effect of the Nixon Ad­ministration on the civil rights policies of the provious two presidents, Powell said although he had publically disagreed with the former president's position "on bussing and other things, we cannot say that the Nixon administration, at least in some very important aspects. turned back their oolicies.'' 
Under Nixon and a Democratic majority in Congress the EEOC budget increased $39 million and gained direct enforcement authority. Powell 'added that the jurisdiction of the agency now covers 75 per cent of the work force, or 63 million employees.

Hall Judicial Council seen as alternative 

McGinty: The first thing we have to do is develop hall judicial boards in each and every hall. · 
By Bill Gonzenbach Staff Reporter 
The Student Government Judicial Office is developing a Hall Judicial Coun<;il to act as an ad­visory group and as an alternative disciplinary hearing office for university disciplinary violations. Brian McGinty, Student Govern­ment Judicial Coordinator, outlined the development and goals of the new council yester­day. 
"The first thing we have to do is develop hall judicial boards in each and every hall," said McGinty. The Hall J-Board would elect a chairman Who would be the hall's representative to the Hall Judicial Council. 
"Some ·of the halls have very good J-Boards, but in other halls they are falling apart. Some of the rectors and assistant rectors just don't want them and in some halls, the J-Boards have been left out of the hall's constitution. We need good hall J-Boards before we can do anything," McGinty declaired. 
Once formed, the Council comprised of the hall represen­tatives and the Judicial Coor­dinator would be a unified group to speak to the Administration about disseusion or needed change in the judicial process. 
"If I went to the administration by myself to complain about the judicial process I would be laughed out of the place;' McGinty jested. 
"To start, the Judicial Council would act like the Hall Presidents' Council. It would have no real power or acting authority. We would simply be a student representative in judicial mat­ters," said the judicial coor­dinator. 
"However, we hope to prove we 
can handle problems, so that 
possibly in the spring we could ask 
the Student Life Council to rewrite 
the judicial code to give us more 
authority," McGinty observed. 
The new authority would 
hopefully include the power to act 
as an alternative disciplinary 
hearing group. 
"When a student is charged with the violation of a university regulation, he has the alternative of seeing Mr. Macheca, Dean of Students or Dr. Facenda, General Counsel. We hope that in the future the Judicial Council will act as a third alternative· for discipline hearings," McGinty said. 
"The student has a poor record in university disciplinary action. The Dillon and Lewis Hall in­cidents are examples of this. We hope to aid the student as an ad­visory council or as a third alternative for disciplinary hearings," said McGinty. 
McGinty noted that last year students came to him after a decision had been reached on their case. "It's too late for them, I can only really help before the case is heard," he said. 
"Some disciplinary problems are personal and they are best handled by the coun8eling of Mr. Macheca and Mr. Facenda. However, there are students who need aid and we want to offer 
them advise and a tntra alter­native in disciplinary hearing," said McGinty.

ADIS ABA -(UPI) -The Emir of Abu Dhabi, ruler of a major oil­exporting country, said Tuesday Arab producers would be willing to cut oil prices if western nations reduce the prices of foodstuffs and manufactured products. The statement, the most concrete reaction so far to President Ford's effort to talk oil prices down, was made by Sheikh Zayed ben Sultan, elected ruler of the United Arab Enirates and the hereditary emir of oil-rich Abu Dhabi. 
WASHINGTON UPI -Vice Presidential nominee Nelson A. Rockeffeller said Tuesday that former President Richard M. Nixon's acceptance of a pardon for any Watergate crimes was the same as an admission of guilt. 
But while standing by President Ford's decision to pardon Nixon, Rockefeller disagreed slightly with the President's acceptance of an agreement to turn over the Watergate tapes to Nixon. 
l:iOSTON UPI-Fourteen arrests and three injuries were reported Tuesday as racial flights at Hyde Park High School and demon­stration and classroom boycotts in Charlestown and West Roxbury disrupted the ninth day of a courtordered Boston school integration program.

Assembly allocates fWtds 
by Marjorie lrr Starr Reporter 

The SMC Student Assembly voted Monday night on proposals to dlocate funds for two campus organizations and .entertainment for the SMC Founder's Day. 
The International Student Club 
was allocated $400 to sponsor 
cultural events which benefit the 
whole student body. In a letter of 
request to the assembly, the club 
proposed events such as an In­
ternational Night. The event, 
which will involve all SMC' 
students, will give international 
students an opportunity to discuss 
their countries and customs. 
Off-Campus and Day Students have been granted $500 this year and an amendment also passed legislation which will include this expenditure in the Student Government budget in coming years. One of the events being planned by the Off-Campus and Day Students Organization is an October dance. 
The proceedsof the dance will be 
donated to CARE, but immediate 
funds are needed to pay for a band 
and other details. The allocation 
will also help to sponsor activities 
which will help SMC's three 
hundred off-campus and day 
students become more involved in campuslife. 
A unanimous vote passed a proposal to allot $75 to Saga Food 
Service  has  scheduled  en­ 
tertainment  for  Founders  Day,  
October 13.  

A proposal to broadcast WSND radio in the SMC dining hall during meals, did not pass. Members of the Student Assembly argued that music in the dining hall would only serve to heighten the noise level.

By Theresa Stewart Staff Reporter 
The Alumni Association Board of Directors will do more than watch the game this weekend. An analysis of the goals and objectives of the board, a review of Association and Alumni Club programs, and an update on current University matters are planned for the four day meeting which opened today. 
Paul S. Holowczak, assistant director of the Alumni Association, said, "We want to dispel the myth of Alumni involvement in only football parties. The alumni are an active group concerned about this University.'" 
The 19 members of the Board of Directors, representing different geographical regions of the United States, will convene at the Center for Continuing Education for sessions concerning the Alumni Association and a general briefing on campus affairs by six executive administrators of the University. 
"In the absence of an executive director, the Board's review of the Association, its goals and ob­jectives will be more critical than usual," Holowczak explained. Hew referred to the Alumni Association as in a state of transition since a replacement for James D. Cooney, former Executive Director, has not been selected. 
The President of the Association, Richard W. Murphy, will be in charge of the meeting. 
During the weekend, the Alumni Board will review the Association's many programs. The June Reunion, the Annual Fund, the Sorin Awart to an Outstanding Alumni list only a few of the ac­tivities sponsored by the 176 Alumni clubs. The Board will take a look at the role of the Alumni Senate, the Student-Alumni Relations Group, the Senior Bar and many other activities of the Association. A self-analysis of goals and objectives of the Alumni Board will also be considered.

Approximately 1,500 alumnae living in the Chicago area are being called for pledges as St. Mary's college conducts its second phone-a-thon. The drive stated yesterday and will end tomorrow. 
The fund-raising activity is a project of the Development Office at SMC. All money received will go to the Annual Fund. Sister Ellen Dolores Lynch, vice­president for public relations and development, is in charge of the drive. 
Commenting on the drive, Jody Williams, director of publications 
seniors will focus on job-getting

Office, according to Karen O'Neil, the office's new director. At a meeting yesterday with ap­proximately fifty St. Mary's seniors, O'Neil discussed the purpose of the newsletter and the aims and objectives of the Plan­ning and Placement Office. 
th 
said, "The purpose of the drive is two-fold. First, we are truing to increase the amount which each contributor gives, and second, we want to increase the number of givers." 
Chicago area alumnae are doing the calling form the offices of WMAQ, an NBC affiliate in Chicago. The offices were provided by Lee Schulman, vice­president of NBC and a member of ST. Mary's Board of Regents. 
The first phone-a-thon was held last May in Washingotn, D.C. Williams said the drive was very successful s the number of con­tributors more that doubled. 


Julian Bond to speak tonight 
by Maureen Flynn Staff Reporter 
The Student Union Academic Commission will sponsor an ap­pearance by Julian Bond, Georgia State Legislator from Atlanta tonight. The 34-year old black leader, who recently announced his candidacy for the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination, will give a public lecture in the Memorial Library Auditorium at 8 p.m. 
In fourteen years of public life Bond has compiled an impressive list of accomplishments. In 1960, he founded the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee <SNOC). 
be nominated for the vice-presidency, but was too young to accept the nomination. 
Recently Bond played a major role in the overwhelming victory of George Busbee over Lester Maddox for the Georgia Democratic gubernatorial nomination. 
Today Bond is chairman of the Southern Elections Fund, a non­profit ,non-partisan group, organized to prov1dt-financial and organizational aid to progressive candidates for local office in the 
South. In 1965, when Bond was first elected to the Georgia legislature,there were fewer than 100 black 

In 1965 he was first elected to the ·elected officials in the South.

The goal of the newsletter will differ with each class. For the freshmen, the newsletter will serve as a guide in self-evaluation and analysis. The sophomore section of the newsletter will deal with the connections between various majors and corresponding carrers. Specific carreers and job identification will be the central theme for the juniors and the 
meeting favored the newsletter as the best means of imparting the information that the Planning and Placement Office had to offer. They did not feel meetings would be as effective, since many students have heavy demands already placed on their time. 
This does not mean, however, that the Planning and Placement Office has entirely ruled out meetings or group sessions as a method of counselling students, O'Neil said. O'Neil described several possibilities, including group pre-interview sessions. These sessions will be held one or two days before a group of seniors are scheduled to be interviewed by perspective employers. In­
"We are changing the color of Southern politics," claims Bond. "The way to do that is not to go after the big jobs but to con­centrate on the little ones closer to the people. If enough blacks can be elected at the grass roots level, it's bound to have a major impact on politics at the top." 
In accord with this, Bond has pledged to arrive at the 1976 Democratic convention with a sizeable block of support, "at least enough to influence the nomination." 
Bond has also directed his energies towards continuing the war on poverty, advancing
education for blacks and urging a

legislators who opposed his· statements on the draft and the Indochina War. In 1966, Bond was re-elected by his constituents for the 3rd time, and the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously supported Bond's right to take his seat in the Georgia House. 
At the Democratic National Convention in 1968, Bond charged Georgia Governor Lester Maddox with excluding blacks for par­ticipation as delegates. The replacement of half of the Maddox delegates led to the elimination of the "unit rule," which had previoulsy stifled dissent , and became the forerunner of the convention reforms for 1972.

terviewing procedures, employer information and similartopics will be discussed at this time. Another program proposes awareness sessions to deal with subjects like Assertive Training," "Job-Getting Skills," and "'Decision-Making." 
O'Neil also announced that changes are being made in the recruiting programs and the student intern programs. There will be an expansion in the scope and geographic location of the recruiters and the recruiters primary interest will be in female liberal arts graduates. The change in the student intern program is 
basically one of switching the student from clerical work to peer­
counselling  and  research  
assistance.  
Further changes include  the  

updating and streamlining of all forms and manuals in the Planning and Placement Office. Also SMC is now a member of Catalyst, a service for college-educated women who are interested in professional jobs after graduation.

Confrontations: Rectors or the Dean? 
This Monday's clarification of the recent alcohol directive seems at first glance to be an appropriate and wise response to a very difficult situation. The 
directive to comply with Indiana Supreme Court decisions, issued in late August by Dean of Students John Macheca, ruled that no student under the age of 21 would be allowed to drink on campus. At that time, both Dean Macheca and Brother Just, vice· president for student affairs, emphasized that disciplinary action would, if possible, be confined to the hall staff. 
The clarification agreed upon Monday places most of the burden and respon­sibility for enforcement, as predicted, on the staffs of the residence halls. It stresses non-disciplinary "con­frontation" as the means by which minor violations of the alcohol directive will be handled. 
In light of the complexity of the directive, and the difficult implications presented by the Indiana Supreme Court rulings, this clarification is the most sane means by which each individual violation can be judged. There is no better safeguard against abusive in­terpretations of the rules, by either students or administrators, than the involvement of the hall staffs. 
It will take a great effort of un­derstanding and compromise for the office of Student Affairs and the hall staffs to reach an agreement on the handling of vilations. From the side of the Student Affairs office, it will appear 
DOONESBURY by Garry Trudeau 

to be of the utmost importance that violators be handled with a sense of penalty that will set an example for future cases. From the standpoint of the hall staffs, it will be of the utmost im­portance that violators be handled as individuals, and _members of the hall community, with more regard to the preservation of the sense of hall C(\m­
m unity than to setting an example. 
It is hoped that the office of Student Affairs, and particularly Dean Macheca, will take a step back in these matters and allow the residence hall staffs to be the predominant judicial body. 
In the past, Dean Macheca has taken an active invovement in certain disciplinary cases that may have been better handled within the hall, rather than by the Dean's office. 
For example, last year's Sorin Hall 
incident, concerning ar. illegal party, 
may have been better handled in the 
hall than in the Dean's office. This is 
judgement by hindshight, though, and 
similar judgement may not have seemed 
feasible at the time. 
In commenting on the clarification, Student Body President Pat McLaughlin said "As long as the students understand these, there should be no problems." 
What will, in the future, prove to be the most important understanding of· all will be Dean Macheca's interpretations of his role within the framework of these clarifications.

Fear and 
Disgust 

at SNC 
Dear Editor, 

In the past issues of the Ob­
server, there have been several 
statements of condemnation on the 
subject of so-called "panty raids." 
None of these articles, however, 
can even approach adequate ex­
pression of the fear and disgust 
with which the last raids were 
received by man of the SMC 
women. 

1We three are RA's from 
McCandless hall who were present 
when these incidents occurred. We would like to make an appeal to the 
men of Notre Dame to stop and consider what has been done during these destructive jaunts. Physical dama ge to the buildings at SMC means relatively nothing when the psychological and physical harm inflicted on in­dividuals is considered. One girl suffered a concussion; one of us was dragged out of a window, broken in two by some of your numbers; night hall directors were subjected to numerous atrocities including some men exposing themselves to these womf:!n, 
We realize fully that as in­dividuals you are, on the whole, a fairly respectable bunch. However, the mob psychology seems to eliminate any sense of respect for the dignity of the in­dividuals who reside in our halls. Certainly, there were a few women who were responsible for letting men int o the door: we realize the problem is not one-sided. In a commmunity such as ours is supposed to be, however, con­sideration for individuals should be of prime concern. 
The actions of the latest raids have instilled a great deal of fear among hall staffs and residents, fear which is very genuinely felt in regards to basic security. We would ask you to top and consider what you are doing, and remember your own self-respect before you decide to participate in one of these very un-traditional excursions. 
We are people and you are people: let's have a little self­respect. 
Thank you, 
Carol Collins

Abortionists: 
Murderers? 
Dear Editor: 

I wish to express my whole­
hearted endorsement of Professor 
Mcintosh's refutation of Professor 
Rice. Obviously, even if abortion 
is murder, those who merely ap­
prove of abortion without having 
undergone or performed one can 
hardly be deemed "murderers": 
they would be complices to mur­
der. And, as Professor Mcintosh 
points out, how could a Methodist, 
or a University Woman, or a 
member of the American Civil 
Liberties Union be a murderer~r 
even an accomplice? Professor Rice seems to share with others of his ilk a perverse disinclination to be awed by the powerful and respectable of the world--a per­versity, alas, shared by too many self-styled "moralists" from Jesus Christ on down. Such reasoning, taken to extremes, would lead us to take an unkind view of those good Germans who failed to try to stop Hitler, or who simply carried out the policies of the constitutionally established regime. 
The strongest point of Protessor Mcintyre's letter is his concern for those children of poverty doomed to be "cruelly and postnatally aborted." In such cases, the clear rule should be : The sooner the better. Some few of thse un­fortunates might even have the postnatal abortion delayed 80 or 90 years, and think of all the suffering they would have to go through then. Professor Rice might fatuously suggest that such children be fed rather than but­chered in the womb. No doubt, he would also argue that a man with astigmatism be fitted with glasses. 
This is a mere expedient, a tampering with the symptoms. To get at the root, you should put out his eyes. 
In this regard I would suggest that the abortionists themselves are too content to rest with half­way measures. I would propose that by law every human organism be sterilized upon or before puberty. This measure would work no hardship on anyone, would avoid even the hint of "murder," and, in the long run, would solve every human problem that I am able to think of. Within twenty years, for instance, birth defects and juvenile delinquencey would be eliminated. Within a century we might have a little peace and quiet around here. 
Sincerely, Peter R. Moody, Jr.

seeing spaceship earth from nd 
by lokesh pate/ 

Paul-Ho Liu, President Chinese Student Association 
"After seeing the jewels at Topkapi, the fabled Blue Mosque, and bazaars, it's awafullv nice to come home to lstanbulliilton." -Advertisement in Time magazine 
The international Student Advisor's Office on camp·1s,located in the basement of LaFortune is also a home away from home for the International Student. The ever-busy, informal, cozy and friendly environment of the office is the major interface to the campus and South Bend environments. Unlike the average American campus student, the average international student undertakes a trip abroad for the sole purpose of educational endeavors within an institution such as Notre Dame; the basic reason fol' this is the economic limitations of the international students. Hence, the "cultural impact" is far greater in dimension, and Father Dan O'Neil, the International Student Advisor, secretary Betty Fit­terling and Carol Nelson, through various orientation activities, the host-family program and get-togethers, help tremendously in helping one adjust to an alien environment. 
When the Americans landed on the moon, the act demonstrated two things, namely: superior space technology, and the words "spaceship earth" were used for the first time by the great Guru Bucky Fuller. In other words, you and I are on board a spaceship,right now. 
On board a spacecraft, the crew lives in harmony with each other and with the spacecraft itself. Similarly, the American and in­ternational students can interact, leading to an overall better visualization of each other's customs, cultures and ~uriosities . The major aim of the International Student Organization is TOTAL HARMONY! 
This global village, the spaceship earth, has been guillotined' into two distinctly transcending human created "boundaries." The boundaries between the haves and the havenots. The nations. of the rich and the nations of the poor. The technological nations versus the Third World. There is increasing evidence that the spaceship earth is heading towards a technological milieu. Hence, the following observations by Sargent Shriver seem appropriate: 
"We know that no nation is an island, and that we cannot drift away from the reailty of the world around us. In his 1965 State of the Union message President Johnson said: 'We were never meant to be an oasis of liberty and abundance in a worldwide desert of disappointed dreams.' I am reminded of the old Eastern fable of the man who was condemned to hell. Because in one of his few actions of generosity he had spared a spider, the Lord let down to him a single spider thread. He grasped it, and began to be lifted up. 
All hell grabbed for his feet and began slowly to rise with him. In terror that thread would break, he kicked off the hangers-on, and the resultant jarring shock snapped the thread. Perhaps America must lift the world to find its own salvation. 
The spaceship earth has now become a complex and complicated web of knowledge explosion. It is not the question of America alone lifting the world to find its own salvation. Every nation on spaceship earth must lift the world to find its own salvation. Through acoordinatedeffort it can be done. This, then is the prime and major aim of the I.S.O.-total harmony within and beyond the campus. Notre Dame and St. Mary's College students and faculty always are welcome to the I.S.O. events.

by Bob Radziewicz Staff Reporter 

Homecoming '74 begins its annual swing today when the first of three ticket packages is placed on sale by the Student Union, according to S:>eial Commissioner Hich Guiltinan. 
This year Homecoming weekend is set for October 12-13, when the 
Rice Owls fly into South Bend for Saturday afternoon's contest with the Fighdng Irish. This specialweekend will be kicked off Friday night, Oct. 11, when the Student Union presents Gordon Lightfoot in concert at the ACC following the 
pep rally. 
The festivities continue Saturday 

night with a Homecoming party 
hosted by the Student Union in St. 
.Joseph, Michigan. "The theme of 
this year's party is 'Cabaret' 
That's the type of atmosphere 
you'll find at an old abandoned 
amusement park on Lake 
Michigan;Siluer Beach Ballroom, 
Saturday night," Guiltinan said. 
(-::;;::;:~~~:;:-:=:;;:;:;;;';;iiij;i;;~iii:::--l 
Will there be Gordon Lightfoot tickets available at the Student Union ticket office? 
Tickets for the Gordon Lightfoot concert will be on sale at 1:30 on 
Wednesday in the Student Union Ticket Office for $6.50, $5.50, and 
$4.00. 

Will there be a Homecoming package deal available this year like the one sponsored by the Social Commission last year? 
The Social Commission will again offer a Homecoming package deal for the students. It will consist of 2 football tickets (sold separately at $8.50 each), and 2 tickets to Cabaret, the Homecoming party which will be held at Silver Beach in St. Joseph Mich. The cost of this package will be $23.00, however any student who has purchased tickets to the Gordon Lightfoot concert earlier is entitled to a $2.00 discount. This package deal will go on sale at 8a.m.in the La 'Fortune Ballroom. Your l.D. is required and there is a limit of one package per student. 
My car is parked in the C-4 parking lot and I was wondering will I have to move it for the Purdue game? 
According to Security , all students who have cars parked in sections C-3, C-4, and D-2 will have to have them moved out by 8:00 dm Saturday and on every home football game. You can park your rar in any other student parking lot or in the greeenfield if you get it there before 11:00 am. 

The party, for couples only, will 
have two bands playing. Wine, cheese, and beer will also be served. The Social Commissioner 
further noted that 12 buses will be used for transporting the couples to and from the party. 
Guiltinan then explained the three package deals that the Student Union will be offering for Homecoming '74. 
Offered in the first package are tickets for the Gordon Lighfoot concert Friday night and the 
"Cabaret" party on Saturday night. The package which includes two concert tickets and one party bid(for the couple), offers a two dollar discount on the party bid. "This package will go on sale Wednesday, September 25, at 1:30 
p.m. in the LaFortune ballroom," Guiltinan said "There will also be a limit of .150 concert-party packages, on a first come-first 
serve basis " Tickets f~r the Friday night concert without the special S u deal aiso go on sale Wednesday 
afternoon. Gordon Lightfoot 
tickets are available either through the Student Union or the ACC ticket office. 
The second package includes two tickets for the Rice-Not~e Dame 
game and one homecommg party ticket, all for $23.00. This package goes on sale, Thursday, Sept. 26, at 8a.m. in the LaFortune ballroom. "I won't be able to determine thetot~l numb~r of packages ayailable until late Wednesday 
mght. I can only say that the s.tudent Union will place all~Ickets on sale Thursday mor~~ m~ . one pa.ckage per student,Gmltma~ affirmed. . 
Referrmg to th~ Ho~ecommg scandal l.ast year m which some football tickets were re~e~ved for stud.ent gover~m~nt officials! the Social Commissioner explamed how this. year's distributi?n of football ticket packages Will be 
handled. "First of all, no preference to Student Gover~ment or Student Union officers will be given. All tickets given to the Student Union
for the Rice game will be sold, beginning Thursday morning. They <the tickets) will go on sale at 8 a.m. sharp, not one minute before," Guiltinan declared. 
"Also Bill McLean and his 
ombudsman staff will help 
maintain single-file order in the 
ballroom, which should ensure a 
fair system for the ticket 
allocation," he added. 

The final package offered by the 
Student Union includes only 
Homecoming party bids, which 
will be sold at $6.00 per couple. 
These separate "Cabaret" tickets 
will be available Friday during 
regular Student Union hours. 

liUiltinan added that 100 bids, excluding the other two packages, go on sale at S.U. offices in LaFortune.

Concession stands hit record high n~r 
by Valerie Zurblis Staff Reporter 
A record 48 groups are opening concession stands for this year's home football game, according to Fr. David Schlaver, Director of Student Activities. 
Thirteen residence halls plus 35 other campus clubs and organizations will participate at 16 sites on campus. Last year 26 groups operated stands at 13 sites. 
Everything from hotdogs and hamburgers to the Knights of Columbus steak sandwiches and the handmade pillows sold by law school student wives will be on sale for students and campus vistors at home game weekends. 
Schlaver said to attract attention to the routine hotdog stands "there should be a gimmick. Do something different.'' 
WSND will broadcast live from their food stand. The cheerleaders will show off their acrobatics at their Notre Dame souvenirs booth and the lacrosse team will exhibit their playing equipment. 
Schiaver expects no trouble this year. "The whole concession situation is systematized enough that we don't expect any problems." 
The money raised by the clubs and residence halls will go to the organizations themselves. The proceeds from the Knights of Columbus stand will go to Corvilla, a home for retarded young adults.
