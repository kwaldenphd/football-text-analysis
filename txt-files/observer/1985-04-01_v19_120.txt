Senate restructuring -page 4 


South African police open fire into crowd; 1 killed, 10 wounded 
Associated Press 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa ­Police fired rubber bullets and tear g'\S into a crowd of blacks leaving a funeral yesterday near the southern city ofPort Elizabeth. Witnesses said one man was killed and I 0 people were wounded. 
Police Lt. Henry Beck said at na­tional headquarters in Pretoria that police used "rubber bullets, tear gas and shotguns" in ·Zwide black township. He said he knew of no casualties. 
But, witnesses said a 28-year-old 
man was killed. 
Several black reporters and other witnesses said a crowd of un­determined size left the funeral, which was held for blacks slain in recent violence. They were walking to the township bus terminal when police in armored personnel carri­ers opened fire. 
"There were some incidents of stone-throwing by the crowd . . . One youngster picked up a tear gas cannister and threw it back at police," said one ofthe reporters. He asked not to be identified because as a journalist, he is bannedfrom enter­ing the townships. 
The identity of the man reported 
killed was not known, nor was the 
seriousness of the reported injuries. 
Hospitals in the area said they did 
not treat any victims, but blacks 
injured in riots generallyshun hospi­
tals for fear ofbeing arrested. 
Four people, including a 9-year­old boy, were buried in the Zwide funeral. They perished in clashes with police, and in attacks by blacks against other blacks accused of fronting for the white-minority gov­ernment. 
Six miles inland, two riot victims were buried without incident outside the town of Uitenhage as hundreds of police and army troops stood by, according to police and witnesses. 
On March 2 1 , police shot and 
killed 19 blacks near Uitenhage, 
charging their demonstration had 
turned violent. Black witnesses 
denied a police account which said 
demonstrators were armed with 
stones and weapons, and said police 
attacked without justification. 
Soldiers and police manned key 
intersections near the Zwide 
township and Uitenhage funerals, 
witnesses said. In Uitenhage, civilian 
police reservists with shotguns lined 
the streets as vehicles ferried blacks 
from the burial area through a three­
block white section to a black slum. 
Police have frequently called out 
the military following a nationwide 
outburst of anti-apartheid rioting in 
black communities eight months 
ago. More than 250 people have 
been killed since last summer by un­
official count. 
Funerals of riot victims, attended 
by thousands of mourners, may 
touch off more violence. 
Police guarded government 
buildings in Uitenhage and threw up 
a roadblock on the main highway 
linking the area with Port Elizabeth, ·residents said. The four-lane high­way brushes against several im­poverished black areas, where white motorists have occasionally been stoned. 

The Palm Sunday liturgy was a special live br()(ld­cast by NBC. The mass was the first ever telecast nationally from the University's 19th century got­hic church.

Student Senate to vote tonight on restructuring proposal 
ByAMYBAKER 
News Staff 
The Student Senate tonight will vote on the proposed restructuring of the student government constitu­tion. 
The student officers-elect were scheduled to take office today, but because of the proposed changes, the I 984-SS senate voted to extend their terms ofoffice until April 1 5. 
"We were elected to a position that's not there anymore -that's ab­surd. The present senate changed the position and extended their time in office, which is an abuse ofauthor­ity, nothing new for this senate," said Jim Hagan, district 5 senator-elect. 
"There were a million dilferent is­sues to address and the senators just didn't do it," said Hagan. 
"A restructuring is not necessarily needed. What's needed is a better in­strument of communication be­tween the senate and administration and better people," he said. 
Chris Abood, district 1 senator­elect, favors implementing the pro­posal for the 1985-86 school year, but said the senate should have com­pleted the restructuring before April 1 , rather than extending their terms for two weeks. 
"It takes about two weeks to hold an election, but the Student Senate wants to try and rush it through in a week, before the new constitution which provides for the new senators is even written," said Abood. 
Hagan said, "The whole restruc­turing should not have been taken up this late and has gone much too quickly. It should have been left up to us, the new senators. This action sets a trend, and student govern­ment can't be taken seriously if this type ofabuse continues." 
"The restructuring is a good idea and is well intended, but too rushed. There should be a transition year for 
the  restructuring."  said  Steve  
Taeyaerts,  special  projects  ex­ 
change coordinator.  

The proposed changes include electing a student"senator from each dorm, as well as one off-campus senator, removing the voting privileges of the student body trea­surer, Student Activities Board manager, Hall Presidents' Council chairman, judicial coordinator, class presidents, Freshman Advisory Council president, and three HPC members on the senate. 
The voting members· would in­clude the student body president in the case of a tie, the student body vice president, and the 25 elected members of the student senate, ac­cording toJim Domagalski, member of the senate restructuring commit­tee. 
As a procedural change, the stu­dent body president would be able to veto aproposal ofthe senate, but a two-thirds majority could override the veto, according to Domagalski. 
The proposed changes, if passed, will take effect for the 1985-86 school year. This means that the five senators-elect will no longer have the same positions in student gov­ernment as they understood them to exist when they were elected. The principal reason for the proposed change in the set-up of student senators is so that the senators can better represent the. people who elect them, said Domagalski. _ 
In the past, the appointed mem­bers of the president's cabinet were doing the work that should have been done by the senators. Therefore, the senators were unable to meet students needs, according to Domagalski. 
"The restructuring is a reaction to the senate's inactivity in the past. They felt that the inactivity and abuse of power weren't the fault of the senate, but the fault of the constitution, so they have decided to restructure it," said Taeyaerts. 
"The senate keeps playing fast and loose with the rules," said John Ginty, district 3 senator-elect. 
The senators-elect, under the new proposal, will automatically represent their own dorms. "It's logical for the senators-elect to represent their respective dorms, since all of them carried their own dorms,"said Taeyaerts. 
If the proposal is passed, each dorm will be represented equally with one vote in the senate, regard­less of the dorm's size. 
"The idea ofdistrict senators is a little weak, but there will still be a problem with dorm representa-tion because of the numbers in­volved," said Taeyaerts. "Howard Hall will get the same amount of money allocated to it by the senate as Flanner Hall, even though there are four times as many guys in Flanner," he said.

A cartoonist's guide to the Inside column 

In Brief . 
At the Palm Sunday Mass yesterday in Sacred Heart Church, which was broadcast nationwide by the National Broadcasting Company, University President Father Theodore Hes­burgh's homily may have been a little too long. The homily, which was about the meaning of Holy Week, lasted 9 minutes, 30 seconds. Only 4 minutes had been allotted in the broadcast schedule. As a result, the broadcast was cut off in mid-Communion and replaced with a discussion ofNazi Germany on the program, "Campus View."­

Lights out, uh huh.That was the case at both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's yesterday, when a tree fell across some power lines, causing electricity at both schools to be cut off.

Professional wrestling body slammed its way to the peak ofchic yesterday, squeezing the likes ofLiberace, Billy Mar­tin, singer Cyndi Lauper, TV's Mr. T and Muhammad Ali into its new­found hammerlock on hype. The ballyhooed event was "Wrestlemania," an extravaganza ofhead-bashing at Madison Square Garden, which was broadcast via satellite to Stepan Center. Topping the card was the grudge tag-team match pitting Hulk Hogan and Mr. T oftelevision's "A team" -in his first professional wrestling perfor­mance -against Rowdy Roddy Piper and Paul "Mr. Wonderful" Orndorff. "It's rough out there," panted television's Mr. T, who joined good-guy wrestling champion Hogan in stomping two heels in a tag-team grudge match. "It's not for no wimps, wrasslin'." Pianist Uberace, timekeeper for the main event, arrived in a full-length fox coat. Hogan posed for photographs with referee Ali, dwarfing the 
former boxing champion. -AP

After becoming a trusty at the Cross City prison, he walked away in 1978. Hendry headed to Oklahoma City, where he worked, paid taxes, and opened his own salvage business. Later, after being erroneously told by a relative he was no longer wanted, he moved to Perry, Fla., and turned himself in when he learned he was still being sought. -AP

Ha! It's finally my chance to write the inside column. As the cartoonist for this page for over a year now, I've acquired a keen skill for picking out the really good arti­cles from the bad. 
It's simple. The good ones are easy to draw for; the bad ones aren't. 
How can you tell if it's going to be a column worth reading? Simply look at the cartoon. If it looks neatly drawn, has action, good composition, contrast, and maybe a clever idea worked into it, then chances are it will be an enjoyable piece of journalism. 
But, if the cartoon looks sketchy, disorganized, or simply doesn't make sense, you should pass on this one. Another way to tell a good article from a bad one is to recognize the different kinds ofauthors. 
The editor-in-chief: This author will always provide a meaningful bit ofopinion writing, often with a twist that makes it more personal to the reader. The editor-in­chief knows that his or her name and position will ap­pear at the top of this

are allowed more involvement in the education of their children are more tolerant of their society. He said, "The society allows full expres­sion of ideas. People enjoy plurality." 
Coons also said it was in the best 
interest ofchildren to have their par· 
ents, not society, decide their educa· 
tion. 
"Parents are the greatest source of 
their own children's liberty," said 
Coons. 
Gutmann, a professor of politics, countered with several arguments. She said tolerance would not be nurtured under Coon's method of education. Instead, she said, parents would send their children to the schools that were most in conform­ity to their own beliefs. "All the prejudices of Protestant parents would continue to be instilled in their children," she said. In this way, she said, "Democratic citizens can abuse their public authority." 
Gutmann also appealed to the right of the individual child. She asked Coons, "Aren't children dem· ocratic citizens?" Gutmann argued that children should not be consid­ered merely an extension of their parents, but should be allowed to develop values in a randomly selec­ted environment. This, said Coons, is best done in a school with a mixture ofstudents. 
The debate was sponsored by the Thomas J. White Center on Law and Government. The center was estab­lished to examine public policy questions within the framework of Judeo-Christian values.

Saint Mary's class of '85 to pledge donations for EXCEL fund drive 
ByANNE MONAS'IYRSKI 
SentorStaffReporter 
A three-year pledge to the EXCEL 
program is the parting gift of the 
class of 1985 at Saint Mary's. 
The Challenge, the name of the senior gift, is designed so that seniors will donate increasing amounts during the next three years. April 8 through April 18 has been designated as "blitz week." This week will be used to receive 
pledges from the seniors. 
The gift is an effort to show class spirit as future alumnae, according_ to Usa O'Shea, assistant director of development at Saint Mary's. 
The 525 million EXCEL campaign is the College's current fundraising effort begun by College President John Duggan. 
This year's gift is a new type of 
senior class gift because it is de· 
signed to create an awareness of 
seniors as alunmae-to-be, according 
to Senior Class President Deborah 
Pascente. 

Last year, the class of 1984 
donated the exercise bicycles in An­
gela Athletic Facility. 
Because this is Duggan's last year at Saint Mary's, "We're a special year to begin this ( campgaign)," Pas­cente said. The class of 1985 has benefitted from the EXCEL cam· paign already because funds were used to build the Cushwa-Leighton 
Ubrary and the Haggar College Cen­ter. 
Each ofthe 25 senior board mem­bers will ask individual seniors for their contributions. The names of those who pledge will be posted on the senior bulletin board in LeMans Hall along with a thermometer to in­dicate campaign progress. 
The committee composed of O'Shea, Pascente and senior class Vice President Mary Sue Dunn devised three possible pledges totalling 590, $120, and $150 during the three-year period. But, O'Shea stressed that donations of any amount are acceptable. 
"It's important to the school that they (seniors) get going on this," O'Shea said. According to O'Shea, while the last I 0 graduating classes have been the largest in the Col­lege's history they have given the least. 
O'Shea points to two probable reasons for the lack of donations by this group. "One, the College has not been asking (for donations) for many years (about I 0 to 1 1 years) and two, seniors never have made a pledge before," unlike most col­leges. Colleges "exist by gifts," O'Shea said. 
The first year's donations will be a 
restricted fund. The money from the 
pledges will go to counseling and 
career development at the College. 
The senior board decided to

direct donations there because as seniors who have used the center in job search, "We can relate to that," Dunn said. Since the College cannot afford to fund all things on campus, counseling and career development "is one of the last things that would get money." The money will be used to help computerize the Counseling and Career Development Center. 
The following two-year's pledges 

will go to the regular EXCEL cam· 
paign fund to be used in all areas 
where there is need. 
Because Duggan has been com· 

mitted to fundraising for the Col· 
lege, O'Shea said,· "he'd be really 
excited to see that the senior class 
understands the needs of the school 
as a going away present, especially 
since he's leaving." 
At most colleges it's a question of how mt~ch to give, but at Saint Mary's "the question here is should I write a check at all." Statistics gath· ered by O'Shea indicate that among I 0 private colleges and universities Saint Mary's has the lowest percentage of alumnae participation with 29.3 percent donating. William's College, a private co­educational school with 1,910 stu· 
dents has the highest with 65.4 per 
cent alumni donating. There were 
I ,839 students at Saint Mary's when 

the statistics were gathered. Alumni 
contributions at Notre Dame were 
41.2 percent.

Student Senate vote is April Fools joke 
Today. April I, the new student government officers were to have taken of­
fice. They will not. Instead, the outgoing senators will be voting tonight on a 
proposal which would radically change the positions to which these new offi­
cers were elected. 

In a move to restructure student government, the present officials extended 
their terms of office for two weeks and in that time they plan to complete an 
overhaul of student government. · 

The first question to be asked is why the present leaders have taken it upon 
themselves to restructure student government now? 

An obvious answer is that the sudden burst of activity stems from an effort to 
rebuild prestige after the secret senate meetings, the questionable reinstate­
ment of the Browne-Cahill ticket, the subsequent resignations of some govern­
ment leaders and the poor voter turnout of 44 percent. 

Although Rob Bertino, student body president, and other government leaders 
began discussing the possible revamping of student government in November, 
and although Bertino made restructuring a goal of his administration as early as 
last spring, no significant effort to restructure was made until after the election's 
debacle. Had these campus leaders seriously worked on the reconstruction 
throughout the past year, they would not have needed to extend their terms of 
office. 

There can he no excuse for the extension other than inefficiency and in­decisiveness. It is that simple. Two weeks is not enough time for the present senators to do a job which should not be theirs in the first place. 
The problem with student government is not just what they do, but how and when they do it. Student government suffers from a chronic sense ofbad timing. Rather than defining the problems ofstudent government and leaving the actual restructuring to the newly elected officials, the present leaders-many ofwhom are to blame for the problems student government is now facing-took it upon themselves to lengthen their terms and hurriedly move to form a new constitu­tion. 
Students elected new leaders a month ago and expected these officials to take office today. Because this has not happened, the credibility of student govern­ment is once again brought into question. 
Under the restructuring plan, the senate would be comprised of 25 senators. Each of the 24 halls would have a senator and the off-campus students would be represented by one senator. 
'Jbe soon-to-be senators find themselves in a most difficult position. They ran for office, campaigned throughout their districts, and now find themselves at the mercy of those they were supposed to replace. 
According to the plan, the four district senators and the one off-campus senator just elected automatically would become the senators of their respective places of residence. This is not the position for which they cam­paigned and it is not the position which students elected them to fill. 
It may he argued that because each of the new senators carried his place of residence, the,plan has some justification. Still, the fact remains the new senators were elected to be senators from their districts, not their dorms. 
In this case, student body opinion seems to be an afterthought to the present officials. The campus leaders should have sponsored a public forum to discuss any restructuring plan, and that plan ultimately should have been voted on by the student body. No plan will succeed unless the students support it and stu­dents should not support this rushed restructuring. 
'Jbe present senate and the Hall Presidents' Council should reject the new constitution before the credibility ofstudent government completely crumbles. 'Jbe final solution is being made without the approval of those whom the gov­ernment serves: the students. 
How appropriate for April Fools Day.

lbe Catholic church is a church that claims to be fired by "the Spirit of the truth." But more and more this claim is being called into question. This is because many Catholics feel the pope, the hierarchy, and certain vocal minorities in the church misrepresent the role that individual conscience plays in the faith. Indeed, some Catholics feel their con­sciences are being manhandled by an institu­tional church that is overly impressed with its own authority. These Catholics feel abused, 
and think the leadership of the church is un­dermining the church's claim of being in­spired by the truth. 
Clearly, church leaders claim that Catholic morality is firmly rooted in the idea that one's conscience must always be obeyed. But many 
Vernon Marchal 
afterwords 
Catholics feel that, coming from these leaders, 
it is a dubious claim. Instead of allowing this 
claim to stand on its own, many Catholics feel 
church leadership obscures the integrity of 
this claim by surrounding it in a fog of of­
ficiality and cynicism. 
Certainly, if to be Catholic means to obey 
one's conscience, then it is not adequate for a 
Catholic to obey someone else's conscience, 
be it thepope's, the hierarchy's, or whoever's. 
This is not to deny or make light of the fact 
that Catholics belong to a community of 
believers which is united by the truth, and 
that out ofa sense offidelity to this unity, they 
should obey the pope when their conscience 
tells that such obedience is warranted. But this in no way implies that to be true to his Catholicity, a Catholic must subsume his con­science in favor of the pope's or anyone else's. And any authority, tradition, or attitude that implies that he must, or that impedes or makes more difficult the honest exploration ofone's own conscience, is at its heart uncatholic and is abusive of not only any claim of Catholic authenticity that it is presuming to invoke, but also of the unity of the church that all. Cat­holics seek to preserve and enhance. 
It is an unequivocally Catholic belief that the members of the church are obligated to act on the proddings ofconscience that is cer­tain, and that if this certainty is lacking, they must seek to educate their conscience. Thus, Catholics believe that faithfulness to con­science is connected with a sincerity in wan­ting to know the truth. But many Catholics feel the pope, the hierarchy, and others inject into this Catholic idea ofconscience the cyni­cal notion that human beings are somehow predisposed to evade the truth when they 
think that it will lead to hardship or the giving up ofsomething that is pleasurable. 
Garry Trudeau 
Many Catholics encounter this cynical atti­tude in the "Humane Vitae" in what the church leadership called the "grave conse­quences" of artificial methods of birth con­trol. Many Cathothics feel that, because of its cynical view of human nature, the leadership of the church has taken it upon itself to pro­vide the faithful with a yardstick by which those in the church might reliably determine how sincere they are in wanting to know the 
truth. Indeed, the pope, the hierarchy, and 
others often seem to claim that the ultimate 
measure ofa Catholic's sincerity is whether he 
listens to the teachings ofthe leadership ofthe 
church. Ifhe follows these teachings, then his 
sincerity is beyond question; if he does not, 
then his sincerity falls under suspicion. 
Now there are a great many Catholics who do not agree with, or who do not follow the teachings of the pope and the hierarchy, and there are a number ofthese who do so in good conscience. It is these Catholics who feel most offended by the church leader's cynicism, and it is these Catholics who feel that the institutional church is trying to bully them either out of the church or in line by presuming to call into question their sincerity in wanting to know the truth. lbese Catholics feel the pope and the hierarchy are grossly over-stepping their authority, and that in so doing, they are undermining the church's claim to be inspired by "the Spirit of the 
truth." 
But the fact is neither the pope nor the hierarchy have any authority to judge the sin­cerity of the faithful, nor do they claim any such authority. But, because the leaders ofthe church often take strong stands on issues where there is much disagreement, and be­cause certain big mouth minorities in the church (including some members of the in­stitutional church) often distort the leader­
ship's position on these issues, those who find themselves disagreeeing with the church's teachings are frequently made to feel like second-class Catholics. Of course, they are not, although the leadership of the church does not go out of its way to tell them that they are not. 
In the future, perhaps the challenge before those who dissent from the teachings of the church's leaders is to make sure they really know what those teachings are. And perhaps the challenge before church leaders is to be less cynical, more clear, and more supportive of those Catholics who have disagreements with their teachings. Indeed, if both Catholic dissenters and church leaders treat each other with more understanding, perhaps neither side will be inclined to feel abused.

SMC Chick Extraodinaire 
The purple rain will fall as Prince takes top billing at Aint Married's College following his appointment as College president until 1999, said president Jock Dugger. 
"Prince is the ultimate choice for these SMC's," said Dugger. "He is someone the chicks can look up to, sort oflike a role model, you know?" 
"Let's go crazy, girls," exclaimed Prince, upon hearing news ofhis ap­pointment. "You should all know that I would die for you." 
The new president said there are many policy changes he's looking forward to implementing. 
"For instance, parietals, what is a parietal, I'd like to know?" he asked. "Twenty-four hour a day visitation has come to campus with your ew leader, babes." 
"Prince was, like you know, my first choice for the job," Dugger commented. "Here I was sitting at Purple Rain with the wife, and, like, I just could not believe the talent oozing from this guy! Plus, you know, I was looking at those costumes of Apollonia, Wendy, and Usa. Why can't those SMC girls start dressing like that, I want to know? 
Prince agreed with Dugger and said his first appointment as presi­dent will be the selection of Apol­lonia as Dean of Student Dress. "Anyone caught with a Forenza sweater will forced to listen to 'USA for Africa' 1,500 times in a row," he said. "That should teach 'em." 
Father Tepid Huddleburger, pres­ident of the University of Never Doom, expressed dismay over the announcement. "With Prince over at SMC, how are we ever going to get students over here for Engineering Auditorium movies?" he questioned. "Huddleburger is just scared," said Prince. "He knows I'm just biding time before starting a revolt that will overthrow him and install Sheila E. as president over there." 
Huddleburger denied reports that he has been in contact with singer/actor Morris Day, in an effort to recruit him into a high-ranking position with Never Doom. "That simply is not the case," said Hud­dleburger. "Why, I don't even like the man's music. In fact, I can't even dance. And not only that, I don't even listen to· the radio. And besides, I don't even own one. And on top of that, I'm never here. 

Ethanol Plant reeks havoc

today decided to investigate claims that the odor emanating from the city's new ethanol plant is reeking havoc in the community. 
According to Health Director Bar­ney "Stinky" Stenchson, citizens have been complaining of dizziness, nausea and even impotence as a result of the odor. "When they opened up the plant they told us the smell would go away in a few days because it was caused by some 'darn kids with a stinkbomb.' Silly us, we believed them," he said. 

"Then, when the odor continued, we went back and asked them about it again," he explained. "And, do you know what? Those darn kids were back again." 
Dame junior Y.U. Lookinatme. "This morning it got all over my socks. I tried washing it off, but they really stunk. P.U." 
Saint Mary's sophomore I.M. Hungry said it has affected her appe­tite. "I can't explain it. Every time I smell the ethanol I just want to go out and eat a gallc;m of Haagen-Dazs ice cream. You can see what it has done for my figure," she said. "I think I may sue the plant owners for $200,000. That's exactly the cost of a truckful ofpopsicles." 
The ethanol plant manager, Myron Weaselface, said yesterday that the problem has been cor­rected. "We have purchased 1,000 cases of Old Spice Stick Deodorant to be used by our workers," he said. 


Sexual domination at issue in Neuter Dream admissions 
Editor's Note: This is part 69 in an indefinite series of articles sizing up the issue of sex domination at Neuter Dream and Sore Mouths. Today's article will peek behind the scenes and doors on both campuses. Tomor­row's article may have nofocus. 
By SEXUAL 
StaffInjection 
In an affirmative action move, 

the Bored of Mistrustees ofNeuter 
Dream have decided to stop admit­
ting men to the University. 
"I can't fight this feeling any longer. Men have dominated this school for more than a century, and frankly, I'm fed up with it," University President Father Tad Hasbeen said in -a closed-door in­terview yesterday. 
"They can't produce a winning football team, they can't hold their liquor, and these days they can't even win a wet willy contest. Besides, I'm sick and tired of the ratio," he added. 
When the change was an­nounced, the Neuter Dame male population didn't just lie back and take it. Studt"nts hung protest sheets from dorm windows, and some went so far as to organize a food fight in the South Dining Hall. 
Hasbeen, however, calmed the uproar by promising all Neuter Dame males that they would be given a chance to buy season foot­ball tickets next year and would be issued discount subscriptions to Spurts Illuminated magazine. 
Hasbeen said he wasn't surprised at the relatively easy time he had calming the protest. "After all, it never has taken much to pacify us Neuter Dream boys." 
Not everyone has taken the change so well. Former Neuter Dream Student Body President­elect Chill Freely said, "I can't believe it. For years, Neuter Dream was the bastion ofmale supremacy then along came a woman and it's all just a beautiful dream." 

Freely said he plans to continue his political career at Sore Mouth's. "At first it was a grave disappoint-

ment, being dethroned -I mean thrown out of office and all. However, I've now seen the light and decided to join the Pullman generation." 
Although the male protest quickly dribbled down to nothing, hundreds of angry women stormed the administration build­ing refusing to move to Pangborn or Fisher. 
Although women eventually will be housed in all of the men's dorms on campus, the changeover could take months. "I wouldn't house my dog in most of those dorms," said Hasbeen. "They didn't call Carroll the vermin for nothing.'' 
Father Davehad Myson, vice president for student affairs, is working with the Environmental Protection Agency to prepare for the male-free campus. He said it could take months to make the men's dorms habitable. 
"Despite accusations by the EPA, we maintain that the odor hanging over South Bend emanates from the Ethanol Plant, not Dil­lon," Myson said. 
Neuter Dame men will not be left out in the cold. Sore Mouths 
new president, Prince, announced 
yesterday that Dreamer men will 
always be welcome at Sore Mouths 
College. "We're rolling out our red 
corvette and spreading our gates · wide open for them." 
Many girls from Sore Mouths ex­
pressed ecstasy over the new 
policy. "I'm so excited, I just can't 
hide it. I think it's a super idea," 
said one LeManless resident. "It is 
about time Neuter Dream men 
realized there are women over 
here. We can chow down as much 
ice cream as any Walsh girl." 
The more militantly feminine 
students at Neuter Dream also 
were pleased as punch with the 
policy change. Gloria Van Dyke, 
president of the Prancin' Irish, 
voiced her thrill, "For Neuter 
Dream, it's a hard habit to break, 
but it's time people realized who 
wears the pants at this university."

In response to Wobber tino's column of today, I'd like to complain. Wobber hasn't done half those things. I did tern all. 
Shoore, Wobber tino wants all da credit, but ol'm da one whose made student government what it is today.

DearEdiot: 

I am responding to the above letters, but not the column. It speaks for itself. My advice to tino is start looking for a job. I'm in charge here. 
I just wana have power. Tino better give it to me. I won't wait much longer. Tino, you better ask yourself-Do you feel lucky? 
Tino thinks he's a big man on campus, but I am a rock. I touch no one and no one touches me. 
In fact, I am the world. I'm too good to be true. Can't take my eyes off of me. I'm like the Dome above...and tino better beat it... it doesn't matter whose wrong or right, just beat 
it. As for Apathy, she can go drown herselfin a

Where have you gone Joanie Caill? Our campus turns it lonely eyes to you. 
Well, we're not going a take it. No, we ain't gonna take it. We're not gonna take it anymore. 
I'm leaving on a jet plane. Don't know when I'll be back again. You're not going to have Pattie Brown to kick around anymore. 
Pattie Brown Should've been, but now a hasbeen 
Whose a hasbeen? 

DearEditor: 
Speaking of hasbeens, I am wnung in response to Mark Beenahasbeen's May 23 column, "Ducksjust Wanna Have Fun." I must disagree with his claim that slickers offer the best rain protection on this soggy campus. Slickers are downright dangerous and they in­fringe on other people's rights. You cannot see to your right or left because of the hood and could easily get run down by an over­zealous, passing groundscrew member. It is also as difficult to hold a conversation with a 
slicker wearer as with a Walkman user. This is just plain rude. I think the administration should come up with a Rain Policy requiring the use of umbrellas to protect us all from these problems.

Flasher goes too far 

DearEditor: 
I would like to respond to the Flasher's let­ter of this same page. I have to protest the in­volvment of the administration in this matter. It is bad enough that they are making us drink milk and eat veggies at every meal, but having to give up my raincroat would really stick in my craw. In my opinion it is umbrellas that cause all the problems on this waterlogged campus. They crowd people off the sidewalks and could very easily poke someone in the nose, causing a suit to be taken against the user or the university. They also have a very nasty tendancy to drip all over everything. Bethideth, raincoath are nith and colorful and I love the thmell and feel of the wet rubber againtht my thkin. It remindth me of the good old dayth with :ill the boyth in Akron.

Hi. Hello. Howdy. How you doin'? 
Hello, again. 

Hello again, everybody. 
Well folks, this is going to be some kind ofcolumn, because I came 
to write, and you came to read. 'Ibc !wish are somewhere in be­
tween really great and really bad, but I can't make up my mind 
which, and I really don't want to say because then I would take a 
stand. So, let it be said that they are doing something dreadfully 
wrong, and we've got to do something about it. 
Now let me see ifl can find another cliche to write in here because 
that will really make this some kind of column, and, after all, you 
came to read and I came to write. Ofcourse, I already knqw that, but 
I'm telling you because I figure you don't know it and I should tell 
you about it even ifit's irrelevant to the topic I'm discussing. 
Speaking ofirrelevant topics, did you notice what a long sentence 
that last one was? I like using long sentences because they use lots of 
polysyllabic words that really make me look like I know what I'm 
talking about, and that makes you respect me even more than the 
rest ofthe clowns on the sports staff that don't know anything. Speak­
ing oflong sentences, wasn't that a good one? 
Well anyway, back to the topic, which I really haven't started dis­
cussing yet, but what the heck, I've got to fill up all this space on this 
side of the page, so I might as well throw in another sentence which 
doesn't pertain to anything but takes up a few more lines of space. 
And wasn't that a nice, long sentence? 
Let's get back to the topic, which is cliches. Who better to write about them than me? I like to use a plethora of them, a veritable bevy of them, and a lot of them, too. I can say that Yelps "couldn't stop a jumper that brought rain because he closed the barn door after the horse was gone, and now his defense is going to have to be on those guys like bees on honey." Basically, I have said absolutely nothing, but it took up a lot ofspace and made a nice long sentence. 
Cliches. 'Jbey'rc wrong. He's wrong. She's wrong. Everybody's wrong, except me. Because I'm never wrong. How could I he wrong? I write for this paper, and we're never wrong. It's wrong to think that i'm.wrong. Yes, it's wrong. 
Well, goodbye. So long. Sayonara. Auf Wicderschn. Au Revoir. 
Adios. See you later, alligator. In a while, crocodile. 
Again. 
Everybody. 

Pick of the Week .. This is actually a meaningless sports event 
that no one in their right mind would go to, but I fi~'Ure you've read 
this much of my column, so how could you possibly be in your right 
mind? This week I suggest you go out toJack Klunk Field and watch grass grow. It should be really excitingfor you, but don't look for me to be there because it really doesn't matter to me. Furthermore, you really don't matter to me either, and that's why I keep sending·you to these stupid thinw;.

Yelps joins convent 
Neuter Dream basketball coach Bigger Yelps finally fulfilled a lifelong ambition last night when he secretly escaped to a Laporte con­vent and became a nun. 
"It's something I've always wanted to do," said Yelps at a hastily called press conference. "There was something inside of me that kept saying, 'nun, nun, nun,' so I became one." 
Yelps has yet to decide if he will leave the University, but cited his re­lationship with local snortscaster Jerk Piano and the South Bend nightlife as factors influencing him to stay on. Coach Bigger Yelps

sistent problem was the offense's in­ability to hang on to the football, as they lost control ofit seven times. 

Hopefully, the Irish can eliminate the mistakes without sacrificing the intensity displayed on the field Sat­urday. 
"The offense really came off the ball well, and the defense pursued well," noted Faust. "The defense was also quick reacting to the ball, and I thought they did some gang tack­ling." 
Faust was pleased also with the play ofNotre Dame's three freshmen quarterbacks, Andrysiak, Byrne, and Pat Pesavento. All three contestants for the No.2 quarterb~ck spot played well, Andrysiak completing three of his five passing attempts for 48 yards, and the 6-4 Byrne hitting two ofsix for 29 yards. · Two other key positions for the 
Irish going into the scrimmage were the fullback and tight-end slots. At fullback, 6-4 freshman Frank Starns, 5-10 junior Tom Monahan and 5-11 sophomore Pernell Taylor all per­formed well. Converted safeties Jim Bobb and Mike Visovatti also carried the ball from the position. Starns scored twice from the goal-line of­fense, Monahan banged out 34 yards on 12 carries and Taylor carried the 
ball seven times for 35 yards. 
At tight end, meanwhile, con­

verted defensive tackle Tom Rehder 
was impressive blocking, while 
sophomore Joel Williams and fresh­
man David Earhart also played well 
at the position. 

The Irish coaches will get the chance to see more at the practices today and tomorrow, before the next scrimmage on Wednesday. 
Hopefully for Faust, that 

scrimmage on Wednesday will be as 
hard-hitting as the scrimmage on 
Saturday. Then his Notre Dame foot­
ball team would really be sitting 
pretty.

Though you couldn't tell from the

the Notre Dame track team did very 
well in the Notre Dame Invitational 
on Monogram Track at Cartier Field 
on Saturday. Since this was a non­
scoring meet, there was no combined score for each team com­peting. This type of format was per­fect for his team, according to Irish head coach joe Plane. 
"People don't understand the reasons for a non-scoring meet," ex­plained Plane. "They always ask if you won or lost. '!bey don't under­stand the concept. People forget that the Olympics is a non-scoring meet. 
"It enables us to run more guys in 
some events. Also, the format allows 
us to experiment by having guys

winds, three Irish golfers recorded scores in the 70's for Saturday's match. 
O'Donovan led the field with a remarkable round of 74, while Fuh­rer was just one stroke back with a 7'). Huffman was the third Irish gol­fer under 80 with a score of 79. 
Irish head coach Noel O'Sullivan 
said he was quite pleased with his 
team's performance. Although he had hoped for a course record this weekend, O'Sullivan conceded that the playing conditions made a course record virtually impossible. 
"Our consistency this weekend, especially under such adverse con­ditions, was brilliant," said O'Sullivan. 
Notre Dame's low scores would 
surely have been lower were it not 
for such terrible conditions. Accor­
ding to O'Donovan, this weekend's 
weather was "the worst two days in 
a row I've played." 
The Irish were disappointed that they didn't have better conditions to go after the course record, but with­out a single senior, this team can only get better.
