Roll Call honors fallen heroes

NDSP investigates purse theft

Notre Dame holds Veteran’s Day memorial to remember lost servicemen and women


By ANNA BOARINI
News Writer
Notre Dame joined more than 170 colleges and universities na­tionwide on Friday to simultane­ously take part in the National Roll Call, honoring servicemen and women who died in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan since Sept. 11, 2001.
Capt. Clarence Earl Carter, professor of naval sciences, said he was honored to take part in the memorial. 
“The flag that we have and the country we have exist because of the service of those who were in uniform before us dating back to the American Revolution,” Cart­er said. “God willing, we will continue to have young men and women make the commitment to stand watch on our great coun­try. I’m grateful to have my own chance to stand the watch.”
Notre Dame’s Veteran’s Day memorial started at 4 p.m. Thursday when Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) cadets and midshipmen began stand­ing watch over the Clarke Me­morial Fountain, better known as “Stonehenge,” for 24 hours, honoring those who served be­fore them.
Members of the Notre Dame and South Bend communities gathered around the fountain at 8:30 a.m. Friday to honor those who lost their lives in the armed forces. 
The names of about 6,300 American servicemen and wom­en killed were read by 62 mem­bers of the Notre Dame commu­nity, 31 of whom were members of the University’s Navy, Army and Air Force ROTC units. The list would take nearly eight hours to read.
At 2 p.m. Friday, a nationwide minute of silence was observed.
University President Emeritus Fr. Theodore Hesburgh spoke at a memorial service Friday eve­ning and said he considers the ROTC cadets and midshipmen at Notre Dame the “best of the best.”
“No group here at Notre Dame fills me with greater pride than the group that stands here be­fore me,” Hesburgh said. “There is no way on earth that I can thank you for your dedication to God and Country.”
One of his proudest accom­plishments as president of the University, Hesburgh said, was overseeing the building of the War Memorial.
Hesburgh said he is proud of what these cadets and midship­men are doing for the United States.
“All I can say is you come from a great tradition,” he said. “I am so proud of all of you and what you are doing with your lives that I have a hard time keeping the tears back.”
John Hargrove, a Notre Dame alumnus and Vietnam War vet­eran, was visiting the area and came to campus to remember his friends.
“I lost a few friends and class­mates in Vietnam and I wanted to come today to pay my re­spects,” he said. 
Former Indiana Governor and 1968 Notre Dame gradu­ate Joe Kernan said he was honored to speak on campus on Veteran’s Day. Kernan is a vet­eran of the Vietnam War and spent 11 months as a prisoner of war after his plane was shot down over North Vietnam.
“This is a day of remembering and reflecting,” he said. “I think all of us in this time reflect upon members of our family.”
Kernan said his father, grandfather and uncles all served in the armed forces and that is he does not reflect on his own service on Veteran’s Day, but rather the service of family members.
“I don’t think about it as it pertains to me, I think about how it pertains to my friends and family who served,” he said. “I think about my friends and colleagues who didn’t come home. It’s like Memorial Day, time to think about them.”
Kernan told the story of three different servicemen: John Her­ringer Jr., Robin Yackley and Mike McCormick, who were all killed in service and missing in action.
Their remains were eventu­ally recovered by the United States Armed Forces, Kernan said. Herringer was killed dur­ing World War II and both Yack­ley and McCormick lost their lives in Vietnam, he said.
“The reason that they came home is because our govern­ment cares,” Kernan said. “Our military cares, and not only cares, but is willing to make the commitment to do what­ever is necessary to make sure our men and women come back home. To not leave anyone on the field, to not let them be for­gotten.”

Students cheer Irish on to victory at FedEx Field

By MARISA IATI
News Writer
While the Irish “home” game in Maryland this weekend was not technically at home, many fans said it still felt that way.
Junior Sam Mitchell said the high number of Irish fans present at Notre Dame’s 45-21 win against the University of Maryland on Saturday made the atmosphere at FedEx Field electric.
“You’re taking a metro and stuff there, and it was all Notre Dame people,” he said. “There was a huge contingency of peo­ple around the stadium, a lot of energy, a lot of alumni there, too. You almost felt like it was a home game. Obviously, it was [technically] a home game, and it showed.”
Junior Joe Beglane said there were many more Irish fans at the game than Terrapins fans and he said the jumbotron in the stadium showed highlights from Notre Dame games earlier this season.
“It was surprisingly pro-Notre Dame over there,” Be­glane said.
Junior Matt Gilbert said he enjoyed that there was so much support for Notre Dame.
“There was a big Irish pres­ence, and it was really good to have such a contingent there from Notre Dame,” he said.
Junior Mike Dobrovic said Saturday’s game was compara­ble to last year’s game against Army at Yankee Stadium be­cause both games were played in neutral territory. 
“Both games had great en­ergy, and the team wearing the green jerseys pumps people up a lot,” he said. “It probably wasn’t as special as Yankee Stadium, though, because that was sort of a special event, it being in a baseball stadium.”
Mitchell said he was pleased with the final score.  
“We killed them,” he said. “We just dominated the entire time. It was really great to see Notre Dame beating the teams that we should be beating and doing it with some swagger.”
Beglane said said he was also happy with how the Irish played Saturday.
“The football was great,” he said. “I’m always kind of wor­ried with us, but it was defi­nitely a strong showing. It’s kind of nice to have a game where you’re not freaking out the whole time.”
Gilbert agreed.
“It was good to see them come out with such a convincing win, and they definitely had the sup­port of the fans,” he said. 
Gilbert said the festivities surrounding the game extend­ed outside of Landover, Md., where FedEx Field is located. There were many tailgates outside of FedEx Field, and the Band of the Fighting Irish performed on the steps of the United States Capitol in Wash­ington, D.C. 
“We were up in Baltimore over the weekend, and there were Irish fans there as well,” Gilbert said.

Tournament, rally promote peace in South Sudan


By MEL FLANAGAN
News Writer
Playing for Peace continued its efforts to promote peace in South Sudan at the second an­nual basketball tournament and Peace & Pep Rally held be­fore the men’s basketball sea­son opener against Mississippi Valley State on Saturday.
The rally, which emphasized the continued need for assis­tance in Sudan, took place fol­lowing two basketball tour­naments — a three-on-three student tournament and a youth tournament for South Bend community members.
Last year’s rally and tourna­ment were the opening events of the Playing for Peace initiative.
Social concerns chair, junior Ellen Carroll, said this year’s rally shows Notre Dame’s con­tinued support of the people of Sudan. 
“Last year our Playing for Peace tournament and our Stand with Sudan rally was the largest advocacy event for a peaceful referendum in Sudan of any school in America,” she said. “This year we gather to­gether again to show we’re stay­ing with the people of Sudan.”
The rally occurred at a criti­cal time for the country of Su­dan, Carroll said. United States senators will debate cutting the international aid budget Mon­day and Tuesday, a move that could greatly affect South Su­dan.
Many students signed a peti­tion to President Obama, asking him to continue to support the Sudanese people as they rebuild their nation.
Although they could not be present due to the game that followed the rally, men’s bas­ketball players Tim Abromai­tis and Joey Brooks opened the rally with a prayer.
“Join our voices with their voices and our hearts with their hearts in a plea for peace,” Abromaitis and Brooks said in unison.
During the rally, Carroll played a video update from Catholic Relief Services on the situation in Sudan. In the video, Bishop Eduardo Hiiboro Kus­sala of the Dio­cese of Tom­bura-Yambio in South Su­dan described the precarious state of the country.
“We do not want a return to war,” Kus­sala said. “We are at a frag­ile first stage. We need your prayers, we need your voice, not only before God but before your government officials.”
Ring Agwick, a University employee who emigrated from South Sudan to South Bend, also spoke to students and thanked them for their continued sup­port.
Agwick said the Sudanese people would be touched to wit­ness a crowd speaking out on their behalf.
“If not for you guys and your country, there wouldn’t be no country called South Sudan to­day,” he said. “We’re really for­tunate for what you have been doing.”
Kevin Dugan, manager of youth and community programs for the athletic department, said the tournament and rally were intended as a follow-up to last year’s Playing for Peace events.
Dugan said the purpose of the day was to update the students on recent Playing for Peace events, such as Dugan’s sum­mer trip to Sudan, and also to call attention to the current sit­uation in the country.
“South Sudan is now a free and independent country but there’s a tremendous amount of violence taking place along the borders,” he said. “We want to make everyone aware that we need to stay with Sudan.”
The men’s lacrosse team, who helped spearhead the initial Playing for Peace tour­nament and rally, has continued to be in­volved with this year’s events. Freshman lacrosse player John Scioscia said the initiative is a great way for the entire campus, as well as the South Bend commu­nity, to develop connections.
“I think it raises great aware­ness through a sport,” he said. “Bringing people together to play a sport raises teamwork. Everyone works together and it supports great ideas that are the exact opposite of war.”
Carroll said Playing for Peace has already begun planning events for the spring, including a lacrosse tournament and a basketball tournament for com­munity members that will take place at the Martin Luther King Center in South Bend.
“The tagline this year is ‘From South Bend to South Sudan’ so that’s the goal, to keep holding events that help both Sudan and our community,” she said.

Cat perches on Arizona cactus for three days
SAGUARO LAKE, Ariz. — A lot of cats get stuck in trees, but an Arizona kitty was perched atop a giant saguaro cactus for at least three days before finally coming down on its own.
Residents living in a desert area northeast of Phoenix noticed the black cat with white patches at the very top of the 30- to 40-foot cactus.
At times, the feline would stand up and sur­vey the area, possibly try­ing to figure out how to get down ­­— or how it got up there.
Helicopter video from ABC15.com shows the cat eventually climbing down the cactus Friday. It start­ed making its way down head-first before turn­ing around and scooting backward. It finally took a big leap and landed on its feet before wandering into the desert.
NY governor’s quote made into a ringtone
ALBANY, N.Y. — A re­cent soundbite from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo that’s become a hit on Twittter is getting extra mileage as a ringtone.
In a radio interview Wednesday, the Demo­cratic governor said, “I am the government.”
His comment quickly made the rounds on Twit­ter, a ringtone was set up, and Thursday’s New York Daily News pictured Cuo­mo in a wig as France’s Louis XIV, who famously said, “I am the state.”
Cuomo didn’t appear to be boasting, however, in his comment on WGDJ-AM in Albany. He was explain­ing how his poll numbers reflect New Yorkers’ re­newed faith and confi­dence in government.
Cuomo quickly added that he was referring just to the executive branch of state government.
His office didn’t imme­diately respond to a re­quest for comment Thurs­day.

Students ‘dance in the moonlight’ at club formal

By NICOLE TOCZAUER
News Writer
Stars, confetti and navy blue curtains brought back an old-school style at “Dancing in the Moonlight,” the first co-spon­sored formal held by Ballroom Dance Club and Swing Club.
The dance took place Friday night in the Stepan Center. 
Junior Allison Kincaid, co-president of Swing Club, said the night was a success for both clubs.
“We not only had over 100 people but everyone was dancing and enjoying the night up until the very end. The food was deli­cious, the DJ was fun, and every­one looked fabulous dressed up in formal wear,” she said. “I’m definitely glad that we were able to do the confetti drop at 11:11:11. It was definitely a starry night under the moon.”
Kincaid said the night allowed club members and non-members to meet new people.
“What is awesome about these kind of events is that it encourag­es people to branch out, at least that’s the nature of Swing,” she said. “I definitely met some new and fun people and had a great time dancing with them!”
Junior Joshua Gaston, Swing Club treasurer, said the event also allowed dancers to improve their style, though there was no formal lesson.
“That was one of the purposes of this dance: to expand people’s views of dance and invite them to explore further,” he said. “Plus, people just straight up improved.  The best example was when I led a samba line for a whole song without knowing how to Samba.”
Gaston said the groundwork for “Dancing in the Moonlight” was laid last year with the debut of their first swing formal. 
“The event last year was such a success that it wasn’t a question that another formal would hap­pen this year,” he said. “More­over, the Swing and Ballroom clubs at the end of last year de­cided to make a more conscious effort to co-exist as two clubs which catered to the same audi­ence.”
Gaston said that after Activities Night, the two clubs met with the Student Activities Office, gath­ered decorations and found a DJ.
“There were calls to SAO, long chats between club officers … last minute panicking, etc, etc,” he said.
Juniors Emily Palid and Mike Marszowski, co-presidents of Ballroom Dance Club, said the officers from both clubs made a huge effort to make the night a success.
“Josh Gaston deserves special thanks for coordinating between the two clubs and heading up the event,” Marszowski said. “We’d also love the thank our set up crew, especially Jen Martynow­icz, Emily Palid and Paul Minu­tolo.”
Gaston said the Swing Club also wanted to recognize senior Andy Fotsch for his contributions, as well as the clean up crew. 
“Confetti was awesome, but time consuming to clean up,” he said.
Palid, Marszowski and Gaston said they agreed the wide vari­ety of styles in swing, classical ballroom and Latin dance meant there was something for every­one to enjoy.
“The styles of ballroom and swing allow people to do so much more than just sway back and forth,” Gaston said.  “Whether it’s a beautiful waltz, a dramatic tango,or a jaw dropping lindy, these allow people to expand their dancing to more music than ever thought possible.”
The club officers said there were many opportunities for stu­dents interested in learning more about the two styles of dance. Both clubs’ representatives said they hold weekly lessons and sponsor other events as well.
“In the past we’ve had the Swing-a-thon in order to raise money for charity. At Legends there’s also ‘Swing Night’ at least once, sometimes twice, a semes­ter,” Kincaid said. “Furthermore, we offer trips outside the South Bend area. It gives our club members a chance to see what the Swing Scene is like in other places, learn new styles and meet new and awesome people.”
Kincaid said the two clubs of­fered students social interaction and the opportunity to learn ba­sic dancing skills. 
“Mixing good dance moves, music and people together al­ways creates something unique,” she said. “We provide a casual, fun atmosphere for people to take a break from studies and learn how to move their feet.”

Notre Dame’s Handbell Choir plays wide range of music

By MARISA IATI
News Writer
Thursday evenings on the third floor of the Coleman-Morse Cen­ter, members of the Notre Dame Handbell Choir can be found me­ticulously perfecting their craft in preparation for their nine perfor­mances this semester. 
The choir plays at various lit­urgies at the Basilica of the Sa­cred Heart and also performs in concert, Director Karen Schnei­der Kirner said. The ensemble is part of Campus Ministry and was founded in 1988.
“Primarily, we assist with music at the Basilica, so we want to help raise people’s hearts to God by our music, to help enhance the whole worship experience for people who come to liturgies,” Kirner said.
The Handbell Choir performed classical and sacred music as well as pop pieces Saturday at Wash­ington Hall. 
“It’s kind of a culmination of both the classical and sacred rep­ertoire we’ve worked on since the beginning of the semester, but it [included] some pieces from [our] new CD,” Kirner said. 
She said the choir released its fourth CD, “O Holy Night,” earlier this month. 
“There are five pieces that in­clude the Celebration Choir, which I also direct,” she said. “It’s music for both Advent and Christmas. So it’s something you can put on and play for your family on Christmas Eve or while eating Christmas din­ner.”
Approximately 16 students play five octaves of bells, Kirner said. 
“Each ringer is responsible for two diatonic notes, so, for exam­ple, a C and a D, and any sharps and flats that correspond to those notes,” she said. “The music looks very much like piano music. [The ringers] mostly focus on [the lines of music corresponding to their notes] as the music goes on, and you have got to count like crazy.”
Kirner said the teamwork is re­quired for every piece. 
“One thing that is kind of amaz­ing is to get so many people to­gether to play one piece and give it coherence,” she said. “It would be like having one piano piece and having 16 people try to play it and make it seem like one piece of mu­sic.”
Handbell Choir president, soph­omore Michael Vella, agreed the level of teamwork necessary to play bells is unique. 
“Everybody works together as a team to make the music … every single member of the choir needs to master their part to succeed,” he said. “Playing bells is easy in a way. All you really need to be able to do is to read music. But at the same time, it takes years to master how to make the tone of the bell sound exactly how it should.”
Fifth year senior and choir member Chris Collins said the visual aspect of a handbell per­formance greatly enhances the experience.
“You get to see us ringing and switching bells,” he said. “Not only do you get to hear the song, you get to see it, too. People are always surprised by the different sounds that handbell techniques can create. Seeing and hearing people’s surprise … is one of the most rewarding parts of our per­formances.”
Sophomore Angelica Martinez said she was inspired to continue learning how to play the handbells when she came to Notre Dame.
“I started playing handbells my junior year of high school, but it was only for a year because there was not enough interest at my high school, so when I found out that Notre Dame had a hand­bell choir, I was really excited,” she said. “I remember in middle school watching my sister’s hand­bell choir perform … it sounded so magical, words cannot describe.”

U.S. supports plan to form Pacific free trade bloc

Associated Press
KAPOLEI, Hawaii — A U.S.-backed plan to forge a Pacific free trade bloc got a big boost Sunday when leaders of Canada and Mexico joined Japan in ex­pressing support for a deal that has received a cool reception from China, the region’s rising power.
The news was a coup for Pres­ident Barack Obama, who made progress on the pact one of his top priorities for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit being held in his home state of Hawaii. It comes after Japan, the world’s third-biggest econo­my, said Friday that it wants to join the nine nations already in­volved in talks on what has been dubbed the Trans-Pacific Part­nership.
The balmy weather for the an­nual APEC gathering at a resort on the west side of the Hawaiian island of Oahu contrasted with deepening pessimism over the economic outlook as the lead­ers sat down for a day of talks on how to spur growth and cre­ate jobs. With Europe again on the brink of recession, Asia’s vital role as a driver of global growth has gained even greater urgency.
IMF Director Christine La­garde attended the summit, briefing the APEC leaders on the latest developments in Europe. The International Monetary Fund will play a key role in com­ing months in overseeing efforts by Italy, and other ailing econo­mies that use the euro common currency, to rein in debt.
Europe’s quandary is among the wide range of issues that the Asia-Pacific leaders were tack­ling in their one-day meeting.
“Now it’s time to get down to work, and we have much to do,” Obama said in opening the sum­mit. “Our 21 economies — our nearly 3 billion citizens — are looking to us to bring our econo­mies closer, to increase exports, to expand trade and opportunity that creates jobs and economic growth. That’s why we’re here.”
Canadian Prime Minister Ste­phen Harper said his country must look to the East to ensure markets, especially for its ener­gy exports. “That will be an im­portant priority of this govern­ment going forward,” Harper said before meeting with Obama on the sidelines of the 21-mem­ber APEC summit.
The U.S. Trade Representative, Ron Kirk, welcomed the over­tures from Canada and Mexico about joining the so called TPP, issuing a statement calling them America’s “neighbors and larg­est export markets.”
But China, which some econo­mists say is on course to over­take the U.S. as the world’s big­gest economy this decade, has appeared reluctant to endorse the Pacific trade pact, likely wary of being drawn into what has become a U.S.-led initia­tive that encroaches on its own sphere of influence in Asia. Chi­na also has commitments to ri­val free trade blocs in East and Southeast Asia.
The TPP group now includes only four smaller, relatively af­fluent economies — Chile, New Zealand, Brunei and Singapore — but the U.S., Australia, Ma­laysia, Vietnam and Peru are negotiating to join.
U.S. officials have said all are welcome to come on board, while indicating that the agree­ment’s high standards would pose a challenge to countries whose economies are not fully open. That would likely include Russia, which is close to gain­ing long-sought membership of the World Trade Organization, and China, which has staked out large sections of its economy for protection from foreign competi­tion.
Obama has said he is optimis­tic that work on the American-backed trade pact could result in a legal framework by next year.
For the U.S., the initiative is seen as a way to break through bottlenecks and open new busi­ness opportunities. Many in APEC see the emerging deal as a building block for a free trade area that eventually encom­passes all of Asia and the Pacific — covering half  of the world’s commerce and two-fifths of its trade.

Feds use drones to secure border

Northwest region adapts from Cold War economy

Associated Press
CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas — Two Border Patrol agents walked by a patch of brush on a remote ranch and saw noth­ing. But 19,000 feet overhead in the night sky, a Predator unmanned aircraft kept its heat-sensing eye on the spot.
In an operations center about 80 miles away, all eyes were on a suspicious dark cluster on a video screen. Moments later, the drone operators triggered the craft’s infrared beam and pointed the agents directly to the undergrowth where two silent figures were hiding.
Last week’s mission was just another night out for a Preda­tor program that is playing a larger role in the nation’s bor­der security as the U.S. Cus­toms and Border Protection adds to its force of unmanned aircraft. The agency received its second Predator B aircraft in Texas last month and will add its sixth overall on the Southwest border when anoth­er is based in Arizona by the end of the year.
The aircraft are credited with apprehending more than 7,500 people since they were deployed six years ago. They bring the latest in military technology to one of the old­est cat-and-mouse pursuits in the country. But on the bor­der, even sophisticated devices struggle with the weather and conditions — just as humans do.
“I’m trying to mark. I’m looking for a hole in the clouds,” said an exasperated operator as he lost his video image of a “hotspot” in a stand of trees. Cloud cover, along with crosswinds and rain, are the drones’ enemies.
The aircraft can remain airborne for 30 hours though missions typically run eight or nine hours with the ground crews rotating in the control trailers. Smugglers of hu­mans, drugs and guns are the chief prey.
The Predators, which were being used in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, were intro­duced on the border in 2005, the year before Mexican Presi­dent Felipe Calderon declared war on his country’s drug gangs and violence along the border exploded. Since then, the aircraft have logged more than 10,000 flight hours and aided in intercepting 46,600 pounds of illegal drugs.
“It’s like any other law en­forcement platform,” said Lo­thar Eckardt, director of the Office of Air and Marine’s Predator operation housed at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi. “No different than a helicopter.”
A Predator system — the plane, sensors, control con­soles and antennas — costs $18.5 million. The craft’s 66-foot wingspan stretches out from a relatively small body supported by spindly landing gear, making them appear almost insect-like. A single propeller powers them from behind, allowing for relatively quiet flights.
Inside the ground control trailer, a pilot and sensor op­erator sit side by side at con­soles that include four screens each, a joystick, keyboard, several levers and rudder ped­als. The pilot does the flying. The sensor operator works the infrared equipment and oth­er technology under the air­craft’s nose.
Some question whether the remotely-piloted aircrafts’ im­pact justifies the price.
“The big knock on the UAS (unmanned aircraft systems) program ... is that it’s so ex­pensive,” said T.J. Bonner, former president of the Na­tional Border Patrol Council, the agents’ union. He said the money would be better spent on more boots on the ground and manned aircraft.
The Predator’s touchiest missions are those that take it across the border into Mexico. A 2008 U.S. diplomatic cable posted by Wikileaks described a meeting between then Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and several members of Mexico’s national security cabinet in which Mex­ican officials appeared to en­thusiastically endorse the idea of surveillance flights. But publicly Mexican officials have been loath to speak about any­thing that could be perceived as impinging on the nation’s sovereignty. In March, Mexi­can officials defended allow­ing U.S. surveillance flights and said a Mexican official was always present in the con­trol room.
The Predator program now has one continuous patrolling zone from the Texas-Louisiana line, down the Gulf coast and up the border to El Centro, Ca­lif.

YAKIMA, Washington — In a remote pocket of the inland Pacific Northwest, World War II weapons production and stor­age built a booming economy that continued through the Cold War. The region flourished even as efforts shifted toward clean­up and disposal of chemical agents and radioactive waste.
Today, the rockets and mus­tard agent are gone from north­east Oregon’s Umatilla Chemi­cal Depot. Across the Columbia River in southeast Washington state, work to rid the highly contaminated Hanford nuclear reservation of pollutants will continue for decades, but feder­al stimulus dollars spurred the completion of some projects and more completions are expected in months to come.
The success of those efforts means thousands of job losses in communities that shined through the economic down­turn and a major shift for a re­gion long fueled by federal dol­lars.
Fred Kremmer, 49, of Rich­land, Washington, worked at Hanford for nearly 10 years. There were layoffs, but new jobs always followed — until he was let go again in September.
“I would hope to go back, but I doubt there will be work for me there again. That’s my gut feel­ing,” he said.
At the height of World War II, the federal government en­listed 50,000 people for a hush-hush project to build the atomic bomb, making a remote stretch of land Washington state’s fourth-largest city. The Hanford site went on to produce plutoni­um for the U.S. nuclear weapons arsenal for decades, employing thousands of people and estab­lishing the area as a science and technology center.
Work shifted to cleaning up the highly contaminated site in the 1990s. The number of employees there has averaged about 10,000 for several years, but 2,000 workers have been laid off in recent months as work was completed with $1.96 billion from the federal stimu­lus bill.
Work to empty underground tanks of radioactive waste and to glassify that waste will con­tinue for decades at Hanford, but more layoffs are expected next year and beyond, as other cleanup projects get completed and federal cleanup dollars de­cline.
Across the river, storage for rockets, ammunition and other military supplies was whittled out of 30 square miles (78 square kilometers) of sage­brush several hours drive east of Portland, Oregon. Eventu­ally, the U.S. Army began stor­ing chemical weapons there in partly-buried earthen bunkers, referred to as “igloos.”
The Umatilla depot once stored 12 percent of the United States’ chemical weapons, in­cluding deadly VX nerve agent and blistering mustard agent.

Have a little faith

Inside Column

Thanks 
and giving

It seems now-a-days, everywhere we turn we see or hear of suffer­ing and evil. I am filled with disgust and anger as I read the grand jury’s report of the Penn State scandal. I am confused and hurt when my friends and family face hardships that seem unfair.
How could an all-loving God allow these things to happen? 
I don’t pretend to have an answer for Mackie’s Problem of Evil, nor do I know how to reconcile humans be­ings’ free will and God’s omniscience (after all, philosophers and theolo­gians much smarter than I have de­bated these for decades, to no avail). 
However, in the risk of sound­ing cliché, I am a firm believer that everything happens for a reason. Our God is not one of randomness and indifference; he has a plan for each of us, and the purpose we serve is one greater than we can wrap our minds around. 
As a high school senior, I had a 3.9 GPA, was VP of many important ex­tracurricular clubs and volunteered in community service regularly. As an entirely too prideful person who rarely failed at anything, I applied to only Ivy League colleges and “reach schools” (my academic counselor was not pleased). 
Imagine my surprise when I re­ceived one wait-list letter after another. UPenn was my dream school, with the  No. 1 undergraduate busi­ness program in the nation, and they flat out turned me down. I was humiliated, confounded and angry. “Why God,” I asked, “what did I do to deserve this? Hadn’t I worked hard? Didn’t I deserve this?”  
We all know people who have suf­fered, in our opinions, unjustly. Why was that caring aunt diagnosed with cancer at the youthful age of 30? How could that faithful friend end up a vic­tim of sexual abuse? We don’t know these answers and we are often filled with bitterness and anger. 
From personal experience, I can say that even the toughest times of my life have yielded some sort of posi­tive result. When I endured a horrible break up (one that I thought I could literally never get over), I was able to better understand the pain of friends who later went through similar situa­tions and was able to better help and comfort them.  
In suffering, we are better able to carry each other’s crosses — to be there for one another. If I had never suffered through a situation, how could I truly comprehend what others in similar shoes felt?  
In suffering, we are also better able to see our own vulnerability and weaknesses, and our need for God. A wise person once told me we feel closest to God in times of extremes — either extreme joy or extreme sor­row. One of my favorite songs, Laura Story’s “Blessings,” says the following: 
“What if Your blessings come through raindrops, what if Your healing comes through tears? / And what if a thousand sleepless nights are what it takes to know You’re near? / What if my greatest disappointments or the aching of this life / Is the revealing of a greater thirst this world can’t satis­fy? / And what if trials of this life, the rain, the storms, the hardest nights / Are Your mercies in disguise?” 
Even as the smartest animals on this planet, we still do not have the answers. Skepticism will argue that reason has led brilliant thinkers, beginning at the same premises, to completely different answers. We are limited in our understanding.  
As for my college application fiasco, I applied to Notre Dame on a whim.
I never would I have guessed that this school would become my second home, the place where I would meet my dearest friends and soul mates, not to mention strip Wharton of the No. 1 Business School title (ha!). Looking back, it all makes sense now. I am ever grateful that I was rejected from Wharton and co., only to be ac­cepted by the only place that really matters. Everything happens for a reason. 
So I challenge you (although much easier said than done) in times of suf­fering and pain … have a little faith.

Confessions of a Christian Party Girl

It finally happened … the first South Bend snow of the season, and with the snow came the Christmas music, holi­day signs and layaway banners.
Driving down Grape Road and having lamp post banners wish me “Happy Holidays” and “Sea­son’s Greetings” makes me smile, but also makes me question, “Aren’t we forgetting some­thing?”
Oh right.  Thanksgiving — that lesser-known, uniquely American holiday (heck, let’s face it … even Hal­loween seemed to be left out in the cold this year).
Yet in my book, Thanksgiving is a hol­iday that simply cannot be overlooked. It is the ultimate pre-game event to the Christmas season. It offers strength training and teaches endurance. 
Just how many slices of pie can we train ourselves to eat before we get sick? Is it possible to cover an entire piece of pie with whipped cream so the pie virtually disappears on the plate (yes). Or, how much turkey can we eat before the Tryptophan gets to us and we pass out for the annual Thanksgiv­ing nap? (I’m right at four slices.)
The only trouble is, Thanksgiving has so long been branded the “food holiday” in my mind, that sometimes I lose sight of what it’s all about.
Yes, this is one of those columns — encouraging you to do good this holi­day season and to think more about Thanksgiving than just it being the precursor to Black Friday or Cyber Monday.
Let’s analyze the word, shall we? Thanks-giving. Now, most might view this as the season of giving thanks. Makes sense, right? I, on the other hand, view it as a time for thanks and a time for giving. 
Thanksgiving is a time for me to take a break from the hectic life that is school (shout-out to all those finishing up senior comprehensives this semester … really it’s the can of Reddi Wip in my fridge that’s keeping me going), and spend quality, much-needed time with my family. It allows me to reflect on my many blessings, and to realize that this is also a time for giving back to the community.
That’s the intimidating part — giving back to the community. We as college students have to save the world because we are the future, right? Wrong. We’ll never be able to save the entire world this one holiday season, but we can sure take little steps toward that goal.
Before you excuse yourself from this mission because you don’t have the time or the energy to participate, think about how easy it is to donate a few cans to a food drive, or to volunteer a couple of your weekend hours to the Center for the Homeless. There are easy ways to get involved that make a world of difference in the community.
So, finish reading the rest of this newspaper, then go buy the comfort foods you need for the calm before the storm that some may call the last three weeks of classes and pick up a few cans to donate in the process. Happy thanks and happy giving!

Letter to the Editor

Fanny Demarcation Line

Dear Mr. Fitzgerald,
Thank you very much for your Letter to the Editor on Nov. 9 in response to the sickening disregard of fashion that was in Notre Dame Style Spotter on Nov. 8. As one of Fashion Magazine’s “Top 10 Most Stylish Campuses” (1992), it is the respon­sibility of our entire campus community to fight the good fight and reassure the nation that such disgraces as Mr. Denue’s attire are not representative of our student body as a whole. 
Mr. Denue, your fashion sense is an abhorrence to the rest of us reasonable, snake-skin wearing students who do our best to make Our Lady proud. Your lack of color schematics and your insistence on wearing socks with your boat shoes (thank heavens, at least they were Sperry) is truly embarrassing.
Take a bigger picture approach to this: think about the male psyche. Now think about the female psyche. Think about thinking about the male and females psyches. What would Ryan Seacrest think about the way in which your brightly hued waist-pouch, regardless of its incredible convenience and practicality, threatens to undo the very fabric of our University?  
Can you stop for a moment and just think about what a campus-wide fanny pack epidemic would look like? Mr. Fitzger­ald, I wholeheartedly agree with you. Though short shorts may be making reappearances, and though people wear socks with their Adidas and Nike sandals all of the time, we must not allow this FDL (Fanny Demarcation Line) to be crossed.
But, let’s end on a positive note. 
At least his mustache was in tip-top shape.  It would be a shame if he dressed in such a fashion without a good lip blan­ket.

What are you worth?

What are you worth?
First and foremost, are you relatively symmetrical?
If you don’t have looks, then at least tell me you have wit.
What about an education from a reputable institution?
What about money?
If you couldn’t check anything off, I’m afraid you’re not worth much to society.
Congratulations, however, to those who are still on the radar. Having one or more of these qualities will certainly help you in your life-long quest for so­cial mobility. Let us further assess your market price.
If you looked good today, you prob­ably held your head high and walked with purpose. If you looked like you just rolled out of bed, then you might have looked down while you walked, or were less willing to put yourself in the spotlight. If you donned something expensive, you might have felt more self-confident.
Did you say something astute in class today that warranted an approving nod from several students or the professor? What about in passing conversation? Did you uphold your end on small talk and display your wit?
Hopefully you did, because otherwise you would appear stupid, uninteresting or, worst of all, awkward in public.
If you are experiencing inner turmoil because you are struggling to choose between what you really want to major in and what society will take seriously, then you are not alone. It’s only natural to want the rest of the world to take your degree seriously — especially high-paying employers. You will be poor and illegitimate if you do not meet these expectations.
Quite obviously, meeting the status quo of appearance, knowledge, profes­sion and wealth is critical if you want to amount to anything in this world.
These are the factors that sum up our self-worth and make up our value system. Within a society that reveres the beautiful, the rich, the professional and the powerful, those who do not fit the protocol required for respect are stripped of not only credibility, but also dignity.
It is this value system that, in part, serves to explain why so many — in­cluding undergraduate students — don’t see the workers that complete all the tasks that they would never do. This is why these janitors feel less worthy than “professionals.” This is why certain groups experience explicit or sublimi­nal discrimination. This is why those who cannot afford to dress expensively feel less confident than those who can, and why those who do not follow the same eroded path toward the standard definition of success are considered social failures.
Evidently, we don’t define how we per­ceive ourselves — everyone else does. It is the rest of the world’s perception of us that holds weight. Who we are in other people’s eyes determines our self-worth. We define our place, then, according to an external hierarchy or social ladder.
The higher up the hierarchy one is in terms of appearance, wealth, profes­sion, or any other factor society uses as a tool for discrimination, the greater the amount of “dignity,” “honor” and “value” granted to the individual hold­ing that position. The higher up one is, the more one can look down on the inferior below. Conversely, the lower down one is, the less one feels deserv­ing of the dignity and respect accorded to those above. We jump through hoops built by others in a nonsensical frenzy to meet protocol, in hopes of earning respect from the rest of the world.
What can we take away from this? If we ever catch ourselves trying to prove that we are better than someone else, justifying why someone is better than us, or judging if someone is worth our attention, we need to take a step back and reassess.
By looking at ourselves through the eyes of others or judging others based on this value system, we undermine dignity, value and diversity. This com­plete ignores the inherent dignity in every person and his or her contribu­tion to the world. 
This devalues what is truly essential to being a good person and living a ful­filling life. This perpetuates a system in which “diversity” is only skin-deep and acts simply as a marketing tactic. Real diversity is individuality.
The phrase “you are your own worst critic” is not always true since every­one else is the worse critic whom we perpetually seek to please. In the end, personal attributes, dreams and hopes are worth more than fulfilling oth­ers’ expectations. By actively defining ourselves and our worth, we can begin to embrace differences both within ourselves and within others.

A cautionary tale

Letters to the Editor

In defense of Fanny packs

Tonight my most meaningful class, a discernment seminar, ended, so I feel I should write something about my chosen path so far. This is not simply a self-indulgent piece about the beautiful journey (or marathon/box of chocolates/insert cliché here) of life. This is a cautionary tale. 
Students are flocking to Mendoza in record numbers, avoiding less “practi­cal” majors because the economy has gone to hell and even educated, skilled people can’t put food on the table, let alone fulfill their ambitions. However, if business is not your passion, you are hurting yourself and the world by ignor­ing your vocation in favor of the “safe” option. 
(Also, news flash: there is no safe option; you never know what might happen in life.)
This is not a “let’s bash the business school” letter. Going into business is not the only way to ignore what actually moves you (and if business is what moves you, go for it!). 
My greatest Notre Dame regret is not being a Peace Studies major. I would likely have had to drop a major, and I felt it wasn’t worth “wasting” the credits and starting fresh. 
I was also running scared from a less “practical” major. I don’t lose sleep over this, but I will always wonder if I made that decision for the right reasons. 
The decisions each of us make and the passions to which we decide to devote our lives affect other people in significant, albeit subtle ways. Had I chosen peace studies, I might be more able to work for social justice, as I hope to do in some way for the rest of my life.
As an English and Spanish major, I have plenty of opportunities to do mean­ingful service, and many careers could be fulfilling for me, so I am not saying only one path is right. I am simply asking you to search within yourself, with your Higher Power’s help, if you have one, before making the major decision of choosing your major. 
Bad puns aside, I hope you will consider taking the road less traveled or whichever road you feel best suits you.

Dear Mr. Fitzgerald,
While it is by no means a timeless accessory in a well-dressed man’s ward­robe, the Fanny pack does not merit the criticism voiced in your Nov. 9 Letter to the Editor. Despite your assertion to the contrary, the Fanny pack is an incred­ibly functional accoutrement. 
It’s the perfect size for stowing a cell phone, wallet, water bottle and keys on the way to the gym. And ask any lady of sophistication if she’d rather date a man whose ill-fitting cargo shorts are stuffed with everyday necessities or a man who throws those same essentials into a Fanny pack (worn casually over one shoulder) and opts for a pair of tailored trousers or, dare I say, short shorts (7-in. inseam being my personal preference, 5-in. if you are particularly dar­ing). 
She will obviously prefer the man with the fanny pack. Further, if Notre Dame is ever ranked as the least stylish college campus, Fanny packs won’t be the cul­prit. Rather, it will be the abundance of baggy sweatpants, Ugg boots, oversized parkas and euphemistically dubbed “athletic” apparel that earn Notre Dame such a status. 
Most importantly, I refute your claim that Mr. Denue deserves a scolding for wearing a Fanny pack in public. Consider Thom Browne, 1988 graduate of Notre Dame and designer of the eponymous label. 
Much like Mr. Denue’ss Fanny pack, Browne’s signature slim lapels and trun­cated trousers initially met with hostility, but his vision dramatically shifted the paradigm of modern menswear, and the Council of Fashion Designers of Ameri­ca ultimately dubbed Browne the Menswear Designer of the Year in 2006. 
Mr. Denue should be similarly applauded for his own interpretation of fash­ion, which serves as a breath of fresh air in a rather stylistically homogeneous community.
Fanny pack swag,

Christie isn’t helping

I noticed an ad in The Observer on Nov. 11 for Gov. Chris Christie’s keynote on “Educational Innovation and the Law.” The ad states that the governor of New Jersey is “advancing an ambitious campaign to ensure that every child in the state has a chance to succeed.” Nothing could be further from the truth. As a New Jerseyan who went through the (excellent) public school system and who has a mother who teaches in it, I have watched incredulously as Chris Christie has chipped away at the educa­tion system.
Mr. Christie (who’s own children attend private school) began his tenure with a vi­cious attack on schoolteachers. The governor has made clear his belief that teachers, traditionally thought of as underpaid, well-educated professionals, are overcompen­sated.  He has, in his combative style of speaking, insulted the profession repeatedly as he pushed forward laws restricting their collective bargaining rights.
The Governor has also slashed funding for schools. This is understandable to some degree, given the budget crisis state has faced.  (He has, of course, refused to raise
taxes, but that is another issue.) However, he has cut aid unevenly, slashing court-mandated aid to poor urban districts, while allowing smaller cuts to wealthy sub­urban enclaves. Lashing out at the state’s Superior Court, the governor has ousted certain members of the court, which could lessen its willingness to challenge him.
The administration bungled its Race to the Top application, foregoing a chance for $400 million. Typically, Christie passed the buck to his Education Commissioner, angrily asserting that he did nothing wrong.
I look forward to hearing Mr. Christie explain how all of these things further our education system.

Fate, and constantly pestering my parents, would have it that I was in the middle of a European tour when the seventh and final “Harry Potter” book was released. It gave me quite a bit of pause when I realized those two dates coincided. Not enough to, say, cancel my trip to Europe, but enough to develop an uncomfortable feeling in the pit of my stomach.
It wasn’t just the last time a Harry Potter book would come out. It was the last time I would go to get the book with my brothers, the last time I would be reading new material for the first time, the last time my middle brother would try to ruin things for me by telling me to open to a certain page number because he read faster than me, the last time I would sit down with that brother once we finished and discuss every detail and revelation. It was the end of all of those things, and I wouldn’t be there to experi­ence them.
I traveled to seven countries in the three weeks I was abroad, but I was in Budapest. Hungary when “Deathly Hal­lows” hit bookshelves. I was there with a group from my high school, including two of my best friends and my favorite English teacher. I begged him to take me into the city at midnight and let me get the book, but, unsurprisingly, he wasn’t having it.
“I am not taking you into a foreign city in the middle of the night to get a book,” he said exasperatedly after I’d asked for the 10th time. “That’s just not happen­ing.”
I sulked for a while. When midnight rolled around, even though I was several hours ahead of them, I pictured my mom standing in line at Barnes and Noble with my brothers. I sniffed a little and went to bed.
The next day was a different story. My poor friends just wanted to explore Budapest, but it wasn’t in the cards for them. I insisted, probably very obnox­iously, that we find a bookstore so I could get “Hallows.” They agreed, quite possibly on the singular observation that I was reaching desperation.
We found a bookstore and then had to go find an ATM because I had underes­timated how much more expensive the books were in Europe. I walked blocks in search of that ATM, and with every step that Budapest kept me away from Harry, the city lost a little bit of its luster for me. I finally returned to the bookstore, my aggravated friends in tow, and I bought the book.
“Wait until you’re in your room to­night,” my English teacher told me as I cracked it open when we got to the bus. “You don’t want to miss out on the sights because you’re reading.”
In my first blatant act of defiance of a teacher, I ignored him. And I read. And read. And read. The extra 12 hours I had to wait had made me even hungrier for the story than I had imagined. I read the whole day — through our tour of the city, market shopping and riverboat ride. I wondered vaguely if in a few years I would look back on that day that I read Harry Potter instead of taking in Europe and remember it as a waste and be disappointed. At the time, I didn’t think much of it as I finished the book in less than seven hours.
Four years later, I don’t regret it. If there was something I regretted about that summer it was missing the last book release with my brothers, although I did like Europe very much. Some might say that’s crazy, but it’s hard to weigh the experiences against one another — they were both important for vastly different reasons. 
I do remember the feeling I had as I closed the book because I felt it again quite recently. I reread the entire series this summer in fast succession. I hadn’t really read any of them since my second read-through of the seventh book, not even when their movie counterparts were released. I didn’t realize until I started reading again that I had been trying to flush my deeper love of Harry from my mind.
Why, you might ask? It’s become clear from this series that my love of “Harry Potter” is maybe a touch too strong. A lack of stability and friends in my child­hood had made the world of “Harry Potter” just a little too important to me. But when I closed the final book, I didn’t know what to do with myself exactly. There had always been another book to look forward to, another day to antici­pate and count down to.
I stopped reading because I hated the realization that this was the end of my unconventional childhood. I didn’t like that sinking feeling when I started to look toward the next adventure and realized it wasn’t coming. Without decid­ing to, I shelved Harry and focused on the real friends I had created by 16.
When I started reading this summer, it was more of a homage to my childhood as the movies wrapped up than a real desire to revisit the powerful feelings I had struggled through in my original readings of the books. Regardless of my intentions, I discovered many of the same truths again, including what it felt like to turn the final page. The end­ing was just as hard for me this time around. I had the same strong wish for an eighth book (I don’t know about this Pottermore thing coming out). 
There was something different this time around though. Maybe it was maturity that made me see I had closed the door on Harry in the wrong way. I had thought if I didn’t revisit Harry, I wouldn’t miss him. 
The thing is, I took real truths from the books when I needed them as a kid, and this summer, I found that I had forgotten some of those very lessons. The books, while not new, were there to be rediscovered by me. The escape still ex­ists. A reread can always take me to the place I once needed and send me away with reminders of the things I learned for myself there — and those truths will always be my eighth book.

The end has finally come. Be it the end of your childhood or the end of those incessantly annoying fanatics who talk about horcruxes and Muggles, the end of “Harry Potter” on screen has arrived.
With Friday’s release of “Harry Pot­ter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2” on DVD, the saga comes to a close and your video collection of the boy wizard’s adventures can come to a close as well.
Or can it?
Warner Bros. isn’t going to make buy­ing your copy of the movie easy on you. Yes, you can drive over to your local Target or head to Amazon.com and pick it up. But which one do you get? Warner Bros. has released countless versions of the video, each with different features and each carried by different retailers.
The special features range widely in quality and some features are only available on certain versions of the movie.
Every edition comes with a glorified advertisement video for the new Warner Bros. “Harry Potter” studio tour. Start­ing next year, Leavesden Studios, the home of “Harry Potter,” will be opened to the public for tours of the sets and glimpses of costumes, props and all the other magic you saw on screen. The video is pretty nice, with cast interviews and some footage of the sets, but it’s nothing you can’t get online.
Each version of the DVD also comes with a set of deleted scenes. Unlike many films, where the deleted scenes are never edited and therefore look distinctly different from the movie they’re attached to, the “Deathly Hal­lows” scenes are thankfully fully edited and fit in well with the movie. However, the eight scenes included are short and fairly unexciting. There are some charming moments between Luna and Harry, Tonks and Lupin, Hermione and Ron and Harry and Ginny, but nothing to get too excited about.
The real excitement for fans comes from a series of “Behind the Story” videos. There is a nearly hour-long interview with J.K. Rowling and Daniel Radcliffe on the creation of the epony­mous character that should not be missed. There is also a featurette on the creation of Gringotts’ goblins and a video about the women of the “Harry Potter” universe. These videos are the meat of the special features. 
Finally, for a few savvy shoppers (read on to learn how to be one yourself), there is an additional feature included. The documentary “When Harry Left Hogwarts” was shot during the filming of the final two movies and includes an unprecedented look into the world of “Harry Potter.” This might be the juici­est extra of them all. 
But buying any edition of the movie won’t get you all of this.
The first question is DVD or Blu-Ray. In no real surprise, the image and qual­ity of the Blu-Ray version of the film is much better — that is the point of the new technology. But, ultimately, as is the case with many Blu-Rays, the value of the Blu-Ray over the DVD is as much dependent on the quality and size of your television than it is with the disc itself. You probably know which version is for you.
Here comes the tricky part, though — Warner Bros. is pushing you to get Blu-Ray. In fact, for “Harry Potter” fanatics and cinephiles alike, Blu-Ray is almost the only way to go.  If you choose the buy the basic DVD, you’ll get the movie, the studio tour ad and the deleted scenes. There’s really not that much there for hardcore fans. 
There is one beacon of hope for non Blu-Ray owners who want the special features. Head to Wal-Mart (and only Wal-Mart) and you can buy a special two-disc DVD that will include all of the special features except for “When Harry Left Hogwarts.”
If you love the special features, though, spring for the Blu-Ray. You can go basic and buy a standard Blu-Ray set with just the deleted scenes or you can step up for the three-disc combo pack with the Blu-Ray, a DVD copy, a down­loadable version and all of the special features except for the documentary. This version is available almost every­where. 
If you’re dying for “When Harry Left Hogwarts” though, Target is your sole saving grace. The documentary is exclusive to their four-disc set, which includes everything from the Blu-Ray three-disc combo pack plus the doc.
For 3D fanatics, Best Buy has an ex­clusive 3D version of the film.
The bottom line? If you want all the nuts and bolts, splurge on the Target special. If not, then you have plenty of alternative options.
But don’t be so quick to ask for the eight-movie Blu-Ray collection for Christmas this year. You may have heard the shocking news that Warner Bros. is “vaulting” us —taking a page from Disney and stopping the ship­ment of “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2” to stores after the New Year. But don’t freak out just yet.
Yes, this is true. But Warner Bros. has commented in interviews that they are aware they have never released any special editions of any of the films with all of the bonus material they’ve certainly been compiling over the last decade. They’ve hinted enough at the release of an ultimate collector’s edition of all of the films to make it an inevita­bility sometime in 2012. There are no extra features on this year’s eight-movie set, so be a smart shopper and wait until the complete, ultimate 
edition sometime next year.

In everything it does, Notre Dame loves being a campus of “firsts.” This week the Depart­ment of Film, Tele­vision, and Theatre (FTT) will present the first work­shop pro­duction of Anne Gar­cía-Rome­ro’s newest play “Prov­enance,” giving the Notre Dame com­munity a chance to be its first audience.
“Prov­enance” is about two sisters who re­ceive a sto­len painting that was made by their Mexican great-grand­father and the challenge they face in deciding whether or not to keep it.
The script was inspired by the life and art of Mexican artist Martín Ramírez. Gar­cía-Romero came across an exhibition of his work in New York several years ago. From there, she began research that took her as far as the painter’s hometown of Jalisco, Mexico. The thorough research for the script carries over to director Kevin Dreyer’s specific vision for the show, which works with the script to create a very real­istic feel.  
García-Romero is a visiting professor in the FTT depart­ment as well as a Moreau Fel­low. The Moreau Fellowship is designed to bring scholars to campus from groups that are underrepresented to encour­age dialogue about diversity. 
“Provenance” accomplishes that goal through its focus on a Mexican-American family. 
“It really explores questions of roots and background, and shows the wide range of con­nections people can have to their heritage,” sophomore Ga­briela Nunez, who plays Grace Martinez, said.
Race and culture are topics that often do not receive much exposure at Notre Dame. Ca­rina Finn, who plays Cindy Jacobs, said she has enjoyed being involved in the play. “‘Provenance’ is an especially intimate piece and deals with race and culture in ways I haven’t seen done before in my time here,” she said. 
Each cast and crew member brings personal experiences to this performance, enrich­ing the show’s first workshop with their own touches. “Prov­enance” has brought to­gether fac­ulty, under­graduates, international students and gradu­ate members of the Notre Dame com­munity — a mix that you would be hard-pressed to find in an­other show on campus.
The pro­duction pro­cess for this show has also been unique, with script changes occurring until the beginning of this month. 
“There has definitely been a lot more research involved in this show than any other one I’ve done be­fore,” Nunez said. 
The actors have clearly enjoyed engag­ing with a new work and de­veloping it with the guidance of its writer. 
“I love [Gar­cía-Romero’s] ability to tem­per genuine human expe­rience with just the right amount of magical re­alism,” Finn said. “It makes the world of the play a completely engaging and fantastic space.”
Charlie O’Leary, the production’s drama­turg, said his favorite part of the process has been the novelty of the play. 
“I think it’s really ex­citing that we are the first group of people to see this brand new piece of theatre,” he said. “The process of working on a new play is especially interesting because the script is a semi-malleable document that everyone involved has a hand in shaping.” 
Nunez said all of the hard work has been rewarding. 
“Knowing that I am the first person to play this character is also really exciting and has really made me think about who I want this character to be,” she said. “[Working with García-Romero] makes me feel confident that the play is be­ing produced the way that the playwright intended, which is something I’ve never had the chance to know.
Sophomore Natalie Cuevas, who plays Ramon Martinez said the characters are very relatable.
“There are so many different things that the characters go through that I think everyone can relate to in some way,” she said. “ It’s very personal and because of that, one of the most touching and intimate shows I’ve ever done.”
In ad­dition to this week’s perfor­mances of “Prov­enance,” the De­partment is pre­senting a free con­ference Thursday.  The “La­tina The­ater To­day: New Voices Confer­ence” will feature two pan­els of leading scholars, per­formers and writers discussing 
contemporary development of Latina theater and 21st centu­ry Latina playwrights. Students who attend the conference will receive a complementary ticket to Thursday night’s perfor­mance. 
“Provenance,” written by Anne García-Romero and di­rected by Kevin Dreyer, runs Nov. 16-20 in the Philbin Stu­dio The­atre at the DeBartalo Performing Arts Cen­ter. Stu­dent tickets are $5 and general ad­mission is $10. Tick­ets can be purchased at perform­ingarts.nd.edu or at the DPAC box office. The “Lati­na Theater Today: New Voices Con­ference” will be held on Thursday from 1 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. in McKenna Hall, Room 210. More informa­tion can be found at ftt.nd.edu

Buccaneers streak by Texans, 37-9

Playoff still needed

It’s the perfect weekend for opponents of any sort of playoff system in college football. No. 4 Stanford lost to No. 7 Oregon, ending the Car­dinal’s hopes of an un­defeated season, and with them, any realistic chance at a national title. No. 5 Boise State fell to TCU, and the Broncos will be waiting another year for the long-hoped call to the title game. As the season goes on, teams keep drop­ping games, and hopes` for lifting that crystal football keep fading
It’s the “regular-season playoff” so many tradition­alists vouch for. Though the season began with a wide-open field racing toward the ultimate goal, just three teams have realistic shots at championship-game berths: No. 1 LSU, No. 2 Oklaho­ma State and No. 3 Ala­bama.
So this proves we don’t need any sort of playoff system, right?
Let me answer that question with another question.
Are you kidding me?
Of course we need a play­off. In fact, we need a play­off this year more than ever — and not just any playoff. We need the craziest, big­gest playoff we can get: the 16-team playoff proposed by Yahoo! Sports’ Dan Wetzel.
Wetzel essentially says there should be an auto­matic entry from each and every Football Bowl Sub­division conference (nine when he counted, but who knows how many that actu­ally is given conference re­alignment), and then filling out the field with at-large bids. He argues this system would give the regular sea­son value: the No. 1 team at the end of the year would get to play a weak Sun Belt champion, while the No. 6-ranked team would have to play a much stronger opponent. He suggests that every game save the title matchup be played at the home stadium of the high­er-seeded opponent, giving added value to the regular season.
All of that is fine, and it’s a pretty nifty design for a playoff system. But the best part of Wetzel’s proposal is pretty simple.
It’s a whole lot of fun.
You can’t tell me you wouldn’t tune in to watch Oklahoma and LSU duke it out for a spot in the nation­al championship game. You can’t tell me you wouldn’t watch Oklahoma State-Ne­vada in hopes of a Cinder­ella-style upset. You can’t tell me you wouldn’t watch Alabama and Stanford battle to just get out of the first round. Even better, all of the Boise State, TCU and Utah fans out there would get to ride their bandwagon all the way to the cham­pionship game — if their teams earn it.
Yeah, a playoff would be fun. Even better, it would help us really determine the best team every year. It’s pretty obvious that Alabama, LSU, Oklahoma State, Okla­homa, Oregon and Stanford are the best six teams in the country — most would agree that a matchup be­tween any two of those teams would probably be pretty close, especially if those teams have already played this season. 
But only two of them can play in the title game.
So why not open up to a playoff system? Let the best team earn that shiny Wa­terford crystal. But once it’s a plus-one system or a four-team system, you’re just cheating the fans — you might as well make it 16. 
But for this year, at least, we won’t get the answer to the question of who the best team in the country is. We’ll just be left with one resounding question: What if?

Associated Press
TAMPA, Fla.  — The streak­ing Houston Texans are gaining confidence by the victory.
The AFC South leaders pum­meled the reeling Tampa Bay Buccaneers 37-9 on Sunday with Matt Schaub throwing for two long touchdowns, Arian Foster, Ben Tate and Derrick Ward each running for scores, and the NFL’s No. 1-ranked de­fense delivering another strong performance.
“We’re playing well as a team,” Schaub said after the Texans (7-3) won their fourth straight with star receiver An­dre Johnson sidelined by ham­string injury, matching a fran­chise mark set in 2009 to head into their bye week with their best-ever record through 10 games.
“We have some playmakers on this offense,” the quarter­back added. “Defensively, we’re playing really well. They’re holding teams, making them turn the ball over. They’re just playing exceptional football.”
Jacoby Jones filled in for Johnson with an 80-yard TD reception on the first play from scrimmage and Foster turned a short pass into his second 78-yard scoring reception of the season for Houston.
A defense that’s made a dra­matic turnaround under coor­dinator Wade Phillips had four sacks, three interceptions and recovered a fumble.
The Texans lead their divi­sion by 1 1-2 games over sec­ond-place Tennessee and may get Johnson, who’s been side­lined six weeks, back when they travel to Jacksonville in two weeks. After losing two straight without Schaub’s favorite tar­get, Houston has put together an impressive winning streak by getting contributions from a lot of different players.
The bye figures to give others a chance to get healthy, too.
“It was important today that we got to this point,” coach Gary Kubiak said. “We’ve been working really hard. ... We had five or six players that missed a whole week of practice, and they lined up and played. ‘We’ve got a good team thing going on right now.”
The Bucs (4-5), on the other hand, have lost three straight and four of five following a 3-1 start.
Josh Freeman threw three interceptions and was sacked four times, and Tampa Bay’s offense didn’t get into the end zone until the fourth quarter for the second game in a row. Defensively, the Bucs tackled poorly and yielded 268 yards in the opening half and 420 over­all.
“Terrible game. Completely, put the blame on me for this one. ... We started the game just like we finished it,” Tampa Bay coach Raheem Morris said. “Poor job by myself. I’ll take complete responsibility for that. I refuse to believe that our guys are that bad, so it has to be my fault.”
Houston, which is ranked No. 1 in total defense for the first time, has limited opponents to just over 10 points per game during its winning streak. Af­ter limiting the Titans, Jaguars and Browns to fewer than 175 yards the previous three weeks, the Texans held Tampa Bay to 231.
Foster and Tate each ran for over 100 yards to key last week’s 30-12 victory over Cleve­land. They weren’t as success­ful running this time, however the Texans did finish with 185 yards on the ground. Foster gained 84 on 17 carries and Tate wound up with 63 on 13 carries, including an 11-yard TD burst to make it 37-9 with under six minutes remaining.
“With winning comes a win­ning mind-set, and believing in each other keeps that positive energy flowing,” Texans defen­sive end Antonio Smith said. “I think everybody is in on it from top to bottom.”
Tampa Bay scored on Con­nor Barth’s 55-yard field goal on the final play of the first half and didn’t get into the end zone until Freeman threw a 9-yard TD pass to Preston Parker early in the fourth quarter. Defen­sive tackle Albert Haynesworth made his debut for the Bucs, blocking an extra point after Houston’s first touchdown and finishing with five tackles.
The two-time Pro Bowl se­lection was released by New England on Tuesday, claimed off waivers Wednesday and practiced with his new team for the first time on Thursday. Gerald McCoy’s season-ending injury left the Bucs thin on the offensive line, and with back­up Frank Okam still sidelined by a sore calf, the 350-pound Haynesworth moved into the starting lineup.
A week after rushing for a club-record 261 yards during a 30-12 victory over Cleveland, the Texans came out throw­ing on a Bucs defense that has struggled to stop the run and had to honor Schaub’s play-ac­tion fakes. A wide-open Jacoby Jones caught an underthrown ball at the Tampa Bay 45 on the first play, cut back to his left be­tween safeties Tanard Jackson and Sean Jones and sprinted to the end zone to finish Houston’s longest scoring play of the sea­son.
Foster’s long TD reception nearly covered as much ground and also involved some nifty running after the catch. The third-year running back took a short throw from Schaub, broke a tackle and headed up the left sideline before cutting inside near midfield to avoid Sean Jones and easily outrun the re­maining pursuit.
Houston’s first three scoring drives covered 80, 80 and 90 yards. Foster had four recep­tions for 102 yards, and missed going over 100 yards rushing when he had a 39-yard gain wiped out by a penalty in the fourth quarter.

Irish fall in dual meet to Louisville 

Observer Staff Report
The Irish opened the season 3-1, with their only loss coming at the hands of nationally ranked Auburn. Since then, Notre Dame has dropped two dual meets to conference opponents to bring its record to .500.
On Saturday, Louisville topped the Irish 188-112, winning 10 of the 16 events. For the first time this season, Notre Dame (3-3) failed to claim victory in either the one-meter or three-meter dives. Junior Jenny Chiang took second in both events.
Freshman Emma Reaney led the Irish effort, taking first in the 100- and 200-yard breast­stroke and the 200-yard indi­vidual medley, while swimming on the first-place 400-yard free­style relay team.
Senior Amy Prestinario won the 100-yard freestyle in 50.80, while sophomore Kelly Ryan clocked in at 1:51.05 to win the 200-yard freestyle, rounding out Notre Dame’s first-place fin­ishes.
Louisville (3-1), like Notre Dame, benefitted from the play of its freshmen. The Cardinals’ rookie swimmers accounted for four victories at the meet.
The Irish will take a break from competition for the remain­der of November before heading to the Ohio State Invitational in Columbus, Ohio. The three-day meet begins Dec. 2.

Underclassmen gain experience in final fall matches

By VICKY JACOBSEN
Sports Writer
The Irish concluded their fall season with a partial squad at the 2011 Dick Vitale Intercollegiate Clay Court Classic in Lakewood Ranch, Fla.
“I think it was a great way to finish up the season be­cause it was a fun, re­laxed tour­nament, but still had a competitive edge,” sopho­more JoHan­na Manning­ham said.
Sopho­more Britney Sanders, the No. 4-seed, had the best showing of the weekend for the Irish. After a first-round bye, she defeated Yana Mavrina, a sophomore from Temple, 7-6 (5), 7-6 (3). In the quarterfinals she fell, 2-6, 7-5, 6-4,  to Memphis senior Mariya Slupska, who went on to defeat her own teammate, junior Courtney Collins, for the singles title.
Freshman Katherine White also had a first-round bye, but despite winning the first set she lost the match, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5, to Sarah Toti, a freshman from Tennessee. She dropped her consolation match to Mississippi State freshman Petra Ferancova, 6-2, 3-6, 10-6.
Manningham beat Temple senior Paola Calderon by a score of 6-3, 1-6, 6-4 in the first round, but was de­feated by freshman Meghan Blevins of Oklahoma State 6-3, 6-2 in her next round.
“The com­petition was very fun and it was a great experi­ence to have an outdoors tournament,” Manningham said. “NCAAs in the spring is outdoors, but unfortunately we spend most of our season indoors, so it was good to get some more experience.”
Sophomore Julie Sabacin­ski faced Memphis sopho­more Stefanie Mikesz in the first round, losing 6-2, 6-1. She won the first set of her consolation match 6-3 and moved on to the next round when her opponent, Missis­sippi State sophomore Rose­line Dion, retired. Sabacin­ski forced a third set but lost her next match to Marvina, 7-6, 3-6, 10-4.
“It was a good tourna­ment,” Sabacinski said. “I would have liked to have had a better tournament [perfor­mance-wise,] I think all of us would, but it was a nice tournament to end the fall with and it was fun and nice weather.”
The four also teamed up for the doubles draw. Saba­cinski and Manningham lost, 8-4, to the Tennessee duo of freshmen Joanna Hender­son and Caitlyn Williams. Sanders and White had a first round bye and swept their first opponents, Okla­homa State’s juniors Malika Rose and C.C. Sardinha, 8-0. They ran into trouble in the semifinal round, losing 8-5 to Tennessee’s sophomore Brynn Boren and Toti, the eventual winners.
The Irish also had to adjust to playing on clay after com­peting on hard courts all fall.
“It’s just slower. The points are longer; you have to be ready to play longer points,” Sabacinski, who grew up playing on clay courts in Florida, said. “It was defi­nitely hard to make a tran­sition onto clay when we’ve been playing indoors, but I think once we started play­ing we were fine.”
The Irish have completed the fall half of their sched­ule, which is used mostly to tune up for the more team-oriented spring season.
“We got to play a lot of matches which is really what we all needed in the end,” Sabacinski said. “I think it was best for all of us.”
The Irish won’t head into competition again until next semester, when they face Cincinnati at home Jan. 21.

Saint Mary’s earns first dual meet win

Belles place 22nd in regional championships

By VICKY JACOBSEN
Sports Writer
The Belles won their first dual meet in more than two years Saturday when they defeated Defiance, 152-50.
Saint Mary’s athletes fin­ished first in 12 of the 14 events contested against Defiance (1-4), a brand new program competing in its first-ever away meet. The Belles (1-3) last won a head-to-head matchup in January 2009, when they beat Albion, 167-124.
Saint Mary’s showed no signs of fatigue despite com­peting in two meets the pre­vious weekend and enduring several strenuous practices.
“It’s been a pretty hard week for us training wise,” Belles coach Mark Benishek said. “It was a tough week on the girls if you would ask them.”
Belles senior captains ap­peared to thrive under the strenuous training condi­tions as they accounted for eight of the 12 first-place finishes and swam in both of the winning relays.
Megan Price swept the dis­tance freestyle events, win­ning the 1,000-yard free in 11:33.98 and the 500-yard free in 5:37.20. Katie Smith took several sprint events, finishing first in the 100- and 200-yard free in 58.76 and 2:05.94, respectively. Audrey Dalrymple dominat­ed the breaststroke, winning the 100- and 200-yard events in 1:11.31 and 2:32.06, re­spectively. She also took first in the 100-yard butter­fly, finishing in 1:04.36.
Freshman Anna Nolan and junior Genevieve Spit­tler accounted for the other two individual wins. Nolan finished first in the 50-yard free in 26.74 and Spittler won the 200-yard butterfly in 2:28.41. 
The Belles also domi­nated the relays. Nolan and Dalyrmple teamed up with junior Kristyn Gerbeth and sophomore Sarah Thompson to win the 200-yard medley relay in 1:59.60, while Price, Gerbeth, Nolan and senior Katie Donovan won the 200-yard free relay in 2:05.94.
The Belles are already looking forward to future in­vites. 
“We’re still kind of build­ing up for the two large in­vites we have coming up here at the beginning of Thanksgiving Break,” Ben­ishek said.
The Belles will return to the pool for the Wabash In­vitational in Crawfordsville, Ind. at 4 p.m. Friday and Saturday.

Observer Staff Report
After concluding its con­ference season two weeks ago, Saint Mary’s ended the year at the NCAA Great Lakes Regional on Satur­day.
The Belles beat out three conference schools on its way to a 22nd-place fin­ish overall despite fin­ishing just seventh out of nine MIAA teams in the fi­nal conference standings. MIAA foes Kalamazoo, Trine and Olivet finished behind Saint Mary’s at the event.
Senior captain Joanne Almond finished her stel­lar season with another personal best. She finished 53rd overall and cracked the 23-minute mark for the first time in her career on a six-kilometer course. Al­mond finished in 22:58.91 to earn 52 points for the Belles.
Juniors Julia Kenney and Emma Baker crossed the line within seconds of each other as the top Saint Mary’s finishers. Kenney clocked in at 23:40.40, while Baker finished in 23:43.61, good enough for 89th.
Junior Angela Nebesny and junior captain Sarah Copi rounded out the top five for the Belles. Nebe­sny’s time of 24:31.33 marked a new personal record. Copi finished sec­onds behind her own per­sonal best, clocking in at 25:12.56.

Irish end fall season with scrimmage

By CORY BERNARD
Sports Writer
After having their scrimmage against Indiana cancelled last weekend, the Irish finally got back on the water Sunday for their final competition of the fall season.
Notre Dame raced in a scrim­mage against Big Ten schools Ohio State, Michigan State and Indiana on the Griggs Reservoir in Columbus, Ohio.
Because of the informal set­ting, no official results were published. However, the Buck­eyes, who finished last season No. 8 in the country, took first in all five of the varsity eight-person races. Having competed against last season’s national champion in the Head of the Charles Regatta earlier in the fall, the Irish have raced against the nation’s best this season. 
Irish coach Martin Stone said Ohio State belongs in that cat­egory.
“They will be up there at the end of the season,” Stone said of the Buckeyes. “They’re very fast, a very good group. Also, Indiana’s got some speed, Mich­igan State’s got some speed and we’ve got some speed.”
Stone said the opportunity to race against some talented squads showed his team areas that need improving. Addition­ally, he said the format of the scrimmage helped in prepara­tion for the spring season.
“There’s a lot of stuff to work on to continue to get faster,” Stone said. “The scrimmage consisted of five four-minute pieces, which is kind of a dif­ferent race plan. We did well from a learning experience — it gives us an indication of where we are at and what we need to work on. It also gave our kids a lot of experience side-by-side, which is more typical of what’s to come in the spring.”
Though wind rendered some areas of the water too danger­ous, the teams found enough shelter for calm racing. The same could not be said for Notre Dame’s scrimmage against In­diana, scheduled for last week­end in Indianapolis. Because teams have limited opportuni­ties for events in the fall, Stone said the cancellation was disap­pointing, albeit necessary.
“It’s disappointing we couldn’t get it done, obviously you al­ways look forward to compet­ing against other competition,” he said. “Weather is just some­thing that happens, and so a decision had to be made. That’s rowing, and we know it.”
Despite being robbed of one of its opportunities to race, Notre Dame will enter the offseason with knowledge on how to im­prove, Stone said. He said each individual must work on specif­ic aspects of her fitness in order to continue improving into the second half of the season.
“Each student-athlete needs something different,” Stone said. “Some need to be more aerobically fit, some need more power and raw strength. Each will have their own plan be­tween now and when we get back to the water. We’ll be conducting some assessments this week to see how much ev­erybody has improved since we began in August. Everyone will get guidance on what each per­son should do to improve.”

to keep shooting. With Tim being out, I felt like I had to step up and score a little more than I would usu­ally.”
The Irish started off hot, put­ting together a 10-2 run in the first four min­utes of the game. At the 16-miniute mark, At­kins severely crossed over his defender before split­ting two defenders and fin­ished with a nifty finger roll at the basketball, drawing a large outburst from the crowd. 
“This group is still trying to find itself and I thought we had a bunch of different guys who stepped up for us,” Irish coach Mike Brey said. “I thought Eric was a man and he sensed what he need­ed to do. Overall, I thought we were searching for that offensive rhythm at times and he found that he had to do some things sometimes and he did. Just his overall demeanor was key for us and maybe that is the benefit of having [Abromaitis] out is that he has to do that even more so this week to speed up the leadership, [process] for him.”
Despite a quick comeback from the Delta Devils that gave them a 16-15 advan­tage, the Irish took the lead for good with just under 10 minutes left in the first half. Sophomore guard Jer­ian Grant sparked the Irish late in the first half, scoring eight of his 11 to­tal points while fifth-year forward Scott Martin struggled from the field despite scor­ing a quiet 15 points. Junior guard Joey Brooks also provid­ed an unexpected offensive boost for the Irish with eight points in the second half.
“From the first exhibi­tion, it’s amazing the im­provement [Grant made] and that is what excites me about our team,” Brey said. “At times he car­ried us and he had a few big-time plays for us. And Joey was fabulous. He made big de­fensive plays and he took his shots at the right time. His overall game was flow­ing.”
Notre Dame sealed the game with a 22-7 run late in the sec­ond half af­ter the Delta Devils came within two points with 10:36 left in the game. Sparks flew with 6:12 left in the game when Missis­sippi Valley State coach Sean Woods was ejected after arguing a blocking call and throwing his jacket into the second row behind the Delta Dev­ils’ bench.  Atkins proceed­ed to sink four-straight free throws, contributing to the 24 free throws made by the Irish throughout the course of the game.
The Irish, meanwhile, will have a quick turnaround with three games in five days, starting with a veteran Detroit team Monday night led by upstart sophomore guard Ray McCallum Jr. 
“This is a Big East game [on Monday], I tell our guys,” Brey said. “I thought [on Sat­urday] our fans were great and our students were great. But I really hope on Monday night, as much as we deliv­ered, it looks more like the last time we played here on a Monday night against Vil­lanova. We really need the place to be electric and we need the help of our sixth man to beat Detroit. They are old, they have played to­gether and they are physical. This is their year to get the [NCAA] bid.”
Notre Dame will take on the Titans (1-0) at 9 p.m. to­night at the Purcell Pavilion in a game that will be tele­vised on ESPNU.

our back, I hoped we would have pressed more, and looked to get more scoring opportunities,” Waldrum said. “I didn’t think we took advantage of it when it was at our back. And I thought that was the difference.”
Held score­less in the first half, the Irish were then tasked with keeping Illi­nois off the board in the second half. That strat­egy failed just five minutes af­ter the break though, when Illini junior midfielder Niki Read found space and floated in a shot from 30 yards out that caught the wind and looped over Irish junior goalkeeper Maddie Fox into the back of the net.
“Obviously [Read] was un­marked through midfield,” Waldrum said. “I don’t know if we turned it over and just lost her or if someone failed in their marking assignment, but she smacked a great shot with the wind at her back, and that’s one of the things we talked about at halftime is that we can’t allow them time and space to shoot with the wind at their back.”
Down a goal, with the wind in their face and potentially 40 minutes away from the end of their season, the Irish cranked up their level of play to try and get an equal­izer. Waldrum pulled out a defender and went into an aggressive 3-4-3 formation, which created some chanc­es for the offense, but also forced Fox to make a num­ber of diving saves to keep Notre Dame alive.
“We just needed the goal,” Wal­drum said. “Once they scored so early, it didn’t matter if we lost 5-0, we needed to get the goal. That’s why we went to three backs, tried to push another player forward and hope we could create some­thing. When we went to that we knew we were going to be exposed, and Maddie kept us in it. She did her part, the rest of us just didn’t do our part. She was outstanding today.”
In the end though, the Illi­ni were able to hold on to the final buzzer, with the one breakthrough just enough to send them on to Oklaho­ma State for the Round of 32. For the Irish, it was an­other instance of coming so close and having periods of brilliance end in disappoint­ment.
“It’s kind of been the tale of our sea­son this year,” Wal­drum said. “We’ve been very up-and-down and again it was a day like that. I don’t think we cre­ated enough offensively all day, to be honest, whether we had the wind or we didn’t. It’s sad to have to play an important game like this in the field conditions that it was, but it’s not an excuse for us losing because both teams had to play with it and against it. We just weren’t good enough on the day.”
With the season end­ing loss, the team now can both look back to one of the best four-year runs in school his­tory, and be­gin to look forward to another very talented and experienced squad return­ing next year.
“You always hate to lose a senior class, and like I told them, I’m really proud of what they’ve accomplished,” Waldrum said. “I mean, they’ve had three final fours and a national championship and one of the most winning senior classes that we’ve had in a long time. It’s sad to see them go. I’m really proud of them, because they mean a lot. I’m very attached to them, especially the Texas kids who I’ve known since they were really young grow­ing up. 
“But I’m excited, you know. It’s a good young group of players coming back who were really, relatively young as a team this year. We’ll be back.”

kneeing given at the 12:11 mark of the third period. Though the Nanooks did not score on that power play, Johns was happy to produce the game-winning goal after putting his team in a diffi­cult situation.
“Taking a five-minute ma­jor is obviously something I don’t want to do,” Johns said. “But that’s what this team’s about. One guy makes a mistake and 26 guys have my back.”
Though the goal from Johns was the only one in the third period, the first pe­riod marked a differ­ent story, as turnovers and odd-man rushes con­sumed the first 20 min­utes. Alaska and Notre Dame com­bined for seven goals in the first period — in­cluding a hat trick by Alaska soph­omore cen­ter Cody Ku­nyk — with the Nanooks leading 4-3 at the first in­termission, which frustrated Irish coach Jeff Jackson.
“I don’t know if I’ve seen our team start like that in six years,” Jackson said. “It was probably entertaining for the fans [but] it wasn’t too entertaining for me.”
Sophomore goaltender Ste­ven Summerhays replaced junior starting goaltender Mike Johnson at the inter­mission because of a rough outing for Johnson and the need for a defensive spark, Jackson said. Summerhays responded strongly, finish­ing the game with 16 saves.
“When you make a switch, that’s what you hope hap­pens,” Jackson said. “You hope that there’s a response and I thought Steven did a good job of responding and that’s good, because he hasn’t played in two or three weeks. It’s really important to have two goaltenders.”
The Irish tied the game early in the second period, partially due to the unique design of the Compton Fam­ily Ice Arena’s rink. With the penalty boxes next to the Irish bench instead of across the ice, Maday hopped straight on the ice after Johns was released from a penalty and skated into the offensive zone. Maday re­ceived a pass from sopho­more right wing Mike Voran and buried the tying goal. Johns’ goal in the third period then won the game.
The Irish also won a nail bit­er Satur­day with a 3-2 over­time victory when Maday scored with 41 seconds left in the extra period. Maday executed a give-and-go with sophomore center T.J. Tynan and scored with a quick shot through the five-hole of Alaska junior goaltender Steve Thomp­son, resulting in Maday’s fourth goal of the season and Tynan’s 16th assist. The play was a result of a quick change in lines from Jack­son.
“[Jackson] made a late ad­justment, throwing me out there with Tynan and [soph­omore forward] Anders Lee,” Maday said. “I just wanted to get the puck to the net and try to create some opportu­nities for the other linemates and luckily, it went in.”
The Irish got off to a more composed start Saturday, as Alaska only managed five shots in the first pe­riod on Sum­merhays, who started his third game of the season.
“[Sum­merhays] finished the game [Fri­day night,]” Jackson said of his decision to start Sum­merhays. “I wanted to give Mike a break in the next few weeks anyway, because we have so many games in a two-week period.”
Notre Dame opened the scoring with 3:33 left in the second pe­riod when Lee deflect­ed a pass from fresh­man right wing Austin Wuthrich over Thomp­son’s shoul­der. Though Alaska scored two goals in less than a min­ute early in the third to take a 2-1 lead, the Irish responded when Tynan scored his third goal of the season with 4:19 left in reg­ulation. Johns shot the puck from the point, which was deflected to Lee. Lee then attempted an off-balance shot toward the goal, which appeared to be heading wide of the net before Tynan got a stick on it to send the game to overtime.
Though both games re­sulted in wins this weekend, Jackson said he was much more pleased with the Irish’s play Saturday.
“I thought we played a much better game,” Jackson said. “We really did a great job with the puck.”
The Irish are next in ac­tion at the Compton Family Ice Arena on Tuesday at 7:05 p.m. when they take on No. 5 Western Michigan.
