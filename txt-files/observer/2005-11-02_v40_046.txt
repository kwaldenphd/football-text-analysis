NO ratios differ from national gender gap 
Females comprise 44 percent of University student body but 57 percent and rising of college students nationwide 
By KATIE PERRY 
Assistant News Editor 
Morn than 57 pereent of college stu­dents nationwide are female -a num­ber that is expected to grow in the com­ing years -but despite yearly increas­es in the proportion of women at the llnivorsity, thn current 56 to 44 percent male-female ratio starkly contrasts the 
U.S. trnnd. 
Women comprise 57.6 pereent of col­lege students nationwide, according to an Oet. 20 USA Today artide. The 43 to 57 percent male-female ratio grossly diverges from 1960s and 1970s statis­tics -30 years ago women eonstituted 45 percent of university students in the United States. 
The eurrent gap shows no signs of narrowing. The U.S. Department of Edueation estimated that in less than ten years, women will earn 60 percent of bachelor's degrees and more than half of graduate degrees nationwide. 
Gender and enrollment at NO 
The Office of Institutional Hesearch said, this semester 56 percent of Notre Dame students -graduate and under­graduate -were male and 44 percent were female, a 13 percent shift in the favor of men from national enrollment averages. 
Sociology professor Mark Gunty, who teaches a course on the sociology of masculinity, said in his understanding, Notre Dame's ratio is based on the spaee available in residence halls and is not a function of the applicant pool per se. 
"The [ratio! at ND is artificial, just as it is at most private, residential-based colleges and universities, especially those of a more selective nature,"

OIT to initiate wireless authentication soon 
By ALICIA CONLEY 
News Writer 
The Office of Information Technologies (OIT) will soon require students, faculty and staiT who want to access Nomad, the University's wireless Internet net­work, to provide their Notre Dame user name and password in ordnr to log on. 
"It's one of a series of steps that we're taking to help secure Notrn Dame computer resourees better. It helps to ensure that only authorized Notre Dame users arn accessing our network," Katie Hose, project leader at OIT, said Tuesday. 
Without wireless authentication, Hose said it is very easy for an unauthorizod porson to aeeess the University network. 
The problem with this is "they're using rnsourees the University has dosignatml fiJr fac­ulty, stall' and studenL<>. This can cause excessive traflic that can impact authorized users," she said.

Notre Dame football players may not be thn only ones exhausted at the end of game days.

The eflort of SMC student-ath­letes helps finance the teams' expenses and provides a unique bonding opportunity, Kachmarik said. 
To remain eonsistent with other parking options in the arna, Saint Mary's charges $15 per car and raises between $4,000 and $10,000 per week­end, Kachmarik said. The money from nach weekend goes into a general fund until the end of the football season, when each team is given an appropri­

and need suitable punching bags to Editor take our aggres­sion out on. 
One campus issue right now is the seemingly troubled relations between South Bend residents and Notre Dame students. Two students were quoted saying some less-than-nice things about South Bend residents, and the city itself, that have created somewhat of a stir. OK, so two students don't think highly of South Bend residents, in particular those of economic stand­ing less than that of the average Notre Dame student; does that mean that the majority of the student body feels the same way? 
We're talking about the same stu­dent body that spends huge amounts of time working in not only the South Bend community, but also with the people of Appalachia and urban Chicago, among other places of dire need. The perception of snobbish, elit­ist students is one that doesn't seem to mesh with reality. I'm not saying everyone is fantastically unprejudiced and perfectly moral, but I hardly think that it is fair to say a large fraction of students are just downright awful big­ots. 
Also in the cam pus scandal mill is a joke/insight about race relations made at a student stand-up comedy event last Thursday. Several students walked away from the event with a sour taste in their mouth, feeling that the joke was intolerant and that those who laughed at the joke were just as bad. Some feel this is telling of the campus climate -that it proves a good portion of our student body is insensitive and intolerant. 
Alright, someone made social com­mentary about race relations at Notre Dame in the context of the recent passing of Rosa Parks -does that make the student body intolerant and racist? I certainly think not. This isn't even considering whether or not the joke, and by extension its author, was racist. 
I'd bet my life that if you surveyed every single student, not one would say that they disagreed with Rosa Parks' actions. So apparently we have another clash between perception and reality. 
It's going to be alright, people. People will say things you don't agree with or just flat out don't like. Heck, this is college. Cool down a little and you'll see that not everyone is out to offend you. Once the smoke settles, you'II see that you were making a big deal out of something that never should have been an issue. 
Besides, there are bigger debates to be had, like on Supreme Court nomi­nations and foreign conflicts.

Parking

ate percent of the profits. 
"The number of shifts a team works is divided by the number of total shifts available, producing the total profit," cross-country coach Jackie Bauters said. "For example, if [members of the cross country team] work one of 12 shifts, we'll get 1/12 of the total profit combined." 
The team uses this money to pay the salaries of assistant coaches, fund training trips and buy extra equipment. 
"All the time we put into park­ing seems worth it to me because everything we need is paid for, whieh relieves stress," said junior Amanda Trevino, a member of the Saint Mary's softball team. 
Junior Stefanie Broderick, a member of the SMC basketball team, also said although parking may be frustrating at times, the monetary reward makes it worth­while. 

"Our team never looks forward to doing the football parking, but we realize that every team has to do it, and it is a major source of fundraising," she said. 
Not only do the teams benefit financially, many athletes said the experience provides them with an opportunity to bond. Trevino and Broderick both said they have always worked with at least one other teammate, which has helped prevent boredom. 
"At times, parking is a lot of fun," Trevino said. "We get to be loud and jump around in order to get people to come in." 
Broderick also said she enjoyed the company of her teammates. 
"Having the whole team doing it together is nice -it makes the weather bearable and the time pass more quickly," she said. 
A typical morning of parking consists of holding signs on Route 33, collecting money and directing traffic on Saint Mary's campus. The teams usually begin their shift at 6:30 a.m. and continue until half an hour before the game begins or until the lots are full. 
Kachmarik said space is never a problem and teams are usually on duty for the full seven to eight­hour shift. 
In the past, teams have cut this shift in half to give the athletes a break. This was not, however, an option for the women's basketball team this year. 
"This year [the athletic teams] weren't able to do shifts," Broderick said. ''The basketball team had to do the entire 6:30 
a.m. to 1:30 p.m. shift, and it was tiring." 
Trevino has also supervised parking and said she knows the frustration of the long hours. 
"The experience of directing traffic can be draining. The morn­ing can go so slowly sometimes," she said. 
But Trevino said the monotony of parking is alleviated by the variety of people who come to campus. 
"The people who come to park are generally respectful and appreciate what we do. You get to see a lot of different people who talk to us about the team," she said. 
The student athletes must also brave ·the elements and continue their shift no matter the weather. At the start of the football season, teams often must supervise park­ing in the intense heat. As the sea­son progresses, however, the ath­letes must bundle up for the cold -and sometimes snowy-condi­tions. 
The cross-country team will be supervising the parking for the first time in mid-November. 
"We're working a cold week­end, so [the athletes] are a little worried about freezing," said Bauters. 
To make the weather easier to endure, the athletic department provides water, juice and hot cocoa. Trevino said while bever­ages are always on hand, access to food is limited unless the ath­letes bring their own. 
Bauters said she will work alongside her athletes during their shift, just as many coaches do, to show support for the team. This involvement helps build team morale and gives the athletes an opportunity to bond with their coaches in a different setting, Bauters said. 
"What [parking] really does is bring our individual teams and the athletic department as a whole together in a common cause," Broderick said.

equality, peace and higher educa­tion. 
"lie has been asked to resolve the greatest social issues of our times . . . He was president of the University of Notre Dame for 35 years, has kept his door open to its students for 61 years and has received 150 honorary degrees from universities all over the world," the film said. "Yet when asked to give an account of him­self, he chose but one word: priest." 

The comprehensive documen­tary features llesburgh's own commentary, photos from his young life and at Notre Dame, as well as footage from historical moments in which he participated. 
More intimate and lesser-known sides of Hesburgh are also shown, including his love of flying and his friendship with former University Executive Vice President Father Edmund "Ned" Joyce. 
A highlight of the film is the inclusion of interviews with Joyce, who suffered a fatal stroke on May 2, 2004 at Holy Cross House on campus. 
Near the end of his life, Joyce lay dying in the company of lifelong friend and longtime colleague Hesburgh, who administered last rites to the ailing priest. 
Hesburgh was pleased with the film and said it was one of four documentaries on his life. 
"I think it was extremely well done, and I think they didn't spare anything. They took shots of Jerusalem ... they took shots of Washington, D.C.," Hesburgh said. "And then they have shots of cam­pus, which is probably the best of all. 
"You get a sense watching it that it's very professional. They covered all the points," he said. "It will be good for Notre Dame, I hope." 
The network premiere culmi­nates a five-year project by Family Theater Productions, a Catholic media ministry in Hollywood founded in 194 7 and sponsored by the Congregation of Holy Cross. 
Father Willy Raymond, execu­tive producer and a former Holy Cross Seminary student at Notre Dame, said Family Theater sought to put together a thorough look at Hesburgh's inspirational leader­ship that could be widely viewed. 
"I really hope that !viewers] will take away a couple of messages, but one especially, in the words of Father Ted, is that every single person can make a difference in this world," Raymond said. 
Hesburgh's invocation of the Holy Spirit in times of confusion or discouragement also provides a powerful witness to viewers and the Notre Dame community, Raymond said. 
"I hope that the generation of students who are at the University now know what a towering figure Father Ted was and is," he said. 
"God, Country, Notre Dame" will air at 12 p.m. Sunday. 
The DVD includes an introduc­tion by Raymond and an informal conversation between llesburgh and students. It is available at the Hammes Bookstore.

network has been temporarily rescinded while OIT engineers work with a software vendor to correct performance-related issues." 
"There are a variety of applica­tions on a person's computer that try to connect to the network," Rose said. "Some are generating so much traffic trying to talk to the server, hitting the authentication service so frequently and so hard, that the server couldn't handle it." 

Rose said an error arose that OIT had not found after nine months of testing. 
"We obviously couldn't keep it in place while people were denied access, so we rolled it back," Rose said. 
Rose said she did not know when the patch from Roving Planet, the company that provides the "software and architecture service" to fix the problem would be put in place, and she did not know when the authentication service would start again. 
OIT has been setting up the authentication service for over a year, she said. 
"We've been running it in a pilot mode since January of this year. We've done a lot of testing and work to ensure that we could pro­vide anyone an easy way to access the network while still requiring them to authenticate." 
When the program begins again, there will be two ways for students to sign into the service. One way is to "open up a Web browser and sign in with a user name and password," Rose said. The other way is for students to "set up a connection to connect in the background," she said, so stu­dents don't have to put their user name and password in every time. 
Rose said this connection is called an 802.1x and is "a stan­dard that is used for authenticat­ing network connections. It is a lit­tle more involved to set up, but ends up being a little more user friendly." 
OIT needed to gain approval from the University administration to set up the authentication sys-tern, Rose said. 
"Our [Chief Information Officer] and Chief Technology Officer work with a variety of officials in the University to keep them up to date on a variety of projects that we're working on," she said. 
Several other universities around the country also have wireless authentication. Among these are Baylor University, the University of Iowa and Texas Tech.

Abortion

Voice, the Department of Sociology, the Program in Gender Studies, the 1-Iesburgh Program in Public Service and the Gender Relations Center in an attempt to foster respectful dialogue between pro-life and pro-choice advocates. 
"At this institution, we grapple with many important questions," Redfield said. "Our goal is to honor the humanity on both sides of the debate, to understand each ot~e:, to ~.nderstand the scope of thiS ISSUe. 
The event featured a faculty panel of Kathleen Cummings, associate director of the Cushwa Center lor the Study of American Catholicism; Teresa Phelps, pro­fessor at the Notre Dame Law 
· School and fellow of the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies; and Todd Whitmore, associate professor of Theology and director of the Program in Catholic Social Teaching. "This is one of the very, very few times I have heard anything like this at Notre Dame ... Both the pro-lil'e and pro-choice posi­tions define both life and choice 

in narrow ways," said Phelps. "Instead of trying to preserve or overturn Roe vs. Wade, we should all work to reduce the number of abortions. Many times in the debate, either the fetus or the woman has the rights, and this either/or dichotomy is ill­described." 
All three panelists focused on what society should do in order to better care for pregnant women. 
Cummings told a story from her early years of teaching when one of her students had an abortion because she had too little support and resources. Cummings said her student may not have felt so helpless if the institution had been like the "Dream Campus," a vision by Feminists for Life, a group containing both pro-life and pro-choice advocates. 
"The goal of the Dream Campus is to reduce the number of abortions by providing parents with resources," said Cummings. "On the Dream Campus, there would be pregnancy and parent­ing resource centers, family housing, scholarship funds for parents, cry rooms in the library, and an accommodating class schedule." 
Whitmore spoke of the Nurturing Network, a nonprofit program started in 1986 that also helps pregnant women and new mothers with medical costs. In addition to financial support, pregnant women need to be socially accepted, Whitmore said. 
"Catholic women who have abortions are seven percent more likely than other women to say they are having the abortion because they are afraid of retri­bution from others finding out they had sex," said Whitmore. "This raises questions about whether a punitive attitude toward sex raises the number of abortions. Fear of retribution from having sex outside marriage drives women to commit an even greater sin." 
Phelps said that besides finan­cial and health issues, at the heart of the abortion debate is morality. 
"We say we value babies, but as a society, we don't demon­strate that," Phelps said. "We make it so difficult for women who are pregnant. We should not tolerate society's not taking care of women." 
"Is 'common ground' possible? Frankly, it's all we've got," said Phelps.

Japan expected to end U.S. beef ban 
Associated Press 

TOKYO -The risk of mad cow infection in U.S. beef is nearly as low as Japanese beef if proper pre­cautions are taken, a government panel ruled Monday, a decision expected to lead to an easing of an import ban that has caused ten­sions with Washington. 
The panel on mad cow disease forwarded their report to the appropriate ministries for a month of hearings before rendering a deci­sion on the ban, which was imposed in December 2003 after the discov­ery of the first U.S. ease of the bovine illness. 
"Based on the assumption that all precautions are taken as requested, we consider the difference in risk between u:s. and Japanese beef to be extremely small," panel chair­man Yasuhiro Yoshikawa said, reading the report to his col­leagues. 
Media reports say the decision will lead to the resumption of imports of beef products from U.S. cows younger than 21 months old as early as the end of this year. No case of mad cow has ever been dis­covered in animals of that age. 
Before the ban, Japan was the most lucrative overseas market for 
U.S. bnef. and an increasingly impatient Washington has pushed hard for a resumption of the trade. 
Last week, 21 U.S. senators intro­duced legislation that would force President Bush to impose tariff's on Japan if it does not lift tlu1 ban. 
After lengthy negotiations, the 
U.S. and Japanese governments this year agreed that Tokyo would allow the import of U.S. beef from tho younger cows. The Japanese side, however, said approval was needed by the Food Safety Commission. 
Still, Japanese consurn1-1rs remain wary of American bnel', with rneent polls showing that nearly 70 per­cent opposed lifting the ban. 
Further dnlays in ov(~rl.urning the ban could eause morn tensions with the United States ahead of a Nov. 15-16 visit by Bush.

Tfl~ as 11 r y Secreta r y J o h n Snow said lw would study the report. issued by the l'rosidnnt.'s Advisory Panni on FPdnral Tax Hnf'orm, and hopnd to prnsont formal rnc­ommotHlations to President Bush Ialor this ynar. 
"Tlwsn are hold rnl~ommen­dations." Snow said. "Thnsn an~ recomnwndations that will rhallimgo orthodoxy in a lot of ways on tax policy." 
T h n nino mcnn b n r s of' the commission said kny rnl~om­mendations would lw unpopu­lar. 
"Many stand waiting to defend tlwir breaks, doduc­tions and loopholns, and to dnf'nat our oiTorts," the group said in a ll'ttor to Snow. 
Marginal tax ratns would bn lowor for individuals and busi­nnsses undnr two alternative tax systnms endorsed by the panni. 
Both would eliminate most dNluctions and credits in an niTort to simplify tremendously complicated calculations. Tho second or the two tax systems aims to reduce taxes on sav­ings and investments made by businesses and families. 
In place of current tax breaks, the panel would create a few tax credits and three savings accounts that they said would encourage homeowner­ship, charitable giving and sav­ing while also supporting lower income workers and their fam­ilins. 
The panel sharply criticized lawmaknrs' tendency to use the tax code to promote their policy agendas, noting there had been 15,000 changes in tax laws since the last major rnwrite in 1986. 
Snow and tho panel's mnm­bnrs urged lawmakers and tax­payers to look at the package as a wholn, not to concentrate sol1dy on benefits lost. 
Very quickly, however, the panel heard criticism of their dncisions to limit or scrap deductions for mortgage intor­est. health insurance premi­ums and state and local taxes. 
"Unfortunately, President Bush's tax panel is a Trojan horse, using so-called simplifi­cation to cut taxes for the wealthy while increasing taxes 
for middle-class families," said 
llousn Minority Leader Nancy 
Pnlosi, D-Calif'. 
Son. Jim DeMint, H-S.C., said the recommendations didn't go far tHHntgh. "Wo nend compre­lwnsivP rofonn that will make 1\nwrica the best plac~e in tho world to invest and do busi­ness," he said. 
"It's hard to see how they overeome some of the intru­sions onto really pretty sacred tPrritory," said Clint Streteh, dirnetor of tax poliey for Deloitte Tax. 
Mark Weinberger, a former Treasury Dnpartment official who is now 1\mnricas Vien Chairman at Ernst & Young, said successful tax reform rnquires taxpaynrs to look at thn lwnel'its of any new tax systnm. not just the costs. 
"Tax reform is all about tradn-ol'fs. It's all about win­ners and losers," he said. "I think tax reform is absolutely going to happen. the question is just when." 
Specifically, the .panel said the mortgage interest deduc­tion should be replaced with a credit worth 15 percent of mortgage interest paid, to spread the benefit to more homeowners of modest incomes. The panel also rec­ommended lowering the $1 million limit on mortgages eli­gible for the tax break to the average regional price of hous­ing, ranging from $227,000 to $412,000. 
Tax breaks for mortgages on second homes and home equity loans would be eliminated. 
In another major change, taxpayers could purchase health insurance using untaxed money up to about $5,000 for an individual and $11,500 for a family, a change that caps currently unlimited breaks but would create a new tax break for those who do not get health insurance through work. 
Both proposed tax systems would abolish the alternative minimum tax, a levy originally drafted to prevent wealthy individuals from escaping taxa­tion but increasingly reaching into the middle class. 
Under one plan, individuals would pay no tax on dividends paid by U.S. companies and exclude 75 percent of their capital gains from taxation. Under the second plan. all investment income would be taxed at 15 percent. 
Using a Treasury Department model that's contested by some lawmakers, the panel said both tax alternatives would spur economic growth and increase capital accumulation.

"You may go on and do so." With those words, Rosa Parks, a 42-year­old African American seamstress, lit a fire that sought to consume the racist environment of Montgomery, Ala. 
Last week we lost a national treasure. Rosa Parks is a popular and power­ful symbol of courage and non­violent action. ller refusal to move to the back of the bus put a face on the shameful segrega­tion polices of the American South. Now with her gone, the pundits have gone to work trying to derive some greater lesson from her life. True, Parks was an active member in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and served as her chapter's secretary. True, Parks had attended a training prior to her arrest that fortified her for taking direct non-violent action. True, she was a part of a community organizing for civil rights, and per­haps without that preparedness, Parks' actions would not have been the springboard for the protests and mobilizations to follow. Yet, holding her up as a hero is neither inappro­priate nor misplaced. · 
Rosa Parks was a leader. lim· action was courageous. In those times, blacks were treated as chil­dren and whites understood them­selves as smarter, superior and more powerful. The word of a bus driver to a seamstress was as good as law. So on that bus and in the news reports, Rosa Parks refusing to move from her seat and submitting to arrest was a heroic and gutsy move. 
Rosa Parks was a part of a growing movement, but certainly not an automaton. People hold that within collective action, people stop think­ing and acting for themselves. On the contrary, people within community

Comedy a useful tool 
I saw the "Jockular" comic that Kimberly Baker was so offended by in her Nov. 1 Letter to the Editor; yes, I am a woman. and I very much do not want to be reduced to an "instrument for the pleasure of I sex] organs." However. I found the "Jockular" comic funny anyway. Why'? Because as any Notre Dame student who has attended a llallowcen party on or off campus knows, it's not too far from the truth. Comedy helps us to realize how ridiculous we nmlly can be sometimes. That's part of what makes things funny and also part of its value in society. If The Observer printed an article about how 60 percent of Notre Dame girls plan to dress as a slutty something-or-other for Halloween, it wouldn't be nearly as striking as a comie taking that faet to the extreme and pointing out just how ridiculous it is to be a slutty blender, or yes, even a slutty Helen Keller. Similarly, Ashley Williams seemed to miss that point in her Oct. 31 letter. Comedy can sometimes be one of the most

organizations should be given strength of support to act individual­ly on their anger and stand for them­selves. There is no 'T' in "team," but there is a pretty central one in "win." We need leaders to show us the way, guide us by example and show us what is possible. Rosa Parks suffered the daily stab of discrimination and dehumanization from Jim Crow as much as anyone else in the move­ment. A black life was worth nothing to soeiety. Hosa Parks had her own personal reasons apart from the movement not to move to the back of the bus, so we should not diminish her action as bold.

effective tools to persuade people that things they don't even think about-wlwre they sit in the dining hall, what they dress up as for Halloween -can aetually impact soci­ety in a negative way. It allows one to make a point without the potential ugliness of saying directly, "Your Halloween costume is slutty, and as such, degrades all women." If Baker wants to berate someone for the objectification of women and. apparently, the destruction of humanity, she should have walked around on I lalloween and personally reprimanded every girl in a French maid's outfit­although that would make her a lot less popular than the people who just decided to hand out candy.

Ordinance goes too far 
Off-campus policies unfair 
Whonver said South Bond residents are "unndueat­nd, low-aspiring and low-achieving" obviously madn a dumb commnnt. But as both a student at Notre I>anw and a'i a South Bond resident, I disagmn with tho mood of'tho opinion lntters that appeared in Monday's Tho Obsnrvnr and hopn they will change ovnr Limo. Notre Dame students who choose to live ofr·nunpus arn too oflnn portrayed as dnviant villains who just want to go crazy and have ridiculous par­tins. WPII, thnsn am my obsnrvations from living on·­mmpus this year, which I think ean explain where sonw of thn ofl"-mmpus student.<> arc eoming from in thnir complaints about thn nnw dty ordinancns. So far, my house and the two houses of friends next to nw havn had two run-ins with the police. We have reeniwd a notice of abatnmnnt and pretty much can­not have a party again unlnss wn want a supposed fi~lony. This is what I know of our current neighbor­hood rnlations: 
I I Wn are on good rnlations with our neighbors, talk to thmn every oncn in awhile, nven had a bar­lwqun with a fi1w of thorn. A !i1w days ago I was <L<>knd, "Arnn't you gonna havn people over this wnnkmul'?'' A fnw neighborhood kids have sometimes playnd filotball or ba<>ketball with us as wnll. 
2) Whnn I talknd to policn, I was told that no one within a one-or two-block radius has ever spedfical­ly complainnd about onn of our parties. 
Thn point I am trying to get across is that thn stu­dnnt.'i that I live with are rnspectable kids trying to IL<>similate into the South Bend community. One party at our house wa<> admittedly too big, but even when wn had 15-20 people at our house, all inside, three policn cars came by and stayed parked oul<>ide our housns for a decent amount of time. 
It might bn interesting to note that not everyone in my hometown of South Bnnd ha..<; the best interest.<; of Notrn I >arne student'> in mind either. Not everyone ofl"-eampus enjoys getting their cars broken into or mnstantly being confronted to give money for a ear that h<L'> broken down eight nights in a row. Notre Dame neighbors of mine thought their house was broken into after they went to bed and their alarm sounded. The police responded pretty non-chalantly. After the resident'> gave the police a description of the person that only 15 minutes earlier had suspi­ciously stopped at their door and given his name, the police acknowledged the identity of the suspicious man and told the female residents that he wa..'i harm­less, but to eall if anything else happened. 
I realize that these arc isolated eases and that we ultimatnly ehose to live ofl"-campus with South Bend resident.<; and arc dearly responsible for that deei­sion. In the case of the Thrtle Crnek evictions, howev­er, I think that it is terrible that people were evicted without warning. In apartments that are 99 pereent students, where many underago students go to party, it seems hard to believe that one party should lead to immediate eviction. This L'i especially true when there has beon no precedent of this action in the p<L'>L A notke of abatement docs not finn the property owners. in tl1is ea'>e, Turtle Creek. Therefore, eviction without a sneond occurrence seems pretty ruthless to me, especially considering Thrtlc Creek exists in it<; current form only because of Notre Dame students. 
Finally, I think it is important for Notre Dame to consider the current plight of the student. More and more student<; are going to live o!l"-carnpus, not only because of the rules found in each dorm, but also because of Notre Dame's burgeoning student popula­tion. If off-campus locations are going to continue to become more stringent in regard to social activities, more and more off-campus problems.fJssues are going to occur in the future. Notre Dame either needs more centralized off-campus housing or they need to work with South Bend to create student apartments that allow a reasonable amount of social activity. It is short-sighted and naive to think that college students are not going to drink, espcdally those who are 21 and living off-campus. Until this simple fact is real­ized, no solutions can be seriously proposed.

Are we ND? 
I especially enjoy the football game cheer in which the cheerleaders direct the entire stadium to echo "We Are NO" around the bowl because it reminds me of thn drive to my first home game. As we were driving down the inter­state, I couldn't help but notice all the signs and flags hanging ofT of cars, vans and HVs, and written on many of them was that cheer. The cheer reflects the unity or this amazing institution, and over my past throe yoars hnre, that unity has shown itself time and time again. 
Since freshman year, I have been invited to New York City, the Jersey shore, Miami, San Diego, Philadelphia and Chicago, and each time I was able to stay in an ND alum or student's house, absolutely free of charge, without mooting the alum or parents of the student beforehand. I love how at home football games, there is always some tailgate of some friend to go to, and every ounce of food and drink is theirs to share. I love how when I graduate from this school, the simple fact that an ND class ring is on my finger could get me places others might better dnsnrvn. As stu­dents, we are privileged to attend Notre Dame, and it is our duty to continue that unity which has been built up over the past 100 years. 
With that said, it siekcns me that the unity this sehool thrives off of, the unity that makes Notre Dame separate from any other school, is being destroyed by the "they had it coming" and "it's not my problem" mentality found around campus after the eviction news. After reading my daily dose of Viewpoint, I became more angry by the deser­tion response than the simple fact that we are being target­ed by the city. I agree with upholding the law, but this ordi­nance takes that role too far. There is no unity in telling fellow students they had it coming; there is no unity in fur­getting this whole incident happened. Those six evicted students are more likely to feel a part of this school and more likely to contribute to its unity if we as a student body do not accept their over-punishment. Indifference toward and desertion of our fellow students is the best way to destroy the unity we have, so don't let it happen.

Making us think 
I wonder if Ashley Williams, the non-Catholic, minority, liberal-minded female who was outraged by the events sur­rounding her Halloween weekend !Oct. 31 Letter to the 1\ditorl. would laugh at a man falling on a banana peel. Would it matter if it were a white man or a black man? If we eannot control the bad things around us, the human con­dition forces us to laugh at them. To quote "Sullivan's Travels," a 1941 !ilm, from a time when few people were laughing, "There's a lot to be said for making people laugh. Did you know that that's all some people have? It isn't rnueh, but it's better than nothing in this cockeyed cara­van." 
A hurricane has no motivations and no targets. To impute such on an act of God is to try to understand the ineffable. I'm sure the students involved had no intention of mocking tlw gravn losses people suffered or the lives lost forever. Would you have been as upset if they had parodied the less recent tsunami or the Kashmiri earthquake? I think an earthquakn would be a hard costume to achieve, myself. 
As rngards Williams' eritique of the student stand-up show, I can only say as a former performer on the Legends Stagn that I not only find the joke she mentions funny, but highly topieal to the Notre Dame crowd. How many people have noted this snlf-segrcgation of the dining halls and won­dored why it exists? llow many people, conservative and lib­eral alike, have wondered if it is a sign of something wrong? 
By parodying the things we think are wrong in life, we are doing the work of comedy: Pointing out the silly stereotypes and habits of humanity to help wash them away. May we all be as bold as that comedian, to point out what each of us sons or saw every mealtime and bring it front and center. Thoso students, Williams, were laughing at their own condi­tion, knowing the awkwardness of a segregation they did not eroate and probably would not keep. Let yourself laugh along with them. Laughter is the best way to change a per­son's heart.

MOVIE REVIEWS 

Subpar 'Saw' sequel fails to deliver scares 
By VINCE LABRIOLA 
Scene Critic 

The obligatory sequel to one of the biggest horror sleeper hits since "The Blair Witch Project," the gory, stomach­turning spectacle "Saw II" is fun as a shallow, macabre Halloween treat, but fails to deliver enough creativity (and, strangely enough, violence) to stand up to its rather noteworthy predecessor. 
The reins handed over to first-time director Darren Lynn Bousman, "Saw II" goes through all the requisite motions to deliver an entertaining but creatively disappointing second meeting with the Jigsaw Killer. Shocking in its depictions of human mutilation and depravity, the original "Saw" was filmed on a bare­bones (no pun intended) budget truly nauseating moments that, by them­selves, deserve recognition. In particu­lar, the film exploits psychological fears of needles to great (and gruesome) effect -in short, "Saw II" is not a film for the squeamish or faint of heart. 
However, interestingly enough, the biggest problem with the film is how restrained it is with regards to the vio­lence displayed onscreen. In a film such as this, where violence is pushed to the forefront of the experience, it is strange and anticlimactic to see that several of the deaths are left off-screen, and when a killing does take place front and cen­ter, the result is largely unimaginative, given horror-film standards. Simply put, "Saw II" does not deliver on its promise of the gore that was so shocking in the original. It isn't depraved enough. 
Part of this may

Thank Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher for turning society on to the whole "older woman, younger man" thing. 
In Ben Younger's "Prime," Uma Thurman plays the part of Rafi, a 37 year-old divorcee whose biological clock is tick-tick-ticking. Having recently left a nine-year marriage, she is more desperate than ever for the ful­fillment she believes can only come from the newness of a baby. Justifiably eager to move on with her life, Rafi falls quickly for the attention of David, the younger guy, played by hunky new­comer Brian Greenberg. David, just about as cute as can be, proves to real­ly be just a boy, as he is nearly 14 years her junior. 
be her son. Yet aside from being her good little Jewish boy, David also hap­pens to be a free spirited artist with eyes wide open. His romantically rebel­lious streak finds him caught up in a deep infatuation with Rafi, which quickly transgresses into a whirlwind relationship that is both exciting and suspenseful for the viewer. Thurman gets most of the credit for this though, as there is something genuinely intriguing about her middle-aged char­acter. 
Where Thurman provides the perfect dramatic performance, Streep adds the priceless humor. Caught between a relationship with her patient and her only son, Lisa faces a strenuously sen­timental and ethical burden. The thought of her son finding love in a non-Jewish woman turns out to be the most traumatic thing that could hap­
pen in her life.

for romance, especially given David's age and slight immaturity. Desperate for guidance, she confides everything to her zany psychiatrist Dr. Lisa Mertzger (played by always-outstanding Meryl Streep). Lisa urges Rafi to go ahead and have some fun with David, as it is probably no more than a harmless fling. 
The film's previews have already given away the twist. Steep's character soon discovers that Rafi's new sexual­ly-invigorating companion happens to 
she brings an amazing comedic performance to this protective motherly turmoil. 
Outside of the expected lovey-dovey type scenes, there is just enough come­dy from other supporting characters to keep the movie interesting. For instance, what would a young girl liv­ing in New York City be without her stereotypical gay friends? Rafi's closest friends, a couple of trendy homosexual guys, are more like her family, as she depends on them for advice and occupants bleeding out of every orifice on their bodies within two short hours. 
Scary, but not as scary as the more vis­ceral torture devices present in "Saw." So, even though Jigsaw is in the custody of the police, he holds the trump card. Scenes of violence ensue within the house, inter-cut with the bloated and overly-faux philosophical ramblings of Jigsaw on his past, his present and why he kills so sadistically. Unfortunately, the audience never really cares, given the heavy-handed and illogical way said information is presented. 
People die, tremendous amounts of blood are shed, and yet, by the film's quizzical and convoluted finish, the question that begs to be asked is this ­why so uninspired? Are nerve gas and knife fights, guns and baseball bats the best the creators of "Saw" could come up with for their sequel? 
Not smart enough to be "Silence of the Lambs," nor grizzly enough to be "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," "Saw II" aims too high and fails in its most impor­tant goal -delivering scares. Make sure you pay the matinee price or just rent the original.

approval of her young lover. 
On David's side is probably the most hilarious character in the movie. Morris, played by Jon Abrahams, is a complete buffoon, as he gets his kicks by throwing cream pies in the faces of women who will not give him a second date. 
Finally, there are David's bickering grandparents/"roommates" who are just so cute they can't be anything but loveable. 
All in all, the plot is less predictable than it seems. The ways in which things play out are less conventional than other traditional romantic come­dies -it has a little bit of an edge. Most of the actors step up to playing characters that are refreshingly life­like. For those looking for light hearted laughter and quirky romance, or for fans of Thurman and Streep, "Prime" will likely not disappoint.

Up-and-down season still valuable for Irish 
The Irish could never quite put this season on cruise control. 

There was always another road­block in the way, another detour or bottleneck. It was never a smooth ride for the 2005 Notre Dame team. 
But that doesn't matter now. 
The regular season is over, and the Irish head into the Big East Tournament with a new appreciation ofwhat they're playing for. 

Although the archives say this was a not-too-flashy 10-6-2 sea­son, the final numbers don't reflect the challenges the team faced and the hardships it overcame to enter the conference tournament with this kind of confidence. 
After losing what coach Bobby Clark described as "three ofthe best players ever to play in this program"-goalie Chris Sawyer and defenders Kevin Goldthwaite and Jack Stewart-Notre Dame could never hit its full stride. They rebounded from losses quickly with decisive wins but dropped several close games and struggled to find the net too often. 
But the games the Irish lost mean less than the players and leaders they found within them­selves.

Silently supportive 
Notre Dame's six seniors do not boast incredible stats, but they have set examples as hardworking leaders

Clark agroPs with Dalby's assess­ment. The coach has been extremely impressed with the way the tnan1's six seniors each led the Irish in dillcront ways. 
"This is a class that just has a great attitude," Clark said. "They've not always been up in the honors or the awards, but they've just had a fabulous attitude. They've come to practice every day with a smile on their face and they've worked extremely hard." 
Elected captain prior to the sea­son, Stephens has never starred for the Irish, but he has con­tributed all four years due to his heady play and tremendous effort. The midlielder has concentrated this year on trying to influence the way the younger members of the tnam approach the game.

Notre I>arne head coach Bobby Clark has loved Miehaud's profes­sional and unselfish approach to tlw sna<>on. 
"lie's been a backup, but he's bmm a terrific backup because he's driven all three of the younger goalkeept\rs and he's never once hung his head," Clark said. "lie's the leader of thnse goalkeepers." 
Michaud's story i'> an impressive, but not all that uneommon one. In fact, it seems to be part of a com­mon trend among the seniors on tllll 2005 team. 
This senior d!L'>S is not nearly as heralded or as successful on the field as last season's, which fea­turod three MLS draft picks. !loading into lhfl year, tri-captain John Stephens had played in the most games -40 -of any Irish senior.

said. "But you know there's more to being a cap­tain than on the field, so I'm trying to do everything I can to help this team get prepared for the game on and oiTthe field." 
Clark praised Rellas' ability to lead effectively without seeing much playing time. 
"Dales stuck with it and he still comes with a smile on his face," the coach said. "He has played a part by his attitude and his exam­ple." 
It is not just the captains who have served as exemplary leaders, but the rest of the seniors as well. Jon Mark Thompson had only played in four games coming into 2005. Nonetheless, junior midfield­or Nate Norman pointed to Thompson as a team-oriented player. 
"What's been so impressive about Jon Mark is that despite his lack of playing time, he's always done really well in practice and he's always one of the hardest workers on the team," Norman said. "And when he does get his chance, he always does something productive when he gets on the field." 
Clark knows that he can sub Thompson into the game at mid­field and not worry about a decrease in play, as evidenced by the senior's performance Saturday against Seton Hall. 
"I le came in on Saturday in the second half and gave us 25 min­utes and did a fabulous job," Clark said.

does," Dalby said. "He has set an example. Even if your stats aren't high, you can still really contribute to the team." 
Clark has a feeling, however, that Megna's goal scoring drought will soon come to an end. 
"Tony is still going to get a vital goal or two before the season is 
"He has just stepped up," Clark said. "Let's be honest, he's been one of our most influential play­ers." 
Crouse hopes the young players on the team who do not play early in their careers will learn from his experiences and remain motivat­ed. 
"It shows that working hard throughout your four years, you can go out and become what you want," Crouse said. "It shows that anybody can really just work hard and overcome some odds. It's nice to finally play and do what you love." 
If the Irish succeed in the Big East Tournament this week and advance to the NCAA Tournament, it might not be because of numer­ous big plays from seniors on the field. However far the team advances in postseason play, though, the six members of the senior class will have played a huge roll -in their on-the-field contributions, in their attitude oil' the field and in their mentorship of their teammates.

After leading the team in goals a year ago with five, the senior has fhlled to fmd the back of the net so over," Clark predicted. "He's going to pull something out of the hat before it all wraps up." 
Last but certainly not least among the seniors is defender Ben Crouse. Crouse saw very little 
action in his first two seasons, but gained some expe­rience early in 2004 when star defender Kevin Goldthwaite came down with an injury. Crouse has established himself as a starter in the back four and one of Notre Dame's most reliable play­ers.

By MARK BEMENDERFER 
As,istal\1 Scene Ediwr 
.John Carpenter was tlw mastnr of HOs horror. 1\xamples of' his dominanee are films as "Prince of' Darkness" and "The Thing," both masterph~ces in their respec­tive gnnrns within tho horror industry.

Hnprnsenting his second collaboration with tlw still young Jamie Lne Curtis, "The I;og" was a suspnnseful taln of rnvenge from bnyond tho gravn. In thn film, a northnrn California lishing town is visited by a particularly thick, unsnttling fog. As the plot unfolds. howevnr, it reveals that tho fog is hiding malevolent beings, ghosts from a lep11r colony the town was built upon ovnr I00 years ago. Tlu~y were wronged many years ago, and every hun­dred years they rnturn to take their rnvonge. 
Much of the fright the movie contains is from drawn out suspense. Carpenter uses music and shot composition expertly to eroate a forbidding, ominous atmosphere. 
The prevalence of the aforementionnd fog also creates a sense of daustrophobia for the audience, as it can never be sure what is hiddnn just out of view. The audi­ence will find itself asking, "was that a shadow, or was that a ghost?" 
The ghosts in the movie aren't the stan­dard Hollywood version either. These ghosts can be particularly gruesome, as they are more akin to zombies that actual ghosts. Instead of the glowing apparitions that arn nxpncted from Hollywood ghosts, the audience receives dripping, leprous moving corpses. 
Location helps the atmosphere. All of the settings have an ominous feel to them, even without being covered in fog. The fog-drenched old church, the lighthouse and the coastline itself all lend to a creepy, unsettling atmosphere. They arc so effec­tive, they should almost be considered characters within the film unto them­selves. 
All of the principal actors within the film do a commendable job of conveying the

Of course, by modern standards the movie hasn't stood well the test of time. The dated dothing may be enough to turn some people off, as well as the now diche special effects and scare techniques. What was once considered shocking has become diluted over the years through repetition, dulling much of the movie's impact. 
However, newcomers to the realm of horror will lind plenty to like within the film. The blood is non-existent, something that many people apprndate when wateh­ing a movie. The searns arn also not too cheap, as they are mostly drawn out through suspnnsn. 

Ilorror film hull's would also do well to wateh ''Thn Fog," as it has played an obvi­ous influence on modern horror. It was such an influential movie in its time that over twenty years later, a remake was created. 
But there's simply no boating the origi­nal when it comes to searns.

LEGENDS EVENT 

Coen Brothers' 'Fargo' will show at Legends 
By CHRIS MCGRADY Assistanr Scene Editor 
The human condition is often depict­ed in modern society as tragic and petty. "Fargo" is a masterful portrayal of these very conditions. 
The film, released in 1996, is skillful­ly directed and written by Joel and Ethan Coen, who are known in Hollywood as simply "the Coen Brothers." "Fargo" is considered by many to be the Coen Brothers' best work. 
The film is a poignant example of American cinema at its best, combining facets of suspense, drama and a keen insight into human nature to provide a virtual smorgasbord of visual and intel­lectual stimulation. 
Perhaps the opening scene of the movie offers the 
Lundegaard. Lundegaard is in a spot of financial trouble (the likes of which is never revealed to the viewer) and seeks financial recompense through an elab­orate plan to have his wife Jean Lundegaard, played by Kristin Rudriid, kidnapped and held for ransom. He invokes the help of two low-life crimi­nals, Carl Showalter (played by Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (played by Peter Stormare). 
Lundegaard's plan is to have his wife kidnapped and held for $1,000,000 ransom, giving $40,000 of which to the kidnappers and keeping the rest for himself. However, as a series of mishaps causes the slaying of three innocent people. Lundegaard sifts deeper and deeper into a mire of mur­der and deception. 
The film's strongest qualities lie in its ability to provide the viewer with a sense of the human

viewer with a feeling of the friendliness of the far north reaches of United States. 
However, this feeling is sharply con­trasted with the stunning visual images of the frozen tundra of North Dakota. As the music progresses, the rural feel gives way to a hauntingly chilling ambiance, foreshadowing the dark events that are sure to ensue. 
"Fargo" stars William H. Macy as a financially troubled car salesman Jerry one, in the most sinis­
ter acts of human 
character. 
Providing a glimpse of the positive side of human existence is the preg­nant sheriff Marge Gunderson, played by Frances McDormand. 
"There's more to life than a little money, you know, " Gunderson says, offering her positively-minded insight into the decrepit state of the desperate man's mind as she speaks to one of the kidnappers. 
Gunderson has found happiness in a fulfilling career and a loving husband, and attempts to soften the mood of the movie as a beacon of virtue in an oth­erwise dark film. 
Furthering Fargo's bid as one of the best movies of the 1990s is the stun­ning cinematography. The stark white atmosphere of the movie is contrasted piercingly with the dark nature of the film. The cold climate depicted throughout "Fargo" is compared effec­tively with the cold feelings that per­meate several of the main characters' hearts. These subtle nuances are the aspects that elevate "Fargo" from being a good film into being a great film. 
"Fargo" will be showing this Thursday at midnight as part of Legend's "Brew and View."

"Helated" follows the lives of four "closer than close" sisters who depend on each other in just about every aspect of their daily lives. The Sorelli Sisters are a little mixed up, as each battles with some sort of distinguishing obstacle associated with certain con­ventional stages in a

woman's life. 
Finally, there is the eldest sister Ginnie. She is the mother-hen-type sis­ter of the group, who is both newly pregnant and a full-fledged workaholic. 
Each sister is so preoccupied with each other's lives that it becomes frus­tratingly clear that most of their dilem­mas are the spawn of some overly demanding desire to be accepted and praised by one another. 
Since they are depicted stressing out over nearly everything, the banter between them becomes overwhelming­ly exhausting. As a comedy set in trendy New York City, a sort of "Friends"-like humor might be expect­ed -especially since executive pro­ducer Marta Kauffman comes directly from the highly successful televi­

lege student who has just switched her major from a tidy "Pre-Med" to "Experimental Theater." 
Then there is the "fresh out of col­lege, working to get her career started" character Marjee (Lizzy Caplan, of "Mean Girls"). As an aspiring celebrity­event planner, she is probably the most dynamic character of the group. Marjee has a desire for independence, yet ends up whining for help at just about every turn. 
Next, there is Ann (Kiele Sanchez), a therapist who was dumped by her six­year boyfriend right around the time the average woman is looking for a ring. 
"Sex and the City." So how 
does a show with such a 
highly regarded staff fall into a pit of immense disappointment? 
The set-up has the potential for an enthusiastic female audience, but who­ever is writing the script will have to get on the ball and start exploring less one-dimensional and superficial sce­narios. 
The four lead actresses are all con­siderably talented, but they just need a bit more motivation to make things happen. The show is set in the big city of New York, but rarely uses its con­venient location to set in motion an exciting plot. 
Both "Sex and The City," and fellow WB sitcom "Gilmore Girls" thrive on have to implement a bit more creativi­ty.

USC faces last team to beat Trojans ·at home 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -Only a few years ago, the Los Angeles Coliseum was usually half­empty ·when Southern California played, or as coach Pete Carroll clarified recently in a defining measure of his per­sonality, half-full. 
One of those days was Sept. 29, 2001. when the Trojans entertained Stanford before a crowd of 53,962 in Carroll's first season. 
The Card ina) took a 21-0 half­time lead before holding off the Trojans 21-16, dropping USC to 1-3 and further convincing many die-hard fans that Carroll was another bad hire, as Paul I Iaekett had been before him. 
That loss dropped the Trojans to 32-32 since they went 9-2-1 and won the Hose Bowl in the 1995-scason. 
Fast-forward to tho present, and Carroll is the model for col­lege football coaches every­where, having guidBd his team to 30 straight victories and a shot at an unprecedented third eonseeutivB national champi­onship. 
USC is unbeaten at home 
since that loss to Stanford, hav­ing won a school-record 24 straight at the Coliseum, where crowds of more than 90,000 are the norm these days. 
The Trojans can make it 25 Saturday night when they host Stanford for the second time since the loss four years ago. They beat the Cardinal 44-21 before a crowd of 68,341 in 2003. 
"Yeah, I've been reminded," Carroll said with a smile Tuesday when asked if he remembered his team's last loss at home. 
With that, he rattled ofT sev­eral details, mentioning Luke Powell, "a little wide receiver who killed us," along with USC's second-half comeback that fell short and Stanford's solid defense and overall experience. 
The Trojans would lose again the following week, falling to Washington 27-24 in Seattle to drop to 1-4. 
They've lost only five games since then while winning 49. 
The Trojans have had several close calls during their winning streak, including last year at Stanford when they rallied from a 28-17 halftime deficit for a 31-28 victory. 

"They almost knocked us off," USC offensive tackle Sam Baker recalled. "We know they're a real good team. That was my first game where I thought, 'Whoa! We might Jose here."' 
USC (8-0, 5-0) is favored by a whopping 33 points over the Cardinal (4-3, 3-2), who are coming off a 30-27 overtime loss to No. 7 UCLA in a game they Jed 24-3 with 8 1/2 min­utes remaining. 
"They really controlled the football game throughout," Carroll said. "Within a dozen plays, the game absolutely flip­flopped. There were a number of ways they could have gotten it done. On the other side, UCLA was really executing in the fourth quarter." 
Carroll said that knowing Stanford coach Walt Harris, he expects the Cardinal to respond in a positive way to the tough loss. 
"Walt's been coaching too long to let his team not respond," Carroll said. 
Carroll and Harris have a long personal history. Carroll was the first player Harris signed to a letter of intent while a young assistant coach at the University of Pacific, where Carroll played safety in the early 1970s. 

"l-Ie's done a great job, and on a pBrs<mal note, I'm very excit­ed about all the things he's aecomplished," Harris said. "lie's a great guy and a great coach."

Autopsy shows Hawks' Collier died from enlarged heart 
Associated Press 
DECATUH, Ga. -Atlanta Hawks center Jason Collier died from a sudden heart rhythm disturbanee caused by an abnormally enlarged heart, an autopsy showed. 
The state's chief medical examiner, Dr. Kris Sperry, said Tuesday his testing showed that electrocardiograms admin­istered to Collier in 2003 and this year showed "some indica­tion of electrical abnormali­ties." 
"Looking at them now, and in retrospect in knowing what's going on with his heart, the abnormalities may have been

Sperry indicated that the family has concerns about the medical tests in 2003 and 2005 and "when we get all the find­ings back I think the family will have some of those examined in closer detail, based upon the results." 
He said tissue and blood sam­ples had been sent to the Mayo Clinic and Harvard Medical School for further tests to determine whether Collier had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a congenital defect that can lead to an enlarged heart.

Collier's father, Jeff, had pre­viously told The Associated Press that his son did not have any diagnosed health problems before his death besides past injuries to his knees. Heached at his Springfield, Ohio, home on Tuesday evening, Jeff Collier said he's disappointed that the state released its conclusions without first notifying him of the findings. 
''I'm telling you I don't know anything about this," Collier said. 
The 7 -foot Collier, who played at Georgia Tech, was with the Hawks for two years after spending three years with the I Iouston Hoekets. IIe died after 
due to 
Collier's size. But he said the player's heart "was above the accepted limits, even for a man of his size." 
He said the organ was about one and a half times the size it should have been. 
"We have the unfortunate advantage of taking the heart out and weighing it," Sperry said. 
Sperry also said that the elec­trical abnormalities could have been a reason for further test­ing. 
"If it were me, I would have wanted more studies done to clarify what those abnormali­ties meant in light of the fact Jason was an athlete," he said. 
The autopsy was conducted by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which performs all Forsyth County autopsies, Wednesday night against the GBI spokesman John Bankhead Golden State Warriors. said. The players are wearing

The Hawks will leave Collier's uniform in his loeker through the season.

New Orleans 93 Sacramento 67 
OKLAHOMA CITY -They're still ollkially the team from New Orleans, but judging by the roaring capacity crowd and the startling success of their Oklahoma City debut Tuesday, the Hornets should happy to wear those "OKC" patches for a while. 
.J.H. Smith scored 19 points and had two electrifying dunks as New Orleans beat the Sacramento Kings on the NBA's opening night, which also marked the first of 35 Hornets home games in Oklahoma City. 
The celebration began with a street party outside the Ford Center, then got even more lively inside the sold-out arena as the llornets, 18-64 last season, beat a Kings team expected to con­tend. 


P.J. Brown seored eight points during a 16-2 run midway through the second quarter that gave the Hornets a 3H-27 lead. Smith's two-handed fast-break dunk was the highlight of the run for New Orleans, which wore whiie jerseys with a hexagonal "OKC" patch on the right shoulder. 
Brown linished with 20 points and 10 rebounds, Speedy Claxton added 17 and Chris Paul, the team's No. 1 pick in this year's draft, added 13. 
Peja Stojakovie scored 1 H and Shareef Abdur-Hahim added 14 for the Kings, who shot only 
31.3 percent. 
New Orleans, which was the lowest scoring team in the league last season, built their lead to 20 points in the second quarter as Smith again ener­gized the crowd. 
He had seven points during a 12-0 run that put the Hornets up 5H-3H. 
The Hornets were searching for a place to play this season after Hurricane Katrina devas­tated New Orleans. The other six home games will be played in Baton Houge, La. 
A street party before the game offered fans the chance to take part in interactive gal]l.es, get their face painted in Hornets colors and listen to live bands. New Orleans then got a standing ovation when players ran onto the court for pre-game warmups to the announcement "Here come your Hornets!" 
Desmond Mason, a former Oklahoma State star, and Paul got the loudest ovations during introductions, and fans didn't sit down until Brown scored inside for the Hornets' lirst basket.

SAN ANTONIO -The San Antonio Spurs celebrated last season's success and started their title defense. 
Tony Parker scored 14 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter and newcomer Michael Finley added 11 points in the period for the Spurs, who defeated Denver in the opening game for both teams Tuesday night. 
Before the game, San Antonio unveiled its third championship banner in the rafters of the SBC Center, and NBA commissioner David Stern was on hand for the team's returning players to receive their diamond-studded title rings. 
San Antonio trailed most of' the second half until Finley hit a 19-footer to put the Spurs up 79-78 with about nine minutes remaining in the game. 
Finley, who finished with 16 points, then hit another jumper followed by a 3-pointer. 
The Spurs went 13-for-16 from the field in the fourth quarter. 
Tim Duncan had 19 points and 10 rebounds for the Spurs and Manu Ginobili added I 0 points.

FOOTBALL NOTEBOOK 
Penalites on the line area of focus for Irish 

By PAT LEONARD Sports Writer 
Notre Dame wasn't all smiles in the bye week following a 49-23 win over BYU on Oct. 22. 
Notre Dame coaches spent chunks of practice time last week addressing the amount of penal­ties along the offensive and defensive lines of scrimmage. 
"One of the things I was disap­pointed in [was! we had some line of scrimmage penalties in previous games, and in practice we continued to have some line of scrimmage penalties," Weis said. 
The Irish committed six line of scrimmage penalties against BYU on Oct. 22 -three false starts, two offsides penalties, one illegal procedure. 
Weis said he and his coaches intentionally changed snap counts to test the discipline and patience of the linemen during the bye week. And what hap­pened when somebody jumped? 
"They were penalized appro­priately," Weis said. 
Coaches also spent the team's second bye week of the season doing much of what was expect­ed -resting injured players, bringing along backups and recruiting. 
Vols '0' no different 
With the resignation of Tennessee offensive coordinator Randy Sanders, the Volunteers will begin to split play-calling duties between multiple coaches Saturday. 
But Weis darified Tuesday that Tennessee's changing of the guard on offense does not mean it will be gunning from a com­pletely different playbook. 
"There will be no difference ... who's calling the plays," he said. "It's just like if I turn the play calling over to somebody else, it would be the same list of plays. It's just ... the order in which you call them. 
"It's not going to change. Game planning is game planning. It's just how you call the plays on game day, that's all. We won't know that 'till after we have played a game." 
Full house 
Pep rallies for the remaining three Irish home games will require tickets for non-Notre Dame student fans who wish to attend, the Notre Dame athletic office announced Tuesday. 
For Friday night pep rallies that precede games against Tennessee (Saturday), Navy (Nov. 
11) and Syracuse (Nov. 18), mem­bers of the public will be required to wait in line at 3 p.m. on the day of the rally to pick up tickets at Gate 10 of the Joyce Center. 
There will be a limit of two tickets per person, and the tickets will be free. The athletic office said ticket lines will not be per­mitted prior to 2 p.m. 
Notre Dame students do not need tickets to attend and can enter the Joyce Center beginning at 5:15 p.m. at Gate 11 each Friday. Doors are open to mem­bers of the general public who have tickets at 5:45 p.m. 
The athletic office cited "demand from Notre Dame stu­dents and University needs" as reasoning for the decision, which becomes the next in a series of attempts to address or accommo­date fanfare surrounding the 2005 Irish. 
Thousands of fans were turned away from the. Joyce Center for the Michigan State pep rally, the season's first, and the University reacted by moving the Southern California pep rally to the Stadium for the night of Oct. 14. 
Weis' biggest test yet 
A reporter asked Weis Tuesday if it's true the coach scored a 1600 on his SAT. 
"That's a misnomer," Weis said. "Let's look at it this way. If I said 'yes,' I'm either smart or a liar, okay? If I said 'no,' what do I gain from saying that? Let's leave it ambiguous."

NFL 
Billick concedes division 
Despite Ravens' slow start, coach still eyes wild card opportunity 
Associated Press 

OWINGS MILLS, Md. -The Baltimore Havens put forth a marvelous performance against the Pittsburgh Steelers, backing a fine effort by a depleted defense with an attack that seored more points than in any game this season. 
And still the Havens lost. 
Now what? 

Coach Brian Billick conced­ed Tuesday that Baltimore (2­
5) has virtually no chance to win the AFC North, but expressed hope his team eould derive enough positives from Monday night's 20-19 defeat to mount a charge at a wild­card berth. 
"We're going to have to get on a heck of a run. We're cog­nizant of that,'' Billick said. "But until someone tells us that mathematically isn't going to happen, that's the hook you have to hold on to. That's where you generate your enthusiasm. Why give up on that hope'?" 
I!' the Ravens played earlier this season as they did against Pittsburgh, then reaching the playoffs wouldn't be nearly as imposing a task. Operating without injured starters Hay Lewis, Ed Reed and Anthony Weaver, the Baltimore defense forced two turnovers and held the Steelers to 261 yards. 
The offense was efficient, too. The Havens were averag­ing an NFL-worst 11.5 points per game before breaking loose for five scoring drives, 20 first downs and 25 pass completions. Although Baltimore could have used another touchdown or two instead of getting four field goals from Matt Stover, Dave Zastudil punted only twice. 
"There are some things we can definitely build on," Billick said. "We matched our passion and intensity with a certain level of execution that maybe we haven't put together com­pared to the other gamns we lost." 
The Havens didn't expect to lose to Tennessee, Detroit and Chicago, but they did. That's why they were a heavy under­dog against a Pittsburgh team seeking its 11th straight home victory Monday night. 
The Steelers extended their streak with a late field goal, but the Havens had nothing to be embarrassed about. 
"It was painful last night, but there was a sense of accomplishment to the degren that they stepped up to the challenge," Billick said. "You don't give that a lot of cre­dence in pro football because at the end of the day it doesn't add up to much. But I think they felt good about them­selves -within that context. And they should." 
In other words, a moral vic­tory doesn't mean a thing in the standings, but could go a long way toward fueling the Havens with the confidence they need for the rest of the season, beginning with Sunday's home game against the division-leading Cincinnati Bengals (6-2). 
Billick gave the players Tuesday and Wednesday off. 
hoping a 48-hour break will enable them to regroup emo­tionally and physically from Monday's disappointing loss. If the Havens are to win, they can't afford any drop-off in the hungnr they took with them to Pittsburgh. 
"That's why they have the extra time. We have a big game coming back here at home against a division rival. There's a challenge there," Billick said. "llopefully, we can hold onto (the emotion) and not be worn out from the week before, nor wear ourselves out this week, because we're going to have to have the same level of passion and intensity for Cincinnati." 
Tho Havens may have a few more players, too. Billick said there's a chance that Weaver (toe), receiver Mark Clayton (ankle) and fullback Ovie Mughnlli (ankle) could return Sunday. 
But Lewis (thigh) is out for at least two more weeks, and Heed (ankle) and quarterback Kyle Boller (toe) almost cer­tainly won't play. 
Tho Havens hoped Boller would be healthy enough to reclaim his starting job from Anthony Wright this week, but lw felt soreness in his right toe after a week's worth of prac­tice and is not yet ready to run the offense. 
"The time frame we were hoping for just isn't happening right now," Billick said. 
Wright went 25-for-44 for 252 yards against the Steelers. Since taking over for Boller in the first game of the season, he has thrown for six touch­downs and been intercepted nine times.

Every match, it seems like a new player sparks the Irish team. Heintzman, who didn't play too mueh prior to the Conneeticut match several weeks ago, eredited her team's success to, simply put, her team. 
"It really is a fun and exeiting atmosphere that this whole team has ereated," she said. "We're just enjoying every minute of playing -everybody is. Itjust makes it even better." 
Team chemistry and eonfi­dence are building, and the unselfish teammates have aecepted their roles for eaeh mateh. 
"We're all just so confident in each other," Heintzman said. "We'll look at each other on the eourt and just never doubt our eapabilities." 
Heintzman was one of several surging players to spark the Irish over the weekend. While she aceepts whatever role she's given for the remainder of the season, she said, obviously, she has enjoyed playing, and play­ing well. 
"It's always exciting to get out on the eourt, especially in sueh high-emotion games," she said. 
St. Louis, a member of the Atlantie-1 0 Conference, is led by eoaeh Anne Kordes. The Billikens are in their lirst sea­son in the A-1 0 Conferenee. 
They beat IPFW in their last match 3-1 as senior All-Ameriean Aida Antanavieiute re~-,risternd a double-double with 22 kills and 14 digs. Senior libero Erin McClanahan had a eareer-high 29 digs against IPFW. The Billikens have played well throughout the season but have been hampered by recent injuries to some key players. The Billikens have also played a challenging non-conference schedule·. They have already faced tough squads ineluding Kansas State, Kansas, Pacitie and Purdue. 
Cleary, the conferenen match­es are important for the Irish. They are loading the Big East and trying to repeat as regular season ehamps. 
But from here on out, every mateh -even non-eonferenee 
-is equally important as the Irish are vying for a top send in the NCAA tournamnnt whieh begins in early Decembnr. 
"It was aetually brought up today," Heintzman said. "It's always in the baek of our minds. It would be a great accomplishment to got a great sPed, and it would hPip us out. But it's not going to make things any easier. We're still going to have to play tough teams." 
What will make things easier are more team efTorts like thn two the Irish gave last week­end.

All-America senior Megan Duffy dribbles around an Indianapolis defender Tuesday during Notre Dame's victory over the Greyhounds. Duffy scored 18 points and had seven assists. 

Open 
continued from page 24 
The Indianapolis spurt was led by the hot shooting of junior point guard Mandy Geryak. Geryak scored 14 in the first half and finished the game with 23 points and five assists. Her layup with 9:54 remaining gave the Greyhounds their first lead of the game at 24-22. 
"I thought the player of the game was [Geryak]," McGraw said. "I thought she played real­ly well." 
Notre Dame bounced back, though, and began to pull away from Indianapolis with a 22-7 run to close out the first half. 
Sophomore guard Amanda Tsipis entered the game with 
4:10 left in the period and pro­vided an immediate boost for the Irish. Tsipis had two points, two rebounds, an assist and a steal in the four minutes before intermission to help Notre Dame regain control of the game. 
McGraw was thrilled with what she saw out of the reserve guard, who finished the game with four points and three rebounds. 
"[She was] a great spark," McGraw said of Tsipis. "She's really worked on her shot all summer. And that's one thing that she feels that is a good role for her, because we don't have a lot of three-point shooters on the team. 
"I was really pleased with the way she came off the bench." 
The first half ended when Duffy found Courtney LaVere inside, and the senior forward hit a turnaround in the paint as time expired. Notre Dame took a 44-31lead into the locker room. 
In the second half, 
Indianapolis was unable to make up any ground. Freshman Chandrica Smith scored six points for the Irish in the second period, while sophomore guard Charel Allen -slowed by a recovering knee -added seven points of her own after the break. 
Despite the victory, McGraw came away from the game con­cerned about certain aspects of the team's play. 
"We don't rebound, and we need to be better defensively," McGraw said. "We've got to really address that. We don't have anyone on the team we can really count on to rebound." 
Notre Dame will look to improve in these areas in its next exhibition game against Ferris State on Nov. 10 at the Joyce Center.

gling but also multi-faceted. 
Like last season -when quarterbacks Brent Shaeffer and Erik Ainge were splitting snaps leading up to Notre Dame's visit -Ainge and Rick Clausen have shared duties under center this season. 
Clausen has completed 59.4 percent of his passes and aver­ages 158.1 yards per game. He has thrown three touchdowns to four interceptions in seven game appearances. Ainge has been even less successful with two touchdowns, four intercep­tions and a 64.6 passing yards average in five game appear­ances. 
But Weis said not having a left-handed quarterback in practice has made the game preparation slightly less than ideal. 
"Well, with not having a lefty quarterback in practice, that is a little bit of a problem because obviously there's plays designed for a righty quarterback and lefty quarterback that are differ­ent than just your regular drop­back passes," the coach said.

ND WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
Gone Greyhounds 
Irish cruise in first exhibition game as Duffy leads with 18 
By KEVIN BRENNAN 
Sports Writer 
Despite some early first-half struggles, the Notre Dame women's basketball team start­ed the preseason ofl' on the right foot Tuesday with an 84-59 exhibition win over the University of Indianapolis at the Joyce Center. 
Senior captain Megan Duffy led the way for the Irish, scoring 18 points and dishing out seven assists while turning the ball over just once in 32 minutes. Duffy connected on four of her eight attempts from three-point range in the game. 
Center Melissa D'Amico added 16 points and seven rebounds for Notre Dame, while freshman guard Lindsay Schrader record­ed 13 points and seven rebounds in her collegiate debut. 
The Irish started the game off strong, jumping out to a 13-3 advantage. Five minutes into the game, though, Indianapolis switched from man-to-man to a zone defense. Notre Dame struggled to score and the Greyhounds capitalized, going on a 21-9 run. 
"We were unprepared for the zone," Notre Dame head coach Muffet McGraw said. 'That was our biggest problem. They played all man-to-man last year."

SMC VOLLEYBALL 
Alba sweeps team in MIAA quarterfinals 
Season ends with a hard-fought playoff loss to talented Scots 
By RYAN KIEFER Sports Writer 
If the goal of a team is to play its best at the end of the sea­son, the Saint Mary's volleyball team achieved its season goal Tuesday. 
Despite losing 30-25, 30-25, 30-23 in a season-ending match in the MIAA quarterfi­nals to Alma, the Belles played with determination and heart, characteristics that marked the team's play all season. 
"It was the best we've played against Alma," Belles coach Julie Schroeder-Biek said. "Even their coach said that every one of our players played to win out there tonight." 
The Belles entered the match with Kristen Playko and Shelly Bender playing setter. Neither had set in a match this season, but an injury to regular setter Amanda David and a test con­flict for replacement Michelle Turley forced Playko and Bender into the position. Both Playko and Bender had been two of the Belles biggest hitters entering Tuesday's match, ranking first and third, respec­tively, in kills on the team. The two were forced to bear the burden of passing and hitting Tuesday and did so with sue­cess. 

"They were switching modes immediately," Schroeder-Biek said. "They really adjusted well." 
Playko notched 12 kills on a season-high .423 hitting per­centage and also added 15 assists. Bender recorded five kills and 11 assists. 
Schroeder.Biek was proud of her entire team for responding with energy and drive amidst

Belles get elusive tenth win 
By KYLE CASSILY Sports Writer 
Ten wins-the magic num­ber that the Belles set as a goal weeks ago-was accom­plished on Tuesday with a 
resounding  2-0  defeat  of  
Kalamazoo  College  in  the  
unfriendly  confines  of  
Michigan.  

The record books are now being pulled from the shelves, and this 2005 edition of Saint Mary's soccer is being pen­ciled in as the greatest Belles soccer team in history. 
Prior to this season, the Belles had never reached 10 conference wins in the MIAA, and with those wins comes a guaranteed third-place finish in the conference standings, also a new Saint Mary's mark. 
"It's hard to put in words, I just feel good for them," Belles coach Caryn Mackenzie said. "I think the fact that they finished third in the confer­ence should work as a great springboard for next year." 
Two freshmen were the game-winning catalysts, as Whitney Fron and Mandy Thomson both scored in the second half to propel the Belles over the Hornets. 
Fron found the back of the net first on a long drop pass from the right side by mid­fielder Ashley Hinton. The

Volunteers are setting no 'trap' for the Irish 
Weis vows team will not take troubled Tennessee lightly this weekend 

By PAT LEONARD Sports Writer 
The "trap" is to assume a 3-4 team is not as competitive as a 5-2 team. The "trap" is to expect a Notre Dame victory as automatic Saturday. 
But~ Notre Dame coach See Also Charlie Weis 
"Penalties"
made himself absolutely page20 clear at his Tuesday press conference ­there's no such thing as a "trap" against Tennessee . 
 
'This is the scariest 3-4 team that you're ever going to go against, because they're capable of beating everybody every week," Weis said. "And they know it. Our guys know it, too." 
Tennessee's defense has given up only three passing touch­downs in seven games. Their four losses have come against teams with a combined record of 26-6. And that includes .a loss to undefeated Alabama (8-0), who scored just six points on the Volunteers in a 6-3 decision. 
"I know it's going to be a tough challenge, especially from the game we had with them last year it was down to the wire," Notre Dame running back Darius Walker said. "So it's probably going to be another one of those kinds of games." 

Notre Dame beat Tennessee, 17-13, last season. Weis said his plan this week is to hammer home to his players that the Volunteers have the talent, size and will to beat any team in the country. And how will he do it? 
"All you have to do is watch the tape," Weis said. That game tape will show a Volunteer offense that is strug­
