Tie-breaking vote at Senate meeting favors divestment 
By DAVID T. LEE 
News Staff 
In a two-hour meeting last night, the Student Senate voted 8-7 in favor of a resolution to divest from companies in South Africa by a specific date unless its government "makes signif­icant progress to dismantle its system of apartheid." 
Student Body President Mike Switek cast the deciding vote in favor of divestment to break a 7-7 tie. 
Sponsored by Senator John Gardiner, the resolution "calls for immediate divestment from these firms should the sit­uation deteriorate further." 
The discussion allowed both sides to present their positions for 10 minutes each before giving the Senate a chance to ask questions. 
Father Oliver Williams, a member on the Board of Trus­tees Ad Hoc Committee on South African Investments, spoke at the meeting to defend the administration's present policy. 
"My rationale is that finally what is going to happen is that blacks are finally going to get the government to negotiate," said Williams. "The reason we see the problem coming to a head is that blacks are getting a taste of power." 
Two Hare Krishnas arrested at stadium 
By TRIPP BALTZ News Editor 
Two members of a group identified with the Hare Krishna sect were arrested for selling game souvenirs outside Notre Dame Stadium Saturday, accor­ding to Notre Dame Security Director Rex Rakow. 
Alan White, 32, of Cleveland, Ohio, and Joram Cadorna, of Detroit, Mich., are reportedly members of a group from Moundsville, W.Va., who associate them­selves with Hare Krishnas, Rakow said. Although no 
age  was  reported  for  
Cadorna, Rakow  said  "he  
looked  to  be  in  his  late  
twenties."  

A third man was arrested who Rakow said was an "in­dependent guy.'' Rakow said Richard Barsanti, 47, of Western Springs, Ill., was "trying to make a buck off of Notre Dame." 
All three were charged with trespass. Rakow said the two sect 

Williams said companies Notre Dame has invested in "are in fact working to break down apartheid in society'' by giving them economic power through the organization of trade unions. He wanted com­panies to remain in order to "continue that economic power, that feeling of solidarity" among blacks. 
At a parish in Soweto, Wil­liams said he "found blacks to be evenly divided on the issue of sanctions." 
He said Notre Dame has divested from companies that violated the Sullivan Prin­ciples, which are the governing set of rules designed to ensure that companies work to oppose apartheid, citing divestment from a particular company this past summer. 
Margarita Rose, chairman of the Anti-Apartheid Network on campus, criticized Notre Dame's policy opposing divest­ment. 
"Given recent pullouts (of 

U.S. companies), the pace of change was just not quick enough . . . Their presence there was not helping to dis­mantle apartheid," she said. 
Rose cited the recent secur­ity measures enacted by South African State President P.W.

members showed identifica­tion saying they were mem­bers of the group. He said group members are present at "every game" with iden­tification showing they are from ISSK or ISKON. Secur­ity has confirmed that these acronyms are associated with the Hare Krishna sect, according to Rakow. 
The two sect members, Rakow said, were selling items with Notre Dame in­signia on them without au­thorization. "They sell panties that say things like 'I'm behind the Irish' and 'I'm an Irish fanny'," Rakow said. The two also sold stickers, painters' hats and round, gold-colored pins. 
Rakow said Barsanti was selling similar items. "We have a long history of dealing with him," he said. According to Rakow, Bar­santi has also sold T -shirts at rock concerts at the ACC. Although Barsanti has been

SMC Alcohol Education Council warns of bad effects of drinking 
By HEATHER MILLER 
Staff Reporter 
The Alcohol Education Coun­cil at Saint Mary's warned stu­dents of the physiological ef­fects of alcohol last night at the first of three lectures this week in LeMans Hall. 
Mary Beth O'Connor, a stu­dent member of the Council, said that the primary concerns of the Council are to promote alcohol education, provide sup­port groups for those who have experienced problems with drinking, and to emphasize is­sues of responsible drinking. The Council is comprised of 13 Saint Mary's students, staff, and other interested people. 
The first part of the lecture, presented by SMC student council member Elisa Cullina, coQcerned a discussion of fac­tors influencing the rate of al­cohol absorption, effects of al­cobol on the body, long and short term hazards of alcohol use, and the difference between the effects of alcohol on women and men. 
Following Cullina's discus­sion, SMC student Council members Ludy Kaehler and Heidi Cerneka highlighted tips to be followed for responsible drinking, including preparing for the evening out, sobering up in a drinking environment, and knowing what to do with a drunk friend. 
"We are not telling people not to drink. We just want people to know there are precautions to take in order to drink respon­sibly," said Kaehler. 
She presented tips to follow before drinking such as, eating a well-balanced meal with plenty of starchy foods. Accor­ding to Kaehler, people should bring money for a cab or phone call for a ride horne. Kaehler added that designated drivers are essential in preparing for evenings involving drinking and driving. 
Kaehler also suggested stu­dents make use of the "Buzz Bus", a service that provides transportation to students on Thursdays, Fridays, and Satur­days, returning them back to campus from the bars. 
Kaehler said people should know their limits by revealing helpful hints such as know what you are drinking by watching your drink being made and space your drink intake by the hour. Kaehler addressed the problem of dealing with drunk friends by advising people to stay with them and to get them home safely. 
According to Heidi Cerneka, another SMC Council member, "The main issue is a person's health." 

ND football players arrested, not charged 
By MARK PANKOWSKI News Editor 
Four Notre Dame football players were arrested but not charged in a Nov. 1 fight at a fraternity in Champaign, Ill., the Chicago Sun-Times re­ported Sunday. 
The article listed the players, all freshmen linemen, as guard Ted Healy, tackle Jason Cegielski, guard Jeff Pearson, and defensive lineman John Zaleski. 
The four did not dress for Sat­urday's SMU game, the Sun­Times reported. 
Healy, Cegielski and Pearson also did not dress for the Navy game after a photograph of them holding beer cans ap­peared in The Observer, the ar­ticle said. 
"They didn't do a bad thing," the Sun-Times quoted head coach Lou Holtz as saying. "They just made a bad deci­sion." 
Holtz, who declined further comment, apparently was speaking about the photograph and not the alleged fighting in­cident. 
Contacted by The Observer Monday, Associate Sports In­formation Director John Heis­ler declined comment about the article. 
"They're all matters within the team," said Heisler. "Lou Holtz does not make an an­nouncement on how he handles those things."

In Brief 

Two juveniles were apprehended Saturday morning by Notre Dame Security in connection with auto burglaries in Green Field, according to Rex Rakow, Director of Se­curity. The youths, aged 15 and 16, were caught at approx­imately 2:05a.m. after trying to remove tapes from a car, Rakow said. The two were apprehended in an area in which five cars had been burglarized. The burglaries are still under investigation, Rakow said. Rakow said state law prohibits him from releasing the names of juveniles.

Learning to laugh at yourselfis key to human sanity 
Ever notice how we sometimes don't see 
something right in front of our noses? If we 
become preoccupied by our thoughts, we can 
easily become farsighted in regard to things we 
intended to look at. 
Human observation (or the lack thereof) can 
be a comical thing to watch. The best places to 
get a look at this kind of comedy are those 
frequented by the actors -people. Shopping 
malls are particularly good. Take, for example, 
the average shopper entering the mall. Ever 
see someone approach the door and attempt to 
open it, only to find it won't budge? After pulling 
with all his might, he discovers a sign on the 
door: PUSH. 
We have a knack of doing things the hard way, simply because we don't see an alterna­tive. It's pretty silly if we stop to think about it. Why do we fail to see certain objects? What makes us walk right past someone we intended to talk to? Perhaps we can answer these ques­tions by taking a closer look at how we use our minds. 
The human mind has an incredible capacity for the retention of information. Well, some­times it does. How many times have we forgot­ten to do something of which we were reminded numerous times? The old trick of tying a string around one's finger fails if the significance of the string is forgotten. Sounds sort of strange to use a memory device to remember someth­ing contingent upon remembering something else, doesn't it? 
Let's face it, we all have our idiosyncrasies. But why do our minds wander, causing us to forget a message heard only five minutes ago or stare blankly at nothing in particular? I like to say it's the human mind's way of coasting after an intense period of use. Perhaps it's just one way our computer-like thinking system gets "rebooted." Then again it could be just plain boredom which causes us to "veg out." 
One hypothesis I might offer as an explana­tion of this complacency, otherwise termed the human "space cadet" syndrome, is the funda­mental need for us to laugh at ourselves. Why do we do the things we do? If we look stupid doing them, perhaps there is a purpose in it. I think it all boils down to the need for laughter. Laughter is the music of the soul (an old prov-erb). When we laugh at ourselves, our life is made a little easier. 

Maybe we've become too serious about what we do in the world. All work and no play ...(another old proverb) ...makes Jack a dull boy. We can make mistakes, but we can also learn from them. Let us remember then that we are only human. Well, what does that mean? The Webster's II Dictionary, touted as "today's most up-to-date dictionary," defines the word as "having or manifesting human qualities or form." One quality which we all share is the ability to make choices. We can choose to do something or elect not to. Either way we make a choice. 
We must accept the fact that we're all in the same boat. It may not be a very consoling thought when the paperwork piles up and demands are high, but if we can remove our­selves from our work long enough to consider this point, we can breathe a little easier, at least. Everybody has a part to play in the grand scheme of the world. We must remember that we all count and to work efficiently, we must work together. 
The advice for today is to loosen up. The world is too tense too often. Stop. Think about how peaceful the world would be if everyone did this. Lastly, laugh a little. The world is too serious to do without it.

SMC hosts Career Carnival today 
By MARGIE KERSTEN Saint Mary's Editor 
The third annual Carnival of Careers will take place today at Saint Mary's and it has "never been this well balanced," according to Jeff Roberts, coordinator of place­ment services and assistant director of counseling and career development for the College. 
Representatives from pro­fessional associations, busi­nesses, graduate schools, volunteer programs and government organizations will be on hand to talk with students about various career options. 
"The Carnival is the least threatening environment for figuring out what students want to do," Roberts said. The event will take place at Angela Athletic Facility from 3 to 6. 
According to Lenore Massa, one of the senior board's career development commissioners, there is "virtually something for every major," and the rep­resentatives are willing to talk. 
More than 450 invitations were delivered to representa­tives, Roberts said and 45 have accepted, as compared to 50 in­vitations accepted last year. "Last year there were more or­ganizations and less diversity, and this year there is more di­versity and more big names," he said. 
This year's Carnival includes representatives from the Chicago Tribune, Arthur An­derson & Co., Miles Laborato­ries, Mellon Bank, Hiiton Inn, Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern, IBM, and EF Hutton. In addition, five repre­sentatives from the Society for American Women Composers will be performing four musi­cal pieces written by women, Roberts added. 
Students should approach this day by "getting basic in­formation about different careers and organizations," Roberts said, adding, they should also talk to the repre­sentatives about what they do in their position and learn about their previous positions. He said students can also use the event to build professional ties which can lead to summer jobs, internships and per­manent employment. 
SMC Board hears student gripes 
By SHARON HEGG News Staff 
Gripe night grievances were brought before the Saint Mary's Board of Governance at the board's meeting last night. 
Betsy Burke, vice president of academic affairs, presented student complaints to Teresa Marcy, assistant to the vice president. 
Regarding excused ab­sences, "a student may be ex­cused from class for a wedding if she is an immediate family member or is in the wedding party" Marcy told Burke. 
However, "students will not be excused from class to inter­view" explained Burke. "She (Marcy) said this has come up an awful lot but she will not put through a change." 
Burke and Jeanne Heller, stu­dent body president, indicated change would have to come from student initiative. Patty Curran, senior class president, said this would be a good proj­ect for the senior class. 
Answering complaints about the grading system, Marcy ex­plained to Burke that the sys­tem works to the advantage of students and many graduate schools drop the minus when evaluating an application. This is also Notre Dame's grading policy so there is no problem 
sending grades back and forth On other items at last night's meeting, the Student Academic Council discussed the senior comprehensive. Many were up­set with the policy because there is no consistency within the departments and require­ments are not given far enough in advance, said Burke. Suggestions to improve senior comps include a gradual comprehensive program so that the emphasis is shifted away from one test senior year. As a basis for improvement, the departments should be re­quired to give a description of the comp, what is expected, and the rational for it. 
Board to determine Corby Tavern fate 
By MARILYN BENCHIK Assistant Saint Mary's Editor 
The fate of Corby Tavern may be decided Wednesday morning, when the proposed renewal and transfer of the liquor license comes before the St. Joseph County Al­coholic Beverage Board. 
The prospective buyers of the Corby Tavern, Thomas and Robert Przybylinski, two brothers, received the variance to continue legal non-conforming use of the property. 
"The hearing Wednesday concerns the renewal of the present liquor license from CTI, Inc., which owned Corby's previously," said John Gourley, attorney for the Przybylinski brothers. 
"The Indiana ABC or­dered the license to be held in escrow. This means CTI, Inc. was ordered not to use the license for a two-year period beginning October 1985," he said. 
"The ABC ordered (CTI, Inc.) to sell within a two­year period to somebody else. What happened was the two brothers entered into a purchase agreement to buy the license together with the real estate, fixtures and equipment. 
"The license has to be renewed for the tavern tore­open. Itwas not renewed last February under the CTI, Inc. ownership," said Gour­ley. 
"Assuming the license is renewed on Wednesday, then we will be asking for the transfer of the license to the Theta Corporation, which is the formal, operat­ing corporation owned by the Przybylinski brothers," he said. 
Gourley is expecting to encounter a lot of opposition from the neighborhood resi­dents. "It's going to be a real donnybrook. Their only ob­jection should be whether or not the new applicants are qualified to do business there. 
"The neighbors don't want a tavern in their neighbor­hood 'period.' They're com­plaints are directed as to how the business was run in the past," Gourley said. 
"They're not focusing on the qualifications of the new owners who intend to run a respectable business. 
"The South Bend Board of Zoning Appeals has already determined that proper use of the property was, has been, and is tavern and res­taurant as it has been for the past 25 to 30 years. We can't remember when it wasn't a tavern," Gourley said.

"I looked around in every

In Europe, Gayler said it is generally believed the United States must start a nuclear war to defend a Soviet attack. "The problem with that, of course, is the Soviets would come back with nuclears." 
Such a war would escalate and "end with the destruction of the United States," he said. "No president with all his marbles would permit the release of these nuclear weap­ons in the first place. So they're an empty bluff," he said. 
Gayler also said nuclear weapons have no political use. "There is no obvious political usefullness for these things. We have not been able to deter the Soviets from aggression in Af­ganistan," he said.

warned in the past, this is the first time he has been arrested, Rakow said. 
Members of the Moundsville group with which Cadorna and White are associated were ar­rested during last year's foot­ball season. They are the first two to be arrested from the sect this year. 
Rakow said bogus vendors outside the stadium on football Saturdays are capitalizing on the name of Notre Dame. "They're not doing it because they're fans," he added. 
"We get a variety of people selling things," Rakow said. Security tells the illegal ven­dors they are "persona non grata," said Rakow. "They bother people as much as the people who scalp tickets." 
Rakow said members of the group from Moundsville go to major sporting events everywhere in the country. For all the sporting events they at­tend they produce their own materials to sell, Rakow said. "It's a big business," he added. 
Often the sect members will say they are collecting money for a boy's school named Nan­dagram, Rakow said. "They walk around, slap a sticker on your coat, and then say they are collecting donations," he said. Rakow said Nandagram could be a bogus school.

things to deliver nuclear weap­ons," he said. Such things as bombers, cruise missiles and terrorists with nuclear weap­ons could all render "Star Wars" useless. 
Gayler said ''Star Wars" would only promote the nuclear arms race. "If we go ahead with "Star Wars" we can ex­pect a Soviet response, and the simplest way to (respond) would be to build more weap­ons," he said.

She said the South African Council of Bishops, which are "closest to the situation than any of us," see divestment as "the most effective non-violent tool left," while the U.S. bis­hops unanimously supported divestment which "aims at pressuring firms to dismantle apartheid."

One of the players was dismissed from the University, one suspended for the remaining part of the semester and the other fined and placed on disciplinary probation. 
Pearson, one of the three players pictured in The Obser­ver, had been listed as the second-string guard on the depth chart, but failed to travel to the Navy game, the Sun-Times reported. The other players were not listed on the tentative depth chart.

Advertising ban raises question of censorship 
A recent poll sponsored by the Amer­ican Medical Association indicated that 64 percent of the surveyed public favored a cigarette advertising ban. 64 percent of the survey evidently believes that a highway billboard poses that much threat to the community. 
Scott Bearby but wait, there's more 
Granted highway billboards are not the most attractive items on roadsides, but I don't see that this or the elimina­tion of magazine ads will dramatically decrease the number of smokers. In fact, the warning box which is largely placed on each of the ads is more of a detractor than a total banning -"warn­ing" and "dangerous" tend to scare people off. 
Although the results of the poll were questioned by a similar poll for the Can­cer Society which stated only 38 percent were against advertising in magazines and newspapers and 45 percent were against billboard advertising, this is still a substantial percentage of people who are committed to banning adver­tisements. 
This follows the recent trend by some groups to ban books and increase cen­sorship, an attempt to eliminate what one group views to be harmful without giving anyone the choice to say "no." on their own. 
A quick look into the relatively recent past will show that this approach doesn't work. Prohibition is probably the best example of how ineffective banning can be. 
The percentage of smokers in the United States has been decreasing for some time now, not because advertis­ing by the tobacco industry has been on the decline, but because there has been increased awareness about some of the risks associated with smoking. 
The only possible explanation I can see for justifying a total ban on "items which are harmful" is the fact that youngsters might be drawn into the glamour of smoking, but with all of the other vices they could be drawn into, smoking is no longer as tempting as it once was. 
The survey done for the American Cancer Society said six out of ten people believe advertising causes children to start smoking. However, a ban on ad­vertising will do very little good if par­ents choose to smoke in front of their children; this is the best advertisement since most youngsters tend to emulate role models. 
A parent smoking in front of his children is a far more effective adver­tising tool than any magazine ad could ever be. In fact, I remember a Cancer Society TV commercial which showed a father with a small child on his lap lighting up a cigarette, only to have his little boy reach for a cigarette of his own. I think we all realize this is more realistic than the Marlboro Man riding off into the sunset. 
The question I raise is where would the line be drawn on advertisement? Are alcohol ads also in question? What other products will be on the chopping block? 
I strongly agree, as a non-smoker, that there should be restrictions on smoking in public places, especially in light of evidence that secondary smoke does have an effect on non-smokers. With living one block away from an ex­tremely busy expressway for 20 years, I don't need any additional contribu­tions to my lungs. 
Before the attention to the dangers of smoking I too often fell victim to the drifting curls of smoke crossing my path in restaurants and airports. Health considerations or not, drifting smoke can get annoying sometimes. 
Most smokers are understanding of this and I appreciate it (although I had to laugh when on a recent flight a smoker, mistakenly placed in the non­smoking section, lit up a cigarette only to have the flight attendant correct him. He wasn't happy.) 
Certainly we have an obligation to protect the health of citizens as a whole, especially if secondary smoke does have a negative effect. However, if an individual chooses to light up even after seeing "WARNING: The Surgeon Gen­eral has determined that cigarette smoking could be hazardous to your health" just as alcohol might be damag­ing to the liver and saccharine could cause cancer, it is his choice -as long as he is aware of the consequences and does not try to affect others. 
Rather than working on a banning of advertising I would suggest efforts on education -education to the youngsters about the possible side effects of smoking. Education (or lack of it) is a critical step, but something overlooked in most areas. 
A ban on tobacco advertisements will not eliminate smoking and is a poten­tially dangerous step in the media. Their current informational efforts and counter-campaigns are a much safer and effective means.

Fundamentalists resist 
diversity of thought 
While paging through a recent issue of Newsweek, I happened to see an ar­ticle describing a battle currently being waged in the Tennessee courts by a growing fundamentalist movement. 
Seven families are suing their local school board over textbooks they deemed offensive to their religious beliefs. OK, I said to myself, I have no problems with that. If their freedom of religion is being infringed upon they have every right to protest. But what disturbed me greatly was a quote by one of the parents involved with the case which epitomizes the most dan­gerous aspect of the entire fundamen­talist movement. "Her eyes brimming with tears, (she) also told the courtroom ... she objected to teachings (which) ... 'could produce changes in my child's way of thinking-they could become confused.' " 
Matthew Slaughter 
guest column 
Herein lies the most serious problem with the fundamentalists. It is not their views which are at fault; every Amer­ican rightly deserves the freedom to possess his or her own opinions. Rather, the problem lies in the adamancy with which they hold these views. The im­mutability of this growing group evokes at best uneasiness, at worst alarm. 
Fundamentalists today have taken a precarious step. In effect, they are now calling for the eradication of one of the basic tenets upon which our govern­ment and society are founded: diver­sity of thought. Citizens of no other country enjoy as we do the ability to hear, discuss, and decide upon opposing doctrines. Only through this continuous 
Trudeau 
self-re-examination do we advance ourselves. Without it we stagnate in a dearth of creativity. 
Yet this stagnation is exactly what fundamentalist thinking effects. These people wish to eradicatefrom their chil­dren's schools all traces of thought which do not match theirs. These chil­dren shall grow up with the frightfully erroneous attitude that they are right and everyone else is wrong. Period. History provides us with foreboding ex­amples of what such elitist thinking produces. One need look no further than this century to find all too vivid exam­ples in Adolf Hitler's "master race" and the Soviet Union's "worker's party." Countless millions have been killed in the name of purity of thought. Such deplorable purges cannot occur again. 
This is not to say that all fundamen­talists must be rounded up in a heretical witch hunt and burned at the stake. Rather, fundamentalists should simply stop and re-examine what results their current fight could produce. Out of fierce religious convictions they have overstepped the boundary of accep­table actions. But this is a boundary which we must allow no one to cross. We cannot permit any group in our so­ciety to attain the dangerous mentality of intellectual supremacy whch allows no room for debate. Such an attitude has produced and always will produce deplorable results. Banning textbooks will accomplish little but the evolution of a homogenous, unquestioning youth. Society possesses a duty to itself to prevent the development of such a pop­ulation at all costs.

Every year introductory psychology stu­dents are given the opportunity to partic­ipate in campus psychology experiments conducted by professors and graduate students here at Notre Dame. Students who decide to participate in the experi­ments can earn extra credit points toward their psychology classes and learn some­thing about themselves. 
The extra credit points that can be earned vary from class to class. Usually, for every hour that a student spends on an experiment he is awarded a bonus point, up to six hours or a maximum of six extra bonus points. This can usually translate into four to five percent of a student's grade. 
The majority of the experiments have something to do with learning and

memory. For example, Dr. Mark McDaniel of the Notre Dame psychology depart­ment developed an experiment to deter­mine if there is a better way to learn vo­cabulary words other than the accepted educational practice of contextual learn­ing. learning the words in the context of a sentance. 
It is McDaniel's contention thata system called the mnemonic key word system is the most effective form of vocabulary learning. especially with people who char­acteristically have some sort of deficiency with their verbal skills. The system works by taking a part of the word that is familiar and applying a symbol to it. For example, the word "carta" is Spanish for letter. The subject could use the "cart" part of the word and apply a symbol to it. 
The symbol should be something un­usual so as to heighten the individuals ability to recall it at a later time. For "cart" one could think of a cart with a big letter in it. Therefore, whenever the word comes up again the subject will recall the odd image and be able to identify the meaning of the word. 
McDaniel uses two sets ofrandomly se­lected students to conduct his experi­ments. He will give a set of words to one group and let them study on their own. The other group will be instructed how to remember the words by use of the mnemonic key word system. 
He then tests both sets of students. McDaniel has found that subjects in the mnemonic group score higher than the other group. 
He does point out, however, that most students with high SAT verbal scores do well in both groups. Apparently brightstu­dents can assimilate their own systems very well. The mnemonic system works best where it is the most needed, with

those who have difficulty with word reten­tion. 
There are countless other experiments going on across campus, some not as intense as McDaniel's. Beth Rosenstreich, president of the Notre Dame psychology club participated in an experiment when she was a freshman designed to test the ability or willingness of a person to follow directions. 
She was given a full can of carrots, in­structed not to eat any but to return in one week for verification. Upon returning the following week Rosenstreich's carrot can was weighed to see if it was lighter, thereby determining If she had eaten any carrots. The can was empty, proving that Rosenstreich either loved carrots or she simply had no respect for authority. 
All those students who are interested in participating in this program should see their psychology instructor.

In the other semi-final matchup, the outcome as well as the game's performances, were parallel to Howard­Stanford game. Flanner pulled away from Sorin 13-0, to put them back in the championship after they lost to Alumni just one year ago. 
"We got off to a slow start," said Flanner Coach Jim Fitzgerald about the game, "but we made some adjust­ments and began to take con­trol." 
Flanner's first touchdown drive was set up by an excellent punt return by Mike Reyda. The key play of the drive was set up by a 22-yard pass from QB Randy Bridgeman to TE Pete Kazmierczak. On the next play, Tim Murney ran nine yards for the touchdown just before the end of the first half. In the second Half, Flanner 
dominated the Screaming Ot­ters both offensively and defen­sively, opening with a 65-yard drive, culminating with a 26­yard run by Jim Kelly, who found the endzone and padded Flanner's lead to 13-0. That was enough to secure victory, as the offensive line of Ed Marchesel­lii, Brian Fitzgerald, Dave 
Coderre, Ray Arce, and Darrin Mertz, ground it out in the trenches, while the defense kept Sorin at bay. Murney's in­terception at the Flaner 20­yard line was the Screaming Otters' deepest threat at scoring. 
"We are very excited about 
playing  in  Notre  Dame  
Stadium  again,"  said  
Fitzgerald,  "and  it  was  a  
dream that has  now  become  

reality. We know Stanford has a great team and has the po­tential to score a lot of points, but we have been able to come together as a team and rise to the occasion." 
There it is: undefeated Stan­ford versus underdog Flanner. It should be a memorable final.

Sailing Club surprises everyone with performance 
Members of the Notre Dame Sailing Club surprised themselves as much as anybody else last weekend when they won the Area A Elimina­tions at the University of Michigan. 
The Irish were only hoping to finish as one of the top three teams, which would enable them to reach the Timmie Angstrom Regatta in Chicago. They expected a team like Michigan, which had beaten them earlier in the season, would keep them from placing first. 
"Winning it was pretty surprising. We raced Michigan earlier in the year, and they beat us," said Team Captain Mark Ryan. "We just wanted to get in the top three to qualify for the Timmies." 
Notre Dame scored 26 points to outdistance second-place Michigan by seven points. Notre Dame, Michigan, and Toledo all qualified for the prestigious Timmie Angstrom Regatta over Thanksgiving break. 
Club President Tony Fink led Notre Dame wttn four firsts and two thirds. Ryan added five seconds and a first. 
"I was surprised at Tony Fink's performance. His showing was incredible for Notre Dame," said senior Pete Wall. 
Steve Megargee 
Club Corner 

Wall and Ann Wiedemann also turned in strong efforts for the Irish. 

"This was our most important regatta of the · year so far, and we won by a good amount," said Fink. "We're looking forward to the Timmies now." 
The upset victory gives the Irish added momen­tum going into the Timmie Angstrom Regatta at the Chicago Yacht Club. Last year, 18 schools from across the country competed in this regatta. 
"We placed tenth last year, which was our best finish ever," said Ryan. "We'd like to do the same. If we do that well, it'll be great." 
Just as the varsity teams in the Rowing Club ended their fall season, members of the novice program began theirs with a regatta against Mic­higan last Sunday.

The Notre Dame men's swim team, lost its own invitational Friday, dropping the 22nd An­nual Notre Dame Relays to Illinois-Chicago. The Irish defeated North Central, Wabash, Valpo and the Mar­quette Swim Club to salvage a second-place finish with 194 points to Illinois-Chicago's 198. 
"We swam a heads-up, well­executed, aggressive meet," Irish Coach Tim Welsh said. "We were leading going into the final event and swam strong throughout the entire day." 
Notre Dame failed to withstand a late-meet charge 

Both the men's team and women's team had boats enter the final heats in the regatta held at the Notre Dame boathouse. 
The novice team will also participate in the Frostbite Regatta at Philadelphia on November 
21. The regatta will feature several eastern and southern schools. ' .. 
"They looked pretty strong, and it's a good basis for them to work with in the next three weeks," said Gretchen Tugliese. "Technique looked really good. It's just a matter of polishing that technique and getting more power." 
Competition does not start until February, but the Gymnastics Club may have already had its biggest struggle of the year-finding a coach. 
The 3Q-member team, which has been practicing at Saint Mary's throughout the fall, could not find someone to coach them until recently. Sandy Vanslager is an interim coach, and Steve Kimbro will take over as the head coach this Friday. 
"We had to find someone who was not a student who was willing to give two hours a day, five days a week until May, so we had a hard time," said Club President Matt Sennett. 
Irish men fall to Illinois-Chicago despite encouraging performance 
from Illinois-Chicago, who took six of the last seven relay events and swept the diving competitions. With only the 200­yard medley relay remaining, the Irish had a two-point lead. Illinois-Chicago took the event and the meet with a time of 1:40.99. 
The Irish showing was hardly disappointing, however, be­cause the majority of the swim­mers were competing outside of their events. Coach Welsh took advantage of the opportu­nity to test the versatility of his squad. 
"It was a highly competitive meet with a superb perfor­mance for all six teams," Welsh said. "It was a tough one to lose, but we swam a good meet. We know more about our strengths and weaknesses than we did last week." 
That knowledge could be­come key later in the season when the competitive dual­meet season begins. 
Winners for Notre Dame in­cluded the 200-and 800-yard freestyle teams, led by the sophomore tandems of Roger Miro and Chris Petrillo. Fresh­man Bill Jackoboice also con­tributed to the winning 200­yard event, whose 1:27.81 time set a new meet record. 
Chris Walsh, John Koselka, David Vreeland, and David Thoman took first in the 400­yard Backstroke with a 3:58.71 time. 
Notre Dame takes a week off before travelling to Grand Rapids on Nov. 22 to take on Ferris State. 
Playoffs 
continuedfrom page 12 
Of course, the discussion then turns to the teams in the running for the top four spots. What about the teams who don't make it? Won't there be even more controversy? 
The controversy will never completely go away as long as a poll is involved. But the whole idea of a playoff is to avoid the possibility of an undefeated team not even getting a shot at the title. 

I can't remember a year when more than four undefeated teams existed come season's end. 
Teams complain about not making the NCAA basketball tournment as well -but this does not stop it from being one of the greatest competitions on today's sports scene. Under the 
London School of Economics and Political Science A chance to study and live in London 
present system, teams ranked below the fourth slot after the regular season usually don't have a shot at the top spot anyway. What are they losing by not making the playoffs? 
For the sake of the fans, but more importantly for the sake of the teams who inevitably get jipped come New Year's Day, the time has come for college football to find a way to crown its 
true  champion.  After  all,  
shouldn't  the  best  team  be  
recognized as such?

The Observer Tuesday, November 11, 1986-page 10 

By PETE SKIKO Sports Writer 
Steady progress and dis­cipline in an area typically develop an athlete into a reli­able, competent individual both on and off the playing field. Joel Williams has fit that category well during his years at Notre Dame. 
And now that Williams, a 6-3, 234-pound tight end for the Irish, is rounding out his col­lege football career, he can pleasantly reminisce about more than just his playing days. 
"I wouldn't trade the experi­ence for anything," says Wil­liams, discussing his four years here. "The Notre Dame expe­rience is above and beyond anything that I expected, or that I could imagine. The people I've met since I've been here, the places I've visited, and the incredible national ex­posure never would have been possible almost anywhere else." 
The obvious progress that Williams has made has been at the starting tight end spot for Notre Dame. With nine recep­tions for 107 yards and three touchdowns, Williams looms as a vital cog in the recently electrified Irish offensive at­tack. He is excited about seeing the team get back in stride, and considers his primary objec­tive to do his part to get Notre Dame back into the top twenty at the end of the season. 
"Things were really frustrat­ing early," admits the senior from Gateway High School in 
Monroeville, Pennsylvania, "because we all realized that it wasn't really that the other teams were better than we were, but we were just finding ways to beat ourselves. Then we put our mind to eliminating the mistakes that were killing us, and we knew things would turn around." 
An intense player in practice with a genuine work ethic, Wil­liams is not often given to pat­ting himself on the back when it comes to his play. He ack­nowledges, however, that he's getting closer to realizing his potential. 
"Yeah, I am pretty hard on myself," says Williams. "But I honestly feel I'm getting bet­ter from game to game. By the end of the year I guess I'd like to be consistent in all facets of my game, and to be able to say that I fulfilled my role in the offense as well as I could have." 
Williams is looked up to by many of the younger members of the squad, especially the young tight ends. One person who has seen another type of progress Williams has made is tight end coach George Stewart. 
"In the last eleven months that I've worked with Joel," says Stewart, a former player and assistant coach under cur­rent Irish head coach Lou Holtz, "I've seen him mature in a lot more ways than as a 

Joel Williams 

. player. He's matured as a young man, taking on the lead­ership role that comes with being a senior on the Notre Dame football team. Joel has become much more open and willing to work with the kids coming up. He's the type that leads by encouragement and by example. Joel Williams is a class act. "In the last three weeks, Joel has made great progress in his overall game. His blocking has become outstanding and he caught a deflected touchdown pass against Navy. He's made a lot of big catches for us and 

I'm sure his intensity will only get higher down the stretch." 
Williams understands that the coaching this year has meant a major difference in the total attitude of the squad. 
"They're ingenious," says an admiring Williams when refer­ring to the Irish coaching staff. "The overall philosophy that came in with Coach Holtz is just night and day from last year. There's a continuous push that's totally positive. We know 
that we can play, and we know that we're going to beat a lot of people, and even a lot that may have more talent than us. Coach Stewart is phenomenal. He's a great coach and a great teacher, just like Coach Holtz. The motivation and drive are always there. 
"The future of this team with Holtz here is going to be remarkable. I am really happy to be part of the foundation of what's to come, but I sincerely wish I had one more year to play. Believe me, things look good for the next few years." 
The more immediate future is much higher on Williams' list of priorities, however. Like this Saturday. 
"Everybody's pretty psyched for Penn State," says Williams. "How could we not be? They handled Alabama pretty well, so a win over Penn State could probably be consid­ered a season high point. We knew we needed a big game against SMU going into this week and we got it, so I guess we'll just see what happens." 


Dolphins beaten again 
Associated Press 
CLEVELAND -Second-year quarterback Bernie Kosar passed for a career-high 401 yards last night and overcame three dropped touchdown passes by Cleveland receivers to direct the Browns to a 26-16 victory over the Miami Dol­phins. 
Kosar completed 32 of 50 passes without an interception -and without a touchdown pass. His pinpoint passing, however, set up four short Matt Bahr field goals and touchdown runs of 16 yards by Harry Holt and 13 yards by Curtis Dickey. 
The 22-year-old quarterback had never before thrown for more than 300 yards in a game. His previous best was a 293­yard performance in a loss to the Cincinnati Bengals in Sep­tember. 
The Browns, who improved to 7-3 after their sixth victory in the last seven games, lead the Cincinnati Bengals by a game in the AFC Central Divi­sion. 
Cleveland led only 16-10 at halftime despite dominating the half statistically, outgain­ing the Dolphins 351 yards to 176 yards. The Browns finished with 558 yards.

The Notre Dame women's swim team looked very impres­sive Friday at the Notre Dame Relays at Rolf's Aquatic Cen­ter. Coach Tim Welsh's young Irish swimmers won the all­relay meet by tallying 200 points, outscoring Valparaiso, who finished second with 178 points. 
Filling out the field were third place University of Illi­nois at Chicago with 170 points, Saint Mary's and Marquette (both with 106 points), and North Central (62 points). 

Coach Welsh said he was very pleased with the team's performance. 
"A goal we set this season was to win at least one meet we didn't win last year," he said. 
The Irish, who finished second in last year's Notre Dame Relays, have accom­plished that goal early in their season. 
The Notre Dame team won seven races Friday, setting two meet records. The foursome of P.J. Amberg, Margaret Cof­fman, Beth Genega and Amy Darlington set a mark of 
1:44.37 in the 200 yard freestyle relay. A record of 4:23.73 was set by Kathy Quirk, Betsy Baker, Annette Quill and Mary Acampora in the 400 yard med­ley. 
The Irish placed first in the 800 yard freestyle, 400 yard In­termediate, 400 yard butterfly, 400 yard backkstroke, and 400 yard breaststroke. 
Welsh praised his team's ef­forts. "Not only did we win, but we 
won the right way," said Welsh, referring to success­fully placing swimmers in new events to determine the flexibility, depth, and strength of the women's team. 
"We learned a lot. It was great to learn as much as we did and still be able to win the meet." 
"The girls were intelligent, enthusiastic and aggressive about this meet,'' Welsh contin­ued. "I hope to see that attitude over and over this season." 
A strong performance in an event such as the Notre Dame Relays is a good indicatiOn of the depth and flexibility of the team. This year's team was depleted by graduation, injury and foreign study programs, but the young talent coming in is making its mark on this year's results. The future of the Irish swim team looks bright. 
The next meet for the Irish will be against Northern Mic­higan at Ferris State. Notre Dame and Northern Michigan tied for third last year at the Midwestern Invitational, so the competition should be tough again this year. 
College Football needs playoffs to determine champion 
Just a couple of days into the year 1987, the na­tional champion of the college football world will be crowned by a panel of sportswriters from the Associated Press. 
There are other polls, but the AP's weekly rankings of the country's college football powers is generally accepted as the poll which determines the top college football team after the New Year's Day bowls have been played. 
But is that what it really does? Can a poll of sportswriters genuinely say that one team is more deserving of college football's highest honor than another, especially in a case where more than one team is undefeated? 
These are questions which always seem to sur­face around this time of the year, when the days grow cold and the football season on the campuses starts to wind down. People start contemplating which teams will go to which bowls, which ones will be home for Christmas dinner, which ones have a shot at the national championship, and, of course, people will debate over the plausibility of a playoff system to determine the number-one school. 
This latter question is an interesting one, and one which should be given serious consideration in light of some of the controversies in previous years. I believe a playoff system is necessary in the ranks of college football -as it seems to be one of the only major sports where the champion is not actually determined on the field. 
The College Football Association has a long­range planning committee currently studying the issue, and there appears to be at least some sup­port for the playoff proposal in the NCAA offices. 
"We'd like it," said Jerry A. Miles, the director of men's championships for the NCAA. "We have championships in all other sports, including s\lc­cessful Division 1-AA football playoffs."

I had never really given the issue much thought until the 1984 season. The final poll was always something of a tradition -something you took for granted as going hand-in-hand with college foot­ball. 
In 1984, however, I felt Washington was robbed of the chance to win the national championship by the present bowl system. 
In an Orange Bowl match-up against Oklahoma, the Huskies pulled out a 28-17 victory over the Sooners to finish the season with one blemish on their record. Meanwhile, eventual national cham­pion Brigham Young (whose schedule wasn't nearly as difficult as those of either of the Orange Bowl participants), earned an automatic bid to the Holiday Bowl by winning the West-Coast Ath­letic Conference championship. 
The Cougars barely managed to come back and edge Michigan -a team which finished 6-5 in the regular season -in that game. 
The national champion? BYU, of course, by virtue of a "perfect" season. I'm not saying that the Cougars were not a good football team in 1984 -obviously they were. But put BYU against Wash­
ington or Oklahoma in a major bowl, and my 
money is on the Huskies or the Sooners. 
I guess the Huskies will just have to live with the fact that they might have been the best team in the nation in 1984. 
Were the 1986 season to end today, four teams would remain without a loss -Miami (8-0), Mic­higan (8-0), Penn State (8-0) and Arizona State (7-0-1). Arizona State, and perhaps Michigan as well, will be playing in the Rose Bowl, while Miami and Penn State, should they remain undefeated, probably would play each other. 
That means there could very easily be two un­defeated teams after the New Year's Day bowls are played, and one team will have to settle for second place after a perfect season. 
In what other sport can you go all the way through the regular and post seasons without a loss, yet still wind up the loser in the end? 
Financially, a playoff schedule makes all the sense in the world. A college football title game would probably rake in over $10 million in a TV­rights fee, while two semifinal games could add another $5 million apiece. · 
I think a four-team playoff would be the most logical set-up, so that the champion would be . decided after only two weeks, and so it could be played within the time set aside for Christmas holidays by most universities. This way, missed classes and academic drawbacks would not pose a problem. The rest of the bowls could be played on New Year's day, as usual.
