Changes unlikely for calendar 
by Maureen Flynn St>nior Staff Reporter 
Prospects of changing next yf:'ar's academic calendar from a post-Labor Day to a Pre-Labor day start appear unlikely in light of the schedule of university events for next August. 
According to records in the ACC and the Calendar Office, the National Men's Shepherds Con­ference (Charismatic Renew a)) is scheduled for Aug. 24-28, 1976. The conferences expected to draw between 10,000 and 13,000 members and to require most of the univer­sity facilities including the residence halls.

the Music Department, are proceeding on schedule (Photo by Chris Smith). 
Building continues on time 
by Maggif:' Waltman Staff Ht>porter 

Notre Oame will have a renovated music building and a new housing complex for graduate women by next fall if construction continues according to plan. 
Ac-cording to Fr. Jerome Wilson, director of business affairs, both building projects are on schedule in terms of budget and time-table. 
Wilson said that although the target date for <'ompletion of the Hoynes Hall renovation was set for ~'eb. 1, "March 1 is a more realistic elate." After that date, the Music Department should be moved into Hoynes, said Wilson. 
David lsele of the Music Department faculty said that the renovation is going 
"fantastically." "The entire department is ready to move into Hoynes Hall tomorrow if we could," he added. 
According to lsele, "everything is overused in our present location." O'Shaughnessy is not adequate for any of the music depart­ment's activities." 
lsele criticized the bad acoustics in 0 'Shaughnessy. He cited the low ceilings as the main acoustical problem in the department's present location. "There is nothing to prevent sound travel or insure sound absorption," Isele said. 
Isele also said that the Music Department is running our of room in O'Shaughnessy. He said that due to an increase in prominence of music on campus, there has been an increase in both the number of ensembles in the department and in enrollment for music appreciation courses. 
Isele attributed much of the impetus for the renovation of Hoynes Hall to Dr. William Cerny, department chairman. 
Isele said, "Cerny instigated the move. He realized that it was necessary for any growth to happen in the department." Isele said that Cerny has been working on the project since he came to Notre Dame three years ago. ,Hoynes Hall is perfect for our purpose," Isele added. 
The Music Department will have three time 
Calendar Office records show Sept. 3-6 reserved for Freshman Orientation, with registration on the 7th and the start of classes on Wed., Sept. 8. 
According to Administrative sources, the calendar for 1976-77 features a post-Labor Day start, a Saturday class and final exams past Dec. 20. The lateness of Labor Day next year, said the sources, requires these measures to insure the desired number of class days. 
Early start "nearly impossible" 
Academic Commissioner Mike Gassman edmitted that a pre­Labor Day start in 1976 is "nearly 
the space in Hoynes Hall than in its present location on the second floor of O'Shaughnessy. According to Isele, there will be twenty practice rooms <there are twelve in O'Shaughnessy>, and each full-time faculty member will have his own office. 
"The architects have been very agreeable to what the Music Department needs," Isele said. Precautions have been taken for sound insulation. Wall-to-wall carpeting and floor­length draperies will be installed to absorb the sound. The building will be centrally air conditioned for the preservation of in­struments and the comfort of people par­ticipating in summer music workshops. 
Isele said the Department has kept as close as possible to the budget. "Every inch of space is used, and all new furniture is func­tional and guaranteed for life," he said. 
A small kitchen, Isele said, may be inst­alled which might overshoot the budget somewhat. He added that costs can probably be cut in other areas. Isele cited reductions in carpeting and drapery costs as possible ways to l'olve the problem if a kitchen is built. 
"The ~enovation is happening just in time," 
Isele s~1d. He added, "It will be a greatly 
appreciated asset to the Music Department
and to Notre Dame. 

Graduate Housing 
Construction of the housing complex for graduate women is also going according to plan. 
Dr. Robert Gordon, vice-president of Advanced Studies, said, "Sept. 1, 1976 is a very realistic delivery date." He cited this year's long Indian summer as a big help in construction activity. 
According to Gordon, the contractor plans to pour the concrete foundations before Thanksgiving. Once the interior walls are built, coustruction will not be held up by bad weather conditions. 
Gordon said the use of Badin Hall was adequate for one year, but the needs of (continued on page 7) 
impossible" unless the Shepherds Conference can be rescheduled. 
"If we started before Labor Day," Gassman speculated, "it would probably be on Sept. 1. We just can't get the freshmen registered in that time." 
A Sept. 1 date for the start of classes would call for Freshmen to arrive for orientation the same day that the conference members are scheduled to leave the residence halls. Freshmen taking entrance examinations would have to arrive several days earlier. According to maintenance officials, at least a 
week is required to prepare  the  
dormitories  for  student  oc­ 
cupation.  



South Bend history recounted by local journalist at SMC talk 
by Christie Herlihy Staff Reporter 
What do you think of when someone mentions South Bend'? A bus depot on the way to the Scottsdale Mall, a place to correct bank statements or buy sports equipment or splurge on pizza? 
If you can't mentally hurdle Corby's or 
Nickies then you should have leaned back 
in one of the comfortable chairs in SMC's 
Stapleton Lounge Sunday evening and 
listened to Philip Ault sketch South Bend 
history. 

The city rose from the roaming grounds of buffalo which La Salle passed through. It flourished because of a farm equipment aristocracy and now the present center of insurance companies and banks is multi­ethnic community concerned about "the quality of life of its people." 
Philip Ault, assist. editor of the South 
Bend tribune and eight-year resident of the 
city has done in-depth research of the area 
for the paper. He is secretary of the North 
Indiana Historical Society. A graduate of 
De Pauw University, he is currently 
writing his eleventh historical book. 
"If you were sitting here 10 to 12 thousl\nd years ago you would be frozen 
inside a mile thick sheet of glacieral ice," 
Ault said which didn't seem incredible 
given South Bend weather. South Bend 
gets its name from the large bend in the 
St. Joseph River which the glacier carved 
at the same time as the Great Lakes. 
Miami and Potawatami Indians hunted 
the dense forests for bear, deer and buf­
falo. Buffalo were especially plentiful. 
Parkovash Street derives its name from a 
bad English pronunciation of the French 
word for "field of " 
Dean of Administraton Leo Corbaci said that calendars for 1976-77 and 1977-78 were drawn up last spring in accordance with the guidelines established by the Academic Council at its February meeting. 
"The guidelines were settled last year for a three-year period," stat­ed Corbaci. "In the absence of other guidelines, we presume those of the previous year are still in effect." 
On February 11, 1975 the Academic Council approved the following principles for calendar­making: ---a post-Labor Day start ---only one break in the semester ---the autumn break be made around the Thanksgiving holiday. 
To change the guidelines, at least ten members of the Academic Council must agree to review them. However, even action by the Council may not prove effective in view of the scheduling conflict. 
In 1972, the Academic Council approved a pre-Labor Day start for the 1973-74 academic year. A post-Labor Day start was scheduled when University ad­ministrators discovered that the proposed calendar conflicted with a previously-scheduled Mobile Home Show in the ACC. 
Gassman noted that Fr. James 
Three hundred years ago, La Salle, the famous french adventurer and trader picked up his canoes and transversed what is now U.S. 31 and Michigan St. on his way from the St. Joseph river to a nearby stream which flows into the Illinois River and eventually the Mississippi. 
The area will be celebrating La Salle's landing next year. It will be a big gala affair. No one will even mention how La Salle got lost wandering around Mishawaka," Ault quipped. 
Leeper Park near Michigan Ave. is the site of Pierre Navarre's cabin, the first settler of South Bend in 1820. The city naturally grew as the result of the passageway to the Illinois River. It was also a stop on the Michigan Road which connected the heavily populated areas of Southern Indiana with the north. 
Indus tria I Start 

The St. Joseph River provided water power needed to run the saw mills which flourished on Michigan St., the neucleus of the growing South Bend. Industries, at­tracted by the plentiful timber located here, established a farm equipment arist­ocracy: the Studebaker wagon factory, the Birdsell Clover Huller Company, and the Oliver Plow Company. 
John Studebaker started his business with capital raised during the 1850 California Gold Rush. He didn't strike gold but sold wheel barrows to the miners from which he made "a potful of money" according to Ault. The Wagon business flourished because of Civil War contracts and soon Studebaker became the "dominant force in the town." {t later 
(continued on page 6) 
T. Burtchaell, Uniersity provost, has cited 72 as tht' desired number of class days, with 75 as the op­timum. The late Labor Day date, Gassman observes shortens the number to 70 days. 
"You can start after Labor Day and get two semester breaks," 
Gassman said, "If Labor Day falls on the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd, but it's impossible if itfalls on the 4th, 5th, or 6th." 
Gassman said he intended to make some calls to see if anything could be done about the calendar for 1976-77. "The big question," he stated, "is what is the story on the conference?" 
Gassman also stated that the Academic Commission will be conducting Its poll on the calendar issue at the end of this week or the beginning of next. Among other things, the survey will attempt to determine when students want their breaks and how long they want their breaks and how long they want them, Gassman said. 
On the basis of these results and the replies from other colleges to a questionnaire concerning their calendars, Gassman said, "We will draw up two or three possible calendars, listing the starting dates, endin£ dates, dates of vacation, etc."

'Meet the Press' anniversary 



Ford discusses firings, election 
WASHINGTON <AP) -Pres­ident Ford challenged Ronald Reagan and any other White House rivals Sunday to contest him in all of the 30 Republican presidential primary elections next year. 
He said candidates owe it to 

the  voters  to  do  that  rather  
than  "entering  some  and  duck­ 
ing others."  

Ford also acknowledged for the first time that dis­agreements and tension within the administration led to his de­cision to fire Secretary of De­fense James R. Schlesinger a week ago. 
He did so minutes after de­claring again that policy dis­putes were not involved in his shakeup of top-echelon national security personnel. 
The President answered ques­tions in an hour-long appear­
ance on the NBC program "Meet the Press." It marked the 28th anniversary of the tele­vision interview program.
Ford said that over the last month he had seen "a growing
tension" building in his admin­
istration. He did not mention 
specific issues, but Schlesinger
is known to have been sharply opposed to planned reductions in the next defense budget. 
In addition, there have been repeated reports that the de­fense secretary had misgivings~ about administration accom­odations with the Soviet Union in the name of detente. 
The President said he thinks the changes he made will create a better atmosphere and help him do a better job.

Case 1: A female ND grad student living off campus drives up to the main campus gate late one night and requests permission to drop off her friend at her dorm on the South Quad. 
When refused a campus pass, she then requested the security officer that an escort be provided for her friend to accompany her on the long, dimly-lit walk to her dorm across campus. 
When denied the escort, the girl becomes angered, argues and directs a vulgarity towards the guard, who responds by taking down her license number and issuing the student a ticket. A report is filed by the security guard and recorded in the student's personal file kept by the university, and the student is unable to file a counter-report. 
Case 2: An eighteen-year-old SMC student, with friends in Niles, Michigan, allegedly having a little too much to drink is forcibly pullf'd from the car by a licensed police officer and charged with public intoxication. The girl reportedly suffers bruises on her arm as a result of her brusque removal from the car. 
Case 3: A male ND student living off-campus is smoking pot with several housemates and friends in the living room of his house when the landlord bursts in unexpectedly and demands that they vacate the house within twenty-four hours.

Little damage incurred from Death March 
by Joe Lacosta Starr Reporter 
The Senior Death March this weekend resulted in only one broken window at Bridget Mc­Guires as opposed to the usual 200 to 300 dollars worth of damage inflicted in the past at the local bars. 
The manager of Corby's com­mented that this was one of the most organized marches ever. 
The Death March entailed spending an hour at each of four bars. The-March started at Bridget McGuires at 2 p.m. At 3 p.m. it went to Corby's and the drinking and singing were complimented by a strip act by two male students who stripped to their shorts. 
The police greeted the crowd at Nickies but soon left with no in­cidents. The last stop was the Library, marked by dancing and singing of the Alma Mater and the fight song. 
In addition to the March the Senior class held the Last Hurrah Armory Party. The Party was an old fashioned Armory party with more beer on the floor than was consumed. The group "Faun" provided entertainment, but towards the end of the party the students waded in pools of beer and sang the Alma Mater and fight song. 
Senior Class President Augie Grace was pleased with the suc­cess of the Death March and the Armory party. He cited cooperation and concern as the reasons for the smoothness of both events. 
There were two unusual in­
cidents at Saturday's game: a new 
approach to the usual stripper act 
and use of a fire extinguisher. 
Saturday's stripper, in contrast to 
the previous strippers, started 
with his clothes off and proceeded 
to put them on. The senior section, 
after being signalled to light 
matches at a certain point in the 
game, was subsequently doused 
with water.

gorgeous inside," Ault drooled. "It · is indeed a remnant of the past." 
Singer Sewing Co. later established itself in South Bend as well, and soon timber was not only going into wagons and plow han­dies but sewing cabinets as well. 
South Bend is unique, Ault emphasized, because of the relat­ively peaceful mingling of the various ethnic groups. "Sociologists have a special in­terest in this area because of easy intermingling." There was only a small flair up in the 60's during the civil rights movement. "I think it is a tribute to the city that people cal live together as well as they do." Ault praised. 

South Bend ·careened close to financial disaster in 1963 when Studebaker, unable to compete 
· with Ford and GM markets, an­nounced its closing. "Working at Studebaker was a . family thing. Three generations from grandfather to granason often went to work together and when the company closed, the city almost fell to pieces.

CLC looks for help to find campus problems 
by Phil ('ackley Starr Reporter 
The Campus Life Committee !CLCl is looking for students and other members of the Notre Dame community to identify problems related to campus life and to become involved in ad-hoc com­mittees dealing with these problems, according to John Reid, 
committee chairman. 
The CLC is one of five standing committees of the Student Life Council !SLCl. The committee has a two-fold purpose: to respond to problems related to campus life, and to become involved in planning 
New buildings on schedule 
(continued from page 1) 
graduate students make the new complex necessary: "Badin is an old hall with old facilities." 
Plans for new graduate housing have been circulating since last year when 144 women had to move from Lewis Hall to Badin to make room for incoming Freshmen. 
Two committees discussed the housing problem. Gordon said the eommittees strongly endorsed a townhouse idea." Such a plan is less institutionalized than a dor­mitory. The students felt it would he more like home," he comment­Pd. 
The new complex will consist of thirty-six townhouse units, each housing four women. The two­story units will have four private bedrooms, a shared bathroom, kit­chen and a living room. 
The complex will also include laundry facilities and a commons room. The Bulla Road farmhouse, which now houses Phides Publishers, will be renovated for this purpose. 
(iordon said the cost is higher than anticipated: 'Due to the location on Bulla Road, utilities had to be brought into an area where they didn't previously ex­sist. "Other than the utility ex­pense, however, the University has been able to keep within reasonable sight of the estimated expense, according to Gordon. 
Gordon also cited the location as a major feature of the complex. "It is remote enough from the l'Xhileration in undergrad dorms, yet it is close to the library." It will be very convenient for the students who live there and will encourage their full participation in the University." 
Preachers asked to leave campus 
by Dave Heno Starr Reporter 
Two representatives from a local South Bend church arrived on the campus around noon last Friday with the apparent intent to bring the message of Christ to the Notre 
Dame community. 
Approximately 100 people gat­
hered to listen to the two men on 
the South Quad between the 
Business and Engineering 
Buildings. The crowd was noted to 
be somewhat amused with the 
preaching, according to one of the 
bystanders. 
The Dean of Students was notified of the appearance of the two men and notified Security of their presence. The two men left after Security informed them of . the University's Open Speaker Policy, which make an approved invitation a pre-requisite for jpublic speaking on campus' by visitors. 
Mr. Richard Conklin, · director 
of publicity, stressed the fact that 
no arrest was made and that the 
gentlemen were in no way forcibly 
escorted off the campus. 
After they left, an unidentified 
Notre Dame law student called the 
Dean of Students and received 
permission to invite the two men 
back to the University. The two 
churchmen accepted and 
returned later that afternoon.
