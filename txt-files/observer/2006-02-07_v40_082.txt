Guidelines differ for academic, dorm events 

By KAREN LANGLEY AssistaiH News Editor 
Like "The Vagina Monologues" and the formnr Queer Film Festival -focal points of University President Father John Jenkins' recent addresses on aca­demic freedom and Catholic char­actor -the Knenan Hevue and Dillon Pep Hally are annual stu­dnnt-mordinated nvents with rep­utations for generating controvm­sy. 
But unlike the two productions at the center of the current cam­pus debate, the Hevue and Pep Hally are dorm-sponsored events and thus will not bn impacted by any decisions stemming from 
Jenkins' addresses, University spokesman Dennis Brown said Monday. 
"His addressAs were specific to acadnmie freedom," Brown said. "Hesidence halls would not fall under the umbrella since they are sp~m~ored by non-academic umts. 
This distinction betwenn aca­demic and non-academic units frames tlw administration's treat­ment of residence halls and aca­demic departments. Hesidence halls fall under the auspices of Student Activities, whilo academic departments fall under the authority of the Provost's Ollice.

It was the assignment of a lifetime. 

My 48-hour Roman whirlwind, as Observer photographer Claire Kelley noted in her column yesterday, was cer­tainly not the norm for a college journal­ist -or for any journalist, really. 
Maddie Hanna 
Like Claire, I was thrilled at the 
Associate 
opportunity to 

News Editor 
cover events sur­rounding the Board of Trustees meetings in Rome. 

Unlike Claire, however, I was way out of my comfort zone. 
I do not have a good track record with Europe. Granted, I've only been once ­a family spring break vacation when I was in eighth grade, three days in London and three in Paris. 
That week is best characterized as a mistake. My family fell asleep on the top of a double-decker bus, my mom dropped a lamp on my foot and I spent our last night in the City of Lights vomit­ing up French pastry. Unforgettable, to say the least. 
So while I couldn't wait to take my first steps in Italy, I was certainly apprehen­sive. 
And when we landed at Fiumicino Airport, I was beyond grateful to have an experienced, Italian-speaking traveler who spent a year in Home by my side. 
"Just do what I do," Oaire told me repeatedly, slipping our tickets into the machine. We hopped on the train. I spent most of the ride with a death grip on my purse, awkwardly trying to avoid eye eontact with all potential pickpockets. 
Several train and bus rides later, we were in the heart of the city. I was enthralled. Student in South Bend one day, reporter in Rome the next. 

But it wasn't quite as glamorous as I had imagined it would be. Journalism, wherever you do it, is hard work. On multiple oeeasions. we were running through the cobblestone streets -most notably around the Vatican wall, search­ing desperately for the press entrance. 
Despite my best efforts to blend -I changed shoes after Claire told me "san­dals scream American" -my Midwestern naivete was glaringly obvi­ous, as was my nonexistent understand­ing of the Italian language. My contribu­tion to Claire's conversations was to smile and mumble "grazie" under my breath. 
I hit rock bottom on our flight home from Italy. With only an hour of sleep the night before and suffering from what I would call jet shock -lag is just too mild a term -Claire and I passed out imme­diately. I woke up an hour later, freezing despite my best efforts to cover myself with my coat and coveting a blanket on a nearby seat. 
"Hello? Scusi? Help?" I whispered to the man behind me, contacts shifted and glued to my eyes. Heceiving a blank stare, I shuffied down the aisle and tried repeatedly to yank the blanket out of the seat behind me -a blanket wrapped tightly around a sleeping woman, who was not very understanding of my confu­sion. 
Incompetent as I felt, we got the job done, with beautiful photos and beautiful Rome bylines. It was my first foray into international journalism, and hopefully not the last. 
But for now, I'm relieved to be back in the U.S.

Kangaroo undergoes lip surgery after wolf bite 
MOORPARK, Calif. -Feznick, an aspiring celebri­ty kangaroo, underwent lip surgery because he was bit­ten by a wolf at a Hollywood animal farm. 
The 75-pound kangaroo underwent plastic surgery on Sunday and veterinarians say the marsupial will soon be ready to resume his act­ing career. 
Feznick is an aspiring actor who often appears at corporate events and was on the red carpet for the open­ing of last year's movie flop "Kangaroo Jack," his owner Eadie McMullan said. 

Last year, Feznick stuck his snout under a fence at a Kern County farm for Hollywood animals and was bitten by a wolf, leaving the 4-.year-old kangaroo with a toothy, Billy Idol-style sneer, veterinarian Scott Amsel said. 
Arcade claw offers live lobster prizes 
SCARBOROUGH, Maine ­You don't have to be a fish­erman to catch lobsters any­more. At a neighborhood store in this Portland suburb -and at restaurants and bars in more than a dozen states -customers can plunk down $2 for a chance to catch their very own lob­ster using a mechanical claw in an arcade-style game. 
The apparatus is a new version of the old-style amusement game where players put in a quarter or two in hopes of grabbing a stufl'ed animal. But instead of plush toys, the Love Maine Lobster Claw game has a water-filled tank full of lobsters. 
When a lobster is caught, the restaurants cook it for free and serve it with side dishes.

Architect explains designing divisions 
By RYAN SYDLIK News Writer 
Distinguished architect, critic and pont Hobert Campbell addressed the divisions in design and thinking that ol'tnn occur bntwmm modern and tradi­tional architects in a lncturn Monday night titled "Why Don't the Host of Us l.ikn the Buildings that Architncts I.ike'?" 
To start his leeturn, at times humor­ous and at timns serious, Pulitznr Prize­winner Carnpboll usod tho Scottish par­lianwnt building as an exampln of the rlash betwoon modern and radical arehitndural thought. 
While the building had won the Storling Prize the media ran a story shortly thcreaftor titled "Dnmolition," with a poll saying the building was one of tho twelvn most hatnd buildings in all of Britain. 
Campholl deseribod the situation as "a measure of the radical disconnect in our time." 
lie attributed this disconnect to the avant-garde movement, which is a form of arehitneture that completely violates the norms. 
Campbell said in the minds of its praetitiorwrs, "(Avant-garde( was help­ing a new future to be born." 
lie went on to describe the situation at the University of Virginia, where some modern-style buildings were con­structed but did not fit in with the cam­pus look. 
This led the University to hire some­one to oversee construction to ensure all new buildings would bn more tradi­tional in form. This move was criticized, based on the Jeffersonian principle of progressivism. Opponents said there was a dill"eronco between men~ly look­ing Jeffersonian and aetually being Jell'ersonian by building radical designs. 
This anecdote servnd as the lead into onn of Campbell's main points. The architecture Jefferson proposed was already brandnd from Greece and Rome, he said. 
"Jelforson wanted to speak in a lan­guage that the public could under­stand," Campbell said. "Jeflerson knew you eould be innovative if you knowing­ly violate convention as opposed to eom­pletely ignoring it." 
from here, Campbell entered into the main thrust of his lecture: art in all periods has to work between memory and invention. 
"The tension between [memory and invention] is where great architecture comes from," he declared. 
Campbell said traditional architects want everything to look beautiful according to a fantasy history they have been conditioned to love, and radical architects do not want to waste time with the quaint past and choose to live in the present or the future. 
Campbell was especially critical of the radical movement. 
"Avant-gardism is the curse of the 20th century ... It is a love affair of shapes that can be generated on com­puters," he said. 
Campbell said he valued originality and variety, as long as architecture had meaning. 
He described architecture's purpose as the art of making habitable places as opposed to being primarily an intellec­tual activity. 
He said, "Should a building be a metaphor? Did Einstein and Freud live and work in metaphors? No." 
Campbell closed the discussion by giv­ing two pieces of advice to aspiring architects. 
"Do more freehand drawing and go out and travel now when you aren't tied down by a spouse and a mortgage," he said.

Institutional Research. Last year, 82 percent of the senior class had jobs or had been accepted to graduate school or service projects. 
"Three months post-gradu­ation that percentage increased to 95 percent with 5 percent still seeking employment," Svete said. 
Ahead of the game 
While commencement cere­monies are not scheduled until May 21, some seniors like chemical engineering major Pamela Jefson have already secured jobs in their intended fields. Jefson said she will be working for Johnson & Johnson in its Global Operations and Leadership Development pro­gram. 
Jefson said she interviewed for the position and received an offer in November. During the next two years, she will be rotating between three dif­ferent companies -the first of which is with a medical device company in Juarez, Mexico. 
"While I am not certain how applicable my technical class­es will be, I believe the ana­lytical and problem solving skills that I have developed as an engineer will allow me to be successful in any rota­tion I may encounter," she said. 
The adjustment from living in the Midwest -where Jefson has spent her entire life -to working in a foreign country will be most stagger­ing, she said. 
"The cultural and lifestyle differences are innumerable," she said. "One of my biggest challenges will be getting used to not blending in with the majority of my co-work­ers and neighbors." 
Eddie Song, a double major in FFT and sociology, said he is "pretty certain" he will have a job next year in Japan as an English instructor. Additionally, he will be apply­ing to film production jobs to build a "solid network" in the business. 
Song said he will incorpo­rate skills honed during his time at the University in his anticipated career. 
"I will use all of my film production skills gained from the film classes here, apply film theory to make smart movies and use my sociology background to heighten my awareness of different audi­ence groups," he said. 
Other graduating seniors plan to continue in academia and have already secured their pathways for graduate school. Kat Roblez -a dou­ble major in political science and Spanish with a minor in Science, Technology and Values -will be attending Harvard Law School next fall. 
Roblez said research skills acquired at Notre Dame will "definitely" be helpful in grad school. 
"More than the classroom experience, my personal experiences at ND have helped me to grow into a much more mature, focused and centered person," she said. "Although many of my fellow students at Harvard will be much older, I feel quite prepared for the experi­ence."

Attorney General calls donzestic spying 'early warning systenz' for terrorists

Senators raisnd doubts 
about the legal rati"onale 
for the Bush administra­
tion's eavesdropping pro­
gram Monday, foreing 
Attorney Gennral Alberto 
Gonzales to provide a 
lengthy defense of the 
operations hn eallnd a vital 
"early warning systnm" for 
terrorists. 
;\ handful of Hepublieans joinnd Democrats in raising questions about whethnr Prnsicllmt Bush went too far in ordering the National Security Agnncy's monitor­ing operations. Tho sena­tors were particularly trou­blnd by the administration's argument that a Septembnr 2001 eongressional resolu­tion approving use of mili­tary foren covered the sur­veillance of some domestic communieations. 
"The president does not havr. a blank eher.k," said .I udieiary Chairman Arlen Spneter, R-Pa., who wants the administration to ask the secretive Fornign lntelligencn Surveillanco Court to reviow the pro­gram. 
"You think you're right. but thero are a lot of people who think you're wrong," Speetor told Gonzales. "What do you have to lose if you're right?" 
Gonzales didn't respond to Spector's proposal directly. "We are eontinual­ly looking at ways that we ean work with the FISA court in being more effi­cient and more effective," said the formor Texas judge. 
Under Bush's orders, the ultra-seeret National Security Agency has been eavesdropping -without warrants -on internation­al eommunieations of peo­ple in the United States whose calls and e-mails may be linked to Muslim extremists. 
During the daylong com­mittee hearing, Gonzales and the senators reaehed as far back as eavesdrop­ping ordered by President Washington and delved into court deeisions surround-


ing presidential powers and the 197H Foreign lntelligenr.o Surveillance Act. 
Gonzales repeatedly defended the current pro­gram as lawful, reasonable and essential to national seeurity. He said the presi­dent's authority was strongest in a time of war, and he called the monitor­ing operations an "early warning system designed for the 21st century." He said no changes in law were needed to accommo­date the monitoring. 
"To end the program now would be to afford our enemy dangerous and potential deadly new room for operation within our own borders," he said. 
Democrats pressed Gonzales for details about the program and other sim­

to Chicago with friends. "Heck yeah, I'm ready to start making money," Paunicka said. 
Katie Jo Cornelius, an English literature and secondary educa­tion major who is spending her final semester student teaching at Saint Mary's, has not secured a job yet. But she knows she wants to find a position in Lafayette, Ind. 
" I don't have a job, but I'm not nervous," Cornelius said. 
Jefl' Roberts, the director of the Saint Mary's Center for Career Opportunities, said the seniors he has met the last few weeks are not "panicked" but "alert and highly motivated." 

"My message to seniors is it is never to late to use the Career Center, and if people feel behind, it is all the more reason,'' Hoberts said. 
Many seniors have already been accepted into graduate pro­grams, including law and dental school, Roberts said. Students majoring in computer science, fmance, business and marketing usually have the most success securing positions while still in school. 
Other majors, such as educa­tion, will not truly start their search until late spring and early summer. 
Charlotte Orzel, the only senior vocal performance major at the College this year, spent the last three and a half years preparing for a career in opera. But after a stressful fall semester she decided not to apply to graduate pro­grams in music and instead hopes to find a job in business. 
"The career of a musician is dif­ferent,'' Orzel said. "The lifestyle [is] very isolated, and there are no short term goals." 
Job-hunting can be tremen­
dously time-consuming, Roberts said. 
"The rule of thumb is that for every $10,000 [you want to earn] you should plan on spending a month in full-time work search­ing,'' Roberts said. 
Anne Knable, an elementary education major, went abroad to find a job. She will be teaching next year at The Irish Institute. an all-boys K-12 Catholic school in Monterrey, Mexico. 
''I'm ready to move to Mexico and be in the warm [weather],'' Knable said. 
Leaving Saint Mary's is an exciting but nerve-wracking prospect for many seniors. 
"It's kind of bittersweet," Cornelius said. ''I'm excited but I feel like I just grew so much here . . . It was just a huge part of my life where I became a whole new person."

Where has romanticism gone today? I am not speaking of the sappy and overly sentimental modern conception of the word, but rather in the literary sense of a general out­look upon life. This outlook embraces strong, passionate emotions, the value of individual cre­ativity and a love for the useless, fleeting, yet ulti­mately beautiful things in life. Some condemn romantics as being foolhardy idealists with no concern for the practical realities of life. However, the romantic is capable of great action within the world, and is indeed spurred towards such action by his strength of feeling. Romanticism, far from being a weak philosophy of mere dreamers, caused the great poet Lord Byron to throw his fortunes, and ultimately his life. into the Greek War of Independence­despite being no more a Greek than a soldier. His death was not an absurd, rash and foolish decision; it was the culmination of a life well spent clasp­ing life by its very fiber. 
The romantic emphasis upon strong emotions and passions is the inherent strength of the movement. Modern existence's complexity is diametrical­ly opposed to romanticism, and seems to have throttled the move­ment to the brink of its very death. The societal need to sustain this com­plex civilization has produced increasingly sterile generations focused upon merely climbing the modern "cursus honorum." People subordinate the vibrancy and poten­tial of their humanity to a common­place existence of fulfilling require­ments so as to advance towards the 

Ian Ronderos 
Liberated 

next step in the quest for the success. The contemporary understanding of success is hollow. Many people spend their entire lives wasting away in a safe, mediocre existence and never take time to savor the fiery passion of life. Our existence is full of emo­tion and feeling. Life is immediate. For all I know, a comet could hit me within the next minute, and my exis­tence could be snuffed out like a can­dle. Unpredictability is the only cer­tainty in the course of human affairs. Shall I face death burning in the embers of life, or suppressed by the stagnation of perpetual preparation? I should like to take the former. 
The aforementioned is an affirma­tion of existence and a solution to the misery born from the discord between the inborn vivacity of the individual and the timorous yoke society placed upon him. The roman­tic focus on the human potential pro­duces a pleasing life. A person finds harmony by living in accord with his internal drive to live out the innate exuberance of his passions. It must be noted that a wise person must be able to discriminate between the nobler passions and the baser ones. 
A person cannot entirely give in to his passions -particularly the harmful or unethical ones -but a rational decision to embrace life in all its brilliance and wonder leads a person to happiness. If a person should live the best and most full life he possibly can, then he would con­quer the transient nature of exis­tence that so terrifies many. The fleeting nature of things means noth­ing if one is focused most upon the very moment she is in and appreci­ates its beauty and tragedy. That is not to say that one should live with­out any abandon and think nothing of the future, but rather that the emphasis should be on the here and now. Hesitation to live leads but to regrets. No one wants to turn out like Eliot's J. Alfred Prufrock. The calcu­lated risk-adverse nature of our soei­ety paralyzes. 
A love for the useless, pleasant things in life is also characteristic of romantics. A disproportionate con­cern with utility reveals to strong a focus on the future, one that should be abandoned. Such a focus betrays a servile dedication to fulfilling soci­ety's desire to control the human spirit. Romanticism is a celebration of the individual, but this does not mean that romantics are self-cen­tered egotists. Concern for others is a very romantic concept, as compas­sion and selflessness are two of the most moving, noble and powerful of human emotions. The true romantic is not an individualist in the sense of caring nothing for the plight of oth­ers. A person of spirit must further­more cultivate a balance between the useful and pleasant. To live without any attention to the useful is obvious­ly an impossible way of life; to live without anything of the pleasant is to live a mundane existence best fitted to a machine. 
Ultimately, it is the beautiful and pleasant that we should seek by using objects of utility to aid us in this quest. As the romantic poet John Keats wrote, "Beauty is truth, truth beauty -that is all ye know on earth, and all ye need to know."

LETTER TO THE EDTIOR 

Controversy a blessing in disguise 
Censorship is bad! "The Vagina Monologues" are the Anti­Christ! Our academic freedom is being destroyed! Our morality is in jeopardy! Okay, okay, I think we've all got it by now. And if we keep playing the same arguments on repeat with steadily increasing volume for the next few months, we might just go insane. 
We can talk circles around each other about our polarized opin­ions on the best means to contend with the issue of Catholic stan­dards vs. academic liberty for weeks if we want-and the abun­dance of discussion on campus is undoubtedly a good thing. However, I feel that our debate will go nowhere if we keep hear­ing these same opinions shouted back and forth without any backup. Of course many students will unfailingly contend that the elimination of "The Vagina Monologues" and the Queer Film Festival is abhorrent, and of course their more conservative counterparts will argue that the University must not stray from traditional Catholic ideals. 
In nearly every article I've read regarding the Monologues, though, the issues have been so grossly simplified that it is impos­sible to know whether or not people have just taken hold of their generalliberaVconservative argument of choice and run with it, regardless of what they actually know about the Monologues and its messages. I'm not gonna lie, I haven't read the play. So how

can I know whether or not it is truly as anti-Catholic as is con­tended? I really have no grounds to make an intelligent argument for or against the University's suppression of the event. Sure, I don't believe in censorship, but there must be more to it than that, right? And yeah, it doesn't seem very Catholic to wax poetic about premarital sex, but there's no way that's as deep as this issue runs. I propose we all do a little homework if we want these debates to be at all fruitful. Let's find out some actual specific details from the Monologues if we want to argue its morality rather than hearing the word "vagina" and automatically bran­dishing our crucifixes and holy water. 
Let's take a little time to think about what effects sponsorship or censorship would have on our academic life and what paths of action we have available, rather than immediately crying "dicta­torship." If we strive to be adequately informed about all aspects and contentions in this debate and hence can have an enlighten­ing discussion rather than a series of recycled inferences, I feel this controversy will be a blessing in disguise for Notre Dame.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Father Jenkins' challenge 
Early lw;t term, Tlw Observer print1~d a filllr-part lnttnr in which I encouraged Fatlwr John .llmkins to engage a public debate on tlw way Notrn Damn is bdng run like a conmwrdal entnrprise. as well as on rl'latnd issues concnrning il'i PH operations and il'> methods of evaluating academic JWrliwmarm~. Hnsolution of various prob­lnms <L'isodatnd with tlwse issues, I argued, is ITW'ial to our future as a top-ranked Catholic university. Debate on thnsn matt1~rs may still be lilrtheorning. For the moment, how1wnr, Jenkins h<L'> ehosnn to li1cus on the interaction bntwmm Catholic valtws (or (:a tho lie dmraetnr) and acadmnic rrnedom instnad. The inlu~n~nt danw~r of making this topic tlw (ileus of a public discussion is that there is no shan~d undorst.anding within the University of what nitlwr Catholic dmracter or academic frm~dom amounl'i to. In somo s1~1'.tors, "Catholic values" is a mde-tnrm mandating strid orthodoxy in matters of' rnproductiv1~ morality, whnmas othnrs usn it in a snnsP having morn to do with sodaljus­tiee and shan·d neonomie opportunity. Similarly. "aradnmie frnedom" is under­stood by some to signify lack of rPstrictions in tlw conduct oftmtrhing and scholarship, while otlwrs intnrprnt it <L'> meaning free­dom to pursun truths divinely mnvnynd through tho institutional Church. 
In point of filet, Notrn I>arne is home to Catholics of wid Ply divergent leanings (a<; well <L'> to persons of otlwr litiths, which is not our presnnt concern). At one extreme an~ mnsnrvativos who make every emlrt to eomply impeccably with the teachings they pnrceivn a-; being p<L<;snd on through thn Church. At the other extreme is a group of' liberal adivisl'> seemingly dndicated to changing Chun:h teaching instnad. Wlille most of us are situated somewhere in the middle, wo still havn leanings toward one or the other of' thn two oxtmmns. Holations bntwmm these two polns of Catholicism at Notn~ Dame havn never benn ea<>y. Mary Kate Malone's Jan. 30 artido in The Obsnrvnr provided a valuable service in reminding us that local tensions between theso two orientations go back to the time when wn initiatnd a serious attempt to beeonw a ranking national university. Needless to say, that ellilrt is still underway. To avoid losing ground IL'i the nflilrt contin­ues, those disruptivn tensions must be con­vertnd into a produetive ennq..,ry joining lib­erals and conservatives in a eommon cause. 

It is hard to imagine a major national uni­versity that conceives academic freedom in terms primarily of the pursuit of' divinely mvealnd truth. It is equally hard to imagine a genuinely Catholic university whose con­eeption of' morality is limited to concerns of' soeialjustkn. II' Notre Dame is to becomn a major aeademic !'oren whilo remaining fully Catholic, it must enlist support from libnral and eonservativn liwces alike.

Libertarians mistaken 
In tlwir Idler or Feb. I ("Protecting Freedoms), The College libertarians or Notre Dame rec­ognized that our University is a private institution, and therefiJre not bound by certain legal strictures eoneerning l'rne speeeh lbr its students. Unf(wtunatnly, I do not think that they actual­ly apprndatn tlw difl(~nmee that this distinction makes. I have three objections to their article. 
First, I worknd filr Film this past summer and ean shed some light on why it gave Notre Damn a Hnd Light. It is not f(Jr the reasons that the Libertarians would like you to assume. FIHE's rating system ean be violated in many dillerent ways, and a quiek look at their Web site shows that Notrn Dame's "problems" are not the rnsult of our recent eontroversy. Indeed almost all of' the policies that FIHE eritiques foeus on tho vagueness or our hara-;sment poli­cies. Thn only other dillkulties that FIHE deems problematic indude rogulations on student dmnonstrations and limitations on obscene, pornographic, sexually explicit or offensive mate­rial put on postnrs or sont through the University sorvers. Neither of' these relate to our pres­nut controversy. The College Libertarians tried to suggost otherwise; don't bn f(loled. 
Snmnd, <L'> they point out, private, and espeeiaUy religious, institutions like Notre Dame have long maintaint~d the f'rnt~dom to educate their studenl'i aceording to a certain moral code. FIHE recognizes this too: "if' a private colloge wishes to place a partieular set of moral, philosophical or religious teaehings above a commitment to tree expression, it has every right to do so." lndnnd, "Private eolleg1~s and universities should be hnld to the standard that they tlwmselvns establish." So, let's look at the promises that Notre Dame has made to us. In the Mission Statmnnnt. the University prodaims that it is dedicated to academic freedom. It says two things or intnrnst: "A-; a Catholic university one of il<> distinctive goals is to provide a lilrtlm whnrn through frne inquiry and open diswssion the various lines of' Catholic thought may intersed with all the lilrms or knowledge." A-; of now, the Vagina Monologues will still intnrsmt with Catholk thought. just in a dill'nnmt filrum. 
The Mission Statmnent also prodaims that, "the University insist-; upon academic freedom which makes open discussion and inquiry possible." This is the crux of the issue. Wl1at does academic t'rt~edom mean at Notre Dame? I would propose that what Father Jenkins is doing at this juncture is trying to lind and elucidate nxaetly the answer to that question. And kindly, lw h<L'> a-;knd us to help. This leads to my third and final point: thn Notre Dame Libertarians hav1~ laid out their moral argument <L'> to what academic freedom should mean, and I for one am not convinced. They claim that "to limit the possibility of what a studont may learn does dism~dit to the mission of' education." But this is not what is happening; Jenkins said that the school will not limit what a ~tu(flmt may learn bneausf~ fitculty are free to toach dasses that usn tlw Vagina Monolo~-,ruos and students aro allilwnd to take that dass. Tho University's focus is not on limiting what a student may lnarn, but on controlling il'i own speech so that ruturn studenl'i, mrrnnt studenl'i, alumni and the rest of'tlw world know exactly what Notre Dame is saying. It has not only a legal right to do so, but a<> an institution of' the Catholic Church, a moral duty. The Libertarians also daim that the studonts are the true reason this University exislo.;. I'm not so sure I would complntely agren. The Mission Statement says that the University is "d1~dicatnd to the pursuit and sharing of' truth for its own sake." All faculty and studmtl'> are invited to join the Univt~rsity in that search. A<> a Catholic institution however, the University bdinves that wn alrnady know some of' that truth a-; it ha-; been revealed to us through .Jesus Christ, through the Church that he established and through the Bible that it, guided by the lloly Spirit. omm~d to tl1e world. Indudnd in that revelation is the moaning about human sexuality and f(~mininity. The Univnrsity is not only allowed, but h<L'> an obliga­tion to nnsurn that thn truth to whieh it is dndieatnd is not tainted by contrary understandings about the nwaning and fulfillnwnt of the human w~rson. Our Lady gel<> to speak too and not have lwr words garbled by others.

Church), Jenkins hiL'i ratcheted up the tnn­sions bntwenn these contrasting forces in a manner that may prove counterproductive. The imminent dangflr is that he will use his prnsidontial authority to mete out vietory to one side and dernat to the other. If his final verdict is that aeadnmic freedom trumps Catholic values across the board. there will be cries of outrage among conservatives and sighs of relief' from the other direction. In the long tnrm, such a decision might make it diflicult to maintain the University's distinctively Catholic charaetnr. 
On the other hand, if' he decides that Catholic values systematically take preen­donee over academic freedom, this would cause rnjoieing among eonservativos but despair among liberals. (Not incidentally, such a deei<>ion would also got him oil' the hook with members or the Catholic hierar­chy and of the Board ofTrustoes who may well have encouraged him to raise the issun in the first place). The long-tnrm conse­quences of this docision, however, would bode poorly for Notre Dame's prospecl<> of becoming a first-rate academic institution. 
I laving already stirred up tl1e hornnt's nest, Jenkins' most promising strategy may be to look I'or a way of' enabling both sectors to emerge from the fray thinking of'them­solvos a<> winners. After all. both arn essen­tial parl<> of' the University he has been called to lead; and he must prove himself' capable of inspiring both fiJr the long haul ahnad. A false step at this point would increa<>e the likelihood of' Notre Dame's becoming either an a1~ademic institution with diminishing Catholic presence or a staunchly Catholic institution with diminish­ing acadnmie credibility. 
A-; a student of' ancient and mmlieval phi­losophy, Jenkins sumly knows of Plato's eondusion that a successful statesman must lind a way of blending thn mntm-;ting tal­onl'> of' thn morn virile and the morn compli­ant characters within the state. lf'thn virile pmdominate. the state will be roeknd by eonstant warf'arn; whnreas if' the meek have their way, it will soon fall in dolimt. This teaching in Plato's "Statesman" is the film­runner or Aristotle's doctrine of tlin mean. A<> courage is tho moan bntwnnn cowardice and filolhardiness, so virtue in general takes the middlo ground betwmm opposing extremes. In our current situation, extrm1w liberalism and nxtrnrnt~ eonservatism are both excesses to bn avoided. Our eommon good lies in linding a modus opnrandi some­whore in the middle. Civm1 his curn~nt posi­tion of leadership, it is Jenkins' task to dirnct us along a path that leads toward Notrn Dame's becoming a genuinely Catholic university with genuinely top­ranked acadomie staturn. I lis challengt~ at the moment is to lind a way of turning his back on partisan extremes and ol'lnading all sectors of the University toward an out­como that makes us all winners.

Monologues can still be useful tool 
The "Vagina Monologues" is scan­dalous to the faithful and non-faithful alike for many reasons. On the sur­face, the name is vulgar and evokes an image unbecoming of any univer­sity. Some of its skil<> glorify rape and abortions; others degrade men as a way to combat violence. These are not issues that should be glorified at any university, much less a Catholic university. In the name of "aeademie freedom" this production has had the privilege or being performed in the DPAC in coordination with a V-Day and fundraising for YWCA and S.O.S. Banning the "Vagina Monologues" from public, university or depart­ment-sponsored performance does not hinder aeademic freedom at all. If anything, the inquiries that the play raises would be more conducive to a classroom setting, where more pnople would actually be able to voice their opinions about the eon­tents of the play. True academic endeavors should aim to lind the truth, not play oil' the emotions of' students. 
What I suggest is an effort by stu­dents and the administration and faculty alike to try to lind another means to combat the issues of vio­lence against women. It is ludicrous to think that the only way to raise awareness about violence against women is with a crude perf(Jrmanee. The Edith Stein Project is one way through which studnnts are address­ing the issues that need to be brought forward in light of Catholic teaching. Many colleges have taken up the "Take Back the Night" campaign, which looks at the issues of' violence against women in the local neighbor­hoods, and visually makes a state­ment by a night march in many cities. There eould also be fundrais­ing for the local YWCA outside of 

context of the Vagina Monologues in 
the same way other organizations and dubs raise money on campus. 
The "Queer Film Festival" is also an ama of contention with the Church's sexual ethics. Films that glorify homosexuality and festivals that host speakers that only support homosnxuallifestyles without rnser­vations are in dirnd r.ontrast with the Catholic Church, and thnrefore the University of Notre Damn, which is an institution undnr the Church. I Iowever, I do not believe that the "Queer Film Festival" should bn abol­ished. To be honest, I am not sure how to precisoly makn the film festi­val conf(lrm to the tmu:hings of thn Church. Whiln using films, it could bn possible to look at the dillieultins that homosexuals have in soddy. The films could also be ust~d to look at stylistic aspecl<> of film in germral ­all in line with Catholic teaching. While advocates of honwsnxuality eould present thnir side, the issuns should remain largely in eonlimnity to the Church. I Iornosexuals deserve to bn treated with dignity, but. that does not moan that their sexual pref­erences need to be glorified. Sexuality is a broad and eomplicated topic, but it is not something that neods to be flaunted around liko a banner over each person's head cry­ing out "I am gay" or "I am straight." Thn issues address1~d by both the "Vagina Monologuos" and tho "Queer Film Festival" obviously neml to be addressed; they r.an be addrnssed, though, in dilfernnt ways and by dif'­lilrlmt means that acquiesce to the Catholic identity and dmraeter of' the University of Notre Dame.

"Keep your seat. You will not be dis­

led both the role of director and actor. 
The work tells the tale of Arnolphe 
(Danny Kettinger). a middle-aged 
Frenchman who, out of an almost 
paranoid rear of infidelity. raises a 
young girl, Agnes (Mary Twetten) in tho 
total soclusion of a convent to later be

Wary NFL silences Mick Jagger during parts ofhalftime show 
Associated Press NEW YOHK The Pittsburgh Steelers' victory over the Seattle Seahawks in the Super Bowl was watched in an average of 45.85 million homes, the second-highest 
total in television history behind the linal episode of 'M­A-S-II' in 1983. 
Pittsburgh's 21-10 victory Sunday got a 41.6 preliminary national rating, Nielsen Media Service said Monday, up slight­ly from the 41.1 rating last year. The share remained the same at 62. 
The game was watched by an estimated 141.4 million people in the United States, ABC said, the second-highest 
total to view a program behind the 144.4 million who tuned to New England's victory over Carolina in the 2004 Super Bowl. That number estimates the total amount of people to watch the game at any point. 
The estimated average of 
90.7 million people -or the estimated number of viewers throughout -was the largest Super Bowl audience since the Steelers last played in the title game in 1996, a loss to Dallas

that attracted an average of 
94.1 million people watching. This year's audience was 5 percent bigger than the 86.1 million people who watched the Patriots beat the Philadelphia Eagles last year. 
In 1983, the final episode of 'M-A-S-H' was watched in an average or 50.15 million homes. 
Super Bowl viewers feasted on another halftime show con­troversy, when the NFL briefly shut off Mick Jagger's micro­phone to avoid sexually-sug­gestive lyrics in two Rolling Stones songs. ABC also scored solid ratings for an episode of "Grey's Anatomy" following the game. 
While the Steelers won by 11 points, the game wasn't really decided until the final five minutes or so, which kept the audience attracted, said Larry Hyams, ABC research execu­tive. 
"The Super Bowl obviously is a national event and people are going to tune in regardless of whether the teams have national appeal," Hyams said. "It's up to the game to hold thn audience." 
The Super Bowl is tradition­ally the biggest television event of the year. The Academy Awards, jokingly called the Super Bowl for women, often comes in second; last year, 41.5 million people saw the Oscars. 
Pittsburgh had the largest Super Bowl rating (percentage of all sets, whether on or orn of any media market, with a 57.1, Nielsen said. Seattle fol­lowed directly behind with a 55. 
The "Grey's Anatomy" Ppisode after the game was seen by 38.1 million pnople, Nielsen said. That's 15 million more than has ever watchnd a single episode of the medical soap. It was the most-watched entertainment program of the season so far -even beating "American Idol." 
Since 1991, only two post­Super Bowl programs have drawn a bigger audience: "Survivor" in 2001 and "Friends" in 1996. It was solid exposure for a series that has already been growing in appeal during its second sna­son.

NFL 
AP A line of Seahawks players greets fans at a rally Monday for the NFC champion Seattle Seahawks. Seattle, which lost Super Bowl XL to the Pittsburgh Steelers 21-10, is still dwelling on the play of the team during the champi­onship despite having the best season in Seahawk's franchise history. 
Seahawks can't forget Super Bowl mistakes 
Associated Press 
DETROIT -No apprecia­tion or consolation in Seattle for the Seahawks, at least not yet. 
Nope, they were still stuck in frustration. 
The post-Super Bowl par­ties went into early Monday morning as the Seahawks at least tried to celebrate their season, instead of their somber Sunday. Later, coach Mike Holmgren tried to refocus the team, momentarily, on what it had done and what it still may do. 
"We're all a little disap­pointed this morning," Holmgren said at the team's hotel in suburban Dearborn, just before the team returned to Seattle and hours after the Seahawks' mistake-filled, 21-10 loss to Pittsburgh. "But I'm very, very proud of our football team, what we accomplished this year. We're going to come back firing away next year." 
After flying home, they went directly to a rally of a few thousand fans at Qwest Field. They came to cele· brate a franchise-best 15-4 season, a team-record 11­game winning streak and their first playoff win since 1984 as best they could. 
The civic pick-me-up was intended to move the team and its city past Seattle's Super Bowl implosion. But because the Seahawks feel they squandered the NFL championship, the future isn't foremost in their minds. 
"It's hard, man," defen­sive tackle Rocky Bernard said. 
And he didn't mean the pulled right hamstring he sustained late in the Super Bowl. 
"I mean, if a team just goes out and overpowers you, then you're like, 'Hey, we got beat.' But I think we beat ourselves," Bernard said. 
So did most of his team­mates -and even the per­spective-filled Holmgren. 
"I know they're not OK with it," the coach said of his players. "I wanted them to keep their heads up. There's no need to apolo­gize for anything. We lost the football game and we lost it because of the rea­sons you lose most games ... mistakes." 
The best team in Seahawks history was in no mood to revel in its accom­plishments. 
"Nah, man," linebacker 
D.D. Lewis said. "I thought about that last week . 

IN BRIEF Italians announce criminal 
drug policies for Olympics 
TURIN, Italy -Italian police have no plans to raid the Olympic village in search of banned substances, but ath­letes who test positive will be sent to court under Italy's criminal anti-dop­ing laws. 
"Police will not enter the village," Mario Pescante, a senior IOC member and Italian government official, said Monday. "This is not going to hap­pen." 
The prospect of police raids on the village and athletes being led away in handcuffs has been a major issue in the leadup to the games, which open Friday. 
Pescante was referring to random searches. The IOC has said it would not object if police, acting on a tip-off, went into the village to arrest any ath­letes or coaches trafficking in banned substances. 
Pescante tried unsuccessfully to get the Italian Parliament to suspend the anti-doping laws for the period of the Olympics. Legislators contended that such a move would show weakness. 
Stevie Wonderboy drops out 
of Kentucky Derby 
ARCADIA, Calif. Stevie Wonderboy has a small fracture in his right front leg that will keep the Breeders' Cup Juvenile champion and Eclipse winner out of the Kentucky Derby. 
Trainer Doug O'Neill said the colt came out of a workout Monday with the injury. 
"Stevie Wonderboy worked great today, then came out of it with a little filling in his ankle," O'Neill said. "We X-rayed it and he's got a hairline frac­ture of his right front ankle. They're supposed to do surgery in a couple of days. 
"He will be out at Merv Griffin's farm in La Quinta (Calif.) for 90 days before coming back into training." 
Owned by hotel and television mag­nate Griffin, Stevie Wonderboy fin­ished second behind Brother Derek in his 3-year-old debut in the Jan. 14 San Rafael Stakes at Santa Anita. 
Sall}pson pleads not guilty in 
pel]ury case 
RICHMOND, Va. -Former NBA star Ralph Sampson pleaded not guilty Monday to charges that he lied about his finances to obtain court­appointed counsel in a federal child support case. 
The 7-foot-4 former Virginia All­American was indicted last month on one count each of perjury and making a false claim. 
The charges stem from a child sup­port case in which Sampson, 45, was charged with failure to pay more than $300,000 in child support to two daughters by different women. Under a plea agreement, he was to repay the child support and be spared prison time and fines. 
At the time, his attorney said Sampson was working without salary for an online communications firm, but the indictment alleged Sampson had spent at least one month earning $5,000 as a consultant.

NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL 


Miller prepared for his starting shot 
Former walk-on now plays big part for the rebuilding Tar Heels 
Assudated Press 
CHAPEL IIII.L, N.C. -Wes Miller knows he's not sup­posed to bn horn. 
Former walk-ons and undersiznd shooting guards just don't play signifieant minutos l'or a sehool where names likn Jordan and Worthy hang in tho rafters beside national ehampionship banners. And they eortainly don't end up in the starting lineup. 
Yet there he is for North Carolina, a team lighting l'or every point after losing its top seven seorers from last year's NCAA champions. Miller is no longer the anonymous player who transl'erred to serve as practice !'odder for first-round NBA draft piek Haymond Felton. There's no more hop­ing to play just a few minutes at the end of a blowout. 
And as the Tar Heels (14-5. 5-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) prepare for No. 2 Duke on Tuesday, the junior is savoring every minute, every 3-point shot and defensive stop as a key scholarship eon­tributor. 
"I always dreamed I'd be able to eontribute in a game situation and help us win games out on the floor," Miller said. "But that was never anything that was promised to me and it was never a given at all. I've always tried to play hard and certainly I've realized that when you play hard, you put yoursolf' in position to get out on tho l'loor." 
Miller, 5-foot-11 and a eom­paet 1H5 pounds, ean spot up from 3-point range while teams double down on fresh­man Tyler Hansbrough inside. And sinee coach Roy Williams moved him into the starting linnup last month, Miller has gone !'rom averaging six points in 19 minutes through the first 14 games to nearly 10 points in 2H minutes in the past live. 
The eoaehes have named him the Tar HeP!s' defensive player of the game a team­best seven times, ineluding threo sinee he bneamn a starter. Not bad for a guy who scored just 26 points last sea­son, his l'irst sineo transl'er­ring from James Madison in 2003. 
"It's a feel-good story," said Duke reserve Lee Melehionni, himself a walk-on before earning a scholarship like Miller. "But hopefully, he doesn't hit a shot against us." 
Miller's game is a tribute to hustle. He scraps on every play, whether he's pestering a ballhandler or diving on the floor for a loose ball. It's an approach that's well-suited for Williams, who is unrelent­ing when it comes to demand­ing effort from his players. 
"lie's got good technique and he works like crazy," Williams said. "I wrote on the board sometime maybe before Christmas two questions: 'Who do you guys think is the best shooter on the team?' and Who do you think works 


hardest at it?' It's a prntty easy deal." 
Miller is hitting 44 percent from 3-point range on tho season, an average bolstered by his 15-for-30 showing in five games as a starter. 
In his first start, he hit six 3s for a career-best 1H points in an H1-80 win at Florida State, the last 3 eoming with his team down 78-76 in the final minute. Two games later, Miller hit four more 3s and finished with 14 points in a win against Arizona. 
Miller's performance against the Seminoles, howev­er, stood out with Duke eoaeh Mike Krzyzewski. 
"I wondered how they won the game," Krzyzewski said. "And there's this little kid who hit six 3s, every time it looked like they were going to get blown out." 
Miller, however. sounds more proud of his del'ense. lie even took a moment before practice Monday to stop by the honors chart outside tho Smith Center locker room to count the number of times he was named defensive player of the game. 
Defense helped Milltw dur­ing an off shooting day 
Saturday against Clemson. Miller had five points on 2­l'or-7 shooting against tho Tigers, but drew threo charges and was again the team's top defender. 
"There's no question, el'fort's a big part of' tho way I'm trying to play," Miller said. "I would hope nobody ever says I'm not playing hard." 
Still, he doesn't sound too willing to reflect on his jour­ney just yet. The Tar Jleols are trying to rnakn it baek to the NCAA tournament for the third straight soason, whieh would be a significant feat for a team that lost four under­elassmen to tho NBA last year. 
lle'd certainly love a story­
book ending to Tuesday's game. In the North Carolina mndia guide, Miller said his dream "SportsCenter" high­light would be hitting a half­court shot at tho horn to boat tho Blue Devils. 
lley, anything ean happen. Miller's already proved that. 
"You don't see a lot of' guys my size playing at this level," he said. "This kind of just foil to mo. I was kind of in tlw right plaen at the right tinw.

Women's water polo starts season off strong 
Squash club begins with wins at West Coast Round Robin 
Special to The Observer 
The Notre Dame women's water polo club opened its sea­son this weekend by sweeping four opponents at the James Madison University Invitational in Harrisonburg, Va. In their first game, the Irish dominated Ohio University 16-3 behind the strong offense from the center. Junior Kristen Schmidt and freshman phenom Kelly Horner each rifled home four goals to pace the attack. 
Penn State fell to the Irish 11-4 in the second round, as Schmitt again found the net for four goals and senior M.C. Cimino splashed home three more. In the day's final con­test, the Irish pasted host JMU 16-2. Lightning-fast Cimino led the attack with six goals, fol­lowed by senior Kristy Bohling, who contributed three of her own. 

The last team to fall in the Irish's path of destruction was Duke on Sunday morning. With Cimino and Horner each accounting for four goals, and junior Bridget O'Neill another three, the Irish thumped the Blue Devils by a final count of 16-5. The squad will travel to Michigan next week where many regional rivals will be lying in wait for the Irish. 
Gymnastics 
The Notre Dame and Saint Mary's gymnastics club opened its season this weekend at the Miami Cup in Oxford, Ohio. Strong performances were turned in by both the men's and women's squads. Each of these squads has been ranked among the top ten teams in the country for the past ten years, with the men claiming two national titles and the women one during that span. 
The Irish women's squad was paced by freshman Anne Krishnan, who turned in a solid all-around performance adding up to a score of 31.375. Jill Mazur, Wendy Svetanuff, Cecilia Torres, Maura Stee, Jacquelyn Carney, Courtney Collins, and Lucianna Havasio all contributed to the team point total. The host Redhawks won the invitational, but other team and individual results were not available at the con­clusion of the meet due to a problem with the scoring pro­gram. It is expected that both Krishan and Svetanoff placed in individual events. 
Brian Dunn and Paul Kane stood out for the injury-deplet­ed Irish men's squad. The men's competition was won by Purdue, which will host The Golden Grips Invitational this coming weekend. The Irish hope to field a full complement of men at that event. 

Squash 
Notre Dame's squash club won four of six matches this weekend in the West Coast Round Robin, hosted by Stanford in a new six-court complex featuring an all-glass exhibition court. Captain James Zhang swept six match­es at the number one position to remain undefeated in CSA play this year. 
On Thursday, the Irish fell in their opener to the No. 22 Cardinal, 8-1, with Zhang's 3-0 win at number one the lone bright spot for the club. Friday proved to be the highlight of the weekend as the Irish swept USC 9-0. Trojan top seed Tyler Kurlas held a 2-1 lead over Zhang before falling in five games. 
The Irish dropped their next match to Washington in a 7-2 ren~atch of last year's CSA emerging teams division national championship. Michael Giordano and Zhang were the lone Irish to win against the Huskies, with Zhang avenging a loss last year to Saumil Gandhi. 
The Irish closed the CSA por­tion of the tournament with a pair of 8-1 victories over Cal Berkeley and Air Force. Phil Moss' exciting 3-2 win over the Golden Bears was the only closely contested match in the two contests. In an exhibition match, the Irish split a 4-4 contest with the UC Davis Graduate School club. Jose Palomo and Leigh Chapman both were victorious in five game matches. 
The CSA Nationals will be held at Princeton in two weeks and close the season for ·the Irish.

Heilman said Monday before 1,700 season-ticket holders at the Joyce Center. "I could go play professionally and make a lot of money and go that rout, or I tinish -come back and finish my career, play one more year with my team­mates. 
"It was something I eouldn 't pass up." 
Baseball also means a lot to current Notre Dame head football coach Charlie Weis, who was the lone catcher on the squad of 10 boys that composed the Middlesex High School (N.J.) varsity baseball team his senior year. 
But it doesn't mean as much as the lessons in responsibili­ty and teamwork Weis learned that year, when every person was so critical to the success of the "tenacious 10" that made it to the state finals after five of the original 15 players quit two games into the season. Weis said two of his nine teammates were members of his wedding party. 
"When I think about the les­sons I learned that senior year, I think that my founda­tions of being a team guy were established that year )through] the camaraderie we had in that group of ten guys," We is said in his keynote address at the event. "If I could get one message across to you, it's that you're not nearly as important as the team ... When you start some­~hin.g .~pecial, you have to lin­Ish It. 
Heilman did finish what ho started, and he did so with unprecedented exeollnnco for Notre Damn. lie started 15 games as a senior and turned in a 15-0 record for the Irish, fp,ading the squad to a nation­al No. 1 ranking late in the 
regular season,  a nnw  height  
for the University.  
During  the  banquet,  

lleilman and Weis highlighted the overriding theme of' the night -there should be more to athletics than just the product on the field. 
Heilman talked about the fall semester of' his freshman year, when his father got siek and the Logansport, Ind. native went to Irish coach Paul Mainieri to discuss the situation. 
"I was in shock. I didn't know what to do," Heilman said. "I was waiting for my sister to come pick me up and 
join Us

the hardest workers on the team." 
Connelly is also on track to l'inish among the top five in Notre Dame history in over­all doubles wins. She and partner Kiki Statsny are ranked No. 45 in the nation in doubles. 
The statistics and the 
team's quick start validate the decision to name her captain prior to the season, but that doesn't mean Connelly expected the title. 
"It meant a lot to be hon­ored as the captain because of how many other seniors arc on the team," Connelly said. "I want to keep every­one focused on their goals and not to ever become dis­couraged, to motivate every­one in practice and make workouts fun." 

Earning the captaincy also established a legacy of team captains in the Connelly family. Last season, her older sister, Sarah Jane Connelly, served as team captain for the 2004-05 sea­son. 
But Lauren Connelly brings her own distinct tal­ents. 
"She has one of the best backhands on the team," Thompson said. "That is what makes her so competi­tive. She has natural instincts around the net and is just an awesome doubles player." 
Despite the immediate comparisons, Connelly does not view the role as succes­sor to her older sister as intimidating. Instead, she sees this opportunity as an honor to follow the footsteps of someone she greatly admires. 
"[Sarah Janel has inspired me to be a great captain because all the other girls looked up to her," Connelly said. "She was the person in practice that would keep the spirits up. She is someone I look up to and want to be like." 
Connelly's acceptance of the captain role this season marks the first time a pair of sisters have held this title in tennis and only the fifth time in all other varsity sports. 
And with two wins already in tact, Connelly is hoping the team's unity will create great results this season. 
"We are really unified, and we get along so well on and ofT the court," she said. "We have been really close all year. The dynamics of the team [are) really great and will help us during this sna­son."

Weis said he always likes to relate sports to his family life, especially when he watches his son play baseball and when his whole family watch­es a game together.

stepped their offensive games, so I'm pleased at where we are right now with the offense." 
Notre Dame also has had success when it pushes the tempo of the game, and the team will look to dominate the tempo in tonight's game, McGraw said. 
"It's an important part of the game, and you really need to score in transition," she said. "That's about the only way we can score some nights, so I think it is important that we run up and push the ball." 
But the Irish may run into some problems trying to push the game's speed, as the Wildcats are known for having a very slow and deliberate offense. 
"A lot of teams run some version of [Villanova's slow­tempo offense]. I think that a lot of people run it, but they don't like to use the whole shot clock [like Villanova doesl." McGraw said. "The way they play, they don't have to worry about [stamina] in the game. So I don't think that's going to be an advan­tage." 
In part because of their offensive strategy, the Wildcats lead the nation in lowest turnover-per-game average -giving the ball away just 10.8 times per game. 
The Wildcats lead the nation in lowest turnovers-per-game 
average, but Villanova has struggled recently to score points -just as the Irish seem poised to end their scoring woes. 
"If you're not making [shots]. it doesn't really matter who you're playing," Villanova head coach Harry Perretta said. "You need to put the ball in the basket. Right now, I mean, that's a concern of mine because we seem to be gener­ating the same types of shots against all the teams in the league. It just seems like we're not making them. That's wor­risome." 
Though Notre Dame is only ninth in the Big East in rebounding, McGraw stressed the importance of limiting sec­ond-cl)ance opportunities on defense. 
"They're not a strong offen­sive rebounding team general­ly," McGraw said. "That's something they give up with four people on the perimeter. And we're not a strong team defensive rebounding." 
While the Irish have shown signs of life offensively in the past few games, Villanova's slow play could lead to fewer total points. 
"[But] wait until Tuesday," McGraw said after a 66-48 win over Providence Saturday. "It's going to be 15-14 at half­time."

win all three matches, all at the end, all on the road," Bayliss said. "If you're that good on the road, you're probably absolute­ly as good as they are on a neu­tral court, so we've just got to keep that in mind." 

The Irish have benefited from a revamped doubles lineup fea­turing juniors Ryan Keckley and Barry King together in the top spot. The two knocked off the nation's No. 1 doubles team of Riain Luichici and Brad Pomeroy at UNC and also post­ed a win at Duke. 
But Illinois -a perennial tennis power, particularly in doubles -also won the dou­bles point from the Blue Devils. The llllini account for Duke's only loss so far this season. 
Bayliss is confident in the team's ability against Illinois, despite recent struggles on the road. 
"I think the toughening process will take place now," he said. "I think we've got a bunch of Big 10 teams coming up next week -Illinois then Purdue, Wisconsin, Michigan State and Michigan. I think we'll benefit from the teams we've been playing. We've got to just build on it and turn our­selves into the team we know we can be." 
Illinois is 3-0 this season and has won five straight matches from the Irish, most recently a St. Patrick's Day showdown on March 17, 2005. The Irish fell 6-1 at the Eck Tennis Pavilion. 

"We have to be ready to play a strong Illinois team that prob­ably is ranked three now, and they probably deserve to be because they've beaten Duke and Virginia," Bayliss said. "We know we're right thAre, but I don't think anyone's anywhere near satisfied. 


Illinois has four of the top 100 doubles players, led by Ryler DeHeart at No. 7. Kevin Anderson is tied for 37, and Ruben Gonzales follows at No. 
59. Ryan Rowe entered the rankings at No. 99. DeHeart is only eight career wins away from the Illinois record held by Michael Calkins with a record of 116-30. 
The Atkins Tennis Center in Urbana is also a difficult place for visitors to win. The lllinis boast a 4 7-1 record at the courts, which dates back to March 30, 2002. 
But Bayliss and the team remain undaunted by the sta­tistical disadvantages. 
"We've been in two matches against Top 10 teams and been in a position to win them both," Bayliss said. "We've been play­ing at a pretty high level, we just have to be able to win one of these. There's light at the end of the tunnel." 
The Irish and Illini take the courts at 6 p.m. today.

Fighting off the Illini 
Irish face third top-1 0 squad on the road in less than two weeks 
By KATE GALES Associate Sports Editor 

Another day. another road match against a top-notch oppo­nent. 
After spending the weekend in North Carolina and dropping two 4-3 matches to No. 30 UNC and No. 9 Duke, Notre Dame is back on the road to face No. 3 Illinois. 
"I think it's a great challenge," coach Bobby Bayliss said. "That's what sports are all about. It's our job to be ready to play [today], and we will be." 
The Irish are 2-3, with wins over William & Mary and Northwestern. All three losses -including a loss to then-No. 1 Virginia -have been on the road, by the frustratingly close margin of 4-3. 
"You've been in a position to

Team looks for third straight Big East win 
Irish can improve to 6-5 in conference play with victory tonight 
By ERIC RETTER Sports Writer 

With a new page on the cal­endar and shots finally falling in the basket, the Irish are attacking the final stretch of the season. 
N o t r e Dame (14-7, 5-5 Big East) has won its last two games by double-digit 
margins and seems ready to put its January funk, when the team went 3-5, perma­nently in the past. 
The Irish look to continue their streak tonight against Villanova, who comes into the game a loser of its last two games and just 3-6 in the con­ference. 


One of the reasons for the Irish successes of the past week is a rejuvenated offense that finally seems ablP to get points from inside. Hesurgent senior forward Courtney LaVere, who scored 14 and 18 points in the two Notre Dame wins against Syracuse and Providence, respectively, including a 9-10 performance from the floor against the Friars, has led this attack. She was recently selected to the Big East Conference Weekly Honor Roll. 
"I think offensively we're making some strides. It's nice to have somebody lead the team in scoring besides Megan Duffy. She's kind of carried the load for most of the year," Notre Dame head coach Muffet McGraw said. "But in the last two games, we've got a lot more production from other people. Courtney LaVere was one. Lindsay Schrader and Charel Allen have all

Connelly embraces nevv role 
By DAN TAPETILLO Sports Writer 
Lauren Connelly is Notre Dame's captain for a reason, or so say her teammates ­and her results. 
The Irish senior lost just five games 
in three matches during N o t r e Dame's 7-0 victory over Ohio State and Xavier Saturday at 


Eck Tennis Connelly Pavilion. And the rest of Connelly's team followed her lead. 
"She's a leader on and off the court," junior Catrina Thompson said Monday. "She is always positive and one of

Alumni speak at banquet 
Heilman, Weis are keynote speakers at annual Irish event 
By KEN FOWLER 
Spons Writer 

Two Notre Dame graduates -one baseball professional, another baseball fanatic ­said that baseball means a lot, but only so much, at the fifth annual Opening Night Dinner Monday. 
It means a lot to four-time Irish All-American pitcher Aaron Heilman, the New York Mets' No. 1 pick -and No. 18 overall -in the 2001 amateur draft. 
But Heilman once rejected a million-dollar signing bonus with the Minnesota Twins after his junior season at Notre Dame, instead return­ing to the Irish for a senior season. Professional baseball could wait. Playing with his friends and developing rela­tionships at Notre Dame could not. 
"I had two choices,"
