BEIRUT, Lebanon The 

Lebanese army turned back two 
more attacks by Druse and Pales­
tinian militiamen on Souk ei-Gharb 
yesterday, and U.S. military obser­
vers came under fire in the strategic 
Christian town overlooking Beirut. 
There was no resumption of the 

heavy U.S. Navy shelling that on 
Monday hit Druse positions around 
the hilltop town where President 
Amin Gemayel's government and its 
army face their biggest test. 
Monday's Navy action marked the 

first time that U.S. forces had directly 
supported the Lebanese army in its 
battle for Beirut against Syrian­
backed Druse and Palestinian 
militiamen. 
The Reagan administration has -emphasized that it is determined to 
protect Souk el-Gharb and one key 
administration official said army 
control ofthe town was "vital."

U.S. planes flew frequent recon­naissance flights over the area yes­terday. Pentagon sources in Washington said Syrian troops may have fired an anti-aircraft missile at a Navy F-14, which was not hit. 
Despite the continuing fighting, an informed government source who refused to be identified by name said the Lebanese government was hopeful that Saudi Prince Ban­dar bin Sultan's mediation efforts would produce a cease-fire within the next 24 hours. 
But former Prime Minister Saeb Salam, who is involved in the meditation effort, said he doubted the negotiations would succeed soon because the Syrians "are playing for time." 
A lebanese army communique said "insurgents" tried to infiltrate Souk ei-Gharb before dawn but were driven back. 
A second infiltration attempt came in the afternoon, about an hour after a party ofsix or seven U.S. Army and Marine observers headed by an Army colonel arrived in the town. 
The Americans apparently were conferring with the local Lebanese command at their headquarters in the local hotel when the fighting broke out about a mile away. An hour-long battle followed in which hundreds of shells and rockets were exchanged, but there was no report that any Americans were wounded. 
Marine spokesman Major Robert Jordan of Shenandoah, Ga., said the team had been sent to collect in­formation on the situation at Souk ci­Gharb. Another Marine spokesman, Warrant Officer Charles Rowe ofSan Francisco, Calif., denied the obser­vers were sent to direct the fire of the Navy ships offshore.

Revised party proposal passed; HPC suggests party guidelines

Rectors have not been uniformly enforcing parietals rules, said Father John Van Wovlear, Vice President of Student Affairs in a recent letter to all rectors. 
In a letter, Van Wovlear said he had been informed by students that not all parietals violations are being referred to Dean ofStudents. 
According to Dean of Students James Roemer, the letter reminded rectors that all parietals violations are to be referred to the Dean ofStu­dents. Neither rectors nor hall judi­cial boards have the authority to deal with parietals violations, Roemer said. 
Once a violation is referred to the Dean of Students, Roemer said he has the authority to recommend ap­propriate constructive activity, monetary fines, transfer of residence, probation, suspension, or even dismissal from the University, depending upon the seriousness of the violation. 
"If the facts clearly show, in a fair way, that a person stayed overnight in the room of a student of the op­posite sex, that violation could result in the student being separated from the university," said Roemer. "In the nine years I have been here, I do not know of an overnight viola­tion that has not resulted in the stu­
dent  being  separated  from  the  
University."  
No  specific  penalties  are  

described in DuLac, the University's Guide to Student Life, concerning parietals violations. "It would be ter­ribly difficult and unfair," said next year. Roemer. "We have to consider each case individually."

Carlin felt that the proposal was useful only to the extent that it is en­forced. "The presidents sh9uld realize their roles to their dorms." 
The allocation of H.P.C. funds to each dorm for this year was also presented. The Sl8,100 was divided among the dorms for use in hall im­provement, with an average alloca­tion of S750. St. Edward's, Morrissey, and Howard Halls received the highest allocations of

This Monday, activities calendar books were distibuted to the stu­dents by the Hall Presidents' Coun­
cil. The books were put together by the Notre Dame Student Union. 
The book contains the academic calendar for both semesters and in­cludes lists of organizations, hall Masses, SU commissions, and other valuable information the average Domer needs. 
In past years the Student Union has published a smaller calendar book that was not popular among the student body. 
The idea came from Villanova Uni­versity, which publishes an activites calendar along with the rules of the University, similar to the purpose of 
Dulac. 
SU Public Relations Manager Mary Easterday was in charge of the production, and said the calendar book should be well received at Notre Dame, because it will inform

The Reagan administration used illegal coercion last year when it tried to persuade four million aged, blind and disabled welfare recipients to disclose how much they are worth, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in Washingon yesterday. The court, in an opinion byJudge Ahner Mikva, said a form mailed to the four million recipients of SSI seeking access to the information "makes a mockery of the consent requirement." "The form itself contained poorly veiled threats that the recipients' benefits would he terminated if they failed to sign the forms," Mikva wrote. An es­timated three million SSI recipients signed the forms. The court or· dered the IRS not to turn the tax returns over to the Social Security Administration. -AP

A nuclear freeze resolution and a substitute 
proposal for a "build-down" in nuclear weapons were sent to the Senate yesterday by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with a suggestion that both proposals be defeated. The freeze resolution, originally sponsored by Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Mark llatlield, R-Ore., calls for the United States and the Soviet Union to negotiate a mutual and verifiable freeze of nuclear weaponry at present levels. It was defeated by a I0·., vote, with Democrat Ed· ward Zorin~ky of Nebraska, joining the solid Republican majority.

Attracting attention unattractively 
Some people get all the breaks. 
Take Christine Craft, for example. Just three years ago, Miss Craft was just another news anchor at just an· other television station in just another city -Kansas City, Mo., to he exact. The station's new~ ratings were not spectacular. In fact, the news director felt that the show was not attracting a large enough audience. 
So Miss Craft was demoted to the position ofoil"-the· air reporter. According to her, she was told hy the sta· 
tion·~  news  director  that  she  was  "too  old,  too  
unattractive"  and  would  not  "defer  to  men."  She  
resigned rather than accept the demotion.  

Ofcourse, it doesn't sound like Craft got any breaks. But you've only read part of the story. 
Miss Craft took her case to court. She sued KMBC-TV and Metromedia Inc. (which has since sold the station) on charges of fraud and sex discrimination. The case took two years, hut a federal court jury in Kansas City finally awarded her s.n'i,OOO in actual and 
5125,000 in punitive damages. Metromedia is appealing the decision. 
As if that isn't enough of a hreak, Craft is now also enjoying the many benefits of instant fame and popularity. In recent weeks she has appeared on ABC's "Nighline," NBC's "Late Night with David Letter· man" and the syndicated "Donahue." 
Craft's popularity has also taken her to the speaking tour. She'll he giving 30 talks in the next 12 months, including stops at Marquette University and the Young Presidents Association. She'll be making $4,250 per 

lecture. She has even quit her job as anchor at KEYT-TV in Santa Barbara, Ca., to devote more time to her new· found celebrity status. 
Not had for someone who was demoted because of poor ratings. 
Craft won her suit based on two points: I ) fraud; and 
2) sex discrimination. Craft was able to convince the jury that KMBC hired her for her jourmilistic creden­tials, and therefore, could not validly demote her for any other reasons. If Craft thought her joh was to be a journalist -and she thinks she performed this job well -she could not he demoted for being "unattractive." 
This point is well-taken. An employee must know his/her joh, and the grounds on which he/she can lose that job. An employee must he aware of the standards which must he met. Ofcourse, if an employee's perfor­mance falls below the established standard, he/she· could he demoted. Miss Craft claims that she was never told that her job security dep~nded upon her good

looks. Her demotion for not being attractive seems un· 
fair. 
However, Craft and the jury are off base when they 
raise the sex discrimination issue. Craft was not 
demoted because she was an unattractive woman, she 
was demoted because she was an unattractive anchor· 
person. 
There are three important qualities which a televi· sion anchor must posses: journalistic ability, intelligence, and physical attractiveness. 
The last quality is not essen· tial for a newspaper writer, or a radio announcer. But it is a must for a television per· sonality. Any attempt to deny the importance of this quality Is ridiculous. 
1 Craft states, however, that "Getting the story and get· ting it straight, that's· first. Looking good should be down the list." Probably no one in the business would argue this point. However, looking good should not be so far the list that it is dis· regarded. Physical at· tractiveness adds to the image of credibility that a news anchor must display. 
Television is a visual medium, and in order to be suc­cessful, the product must be attractive. just as most female anchors are considered good-looking, so are most male anchors. There is not a double-standard in this area. 
There are, however, many inequities in the business of television news. Women anchors have been arguing for quite some time that they are underpaid with respect to their male collegues. Only a few women anchors ever hit the big time, but even fewer hit the big bucks. Many analysts claim that such a situation exists in many occupations, and that television news is not dif· ferent. 
But Craft's suit had nothing to do with equal pay for equal work. And she has not traveled around the country to proclaim "the plight offemale anchors." In· stead, she is raking in the bucks by telling everyone how she stood up against the industry. 
Some people get all the breaks.

Police search for clues to help investigation of editor's death 
Associated Press 
FORT WAYNE, Ind. -Police sought clues yesterday in the slayings of a Fort Wayne newspaper editor, his wife and son, while a 2­year-old girl -the only survivor of the "brutal, sadistic slaughter"­recuperated in a hospital. 
Police spokesman Thomas R. Engle said investigators have no known suspects or substantial leads in the deaths of Dan Osborne, 35, editorial page editor of the Fort Wayne News-Sentinel; his wife, Jane, and their 11-year-old son, Ben. 
Fort Wayne Deputy Police Chief David Racine issued an urgent plea at a news conference yesterday, ask­ing the public to come forward with any information that might help au­thorities in their investigation. 
Osborne and his son apparently were bludgeoned in their sleep Friday night with a blunt instrument, Allen County Coroner Roland Ahlbrand said following autopsies yesterday. Mrs. Osborne was killed by blows to the head with a flatter object, which Ahlbrand said could have been a hand. 
Ahlbrand said he believed Mrs. Osborne was raped, but he could not confirm it medically. 
Osborne's daughter, Caroline, 2, was, found in her room .playing with toys about 10 a.m. Monday after spending more than 48 hours with her dead parents and brother. 
Caroline underwent surgery at a Fort Wayae hospital for injuries sus­tained when she was sexually as­saulted, said a police source who asked not to be identified. 
"She is reading books with nurses and playing with toys and carrying on like any 2-year-old," he said. 
Mrs. Osborne's parents, Mr. and Mrs. John Dewell of Tulsa, Okla., flew to Fort Wayne Monday night to talk to police and take custody of 
Caroline. 
Ahlbrand, who Monday night described the slayings as a "brutal, sadistic slaughter," said the three victims appeared to have died from severe head injuries from a blunt in­strument such as a bat. 
Police later said they recovered "a bloody baseball bat," believed to be a m~rder weapon, from the girl's bedroom. They also were examining a portable radio, believed to belong to Ben Osborne, that was found next . to his mother, covered with blood and hair. 
Engle said investigators were in the midst of collecting evidence, making background checks, telephone contacts and looking into the victims' activities since they came to Fort Wayne in April from Kansas City, where Osborne was as­
sistant business editor of the Kansas City Star. 
Notre Dame invites 'four often' 
1 
top anthropologists in the world 
ByJOHN MENNELL 
News Staff 
Within the next two months, Notre Dame will be the host to what Notre Dame Anthropology Chair­man Kenneth Moore considers, "four of the top ten anthropologists in the world." 
Moore said these four anthropologists have had, "tremendous impact on their field," and that they, "have more readers in the general public than in anthropol­ogy." 
"For an undergraduate student who does not totally understand the subject matter, it would still be an enriching experience to see one of these' world renowned scholars," said Moore.

Students will have an opportunity to dance on the Saint Mary's College campus this Saturday, Sept. 24 from 9 pm to 2 am. The "Five Dorms Dance" will be the first major stu­dent social event to be held in the new Haggar College Center. 
"The goal of the present student government is to get more unity be· tween the halls, " said Ellen Byrne, chairman of the dance committee. "We hope that the dance will help to increase campus unity as well as celebrate the opening of Haggar Center." 
Notre Dame students who present their identification cards will be admitted to the dance free of charge. "We're doing this in the hope that Notre Dame students will come over and familiarize them­selves with the Haggar Center be­cause it really is a beautiful place," Byrne said. · 
Tickets for Saint Mary's students will be available at the door. A coupon for a free drink will be in­cluded in the fl admission price. Because no alcohol is allowed in the Haggar Center, that drink will be a non-alcoholic strawberry daquiri or frozen margarita. Also discount snack bar coupons will be handed 1 out at all the doors. 
The disc jockey for the "Five Dorms Dance" will be Pangborn resident Buster Lopes. He is slated to play a variety ofdancing music.

Are you planning to go to law school? 
As a governmt·nt major, I face this question 1.:ontinuou~ly. and ;llways give the same respon~e: "No." It b a phrase as 1.:ommon as the oft-rept·ated student groan, "I have so mu(.'h work to do." 
Michael L. Brennan 
And so it goes 
At times I feel as though my entire peer group is marching inexorably in the direction of law school, lured hy three more years of student life, a versatile degree that is highly re.~pccted in our society, ;md hy a job market that has held up remarkably well despite recent sharp increases in lawyer production (last year, 9S'l. of those who passed the Bar exam landed jobs in law-related fields). Money, as always, also contributes to law school's popularity. Starting salaries for recent graduates range from $11,000 to S43,500, with the average earnings for attorneys start­ing in private industry being $21,000. 
In the United States, there are roughly 42S,OOO lawyers, and another 127,828 en­rolled lawyers-to-he. Here at Notre Dame, 199 students from the class of '83 wt;re accepted to law schools across the country, represent­ing 13/. of last year's graduating class. Law school has obviously become one of the most popular places for America's best and brightest students to congregate. Do we need any more lawyers? Or do we simply need more good lawyers? 
When friends tell me oftheir tentative plans to attend law school, I ask them why. Their responses vary, hut revolve around three main themes: it is "safe" (i.e. one can avoid the evils ofthe real world for three more years), it provides sound mental discipline and thought-process training regardless of the profession they eventually choose, and third­ly, the often heard response, "What else is there to do?" Rarely do people actually want to go to law school, and less frequently do they want to correct a flawed legal system, or fight injustice on a local, national or global scale. 
If future lawyers do not thirst for justice, who will? Do they care that Congress has voted to spend S 11 5 million on the produc­tion of nerve gas while 50/. of Nigerian children die of malnutrition before the age of five? We arc surrounded by injustices, includ­ing the not-so-subtle sexism on campus. Does the Pre-taw Society care? 
Many of those who plan to attend law school do care, they care a lot -they are cut­out for law careers because it is something that springs from their hearts. Many others ap­pear to respond only to the expectations of society, oftheir parents, oftheir peers. Parents 
all too often expect to see dividends from the $40,000 investment called Notre Dame. If a student attends law school only to avoid let­ting his parents down, is he letting himself down? 
We need good lawyers. But we could also use some better politicians, teachers, and definitely some better television screen writeI rs. Are the studies ofpoetry, philosophy, music, art, or history too impractical for our increasingly computerized and pragmatic society? Has our society killed the Renais­sance man? 
Before taking the U>AT's, ask yourself (honestly) if you want to be a lawyer. Con­sider the options of a temporary job, volun­teer work, travel, graduate school, or study abroad. If you come up with anything good, let me know -I need something to do with my life ... 

Will the lunch lines ever go away? 
The one place virtually every student must visit cad1 day is the dining hall. Unfortunately, it is also one of the higge.~t .~ources offrustra­tion on campus. 
Mike Wilkins 

Here, there, and back 
The lines in tht· dining halls ;1re, once again, unhearahly long. The lunch line~ arc especial­ly h;1d, hut thi' year the dinner lines and sofTletime~ even the hreakJ:1st line~ arc much longer than tht·y ·'hould he. The long lines of· ten cause ~tudenb to ru~h through a meal to avoid hcing latt· to class, a ~ure source of frustration and indigestion. 
This has ht·cn a frequent problem in the past hut this year it seems worse than ever. Tht· lines have dit'd down some ~ince the ht·ginning of tht.· year, a~ they do every year 
when students hecorne adjusted to their new schedules. Hut they are still troublesome, especially at noon. 
Students and the administration have looked for answers to this problem before, but no one has ever come up with a workable solution. Each year the problem is tolerated, though not ·without complaint, and students continue to rush through meals. Perhaps now, since the problem has become so had, a solu­tion should he found to put an end to long lines for good. 
The lines are worst during lunch on Tues­days and Thursdays, especially between the end ofthe I 1:00 class and the beginning ofthe 1·1 c; class. Almost everyone has a class scheduled during one of these periods, and many have classes at hoth times. An incredibly large number of people, therefore, are eating lunch between I2: IS and I:00 on Tuesday and Thursday. 
An obvious answer to this problem would be to schedule classes during the noon hour on Tuesday and Thursday as is already done on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. While this might require some schedule adjusting, the effort would he worthwhile. With more students in class during the times when the lines are currently the worst, fewer people would be eating lunch at any particular time. Long lines in the dining hall would become a thing of the past. 
Another answer to this problem would be to have all the lines open throughout lunchtime. In the North Dining Hall, where lines are the worst, having certain lines closed until around noon causes a hack-up of stu· dents before the rush of people comes from 
I I :00 classes. This has also been a problem in the morning, since some lines are closed during breakfast, causing long backlogs in the lines that remain open. 
As a long-term answer, the Administration should find within its heart and its budget, plans for a new dining hall. The area between the Pasquerillas and the library would he a perfect place to locate a new dining hall. This would be an ideal location for students living in the Pasquerillas, Flanner, Grace, and even Farley and Hreen-Phillips. The building would . also serve students corning from the library or 
any of the other buildings in that area. 
There may he problems, financial and 
otherwise, with the solutions to the problem 
oflon·g lines in the dining halls. But an answer 
to this prohlem must be found as soon as pos­
sible. Long lines have been a problem for too 
long and are causing too many problems for 
both students and dining hall workers. The 
solution to this prohlern may not be an easy 
one, but it is a solution which must he found 
to end one of the most frustrating problems 
students face each day.

Improper response to attack 
JJear Editor: 

Just a brief reaction to Mike McClory's 
column of September IS concerning the 
Korean Air l.incs massacre. In his section on 
what our rt·sponse to this attack should he, he 
hasically ridiculed tht· Reagan administra­
tion's po~ition. Referring to the U.S. demand 
th;u the Soviets compensate the victims' 
t:1milie~ for their lossc~. McClory states that 
asking li>r money is "~imply to set an accept­
able price on the downing ofplam:s." llow ah· 
surd. Tht· li.S. sec~ this crash a~ one where 
someone ( tht· Sovit't IInion) is at fault, and 
that somt·ont· should ht· sued li>r damagcs (as 
commonly happt·ns when a plane crashes 
l'lst·whert· dut· to CIU,t'S othn than missile at· 
tack. ) In .,hort, the I·....,. docs not stt· the 
downing of Flight oo-as worth a certain 
amount of money; rather it kds that the 
families left fatherless should he compensated 
in ~orne way li>r their rcspcctivt· losses. In this 
way, the survivors can at lea~t cx;tct some pleasure in seeing the Soviets implicitly admit their mistake. 
Moreover, instead of making demands similar to those of the Reagan administration, McClory would act diJlerently: simply hope that this massacre doesn't happt.·n again. llow useless. Hope, hy itself is not enough to coun­ter the ever-existent Soviet threat. Some form of action in protest, however minimal, is necessary to show our absolute disgust at this terrorist act. Perhaps such action would prevent this form of harharisrn from recur­ring. McClory's "proper response" to this act, being in fact a nonresponse, is simply insuffi­cient.

Passionate Heart 
Miss Manners 
Courtship in reverse 
by Judith Martin 
H
ow does one conduct a courtship backward? What are the steps for proceeding from the greatest intimacy to opening an ac­quaintanceship that one hopes will lead to friendship and then romance? 
1t took Miss Manners a long time to understand the question. When people first started asking her what to do after they spent the night together, she thought they had confused her area ofexpertise and were consulting her about what makes a nutritious breakfast. 
Sometimes it would be spelled out to her that the social event was what is known as a one-night stand and that the question was what was required afterward. Most ofthose who made the inquiry were feeling aggrieved because nothing happpened afterward. Then she would have to spell out what the name meant and explain that no, dear, she could not chastise a participant for not calling and sending flowers the next day, because those gestures had to do with another, unrelated social form called courtship. 
The surprise was that the two forms are sometimes related, at least sequentially. Some people apparently do call the next day, voluntari­ly, but are then stymied as to how to proceed from there to begin the courtship. 
My, my, isn't modern life full ofsurprises? Now that Miss Manners understands the question, she is perfectly willing to address it. 
The answer is that there are stages ofcourtship that cannot be skipped ifany sort of romance is to ensue. Getting to know some­thing about another person's background, opinions, and tastes is es­sential in addition to memorizing the features so as to be able to recognize the face by daylight. 
Drawingout the thrill and uncertainty ofdiscovering that a person you find attractive also finds you attractive has generally been con­sidered one of the most rewarding aspects ofcourtship, and that, of course, is lost ifthere is no intermediate step between the exchange ofglances between strangers and the exchange ofeverything else, except possibly surnames, between strangers. It does seem to Miss Manners a shame to remove the suspense from the drama oflife. 
But be that as it may, it does not serve as an excuse for removing the civilities as well. In courtship, these consist of: 
I. Establishing what seems like disinterested interest in the other person. That is, one shows a lively attention to discovering the other's attributes hut with no sense that one is going to appropriate them. You would be, for example, fascinated hy the other person's field ofendeavor, hut not the least curious about how much dis­posable income thi~ might provide to anyone who teamed up with that person. 
2. 
Indicating an interest that you seem to be fighting, because your life is in good order and, rather than hoping to improve it trough an alliance, you are afraid that an alliance might disrupt it. 

3. 
Allowing yourselfto be won over, in spite ofyourself, because ofthe other person's superiority. 


There will be those who disdain this sequence as being baroque, which indeed it is, and demand to know why they cannot simply state their needs at the beginning and skip these preliminaries. 
Well you tried that, didn'tyou? The fact is that no one is pleased to find that he or she has simply filled a minimal, uncomplicated need. We want to have all those individual interior complications ex­amined, admired and adored, along with our outsides. 
So one must, however incongruously, refrain from using the ul­timate intimacy as an excuse for assuming other intimacies, which have not been duly earned. By being pleasantly aloofin other respects, one encourages others to pursue emotional intimacy through the time-honored steps ofcourtship. 
Anybody who remembers when movies were routinely shown 
con tinuously, and it was necessary to be able to see a finale and then dismiss it from one's mind and start at the beginning as iffresh, will understand what Miss Manners means. 
Dear Miss Manners -Have you ever heard ofa bride-to-be being reproved for writing thank you notes too soon? 
My daughter had a shower on a Saturday evening and wrote and mailed the thank yous the very next day. Some ofthe guests received their notes on Monday. Her fiance gently chided her for being so prompt. Having never seen such a question raised before and not being able to find an answer, I hope you can come to our rescue. She has written each thank you on the day a gift was received, but is now holding the notes for fear of being chided again. 
Gentle Reader -Is it too late to put a stop to this wedding? That child ofyours is a treasure and Miss Manners does not want her marrying someone who does not appreciate her. 
Ifonly he realized how lucky he is. Her promptness is not only a sign ofefficiency that could fill the rest ofhis life with ease and pleasure, but her politeness -and what is it but the most flattering politeness to appear enraptured with a present that you cannot stop yourselffrom showing immediate gratitude?-is a rare graciousness that will he the crowning touch to a well-organized household. 
The immediate benefit to him, if he but knew it, is that he will never encounter his own mother in a state ofanger or despair, pas­sing on the complaints offriends that Charlotte hasn't thanked anybody, along with the request that he "make her" do so. 
The long-range benefits are beyond description. 
Now that Miss Manners has given vent to her astonishment, she feels obliged to admit that yes, she did hear once before ofa similar case, in which the bride had been advised that it was "wrong" to write thank you letters for wedding presents until after the wedding. As Miss Manners suspected, this outrageous misinformation was traceable to a source who invented it from wishful thinking because she had planned to write these letters on paper marked with her married name, and knew she couldn't use that before the wedding.

A 
lot more people are going to hearPassionworks, Heart's new album, than their last album, Private Auditions. Auditions was a good album, but the first single released, "This Man is Mine" was one ofthe weakest songs they ever put out and gave fans a wrong impression ofwhat the rest ofthe album was like. 
Fortunately things won't repeat themselves this time around.Passionworks is more laid back than Heart's earlier LPs. Screaming guitars and poundingdrums have given way to a more mellowed and bluesy sound, but with a greater emotional intensity. Ann Wilson's voice is more seductive than angry, adding to the mellowed sound. 
"How Can I Refuse," the LP's first single, definitely won't alienate fans. Heart has always had strong drum­ming and Denny Carmassi doesn't disappoint here. The rest ofthe song, though, is pretty routine, including the bass opening, which sounds like Foreigner's "Hot Blooded." Speaking ofForeigner, remember "Juke Box Hero" from a few years ago? Well, we see a womanized reincarnation ofthat song in "Blue Guitar." "Guitar" is about a female rocker who finds the guitar and "makes herselfa local scene" with it. Again, nothing spectacular, except that the band resists the temptation to turn the song into a heavy metal overture. 
Heavy metal is one phrase that often has been used to describe the hand in its eight year existence. Founded by sisters Ann and Nancy Wilson in Seattle, the band's debut albumDreamboatAnnie took them to the top of the rock world. All did not go so smoothly afterward, though; the band experienced numerous personnel changes and problems with its record company in the following years. The latest personnel change came last year after the release ofPrivate Auditions. Drummer Michael Derosier and bassist Steve Fossen left the band and were replaced by current drummer Carmassi and bassist Mark Andes. Heart's album have always reflected the events in their personal lives and this one is no exception. Listen to "Johnny Moon" and you'll see how much the Wilson sister's attitudes about things have changed. There is a feeling ofcontent and satisfac­tion that runs through the entire album. "Johnny Moon" is another encounter with the magic man and, !ike the first time, his charms are too hard to resist. This passive attitude toward men is a far cryfrom the fury ofBebeLe 
Strange which was recorded after another difficult time 
for the hand three years ago. Compare "Break" from Bebe to "Johnny Moon." 
The dust is gathering where I stand Now I know there's a crack in thisplan Aftera while therejust ain't no more magic, man My patience ran out I gottarun out ofa habit that used to befun. 

Now, "Johnny Moon." 
johnnyI wannafollow you outside I wannafeel that high johnny, you I can pretend with You're the only oneI can really bend with Take me across the river Styx Fill my eyes withfire tricks Anythingyou got upyour sleeve Anythingyou tell me,]ohnny, I'll believe. 

There are a few real rockers and "Sleep Alone" is one ofthe album's best, with some wicked guitar licks and upbeat drumming. "Allies," a rock-n-roll version of the you-and-me-against-the-world theme, is one ofthe album's real gems. Written byJourney memberJonat­han Cain, the song features nice piano and synthesizer work by David Paich which gives the song aJourney­like sound. Definitely a potential hit for the band.

An epic ofthe old South 
by Prof. Frederick Wright 
I
n fashioning his 1971 novel, Author Ernest Gaines gave the reader a great, albeit fictional black woman whose 110 years spanned the period ofsocial and political revolution begun by the emancipa­tion proclamation and continued through the civil rights struggles of the current century. The world which Gaines created for MissJane Pittman is frequently not the place a Harriet Tubman or a Mary McCloud Bethume would have inhabited. Pit­tman's environs were too far off the beaten path for the likes ofa Booker T. Washington or a Frederick Douglas; hence, the author's preference for fiction. Jane's uni­verse was small (she never left Louisiana), it was dreary (she worked for whites as a domestic all ofher life), and it was dangerous. Yet, because we have so Iitle in­formation about those black mil­lions who did live through Redemption, vigilante rule, and agrarian peonage, MissJane Pit­tman's story became not only in­structive but also fascinating and exciting. 
Often the process oftransferring a novel to the screen results in failure. Happily however this 1974 made­for-television movie actually seems to improve the original product. The script, written by Tracy Keenan Wynn, and the great acting ofCicely Tyson combined to hand television and the viewing public one ofits finest evenengs. This week the 
N utre Dame community gets an op­portunity to view this fine film. 
It's been more than a century since the end ofReconstruction, and since that time most ofus have come to accept and live with certain generalizations about the American South and the role ofrace in shaping that region. So finely crafted is Gaines' book and so respectful ofthe original text is this film, that these generalizations about the civil war and race are challenged. 
Unlike several generations of American Historians, Jane Pittman seems never in doubt about the causesofthewar. In herworld there was only one reason to fight, and a Union victory could mean only one thing, freedom. Although she was born a slave, and as an eleven year old freed-woman lived through the heydays ofthe Ku Klux Klan and other self-styled racist law and order organizations, Jane realized that all whites weren't evil. Still, Jane Pit­tman and others, both black and white, were constantly at the mercy ofevil men. 
The skillful youths ofthe movie's characters allow us to witness an in­adequate attempt at Reconstruction, a retreat from the promises ofthe 14th and 15th amendments, the ad­vent ofracial segregation, and the . ways in which cotton and its dominance subdued blacks in much ofthe South. 
While violence and its threatened use held most people in check for decades, in the end it was really the willingness of regular and ordinary folks to defY local custom and risk life and property in demanding equal rights which usht!red in the civil rights movement ofthe 1950's and 1960's. Like Rosa Parkds, Miss Jane Pittman simply arrived at the morning when she could no longer be frightened. And in her bravery the community within which she lived was also able to join the 2th century and the effort aimed at realization ofemancipation. 
Frederick Wright is an assistant professor ofgovernment at Notre Dame. 
The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman will be shown tonight at 7 p.m. at the Center for Social con­cerns. There will be a discus­sion afterwards, led by Pro­fessor Kathleen Weigert and Piper Griffin.

john Paxson, seen here in his senior campaign picked him in lastjune's NBA draft. See Frank La at Notre Dame, is In the midst of a contract Grotta's story below for more details on Paxon's dispute with the San Antonio ,\purs, the team that situation. 
Paxson continues to work out while contract talks stalemate 
By FRANK LA GROITA 
Sports Writer 
Editor's note: Frank La (;rolla is a former Ohserver sports writer. He was xraduatedfrom Notre Dame in 1980 and xained his postxraduate dexree In 1981. 
DAYTON, Ohio -The game has 
always heen so easy. 
Get the hall, shoot, and score. Or 
go to the hoop, and score. Or get 
fouled, and score. It's always seemed 
like John Paxson could do anything 
with the hasketball. 
Until now. 

All ofa sudden the game that once 
flowed so smoothly from baseline to 
baseline is stuck between the offices 
of Larry Fleischer, Paxson's agent, 
and Angelo Drossos, the owner of 
the San Antonio Spurs, the National 
8askethall Association team that 
made Paxson its first-round draft 
pick last June. 
Drossos is offerihg Paxson a con· 
tract the player calls 
"unacceptahle." Paxson is asking for 
a contract the owner calls 
"unacceptable." 
So, with his future on hold, Paxson 
remains at home In Kettering, Ohio. 
His routine hasn't changed much 
from his days at nearby Alter High 
School, or at Notre Dame. 
"My whole day is geared around working out," he said over dinner at a restaurant in Kettering last week. "I get up in the morning, I go to work out at a place that has a Nautilis, play basketball in the afternoon with the guys at lJD (the University of Dayton, where his father and older hrother, Jim, hoth had all-American careers) and I run at night." 
He Is visihly trimmer than he was a year ago, his last season at Notre Dame. 
"I just watch what I eat-I cut out the breads and sweets -and I dropped from about 190 to 180," he says. 
He runs -4, sometimes 5 miles each night -along the uphill, downhill streets in his neighbor­hood. 
"The hills don't bother me," he says with a laugh. "When you up one, you get to go down one." 
He likes to run hy himself, he al· ways did, without one of those fas­hionalbc Walkman radios with the styrofoam headsets that joggers like to jam in their ears. 
"I like to concentrate when I run, 
"he says. "I think.It's a good time to think." 
A lot of his thinking is about bas­
ketball, which he loves, and about 
the Spurs and Drossos, who he 
doesn't understand. Drossos is a man 
with a reputation for frugality when 
it comes to players' salaries; a man 
Paxson has never met. 
Sometimes he worries about his 
future and how frustrating it is that 
things aren't working out the way he 
always thought they would when he 
was just a kid on a court in a 
playground in Kettering, and the 
pros were just a dream to sheot for 
like the iron rims on the backboards. 
He's engaged now, to a girl he's known since high school. They're getting married next summer, and as funny as it may seem to people who think all pro athletes are indepen­dently wealthy, the hard fact is right nowJohn Paxson doesn't have a job. 
"I told her she doesn't get to keep it unless I sign," he jokes as his fian­cee, Carolyn Ziehler, displays her engagement ring. 
Perhaps the hardest thing for Pax­son to accept is that he simply has no 
Victory leads 3-1 
control over the situation. It's a strange feeling in his athletic world, where hard work and extra practice always could solve anything. 
"It's in my agent's hands now," Paxson says. "I don't even call him that much -maybe once every two weeks. I trust him (Fleischer also represents Paxson's brother who plays for the Portland Trailblazers). He'll call me if something comes up." 
Ifnothing comes up by September 29, the day the Spurs open training . camp (and Paxson's 23rd birthday) 
he says he won't report. 
"I have to do it," he says about staying away. "I won't like it but I'll have to do it. I just can't go for what they want to pay me." 
Although the financial details are kept quiet, Paxson's demands are by no means out of line in light of pro basketball's present salary scale. 
"I'm hoping, you know, that some­thing happens before training camp opens," he says. "I just want to play basketball. I just want all this to end. I can't imagine ever getting tired of playing basketball. 

US could clinch Cup 
NEWPORT, R.I. (AP) -Skipper Dennis Conner of defender Liberty outsailed Australia II in the challen­ger's light winds yesterday to put the United States within a single victory of retaining the America's Cup. 
It was a striking turnahout for the Americans, whose hold on sailing's most prized trophy had seemed in doubt Sunday after suffering the worst defeat by a U.S. boat since 1871. 
But Liherty obviously made some adjustments during Monday's lay day to overcome Australia II's pre­vious superiority in winds similar to yesterday's I0-I 5 knot breezes on Rhode Island Sound. 
The 43-second victory, which took just 3 hours, 29 minutes and I7 seconds, gave Liberty a 3-I lead in the best-of-seven series. The next race is scheduled for today. 
Conner, who trailed Aussie skip­per John Bertrand after the first windward leg in each of the first three races, led there this time and held a safe, steady lead the rest ofthe way. 
The final margin, the closest so far in this series, was just five seconds less than Liberty's biggest lead ofthe day and just eight seconds more than the smallest lead. 
After jumping to a 6-second lead at the start, Conner could not be coaxed into a tacking duel with the quick-turning Aussies. 
He built a 36-second lead in the first 4.5-mile weather leg, stretched it to 48 seconds in the first of two 3.I-mile crosswind reaches and held that margin through the second. 
The Aussies managed to gain just 
 two seconds in the next weather leg. They picked up another II in the 4.5-mile downwind run and began the final leg 35 seconds behind. 
Again, Conner could not be drawn into a close ticking duel where the Aussies' celebrated winged keel had let Bertrand pick up as much as a boat's length per turn in the first three races. He moved in a protective pattern aimed at blocking winds to the tailing boat.

Hurricanes plan 
to blow Irish away 
~~rt~;~,:,reeby ~-. 
~iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiliiriiisiih-'tiiieiiimiiisiiiiiiiiiiiil..ti·. ~1~~ 
Hello again, everybody! While Irish fans have quickly stifled their talk of an undefeated season, last Saturday's loss to Michigan State is not as catastrophic as some people would make it appear. The Irish can still maintain hopes ofa major bowl bid, and possibly a national championship, but it can only come one step at a time. 
Last Two Years: Thrills and Spills ...Last year's Miami game featured all the dramatics associated with Notre Dame football. After an interception of a Blair Kiel pass with 2:58 remaining on the stadium clock and Miami owning a one-point lead, one Hurricane player remarked to Irish guard Tom Thayer that the game was over. Thayer replied This is Notre Dame. It's never over! 
Sure enough, the Irish defense forced a punt, and the offense took over on their own 30-yard-line with I :3 '7 left. An inspired student body lent support, as Kiel calmly drove the Irish into a field goal range. With II seconds remaining Mike Johnston came onto the field, and booted home a 32-yard field goal to give theIr t ish a 16-14 win. 
On the other hand, Faust and Notre Dame fans had their Thanksgiving weekend ruined two years ago by the Hurricanes in a nationally-televised 3 7-1 5 upset. In that one, the Irish looked like leftover Thanksgiving turkey, as Miami quarterbackJim Kelly carved up the Irish defense with two touchdown passes. No doubt about it, Faust and Co. would like to settle the score by knocking the stuffing out ofthe Hurricanes this weekend. 
Schellenberger Shines ...Fifth-year Hurricane coach Howard Schellenberger has done a tremendous joh, placing the Miami program into national prominence during his brief tenure. Miami has a 32-16 record under Schellenberger, and an amazing 20-2 ledger at the Orange Bowl in the last four years. Prior to Schellenber­ger's arrival, the Hurricanes had used a revolving door for coaches, changing the head man six times in eight years. Now, it seems Schel­lenberger has a tlrm grip on his job, and he has established some much-needed continuity within the program. 
Hurricane Heroes ...While Schellenberger has lost the aforementioned Jim Kelly to the NFI., Miami has plenty of talent on both sides of the line. On offense, freshman quarterback Bernie Kosar has led Miami to a 2-I start this fall. Kosar possesses a rifle arm, as he displayed with three TO passes against Purdue last Saturday. Sophomore flanker Stanley Shakespeare (no relation to the Bard of Avon) caught two ofthose scoring aerials, and is a threat to go deep. IfShakespeare is covered, Kosar will look for senior tight end Glenn Dennison, a big man with good speed. As in past years, the Hur­ricanes will put the ball in the air often, and that could spell trouble for the Irish. 
Six starters return on defense, including Sporting News pre­season All-Americans Jay Brophy and Ken Calhoun. Brophy mans op.e ofthe linebackerspots in the 5-2 defense, and led the Hurricanes with I32 tackles in I982. Calhoun stars in the rover position, where he came up with 59 stops last season. 
ForYour Fighting Irish ...Thre is no reason to expect the Irish to change their offensive game plan. Greg Bell and Allen Pinkett ran for IOO yards each last week, so the running game is in high gear. Look for the Irish to run at the right side ofthe Miami defense, where the Hurricanes are weakest. The Irish offense simply needs a better game out ofBlair Kiel than they got last week, and Kiel will probably ddiver on that request. 
While the Irish defense remains strong against the run, the defensive line needs to apply more ofa pass rush to give the folks in the secondary a fighting chance. Last week, Spartan quarterback Dave Yarema had enough time to visit the concession stand before throwing. The Irish need to remedy this situation, or it may be a long evening in Miami on Saturday night. 
Grab Bag .. .Irish assistant coach Carl Selmer returns to the Orange Bowl with revenge on his mind. He was the coach at Miami from I975 to 1976....CBS will televise the game in prime-time Saturday night. Miami promoters are billing this game as a Classic College Football Weekend, and have made extravagnt plans since the network chose to televise the game last spring ... Mike Shiner will t return to the starting quick tackle spot this week. His twisted knee injury has apparently healed ...This is the first of four con­secutive road games for the Irish who will not return to Notre Dame Stadium until October 22. 
Congratulations! ...Two Irish athletes entered their names into the record books last week. In field hockey, senior wing Clare Henry scored her 40th career goal to go atop the all-time Notre Dame scoring list. She surpasses Kathy Ray, who established the mark just last year. 
In women's tennis, senior Pam Fischette notched her 66th singles victory Saturday, defeating Cathy Walsh of DePauw, 6-I, 6-I to set the record for most singles victories by an Irish player. The previous record was 65 held by Carol Shukis since I98I. Setting records has become commonplace for Fischette. She now owns seven Notre Dame women's tennis records. 
Pick ofthe Week ...This week's pick is an easy one, indeed. It's not often that you see the Irish play a number-one ranked team, hut that will be the case Sunday afternopn when Rich Hunter's Irish soc­cer team ta.kies on top-ranked Indiana at Alumni Field at 2:00 p.m. Hunter has a crusade against Indiana, as a victory against the Hoosiers would show that the Irish belong among the best teams in the Midwest in soccer, and would go a long way towards an NCAA berth.
