Enforced retirement 
The exploitation ofemeriti 
ByJIM PLAMONDON 
News Staff 
Each year for the past twenty years, about eight or nine professors at Notre Dame reach the age of 65, retire, and are given the title of "emeritus". Although many f.tculty members actually look foward to this merited retirement, others wish to continue their careers and teach beyond this age. Despite their desires, the University of Notre Dame forces these professors to retire anyway. 
Dr. james P. Danehy, formerly a chemistry professor here at Notre Dame, challenged this policy in court in 1976. He pointed to the "Faculty Handbook ofthe Uni­versity of Notre Dame" as supporting his arguement. 
"Tenure," 
according to the handbook, "is permanence ol appointment." The definition of tenure implies 

that a person has the right ro hold an office or position. 
The faculty handbook also states that "a member of the faculty ordinarily retires and becomes emeritus on the first day of)uly following the faculty member's 6Sth birthday." These two passages in the handbook arc complt:tely contradictory. Danehy argues,"tenure is terminated by a birthday; there is nothing permanent about it." 
President Carter's 1977 amendment to the Age Dis­crimination in Employment Act ha.'i moved the retire· mcnt age to 70. The President felt that discrimination against older people was just as wrong a.o; discrimination against women, racial groups or religious groups. Danehy is upset because "Notre Dame's policy will be changed by federal law rather than recognition of jusuce." 
Professor Emiritus Rufus Rauch describes a faculty member's decision to retire as "a one way street." 
Professor of Sociology and Anthropology Dr. lrwin Press is "saddened by the fact that Notre Dame holds this policy." He adds that "the law will catch up with Notre Dame" when the 1977 amendment takes action." 
Several faculty members who are nearing the critical age of65 simply refused to comment on the issue. 
In addition to the ambiguity in the definition of tenure, Danehy contests another clause in the faculty handbook. It reads: "When a member is permitted to continue in active service beyond the date prescribed by retirement, service beyond that date will be on the basis of a year to year appointment, and the member will retire at the end of any service year unless reap-· pointed for another year." Some professors are rehired at a normal salary, teaching the same courses as before. Others, however, receive a much lower salary, three or four thousand dollars, for teaching the same courses. 
Danehy calls this "exploitation." He feels that Notre Dame takes advantage of the emeriti simply because they reach a certain age. In many cases a professor must face the decision of either losing his or her job com­pletely, or being rehired at this lower salary. 
Dr. Press believes that Notre Dame's policy is"less than charitable"in dealing with emeriti. Press is upset that "faculty members have given so much of their professional lives to the University...and haven't received fair treatment." 
Dr. Robert Vacca, assistant professor of Modern and Classical Languages, claims that the University "doesn't have a policy" and that most cases are "individualized." Yet he also realizes that the issue must not be treated as a one-sided question. "Younger people," he says,"must be given the chance to teach also." Ifprofessors insisted on teaching beyond the traditional retirement age, new teachers would lose valuble opportunities. 
Dr. Rauch, the representative for retired faculty members on the Faculty Senate, thinks that the Univer­sity has been successful in satisfying some of the

measure wnich expired Friday. 
Expressing frustration with Congress' inability to adopt budget bills in an orderly manner, Reagan said, "This is no way to run a ra.l· road." 
On Capitol Hill, House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill said, "The presi­dent just called me to tell me he'll veto it." O'Neill spoke to reporters as he recessed the House before it could vote on the compromise. 
Reagan has vowed repeatedly to veto any "budgt-busting" funding bill. 
O'Neill made his comments after Budget Director David A. Stockman told reporters the president found the compromise worked out over two grueling days of House-Senate negotiations was unacceptable. 
Faced with the threatened veto, it was not clear that congressional leaders would ever submit the proposal to a vote. 
Officials said that instead of hoping to resolve the dispute over the measure immediately, the ad· ministration was seeking a 15-day, stripped-down extension of the expired stop-gap funding bill. That would minimize disruptions in government services while Congress and the White House worked to resolve their disagree­ments. 
Technically, the government ran out of money at 12:0 1 a.m. 
The Reagan administration earlier had declined to say whether the president would accept the com· promise plan agreed to by House and Senate conferees as meeting his austerity budget or reject it with the

Campus escort service on trial this week 
By MARGARET FOSMOE 
News Staff 
The Campus Escort System has 
been placed on a trial basis this week 
in order to evaluate a lack ofinterest 
in the program, according to Brian 
Conway, Student Security Commis· 
sioner. 
The evaluation will determine 
whether student response is great 
enough to warrant continued exis­
tance of the program. If not, the 
service will be discontinued. 
The escort system was inactcd two weeks after fall break in response to what seemed to be a genuine interest in such a service. Utilization, however, has been mini· mal, with few womt~n students 
taking advantage of the service. In addition, the program has been plagued by organizational problems and a lack of male escort volunteers. 
Conway said there has been an es­cort system at Notre Dam,e on and off over past years. However, this is the first ume the program has lasted to a second consecutive year. 
The response has dropped con­siderably from last year, causing the need for a re-evaluation of the sys­tem to determine whether it will be continued. 
"Theprogram isfor the benefit of the student body as a whole~" 
Conway attributes much of the lack of interest to the fact that there have been no reported attacks after dark so far this year. This may have lulled students into a false sense of security. He warns: "Last year there were no attacks reported until about this time of year. Because of the warm autumn, more people have been out at night." Conway went on

CIA DirectorWilliam}. Casey, one of a hand­
ful of men with broad access to the government's secret data on 
international economic developments, has reversed the practice of 
his two predecessors and kept control ofhis personal stockholdings. 
Casey and his wife own stock worth at least $1.8 million, and per­
haps more than S3.4 million, in 27 corporations with major foreign 
operations. Many of the firms are involved with oil, natural gas and 
strategic minerals and operate in nations of deep interest to U.S. 
intelligence. llnlike Casey, others with access to closely held 
economic secrets -including President Reagan, Vice President 
George Bush, Secretary of State Alexander M. Haigjr. and Treasury 
Secretary Donald T. Regan -placed their holdings in blind trusts. 
Secretary Qf Defense Caspar Weinberger divested his stock in com­
panies which do business with the Pentagon, but he did not create a 
blind trust. Casey, whose past business dealings are under investiga­
tion by the Senate Intelligence Committee, maintains ultimate con­
trol over his stocks although an investment adviser handles 
day-to-day management of the portfolio, according to CIA general 
counsel Stanley Sporkin. -AP 
Massachusetts GeneralHospital,one ofthe 
nation's major medical research centers, issued new guidelines yes­
terday ordering doctors to avoid experiments on children unless the 
risks are "decisively outweighed" by the potential benefits. In all 
human experiments, the regulations say, "concern for the individual 
takes precedence over the interests of science and society." The 
new code is the first revision ofthe hospital's ethical gudelines in 11 
years. The rules were written by the hospital's Subcommittee on 
Human Studies, which reveiws human experiments at the institu­
tion. Dr. Edgar Taft, the panel's secretary, said Massachusetts 
General's $37. 7 million research budget is the largest of any in~e­pendent hospital in the United States, and halfofthis money is spent on human studies. "We are a group ofpeople who are committed to helping others and not making life more difficult for them or poten-. tially risky, and perhaps that's why we have tended to be so con­servative," Taft said in an interview. -AP 
Almost 300,000 Spaniards, offering the Fascist 
salute and ch<~ering the leader of last February's failed right-wing coup, packed a square in front ofthe Royal Palace yesterday to mark the sixth anniversary ofthe death ofdictator Gen. Francisco Franco. Rally organizers, emboldened by rumors in recent days predicting another coup called the turnout the biggest since Franco, Spain's iron-fisted ruler for 36 years, died on Nov. 20, 1975. The militant right-wingers defied a government order prohibiting the use of military uniforms and the Spanish flag at political raies. Dressed in the blue shirts of the Fascist-style Falange party and waving tens of thousa,nds ofthe red-and-yellow flags, they shouted for freedom for Lt. Col. Antonio Tejero, the Civil Guard officer who led the storming of Parliament nine months ago in a vain bid to overthrow the con­stitutional monarchy government. Raimundo Fernandez Cuesta, chief of the 11alange party, said the rally was not a routine com­memoration, "but a national affirmation, necessary because Spain is in danger ofdestruction." -AP 
Ringo Starr, back in Britain with his new wife after two years spent mainly in the United States, says he's happier than ever. In an interview with the Sunday Mirror, the drummer, singer and former Beatie said it wasn't fear of assassination that brought him home some six months after ex-Beatle john Lennon was slain in New York. "I'd been making an album every November and releasing it the following April. It was becoming boring, like working in a fac­tory," the 41-year-old millionaire musician was quoted as saying. Starr, who has a I 7th century mansion in Berkshire, marCied actress Barbara Bach, his second wife, last April. "Barbara has changed everything," he said. "Look at me. I'm smiling more than I ever used to and I'm in love." Starr's latest album, "Stop and Smell the Roses," is dedicated to Barbara. It also carries the inscription "Thanks to My Three Brothers," the other Beatles-john Lennon, George Harrison 
and Paul McCartney. -AP 
Fr.Joseph McVeigh, a Catholic priest from Ederney, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, will speak in the Library Auditorium at 8 p.m. tonight. His topic will be "Northern Ireland: Past, Present, and Future." The lecture, which is sponsored by Notre Dame's Center for Pastoral and Social Ministry, is open to the public. McVeigh, who is on study leave in the United States, was a Catholic chaplain at Long Kesh Prison from 1971 to 1975. During the con­troversial parl.iamentary campaign of the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands, McVeigh urged Catholic voters in Fermanagh and Tyrone to elect Sands and to make "a clear and direct statement to the British government: 'Rule with justice or get out." Since last April, Fr. McVeigh has been barred from Long Kesh Prison by Church authori­ties and government officials in Northern Ireland. -The Observer

Still on the Reagan team? 
When Office ofManagement and Budget Direc­
tor David Stockman began an eight-month series 
of interviews with William Greider, assistant 
managing editor of the Washington Post, he 
probably didn't realize the furor the article, 
published in the December issue of Atlantic 
Monthly, would create. In the 24-page piece Stockman did a lot of damage to the economic program President Ronald Reagan has tried to sell Congress and the public. Stockmam attacked the President's plans for budget balancing, tax cutting and defense spending, invalidating the program Stockman himself had worked "twenty hours a day for ten months" to shape. As the Atlantic ar' tide quotes in reference to his recommendations for cuts in Social Security benefits, a statement that easily . applies to his present situation, "Basically, I screwed up quite a biC' 
Stockman has never denied_ his quotes published inAtlantic but, instead has qucs~ioned Greider's right to quote him. "Do people think I'm (Stockman) a dope?" he questioned immediately after the story broke. "Does anybody think I'm stupid enough to say things like that with my name attached to it?" Yes, 
00 David, we do. "Nowhere ~ in our conversations did he (Stockman) ever say a word about 'This is all off ~ the record' or 'You're not ..~nfl,~[![j/f$ ]I going to quote me, right?" journalist Greider responded. The 18 At-YOU HAD TO TElL! lantic interviews were YOU JUST HN> TO TELL 1 conducted over an eight-\ month period, with "'-. plenty of time for Stock-man to refute any state­ments, and the OMB  director even posed for the magazine's photog­rapher last month. 
Since the inital uproar, 
however, Stockman's 

charges of Greider's un-.J...JII:,;iilll~iiii·II·IW with 35 tiny hatchets (to 
fair quoting have turned into a "misunderstanding" between the two, "not an act of bad faith" on either side. It's doubtful that Greider, a respected journalist and friend to Stockman would be unethical in his dealings with Stockman and publish something that was originally intended to be kept out ofprint. Instead it's much more probable that Stockman felt too relaxed and said too much to a newsman not afraid to do his job -reporting the facts. 
Stockman's apologies for his "loose talk," "poor judgment," "careless rambling" and use of a "rotten, horrible, infortunate metaphor (supply­side economics as a "Trojan horse" policy) have been delivered to the President, press and public, but one wonders when Stockman, if ever, will be forgiven. Greider's article, "The Education of David Stockman," reveals a candid, bureaucrat with enough courage to speak his mind but per­haps too foolishly. 
Reagan was angered by Stockman's remarks, yet

an intelligent asset to the Reagan administration, an asset it can't do without. For as much uproar as Stockman has caused, he still is a hard working, dedicated man who wants to remain a part of the President's "very happy group." His team, however, has been bickering among themselves lately, with Secretary of State Alexander Haig ab­solutely sure that someone is trying ~o replace him (not a bad idea, actually) and National Security Adviser Richard Allen misplacing a $1,000 (or is it $10,000?) token "gratituity" from· a Japanese monthly requesting an interview with Nancy Reagan. 
Stockman's credibility has been damaged more severely than Reagan's but Americans still want him to keep his job. The latestAssociated Press-NBC news poll shows th~t a majority of citizens who are familiar with the Stockman situation think the OMB director should remain and that his com­ments have not changed their minds about the 
li&.~..._.. chances of success ,for Reagan's economic program. Besides, Stock-man knows the budget better than anyone else. For Stockman's 35th birthday, Administration members gave him a cake

Stockman should con­tinue his membership, struggling with the dif­ficulties of the. bureaucracy, for of all Reagan's "team players," Stockman is one of the most vital members, much too valuable to lose.

WASHINGTON (AP) -Justice Department officials doubt that na­tional security adviser Richard V. AI· len received S10,000 instead of ! I ,000 from two Japanese jour­nalists, but that possibility is still being investigated, it has been 
learned. 
Meantime, presidential counselor Edwin Meese III said yesterda)(, "I don't sec any plans at the present time for Mr. Allen to leave the White envelope the money was in and "some kind of receipt" found in the safe. 
Miss Kamisaka has been quoted by two major Tokyo newspapers as saying she reminded Allen several times that she needed a receipt for the SI,000 she gave him for helping arrange the interview. Allen repeatedly promised to mail her a receipt but it never arrived, said Miss· Kamisaka. 

Allen has said he took the honorarium to spare Mrs. Reagan embarrassment an t d put it in his office safe, where he forgot about it until the cash was discovered by someone else eight months later.

N.D. students enjoy semester at sea 
ByDavid Guffey 
News Staff 
A year ago Chris Patricaski, a senior biology student, was on a schooner just off the Virgin Islands participating in an acreditied program called Sea Semester, and last Friday Patricoski gave a slide presentation and discussed the program which took him to sea for 54 days. 
Sea Semester is run by a private 
educational institution affiliated 
with several major colleges includ­
ing M.I.T., Cornell, and Boston Col­
lege. The program includes a six 
week shore component at Woods 
Hole, Massachusetts and a six week voyage aboard the research vessel Westwind. 
Patricoski left for Woods Hole in the Fall of last year. He and twenty participants spent the six weeks there taking three classes on sub­jects relating to the literature and science ofthe sea. 
Although the sea.-portions of the program begin in various ports around the East coast and Carribean, Patricoski's left from Woods Hole. From there, the ship headed north, made a loop around the Eastern At­lantic and then headed south for the warmer waters ofthe Carribean. 
Aboard ship, the participants have a rigorous schedule of classes and crew member duties. Duty times, called "watches" were spread throughout the entire twenty-four hour day and included kitchen, ship maintenence and scientific chores. The Westwind, according to Patricoski, "is one ofthe most active research vessels in the world." Much of his watch time was spent taking recording them for the government and research organizations. 
When the ship was near an island, 
participants were usually allowed to 
go ashore provididng that they were 
back to take their watches. 
Patricoski said that he went ashore a 
few times on some of the Carribean 
islands, was able to go snorkeling 
along the Tobago coral reef. 
Patricoski was the first Notre 
Dame student to participate in the 
program, but he commented that 
scheduling and transfer of credits 
was not difficult. 
Next semester two Notre Dame juniors, Jeanne Grasso and Barbra Jacobs will be participating in Sea Semester. Grasso commented that the cost of the program is com­parable to a semester at NotreDame. Transportation costs, hewever, to the port pf rendezvous made it slightly more expensive. 
Notre Dame is not directly af­
fliated with the Sea Education As­
sociation which conducts the Sea 
Semester. Daniel Winicur, assistant 
Dean ofthe college ofScience, com­
mented that there have been no 
problems fitting it into the academic 
programs of the' students who have 
decided to go. 
Dean Winicut commented that it 
"is a super program, from everything 
I've been told it is a well worthwhile 
experience that one can't get in the 
classroom." He also commented "I 
wish I'd had the oppurtunity to do it 
myself." 
There are eight sea semesters a 
year, however space is limited so ac­·ceptance into them is selective. Ap­plicants are chosen, ~ccording to Patricoski, by grades and e:x;tra­curricular activities invovled with water. One need not be a science

Protests mar German _visit by Brezhnev 
BONN, West Germany (AP) ­Soviet President Leonid I. Brezhnev arrived here yesterday for his first visit to the West in two years. Chan­cellor Helmut Schmidt was at the airport to welcome the Soviet leader and top level Kremlin officials and joined the motorcade rhat bypassed the site of anti-Soviet and peace protests. 
Brezhnev and his party, which in­cluded Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko, arrived just af­ter 7 p.m. at Bonn-Cologne airport, ringed by hundreds ofarmed guards. 
The ailing Soviet leader, who will turn 75 next month, moved careful­ly with short steps as he descended the Aeroflot jetliner's steps to meet Schmidt and West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. At one point he almost lost balance and was grabbed by a Soviet military of­ficer. 
Hours before the Kremlin chief arrived, 50,000 people took part in three anti-Brezhnev demonstrations in the West German capital to protest Moscow's military and human rights policies and demand nuclear disarmament. 
Brezhnev's talks with Schmidt and other officials have taken on new Im­portance because of the growing West European peace movement and next week's U.S.-Soviet talks on 
reducing nuclear missiles in Europe. The government mobilized 5,000 police to protect the Kremlin leader, and ordered about 20 groups of Af­ghan and other refugees to stay home. Agovernment spokesman said'On­ly refugees who had applications pendingfor political asylum were af­fected, but others were free to demonstrate. Earlier, officials rejected the Soviet Embassy's re­quest to, ban all protests during Brezhnev's four-day visit. 
In St. Joe county 
SMC chooses 'Hospice~. for charity 
By KANDY POWELL 
News Staff 
Hospice of St. joseph County has been chosen as Saint Mary's College charity for this year, Hospice was chosen through the result of a school survey given by Saint Mary's student government. Twenty-one­hundred surveys wen; distributed to tht· student body listing six possible charitys. Over 50 percent of the sur­veys were returned and the majority vote was determined to be Hospice. 
Hospice of St. joseph County is located in the Angela Building across from the St. joseph Hospital. It is a special program of health care for the terminal patient. Hospices don't fo<;us on death, but on the period of life that i~ left -making it more meaningful for the patient. 
Thl' interdisciplinary hospice team inludes a registered nurse as patient care coordinator, a volun­teer coordinator, the medical direc­tor, a social worker, a spiritual coordinator, an office manager, and volunteer nurses. Together they provide services for both family and patient. Hospice views its role as being four-fold, to provide medical relief for pain, to educate those in­volved in home care, to provide sup­portive servies, and to provide bereavement follow-up and council­ing for the family for up to a years time.

Police fear clash in Northern Ireland 
BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) 
-Police arrested three Protestant 
militants driving a van full of ex­
plosives yesterday, a day· before 
planned demonstrations and a 12­
hour general strike by Protestants demanding Britain crack down on the IRA. 
A police spokesman said the van was stopped at a checkpoint near Newtownards, a staunchly Protes­tant town I 0 miles east of Belfast. The Rev. lan Paisley, who has or­ganized today's "Day of Action" protest, plans to parade men of his vigilante-style Third Force in the town tonight. 
More than 600 members of the 
Third Force,, some of them armed, 
marched through two villages in 
Londonderry, northwest of here, 
Saturday night. It was the first time 
since Paisley founded the group two 
weeks ago that its members had 
publicly brandished weapons.

to the Yugoslavians as the Irish played catch up ball in the waning moments. Layups bv Predrag Bogos· lavjev and Branko Kovacevic and a pair of free throws by Slobodan Nikolic gave the Red Star tea~ an in­surmountable 76-6 7 lead with only 
1:22 remaining in the contest. 
Twenty turnovers, twelve in the second half, marked the demise of the Irish fortunes. Freshman Dan Duff was ineffective as a replace­ment for Mitchell, turning the ball over five times in his briefstint. 
"Dan just has to learn that you can't make a twenty-five foot entry pass. This game' was a learning ex­perience. It's just a matter now ofsit­ting down with thtc team, looking at the tape of the game and analyzing the individual performances," added Phelps: 
The major weakness appeared to· be the lack ofa conceptualized team \lefense. Several times the Yugos­lavians beat their men to the basket and the Irish had little or no weak si<': help. When there was help, it tended to be in the form of a shot blocking effort insteac of defensive positioning. 
"I'm not sure how we are going to rebound against the bigger teams," said Phelps. "We've been working on rebounding and we've got to come up with a defense. You've got to understand that this is a sophomore-junior oriented team and there's a lot ofgrowing up to do and injuries to overcome. But we'll figure it out. Just get ready for a dif­ferent style of play from last year. Our seven-footer this year will be our home crowd." 
Early season injuries are depleting an already sparse Irish roster. Twenty seconds into the game, Sluby crashed into the folding chairs in the band area cutting and bruising his left shqulder. Howevel', Sluby returned moments later after icing the bruise and played effectively hit­ting seven of his ten field goal at­tempts. 
Varner suffered a dislocated toe during.the frantic final moments and will remain sidelined for seven to ten days. Notre Dame's only authen­tic center, Tim Andree, is recovering

from an ankle injury slightly ahead of schedule and is expected to practice Thursday.

WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) ­Leon Burtnett, 38, defensive coor­dinator at Purdue University for the past five years, was named head foot­ball coach yesterday, replacing Jim Young. 
Young, who announced his retire­ment as coach last week, will become fulltime associate athletic director. 
· Burtnett qme to Purdue in 1977 after a year as assistant coach at Michigan State. He previously was . an assistant at San Jose. State, Wyoming, Washington State, Mon­tana State and Colorado State. 
Announcement of Burtnett's ap­.pointment was made yesterday at a news conference in Mackey Arena. Burtnett said all coaches on the Purdue staffwould be retained. "We're a close family. The exact duties of each coach could change, 
but I've asked them all to stay on," 
Burtnett said. 
He said the Boilermakers of the future would be "very, very pro oriented." 
The new Purdue coach said he prefers an oftense that includes pas­sing 60 percent of the time, con­trasted with Young's preferred ratio oftwo runs to every pass. 
Burtnett listed his No. I priority as retaining the players' currently on the campus. Recruiting was his second priority. 
"I feel I'm very strong in this area (recruith1g). It's still an exciting thing for me to go into the home ofa (high school) senior and try to inter­est him in coming to our school." 
Improving the defensive secon­dary is an immediate goal of Leon Burtnett, who was named Purdue University's 30th football coach at a Sunday new.s conference.

deflection)." 
The Irish threatened to widen their lead when they moved to PSU's four-yard line with about I 0 minutes left in the game. On fourth and inches, tailback Greg Bell tried to leap the pile-up, but was denied the gain. 
"It was a great call," Paterno stated. "It's just one of those things. You make it or you don't." 
Faust said a field goal at that point was out of the question. "We're not out there to tie, we're out there to win. A field goal would've just set it up for a tie, and they'd have probably gone for two anyway. With a half yard to go, you'vegot to go out there for the win." 
"On the goal line stand, we just knew we had to get down on them, fire out, and stop them right there," said Penn State defensive end Rich D'Amico. "We didn't want another blowout like we had against Alabama. We wanted the seniqrs to go out with their heads up and with a victory." 
/ 
Though victory escaped the Irish for the fifth time this year, it was a game they could walk away from with their heads up, too. 
"Notre Dame is a very fine football team," praised Paterno. "They're su­perior defensively and they execute very well. It's one of those games where you hate to see a team lose." 
"We wanted to beat Penn State to show people our last three wins weren't flukes," Sweeney said. "But I think we gained some respectability today." 
"It was a heck of a game for the spectators and a heartbreaker for the coaches," added Faust. "I can't fault our kids. I'd just like to be on the other side once in a while."

Ferguson runninghis -way back 
By SKIP DESJARDIN 
Associate Sports Editor 
ORCHARD PARK, NY -It's been a frustrating year for Vagas Ferguson. · just a year ago, hews a mainstay in 
the New England Patriots' starting lineup. Sam Cunningham was sitting tht· sca~on out in a comract dispute. Andy Johnson was out for the year with an injury. Chuck Foreman was but a shadow of what he'd been during his glory years at Minnesota. 
"Vagas was the guy we went to when we needed three or four sure · 
yards," says one club official. "He wa~ what football fans in New England call a 'bread-and-butter guy.' When we had to have the yards, 
Ferguson would get them." 
As th.e 1981-82 season opened, 
however, Ferguson was on the 
bench. An ankle injury suffered in 
one oflhe Patriots' preseason games 
was the culprit. 
At first. 
The new culprit is Tony Collins, a 
rookie our of East Carolina He took over the job as the Patriots starting running back when Ferguson was._ 
hurt, and wouldn't let go. His 751 
yards rushing leads the team and 
he's one of the few bright spots in 
Foxboro during this 2-10 season. Sunday's game here against the Ruft"alo Bills was typical of New England's misfortunes this year.

Joe Ferguson hit Roland Hooks with a desparation pass to the endzone, and Bufta.to shocked New. 
England 20-1 7. The Bills went 73 yards on two plays to pull out the victory. Overshadowed by the shocking -loss and by the 2-10 record -at least for Ferguson , -was the fact that he may have won his job back. "It's no con~olation," he insists. "It's not like I'm back in the lineup for good. Tony just had a had game." That's putting it diplomatically. On the Patriots' second posses­. sion, Collins fumbl_ed on the first play from scrimmage. The next time he carried the ball, Collins fumbled again, and never returned to the lineup. "Everybody's entitled to a bad game," says Ferguson, who came off the bench to lead New England in rushing. "I've had a few myself. Those things happen sometimes. The less said about them, the bet­ter." Perhaps it's the frustration, but Ferguson can't help talking about them. "I'm trying," he says. "I go out there every day and I do my best. Ap­parently, it isn't enough." Patriot officials insist that the ankle injury has prevented Fer­guson's return, but he doesn't buy that excuse. "I've been feeling good for two months," he says. "Sure, it's tough not playing, but what can you do? Tony's having a great season. That's just the way it goes. I can't do much more about it; I just work hard, and take things one step at a time." While there was very little "for Notre Dame fans to cheer about last weekend, there was cause to take heart. All is not lost. Vagas Ferguson is on the way back.

Dillon wins 
futerhall championship decided

Sports Writer 
The Big Red from Dillon Hall 
r:l!!ied for two fourth quarter touch­downs to captured the interhall ·football championship yesterday, by defeating the Off-Campus Raiders, 
14-0, at frozen Cartier Field. 
The game was scoreless for three· quarters and resembled an old NFL championship game played at Lam­beau Field in Green Bay or Soldier Field in Chicago. The sub-freezing temperatures and icy ground shut down both teams' offensive attacks most of the day. Although Ott­Campus maintained ball control in the first half, neither team threatened until the fourth quarter. 
The play that perhaps turned around the game for Dillon was a 42­yard fica flicker from Yogi Spence to Bob Wicke. _The bomb went to the Off-Campus l9-yard line, and three plays later, it pass from Kevin Kenny. Hart Green's point-after made it 7-0 Dillon, with about six minutes left in 
the game. 
"It was the first time. we used the (flea-flicker) play," Spence noted. "We designed it just this week." 
Dillon's furthest penetration prior to the flea-flicker was to the Off­Campus 45-yard line. In all, the drive went 61 yards in just four plays. 
On the play following the touch­down, Raider quarterback Matt Huf­fman was intercepted by freshman Brian Broucek. Huffman thought that play was the key to the game. "I thought we had a pretty good chance to drive in the fourth quar­ter," Huffman said. "But I threw that interception and that just caused a letdown for our defense." 
Following the interception, Big 
Red tailback Dave McMahon spear­
headed the drive for the final tally. 
McMahon's carries in the five-play, 
53-yard attack included a 21-yard 
run and a four-yard burst off tackle 
for the second Dillon to"uchdown 
with I:30 remaining. The frustration 
of the Off-Campus defense was fur­

Off-Cainpus desperately tried one more time on offense but Dillon's middle linebacker Mike McGuirt! picked off another errant Huffman pass to sew up the contest. McGuire, along with defensive ends Joe Boyle and Larry Andreini, were the key figures in the Dillon shutout. 
With the victory, Dillon com­pleted a perfect 6-0 season. As Big Red Coach Marty Finan said after the game, "They worked hard all year. We all felt we worked too hard all season to let a big play beat us in the 
second  half  All  season long  our  
defense  bent  a  little  but  didn't  
break."  

Dillon again showed the strong defense it did all season. On the year, Dillon allowed just eight points. "Our defense allowed us to stick with them," Finan noted. "They (Off-Campus) had just two good plays in the first half. Mike McGuire was the leader for us." 
Leading rushers in the game were McMahon, who gained 51 yards on 13 carries and the Raiders' Willie Sotis, who ran the ball 14 times for 45 yards. Reserve tailback Mike Dan­durand was another key .off of the Dillon bench, a~ he carried the ball six times for 27 yards. Bob Wicke, who has been a standout for Dillon all season long, finished with four receptions for 62 yards.

Big ones give Paterno trouble 
By CHRIS NEEDLES 
Sports Writer 

UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa.-It was a Penn State first down at its own 21, late in the third quarter. Lion tail­back Tony Mumford took the hand­off, but was stood up for no gain by Notre Dame's Bob Crable and Tim Marshall. 
The boos rained (or, more ap­propriately, snowed) down on Penn State coach Joe Paterno. Here he was, trailing the Irish, 21-1 7, after charging out to a qui.ck 17-7 ad­vantage in the first half. His offense had been stymied on its last six pos­sessions with only one first down, and Paterno was stubbornly sticking to his ball-control game plan. Maybe the cold finally was getting to him. 
But Paterno ignored the 84, 1 75 armchair quarterbacks in Beaver Stadium on Saturday. Being an op­timist, he no doubt thought they were booing the latest brutal gust of wind, or that everybody in the crowd was from Philadelphia and it was just a primal instinct for them to boo. 
Finally, Paterno's patience paid off, thanks to the marvelous running ofsophomore tailback jonathan Wil­liams. After two key defensive plays -a goal line stand and an intercep­tion -stopped Irish scoring drives that would have put the game away, Williams, who gained 192 yards on the day replacing the injured Curt Warner, ran for 46 yards on four carries to pace the Lions' winning 82-yard touchdown drive in the 
fourth quarter. Penn State went on to beat the Irish, 24-21, and Paterno had his vindication. 
Joe Paterno has been well revered in his 16 seasons at Penn State. Satur­day's win places him one short ofthe 150-victory mark for his career. But, in all those years of prosperity and bowl bids, he has one rap against him -he can't win the big game. 
The examples are numerous: the 1979 Sugar Bowl ( 14-7 loss to 
Alabama for the national champion­
ship); the 1976 Gator Bowl ( 20-9 
loss to the Irish); last year's 14-9loss 
to Pitt; and, most recently, this.. 
season's losses to Miami (Fla.) and 
Alabama. The alumni and other 
natives were getting restless. Many 
fans even displayed ".Joe Must Go" 
signs on Saturday. 

But, at least for this week, those rumblings will subside. "It was a great football game," said Paterno af. ter the game. "Notre Dame is a very fine football team. But it was gooq for us to come from behind in the closing minutes with the pressure on. 
"We've played so many good foot­
ball teams lately. It was a great win 
for Penn State. It feels good to come 
back." 

But, by no means is Paterno out of the woods yet. In between the first and last touchdown drives, the Lions offense was sloppy. The most telling series of downs was on Penn State's second touchdown, when it took the Lions·seven plays"to go the final three yards, with quarterback Todd Blackledge inching in for tbe score. 
And it won't get much easier. Pitt, the nation's No. 1 team by default, plays host to Penn State this Saturday in Three Rivers Stadium. "I haven't even had a chance to think about Pitt:" Paterno admitted. "They ob­viously have a great football team and it should be a great game." 
However, even with a win against the Panthers, there is still the Fiesta Bowl on New Year's Day against USC. Maybe, just maybe, a three­game wining streak to finish the season finally would knock that overweight monkey off Paterno's back. 
On Saturday. though, Paterno was content with beating the Irish, al­though Notre Dame is only a 5-5 team and played like one quite often against the Lions. "I'm especially pleased for our senior-s," he said. "They've worked too hard. I didn't want them to leave this place (Beaver. Stadium) wtth two straight losses." 
Neither did Joe Paterno. One got the impression that ifhe had, he may never have come back.

that reserve strength. You go out on 
the ice for thirty seconds, going 
hard, and you have to take a rest. So 
the fourth line becomes a very key 
part ofany success." 

The pair of Irish victories gives them a 2-3 mark for confrence games this season, compared to their 2-14-1 mark for the past two years. 
This weekend the Irish will host

By KELLY SULLIVAN 
Sports Writer 
UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. -The Irish will go to a bowl this season, confirmed Coach Gerry Faust. "We'll be in the Orange bowl next Friday," he acknowledged. "We'll be playing Miami (Fla.)." 
This week's nationally televised tangle with the Hurricaines will bring Notre Dame's 1981 schedule to a close after the Irish came up short against 13th rank.ed and Fiesta­bowl bound Penn State Saturday. 
Though it's true that quarterbacks get too much credit for a win and too much blame for a loss, a pair of big plays by the two sophomore field generals were the difference in the game's outcome. 
Irish signal caller Blair Kiel, who threw ·for 183 yards and a pair of touchdowns, also threw an untimely interception that led to PSU's win­ning score. 
"I guess it wasn't the smartest thing on my part," said Kiel of his toss to Phil Carter; it was picked off by third string tackk Greg Gattuso. "They were using a 'spy technique.' Their linebackers would come in and blitz and their linemen would drop off. Phil ran a good pattern and I tried to lob the. ball out there to him, but he (Gattuso) was there." 
Revitalized by the fourth quarter turnover, Penn Stat:'s Todd Black­ledge, booed for a poor performance earlier in the game, (:arne through in the clutch and marched the Uons of­fense 82 yards, carrying the ball over himself from the one-yard line to give his team a come-from-behind 24-21 win. 
"That quarterback delay was something we had last week," ex­plained Coach Joe Paterno. "It worked because Notre Dame doesn't use the option in their of­fense. They don't play against it." 
"Blackledge had a good game un­der adverse circumstances with the wind," he continued. "He made some good passes, ones to get us out ofa hole and he ran tough." 
But the toughest running was done by reserve tailback Jon Wil­liams. Subbing for an injured Curt Warner (State's leading rusher), the sophomore kept his ream on keel all day. He spearheaded the Irish defense when it counted most, carrying three straight times for 46
.. 
yards on Penn State's winning drive to set up Blackledge's plunge. Wil­liams had 192 total yards, the most gained by any back against Notre Dame this season. 
"Our kids thought Notre Dame might have gotten a little tired on our last drive (for the go-ahead score)," offered Paterno. "But that's what football games are all about. Two teams are in there slugging it out, and when you get some momentum, you go with it.'' 
"We didn't play very well at all, and I don't know why," offered linebacker Bob Crable about the defensive breakdowns that cost them the game. "They didn't show us anything different-we were just lousy." 
"We prepared for both Williams and Warner," explained tackle Tim Marshall. "There isn't much dif­ference between the two. He (Williams) just took advantage ofhis great offensive line and burned us." 

Yet earlier, Notre Dame had the offense that was on fire. They climbed from a ten point defecit to go up 21-17 on touchdowns right before and right after the half. Mar­shall's fumble recovery set up a Kiel to Tony Hunter score in the second q~arter. An interception by Crable

76 victory over the Fighting Irish of 
Notre Dame is easily explainable. 
The visiting Yugoslavians played as a 
team and Notre Dame didn't. It's as 
simple as that. The Red Star team 
used a deliberate almost methodical 
offensive approach which despite 
being unspectactular was steady and 
very effective. 
The Irish used full court pressure 
to take an early 22-8 lead sparked by 
fotward Bill Varner who scored half 
of Notre Dame's points during the 
successful stretch. But the Yugos­
lavians height advantage as well as 
their excellent outside shooting 
began to surface late in the first half 
narrowing the deficit to four, 41-37. 
"I thought we played extremely 
well during the first ten minutes," 
said Irish coach Digger Phelps. "But 
as the game progressed it became 
obvious that we couldn't handle 
them on the boards. They remained 
patient offensively and began to get 
the ball inside the lane. On the other 
hand, we started rushing our shots 
aud before you knew it, our 14 point 
lead had dwindled to four." 
Notre Dame's junior guard John 
Paxson tossed in 29 points connect­ing on 15 out of 16 from the line with Varner and Tom Sluby adding ' 17 and 14 respectively. But unfor­tunately the balanced scoring con­tributed by Paxson, Varner and Sluby didn't rub offon the rest ofthe starting lineup. Starting center Barry 
the field and Paxson's backcourt 
counterpart Mike Mitchell came up 
empty in four attempts. 
Sophitmore string-bean Cecil 
Rucker pitched in with 10 points 
and shared rebounding honors with 
Spencer as they snared seven each. 
Not surprisingly, it was Paxson, 
who also dished out a team leading 
six assists that caugl}.t. the eye of 
Yugoslavian coach Ranko Zeravic. 
"That number 23 runs the show for 
Notre Dame. He speaks one Ian· 
guage while the rest of the team 
speaks a second language." 
The Belgrade Red Star's spoke a distinct language oftheir own build­ing their vocabulary with "defense" as their base word. The Yugos­lavian's forced Notre Dame into 36 
percent shooting in the second half and a meager 43 percent for the game. 
"There's no doubt that they came to play tonight because they know who we are," said Phelps. "Europeans don't dribble against the press which was effective early but not late in the game. They're fun­damentally sound, they shoot well, and they're starting to build a team in much the same way Russia did before the boycott by touring the United States." 
The press that was instrumental in h<>llooning Notre Dame's lead in the first ten minutes posed no problem
