The punishments for violations of theovernight parietals rule were discussed at last illght's Student Senate meeting, but no official stand was taken on the penalties, according to Student Senator Brian Holst. The senators looked at the proposal presented by junior Bruce Lohman to the Campus Life Council several montns ago, said Holst. Lohman's proposal would eliminate from du Lac the provision that "overnight parietal viola­tions involve suspension or dismissal" and replace it with a provi­sion providing for a lesser penalty in most cases.

Domers' different dialects display diversity of origin across campus 
Y'a/1 come back now, y'hear? 
-Minnie Pearl 
Grand Ole Opry 
Accents are funny. 

One time during my first year at Notre Dame I was surprised to hear someone say "Hey, you guys!" to a group of girls. 
Since then I have noticed repeatedly the use of "guy" for all students at this school, regardless of age or sex. I've used it a lot myself. 
It has taken me a while, however, to get used to the local Midwestern dialect. I'm from Tennessee, and down there we normally don't refer to girls as guys. I guess that's one of the things one has to deal with when coming to a university in northern Indiana. 
That there are so many colorful ways to talk in the nation is exemplified by the student body here. The University of Our Lady attracts students from all over the states. People from Hawaii to Miami bring with them the twists and twangs of the tongue they speak at home. In addition to these are the foreign accents that can be heard among the prevalent regional dialects. 
I soon began to notice many different ways to say the plural you other than you guys. 
 
Dudes is a popular one, probably derived from the beach-set trend mixed with southern influence. It's a good word for fitting into difficult places. It's often used as an interjection, as well. "Dude, g'bye," is how one of my roommates signs off the phone. The pro­blem with dude is that it works well only with guys, er, men. 

 
I'm told that you'uns comes from the Pittsburgh area, although it permeates quite a bit of the East. In the city itself, supposedly the people shorten the phrase to y'ins. Not a pretty sound to call someone, at any rate. 

 
Youse also rises from the East, although it's popularity seems to be fading even there. But youse generally is followed by guys, which causes problems again. 


The difference in dialects don't always create dif­ficulties. Two years ago, I knew a New Yorker who had a twin brother also attending Notre Dame. The two were impossible to tell apart, except that one of them always said "kid" and the other "guy." So if I met them at the same table in the dining hall, I couldn't tell which one of them I had sat down next to until one said, "Hey, guy (or kid), how's it goin'?" 
Although accents are often helpful and colorful, they also can get in the way and cause normal conver­sations to be like obstacle courses_ in which the 
Tripp Baltz 
News Editor 
speakers stumble over "huhs?" "whats?" and "come agains?" 
Consider how difficult it can be to explain to a din­ing hall worker that you are not requesting something, but asking what it is. 
Regional accents are less of an issue in this country than they are in one like Germany, where a southerner cannot be understood at all by a northerner. Dialects were formed in parts of Europe as ancient tribes settl­ed. Often these tribes were separated by huge moun­tain walls into isolated valleys. 
The quick manifest destiny of America prevented such confusion from occurring in our own language. Imagine what it would be like if a Chicagoan went to Los Angeles and had to take along a "California Phrase Book." 
The issue of whether you guys or another phrase is best for general use arose in an argument I overheard last weekend. Finally, a friend of mine and fellow Memphian stopped the discussion, widely extended his arms, smiled broadly, and said, "Y'all." 
Finally, it was established that there was a single term that could be used in any situation. Just say to yourself, "Y'all come up and party with us some time." Now that is a name that could be applied to anybody. 
The warm, all-encompassing sound of Y'a/1 seemed to end the debate.

Gorbachev courts W. Europe in effort to disband alliances 
Associated Press 
BERLIN -Soviet leader Mikhail 
Gorbachev stepped up his courtship 
of ~estern Europe yesterday by 
saying he would support disban­
ding the Warsaw Pact and NATO 
alliances. 
At the same time, Gorbachev 
voiced readiness to meet again with 
President Reagan if "the ap­
propriate international atmosphere 
is created." 
The Soviet leader, on a visit to East Germany, also charged that the United States had ignored the opinion of its West European allies by sending warplanes to bomb Libya last week. 
In a speech to workers in East Berlin, the Soviet Communist Par­ty general secretary said Moscow was ready for "a simultaneous disbanding of the Warsaw Pact and NATO, or, for a start, their military organizations." 
The Soviets have previously said they were prepared to scrap the of­Warsaw Pact if the West dissolved the NATO military alliance. The offers have been viewed with skep­
ticism in the West. 
On the possibility of a superpower 
summit this year, Gorbachev said, 
"We are ready for a Soviet­
American meeting so long as the 
approporate international at­
mosphere is created, and real disar­
mament steps are possible." 
His remarks were reported by East 
German television. The state-run 
network filmed Gorbachev's speeCh 
in a machine tool factory in a 
suburb of East Berlin, and 
translated his Russian words into 
German. 
Western diplomatic sources said 
Gorbachev's repetition of the pro­
posal dovetailed with appeals he 
has made to Western Europe from 
East Berlin in the past few days. 
"It looks like this, too, is aimed across the (Berlin) Wall at the West Europeans," said one Western diplomat, who spoke on the condi­tion that he not be identified. 
Yesterday, in his speech to the workers, Gorbachev repeated the proposal on conventional arms and said he also favored "all-European 
cooperation on economic, 
ecological and other issues." 
"It is finally time to grasp the sim­ple thought that the barriers can be removed," he said. Gorbachev then expressed readiness to meet with Reagan. 
Gorbachev kept up his criticism of Reagan yesterday, charging that the United States' "piratical action (against Libya had) not only failed to take notice of world public opi­nion, but of the majority of its NATO allies too." 
Gorbachev has used his public ap­pearances to issued several statements and proposals on disar­mament and East-West relations. Gorbachev's suggestions that troop levels and conventional weapons be reduced have already met with a positive response in West Ger­many, where Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday described the pro­posals as a "step forward." 
After his speech, Gorbachev at­tended the closing session of the East German party congress where President Erich Honecker was unanimously re-elected Communist Party chief. 


Trial continues in attack on baby 
Associated Press 
PROVIDENCE, R.I. -Donna Richard warned her sobbing hus­band shortly after their baby's raped and beaten body was found to "act like a man or they're going to pin this on us," a state police detective testified yesterday. 
"She was pointing her finger at him and speaking to him angrily," Detective Richard Paulhus told the jury weighing whether Ralph Richard raped his 4-month-old daughter, Jerri Ann. 
"She stated to him that he better straighten up, get himself together and act like a man or they're going 
to  pin  this  on  us,"  Paulhus  
testified.  
Mrs. Richard, who  is  c.harged  

with murdering Jerri Ann, then realized several officers had entered the room at Pawtucket police head­quarters and asked the officers to leave, the detective testified.

Paulhus said he then questioned Mrs. Richard, who he said showed "no emotion at all." Mrs. Richard, 34, who is staying with her father in Indiana, will be tried after her hus­band. 
The alleged conversation between the Richards took place on Nov. 15, 1984, less than two hours after the infant's body was found in an alley one block from the cou­ple's Pawtucket apartment.

traveling with a . swimsuit cover­girl, Barr said he finds the job of publisher "tough." "The publisher faces many complex challenges. Publishing is five businesses within one: editing, circulation, promo­tion, sales and production." 
When giving students advice on entering careers in the magazine in­dustry, Barr warned that the com­petition level is extremely high. Most magazine writers have ex­perience working for newspapers and work their way up to larger publications. 
Barr emphasized that those who are interested in careers in writing or photography can only improve 
their ability through the everyday practice of working for a newpaper.

Interviewing strategy helps land job offers 
P.O. BoxQ 
Sooner than many of you youngsters think, you will embark upon a quest for employment and a stake In the harsh realities ofthe outside world. To those with respectable academic standing this will not be a problem. UnJess you come off as arrogant, an egghead or a Motley Crue fan, you will probably land several offers before Christmas. This article is not for you.

guest column 
I have a job and I am proud to say it's a darn good one. My GPA, however, indicates that on the eve of tests I was perfecting my outside jumper at the Rock. I interviewed over twenty times, my first fifteen letters resulting in a big, white goose egg. After semester break, though, I received five call-backs from seven interviews. 
What caused this dramatic turnaround? I simply utilized techniques which Increased my chances. These techniques display inter­est, competence and, most importantly, make you stand out in the interviewer's mind. 

I was lucky in the respect that I have an ac­counting major and by some quirk of nature accountants are in high demand. My job, however, is onJy distantly related to account­ing and the starting salary is more than ade­quate. These tips should benefit all interviewees regardless of major. There are good jobs out there and you can go for them with minimal effort since many companies will interview here. 
This advice is from experience -failures as well as successes. I am experienced in both areas. This article is my duty to those who also wallow in the academic depths of degrada­tion. I feel compelled to impart this knowledge to my fellow Rockne Memorial Warriors before I leave. 
Acquire experience in your field: ifyou have the opportunity to secure an internship then do it. Notre Dame doesn't utilize a co-op program such as Drexel's in Philadelphia. Try working in your career area this summer. In­terviewees eat this stuffup for it demonstrates knowledge of your potential job and knowledge of yourself since you have tested your career desires and stuck with them. 
(Information on internships Is at the Place­ment Office.) 
Study 
the company: Learn early how to use the r,brary's faclllties. Read every human in­terest story on the firm from the past ten ye<tr's issues of the Wall Street Journal. This does not require much time. Forget the finan­cial statements. Any dweeb can recite last year's sales. Pick out interesting or humorous stories regarding the company. Research supplies confidence and small-talk material. The Placement Office's research center is only a start since everyone will be reading that material and you need an edge. 

Make 
charts of your GPA: The first question always asked is, "Why the ugly GPA?" If you have solid support displaying, say, academic progress, you will demonstrate forsight and an ability to explain. For example, my chart shows my GPA broken down between class grading formats: presentation vs. testing. I have a 2.2 in testing classes; a 3.1 in presenta­tion oriented classes. This gives me support for my contention that I do not test well. 

Show 
enthusiasm and Interest: You must show more of this than the other guy. Every job interview should be approached with the 


attitude that you never wanted to work for anyone else. Give reasons why you chose them over their competitors even ifyou inter­view with those competitors the next day. 
The 
interviewer: Make sure to inquire about the person judging you. For example, ask what college he attended. Do this before the inter­view and bring it up during to give the inter­view a personal tone. 

Take 
the mock interview: Thi~ is es1-ential, professional, and free. We at Notre Dame are fortunate to have an understanding placement office. They are helpful, cordial, understand­ing and professional. They do a great job in optimizing employment opportunities. Many interviewers commented on how well they are treated and this helps you! I have had the pleasure to know three in particular (Kate Dascenzo, Mary Waggoner and Katie Wesolowski) and they know they have my deepest thanks and respect. 


Finally, make sure to read some material on interviewing. I hope all of you find the same success that I did.

U.S. not attacking root of Middle East problem 
Dear Editor: 
Mary Jacoby's compelling article explains why most European countries have refused to sanction the recent U.S. bombing ofLibya. The problem with Reagan's latest resort to violence is that it strikes out at the symptoms of terrorism, rather than addressing the source. 
Reagan describes the bombing ofTripoli as 
a retaliation for terrorist atrocities Inflicted on 
Americans abroad. He supposes that crippling 
Libya's military capacity will somehow begin 
to extinguish the fires ofterrorism. 
But the Middle Eastern enemies ofAmerica are elusive and ubiquitous. Many of these guerrillas envision their struggle against the United States as nothing less than a holy war. They are therefore prepared, if not eager, to die on behalf oftheir adopted cause. Bombing Libya probably has made Khadafy even more of a hero to proponents of jihad against the United States. It has probably also redoubled the commitment of these fanatics to ridding the Middle East of the American presence. 
The alternative to military action against Libya is not passivity. A saner and more promising middle route would be to try to pressure Israel into seriously addressing the grievances of displaced Palestinians. No one

can guarantee that peace between Israel and the Arab world is possible. But the United States would surely win more friends for itself in the Middle East by playing a more even­handed role in the seemingly perpetual struggle between Israel and its neighbors. 
As long as the United States continues to align itself wholeheartedly with Israel-as long as we afford the Israelis a Middle East -we will continue to suffer at the hands of terrorists in Europe and throughout the Mediterranean. Bombing Libyan docks and missile sites will not discourage terrorists any more than creat­ing martyrs would dissuade the fanatical fol­lowers of any other religious cause.

Former Notre Dame basketball player Jim Dolan (left) and cur­rent Irish football player Mike Kovaleski (right) trap former Irish and Dallas Mavericks forward Tom Sluby in a game yesterday behind the bookstore. Sluby's eight buckets were not enough for his Goldprick and The Wire Tappers team as they bowed to Lee's BBQ, 21-12. Details ofall the action can be found at right. 
ND signs recruit 
Special to Tbe Observer 

Jamere Jackson, a 6-2 guard from Peoria Manual H.S. in Peoria, Ill., signed a national letter of intent to attend Notre Dame yesterday. 
Jackson averaged 16 points, six rebounds and three assists last year at the shooting guard position. Peoria Manual finished with a 32-2 record, including a loss in the Illinois AA semifinals. In addi­tion, Jackson has a 3.3 grade point average, a fact that impressed Irish head coach Digger Phelps as much as Jackson's basketball skills. 
"Adding Jamere will give us some needed strength in our backcourt,'' commented Phelps. "We watched Jamere in the Il­linois state tournament and felt he really finished the year strong­ly. He's an outstanding student who ranked 13th in his class -he impressed us both as a student and as an athlete. We'll need him as a second guard." 
Jackson, who was named all-state by the Associated Press, The Champaign News-Gazette and the Illinois Baketball Coaches Association, will join Keith Robinson (30.3 points, 20 rebounds), Scott Paddock" (17.5, 14.4), Tony Jackson (15.9, 14.9) and Joe Fredrick (23.8, 7 .5) in next fall's freshman class of recruits. 
Women's Bookstore field advances into third round 
By KATHLEEN McKERNAN

Today at 4 p.m . the third round ,·of Women's Bookstore Basketball opens on Lyons and Stepan courts. 
Last year's runner-up, the second-seeded Revenge of the Quixotic Quint, takes on 4 Shots and a Chaser at the Lyons site. The Quint defeated the respectable Da­quiri Dolls and Popcorn and the Jakes to advance to the third round. The 4 Shots and a Chaser, on the other hand, dominated a not-so-serious Domerettes team and earned a forfeit victory over Hard Liquors. 
On the other Lyons court, Challenger & Four Other Balls of Fire will go against Chic Superhoops. Challenger, paced by Beth Noland's 13 and Karen Phelps' 10 points over the weekend had little difficulty with USA for Canada and Take Us to Dinner, You'll Get Your Just Desers, outscoring its competition by a combined score of 36-11. 

At the Stepan courts, The Almosts, the heart of Walsh's in­terhall team with Patty and Sue Mileski, play P.W.'s Pee Wees. The Pacers, hot off an upset vic­tory over the Fighting Chicken Pat­ties, play The Heels. 
We Weren't Cheerleaders in High School, who destroyed 5-3 And Under and lost an opportunity to play the first-seeded team when Shooting Back forfeited, will take on the Slammers. 
In probably one of the better, most balanced, match-ups of the tournament thus far, Voces Dames play Negligence. And Violent Fem­mes II, who toyed with the Flam­ingos Sunday, will go against Clut­ching at Straws. 
Double Decker Oreo Cookie, one of the remaining favorites, will play against Hearnism's Better Half. Oreo Cookie shut out We Don't Know What to Call Ourselves Sunday and nearly turn­ed the trick in the first round on Friday.

Bookstore XV field trimmed to 32 as original sixteen seeds advance 
By SCOTT INGLIS 
Sports Writer 
Bookstore Basketball XV con­tinued yesterday with 64 teams braving near-freezing temperatures, near-frozen basket­balls, and man's favorite animal, the referee. Despite these adverse conditions, however, all 16 of the seeded teams :irl ttle knifhaJrient snr~ved the round, with only ~two of these teams experiencing much difficulty. 
The two seeds experiencing the most trouble yesterday were Mr. Coffee and the Non-Dairy Creamers and Keenan Inmates II. Mr. Coffee was led by Milt Jackson and Erik Janoasky, whose five and seven baskets respectively helped their team overcome Hill's Billies performance, 21-19. Ralph Ferrara shot a torrid 9-15 for the losers. 
In the other close scrape, the In­mates needed a final shot by Jim Reed, who it was learned later had broken his foot in the game, to defeat Josephus and the Ethiopian Shim-Sham, 23-21.

Losing skid reaches seven games as Irish drop four games to Detroit 
By RICK RIETBROCK 
Sports Writer 
Frustration is the key word for the Notre Dame baseball team right now. Head Coach Larry Gallo and his forces dropped four straight to visiting Detroit, which runs their losing streak to seven straight losses. 
Although Gallo has refrained from using injuries as an excuse all season, he finally admits that in­juries have taken their toll on the Irish. 
"We don't have Tommy Shields right now and we've got a handful of guys who have played hurt all season,'' Gallo said. "Now we lose (Steve) Skupien (hand injury) today and sooner or later you're going to get hurt by all those injuries. 
"We haven't been able to field 
our number-one lineup once this 
season.'' 
The series started on a bad note 
with Detroit scoring two runs in the 
first inning. Things never brighten­
ed as Detroit went on to win, 8-6. 
The Titans collected 11 hits in 
beginning the four-game sweep.

strength of 11 Rob Kossler hoops. 
One of last year's fans' favorites, Tofu Chaka Khan, defeated Los Milandros 21-14 to continue on its road to a second straight year in the Sweet 16. Before they get there, however, Tofu will have to over­come a strong Nutmeggers team in the next round. Nutmeggers defeated Now We Go To School 21-17 to set up the confrontation with Tofu, taking place on Bookstore 9 at 5:30 today. 
In the human-interest story department, the Nads surmounted 
Flynn had two RBls apiece, while 
Pat Pesavento got three hits to help 
the Irish cause. Kevin Chenail was 
the starter, and Brad Cross took 
the loss in relief. 
The second game was a slugfest 
in which the Irish came back, but 
still came up short, 13-10. With the 
score 10-3 entering the seventh, the 
Irish came up with four runs, 
highlighted by a Ken Soos triple 
and also aided by two Titan errors. 
Soos then homered in the eighth, a three run shot, to tie the game, and it appeared the teams were headed into extra innings. But Lowery answered in the Detroit half of the tenth with a three run home run off Irish losing pitcher Tommy Howard to take the doubleheader sweep. Soos finished the game with three extra-base hits and six RBI. 
Sunday's doubleheader was changed to avoid Sunday's rain, only to run into yesterday's bitter cold. No matter what the weather was like, however, the results re­mained the same. 
In the series' third game, Bryan Tucker held Detroit's run barrage in check, but the Irish were still Catherine the Great meets Mr. Ed -The Final Encounter, 24-22, setting up a meeting between two brothers's teams. Roberto Cano, of the Nads, will be playing against his brother, Manuel, of the aforemen­tioned Mr. Coffee, at 6:15 on Stepan 4. 
On Stepan 6, meanwhile, last year's champion, Fun Bunch Finale, advanced again by clipping Red Wings by a score of 21-13. The Bunch duo of Greg Dingens and Rick DiBernardo combined for 13 baskets and 23 rebounds between them in a game that would see many shots miss the mark before

denied victory. The lanky lefty and 
reliever Erik Madsen combined to 
hold the Titans to three runs, but 
that was just enough to beat the 
Irish 3-2. 
Once again, the Irish staged a 
comeback that came up short. 
Trailing 3-0, they scored twice on a 
Scott Rogers single, Tim Hutson 
double, and an error on Detroit's 
third baseban, Phil Biggs, that 
allowed Skupien to reach. Skupien 
was stranded on third, however, 
and the Irish could not push 
another run across. 
In yesterday's series conclusion, Detroit once again jumped out in front with two runs in the first and went on to take a 10-5 win. The Irish came back to tie with single runs in the first and second innings, but Detroit assumed command for good with a run in the third and three in the fifth. 
The Irish record drops to 15-20, including 1-7 in the Midwestern Collegiate Conference. They are on the road facing Lewis University today, and return to Jake Kline Field tomorrow to battle Bowling Green.
