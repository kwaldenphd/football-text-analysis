From tragedy to tourney 
Rivers returns from injury to lead Irish into NCAAs 
By DENNIS CORRIGAN Sports Editor 
For Notre Dame's David Rivers, the 1986-87 basketball season has been a long climb. 
Barely more than six months ago, Rivers was in a hospital fighting for his life. Now he's once again leading the Irish fight for a national title. 
On Aug. 24, 1986, Rivers and former Irish teammate Ken Barlow were involved in an auto accident in which Rivers was hurled through the window of the van Barlow was driving. Rivers suffered a 15-inch cut to his abdomen and underwent three hours of surgery. 
He remained in the hospital un­til Sept. 2 and into the Notre Dame infirmary until Sept. 13. At the time, basketball was not a priority, recovering from the accident and trying to keep up with classes was. 
On Sept. 21, Rivers began a long and trying rehabilitation program which included tread­mill work, limited weights, riding an excercise cycle and later jogging and shooting in a swimming pool. Through it all, Rivers kept his perspective, and worked to get back on the court. Now with an NCAA berth secured he knows it was all worth it. 
"It was something that I was enthusiastic about doing be­cause I knew it was geared to getting better and my getting back on the court," says Rivers. "So all the rehab and the training was for this. It was for us getting an NCAA bid and having a shot at the title." 
It wasn't until Oct. 6 that Rivers began to run on a track and Nov. 1 that he began to shoot and have limited partic­ipation in practice. Finally on Nov. 16, he was able to practice full speed. 
He saw 34 minutes of play in Notre Dame's opening loss to Western Kentucky. Less than two weeks later, he went the full40 minutes in Notre Dame's near upset of Indiana. From then on he began to show im­provement, scoring 16 and 20 points in wins over Cornell and Brigham Young. But as he progressed, Rivers had to deal with reporter after reporter who was writing a story on his miraculous recovery. 
"Yes, I was (tired of talking about the accident)," says Rivers. "But you've got to look at it this way, they're doing their job., I guess people are curious. They want to know. I looked at it in that way. I didn't think of it as being a negative. I tried to see the positive side of it just to keep me from being, I guess, bored." 

Looking back now, Rivers gives credit to the extended Notre Dame family for giving him the strength to continue. 
"When I was having a crisis, everyone was there for me," says Rivers. "No matter what it was I needed, there was someone there to give it to me. Coach Phelps was there, the guys on the team were there as were families around South Bend. It helps out a lot because you know there are people out there pulling for you and praying for you. It keeps your spirits up." 
But just as he started to show signs of getting over his acci­dent, Rivers tore a thigh muscle in late December and sprained an ankle (he still wears a water cast on it) in Jan­uary against Creighton. Both injuries hampered his effec­tiveness and the Irish struggled into the last week of January with a 9-5 mark. Rivers now ad­mits to feeling a little frustrated.

Rivers' soaring layup over Miami's Kevin Presto symbolized his rise from near death to a a shot at a national title. 
Hicks' fills roles for ND as career draws to close 
By TERRY LYNCH Sports Writer 
Sometimes success is just a matter of waiting your turn. 
For guard Scott Hicks, it is this formula that has led the senior Irish co-captain from In­dianapolis to grab his share of the limelight in his final court campaign. Hicks' solid play in the backcourt with teammate David Rivers has been a con­stant force on the tournament-bound Irish team. 
But there's been a lot more to it than that. Scott Hicks wasn't in a van accident in the sum­mer and doesn't have a 15-inch scar across his stomach. But when The Accident happened, Hicks found himself in a strange position -alone in the back court. 
"I just think Scotty knew this year that we needed more scoring from the second guard spot with Stevenson, Royal, and Rivers being the main guys on offense," said Head Coach Digger Phelps. 

"I think he just has a lot of con­fidence right now. We've just let him go all year and he's played very, very well." 
Hicks responded in the back­court this season by averaging 
11.2 points per game, way above his 5.4 average last year and slightly higher than the 8.8 
average during his sophomore year. Hicks is second to Rivers in steals with 33, and is third on the team in rebounding, averaging 4.2 boards a contest. He lead the team in scoring in an early-season loss to Indiana with 18 and in the upset of 15th­ranked Duke with 19. 
But for all of the statistics, Hicks has viewed his role this year as just a matter of filling in the voids left by year's seniors. 
"I think this year I had to take a different role out on the court than last year," said Hicks. "Last year we had Tim Kempton, Kenny Barlow, Jim Dolan and Joseph Price and now this year with David, Mark, and Donald, I just take a different role and look at it a different way. 
"I think my role is to do what is needed at a particular time.

Hicks chases Tourney dream

"When you're a senior, every­one looks at it as your most im­portant year," continued Hicks. "But by just being a senior, that means that Donald and I have to lead by exam­ple." 
Combined with co-captain Donald Royal's team-leading 
15.6 points per game, these two seniors will be missed by next year's team. But some other people might welcome the two players in the basketball world. 
Will Hicks play in the NBA? 
"Obviously, that's hard to say right now," says Phelps. 

"I'm just going on what the NBA guys have told me, and they're all in love with Royal. They think they can use him as a small forward or even a guard." 
Royal also sees Hicks' emer­gence as a matter of time. 
"It's a matter of just waiting your turn," said Royal. "With David's accident, it was a dif­ficult situation for him to get in. But he made the best out of it. He went out and proved it." 
For Hicks, the story of his season is still being written. There's still more one step to take before it's all over. 
"Our goal at the beginning of the season was to go as far as we can in the tournament -and that's a national champion­ship," said Hicks. If we play hard and do what we have to do, we can capture the dream.

l was coming from what 
had experienced in the acci­dent," says Rivers. "I sort of laughed at the minor injuries. I didn't really put that much emphasis on them because I had come back from near death. An ankle injury isn't that bad." 
As if Rivers' basketball frustrations weren't enough, the University announced that it was converting River's residence hall, Howard, into a women's dormitory in the fall of 1987. 
"I think they should have let us know a year in advance, but that's the way they did it," commented Rivers of the deci­sion. "I really didn't feed into that much. I had other things to occupy my time. I was dis­appointed because I liked living in Howard. I've created some relationships with cer­tain people around, and now we're going to be broken up be­cause of that. That's the admin­istration. I'm not going to get involved in that."

Blue Raiders not awed by Irish

CHARLOTTE, N.C. -When Notre Dame takes to the court Thursday afternoon to face the Blue Raiders of Middle Tennes­see St., it will be facing a team it doesn't know much about and has nothing to lose. 
"I don't think we'll be in awe," said Blue Raider head coach Bruce Stewart Sunday after he learned his squad would be facing the Irish. In­stead, it should be a motivator for us. We will obviously be the underdog since they are the fifth seed. We've been the fa­vorite in nearly every game we've played since Christmas.

Marquette to close out that month and then began a February unlike any other in Notre Dame history. On Feb. 1, the Irish defeated top-ranked North Carolina. Rivers was key in the win, coming up with jumpers in clutch situations, usually with the Tar Heels' Ranzino Smith in his face, in leading the Irish to their 60-58 upset. 
"(The North Carolina win) was

very big because I had lost to them the last two years," recalls Rivers. "I wanted to win. My father was up here for the first time to see me play. I knew it was going to be a mo­ment for him and myself. I really wanted that one pretty bad. To go out, be able to play and come up with the victory wc.s a very special moment."

since. Upsets of Duke and DePaul on the ACC court fol­lewed, as did road victories over Utah, Marquette and Dayton. Rivers had 21 at Mar­quette and 22 in a home win over Miami. In a season once filled with adversity, Rivers bounced back to average 14.7 points per contest and hand out 153 assists -the second-highest season total in Notre Dame his­tory. It has been a tough season for Rivers, but now he looks back on it in a way that also looks ahead to the NCAA Tournament.
