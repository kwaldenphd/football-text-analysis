:IN BRIEF 
A roadblock could block Dan Quayle's visit to Napolean, Ohio next week. City Council members voted Monday 3-2 to close the street in front of the courthouse for Quayle's campaign stop. But at least four votes were needed to block off the street. A sixth Councilman, a Republican, is out of town this week and missed Monday night's meeting. The two Democrats on the Council who voted against street closing said they were not against Quayle's visit, but rather they did not like the way the is~ue was ~r?ught before Council. "I didn't want to be put m the pos1tlon to make this decision without any prior notice. So I'm looking at it as he (Mayor Steven Lankenau) wants special per­mission from me for a gala Republican meeting out in front of the courthouse .... I could not say yes to that," he said. Bachman said after the vote he suggested that Quayle should appear at the high school football stadium.--Asso­ciated Press

INSIDE COLUMN 



Cleaning up your act is a dirty business 
Laundry is one of those small chores moms take care of, children take for granted, and college students take home. 
In between breaks, however, students are forced to bite the bullet, collect their quarters and hit the wash room themselves. 
When I was younger, I considered laundry a rather mystical practice. Every night, I'd habitually discard my dirty clothes in the laundry chute, and the next day they'd magi­cally reappear in my dresser drawers, fresh and folded. 
I wasn't sure exactly what happened during those quiet hours between dusk and dawn down in the depths of my basement, but whatever it was kept me in spotless shirts ami clean jeans, so I didn't complain. 
Ah, ignorance was bliss! 
The summer before my freshman year, the myth was dispelled. One early August morning, Mom dropped the bomb. After summoning me down to the laundry room, she carefully ex­plained that it was meticulous mothers-and not Dynamo dwarves-that kept kids in clean clothes. Adding insult to injury, she explained that one day I, too, would be subject to this foul chore. 
Reality really set in the day I left for school. As my parents kissed me goodbye, Mom pushed a roll of quarters into my palm.

Speaker pushes for consistent life ethic 
By BRIDGET 
GOEYVAERTS 
News Staff 
Abortion is not the only pro­life issue that must be ad­dressed today, according to Ronald Sider, executive direc­tor of a political action commit­tee that supports political can­didates who uphold a "consistent life ethic." 
The major pro-life issues are abortion, nuclear arms and poverty, Sider said last night in a lecture in the Center for Continuing Education. 
Sider, the head of JustLife, a group which supports pro-life political candidates, told stu­dents that a total commitment to all aspects of life is neces­sary for a consistent pro-life et­hic. He said JustLife agrees with Cardinal Joseph Bernar­din, archbishop of Chicago, on the need for a consistent ethic of life. One cannot speak out against abortion and support the nuclear arms race, for this would be contradictory to the pro-life ethic as a whole, Sider said. 
JustLife is based on the Chr­istian belief that "all life is pre­cious" Sider said, adding that life must be whole with God, neighbor and earth. 
This wholeness is the basis for the stand the organization takes, that all pro-life issues are of equal value. Sider said neither the liberals nor the con­servatives are right on the various issues. -He made it clear that consistency is of the utmost importance, and that the true test is "whether or not we have the courage to let the author of life set the agenda for our life." 
JustLife has endorsed 35 can­didates of both parties, includ­ing third Congressional Dis­trict candidate Tom Ward, a Notre Dame graduate, for their opposition to legalized abortion and other issues, Sider said. 
The organization supports neither presidential candidates for the 1988 election.

But it was not clear whether Quayle eliminated the doubts. That may not be known until Americans vote on Nov. 8. 
When Quayle compared his experience to that of John F. Kennedy, it precipitated the sharpest clash of the 90-minute debate. 
"Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine," said Bentsen, looking at his 41-year-old opponent. "Senator you're no Jack Ken­nedy " '

"That was uncalled for, 
senator," retorted Quayle. 

The format helped. All the 
questions were asked by a 
panel of four journalists. The 
candidates had no opportunity

low inflation under the Republicans' guidance, Bentsen referred to record deficits. "If you let me write $200 billion in hot checks every year, I could give you the illu­sion of prosperity, too," he said. 
Bentsen said Quayle had one of the worst voting records in the Senate on veterans' issues, and said his rival had spon­sored legislation to tax the combat pay and disability pay for "people who are lying in the hospital."

Researchers develop contraceptive vaccine 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK --An experi­mental contraceptive vaccine has blocked fertility without fail in female and male guinea pigs, researchers report, raising prospects that a similar approach might one day work for women and men. 
The vaccine is designed to prevent fertilization, which may make it more widely ac­ceptable than another vaccine already in human testing that stops development of the embryo, other scientists said. 
Still, "There are many things about it that would have to be changed or im­proved to make it a useful method for either agricultural animals or humans," cau­tioned researcher Paul Primakoff. 
Primakoff and colleagues at the University of Connec­ticut Health Center in Far­mington report the experi­ment in Thursday's issue of the British journal Nature. 
It is the first demonstration of contraception without fail from a vaccine, experts said. 
None of the 25 female guinea pigs that got the vac­cine before mating had lit­ters, nor did the mates of the six immunized male guinea pigs. Animals that received sham immunizations for com­parison purposes remained fertile. 
The vaccine's effect WqS 

temporary. Eleven of 24 
females tested had regained 
fertility by nine to 11 months 
after the immunization, and 
all four of the longest-studied 
group had delivered litters by 
15 months. Among the males, four of six had regained fer­tility by seven months after the immunization. 
tn a telephone interview, 
Primakoff said his team has 
since produced contraception 
in 17 other male guinea pigs. 
The vaccine is designed to 

make the body's disease­
fighting immune system at­
tack a protein found in guinea 
pig sperm. The details of just 
how that blocks fertility in 
guinea pigs are not known, 
Primakoff said. 
But immune system proteins called antibodies, taken from the immunized females, prevented sperm from binding normally to guinea pig eggs in the test tube. That suggests the vac­cine blocks fertilization within vaccinated females, he said. 
Fred Nelson, a Notre Dame alumnu$ Wi#t a degee in Amer­ican studies who now works for Leo Burnett Advertising, stressed the value of a Liberal Arts degree in looking for a job. "Leo Burnett looks for people who knows how to think, how to communicate and how to relate. My liberal arts back­ground gave me an edge in in­terviewing because I had the ability to communicate and

SANTIAGO, Chile--Military President Augusto Pinochet took an early lead in prelimi­nary returns Wednesday in a plebiscite to decide whether his 15-year rule should be extended to 1997 in a vote which was both massive and peaceful. 
In the Interior Ministry's first announced returns from 79 of the 22,248 voting tables nationwide, "yes" votes for continuing Pinochet's presidency totaled 10,628, while "no" votes totaled 7 ,511.

October 9 
Interior Ministry under sec­retary Alberto Cardemil said 168 votes were blank and 222 ballots were annulled for being wrongly marked. 
The opposition charged that the initial returns were selec­tive and too small a sample. Narciso Irureta, a vice presi­dent of the Christian Demo­cratic Party, said the ministry withheld returns from some tables where "no" votes won a majority in "an intent at fraud that could develop during the night."

The newer poll, an ABC News-Washington Post survey conducted from Sept. 28 through Tuesday, put the race at 51-44 percent with the Republicans in the numerical lead. The poll of 1,196 likely voters had an error margin of about four points. 
In the other survey, a Harris poll conducted last week, the Republicans won support from 49 percent of 1,235likely voters, to 46 percent for the Democrats. It also was a dead 
heat,  given  the  three-point  
margin of err or.  
A  Harris  poll  early  last  

month put the race a bit wider, 
at 50-44 with Bush and Quayle ahead. Similarly, a CBS News­New York Times poll released Tuesday put the race at 48-46, tightened from 49-44 later last month. 
The ABC-Post and Harris polls were released on the night of Quayle's debate with Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the Democratic vice presidential nominee. Like other polls, both found doubts about Quayle's qualifications for office. 
In the ABC-Post poll, 40 per­cent said Quayle was qualified to be vice president, but 33 per­cent said not; the rest didn't know. By contrast, 67 percent said Bentsen was qualified and just 7 percent said not.

good job, but I didn't think it was a good job because I just didn't like the work. What I really wanted to do was work in Yellowstone again, so I managed to get myself a position as a manager trainee there while I was on leave of absence from the accounting firm. I had another great summer and at the end of the season I was offered a job as a manager if I wanted to return the following summer. I did audits and tax returns for one more winter and realized conclusively that I'd had enough of that aggravation, so I went back to Yellowstone and became a hotel manager. 
That was four years ago and I'm still pretty happy with the decision I made. My job and my lifestyle are well out of the mainstream once again and people are always asking me when I'm going to get a real job, as if I just happened into this lifestyle rather than having chosen it. 
Although work and money seem to denominate everything we do these days, I've found that time is my most important asset. I like my job, but it's just my job, not my life. I have other important things to do besides work (I think my excuse in college was "My education doesn't end when I leave the classroom"). I certainly don't work as many hours as my career-oriented friends do, but I think I use my ample free time well. 
Hunter S. Thompson once said, "I wouldn't recommend drugs, alcohol, and violence to anyone, but they've al­ways worked well for me." Similarly, I wouldn't try to proselytize you for a lifestyle like mine. What I will do, though, is to encourage you to have the conviction to march to the drummer you hear no matter how unconventional it might sound. If a career job or grad school is the right choice for you after graduation, then go for it, but don't be limited by those two choices. There is a whole world of possibilities out there for you if you'll just open yourself up to it. Don't get caught up in the jolYgrad school mind set just because those are the safe decisions or because "Mom will be @.. proud." 

At my graduation in May of 1978, Fr. Hesburgh quoted from the Robert Frost poem "The Road Not Taken" in which a traveler chooses the less traveled road rather than the well beaten path. I think Fr. Hesburgh was trying to en­courage us to be creative in our ongoing career development and to consider more of the alternatives available to us. Perhaps he was even trying to ex­press a belief that we graduates had acquired something special during our Notre Dame years that would inspire us to use our talents for more than the pursuit of an upper-middle class life­style. But in any case, I think he wanted us to realize that we could use any num­ber of strategies, including unconven­tional ones, to fulfill our career and life­style aspirations.

Peace and Justice group to meet tonite 
Dear Editor: 
We have joined together to educate ourselves and others in order to grow in the power of our common humanity, to lead us to an understanding of our responsibilities in the world today and to the action we must take accordingly. This is the statement of purpose for a group of students on campus concerned with social justice: Women United for Justice and Peace. Peace and justice are universal issues not limited by sex, race or nationality. Our name reflects a special interest in how these issues affect our lives through a female's per­spective. In no way is our name meant to imply a discriminatory bias. 

A major goal of our community is to disseminate information throughout the student body. Awareness is the first step to solving any problem. We at­tempt to positively approach all vital issues through informed discussion and creative action in affirmation of the belief that together we can make a dif­ference for peace and justice. Women United for Peace and Justice will hold a meeting tonight, Oct. 6, at 7 p.m. at the CSC Coffeehouse. We welcome and encourage all women and men on this campus to attend the meeting to take a step toward fulfilling our obligation as peacemakers and proponents of so­cial justice.

Johnson rebuttal 
RICHARD THORNBURGH accent writer 
Jimmy Johnson University of Miami Miami, Florida 
To the Notre Dame Student Body: 
All right, listen up. You people been gettin' on my case lately, and its startin' to make my ulcers bubble. The doc says I won't be able to eat any more oranges unless you people lay off, so let's set the record straight on a few things. 
First of all, I don't appreciate the hate calls. Ain't nothing that ticks me off more than bein' interrupted from scoring up a few lines for a high school prospect just to hear one of you smart-alecs tellin' me that you hate me now. Heck, I don't care if you hate me now or hate me later as long as you hate me. I wouldn't know what to do if everyone outside Miami didn't hate me. 
There also seems to be a little misconception about the difficulty of our football schedule. I don't care what folks say, we play some of the toughest competitors in college football week in and week out with no relief. We have to face teams like Northwest Mississippi State at Jackson (NMSJ) and Landrum College that force us to play the game of our life every week. Who does Notre Dame have to play that's any good? Pittsburgh, Penn State, USC? Gimme a break. 
Another thing you intellectual snobs like to poke at is our academic program. Now, we may not have any Rhodes scholars, but I'll have you know that we have the nation's leading programs in intramural bowling, gator wrestling, drug running, and sports car appreciation. How 'bout that, huh? So let's have a little respect where respect is due. 
And about those T-shirts .... You kids have been goin' hog wild printing every possible slur about me and our fine school, and I'm not going to take it any more! First of all, there's plenty of other words you could spell with the Miami "U" besides "scUm." How about "vUlgar" or "crUde" or better yet, "pitifUl"? And then there's that shirt that implies part of my anatomy is missing. Well, it's just not true! I lease with an option to own. 
Sincerely, Jimmy "Yes I do" Johnson 
CHRIS WELSH accent writer 
In this election year, voters are confronted with a choice between a passionless tech­nocrat and an heir to our na­tion's best cheerleader. This difference in leadership styles is also at the heart of the current Notre Dame-St. Mary's Theatre production of "Antigone." 
Adapted by Lewis Galan­tiere from Jean Anouilh's play, it focuses on the deci­sion of Antigone to disobey an edict issued by her uncle, King Creon, forbidding the burial of her brother, in order to consolidate power and sta­bilize his troubled kingdom of Thebes. Antigone, however cannot abide by her uncle's command, and is motivated by her conscience to give her brother the proper religious burial he deserves. This leads to the central conflict of the play, as Creon persuades An­tigone to abandon her moral crusade, and obey his order. If she refuses, he will be forced to kill her for state reasons. 
The exciting debate that follows between these two main characters contrasts two opposing views concern­ing governing a nation. Creon argues that a king should lead a nation with his mind, and to the letter of the law. Antigone insists that every­one, especially a leader, should follow his heart and be true to the emotions in it. 

The acting by the cast was both professional and sincere, evoking emotions and spark­ing contemplation of the themes previously discussed. The lead performance as given by Kristen Schumacher was especially effective in conveying the conviction of her character, as well as the beauty of her fate. Mark J. Costanzi' s Creon exuded a nobility and assurance which was appropriate, emotionally charged, but not overdone. 
The supporting characters are all portrayed with equally effective drive and intensity. Siiri Scott's one-woman Greek Chorus calls for special atten­tion as her portrayal ranks as one of the most memorable narration performances I have seen. Also worthy of recognition are Bridget McCarthy's Nurse, who receives my "Neil Simon Jewish Mother" award for her wonderful comic relief;

Gerald Welch's Haemon, who maintains the proper balance between handsome prince and good-natured boyfriend; Mi­chael Murphy's Private Jones who also dabbles successfully in a comic vein; and Emily Stoddart who steals the show as Creon's page, managing to follow the king without get­ting lost in his shadow. 
The staging and direction of the play were all quite natu­ral, managing to augment the actors' performances without interfering with the audi­ence's enjoyment of the dialogue. The costumer and set decorator should also be congratulated for construct­ing a visually appealling at­mosphere in which the actors can practice their craft. In fact, many commented that the costumes must have been borrowed from "Star Trek," which is perfect for a play that contains many anachronistic touches due to its many revisions since Sop­bode's original. 
On the whole, I must con­cur with Creon who at one point remarks, "It's hard to say yes, but it is the best an­swer."

SMC VB WinS 
By LIZ VANDERSARL Sports Writer 
Recovering from a brief slump, the Saint Mary's Belles got back on the win­ning track Tuesday night with a win over Grace Col­lege. 
''The last three weeks have been difficult with several injuries, so this win was a rebound for us," said Head Coach Sue Medley. 
The Belles were strong throughout the match, dominating the first game 15-4. The second game proved to be a struggle with Grace College getting the edge 17-15. With consistent serving, the Belles were able to display their superiority, winning the final games 15-1 and 15-1. 
"Serving has always been a problem for us, but we im­proved a great deal in the match. Key players through­out the match were Katie Killilla and Melissa Phillips, who both played extremely well," said Medley. 
Saturday at 1:00 p.m., the Belles take on Tri-State in a league match.

Holtz makes plea 
Dear Students: 

As you probably know, Notre Dame will play host to the University of Miami football team on October 15. I under­stand Miami coach Jimmy Johnson has been the recipient of several phone calls and letters from Notre Dame stu­dents regarding the upcoming football game. 
When I first came to Notre Dame, I was impressed with four things about the student body--its competitiveness, its intelligence, its intense desire to succeed and its close­ness and caring for other people. I would hope our students display those same traits when it comes to football rivalries. 
I'm the first one to appreciate the competitiveness and the intense desire of the Notre Dame students to succeed. I hope you appreciate those same traits in our football players on the field every week. 
Yet, it seems to me if we want to display our intelligence, we ought to show a great deal of respect to Miami, its players and coaches for the tremendous accomplishments they've had for the last two years. As you know, Miami has won 36 straight regular-season football games and 20 straight road games overall. That's an amazing record that few teams in college football history can match. 
It also seems that if our students wish to display their closeness as a student body and how much they care for their football team, the most valuable thing they can do is be as positive as possible in their support of this team. That should be the case not just this week against Pit­tsburgh, or next week when Miami comes to town--but every week of the season. 
We look forward to welcoming Miami's team and fans for our next home game. Let's make sure that the Hur­ricanes leave our campus impressed with the classiness of our program and fans. 
Best regards, 
Lou Holtz

Cone in Game 2. Belcher, who won nine of his last 11 decisions to finish 12-6, had his only prob­lems against Keith Hernandez. The Mets first-baseman hit a two-run homer in the fourth and finished Belcher with a run-scoring single in the ninth. 
Belcher, who struck out a season-high 10 batters, allowed a leadoff double by Len Dykstra in the ninth. Dykstra went to third on a grounder, and scored on a single by Her­nandez. 
Belcher was replaced by former Met Jesse Orosco, who yielded a single to Darryl Strawberry that advanced Her-' nandez to second. 
That brought on Alejandro Pena, who got the save by get­ting Kevin McReynolds to foul out to third and, after walking Howard Johnson to load the bases, induced Gary Carter to fly out to right.

A healthy Banks means a complete backfield 
Notre Dame's backfield rushed for 321 yards in a 52-7 rout of Purdue two weeks ago and 341 yards in crushing Stanford 42-14 last Saturday night. 
And that was when the backfield was plagued by a series of injuries to key players. 
Saturday afternoon against Pittsburgh the Irish will have all of their backs in the lineup and the results could be even more impressive than in recent games. 
Junior fullback Braxston Banks, who started the first two games, will be back after missing the last two contests with torn knee ligaments. Banks in­jured his knee in the first series against Michigan State. Banks has been in action all week, playing a majority of the practice plays in an effort to get back in the flow of the Irish offense. 
"It's been tight and sore," Banks said after Wed­nesday~s practice. "A lot of it is getting back into things. I'm going to approach it with a hands-on attitude and give it all I can give it.'' 
Banks suffered a partially torn knee ligament in last year's opener at Michigan and missed games against Michigan State and Purdue. He bounced 
back to gain 212 yards on 54 carries and four touch­
downs. His high game was 59 yards on 11 carries 
against USC. 
In this young season, Banks has carried four 
times for 13 yards. Ironically, Banks went down at 
Michigan State on artificial turf and the Irish will 
Greg Guffey 
Football Notebook 

play on turf again at Pittsburgh Saturday. 
"If I was on the grass, it would make it a little better," Banks said. "I'd rather play my first game on grass, but I can't do much about it." 
Fullback Anthony Johnson also went down in East Lansing with a sprained ankle. He missed the Purdue game and carried 14 times for 61 yards and a touchdown against Stanford. Johnson should be near full strength against the Panthers. 

With Johnson and Banks back at tailback, Tony Brooks can return to the tailback spot behind Mark Green. Brooks rushed for 110 yards versus the Boilermakers and 59 against the Cardinal. Green has been consistent, gaining 293 yards in the four Irish victories. 
The Panthers have been inconsistent against the rush. Pittsburgh surrendered only 71 and 91 yards on the ground in victories over Northern Iowa and Ohio State, but gave up 261 and 124 rushing yards in losses to West Virginia and Boston College. Notre Dame ran for 464 yards against Pittsburgh in 1971, the most ever allowed by the Panthers. 
With all four top backs in the lineup, Notre Dame could pose problems to the Pittsburgh defense. If all four regain full strength, the Irish could domi­nate opposing defenses even more. 
"There's no telling where we could go," Banks said. "We were voted the No. 1 backfield in the nation during the summer. I can't see anything that can stop a healthy backfield. That goes for any team in the country, not just ourselves."
