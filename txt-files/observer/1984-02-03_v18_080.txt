The trend, which one U.S. official attributes to "spine­stiffening" on the part of many governments faced with a surge in Soviet intelligence activity, apparently is continuing. On Wednes­day, the government of Norway, reacting to the arrest of an alleged Soviet agent working inside the Norwegian foreign ministry, ex­pelkd five Soviet diplomats and barred the Soviet embassy from rt·placing them. In addition, four other Soviet diplomats previously stationed in Norway were forbidden to return to the country.

A United States Death Star? 


President Reagan has suddenly decided that he favors 
an increased use of outer space. In last week's State of 
the Union address, he called for the building of a 
permanently-manned space station. Supposedly, this 
would bolster the American morale and have all kinds 
ofwonderful technological benefits for mankind. 
This is the same president who has cut offfunding for 
most NASA programs, including a proposed rendezvous 
with Halley's Comet and all future unmanned deep­
space probes. Indeed, the Space Shuttle was only com­
pleted because the military had uses for it. 
So would Reagan have requested funding for a new space project if he did not envision military uses for it? Although the Pentagon claims that it has no use for a space station, it is easy to discover a use for the technol­ogy that would be needed to build one. 
In his now-famous "Star Wars speech" last year, Reagan proposed the building of a space-based, anti­ballistic missile system. This program included laser platforms in orbit which would shoot down enemy missiles in flight. Supposed-o ly, this will "change the course of human history" by "making nuclear weapons impotent and obsolete." 
The proposed program is, of course, far beyond exist­ing technology. It could be developed, however, with­out raising a public outcry against another new weapons system, by supporting the kind of in­vestment Tn space that stirred the hearts of the American people in the 60s. 
Investment in space is the 
goal of one campus group, 
the L-5 Society. Even its 

members oppose Reagan's ABM plan because they are 
against the use or placement of nuclear weapons in 
space, although one member privately admits that they 
will accept it if there is no other way to provoke govern­
ment interest in space. 

It is.a mistake, however, to support an ABM system 
for any reason. If the goal is to develop space for in­
dustry, medicine and raw science, then it should be 
done for that purpose alone. But the use of space for a 
new arms race is a grave mistake. 

The Bishops' Letter on War and Peace stated that the 
theory of deterrence was not morally acceptable, but that it was tolerable as long as concerted efforts are ·being made to reduce nuclear weapons. An ABM 
strategy is not tolerable. 

For an ABM system to have any value, it would have 
to be 100 percent effective. It would be stupid to rely 
on a system which knocks down nine-tenths of the 
incoming missiles when the remainder could destroy

your country anyway. Stupid and costly. 
Many experts believe that initiating an ABM system would increase, ratht·r than decrease the chances of war, since the Soviets would respond by buildingone of their own. As soon as one side thought its defenses were invulnerable, it seems possible that they might black­mail the other. 
On the rose-colored paper the plan is written on, this would not happen since the side with invulnerable defenses would dismantle its weapons and enter a gold­en, post-nuclear Camelot. It is more likely that as soon as ABM systems go into use, 0 0 Anti-ABM and Anti-AABM systems will he n~eded. As long as these so-called defensive system~ can be neutralized, everyone will

moving military installations on the ground. 

The only worthwhile argument for the creation of an ABM system would be that it could be used to knock down an accidental missile launch. For this purpose, only a very primitive system -such as the one now allowed by treaty ­would he needed. There would be no need for orbiting battle stations to knock down a single errant missile. 
The technological benefits of developing space are certain. It is pleasant to see that the nation's leaders are beginning to remember that. But the costs ofdevelop­ing space through the military are too high, and not in dollars. Placing weapons in space would move the doomsday clock even closer to midnight.

Saint Mary's Around the World Program, which last year allowed students to travel in Europe and Asia and meet Indian Prime Minister In· dira Gandhi, begins its second semester this fall. 
The program, which runs each fall semester, last fall sent its pioneer, History Professor Cyriac Pullapilly and nine studcnts to India, China, the Soviet Union,Japan and Europe. 
While Pullapilly admits thc program is still on an experimental basis and there were "major problems," hc maintained that everyone secmed happy with the program. 
Students take 16 crcdits at Stella Maris College in Madras, India. As part of their curriculum, students take many ficld trips, including a Hindu wedding. 
"The girls had to accomplish one semester's work in 9 weeks as opposed to 15 weeks here at St. Mary's and Notre Dame," Pullapilly said, discussing the difficulty of the program. "Therefore, thc cla.'ises 
werc much more rigorous and dis­ciplined." 
l11e students met privately with 

Mrs. Gandhi for two hours and were 
impressed with hcr opcnness to 
questioning and the overall honor Of 
the occasion. 
Saint Mary's Beth Walsh, who 

went on the trip last year, says that 
thc "difference in culture and ap­
proach to life between Asia and the 
Western world" impressed hcr thc 
most. Her only regrct concerning 
thc trip was that "there just wasn't 
enough time in some places we 
visited to sec everything." 
The cost for the excursion is the Saint Mary's fcc for tuition and board plus S2, 500. All Saint Mary's and Notre Dame women are eligible. This ycar Pullapilly hopes to takc at least 20 women. 
As of now, Pullapilly is not aut­horized to take men on the trip, though the notion is still under con­sideration by the College's Board of Directors. Thc application deadline has been extended from Feb. it 5 to Feb. 29 because of the student's need for consideration time, Pulapil­ly said. Applications arc available at Pullapilly's office in room 336 of Madeleva Hall.

Bell curves not the best way to grade

I would like to see Lee Iacocca. I heard rumors of him being invited and I think his success-oriented business spirit would be a great boost to the outgoing seniors.

the curve, not because ofa poor grade. Words such as discrimination, prejudice and defama­tion of character were scattered throughout the article, but the real issue is the fairness ofa "hell curve." 
I have spent five years at Notre Dame split­ting my time between the College of Engineering and the College of Arts and Let­ters and_ have felt the mighty hand of both the "bell curve" and traditional grading methods. 
. The d,ifference the grading system makes is stagger\pg. Attitudes toward grades and per­formanqe seem completely different in the two colleges and the "btell curve" probably is the source ofthe difference. 
Students in both colleges have a guessing­game approach to work. In Arts and Letters, the object ofthe game is figuring out, or guess­ing, what the professor expects and wants from the students. Many students write bril­liant essays but receive lower grades because the professor disagrees with the opinion of the paper. 
Similarly, other professors worry less about opinions and more about clarity, writing style and all the other things taught in freshmen writing. 
Guessing also invades the work ofengineer­ing students. Theirs, however, has more to do with the other students than with the profes­sor. "Beat the average and you'll do fine" is the general philosophy of most engineering stu­dents. So if the student can guess the quantity of knowledge of other studen-ts, he can get a higher grade. 
The biggest fault with the bell curve is that students tend to work because ofcompetition with other students, not for the betterment of themselves. Is competition really the purpose of grades? Are grades made to separate the smart students from those of lesser intel­ligence, or should they test a student's com­prehension ofclass material? 
The bell curve was originally intended to 
help students receive a fair test, but the basic 
ideal of the curve has been lost. For example, 
on one test a grade of4 5 percent received a B, 
but the curve came out even. If the average 
student only knew 45 percent ofthe material, 
either the test was unfair or nobody learned 
anything in the class. 

The professor had made the test, difficult be­cause the previous test in the class had produced an unrven curve weighted to the high side. 
Obviously there is a problem with this philosophy. If a student knows the material, shouldn't that be enough justification for a good grade? Or is it necessary to know the material better than the student sitting in the next seat? 
Ifgrades are meant to separate students, as some believe, then the bell curve works to perfection. Not all professors use a strict bell curve, but instead weigh the curve slightly to the higher side. However, even a weighted curve doesn't solve all the problems. 
Anew proi:Hem with the curve has grown
. 

out of the increasing size of the Engineering College. More and more professors are tur­. ning to multiple-choice tests to handle the heavy grading load. A curved grading system 
and multiple-choice tests just don't mix.. 
If two students answer the same number of 
questions correctly but each guess on four· or 
five other questions (a natural result of mul­
tiple choice tests) then the best guesser not 
only helps his grade but lowers the other stu­
dents mark. 

Guessing for a good grade is fine, students 
have be~n doing it for decades. But to receive 
a lower grade because other students got 
lucky on their guesses is unfair. 
The system has a few benefits. It prevents 
grade inflation -something most students 
wouldn't mind seeing. But the University 
must prevent it to keep a go-od academic 
reputation. The curve can help students who 
are given an unfair test, though fixing the test 
is a better solution than fixing the grades. 
In the end, the bell curve tends to em­
phasize grades more than material, competi­
tion more than learning. A law suit may not be 
a solution but a close examination ofgrading 
policy certainly couldn't hurt. 
Mrs. Goodman 
DearEditor: 
Congratulations to Richard Cohen on notic­ing that Mrs. Goodman was white. That ob­vious fact escaped the attention of the news reels before her husband gained his freedom. 
The question I wish Cohen had asked was why Mrs. Goodman was not shown on televi­sion before her husband's release? And why haven't any editorialists or reporters in major newspapers noted this obvious question other than Cohen? 
Unfortunately, I suggest the reason Mrs. Goodman was ignored before her husband's release is because public support for Good­man and the Jackson "mission" would have plummeted if it were known that Mrs. Good­man is white. 
Someone, perhaps the news media, with the interest of Lt. Goodman at heart, may have advised the family to keep Mrs. Goodman off the air and substitute the lieutenant's sister and parents on news shows before Goodman's release. 
Recognizing the fact of life that interracial marriages do not foster sympathy among many persons in any race, one cannot fault the media for protecting the Goodman's interest. However, why have they not admitted this ruse since Goodman's release? It is an issue that merits discussion.

Irish map? 

Dear Editor: 
We wish to draw your attention to an error in the Jan. 31 Observer. We refer to the Sweepstakes sponsored by General Foods In­ternational Coffee. Map I on the entry form is, we believe, meant to represent Ireland. This we concluded through a process of elimina­tion. However, being Irish, we are angered by the exclusion ofsix ofthe northern counties! 
Geographically, Ireland is the larger of the two islands which make up the British Isles. No political boundaries are recognised on that island by the great majority ofits people or by the Constitution of the Republic of Ireland. 
We would therefore be grateful if you could communicate this to those responsible for the organization and judging of this contest. We are anxious to submit the "four" correct answers. 
Hugh McManus Peter Flanagan 
Theo department 
DearEditor: 

Your recent front-page article on the Theol­ogy Department may have conveyed the im­pression to the less well informed that until three years ago the department was languish­ing in medieval squalor, generally thought to be much worse than our modem squalor. 
This impression is not only false but unfair to the accomplishments of previous ad­ministrators who, in spite of very limited resources (compared to those now available), helped to build a department which has come to enjoy a large measure of esteem in the academic community. 
And since recruiting was specifically men­tioned,it should also be pointed out that it has remained at about the same level over the last three years as over the previous decade in spite ofgreatly increased resources. 
Because of its size and complexity the theology department has special needs which call for vigorous advocacy. The acknowledge­ment of this situation does·not, however, re­quire us to forget or, worse, misrepresent the accomplishments of the past, even the quite recent past.

Showcase 
Billy Joel's m

L
ast night's crowd at the ACC was hungry for a concert event. Ap­parently, Loverboy's recent visit and Rick Springfield's show last year didn't satisfy anyone's appetite be­cause when BillyJoel took the stage, the place erupted. Joel responded admirably, hy delivering a stellar performance. 
Joel began with a flawless rendi­tion of"Angry Young Man." And even though this title doesn't fit him anymore, he sang it quite convinc­ingly as he sat at his familiar grand piano. "My Life" and "The Stranger" followed, each being identical to the recorded version and receiving strong applause. After "The Stran­ger" he seemed at perfect ease as he joked with the audience about t.he acoustics and the unfortunate people sitting behind the stage. IIis version of the Notre Dame Victory March surely didn't hurt his rapport with the fans either. 
Modestly introduced as "a song from 1973," "Piano Man" followed. "Just The Way You Are" and Clearly a crowd favorite, it moved "Innocent Man" came soon after. the exuberant fans in floor seating to Like "Piano Man" both were power­a swaying mass, and proved that a ful renditions that equaled the song doesn't have to lose any ofits studio versions. Then came emotional impact even after 1 l "Stiletto" and the excitement esc­years. Two songs later, those on the alated. Its catchy intro and rock edge floor again led an eruption as the blended perfectly into the follow­band played a sparkling version of ups "Just a Fanta.~y" and "It'sJust "Allentown," complete with grunts Rock-n-Roll To Me."

Nostalgia 

great television program. The kids liked it; for adults, it was mindless entertainment belonging to the cultural wasteland_ One watched it if he was too lazy to change the dial. Now "Beaver" comes on the At­lanta station, and it feels like I'm back home with old friends. "Beaver" is a representative ofthe world as it was before Lee Harvey Oswald fired his bullets in Dallas, changing history into a nightmare ofdomestic violence. Purgatory could consist in watching back-to-. back re-runs of"Harriet and Ozzie." When you're stuck in the Holiday Inn without a book, "Harriet annd Ozzie" are as welcome as huckleberries after "Dallas" and "Soap". 
For a decadt: or two now, I have noticed that the young have ap­propriated the cultural heroes ofmy generation as their own; there are Humphrey Bogart festivals at the Brattle Street theater in Cambridge. Nostalgia is a game that any two can play. Maybe in five years I will be collecting the albums of David Bowie or the Three Dog Night, though I have no plans. Pop culture has a f.lllout like a hydrogen bomb, and the o!dest and the youngest get exposed in surprising ways. I still think Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire lived a more gracious lifestyle in "Top Hat." I thought so as a school boy in the Thirties. I thought so when the Beatlesfirst sang, "I Want to Hold Your Hand." I thought so when Simon and Garfunkel were lyrical about Mrs. Robinson and Joe DiMaggio. I knew so whenJanisJoplin lamented over "Me and Bobby Magee." "Top Hat" made me want to dance. The others, catching me by surprise, bring tears. Sadness can be a rewarding emotion. 
Life isn't just heautiful in the lost childhood, before you took a job with the corporation. You realize that when you are watching"E.T." in perfect contentment, as happy as when you first saw "Snow White And the Seven Dwarfs" in the year it came out. 
Nostalgia can leave you stuck in a time warp. unless you keep ad­ding to it all the time. I felt choked up at dinner last week in the North Dining Hall. remembering friends I used to meet there_ Maybe it's a signal of how great the Notre Dame years have been. I keep gathering daily rosehuds to take with me. I hope to make them im­mortal as part ofthe soul! go with to heaven. Ifeternity is an endless liturgy performed to the music of the St. LouisJes~its, I'll need my memories oftht· voices ofJo Stafford and Nat King Cole to keep me from getting restless .

"Big Shot" immediately followed, giving thousands a chance to stop drooling and pick up their jaws off the floor, but the excitement never waned. Ifanything, it intensified as the band trotted offfor intermission. And whenJoel returned for the first encore, "Tell Her About It," the noise was incredible. Once again, it was a flawless live version. "You May Be Right" was the next encore, and a perfect show-stopper.

mitted that this could change next 
week. 

Joel did not play either ofthese personal preferences last night. But he did play many ofhis songs that had dominated the charts when they were first released; he played what the people wanted to hear. This only reemphasizesJoel as "the enter­tainer" that he is. ButJoel said he is not tied to his careeras a piano man. In 1982,Rolling Stone magazine quotedJoel as saying that he would like a daughter who would think he was everything and a son with whom he could go fishing. But he only wants this family ifhe can spend time with it. The singer em­phasized that he would never stop writing music, but that he would change his touring schedule ifa family were involved. After all, "Touring is a young man's job. It was a lot easier at 19 than 34. Believe me, I know ..." 
Not that the question ofthe pos­sibility ofa family directly triggered the thought ofChristie Brinkley, but before excusing himselffor dinner Joel did mention that it was her birthday and with a genuine excite­ment explained, "We're going to try to get her out on the stage. She flew out just for this." Yesterday after­noonJoel said that his uptown girl did not want to make an appearance on stage, that she didn't want to be like Linda McCartney. Nevertheless, much to the thrill ofthe crowd, the cover girl did appear. 
Touring and performing might be becoming more difficult for Joel, but this was not apparent to last night's audience as they watchedJoel's fin­gers fly across the keyboard until they were sore, and bound across the stage often juggling a microphone or leapingfrom speaker to stage. PerhapsJoel's casual down­to-earth nature can best be under­stood by experiencing his natural rapport with an audience and ir­repressible energy in concert. 
BillyJoel may ask, "What's the big deal?" Well, the big deal is that there is no big deal. It is just an innocent man creating a carnival with his piano, just the way he is.

ne might think that with more than six albums under his belt and five Grammys to his credit, Billy Joel would be like the big shot about whom he sang in last night'sconcert. But this Long Island man does not understand why people want to 
know so much about him. "What's the big deal?'' he asks. 
Despite his fame, Joel is still a backstreet boy. When asked to describe himself, his first response was, "hungry." The singer/songwriter had just finished checking the sound in the ACC which he called "a boom boom room" and wanted to get some din­ner before the concert. But serious­ly, "I don't really think in terms of me." 
Neither does he think in terms of his future or that ofhis music. He can never conceive ofthe direction his next songwriting venture will take. In the past, each album has possessed its own character; into each vinyl disk is pressed a theme. Joel does not know what inspires these themes, nor does he want to know. He is worried that ifhe thinks too much about where the songs are coming from they will not flow naturally. The albums are "sort of like little Broadway shows." Once they get started and the momentum builds, the songs just carry the al­bum through until it is a united whole. 
Ofall ofhis albums,Joel is most satisfied with TheNylon Curtain. The performer attributed its fulfill­ing qualities in part to the fact that it took over a year to produce. On the otherhand,AnlnnocentMan "went so quick and was so easy." 
It appeared that last night's audience would not have letJoel leave the ACC without singing "Only the Good Die Young" from his Stranger album. Other favorites of the crowd seemed to be "Piano Man," the title cut offhis first album, and "Stiletto," from the52nd Street album. The artist himselfcannot claim favorites. "They're like my kids. One day I'm more proud ofone than another, but I don't have favorites." Joeldid say that he prefers "Vienna," from The Stranger and "She's Right on Time," offofThe Nylon Curtain. However, he ad­

The I0-7 Spartans should present a tough challenge for the Irish front­line players because most of their scoring punch comes from inside players. Freshman Kris Emerson leads the offense with her I4.8 scoring average. The 5-li forward also leads the team in rebounding, averaging 9.4 rebounds per game. She will receive a lot of help from 6-.3 sophomore center Mary Kay McNall, last week's Big Ten player of the week. She received the award by scoring 48 points and pulling down 25 rebounds in two games.

At ACC tomorrow 
Irish host track championships 

ByJERRY MELIA 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame track team will play host to the Midwestern City Conference Championships at 1 
p.m. tomorrow. The Irish are looking forward to defending the title they won last year in their initial MCCseason. 
Coach joe Piane is very pleased with his team and is confident they will do well in this weekend's meet. A victory in this meet would be of the kind that could not be ex­perienced by most other teams at Notre Dame. This is because track is one of the few sports to be compet­ing in a conference. Almost all other Notre Dame sportscompete as an in­dependent. 
Piane has been preparing for the meet this week after a rather busy three days last weekend which saw Notre Dame athletes compete in thr t ee different cities. 
The only runners not expected to be involved in the championships are sprinter Van Pearcy and middle distance runner Jim Tyler, both be­cause ofinjuries. 
In talking about the competition 

the Irish wi ll encounter this weekend, Piane says, "I expect a fight from Oral Roberts. They are much stronger overall. Some of the other schools have a few good ath­letes in certain areas, but Oral Roberts will present the biggest challenge." 
To win the title they won last year, the Irish must accomplish three things: score points in the sprints, negate the power of Oral Roberts in the middle distance and distance events, and get solid performances in the jumping events. 
Although the middle distance and distance events are one of the Irish strong points, Piane feels that Oral Roberts will be especially tough in these areas because it had a fine cross country season. 
Among those who Piane will be 
counting on to continue to do well 
in this weekend's meet are Alvin Mil­
ler, Greg Bell, Dan Shannon, and 
Mitch Van Eyken in the sprints, and James Patterson in the high jump, long jump, and triple jump. 
Piane also will be relying on strong performances from Tim Can­non, Ralph Caron, and Marc Woz­niak in the distance events. 
The two-mile relay team, which competed in the Millrose Games in New York's Madison Square Garden last weekend, consists of John McNelis, Jim Moyar, Van Eyken, and JelfVan Wie. 
Fine performances should be ex­pected again from Shannon, McNelis, and Moyar in the middle distances; Chuck Lanza in the shot­put; and John Langdon in the pole vault. 
Commenting about the past, Piane felt that last weekend es­tablished some much needed con­fidence. About the future, Piane says, "Once we get everyone healthy and in shape, we're going to be a force to contend with." 
Mullins 
continued from page 12 
The Notre Dame women's basket­ball program has also benefited from her hard work and DiStanislao can only be happy with what her scrap­py, intense captain has added to the team. 
"We will miss Theresa Mullins when she graduates because there is no one else who seems to have that same gritty 'all-for-one, one-for-all' attitude," says DiStanislao. "She's not afraid to push her teammates. She is a blue-collar player who's not afraid ofhard work. 
"Theresa Mullins can stay in my 
program as long as she wants." 
One day soon, there may be no walk-ons on DiStanislao's te;tm, but the shouts of encouragement from the far end ofthe bench will definite­ly be missed.

Another key to success, besides attitude, is having all players available for duty. And for the first time in two weeks, everyone is ex­pected to be rctady. All suspensions have been served and the wounded have been patched. Gary Becker and Dave Waldbillig still may be nursing shoulder injuries, but will be able to play.

Face Berea College tonight 
Saint Mary's falls to Goshen~ 69-62 
By DAVE WILSON 
!)ports Writer 
According to Saint Mary's head coach Mike Rouse, the rea~on his hasketball team suffered a 69-62 loss at the hands ofGoshen College Wed­nesday night was not only a lack of height, hut also team depth. It was a tough defeat for the Belles, who were coming off a strong victory over Michigan-Dearborn in their own Roundball Classic lao;t weekend. 
"We had very little offensive rebounding," retlected Rouse on the performance. "They played an okay game tonight, but I was happy ahout their ahility to come back after drop­ping hehind." 
The team was without the services of starting guard Mary McQuillan, who is out temporarily with the flu. Rouse then turned to his sixth player, Teresa McGinnis, to fill the gap. Unfortunately, without McQuillan, the Belles were without the speed that usually makes up for their lack ofheight. 
"Without Mary (McQuillan), we 

couldn't run our press game like we 
usually do at the start," said Rouse. 
"Instead, it was just a matter of the 
shots falling when we needed 
them." 
At the beginning, Saint Mary's ap­peared to want to make up for its losses. The Belles jumped out to a 12-6 lead and were able to hold off, the opposition until, with eight  minutes remaining in the half, Gos­hen went ahead by one at 22-21. Af­ter twenty minutes, Goshen had further extended the margin and led by nine at halftime, 36-27. 
"When Betsy (Ebert) ran into foul trouble early, I think we began to lose our momentum," commented Rouse. 
Ebert, the Belles' center and leading rebounder, picked up three foul~. in the early going and Rouse

was forced to bench her until later in the game. Without her height, Saint Mary's was vulnerable to inside shooting and offensive rehounding by the opponent. 
Goshen maintained its com­fortable lead for most of the second half, and, after ten minutes, ad­vanced that lead to ten at S4-44. However, the Bcllt-s fought back he­hind good shooting from Cyndy Short, who had 19 points in the game, and K.ris Pantelleria, who chipped in 14. 
With three minutes to go, the Belles lost Ehert to five fouls, but a pair of free thows by Elaine Suess brought Saint Mary's to within four at '\9-SS. Suess supported the effort by scoring I I points and dishing out 7 assists. This surge was as close as the home squad would get,

Irish hockey team set to face Marquette 
By ED DOMANSKY 
Sports Writer 
MILWAUKI:E -With the hope for an undefeated sea.<;<m now just a memory, the Notre Dame hockey team is looking to at least maintain its unblemisht·d mark in the Central States Collegiate Hockey League. The Irish will put their perfect I 1-0­0 record on the line as they take on last sea.<;<m's CSCIII. champions, the Marqut·tte Warriors, Friday and Saturday. 
The wn·kend calendar features a homt·-and-home series which gets undt·rway tonight in Milwaukee. The two teams then return to the ACC for a 7:30 p.m. contest tomor­row. 
Marquette comes into the series with an I 1-3-0 mark in CSCHL play and stands 13-5-0 through its entire schedule. 
Tht· Warriors return most of their 
· key playt.·rs from the squad that came away with both the regular season and post-sea.<;<m titles a year ago. 
Dan O'Grady and Rich Carroll lead the team in scoring. They also stand first and _third, respectively, in the CSCHL scoring race. 
The Irish are coming off a sweep against league foe Iowa State la.'it weekend. Hut more importantly, the team has gained some crucial knowledge a.o; a result ofthe season's first loss a week-and-a-half ago at Lake Forest. 
"The loss led them to the realiza­tion that tht.·y are not invincible," said head coach lxfty Smith. "They know now that they must always play to their utmost capabilities." 
Notre Dame co-captain Brent 
Chapman feels that the loss was probably a good thing. 
"It brings yqu hack down to earth and makes yo~ realize that you can be beaten," he says. "Now we know that we have to go back and work

The Gamecocks probably will play a match-up zone against the Irish tomorrow. They also will likely try to get into a transition game, which is one of their strengths. 
The Irish, 14-5, will be trying to extend their win streak to eight games tomorrow as they also at­tempt to give Phelps his 250th win at Notre Dame. 
lxading the Irish attack will be captain Tom Sluby, who is now averaging 16.5 points per game from his swingman position. 
Notre Dame's front line will con­sst ofTim Kempton,Jim Dolan, and Ken Barlow, who has shot an in­credible 13 of I 5 from the floor and 12 of 14 from the line in his last two games 
The Irish point guard will be JoJo Buchanan, while Joseph Price and Joe Howard should be the first Notre Dame players offthe hench_ 
The game will be played on a tar­tan floor in front ofa capacity crowd at the Carolina Coliseum and the victory-starved Gamecock fans should make things difficult for the Irish, according to Phelps. 
"You just can't have a letdown be­cause they're losing and think they're not going to be ready to play you. It's a very tough place to play." 

Irish captain 
Theresa Mullins leads from bench 
By MIKE SULLIVAN 
SportsEditor 
It was not long ago that women's basketball was played by teams com­prised entirely ofwalk-ons. 
In basketball of the 1980's, this statement would almost seem a con­tradiction of terms. After all, aren't "walk-ons" those players who sit at the end ofthe bench and see action only in the final minute ofblowouts? With the large number of scholar­ship players in the game today, the term "walk-on" has taken on a negative connotation. 
However, the walk-on of today was the starter ofyesterday. She was a good high school player who decided that it would be fun to con­tinue playing into her college days. 
Volleyball program to be upgraded 
Associated Press 
SOUTH BEND, Ind. -Athletic officials at Notre Dame an­nounced yesterday they were expanding their women's vol­leyball program with an eye on developing a national caliber team. 
"We're trying to tell people we want to go big time in volleyball," said John Heisler, Notre Dame's associate sports information director. 
Toward that goal, the Fighting Irish have hired former Stanford coach Art Lambert to head the revamped program. 
"We've talked to volleyball people all around the country, and we're now prepared to do the kind ofthings that will enable us to compete with the top teams in the country," said Notre Dame Athletic DirectorGene Corrigan. 
"We wanted a second women's sport in addition to bas­ketball in which we could try to attain national recognition. We think we're in an outstanding area for volleybalL Anyone who follows volleyball locally kr!ows the quality of competition in South Bend. We're making a serious commitment. We'll be offering the NCAA maximum in scholarships which is 12," Cor­rigan added. 
Lambert, 48, a graduate of San Jose State, started out as water polo coach and coached the U.S. Olympic water polo team to a fifth place finish in 1968 and a bronze medal in 1972. 
He became water polo coach at Stanford in 1973 and began coaching its men's volleyball team in 1974 and women's vol­leyball team in I 976. 
Lambert left Stanford in 1978 to enter private business. 
"He will be here on Monday," said Heisler. "He's already recruiting." 
Sandy Vanslager, who had coached the team since it became a varsity sport in 1980, will continue as a physical educa­tion instructor. 
She was not heavily recruited, but, 
like a scholarship player, she would 
often choose a college with a good 
basketball program. 
The golden age ofwalk-ons ended at Notre Dame after the 1980-81 season. That was Mary DiStanislao's ftrSt season as the Irish basketball coach. DiStanislao difl have one scholarship player (another was injured early in the season and never really recovered), but the rest of the squad was walk-ons. 
That situation changed the next season when DiStanislao brought in five blue-chip recruits. Now there are 12 scholarship players on the team. 
But one of the 12, senior captain Theresa Mullins, stands out from the others in several ways. The biggest difference is that she was one of the last group of walk-ons who made major contributions on the court Now relegated to the bench while her highly-recruited teammates are on the court, Mullins still makes major contributions in her role as team captain. 
"Theresa is definitely the steady­ing influence are the team because she is such a steady character," says DiStanislao. "She's the captain be­cause she's a leader. So, while it's sometimes tough because she isn't on the court much, the team has to have the knowledge that it's her team. 
"Since the moment she came on the team, which is the moment I came on, she ha.-; been the grittiest person on the team. Nobody worked harder, nobody was more vocaL Whatever she does, she does fully." 
Granted that adjectives like "gritty" and "steady" are usually used to describe your average benchwarmer -something like saying a blind date has a "nice per­sonality" -but Mullins' presence has been invaluable as the Irish con­tinue to upgrade the program. 
She is, in a way, a playercoach. She is a very intense and very vocal per­son during a game, just like DiStanis­lao. At the same time, her strong personality oflSets this intensity. Besides being only one of two 
seniors on the team (Jenny Klauke is 
the other), she is naturally looked up 
to by her younger teammates. 
"The other players know that I un­derstand Coach and she understands me, so I guess they feel they can talk to me," says Mullins. "I just try to keep everyone together_ I make sure people don't let up, but keep on their toes, especially in down periods. I just hope that if I'm working my hardest and don't play, the other players will see it and work harder themselves." 
It would be inaccurate to say that 
Mullins is the la.-;t of a dying breed 
just because she began playing 
before the influx ofscholarships, be­
cause all of DiStanislao's players are 
drilled to be imenSt· and hard­
working players_ But she is as realis­
tic as you would expect from someone who came to a building program just hoping to make the team. 
"When I first came to Notre 
Dame, I just wanted to make the 
team," Mullins explains. "I figured 
that if I made the team and worked 
hard, I could get two, maybe three, 
good years in. I wasn't totally naive. I 
knew that there would be scholar­
ship players coming in." 
Her estimates proved to be very accurate. After seeingaction in all 28 games in her freshman year and averaging about four points per game, she started in all 25 games the next season. Her scoring output in­creased slightly, but the scholar­ships caught up with her and she has seen little action over the la.~t two years. 
"I like to look at it that I'll work my hardest in practice and hope that, if I get in, I'll do the job," says the Wil­mington, Del., native. "I haven't given up, though. I just realize that I have a role and that I'm not a.o; talented as the other players. But those are the breaks. I just know that I'd be the same person ifIhad played or not 
"I wa.o; always taught that, if you work hard, you'll get a I00 percent payoff. I've benefited. I've made some great friends, so I'm happy."
