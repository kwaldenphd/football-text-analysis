Sum.m.er training benefits University ROTC participants 

Junior Patrick Grainey, right, instructs freshmen in a ROTC drill during freshman orientation week. 
By BRIDGET KEATING News Writer 

As senior Ryan Larson landed in Fort Lewis, Wash. for an Army leadership assessment camp, he felt prepared for the challenges that lay ahead. 
"I felt ... confident that the training program at Notre Dame prepared me for success and knew I'd face few surpris­es." 
Now back on campus for the academic year, course work· and busy schedules pale to compare to the rigors of the challenges Larson and his fel­low Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) faced during the summer. 
Students enrolled in Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) programs at Notre Dame bal­ance a full course load with physical and classroom military training, as well as extracurric­ular involvement -and the work continues when school is out of session. 

While most students digress from such a demanding sched­ule during the summer months, ROTC cadets and midshipmen dive into various required and voluntary training and leader­ship programs in preparation for futures in their respective branches. 
Each branch participates in competitive programs that allow students from colleges across the country to gather to demonstrate their abilities. Often summer results are fac­tored into a formula that con­tributes to placement upon commissioning. 

Major Gary Masapollo likened Army summer commitment to the "bowl game" of Army ROTC. The most crucial step for any AROTC student is the completion of Warrior Forge Leadership Development Assessment Course (LDAC), he said. 
Notre Dame AROTC focuses heavily on cadet readiness for camp because camp scores can amount to half of their entire four-year grade, Masapollo said. 
In addition, scores influence a cadet's selection opportuni­ties upon commissioning. Strong Scholar Athlete Leader profiles include a high academ­ic record -including military studies -and involvement in athletics, community service and other activities. 
To ensure solid performances from Notre Dame participants, current juniors prepare

CAMPUS LIFE COUNCIL 

Mem.bers establish task forces, set goals 
By KAITLYNN RIELY 
News Writer 
Concerns ranging from stu­dents safety to gambling and alcohol abuse were raised at the first Campus Life Council 
(CLC) meeting of the year Monday. 
To manage and address these pressing issues the CLC created three task (orces ­Conduct Awareness, Student Concerns and Student Voice and Input -and one ad-hoc committee regarding student safety matters to organize its approach to this year's student affairs agenda. 

Student body president and CLC chair Lizzi Shappell start­ed the meeting with introduc­tions and explained the coun­cil's job and how it operates to new members. 
"This body's purpose is to advise [Vice President for Student Affairs) Father [Mark] Poorman," Shappell said. "In bringing rectors, administra­tors, and faculty to the table, I personally believe that it encompasses student life, but from different perspectives." 
Most of the work of the CLC gets done on the task force, Shappell said. Last year, she

Not just crab cakes 
Quick! 
Name one thing about Maryland. 
Let me guess. You either said crab 
cakes or football, right? 
Because that's what we do. 
Hey, it was in a 
movie, and Jay Fitzpatrick 
movies don't lie, 
do they?
Well, as a Sports Writer Marylander, I can tell you right now that was way off the mark. We don't "do" football. We do lacrosse. Or jousting, _if you want our offlcial state sport. But it's okay if you didn't know that, because not many people do. They don't care about Maryland. It's just that goofy looking state shoved between Pennsylvania and Virginia. Oh, we're near D.C., but as a Baltimorean, I hate D.C. But if you go back far enough, to the colonial age, you may remem­ber that we Marylanders were the flrst to allow Catholics to live freely, so about 85 percent of you reading this owe us a .big thank you. Or at least a little wave on your way passing through. Move forward in time to 1787 and the Constitution. ·This is the begin­ning of Maryland's obscurity as even Delaware passed us. Of course you're going to be the "First State" -you're right next to Philly, and you only have three counties. Let it go. Now we go to 1814, the Battle of Baltimore. If you didn't know, this is when the Star Spangled Banner was written, so every time you sing that song, you are praising the bravery of Marylanders. But most of the time, that gets left out of the story too. I still blame Delaware. Have you ever wondered why our football team is the Ravens? That's right, kiddies, it's because a corrupt political machine bought Edgar Allan Poe's vote multiple times in exchange for alcohol -so much so that it left him dead in a gutter. And since we're good peo­ple, we buried him in one of our church graveyards and named a team after one of his poems 140 years later. And what was Poe doing there in the first place? He was passing through on his way from Richmond to Philadelphia. In the 20th century, Maryland was blessed with two of the greatest teams in sports history-Johnny Unitas' Baltimore Colts and the Orioles of 1966-83. Unfortunately, the Colts snuck out to Indianapolis in the dead of night, and the Orioles are now one of tbe worst franchises in sports. Oh well. At least our crab cakes are good.

Woman crashes while teaching dog to drive 
BEIJING -A woman in I-lohhot, the capital of north China's Inner Mongolia region, crashed her car while giving her dog a driv­ing lesson, the official Xinhua News Agency said Monday. 
No injuries were reported although both vehicles were slightly damaged, it said. 
The woman, identified only be her surname, Li, said her dog "was fond of crouching on the steering wheel and often watched her drive," according to Xinhua. 
"She thought she would let the dog 'have a try' while she operated the accelerator and brake," the report said. "They did not make it far before crashing into an oncoming car." 

Xinhua did not say what kind of dog or vehicles were involved but Li paid for repairs. 
Man sends pornographic pictures to ex's family 
APE GIRARDEAU, Mo. ­A southeast Missouri man will go to jail for breaking into his ex-wife's e-mail and sending pornographic pic­tures of her to her relatives. 
Alfred Seals, 47, of Cape Girardeau, pleaded guilty Wednesday to misde­meanor tampering with computer data, and was sentenced to 20 days in jail. 
Seals gained access to his wife's e-mail account with­out her consent, then e­mailed the woman's family a Web site link and mes­sage stating, "something nice to see," according to a probable-cause statement. 
The link took users to a Web site that contained several pornographic pic­tures Seals took of the woman when they were married.

Grant funds biologist's research 
Lodge helps assess 
. . . . 
znvaszve speczes zn Great Lakes region 
Special to The Observer 
The eight Great Lakes states have an estimated 3. 7 million registered recreationaJ boats, which is one-third of the nation's total number. An esti­mated $16 billion industry, recreational boating in the Great Lakes region is two-and­one-half times larger than commercial navigation on the Great Lakes. 
Few, if any, of these recre­ational boaters realize that they are key actors in the drama of invasive species in the United States. 
Now, Notre Dame biologist David Lodge, The Nature Conservancy's Great Lakes Program, University of Georgia researchers, and other private and public partners are com­bining their scientific and man­agement expertise to assess the risk of future invasive species invasions. Funded by a $1.1 million grant from the Great Lakes Protection Fund, the researchers hope to improve ecosystem-wide man­agement of these species in the lakes and adjacent inland water bodies. 
"Our goal is to develop tools and then to apply these tools to the forecasting of invasive species in the Great Lakes," Lodge said. "This project scales from the species distributed by global patterns of shipping, through the Great Lakes as a regional epicenter for invasions of North America, to local management of species spreading from the Great Lakes to inland aquatic ecosys­tems." 
The Great Lakes are a key beachhead for invasions of invasive species into the United States. Ships arrive at Great Lakes destinations from ports throughout the world, often bearing non-native species in their ballast water. The water is then discharged into the lakes. 
Recreational boaters su.bse­quently use the Great Lakes, unaware that in the process invasive species are now resid­ing on their boats and trailers. The boaters later introduce the species into other inland waterways they use for recre­ation. 
Lodge notes that researchers will first rank the major ports of the world in order of the threat they pose as a source of invasive species to the Great Lakes. 
"This risk assessment will be based on environmental simi­larity, such as salinity and tem­perature, and on the identifica­tion of potentially harmful species that inhabit ports that are linked by shipping to the Great Lakes," Lodge said. "We will analyze the past and exist­ing ship traffic among high risk ports and the lakes." 
The researchers also will 
develop novel genetic technolo­gies to conduct real-time moni­toring of selected, high-concern harmful organisms in ballast water of ships entering the Great Lakes. Working in con­junction with Hsueh-Chia Chang of the Notre Dame Center for Microfluidics, Lodge and fellow Notre Dame biolo­gist Jeff Feder hope to develop a hand-held "lab on a chip" that could rapidly and accu­rately detect invasive species in ballast water samples. 
"We can then derive a risk assessment for individual ships entering the Great Lakes, based on the past ports of call of each ship, the species known to occur in those ports and the presence of any species detect­ed by this hand-held genetic probe," Lodge said. 
In the fmal phase of the proj­ect, researchers will use net­work modeling to select several pilot locations that will most cost-effectively slow the spread of targeted invasive species. The project team will test the effectiveness of a series of intervention strategies, includ­ing educational activities, inspections and boat washing stations to help slow the spread of invasive species already established, but still spreading, among inland lakes and rivers. 
Lodge points out that the forecasting and prevention effort involves a diverse team consisting of researchers, pri­vate stakeholders, relevant industries and state and feder­al agency partners.

ROTC 
continued from page 1 
throughout the year. At the start of the school year, seniors -who have already completed camp -serve as mentors to those getting ready. 
Masapollo said Notre Dame consistently produces cadets that score high above the national average. 
Field training in Michigan, one of the many training steps, allows leaders to create camp­type situations to teach and test the students. Masapollo said these leaders are like a "coaching staff" that prepares the team by incorporating "game-like scenarios." 
Battalion executive officer Ryan Larson recently complet­ed LDAC and attained the cov­eted Recondo Badge -an honor awarded to a small number of camp graduates who exceed standards in all areas. 
"Our curriculum focuses on all the right things, most notably those aspects most pertinent to LDAC success," he said. 
Back on campus, Larson and returning cadets are able to make small changes to every­day practices to. strengthen the battalion's success. Air Force ROTC must success­fully complete field training after sophomore year. This program combines basic train­ing with leadership develop­ment where detailed evalua­tions affect future placement. 
The rigors of field training include strict schedules, intense diet and exercise regimes and high standards of military decorum. The demands often lead to a large number of students failing to complete the camp. 
Notre Dame AFROTC pre­pares cadets with labs that range from training and camp life to physical demands -and even drills on how to properly make a bed. Such training is a stepping stone to leadership positions for juniors returning to campus. 
"Notre Dame has a good rep­utation not only as a school, but also as a unit that is looked up to," said Captain Amy 

Bellenbaum, commandant of cadets. 
Senior John Paul Adrian, cadet wing commander, is one such example. Upon comple­tion of field training; Adrian qualified to return as a train­ing assistant and earned first place in the process. 
"It was an absolutely great experience," he said. "I wish I could go back." 
Bellenbaum said cadets like Adrian who return to assist are "treated with respect on the officer level." 
For those in Naval ROTC, structured summer programs evolve from year to year, beginning with a four-week indoc­trination into 
Service selection relies on a performance formula com­prised heavily of GPA followed by extracurricular involve­ment. Notre Dame students succeed as officers, as the University is known for pro­ducing technical advanced midshipmen, Neller said. 
The University's close rela­tionship with the Navy goes back to World War II when ­at its peak -1,100 officers were commissioned every 90 days. At the time this number was second only to the United States Naval Academy.

Unique experiences to the Marine Corps include Mountain Warfare training in Bridgeport, Calif. and Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Quantico, Virginia. OCS is a commission­ing requirement. 
"Midshipmen mature a great deal because of interaction with active duty Marines, shared pride in what they are doing and [in! garnering expe­rience," Major Tyrone Theriot said. 
Theriot said program strengths are a testament of the "high caliber students that Notre Dame admits, as well as the individuals who are com­mitted to serve their country."

led the Task Force on Student Voice and Input -a committee which CLC members reinstated this year. 
The Task Force on Student Voice and Input looked at stu­dent activity within the University and explored the pos­sibility of an online application system for students who want to be involved in committees. 
Carroll rector Father Jim Lewis reintroduced a concern mentioned at the final CLC meet­ing last spring regarding student alcohol abuse, gambling habits and pornography in male resi­dence halls. The other members agreed to address these prob­lems through the Conduct Awareness task force. 

Welsh Family rector Candace Carson also restated the con­cerns she brought up at last year's final meeting and suggest­ed the creation of a task force dealing with residence hall­related programming activities. She wants to work with the University to facilitate catering events and develop contacts with University-approved vendors for things like dorm T-shirts. 
The council considered nam­ing the new committee the Student Goods and Services Task Force, but changed it to Student Concerns to encompass a wider range of issues. 
Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs G. David Moss suggested the creation of a stu­dent safety task force in light of the recent assaults committed against Notre Dame students on Notre Dame Avenue and in a Turtle Creek apartment. Shappell ended the meeting with a discussion of these events, which she called "appalling." 
"I want to discuss how we bet­ter arm our students with the knowledge of how to keep [themselves] safe off-campus," Shappell said. 
Off-campus senator Mark Healy suggested approaching the problem on two fronts. 
He said the CLC can communi­cate safety advice to students in print or through e-mail and coordinate with Notre Dame Security/Police and the South Bend Police Department to pre­
vent future dangerous situa­tions. 
The problem of student safety is just as great on campus as it is off, Carson said. She said the location of her dorm makes her residents even more vulnerable. 
"Everyone thinks Welsh Family is a public facility," Carson said. "I can't tell you how many times I've escorted people out of my hall." 
The Task Force on Student Safety will remain an ad-hoc committee until members agree about its usefulness. 
Dillon rector F<j,ther Paul Doyle asked committee members to think about using the task forces to "capture the energy" that per­vades the Notre Dame campus this year in light of the promis­ing football season and a second at off-campus residences. 
"The most important thing we do is to advise our stu­dents to remove all valuables from their cars and be aware of any suspicious activity," Ludwig said. "Of course, we advise them to contact the Sheriff if they notice any suspicious activi­ty. If all the students look out for each other, there should be very few problems." 
Ludwig said he is in the process now of trying to assign more security to the Stadium Club property.

Shiite, Iraqi forces clash; 40 dead 
DIWANIYAH, Iraq -Shiite militiamen bat­tled Iraqi forces for 12 hours Monday, leav­ing at least 40 people dead and underlining the government's struggle to rein in an anti­
U.S. cleric. The U.S. announced nine soldiers killed over the weekend in separate fighting. 
The fighting in this southern city dominat­ed a day that saw at least 19 people die in two suicide car bombings in Baghdad ­one outside the Interior Ministry and one on a line of cars waiting for fuel at a gas sta­tion. 
Diwaniyah, 80 miles south of Baghdad, is a Shiite-dominated city where the influence of firebrand cleric Muqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi Army has been gradually increasing. The militia already runs a virtual parallel gov­ernment in Sadr City, a slum in eastern Baghdad. 
Britain seeks suspect's extradition 
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -Pakistan is con­sidering a British request for the extradition of Rashid Rauf, who was arrested earlier this month in connection with the alleged plot to blow up U.S.-bound jetliners, the Foreign Ministry said Monday. 
Rauf -earlier identified by Pakistan as a "key person" in the plot -was being inves­tigated for alleged links with al-Qaida, in connection with terrorist threats in Britain and in Pakistan, said ministry spokeswoman Tasnim Aslam. 
Aiden Liddle, a spokesman for the British Embassy, confirmed it had submitted the extradition request, but said it was in con­nection with a British investigation into a 2002 murder. Rauf moved to Pakistan short­ly after his maternal uncle was stabbed to death that year.

Florida residents stock up for storm 
MIAMI -Florida residents rushed to fill their prescriptions and stood in long lines for gasoline, food and other supplies Monday as officials warned people not to wait for Tropical Storm Emesto to become a hurricane again before tak­ing precautions. 
Forecasters said Emesto could grow back into a hurricane in the warm waters off Cuba and come ashore in South Florida as early as Tuesday night, exactly one year after Hurricane Katrina pummeled the Gulf Coast. 
"Make sure you have the supplies for the 72 hours after the storm," Gov. Jeb Bush warned people in Tallahassee, a day after declaring a state of emergency for all Florida. "A hurricane's a hurricane, and it has a devastation we've already seen. All you have to do is rewind to last year and see." 

Court acquits mother of son's suicide 
NEW HAVEN, Conn. -The Connecticut Supreme Court on Monday overturned a moth­er's conviction on charges that she contributed to her 12-year-old son's suicide by keeping a filthy house. 
In ordering the trial court to acquit Judith Scruggs of Meriden, the court said the law used to convict her was unconstitutionally vague. 
Scruggs was convicted of risk of injury to a minor in 2003, a year and a half after her son, J. Daniel. hanged himself with a necktie in his clos­et. Legal experts said it was thought to be the first time a parent had been convicted over a child's suicide.

INDIANAPOLIS-A small plane narrow­ly missed homes as it crashed in a subdi­vision's retention pond Monday, killing the pilot, but residents rescued the three pas­sengers as the aircraft filled with water. 
The residents pulled out all four people in the single-engine plane, but the pilot, Indianapolis oral surgeon Robert Edesess, died at a hospital. He and two family members aboard were survivors of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.

Kofi Annan calls for cease-fire 
U.N. chief urges Hezbollah to free captured soldiers, Israel to lift blockades 
Associated Press 
BEIRUT U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan faulted both Israel and Hezbollah on Monday for not living up to key sections of the cease-fire resolution, while two more countries took steps to provide troops for an expanded peacekeeping force to secure the truce. 
Germany, meanwhile, hinted it was negotiating a prisoner swap. 
Sitting beside Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Saniora, Annan demanded Hezbollah return two cap­tured Israeli soldiers, whose July 12 abduction touched off the 34-day war, and said Israel must lift its air and sea block­ade of Lebanon. 
Although Annan was critical of both sides, he also said the agreement provided a chance for a long-term peace. As the cease-fire held for the 15th day, neither side looked like it wanted to resume large-scale hostili­ties. 

But the U.N. chief cau­tioned the road ahead would be long, and pledged the international community's support. As part of that support, Italy and Turkey moved to join the U.N. peacekeeping Beirut.

winter and spring break semi­nars. During fall break, stu­dents will participate in the Appalachia Seminar, the Gospel of Life Seminar, the Cultural Diversity Seminar. the Lives in the Balance: Youth, Violence, and Society Seminar or the Washington D.C. Seminar. 
Senior Matthew Hughes, who participated twice in the fall break Appalachia Seminar, now works with the seminar's task force. 
Hughes said he has made a few changes to this year's sem­inar, incorporating the CSC's yearlong theme "Economic Justice for All" while remain­ing focused on Catholic Social Teaching -an essential ele­ment of all CSC seminars. This year's participants also will take a closer look at some of the economic issues within Appalachia. 
Due to the academic nature of the seminars, the deadline for submitting an application 
for a fall break service trip was last Thursday. Participants must complete classes, reading assignments, reflective papers and a final research paper. 
"In the fall the participants tend to be upperclassmen because of their familiarity with the CSC's seminars," Hughes said. "We'll have more freshmen in the spring as they become more aware of all the CSC otTers." 
Junior Caroline I-lonsa volun­teered at the Catholic Workers' Home in Cleveland over winter break and observed the strug­gles of poverty firsthand, a touching experience that she said inspired her to apply for the Appalachia seminar over fall break. 
"During one evening, a woman drove up in a car to let the volunteers know that a refrigerator had broken in a nearby store and free meat was available," Honsa said. "I was touched that she bothered to tell them. I learned more fully that there are small opportunities to serve all around us and we just need to keep our ears, eyes, and hearts open in order to hear the call." 
esc seminar students are not only volunteering to help others but also tackling social and political issues. 
"With the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina upon us, these seminars give students the opportunities to ask ques­tions we need to be asking, especially at a Catholic univer­sity," said Father Bill Lies, director of the CSC. "We take the chance to ask questions about social responsibility, and all seminars ask these ques­tions in different ways." 
Students participating in the Washington D.C. Seminar will observe advocacy groups and elected officials to promote international peace and stabil­ity. 
"Too often, we are aware of only what's going on under the Dome," Hughes said. "It's important for us to step out­side of our comfort zone and recognize the humanity of the folks we come into contact with."

Ivy Tech president to leave after 23 years 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -The presi­dent of Ivy Tech Community College said Monday he plans to step down, the third Indiana public college president this year to announce his departure. 
Gerald I. Lamkin, 70, became president of Ivy Tech in 1983. He helped transform it from a vocational school to the state's eommunity college, whieh enrolled more than 69,000 stu­dents on 23 eampuses this fall, up 7 percent from a year ago. I le plans to step down on June 30, 2007. 
"My time at Ivy Tech has been the most rewarding times of my life," Lamkin said in a news release. "We have made tremendous strides in establish­ing an effective and enriching community college system for the state of Indiana." 
Ivy Tech took over the state's community college system last year. State leaders hope the school will help a higher educa­tion system that traditionally has pushed most students toward more expensive four­year campuses at Purdue and Indiana universities. 
"In order for the state to reach its economic and work force development goals, Ivy Tech must be in a position to provide the training and educa­tion that is needed to prepare thousands of Hoosiers for the jobs of the future," Lamkin said. 
Lamkin is the third Indiana public college president to announce he would step down. 
Martin Jischke said earlier this month that he would retire from Purdue University next summer. Indiana University President Adam Herbert told trustees in January that he would not return when his con­tract expires in 2008. 

Bush marks Katrina anniversary in speech 
President visits Miss., says recovery effort is still in early stages 
Associated Press 
BILOXI, Miss. -President Bush said Monday the huge job of rebuilding from Hurricane Katrina was just beginning a year after the massive storm but expressed hope that the $110 billion of help sent from Washington would be enough. 
Trying to erase the black mark left on his presidency by the administration's sluggish response to Katrina, Bush returned to the first scene he saw a year ago of the storm's devastation. 
Standing on a vacant lot in a working elass neighborhood where trailers and gutted build­ings stand next to newly built homes, Bush pledged the feder­al government would stand with the region as it rebuilds. It's a promise viewed with skepticism by victims still reeling from the storm. 
"A year ago, I committed our federal government to help you," Bush said. "I said, 'We have a duty to help the local people recover and rebuild,' and I meant what I said." 
Of the $110 billion in hurri­cane aid approved by Congress, just $44 billion has been spent. Overall, the administration has released $77 billion to the states, reserving the rest for future needs. 
"Hopefully that'll work. Hopefully that's enough," Bush said after visiting a company that has restarted its business of building and repairing boats. "It's certainly enough to get us through the next period of time." 
Bush focused on the positive, but acknowledged that much remains to be done. 
"It's an anniversary, but it's not an end," Bush said. "Frankly it's just the beginning." 
Asked how long the rebuilding would take, Bush said: "I would say years, not months. On the other hand, the progress in one year's time has been remark­able." 
The weleome Bush received in Biloxi was warmer than the one he is expected to get in Louisiana, where recovery efforts have moved much more slowly. The president ended the day in New Orleans, dining at Mother's Restaurant, a local institution known for its po'boys and red beans and rice, with Mayor Ray Nagin, Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blaneo and other local leaders. 
Bush and his guests weren't the restaurant's only famous patrons. Actor Rob Lowe was eating there with his family, and expounded on the city's great need. He took a cut in pay for his latest TV movie, "A Perfect Day," so it could be filmed in New Orleans and bring business to the area. 
"It's devastating," Lowe said of the conditions in the worst­hit, poorest parts of the city, which he toured the day before. "It's so sad." 
On Tuesday, the actual anniversary of Katrina, Bush has a half-day of events in New Orleans. 
"There is a division over there," Thomas "Lynn" Patterson, who gave Bush a tour of his new home in Biloxi, said about New Orleans. "There's not the same division over here." 
When Bush visited Patterson's neighborhood right after the storm, the 61-year-old was dig­ging cars out of the muck. Patterson said Bush told him then that he wanted to make sure that people got the aid they needed. 
"He hasn't forgotten it," said Patterson. "We don't expect him to pull out his wallet and write a check for us. He personally would do it if he eould beeause he's a passionate guy." 
When Katrina struck Biloxi, 100-mph-plus winds and a wall of water obliterated a bridge and splintered houses like matchsticks. Water topped rooftops. Entire neighborhoods were washed away. 



Confusion led to Ky. crash 
Associated Press 

LEXINGTON, Ky. Investigators in the Comair jet crash that killed 49 peo­ple are looking into whether changes made to a taxiway during a repaving projeet a week ago confused the pilot and caused him to turn onto the wrong runway. 
Federal aviation officials said Monday they were also looking at such things as runway lights, markings and signs for clues to what could have misled the pilots, as well as anything else that changed the configuration or appearance of the airport. 
Both the old and new taxi­way routes cross over the short runway where Flight 5191 tried to take off before crashing into a grassy field and bursting into flame, Airport Executive Director Miehael Gobb told The Associated Press. 
"It's slightly different than 
Soo a cornpany Hko 
it used to be," said Charlie Monette, president of Aero­Tech flight school at the air­port. "Could there have been some confusion associated with that? That's certainly a possibility." 
It was unclear whether the Comair pilots had been to the airport since the changes to the taxi route. 
Lowell Wiley, a flight instructor who flies almost every day out Lexington, said in an interview that he was confused by the redirected taxi route when he was with a student Friday taking off from the main runway. 
"When we taxied out, we did not expect to see a barri­er strung across the old taxi­way," Wiley said. "It was a total surprise." 
Investigators planned to use a high truck to simulate the pilots' view of the run­ways and taxiways in their efforts to determine why the jet turned onto a shorter runway before dawn Sunday. The lone survivor was a criti­cally injured co-pilot who was pulled from the cracked cockpit. 
Authorities also planned to prepare a full report on the pilots, including what they did on and off duty for sever­al days before the crash, which was the worst U.S. plane disaster since 2001. 
All discussions between the plane and the control tower were about a takeoff from the main strip, Runway 22, which is 7,000 feet long, National Transportation Safety Board member Debbie Hersman. 
Somehow, the commuter jet ended up on Runway 26 instead -a eraeked surface about 3,500 feet long that forms an X with the main runway and is meant only for small planes. Aviation experts say the CRJ-100 would have needed 5,000 feet to get airborne.

IN BRIEF 
Rates decline at Treasury Bill auction 
WASHINGTON -Interest rates on short-term Treasury bills fell in Monday's auction, with the six-month bill dropping to the lowest level since mid-June. 
The Treasury Department auctioned $17 bil­lion in three-montli bills at a discount rate of 
4.960 percent, down from 4.975 percent last week. Another $16 billion in six-month bills was auctioned at a discount rate of 4.970 percent, down from 4.975 percent last week. 
The three-month rate was the lowest since these bills were at 4.925 percent on July 10. The six-month rate was the lowest since 4.925 per­cent on June 12. 
The discount rates reflect that the bills sell for less than face value. For a $10,000 bill, the three-month price was $9,874.62 while a six­month bill sold for $9,748.74. 
Separately, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the average yield for one':.year Treasury bills, a popular index for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 5.07 percent last week, down from 5.10 percent the previous week. 
Detroit teachers reject contract, strike 
DETROIT-Teachers overwhelmingly rejected a two-year contract proposal by the city public school district on Sunday and decided to strike. 
The Detroit Federation of Teachers, which rep­resents 9,500 employees, said teachers plan to demonstrate at their schools Monday, the day they were scheduled to report to work to prepare for the beginning of the school year. 
Classes are scheduled to start Sept. 5. Negotiations were expected to resume Monday. 
"If I have to hold all the hearings personally and do nothing else for the next two months, I'll do that," Detroit Public Schools Superintendent William Coleman III told reporters Sunday. 
Union president Janna Garrison said some of the district's proposals included a 5 1/2 percent wage reduction and copays for health care bene­fits of up to 20 percent. Only two teachers out of nearly 6,000 voted to accept the district's propos­al, the union said. 
"The vote of the membership confirms the position of the leadership," Garrison said in a statement. "Teachers are not willing to continue absorbing the cost of the district's mismanage­ment any longer."

The student loan problem .has gotten so bad that several major universities, not including Notre Dame, are finally doing something dramatic about it. 
According to the National Student Loan Survey, average undergraduate loan debt in 2002 was $18,900, up 66 per­cent since 1997. Graduate students incurred an added $31,700 in average

Wrong?
ried an average of $91,000 in total debt. 
In response to the problem, several schools are using university funds to reduce or eliminate that loan burden for students with demonstrated need. Harvard does not ask parents earning less than $60,000 a year to contribute to their child's education. At Yale and Stanford, the figure is $45,000. The University of Pennsylvania replaces loans with grants for students from families with incomes under $50,000. Virginia, Brown and other institutions are taking similar steps. 
The most creative is Princeton University. In 2001, Princeton became the first university to replace loans with grants and a campus job for all students qualify-ing for aid. Six hundred seventy­four members (or 55 percent) of the entering class of 2009 received such aid. The average scholarship was $28,100, with $18,900,000 in total scholarship aid. The average family income of aid recipi­ents was $93,950, with 225 below

$40,000 and 124 more below $60,000. 
Princeton is smaller than Notre Dame and has a much bigger endowment. Notre Dame's excellent Financial Aid Office tries to help students, including an effort to reduce the loan portion of need-based aid by replacing loans with scholarships. But a major clement continues to be the stu­dent loan. It is fair to suggest that Notre Dame should emulate the no-loan eon­cept openly and aggressively. Notre Dame's undergraduate tuition rate for 2006-07 rose 5.8 percent over last year for a new total of tuition and average room and board (TRB) of$42,137. The rate of increase is lower than in the previ­ous three years, but it is higher than the 
4.2 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) from 2005 to 2006. While some belittle the use of the CPI to evalu­ate the rise of college tuition, the CPI does measure what it costs the students and their families to live. In 1978-79, before Notre Dame began its pursuit of Research Prestige, TRB was $5,180. Adjusted for inflation by the CPI, the TRB now would be $16,255 instead of$42,137. 
The federal student loan program began modestly in the 1970s as a supple­ment to means-tested federal grants. It expanded as Congress succumbed to pressure from the universities to finance its research programs on tho backs of the borrowing students. Notre Dame's THB began to skyrocket after it began to describe itself in 1978 as a "National Catholic Hesearch University." Notre Dame followed the lead of the major uni­versities in using the expanding federal loan programs to finance its research enterprise. As the loan limits went up, so did tuition. The universities lobbied for higher loan limits, raised tuition again in response and so on. The process contin­ues in varied forms today. 
Recent studies, including one from last December by Allan Carlson of the Howard Center, document the obvious impact of student debt on marriage and childbearing. A national Creighton University study of young married cou­ples, published in 2000, asked respon­dents to state 42 issues that "might be problematic during the early years of marriage." For all respondents, "debt brought into marriage" ranked third. Among respondents under age 30 and among those married one year or less, it ranked first. 
For very Catholic reasons. Notre Dame should be in the forefront in the war on student-loan debt. Heavy loans narrow a graduate's career, marriage and family options. Examples abound of young lawyers compelled by debt to forego, or leave, lower-paying positions as public defenders, disability advocates and prose­cutors. Alumni in other occupations could tell similar stories. 
Our leaders' pursuit of a Research Reputation has unjustly inflicted this loan burden on non-wealthy alumni of Notre Dame. Our leaders have a duty to relieve that burden at least for present and future Notre Dame students. Notre Dame should be a leader, not a follower, in all"ording its grads the freedom to choose to eontributc to the common good in their career and family choices.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
An invalid assumption 

William McAuliffe's points on the lack of planning in regard to Iraq ('The War on Errorism," Aug. 25) are occasionally well made, if a bit rhetorically overstated. And though I appreciate the fact that a more benevolent attitude toward the Middle East problem is attractive, I would suggest that he fails to take into account two major issues and involves an assumption that is invalid. 
First, McAuliffe seems to suggest that the fact that the Muslim world hates us is our fault. This is histori­cally incorrect. The Muslim world first invaded Christendom as early as the ninth century. The Muslim world has been opposed to the West as long as it has existed. Though 
U.S. foreign policy may exacerbate this animosity, it in no way causes it. 
Second. McAuliffe suggests in essence, that the liberalization of the Middle East will bring about changes necessary to end the above conflict. Assuming that the Muslim world even wants this, which is highly doubtful, I would offer both Iraq and Palestine as evidence that when given the opportunity to dem-
U-WIRE 
ocratically choose a government, they tend to choose reactionary and backward-looking governments. 
The assumption made is that the Muslim world is, at root, a sane, rational civilization that should be dealt with in the same way that, say, Canada, Britain, or Germany should. Any time spent reading the state­ments of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad should cast serious doubt on that assumption. 
Though I too believe that our cur­rent solution for dealing with Islamofascism is sub-optimal, I also believe that this is a conflict in which diplomacy and other "soft power" projections are of less value than they would be if dealing with more civilized nation-states. We cannot "gain the trust" of a region that views us as infidels who need to be converted or killed. Any serious for­eign policy suggestion for the region must take that into account.

I'm sorry, but I don't know who you are... 

Well, thank God the school year's starting. It's a clean slate. You get a chance to meet new friends, try new things, and this is the year we decide to study. Seriously, Mom and Dad, we were just finding

excitement. there is a terror that is more real than Avian bird flu and more horrifYing than seeing Rosie O'Donnell naked. We're talking, of course, about the "heymans." 
Let us give you an example of when one would show symptoms of the "heymans." You're walking down the Quad, undoubtedly sweating worse than Michael Jackson at an elementary school playground, when you make eye contact with a "stranger" who looks at you as ifhe knows you. 
But do you know him? Hell no. He walks closer, you turn to run, but it's too late. "Hey, Jakel" Ah, crap. You keep walking as ifyou didn't hear him, and then ... the shoulder tap. You turn around, and then the dis­ease sets its deadly course. "Oh. Hey ... man." 
We're only talking about the most awkward situation ever. Everybody's been in it; nobody likes it. It's .worse than someone telling you there's food on your face when you ate three hours ago. It's the feeling Paris Hilton has with every guy she "runs" into. Celibate for a year, Paris? You're not fooling anybody. 
Anyway, this "stranger" comes up and tries to have a conversation with you, and you could swear you've never seen him before. It was awk­ward to begin with, but it'll get 
worse. 
The hardest thing about it is trying to figure out his name. Having a friend helps, but you rarely have one with you when this happens. It always works out that way. 
Howev.er, in case you do have one with you, there are a few loopholes in the "heyman" bylaws in which the "friend" can be ofsome assistance. 
First, the easiest way out is to sim­ply introduce your friend so that he can get his name. 
Two, your friend really has to be somewhere, and you are responsible for it. "Oh, hey. Good to see you ... you know, I hate to just say hello and run like this, but Steve's mother was just plowed by a bus, and I have to get him to the hospital to see her. Take care!" Works every time. 
Now, ifunaccompanied, here's where things can go horribly wrong, because you have to be really cre­ative. We like to start a completely generic conversation like, "Man, I was just thinking the other day about that one time that wejust couldn't quit laughing. When what's-his­name was being so stupid. You re.?Iember? (insert sigh) Good times 
After that awkward moment, see if he has an article ofclothing with a name on it, or ask to see pictures of someone and hope you catch a glimpse ofhis license. 
Finally, when you figure out his name, you'll start using it in every sentence to try to make up for the fact that you forgot. "So, how's the family, Will? Been a long time, hasn't it, Will? Are you serious, Will? Get outta town, Will." Another thing, if 
you see someone you haven't seen in 
a while, it'll either be a quick, point­
less conversation or the longest one 

you've ever had. It's been so long that 
you ask stupid general questions like, 
"So, how are ... things?" 
Two things can happen here. You 
get either, "Ah, pretty good," or the 
floodgates open. These people have 

been waiting for five weeks for some­
one to ask them that, and they 
should actually be in therapy. 
"Yeah, it's been so-so. Grandma 
just passed away, and Janet got in a 
high-speed pursuit, and then Mom 
and Dad got in a huge fight and sep­
arated for a while. Uncle Frank was 
thrown in jail for armed robbery. 
Yeah, he took a shotgun into the 
Kwik-Mart after the factory let him 
go, and his wife took the kids and left 
him after that. But he only got 20 
years with parole because he didn't 
really mean to shoot the guy behind 
the counter, so it wasn't that bad. We 

get to see him on Fridays. How about 
you?" 
You don't want to make him feel 
bad, so you say something like, "I did 
have a really good smoothie the 
other day. It was the lOth one, so the 
next one's free. So I guess things are 
looking up for me ... good talk ..." 
So, best ofluck avoiding the "hey­
mans." We can't promise it won't 
happen to you, but ifyou ask us, they ' must not have been that important if 
you can't remember them, right?

A little sign goes a long way 
One and a half million Americans suffer from peanut allergies, many of which are severe and can induce poignant reactions resulting in extreme difficulty in breathing. Such reactions necessitate immediate Emergency Medical care. . 
This weekend, a lack of labeling in North Dining Hall, a bite of a peanut butter cook­ie and a freshman with a tongue beginning to swell and throat beginning to close led to my first trip to the ER this semester as a resident assistant. Spooning multiple tablespoons of Benadryl and giving pats on the back don't always do the trick. 
Regular chocolate chip cookies (without peanut butter) had sat on an identical tray in the identical spot only the day prior to the incident. Yet on Saturday, the seeming­ly identical chocolate chip cookie facade belied the deadly (and not very pleasing to my palate) peanut butter flavoring. 
Signs are not difficult to make. I have them all over my section: Flush the toilet. Turn off the radio. PW is the best dorm on campus. I could help you out NDH, I have some extra construction paper. I'll send a piece over tomorrow -it will say: Peanut Butter Cookies. And in front of the brown­ies with nuts: Contains Nuts. 
OK, I'm not trying to bash the dining hall -we obviously are very lucky to have such a hardworking, friendly, warm staff that serves us daily with a vast array of healthy and enjoyable choices -but that doesn't excuse carelessness. I saw the cookie display again today-bereft of a sign. Let's fix that. Let's help out our veg­ans and vegetarians and lactose-intolerant patrons. Let's make sure peanut-intolerant people aren't closing up their lungs and calling NDSP to drive them to St. Joe's when all they really wanted to do on Saturday afternoon was play section soc­cer. 
As food connoisseurs, preparation artists and friendly card swipers to whom the Notre Dame community entrusts our eat­ing welfare, we have certain basic expec­tations of the dining halls to ensure a par level (or maybe above par) of health and safety for members of the Notre Dame family in their daily eating endeavors. This weekend, that expectation was not met,· but I have confidence that in order to best serve our allergy-burdened fellow stu­dents, NDII will strive to meet this preva­lent, now vocalized, unmP;t need.

It takes a village ... 
Ten years ago, a school shooting would have caused wide­spread panic and disbelief. Today, for many people it is a sad reminder of what kind ofsociety we live in. It seems with each passing day we become immune and unattached to the news of 
violence iJ;l our schools. . Staff Editorial Does this decrease the seventy ofthe prob­lem? The answer is not at all. University of School security in itself is a problem. Many Mississippi believe putting thousands ofdollars worth of Dailysecurity equipment, a list that includes metal Mississippian detectors, security cameras and other such things, in a school will help. Does this help the problem, or does it just seem to help? When these security measures fail. what should be done about the problem? Students themselves should be aware oftheir surroundings. They should be keenly alert to what is going on around them, who they are with, who they are surrounded by and many other details. Preventative medicine is the best medicine. We all know children are more observant when it comes to their surroundings than adults. Students should harness this attribute and use it. After school shootings occur, there is always a search for some­one to blame, whether it is teachers, parents or members ofthe local community. The old African proverb reminds ofthat we all have a stake in a child's success and failures. "It takes a village to raise a child." All of these people are instrumental in the upbringing oftoday's youth. We learn our val­ues from our parents, friends, religious beliefs and environment. Why shouldn't all these factors have a stake in what goes right, and wrong, with a child? Each ofthese groups has a responsibility to provide the popu­lace with the best care they are able to muster. Removing any of these groups from the equation is like pulling the base from a house of cards; it has no choice but to collapse. We should strive to work together to keep kids safe. Ifwe say, "It's not my problem," one day it just might be. Why wait until it is one's problem to search for a solution? An ounce ofprevention is worth a pound ofcure. We live in a society that progressively gets worse with each passing day. While we cannot fix every problem, we can try to protect those who sometimes cannot protect themselves. In the view ofthis board, prevention begins with awareness from all ends ofthe spectrum, from the parents to the school administrators, and all people have a stake in ensuring the safety ofthe students in schools.

DPAC SPOTLIGHT 

Comedic Shakespeare performance no 'Error' 
Summer presentation brings wit, pizazz to ND 



By MICHELLE FORDICE 
Scene Critic 
Summer Shakespeare's interpretation of "The Comedy of Errors" was a splen­did look at the humor in life. 
One of Shakespeare's fastest and most farcical plays, "Errors" is a wonderful respite from the humdrums of reality and the rollicking pace and slight irrev­erence of Summer Shakespeare -the professional theatre in residence at Notre Dame -complement its century bridging humor. 
One of Shakespeare's earliest works, "Errors" takes the premise of mistaken identity between twins from the works of ancient Roman playwright Plautus. The Bard builds on Plautus' original work and turns it into a boisterous play that lets love, jealousy, slapstick and a strong helping of coincidence wreak havoc in the day of several citizens and visitors to the city of Ephesus. 
The play opens as Egeon, an aged merchant of Syracuse, is led to his exe­cution for trespassing on the city of Ephesus and after being unable to pay the 1,000 mark fine for such an offense. The Duke of Ephesus asks him to explain why he allowed himself to fall into this dire, but avoidable, position. Egeon explains that he was a young merchant happily married and blessed with two identical twin sons whom he both named Antipholus. 
For his sons he bought a pair of iden­tical twin boys, whom he named Dromio, so that they could grow up and serve as menservants to his sons. Unfortunately, when returning to Syracuse on a sea voyage, a violent storm sprang up and flung all of his 
family into the sea. save one pair of boys, but his wife, his second son and the second Dromio were lost. Egeon raised his remain­ing son, but lost him years later when he went look­ing for his brother. Now in search of his family he ends

bridging humor. 

Ironically, "Errors" 
up in Syracuse, sentenced to death. Moved by the tale, the Duke allows Egeon one day to raise the money to buy his life. 
Meanwhile, Antipholus of Syracuse has unknowingly arrived in the same city as his father along with his man Dromio. He sends Dromio away to deposit some money only to have Dromio return claiming he needs to go home to dine with his wife, of which Antipholus has none. Little does he know, this is not his Dromio, but that of his brother, a prosperous man of the city, who is married. Chaos ensues as the brothers and their menservants are repeatedly mixed and paired with the wrong people, to the point where they think only witchcraft or insanity could explain their situation. 

By the end of the day, man has mis­taken master, wife mistaken husband, and nothing but merry chaos has orchestrated their interactions, but the love of both family and sweetheart set 
all to rights. 
Like most of 
opens not with a laugh or even a smile, but with an imminent execution and story of tragedy. The play is the epitome of using comedy to battle the pitfalls of life. 
This basic concept coupled with the simple appeal of the character's antics allows it to be as entertaining to a 16th century audience as the 21st century audience that sat in the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center this August. 
The cast did not hesitate to fall full force into the buffoonery of Shakespeare's play. Led by director William Brown, it blended modern comedic elements to make Shakespeare's humor resound while refraining from diluting the potency of his dialogue with too many gags. 
Still, such touches as having Luciana read Paul's "Letter to the Ephesians" or having the executioner hug Egeon because he feels sorry for him, make this performance a little bit more their own. 
The cast's performance was comple­mented by the work of scenic designer Todd Rosenthal and costume designer Richard E. Donnelly. Both implemented strong colors and mostly simplistic geo­metric patterns that reflected the light­hearted and energetic tone of the play. 
"Errors" was the only one of Shakespeare's plays to follow the three classical unities of Aristotle's "Poetics," and the simple, operational, and bold set maintained a strong "unity of place." As an added bonus, the crew construct­ed a working fountain in the center of the stage with which the actors could make use of to look into, splash and even walk through. 
"Errors" is a wonderfully energizing play and Notre Dame's Summer Shakespeare did it full justice. The audi­ence walked out smiling, thoroughly enjoying a night of Shakespeare. 
While "Errors" finished its run in the DPAC, make sure to catch next year's performances by Summer Shakespeare, which runs from mid-July to late­August.

EMMY WRAP-UP 
Affable O'Brien lights up predictable Emmys 
'24,' ',The Office' take top honors at 58th television award show 
By CASSIE BELEK 
Assistant Scene Editor 
It's official. Conan O'Brien is the Billy Crystal of the Emmys. 
In only his second time hosting the awards show, the late-night personality opened with a comedic montage that put him in the television shows "House," "Lost" and "The Office," did a song and dance number about the sorry state of NBC and kept Bob Newhart in an airtight glass container that would run out of oxygen if the awards ceremony ran over three hours. 
The last shtick was a running joke throughout the telecast, with Newhart pounding on the walls in "panic" during commercial breaks. Fortunately, the show ran on time and Newhart was released in order to present the award for Outstanding Comedy Series. 
After last year's somber ceremony in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, this year's show was filled with light hearted­ness, laughter and Mel Gibson and Tom Cruise jokes. , 
Still, the 58th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards Sunday night were also contro­versial after a revised nomination proce­dure failed to produce the results many expected. The new rules added a step to the nomination process in which a panel of top judges selected the five nominees in each category after voting members had whittled the categories down to 10 or 15 nominees. 
Dubbed "The Lauren Graham Rule" and meant to recognize those who usual­ly go unnoticed, Lauren Graham from "Gilmore Girls" was not even nominated. The new process did work for first-time nominees Charlie Sheen ("Two and a Half Men"), Kevin James ("King of Queens") and Christopher Meloni l"Law & Order: SVU"). Unfortunately, expected nominees such as Edie Falco and James Gandolfini (both from "The Sopranos") were shunned. 
Last year's best series winners "Lost" and "Desperate Housewives" similarly garnered few nominations and were practically shut out. Bven more perplex­ing was the fact that "House," "Arrested Development" and "Scrubs" were all nominated for best series, but their lead actors -Hugh Laurie, Jason Bateman and Zach Braff, respectively -were not. 
That's not to say last night's nominees were not deserving, an issue that presen­ters and nominees Julia-Louis Dreyfus and Sean Hayes jokingly confronted. 
Another phenomenon among this 


year's nominations was the multitude of nominees and winners from cancelled series. Winners who will no longer be seen in their roles included Alan Aida ("The West Wing") for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, Blythe Danner ("Huff') for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, and Megan Mullally ("Will & Grace") for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. 
While accepting her award, Danner quipped, "I guess I have to thank Showtime, even though they have can­celed us." 
Jeremy Piven, a bona fide character actor, won his own statuette for Outstanding Supporting Actor in-a Comedy Series for his portrayal of crazed agent Ari Gold in HBO's "Entourage." In a heartfelt speech, Piven thanked his mother and then kissed his award, rais­ing it to the sky in a tribute to his father. In a post-show interview, Piven reflected on his new Emmy-winning status. 
"No one will look me in the eyes," he joked. "I will have rules. I will live in a celebrity space shuttle and hover around the universe." 
After only one season in her show "The New Adventures of Old Christine," Julia­Louis Dreyfus won the Emmy for Outstanding Actress in a Comedy Series, beating fellow former NBC leading ladies Lisa Kudrow ("The Comeback") and Debra Messing ("Will & Grace"), and 

breaking the infamous "Seinfeld" curse. "Curse this, baby!" Dreyfus exclaimed while accepting her award. 
After three consecutive nominations, Mariska Hargitay finally won Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her character Olivia Benson in "Law & Order: SVU." Nominated for an episode in which she talks entir.ely to a voice on a speakerphone, the new moth­er accepted her award with gratitude and joyful tears. 
"When I named my son August I had no idea the month would end like this," she said. 
In perhaps the most shocking upset of the evening, Tony Shalhoub ("Monk") beat favorite Steve Carel! ("The Office") for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. Shalhoub, who now has four nominations and three wins to his name, expressed disbelief at his victory and his conviction that another actor, no doubt Carel!, was going to win. 
"I would like to feel good, but I feel too numb," he said in a post-ceremony inter­view. "I was convinced it was going in another direction. That other show is so hot right now and he is so on fire -not just in television but in the feature world." 
Other awards went to "My Name is Earl" for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series and Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series, "The Sopranos" for Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series and "24" for Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series. 
The broadcast featured two touching tributes to entertainment extraordinaire Dick Clark and the late producer Aaron Spelling. Clark appeared to express his thanks after a montage of "American Bandstand" clips. 
"Everybody should be so lucky to have their dreams come true," Clark said, the effects of his stroke still apparent. 
Singer Barry Manilow then appeared on stage -the night before hip surgery -to perform his song "American Bandstand" in a fitting tribute. Shortly after the performance, Manilow won the Emmy for Outstanding Individual 
-Performance in a Variety or Music Program, beating Stephen Colbert, Craig Ferguson, David Letterman and Hugh Jackman. His coup shocked not only him­self, but presenter Stephen Colbert, who later exclaimed, "I lost to Barry Manilow! Barry Manilow!" 
Aaron Spelling's tribute included clips from the opening montages of the televi­sion shows he produced and touching words from Heather Locklear ("Dynasty," "Melrose Place"), Joan Collins ("Dynasty"), Stephen Collins ("7th Heaven") and the original "Charlie's Angels" -Kate Jackson, Farrah Fawcett and Jaclyn Smith. 
"Aaron made TV that simply tasted good," Collins said. 
In the last awards of the evening, "24" took home the trophy for Outstanding Drama Series after finishing its most crit­ically acclaimed season. 
"24" star Kiefer Sutherland also won Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for portraying federal agent Jack Bauer. 
Steve Carel! may not have won in his own category, but any disappointment soon disappeared when "The Office" won Outstanding Come.dy Series, capping off an exceptional second season after a rocky start in the show's first year. 
Despite the controversy surrounding this year's awards, the Emmys remained an entertaining and rewarding three hours. O'Brien kept the show flowing with gags no doubt pulled from his own comedic genius. 
Old favorites were honored along with some newer talent as Kareem Abdul­Jabbar reveale~ himself to be an Ernst & Young accountant, Bob Newhart lived to see another day and one television sea­son ended to prepare for the new one to begin.

LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL 


Associated Press 
SOUTH WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. -Cody Walker hit a two-run homer off ace Go Matsumoto, Ryan Carter struck out 11, and Columbus, Ga., beat Kawaguchi City, Japan, 2-1 to win the Little League World Series championship game on Monday. 
It was the second straight American victory in the Series, coming on the heels of Ewa Beach, Hawaii's win over a team from Willemstad, Curacao last year. The United States hadn't captured back-to­hack Little League titles with different teams since 1982-83 when Kirkland, Wash., and Marietta, Ga., celebrated in Williamsport. 

Long Beach, Calif., was a repeat champion in 1992­93 -the first victory awarded after a Phillipines squad was stripped of the title for using over-age players. 
Matsumoto had devastat­ed hitters in this tourna­ment with his powerful fastball. It was potent again for him on Monday, except for Walker's shot in the third inning that followed a baserunning blunder. 
Carter overcame a bout of wildness in the sixth and fmal inning. With two run­ners on, he got Ryoya Sato to hit a weak bouncer to Josh Lester at second for 
IN BRIEF 
Bonds' trainer faces further 
jail time 
SAN FRANCISCO -Barry Bonds' personal trainer was on his way back to jail Monday after being held in con­tempt of court for refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating the Giants slugger. 
Greg Anderson could remain behind bars for. more than a year while the grand jury investigates Bonds for per­jury and tax evasion, regarding income from sales of his sports memo­rabilia. 
Anderson, who has appeared five times before two federal grand juries without answering pertinent ques­tions, was held in contempt of court for two weeks last month but was released when that grand jury's term expired. 
"Sometimes sitting in the cooler for a long time may have a therapeutic affect and may change his mind," U.S. District Judge William Alsup said dur­ing the rancorous, hourlong hearing, the last out of the game. 
That prompted the Georgia-leaning crowd to erupt in cheers, chant "USA! USA!" and wave American flags. Columbus players rushed toward Lester, skipping up and down in celebration and tossing their gloves to the sky. 
Then they posed on the mound for a group picture with a banner that pro­claimed them "World Series Champions" as their gloves were strewn across the infield. 
Columbus' rally was nearly thwarted by Carter's mistake on the bases. 
Carter took off from first on Lester's single to center but didn't heed the stop sign thrown by manager Randy Morris at third. He was nailed at home for the second out, sliding into the catcher's shin guards well short of the plate. 
It didn't matter, because Walker then hit his oppo­site-field shot over the right field fence. Lester pumped his fist as he rounded third, and Morris got so excited as Walker circled the bases that his hat fell off. Jubilant teammates greeted Walker at the plate. 
A sign in the Columbus cheering section read,. "Georgia, Not Just Peaches." Now, it's also home to the best team in Little League baseball. 

after which authorities whisked Anderson into custody. 
Roddick opens strong at U.S. 
Open 

NEW YORK -Andy Roddick gave a fist pump toward coach Jimmy Connors, and walked off the court with his arms and head held high. This time, he still has more tennis to play at the U.S. Open. 
Roddick bounced back from last year's stunning first-round upset, over­powering Florent Serra 6-2, 6-1, 6-3 Monday and drawing encouraging claps from Connors. 
"It's a lot better than last year, a lot better start," the ninth-seeded Roddick said. ''I'm really confident right now." 
After a 90-minute n!in delay, open­ing day at Flushing Meadows featured an attractive lineup, on and off the blue courts. 
Andre Agassi, sure to be the crowd favorite in his final event, was to play Andrei Pavel at night. Before the match, the National Tennis Center was to be renamed in honor of former star and pioneer Billie Jean King. 
Bourdais  wins  Montreal  
Grand Prix  
MONTREAL  - A  victory  by  

Sebastien Bourdais on a track at which he has struggled might have been the biggest step yet toward the Frenchman's third straight Champ Car title. 
"It was a hell of a day for the championship," the jubilant Bourdais said Monday after winning the Montreal Grand Prix while his closest pursuers in the points failed to finish. 
The race started Sunday in a steady rain, but was halted after six laps because of a downpour at the 
2. 704-mile Circuit Gilles Villeneuve track. A.J. Allmendinger took the lead from pole-winner Bourdais on the second turn when the Frenchman nearly spun off the slip­pery circuit.

Owens discusses $9,500 fine 
Receiver claims he 'overslept' Friday's team meeting 
Associated Press 
IRVING, Texas -Terrell Owens overslept. That's it. 
lie insists he wasn't late for work Friday to send a messages to his bosses, test his boundaries or anything else hls critics might think. 
And, get this: He says it'll probably happen again, even if he was fmed $9,500. 
"I think everybody has over­slept, you know, once or twice in their life," Owens said Monday, more amused than angry that a fuss is being made over some­thing that's happened to him before, though not since he's joined the Cowboys. 
"It's not a big deal," he said. "It was not something I purposely tried to do. It's something that I will try to make more of an effort, a better effort, to get here on time. Other than that, it's really not a big issue." 
Jerry Jones agrees, pointing out that some of the most upstanding citizens in team his­tory were fined for similar trans­gressions. 
He also insisted it's a mistake to read more into Owens' tardi­ness. the fine and his lingering hamstring issue simply because of T.O.'s past. 
"From my standpoint, it's all good," Jones said. "Apart from him not being on the field and getting repetitions, has it in any way affected relationships on this team, teammates on this team, relationships between me and Bill, me and the coaching staff, Terrell and Bill, Terrell and the coaching staff? Zero impact there." 

Owens called his tardiness "very unfortunate" and apolo­gized to his teammates. But, he added, ''I've got to move on. I can't let this get me down." 
His tender hamstring is taking care of that. 
Owens missed his 20th work­out of the preseason Monday and is unlikely to play Thursday night at home against Minnesota. The bigger question is whether he'll play the season opener in Jacksonville. 
"I feel like I'm doing above and beyond things to get back on the field, whether a lot of people know that or not," he said. ''I'm doing everything. Sometimes I come in here late at night just doing extra treatment, getting in the hot tub, cold tub.... I think it's sometimes unfair that I'm getting all thls criticism because I'm hurt." 
Whether Owens plays in the opener will depend on when he starts practicing. If he never practices, he definitely won't play the opener _ even if Jones has mentioned that Deion Sanders used to get away with it. 
Parcells said he has to see what Owens can do. And he's not talking about watching high­lights from the last 10 years, as Owens suggested last week. 
"What if he got hurt or didn't perform, what would happen then?" Parcells said. "How would I know he is healthy if he didn't practice? How would I know?" 
Jones said he lets Parcells decide who to play. 
"That's an area I probably could influence, but, no, I have never influenced in my 17 years with the Cowboys as far as who goes in the game and who does­n't and what time they go into the game," Jones said. 
Jones and Parcells declined to comment specifically about the fine, saying it's an internal mat­ter. 
Jones went so far as to say he'd fire whoever leaked the news, "I don't care who it is."

Marlins victorious over Milwaukee, 4-2 

Florida rolls behind strong outing by rookie Johnson 
Associated Press 
MIAMI -J ash Johnson is helping the Florida Marlins fight their way back into the NL wild-card race. 
Johnson lowered his major league-leading ERA to 2.87, and the Marlins extended their winning streak to eight with a 4-2 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers on Monday night. 
Johnson is trying to become the first rookie to lead the major leagues in ERA since Detroit's Mark Fidrych in 1976. 
"If it's there at the end of the year, I'll take pride in that," Johnson said. "For now, I just have to keep going." 
Dan Uggla hit his 20th homer and added a sacrifice fly for the Marlins (64-66), who had not been within two games of .500 since they were 1-3 before losing on April 9. 
Florida began Monday three games behind Cincinnati, the NL wild-card leader, and is one game shy of its longest winning streak of the season. The Marlins start a six-game trip Tuesday at St. Louis. 
"Right now we're having fun, and we're just going to keep rolling with it as long as it will go," Uggla said. "This is the time you need to make a run at it." 
Johnson (12-6) won his third straight decision, striking out seven in a season-high 7 2-3 innings. He allowed two runs and eight hits. Joe Borowski struck out the side in the ninth for his 31st save in 35 chances. 
Milwaukee was swept in a four-game series for the sec­ond time this season, following a wipeout in Pittsburgh from May 29 to June 1. Ben Sheets (4-6) gave up three runs_ one earned _ and six hits in seven innings with six strikeouts. 
"We faced some good pitch­ing, and we didn't do much with it," Brewers manager Ned Yost said. 
Josh Willingham hit a two­out double RBI double in the first, and Florida made it 3-0 with two unearned runs in the fifth. 
Cody Ross was on second when he tried to score on Alfredo Amezaga's single, and left fielder Gabe Gross threw a one-bounce strike to the plate. Catcher Mike Rivera failed to hold onto the ball before Ross ran into him, and Uggla fol­lowed with a sacrifice fly that scored Amezaga. 
"It kind of caught me off guard _the grass here is thin­ner and faster than at home," Rivera said. "I thought I'd have time to get that hop." 
Ross was charged with an error. 
"That play cost us two runs," Milwaukee manager Ned Yost said. "He just dropped it. The throw was there in plenty of time." 
Bill Hall hit his 30th homer leading off the seventh, and Tony Graffanino's RBI single in the eighth pulled Milwaukee to 3-2 and chased Johnson. Uggla homered off Jose Capellan leading off the bot­tom half. 
"We got some bats on the ball but we couldn't muster up a rally," Hall said. "Johnson threw the ball great."

Men's water polo wins two games at Hillbilly Classic in Knoxville 
Special to the Observer 
Field Hockey 
Notre Dame opened its fall season Sunday with a 1-0 vic­tory over Wittenberg in Springfield, Ohio. Although the squad did not have much time to prepare, they came out strong against the Division III varsity Tigers. The Irish con­trolled the field for most of the first half with the only goal coming seven minutes into the game off a penalty corner. Senior Meghan Bennett put a hard shot past the Tigers' goalie with assists coming from Mary Davis and Lauren Petrozziello. 
One goal turned out to be enough as the strong defense led by sophomore goalie Catherine Duffy achieved a shutout. Duffy racked up 15 saves, one coming at the end of the game to shut down a Tigers breakaway. Cat Pinnaro, Jessica Cortez, and Ryan Reynolds led a stellar defensive effort. However, the key play of the game came with two minutes left when freshman Claire Kenney made a spectacular save on a ball behind Duffy to clinch the Irish victory. 
The Irish also tied the Tigers 3-3 in stroke competition fol­lowing regulation with goals by Meredith Gluck, Lauren Petrozziello and Lauren Brinkman. The Irish will con­tinue their season at home on Sept. 10 with a game against the Cincinnati Centurions. 
Men's Water Polo 

This past weekend, Notre Dame traveled to Tennessee to compete in the 2006 Hillbilly Classic. The Irish were seed­ed in a bracket with regional . foe Miami of Ohio and the host Volunteers. Notre Dame began Saturday with an easy victory over the latter, putting down the Vols 19-5. 
Freshman goalie Dave Mazur put in quite a perform­ance in his Irish debut, and continued to do so all week­end. Almost every player on the Irish roster ended up on the scoresheet, as they used their speed and depth to blow NCAA regional]," she said. "We will have to work hard and stay composed all year in that we have a very small and young team. But I think freshmen are going to step up and help us complete our goal." 
Under King, Notre Dame achieved steady improvement in scoring each year, culminat­ing last fall with the team post­ing its lowest scoring average in school history, a 306.88

away the Volunteers. 
In its second game, Notre Dame found itself in a hole early on against Miami of Ohio, down 4-0 at the start of the second quarter. However the Irish went on to outscore the Red Hawks 8-3 in the remaining quarters, as co­captain Patrick Connors, the leading scorer on the week­end, slammed home the deci­sive goal with 11 seconds remaining in the game. Great defense by fellow co-captain Jon Kelly on Miami's leading scorer, Ross Pilkin, was the real catalyst for the team, as Miami was constantly frustrat­ed on offense. 
That win sent the Irish into the semifinals to face Purdue. The lr,ish came out firing, as sophomore Tom Fletcher and freshman Craig Bentzen both had great games, scoring goals and drawing kickouts on the Boilermaker defenders. Purdue, however, did not go down quietly, as it fought back to tie the game at 10 apiece. Despite several chances for both teams to score the final goal, the end of regulation found the teams still dead­locked. Due to goal differen­average.

Sophomore Avery Ambrose scored perhaps the goal of the tournament in this game, fak­ing out three Grand Valley defenders and their goalkeep­er, and deftly lobbing the ball into the net from a very tight angle. 
Sophomore Pete Devine, making his first couple starts for the Irish, also played very well, defending with tenacity and causin_g problems for Notre Dame's opponents. The Irish travel to Dayton next month for a rematch with Grand Valley and their other conference foes.

After finishing third in the MIAA standings last season, the team intends to challenge league powerhouses Hope and Calvin for the championship in 2006.

The Belles welcome nine freshmen this season, nearly half of their 20-player roster. Redinger and several others have already played, and head coach Caryn MacKenzie said the newcomers are sure to make a serious contribution in 2006.

regional. In addition to the high level of talent in the Great Lakes region -which boasted seven teams in the top 30 at last season's NCAA meet -Notre Dame has lost part of the core group of runners that has helped it win three of the last four Big East conference championships, including four top-1 0 finishers in last year's conference championship in The Bronx, N.Y. 
Still, Connelly said if the team can focus on the season­ending races and work toward them, the Irish should suc­

But the gradual increase in training difficulty did not end with the summer as Connelly continued a steady training schedule in the first week of fall practice last week. This year~ practice schedule will be consistently difficult, Connelly said, increasing each runner's ability as the season continues. 
The main reason Connelly does not want to push his team too hard at any single point is to keep Notre Dame competitive for a tough confer­ence and a tough NCAA

and region­als to qualify for the NCAA tournament:" 
Overall, Connelly said he feels this year's team can turn some heads, especially in the Big East. 
After being consistently ranked among the top teams in the NCAA for the past few years, the Irish are now con­sidered average -in part because of the graduation a talented bunch of seniors. 
"This year we're a team that nobody's counting on a whole lot to happen," Connelly said. "We're just going to go out and take our shots."

the Chinese or not, the Irish will be without the two starters for this weekend's games against Southern California and Santa Clara. Bock and Dew are expected to return to the Irish lineup Sept. 8 against TCU. 
"When they come [back] its going to be amazing because they have so much to give to the team," Weissenhofer said. 
While playing without two starters has forced changes to the Irish lineup, senior captain Kim Lorenzen said the extra opportunities for other players will.help later in the season. 
"Right now we're just try­ing to figure out who we have healthy right now and where they're going to play, and we'll have to figure it out when [Bock and Dew] get back," Lorenzen said. "It's exciting knowing we have so many options. 
Lorenzen said Bock and Dew will have to make an adjustment transitioning from their U.S. coaches and teammates to coach Randy Waldrum and the Irish, but it shouldn't be a major prob­lem. 
"I think coming back to any team should be an adjust­ment especially not playing with any of the freshmen," Lorenzen said. "It will be exciting to have them coming back to our team and figur­ing out where people will move position-wise because we have a lot of talent." 
The Trojans, Notre Dame's opponent Friday, will also be missing a player from the 
U.S. team. Forward Amy Rodriguez, who scored a goal against the Germans, 
will not return to the USC lineup until Sept. 8, when the Trojans face Drake. 
While Bock and Dew have kept online diaries, their teammates have had little other contact with them. 
"I don't know if anyone's talked to them," Weissenhofer said. "They're kind of hard to get a hold of because they're in Russia." 
Bock and Dew both start­ed the game against Germany. Dew played the whole contest, and Bock subbed early in the second half. 
The Southern California game will begin at 7:30 p.m. Friday at Alumni Field. The Irish and Broncos will kick off Sunday at 1 p.m. at Alumni Field.

Country calls for Bock, Dew 
Tearn USA advances to semis of U-20 World Championships with help from ND sophs 
By TIM DOUGHERTY and CHRIS KHOREY Sports Writers 
While Notre Dame was winning its first two games last weekend, two of its players were 8,000 miles away, playing for their country. 
And, thanks to Team USA's 4-1 win over Germany Sunday, sophomores Brittany Bock and Carrie Dew will stay in Russia to compete in the Under-20 World Championships until next week. 
With the victory over the Germans, the 
U.S. te"am advanced to the semifinals, where it will face China Thursday. Brazil will play North Korea in the other semifi­nal, also on Thursday. 
Back in South Bend, the sophomores' teammates are rooting for them. 
"Germany was supposed to be a really hard match," freshman forward Michele Weissenhofer said. "Everyone is happy for [Bock and Dew] because they've worked really hard. [Our] team is so close we're not going to make it weird or anything [when they return]. We're going to wel­come them with open arms." 
The semifinal winners will square off Sunday night for the title while the losers will play Sunday afternoon for third place, which means whether the U.S. squad beats

Teatn begins practices vvithout head coach 
Assistant coach Veltri will lead team during search for replacement 
By CHRIS HINE Sporrs Writer 
. Practice opens today as the Irish prepare for next month's Cougar Classic in Charleston, 
S.C. Just one thing is missing -a coach. 
The University announced Monday that Irish coach Debby King resigned after five years, and The Observer reported last Thursday that she would not be retained. 
"All they have told us is that she's not going to be our coach this year," junior golfer Alejandra Diaz-Calderon said. "They told us we would have a new coach soon, and we would like to get some closure in this." 
A search for a new coach is underway, but Notre Dame is in no hurry to find a replace­ment. 
"They said they don't want to rush the procedure because they want to find the right per­son for the job," senior Noriko Nakazaki said. 
Sophomore Lisa Maunu said the team is anxious to hear about its new leader. 
"The overall mood of the team is very positive, yet on edge waiting for a new coach," Maunu said. "It's been stressful not knowing when or who will be ar.~iving to take over the team. 
In the meantime, assistant coach Kyle Veltri has been in charge. 
"Coach Vekri has been amaz­ing.... She has been the back­bone of the team," Diaz­Calderon said. "You can tell she cares about us and about Notre Dame. We would love to have her as our head coach 
and  to  stay  on  no  matter  
what."

The Irish finished strong last season, including a Big East title and a second­place finish in tho Great Lakes regional en route to a seventh-place finish in the NCAA Championship meet. 
But in order to reach those milestones again this year. Notre Dame needs some new runners to Jill the void left after the gradua­tion of live starting runners from last season.
