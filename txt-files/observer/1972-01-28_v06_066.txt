Paris -Replying to the latest eight-point United States Peace Plan, the Vietnamese Communists insisted Thursday at the Paris Peace. Talks that the United States must set a date for total military with­drawal and oust the present Saigon government before there can be a Vietnam Settlement. The reaction fell short of a categorical rejection of the American Plan, which was being formally presented at the talks. 
Tokyo-Japan and the Soviet Union, in a communique issued at the end of a week-long visit to Tlkyo by Andrei Gromyko, the Soviet Foreign Minister, said they would begin negotiations "within this year" toward a peace treaty formally ending the technical state of war between them since World War II. 
Washington-Maurice H. Stans resigned as Secretary of Commerce, and President Nixon nominated Peter G. Peterson, the White House Assistant for International Economic Affairs, as his successor. Stans was expected to move into a top job in Noxon's re-election campaign. 
Zurich -The Federal Bureay of Investigation has been asked by Swiss Law-Enforcement Officials to interview Clifford Irving, the novelist, and his wife in connection with a possible $650,000 fraud, Swiss sources said.

Washington, Jan. 27-Price and wage controls will remain indefinitely until "reasonable price stability can be maintained without controls," President Nixon told congress today. 
"How long that will take," the President said, "no one can say." 
The President made his statement in his economic report to congress, which ac­companies the annual report of the council of economic advisers. 
In their reports the president and the council said essentially the same thing in different ways: controls will be main­tained until Americans stop acting, through such things of labor contracts and business pricing policy, as if inflation were going to be permanent. Thus, the test of the end of controls will be the end of what is called "inflationary psychology." 
Nixon in his brief message again em­phasized that "the great problem" of the economy is to reduce unemployment from its current level of 6 per cent of the labor force. He said he was "determined to reduce that number significantly in 1972." 
In its relatively detailed forcast of the economy, the council put the probable growth of the gross national product this year at $98 billion, or 9.4 per cent, with unemployment declining to "the neigh­borhood" of 5 per cent by the end of the year. The gross national product is the dollar value of all goods and services produced in the country in a year. 

The report said that this picture was "not one of takeoff into a cyclical boom." 
Of the expected total growth, the council said that about 6 percentage points would be "real" and about 3-% points would be a resutl of inflation. The inflation rate will decline as the year progresses, the council said. 
For last year, 2.7 points of the growth in the gross product was considered "real" and 4.7 points was attributed to inflation. 
The forecast emphasized a number of "unvertainties," and noted the ad­ministration's "readiness to take ad­ditional steps" if necessary to bring about the projected expansion in output and jobs. However, the report said, "the possibility that, with the policy now in place, the economy will rise even more rapidly than we foresee today is a strong reason for not seeking to stimulate the economy more now.'' 
In two important respects, the forecast was relatively conservative. It projected no reduction in the recent unusually high rate of consumer saving, and thus did not rely upon a booming burst of consumer spending. 


at Paris sessions 
by Bernard Gwertzman <Cl 1!172 New York Times 
Washington, Jan. 27--Secretary of State William P. Rogers said today that despite Hanoi's public denunciations, he was "somewhat encouraged" by the absence of a North Vietnamese rejection of the Paris talks. 
Offering an optimistic assessment of the gi~e and take at the Paris session, Rogers said that not only had the enemy not rejected the eight-point plan, made public by Nixon on Tuesday night, but "they have been asking a few questions about what we mean." 
Rogers said that he had just spoken by phone with ambassador William Porter, the head of the American delegation to the Paris talks, who gave him a briefing on today's session at which he outlined Nixon's peace plan. The plan had first been offered privately to the North Viet­namese by Henry A. Kissinger, the President's National Security Affairs adviser, in October. 
The Secretary spoke to a national foreign policy conference for editors and broadcasters organized by the State department. Newsmen and news executives from 40 states were at the department for the start of the two-day session. 
In answer to a question, Rogers said it was natural to inquire if the ad­ministration's disclosure of the secret eight-point plan would "speed up or delay the possibilities of a negotiated set­tlement." 
"My own view is that if there is any inclination at all on the part of the other side to negotiate a settlement--and I think that is in doubt--then the statement by the President of the other night, which was so effective, and I think will have the effect of unifying the American people. And if they are convinced of that, I think they will be more inclined to work out a negotiated settlement," he said. 
Reporting on today's Paris session, he said: 
"I am somewhat encouraged by the fact that they have not rejected our proposal in Paris this morning. There has been a good deal of invective about it, but it hasn't been rejected" 
"And secondly, they have been asking a few questions about what we mean, and how could they be sure that the electoral process would be fair." 
"Now , that is a good sign," he said. 
"That is exactly what negotiations are supposed to do, supposed to provide an opportunity for each side to ask the other, 'What do you mean?' "he added. 
Continuing to enlarge on this theme, Rogers said: "Now, if they should get that frame of mind, so that they want to ac­tually negotiate, that would be fine. It is possible that we could work out a set­tlement. It is a perfectly natural question for them to say 'well, how can we be sure that the election will be fair?' Now, it seems to me we have to say, 'well, what do you want to do to provide fairness?' " he said. 
Asked to provide more detail on Rogers' reference to North Vietnamese "questions," a state department official later said that at the Paris talks, the communist side "asked directly or rhetorically, some interesting questions." 
"The questions were couched in criticism, or hostile language," he said. "They seemed to focus on two subjects: do we contemplate a total withdrawal, and how do we define a total withdrawal, and they were poking around the edges of the electoral process: how did we define it; what did it involve?" 
The officials said that this was "something of a departure from the past," although another informed source said that questions on those subjects have been asked before. 
Rogers's apparent optimism about the Paris talks was in contrast to widespread skepticism in Washington diplomatic circles about the prospects for a 1wgotiated settlement.

Ackerman makes response to SBP letter 
Claiming that the Security and Traffic Advisory Board has been examining security from every viewpoint since it's inception, Chairman Robert Ackerman, assistant Dean of Students, defended the board's record in reply to questions raised by SBP John Barke.tt in a letter dated November 30th. The letter was released this week. 
"I write this letter in the hopes that the Security Advisory Board will stir into action 1Jfter nearly eight montlis have passed since the Board w~ approved by the Officers Council," Barkett wrote.

Messbarger announces SMC 1noratoriu1n on facuity tenure 
The St. Mary's administration had delayed indefinitely any tenuring of Saint Mary's faculty 
due to the "uncertalntiy of the future" of Saint Mary's College, according to a letter the ad­ministration sent to SMC faculty members. 
Contents of the letter was made public Tuesday by Assistant Professor Paul Messbarger. 
According to Messbarger, SMC called the tenure and promotion "moratorium" because St. Mary's will have few students and consequently fewer faculty members if the merger between them and Notre Dame does not go through. 
Messbarger speculated that if the merger were to come about the Notre Dame administration 
might  not  accept  the  tenure  
status  of  St.  Mary's  faculty  
members.  

In a previous agreement between ND and SMC all tenure earned prior to May, 1971 would have been honored by Notre Dame provided the merger camtt off by September, 1972. However due to the merger's recent 
NWPC meets to discuss role in city elections 
by Susan Prendergast 
The National Women's Political Caucus will hold its first South Bend meeting on Tuesday, February 3, at 7:30p.m. in the Public Library Auditorium. 
According to NWPC worker Iris DiGrazia, the organization's main objectives are to "Help women run for political office" and to "educate women to realize that this field is open to them." 
The NWPC also hopes to "pressure politicians already in office to concentrate on women­orientated areas, such as day care centers, abortion legislation, discrimination in hiring and wages, Ms. DiGrazia asserted. 
Ms. Jane McMichaels, a for­mer WSBT newscaster now working for the national organization in Washington, initiated the local chapter last year. 
Ms. DiGrazia contended that the group's local plans will in­clude placing "more women on Mayor Miller's administration and working on abortion in the state." 

nearly a month now and still show no concrete movement is pitiful," Barkett continued. 
The SBP called for the board to consider -a human relations program for the security office, Red Cross training for all campus security guards, removal of inequities involving traffic fines and a possible lowering of the student parking fees. 
Ackerman said that, delays in appointing members to the board, and the members own petty gripes, such as individual 
parking tickets, hindered its' work. Board members are, he asserted, enthusiastic over their work and have been working 
cancellation and renegotiation, it is uncertain whether Notre Dame would continue to honor this agreement, Messbarger said. 
According to Messbarger if Notre Dame and St. Mary's cannot agree on the merger St. Mary's might award tenure to faculty members after specifing that the contract would be ter­minal. The English Professor did say that members of the St. Mary's faculty would "have a hand" in drawing up any such contract. 
Messbarger asserted that the 
delay in awarding tenure is 
necessary now because the future 
of St. Mary's is "up in the air."

Barkett called for "concrete movement" on the part of the STAB but Ackerman noted that what mjght be called "concrete movement" is not within the realm of the STAB. He said that the purpose of the board was only to recommend changes, not to implement policy. A traffic study is being done by one of the Board members and a meeting is scheduled today with Security Director Arthur Pears to discuss 
the  suggestions  outlined  in  
Barkett's letter.  
A  complete  investigation  of  

Security and appropriate 

recommendations was promised 
by Ackerman in time for the J 
publication of next year's student manuaf. 
One of STAB's basic intentions is to change the human relations involved in security according to Ackerman. A primary objective is to develop a healthy attitude betwee~ students and security, the assistant Dean of Students said. 
Security is a service to the community, Ackerman com­mented and reactions would greatly improve if that were understood. He asked for any 
'\

suggestions members of the community might have in the areas of traffics and security be submitted to him in writing.

Nixon gains in Florida race 
by James Reston 

(c) 1!172 New York Times 
Sarasota, Fla.---President Nixon's account of his secret efforts to negotiate a peace in Indochina has clearly helped him in the Florida presidential primary election campaign, and embarassed· the leading Democratic candidates for the presidency. 
His peace terms are extremely complicated, but what stands out in the shorthand of stump campaigning is that he offered to withdraw all his troops if he got all U.S. prisoners of war released---and that this was rejected by Hanoi and the National Liberation Front. 
Accordingly, Muskie, Hum­phrey, McGovern, and Lindsay, when they point to the critical conditions which are basic to the President's peace terms, find themselves caught in a tangle of complex and ambiguous qualifications, and even in danger of seeming to be sym­pathetic to the enemy. 
Ironically, it is not the press here but the families of the American prisoners of war who have cut to the heart of this issue and made clear that Nixon is demanding, not only the release of the P.O.W.'s, but the neutralization of all of Indochina, the end of all infiltration by foreign troops <are the South Vietnamese Communists "foreign" in South Vietnam?), a cease-fire and an election process which is virtually certain to restore the Thieu government to power in Saigon. 
For example, Mrs. Gerald A. Gartley of Dunedin, Fla., whose Navy Lieutenant son, Mark Gartley, was shot down over North Vietnam in August of 1968, observed here that while Nixon was obviously trying to free the P.O.W.'s, the safety of the Thieu government and Nixon's own presidential future were also apparently important con­siderations and may even have "come first." 
This, of course, cannot be anything more than Mrs. Gar­tley's personal speculation (nobody but the president knows which of his conditions come first l. But several things are fairly clear: 
1. 
Both sides in the war have now put forward specific terms of peace unacceptable to the other side. 

2. 
Hanoi and the N.L.F. are asking the President not only to get out of Indochina but to take all his equipment with him, in­cluding the equipment now in the 


hands of the South Vietnamese, and stop future military aid to Saigon. Dr. Kissinger has fairly characterized this as a demand that Washington abandon Saigon and, in effect, overthrow the Thieu government. 
3. At the same time, Nixon is demanding that the enemy give up the positions it has gained by years of fighting in South Viet­nam, Laos, and Cambodia, and accept a cease-fire just at the time when the enemy is mounting an offensive and U.S. ground troops are withdrawing. 
It is clear that Wathington is 
NEWS ANALYSIS 

not going to abandon Saigon under what amounts to a demand for Saigon's surrender, and that Hanoi and the N.L.F. are not going to order a cease-fire and abandon military positions they have won in the last 10 years at the cost of millions of lives. 
So the stalemate continues. Nixon has clearly made con­cessions for peace---which deserve a better hearing than Hanoi and the N.L.F. have given them---and has finally clarified the major political and military issues in dispute, but his publication of these terms, while they relieve him of the charge that he was not even considering a final withdrawal of all U.S. troops, introduce other conditions known to him to be unacceptable to the enemy. 
In fact, by impressing public opinion in this country by his persistent effort to negotiate a 
secret agreement, he has un­
doubtedly gained support for 
stepping up the bombing against 
the enemy's forthcoming 
military offensive. 
Thus the outlook is not for less 
fighting but for a more savage 
battle during the coming dry 
season, and while Nixon has 
undoubtedly gained politically in 
the short run, he has now com­
mitted himself to a course of 
action and a set of unacceptable 
peace terms which have revived 
the Vietnam issue in the 
presidential election campaign, 
which still has over nine months 
to go. 
During the long and sharp debate that lies ahead, the President, if he sticks to his present peace terms and war aims, will be asking the American people to continue fighting, not only for the release of the American prisoners of war­--which nobody opposes--but for the maintenance of his ally in Saigon, for the neutralization of all of Indochina, and for democracy in a country where the word has little meaning. 
Here in Florida, his com­plicated peace terms will be a good political issue at least until the primary voting on March 14, but thereafter, when his military and political terms are finally analyzed and widely understood, they may well be seen not as a means to peace, but as a cause for continuing the war. And by November, that might not be a very popular argument for re­election.

Barkett said he favors the first plan. 
The decision is scheduled to be handled at an election committee meeting, probably held next Thursday after the 7pm Senate meeting. This also is tentative. 
Barkett and Stay Senators Jim Clarke, Don Patrick and Bob Sauer also considered two other questions: The InPIRG petition to add an optional fee to the students' University bill for InPIRG operations and the problem of mandatory vs.. op­tional telephone installation. 
lnPIRG plans to circulate a petition in order to gain approval discussion here concerned the percentage of student approval needed. This also was relegated to the Senate for action. 
The crux of the telephone problem is whether or not to make them optional, thus allowing a student who does not use the phone much to escape paying the fee. 
However, this would also in­volve the removal and in­stallation of phones every time the occupant of the room changes residence, and it was unanimously felt that this could be a needless burdern.

The Best Man 
This coming June the exalted post of Vice-President for Student Affairs will fall vacant. The incumbent, Rev. Thomas E. Blantz is a decent man. He is a learned historian who seems distinctly uncomfortable in an ad­ministrative position. Teaching is his first duty and with his resignation he is returning to it. That, we feel, is a very good decision, good for Fr. Blantz and good for the students. Itis patently unwise for a man to stay on in a position he no longer desires and patently unfair to the students whom he oversees. 
A search committee has been formed, a search committee with a token student, Student Body President John Barkett. They will, in the next months, be scouring the nation for a man to fill the position. The possibility that the annointed one will be a Holy Cross Priest is a strong one, but finding that priest will be a very difficult task. 
It will be difficult not simply because a good administrator is needed, Notre Dame has an adequate supply of men who can riffle papers with the brst of them, but because they will be looking for a man who has the rare gift of courage. They will be looking for aman who can look beyond his administrative problems and percieve the problems that haunt the lives of so many Notre Dame students and then strike out boldly and forcefully to effect solutions to them. To move boldly and forcefully doesn't require an extraordinary amount of courage, it requires imagination, and drive and confidence. To move boldly and forcefully in the face of opposition, opposition from superiors, such as the exalted Provost of this University does require courage. 
The search committee cannot make the mistake of choosing a weak man for the position. They cannot choose a man who will bow to pressure easily. They cannot choose such a man because if they do they will be cheating the students. They will be cheating the students because a weak man will tender no opposition to a priest who has never and probably will never have the interests of the students at heart--the Provost. 
A strong Vice President for Student Affairs nay not 'be enough of a deterrent to the Provost's often heavy handed tactics. He may not be able to turn the Provost's thoughts from preoccupation with sawdust in the halls. But if he is a strong man, if he is an honest man, if he is a decent man then perhaps he will be able to prevent the Provost from reigning supreme. And that would be a very good thing. 
The search committee should make every effort to find their candidate from the members of this university. They should make every effort to find a man who will not be hopelessly vexed by administrative problems, a man who knows the students of this school, a man who believes in the students of this school. Whether this man be priest or lay makes little difference--a human being's inherent worth is not strengthened or diminished when he puts on a collar. 
The Vice-President for Student Affairs is one of those jobs where it's 
scope and bounds are determined largely by the man who occupys it. Itis 
a difficult job, a demanding job, but rewarding. The search committee's 
task will be a difficult one, difficult because of the Provost and difficult 
because of the impending merger. But it is a job that must be done and 
done well.

The current Ralph Nader sponsored controversy over the increase in the price support level for milk is an excellent example of how political financing influences bad economic policy. 
Nader contends that the dairy industry cajoled a price support in­crease from the Nixon administration by making large campaign contributions to dummy Republican committees. The financial requirements of a modern campaign prevent consumers from in­fluencing policy in a similar manner. Deprived of this power, the buyer frequently gets blasted by the very kind of program the milk price controversy represents. 
Farm products in general exhibit a property which economists call price inelastic. This means that over the relevant range of prices the amount of corn (or milk) sold will vary only a small amount. Because the quantity of milk produced in a given year is also roughly constant, farm owners are faced with very flexible yearly incomes if the price of their wares takes an unexpected shift during the time when they are unable to vary the supply. The policy of price supports was developed to stabilize the income of small farmers who, before World War II, constituted the bulk of the farming industry. 
Now that the professional dairy farmer constitutes the over­whelming percentage of the industry, the price support system merely improves these farmers' profits without really having any over­whelmingly humane purpose. Price supports create an artificial shortage of milk by preventing all the milk produced from being sold at actual market price. Supports only work if the support price is in excess of the market price. Then, the government enters the market and buys all the milk which consumers have chosen not to purchase at the artificially high price. Because dairy farmers are only lining their pockets with the extra profits generated by the support price, it is clearly not in the consumers' interest to allow this policy to continue. 
If, as Nader contends, the dairy industry was able to muster an extra $322,500 for the Nixon campaign fund the current milk price must not be causing abject poverty for the tightly organized dairy farmers. Unfortunately consumers, as an organized "special in­terest" group wield no such financial power. This leaves only two options. Either private financing of political campaigns must discontinue or consumer!' must organize their own special interest groups. 
The first option is the better of the two. Publically financed cam­paigns free the individual candidates from the pressures of returning promises which they have made in order to secure their campaign funds. The Congress approved a plan which would have created publically financed campaigns but, predictably, the rich Republicans <read: Nixon) sent it back to wallow for a few more years while they collect some debts that are past due. 
In the absence of the preferable option the importance of consumer oriented special interest groups can't be over emphasized. The only really potent consumer groups are the Consumer's Union and the collective Public Interest Research Groups. Nader is organizing another group, The Public Citizen, PC's principle objective is to build for consumer's the same kind of informal political influence that special interests like the dairy industry currently enjoy. Ifonly 100,000 people contribute the yearly ten dollar dues, PC will have an annual lobby fund of one million dollars. Only the American Medical Association has spent more money than this lobbying in one year. Granted that a consumer oriented group won't eliminate the problem of special interest lobbies but as a counter-action to the faculty ploicies sponsored by groups like the dairy association, PC is one of the few realistic choices.

Wrenched Connection: Tragedy 1n one act 
MOVIE REVIEW: 
AVAILABLE AT A STUDENT DISCOUNT THE WRENCHED CONNECTION AT THE CRYPT. <A FARCE, A MYSTERY, A THRILLER: NOW PLAYING ON CAMPUS SPONSORED BY THE ND-SMC 
I first heard of "The Wrenched Con­BOARDS OF TRUSTEES) nection" back in December; it had just 

STARRING: come out and everyone was talking about SISTER ALMA PETER it. Long before I set foot in the theatre I MOTHER OLIVETTE WHALEN had been primed with comments that the SISTER GERALD HARTNEY flick was "a real shocker, full of sexism 
f<~DMUND STEPHAN and violence" and it was observed by some FATHER THEODORE HESBURGH that t~ey . coul~n't understand how ...AND A CAST OF APPROXIMATELY somethmg hke _this could ever be made. 
Nevertheless, It was and I set out to

8000 
discover for myself just what all the fussing was about.

PHODUCED AND DIRECTED BY: 'Incensed' hardly suffices to describeTHE ND-SMC BOARDS OF TRUSTEES the reaction of the audience which was<SEPAHATELY, OF COURSE)

ST. MARY'S" AND THE "FIGHT BACK" SONG II(<~ARD AT THE BEGINNING 
worse." AND THE END OF THIS FILM ARE So did the whispering around the theatre 
as the film progressed. The most 
frequently asked question seemed to be, 
"What's going on?" 
The film's major flaw was the non-plot 
which no one was able to follow; this was 
extremely annoying. Several aspects 
contradicted themselves. Dialogue was 
contrived and cliche-ridden (e.g. "There is 
no reason why St. Mary's should suffer," 
expostulates Sister Gerald in one heart­
rending scene), and the characters were 
little better than animated robots. In all, 
the audience was left confused throughout 
and, finally, insulted. 
Photography, in a futile attempt to project "inner meaning" into the film and lend it some artistic value (which it sorely lacked) falls flat. The secret board of trustees meeting scenes are rather hard on the eyes as they were shot through keyholes, producing a collective squint from the audience. 
Th~ acting was, to put it bluntly, atrocious and unforgiveable. Sister Alma Peter, who plays the acting-up president, in reality doesn't do much acting. She bungles her lines occasionally and reveals a noticeable stage fright. Sister Gerald and Mother Olivette make only cameo appearances, but nevertheless show themselves to be uncomfortable in front of cameras. Edmund Stephan doesn't ap­pear at all. Fr. Hesburgh's suave reputation suffers as we are disappointed by his lofty but nebulous commentary. 
However, some individuals do deserve commendation. Kathy Barlow, who utilizes her dynamic role to its fullest, will certainly be heard from in the future. John Barkett provides adequate but hesitant support. Nancy Christopher's ad Jibs sparkle and some were so good they reportedly had to be edited out! 
Is "The Wrenched Connection" a film worth seeing'? For $1900, it isn't. However, you can decide that for yourself­-it's being held over for the second big month (and supposedly last) right here on campus. If you like movies that combine the shock impact of a "Psycho," the prevarication and equivocation of a Nixon speech, the touching moments of a "Love Story," and a plot equivalent to "Last Summer," then this could be the one for you. 
Tomorrow's featured flick will be "Gidget goes to Notre Dame (but gets her degree from St. Mary's)." 

Tom Bornholdt 
French Connection: Priceless 
For the first one half hour, the intelligent 
viewer watching The French Connection 
will probably be disappointed. After 
hearing about what a great movie it is, the 
viewer may find this flick just a cinema 
version of the old TV series, NYPD. 
l<'or about half an hour. 
The l<,rench Connection begins to grow on the viewer. The plot remains difficult to follow, but soon the observing eye learns to focus more on character and setting. It is only after the setting and characters have been firmly etched in the audience's mind, does the plot build up momentum. Soon it's travelling at such a pace that the adrenalin glands have a challenge on their hands. The chase scene is one of the great moments in American motion pictures, and is in itself, worth shelling out three bucks for. 
To dismiss the film as mere escapism however, is to do it the ultimate injustice, for it is far deeper than that. The person who has just been watching the "action" of the film is not going to fully appreciate the l'nding. The reason why the detai!s of the plot are hard to follow, is that the essential theme does not require the viewer's om­niscience. The NY I'D type realism serves not as a platform for a misanthropic script writer, but is necessary for both characterization and setting. 
It is impossible to understand The French Connection without first grokking its central character, Sergeant Doyle. Doyle is a New York City narc, and is originally presented in the Tough Cop cliche. Certain things are quickly noted about Doyle. First, fighting drugs has become more than a job for Doyle, it is purpose in life. Secondly, Doyle is plebian, bordering on Philistine. He is shown drunk, the film not too subtly trying to compare alcohol with the drugs he abhors. Tough Cop's sexual morality is in­significant to thirteen decimal places. His language is perpetually profane and crude. "Shove it up your ass" is Doyle attempting to be sophisticated. 
The similarities between Doyle and "Joe" strikes one early in the picture. In my case, I dropped the idea towards the end, only to have it brought back by the events of the picture's end. The viewer should make his own decision on this matter, but I should mention one im­portant contrast. Doyle must be con­sidered as a far stronger character than "Joe". The former is both cunning and daring in the face of danger, the later was inevitably presented as a wolf let loose in a pack of lambs. 
Doyle's problem in the film, is that he switches his opponents from the small time pushers to the wealthy people who get heroin into America. Together with Sexy Partner, Tough Cop uses a "lead" in order to fight those trying to sell a shipment of "horse". Doyle encounters more resistance than he is used to. The criminals eventually hire an assassin to snipe at Doyle. Doyle shows enough toughness to cut diamonds --violence is part of the city and he can handle violence better than his foes. 
But Doyle runs up against something with which he is unable to cope. Charnier, the Frenchman, is a true man of culture and class. Charnier comes from a background alien to Doyle, a background of sophistication and intelligence. 
The basic conflict of the story is between Doyle and Charnier. All other characters are secondary. Frustrated by a being beyond his understanding, Doyle lets the battle consume him. To say anything more, would be to deprive potential viewer's of a worthwhile experience. 
Acting is superb. Photography isn't pretty, but it wasn't supposed to be. 
Rather one comes away from the French Connection with a real sense of what a zoo New York City really is <but a fascinating zoo at that). A movie that is as exciting and as intelligent as The French Con­nection is rare and priceless gem. 

Last Grasp Film Series 
The St. Mary's Last Grasp Film Series has miraculously succeeded the Last Gasp. The rapidity and mystery of campus events makes coining accurate titles for our series difficult, but it is clear that St. Mary's is being grasped for, whoever the graspers may be. We tried to organize a naming contest, and the few entries we received included Phoenix Film Series, Health-Related Cinema and SMC Get-It­While-You-Can Movies. The winner received 2 season tickets, a trip to Niles and a recording of the last true and clear statement made by the administrations and Trustees regarding merger. 
We're offering 19 first-rate films. The opener was Bergman's "Wild Strawberries". On Jan. 28 perhaps the best film of the series, Resnais' "LaGuerre est f<'inie", shows. starring Yves Montand, Ingrid Thulin and Genvieve Bujold. The story is of an aging revolutionary trying to make sense of his loyalty to Spain and his love while caught in the abstractions of exile in Paris. The screenwriter is Jorge Semprun, who also did "Z" and "The Confession". "Cat and Mouse" (2-4), from Gunter Grass' novel, tells of a precocious adolescent coming of age in Nazi Ger­many.

RAP needs help 
Anyone who has felt down knows what a drag it is not to have anyone to talk to. The Rap Center at 209 Western Avenue hopes to provide an open at­mosphere in which people can communicate about their problems. 
The center is a storefront and phone operation open from lOAM to 2AM every day. It provides experienced help with drug problems from drug iden­tification to bum tips. The referral system can direct people to a variety of free services such as draft counseling, pregnancy and abortion help, medical and psychiatric aid. Anyone can drop in or call to talk about whatever is on his mind. 
At this time volunteers are desperately needed to help staff the center. As a staff person one deals with a variety of social problems and works closely with a tight collective. 

In order to join the staff each trainee must come to the center for a short informative interview. 
Applicants must take a twenty­h6ur course run by center per­~onnel which lasts two weeks. Staff members and professionals will lead discussions on drugs, law, personality, reality therapy; there will be role-playing of day­to-day crises seen at the center. After completion of the training course several weeks of on-the­job work must be completed before the regular staff may vote a trainee on to the staff. 
The next training session for the Rap Center will begin on Monday, January 31. Anyone interested in working there should come down in person or call the center at 289-7986.

"Lord of the Flies", after the Golding novel plays on Apr. 7, makes the anti-war films look like child's play, so to speak. To balance such somber fare, the Last Grasp offers "The Wrong Box" on April 14, starring Peter Sellers, Michael Caine, Ralph Richardson, and others. Some critics claim it was more fun than a barrel of monkeys. "The Overcoat" (4-21) from Gogol's story is one of the best films of this or any series. The dignity and fragility of a man were never clearer. "Member of the Wedding," starring Julie Harris, directed by Stanley Kramer, plays Apr. 28. It's based on Carson McCuller's tender play about an awkward and lonely girl caught between childhood and adolescence. Our last film is "Playboy of the Western World" on May 5. The great Irish actress Siobhan McKenna stars in this screening of Synge's play.

I concur, but ... 

Editor: 
While I concur (although for different reasons) in your sup­port of Dean Shaffer's expansion plan for the Law School, I must take exception to your rather disparaging statement regarding the quality of the school's student body and faculty both of which you believe must be "sharply upgraded". 
We law students have learned that, in constructing a case or an appeal, FACTS are the all­important commodity. Any conclusion which can not be objectively and expressly sup­ported by concrete facts will be torn apart much to the em­barrassment of the party ren­dering the unsubstantiated conclusion. Thus, we learn: if one can not speak with the objective knowledge that will support his conclusion, it is better not to speak at all. 
All of this is by way of suggesting that your comment regarding the caliber of the Law School's constituency is entirely unwarranted and unfounded and thus should not have been printed. To support my con­clusion I give you the following facts: 
1. 
This year's entering class of approximately 140 students had an average LSAT score of 620 and an average Q.P.I. of 3.35-does this indicate a low quality student? 

2. 
Of those already accepted for the entering class in the Fall of 1972, the average LSAT score is 645 while the average Q.P .I. is 3.45-does thisFACT substantiate your alleged need for a "sharply upgraded" student body? 

3. 
In the last seven years three 


(3) Notre Dame Law Graduates have been appointed clerks to the United States Supreme Court ­surely this is a record to be lauded not maligned. 
4. Regarding the faculty, their record speaks for itself. These professionals are well respected attorneys, authors and educators. They are admired by those who know the law and are far above your uninformed reproach. 
May I suggest, therefore, that you learn from those who you so freely attack-be able to support your conclusions with facts rather than injudiciously allege conclusions incapable of verification.

Another Man's Opinion 

Editor: 
Although it would be relatively easy to respond to the eight specific "contentions" of Mr. Hartzer and the executive board of the Student Bar Association (concerning the "law school addition" announced today), I feel that a more general criticism is warranted. Namely: < 1 l In purporting to be a "representative" body of the law school community, the SBA should have waited until after the results of Fridays referendum before issuing any statements in our behalf. 
(2) Dean Shaffer's factually substantiated and well reasoned decision honestly appears to be the ONLY realistic choice <although not idealistic) when confronted with the universally adniitt~d need for a prompt a_ltera_bon of our physical plant
situation. <3) Most importantly, I take issue 
Friday, January 28, 1972 
on editorials~.

 
"Goodbye, Sister Alma." The editorial may be reduced to this syllogism: 
Anyone who opposes the 
merger (or should I say sub­
Merger) of St. Mary's 
College, with the University 
of Notre Dame, must go. 
But Sister Alma, Acting 
President of St. Mary's 
College, (apparently) has 
opposed this merger. 
Therefore she must go. 
In the first place, the editorial is immature and it is difficult to answer immaturity with reason. It is a good example of what Ayn Rand terms an "escape for the necessity of rational perception." 
Secondly, it contains a vicious attack (I would say almost an insult> leveled at Sister Alma who has stood fast in her con­victions under great pressure from the University of Notre Dame and from a vociferous group of students on both sides of the highway. 
Thirdly, the editorial is another lerfect example of the rigidity, iogmatism and re-actionism of :he liberal left which is self­righteous and omniscent. 
Fourth, I believe this editorial requires a public apology, by the person who wrote it, to a great, learned, experienced and knowledgeable Sister of the Holy Cross who, in a most difficult position, has refused to budge from what she sincerely believes is the right and correct course to follow according to the spirit of our Founder and the wholesome traditions of the Congregation of Holy Cross, to say nothing of the mind of the Church. (Cf. Vatican II "Perfectae Caritatis") 
Fifth, this editorial exhibits a complete lack of diplomacy and finesse and, consequently has set up a great obstacle to the merger <if this is ever to take place) of these two institutions of higher learning and, therefore, has defeated its purpose. This is a vindictive not a constructive editorial.

with the implicit presupposition of the SBA's contentions. Im­puting "good faith" to all con­cerned, to purport that the opinion of a few three year transients is better or more concerned than that of a highly competent and sensitive professional who has dedicated his career to Notre Dame Law School is egotistically naive! ! !

Your attempt to bury Sr. Alma shows many of the weaknesses that have become trademarks of Observer editorials. It is snide, in poor taste, and immaturely written. It seeks to find a simple solution---hopefully with a con­venient villian---for the complex problems of Notre Dame and St. Mary's. 
Admittedly, Sr. Alma's ad­ministration has been a difficult one and there were many problems in it that could have been averted. But that does not grant license to flaunt rudeness and porrly considered opinions. 
Perhaps if the editorials were 
the responsibility of an editorial students by one fifth may require admission decisions detrimental to the kind of "quality" which does not automatically ac­company high LSAT scores and grade point averages. 

Concerning the faculty, it is at least possible that faculty members at law schools, often working for considerably less money than is available in legal practice, may be attracted and retained by the prospect of ex­cellent office and research facilities, a student-faculty ratio that allows time for pursuit of their own interests, an auditorium in which to hold lectures, symposia, and so forth, as well as outstanding students. There is considerable disagreement as to whether "the ideal plan" can respond to these needs. 
Finally, the design of the ad­dition itself, according to persons with considerably more ar­chitectural expertise than myself, is a disaster, consisting basically of a library addition and lots of cosmetic and costly alterations. Rather than the client (i.e. the Law School) telling the architect what is needed and desired, the architect has presented the client with the product.

It's Unanimous 

l<~ditor: 
I have been asked to call the following to your attention: 
It was recommended that it 
be made a matter of record 
that the administrative team 
as a group object strenuously 
to the editorial on Sister 
Alma (January 21 issue of 
The Observer) and condemn 
it utterly as unchristian, 
inhuman, and un­
professional. 
A motion was made and 
seconded that the above statement be sent to The Ob­server for publication. The motion carried unanimously. 
Sincerely yours, Sister M. Haphaelita, C.S.C. 
Br. Kieran Cold on Ice Boxes 
(The following is a letter sent to Brother Kieran Ryan, Assistant Vice-President for Business Affairs by Ray DeCarlo and Jim Schnied. The letter in the middle was sent to DeCarlo by a professional engineer.--ed.) 
Dear Brother Kieran Ryan, 
As you know the university fines students $30.00 for having a refrigerator. You have told me that the reason for the fine is to stop the proliferation of refrigerators, because this proliferation (of refrigerators and appliances with high power consumption l overloads the hall wiring and in some cases the power lines feeding the halls. Hall rewiring costs upwards of $50,000.00; installing new feed lines averages $10,000.00 per hall. It would seen then that the fine serves two purposes: 1) to deter students from purchasing or renting refrigerators and 2) to help defray the cost of hall rewiring. With approximately 1000 refrigerators on campus, the univeristy receives $30,000.00 in funds. 
First consider the word fine. A fine is "a sum imposed for punishment of an offence." 
Students are fined for having a refrigerator. No university regulation bans refrigerators. In fact the university approved APO's refrigerator rental project. In point I question the use of the word fine. 
Secondly consider the following letter which describes a study made on the Mini-Kool refrigerator: 
Dear Mr. DeCarlo: 
At your request I have run tests from September 28 to October 2, 1971 on the refrigerator unit that you submitted to me. 
I believe the per­formance is quite satisfactory. The power consumption averages about 43 watts; the motor and compressor run 54 percent of the time and draw 80 watts when run­ning. This would cost about two cents a day. For comparison, it is about one­fifth the power con­sumption of a typical small color T.V. 
This unit draws about four times rated current !from 4.2 to 4.7 amps at about :120 watts l on star­ting, but this drops in less than one half second to near operating level. Thirty or forty of these in a hall should have little more effect on power failure than a dozen more 100-watt light bulbs. 
If I can be of further service to you, please contact me. 
Arthur J. Quigley Professional Engineer Indiana 05451 
This letter shows that the Mini­Kool unit consumes little power. Therefore one cannot construe it as a cause of power line overload. Moreover, most modern units whose capacity is less than 3 cu. ft. are similar to the mini-Kool unit. The cost of the electricity consumed is less that $5.00 for a nine month period.

Little more than a month ago, the UCLA Bruins met Notre Dame in a nationally televised 
night game in Pauley Pavilion. The defending NCAA champions crushed the Irish, 114-56, and the game was little more than a display of UCLA's devastating abilities. 
At 3:40 tomorrow afternoon, Notre Dame and UCLA will again meet in a nationally televised game. The casts will be the same. But the set will be different--it will be Notre Dame's Athletic and Convocation Center. And Irish coach Digger Phelps is hoping for more than a change in the set. He's also hoping for a change in the script. 
But before Phelps' 3-9 squad can even begin to worry about the Bruins, they must face 9-3 Illinois at 9:15 tonight <CST) in Chicago Stadium. 
"We aren't looking ahead to UCLA at all," said Phelps. "We're taking them one by one, and right now we're concerned with Illinois. They're a good team, and we want to beat them." 
The Irish, who dropped a 69-66 overtime decision to the Illini last year, have good reason to respect their opponents from Champaign Despite injury problems, the Illinois roster is dotted with impressive talent, and the lllini will try to beat the Irish by relying on that part of their game. 
"They'll want to try to beat us with their talent," said Pehlps .. "They'll probably press us, and they'll try to get inside and beat us on the boards. We'll just have to go out after them, and we'll have to try to stay with our game plan." 
Most of Illinois' scoring talent comes from the duo of 6-6 for­ward Nick Weatherspoon (averaging 19.1) and 6-9 center Bill Morris 06.2). Forward Nick Connor is averaging 12.2, and guards Jim Krelle and Larry Cohen are hitting at clips of 15.0 and 4.2 respectively. 
But the Illinois coaches are not without their respect, either. "They (Notre Dame) do some things in their press that have bothered us this season" ad­mitted Illini coach Harv Schmidt. "They have been humiliated a

Notre Dame and St. Mary's students may purchase tickets for this weekend's hockey games between Notre Dame and Wisconsin for only one dollar, Notre Dame ticket manager, Don Bouffard, announced yesterday.

the tempo of the game at both ends of the floor. Walton is good for more than 14 rebounds a game, and Wilkes and Swen Nater, a 6-11 reserve, are averaging 7.9 and 6.5 respec­tively. 
On defense, the Bruins employ a press of their own, and they employ it with predictable results. Notre Dame's chances against such offensive and defensive prowess are not good, but Digger Phelps is not ready to give up--not by any means. 
"We've got to hope for better shooting," he said, "both from the line and from the field. We had a good night the other night against Marquette's press--we only had 10 turnovers--and I hope we can keep that up, too. 
''Our kids l,lre developing confidence in themselves. They're beginning to believe in the system, and tl-tey're playing well as a team. We're improving steadily, and one of these days we're going to upset someone." 
But, despite Digger's con­fidence, the chances of an Irish upset this weekend are fairly slim. And come Saturday af­ternoon they'll be slimmest of all. 

-Compliments of a friend 
couple of times, but they are a young team and are making progress with the press." 
The subject of humiliation will 

be very much on the minds of 
both the Irish players and the 
Irish fans on Saturday, when 
John Wooden, Bill Walton, Henry 
Bibby, and the rest of the UCLA 
squad make their appearance in 
the Convocation Center. 
The Irish may have the in­centive factor going for them in this game, but that, along with the home-floor advantage, will be about the only plusses they'll be able to claim. UCLA is currently 14-Q, and the Bruins have been busy since their December romp against Notre Dame. 
They've won nine games since then, and were threatened in only one. The scare came against Oregon State, a team which gave the Bruins all they could handle before finally yielding, 78-72. 
But that has been the only scare, and UCLA has most recently polished off Santa Clara (92-57) and Denver (108-61). John Wooden, as low-key as ever after his team's 13th and 14th wins, would only say that: "I was well pleased with our play over the past weekend in most all respects." 
The Irish will get a brief chance to scout UCLA Friday night, for the Bruins are also tabbed to play in the Stadium. They will meet Loyola of Chicago at 7:30 <CST) in the first half of the scheduled double-header. 
"We'll have to play them the same way we did last time," said Phelps, as he considered his team's chances against the Bruins. "We'll just have to score more points than we did last time, and we'll have to try to hold them down. We'll have to try to contain them. 
"But the thing about UCLA," he admitted, "is that they have eight or nine great ballplayers. If one of them is off, that's not going to help us at all--because someone else will just pick up the slack. We're hoping we can catch them on a day when they're all off." 
Catching all of the Bruins on an 

off night, though, is a tall order. ·The team Wooden will be displaying tomorrow afternoon is shooting 51 per cent from the field and 74 per cent from the line through their first 14 games. UCLA's offensive leaders are 6-11 sophomore Bill Walton <averaging 20.1) and senior Henry Bibby (18.8). Keith Wilkes

The Bruins are averaging 102.6 points a game, and have scored over 100 points on nine occasions this year. And the Uclans also have the rebounding to control

Irish ready for WCHA leaders 
by Jim Donaldson Sports Editor 

If you wanted to stage a first­rate hockey game, you'd match a couple of high scoring clubs, with good goaltenders, throw in a healthy rivalry and then drop the puck. That's just what the setting will be this weekend at the ACC when the Fighting Irish host the Wisconsin Badgers in a two­game, four point series Ftiday and Saturday nights. 
The Badgers, currently atop the WCHA standings with a 13-3 record and a 17-3 overall, boast the highest scoring team in the league, averaging 5.1 goals per game, and the top goalie in the circuit, Jim Makey, who has a mere 2.57 goals against average. 
The Irish, 7-7 in league play, 11­9 on the year, will counter with the second best scoring club in the WCHA. are averaging 4.85 goals per game, and goalie Dick Tomasoni who, while his goals against average is 4.27, is capable of doing an outstanding job in the nets, given adequate defensive support. 
The rivalry stems from the fact that the Irish have only a win and a tie to show in their nine meetings with Wisconsin. The Badgers won the first seven games between the two schools, some by wide margins like 12-0 and 10-2, when the Irish were still building their hockey program but last year, Notre Dame recorded a win and a tie against Wisconsin in the ACC. 
"We took some good lickings from Wisconsin in past years," Irish coach "Lefty" Smith said yesterday. Now that we're on a par with them, we're looking to make up for those defeats." 
The series is a key one for the Irish who, with 22 title points, trail the Badgers by 12 points in the league standings. But, with four games to play against Wisconsin in the next two weeks, Notre Dame still has hopes of catching the league leaders. 
The Irish climbed back into the thick of the WCHA race by sweeping an eight-point series from Minnesota last weekend in the Twin Cities. Coach Smith termed the series with the Gophers "critical" and he views the Wisconsin series in the same light. "I know it sounds shopworn but what else is there to say about the series but it's critical," Smith remarked. "We're in con­tention for first place but two victories is a m·ust." 
The Badgers haven't been swept in a series all season. They have top notch goaltending, strong defense, and forwards who can both score and forecheck as well as any in the WCHA. 
Senior co-captain Jim Young is Wisconsin's top scoring threat. Young has included six game winning goals among his team leading total of 16 and has been credited with 11 assists. Centers Dean Talafous, one of the league's top freshmen and Gary Winchester trail Young in the Badger point parade. Both have 26 points, Talafous on eight goals and 18 assists and Winchester on 10 goals and 16 assists. Young, Talafous and Winchester have each scored 22 points in WCHA competition. 
Co-captain Jeff Rotsch and Bob Lundeen, who has scored 10 goals, head the Badgers capable solid defense crew. Mackey has done most of the goaltending for Wisconsin although the Badgers are hopeful that freshman Dick Perkins,who compiled a 1.9 goals against average before being injured, will be able for duty against the Irish. 
"We are getting a lot of mileage out of our team," commented Wisconsin coach Bob Johnson earlier this week. "A lot of people are having goodyears. They are hard working hockey players and we have pretty good balance." 
The Irish have a couple of advantages going for them that may give them a slight ad­vantage in the series. The first is that the Badgers haven't played in two weeks because of their first semester examinations. In addition, Wisconsin will have to play without the services of Talafous Friday night. The talented frosh was ejected from the Badgers' last game against Colorado College and, according to league rules, must sit out his team's next game. Finally, the Irish will be skating on home ice, where they have lost but one of five games. 
But the Badgers still figure to give Notre Dame plenty of trouble. "I expect an explosive type series with lots of forechecking and skating," coach Smith commented. 
All of the Irish are healthy and set to go this weekend. Tomasoni will handle the goaltending chores and the Chisholm, Minn., senior has been doing an out­standing job of late. Bill Green and Bill Nyrop, who played some of their best hockey of the season 
last weekend, will team up on defense with Mark Steinborn and Steve Curry, respectively. 
At the forward positions, John Noble will skate between Paul Regan and Ric Schafer, John

Not even the most dyed-in-the-wool sports fan could ask for a better 
schedule of athletic events than that slated to take place on campus 
this weekend. Today and tomorrow, Notre Dame is an athletic 
aficionado's paradise. 
There's something for everyone's sports taste as the Irish hockey, basketball, wrestling, swimming and track teams will all be in action this weekend. 
Heading the guest list of visiting teams are the national champion UCLA Bruins and the Wisconsin Badgers, pacesetters in the WCHA. 
Coach Dennis Stark's swimmers will be first on the program, taking on Bradley this afternoon at four o'clock in the Rockne Memorial pool. The 3-1 Irish feature a number of solid performers, including sprinter Gene Krathaus and diver Larry Lafratta. 
The hockey team moves into the spotlight tonight as they meet the Wisconsin Badgers, currently leading the WCHA, in the opener of a two-game series at 7:45. Student ticket prices are back down to $1 and there isn't a better entertainment buy on campus. The Badgers and Irish are running 1-2 in the WCHA scoring statistics and it shapes up as one hell of a series. 
Tomorrow at noon, coach Alex Wilson unveils his 22nd indoor track team against Miami of Ohio. Although the Irish have lost former NC'AA 600-yard champion, Rick Wohlhuter, through graduation, the return of 16lettermen and the addition of several gifted freshmen give promise of a successful indoor season. Heading the list of returnees are four-year standouts Elio Polselli and Mike McMannon. Polselli, the captain of the squad, is a fine shot-putter and McMannon is a versatile performer who can compete in the long and high jumps as well as the sprint events. Tom McMannon, Mike's younger brother, Rich Vallicelli, Don Creehan and fleet freshman Eric Penick also figure to be top point-getters. 
Frank McLaughlin's talented freshman basketball team hosts Southwestern Michigan at one o'clock tomorrow afternoon and it'd be well worth your while to hustle on over to the Convo to catch their act. Gary Brokaw, averaging 30-plus points per game, can do it all on the court and generally does. Dwight Clay is a first rate ballhandler and has a fine touch from the outside. Pete Crotty, a 6'8" New York boy is becoming more aggressive and looks better every outing. Hustling Bedford Bruno and Tom Varga round out the first five. This quintet knocked off the previously unbeaten Marquette yearlings last Monday night and are just rounding into form. 
The Irish wrestlers are in action tomorrow afternoon too, meeting archrival and perennial powerhouse John Carroll at 1:30 in the auxiliary gym. Notre Dame,led by a fantastic freshman heavyweight, Mike Fanning, who has recorded 11 consecutive pins this season, boasts a 7-1 record, while John Carroll is unbeaten in eight starts. 
UCLA's Bruins, NCAA basketball champions the past five seasons, return to the scene of their last defeat, the ACC, at 3:40 p.m. Fifty­eight point victors over the Irish a few weeks ago in Los Angeles, John Wooden's club hopes to duplicate that result before a sellout crowd and a national TV audience. 
Notre Dame's "B" hockey team, coached by Charlie Burroughs, will swing into action against the Glenwood Gulls at 4:30. Burroughs' charges, sporting a 6-0-1 record, beat the Gulls earlier this season, 9-4. 
"Lefty" Smith's icers will round out the athletic extravaganza, again taking on Wisconsin tomorrow night at 7:45. 
One man's opinion: It would seem obvious that Notre Dame's Athletic Board will pass the "Freshman Eligible" rule at its next meeting. Virtually every major conference in the country has decided in favor of the new legislation, including the Big Ten. It would seem that if the Irish are to hold their own in the recruiting wars, they'll have to decide to allow freshmen to compete on the varsity level in football and basketball. 
I think that most high school stars would prefer to attend a school where they could play four years at the varsity level, rather than just three. 
Playing a varsity sport as a freshman doesn't seem to present any major problem to most young athletes. "Lefty" Smith has always used freshmen on his hockey teams and the long, grueling schedule hasn't affected many of them adversely. 
Roger Valdiserri, Notre Dame's Sports Information Director, took a poll recently among 18 former Irish athletes who were allowed to compete in varsity sports as freshmen in 1951, during the Korean War. To a man, they agreed that playing varsity sports in their first year at college was beneficial and that they would have no concern about letting a son of their own play varsity sports at the age of 18. 
Everything points to the Athletic Board giving the O.K. to frosh football and basketball players next year. Now if "Digger" Phelps can only find a seven-foot high school senior somewhere ... 
Emily Post Dept.---With Saturday's game against UCLA slated for national television one has to wonder what uncouth behavior Notre Dame's "sports fans" will display. The perennial "bullshit" cheer made another reappearance Monday night as well as a new gimmick, tossing hot dogs at Marquette's AI McGuire and his players. It was most certainly a "bush" demonstration---hardly what one would expect from a presumably intelligent student body. 
Visitors on campus--Phil Witliff, holder of several Notre Dame hockey records, including career goal leadership, and two-time Irish ice captain was around campus this week and will watch the Irish­Wisconsin series. 
Jim Chones, Marquette's 6'11" All-American center, wandered into the Observer office last Sunday night and chatted for half an hour. He said he felt that the Warriors' toughest game before the NCAA tourney would come against New Mexico State. 
The big guy also commented on his views about leaving school to sign a pro contract. "I didn't receive any concrete offers at the price I wanted last season. This year, I'm gettirlg more publicity and I hope to make my big push this season." Nobody involved with Notre Dame basketball would be too upset is Chones passed up his last year of t'ligibility in favor of signing a pro contract.
