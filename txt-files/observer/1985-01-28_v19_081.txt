LONDON-British newspapers re­ported yesterday that Soviet Presi­dent Konstantin Chernenko is being treated in the intensive care unit ofa private Kremlin hospital, and may relinquish power because of deterioratin~ health. 
Western diplomats contacted by The Associated Press in Moscow said they had not heard any such reports, although most said they believe the 73-year-old Chernenko is ailing. 
The Sunday Times quoted "unofficial reports" as saying Chernenko, who has not been seen in public since Dec. 27, will become the first Soviet leader to step down voluntarily. 
Another newspaper, The Express, carried a report that said Chernenko "has become so ill he may be forced to resign." The newspapers did not say what their sources were, or how they obtained their information. 
The Sunday Times said the ruling Politburo already has approved a plan to replace Chernenko with 53­year-old Mikhail Gorbachev, widely believed to rank second in the Kremlin hierarchy. 
"Under this plan, Gorbachev would take over the post of general

MARACAIBO, Venezuela-Latin music greeted Pope John Paul II as he stepped off his plane yesterday in this steamy South American oil cen­ter beside the Caribbean. Posters read: "Our Sun Is More Radiant With Your Presence." 
Earlier, he condemned abortion, sterilization and divorce at a Mass in the capital of Caracas before hundreds of thousands who endured stifling heat in this nominally Roman Catholic country. 
The bands at the Maracaibo air­port continued playing as the pontiff walked through the crowds and into the "popemobile." Huge crowds of Venezuelans, Colombians and native Indians lined the flag-covered papal route, swelling past police barriers and armed soldiers to get closer to him. 
John Paul, the first pope to visit Venezuela, received a similar greet­ing Saturday when he arrived in Caracas, the first stop on a four­nation trip that will take him to Ecuador, Peru and Trinidad-Tobago. The journey is the pontiff's sixth to Latin America and his 25th abroad. 
Vatican officials said Archbishop Miguel Obando y Bravo of Managua, Nicaragua, was among the prelates gathered in Maracaibo, a city of I million near the Colombian border, for the pope's overnight stop. 
John Paul welcomed them during an outdoor evening Mass, saying, "Greeting to the pastors of Nicaragua and El Salvador who are present here." Arturo Rivera Damas, archbishop of San Salvador, and Obando y Bravo were among several

secretary of the Communist Party, but would not necessarily assume the presidency a mainly ceremonial title. Indeed some sources say Chernenko could con­tinue to hold this job while stepping down as effective leader," the news­paper said. 

It said any such decision would be made at a meetingofthe Communist Party Central Committee next month. 
A senior Western diplomat in Moscow told AP on Friday that So­viet officials have acknowledged Chernenko has been ailing during the past four weeks. 
The diplomat said he had no firm information about the exact nature of his illness. However, Chernenko is widely thought to be suffering from emphysema. According to The Sunday Times, Chernenko's health has deteriorated sharply in the past week. The newspaper said Chernenko's doctors are looking after him in the intensive care unit of a private Kremlin hospital, and that "his respiratory illness, including emphysema, has now been compl­icated by cardiac deficiencies." 
"Observers reckon his illness is now irreversible and it is thought that this view has been firmly ex­pressed by the doctor in charge of the president, believed to be an out­standing Czechoslovak specialist," The Sunday Times said. Despite prolonged illnesses, Chernenko's two predecessors, Yuri Andropov and Leonid Brezhnev, died in office. Rumors of their impending resigna­tions also circulated in Moscow during the last months oftheir lives. 
Chernenko succeeded Andropov as Communist Party general secre­tary on Feb. 13. 1984.

The first airdrops of food to famine victims in a remote area of Ethiopia were rated by a U.N. official yesterday as an "extraordinarily good performance." Kurt Jansson, U.N. assistant secretary-general for emergency operations, said British and West German aircraft dropped pallets ofgrain and otherfood. "It is expen­sive but feasible to reach people where there are no roads," he said. Relid officials say many Ethiopians suffering the effects of drought are not bdng reached by other reliefefforts, partly because ofrough terrain. -AP 
Former streetgang members in Chicago will 
staff a 24-hour hotline to help other youths who want to escape the violent, drug-ridden lifestyle of the city's gangs, say spokesmen for a newly formed youth organization. "A Way Out," a program to help gang members begin a new way oflife, was started by more than 100 former gang members who are calling for an end to gang-related violence, said Tony Brown, 19. "I have to know more than a hundred people that got killed; I've been to at least I00 funerals," Brown said Saturday. "Let people know the killing has to stop." -AP 
A group in Tampa, Fla. that contends the English language is losing ground in Florida is launching a campaign for a state constitutional amendment that would reduce the use of Spanish in official dealings with the state government. U.S. English, which claims 70,000 members, is opening its drive today to have the amendment placed on the 1986 ballot. The measure would elimi­nate Spanish on driver's and occupational tests and to cut back on bilingual requirements in government activities. According to the 1980 census, 3 percent of Florida's population could not speak En­glish well or at all and 12.4 percent spoke another language at home.

She was a student not unlike other Saint Mary's stu­dents in the mid-1940s. Her talent on the piano allowed her to work offone third of her tuition costs by playing for recitals. When she graduated from Saint Mary's in 1946 as a history major, the College sent her to Colum­bia University in New York to earn her master's degree under the condition of returning to her alma mater to teach history for a year. Following this she married and settled into her career of motherhood still filled with dreams, ambitions and unrealized goals. And she was my mother. 
All her plans abruptly came to a halt when, in 1961, she was diagnosed as having Multiple Sclerosis. MS is a prgressive disease of the central nervous system in which the simple everyday tasks can no longer be taken for granted. Its symtoms can run the complete gamut from slight blurring ofvision to complete paralysis. 
For college women of the career-oriented '80s postponing marriage or choosing not to get married is the difference between the 1940s and now. But besides that the future promises an exciting and new life after ~~ college for both men and women today as always. No matter what plans students make today, if they are honest with themselves they will admit that they, like the Saint Mary's '46 graduate, do not plan on contracting a debilitating disease. 
My mother did not know that she was a prime can­didate: young (between 20 and 40 years), female (though the chances for wo­men contracting MS is only slightly higher than men), and from a cooler part of the country (the midwest). A large percentage of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students fit these criteria though none suspect they will fall victim to this mysterious disease. 
There is no cure, yet, for MS. The disease attacks and destroys the protective coating around the nerve fibers of the brain and spinal cord. This results in interrupted and distorted nerve impulses to the brain. which translates into loss of muscle control. It goes through periods ofexacerbations when the disease is active, and symptom-free periods of remission. In my mother's case MS was active much ofthe time, but for each victim MS acts differently. 
A quarter ofa million Americans have MS and nearly 200 new cases diagnosed a week. Today there is one Notre Dame and one Saint Mary's known case of MS. It can and does strike students and adults with promising careers inspite of every noble, ambitious goal students 

Anne Monastyrski 
Saint Mary's Editor 
Because Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students are a concentration of prime candidates and none suspects suspect he or she will get MS, students should be anx­ious to help in the fight to discover the still unknown cause ofthe disease and the cure. lbe National Multiple Sclerosis Society provides the funds for research, pa· tient services, public education and professional educa­tion. Student government in conjunction with student activities is organizing the MTV sponsored MS benefit and the proceeds will be donated to NMSS. 
Plans for the fundraiser were announced in Decem­ber 1984 which involves a contest among 16 Midwes· tern colleges to raise the largest amount of money. The grand prize is a free MlV sponsored concert by one of the top five rock groups as determined by MTV. The concert would be scheduled for the Saturday of An Tostal, April 27. The concert would be re­broadcast on national TV. 
With the spirit of compe­tition alive and well at Saint Mary's and Notre Dame, the three-week contest should be cake-walk (even though we are one of the smallest 
schools involved) especially considering some of the fundraising events planned. 
The drive begins with the Feb. 9 Kick-Off Video Dance which will feature quarter beers for those who are 21 years or older, though everyone is invited. Tick­ets go on sale Wednesday at the dining halls and ticket bearers at the dance get a free chance to win an all­expense paid trip to Florida for Spring Break. 
Tickets will be sold for a free-throw contest during the half of the Syracuse game. The winner out of 10 contestants who gets the most out of 10 free-throws wins tickets for the N.C.A.A. tournement. 
Only a couple of the several events planned are men­tioned here but the beauty ofthe fundraiser is that it is a three-week answer to the continuing struggle of ND/SMC students to improve social life.

Armageddon pie makes mankind's dessert menu 
Two weeks ago, I traveled to Los Angeles  
for a job interview. After checking into the  
local Marriott I decided to dress up and dine  
in the hotel's posh restaurant. Alone, I was  
offered the choice of dining by myself or of  
dining with the hotel manager at the cap­ 
tain's table, at which complementary wine  
would be sen1ed.  
David G. Grote  
speaking out of turn  
Feeling somewhat adventurous, anxious  
for company, and thirsty, I joined the hotel  
manager, a Pakistani man with a pleasant  
eastern accent named Naem Mazir. Seated  
wtth him was a well-traveled RCA business  
executive named james Denton. After the  
normal introductions and small talk thefol­ 
lowing discussion on man's destiny ensued.  
Denton: Mr. Mazir. my friend, I find myself  
nearing the end ofa long career in business. I  
have seen much ofthe world. I have seen vio­ 
lence and moral decay. I see the threat of nu­ 
clear destruction billowing dark over the  
world and ask myself is there something I can  
do, something that will make a difference in  
the future ofour world.  
Mazir: Well I do not know-maybe not.  
Denton: Young man, this gentleman here is  
from Pakistan. He was a young man when  
Pakistan was partitioned from India. He has  
seen the violence and hatred.  
Mazir: When I was a boy, there was much vio­ 
lence in India between Moslem's and Hindu's.  
r  When Pakistan was created I traveled by train  
r  with my family, and with other Moslems to  
r r r ~  Pakistan. Everyone on the train feared for their lives. There had been reports that Mos­lems were being slaughtered at train stations  
along many of the routes.·  
At each station we waited, hearts beating  
fast, praying for the train to continue, praying  
r  for our lives to be spared. Our train was the  
r  last to make it to Pakistan. All the people on  
r  the trains behind us were killed. In all, some  
r  two to three million Moslems were mas­ 
r  sacred.  
Denton: The Moslems and Hindus could not  
r r r  live in peace. For the world to survive we must all be able to live together -but that is not our world. Senseless killing cominues. Mazir: Yes, there is much hatred in the world,  
r  too many people unwilling to try.  
r  Denton: Well, I have no choice but to agree  
r  with you my friend.  
r  
r  Me: I have been listening to you two  
gentleman for some time now. And I realize  
that both of you have had experiences that I  

cannot even imagine. But I refuse to believe that people wiii choose to destroy the world. The Russian people want peace just as much as the American people. Denton: Have you ever been to Russia? Me: Well, uh. Denton: Have you ever been to Russia? Me: No, I have not been there. Denton: I've been there. In fact I've been there several times, and, young man, I know that the Russian people will believe whatever their government wants them to believe. It is a shame. But it's true and there is nothing we can do to change that. Me: Fine, but I don't think that man's future is hopeless. Denton: Alright, what do you think will change things. What do you see that will save our world. Me: Well, my hope is rooted in my interpreta­tion ofChrist's message. Mazir: How do you interpret his message? Me: I think that Christ saw man's potential for cruelty and man's potential for self destruc­tion. He came to transform the standards of society. He showed us that the peace thought only to accompany death could come from within ourselves. That the kingdom of God was not a place for dead people. The kingdom of God is the understanding of the power of love and unselfishness and the advancement of that understanding is worth sacrificing for. For Christ, the salvation of man was worth dying for. Denton: But look at the world, my young man. Is that advancement taking place? There are wars today reflecting the traditions ofcen­turies of hatred. Who will bring about this change? Have you done anything. Have I done anything. No. Ifour world remains the same it will eventually explode. Me: Maybe that is the problem. Maybe if people like you and I tried to change things something would be accomplished. Maybe we are all sitting idly in resturants waiting for 

our Armageddon pie. But I know admitting defeat can only further the probability of our destruction. Denton: If you feel that way, that's great. I wish I agreed with you but I'm afraid I can't. I don't think we can make a difference. Mankind finally has the tools for its own destruction and is standing at the edge, ready to jump. 
Soon we were joined by anotherguest and the normal introductions and small talk needed restating. As the conversation shifted to less serious topics l~ra
d to believe my 

words, I prayed that t  wer  wrong and I  
prayed for the strength  to  ange what I  
could.

Examining ourselves in light of clinic bombings 
Last October, during the religion in politics furor, I wrote an article titled "Drav..·ing the Abortion-Holocaust Analogy.· What prompted me to write the artkle wa~ the logi· cal correlation that I saw between what some abortion opponents on campu' wne saying and the then solitary incident of an abortion clinic bombing. What these opponents were saying was that abortion was analogous to the Holocaust. In my article, I rigorously applied this Holocaust analogy to abortion, implying that ifthe ananlogy did fit, then just as the Ger-
Vernon Marchal 
afterwords 
_ man people were responsible for what hap­pened to the Jews, so too are all of us responsible for what is happening to unborn children in this country. The connection be­tween this analogy and the abortion clinic bombing was this: Had we been German citizens during World War II, most of us would have felt no compunction in either sup­porting or participating in a bombing attack on a Nazi concentration camp -indeed, we probably would have felt it a moral obligation. 
My feeling was that to equate abortion with the Holocaust was to unavoidably imply that the abortion clinic bombing was not only morally defensible, but almost morally neces­sary. Given the seriousness ofthis implication, the aim of my article was to question the ap­propriateness of the the abortion-Holocaust analogy. 
Of course, since I wrote that article, chere has been many more more abortion clinic bombings. Public reaction to these bombings by abortion opponents has, I think, raised some important questions about the nature of abortion. · 
In recent weeks, it has been interesting to 
slaughter of human life? To me, that im­
perative seems absurd. Indeed, if I believed 
for one minute that abortion was like the 
Holocaust, I would probably be heaving a 
Molotov cocktail through a window at the 
South Bend Women·~ Pavilion, right now. But 
I do not equate abortion with the Holocaust. 
And, in as much as the Women's Pavilion is 
still standing, it seems that those who equated 
abortion with the Holocaust do not really 
equate the two either. 
But if abortion is not the wholesale murder 

that the Holocaust was, what kind of murder is 
it? Is it some different kind? Clearly, even 
those of us most opposed to abortion seem 
compelled to stand by and watch it happen. 
Or is abortion murder at all? Is it, in fact, a very 
complex, confusing, and painful issue that has 
so far defied all the unthinking and inflam­
mitory attempts to oversimplify it? Or is it the 
sad truth that we who are opposed to abortion 
are really only moral equivocators, unable to 
find the courage in our hearts to defend inno­
cent, helpless human life. 
These, it seems to me, are some of the cru­cia! questions raised by the issue of abortion. But, suprisingly. these are precisely the kinds of questions not being raised by people on either side of the issue. Any intelligent and, in the end, fruitful dicussion of abortion must start with these questions and with an honest exploration ofone's own position. 
What does it mean to equate abortion with the Holocaust or, as a recent "Notre Dame Re· ligious Bulletin" did, to call it a "social atrocity" for which we all are responsible? What are the implications of these positions? Can one defend all of them? And if not, why not? One possibility may be that deep down people do not find their positions tenable, in which case it would seem logical to find a more suitable ones. Another possibility may be that their positions are correct, but that a lack of conviction prevents them from acting 
note the response of the vast majority of on the dictates ofthose positions. The point is 
leading abortion opponents to clinic born­bings: they have uniformly come out against them. This response is difficult for me to un­derstand. Without intending to be sarcastic, I cannot see how anyone believing abortion to be murder can come out against attacks on abortion clinics. And I especially cannot see how anyone who believes -really believes ­that abortion is like the Holocaust can denounce abortion clinic bombings. 
What is the moral imperative for such a denunciation? Is it that no one should come to any harm while engaged in the wholesale that unless one really examines his own posi­tion, he will not know. 
The journalist and author Walter Uppman once said that "Many a time I have wanted to stop talking and find out what I really believe." It seems to me that the recent abortion clinic bombings have provided us with an oppor­tinity to take a good, hard look at what we really believe.

Notre Dame solicits with false advertising 
P.O.BoxQ 
I am disturbed by a letter Father Hesburgh sent to my parents while I was home for the recent Christmas break. The letter was Notre Dame's annual appeal for funds. After long 
Charles Boudreaux 
only solitaire 
passages about past holiday seasons and Notre 
Dame's sense of tradition, the letter eventu­
ally got around to its soft-pedalled request for 
cash. 
The letter bothers me for several reasons. In 
the first place, I find it audacious that Notre 
Dame would request any more money than 
the ten thousand dollars a year that my and 
other parents are already paying this institu­
tion. If parents are unable or have chosen not 
to put their children through college, they 
would also almost surely be opposed to donat­.ing money for that college's "improvement." 
Let us suppose, however, that some stu­
dents' parents are able to make some sort of 
contribution to Notre Dame. Where does this 
money go? Whom is it supposed to aid? How is 
it reasonable to donate money to a university 
with a so-so financial aid program and no aca­
demic scholarships? Are the University's 
priorities in its edifices or in its students and 
faculty? 
The letter claims that the University's edu­
cational vision is one in which "values lend 
meaning to facts." In my mind, the University 
of Notre Dame understands the facts offinan­
cial solidity: a university that has a large en· 
dowment is a university that stays in business. 
One would think that Notre Dame would 
begin to become aware of the values that ac­
company this fact; instead ofusing the interest 
drawn from its investments for the better· 
ment of Notre Dame, however, the University 
continues to monomaniacally reinvest the in­
terest. Like Ahab in "Moby Dick," there should 
be a time at which one remembers the real 
purpose for which one is doing something, 
whether it be collecting whale oil or dona­
tions. 
The most hypocritical element of the letter 
my parents received is the idea found in the 
following three crucial sentences: "We are 
not preservers only, but co-creators also;" 

"We are active agents in Notre Dame's des­
tiny;" and "The future of Notre Dame, like its 
past, is not something that unfolds of its own; 
it is something that we deliberately shape." 
Who is this mythical "we"? Certainly not your 
and my parents. When was the last time that 
your parents have been polled before Notre 
Dame declares policy? When was the last time 
that parents -or students or faculty, for that 
matter -have brought about a major policy 
change? 
What Father Hesburgh is asking for is not "co-creation"; rather, he asks for the financial preservation ofa status quo which may or may not be meeting the wants and needs ofits stu­dents, their parents, and the University's own faculty and staff. Do parents want to "co­create" a university that refuses to allow other religious groups to meet on campus, though preaching social justice and liberal arts? Do they wish to be "active agents" in a university that curtails a social environment "traditionally" floating on alcohol without first providing sufficient non-alcoholic social space on campus? I am not so sure. 
I believe that the University can be ac­curately represented as a pseudo-corporation, a business in which the raw materials (students) are run through the machinery of the faculty and the campus to produce the final product: a forty-thousand-dollar sheepskin glossed over with social service and moral or ethical platitudes. Until this Univer· sity allows parents and students to really "co­create" (a student on the Board of Trustees, for example), I believe that it has no right to pass itself off as a mutual proposition. In addi­tion to the standard piecework (price-per­student) fee, parents were offered an option to buy non-refundable stock in a corporation in which they have no voice. I was told in high school that one does not solve problems by throwing money at them. Until parents can co-create instead of merely holding up the status quo, I believe that it is wrong for the University to solicit money in the guise of a concept so majestic as "co-creation" or "active agency." The Federal Trade Commis­sion would label this sort ofsolicitation "false advertising" -and so do I.

The difficult truth of New York City life 
DearEditor: 
As I read Mark Potter's article on the 
New York City public's reaction to the 
now-infamous "subway vigillante," I felt 
sparks ofanger on behalfofthe civilian vic­
tims who are the target ofcriminal actions. 
Although I have not experienced a major 
attack such as a mugging or rape (thank 
God), I do consider myself a victim just 
being a female resident of New York City. 
When others find out I'm a New Yorker, 
usually the first question is, "Isn't it danger­
ous to live there ?" My experiences tells me 
it is. New York crime affects the way I live 
my life. There are do's and don'ts to avoid 
problems. Don't walk alone on dark 
streets. Do look over your shoulder. Don't 
ride in an empty subway car ... particularly 
if you are a woman. It is humiliating and 
scary to be whistled at, talked suggestively 
to, followed, or confronted. Once a young 
man asked me for money. That happens to 
many people. But even when I told him no 
and walked into a store, he was waiting 
everytime I emerged. I have had bad expe­
riences elsewhere as well, but my 
hometown tops the list. It's a difficult truth, 
but it's a part oflife.

Student Saver needs our continued support 
DearEditor: 
Now that the Notre Dame Student Saver is a reality, the real campaign begins. So far, support of the store has been better than anticipated, a fact which can only be attrib­uted to the students themselves. The hoopla and newspaper articles though will soon end and the students must realize that it is up to them to keep the store running. Student Activity fee money has paid for every item therefore each of us has a stake in making it a success. Permission was fi­nally given because Father Tyson could not deny the students something which they apparently wanted dearly. We need to show the administration and others that we meant what we said. 
Prices in the Hammes Bookstore have dropped since the project was undertaken and we believe that the opening of thegeneral store influenced that decision. In addition, the Student Activities Board would like to recognize the extraordinary help it has gotten from Jim Goshort, the owner of Broadmoor Pharmacy, without whose help we would probably still have bare shelves. Most of all, the students deserve to be congratulated on their response to our hard work.

Conduct at basketball game is reprehensible 
DearEditor: 
Unfortunately I watched the Notre Dame-DePaul basketball game. The rude­ness ofthe students apalled me. 
I could not believe what I was hearing when the DePaul players were introduced and the student body "booed" them. Is this the actions ofladies and gentlemen? I think not. 
The conduct of the students throughout the game was reprehensible. 
Notre Dame would be well served if they taught sportsmanship and manners to their students. They owe the DePaul team an apology.

Ann Sullivan's article misses vital facts 
DearEditor: 
Ann Sullivan's article about Notre Dame students who are in the South Bend Sym­phony angered one of my friends. Her name is Kathy Nee, a junior finance and psychology major. She has been playing the viola in the symphony longer than any of the other students (since she was a senior in high school), yet she was not mentioned in the article. Where did Ann get her information?

Carazo's history of treachery in Costa Rica 
It is sad to read that Father Malloy and Pro­fessor James Taylor had to travel so many miles to Costa Rica to attend a seminar sponsored by the so-called "University of Peace" during the last break. Almost any Costa Rican could have phoned them and told them what the "University of Peace" really is -the new toy of the former president, Rodrigo Carazo, the biggest liar and betrayer of Costa 
Frank Lopez guest column 
Rica since the country's Revolution of 1948. Carazo sold his name and the name of his country to the Soviets and the Cubans during the Sandinista Revolution. While denying any participation in the revolution, he permitted and supported Sandinista military camps in northern Costa Rica, where Sandinistas were trained by Cuban military personnel. This vio­lated the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs ofa foreign country. 
Furthermore, always smiling like his comrade Jimmy Carter, Carazo directed the contraband ofarms from the Soviet Union and Cuba destined to supply the Sandinistas. In this cowardly action, many arms ended up in the hands of the few Costa Rican communists who still want to destabilize the country. And what a coincidence that more than 90 percent ofthe terrorists' acts perpetrated in Costa Rica since have involved the use ofthese arms. This heroic contraband by the former president netted him, together with his sons and his minister of defense, more than $30 million. But that is not all. During his frequent trips to Cuba he concocted a plan with Castro to make Costa Rica a bridge between La Habana and the United States, through which the poor, desperate Cubans seeking liberty had to pass before entering the United States. This was not a Samaritan action by Carazo to provide freedom for thousands of Cubans trying to escape Castro's tyranny. To Carazo, every­thing has a price. And the price, in this case, was 52000 per Cuban per visa for entry into Costa Rica. The place ofexpedition ofthe visa was not the immigration offices, but the law office ofCarazo's sons. 

Toward the end of his administration, Carazo excelled in performing other corrupt acts. First. he started selling Costa Rican pas­sports to Taiwanese citizens wanting to reside in Costa Rica. And, believe me, he did not do this to eat for free in the Chinese restaurants run by these hard-working people. The price ofone passport was 55000. 
Second, after the Shah of Iran was over­thrown, Carazo gave resident status to many Iranians who started the trafficking ofcocaine in Costa Rica in large amounts, converting my country into another cocaine capital. Carazo did not do this so that his sons could get high for free. A substantial amount of money was paid by the Iranians to Carazo to operate freely in Costa Rica. 
Needless to ;;ay, this corruption created scandals for which Costa Rica was ridiculed and which surfaced on the front pages ofmany international newspapers. I do not mention the resulting economic impact on the country because it may make some turn over in their graves. 
How can a man extolling such a curriculum during his presidential term be president of the "University of Peace?" And how can a top Notre Dame administrator and a Notre Dame professor lower themselves to the point ofat­tending a semimar by this so-called "University of Peace?" The fact is that Carazo presides over the "University of Peace" the way he wants, and this should be ofgreat con­cern. Ifnothing is done, the land donated by a Costa Rican citizen will soon become the site 
of a private country club of the Soviet and 
Nicaraguan diplomats in Costa Rica, who will 
undoubtedly have the company ofCarazo, his 
sons and distinguished members of the 
(agonizing) communist party (only the 
oligarchy of the party of course) whenever 
the boss, Fidel Castro, decides to fly to Costa 
Rica rather than to Nicaragua for the 
weekend. 
When Professor Taylor summed up the seminar by giving Carazo and the "University ofPeace" position on how to solve the Central American problem by saying, "stop United States aid," he should have been more con­crete and expressed the true objective of Carazo and his "University of Peace." The ob­jective is to substitute Soviet aid for United States aid. However, Central America has no price for which Carazo can strike another cor­rupt deal. And since President Reagan will be in office four more years, Carazo, his univer­sity and all those fooled into attending Carazo's seminars, will have their objective of establishing another Cuba in Central Ameerica destroyed, at least for four more years.

The hits and misses of 1984 
Vic Sciulli 
features staffwriter 
Records 

Best albums 
1. Reckoning 
R.E.M. 
Last year R.E.M.'sMunnur was one of the most critically praised LPs of the year. The success wasn't a fluke; Reckoning is one of the best LPs released by an American band In years. The band, hailing from

r 
r Athens, Georgia, forges another r progressive path while keeping r folkly roots. Bill Berry's muted r vocal delivery adds a compelling r sense of urgency to the music, from 
,r 
the reminiscent "Don't Go Back to 
Rockville" to the beautiful "So. 

r 
Central Rain.'' llte production Is

r 
beautifully unpolished; the rough

r 
r edges are in just the right spots. By r far the year's best. 
r 
2. Heartbeat City 
The Cars 
The Cars' creativity pendulum swung back toward center on this, their fifth album. The band strikes a ground somewhere between the excellent, symh-filledPanorama and the undirected pop onShake It l!p. On first listening it appears the band has retreated from its slightly avant garde pop sound. 
Producer Mutt Lange (of For­eigner and Def Leppard fame) took the band's sound and molded it to fit to AOR station formats; guitars fill places synths might have been. By no means, though, did the band abandon their electronic sound. In fact, all the drumming was programmed. 
"Ilte result is a balance in styles. Yet, there Is a nice balance to the songs: from the band's romp through the goofy "You Might 

~ 
Think" to the hypnotic electro­r ballad "Drive," Heartbeat City saw 
r 
the band walk a thin line between 

r 
adult contemporary and rock.

r 
r 3. Purple Rain
r 
Prince and the Revolution 

~ One of the most autobiographical l.Ps of the year, it served as the 
~ perfect vehicle for the movie. The band rips through the volatile "Let's Go Crazy" with style and ease but shows a smokier blues sound on the title track. His guitar performance is near brilliant in places and com­parisons to Hendrix are merited. This is Prince's strongest and most consistent performance. 
4. Born in the U.S.A. 
Bruce Springsteen and theE Street Band 
Except for the brilliant "Dancing in the Dark," Springsteen doesn't break any new ground in his first album in three years. No problem though; he just does what he's always done better than anyone else. No one comes close to Spring.-;teen in his conviction of describing the American dream and the broken promise for the un­employed. The band is as tight as ever, which goes to show that some things get better in time. The three­year wait was worth it. This is Springsteen's best. 
5. Learning to Crawl 
The Pretenders 
"Ibis album could have been a disastt"r story of the band's last two years. Fellow band members Pete 

Farndon and james Honeyman­Scott were lost in drug-related deaths after the release of Pretenders J/ and many wondered if Chrissie Hynde (now Chrissie Kerr after her recent marriage) could pick up the pieces. Hynde did that and more. "Back on the Chain Gang" is an emotional tribute to the departed band members; Hynde, refusing to give in, formed a new band. The success oflearning to Crawl (named in honor ofher new daughter who was learning to crawl around the time of the LP's release) is a tribute to Hynde's strength and fortitude. 
6. She's So Unusual 
Cyndi Lauper 
One of the most delightful debuts of the year. The former Blue Angel member covers the spectrum of pop sounds, from the bubbly "Girls Just Want To Have Fun" to the harder rocking "Money Changes Everything" and the ballad "Time After Time." MTV had a lot to do with her success, but her voice deserves credit too. And you have to admire her guts. 
7.1984 
VanHalen 
This band has been trying to tell audiences they were not just an­other L.A. heavy metal band, but it wasn't until this one that they made some oftheir critics believers. "Jump" was probably the most obvious representation of the new sound, but there was also the hyp­notic "I'll Wait." This was a pleasant surprise for everyone. 
8. Steeltown 
Big Country Big Country broke 
out like gangbusters last year with 
The Crossing, a tribute to their 
Celtic origins.Steeltown lacks the 
killer cut that made their first LP so 
popular, but holds its own with 
consistent performances through­
out. "Iltrough the darkness of the 
lyrics shines a ray ofhope. 
9.Golnsane 
Lindse:}' Buckingham 
Fleetwood Mac guitarist Lindsey Buckingham has made a solo career writing songs that are just the oppo­site of those of his band Fleetwood Mac; quirky, unpolished, sparsely produced gems.Through playing all the instruments on the album, Go Insane provides a catharsis for the little demons inside Buckingham. 
10. Big Bam Boom 
Hall& Oates 
"Dance On Your Knees," the LP's opening track explains the title perfectly: the duo's 12th LP is dominated with a heavier drum sound accompanying very danceable tracks. "Method of Modern Love" is a backtrack to the band's R&B roots but "Out of Touch" is much like "I Can't Go For That" ofa few years ago. Fans may be disappointed by the lack ofsongs like H20's "One on One" but the duo seems to have latched onto a major success writing danceable pop tunes and probably will con­tinue with it a little while longer. 
Best singles 
I. "So. Central Rain" 
R.E.M. 

One ofthe most compelling singles from Reckoning. The song epitomizes so much ofwhat is most striking about R.E.M. -Michael Stipe's unclear delivery, Bill Berry's precise drumming, and an excellent lead guitar by Peter Buck. You can't help but be moved by the sense of urgency in Stipe's plea ''I'm Sorry." Stunning. 
2. "The Boys ofSum­
mer" 
Don Henley 

There are few songs that I liked instantly and this was one. Henley draws up striking images in his wistful look at summer past. The guitar here is pretty too.Boys is as good as any ofthe Eagles' best. 
3. "Let's Go Crazy" 
Prince and the Revolution 
One ofthe most catchy singles of the year (try to sit still during this one-you're either dead or dying). Prince's guitar rips through this one. My favorite dance tune ofthe year. 
The bombs 
Steve Perry -Everything. 
Ollie .!:Jerry -Please wake me up when the breakdancing nightmare ends. 
Laura Branigan -Real singers like Donna Summer can belt out tunes getting manicures better than anything she's ever done. Worse than Chinese water torture. 
Twisted Sister and Motley Crue  Heavy metal needed another gimmick and transvestism was the answer. 
Madonna -What every young girl shouldn't aspire to. 
Nena -Someone should have told her Blondie clones aren't in anymore. 
Dennis DeYoung -Dennis, I think I hear your mother calling. 
Julio Iglesias & Willie Nelson ­Mama don't let your babies grow up to sing songs with aspiring Latin singers. 
TheJacksons-One family reunion I could have done without. 
4. "Drive" 
The Cars 
This song still sounds good to me, three million times later. Ric Ocasek made a great decision in letting Ben Orr handle the vocal chores on this one; Orr's smoother approach is what the song calls for. "Inc foray of"Drive" into adult contemporary radio was a first for the band· 
5. "Don'tGoBackTo Rockville" 
R.E.M. 
More magic from the band of the year; this one has a decidedly melancholic country sound to it. 
6. "Magic" 
The Cars 
Shades ofForeigner. The guitar licks here sound straight from an old Foreigner LP, thanks to producer Mutt Lange, but it pro­vides a striking contrast to some of the other songs on the LP. 
7. "Out ofTouch" 
Daryl Hall andjohn Oates 
These two guys have been churn­ing out hits like crazy the last five years andBig Bam Boom will add a few more to the list. The pounding drums and echoing background 
voices of"Out ofTouch" made the 
song accessible to dance clubs as 
well as radio. 
8. "Go Insane" 
Lindsey Buckingham 
More of the same from Lindsey ­syncopted guitars and tense vocals. A bit too cocky at times, Buckin­gham once again demonstrates his talents as a producer. 
9. "(Pride) In the Name ofLove" 
U2 
The Unforgettable Fire didn't live up to the future promise oflast year's War but there were a few gems here and this was one. Produced by Eno, "Pride" is flavored with the band's sound of old: Bono's razor-line vocal perfor­mance complimented by another sparkling guitar performance by The Edge. 
10. "Legs" 
ZZTop 
FromEliminator, the LP that wouldn't dic,Legs was just another song from the good ol' boys about the fun things in life: women, cars and women.

Records 

"'"f"1he year in music 1984 saw the 
.l continuance ofmulti-platinum successes, a rise in the popularity of black music, more heavy metal, and a peak in the interaction between the movie industry and music­Standing above all competition was Prince, whosePurple Rain has been atop the album charts for half a year now. Michaeljackson and his brothers toured the country, net­ting tons ofbucks for charity, but still hurting some ofMichael's truest fans who couldn't afford the tickets, priced at $30 and up. Bruce Springsteen re-established himself as the most popular white per­former around with his most suc­cessful LP to date,Born in the U.SA. 
Best albums 
Springsteen 

The Boss made 1984's strongest and most consistent effort, anal­bum ofboth a patriotic and skepti­cal nature. Musically, the E Street Band is in top form, and so is Springsteen's writing. 
The Replacements 

The Replacements have in them­selves the ability to be a very popular band. They're funny, meaningful, sometimes loud, sometimes soft, and always in­spired. These guys are a joy to hear. 
3. Purple Rain 

Prince and theRevolution 
What can I say? This album is Prince's best. You can dance to it, you can rock to it, and you can even get down to it. I don't hate the synthesizer when it's used this well. 
4. New Sensations 
Lou Reed 

This veteran rocker really surpised me with this one. Avery upbeat, happy album that celebrates the joys ofeverything from red joysticks to motorcycles.

5. Zen Arcade 
HuskerDu 
This double LP is a literal tour de force ofsonic hardcore.ZenArcade is both a political and personal album, and it's not always nice. "Turn on the News" will scare the hell out ofyou with its bleak look at society. 
6. Too Tough to Die 
TbeRamones 
A terrific statement ofpurpose, the Ramones' eighth studio effort welcomes new drummer Richie Ramone with a bang. They expand their repertoire with some political songs and two hardcore numbers sung very convolutedly by Dee Dee, but they do their usual stuff, too. 
7.Reckoning 
R.E.M. 
The most popular underground band in the country released a solid follow-up toMurmur. Good Ameri­can rock with a touch offolk and country. 
8. All Over the Place 
The Bangles 
These four Los Angeles women really rock with the best. A tough record, in a sense, but the group never compromises itself. Their sound is one from the past, yet it sounds great today. 
9. Double Nickels on 
the Dime 
The Minutemen 
Another double LP from the label that brought you Husker Du. These 45 songs cover all sorts of things, from tension to Michael jackson to the roar ofthe masses. A little some­thing for everyone. 
10.1984 
VanHalen 
Yes, I know Van Hal en is one of the most obnoxious groups around. But unlike, say, Motley Crue, their obnoxiousness is all in fun.I984 was a great party record, especially songs like "Panama" and "Hot for Teacher."

Best singles 
!."Dancing in the Dark" 
BruceSpringsteen 
Definitely the single of the sum­mer, as far as I'm concerned. Very catchy and danceable. Bruce's singing is just great here. This song never lost a bit ofappeal since it was released, and that says some­thing. 

-
2. "EightMiles High" 
HuskerDu 
This song was not onZen Arcade, though it was a very good preview to that album. This song is an ex­tremely amped-up, raved-up hardcore version of the Byrd's classic tune. Ifyou can find it, turn it up! 
3. "Breakin'-There's No 
Stoppin' Us" 
Ollie & jerry 
The best song having to do with breakdancing ever released. Ollie & Jerry utilize electronic drums, synthesizers, and other percussion in a way that no one else has the brains to. This song was also a meaningful statement for all the breakers this past summer. 
4. "Born in the U.S.A." 
BruceSringsteen 
Though this serves better as an album cut than single, it still sounds great on the radio. A powerful, reverberating song about the plight ofa Vietnam vet and his return home. 
5. "Let's Go Crazy" 
Prince and the Revolution 
This is a great party song that means exactly what it says -go crazy. I can't recall how many people I saw reciting the monologue at the beginning, "Dearly beloved ..." 
6. "I Will Dare" 
The Replacements 
Though not yet a hit, this song deserves to be. it's bouncy, catchy, and extremely well-written. Listen to the lyrics, because they're pretty funny. Pete Buck ofR.E.M. guests and does a nice solo, too. 
7. "WhenDoves Cry" 
Prince 
I would be remiss ifI didn't in­clude the year's biggest single. Offbeat, downbeat, and haunting is how I would describe it. This song really beat the odds. 
8. "Pride (In the Name 
ofLove)" 
U2 
U2's tribute to Martin Luther King was the best song offof 1984's The Unforgettable Fire. Agreat guitar part drives this song that's pretty fun to sing along with. 
9. "White Lines (Don't

Interhall hockey season underway; Zahm early surprise with 2-0 start 
By DENNIS CORRIGAN 
Sports Writer 
After a layoff ofover a month due to finals and semester break Inter­hall hockey teams skated back into action on the ACC ice rink last week. Zahm Hall has already turned out to be this season's early surprise. 
After beating Fisher, 4-3, before break, Zahm's record stands at 2-0, good enough for a share of the Cor­rigan Division lead. The Rabid Bats were paced in their victory by Tom Tierney, who notched two goals and an assist. Charlie Hackett registered his second game-winner, and Ed Graber turned on the light to round out the scoring. Zahm recieved out­standing blueline play from first­year defenseman Mike Burgoyne. Zahm captain Michael Sullivan said he is excited about his team's hot start. 
"We hadn't won a game for a few years, and now we're in first place. We've had great fan support in our first two games and, the ream's really

happy about that. We'll be there at playoff time," he said. 
Corrigan Division co-leader Stan­ford returned to play Tuesday night and shut out Carroll, 4-0. Once again Stanford got great net minding from John Lacy as he recorded his second shutout in as many games. In addi­tion, Eric Melkerson scored a hat trick to lead the offense, and Mike Huberty completed the scoring. Before break, Stanford had beaten Fisher, 3-0, as Melkerson, Pat Col­lins, and Mike Macnulty scored single tallies. 
In the only other Corrigan Divi-. sion game, Pangborn skated past Sorin by a 6-2 margin in the debut outings for both clubs last Monday night. Bill Doyle and Paul Schoephoerster paced Pangborn with two goals apiece. Goaltender Dave Long also turned in a solid per­formance. 
Monday night in the Krause Divi­sion saw division leader Dillon blank Keenan, 6-0, in a game marred by a brief fight. Sophomore goalie Dan Sorensen notched the shutout while Pual Graney, Greg Neweefer, and

Tim Staucke each found the net twice. Tuesday night, the Holy Cross/St. Ed's team took advantage of the power play to down Flanner, 4-1. 
"Most of the penalties came from the no-check rule," explained HC/St. Ed's captian Dan Lafreniere. "You're only allowed incidental contact when riding a man off the puck. You can't slam a guy into the boards. The referees have been pretty good about it, though." 
Due to limited ice availability, many teams have seen action only once. One team, Alumni, has yet to play. 
Thursday night saw two games in action. Sorin defeated Fisher in a close game, 4-3, by scoring two goals in the final two minutes ofplay. Ken Richelson scored all three goals for Fisher. 
Off Campus then faced Grace in a well-attended game, but the two teams were left in a standoff, 2-2. A fight at the beginning of the second period resulted in the ejection of two players from the contest.

"You have to be able to play under any circumstances," he said. "You should always be ready to play. Still, we're not the type of team who can afford to miss a practice." 
Neither Phelps nor his players seemed overly concerned about the effects of the loss on the team's con­fidence. "We just need to win on Monday" was the common response.

playmaker only averages 3.5 points a game, but ranks high on the team in assists. 
Harold Starks and Keith Lomax have each been starters at one time during the year, but now come off the bench. Starks, a 6-0 junior guard, leads the team in assists and steals, while also scoring 6.3 points a game. Lomax, a 6-6 senior forward, puts in 
5.5 points a game for the Friars, and Is third on the team in rebounding. 
Matt Palazzi comes off the bench In every game to provide plenty of scoring. The 6-2 freshman guard averages 7.9 points a game, includ­ing a team high 28 against Holy Cross. He also shoots 90.0 percent from the free throw line. 
Notre Dame assistant coach Jim Baron scouted the Friars in their 65 · 57 loss to Villanova, and feels that they are strong in several key areas. 
"Providence is a pretty good team. lbey have good size and really shoot the ball well from the outside," said Baron. "Weller is a very good player and Knight is effec­tive around the basket. Palazzi is a good shooter as their first substi· tute." 
Providence should be a stronger opponent than it appears to be on paper. Although the Friars are only playing at a .500 clip, their losses in­clude some tough conference teams, plus defeats at the hands of Dayton and Marquette. The Friars are capable ofpulling offan upset, as they did in their first contest of the season, beating Virginia, 75-71.
