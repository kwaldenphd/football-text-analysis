By PETER AMEND 
News Writer 
A pntition calling on President Gt~orgP Bu!ih not to takP offen­sive military action against Iraq, which has bl\r.n circulatnd on ttw t:ampusps of NotrP Dame and Saint Mary's, has already rHceiv11d more than 1,.')00 signatures. 
NotrP Dame graduate student .Janet Meissner organized the Notre Dame Gulf Crisis Action Group. which has made the pe­tition a success. "Right now it's just an ad hoc group come together. but we will be seeking official status." Meissner said. 
"Our main push right now is the petition drive," she said. The group will hold a press conference today at 1:30 p.m. in the Center for Social Con­cerns, after which they will send the petition to the White !louse. 
Meissner said the petition group has sought support from various student groups and representative bodies as well. 
Other fdeas the group has discussed are the planning of a vigil, a letter-writing campaign if and when congress convenes on the Gulf Crisis issue, and forming coalitions with differ­ent groups on campus and in the local, surrounding area. 
The group has held three or­ganizational meetings so far,

There has been speculation that any military move to drive Iraq out of Kuwait would take place in the lirst several months of the year, and the Iraqi offer to free the hostages during that time appeared aimed at staving off such a strike. 
In a move meant to under­score U.S. readiness for war, American troops tried to stage a full-scale practice assault on a stretch of Saudi beach on Sunday. High winds and heavy seas, however, prevented hovercrafts from making land­ings. In more limited maneu­vers, troops came ashore by helicopter while U.S. and Bri­tish warplanes provided simu­lated air cover.

24-hour lounge to open next semester but its future hinges ~n budget limits 
By ANN MARIE HARTMAN 
News writer 
Tht! future of an on-campus eo-ed twenty-four hour lounge beyond the spring semester of 199 I lays in the hands of the Administration Budget Commit­tee. 
The basement of LaFortune will be the site of a 24-hour lounge that will begin operation next semestPT. 
Financing the salary for a student monitor has been an obstade to operating the lounge in past years, and could prevent the continuation of operations of the lounge after next semester. 
Rob Pasin and Fred Tombar, student body president and vice-president, recently submit­ted a proposal to the budget committee asking for funds to 
finance a twenty-four hour lounge in LaFortune's base­ment. 
Joe Cassidy, director of stu­dent activities, gave his ap­proval to have the lounge in LaFortune this spring semester. 
The money to pay the salary of the student monitor will be coming from the contingency fund of the Student Senate Budget Committee. Cassidy has agreed to include this salary when drawing up the budget for student activities next year. 
"Now the only problem is that the Administration Budget Committee needs to decide whether or not the service of a twenty-four hour lounge is a priority of their committee," said Tombar. 
The decision of the committee will dictate whether or not such a lounge will exist in future semesters. 
The twenty-four hour lounge will open regardless of the committees recommendation in the spring semester 1991. 
Cassidy will be interviewing and accepting applications for the position of student monitor within the next few weeks. 
The twenty-four hour lounge will consist of the current lounge area in the basement of Lafortune. Access to other ar­eas of LaFortune will be dosed off after 2 a.m.. 
The vending machines and restrooms that are not available to students who use the twenty­four hour computer lab will be made so to all students who will be utilizing the lounge and computer lab area. 
Security for this lounge will be provided by a student moni­tor with assistance from cam­pus security. 

and over fifty students have at­tended at least one of the meet­ings. 
"I think at the Peace Institute as well as my sense of students campus-wide, there is a real broad spectrum of opinions ... Well over half the students that we have asked to sign the peti­tion have been willing to sign it," Meissner said. 
In regard to President Bush's aggressive attitude toward the gulf situation, Meissner stated, "I think the economic sanctions can be very effeetive and I think that diplomatic overtures can be very effective. And just to say 'my patience is wearing thin' is too bad. Let's get things in perspective." 
"We were born during Viet­nam and do not renHlmbnr that experience...yet we have to remember our larger history and I think it's really important that our generation speak out on this now," Meissner said. 
Malloy and mayor dedicate homeless shelter addition

What were the mayor of the city and the president of the university doing in a homeless shelter? 
"The sun's out, and there's warmth in our hearts," said Notre Dame president Edward Malloy as he opened the dedication for the major expansion of South Bend's Center for the Homeless on Saturday. 
"The measure of any com­munity is how we take care of those who are unfortunate," said South Bend Mayor Joseph Kernan. 
Allied-Signal, Inc.'s donation of $400,000 to Notre Dame for use in the local homeless she!­
ter paved the way for new con­struction, including 13 family rooms, a new dormitory ca­pable of accommodating 40 women, and a children's play­room for activities organized by Junior League volunteers, ac­cording to Dennis Moore, di­rector of the Notre Dame De­partment of Public Helations and Information. 
"We have an obligation to this community and every community in the land, and we try to respond in a generous way," continued Malloy at the morning dedication. 
Notre Dame law students will staff the newly expanded office space for legal aid. The Center employs 12 full-time staff

"I stayed as long as I could," said a woman from San Clemente, Calif., who would not give her name. "Kuwait went from the top to total destruc­tion." 
The official Iraqi News

INSIDE COLUMN 
We are ND; unless we lose, that is 

So we lost. And boy, did it hurt. 
It hurt many people for many reasons. It was the last home game for us seniors. To exaggerate a bit, it's the end of a pe­


riod of our lives, and Florentine we wanted the last Hoelker game to be a winner. Assoc. News Editor 
It wasn't. 
My parents came up for their first and last Notre Dame football game, and I wanted them to see us win. We didn't. 
There was that National Championship thing in the balance, and we all wanted to be assured that we would likely win it. We weren't. 
We were all terribly disappointed, and justifiably so, for it was the second home loss, the second home loss, to a team we shouldn't have lost to, and I sure as hell didn't want it to happen during my senior year. It was unreal. The worst part was that the senior members of the team didn't say goodbye to us, didn't acknowledge their fans, didn't hold up their golden helmets in a final act of farewell after the game. 
But there was something even more dis­turbing, more disappointing than all this. I'm not going to fault the football team for not saying farewell. I felt terrible after the game; the feeling of loss must have been so much the worse for them. I wouldn't have felt like saying goodbye either. 
The disturbing thing was people's reac­tions to it all. Once things started looking really bad, no one did the "Lou" cheer. The numbers of people criticizing Lou and the entire team were immense. It was if the 1988 National Championship season never happened, as if Lou had never done a good job coaching, as if the team had never done anything good. 
I can't guess Lou's reasoning for calling certain plays or not calling time out, but it's not as if we've been out of the top 20 under his coaching. How we love him when we al­ways win, but God forbid he make a mistake or let us down once. How quickly the tides turn. 
Are we suddenly embarrassed to go here? Is Lou such a bad coach so suddenly? Is the team so bad so quickly? Of course not. It's the same coach and mostly the same team we had two years ago. . 
We are ND. You either understand that and live it or you don't. The fair weather fans don't understand if. All the rich his­tory, the traditions, are a part of us. We relish and support Lou and the team be­cause they are a part, some would say the richest part, of what NO is about. They have given us so much, and I'll be damned if people forget so soon what was so great. 
An editor of mine once wrote that not only are we NO, but NO is us. ND is us. Think about that. We make ND what it is now. Lou, the team, faculty, the students, are all a part. We can't forget that so easily.

WORLD 
The Soviet military plans to cut its manpower and weaponry to make the armed forces more efficient and less of a burden on the state, the chief of staff was quoted as saying Sunday. A draft of the 10-year, three-stage re­structuring plan has been forwarded to the Supreme So­viet legislature, said Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, the armed forces chief of staff. He made his comments in an inter­view with ·the military newspaper Red Star. The newspa­per also quoted an official identified as only Col. M. Ponomarev as saying: "Today, we have no apprehensions, nor do we suspect any nation of planning a war against 
the Soviet Union. 
Paul McCartney's birth certifi­cate was raffied off in Houston on Sunday. A 26-year-old Beatles fan who got interested in the group almost a decade after it broke up paid $18,000 for what's said to be the real thing. ''I'm just a Beatles freak and I had to have it," said Brian Taylor of Washington, D.C. "It's a hobby that's gone a little too far."

A campus-wide, ecumenical Thanksgiving prayer service will take place today at 7:30 p.m. in Sacred Heart Church. Father Alfred D'Alonzo, chaplain for campus prayer groups, will preside at the service, during which donations of food and money will be collected for needy people in the Michiana region. Gospel music will be pro­vided by Notre Dame's Voices of Faith Choir, and there will be readings and prayers offered by rep­resentatives of several of the University's reli­gious communities. 

A mass grave has been discovered in Kanchanaburi, Thailand near the site where more than 100,000 Asian slave workers and Allied prisoners died building a rail­road for the Japanese during World War II. The remains of several hundred people have been dug up since Tues­day, when the excavation began. It is being carried out by the Pothipawana Songkroh Foundation, which for reli­gious reasons, wants to provide proper burials. Several dozen workers were digging Sunday in a sugar cane field in Kanchanaburi province, about 70 miles west of Bangkok. One skull was left out overnight -but workers first covered it with paper so it would not be cold.

Palestinian headmaster shot dead in schoolyard 
.IEHUSALEM (AP) -A Pales­tinian headmaster was shot dead in front of his pupils in a sehoolyard Sunday for allegedly eollaborating with Israel, Arab rnports said. 
Another Arab was killed in the oeeupied West Bank village of .labaiJ. by armnd Palestinians, the army said. 
Masked assailants shot the headmaster. 31-year-old Saleh Salem llijazi, in the head as he linished an English lesson and was leaving the elass in the Habah el Adaweyeh girls' high sehool in the Gaza Strip town of Hafah. the reports said. The army eonfirmed the killing. 
Gralliti painted on the school walls claimed responsibility on behalf of a group calling itself el-Fahed el-Aswad, which means Black Leopard. 
ltim, the Israeli news agency, said it was the third time an al­leged collaborator has been killed inside a Gaza Strip school in reeent months. 
Arab reports said the as­sailants in Jabaa were collabo­rators who were armed by Is­rael to defend themselves. The dead man was identified as Muhammad Sharaim. 
The deaths brought to 302 the number of Arabs killed by fellow Palestinians. most on suspicion of collaborating with Israel. 
Some 773 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli army and civilian gunfire in the 35­month-old uprising. Fifty-two Israelis have died in the vio­lence. 
At least live Palestinians were wounded by Israeli army gun­lire in scattered stone-throwing riots in the occupied territories, including an 8-year-old girl hit in the hand, Arab reports said. 
At the weekly Cabinet meet­ing, Economics Minister David Magen proposed halving the Arab labor force in Israel by lining employers who hire non­lsraelis. 
With unemployment running at 9 percent, Magen believed his proposal would open 50,000 jobs for the country's 92,000 people out of work, including

Father Curran is focus of dispute at Auburn Univ. 
AUBUHN, Ala. (APJ -An academic dispute with roots in the Vatican is growing at Auburn University, a state sehool known more for produc­ing farmers and football players than Roman Catholic rifts. 
The controversy centers on Fath1~r Charles Curran, who was selected for an endowed professorship at Auburn although he is the only Ameri­can barred by Rome from teaching Catholic theology. His views on topics such as abor­tion and eontraception have put him at odds with the Vatican for years. 
But it was Curran's treatment by Auburn President James Martin that has enraged the university senate, a faculty-staff body. 
Martin denied tenure for Cur­ran, although the post was ad­vertisnd as being a tenured ­or permanent -position, and hasn't explained his decision publicly or to Curran. He denies the conclusion of a senate committee that he violated uni­versity tenure policies. 
"Thus far he's the most con­troversial person we have ever hired," Martin said in an inter­view Thursday. 
The senate scheduled a spe­cial meeting for Tuesday to dis­cuss Curran's treatment, and chairman Gary Mullen said the senate is likely to take some kind of formal stance against Martin. 
"The action could range from doing nothing, which is not ex­pected at all, to requesting tenure ... to a formal censure of the president," Mullen said. 
A blowup over religious be­liefs and academic freedom is uncharacteristic at Auburn, a land-grant school in a mostly Protestant state with 21,000 students and a reputation for achievement in agriculture and athletics. Last year, its religion department had only two full-· time teachers and a pair of graduates. 
But academic eruptions are not completely foreign to Auburn in east-central Al­abama. The school was cen­sured in 1983 by the American Association of University Pro­fessors following another tenure dispute, and the rebuke has not been lifted. 
Curran, author of 20 books on Christian ethics and morality, lost his last tenured position ­at Catholic University in Washington -in 1986. The Vatican said his dissenting views on conservative church positions made him unfit to teach theology. 
Among other things, he sup­ports abortion in limited cir­cumstances. 
Since then, Curran has held temporary posts at Cornell University and the University of Southern California, where he was working when Auburn called.

While Curran's views earned a Vatican rebuff, they have not cut him off from the rest of the church. Some 750 Catholic the­ologians have signed a state­ment backing him, and the Uni­versity of Notre Dame continues to publish his books. He has been president of three major theological societies. 
"He's considered quite mod­erate, actually. He's fairly con­servative," said John Ehmann, administrative director of Notre Dame Press. 
"Only a right-wing fanatic would refer to Charlie Curran as a way-out theologian," said Father Richard McBrien, head of theology at Notre Dame. "The Vatican is way out. He's a centrist." 
"A tiny minority of Catholics in Alabama has influenced an academic decision at a major state institution," said McBrien. 
Curran said his views repre­sent those of the Catholic main­stream. McBrien said Curran has been a target for Rome since 1968, when he led opposi­tion to a Vatican decree against artificial birth control. 
Curran's post is a new en­dowed chair created through a program approved by the Al­abama Legislature. The "eminent scholars" plan is supposed to boost the reputa­tions of state-supported schools by attracting leading academicians. 
The university advertised the chair nationwide as being a

Love, Malini, Sully, Michelle, Wendy, Kerri, Colleen, and Cece 
tenured position -meaning it was a lifetime job except for severe misconduct. Curran said it was with that understanding that he decided to take the job, after he was recommended by a search committee and dis­cussed it with a school vice president. 
"I wouldn't have gotten near the thing if I didn't think it was tenured," Curran, 56, said last week. 
But Curran said that once he had called Auburn to formally accept the chair, he was told Martin had decided against tenure. Curran said he had little choice but to come to Auburn for this school year, having turned down other job offers in favor of the Auburn post. 
Martin and Auburn's trustees have denied that any outside pressure led to the decision. The sole Catholic on Auburn's board, Bessie Mae Holloway, has denied any involvement in the tenure decision. But Curran said Catholic Archbishop Oscar Lipscomb of Mobile told him of twice talking with Mrs. Hol­loway, although Lipscomb de­nies being against Curran's hiring. 
The episode has been a dis­appointment for Curran, who had hoped to put his disputes with Rome behind him. 
"One of my reasons for even thinking of Auburn is it would be a quiet place where I could fade into the woodwork and do my work," he said.

Supreme Court rejects CNN bid to show tapes 
WASHINGTON {AP) -The Supreme Court refused by a 7-2 vote Sunday to give Cable News Network permission to broad­cast tape recordings of conver­sations between Panama's Gen. Manuel Noriega and his lawyers. 
The court rejected an emer­gency request by CNN that was aimed at lifting a federal judge's order forbidding the broadcasts until he could de­termine what the tapes dis­close. 
The emergency request had called the Nov. 8 order by U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler in Miami an unconstitutional "prior restraint" of free speech. But only two justices -Thurgood Marshall and Sandra Day O'Connor -agreed with that assessment. 
Voting against CNN were Chief Justice William H. Rehn­quist and Justices Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmun. John Paul Stevens. Antonio Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter. 
The Justice Department had joined with Noriega's lawyers in opposing the request. 
In addition to the emergency request, the court also turned down a formal appeal filed by the cable network, in a one­sentence order. 
CNN President Tom Johnson called the court's decision "a loss of a battle in a continuing war against censorship." 
Johnson said the network would immediately turn the tapes in its possession over to Judge Hoeveler. He said CNN is "confident that after he reviews them he. will decide on the mer­its to deny the prior restraint."

would take place that mars the atmosphere of peace," said the news agency. 
The White House dismissed the move as another ploy by Saddam, and repeated its de­mand that all the captives be unconditionally freed. 
White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, in Paris with the president, called the move a "cynical attempt... to manipu­late families' hopes and fears." 
Western governments in the past have denounced efforts by Saddam to use the captives as leverage in the gulf crisis. 
Bush, in Germany en route to Paris, conferred with Chancel­lor Helmut Kohl about the anti­Iraq alliance, which has assem­bled tens of thousands of troops in the gulf region. 
Bush called on the German leader to help "keep the coali­tion together." Kohl, in a radio interview, underscored the need to do everything possible to resolve the gulf crisis diplomatically before resorting to force. 

Although Bush has spoken in strong terms about the possi­bility of a military strike, he played down any differences of opinion. 
"We're not ruling out any op­tions, we're not ruling any op­tions in," he said. 
Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev were to join leaders of 20 other nations in Paris signing a conventional forces treaty that reduces troop and arms levels in Europe. From Paris, Bush was flying to the Mideast, and planned to spend Thanksgiving with U.S. soldiers in the gulf region. 
Gorbachev, who met with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican before leaving for Paris, said he believes there is a peaceful way out of the gulf crisis.

A caveat for Christmas shoppers 
Special to The Observer 
Although experts are predict­ing retail sales to be down sharply this season, the period between Thanksgiving and Christmas is still the busiest time of year for both businesses and consumers. The Better Busirwss Bureau of Michiana has issued some tips for consumers as they do their hol­iday shopping. 
1.) Always ask about a store's refund and exchange policy befort• buying an item. 
Stores have a right to set their own refund and exchange policins. Thny do not have to accnpt returns, except in in­stances whern a product has a manufacturing defect. 
2.) Save all sales slips and hang tags to avoid hassle, in the event a refund or exchange is necessary. 
3.) Comparison shop. 
Although this is simply com­mon sense, many consumers do not shop around for the best prices, according to the Better Business Bureau. Just because a store bills an item as a 'special purchase' or 'on sale,' it does not mean that they have the lowest prices. 
4.) Beware of counterfeit products. 
If a brand name product is selling for much cheaper than normal, use caution. If it does not come in the typical packag­ing, if the trademark is smudged or strange, if the product is being sold by a street vendor or out of the back of a truck, it could be a counterfeit product. 
Buying phony merchandise hurts legitimate retailers and the quality of such merchandise is usually significantly lower than the real thing. Fake Rolex watches tarnish quickly and

Indiana graduates fail in job-related skills 
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -A team of leading business execu­tives said Friday they are fed up with the poorly trained workers Indiana's schools produce and proposed a massive reform of the state education system. 
The men who direct Eli Lilly & Co., Cummins Engine Co. and other Fortune 500 companies said the state is threatening its own economic development by producing workers who cannot read, write, compute or com­municate. 
Not only do schools in Indiana rate near the bottom when compared with other states, but American students as a whole lag behind those of other nations, the executives said. 
Their initiative demonstrated corporate America's frustration with the nation's schools. It also follows studies that suggest a crisis in U.S. education at a time when workers require better training to compete in a global marketplace. 
"If the business community in this state really believes that education has to get a lot better, and believes that it has a vested interest in making sure that happens, then the burden is on us to come forward with ideas, with a plan, to make it better," said James Baker, chairman of Arvin Industries in Columbus. 
"Some will say that we should leave it to the experts... We've tried that. But as the facts show, it hasn't worked," he said. 
Baker, who is also chairman of the U.S. Chamber of Com­merce, presented the execu­
~ tives' four-point reform pack­age to a luncheon gathering of more than 1,000 businessmen, educators and public policy­makers at the Indiana Conven­tion Center. The four points, presented only as general ideas, were: 
• 
Prepare children at an early age for the rigors of education. 

• 
Set school standards high enough so students are pre­pared to enter the work force. 

• 
Free teachers from burden­some regulations. 

• 
Allow parents, whether wealthy or poor, to send their children to the schools of their choice. 


"The time has come to put the education spotlight on the child, not the system," Baker said. "Public education should mean tax dollars to educate children, not to support school systems." 
Henry Schacht. chairman of Cummins Engine Co., also in Columbus, said the executives' education blueprint grew out of discussions that began about a year ago and included consulta­tions with Gov. Evan Bayh, State Superintendent of Public Instruction H. Dean Evans, leg­islators, parents and teachers. 
They also consulted recent education studies by two policy research centers, the Brookings Institution and the Hudson In­stitute. 
Hudson, in its landmark 1987 study "Workforce 2000," said companies in the next century will require greater productiv­ity and more versatile skills from their workers. 
"If the economy is to grow rapidly and American compa­nies are to reassert their world leadership, the educational standards that have been estab­lished in the nation's schools must be raised dramatically ... " the report said. "From an eco­nomic standpoint, higher stan­dards in the schools are the equivalent of competitiveness internationally." 

Capitalism: Another crusade to save the world? 
By Oliver Williams 
With the recent economic upheaval in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, the leaders of those nations are increasingly relying on "capitalism" as the solution to their problems of scarcity. llardly a day goes by that we do not read of one or another Soviet official championing the "capitalistic" way. It will be interesting to see how capi­talism thrives in these coun­tries, especially in those without a tradition of the prophetic voice of the churches. Can there be a perduring capitalism without continual moral forces critiquing its abuses? 
In the United States, one reason capitalism has survived, and even thrived, is that the churches have repeatedly and successfully challenged the system to be more humane.That is to say, the economic system that people call capitalism has evolved with time and circumstances, and even today there are a number of kinds of capitalism in various nations throughout the globe. 
The key characteristic of a capitalist economy is that it relies on a market system to solve the fundamental economic problem: what should be produced, who should produce it, how should it be produced, and for what people. Referred to as the "free market" system, it requires a private property system (property and contract Jaws) and a voluntary exchange system (the legal freedom to come together and buy and sell goods). 
Typically a market system is contrasted with the other major way of solving the fundamental economic problem, a command system. When a command sys­tem governs an economy there is no diffusion of power but rather a single authority or group makes all the decisions, as, for example, the "central planning system" of the Soviet Union formerly functioned. Un­like capitalism, in this com­mand system the government owns the means of production. 
Capitalism is much more hu­mane today than it was at the turn of the century. For the past one • hundred years the okurches have been strident in their condemnation of many of those practices that have made profit at the expense of the dignity of the workers. Such practices as the right to orga­nize into independent unions, relief from the twelve-hour day and the seven-day week, social security, unemployment insur­ance, medical insurance and child labor laws were all cen­tral issues in church documents criticizing capitalism. Today we take things for granted, but they were often won only with great effort by the churches and other concerned moral groups in society. 
The insight of religious social teaching as applied in various circumstances throughout the last century, is that capitalism without a context in a humane community seems inevitably to shape people into greedy and insensitive human beings. Thus, the church teaching accepts the market economy but with a key qualification, that the state in­tervene where essential to pro­mote and protect the human dignity. 
According to Pope John XXIII: "At the outset it should be affirmed that in economic affairs first place is to be given to the private initiative of indi­viduals who, either working by themselves, or with others in one fashion or another, pursue their common interests. But in this matter ... it is necessary that public authorities take active interest. the better to increase output· of goods and to further social progress for the benefit of all citizens" (Mater et Magistra, Paragraph 55). 
Some disciples of Adam Smith believed in God's providence working to insure the common good, a self-regulating econ­omy. Religious social thought says, in effect, that we must make God's work our own, that we must have a conscious care for the common good. This sometimes requires government regulation of the market. To be sure, regulation is tricky business and the good consequences sought are often elusive. A failure in a particular regulation is no argument against regulation, however, but rather one for better regu­lation. The continual refrain of religious social teaching is that all efforts must be made to promote and protect human dignity. 

Recent statements on the church and the economy, par­ticularly the 1986 document by the U. S. bishops, have played a major role by raising the level of discussion in the wider soci­ety of the moral dimension of economic decisions. Whether one agrees with the policy rec­ommendations or not, what be­comes clear in the ensuing de­bates is that tradeoffs are inevitable. 
While no one doubts that a society must continue to pro­duce wealth, there is always a concern by church teaching for some equity or fairness in how wealth is distributed. There is also concern for the quality of 
life and the fear that an 
inordinate focus on material 
prosperity overshadows these 
broader considerations. 
Concern for the environment, 
fairness in distribution as well 
as the general quality of 
human relations are all 
recognized as proper issues 
for public policy. 
Just where to draw the line 
on harnessing the free market 
through regulation to promote 
rights and justice in the mixed 
economy of a society is no 
easy task and is often solved 
best by trial and error. The 
debate goes on! What is 
certain is that because of 

these debates in the past, the · capitalism of late twentieth century America is far more humane than that of the turn 
of the century. 
The capitalism of the future 
in the U.S. and the western 
world promises to be even 
more humane if the church 
continues to champion the 
cause of human dignity 
realized in community. Will 
the countries adopting 
capitalism in our times, 
particularly the Soviet Union 
and Eastern Europe, ex­
perience a similar dynamic? 
Only time will tell.

In commemoration of North American Days Against Racism, November 19 and 20, sponsored by Democratic Socialists of America Youth Section (USA) and New Democratic Youth of Canada, DSA NDISMC formed an ad hoc student coalition against racism. This coalition, comprised of ten student organizations, has written the following open letter to the administration regarding the issue of adopting an official racial policy at the University ofNotre Dame. Dear Editor: 
At the end of the fall semester, 1989, the Provost's Office organized an ad hoc committee to write a racial harassment policy at the University of Notre Dame. This committee, whose members included students, faculty, and staff, did, in fact, produce a statement by the end of the spring semester. The committee came up with a statement which, in their view, condemns racial harassment while respecting the First Amendment right of free speech and the principle of academic freedom. 
While we find these efforts encouraging, at the same 
Dear Editor: 
"The Student Weekly," a recent addition to our campus newspaper selection, should be an embarrassment to the entire Notre Dame student body. Its latest issue, which appeared Nov. 11, was plagued with appalling 
grammatical errors.  Either

time, we are disappointed by the scarcity of available information concerning the current status on adopting this racial statement as policy. Such a policy would both define racial harassment and discrimination and outline a formal complaint procedure. 
Given the urgency of this is­sue, we are submitting the fol­lowing demands: 
(1) 
that a specific procedure for the final approval of the aforementioned racial statec ment be outlined, including a timetable with a final deadline of approval by March 1, 1991; 

(2) 
that an approved policy be incorporated in the next edition ofdu Lac;

editor's commentary contained at least 15 errors), or the writers have absolutely no command of the English language. For example, one headline read: "Parking Situation Needs Rectified," while in two other short articles, the word candidate was misspelled seven times. 
An additional publication on our campus is a worthwhile pursuit, but only when the result is professional. Perhaps, with a more conscientious effort, this newspaper would be worthwhile and informative reading material, but, in its current form, it is truly a disgrace..

'Sampledelic' music combines 60s with 90s 
Znn-stud Jeffrny Swann, in his book "Toehold on Zen," said "We have a mind full of whirling thoughts which appear to have a life of their own, and beeause of their presence there is no tranquility in us." So whern do we go for some tran­quility'? some peace of mind? 
Hhythm and spiel~ 
There's a band down the highway... and their drum­rnnr's name is Mickey Hart. llart finds his own psyche's psustenance in the art of drumming. In his recent inter­view with the New Age .Journal, he shares his esoterically appe­tizing experience in percussion. 
"Exploring the spirit side of the drum has been the adven­turn of my adulthood, if not my whole lifn. From the age of ten until forty, all I did was drum. Obsi)Ssively. Passionately. Painfully. 
"For almost as long as I can renuHnber, playing the drum has stimulated certain changes in my consciousness. My body awarennss starts to fade, time disappears, and instead of blood it feels like some other juice pumping through my veins." 
Hart has enjoyed his musi­cally inspired journey with the drums for all 25 years he has played for the San Francisco-
based group, The Grateful Dead. 
On the same menu as rhythm, a fresh theory regarding dream analysis was published in Scientific America this month discussing the brain signal known as theta rhythm. 
Neural control of REM sleep (when you dream) is centered in the brain stem. And during HEM, neural signals proceed from the brain stem to the vi­sual cortex (the center of your visual proeessing). These brain stem neurons initiate a sinu­soidal wave in the hippocam­pus. And this signal is called the theta rhythm. 
What's the point? 
Jonathon Winson of Roeke­feller University, based on his diseoveries from his and other neuroscientifie laboratories, determined that the different occurrenees of theta rhythm could be understood in terms of behavior (in this case animal bnhavior, sinee he studied rab­bits, rats and such). 
Awake animals seemed to show theta rhythm when they were behaving in ways most crucial to their survival. 
In other words, said Winson, "theta rhythm appeared when they exhibited behavior that was not genetieally encoded, such as feeding or sexual be­havior, but rather a response to 

changing environmental in­fluences." 
Winson thinks that the pres­ence of theta rhythm during REM sleep might reflect a neu­ral process whereby informa­tion essential to the survival of a species was reprocessed into memory while dreaming. 
Concludes Winson, "I suggest that dreams reflect an individ­ual's strategy for survival. The subject of dreams are broad­ranging and complex, incorpo­rating self-image, fears, inse­curities, strengths, grandiose ideas, desire, jealousy and love."

My humorous 'head-in-a-tightened-vice' interview with The Dead Milkmen 
By FRAN MOYER 
Accent Writer 
"I had a friend in college," bngan .Jon .Jack Talcum, the quint guitarist of tlw Dead Milknwn. "who onen said onn of tlw most courageous things you could do is go up to a person and say, 'smnll me,' and lift your arms up." 
Yns, I had thrown myself into that humorous "head-in-a­tightnnnd-vicn" thren-ringed circus that surrounds an intf)r­vinw with those brutally sarcas­tic smart-aleck Philadelphians. 
I low was I so fortunate? Well, I went to Pennridge High School in Pnrkasie, Pa. 
"Pennridge," you may scoff, "so what, big deal, you stupid product of public education. I went to the ivory-towed Choate." You naive students, howevnr, do not realize that, bncause I went to Pennridge, I had the privilege to attend the same high school as the drum­mer of the Dead Milkmen, Dean Clean, and be taught European history by his father, Mr. Clean (no, not that bald-headed deaning dude). 
It was through these high­placed connections that I was granted an interview with the world famous Milkmen on the Chieago stop of their "Amuck in America Tour" (or as the band wanted to call it-"The Two Fisted Toad-Lieker Tour"). 
After kicking out reporters from Holling Stone and Spin, the red carpet was laid out for my visit and I. along with my two ND Dead Milkheads, Jill and Carolyn, was escorted down the rusty iron steps that lnad to the basement of the Riv­iera, the locale of the interview. 
As I walked into the plush spackle-laden interview room, I saw them. In front of me was thn meek-looking Talcum, to my right the scraggly-haired Clean, and to my far right the unshaven, talkative, Yankee baseball hat-wearing vocalist Hodney Amadeus Anonymous. The only Milkman not present for tl111 interview was bassist Dave Blood, who showed up only to snag a few pistachios. 
Knowing the serious nature of these artists (a tnrm they hold with the utmost respect), I asked them about the allega­tions that the title for Prince's new album, Grafliti Bridge, was stolen from their most recent album, Metaphysical Grafliti. 
Almost immediately they chimed in together about how they are always having their ideas stolen. 
"We get ripped off all the time," stated Anonymous boldly. 
"Yeah," followed up Talcum, "we got ripped of by Zeppelin way back when." 
In faet, their previous album was to be called Forever Your Girl. but, according to the ever outspoken Anonymous, "somebody stole the title out from underneath us." Some people never get any respect! 
I could sense that my first question had piqued the inter­est of the band, so I decided to question them on the touchy subject concerning the reeently formed WDLFDM (Widow's of Deceased Lactic Fluid Delivery Men) PAC. 
Anonymous, who never missed an opportunity to talk, quite eloquently said, "I am glad this PAC does exist now because it is one segment of the community that ... has bee~ ignored. You never see them represented in the polls ... I want to see politicians cater themselves towards this seg­ment of the population." 
As one can see, this band is not devoid of social conscious­ness. They are concerned with the plight of all types of people. Shame on you sensitive liberals who picture this band as a group of uneoncerned brats. 
At this point, the door was opened for me to ask the most anticipated question, "How did you come up with the name Dead Milkmen?" 
"We just wanted to get people irked," stated Talcum. 
According to Anonymous, the band was almost Husker Du or Area Code SIN, but then "all of a sudden, this milkman got shot in Kensington [a section of Philadelphia], and that sort of settled it." 
"There also were a lot of other bands with the name Dead in it," interjected Clean, "so we figured we might as well jump on the milk truck, so to speak." 
After getting those mundane questions out of the way, I was ready to explore the artistic and philosophical facets of their songs. Some of you may laugh and even have the audacity to think the Milkmen have no philosophy. You, however, are wrong. 
First on the agenda was to find the band's Christ-figure, a figure all modern-day "hip" bands must have. When asked if Stuart, the main character in "Stuart" from the album Beelzebubba, was the band's Christ figure, Anonymous sim­ply stated "No ... he was our roadie. Right now he makes designer LSD for a large re­search university." 
How about Bucky Fellini, the inspiration for the 1987 album, Bucky Fellini? 
"No," began Anonymous "he was our keyboard player, but the Hit Factory in New York City comes the latest in a grow­ing musical trend that combines expansive 60s undertones with digitally sampled material made of funk, soul and even disco (uh, oh). Something like that anyway. 

Deee-Lite is the name of one of the latest of these groups producing what they call "sampledelic" music. Or, as they eloquently put it, "Three cultures unifying in the age of comm~nication, zoomed to the realm of holographic cos­groove." 
If you've seen the video for their current hit, "Groove is in the Heart," the visuals are an experience in themselves. With the help of Q-Tip (yes, Q-Tip) from A Tribe Called Quest, Deee-Lite (composed of Super DJ Dmitry, Jungle DJ Towa Towam and the Lady Miss Kier Kirby) definitely do a fine re­make of the classic song. 
Though the combination of various musical styles and sounds do focus heavily on the mechanized, digital, pounding rhythms that so dominated the 80s throughout their debut re­lease, there's also flashes of barrier breaking brilliance hid­den behind the machines. Pos­sibly the beginnings of some­thing? 
he got crushed by a tractor trailer. 
Not to worry, however, the Milkmen do have a Christ-fig­ure-Cheesehead. 
According to Anonymous, "Cheesehead is this being we worship, who has a head shaped like a wedge of eheese, an arm that ends in a Michael Jackson glove, another arm that is a tentaele and one leg that ends in three reptilian toes." 
Freaky, huh? But the saga does not end there. 
"In fact," continued Anony­mous "there are four cheese­heads. They are kind of like the Mutant Ninja Turtles-Swiss Cheesehead, Blue Cheesehead, Linderburger Cheesehead and Nacho Cheesehead. They are mutated beings who keep the mall dean. This mall is a giant mobile mall, a mall on wheels, because in the future malls decline because people don't have time to go to the mall, so the mall comes to them. Kind of like the circus." 
Some bread 
It wasn't the beat of a drum or the bell in a bottom that ex­panded the consciousness of 
C.S. Lewis. It was joy, a spedal joy. He shared his experienee in his Novel, "Surprised by Joy," where he described his radical conversion to Christianity. 
"Joy was not a deception. Its visitations were rather the moments of dearest conscious­ness we had, and we became aware of our fragmentary and phantasmal nature and ached for that impossible reunion which would annihilate us or that self-contradictory waking which would reveal, not that we had had, but that we were, a dream," (deep breath here). 
Dessert 
. .. Back to Swann's dilemma. "Here at last is a mind at peace, not doing anything in particular. Mind expresses its existence when it is functioning, and where there is no function­ing-there is NO-MIND. In the moment of peaee-in-the-mind, there is the blooming of the flower of NO-MIND," says Swann. 
Napkin 
And when I woke up she sang, "No one noticed, but the band's all packed and gone. was it ever here it all?" 
Anonymous went on to ex­plain how the Cheeseheads worked in a store called Hadia­tion 'R' Us, which is how they became mutated. In the end, these four Cheeseheads will put their heads together and ereate a wheel of cheese and destroy evil. 
This evil, however, because it is present in the mall, is the op­posite of the evil present in our reality. Who said they don't have a philosophy concerning life? 
After interviewing the Milk­men, I left with a warm fuzzy feeling inside of me. It's nice to know that there are some peo­ple left in this world who can laugh and poke fun at the screwed up world we live in. 
We all need some of that hu­mor that the Milkmen possess so much of. If we did, maybe this world would bn a lot better off. So, don't go to New Mexico to "find yourself." Just listen to a Milkmen album and worship Cheesehead. You won't regret it.

Off-Campus men defeat Alumni for interhall title 
Blitz win women's championship 

By RENE FERRAN 
Sports Writer 
The Off-Campus Crime won the 1990 men's interhall foot­ball championship Sunday by avenging its loss to defending champion Alumni in last year's semifinals and defeating the Dogs 10-6. 
The Crime shut down the high-powered Dog passing at­tack with a variety of different coverages in the secondary, in­tercepting Alumni quarterback .Jim Passinault thrne times. 
On offnnse, Off-Campus used a game plan Alumni fans should be familiar with. Quarterback Bob Allard took three-step drops and threw quiek passes to wide receivers Chuck Moser, Dave Doherty, and tight end .James Dillard. 
"They !Alumni) stacked up on the run, trying to shut it down," said Crime coach Tom Helms, 
Holtz 
continued from page 16 
turnovers while bouncing back from a 21-7 deficit. 
Those turnovers, both inter­ceptions that resulted in 10 points for the Lions, were the most concrete reason Penn State defeated Notre Dame. 
"You can't blame that on anyone but myself," said Irish quarterback Hick Mirer of the second intereeption, which oc­curred with 32 seconds left in the game and resulted in Penn State's winning field goal. "I lofted it and and it sailed on me. We've won a couple with that one and got burned with it." 
Interceptions weren't Mirer's only problem in the second half. After completing seven of 12 passes to start the game, the sophomore quarterback went a dismal one for nine in his worst outing of the season and was sac:ked three times. 
"We put a little bit more pressure (on Mirer)," said Penn State head coach Joe Paterno. "I thought at halftime we were giving their receivers too much mspect and too much room. We "which opened up some passing lanes. Alumni has Pete Parten playing in the middle of the de­fense, and that makes it hard to throw there, so we tried to hit the quick stuff along the sidelines to open up the run." 
Many people gave Alumni the edge at the quarterback posi­tion. However, Allard proved to many Sunday that he deserves some attention also. He com­pleted five of ten passes on the afternoon for 68 yards. 
"They might have said that I'm not that good because we have such a strong running at­taek," said Allard. "I felt, how­ever, that when we needed to pass,we'd do just fine."

played them a little tighter and a little tougher." 
Holtz said Penn State's con­stant and confusing blitzes threw Mirer out of rhythm, especially when combined with Notre Dame's poor field posi­tion. The Irish were never able to start a drive past their own 29-yard line. 
"If you have good field posi­tion, you can do a variety of things," said Holtz. 
The Irish also missed Raghib Ismail in the second half. 
"I don't think you ean lose a player like that and have it not affect the ball game," said Pa­terno of Ismail, who had tallied 109 all-purpose yards, includ­ing four receptions worth 76 yards, before he was forced to the sidelines. 
"There's no doubt we build a lot of our offense around Rocket," said Holtz. 
Holtz added, however, that he blamed the offensive line for not allowing the Irish to estab­lish a rhythm offensively. 
"They won the battle up front," said Holtz of file eighth­ranked defense in the country. 
Notre Dame center Mike Heldt agreed that Ismail's ab­sence should not have change the game's outcome. In the sec-
The Crime struck first early in the second quarter. OfT-Campus drove 66 yards on seven plays, highlighted by a 37-yard completion from Allard to Moser. Brian Doherty capped the drive on a five-yard run, and when Bob Topel added the PAT, the Crime led 7-0 with eight minutes remaining in the first half. 
OtT-Campus quickly was back in business when Antwon Lark stepped in front of split end Pete Parten and intercepted Passinault at the Dog 47. The Crime drove to the 17 before Alumni's defense held, and Topel kicked a 34-yard field goal to give OtT-Campus a 10-0 halftime lead. 
"In the second quarter, they were able to establish the run­ning game," said Dog coach Paul Szyperski. "They hit a couple of big pass plays, and then were able to punch it in." 
ond half, the Irish gained just 55 yards rushing. 
"If the offensive line does its job, anyone should be· able to run through it," said Heldt. "I don't know what the problem was." · 
Notre Dame's main problem, according to Paterno, was that Penn State simply began play­ing to its potential, aided by Lions quarterback Tony Sacca who had the best day of his ca­reer by throwing for 277 yards. 
Holtz, however, blamed his defense for allowing Sacca to complete numerous passes, especially short middle screens. He criticized the backfield for allowing the Lions to convert on third down. 
"We couldn't make the big play on third down," said Holtz. "It's been a big problem all year." 
Holtz did not say why he failed to use his time-outs as the clock ticked down at the end of both halves. With the game tied at 21, Holtz let the clock run down from 7:15 to :44 before he called a time-out. 
"We didn't try to play in con­servatively," said Holtz. "We weren't going to go for the tie. We just never had the critical play at the critical time."

After the intermission, the Dog defense rose to the chal­lenge, keeping Alumni in the game by stopping Off-Campus from controlling the ball and making sustained drives. 
"At halftime, we made several adjustments up front because they were running so effec­tively," said Szyperski. "We also had much better outside con­tainment." 
Alumni's biggest offensive threat came late in the third period. The Dogs drove from their own 47 after a clipping penalty to the Crime 26. There, Passinault tried to hit Parten on a flag pattern, but safety Topel stepped in front a,nd made the interception at the six-yard line. 
Off-Campus was able to get breathing room before Allard made his only mistake of the day. He tried to force a ball into heavy eoverage, and paid the price when Aneel Chablani

Breen-Phillips captured the 1990 women's interhall football crown Sunday with a come­from-behind 14-6 victory over last year's champion Howard. 
Howard scored first with four minutes remaining in the first half. After beginning the drive on its own 40, Howard capped the drive on a fleaflicker. Marianne Haggarty took the reverse, stopped in the backfield, and threw a 25-yard touchdown strike to Theresa Forst in the corner of the end zone. 
At halftime, B.P. regrouped, and came out for the second­half kickoff fired up. 
"We talked about how much we put into this year," said Blitz co-captain Kristin Ballard, "about how much we wanted this championship. We told each other we could do it, and then we went out there and did it." 
The Blitz took the lead on their opening drive of the sec­ond half when Kim Smith threw a seven-yard touchdown pass to Kathy Hardiek, who was open

intercepted the ball at the 24, broke several tackles, and ran for the touchdown with 6:30 remaining in the game. 
On the ensuing kickoff, the Crime managed one first down before having to punt the ball back to Alumni with a little over three minutes left. On second down, OtT-Campus was hit with a face-mask penalty that moved the ball to near midfield, and the Dogs had new life. 
At 'the Crime 34, OtT-Campus put the game, and the champi­onship, out of Alumni's reach when Passinault overthrew Parten on a sideline route, and Tom Helms picked it off. Off­Campus then proeeeded to run out the doek.

in the right flat. Kristi Alkidas ran for the PAT, and it was 8-6 B.P. 
Howard came right back. Undaunted from giving up the lead, Howard marched to the Blitz eight-yard line before stalling. On fourth down, quar­terback Elise Seguin ran a bootleg left and was brought down in the backfield, giving 
B.P. the ball back with a little over four minutes remaining. 
"They only stopped us once the entire game, and that was inside the eight," said lidward coach Kevin Kramer. "I take the blame for that, because I stayed conservative, trying inside running plays which had worked earlier instead of open­ing up the offense more." 
Any hopes for a Howard comeback were dashed when Alkidas broke a simple dive play into a 95-yard touchdown run. Howard had her stopped for no gain, but she turned the corner, broke back against the grain, eluded one tackler, and was ofT to the races. 
"I made it to the corner and then took off," said Alkidas. "Fortunately, I was set up well by good blocks at the line of scrimmage."

in his first meet (versus Michigan St.). This weekend, though, he performed really ex­ceptional. I know he felt good about it," said Irish coach Fran McCann. 
The Irish also received a strong performance from freshman J.J. McGrew, who placed fourth in the 167 lb. class. 
The Irish had hoped to place seven wrestlers in the meet and might have made that goal if five wrestlers had received some breaks. 
Sophomore Emil Soehnlen drew the most difficult assign­ment of the meet, having to wrestle last year's national inc dividual champion Pat Smith of Oklahoma St in the 158 lb. class. Soehnlen fell to the vet­eran champion 5-2, which was the furthest anyone had taken Smith in the meet. 
"I was really pleased with his poise. He was not intimidated by Smith," said McCann. 
One of the Notre Dame's top wrestlers, Steve King, was upset in his second match ver­sus an upstart Missouri wrestler. Junior Marcus Gowens reached the semifinals in the 126 lb., but was beaten by an Oklahoma St. wrestler, who executed a five-point move to beat him. 
Finally, McCann was pleased with the performances of senior tri-captain Todd Tomazic in the 167 lb. weight class and junior Chuck Weaver in the heavyweight division. 
"Oklahoma St. had too much depth. We have a meet coming up with Nebraska, though, and I think we can compete with them. We match up well with Nebraska," said McCann.

SMC triumphs in opener 
By CHRIS BACON Saint Mary's sports editor 
The Saint Mary's basketball team shot off to a great start last Saturday on the road, beating Beloit College in the fi­nal seconds of its season opener, 62-59. 
The Belles got off to a poor start in the first half. They trailBd by a 12-2 margin aft!lr only six minutes of play. But the team battled baek, tying the seor!l at 22-22 with just 6:32 remaining in thll half. The Belles led the game at the half, 34-32. 
"It was quite an uphill battle for us," said Belles !lead Coaeh Marv Wood. "But we got better as we went along." 
"We got off to a bad start," added senior Mea Tettenborn, "but we really put it together." 
In the second half, the Belles stretched their lead to 54-40, thBir largest margin. But poor shooting by Saint Mary's put Bnloit back into the game. With just under a minute to play the Belles' lead was cut to one at 60-59. But the Saint Mary's man-to-man full court press prevailed. With just three sec­onds left, Tettenborn forced a turnover and was fouled. She sank two free throws and iced the victory for the Belles. 
"It was their ball and I forced the turnover. She lost the ball and had to foul me," said Tettenborn. "Overall, though, it was our defense that kept us in the game." 
"Mea had an excellent game. She was really strong in the end when we needed senior leader­ship," added Wood. 
Junior Janet Libbing led the scoring for the Belles, with 15 points, with one three-point conversion and 13 rebounds. Sophomore Kristen Crowley to­talled 11 points, including one three-point shot and 10 re­bounds while junior Catherine Hestovich added 11 points and four assists. Tettenborn tallied 10 points, with one three­pointer, six assists and six steals. 
Overall, the Belles shot 36 percent from the field, 61 per­cent from the line, and had 47 rebounds. Saint Mary's had 19 turnovers, but forced 24 Beloit turnovers. 
"I was pleased to win on the road and against a veteran team," added coach Wood. "Our girls showed a lot of desire, a lot of hustle and a lot of togetherness."

last week, and are hoping to carry the momentum of that victory into the champi­onships. 
Irish Head Coach Joe Piane and senior captain Mike O'Connor are both cautiously optimistic about the. team's chances in today's race. 
"Our first goal is to place in the top ten," said Piane, "and we'd love to place in the top four and get an All­American or two out of the deal." 
"I think we've done some good things this season, and we have the opportunity to do some real good things on Monday," said O'Connor. "If Iowa State doesn't run well, and if we run well, we could win it. It's all Monday. Whatever happens. happens. Now we just worry about running the best we can." 
All-America honors are 
presented to the top 25 
American finishers. 
Interestingly, Notre Dame is 
the top-rankBd team in the 
country comprised of only 
American citizens. This fact 
makes it more likely that one 
or more of the Irish runners 
will receive All-America 
honors, although O'Connor 
was reticent on the subject 
of personal goals. 
"I don't think that anyone 
goes into a meet with per­
sonal goals," said the cap­
tain. "We're just going to try 
to run well as a team." 
Piane doubts that nervous­
ness about individual or 
team goals will have any ef­
fect on his team's perfor­
mance, as most of the run­
ners have experience with 
big meets. 
"Our runners are pretty 
mature," said Piane. 
"Nervousness won't be a big 
problem. It may be a legiti­
mate concern for the other 
teams without experience, 
but these kids have been to 
the dance before."

Holtz shouldn't be blamed for Notre Dame's setback 
It seems that almost every­body knows why Penn State beat Notre Dame 24-21 on Sat­urday. 
"Lou Holtz doesn't know how to call time-outs." 
But while it's questionable to finish a losing effort with four unused time-outs, that's not the reason the Irish lost the football

Notre Dame wasn't going to settle for a tie. 
Not after leading Penn State for three quarters. Not after compiling 21 points and 292 first-half yards against the eighth-ranked defense in the country. And especially not after carrying the No. 1 ranking into the final two weeks of the season. 
Instead, Head Coach Lou Holtz elected to throw over the middle with the Irish facing third-and-eight from their own 19 and just over a minute re­maining in Penn State's 24-21, come-from-behind victory Saturday in Notre Dame Stadium. 
Quarterback Rick Mirer's pass for Tony Smith sailed over the receiver's head and into· the arms of Nittany Lion defensive back Darren Perry, whose in­terception set up Craig Fayak's game-winning, 34-yard field goal with four seconds left in the contest.

Cross country squad running for NCAA title

The Notre Dame men's cross country team will face its final test of the season today when it races against the top 22 teams in the country for the National Championship at the NCAA ,finals in Knoxville, Temi:

football prominence. 
"We weren't going to settle for a tie," Holtz said. "When you go over the middle, there is a 50-50 chance the safety is going to be there. This is a very difficult loss. They didn't have a turnover, and we had two." 
The first Irish turnover proved just as costly. With Notre Dame leading 21-7 near the end of the third quarter, Mirer spotted wideout Shawn Davis near midfield. Penn State inside linebacker Mark D'Onfrio stepped in front of Davis at the Irish 49, however, and returned Mirer's pass 38 yards to the 11. 
Three plays later, Penn State quarterback Tony Sacca found tight end Rick Sayles behind Irish cornerback Jeff Burris in the left corner of the end zone. Sayles bobbled the ball and nearly fell over the end line be­fore gaining control to pull the Nittany Lions to within 21-14. 
"It was an option pass in which I'm supposed to run to the corner," Sayles said. "I took my eye off the ball and juggled it, but I knew I'd make the catch. The hardest part was getting my feet down (in bounds)." 
Penn State tied the game at 21 midway through the fourth quarter when Sacca threw on the run to tight end AI Golden, 


Irish ice Iowa in second round of preseason NIT 
Experience leads to victory 
By RICH KURZ 
Sports Writer 
Conventional coaching wisdom says that experience and free-throw shooting are keys down the stretch in any basketball game. 
That wisdom certainly held

.. 
true Saturday night at the Joyce ACC, where the Fighting Irish, holding a large margin in the experience column, beat Iowa 77-68, in part by converting on 76.2% of its free-throw attempts in the second half. 
With the win Notre Dame advances to the semifinals of the Dodge/NIT Tournament, facing Arizona Wednesday night at Madison Square Garden in New York City. 
The Irish, playing exclusively upperclassmen in the second half, handled a ferocious Iowa press with relative ease, committing only five turnovers in the second half. 
The pesky Hawkeyes, with only eight returning players and no seniors, used their tough defense to stay close to the Irish. Aft.er Elmer B·mnett was forced into a five-second count with 5:23 remaining, Iowa's Kevin Smith canned a trifecta to tie the score at 60. 
Iowa then had a chance to take the lead with 4:02 left when Tim Singleton picked up his thifd personal foul on a reach, sending the Hawkeyes' James Winters to the foul line to shoot one-and-one. Iowa's Acie Earl rebounded the missed first shot, but walked with the ball, turning it over to the Irish. 
LaPhonso Ellis then calmly hit both ends of a one-and-one to give the Irish a two-point lead at 62-60, which they never relinquished. 
Notre Dame went on to make its next seven free throws, while holding the Hawkeyes to only five points in the last 2:04,

Ellis puts team in a 
N.Y. state of mind 
By GREG GUFFEY 
Sports Editor 

There's a different attitude surrounding the Notre Dame basketball players after just two games. 
You might say they're in a New York state of mind. 
And the player heralded as the one who would take them to the promised land is leading them. 
It was junior LaPhonso Ellis who raised his hands tri­umphantly in the air after blocking a shot early in the game. It was also Ellis who held court in the Notre Dame locker room after scoring 20 points to lead the Irish to a 77-68 win over Iowa and vault them into the semifinals of the Dodge NIT in New York City. 
"We're a team," Ellis shouted to whoever would listen as he
