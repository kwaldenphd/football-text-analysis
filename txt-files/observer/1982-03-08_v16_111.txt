REV. THEODORE M. HESBURGH is among seven persons named by the U.S. Department ofState to observe the elections in El Salvador on March 28. The delegation will be headed by Sen. Nancy L. Kassenbaum, Republican of Kansas, and includes Fr. Hesburgh, Congressman Bob Livingston of Louisiana; Everett E. Briggs, deputy assistant secretary for Inter-American affairs; Clark Kerr, presidents emeritus of the University of California at Berkeley, and Richard M. Scammon and Howard Penniman, well-known election experts. Scammon and Penniman are in El Salvador this week observing election preparations, and the entire delegation is scheduled in the country during the final week of the campaign to witness the polling and vote counting process. --The Observer. 
GUNMEN WOUNDED THREE PEOPLE at a polling station in Guatemala City yesterday and three guerrillas were killed in a shoot-out , police said, but voters appeared to be ignoring a leftist call to boycott the national elections. Police said the gunmen opened fire at the pollin~ place oin the capital's southern edges and fled in a speed10g car, shortly before voting for a new president and other officials opened. Later, authorities said three terrorists, one with a sack full of bombs, were killed in a shoot-out with police. At least 36 other people died in political violence on election eve. Election day security was heavy throughout the capital. Soldiers guarded polling places with machine guns mounted on jeeps and spot car checks were made on the highways outside the city. Travelers from two northwestern provinces where leftist guerrilla activity has been heavy reported a better-than­average turnout. In the capital, marimba bands played for the long lives of voters. The government promised ''free, cleaQ and pure" elections but leftists urged Guatemalans to boycott them, calling them a "farce." No liberal candidates are running for president. --AP. 

POliSH ARCHBISHOP]ozef Glemp appealed to Poles and the Communist government yesterday to com­promise despite what he called the "many harms and vio­lations of human dignity" in life under martial law. Glemp's remarks were considered conciliatory toward the government, which two days earlier announced two priests had been jailed, one for slandering Polish leaders and the other in connection with a police killing. ~·we need to be reasonable and realistic,'' the Roman Catholic primate said in a sermon at St. Michael's Church in Warsaw. "We can't say now or never or everything or nothing. We also should look into the future. Oyr future perspectives are great." Sf,eaking to several hundred people, Glemp said that near y three months of mania! law have brought "EENORMOUS DISRUPTIONS" AND "many harms .and violations of human dignity." More than 4,000 people have been detained since Premier Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski decreed martial taw Dec. 13 after 16 months of strikes and political challenges to Communist rule by the now-suspended Solidarity union. Glemp, who was con­demned the crackdown several times, IS considered the spiritual leader of Poland, where more than 90 _percent of the nation's 36 million people are devout Catholics. --AP.

The percentage of black students fell from 4 to 3 in the undergraduate studeiu body, while Hispanic students increased from 3 to 4 percent. Hispanic students' percentage in the graduate school rose from 2 to 3/ercent, while the percentage of black students remaine at 1 percent. American Indians and Asian Americans made up the rest of the minority students on both levels. There was a 24 percent increase in ~ccepted minority students, reflecting intensified recruit­Ing by the undergraduate admissions office, but rising costs, cutbacks in federal funds and limited University financial aid resources caused low confirmation and high cancellation rates. --The Observer.

In Memory of Bluto 
Every now and then, an event occurs which· makes you realize how unpredictable and fleeting life is. This weekend such an event occurred; John Belushi, a comedian of our generation, died at age 33. 
The death of John Belushi is different than the recent deaths of celebrities such as Natalie Wood, William Holden or John Lennon. Though many of us enjoyed the works of these entertainers, they were not of our generation. We each have our favorite Lennon tune, but ] ohn Lennon started back in the sixties; he was there before us. Belushi came on the scene with us. 
John Belushi did not gain national recogni­tion until he appeared on the first Saturday Night Live show in 1975. The show offered satire that commented on subjects that Mom, Dad and big brother could not identify with. They did not know that Candy Slate was a shot 
at Patti Smith, or let alone who Patti Smith was. 
Some people may think that I am stretch­ing it a bit too far to say that the death ofa comic who dressed up as a killer bee and a Samurai warrior had an effect on our life. 
Yet, he was there on the tube when you didn't get a date for Saturday night and at the movie theater as Bluto when you did. And more importantly, he was the first enter­tainer whose career we've been able to live with from start to finish. 
In this respect, his death hits home; a man who should have had the best years of his career ahead of him --will be buried. 
Though he only performed to a national audience for the last seven years, the charac­ters Belushi portrayed made a statement on the way most people would secretly like to live; i.e., everyone has a little Bluto in them. 
This underlying feeling added the special meaning to Bluto's lines in the film "Animal House": "Seven years of college down the drain.'' Sometimes every college student wishes that he could just stay in college ·and hide from the real world. (Isn't that why we're here at Notre Dame?) And who is the character in the film that gets the rest of the Delta House brothers ready to turn the worst time of their lives into the best? Bluto ("when the ~oing gets tough the tough get going."). Most Importantly, which character in the film ends 
up  the  best in  the  long  run?  Senator John  
Blutarski  with  an  attractive  wife  and  a  
prestigious title.  

The main aspect of this desire to be like Bluto is the desire to live life for the moment, a total disregard for the future. 
In actuality, the character torments the

student who resembles the ''Niedermeyer'' type who is so concerned with the GPA and the Orgo lab due tomorrow that he does not know the names of the guys in his section and refuses to go out with the gang every now and then. Like Niedermeyer, they will probably end up being killed by their own troops in Vietnam or El Salvador. 
His humor took us away from the impending dangers of the nuclear arms race, Three Mile Island and unemployment, and enabled us to 
enjoy the moment, for­getting the future, be­cause it might not be there. 
This is not to say that everyone should totally disregard all responsi­bilities; but every once in a while it is the best thing in the world to do what you want to and say, "The hell with everybody else." Life is not fair, as Belushi death showed. It does not promise that you will get what you de­

J always have the chance to do what you want, so you better take the chance while you can. 

Beneath this disregard for everything, a message of''be yourself'' comes through. Bluto did what he wanted 
What we are concerned with is the develop­ment of the individual without interfering with other peo_ples' rights and well-being. 
Bluto d1d not want to harm the members of the other fraternities in "Animal House;" he just wanted them to leave his Delta House alone. 
In actuality he wanted them to respect his life. . 
It is with this respect for life that this column is dedicated to the memory of]ohn Belushi and all the enjoyable moments his talents have added to my life and others.

The ND/SMC theater production of Henrik Ibsen's The Wild Duck should not have been missed. This theater classic is Ibsen's finest play, and director Frederic Syberg deserves our admiration and gratitude for giving this rather difficult play a thoroughly ade­quate and quite enjoyable production. 
Walter Davis 
The play is about illusions: how they are fostered and kept up, how they cut across one another, how necessary they are to our frail human life, and how, finally, they can destroy. For a campus like ours rife wtth ill~sions, the play has a special pmgnancy. 
The young and idealistic Gregers W erie 0ohn Davenport) vows to strip the illusions from his friend's eyes, Hjalmar Ekdal (Richard Lechowich). He proceeds to do this by moving in with him and his wife, Gina (Heather Fraser). When Gregers reveals the truth to Hjalmar about Gina, he produces only depres­sion and .despair, instead of enlightenment and strength, and almost breaks the family apart. Undaunted, he persuades Hjalmar' s daughter, Hedvig (Eileen Durkin) to bring her father round by an act of noble self-sacrifice, killing the wild duck that is so precious to her. Perhaps grasping the 
symbolism only too well, 
Hedvig shoots herself, leaving 
all, even Gregers, in despair. 
For Gregers, the Ekdals live in a world of illusions; yet he, in his belief in the nobility of ideas, is the greatest illusionist of them all. This is an Ibsen play that satirizes idealistic lbsenism, a symbolic ,Play that criticizes symbol-making. Its play of perspectives is dazzling (almost Chekhovian), mixing as it does comedy and pathos, zany horseplay and terror. 
Therein lies its difficulty in performance. Hjalmar, for mstance, must convincingly combine self-pity and generosity, foolishness and pathos. On opening night, Lechowich seemed to be able to 


smer 


SE 
avoid extremes, but he did so at the expense of a fully con­vincing portrayal. Perhaps in order not to appear ridiculous, he let some comic moments slip by. He did not seem to get into hts part until the comic ranting and raving of Act III, after which things went smoothly. Davenport played Gregers as coldly Satanic (almost like Iago) rather than as a bright-eyed idealist; as a result, his dis­illusionment received no audience sympathy (the audience almost hissed at times). Instead of wild-eyed enthusiasm, guilt and deflation, he displayed detadu~ent and slight distress. Fraser was · stolidly peasant-like as Gina, and a bit stiff. Durkin gave a brilliant performance as Hedvig. She resisted the temp­tation to play the doomed little girl as languid and pathetic. She made her into an angular impetuous adolescent, teeming with life. Raul Aportela was absolutely brilliant as the crazy but dignified old Ekdal, usually drunk and muttering to himself as he wandered about the stage. Joseph Dolan as Dr. Reiling and Paul Clay as the drunken theology student, Molvik, gave creditable sup­porting performance, as did]oe Musumeci as Haakon W erie and Therese Brown as Mrs. Soerby. 
The sets by Thomas Leff were quite well done, especially the Ekdal home, half literal studi, half symbolic sea­bottom. The pacing was lively, but the fake beards plastered here and there on the faces of the male actors were distract­ing. There were flaws, but the acting was thoroughly competent and interesting. This is a difficult play to stage, and it is notable that 1t drew a large and enthusiastic audience, even 
in the midst of the Sophomore 
Literary Festival. To perform it at all was an act of courage; to do it so entertainingly was a real accomplishment. 

Monday, March 8, 1982 -page 4 
Is honesty really thefair policy? I'm constantly pleased with the fact that I can sit here and complain about something without ever having to make a hard decision about what ought to be done about it. Congress is trying to decide whether to pass a law making it mandatory for used car dealers to reveal any known defects in the cars they sell. Congressmen are getting a lot of help in making up their minds from Political Action Committees (PACS) supported by the dealers, which have contributed to the politicians' campaign funds.  
findy Rooney  
On the surface, it all seems obvious. Of course an honest used car dealer should tell a customer that the engine is shot, the brakes are about gone or the body is almost rusted out under the bright, shiny new paint job. The question, though, is this: Is anyone else selling anything to us being held to that same standard? Do the companies that sell us brand new merchandise have to be honest with us about what's wrong with their product? They don't, of course. We all know that when lt comes to an advertisement, almost anything goes. There's a common understanding among us that we take ads with a grain of salt.  

Don 't worry ... It was owned a ~whom I bought only an Sundays I' 
There's no doubt about it, asking used car dealers to be absolutely honest may be asking too much. Assume you're an honest person. How would you behave under similar circumstances? If you were selling a house in the fall when it hadn't rained in weeks, would you go to a lot of trouble to tell a prospective buyer that the cellar often has water six inches deep during the sprin~ when it rains a lot? Or wouldn't you bother to mention 1t? Would you buy a used car from a person like yourself? 
We'd all like to live in a world where no law had to be passed to enforce honesty, decency and ethical standards, but we don't live in that world. The Romans had that Latin phrase we've borrowed, "caveat emptor." It means "Let the buyer beware," and most of us recognize with some sadness that we have to live by that rule. It's why we pinch the fruit. 
In no case are we more suspicious than in the purchase of a second-hand car, but at the same time there's nothing we buy that we're so incapable of judging accurately. You can look at a car in a lot for an hour and you can drive it around the block, but you're still not going to know that it was in a bad accident four months ago and the frame is weakened and bent. You're not going to know the piston rings are gone and the car uses a quart of oil with five gallons of gas. You can see for yourself that the tires are OK, but you can't determine that the transmission is shot without taking the car apart. 
In spite of the money being spent by the car dealers trying to get Congress to vote against the bill, I'm against it anyway. Sometimes the car dealers themselves don't know what's wrong with a car and it would cost them more to find out than the car is worth. The law would make the dealer fill out a checklist of 52 possible defects the car might have. 
I'm in favor of that only if everyone else selling us anything has to do the same thing.

Worn.en suffer fifth straight loss 
By MARK HANNUKSELA 
Sports Writer 
Bring down the curtain boys, the folding act is complete. 
Notre Dame's women's basketball team completed its second-half slide Saturday by droppin~ its flfty straight, 68-59 to Mtchtgan State. 
The win was the fourth in a row for the Spartans, and it improved their season record to 15-11. 
The Irish flnish at 16-9, considerably better than the 10-18 mark of a year ago. 
''It was a hard way to end the season,'' Irish Coach Mary DiStanislao said afterwards. "Perhaps our kids can't see the light at the end of the tunnel, yet. If you can, then you just dig harder. But they'll learn.' 
If and when they do in fact learn, they'll have this season's flnal three games to help them. 
Saturday's was the third straisht gam that Notre Dame let sltp through its grasp. After trailing by as much as 13 points on two ocasions in the ftrst half, the Irish rallied, and eventually came withing a point of the Spartans, 56-55, with just over five minutes left. 
The Spartans weathered the storm, however, and went on to score 12 of the game's last 16 P<?ints to come away with the Wlfi. 
''The difference in the game was our inability to stop their runnin~ game," DiStanislao said. 'The biggest atrocity in the game was our poor shot selection on offense. That led to long, uncontested rebounds, and they were able to use them to get the transition game going.'' 
That transition game hurt the Irish more in the last flve inutes than it did at any other time in the game-which was exactly the case in earlier Irish losses to Nebraska and DePaul. Twice in the last minute of the game, the Spartans got free on breaks, and scored three points in the process. 
Michigan State led 65-59 when Deb Traxinger converted a Brenda Jezowski steal into a uncontested layup. Jezowski herself then got loose on a break, and coverted one of two free throws after being fouled by Laura Dougherty. 
Those points hurt, but turnovers and poor shooting hurt worse. 
Notre Dame had one of its poorer performances from the floor, connecting on only 37 percent of its shots. The Irish were a dismal 9-of-27 in the ftrst half, as the Spartans built a 36-27 halftime lead. 
Michigan State's 4o percent average from the floor was right n it's seasonal average. 
Despite its run and gun style Michigan State committed only 11 turnovers in the contest, while the Irish had 23. 
the Spartans built up a big ftrst-half edge in rebounding, but flnished just flve ahead of the Irish (40-35). 
Freshman Mary Beth Schueth lead Notre Dame in scoring, pumping in a career-high 29 points of 11-of-18 shooting from the fleld, and 7-of-9 from the free throw line, a spot Schueth has had a great deal of trouble with this season. 
Schueth also led the Irish with 11 rebunds while playing the entire 40 minutes, promting DiStanislao to rhetorically ask afterwards ''What more can you ask of a kid? 
''mary Beth just played a great game," she added, "and she's only going to get better." 

Carrie Bates and Shari Matvey each added 11 points for the Irish, but didn't do it together. Matvey scored all of her points in the flrst half, while Bates got all of her's in the second. 
Jezowski led the Spartans with 21 points, 10 over her season average. Karen Wells came off the bench to add 13, almost triple her season average. 
Wells hit four of her flrst five shots after entering the game midway through the flrst half. 
Lil Preston, MSU's leading scorer throughout the season, was held to just 10 points, and 2-of-13 shooting from the floor. She did have nine rebounds to lead the Spartans. 
Irish captain Missy Conboy started in her fnal appearance in an Irish uniform. conboy grabbed a rebound and handed out four assists in her 14-minute stint. 
"Missy plyed ~reat," aid DiStanislao. "I hipe the kids lean something from watching how hard Missy works. These last two years, she realized what her effort mean to the team ,and she didn't give up." 
"fter doing something for four years, it's tough to realize that you're doing it for the last time," Conboy said. "Never

Today in History 
Today's highlight in history: 
In 1965, the United States landed 3,500 Marines in Vietnam. On this date: In 1917, riots and strikes broke out in St. 
Petersburg, marking the beginning of the Russian Revolution. 
In 1973, Northern Ireland violence spread to London, where automobile bombs exploded outside the Old Bailey, killing one person and injuring many others. 
In 1979, President Jimmy Carter began the Middle East peace mission that led to the signing of the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. 
Ten years: President Nixon signed an executive order limiting secrecy surrounding federal documents and restricting the power of officials to classify them. 
Five years ago: Spokesmen for President Caner announced he would visit London in May for an economic conference with leaders from six other industrialized nations. 
One year ago: About 3,000 people partici­pated in a Solidarity rally at Warsaw Univer­sity. --AP.
