DeMars: Effort in Ethiopia needs further study 
By KRISTIN MCGOWAN 
News Writer 
The efforts of humanitarian organizations in the recent Ethiopian war, or in any war, are best studied from the per­spective of market analysis, said William DeMars., in a lec­ture yesterday at the Hesburgh Center. 
Most accounts of humanitar­ian action are descriptive stud­ies by scholars and journalists which tend to oversimplify conditions. DeMars said. Such accounts frequently ignore the relatronship between humani­tarian aid and politics, assum­ing that "humanitarian aid is above politics," he said. 
They also often mistakenly conclude that aid is offered to promote the aims of one or more of the warring factions, according to DeMars. They be­lieve that "it's all politics and

ND Student Government proposes new debit card 
By CARRIE KINSELLA 
News Writer 
A student identification card that would double as a debit card is one of the projecfs being researched by student government this year. 
The proposed system would use student I.D.s as declining balance cards. Students would pay for the card at the begin­ning of the year and charges would be deducted from it in­stead of having to carry cash, according to Student Body President Greg Butrus. 
The identification card is presently used for meals at the dining halls, check-out at the library, Bookstore charge ac­counts, identification for ath­letic events, and check-cashing and checking account autho­rization. 
In addition to its current functions, the card would also be used for laundry facilities, the Huddle, the Oak Room, Alumni-Senior Club, copy rna­chines, entrance to computer clusters, and access to dorms. 
Implementing the card would involve purchasing and setting up the new system, then adapting all existing equipment to accommodate the card, 
Butrus said. 
A student survey given by Special Projects Commissioner Shannon Windsor earlier this year indicated that 90 percent of the students are in favor of such a system, primarily for its convenience. 
The Huddle led the list of stu­dent priorities for card use, followed by laundry machines, vending machines, copy ma­chines, the Bookstore, and the Copy Shop. 

Sixty-four percent of the stu­dents surveyed preferred the 
debit card system to carrying cash. Similarly, the same per­centage of students felt they would eat more often at the Huddle if such a card were available. 
Thirty departments were represented in the working group appointed to research 
the project. They visited schools such as Western Michi­gan University, where a card system has been implemented, and found that students were "crazy about them...they're a huge convenience." 
The newly-elected team of Frank Flynn and Nikki Well­mann will also be involved in working on the card system. 
In addition to being easier to handle than cash and Detexes, the card could be reproduced in twenty-four hours, instead of the typical three weeks. Stu­dent Body President Greg Butrus said, "The operational costs would be smaller and the services much greater" with the proposed card. 
The working group has fin­ished an extensive proposal and submitted it the the Uni­versity officers. It is included on the agenda for the next meeting and will be addressed then.

Love letters can really touch the heart 
You render me powerless under your 
zre. When you gaze into my eyes, I am smitten by the sparks that ignite between us. 
Well, maybe that's a little strong for a first love letter, but there 
something to be said for it. A societal tragedy is

occurring. People aren't -------­
writing letters anymore, and cheesy Shoebox 
cards with trite rhymes are replacing the lyrical 
epistles of yesterday. What a pity, for a heartfelt, 
succulent message lingers in the heart and mind 
for much longer than a stranger's prose. 
Consider what can be done with a l11tter. 
Valentine's Day is the perfect opportunity to 
tell your friends and parents that they are loved 
and appreciated. Sweethearts can remind each 
other of what made them fall in love with each 
other. A valentine can make a lonely person's 
day, as it can anyone's. No one likes an empty 
mailbox. 

The power of the written word bridged CeCe and Hillary for decades in "Beaches." Letters between two worldly lovers fueled a romantic triangle in "Dangerous Liasons." Many insights into the history of the world-and into the young lives of our parents-are revealed through eloquent, passionate, and informational letters. Precious few people today put the effort into writing down their thoughts. 
Kathy toiled for hours to find the precise message she wanted to send to her sweetheart for Valentine's Day. When she had written the final copy in her fancy handwriting, with a fountain pen, on perfume-scented stationery, she danced around my room and read it to me. She sang it to my neighbor. She breathed it to my roommate when Angie got home. I was reciting it along with her by the end of the night. ller tongue relished every syllable, and she imagined Frankie reading those words on February 14th. 
Every Valentine's Day throughout junior and high school, I received roses and a balloon from a secret admirer. One year, Mr. Secret revealed himself with a letter that confessed he'd fostered a smoldering crush for five years. The admirer turned out to be a close friend who bore a striking resemblance to Donny Osmond. Although his romantic love was unrequited, I still have that letter. Whenever I find it, the feelings of flattery, embarrassment and excitement come back all over again. 
Over Christmas Break I discovered a Valentine in my father's glovebox that I'd written when I was about four years old. The red construction paper card has a pink heart on the front with "Happy Valentine's Day" written in careful script. The inside bears a simple "I Love You Daddy." My father has been keeping that card in his car ever since he found it a few years ago. He says it reminds him of his "little girl" while I'm away at college. 
Flowers, teddy bears, chocolate, jewelry and other tokens of love are nice symbols o love-but letters are more than a token. No llallmark card, song, or famous sonnet can say what only you can. If you want to tell someone you're in love, or just that you treasure a friendship, write a letter this weekend. Please don't join the "love stinks" club and resist giving someone an emotional squeeze. Your words will be kept and lingered over forever. 
Yourself is the greatest gift you can give.

Jackson reveals himself to Oprah
 LOS ANGELES -Michael Jackson allowed the public spotlight to briefly enter his private life, saying in a televised interview that he finds the comfort in children and animals that he missed in a friendless, workaholic childhood. His conversation with Oprah Winfrey on Wednesday was his first solo interview in nearly a decade, another sign that the 34­year-old pop star is emerging from his reclusiveness. He said he hoped that by confronting rumors about his personal life, his fans could focus on his art. Perhaps most startling was his revelation that he has an inherited disorder that causes skin pigmentation to fade. The revelation came after Winfrey asked him about a rumor that he bleaches his skin. Jackson admitted having a crush on singer Diana Ross and that he was dating actress Brooke Shields. But he dismissed a question about whether he was a virgin.

Navy ROTC takes part in military competition 
By ANALISE TAYLOR News Writer 
Ten members of Notre Dame's navy ROTC marine corps sacrificed Feb. 6 to participate in a military excellence competition at Penn State Uni­versity. 
All participating ND members are part of Team Irish, a club formed by navy midshipmen. Junior Karl Etzel said that this was the first competition as a team. 
The team completed a four by four hundred meter relay race, a five mile endurance course, a ten kilometer run. and the ma­rine corps PFT (Physical Fitness Test}. According to Etzel, the test is especially geared to-

It was Notre Dame's first year to participate. 
Senior Andres Rodriguez and junior Chris Martino placed fifth and sixth in the ten kilo­meter race, respectively. 
Team Irish worked out three to four mornings a week and ran three to four miles each morning to train for these events, Etzel said. 
Other teams participating in­cluded Georgetown, Villanova, Carnegie-Mellon, and Penn State. Notre Dame had the smallest group. "We partici­pated for the competition and to represent our navy unit here at Notre Dame," said Etzel. 
The contest was held for the second consecutive year at Penn State. 

Violations of rights common in Brazil 
By LISA WOLTER News Writer 
Human rights violations are a common occurrence in Brazil due to a fear of individual rights and the "weakness of a justice system that serves the elites," said Teresa Caldeira of Universidade Estadual de Campinas in a lecture Thurs­day. 
Caldeira claimed that the state and media promote a vio­lent police force and brutal exe­cutions as opposed to the church and intellectuals who recognize fundamental human rights. 
The present situation in Brazil includes legitimate politi­cal rights, secure social rights, yet has always had "precarious" individual and civil rights due to an ineffective judiciary system, 
promote racial understanding" was an essential or very impor­tant goal, compared with 42 percent nationally. Both figures are substantially higher than the previous year -up 10 per­cent at Notre Dame and nine percent nationally. 
On the question of racial bias, 91 percent of the University's freshmen said discrimination remains a significant problem in the United States, compared with 85 percent nationally. Both figures are up compared to a year ago -by two percent at Notre Dame and five percent nationally. 
The results are based on re­sponses by 213,600 students at 404 colleges and universities, including more than 1,500 of Notre Dame's 1.879 freshmen. This is the 27th year of the ACE survey, which is conducted in conjunction with the Higher said Caldeira. She said that this disrespect for the elementary human rights is magnified by the Brazilian attitude towards evil and authority. 

There is a prevalent belief among Brazilians that evil is a powerful and contagious force that must be suppressed by au­thority figures in order for so­ciety to function correctly, said Caldeira. 
Brazilians believe this author­ity is found in the family, the church, the police and the jus­tice system and that it is when these institutions fail that criminal behavior emerges, Caldeira said. 
This emphasis on authorita­tive control has lead Brazilians to commit private acts of vengeance when these legal

Other results of the survey indicate that 43 percent of Notre Dame freshmen said they engaged in political discussions, compared with 25 percent nationally and 40 percent of the University's previous freshmen class. 
In addition, the University's freshmen showed greater hands-on interest in the politi­cal process than students at other colleges and universities. Eleven percent said they worked on a campaign in 1992, compared with seven percent nationally. 
Politically Notre Dame stu­dents continued a decade-long trend of leaning farther right than their peers. Thirty-four percent described themselves as conservatives, compared

efforts fail. This creates a "cycle of private revenge in which vio­lence is answered with more violence," she said. 
In Brazil, "To refer to the human rights activist is to pro­voke an image of a bad person," said Caldeira, because human rights are often viewed as "privileges for bandits." 
Although the judiciary system may be corrupt, many Brazil­ians prefer immediate execu­tion for criminals rather than a respect for their fundamental human rights and will advocate this judicial power, she said. 
Caldeira's lecture, "Crime and Individual Rights: Reframing the Question of Violence in Latin America," was sponsored by the Kellogg Institute for International Studies. 
with 20 percent overall, and 21 percent say they are liberal, compared with 26 percent na­tionally. 
Other observations from the survey include: 
Notre 
Dame's strong aca­demic reputation was the main reason 95 percent of the stu­dents decided to attend. That's a two percent increase over last year. Eighty-seven percent said Notre Dame was their first choice for college, up three percent. 

Eighty-eight 
percent of Notre Dame's freshmen engaged in some kind of community service while in high school. 

Materialism 
had decreased in the freshmen class at Notre Dame: 60 percent said they decided to attend college to make more money, compared to 73 percent nationally. Both figures are down two points. 

The 
most popular career fields for the University's first­year students are (in order) health care, engineering, busi­ness and law. 

About 
38 percent favor in­creasing taxes to reduce the national deficit, up six points from last year. 

Some 
90 percent believe the federal government should do more about environmental problems, but only 36 percent plan to become personally in­volved. 

Only 
1.4 percent of the Notre Dame freshmen smoke, compared with 10.8 percent nationally. 

Fourteen 
percent favor the legalization of marijuana, com­pared with 23 percent overall. 

Raising 
a family is a priority with 81 percent of Notre Dame students, 11 points higher than the national figure.

there is no such thing as a hu­manitarian action pursuing universal norms," he said. 
Market analysis, on the other hand, is a more accurate way of dealing with the complexities of the situation, he said. 
This alternative approach, according to DeMars, recog­nizes the fact that humanitarian organizations "are enmeshed in politics and have to negotiate with political forces in the area" in order to be effective. 
"Every humanitarian organi­zation which tries to take any kind of action in a war has to deal with at least one of the warring parties and get their permission," he said. This also applies to Somalia, Iraq, and the former Yugoslavia, he said. 
DeMars' approach also "takes into account the organization's mission," which may be gen­uinely altruistic, instead of au­tomatically associating it with ulterior political motives, he said. 
"The two basic concerns of every humanitarian issue are assistance and protection," he said. 
Assistance is "material aid, like food, which has to be physically transferred to the population," he said. Protec­tion, he said, is "any action which steadies the position of victims in relation to particular threats." 
Humanitarian organizations "can only offer protection through managing informa­tion," said DeMars. The dis­semination, discovery, and def­inition of information is critical, he said. 
DeMars focused specifically on the Ethiopian conflict in his application .of market analysis to humanitarian action. 
The Ethiopian war involves three groups, he said: the Ethiopian government, the Eritrea People's Liberation Front (EPLF), and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). DeMars' discussion of humanitarian action focused on the early 1980s. At this time, each of the factions controlled its own forces and territory, so "humanitarian organizations knew who they had to negotiate with," he said. 

There was "symmetry in the distribution of hunger, in that each of the three adversaries sought and received humani­tarian assistance," he said. 
However, there was "asymmetry in the distribution of abuses," in that "the vast majority were committed by the government, while very few were committed by the rebels," he said. 
DeMars discussed two specific organizations, War on Want (WOW) and Oxfam, which were involved with humanitarian action during the war. Both were British groups involved in cross-border operations aimed at assisting the Eritrean Relief Association (ERA). he said. 
War on Want (WOW) con­tributed relief and assistance "only to the rebels, not to the government," according to DeMars. It ""publicly debated about human rights," criticizing the government for its abuses and supporting the EPLF, he said. . 
Oxfam, on the other hand, of­fered "assistance programs on both sides," but didn't publicly admit its involvement with the cross-border operations be­cause it was afraid of being ousted by the government, he said. 
DeMars is a visiting fellow and a doctoral candidate in government, in a lecture yes­terday at the llesburgh Center. 
DeMars' lecture was spon­sored by the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies.

"Students need to act respon­sibly and realize that they had a part in bringing it about and realize that they are the ones that need to act to keep the policy in effect," said Murray. 
Resident Adviser Carrie Piercy said that the policy will be a success if students utilize this new independence in a re­sponsible manner. 
"We all have to watch out for our own safety and security with the change," Piercy said. "If we all work together I think it will work great." 
Student reaction to the policy change was positive, with most students indicating that they believe that it is a beneficial move for the administration to let students remain in ultimate control of their actions. 
"It's about time the adminis­tration realizes that we can handle it," said Cyndi Herman, a Holy Cross sophomore. "I feel like my parents are in the lobby."

"It makes me happier that they finally think we are re­sponsible enough. We're 20 years old, its time for us to start making choices on our own," she said. 
Augusta Hall, which is re­stricted to juniors and seniors, and McCandless Hall currently do not require males to leave identification, but according to freshman McCandless resident Ann Lawrence, the change is still a change in the right direc­tion. 
Lawrence, who is considering a move to Le Mans Hall next year, is welcoming the change that will allow her the same freedom she has this year in all residence halls, but as a freshman she wants to ensure that this is a policy that will re­main with her all four years. 
"I would urge students to use it (the new policy) wisely since it is only on a trial basis," she said. 
Currently RHA is working on a letter to inform all students of the change. They are also working with Residence Life in implementing the policy. 

Hall Directors of all residence halls will meet with each sec­tion or floor in the coming week and with the Hall Night Assistants to inform everyone of the new procedure, according to Fordham. 
Since its institution on cam­pus last year, RHA has been working to amend the parietals policy and other projects to im­prove campus residence life. Last December an RIIA pro­posal to lengthen parietal hours on campus was approved by the College's Senior Officers.

Putz: Mary appears as reminder of God's power 
By BRIAN SEILER News Writer 
The Virgin Mary appeared to Saint Bernadette to encourage separation of Church and State and to warn the increasingly technological world that God is still in charge, said Louis Putz in a lecture entitled, "The Mes­sage of Our Lady of Lourdes" Thursday. 
Mary appeared at Lourdes, France, in 1858 to proclaim that God is still active in the world, Putz said. 

Putz said that the separation of church and state, Mary's main message, has been almost completely fulfilled with the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe. The problem of a "Godless scientific world," which denies the need for God, still remains a problem, Putz said. 
The purpose of the 18 offi­cially recognized visits of Mary to Lourdes in the world today is to provide a common place for people of all nations to convene 
Corner of Jefferson &Cedar, Mishawaka Elkhart 674-9926 Toll free (BOO) 837-1981 
for prayer, healing, song and celebration of God's healing power, according to Putz. "We have had a 'United Nations' at Lourdes since 1858," he said. 
Lourdes is renowned for its healing powers, Putz said. Although only a handful of the supposed healings have been scientifically appraised as "miracles," millions of people continue to visit Lourdes every year. "Most of the people who go to Lourdes come back ac­cepting their sickness. This is the real miracle," said Putz. 

Still, with all the diseased people bathing in water, which is changed only once a day, Putz said that no major problem has arisen with the transmission of disease. He said that this is "a total denial of what the scientific world would call unhealthy." 
Notre Dame students should strive to promote peace and justice throughout the world, since Notre Dame's grotto is modeled after the one at Lour­des, said Putz.

Sign Shop open for any occasion 
By JASON WILLIAMS 
Business Writer 
Although billboards and neon beer signs are not available from Student Activities' Sign Shop, personalized banners and buttons can be designed by students for any purpose or oc­casion, according to Mary Edgington, assistant director of student activities. 
The Sign Shop uses 'butcher block' paper, a banner-type paper which bears wear and tear better than ordinary paper, to make signs of all shapes and sizes. said Edgington. "'Butcher block' is a thicker, more durable type of paper," she said. "It definitely lasts longer than regular paper and we've got all kinds of colors." 
Sign Shop artists use twelve different colors of "Texas Markers," drip-free markers with two-inch tips which can make both narrow and wide lettering. Edgington said that if students have an image which goes beyond the artists concep­tion, they can grab the pen themselves and let their imagi­nations run wild. 

"Actually we only charge 25 cents per foot of paper if the student wants to do the design­ing," she said. "We charge 50 cents per foot if they have an artist do the design." Personal­ized buttons are sold for 50 cents a piece, but Edgington said they would consider reduc­ing the price if someone put in a bulk order. 
The two-inch buttons are ini­tially designed on special paper in the Copy Shop in LaFortune. Copies of the image are then made while the finishing touches are done in Stepan Center. 
The Sign Shop opened for business in early November, and Edgington says business has been slow so far. However, she hopes that business will be on the upswing as students re­alize that signs and buttons are an inexpensive, available medium. 
"Not many, students have heard about us," Edgington said. "Hopefully students will realize what a good deal it is when they see the quality of our products." 
The Sign Shop is a student­run business backed by the of­fice of Student Activities. Their office hours at Stepan Center are from 6 pm to 11 pm Mon­day through Friday, 9 am to 11 pm on Saturday and noon to 11 pm on Sunday. Students can also place orders in the Student Activities office located in LaFortune. 
Clinton asks for Uruguay round extension 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The Clinton administration today announced that it will ask Congress for the authority to extend the deadline for nego­tiating a sweeping world trade agreement. 
The decision was announced by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor following a two­hour meeting with the top trade negotiator of the 12-nation European Community, Leon Brittan. 
The action was the first word from the new administration on how it planned to deal with what had been the Bush ad­ministration's major trade ini­tiative, an effort to rewrite the rules of world trade under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
These talks, known as the Uruguay round for the nation where they began in 1986, have been stalled for more than two years. 
Hopes were raised last year that the discussions could be concluded before President Bush left office, after Europe and the United States resolved 

a longstanding dispute regard­
ing farm subsidies. 

However, the farm agreement 
began to unravel because of 
strong opposition from France 
and the last minute effort to 
conclude the Uruguay round 
went nowhere. 

The new administration had faced a deadline of March 2 for completing the Uruguay talks · and notifying Congress of that 
fact. 

But with Kantor's an­nouncement today, the admin­istration signaled that it was not interested in rushing through a package that basically had been completed by the Bush administration but instead wanted more time to put its own stamp on any final agreement. 
U.S. negotiating authority for the Uruguay round had already been given one two-year exten­sion. Kantor, however, refused to say what length of extension the administration would seek. He said that decision would not be made before consulting Congress. 
For his part, Brittan said the European Community wel­comed the administration's decision to go forward with the GATT talks but he said he hoped the president would de­cide on a negotiating extension that would be far shorter than two years. 
Otherwise, Brittan said, the talks would run the risk of los­ing momentum and becoming hopelessly stalled. 
The discussions between Brittan and Kantor were being held at a time of heightened trade tensions between the United State~? and the European Community. 
Just since taking office, the new administration has taken actions to boost sharply the tax on shipments of steel from Eu­rope and other countries to the United states and has threat­ened to bar European compa­nies fro~ bidding on federal contracts. 
Both Kantor and Brittan said they had discussed these trade disputes during their talk but gave no indication of any progress in narrowing the dif­ferences. 

GM, Ford, and Chrysler suffer $30 billion shortfall for 1992 
DETROIT (AP) -General Mo­tors Corp. made business his­tory Thursday, reporting a record $23.5 billion loss for 1992. But beneath the stagger­ing number were some en­couraging signs of financial turnaround. 
One-time accounting changes for current and future retiree health care made up $22.2 bil­lion of the loss, and other one­time hits drained another $1.53 billion during the year. 
For 1991, GM lost $4.45 bil­lion, or $7.97 a share, an American corporate record at the time. 
GM's numbing loss plus a $7.4 billion loss at Ford Motor Co. and a $723 million profit at Chrysler Corp. gave the Big Three automakers a combined shortfall of $30.2 billion, most of it in accounting changes. Chrysler did not take its retiree health care charges in 1992. 
GM's 1992 worldwide sales totaled $132.4 billion, up 7.6 percent from $123 billion the year before. The automaker

The massive shortfall, a record for corporate America, amounted to $38.28 a share. The accounting charge did not affect GM cash flow, which im­proved dramatically in 1992 because of the proceeds from selling new stock. But it de­pleted the company's net worth to $6.22 billion, from $27.32 billion. 

"What does it mean? I think primarily from a respect of how we run the business, with re­spect to the dividend, {and) the financial solidity of the com­pany, it doesn't mean anything," Chief Financial Officer Richard Wagoner told reporters at GM headquarters.

The company's performance in North America "was heavily influenced by continued low in­dustry sales, excess capacity and competitive pressures, which resulted in a persistent high level of sales incentives," GM Chief Executive Jack Smith said in a statement. 
GM's aggressive downsizing resulted in 28,000 salaried and hourly jobs being shed during the year. Plans to close at least 21 p}ants by mid-decade also were firmed, and several au­tomotive supply businesses were put up for sale. 
Analysts were told GM was losing about $1 billion in North America through the first three quarters, but that shortfall rose to $1.5 billion in the final quar­ter because the company paid for early retirement programs for salaried workers and set aside an undisclosed amount for car and truck warranty re­pairs. 
"We basically took some charges in the fourth quarter to go into '93 in an appropriate basis and go out of '92 with what we thought was a conser­vative footing," Wagoner said. 
GM can still meet its goal of breaking even in North America this year before interest ex­penses, .taxes and retiree health care charges are included, he said. ·

Couples enjoy weddings at Sacred Heart despite time constraints 
By JAHNELLE HARRIGAN Accent Editor 
A wedding is a pretty big deal. 
But for some. a wedding at the Basilica of the Sacred Iteart is an even bigger deal. Couples with ties to Notre Dame especially grab the chance to get married at the University­although it does require a little extra effort. 
In fact, Paul Massaro's family even chartered a bus to trans­port ·his family for the five hour drive from his hometown New­castle, Penn. to South Bend for his big day. 
"The wedding was almost an attraction because a lot of my family hadn't been to Notre Dame and they wanted to see it," explained Paul, a 1990 NO graduate. 
Paul and Brigid Welch '91, were married at Sacred Heart on Nov. 23. 1991, and say that choosing a location for their wedding was never a question for them. "We knew we wanted to get married at Sacred Heart-thtlre was no doubt about it," Paul said. 
Brigid, originally from Con­necticut. agreed. "We met at Notre Dame. so it was kind of symbolic that we got married there. It was kind of a dream since I started college," she said. 
That dream came true when she met Paul. They began dat­ing, fell in love, and were en­gaged in August of 1990, the beginning of Brigid's senior year. 
"I literally went in (to Sacred Heart) the day after I got en­gaged," Brigid said. "There were about three time slots left for 1991 and I just kind of grabbed one." 

While she had her heart set 
on a October wedding, the 
Basilica's almost-full calendar 
forced them to settle for 
November. "You've got to be 
flexible." she said. 
"You have to mold your wed­ding to fit their schedule." Paul added. 
And they did. 
(While Paul had graduated and was working in Fort Wayne, Ind., Brigid made wedding plans during her senior year at Notre Dame as florists, photographers and limousine companies were only a quick car ride or local phone call away.) 
They designed their wedding to work around the Basilica's strict regulations about wedding day timing. "We chose things that were simple and easy." Brigid said, explaining that they decided to hold their reception in the Monogram Room of the JACC, with catering from the University. 
While keeping a close eye on the clock is of utmost impor­tance, Paul and Brigid never felt like they were forced to rush through their 11 a.m. ceremony. In fact. the Sacred Heart wedding staff impressed the Massaros with their organization and flexibility. 
Paul and Brigid's request that the Notre Dame Liturgical Choir and two trumpet players per­form during the ceremony was easily met. And when they asked to bring in a non-Notre

Dame priest, Paul's great uncle, to perform the ceremony, the staff made every effort to make him feel comfortable in an unfamiliar church. 
"They've got it down to a science. As long as you follow their directions, you can't go wrong," Paul said. "Despite what you hear about how nit­picky they are, it really went well." . 
The couple now lives in Cincinnati, Ohio, and remem­bers their wedding day fondly. "It was just a perfect day-even though it was rainy, cold and we both got parking tickets at the ACC," Paul said, laughiqg. 
For Sarah Hamilton and John Magill, deciding to get married wasn't as difficult as what came next-trying to squeeze into Sa­cred Heart's very busy wedding schedule. 
The 1986 Notre Dame gradu­ates were engaged in March, 1988, and hoped to get married the following spring. 
"John was in grad school at OSU (Ohio State University) and we wanted to get married during his spring break," said Sarah, who was working as a reporter for the Eagle Gazette in Lancaster, Ohio. "But that was Lent and you can't get married during Lent." 
Choosing June as the next best month, Sarah and John were told that Sacred Heart would be closed for renovations. 
"So then we had to re-shuffie again, trying to come up with a date," Sarah said.

"I insist on the wedding party arriving at least a half hour early. That's the only way I can guarantee that we get started on time." 
With many wedding parties coming from out of town, guests are often late and schedules can be easily thrown off. One bride was five minutes late and even forgot the rings for the cere­mony, according to Kelly. 
"We have a really hard time getting people from the 9:30 
a.m. wedding out of here by the time the 11 a.m. wedding people start arriving at 1 0:30," Kelly said. "You have to be an army sargeant." 
With her intercom phone in the outer vestibule, Kelly can do just that. She uses it to alert the priest that they are ready, and to call the organist in the choir loft, signalling her to start the music. 
Time is precious when you only have up to an hour and a half to perform a wedding cere­mony and Mass, and take pho­tographs, according to Kelly. 
"I tell the photographers when they have to stop. If they don't, I go out and tell them 'No more-out,"' she explained.

easy to explain and predict the policies of other countries, based on their geographical and ideological orbits around the United States or Soviet Union. 
At present there is a new world disorder. The Middle East is as embroiled in controversy as it ever was. The Soviet Union dissolved itself, having as its heir a Russian Federation with no heart or capital to continue the arms race. (Whether the Russians would scatter their nuclear weapons among many nations for the sake of money is another story). Nations no longer need to tailor their policies to mollify the Soviets or their opponents. 
The exhilarating fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunifica­tion of Germany had seemed to be the first-fruits of further in­crease in peaceful unification of nations. But freed from cold­war distractions, people re­sumed the perennial pastime of nationalism. 
That is not to say ethnic dis­putes had disappeared entirely. In the mid-80s, animosity be­tween Sunni and Shiite Moslems prov9ked the war be­tween Iran and Iraq, for in­stance. IRA-Unionist violence in 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Northern Ireland hit its height in the early 1970s and still con­tinues today. 
But most alarming are the new escalations of old rivalries. Not content with their oppres­sion and impoverishment as part of the Soviet Union, newly­sovereign republics squabble with each other over territorial boundaries and harass ethnic minorities within their own borders. Just as distressing in its bloodless way is the separa­tion of Czechoslovakia into two republics. 
The nadir of nationalist fervor is, of course, Yugoslavia. Fol­lowing the death of Tito, the country had enjoyed a few years of relative prosperity, grounded in an uneasy unity forged by oppression orches­trated by Tito. 
But it took less than a decade before provinces sought sovereignty and armed conflict broke out. Hostilities escalated, surging through Croatia in 1991 and reaching new levels of methodical horror in the 'ethnic cleansing' of Bosnia in 1992. It is as if the Serbians cannot rest until no Muslim is left in this territory, and vice versa. 
The absurdity of the situation is brought home by glancing at the map of Bosnia proposed by the Vance-Owen negotiation team. In hopes of avoiding in­volvement by Western troops, the negotiators have proposed that Bosnia be split into about a dozen semi-autonomous can­tons like Switzerland -some Serbian, others Muslim and Croat. As if Bosnia weren't small enough, some of the new cantons would be less than twenty miles square. 
By those standards, South Bend and the St. Joseph River valley are fully entitled to politi­cal sovereignty, and in order to enroll at Notre Dame, we'd have to pass through Hoosier immigration. 

Two features of these conflicts are noteworthy. The first is their economic futility. Granted, the new divisions often reflect ethnic groups living in distinct locations speaking a different language. 
The borders we grew up with were contrivances of the first and second World Wars. But the case of Yugoslavia shows how the ethnic groups are inex­tricably intermingled, village by village, block by block. 
Yet the lust for sovereignty leads all these groups to claim rights to a piece of turf (in Bosnia by destroying it). When economic exigencies lead Western European nations to submit to common economic a'uthority, tiny territories claim economic independence. Creat­ing national borders where none had been before is a per­verse action, adding bureau­cratic waste, while risking insti­tutionalized bigotry. 

The second feature is religion. Religious loyalties exacerbate any tensions felt between distinct ethnic groups. In the former Yugoslavia, blood is shed by the Catholic Croats, Orthodox Serbs, and the Muslim residents of Bosnia. In India hundreds were killed in rioting precipitated by the destruction of a mosque built on an ancient Hindu holy site, an echo of the violence attending Indian independence. The two most bigoted regimes in the English­speaking world are found in .. South Africa and Northern Ireland, and in both the bigotry is supported by Calvinist certainties about the saved and damned. 
Religions can and have taught the faithless are subhuman. Even when they teach the opposite, the lesson is easily forgotten. When God is central to life (as is proper), believers want to make friendships and marriages that support this de­votion. They wind up with friends and family mostly of the same faith, and those of other faiths become marginalized and finally negligible. Today's conflicts display the conse­quences of neglecting social ties to persons outside our faith.

Men swim at Chicago ln last dual m~et of season 
By ALLISON MCCARTHY 
Sports Writer 

The men's swimming team will travel to Chicago this weekend to compete in its final dual meet of the season this weekend. Led by co-captains John Godfrey and Tom Whowell, the lrish will face the University of Illinois-Chicago Saturday. 
The series between UIC and Notre Dame, which began nearly a decade ago. has pri­marily been dominated by the Irish. But with a new coach, the University of Illinois· Chicago has had a very suc­cessful season. including a near victory over Northern Illinois last weekend. 
"As the last dual meet of the season, this is a sort of tune-up for the championship meets ahead." said Head Coach Tim Welsh. 
Tho meet will have more of a sprint format than usual. Both relays will be 200 yards instead of tht~ traditional 400, and all stroke events will be 100 yards long.

"The men have not had chance to race these events in meet since Christmas. This · give us a chance to focus o starts, turns, and details tha we're not able to be as attentive to in the longer races," Wels said. 
UIC has. strong competitio for the Irish in both the medle relay and the sprint stroke events. As well, they are "pretty solid in diving," the 20 l.M., and the 200 butterfly, ac­cording to Welsh. 
"They will have a competitive team," he commented. 
Welsh is counting on Notre Dame's balance and depth t carry them past UIC. "If yo look at the total thirteen even program, we are a deeper more balanced team," he stated. 
"But Illinois-Chicago will force us to be race-sharp. We couldn't have asked for a bette format going into the champi­onship season."

Tennis hopes for upset of Kentucky 
By RIAN AKEY Sports Writer 
Can Notre Dame stay with Kentucky? 
That question is a popular one on campus this week, and the responses of most Irish fans aren't very optimistic. That's because most people who hear that question think of Satur­day's men's basketball contest between the two teams. 
Members of the twenty-sec­ond ranked Irish women's tennis squad, however, are confident that the Irish can upset the Wildcats. That's be­cause their team travels to Lexington, KY. this weekend to take on the eighteenth-ranked Wildcats, followed by a match against eleventh-ranked Ten­nessee. 
Three freshmen-Wendy Crabtree, Holyn Lord, and Sherri Vitale-have jumped into the tennis starting lineup. 
All three women won their singles matches in Tuesday's 7­2 thrashing of a solid Wisconsin team in Madison. Perhaps the most impressive win was Crab­tree's 6-0, 6-0 victory in her

Runners set for Central Collegiates 
By SEAN SULLIVAN Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's track team will travel to East Lansing Saturday to compete at the 67th Annual Central Collegiate Indoor Champion­ships. This meet will feature strong regional teams, including Michigan, Eastern Michigan and Michigan State. 
Last year, the Irish finished seventh in the meet with a score of 59.50, while Eastern Michigan won its third straight title with a 151 point effort. 

In order to combat the stiffer competition, some of Notre Dame's best runners will com­pete in more than one event. "Times may not be as fast as last week but they'll be competitive races. People tend to run more tactical races," said Piane. 
"I am very excited about .competing in East Lansing this weekend," he continued. " We haven't seen the Michigan team, and we had only seen part of the Eastern Michigan team. Michigan State is also a strong team."

The Irish will be taking on Bowling Green, Ball State, and Western Michigan, a competitor from last weekend's Meyo Invitational, held at the Loftus Sports Center. 
Last week, Notre Dame com­peted very fiercely against teams from across America and Canada, including Michigan, Windsor, and Illinois State. Karen Harris came out on top in the shotput, while Erica Peterson won the 400 meters and the 4x880 relay team took first with a University indoor record time of 9:27.35. Western Michigan was led last weekend by Jill Stamison in the distance events, winning the 800 and setting a Meyo Invita­tional record in the 1000 me­ters with a time of 2:55.38. 
"The distance events will be key," said runner Kristi Kramer, who placed second in the 5000 meters at the Meyo Invitational. "We feel like we should be able to run pretty well as a team tomorrow." 
The Irish will be look to dis­tance runners Emily Husted, Stefanie Jensen, Eva Flood, and captain Lisa Gorski to carry the main load in the stronger events of the other teams in the meet, while Karen Harris, who continues to edge closer to qualification for the NCAA Championships March 12 and 13, will be Notre Dame's main competitor in the field events. 
Latrice Waters and freshman Erica Peterson will lead the team in the sprints.

..,. Men's tennis faces two more powers 
By JONATHAN JENSEN 
Sports Writer 

The powP.rhousP.s just keep on coming for the Notre Dame men's tennis team, as the Irish travel to Minneapolis to face two more excellent opponents this weekend-New Mexico tonight and the Golden Gophers of Minnesota on Saturday night. 
"This is a big event for Min­nesota," noted assistant coach .J.P. Weber. "They will really be motivated to play against us." 
The matchups are yet another challenge on the Irish's power­packed schedule this season, which is arguably the toughest in the country. 
The Irish head into the meet on an uncharacteristic two­match losing streak, after falling to two top-15 opponents. On Jan 31. the Irish fell to 8th­ranked North Carolina 5-3, and on. Tuesday the 11th-ranked Kentucky Wildcats edged Notre Dame 5-4. 
"Going in, we felt that we could have won them both, and we were in a position to do so,"

hurt, it has made it even 
tougher." 
That Andy is senior Andy Zurcher, who was a member of the number-one doubles team and played two-singles, but has been lost to the Irish indefinitely after suffering tendon damage in his wrist. 
In Zurcher's absence, the Irish have shuffled their doubles lineup, which has yet to come around. Forsyth and senior Chuck Coleman fell to the Tarheels and picked up a win against Kentucky, while the two-doubles team of seniors Mark Schmidt and Chris Wojta­lik won at the opposite matches. The only constant has been the third-squad of senior Ron Rosas and freshman Jason Pun, who are 3-0. 
"Both their doubles squads are extremely good, so the doubles point will be crucial this weekend," stated Weber. 
The singles lineup has been dependable, but since Zurcher's injury the sixth spot has yet to be set in stone. First Pun, then junior Tom North, and now junior Todd Wilson is healthy and will take over at the last singles spot.

Irish face major test in 'Cats 
-
By RICH KURZ Associate Sports Editor 

The task Notre Dame's men's basketball team faces Saturday will not be an easy one. As a matter of faet. it may just be the toughest game the Irish play all season. 
The University of Kentucky comes into the game ranked second in the country, boasting a 17-1 record through Tuesday and one of the top players in the nation. 
Jamal "Monster Mash" Mashburn, a 6'8", 240-lb. for-ward, is one of the favorites for 1993 player of the year. A multi­talented player. Mashburn is equally comfortable behind the three-point line, setting the UK record for three-point shooting percentage at 43.9% last season, and banging in the lane, finishing fourth in the Southeast Conference with 7.8 rebounds a game. 

"There aren't enough acco­lades to describe how we feel about Jamal Mashburn, because he has maintained his humility, along with his basketball greatness." said Kentucky coach Rick Pitino. "He can only get better. because he's still physically young." 
So far this season, Mashburn is making his coach's prediction come true. Mashburn is averaging 21.9 points per game and 7.9 rebounds, including season-highs of 38 points and 19 rebounds versus Eastern Kentucky. 
The Wildcats have been im­pressive so far this season, slipping only to number-11 Vanderbilt in Nashville. But that one loss was enough to knock them from the top spot in the polls, a rank they inherited after Duke fell to Georgia Tech. 
Along the way, though, the 'Cats beat current number-one Indiana in a border skirmish in Louisville. 
But Mashburn isn't the only weapon Kentucky has. At 5'9", 160 lbs., Travis Ford doesn't look much like a dangerous basketball player. But looks can be deceiving. A transfer from Missouri, Ford took over the point guard spot with the grad­uation of Sean Woods, and has proved a more than capable replacement. 
In addition to being a skilled playmaker, Ford is also dan­gerous from three-point range, a key in Pitino's up-tempo style

of play. 
Another one of Kentucky's top players may not have much collegiate experience, but that hasn't stopped him from making his presence known. Freshman Rodrick Rhodes, a 6'6" forward, is a product of St. Anthony's High School in Jersey City, N.J., the same school that turned out Duke's Bobby Hurley and Seton Hall's Terry Dehere, and has exploded onto the college scene. 
"He's a slasher, extremely quick," said Pitino. 
Another newcomer is Rodney Dent. a junior college transfer, is Kentucky's man in the middle. The 6'10" Dent is averaging 6.6 points and 6.6 rebounds per game. He has brought a new dimension to Kentucky's game. 
"Rodney gives us a presence on the team that we did not have last season," Pitino said. "He's an enforcer. He's very physical and very aggressive." 
The final piece in the starting rotation for the Wildcats is Dale Brown, a 6'2" senior guard from the same high school as Green Bay cornerback Terrell Buckley and former Florida quarterback Shane Matthews. 
Brown was the defensive player of the year for Ke-ntucky and is emerging as a three­point threat on the offensive end of the court. 
Kentucky also utilizes a strong bench in its up-tempo attack. Gimel Martinez, the starting center from last season, and Andre Riddick provide the Wildcats with strength up front. 
When Pitino came to Ken­tucky from coaching the Knicks in 1989, he brought his trade­mark style of basketball with him. His teams have always pushed the ball up the court and Pitino encourages his ath­letes to shoot, especially from behind the three-point line. 
An equally important aspect of the game from Kentucky's 
RODRICK RHODES 
This season, Rhodes is biding his time while Mashburn polishes his NBA skills. The freshman still manages 11.8 points per game as Kentucky's second-leading scorer. 


standpoint is the defensive end. In order to get more shots for his offense, Pitino likes his team to press, and has even nicknamed their press "the mother-in-law" because it nags and harasses their opponent. 
Kentucky's balanced attack will give the Irish problems in all parts of the game. Mashburn will present match-up dif­ficulties for Notre Dame. Monty Williams has the athletic ability to cover Mashburn on the perimeter, but Mashburn outweighs Williams by 40 pounds, so Williams will have problems when "Monster Mash" takes the ball inside. 
DALE BROWN 
Contrary to legend, Brown is not the LSU coach's long-lost son. Kentucky's defensive player of the year in. 1992,drew praise for his play against Duke in the NCAA tournament.

Hurricanes on the ·court could wake up the echoes and fans 
Can you hear a raucous chant emanating from the usually subdued JACC crowd-"WE WANT MIAMI! WE WANT MIAMI! WE WANT MIAMI!" 
Dick Rosenthal, please give us something we will all enjoy. Please put the Miami Hurricanes on our 
schedule-our  men's  basketball  
schedule.  
For  two  teams  not  destined  to  

engage in post-season play, the game would bring meaning. For the winners, it would bring pride and fulfillment. For the losers, it would bring humilia­tion and pain. 
In no other game would the look of intensity in the eyes of Joe or Jon Ross burn so fiercly. How could they possibly live with themselves, or each other, after losing to Miami? How could they show their faces in the dining hall or at the 'brare'? 
Both Notre Dame and Miami fans have grown accustomed to not losing. The word is rarely uttered, much less experienced, during the fall. It hasn't been easy watching our basketball team get bumped off by teams like Providence, Detroit Mercy, and Butler. 
Our fans need something to get them excited, at least caffeine (but please, Miami, no cocaine). We need a date with Miami. 
On paper, the game only marginally qualifies as a Division-! matchup. Miami is wallowing at the bottom of the Big East, while the Irish have stumbled to 8-11 after losing their last five. 
But one factor that doesn't register on paper is hate. No other institution generates such hate among the Christian student body at Notre Dame. Not parietals. Not DART. Not bookstore prices. Nor dining hall food. 
The humiliating 54-7 loss in Miami in 1986, the fight in the tunnel at Notre Dame stadium two years later, the cocky taunting and overall success of the Miami football team brings instant envy and hatred to all Notre Dame fans. This type of hatred can inspire raucous emotion from fans and peak performances from players. 
The Irish sport a 4-0 record against the 'Canes on the hardwood, including pounding them 126-7 3 in Florida in 1986 and a 107-60 in 1990. 
Notre Dame's athletic department did take this hate factor into account in 1987 when scheduling the ultra­successful Fall Classic, a baseball tournament between the Irish and the 'Canes on the eve of the football game. 
Irish coach Pat Murphy and his squad responded with a 10-1 drubbing of Miami and All-American pitcher Joe Grahil. The game also proved a suc­cess at the turnstiles, as a capacity crowd of 5,800, the most ever during a Notre Dame baseball game, packed South Bend's Coveleski Stadium.

Speeches can't lift Irish over Xavier 
By GEORGE DOHRMANN Sports Writer 
With a little over thirteen minutes left in last night's women's basketball game between Notre Dame and Xavier at the Joyce ACC, Irish captain Coquese Washington gathered her teammates in a circle. "Come on now," said the senior guard after The Lady Musketeers had tied the score at 49-49. "We gotta do it on defense." 
Washington was right. Xavier had erased a nine point deficit in the last five minutes by beating the Irish down the floor, getting easy scores before the Irish defense could get set. The had not only lost the lead but also the momentum, and the small ground on hand was be­ginning to sound even thinner.

Swimmers to face UIC 
By HALEY SCOTT Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's swim team travels to Chicago tomorrow to swim their last dual meet of the season against the University of Illinois-Chicago. The competition will have to come from within. 
"We have completely dominated the series," head coach Tim Welsh said. The Irish have beaten UIC each time the two teams have competed, and this weekend should be no different. 
The University of Chicago-Illinois has a new head coach, "a better head coach 
 see Men's Swimming/page 12 and a better 
program" this year, according to Welsh. They are coming off a four point loss last weekend against Northern Illinois University, a team the Irish beat earlier this season. 
Instead of worrying about the competitor, the Irish will focus on improving their racing skills. 
"We will be looking to fine tune our racing techniques. We will race while at the same time be working on our starts, our (flip) turns, and our finishes. Our attention will be on the mechanics," said assistant coach Randy Julian. 
Because of their lack of depth, UIC asked that the schedule of events be changed from the traditional thirteen event program, with 200-yard stroke events, to 100-yard stroke events. Welsh says this is because UIC sprints better, and is stronger in the shorter backstroke and breaststroke events. 
The line-up for the Irish shows seniors Tanya William and Kay Broderick and freshman Anna Cooper competing against one of UIC's better swimmers in the backstroke event. Williams will also be seen, along with freshmen Alisa Springman and Bridget Casey,.in the 100-yard breaststroke. 
Welsh has no problem with the shorter event program. "It will give us a chance to race fast with good speed. They are thinner than us (numerical wise) in the distance events, and won't be much competition. But they will give us the opportunity to race defense could not stop coach Muffet McGraw's team from a shot at vie1ory in the game's closing seconds. A baseline jumper by forward Sherri Orlosky pulled Notre Dame within two with 56 Sl~conds left. On the ensuing posse~;sion, Washington stole the ball from Xavier guard Nicole Like, but missed a layup. 

On the next possession, Like found herself on the free-throw line with 24 seconds remaining. After missing front end of a one and one, Notre again had a chance to tie the sc fumbled attempt by Notre Dame's o resulted in a loose ball, but the Irish covered, and McGraw called a timeou with nine seconds remaining to set up final play.

Hockey enters weekend without leading scorers 
"Every game is important and we need some help from other teams in order to avoid playing one of the top teams in the playoffs," says Irish head coach Ric Schafer. 
Notre Dame (6-20-2 overall; 4-18-2 in the CCHA) will try to break a 5 game losing streak this weekend without the services of two of its top scorers. Freshman Jaime Morshead, their leading goal scorer, is out indefinitely with a broken claviCle. While senior Curtis Janicke will miss the games because of an injured shoulder. 

"Someone has to step up and everyone needs to contribute." said Irish senior Dave Bankoske. 
"Carey Nemeth played well last weekend and I expect other players to produce," said Schafer. 
Bowling Green enters Friday's game after two weeks off from competition. The Irish must contain Falcons sophomore center Brian Holzinger. Holzinger's scored 23 goals and dished out 19 assists in 30 games this season. "We'll need to shadow him at all times, because he can hurt us," said Schafer. 
Besides Holzinger, BGSU boasts a 20 goal scorer in junior wing Sean Pronger. Also, senior Brett Harkins (14G, 21A) and freshmen Jason Helbing (llG, 11A) can hurt the Irish. 
Bowling Green leads the overall series 15-12-2, including a 10-4-0 record at the Ice Arena. 
On Saturday. Notre Dame faces off 
against Ferris State for the third weekend in a row Ferris is lnd by junior wing Doug Smith (17G, 8AI and se­nior center Kevin Moore ( 5G, 1 7 A). Junior Pat Mazzoli is the Bulldogs goaltender who allows only 3.23 goals per game and has beaten the Iris1 the past two weeks. 
The Irish will counter their oppo!;ition with freshmen Jaime Ling (lOG, 25A) and Brett Bruininks (6G, 6A), while Bankoske (11G, 11A) and junior captain Matt Osiecki (4G, 9A) provide experience and scoring depth. 
The Irish goalie situation has cl ared up. Juniors Greg Louder and Brent Lothrop will split the action this weekend. "Depending on whether or not they are sharp will determine if they play," comments Schafer. 
"We've missed some opportunities thus far and we have to battle to remedy the situation," concludes Schafer. "It wouid be great if we an get to the ninth S(:Ot in the CCHA and go from there."
