Ticket not punished for election violation 
Freshman Zach Reuvers failed to get each campaign poster approved by Judicial Council 
By STEVE SANTAY 
News Writer 
The Judicial Council decided not to reprimand Zach Heuvers' sophomore class council ticket on accusations involving the misuse of funds and campaign materials because the accusations did not change or affect the outcome of the election. 
Reuvers' ticket lost to Cynthia Weber's ticket, the Judicial Council announced on March 12, nearly two weeks after the run-off election between the two tickets took place on Feb. 
28. The Council delayed the release of the results until their investigation of Reuvers' ticket was finished. 
An anonymous source origi­
nally told the Judicial Council 
Reuvers had broken campaign­
ing regulations by spending too 
much money on flyers and by 
distributing posters that had 
not been approved. Judicial 

Council vice president Daniel Smith would neither confirm ·nor deny whether Reuvers' 
competition, the Weber or 
Hannah Ha tickets, were 
involved in bringing forth these 
allegations. 
"The Council did meet and 
determined that one of the two 
allegations brought forward 
was valid," Smith said. 
"However, the committee 
determined that the outcome of 
the election was not changed, so no formal punishment was handed out." 

Strict rules that govern stu­dent government campaigns allow only $75 to be spent on flyers. The accusation made against Heuvers' ticket by an anonymous source claimed that they went over this amount. 
After reviewing the Reuvers ticket's records, the Judicial Council determined only $67 were spent in this manner. The allegation was subsequently dismissed. 
The ticket was also accused of using unapproved campaign materials, a claim that turned out to be true according to the Council's investigation. 
After the primary elections on Feb. 25, the ticket changed the voting date on its posters to read Feb. 28, in order to encourage sophomores to vote the run-off election. The Reuvers ticket, however, did not get approval from the Judicial Council to make this change to its posters. 

A similar issue had been raised earlier in the campaign. 
The day before the primary elections, a complaint was raised against Reuvers for handing out unapproved cam­paign materials. While most of the posters his ticket used car­ried the approval stamp from the Judicial Council, a few were overlooked. Some of the

Student Senate resumed discussion on a resolution that proposes to add sexual orientation to Notre Dame's non-discrimination clause. 
The Senate, however, could not vote on the resolu­tion at yesterday's meeting because not enough mem­bers were present for quo­rum. 
The proposed resolution supports this change in the non-discrimination clause for several reasons. It states that the Catechism of the Catholic Church opposes 

Mendoza reclaims No. 3 Business Week ranking 
By BECKY HOGAN 
News Writer 
The Mendoza College of Business has reclaimed its No. 3 ranking of the nation's top busi­rwss schools for undergraduates according to BusinessWeek mag­azine's Mar. 10 issue, jumping finrr spots from its 2007 ranking. 
Notre Dame's College of Business previously held the No.:1 spot in 200(J, its highest ranking to date. 
Mendoza is exceeded only by the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and the University of Virginia's Mcintire School of Commerce, who occu­pied the top two spots, respec­tively. 
" I would say we've actually been performing this way before there was a ranking, and we haven't tried to change anything to get a higher ranking," said Carolyn Y. Woo, Martin J. Gillen Dean of Business. "We are always trying to improve, but it's not because of rankings ... whenever we see new opportu­nities or weak spots we try to attend to these." 
Woo said that Mendoza's high national ranking can be attrib­uted to several factors including rigorous academics, job place­ment suceess after graduation. thP strong alumni network and the College's emphasis on ethics.

News Writer 
Science research enthusi­asm at Notre Dame has recently intensified as the NASA space shuttle Endeavor -launched Mar. 11 -car­ried with it a set of experi­ments designed by one of Notre Dame's own profes­sors. 
Dennis Jacobs, University vice president and associate Provost, designed the experi­ments for outer space testing purposes. Jacobs is also a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at Notre Dame. 
"We are placing one hun­dred or so materials outside the international space sta­tion for a period of a year to learn under different envi­ronments how different materials will either hold up or be damaged to the point where they no longer func­tion," Jacobs said. 
The experiments are part of the Materials International Space Statio'n Experim en t (MISSEl. a collaboration that aims to explore how materi­als degrade in the low-earth orbit spacecraft environment.

Molloy, who co-drafted the resolution with Pangborn senator Denise Baron, said that the issue first arose in 1998 when both the Faculty and Student Senates passed a similar resolution. The administration did riot change the non-discrimination clause.

that should be taken into con­sideration," he said. "I think that as student leaders, we should be exercising our own independent thought and judgment." 
Additionally, Bant feared that a nondiscrimination clause would open the University to liability, increasing the possibility of a lawsuit against Notre Dame for diseriminating someone based on sexual orientation. 
"I don't think that the University is actually is going to· be sued for aetively dis­criminating against people, but I think people can use loopholes and use things given to them to make cases out of things that were not the issue," he said. "It's unfortunate, it's the way the Ameriean legal system works, but it's true, and it can hap­pen." 
Some members did not want liability to be the Senate's main concern. 
Outgoing chief executive assistant Sheena Plamoottil said she believed that sup­porting the Church's teach­ings on tolerance and fighting for minorities on campus are more important goals. 
"I think it's dangerous to think that liability should be the most important issue here," she said. "Even more than liability, tolerance should be thought about." 
Currently, Notre Dame abides by "The Spirit of Inclusion," which was set forth by du Lac and is not legally binding, according to Molloy. This clause, according to O'Neill senator Matt Molloy, condemns harassment of any kind. 
The proposed resolution states that adding sexual ori­entation to the non-discrimi­nation clause would give legal protection against dis­crimination based on sexual orientation, according to 
waste of [the 
Senate's] time" and did not believe that the Senate would have much influence. 
"We did it last year and it was also done in 1998, and nothing happened," he said. "I think that it's a little naive to believe that passing a simi­lar resolution today will have any different effect than it did last year." 
Howard senator Erdina Francillon said that despite the administration's lack of support, the Senate has the responsibility to support Notre Dame's minorities and to fight for this resolution until its goal is fulfilled. 
"I think that the strongest act that we as a Senate ean take is to pass this every year... until we get the atten­tion of the administration, get the attention of the Church, so people in higher positions than we are can realize that this is an issue we care about," she said. "We should take that rejection as a chal­lenge." 
Francillon also said she was disappointed that the Senate did not vote on the resolution when Molloy and Baron intro­duced in at the February 27 meeting. The Senate had voted to amend the resolution after Bant said he found that Holy Cross College does not include sexual orientation in its non-discrimination clause as the amendment says. 
Molloy said that after fur­ther research was inconclu­sive, the Senate replaced Holy Cross College with Georgetown University. However, Baron said that the amended clause "was not the crux of the resolution." 
The Senate plans to vote on this resolution at next week's meeting, which will be the last meeting of the current term.

enue for the space they occu­pied. 
Jim LaBella, General Manager of the Huddle Mart who helped implement the changes, said that there has been an increase in the num­ber of students requesting gluten-free and natural gro­cery products. 
Jocie Antonelli, the manager of nutrition and safety for Notre Dame Food Services, made suggestions to LaBella based on comments from stu­dents with vegan, dairy-free and gluten-free diets. 
Antonelli assists students with special dietary needs in the campus dining halls ­adding special products in the Huddle Mart is the first attempt of Food Services to accommodate needs at the multiple food locations across campus. 
"So many students with gluten-free diets had trouble finding things on campus they could snack on. The new prod­ucts give them more options on campus to eat," Antonelli said. 
If students did not have a car to shop for food off-campus, they had to seek alternatives like care-packages sent from home, ordering food online or personal shopping by Antonelli, she said. 
LaBella spoke with a distrib­utor of natural foods, and the distributor also made recom­mendations on what products would sell and meet the stu­dents' needs at Notre Dame. 
The response to the new products has been "very good," and he will continue to order health food and natural grocery items that cater to stu­dents' needs but added that the Huddle Mart cannot have products so specific that they will not sell. 

"I am asking people who have allergies to let me know if there are other items missing. I think having a variety of products that serve everyone is a positive all the way around," LaBella said. 
Among the new items for sale, pita chips, microwavable noodle and rice bowls and snack bars have been popular, LaBella said. 
One student who benefits from this improvement is freshman, Michelle Gaseor who has an autoimmune disor­der called Celiac Disease, whieh limits her diet to gluten­free foods. She cannot 'eat products containing wheat, barley, oats or rye. 
If a person suffering from Celiac Disease, also known as eliac sprue, or gluten sensitive enteropathy (GSE), consumes food containing gluten, the villi in the small intestine are dam­aged, preventing them from properly absorbing nutrients, according to the Celiac Disease Foundation's website. This can lead to more long-term health problems such as osteoporosis and lactose intolerance, among other health issues according to the website. 

"I wasn't able to use [my Flex Points] on anything healthy. I'm pretty happy with the new products," said Gaseor, referring to the money allotted with her Student Meal Plan. 
Before the Huddle Mart began carrying the new prod­ucts, Gaseor was forced to store a large supply of gluten­free snack bars that she brought from her home in her dorm room. Gaseor is now able to buy snack bars, pasta meals, and cookies in the Huddle Mart. 
She added that the prices at The Huddle Mart are also helpful to her. While shopping for foods that will accommo­date a gluten-free diet, Gaseor has learned to compare prices and said that she will continue to shop at the Huddle Mart where the prices on gluten­free foods are not significantly higher than other stores. 
"The Huddle Mart prices are pretty competitive, which is nice," Gaseor said.

Bin Laden to release new messaue 
CAIRO, Egypt -Al-Qaida leader Osama oin Laden will be issuing a new message timed to the filth anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, a militant Web site with close connections to the group said Wednesday. 
"Urgent, very soon by the will of God," read the announcement of the new message "the response is what you see and not what you hear. by the warrior sheik, Osama bin Laden." 
Iraq marked the fifth anniversary of the war on Wednesday. The announcement was text only and showed no pictures of the elusive militant leader. 
The message would be bin Laden's first for 2008 and follows up an hour-long, late December audio missive in which he warned Iraq's Sunni Arabs against fighting al-Qaida in Iraq and vowed new attacks on Israel. 
Iraq to hold provincial elections in fall 
BAGHDAD-Under strong U.S. pressure, Iraq's presidential council signed off Wednesday on a measure paving the way for provincial elections by the fall, a major step toward easing sectarian rills as the nation marks the fifth anniversary of the war. 
The decision by the council, made up of the country's president and two vice presidents, lays the 1-,>Toundwork for voters to choose new leaders of Iraq's 18 provinces. The elections open the door to greater Sunni representation in regional administrations. 
Many Sunnis boycotted the last election for provincial oflirials in January 2005, enabling Shiitns and Kurds to win a disproportionate share of power at the expense of the Sunnis -even in areas with substantial Sunni populations.

PIEDMONT. Mo. -Residents of low-lying towns stacked sandbags or grabbed belongings and evacuated Wednesday after a foot of rain pushed rivers and creeks out of their banks in the nation's midsection. At least 13 deaths had been linked to the weather, and three people were missing. 
Hecord or ncar-record flood crests were fore­cast at several towns in Missouri. Flooding was reported in large areas of Arkansas and parts of southern Illinois, southern Indiana and south­wostern Ohio, and schools were closed in parts of western Kentucky because of flooded roads.

Gambling now legal in taverns, bars 
INDIANAPOLIS -Gov. Mitch Daniels has signed a bill that will allow taverns and bars to offer pull tabs and other low-stakes gambling. 
Proponents of the bill say it could help bar and tavern owners retain jobs and stay in business, while opponents claim it is another sign that Indiana is addicted to gambling. Daniels had considered letting the bill become law without his signature, but ultimately decided to sign it Wednesday. 
"Hoosiers believe in freedom, but also in personal responsibility in the exercise of our liberties," he said in a statement Wednesday. "I sign this bill with misgivings and caution. and the hope that any Hoosiers who choose to risk their money in these games will do so responsibly and with extreme care." 
Bush urges U.S. to stay course in Iraq 
President won't orderfurther troop withdrawls, praises military success in past year 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Five years after launching the invasion of Iraq. President Bush strongly signaled Wednesday that he won't order troop withdrawals beyond those already planned because he refuses to "jeopardize the hard­fought gains" of the past year. 
As anti-war activists demonstrated around downtown Washington, the president spoke at the Pentagon to mark the anniversary of a war that" has cost nearly 4,000 U.S. lives and roughly $500 bil­lion. The president's address was part of a series of events the White House planned around the anniversary and next month's report from the top 
U.S. figures in Iraq, Gen. David Petraeus and Ambassador Hyan Crocker. That report will be the basis for Bush's first troop-level decision in seven months. 
"The battle in Iraq has been longer and harder and more costly than we antici­pated," Bush said. 

But, he added, before an audience of Pentagon brass, soldiers and diplomats: "The battle in Iraq is noble, it is necessary, and it is just.

ISRAEL 

Security alert, West Bank closed for holiday 
Associated Press 

JERUSALEM -Israel declared a heightened security alert Wednesday and barred Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip from entering the country, fearing I-lezbollah guerrillas might try to carry out a major attack during holi­day celebrations this week. 
The Purim holiday coincides with the end of a 40-day mourning period for I-lezbollah commander Imad Mughniyeh, who was killed in a car bombing in Syria last month. Israel denied involvement, but the Lebanese guerrilla group blamed Israel and vowed revenge. 
The alert came amid new signs that Israel is moving closer to a 
cease-fire with l-lamas militants in the Gaza Strip. Israeli defense offi­cials said Amos Gilad, a senior Defense Ministry official, traveled to Cairo on Tuesday for talks with Egyptian mediators. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the talks. 
The army said the closure would remain in effect through Sunday night, preventing thousands of Palestinian workers and merchants from entering Israel. Most come from the West Bank, but small num­bers of merchants from the Hamas­controlled Gaza Strip are allowed in. 
The closure won't affect Palestinians needing treatment at Israeli hospitals, and cargo cross­ings will keep operating, a military spokesman said on condition of anonymity, citing policy. 
While Israel typically imposes clo­sures during major holidays, when schools are closed and public areas are crowded with travelers, security officials are warier since the Mughniyeh killing. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said police canceled vacations for officers and brought in extra forces to guard festivities, which started at schools Wednesday. 
The Islamic mourning period for Mughniyeh ends this weekend. Hezbollah is believed to have close ties with Palestinian militants in the West Bank, who in the past have carried out attacks during Purim, a holiday when young children dress up in costumes.

Tlw MlSSE-6 experiments will give researchers a better understanding of the condi­tions in the lower-earth orbit, as well as clarify misconcep­tions about outer space. 
"Most people think of space as a vacuum -that there's nothing there ... But the lower-earth orbit is 250 miles above the surface of the earth and it's actually a very hostile environment," Jacobs said. "The kinds of collisions that happen when a shuttle moves at 1,500 miles per hour are so energetic that a material exposed to this environment is often under attack by the elements." 
Jacobs also said that this hostile environment is not protected by an ozone layer, causing intense ultraviolet light to affect the space sta­tion, an occurrence that could be potentially harmful to the various materials used in making satellites. 
To test these factors, mate­rials arc exposed to different elements by placing modified controls on the materials, according Jacobs. 
Additionally, Jacobs said that small data recorders have been installed which 20 minutes throughout the yearlong period.

Jacobs said. "This experiment will be an opportunity to compare our simulation of the space environment with the reality of space."

"We were invited as a team to see if we would like to launch the MISSE-6 experi­ment," Jacobs said. "Notre Dame stepped up in a big way to spearhead the effort." 
After approximately one year, the materials will be retrieved and examined to assess the cumulative effects of the lower-earth orbit envi­ronment.

IN BRIEF Blood thinner contaminant indentified 
WASIIINGTON -U.S. health officials have identified a contaminant in batches of the blood thinner heparin associated with 19 deaths and are trying to determine how the chemical got into the drug. 
The lots of heparin, whose key ingredient was importnd from China, were recalled Feb. 28, and food and Drug Administration offi­cials said Wednesr;lay that no new deaths have been reported since that time. 
Dr. Janet Woodcock. head of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said the contaminant is oversulfated condroftin sul­fate, a chemical that does not occur naturally. 
Condroitin sulfate is a natural compound that occurs widely and is used as a dietary supplement but the oversulfated version has not been widely studied. 
"We cannot rule in or out whether this was accidentally or deliberately introduced into the product," Woodcock said, "We are investigat­ing how it got in." 
The FDA has also initiated testing of import­ed heparin entering this country and Woodcock said the agency feels "doctors and patients now can be confident that the product on the market has been tested and is safe." 

Market erases most of Tuesday's gains

The Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 300 points aftnr rising 420 on Tuesday. 
Some retrenchment was to be expected after the previous day's huge advance. But the decline also reflects investors' continuing uneasiness about the world's financial system and the U.S. nconomy.

Limits on mortgage firms loosened 
Mandatory cash cushion for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac to be reduced by one-third 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -By making it easie~:. for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to raise funds and back nearly $2 trillion in home loans this year, the government is making its role in steadying the economy decidedly more hands on. 
That strategy is moving the Bush administration toward activist government solutions and away from its traditional free-market leanings. Behind the push: a housing crisis and credit­market calamity that have spread fear through global fmancial markets and made it tough for consumers and businesses to borrow. 
Analysts worry that the opening for Fannie and Freddie could put too much financial risk on the backs of the mortgage-finance companies, which have taken multibillion-dollar hits from the foreclosure wave and have been hun­gry for capital. 
Until a few months ago, administration officials voiced similar concern. They said that allowing the companies to take on more debt could threaten the global financial system, cit­ing the pair's recent mas­sive accounting scandals.

In vvrecks, sturdy cars delay victi111s' rescue 
Study reveals emergency crews struggle to cut through modern autos' reinforced steel frames 
Associated Press 
TAMPA, Fla. -Capt. Clint 
Roberts makes his living cut­
ting accident victims out of 
hideously mangled vehicles, 
but even he could hardly 
believe it when two people in a 
2007 midsize car survived a 
head-on crash with a full-sized 
pickup last year. 
The Ford Fusion's reinforced 
steel construction probably 
saved the lives of the 18-year­
old driver and his 16-year-old 
passenger. But Roberts said it 
gave his Hillsborough County 
Fire Rescue crew fits as they 
tried to free them last 
November. 
Because hydraulic cutters 
couldn't shear the roof posts, 
rescue workers had to turn to 
heavy-duty electric saws, 
replacing blade after blade as 
they dulled on the rugged 
material. 
"It was just beating the soot 
out of the tools," adding min­
utes and delaying medical 
treatment, Roberts said. 
There is no question that 
today's cars save lives by 
cocooning motorists in rein­
forced alloys, impact-absorbing 
crumple zones and as many as 
a dozen air bags. 

But in interviews with The Associated Press, rescue offi­cials and experts from around the United States said the new technology is also hindering extrication of injured people, increasingly forcing crews to work deeper into the critical "golden hour" between acci­. dent and treatment by emer­gency room doctors. On many 2005 and later cars, an extri­cation that once took 10 or 15 minutes can now take twice 
that or longer. 
To catch up, counties and 
cities are spending tens of 
thousands of dollars -if they 
can afford it -to buy more 
powerful equipment that can 
cut through newer cars' rein­
forced steel and the lighter, 
tougher exotic metals used in 
roofs, posts and doors. 
Then there are obstacles that 
endanger rescuers' safety. 
Pressurized gas canisters that 
inf1ate air bags can explode if 
pierced by cutting tools. 
Rescuers can be blown from 
cars when air bags suddenly 
in11ate. Hidden battery cables 
in hybrid cars can deliver a 
powerful shock. 
To protect themselves, work­
ers now have to peel away the 
ceiling and interior plastic to 
see what's underneath before 
they can even start cutting. 
Experts cannot say for cer­
tain whether the delays in get­
ting these victims to the hospi­
tal have resulted in people 
dying. But that's the fear. 
"We build more fire stations, 
we make faster fire trucks, 
we've got helicopters to get you 
to the hospital," said Roberts, 
an expert who teaches extrica­
tion to colleagues around 
Florida. "But what's slowing us 
down are these vehicles that 
are harder for us to get into." 
The problem has rescue 
workers scrambling to update 
their tools and explore differ­
ent ways to attack cars with 
their cutters, spreaders and 
saws. Some agencies with 
equipment more than a few 
years old are arriving at acci­dent scenes and finding out that it will no longer do the job. 

"Because their shearing materials had been so success­ful for so many years, some agencies hadn't developed a Plan B," said Tom Hollenstain, who works to educate rescuers about new auto technology at the State Farm Insurance vehi­cle research center. · 
Leading hydraulic-tool mak­ers such as Hurst Jaws of Life -whose namesake George Hurst introduced the first hydraulic extrication tools for auto racing in the early 1970s -must keep putting more oomph into their equipment, making it heavier and more expensive. A single Hurst cut­ter and power unit runs about $25,000. Add hydraulic spreaders and other tools anc~ the price rises quickly. 
A fire crew in Bonita Springs, Fla., discovered the problem last year when it rolled up on a 2007 Lexus that had over­turned. Hydraulic cutters only a few years old wouldn't shear the strengthened steel roof posts, so the crew had to move quickly to cut other parts of the car. A job that should have taken a few minutes required 20 minutes of cutting and saw­ing to remove the driver. 
Assistant Chief Ken Craft said the incident led the depart­ment to buy new heavy rescue tools costing $54,000 -a siz­able expense for a city of around 40,000. 
"If the automakers roll out something new next year, we could be right back where we were at," Craft said. "That's the problem we're confronted with." 
Mike Ader, a volunteer fire­fighter in Rockville, Md., recalled the layered-steel roof post from a 2008 Toyota Camry that wouldn't budge under the blades of a hydraulic cutter after a broadside crash Jan. 2. The patient, whose injuries were serious but not life­threatening, nnally had to be maneuvered around the post. 
Ader used two types of saws and numerous blades to remove the post after the patient was removed. The department quickly decided to buy a new, more powerful cut­ter. 
The flip side, of course, is that more people are surviving horrific crashes that would have killed them just a few years ago. 
The Fusion's passenger, for example, was hurt but con­scious and joking with Roberts as the crew worked to get him out. The driver of the other vehicle -a 2001 Ford F-150 pickup -was dead at the scene. 
With about three people hurt in car crashes every minute in the United States, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration spokesman Rae Tyson said he is comfortable with the trade-off. Rescue workers, he said, will have to work harder to keep up with technology, just like everybody else. 
"The fatality rate for passen­ger vehicles is the lowest in history," Tyson said. "That, to me, is a pretty good news story." 


Father faces 4 years inprison 
Bogus postingfueled racial conflict between victim and shooter's son 
Associated Press 
RIVERHEAD, N.Y.-A black father was sentenced to two to four years in prison Wednesday for fatally shooting an intoxicated white teenager during a racially charged con­frontation with two carloads of young people at the end of his driveway. 
The parents of victim Daniel Cicciaro Jr., 17, were irate after learning that John White did not receive the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. 
White, 54, was convicted in December of second-degree manslaughter and a weapons charge. 
"Nice message it sends to society that as long as you're black and there's a problem at the end of your driveway you can grab an illegal handgun and shoot someone in the face and get away with it," an infu­riated Daniel Cicciaro Sr. told reporters while dozens of sup­porters sobbed nearby. 
"Well, let's see what hap­pens when Aaron White gets shot, and see how the laws are," Cicciaro said, referring to White's 19-year-old son. 
Defense attorney Frederick Brewington said Cicciaro's remarks appeared to be a threat and demanded an investigation. Prosecutor Thomas Spota said the matter was referred to police, and the Whites were assigned extra protection at their home. 
''I've always remained remorseful about this inci­dent," White told the judge. 
White was led away in handcuffs, but his attorneys immediately filed an appeal and bail was set at $200,000

late Wednesday, said attorney Paul Gianelli. He was expected to remain jailed overnight. 
At the trial, the defense invoked the nation's violent racist past in arguing the shooting was justified, refer­ring to the teenagers as a "lynch mob." 
White testified that he was trying to protect his family on a hot August night in 2006 when he gDt an unregistered pistol from his garage after a group of angry white teenagers turned up at his house to fight his son. He claimed the hand­gun discharged accidentally, killing Cicciaro. 
The conflict was fueled by a bogus Internet posting claim­ing Aaron White wanted to rape a female friend of one of the white teens. 
Cicciaro, who had a blood­alcohol reading above the legal limit for driving, was just 3 inches from the pistol when he was shot in the face, a medical examiner testified.

Garden variety scandals 
Being !'rom New Jersey, state pride has never really been my thing. Don't get me wrong, I love my state, and if I can ever afford to live there in a place other than my parents' house I'd cer­tainly love to. But 
John Everett
for all the things to 
love about New 
Jersey, from Bruce 

Kids These 
Springsteen to the 
Days

three-time StanJp,y Cup winning New Jersey Devils to din­ers at nearly every mile mark on every major highway, it just never occurred to me to think ol' New Jersey as better than any other state. The school system is only, as the state's commercials tell me, "one ol' the top two in the nation." 
I think the Jack of enthusiasm might have to do with the fact that the Garden State is ratlwr dominated by the lurking giant right above, New York. All my life I've watehed sitcoms on New York tele­vision affiliates, I've listened to New York radio stations and read New York newspapers. I've even rooted for New York sports teams, like the Giants and Mets (I'm not much of a hockey fan). 
I Iowever, there has always been one area in which I have always considerp,d New Jersey vastly superior to the Empire State, and though rp,cent head­linp,s might make some reconsider the rankings, I for one refuse to relinquish New Jersey's claim as the home of the most corrupt and scandalous state politicians in the country. 
The immoral acts engaged in by Eliot Spitzer at the Emperor's Club, the details of which are fresh enough in the public conscious as to spare their retelling here, are appalling. A rising star in the Democratic Party has crashed, and a life's work spent prose­cuting those who broke the law is irre­deemably tarnished. In addition to all this, the Spitzer case has once again shown how we in America, in the words of Daniel Patrick Moynihan, are "defin­ing deviancy down." Here is a man who commits adultery with a prostitute, vio­lating the sacred trust of marriage, and the only thing anyone seems to want to talk about is whether or not Spitzer should have paid the extra few thou­sand to move up from a four-diamond hooker to a seven. 
Coupled with the Spitzer scandal is the news which broke just a few hours after David Paterson's inauguration as the new governor. Aftp,r a scandal on the magnitude of the Spitzer affair, New Yorkers may understandably have been looking for a ealm transition, and for promises of a cleaner and more respon­sible government. So of course, nearly the first thing Gov. Paterson does is tPil tlw first reporter he can find that he spent almost three years in relation­ships with women other than his wife. Presumably, the fact that money was not exchanged makes Paterson a cham­pion of the people. 
However, I fear that the media and you, the media-influenced public, might be too caught up in the here-and-now, and be somewhat forgetful of the not­so-far-from-here-and-now. After all, it has only been four years since the gov­ernor of my proud state resigned in order to get in front of the story about how he hired his completely unqualified gay lover to be his Homeland Security adviser at a yearly salary of $110,000 a year, despite the fact that Louis Freeh, the former head of the FBI, volunteered to do the job for free. Gov. McGreevy apparently thought that the fact that Golan Cipel was from Israel would be enough to satisfy everyone in the state that he was qualified to advise the gov­ernor in the event of a terrorist attack. Like in the Spitzer case, there was the pathetic spectacle of McGreevy and his wife standing together at a podium, refusing to directly answer questions or fully admit wrongdoing. But here's when~ New Jersey's expertise in all matters salacious eornes into play: Hather than just resigning efTective shortly thereafter, McGreevy announced that his rnsignation would not take place for three whole months. Why'! Why, to deny the voters of New Jersey the d1anee to choosn his replacmnent in a speeial election, of coursn! You sen in New Jersey, wn only let thp, voters decide who should be in ofliee when all other alternatives have been exhausted. 
I don't think I've ever been prouder of' my home state than I was the othN day when former Gov. McGreevy, now of' all things a divinity student in an Episcopal seminary, in an effort to keep the scan­dal-crown in New .lers~y. said not so fast New York. You sen, he wasn't just cheating on his wife with a state employee, no. lin was having wild sex parties whkh involved his wife. 
llonestly, it's like MeGrenvy was standing up and saying, just try and top that, Paterson. Or maybn he was just trying to publiely embarrass his wife before the upcoming custody hearing over their daughter .Jacqueline, whiln also trying to depmss sales of her book. Either way, it makes my heart stir with pride to be from Nnw Jersey, where we have perfected career-ending scandal.

Catholicism vs. nationalism 
I believe Jay Howley ("Sheen doesn't deserve Laetare Medal," March 
17) is confusing two areas of an American Catholic's life: Rationalism and Catholicism. 
The war in Iraq was called unjust by the Vatican under John Paul II, and Benedict XVI reiterated a call for the end of the war on Sunday. Is the end of this war not the major goal of Not In My Name and ANSWEH'? Sheen may not be acting in ways that seem supportive to the United States, but that may be because supporting U.S. policy may not be the most Catholic thing to do. 
At the beginning of Mass on Sunday we heard of the day when every­one thought that the militant Messiah had come, riding into Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives. But later that same Mass we heard this Messiah say, "for all who take the sword will perish by the sword." 
I eommend Notre Dame for choosing Martin Sheen as a recipient of the Laotere Medal for his inspiring story of rediscovering his faith, his voicn against "the sword" and in support of the weak and poor. And perhaps it is in spite of the fact that he doesn't place the same impor­

Deeper issue must be addressed 
The recent Health and Body Image Conference held at Notre Dame may have succeeded in raising awareness of eating dis­orders, but it hardly succeeded in pinpointing the issues underlying them. 
A distorted body image is not the funda­mental problem, but only a manifestation of the true issue. At their root. eating disorders are a mechanism for coping with extreme anxiety and self-hatred. Our societal fixation on a certain (unrealistic) standard of physical perfection may give the anxiety a vehicle to inhabit. but in absence of a deeper psycho­logical pathology, this ideal will not develop into the obsessive behavior that characterizes an eating disorder. (It is well worth recalling, here, the elinical name-anorexia nervosa -loss of appetite due to nerves). 
Addressing eating disorders, then, involves not merely asking, as Valerie Staples did, "What situations here have contributed to your view of food, weight and body image?'" Rather, it involves asking instead, "What situ­ations have cultivated in you feelings of defi­ciency or self-doubt?" This line of question­ing reveals that eating disorders arise not in a society that prizes merely physical perfec­tion, but one that judges the individual on scholarly, financial, athletic and personal success -to the point of reducing the human 
person to a resume of these accomplish­ments. ' 
The anxiety of never feeling good enough -in any realm -contributes to the develop­ment of an eating disorder. If the University truly wishes to address eating disorders, the solution is not to hold a conference highlight­ing a supermodel as the keynote speaker. 
Ultimately, the University must reevaluate the kind of mental health that is fostered on this campus. More immediately, the University must prioritize making high quali­ty counselling more available to·the student body. 
While it is possible to find this at the coun­selling center, it is also true that the center is chronically unable to meet student demand, consigning some to their waiting list and churning others through at a rushed pace or in a limited number of sessions. Hiring more counselors to supplement the doctoral interns won't eradicate eating disorders on campus, but it will increase the possibility that those who wrestle with them will receive adequate care.

At the age of only 19, Zach Condon, a.k.a. "Beirut", craf'ted one of the most precocious debut records of any American artist in recent memory. Defined by Eastern European and Balkan influences, the album "Gulag Orkestar" weaves a decidedly mature tale of hope, loss and the constant renewal of life as is found when one appreciates the dueling roles of new influences 
amidst the permanence of mmnory. 
Considered part of the indie scene. Beirut has f1own under the radar of many casual indie fans. llis rich and emo­tive voice carries most of the songs, with various instru­ments including the ukulele and the trumpet augmenting the many textures and feel­ings that he brings to each tune.

written with such heartfelt 1~nthusiasm for the lives and Pxperiences of those in Eastern Europe, the Balkans and Hussia. It's a sound tnehniqun and Condon succeeds in conveying a snnsn of the experience faced by those whose stories color his songs. But, since he grew up in the western United States and spent most of his timn making the record in Western Europe, it is unlikely that many of the stories he tells are so much from lived expnrienees as they are from

meticulous and thorough research on his su jects. The songs are not particularly bad or su fer from lack of actual influential experiencp, but they seem to stretch-a bit too far at som points. 
One of the major triumphs of the album i "Postcards From Italy." Quite similar at points t the vocal fluctuations and flows of Hufu Wainwright, it is a fully developed tune of life love and death.

One of Beirut's most obvi ous strengths is his ability write lyrics that are not over 
ly involved and sprawling. Unlike many indi artists who construct songs that n~ly on vast sto ries weaved within each individual track Condon allows the words equal footing with th music. Yet he also manages the balance the tw elements of words and music so they suppor each other as individual yet superbly integrated elements of each track. This effect is best s1~en on tracks like "The Canals of Our City," "Moun Wroclai" and "Postcards From Italy." Indeed. h 
astute and measured use of each element o the song allows for the best songs to stand ou as absolute gems while letting the more aver­age ones still achieve their own power and effect in a manner that is usually only seen in the best songs on other artists' records. 
The track "Scenic World" offers perhaps the most prettily pop sound on the record. Ami the onset of horns and layered vocals, Condo sings: "I try to imagine a careless life I A sceni world where the sunsets are all breathtaking. It's a beautiful moment on a wholly beautifu record from a young man who is fast becomin one of the most magical and affecting artis making music today.

Irish big man should be even more

potential second-round matchup 
with Washington State or even 
Winthrop would be a bigger test 

for the Irish but it would also be a 
good warm-up for a contest with 
you-know-who. 
The Irish know what's at stake 
this year. They are no longer the 
wide-eyed Tournament rookies 
they admitted to being last year. 

"Wp'rn here to do a lot more than wn did last year," Harangody said. 
The Irish haven't played since their early exit from the Big East tournament. 
They're eag11r to get back to work.

"It fired me up, so next time down tho floor, I wa'i just ready to boil over and I knew next time I get the ball. I'm going to go to the rack to try to finish," llillesland said. " ... Koshwol was guarding me and I knew he wa<.;n't as quiek as I wa'i, so I gave him a little fake went baseline. help came, went to dunk it and it turned out well. Thnn, I kind of let some frustration out afterwards." 
llillesland turned to Notre Damn's bench and yelled some­thing. though nobody on the team wa'i oxaetly sure what he was say­ing as he ran down the !loor like a man possessed. 
"1 don't know what he yelled, and I don't know if it was English, quito frankly," Brey said. "And if it was, if you had a delay on it, like they do on radio shows, there would've been a lot or delays." 
Interactions like this happen occasionally between Brey and Hillelsand. 
"Zach is my high-strung child," Brey said. "So, with him, every now and then, we can light each other up a little bit. That's one of the reasons he gives us great energy." 
llillesland 's energy is one of many attributes he brings to the floor on a nightly ba<>is -the abil­ity to guard anyone on the floor, to rebound, handlfl the ball, and ev1m a little creativity on the limm­sivn end. 
"lie's a trieky player. as athletic as he is, sometimes he gets stoppnd in his dribble and he'll kind of go under the defender and hit a weird, tough shot," Irish guard Kyle McAlarney said. "That's just the way he plays and he's a lot of fun to play with and watch play." 
Hillesland does a little bit of everything, and his stats re!lect that. Ileaded into Notre Dame's NCAA Tournament first-round matchup against George Mason, I-Iillesland is averaging 6.2 points, 
5.1 rebounds, and a little over 2.4 assists per game. But Hillelsand's teammates said his biggest contri­butions can't be measured with numbers. 
'There's just so many things he does well," McAlarney said. "There are times when I'll be a lit­tle winded and I'll just be like Zach, 'Take the ball up.' He can handle the ball, he's guarding the other team's most athletic guy, rebounds, he'll come down and dunk on you. 
"He's not the best shooter, but you've got to give him a lot of credit, he's improved his mid­range game a lot and on top of that his basketlJalllQ is really high and he fil<> into our system really well." 
Hillesland and one of his best friends off the court, junior for­ward Ryan Ayers. also helped keep Notre Dame's team chem­istry intact when Hillesland took over Ayers' spot in the starting lineup before Notre Dame's game against Villanova on Jan. 26. 
"Certainly, at lirst, it was kind of an adjustment. There's a certain aspect for him of 'Oh. coach took me out of the starting lineup,' but it wasn't like a demotion or any­thing. [Coach] was just trying to shuflle it up a little bit," Hillesland said. 
After the switch, the Irish won seven of their next eight, and those initial questions Hillesland and Ayers had with the switch dis­appeared. 
"I didn't want his psyche to go down at all," Hillesland said. 

'That was my first concern. But afler the first couple of games we played pretty well it kind of faded away and it was going to work out for both of us and the team." 
In the end. the switch didn't afl'ect either's playing time signill­cantly. Ayers averaged 26 minutes in conference play while llillesland averaged 22.7, both fig­ures up slightly from non-confer­ence play, when Ayers started. 
As the Irish get ready to play George Mason in the pressure­packed atmosphere of the Tournament, they can count on Hillesland to provide them with a little laughter, especially if he's angry whnn playing FIFA on Xbox 360. 
"If he loses in a FIFA game, he blames it on thn 'stupid glitches in the game,"' McAlarney said. "He'll throw chairs, throw a little temper tantrum." 
George Mason might want to make surn llillesland wins at FIFA before he hits the floor Thursday night -beeause there's no telling what an angry Zach Hillesland is going to do.

conclusion in the series finale -the show never 
Scene & Heard
insulted its fans' intelli­gence. 
Even in a city as defmed in as black-and-white terms as Baltimore, the world of 'The Wire" painted itself in shades of gray, and that shadowy moral characterization combined with creator David Simon's unwavering commitment to presenting a realistic and gritty street-level view of his city made the show one of the best ever. 
Fans following the series wire-to-wire no doubt left the final frame feeling bittersweet. The good guys won some and lost some, as did the bad guys. In the end, while the names changed and the time slipped by, nothing really changed, and that is Simon's message. For every fall of an Avon Barksdale there's the rise of a Marlo Stanfield. For every Wee Bey Bryce you lock up, there are two Chris Partlows and Felicia "Snoop" Pearsons wait­ing to take his place. And for every Cedric Daniels who sits on the cusp of police commissioner, city politics will see to it that Stanley Valcheks get the job instead. 
As Simon said in a letter written to fans of the show and posted on hbo.com: "We tried to be enter­taining, but in no way did we want to be mistaken for entertainment. We tried to provoke, to critique and debate and rant a bit. We wanted an argument. We think a few good arguments are needed still, that there is much more to be said and it is entirely likely that there are better ideas than the ones we offered. But nothing happens unless the !expletive] is stirred." 
That's the central strand of "The Wire" in as many words -the show withheld making judg­ments or observations and simply presented things as they are on the streets and back alleys of America's inner cities. 
As far as the final episode itself, the conclusion no doubt left the audience surprised and satisfied. Fans of Stringer Bell no doubt must have felt pangs of grief upon seeing the Machiavellian drug kingpin Marlo Stanfield achieve in retirement what Bell dreamed of doing in life -leaving the street behind in favor of a clean career as a legitimate business­man. But Simon knew better than to domesticate his uber-lion into a house cat. Even with an embar­rassment of riches earned through dealing death and drugs, Stanfield couldn't resist the allure of the streets and so for him, "giving up the crown" as the king of the streets was a fate worse than death. 
Given Simon's somewhat pessimistic if not cynical views on life, fans must have felt surprised to see him spare McNulty and Freamon from prison time, leaving them with only the loss of their jobs instead of their freedom for cooking up a fake serial killer in order to do the real police work budgetary and Pulitzer Prize. 
Without a doubt, the most satisfying moment of the fmal episode was Slim Charles' point-blank say­onara to backstabbing thug Cheese. 
Watching Michael rob Marlo's mentor Vinson of his riches at shotgun point must have brought a smile to Omar fans grieving the loss of their erst­while hero. Although Michael put in work as part of a trio with cold-blooded murderers Chris Partlow and Felicia "Snoop" Pearson, just as Pearson says before Michael kills her, "[he] was never one of [them]." Watching him become his generation's ver­sion of Omar made sense -both men dealt in death, but both had a code. 
On the flip side, Omar little's death earlier in the season made little sense. The man who had a code died in an act of violence, laid low by the vicious street rat Cunard. Fans of Little no doubt took the death of the gay gunslinger hard. Watching the vir­tuous vigilante get gunned down in cold blood while purchasing a pack of his favorite Newport smokes was tough to watch, but made for poetic justice. 
Similarly, watching Duquan descend into drug abuse and homelessness was hard to watch. Of all his friends, Duquan showed the most promise dur­ing his brief time in school and the most compas­sion. 
Over the course of seasons four and five, we saw one of his friends, Namond Bryce, make it out of the self-fulfilling prophecy for black youth lhing in the drug-infested crime-and war-zone of America's inner cities. We also saw one of his friends, Randy Wagstaff, who didn't. 
We saw the rise of a promising young politician in Tommy Carcetti, only to see him fall into the muck of the politics of governance and its half-truths and storytelling even as his star continued to rise all the way to the governor's chair. 
We saw Wee Bey again, linked up with Chris Partlow in the chain-linked confines of Jessup's Prison yards. We saw two murderers, one charis­matic, one cold-blooded, both locked up for all of eternity for his crimes. 
The audience had the privilege of meeting white people, black people, gay people, straight people, gangsters with good hearts and policemen with bad ones. Most importantly, it all looked, felt, smelled, tasted and talked like the real deal. 
David Simon built the city from the street up, put all the pieces together and showed us how they work. He built a fictitious Baltimore that looks, feels and breathes like a real city. In the end, fans will remember that they were sad to say goodbye not because they didn't like how things turned out, but that they ran out of time to stay and visit his world.

FORT MYERS, Fla. ­Fans at City of Palms Park were ready for Boston's final spring training game in Florida. The Red Sox weren't. 
In an extraordinary move, Boston players voted to boycott a nation­ally televised exhibition and Wednesday after­noon's flight to Japan for next week's season-open­ing series against Oakland, upset that coaches weren't going to receive the same $40,000 payments negoti­ated for. players by their union. 
A couple of hours later, all was resolved, and the Red Sox took the field one hour late for a 4-3 loss to Toronto before a crowd of 7,868. 
Across the country in Phoenix, Athletics players also considered a boycott. They didn't take batting practice and held five team meetings before fol­lowing Boston's lead and deciding to play. An Oakland split squad lost 6­1 to the Los Angeles Angels in front of 7,940 fans before leaving for Tokyo. 
"The players just stepped up and they did what I think was right," Boston bench coach Brad Mills said. 
Major League Baseball agreed to pay the man­agers, coaches and train­ers on the trip $20,000 each from management's proceeds, a person famil­iar with the agreement said, speaking on condi­tion of anonymity because details weren't announced. The Red Sox agreed to make up the difference to make the amount equal, and to pay some of the other team personnel making the trip, the per­son said. 
"It was a misunder­standing of what agree­ment was reached between MLB and the MLBPA," Red Sox presi­dent Larry Lucchino said. "We said we would step up and make sure a second pool was created and would seek contributions from all parties." 
It had not yet been determined whether Oakland would make addi·· tional payments to its staff. 
"Everyone connected with the trip will be fairly compensated," baseball spokesman Rich Levin said. 
Cancellation of the March 25-26 series at the Tokyo Dome would have been a publicity nightmare for Major League Baseball, which already has had enough bad news during an offseason dominated bv performance-enhancing drugs. 

IN BRIEF Virginia Tech's leading
rusffer_ Ore kicked off team 
Virginia Tech running back Branden Ore, the Hokies' leading rusher in their charge toward the 2008 FedEx Orange Bowl, has been dismissed from the team. 
"During recent meetings with Branden Ore, we have decided that it would be best for Branden to pursue other opportunities," coach Frank Beamer said in a statement released by the school Wednesday. "Branden has had many great moments here at Virginia Tech, and we wish him well in the future." 
Beamer did not offer details for Ore's removal, but according to peo­ple with knowledge of the situation, the coaching staff simply grew impa­tient with Ore's lackadaisical attitude and lack of commitment to the team. The Hokies waited for Ore to mature for more than two seasons and gave up after he failed to reach what once seemed to be enormous potential. 
Yankees' Chamberlain will 
open season as reliever_ 
TAMPA, Fla. Joba Chamberlain will begin the sea­son in the New York Yankees' bullpen. 
"We think that's where he fits best right now," manager Joe Girardi said Wednesday. 
For much of spring training, Chamberlain was a contender for a spot in the starting rotation. He was a starter in college and the minors before New York switched him to a relief role last year and called him up in August to boost its shaky bullpen. 
When asked if Chamberlain would go back to the setup role he thrived in as a rookie last sea­son, Girardi refused to be specif­
ic. But he did say Chamberlain would pitch late in games. 
"l-Ie's a back-end guy. That's how I'm going to classify him," Girardi said. 
Dodaers' Garciapar_r_a out 
withoroken hand 
PHOENIX-Nomar Garciaparra has a broken bone in his right hand, and the Los Angeles Dodgers' third baseman might not be ready for Opening Day. 
Garciaparra had an MRI on Wednesday in Los Angeles that revealed a microfracture. The Dodgers do not consider the injury to be as serious as a complete fracture of a bone, and expect to know more once the 34-year-old is examined Thursday by the team's med­ical staff in Arizona. 
A two-time AL batting champion, Garciaparra was hit by a pitch March 7 and has had pain in hi<> hand ever since, making it dillicult to swing a bat. He's had two X-rays and two MRis, neither of which showed any structural damage in the area where he was struck. 
"We'll see where Nomar's at in anoth­er week or so. and in the meantime, we'll continue to see if we can figure out [a replacement] from within or outside," general manager Ned Colletti said.

Top-rated QB Pryor commits to Ohio State 

NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL 
Firstround features duel of freshman stars Beasley, Mayo 
Associated Press 
OMAHA, Neb. -Michael Beasley was standing in a nar­row hallway outside the Kansas State locker room. Suddenly, 
O.J. Mayo appeared at the end 
of the corridor. "Yo, Michael!" Mayo yelled. "Juice!" Beasley screamed 
back. 
They shook hands and embraced, these two freshman stars, both of them stopping by the NCAA tournament on their inevitable journey to the NBA. 
Don't expect things to be so cordial Thursday when Mayo's Southern California Trojans face Beasley's Kansas State Wildcats in a game oozing with star power, the kind better suited for the Final Four rather than the opening round of the tourna­ment. 
They've been friends since their early teens -unless they're on opposite teams. That's when things get serious. It doesn't matter if it's a pickup game in a deserted high school gym or a pressure-packed NCAA game in a sold-out arena. 
"I have no friends on the each other," Beasley said. court," Beasley said. "We're the same kind of guys. Mayo confirmed the intensity We like the same kind of things. of their rivalry. We pretty much clicked right

Mayo led the sixth-seeded Trojans (21-11) in scoring at 
20.8 points a game, as well as assists, steals and 3-point shoot­ing. Beasley had an even better season at Kansas State, averag­ing 26.5 points and 12.4 rebounds to contend with North Carolina's Tyler Hansbrough for player of the year honors. 
Beasley vs. Mayo. 

Now that's a matchup every­one can get excited about, even if you're on another team. 
''Mayo and Beasley, you've got to give it to them," said Darnell Jackson of top-seeded Kansas, which had its own game to play Thursday against Portland State. "The guys are great players." 
Considering their superb skills, it was inevitable Beasley and Mayo would hook up on the AAU and high school all-star cir­cuit. They met whim they were 13 or 14 and quickly hit it off. 
"After games, we got to meet

Just imagine if they both had chosen the Wildcats, and joined with Beasley to form the Fab Three. 
"We talked before we made our decisions," Walker said. "He told me that USC was best for his career, and I understood that. Kansas State was best for my career." 
USC is the higher-seeded team, but Kansas State should feel right at home. Omaha is only about a three-hour drive from the Wildcats' campus, which should ensure plenty of purple at the Qwest Center. 
Trojans coach Tim Floyd clearly is not happy with the selection committee for match­ing his team against one from a neighboring state.

JEANNETTE, Pa. -Oregon was too far away. Penn State was too rural. Michig\J,n was a close second. 
Terrelle Pryor, the highly tout­ed western Pennsylvania prep quarterback, announced Wednesday that he will play for Ohio State next season. 
The 6-foot-6, two-sport star ­flanked by his parents, two younger siblings and some of his coaches -made the announce­ment on the auditorium stage at Jeannette Senior High School near Pittsburgh, where Pryor had one of the greatest prep careers in Pennsylvania history. 
"If everyone's here," Pryor said to start the news confer­ence, "University of Ohio State." He then unzipped his wind­breaker to reveal an Ohio State T-shirt and donned an OSU hat. His parents, Craig and Thomasina, also revealed Ohio State shirts. 
Pryor, considered by many scouts to be the top-rated unsigned high school recruit in the country, said he couldn't go wrong with any of the four schools he considered. 
But he said the car trip for his family to games in Columbus, Ohio, is shorter than the flights they would have to take to Oregon. Penn State was too "countryside." And, despite a last-minute push by new Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez, Pryor decided Ohio State is best for him, even though senior Todd Boeckman is the entrenched· starter and Pryor felt he would have a chance to start as a freshman at Michigan. 
"I can learn from a senior," Pryor said. "And whenever I can get in on some plays, I can make something happen." 
Pryor said he didn't make a final choice until Wednesday morning. 
When he told Jim Tressel, the coach said, "Welcome to the family." 
As for his final call with Rodriguez: "He was still recruit­ing ·me, giving me lines," Pryor said. "Coach Rod did his job. He's gonna be a great coach; he is a great coach. He'll make stuff happen [at Michigan]." 
Pryor called a Feb. 6 news conference to announce his choice, but then said he hadn't chosen a school after all. 
Tressel said he was impressed by that, given that Pryor was trying to help his high school basketball team to a state cham­simply, ''I'm an 18-year-old kid and I feel like a man. I gotta make choices for myself." 
One person noticeably absent Wednesday was Charlie Batch, the backup Steelers quarterback and family friend who advised Pryor.

Tressel said Pryor felt like "there's a whole bunch of people that are very important in my life who think I should give this some more thought. He respect-

INDIAN WELLS, Calif'. -Hafael Nadal came back to win the f'inal f'ive games and beat .Jo-Wilfrind Tsonga on Wednesday in an intnnso, crowd-plnasing rnmatch of thoir Australian Open semif'i­nal.

After Tsonga, a hard-hitting Frnnchman. went up 5-2 in the third set. Nadal lwld serve the rest of tlw way and broke Tsonga's servE~ in tlw ninth and 11th games to take a 6-5 lead. 
With Uw cTowd beginning to cheer even as hn set up for thn shot, tho Spaniard cappnd thn rnatch by slamming an over­lwad past Tsonga.

Tsonga played brilliantly at timns in the rematch against tlw 21-year-old Nadal, but mis­takes cost him at other times. 
After ending a long rally wlwn both hit several outstand­ing shots, Tsonga ended it with a drop shot that Nadal some­how managed to hit back, then a bang-bang volley that left Nadal lying on the ground. at tlw end of the point. That brought Tsonga back from a 15-40 de!'ieit to deuce in the 11th game. but hf1 quickly fol­lowed that with a double-fault, tlwn hit a forPhand long to lose the game. 
Driving powerful forehands down the lines, Tsonga had 4 7 winners OVf~rall -but made 56 unforced ~~rrors. The far more consistent Nadal linished with 27 winners and 27 unforced errors.

Tiger looks for sixth straight 
Associated Press 
DOHAL, Fla. -There are 78 playnrs at this World Golf Championship, and one guy playing out of this world. 
Tiger Woods is winning at a rate not seen in more than a half-century. Bay llill was his sixth straight victory around the world among official tourna­ments. and he is the three-time defending champion this week at the CA Championship. 
"lie inhales so many wins that there's not mueh breathing room for the rest of us," Stnwart Cink said. 
Even a player lined up to get his autograph Wednesday. 
Boo Weekley stood behind the 18th green as Woods and Jim Furyk finished an abbreviated practice round at Dora! in 30 mph wind. He was holding two flags, from the Arnold Palmer Invitational, whieh Woods won with a 25-foot birdie on the last hole; and from the Aceenture Match Play Championship, which Woods won by a record 8-and-7 margin in the final round. 
It was for charity, although the scene spoke volumes. 
There is a sense of awe among Woods' peers during a streteh of golf that rivals Byron Nelson's golden season of 1945, wlwn he won 11 straight events and 18 out of 30. And there is determination not to let this domination continue. 

"It's a great time to be play­ing," Adam Scott said. "It's awfully hard to beat him, but he doesn't play every week. I know he's winning all the time, but hn doesn't win every week, either." 
Then the 27-year-old Australian paused long enough that he eouldn 't eontain a wry smile. 
"There's no proof of that," Scott said. "But we'll try to change it this week." 
The bookmakers don't like the chances of the other 78 guys on the Blue Monster at Dural. Woods was listed as a 2-3 favorite on orw Web site, stag­gering odds for a sport in whieh players have no control ovnr the eompntition and thn twin is only 4 1/2 inches in diameter. 
Next in line is Phil Mickelson at 15-1. 
Thnre's a reason for that. Woods has won at Dora! the last three years, the first two when it was a full-lield PGA Tour 1went. 
lin has won this World Golf Championship six of eight ynars. tho first live when it was eallnd the Amnriean Express Championship and played around the world. 

NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT 
Wildcats continue tourney streak 
Arizona to face Mountaineers in first round in 24th straight appearance 
-One streak 

opponent Thursday night in the West Regional. The Mountaineers, after all, are working on a streak of one. 
"Obviously, it's a very impressive record," Wnst Virginia center Jamie Smalligan said of Arizona's run, which began in 1985 and includes four Final Four appearances. 
A victory by the underdog Wildcats (19-14) would enable Arizona to stretch to 21 its run of successive 20-win seasons, yet another streak unmatched in men's college basketball today. 
"That would mean a lot, of course, but more than that, if we win 20 games that means we're on to the next round," guard Jawann McClellan said Wednesday. 
Although winning 20 games and reaching the NCM tour­nament has become common­plaee for Arizona, this has not been a typical year for the Wildcats. Their 14 defeats equals the most by an at-large team since 1985, and their scv­flnth-place finish in the Pac-1 0 was hardly a source of pride. 
Then again, it's hard to imagine Arizona doing mueh bntter after all it endured this season. Hall of Fame coach Lute Olson took a leave of absnnee on Nov. 4, and injuries to Jerryd Bayless and guard Nie Wisn foreed interim eoach Kevin O'Neill to scramble for depth. 
"I think it showed the char­acter of our team. how well we handled it," said Bayless, whose ailing baek no longer is an issue. 
Bneause the Wildcats endured, here they arc again in the NCAA tournamPnt. 
"It was vnry important to us. It put a lot of prnssure on us, the thought that we weren't going to make it this year," for­ward Jordan Hill said. "We've been through a lot of ups and downs, with the coaching changes and our key players being injurnd, so we just had to keep our heads up and keep lighting. Once we found out we made it, a weight lifted ofT our shoulders. Now it's time to get to business." 
Even if they had to travel across the country as a No. 10 seed. 
"We're just happy to be in the tournament," McClellan said. "Every year, with the seholarships spread out throughout the sehools, other schools are getting better. The Pac-1 0 conference is getting better. So it's not as easy just to make it to the NCAA tourna­ment now. To keep that streak alive. to knep the party going and to keep playing is a great accomplishment for us." 
West Virginia (24-1 01 is not as tournament tested as the Wildcats, but thn Mountainners ~tre eonvinced their run to the NIT championship last year will prove equally bmwlicial. 
"Winning live games back to baek and the last two on a neutral court, we've got enough nxperienee to mateh what they have," Smalligan insistnd.

The Irish leave their homn eourt for a two-mateh road trip to Texas, starting Saturday in College Station. Tex., against the Texas A&M Aggies. 
The No. 27 Aggies (8-4) nntnr the match on a two-game win streak, having mowed down Oklahoma State and Oklahoma in eonvincing fashion last week. 
The Aggies dropped just one match point over the two meet­ings, but like the No. 24 Irish, Texas A&M has been dominat­ing inferior competition of late. 
The three-game win streak Notre Dame (10-7) brings to the match comes from victories against teams boasting solid programs but not top-50 rank­ings. 
Texas A&M poses the tough­est tnst for the Irish sinee their Mareh 1 5-2 loss to Georgia Tech. the nation's c:urrent No. 2 team. 
The Aggies' attack is led by Elze Potginter, ranked as the No. 76 singles player in the eountry. Tlw sophomore from South Afriea does not have an impressive record but faeed six straight ranked opponents to start the s<mson. 
She went 2-4 over the streteh highlighted by a win over then­No. 11 M(~lanie Gloria of Fresno State. 
Though the Aggies have no other ranked single players or any ranked doubles pairs, they hold the home-court advantage and have lost just once in four home matches for the dual sea­son. 
Notre Dame's streak has been a result of solid team play up and down the lineup, and the impressive play by the Irish is being nationally recognized. 
Senior Brook Buck and junior Kelcy Tefft remained in the top spot or the national doubles rankings this week while the sophomore combo of Colleen Hielley and Cosmina Ciobanu entered the poll at No. 50. 
Hiclley and Ciobanu are an impressive 11-1 for the dual season as a doubles pair and have won four consecutive matches. 
On the singles side, Tefft moved up one spot to No. 38, and sophomore Kali Krisik remained in the rankings at No. 
114. Ciobanu joined Tefft and Krisik in the rankings this week at No. 105 to give the strong Notre Dame singles attack three nationally ranked play­ers. 
Going on thn road against a ranked opponent gives the Irish a chance to improve on some apparent weaknessns with respeet to their performance so far. 
Though three games over .500 for the dual season, the Irish are sub-.500 on the road at just 3-4. Some of the strug­gles ean be attributed to their 1-3 rerord on a three-game road-trip to start the ynar against all ranked opponents. but thn trip to College Station of'f'ers a chanee for the Irish to even their road rncord. 
As the NCAA Tournament inelws onto the horizon, tlw Irish will have to start playing bettnr against their toughPr competition. Though they beat teams like llawaii and Western Michigan the way thny should have, the Irish are just 2-6 against nationally ranked teams thus far. 
Notre Dame looks to improve upon that this Saturday. First serve is scheduled for 1:30 p.m. at the Mitchell Tennis Center.

Walk-on ways 
Hegardless of the fact that her unr.le coaches here, Tsipis had other options when choosing when'l to play. In her senior year at Perry lligh School in Perry, Ohio, she seored 18.2 points per game, shot 50.2-percent from li(dd goal range and hit 43.1­percent of her 3-point shots. She set school records in field goal and 3-point percentage, both for her senior sea­son and for her Devreaux Peters and Becca Bruszewski out because of injuries and two guards in foul trouble. But, McGraw said, her biggest contribution is intangi­ble. 
"She is somebody who has great contributions to the team that don't really show up any­where except in the harmony and chemistry of your team," McGraw said. "She's somebody that when she talks, everybody listens, because they know she's just all about the team. It's never about her." 
Although every athlete wants to play, Jonathan Tsipis said Amanda understood her role on the team and adapted to it well.

ller performance in high school earned her scholarship oll'ers from DePauw, Akron and Ohio University, and she toyed with the idea of walking on at Hichmond. But after attnnding a camp at Notre Dame the sum­mer befon~ her senior high school season, Irish coach MuiTet McGraw told her she would have a spot on the team if she got into Notre Dame. 
When the call came in May, 

McGraw was true to her word. 
"She called and said, 'I just got accepted to Notre Dame, I got an offer to play at DePauw. Should I go there, are you tak­ing a walk-on, and do I have a chance at being that walk-on?"' McGraw said. "And I said absolutPiy. I thought it was one of the best deeisions I ever made to keep her." 
Because of the n~spect she's earned from her teammates, Tsipis said she has never bem1 treated differently, despite her status as a walk-on. 
"I think because I'm the only lwalk-onl. and because our tl~am is so small, we have a really dose group," she said. "They have never treated me like anyonp, p,Jse. I kind of feel likP-I have their responsibility and own that to them to make them as good as I can." 
Family ties 
Tsipis, who played for her father, Dean, growing up, is no stranger to playing for family members. She said the relation­ship with her unele has worked well, both on the court and oil'. 
"It's niefl to have a relation­ship and have it outside of bas­ketball, and he also doesn't let me got away with taking a play off or not practieing as hard as I can," she said. 
Jonathan Tsipis said he tries to keep their relationship oil' the eourt. 
"We try to separate it, and III really try to be her coach in practice and in games and everything basketball-related," he said. "She's jus~ another player on the team." 
Although she doesn't see much playing time, Tsipis' main contributions come in practice. Because she has a good outside shot, she simulates their next opponent's shooters. She explains new schemes to younger players. And Jonathan Tsipis said he feels comfortable putting her in with the four starters, which happened in the first half of the South Florida game with freshmen forwards teammates." 
So much respect, 
in fact, that in the last game of 
this season against St. John's, 
senior guard Charel Allen, who 
is traditionally announced last 
before the game, requested that 
Tsipis be announced last in her 
first career start. 
"I've been starting since last 
year, and I felt that the fans 
would appreciate more if she 
camp, out," Allen said. 
When Tsipis enters a game, 
the Joyce Center faithful go 
bonkers. 
"It's pretty amazing," she said. 
"It's kind of sad that I'll never 
come in again at the JACC. They 
have been amazingly supportive 
since freshman year." 
Outside of basketball, Tsipis keeps up the grades that got her here. She was a three-time Big East Aeademie All-Star and had a 3.7 GPA last year. 
"It's not unusual for us to be 
at a hotel somewhere and for 
me to see her out in the hallway 
studying," McGraw said. "She's 
the first one to get her books out 
on the plane or on the bus. She 
never wastes time. 
"She is a very, very conscien­tious student. As good as grades as she gets, she's always wor­ried she didn't do well-which means she got a B." 
Moving on 
That academic prowess earned Tsipis an internship with JP Morgan in Chicago last sum­mer. which led to a permanent job with the company after she graduates. 
Her uncle, however, knows she's not done with basketball. 
"Deep inside I think she knows basketball will be a part of her, whether it's coaching younger kids some day," Jonathan Tsipis said. "She's ready to kind of step on [to] that next level, as far as graduating and working at JP Morgan, but she'll end up being some part of basketball, no question about that."' 
Regardless of Tsipis' role, McGraw said, Tsipis plays because she's incurably attached to basketball. 
"To think that for four years she has put in so much time, before the season, after the sea­son, in the summer, and she never gets rewarded," McGraw said. "Other players are playing so they can get on the court and play, and she's just playing for the love of the game. She's just so thrilled to be in the game, and it's infectious to the rest of the team."

just try and be a leader all 
around." 
Gaines never questioned her role as the vocal leader of the team. She willingly stepped into the role as soon as fellow point guard Megan Duffy graduated, and never looked back. 
It has never been about the points for Gaines, who averages just 7.0 per game. It's always been about bringing out the best in her teammates to ensure a win. 
"She is the motivator, the inspiration. She is the voice you hear in the locker room at half­time a lot of times saying the things I'm about to say," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. "She's the consummate team player -she doesn't care how many points she scores, she just . wants the team to win." 
As the other member of the duo, Allen's ability to remain composed under stress has earned her the respect of her teammates, and that rarely required Allen to speak up. 
Allen, who leads the Irish with 
14.5 points per game, has always been a silent but strong presence on the court. 
"I've always been like the quiet type, lead by example," Allen said. "It's hard to be more vocal but it's something new. 
"Every once in a while, I'll say something. I think [my team­mates] do [respect me when I speak up] just because they know I don't like talking. They respect Tulyah in the same sense because she talks all the time, but I think when I say some­thing, they're like 'it's serious."' 
The teammates have proven that silent power and vocal lead­ership match each other perfect­ly. 
Both guards have been playing together since the day they stepped foot on campus in the summer of 2004 and always 
seem to know where the other 
will be on the court. 
"Tulyah [Gaines! especially as a point guard really looks for Charel [Allen]," McGraw said. "They seem to know where each other is going to be. Offensively and defensively they seem to know eaeh other's moves." 
But it's more than just four years of playing together that puts the two in sync, it's also a close friendship that exists off the court. 
"It's a combination of [years playing together and friend­ship]," said Gaines of the two's connection. ''I'm always looking for her, I know where she is usu­ally, and just for playing with her for four years has helped that." 
Gaines and Allen know their leadership has yet to be fully tested. Entering the first round of the NCAA Tournament, the underclassmen are likely to look to the two who have been down the road before. 
The Irish entered the 2007 tournament only to fall 60-51 to then top-seeded North Carolina. But this year's squad is stronger, and Allen and Gaines don't want to end their collegiate careers in the second round. 
"That shows you that last year we weren't even as good as we are now," said Allen of last year's tournament. "This year we played with the No. 1 team and the No. 1 seed. This year we can compete with whoever in the nation. Since I've been here we've only been to the second round. We want to at least get to the Sweet 16, that's our goal. We're going to approach it like this could be my last game. I don't want to end on that note." 
The underclassmen will turn to Allen and Gaines for the expe­rience the two have in the tour­nament -they know how it can test all aspects of a team, men­tally and physically. 
"We just [have to] be tough, the post-season is always just a battle of toughness basically," Gaines said. "All the teams in the tournament are good, so its for workouts, getting her mental­ly prepared, when you come in as a freshman you don't really know," D'Amico said of rooming with Williamson. "Physically, you're going to have to push yourself a lot. She had a little trouble with conditioning, and she worked very hard to get that up. She's improved a lot. I'm proud of her." 

McGraw said that D'Amico's work with the younger players shows maturity especially consid­ering she is helping tutor the players that took her minutes. 
"It's great that you want to see someone else do well when you're not playing. It shows a lot of maturity, but it's got to be real­ly hard. I definitely have a lot of respect for her," McGraw said. 
D'Amico said Notre Dame was one of her first choices to play college basketball, but that it was an opportunity she almost didn't get. 
"The first thing I got [from Notre Dame] was a rejection let­ter. Not [really! a r~jection letter, but it's really hard to get in here, things like that," she said. 
Later, D'Amico played well at an Adidas top 10 all-American camp and started getting an increased look from McGraw. 
"I think when I called her and told her I was coming she was really excited. I talked to Coach IMcGraw]," D'Amico said of sign­ing day. "They put [former Irish center! Ruth Hiley on the phone, she was someone that I watchnd a lot, so it was exdting."

in the quarterfinals of thP-Big 
East Tournament. 
But the Irish recognize they are in one of the toughest leagues in the country. 
"The Big East conference is tough -look how far Louisville went," Alhm said. "They went into the championship game, and we beat them Iearlier in the season]. It shows you how com­petitive the Big East is. 
"Hopefully, we're done losing. We'll put together a little six­game winning streak. We're capable of doing it." 
It's that driving attitude that has gotten Notre Dame to the No. 5 seed they sit at today. Combined with Gaines' vocal encouragement and leadership on the court, the Irish players have an infallible force in the backcourt. 
"She's a fighter, she's competi­tive, she will not back down from anybody, and I think her attitude kind of goes to the rest of the team," McGraw said of Allen. "That fearlessness kind of' takes us into battle. It's really amazing what she's accom­plished." 
As for when that last buzzer sounds for the duo's fmal battle on the Irish side, neither plans to travel too far from their current role. 
Gaines and Allen will both look to play basketball post-Notre Dame, regardless of what that entails. 
"Hopefully I'll still be playing somewhere," said Gaines of life after Notre Dame. ''I'm going to try to keep playing. Whatever God has for me I'm going to try to get to it."

Irish to fight for tournament lives in Detroit 
Notre Dame faces No. 3 Miami in CCHA semifinals; leading scorer Condra out for year with injured left knee 
By SAM WERNER 
Sports Writer 
Whnn No. 12 Notrn Dame enters Detroit's Joe Louis Arena this weekend, it will have the opportunity to dnfend its Mason Cup title, beginning with tonight's CCIIA semifinal matchup with No. 3 Miami. 
But it won't have the opportu­nity to do so at full strength. 
The Irish will be without jun­ior right wing Erik Condra, tlwir leading scorer who injun"ld his lef't krwe in Sunday's 2-1 win over Ferris State. 

"Any time you lose a player of that caliber, it's going to impact your team," coach Jeff Jackson said. "But it's also an opportuni­ty for other guys to step up in dil'f'ernnt roles." 
Condra had scored 15 goals and 23 assists this season and had played prominently on Notre Dame's penalty kill and power play units. Jackson said he had tried several different line combinations to make up for Condra's loss but wouldn't make any final decisions until after Thursday's practice in Dntroit. 
Notre Dame split the season series with the Hedl-lawks, win­ning 2-1 and falling 3-1 in Oxford, Ohio, when Miami was the nation's top team. The Rediiawks are led by goalie Jef'f' Zatkoff, the CCHA leader in save percentage and goals­against average in the regular season. The junior is one of the leading candidates for the Hobey Baker Award, given annually to the nation's top hockey player. 
"They may be the No. 1 team in the country," Jackson said. "They're not ranked No. 1 right now, but they're right there with the top couple of teams." 
On offense, Hedllawks junior Justin Mercier and senior Hyan Jones make up one of the most potent scoring duos in the CCHA. The pair has combined for 85 points on the season. 
"(Miami isJ so deep, they're so talented," Irish senior captain Mark Van Guilder said. "You can't take a shift off or you're down 1-0 or 2-0." 
The Irish hope to use their CCHA tournament experience against the Hedllawks. The Irish beat Lake Superior State and Michigan last year to hoist the Mason Cup, and Jackson said the players returning from that squad will benefit from winning it all. 
"The fact that the guys that were there last' year had that experience, I'm sure it's going to help them," Jackson said. 
This year's team will be faced with a very different challenge, though. Last year, the Irish were seeded No. 1 in the tour­nament and were favorites to win the title. This year, Notre Dame is tho No. 3 seed and the third-highest seeded team in the final four -ahead of only Northern Michigan, the No. 6

Walk-on Tsipis earns respect of teammates, leaves lasting mark 
By BILL BRINK 
Sporrs Writer 
It was a meaningless basket in a meaningless game, but it was vindication for countless hours of behind-the-scenes toil. 
It was inconspicuous, at best. Notre Dame led South Florida H4-39 in the final minutes of a Feb. 27 home game. With 3:52 left. senior guard Amanda Tsipis drove through the lane from the outside and sank a layup. The crowd roared: Tsipis 
beamed. But here's the rub: She did­n't want the shot. 
"I was actually looking to pass to !senior center! Mei[issa 0'Amico I. but her defender didn't actually come up on me, so I ended up shooting it," Tsipis said. 
That lack of selfishness at a meaningless point in the game tells you all you need to know about Amanda Tsipis. 
The only walk-on ever to be elected captain by her team­mates, Tsipis has one start in her !'our-year collegiate career. Shn has 1 H points this smtson, or 0.9 per game. Yet with the ball and a lane to the basket, she wanted to pass. 
Her fellow players and 

coaches wouldn't be sur­prised. They learned from their daily interactions with Tsipis the impact she can have away from the court. 
"She's exactly what a walk­on epitomizes at Notre Dame," said assistant coaeh Jonathan Tsipis. who is 
Amanda's  unele.  "We  seP  
with  our  ehemistry in  our  
locker  room  without  the  

eoaches around a lot of tlw positive impad that she's had." 
Notre Dame's Sunday match-up with Southnrn Mnthodist in thn NCAA TournamPnt could bn Tsipis' last in an Irish uniform. But the impression shP made on
