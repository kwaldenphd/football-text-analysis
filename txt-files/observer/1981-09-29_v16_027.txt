Johnson, who is executive director of Deaconess Hospital at Evansville, spoke at tht' end of a three-day national seminar on cancer care at the Hyatt Rt'gency-lndianapolis on Sunday.

Program gives chance to ND-SMC students 
By MARGARET HANK 
NeusStaff 
Neighborhood Roots, a program 
designed to orient Notre Dame and 
Saint Mary's students to the South 
Bend area and acquaint them to the 
various community services, will 
take place Oct. H from .:j p.m. to H 
p.m. 
The program involves a tour 
through both urban and central-city 
neighborhoods. It will take the stu­
dents through a cross:section of 
areas. showing a variety of st·veral 
diffc~ent neighborhoods and ethnic 
groups. 
Following the tour there will be 
an authentic llungarian meal served 
at South Bend's <)ur Lady of Hungary 
Church. The evening will conclude 
with a session of discussions about 
the tour to provide students with a 
chance to become involved in the 
volunteer programs offered in either 
the ND-SMC or South Bend com­
munities. 
Several volunteer faculty mem­bers, such as Mary Ann Roemer, John Roos, Thomas Broden and T.R. Swartz, as well as a student task force, have aided in rn·stablishing tht: program, not offered last p:ar. However, because of the interest shown in the previous years. the program is being revitalized, and as Ms. Roemer commented. "living in South Bend I care about my com­
munity and I think that if the stu­dents get involved in Roots it will be easier for them to care too." 
Neighborhood Roots is sponsored 
by the Notre Dame Student Govern­ment, The Institute for Urban Studies, The Center for Experiential Learning and several academic departments. 
Tickets for the evening will go on sale Thursday in the north and south dining halls, as well as in the LaFortune Student Center. 
Farley roof victim to downpour 
Last Saturday the roof of Farley Hall was covered with approximate­ly five inches of water, caused by blocked drains on the hall's rooting. Once the drains were cleaned, the water receeded. 
Sister Jeanne Lcnz, Farley Hall 
rectress, said that the main concern 
was that the water was coming in 
around electrical equipment such as 
the elevator and ceiling lights. The 
actual damage in dollars has not yet 
been estimated but reportedly 
several ceiling tiles will need to be 
replaced. 
When checking on the level of water on the roof of Farley on Sun­day, Sister Jeanne also observed a build up of water on the roof of the North Dining Hall. S!1e reported it to authorities who promised to c.:orrcct the situation. 
,O'Donnell will judge the rooms. Tht· winning hall will receive enough German chocolate cake for all resi­dents. 
There will be a band tent featuring live German musk besides the tradi­tional beer garden at Saint Mary's on Thursday. Saint Mary's Student Ac­tivities Programming Board will sell taffy apples, knockwurst, hot prct· zels, soft drinks and strudel. "The band tent offers something new taking emphasis away from the beer garden," stated Susan Murphy, chair­man of the event. "It's-for students who wish to participate in the ac­tivities but who arc not 21 yet." 
Radio station WRBR, co­sponsored by SAPB and SMC Senior Class, will provide music in the beer garden. Both tents .~~oill open at 8 
p.m. and will be located behind An­gela Athletic Facility. 
Orders for daisies and Oktobcr­fest mugs will be taken during dinnn through Thursday at all dining halls. Daisies arc fit. 50 for a bunch of ten and will be delivered for 25 cents extra. The 16 oz. mugs are designed with the Lowenbrau lion and will sell for 11.3. 50. Students may purchase mugs at Senior Bar tomorrow and at the beer garden on Thursday.

Hell's Angels shot, stuffed in auto 
ASHEBORO, N.C. (AP) -Two men executed gangland style and Muffed in a car trunk were identified 
yesterday as Hells Angels, one oftwo motorcycle gangs that are blamed by authorities for a recent crime wave in the Carolinas. 
Authorities found the bodies late Saturday after a resident reported blood was dripping from the trunk of a car parked on a gravel road in rural Randolph County. 
Charlotte police identified the victims as Michael '"Thunder" Finaz­zo, 40, president of the Hells Angels in Charlotte, and Tyler Duris "Yank" Frndak, about 30, a gang member. Both men had been shot at close range and Finazzo also had a broken leg, authorities said. 
Authorities believe both were shot elsewhere Thursday with a 9mm pistol. 
Detective Lt. Don Andrews of the Randolph County Sheriff's Depart­ment. noting Finazzo's broken leg, speculated that "they did some talking before they died." 
The shootings followed by several weeks an investigative report by The Charlotte Observer that the Hells Angels and rival Outlaws motor­cycle gangs are r~onsible for crime and violence extending across North Carolina and South Carolina. 
The Observer quoteo from a report by the Federal Bureau of Al­cohol, Tobacco and Firearms that said Finazzo was a member of the Filthy Few, a group ofabout 'iO Hells

Angels who have killed in the presence ofother members. 
The Obsen,er also said Finazzo was a major source of weapons for the gang. 
Finazzo was shot in the head three times and Frndak was shot once. Finazzo was wrapped from his waist to his head in clear plastic. Frndak's head was wrapped in plastic. 
Capt. Lee Bumgarner said authori· ties believe the killers meant to dump the bodies '"but got spooked and left the car." 
Bumgarner said autopsy reports indicated that both men were kneel­ing when they were shot. 
The car is registered to Finazzo's girlfriend, police said.· The woman and at least one other person were being questioned about the deaths. 
Authorities have declined to spec­ulate on whether the slayings are linked to an apparent two-year feud between the Hells Angels and the Outlaws. Police estimate that the Helb Angels have about 50 mem­hers in the Carolinas while the Out­laws have about 20. 
Several people have been killed or wounded in the feud, which police say may be .a struggle to control the massage parlor and prostitution trade in the Charlotte area. 
The Charlotte Observer's series on 
motorcycle gangs said police in the 
two states suspect members of the 
two gangs in at least I 5 slayings 
since July 4. 1979, when three Out­
laws and two associates were found 
shot to death in their Charlotte club­
house. 



U.S. -Soviet talks continue at U.N. 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) Secretary ofState Alexander M. Haig Jr. and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko met yesterday for the second time in a week to dis­cuss prospects for reducing tensions 
between the two superpowers. 

Wearing gray suits and sitting in a red couch, appeared in a relaxed mood as the talks got underway at the Soviet Mission to the United Na­tions. Both men joked that they ex­pected a lon·g session. 
The meeting began shortly after 2 
p.m. EDT, was expected to last at least four hours, U.S. officials said. 
U.S. official said they hoped Haig and Gromyko could make progress toward defining the scope ofnuclear arms talks scheduled to begin in Geneva on Nov. 30. 
They agreed at their first meeting on Wednesday to hold the talks, but did not specify what weapons would be covered. 
A U.S. official. who did not want to be identified, indicated the first meeting was primarily an oppor­tunity for each side to determine first-hand the positions of the other on the issues. 
He said the second meeting would determine whether any progress could be made in easing tensions. 
The United States wants the initial focus to be on medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe. The Soviet Union now has about 180 . missiles targeted on Europe, and the United States plans to begin deploy· 
ing  'i72  cruise  and  Pershing  II  
missiles beginning in 1983.  
The  Soviet  Union  is  known  to  

favor a broader scope for the talks to include U.S. nuclear-armed aircraft in Europe. 
The Haig-Gromyko talks arc the highest-level meetings to date be­tween the Reagan administration and the Soviet leadership.

Mexico's future 

Jameson, Goulet cite progress 
By MARK ROLFES 
Neus Staff 
Latin American week hegan yes­tenlay with thl· presentation "Mexican Development Future" hy Notre Dame professors Kenneth Jameson and Dennis Goulet. who hoth spl·nt thl' summer in Mexico. They discussed the prohlems Mexico has experienced as a result of that country's recent growth and progress. 
Thl' dehate in Mexico, according to jameson and Goulet, is over where the country should go in its continuing development programs and progress. Mexico has had in­creased industrial production and large economic growth over the past decade, much of that is due to large oil deposits discovered in recent years. The .\1exican economic system, however, still has problems. 
There are many inequities in ,\1exican distribution of wealth. The men explained that the bottom 60 percent of the population recieves I 0 percent of the income while the top S percent recieves 30 percent of the income. Due to this inequity, 
Miners may protest to preserve programs 
KINGSPORT. Tenn. (AP} -A llnitnl Mine Workers of America spokesman said yesterday the 160,000-memher union may con­sider walking off the joh to preserve the fnkral mine safety program and other henefits. 
The union is lobbying against hudget cuts and proposals it fears would reduce eligibility for hlack lung benefits and strip the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration of its tel·th. Arnell Church said. 
"Iflohhying doesn't work. then ul­timately we have to make a decision as a lahor organization: do we work under unsafe mmmg condi­tions?... Do we walk?" Church said. "This is thl· key week." 
Arnell Church, an official in the IIMW press office, is no relation to Sam Church, president of the liMW. 
The liMW is fighting proposals in Congn·ss to reduce the numher of inspections of surface and deep mines hy federal coal mine inspec­tors. 
"We fought too hard and too long as a lahor organization to now have the Rl·agan administration turn us hack SO years and return the mines to the dangerous conditions we OIH.'l' worked under." Church said. 
"Wl· passed the word to the Rl·agan peopk to kel·p hands off the hlal·k lung program," said Church, who was here preparing for a this morning's ncws confcrcnce. 
"This is not a giveaway program...This is an occupational disel.~l· program mandated hy Congrl·ss." 
Church said President Rl·agan didn't say in his hudget message last week that the administration was coming after the black lung program. 
I k said topit's of the ncws con­l(:rencc will he the union's response to threats to hlack lung and safety programs as wdl as tht: l1 M\X' orgamzmg effort at non-union Paramont Coal Co. in Virginia. 
Paramont. a major non-union coal company located ncar Norton, Va., has fought a rcct:nt union organizing drive.

AL offers English to students 
The College of Arts and Letters, with the support of the Office of Ad­vanced Studies, is offering a course in "English as a Second Language" for foreign students at the Univer­sity. The class is meeting on Tues­days and Thursdays from 7-8:30 p.m. in I07 O'Shaugnessy.

impoundt:d hy the National Labor Relations Board after the lJM W filed unfair lahor practice charges against Paramont. 
Louis D'Amico, acting regional director ofthe NLRB, said the ballots will be counted Thursday and both sides will have five working days to file complaints. 
But D'Amico said it would he some time hcfore the election is settled and it is known whether the union will represent the Paramont workt·rs or not. 
Paramont officials said the union filed the charges to hold up the elec­tion results hecausc they knew tht: vote rejectt:d the union. 
according to jameson and Goulet, Mexican leaders are reluctant to make any sweeping reforms and are content to deal with immediate prohlems instead of searching for long range solutions. 
Another problem in Mexico is the gap in agriculture. Half of the agriculture is high technology, ex­port oriented agriculture. The other half is suhsistence farming, the weak spot in Mexican development, according to ProfessorJameson. The growth in agricultural production is not keeping up with the growth in population, thereby increasing the amount of food Mexico must im­port. The U.S. sold S2.S billion in food last year to Mexico. 
Dependence on the United States is another great problem which Professor Goulet stressed. The Mexican economy is very depend­ent on trade with the U.S., which is involved in two.thirds ofall Mexican foreign trade. The U.S. also owns 60 percent of all foreign investment in Mexico, which wishes to diversify its foreign trade and become less de­pendent on its northern neighhor. 
The final problem stressed by jameson and Goulet is the need for a sharper. definition of the Mexican national identity. Fifty-four different languages are spoken in Mexico and all government attempts to assim­ilate the languages have failed. Other Mexican problems arc unemploy­ment, the overurhanization of Mexico City and the growing dominance and control that oil money has in the Mexican economy. 

Weinberger defends sale to Saudi Arabia 
WASHINGTON (AP) The Unitt:d States could control Saudi Arabia's usc of A WACS radar planes for several years even without for­
mal  restrictions,  Secretary  of  
Defense  Caspar  Weinhergcr  said  
yesterday.  

Defending the administration:s proposal to sell five of the planes to the Mideast oil power, Weinhcrger said the Saudis would need help with training and maintenance for nearly a decade to keep the planes flying. 
Gen. David Jones, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said such rdianct: on U.S. tt:chnical help would continut: "well into the 
1990's." At another point, jones said, "Wt: will he involved as far as we can see in the future." 
Jones con<.Tded under question· ing from members of the Senatl' Armed Services Committee that once tht: planes arc delivt:rt:d, the Saudi Arahian govcrment "could tell the Americans to get lost." 
But he said "it would he fool­hardy for them" to do that. ht:cause they would need Amt:rican advice and training to keep the planes in tht: air. 
If the Saudis used the AWACS against Israt:l and tht: United Statt:s pulled out its support, jones said. 
"there would be rapid deteriora­
tion" of their ability to kt:t:p them 
flying. 
Tht: AWACS planes are primarily 
designed for early detection of 
enemy warplanes, hut critics of the 
sale say putting them in Saudi hands 
would tilt the halance of military in 
the Middle East in favor of Arab na­
tions, and place Israel at a disad­
vantage. 
The testimony offered hy Weinherger and jones was the first formal defense of the sale hefore Congrt:ss and came as it was becom­ing apparent efforts to find a com· promise dt:signed to overcome overv.·helming Senate resistance to the salt: was unraveling. 
The Washington Post reported from Saudi Arabia that the oil­producing nation's lt:adcrs would refuse a proposal that Amt:ricans he permitted to fly ahoard the plant:s even after tht: Saudi Air Force is capahlt: ofpiloting them. 
More than 60 memhcrs of tht: 
Senate have indicated opposition to 
the S8.S hill ion sale, which includes 
Sidewinder missiles and equipment 
dt:signed to providt: greater range to 
F-1 S fighter planes tht: Saudis haVl' 
already purchased. 
If<; I Senators vote against the sale 
it will he hlockt:d.

Haden! 

Los Angeles Ram quarterback Pat Haden completed 13 of 29 passes for 210 yards, leading the Rams to a resounding 24-7 victory over the Chicago Bears last night at Soldier Field in Chicago. The Rams are now 2-2, while the Bears dropped to 1-]. ( AP Photo)

Rams clobber Bears, 24 -7 
CHICAGO (AP) -LeRoy Irvin returned a punt 55 yards for a touch­down, and Wendell Tyler scored twice on short runs last night to lead the Los Angeles Rams to a 24-7 Na­tional Football League victory over the Chicago Bears in a nationally televised game. 
It was the second straight victory for the Rams, who hiked their record to 2-2, while the Bears, who lost quarterback Vince Evans and wide receiver Rickey Watts in the first half because ofinjuries, slumped to 1-3. 
Irvin's punt retur!J was the first for a touchdown by the Rams in 20 years. Dick Bass last returned one 90 yards against Green Bay in 1961. 
The Rams took charge the first 
time they gained possession and 
marched 71 yards in five plays for a 
touchdown. Pat Haden, who com­
pleted 13-of-29 passes for 21 0 yards, 
started with a five-yard pass to Tyler, 
hit Willie Miller for 19 and Billy 
Waddy for 44 before Tyler scored 
from the two-yard line. 

Another Rams march of 89 yards 
fizzled on the Chicago six, and Frank 
Corral booted a 24-yard field goal 
early in the second quarter which 
stood for a 10·0 halftime lead. · 
Early in the third quarter, the Bears were forced to punt and Irvin fielded the ball at his own 45-yard line, went to his right, cut back up the middle and raced into the end zone with 9:46 left in the period. 
Midway in the final period, the 
Rams scored again. The touchdown 
was set up when Ruben Henderson 
was called for pass interference 
against Jeff Moore, giving the Rams 
the ball at the Bears one. Tyler then 
went around right end for the score. 
The Bears averted a shutout when 
they marched 80 yards for a score in 
the fourth quarter, capping the drive 
on a 14-yard pass from third-string 
quarterback Mike Phipps to Dave 
Williams. 

The Bears' problems were com­
pounded as Walter Payton managed 
only 45 yards on 17 carries. Payton 
also fumbled the ball away twice. 

Evans had completed only one 
pass in eight attempts for three yards 
before being knocked out of the 
game with a bruised shoulder. He 
was replaced by Bob Avellini in the 
second quarter. 

Under Avellini's guidance and on 
the running of Payton and Matt Suhey, the Bears marched from their own 35 to the Los Angeles 27. Avel­lini then hit Watts with a 27-yard touchdown pass, but the play was called back because of a motion penalty against tight end Robin Earl. 
Avellini was making his first ap­pearance in a regular season game since Nov. 22, 1979. He was inter· cepted once and replaced by Phipps in the fourth quarter. 
The Rams defense limited the Bears to a total of84 yards in the first half, 60 on the ground. Ram defen· ders sacked Bears quarterbacks six 
times for 40 lost yards in the game. 
Tyler spearheaded the Rams' ground attack and gained 68 yards in 17 carries. 
Early in the fourth quarter, Haden completed a 19-yard pass to Henry Childs, who then fumbled. Len Wal­terscheid recovered at midfield. Payton ran for a first down to the Rams 39, but two plays later Payton fumbled and Johnnie Johnson, who stripped him of the ball, recovered on the Rams 38. The Rams failed to get a first down, but Corral unloaded a 67-yard punt that sent the Bears back to their own 10.  
Evansville to host 1983 basketball regional 
EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) -The 1983 NCAA mideast Regional bas­ketball tournament will be played at Evansville's Roberts Stadium, but it may cost the city a high school tournament which it has hosted for 25 years. 
Mayor Michael Vandeveer made the final decision to host the Nation­al Collegiate Athletic Association event after meeting with university and high school officials. 
The NCAA demanded exclusive use of the 11,000-seat stadium for the entire period of March 17-20 before allowing Evansville to have the tournament. But the facility was also scheduled for the state high school semistate tournament on March 19. 
The NCAA threatened to move its 
tournament elsewhere. 

Various factions in the com­munity argued the point for several weeks. Some cited the city's long relationship with the high school tournament while others noted the 
S5 million the college tournament is expected to generate for the local economy. 
Vaneer who had the final decision 
on the matter because Roberts 
Stadium is municipally owned, held 
several meetings with Ward Brown, 
commissioner of the Indiana High 
School Athletic Association. 

Those meetings were also atended by Dr. Wallace B. Graves, president of the University of Evansville, the host school. 
"Our main question was: Would the IHSAA feel any animosity toward us if we brought in the NCAA tour­ney?" Vandeveer said. "We wanted co make sure (Brown) understood Evansville has had a strong feeling for the state tournament for years and we didn't want to injure the relationship between the city and the IHSAA." 
Dav Cawood, a spokesman for the NCAA, said as long as the stadium is reserved for the regional tourna­ment's exclusive use, Evansville has the tournament. 
But high school athletic officials could give no such assurnces to city officials that the semistate would return in 1984. Vandeveer said he was confident that the city's long relationship with the tournent would be a deciding factor. 
High school athletic officials must now search for a new site for the 1983 semistate. There are only two facilities south oflndianapolis which seat more than I0,000. 
Indiana University officials, who boast Assembly Hall in Bloomington, have reportedly been seeking to host the high school tournament for some time. Indiana State University also has Hulman Center in Terre Haute to offer.

''I'm a type: of runna who likes to hit tht· hoks as fast a~ possible: ami to takt· on any tat:kkr." Smith c:xplain~. "My !>izt· rc:ally hc:lps whc:n it t:omc:s to gc:tting those: tou~h yards inside:." 
lntc:n:stingly enough, Smith is also a Cincinnati product who~c: high ~chool acc.:omplishmt·nt~ earned him just a c.:oupk of post season honors. Actually. he was a consensu~ prep all-American with mc:ntions from Parade. Adltlas/Scholastic Coach, Coach and Atblete, to men­tion a kw. while winning thn:e let· tc:r~ at LaSalk as a runnin~ back and a lint·backa. With thost· {ind of ac­colades, he had the op nrtunity to choose hc:tween a number of ~chools. Ironically, one of the: schoob that compc:ted with Notre Dame: for hi!. time: was Purdue:. 
"Purdut· was one of the: schools that I really looked at," Smith says, "so the coachc:s told me that if I workc:d hard and earnc:d thc.-chann· that I would gc:t a shot at playing against thc:m. I just wish things could haVl· turned out hc.-ttt·r." 
Brooks' background isn't much different, a~ he: gathered in almost t·very conccivable post-sc:a~on honor imaginable. The publit:ity that accompanies him at Notre Dame has bc.-c:n hard to avoid, hut Blac.:hc: dears any qut·stion as to how the frt·shman 
is handling it. 
"It's surprising to sec how casygo­

ii1g and patient he has been." says 
Blachc:. "Ht· has taken everything 
vc:ry well, and hc.-has pulled for all 
the other guys throughout thc.-fall. 
Alll can say is that they an· both fine: 
young mt·n who havc.-a bright futurc.­
hc:re." 
Although these two· young men may bt· a lillie disillusioned after two consc:cutivc.-defeats, they can probably look forward to bc:tter days for the: Irish. After all, thc:y thc:m­sc:lves can directly influence more favorablt· outcomes for a long time to come.

ter scorinK the game-tying goal in Notre Dame's Ertelt) 
Kahale-Irish: aperfect match 
By RICK KRIST 
Sports Writer 
The Irish soccer team is off to a fine start this season with a 7-0-2 record. One reason for its early success is senior co-captain and starting center forward Sami Kahale. 
Kahale's personal statistics at Notre Dame have been impressive. 
.-He currently ranks second on the all­time scoring list at Notre Dame with 30 goals and 22 assists, including a team-leading seven goals and seven assists this season. However, Kahale is more concerned with the success of the team than his personal statis­tics. "Sami is an extremely unselfish player," comments coach Rich Hun­ter. "All week long, he has been working on his passing game. He's al­ways working for the benefit of the team, rather than trying to gain per­sonal statistics." Senior defenseman and co-captain jim Stein agrees. "In my mind, Sami is the most valuable player on the team. He is very unselfish and has been a stable influence on the-other >-players. He could score more goals if he wanted to, but instead he works on setting up other people." Although he has had a successful soccer career at Notre Dame, Kahale, who hails from Rome, Italy, came to Notre Dame with the intent ofplaying tennis. As a matter offact, he did not even know that Notre Dame had a varsity soccer team. In high school, he lettered four times in tennis and led his team to undefeated seasons and the Italian regional championship each time. He in basketball. also lettered twice in basketball. He did not play soccer until his senior year, a year in which he was selected to the Italian regional all-star team. , This year, Kahale, who is majoring in electrical engineering, is assum­ing the role of coach on the field. "We've always felt our center for­ward should be a team leader," com­ments Hunter. "Last year, it was Kevin Lovejoy. This year, Sami is taking over the role on offense, and our other captain, Jim Stein, on defense." In the past, Hunter has employed a system offrequent substitutions at the forward position. However, this year, Kahale has proven he can handle more playing time, and is usually on the field for almost the full 90 minutes. Thus far, he has logged more playing time than any  other forward. 
After graduation, Kahale -who players. We've shown that, even lived in Cairo, Egypt for three years without scholarship players, we can before moving to Rome -plans to compete with the best of the NCAA. work for a year or two and then pos­I feel we're just a few key players

Freshmen Smith, Brooks silence critics 
By MICHAEL OLENIK 
Sports Writer 
WEST !.AFAVETTE, Ind. Despite the numerous negative im­plications of that difficult defeat just three days ago, there are indeed some reasons for continued op­timism. Two of the most exciting reasons to believe Gerry Faust will silence his early critics are the per· 

formances of freshmen running backs Chris Smith and Mark Brooks. 
Much to the surprise of even the most liberal Notre Dame followers , the numbers of each were called in the Irish huddle before the end of the first half And not to the surprise of Notre Dame backfield Ccoach Greg Blache, both Brooks and Smith handled the situation with a most impressive flair. 
"Each of them played very well against LSU and we wanted to give them another good opportunity to prove themselves," says Blache. "We planned on using them relatively early against Purdue because we knew that they could withstand the very physical type of defense that Purdue plays." 
"Withstand" is somewhat of an understatement, considering the game stats. Operating during the height of action, Smith and Brooks each contributed substantially to Notre Dame's first touchdown, with 

Smith finally diving over from the one-yard line to garner his initial col­legiate score. During that 7I-yard drive, Smith picked up another I6 yards, and Brooks snatched a key pass from Tim Koegel to keep the drive alive. 
For the record, Smith rushed for 50 of Notre Dame's 160 rushing yards, and Brooks snagged two passes for 17 yards. Fullback Brooks seemed satisfied with his two recep­tions fro t m a position that traditional­ly asks him to block and run. 
"I really think that you have to be diversified, and I luckily have no problems with either running or catching the ball," Brooks says. "I was kind of surprised to hear my number called on those pl.ays. but you know that I was happy to try to get the job done." 
Blache echoes Brooks' senti­ments: "Mark is a very mature and talented kid who learns well and can do anything any ofour fullbacks can do. A lot of those type of plays are dictated by the situation, and we had no problem going with Mark." 
Although Blache allows that the hype that followed Brooks seems warranted so far, he is quick to point out that Chris Smith has opened many knowledgeable .eyes very wide in a short period of time. 
"Chris has picked up our offense extremely well," Blache notes. "Mark has an added advantage being from Moeller, but Chris is learning fast how to use his good size to his advantage. He definitely has got a certain talent from the tailback posi­tion, and we feel that he will even­tually be a great bacj(." 
Smith seems to have adjusted well to the teaching of his coach, and his enthusiasm for football is not easily

No. 2 team, Columbia, hung in at that position after a sparkling 28-I3 loss to Lafayette. It was the lions' I Oth loss in a row, and they helped their own cause by tur­ning the bali over to the Leopards seven times. 
The Tigers ofPrinceton vaulted from out ofnowhere after their 6I-8 beating by Delaware. Penn is the third Ivy League team in the top four. After a disappointing win on opening day, they came back to drop a razor­close, last-second game to Lehigh, 58-0. 
For the first time in the history of The Bottom Ten, we have respectability. People now take us seriously. A big name has endorsed us. Notre Dame joined the ranks of the inept with a I4-I 5 loss at Purdue. Look what Frank Sinatra did for Chrysler, what Carol Channing did for her plummer, what Ethel Merman did for Mailgrarns, and Digger Phelps did for Syracuse. 
Here's this week's poll: 
1) Northwestern (0-3) -Do Charlton Heston and McLean Stevenson have eligibility left? 
2) Columbia (0-2) -Loss to Lafayette worse than losing heat tiles. 
3) Princeton (0-2) -Have you ever seen a Blue Hen? 
4) Penn (1-1) -Ran out ofink against Lehigh. 
5) Tulsa (0-4)-Leads the nation in losses. 
6) Air Force (0-3) -Got bombed. 
7) Stanford (0-3) -"Come on guys, can't we start over?"
