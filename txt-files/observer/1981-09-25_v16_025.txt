A change for the worse? 

In a front-page story last .\londay. I be ()/Jseruer reported that The Notre Dame Senior-Alumni dub (more t(mdly known as "Senior Bar") is bc.:ing targc.:ted t(Jr some major structural and manage.: rial changes. 
At tlrst glance, any report of improv~:mcnts to the cramped qu'-!rll.:rs at Senior Bar would certainlv be wdcomed. The c.:stablishment has for too long be~n far down the list of pending campus improvement projects. Therefore, everyone should welcome the decision to hJrge ahead on upgrading the t;tcilities at Senior Bar. 
But let's not rush into thb project wo quickly. There are some points in our news story that are Lause for concern. 
The plan now being studied by the ofikers ofthe l'ni­versity apparently revolves around two basic changes in the current operation: an entirdy new structure to be erened on the.: site of the present Senior Bar. which will presumably be demolishc.:d: and the imtitution ofa year-round business schedule which will be adminis­ternl by a full-time manager. 
To the die-hard traditionalist, these(\\ o changes may be alarming in their scope Indeed, the changes have been the topic of considerable discussion among stu­dents especially up­
-----------------·'<, 
~ot only do the student managers add a special down-to-earth t1avor to the Bar which is not found in the dingy, dark tipping estahlbhments further up Fddy Street, but the managerial experience gained each year by the members of the Senior Bar management team is an educational tool that no amount of business cour~es and lectures otkred by the l'nivcrsity could replace. 
The l 'niversity arguc.:s. however. that in order to a~sure that the Bar would consistently be able to pay back its construction loan for a new building. the annual re-shuffling ofstudent managers, and the re~ulting inef· tkiencies, must end. A full-time manager's task would be to increase Bar prot1ts from an ;tpproximate average of S';.OOO annually over the past tive years, to a ~early nl'! income figure in the range of S·!O.OOO. 
Once again, it is agreed that starting up a new sllldent manager~ team each spring does re~ult in some possible waste and ineft1ciency due 
perclassmen -in the past to inexperience at thl· job. kw weeks. but if you take away the 
First, although Dean of roles of the Mudent Studt·nb James Roemer managers and the student described the Bar as ''too old stat{ what is left to differen­and too small to mec.:t the tial~· the Senior-Alumni Club needs of its patrons," many from any other bar in the students and alumni \\:ill fed t1n·-points arl-a~ remorse if the ntrrent build­Therd(Jre care must be ing b demolished. taken to assure that the Thousands of memories -"­Senior-Alumni cbaracter of good and bad -have been Sc.:nior Bar is preserved. One made within the walls of the possibility is to hire a recent old house, and many will :-.lotre Dame graduate as the miss it t(Jr its unique (is that full-time manager. rather the word~) atmosphc.:rc than contracting with an which can give at its best outside tirm specializing moments a literal kc.:ling of entirely in b;tr managc.:ment 

being at home. 

' It is agrc.:ed, however, that structural changes are imperative. Some thought had hc.:cn given to the idt·a of radically remodling the cur­rent bar and add to the.: structure, but in the final analysis. I believe.: the.: current plan for an l'ntirdy new structure is the wiser course. especially in view of the fact that drastic renovations to the current structure would also change its atmospht·re -and only tem­porarily hide the fact that thl' Senior Bar buildiAg was not designed and constructc.:d to serve.: as anything else but a mnlium-sizl·d residence.:. For the past seven years. the structure has simply been pushed ludicrously t;tr beyond the use t(Jr which it was intended. 
Thl· othn consideration has perhaps even more far­reaching implications. That is. what will be the nature of the Senior-Alumni ClufJ if a prokssional full-time.: manager is hired~ The current student manager posi­tions arc. at least in my mind. an inseparable facet ofthe Senior Bar philosophy: an establishment run hy the stu­dents and alumni (nr students and alumni.

Tht·ological scholaMidsm, a theoretical basis for integration of education and t;lith, faltered <IS a reason for Catholic identity. There was a basic loss of contidcncc within the Catholic community regarding the value of a Catholic educl!ion. To remain a Catholic university the eduacational 
standing must be uphdd as well as kt-eping the distinct Catholic character. Gleason said. 
Yoder tlisageed, believing that the Catholic identity problem began during the 16th century. Because of the European Catholic expericnct· ofbeing always without a true home, Catholics in America wanted to make sure that no such thing would happen to them. In doing so, they became ultra-patriotic anti dcvdopcd a new sense of Cat­holicism that included patriotism. 
Lyons in turn commentnl upon each speaker's statements, pointing out some weaknesses and strt·ngths and adding some claritkation. 
Three forums will he conducted each semester. Nlany topics were suggested t!Jr discussion including the condition of women at Notre Dame, compatibility ofathletics and acade1nics. revisions in the tenure system, nuclear weoponry, moral at­titudes and Catholics in pluralist society. 
The next tiJrum is Oct. 2'Jth at noon in the Library Lounge anti will conclude the topic of the Catholic identity. The tim11n is aimed at faculty members, hut as .\1r. Vacca pointed out, "No one has locked the doors."

Arm.enians seize consulate 
PARIS ( ap) Anti-terrorist police ~urrounded the Turkish Con· sulate in the center of Parb yester­day after a t(Jur-man Armenian suicide squad ~eiled some 40 hostages, threatened to kill them and blow up the mission unless their demands were met. authorities said. 
Ambulance~ took three people from the consulate several hours af­ter the siege began. One was reported b}' french radio to be a Turkish security guard killed in the takeover. Police said the· others were a wounded Turkish vice con­sul and a wounded terrorist who demanded political asylum. 
The commandos demanded Turkey free jaih:d Armenian politi­cal prisoners and tly them to france by I I p.m. ( 'i p.m. EDT). They said if the demand was nor met all the hostages "will be executed," and that if French forces intervened, the building "and all the people inside" will be blown up. 
A Turkish Embassy spokesman said about I') staff members and 2'i vbitors, including several women, remained hostage in the consulate. Police evacuated nearby buildings. 
The Turkish government in Ankara said France was responsible tiJr obtaining the hostages' quick and sak release and that Turkcv would not negotiate with the terrorist;, in the eight-story building on Boulevard 1-laussman, a few blocks from the Champs Elysees ysees in the fashionable Hth Disi'rict. 
The terrorbts. in messages dropped from the bui!Jing and a statement distributed in Beirut, identified themselves as ··suicide commandos" of the Armenian Secret Arm~· I(Jr the Liberation of Ar­menia. 
In addition to lrn.-dom t(Jr Ar­
menian  political  prisoners  in  
Turh;ish  jails,  they  demanded  tht:

In Search of Transcendence 
Naomi Feinstein 
Webster tkfines transcendence as ''that which surpasses; reality through ~piritual intuition." Yet this dctlnition is vague at best. Transcen­dence is different things to different people. For many at Notre Dame, it seems that transcendence is easily accessible in the form of football games. happy hours and late nights at Corby's. But for some, transcen­
dence is not that easy to find and the consequent search can be a lonely, complicated one. In my recent quest for transcendence, I gained 40 pounds, more than a few enemies and some valuable insight. It all began junior year.... 
As a more or less permanent fixture at most social events, when I returned for fall semester, I was automatically immersed in the hap­py h<;ur, formal bathroom, toga, hat­and-tic, come-as-your-favorite-dead-person party circuit. Sandwiched between these social events were worthwhile, resume-type activities: The Observer, WSND, and others too numerous to mention. In short, I was the stereotypical Domer ideal of l renaissance person. I knew all people and did all things. I should have been happy. 
Instead, I was miserable. Some·

I tried to explain my feelings to

tcr genre, I had a love affair. With chocolate. And with cookies and icc cream and peanut M&Ms. I drowned my sorrows in chocolate Koo Koos and Hostess Twinkies. I did find what I thought might be transcen­dence in blueberry cheescake 
milkshakes, but found out later -20 pounds later-that I was sadly mis­taken. 
After two weeks of this orgiastic 
quest, I had not found transcen­
dence. I had found more depression, 
more alienation and a m:w social 
status. I went from social butterfly to 
social pariah. I began to panic 
Three weeks' time found me sit­
ting in a third floor office of the Infir­
mary. Across from me sat a 
complacent "doctor." He listened patiently as I tried to explain my sud­den revulsion at Flanner bathroom parties and other related amenities. I told him I was confused and depressed and had sought transcen­dence in chocolate Koo Koos, but had found none. I rattled on for a good half hour, then asked for his opinion of my case. (There was 
unhealthy after eating all that junk, that, I don't know, I just had to cat something healthy. So I ate ten granola bars and passed out." 
The good doctor then suggested that I forget about a diet and allow myselfone "forbidden food" a week, which was absurd. For as every foodaholk knows, there is no such thing as one oatmeal cookie or one chocolate cupcake. One oatmeal cookie leads to ten more oatmeal cookies, etc (One hard-boiled egg, however, docs not lead to a dozen more hard-boiled eggs, which means there is hope f(Jr foodaholks. ) 
Anyway, none of my Freudian friend's suggestions worked. I gained twenty more pounds in no time at all, and I had still not found transcendence. The kind doctor then informed me that my affinity for blueberry cheesecake milkshakcs betrayed strong masoc­histic tendencies. On that note, we said our good-byes. 
At that point, I became quite desperate. I read The Bell jar and 

something distinctly Freudian about this man, hut I could not put my fin­ger on it until he finally spoke.) 
"!lave you ever had an orgasm?" he asked, as if in answer to my re­quest Next question, please.

"And how did you like the Berne theory on transactional analysis?" he asked, looking very Freud-like. 
"Oh, I tinmd it fascinating," I gu~hed. "There was just one problem.... " 
"Yes?" he asked, leaning tiJrward. 
"Well, the section on the child ego-state got me to thinking of my own childhood, which reminded me of these tcrritk oatmeal cookies my mother used to make. All of a sud­den, I had this tremendous craving 
tiJr one, so I ate a box of twelve. It's funny, though, lately oatmeal cookies just don't taste the same un­less I have a blueberry cheesecake mildshakc to go along with thl·m.

relax to strains of "Funeral fiJr a Friend" as I waited f(Jr death to sweep me away. As I pondered when I might carry out this endeavor (before or after my quiz in American Writers Survey). the phone rang. 
"Hello?" "Hello. \-lay I speak to Naomi Feinstein? This is Dennis Boyd." 
Allow me to digress tiJr a moment here.

Boyd was always on the periphery of things, a social misfit, if you will. But he was a deep thinker and had some good ideas, if you could tolerate his obnoxious per­sonality. Our conversation con­tinued.... 
"This is Naomi," I said, hesitantly. 
"Feinstein," he said. "You know, I've always thought you were a su­pcrtkial hitch. Running around to every party, playing stupid, a real tease. But supertkial hitches arc relatively harmless. Anvway, I saw

I was extremely tempted to hang up on Boyd. But I figured that, if I were nice to him, it might favorably affect my status in th~ afterlife. 
"Listen Boyd," I said, "I can't find transcendence here at Notre Dame, and I'm en route to the afterlife, so if you don't mind...." 
"Transcendence?" he interrupted. "There's only one place to find it." "Really?" I said. "Where? Wait ­don't tell me. Senior Bar." 
"Far from it." he said. "The only 
place to find transcendence is on the 
Cross Bronx Expressway." 
"Really?" I said. "That's about the 

only place I haven't looked." 
Boyd and I discussed the meta· 

physical implications of this 
phenomenon: if transcendence can 
be found on the Cross Bronx, might 
it not be possible to transport some 
of that transcendence to Notre 
Dame? After all, Boyd said, (an<.I 1 agreed with him), the Cross Bronx is transcendent enough, especially at rush hour. I began to think... maybe I should forego my journey to the af­terlife and make a pilgrimage to the Cross Bronx instead. It would cost a bit more, but if I found transcen­dence it might be worth it.... 
"Feinstein," Boyd said, changing the subject. "Arc you a manic­depressive?" 
"No, I'm not,"! answered, but my shrink tells me I'm a masochist." 
This admission opened all kinds of 
discussion. Boyd and I talked tiJr 
hours, trading notes on my masoc­
histic tendencies and his manic­
depressive behavior. We discovered 
that we had a lot in common. Boyd 
and I actually became friends. In 
fact, Boyd graduated, went back 
East, and we're still friends. And I

Back in 1978 

PUplayers remembet: beating Moeller 
By KEVIN McMAHON 
Senior Sports Writer Purdue Exponent 
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. -Both Larry Gates and Ken Weber have a lot ofrespect for Notre Dame and Gerry Faust. Gates, as a former pupil, and Weber as a former opponent, feel that the rookie coach is destined to succeed in college football's toughest job. 
Gates, Purdue's backup quarterback, played for Faust at Moeller. Gates has fond memories of his prep years and Faust. 
"He was around for a long time at Moeller, and he built a very successful program there," Gates says. "He's a really good ·coach, and he knows his stuff." 
During Gates' first three years at Moeller, the Crusaders were undefeated in the regular season and Ohio state champions each year. But in 1978 Moeller was defeated early in the year by the eventual state champion from Cin· cinnati Princeton High School. And Ken Weber, a junior industrial engineering major at Purdue, sealed that lone defeat. 

"That year everybody said that would be the big game of the year -whoever won would go on to the states," Weber recalls. "There was a lot oftalk before the game, and a lot ofcontroversy." 
It was the second game of the season, and by halftime Princeton had raced to a I 0-0 lead. But Moeller came out of the locker room in· spired for the third quarter, and scored two touchdowns, the first a long bomb from Gates to Tony Hunter, now at Notre Dame. Faust, looking for the win, opted to try for a two­point conversion after each ofthe touch­
downs -but both were unsuccessful. · With arch-rival Moeler leading, 12-10 late 
in the fourth quarter, Weber recalls the thrill· 
ing outcome ofthe game. 
"Itgot down to a·minute-and-a-halfleft, and 
Moeller was on our 40. They were goingto 
punt. But the snap was muffed and we 
recovered. 

"We marched down to the 21 and with :13 
left, I kicked a 37-yard field goal to win it, t3· 
12." 

That was a dark day in Moeller football his­tory -Faust's only loss In his last six years of high school football. It also was his latest defeat before the 25-7 trouncing at Michigan last weekend. 
"That game was really something," Gates says shaking his head. "Our only loss-and by one point." 
Even though the two scho{lls were bitter rivals, Weber has a lot ofpraise for Faust. 
"He's a helluva coach," says Weber, who might have made Purdue's team if not for an ankle injury. "I've never known a guy who was that much involved in coaching.Just watchin9 him on the sidelines Is amazing. He puts every effort into it." 
Gates says he's excited about tomorrow's game, partly because ofthe reunion it will spawn. "It will definitely be special going against my old coach and all my old buddies who play for Notre Dame now. I really would love to start that game." 
And ho.w will Faust do at Notre Dame? 
"I think he'll do alright," the former pupil says. "He's got a big winning tradition behind him at Moeller, and I think he'll establish his own at Notre Dame."

Key matchup: 
Koegel vs. secondary 
By SKIP DESJARDIN 
AssistantSports Editor 
Notre Dame has abandoned its policy of alternating quarterbacks. The responsibility has fallen squarely on the shoulders ofsenior Tim Koegel. 
That may sooth the minds ofsome, but it has to worry Koegel a little. This week he will run the Irish offense, and throw into the teeth ofwhat many have called the best secondary in the Big Ten. 
Tim Seneffand Marcus McKinnie arc begin­ning their third year together as starters in the Boiler backfield. After that much time, a couple ofguys learn each other's moves pret­ty well. Because they have a feel for where the other man is, they can afford to take that little extra step, the extra risk that can mean the dif­ference between a touchdown pass and an in­terception. 
For these two, it has happened often. 

In 1979 at Ross-Ade Stadium, the Irish were 
on their way to a 28-221oss to Purdue. With 
the game tied, 7-7, Notre Dame faced a tough 
third down situation at the Irish 17-yard line. 
Tim Koegel was the quarterback, filling in for 
the injured Rusty Lisch in the second game t of 
the season for the Irish. Koegel spotted Hun­
ter out past the 40, and threw. 
Marcus McKinnie stepped in front of 'Koegel's pass and intercepted it at the 44-yard 
line. By the time he was brought down, the 
Boilers had the ball on the Notre Dame eight. 
Three plays later they scored, and Notre 
Dame never could regain the lead. 
In 1980, Phil Carter and the Irish offense 
seemed unstoppable in a nationally televised 
game against Purdue. The sole bright spot for 
the Boilermaker defense was Tim Seneff. He 
led all tacklers with 17. 
This definitely will be a tough assignment 
for Koegel, who'll be starting only his second 
game. He is 16-for-29 going into this game. At 
55 percent, he has a very respectable comple­
tion record. But now he is facing what may be 
the toughest secondary the Irish will match 
up against all season. 
"I'm glad to be getting a chance to establish 
myself," he says. "We have a long way to go to 
bounce back from last week's game, but I 
know we can do it. 
"Sure, the Purdue secondary is tough. We 
are going to have to pick our spots. You have 
to be alert when you face two guys as tough as 
Seneffand McKinnie. I learned that two years 
ago." 
The coaches sec the matchup as key, as 
well. 
"They have two great quarterbacks," says 
Purdue Coach jim Young, "and our guys have 
to be prepared for both. They arc a hard­
running, physical outfit with everything to be 
a great football ·team. This is one of the top 
teams in the country, you can't take anything 
away from them." 
Faust has abandoned his rotation schedule,' 
but says both quarterbacks will see action 
nonetheless. 
"Timmy and Blair (Kid) arc both throwing 
the ball well," he says. "but things just didn't 
work well at Michigan. What we are going to 
do now is stick with one quarterback as long 
as he is moving the team. Ifthings get bogged down, we'll make a change. 


The Purdue defense hopes to control weeks ago. Purdu~ beat Stanford that day, Tim Koegel tomorrow as well as they con­27-19. (APPhoto) tained Stanford's jim Elway (7) two 
"We still have two starting quarterbacks, but we arc going to stick with the player with the hot hand for longer periods of time. 
"Both men will have a tough time with Purdue's secondary. They are among the best in the country. It's a talented bunch with a lot ofexperience, and they are able to do a lot of different things against you." 
Seneff and McKinnie have teamed up for some ofPurdue's biggest plays this season. With nine seconds to go in the season opener with Stanford, Seneff came out of nowhere to knock down what looked like a sure touch­down that would have won the game for the Cardinals. Earlier in that game, McKinnie dropped Stanford's all-America quarterback john Elway for an 18-yard loss, and left the Cardinals with a long third down situation on their own four-yard line. 
Both men are tough against the run a~ well. Each has caused an opponent fumble this year with hard-hitting tackles. 
"All the conditioning we had in preseason helped there," says McKinnie, a speedster 
who has been clocked at 4.6 for the 40-yard 
dash. "We arc really in shape. That showed, 
especially against Stanford, but against Min­
nesota, too. I really wasn't that tired after the 
game. We didn't allow Minnesota to score any 'points in the second half, so we were ready 
physically." 

Seneffplayed his high school ball just down 
the road from Notre Dame at Merrillville. He 
led his team to the state championship his 
senior year, and was named the outstanding 
Hooskr high school player that year. He's an 
academic all-American, majoring in electrical 
engineering. 
McKinnie, a physical education major, was 
an honorable mention all-American in high 
school in his native Barberton, Ohio. 
Both·men arc headed toward more ac­
colades when their senior season comes to an 
end this year. But, more immediately, they arc 
headed for a showdown with Koegel and his 
receiving corps. 
Extra incentive for Hoosier Dave Duerson 
By DAVE IRWIN 
Sports Writer 
Dave Duerson's big chance came two years 
ago in Purdue's 28-22 victory over Notre 
Dame. He made good then, and hasn't stopped 
since. 
"It was exactly 2:12 left in the game when I got in," Duerson recalls vividly. "In that time I made the only tackle for loss, and I put (Jim) Macon (Purdue's starting fullback) out ofthe game." 
After the Purdue game Duerson started against Michigan State and ended up starting seven ofthe nine games he played in due to in­juries to former Irish great Dave Waymer and current teammate and all-America candidate John Krimm. He totaled more minutes than any other Irish freshman in 1979. 
This week it is the Boilermakers again ­
minus the NCAA's all-time leading passer, 
Mark Herrmann, but with a rising star in Scott 
Cambell. But for Duerson it doesn't matter 
who the passer is for Purdue. It's just the fact 
that it is Purdue. 
"I've always had a special liking for Notre Dame and a dislike for Purdue," says Duerson, a native of Muncie, Ind. "Everybody from Muncie eith~r likes Ball State or Indiana. 
"Playing Purdue means something a little extra," Duerson continues. "A lot of Purdue's players are from Carmel and they're in the same conference we were. Carmel always went to the playoffs and we didn't. Beating 
Purdue is like putting a double-wammy on them. That's the best way to put it." 
Duerson thinks the Irish defense will be up to the task ofholding yet another great Purdue passer in check. 
"They are going to have to throw because of the type ofdefense we have," Duerson says. "I don't think the Michigan game was typical of 
the type ofdefense we have. I think the LSU game was more like it." The Irish defense has given up an average of 
318.5 yards a game, but just 82 yards pergame through the air, ranking the Irish secondary lOth on the latest NCAA stats list. 
Also hailing from Muncie Northside was yet another Irish all-American defensive back, Luther Bradley. Bradley, you may recall, once welcomed USC's all-America wide receiver Lynn Swann to the staduim with a crushing hit that had enough impact to knock offSwann's helmet. 
"Everywhere you heard his name (Bradley's) you heard mine," Duerson recalls. "But now it is more with Stacey (Toran)since he plays the corner." 
Cornerback is where Duerson broke in with the Irish, but in the last seven games of the 1980 campaign he wa'i switched to Steve Cichy's vacated strong safety job. 
"Strong safety is more like a lincbacking job," the 6-3, 200-poundcr says. "The strong safety's job is to make the adjusting calls. He can become a linebacker or a defensive back. At the corner you get contact, but at the strong safety you get more than your share of the contact." 
Duerson has come a long way from his days 
when he was a Scholastic Coach prep All­
America selection at"Northiside where the 
secondary played typical man-to-man 
coverage. 
"In making the calls I have to understand 
what's going on," Duerson says. "I have to 
have total confidence in what I'm doing. It's 
pretty well become second-nature." 
And wide receivers, who in turn under­stand the game, arc what makes Duerson's job even tougher than trying to stay with the world-class sprinters and assorted other jack­rabbits who play wide receiver. 

"(Anthony) Carter gives us more fits than any other receiver," Duerson explair.s. "He understands defenses and thats what makes the difference between great receivers like him and Tony Hunter, and good receivers." 
Besides being a stalwart ofthe Irish secon­dary, Duerson is also one ofthe nation's top kick returners averaging 10.9 yards per return during his first two years. 

Since the Purdue game two years ago, Dave Duerson has shown that whatever he does for the Irish, he docs well. Opposing quarter­backs should find that out as well in the next two years.

ND Managers: 'UnsUng heroes' play a key role 
By DAVE IRWIN 
Sports Writer 
Coaches and players get all the attention while the men who are "the straw that stirs the drink" (as Reggie Jackson would say) go unpuhlicized. They arc the student managers. Their job isn't glamorous, but if isn't done, things bog down. 
"The higher ups make a lot ofbig important 
decisions, hut there arc a lot ofdetails, too," 
junior manager Tony Scott says. "If we can 
take care ofthose details, hopefully every­
thing will be that much more successful. 
"It's hard to guagc (how successful they arc)," Scott continues. "There is no won-loss column, but you can tell." 
The football managers, who arc also rcspon­sihlc for the I 3 other men's varsity sports, set up before practice, work during It, and put things away after it. On the side, they have to make sure the itinerary goes smoothly on road trips, game films an: filed away so they arc available when the coaches need them, head phones arc working during the games, stran­gers arc kept out ofpractice, game uniforms arc complete, and ...well you gt·t the idea. 
That game prep (as the managers call it)can be a dreaded thing. On the day before the home games the sophomores arc required to paint the fabled metallic gold of the Notre Dame helmets. 
Because ofhead coach Gerry Faust's deci­sion to dress 121 players for the opening game, the managers were at work painting the helmets from 6 p.m. Friday until 7 a.m. Satur­day -not to mention making sure all the shoulder pads, thigh pads and knee pads arc in one piece and in the right place. 
It didn't bother Scott, however. "As long as they come out with the same results," Scott says. "Its O.K. with me." 
Not everybody is in on all this "fun." Every year in the fall there is a meeting for those in­terested in becoming a student manager. Usually 50-75 freshman express interest and those who stick out the year arc rewarded with manager's jackets. 
During the sophomore year, the 
prospective managers work football and bas­
ketball and receive football tickets and free 
books. After the sophomore year, the top 14 
are kept on for the final two years. 
As juniors, the managers work just football 
and receive a manager's blazer, a letter jacket, .make at least one road trip a'nd are invited to a bowl game (something it looks like the Irish will be doing with a great deal of regularity). After the junior year the managers arc ranked 
by ability. 

The top man receives a full tuition scholar­
ship, the next five a 75 percent tuition break 
and the final eight a 65 percent tuition reduc­
tion. The top three are in charge offootball, 
two more arc responsible for basketball, and 
one each for the remaining sports. 
This yearJohn Smith is the top man, 
followed by ChrisJohns, who works the per­
sonnel end, and Ed Fullmer, who's the equip­
ment manager. 

Johns for one doesn't think that working as 
a manager is the "picking up towels" type of job as some may think. "The coaches depend on you a lot, but you really don't get all the crummy jobs,"Johns says. "But ifthe coaches need something you have to go do it." Ex-head coach Dan Devine, for instance, repeatedly sent managers after milk shakes. 
The personality ofthe new head coach im­presses everyone who meets him -including the managers. "He makes a point ofcom­plimenting us," Johns says. "He never hesitates in telling us when we do a good job. But he expects us to get the job done. That's what we arc here for. 
"He ~ivcs us a sense of relaxation which 
makes it more exciting. He makes us feel like a 
part ofthe team, w6hich makes us give more." 
It's people like Faust who make the dif­ferene. It's not the tickets, tuition, letter jacket' or manager's jacket that keeps the student manager going. "That's is the best part ofthe whoI~ thing -the people," Johns says.

In other sport~. they tinker with the rules in dc~pera­uon to llll'fea~e till' scoring. emphasize the allack. You got I O-man baseball in one league w take the pitchn out ofthe battt·r'~ box In football. oft't·nsin· lint·men can do t·n·n·thing shun of pulling a knik tu ""P the ddensin· chargl·.

One of the Yirtucs of reh·ing on ddcn'l' i'. it makes 
\!lU lll'L'cssarih· more couragcou~. There is an dement 
ofthe bull\ in the guy who sets out to beat nJur head in 
quickly. Frequently. he is not nTn equipped for a long 
hard struggle. The Germans \\'l'fe licked as soon as thev 
had to dig trenches. The ddensive t1ghtn. on the othn

patient. 
Patient won tht· tight t(>r Sugar Ray Leonard \\'nlne~­da\ night as much his right cross. Thomas !learns is an obliterator. \\hen his blitzkrl'ig LtilnL he proved moderatl'h adept at gelling out of trouble. but. ul­timatch. he got impatient again. 
JimmY \ld.arnin ,,·as a great wl'lterwcight of the past who began his ctreer as a superior boxer. then di,l'O\'t'fing he had a dcYastating punch. he remodeled his stdt·. began to knock people out in the tlrst round. Then ht· ran into a Bill\· Pnrolle and a BarneY Ross who nertraliznl his big-punch offense. And he went back to being a crafty boxer and prolonged his career. 
Tonlln\· Hearns might do this. Tommy !karns was a hit-and-run tighter in his amatnir days. lk bricth tried to go bac·k to it Wednesday night in the middle rounds. But. it's nor like roller-skating. You can tiJrgct the nuances. 
The sad realitY is. all\way. no one would pony up S I 'i million to stT two light-bag artists go at it. Sugar Ray Leonard needs a I lit .\tan in that other corner to sdl. I k nenls a Roberto Duran fresh out of a tree limb in a Central American jungle. Even the real Sugar Ray needed the l.a\lottas. 1\asilios and Fullnu-r~ w sell tick­ets in Peoria. Ali needed the Listons. Fraziers and Forcmans. But. ht· could turn a parish priest into Jack the Rippn with his pre-tight propaganda. Bt·ctu,e. he knew what he had to do. 
If the Hit \Ian now becomes the Dance \I an. he ma\· htrc better against Sugar Ray. But 10 milli()n people \H>n't be around to watch it. 
\lai'IK· boxing has to do what footbalL ba~l'hall and en·n basketball had to do -lind some \\a\· to hobbk the dcknsl'..\lavbe thn·'ll have to outlaw thl' zonl' lkknsc. make them pia\· man-to-man.

nati Rc:ds have anothc:r concern along with waging a pc:nnant race ­losing their All-Star shortstop and two starting outfielders. 
The: Reds reccivc:d a jolt Wednc:s­day whc:n Dave Concepcion rc:jected a guaranteed contract offer of S4. 'i million for five years -the largc:st and first such guarantc:c:d of­fer in the club's history. 
And the: shortstop broke: off nc:gotiations until after the: Novc:m­bc:r free agent re-entry tlraft,. whkh also is likely to involve outfleldc:rs Ken Griffey and Dave Collins. 
In another uncharacteristic move, Rc:ds Prc:sidc:nt Dick Wagner opc:nly discussc:d details of the failc:d negotiations, which ended after three days of meetings in San Diego. 
"I think wc:'vc: shown! mir dc:sirc: to get David signed. I just would remain hopeful that David would· reconsider and re t main in Cincin­nati,:' Wagner said. 
The 33-year-old shortstop is having one of his most productive years offtnsively. Coming off dhow surgtry to his right arm, Conctpcion ranks nc:ar tht top in tht National League in hitting and runs battttl in. Concepcion said tht Rtds wasttd chance to sign him tarlier this yc:ar. 
"I'm kind ~f disappointed," Con­cepcion said. "I want to stay if I can get what's on the table. If they (Reds) would havt put it ( $4.5 mil­lion) on tht table in April, I would havt signed it. I guess they gambkd, but thty waited too long." 
Wagner said Conct~pcion and agtnt jtrry Kapstein wanted cithtr an additional $630,000, or a list of unusual guarantees in the contract. 


Kapstein proposc:d that Concep­cion gtt paid in c:very circumstance -whik on strike. suspended, or evtn in jail -exctpt suicide, according to Wagner. 
Kapstein also wanted a no-trade clause, even though Concc:pcion has tn1mgh years of sc:rvice with tht Ikds to veto a trade, Wagner said. 
"Our offc:r included the same lan­guagt that jerry Kapstc:in has usc:tl in at least four contracts in the last year," Wagnc:r said. "What was givtn us was just not an acceptable thing for any ballclub. 
"The only thing that would havt bec:n txcluded in thdr (guarantet) rc:quest would have bc:en the matter of suicide. No club in good con­scienct can do that." 
The Reds could retain rights to negotiate with Conctpcion after the free agtnt draft, an option the club has not txercised with other Cincin­nati frtt agtnts. 
"We will talk afttr tht draft if Cin­cinnati wants to," Concepcion said. "I don't want to ktep on talking (now). I can't conctntratt on tht game. I don't look likt tht samt player I was a wtek ago." 
Griffty and Collins, through an agtnt, also havt indicattd they will

damtntal mistakes. You let a ttam likt that get rolling, and they're hard to stop. It's a snowball effect. We just didn't play sound defc:nse, and as a unit, wt just felt hdpkss." 
"That doesn't have anything to do with the offense," Crabk em­phasizes. "I had confidence: in our of­tense right up until tht last series. I felt they were eventually going to start moving the ball. You've gotta have that kind ofconfidence in your offenst -it goes back to the whole team conctpt. But by the same tokc:n, you can't say 'Well, we gave up 14 points. So what? We'll scort 21.' When you start thinking like that, you're in trouble." 
This all brings us to the interesting question of"Now what?" \Vhat docs a tc:am do to recover from such a tlasco? 
go through the rt-entry draft. 
Reachttl in the San Diego office of attorney Bob Teaff, Kapstc:in said in the last proposal madt to Wagner. Conctpcion accepted a number of conditions which tht Rc:ds re­quc:stetl and asked for a package of S'i,2'i0,000 over tlve years. 
Kapstdn said Concepcion had ac­cepted contract clausc:s which the: Reds had rc:quc:sted, accc:pting waiver of a no-trade requc:st anti agreeing that he would not be paid in the event of voluntary retirc:mc:nt, a player strike or proper suspension by the dub. 
"Guarantet is a gtneric term," said Teaff. "Tht question is the scope of tht form of the guarantc:c:. W t art talking risks and tht alloca­tion of risks. Wt agrc:td orally to in­sert certain paragraphs Wagner wanttd. Thert was still much that ht wanttd that we couldn't agrte to." 
"Wt art still apart on money and 
there is a difference of opinions on 
the guarantets," Kapstein said. "We 
art much clostr on tht guaranttts 
than we wtre before, but we're not 
tht:re yet. 
"Tht Rtds know what it will takt to sign David. They can talk to us at any time." 
"First of all," says tht Irish co­captain. "you have to forgc:t the gamt, and all the mistakts. You learn from your mistakes, but you can't let them affc:ct your ptrformance tht next time out. Then, you havt to start prc:paring yoursdf totally for tht next week's ttam. You have to practice as hard as you can on the field, think about assignments more, especially the night befort, and just bt totally r.eady. I think we will bt: ready mentally this timt." 
In Novembt:r of 1979, <t wetk af tt:r tht embarrassment at Tennc:ssee, Notre Dame pc:rformnl sluggishly 
for the: second week in a row, hkw a l 0 point first-half lead, and dropped a 16-10 dc:cision to tht: Clemson Tigc:rs.
