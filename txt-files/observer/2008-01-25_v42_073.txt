ND builds on Ugandan partnership 
University develops plan to work with village; students involved in research, interviews 
By MARCELA BERRIOS Associate News Editor 
Last January, a group of Notre Dame delegates led by University President Father John Jenkins traveled to Nindye, Uganda, to visit the village that would become Notre Dame's partner in the Millennium Development Initiative. 
One year later, the ties between the University and the village of 5,000 have strength­ened with the research and find­ings of the project's staff and Notre Dame students, as well a5 the enthusiasm among the Ugandans, according to the pro­ject's assistant director. Tim

SMC candidates run unopposed for president, VP 
By KRISTEN EDELEN 
News Writer 
Saint Mary's students met juniors Mickey Gruscinski and Sarah Falvey, who are running unopposed for next year's student body president and vice president, in the atrium of the Student Center Thursday night during a "Meet the Candidates" event. 
Gruscinski, who is running as president on the ticket, currently serves on Saint Mary's Residence Hall Association (RHA) as treas­urer. Falvey is the National Residence Hall Honorary (NRHH) executive assistant, a representative position in a national organization. 
"An unopposed race is something that is definitely not normal and will make for an interesting election because they still have to campaign," said senior Maggie Siefert, former stu­dent body vice president and executive director of elec­tions. 
Shortly after the forum, Gruscinski and Falvey began knocking on doors across campus to promote their campaign to students. 

"Even though there is only one ticket they are working just as hard, as if there were

"We've done a lot 'of listening and learning over the last year, in order to really understand the people of Nindye and their needs. That was the first thing we needed to do," Lyden said Thursday. "We didn't want to just jump into this partnership without taking a breath to figure out what our next step would be and how we were going to do it." 
After the 2006 Notre Dame Forum on global health, Jenkins announced the University's involvement in the United Nations' Millennium Villages Project. Notre Dame, he said, would partner with a sub-

Coalition slow to meet 
Committee has yet to convene to discuss town-gown relations 
By JOSEPH McMAHON Assistant News Editor 
The Community Campus Advisory Coalition (CCAC), the central part of the South Bend Common Council's compromise to ditch its proposed party permit ordinance, has yet to meet since being estab­lished in September and has no current plans to convene. 
Student body president Liz Brown lobbied for the group as part of a compro­mise with the South Bend Common Council when dis­cussing alternatives the proposed ordinance. 
The major founding goal of the CCAC was to foster 
better relations between South Bend and the local universities-Notre Dame, Saint Mary's, Holy Cross and Indiana University­South Bend (IUSB). However, bringing all these parties to the table can often take some time, said Timothy Rouse, the presi­dent of the South Bend Common Council and co­sponsor of the original ordinance. 
"When you have a variety of folks and you want the inclusiveness, it takes a while to get it jump-start­ed," Rouse said. ''I'm sure that it will happen and it will be inclusive of the entire community."

ND admits 9 transfers, SMC admits 15 
By MEG MIRSHAK News Writer 
Notre Dame added nine transfer students, and Saint Mary's gained 15 new stu­dents as members of the spring transfer class. 
The Notre Dame Office of Admissions received 95 applications from students seeking to be admitted as a spring transfer student, said Susan Joyce, the associate director of admissions. 
Although juniors can apply to transfer to the University, all nine students admitted for the spring semester were sophomores. 
This year, the University's spring transfer class was unusually small, Joyce said, adding that the normal num­ber of spring transfer stu­dents is typically around 18 students. 
"[The Office of Admissions] does not see this as a trend,"

November, and winter break have all been factors in delaying the CCAC's first meeting. 
"We had hoped to have a meeting before Christmas time, but then it was thought with finals and the students going home, so we'd thought we'd wait until after the first of the [new] year," said at-large Council member AI "Buddy" Kirsits. 
Still, no date has been set, and many are hoping 
that the group  can  meet  
within  the  next  few  
months.

ND SIBC launches projects 
By EMMA DRISCOLL 
NewsWrirer 
Notre Dame students have been putting their business savvy to many uses through the Student International Business Council (SIBC). 
Organized into six different divisions -accounting, business consulting, fmance, global devel­opment, human resources, internships and marketing -the SIBC works on projects to "accomplish [its] vision of peace through commerce," said Maria Bufalino, director of the market­ing division. "We accomplish this by working with different compa­nies on a more international level." 
The SIBC has worked with companies such as PricewaterhouseCoopers, Boston Consulting Group, Starcom, Deloitte, RSM McGladery and NBC Sports, as well as nonprofits like Luca Leadership, Bufalino said. 
The Council has also worked with Notre Dame Millennium Development Initiative (NDMDI), Bufalino said. 
Bufalino said there are three to six projects for each of the six divisions, and anywhere from five to 20 students working on an individual project. 
"We try to keep it very diverse," Bufalino said. "It really can benefit everyone, not just business majors. You get to prac­tice presenting in front of people and you get to meet a variety of people and you get to learn and have fun." 
Students present projects to companies in order to form part­nerships.

INSIDE COLUMN 

Waiting for George 
Possibly as a result of the winter dol­
drums or Christmas vacation withdrawal, 
I have decided to approach this Inside 
Column with rny current annoyances. 

First, political candidates can no longer 
use the word "change." They should con­
sider olli1ring less

limns to run 

their campaigns. News J.tlre Editor 
As a first time 
voter, I'd prefer 
to see dear-cut 

strategies as opposed to simply identifying 
the nation's problems. Furthermore, the 
news media seems to devote ample time 
to tears and haircut<> on the campaign 

trail whm1 coverage of genocide is rare. 
Similarly, I do not turn to CNN fi>r the latest cow~h-jumping or umbrella-attack­ing celebrities. Attempting to stay aware of international events, I find myself more infi>rmed on recent mug shots or failed court appnarances. I Iowever, I no longer need to purchase an US Weekly. 
Third, although going green is crucial fiw the planet, I do not think changing light bulbs is truly elfeetive. Massive relilrms at the W<L<>hinhrton level must increase fuel eflidency standards in the even nearer future. Nevertheless, any global warming critics can support their ea<>e with South Bend weather. 
Fourth, the standard cable company fi>r the residm1ce halls does not provide Turner Classi1: Movies. Apparently, Cornc<L'>t <L<>sunws students are morn like­ly to watch IIG'IV and Jjfetime.

Also, no words c:an express my frustra­tion with my hometown team: the Bears. Except, perhaps sign Brady, as in Quinn. Only a former Purdue quarterback with a terrible beard would stumble under the press urn.

Rvvandan dancers visit SMC 
Michiana-based group makes second appearance on campus 
By ROHAN ANAND News Writer 
Members of the Saint Mary's community attended a per­formance by the Berwa Organization at O'Loughlin Auditorium on Thursday night. This was the second time that the Rwandan dance group, consisting of about 30 mem­bers, performed at the College. 
"It's more of a local, regional group," said Richard Baxter, the College's director of spe­cial events. "They performed at Saint Mary's about a year ago in a much smaller, inti­mate setting, and I explored the possibility of having the group return for a larger audi­ence." 
Traditional dance and music play an important part in the lives of Rwandans. At the beginning of the performance, one of the leaders of the group said dance and music are a way to teach younger genera­tions how to live in peace, love and harmony. 
All members of the Berwa Organization live in the Michiana area, where hun­dreds of Rwandans reportedly live. The name Berwa means "be proud" in the native Kinyarwanda language. The Berwa members ranged in age from 9 to 50. 
"They use dance to cope 
with what they have been through and pass the heritage of their dance styles on to their children," Baxter said. "Watching them perform these dances on a grander scale serves as a great lesson to us." 
The performance began with the "Inganzo" dance per­formed by younger girls, fol­lowed by the "Nyaruguru" dance performed by teenage girls. The second act consisted of the "Abakobwa b'Iwacu" dance that showed, in artistic movements, the typical day in the life of a Rwandan Movement. 
Following was the "Ingoma" dance performed by the Berwa drummers, and after the inter­mission was a series of acts depicting the Rwandan tradi-
Heritage dinner to honor Moreau 

tiona! wedding, the Rwandan naming ceremony, and the cel­ebration of a child's birth. The performance concluded with a fashion show. 
"It's uplifting to watch them dance, because it reaches their hearts," Baxter said. "It's hard to talk about dance and how it affects you emotionally, but you are so captivated by their commitment to what they are doing, and you can't help but invest in the project." 
All proceeds from the event will be sent by the Berwa members back to their fami­lies in Rwanda, a nation that has been torn apart by geno­cide and civil war.

Saint Mary's Board of Governance will host a Heritage dinner in Stapleton Lounge tonight at 6 to round out its celebration of the third annual Heritage Week. 
The week celebrates the his­tory of the College, and tonight's dinner will honor Father Basil Moreau only days after the first celebration of his feast day since his beatifi­cation in 2007. 
Student body president Kim Hodges said this year's dinner will be different from years past. BOG has invited Sisters of the Holy Cross to attend the dinner to tell stories about their experiences at Saint Mary's, and one· of the sisters is going to share her experi­ence from the celebration of Moreau's beatification. 
"The main purpose of the dinner is to bring the Sisters of the Holy Cross, faculty and students to converse and cele­brate the heritage of the College," Hodges said. 
BOG is strongly encouraging student patricipation. 
"The significance of the din­ner is to pass down tradition, pass down themes of who we are as Saint Mary's women from people who have been pillars at Saint Mary's College," Hodges said. 
College vice presidents and BOG officials will attend the dinner along with the Sisters pf the Holy Cross. 
Sodexho, the company in charge of dining hall services, will cater the French-themed meal. The courses will be sim­ilar to the dinner Monday in the dining hall that was held for Moreau. 
The dinner is open to the public and free of charge, but space is limited. Students interested in attending need to sign up at the front desk of the Student Center. 
The dinner will be followed by a sock hop in the Student Center Lounge from 9 p.m. to 
11. There will be an ice cream bar at the dance, and free T­shirts will be passed out in honor of Heritage Week. 
Another Heritage Week fes­tivity today will be guided tours of Reidinger House, a small building in the center of campus. The building was for­merly the location of home economics classes at the College. The tours run from 3 p.m. to 5. 
The winners of the scav­enger hunt that began Monday will also be announced today and award­ed their prize.

The SIBC purchased the ham­mocks made by artisans, took them to the United States to be sold and used the profits from the hammocks to help the artisans in Nicaragua, Tovar said. 
Tovar said that she researched the needs of the artisans and determined the best use for the hammock profits when she visit­ed Nicaragua. 

"We would go visit homes everyday and kind of observe and talk to them about what their needs were," she said. "Basically our trip was mostly for research purchases." 
While in Nicaragua during its rainy season, Tovar saw that the artisans' houses "were in very bad condition, they were getting rained on and everything inside was getting wet." 
Thus, the SIBC members in Nicaragua decided a housing project would benefit the arti­sans.

Students and women in Uganda can benefit a great deal from this project, she said. 
"Students in this project are learning how to build a business from the ground up. [It is] great for these women in Uganda because it is hopefully going to allow them to turn a profit and allow them to better their com­munity," Gaines said. 
The SIBC has developed more of an international focus recently. 
"It has changed in the fact that we're more focused on our vision of peace through commerce ... and what skills we can use to develop the vision," Bufalino said. 
Bufalino said that interested members can attend division meetings next week, and infor­mation about all projects is avail­able on the SIBC's Web site.

Transfers 
continued from page 1 
Joyce said. "Sometimes the application pool is different." 
A transfer student must complete one-half of his total degree requirements at the University. The number of jun­iors applying for transfer dur­ing the spring semester is usu­ally less than the fall semes­ter. But, occasionally, the 0 ffice of Admissions will receive an application from a first-semester junior who is off the normal four-year col­lege sequence, Joyce said. 
Last summer, the admissions committee evaluated 572 fall­semester applicants. Of the 159 students admitted, 87 percent were sophomores. 
At Saint Mary's, the number of incoming students is similar to what the Admissions Office has seen in past spring semes­ters, said Summer Runyan, the assistant director and campus visit coordinator of the Admissions Office. 
Saint Mary's evaluates transfer applicants on the qualifications that the student has completed two consecu­tive semesters of transferable college work. The applicant must have earned a 3.0 grade point average, Hunyan said. 
The Notre Dame sophomore class experienced a net gain of students after gaining fall and spring transfer students, Joyce said. Transfer students register for classes after returning students and enter a lottery for on-campus housing. 
All nine spring transfer stu­

dents at Notre Dame obtained on-campus housing, and the remaining fall transfer stu­dents who were placed on a waiting list in the fall received on-campus housing assign­ments this semester, Joyce said. 
Orientation sessions were held for transfer students at both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. Twelve students attended the Saint Mary's ori­entation, which included information sessions introduc-_ ing students to the campus and technology use at Saint Mary's. 
At Notre Dame, transfer stu­dents attended an abbreviated schedule of normal orientation events. The Transfer Orientation Committee, chaired by previous spring ­semester transfer students Ashley Weiss and Colin Ethier, planned two days of activities beginning the Sunday before classes began. 
Twelve previous transfer students were on the commit­tee. 
"[The members of the com­mittee] go out of their way to welcome the new students because they know what it is like to transfer colleges," Joyce said. 
On the first day of transfer orientation, separate panel discussions were held for stu­dents and parents, followed by a dinner in the Main Building. Transfer students and their families also joined University President Father John Jenkins for a Mass in the Log Chapel.

U.N. set to increase sanctions on Iran 
UNITED NATIONS -Major U.N. Security Council powers have agreed on an incremen­tal increase in sanctions on Iran, including a new restriction on exporters doing business with the country, diplomats said Thursday. 
A draft resolution also calls for more moni­toring of Iran's military and financial institu­tions, broader travel bans on Iranian nuclear scientists and other key officials, and freezing the assets of people and banks linked to weapons proliferation, Security Council diplo­mats told The Associated Press. 
Diplomats from the five nations with veto power on the council -the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France -spent a third day negotiating a final agreement on principles that would form the basis for a third round of 
U.N. sanctions on Iran. They were joined by Germany, which has long been involved in efforts to resolve the Iran nuclear dispute. 
Italian premier resigns after vote 
ROME -Italian Premier Romano Prodi resigned Thursday night after his government lost a risky Senate confidence vote. 
The center-left government fell four votes short of the 160 needed for victory. The vote was 161-156. 
Elected in April 2006, Prodi has had a shaky government from nearly the start. But it lurched toward collapse after a small Christian Democrat party, whose votes were vital to a coalition majority in the Senate, yanked its support earlier this week in the lat­est squabbling among his allies. 
NATIONAL NEWS 
GOP candidates compete for Florida 
BOCA RATON, Fla. -For Republican presidential contenders John McCain and Mitt Romney, Thursday's debate presented a chance to step out smartly in the strug­gle for victory in next week's Florida pri­mary. 
For Rudy Giuliani and Mike Huckabee, it represented perhaps a last, best hope to shake up a statewide -and national ­campaign that appears to be slowly leaving them behind. 
Rep. Ron Paul, a libertarian-leaning Texan with a vocal following, also had a spot on the stage for the prime-time debate, broadcast on MSNBC, five days before the primary. 
The Florida primary offers 57 Republican National Convention delegates to the win­ner. It is the first big state to vote in the nominating campaign, the first winner­take-all contest in terms of delegates, and the final election before a virtual national primary on Feb. 5. 
Feds raid museums for looted art 
LOS ANGELES -Federal agents executed search warrants Thursday at several Southern California museums, looking for stolen antiquities, officials said. 
Authorities were searching the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana and the Mingei International Museum in San Diego, said Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
A search warrant was also issued for the Pacific Asia Museum in Pasadena. 
LOCAL NEWS 
A tied vote stalls pro-life legislation 
INDIANAPOLIS -A tie vote in the Senate Thursday stalled legislation that would allow pharmacists to deny customers prescriptions they believe cause abortions -a bill oppo­nents say could limit women's access to birth control pills and other common contraceptives. 
The Republican-controlled Senate voted 24­24 for the contentious bill, but legislation must have 26 votes -a majority -to pass the chamber. Because the bill was not defeated outright, however, it could come up for anoth­er vote in coming days. 
Bill sponsor Sen. Jeff Drozda, R-Westfield, said pharmacists should not be required to fill prescriptions that go against their moral beliefs.

White House offers combat aid 
Gates says U.S. 'ready, willing and able' to help fight insurgents affiliated with Al-Qaida 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -The Bush administration is will­ing to send a small number of U.S. combat troops to Pakistan to help fight the insurgency there if Pakistani authorities ask for such help, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Thursday. 
"We remain ready, willing and able to assist the Pakistanis and to partner with them to provide addi­tional training, to conduct joint operations, should they desire to do so," Gates told a news conference. 
Gates said the Pakistani government has not requested any additional assistance in the weeks since al-Qaida and affiliated extremists have intensified their fighting inside Pakistan. And he stressed that the United States would respect the Pakistanis' judg­ment on the utility of American military assis­tance. 
"We're not aware of any proposals that the Pakistanis have made to us at this point," he said. "This is clearly an evolving issue. And what we have tried to communicate to the Pakistanis and essentially what we are saying here is we are prepared to look at a range of cooperation with them in a number of differ­ent areas, but at this point Command at the time; dis­larly with the tragic assassi­in Pakistan earlier this week it's their nickel, and we closed a deal with Pakistan nation of Mrs. Bhutto," meeting with senior await proposals or sugges­allowing U.S. troops in Gates said.

IN BRIEF Dems spar with Bush's EPA director 
WASHINGTON -The Bush administration's top environmental regulator faced off Thursday against Democratic senators who took turns denouncing him for blocking tailpipe emission cuts in California and more than a dozen other states. 
EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson defended his decision and didn't budge as he was accused of doing the bidding of the White House and the auto industry. It was his first Capitol Hill appearance since denying a feder­al waiver last month that would have allowed California to implement a law slashing green­house gas emissions from cars and trucks. 
Other states could then have followed suit and 12 were ready to do so, with others mak­ing preparations. 
"I evaluated all the data, I made the deci­sion, it's the right decision," Johnson said. "I was not directed by anyone to make the deci­sion. 
"I am bound by the criteria in the Clean Air Act, not people's opinions," he said, contend­ing California did not meet all those criteria. 
Bush proposes family leave changes 
WASHINGTON-The Bush administration is proposing the first changes in more than a decade to regulations that give workers unpaid leave to deal with family or medical emergencies, a move that concerns some of the law's supporters who want to see it expanded. 
The Labor Department announced Thursday it had sent the first proposed changes to regu­lations governing the Family and Medical Leave Act to the White House's Office of Management and Budget for approval. 
While refusing to outline the changes, Assistant Labor Secretary Victoria A. Lipnic said the proposed regulations will not reduce the number of people today who can take advantage of FMLA leaves. "People who are currently eligible under this law do not lose their eligibility," she said. 
But Debra Ness, president of the National Partnership for Women and Families, sug­gested that officials should be trying to expand the law, not change regulations.

Associated Press 

HONG KONG -Asian 
markets rallied Friday, further recovering from their plunge earlier this week, as investors took heart from gains on Wall . Street overnight and posi­tive figures about the U.S. 
economy. 

Investors also welcomed 
details of a tax rebate for 
U.S. consumers announced as part of President Bush's economic stimulus plan. The tax rebate will put $600 to $1,200 in most tax filers' pockets. 
"The markets are react­ing to news that Bush and Congress have agree to accelerate tax rebates for 
U.S. consumers so they can go out and buy more exports from Asia," said Francis Lun, a general manager at Fulbright Securities in Hong Kong.

"We looked at some of Ruhiira's strategies, timelines and budgets and hope to adapt those to Nindye's needs," Lyden said. 
One of those strategies was hir­ing a consultant from the Ugandan capital, Kampala, to conduct a participatory mapping exercise in Nindye. Lyden said the project's staff called on the same consultant used in Ruhiira to "map out existing infrastruc­ture, water sources, topography and population density, among other things, so that we could gain a better understanding of the region and take those things into consideration in the future." 
The mapping exercise, he said, involved the villagers by inviting them to three open meetings where they could offer their input and knowledge of the region. More than 100 people attended each of the sessions, Lyden said. 
"Word was getting out among the people about the way in which we wanted to build the

"People were extremely willing to spend one or two hours talking to our students," Lyden said. 
Two students were there through the Student International Business Council (SIBC), identifYing and interview­ing local entrepreneurs while the other three were doing academic research on different areas, including the education system and the economic and political conditions in Nindye, Lyden said. Their findings and conclusions will become the basis for a more tailored systematic survey that the project staff hopes to get out to the villagers in 2008.

This baseline survey, he said, will yield more information about Nindye's demographics, the level of education of its residents, their religion, mortality rates, meas­ures of maternal health and inci­dence rates for HIV/AIDS and other diseases like tuberculosis and malaria, among other key attributes. 
"We hope the results from this baseline survey will tell the peo­ple of Nindye what to tackle first: Do they work on purifYing water sources or on building new schools? Although ultimately, the hope is to be able to start work­ing on a variety of different initia­tives at the same time and in that way, 'jumpstart' the entire vil­lage," Lyden said. 
He said it's likely the survey will not be conducted until mid­2008, when Uganda Martyrs stu­dents in need of a summer job and who can speak the local lan­guage -Luganda -can dic;trib­ute it to the villagers, compile the results and communicate them to the people of Nindye. 
Notre Dame, for its part, will concentrate on raising more cap­ital to back up the project, Lyden said. This might include extend­ing an invitation to the alumni to become more involved in the efforts to help Nindye, but those plans aren't finalized yet. 
"We do know that sometime this fall, we hope to be able to gather the villagers, tell them what our findings are, work with them to prioritize their needs and come up with specific actions to address those needs, so that when resources become avail­able, they know exactly where to distribute them," Lyden said.

This December, a federal court dealt leled. 
Hamadan another blow, dismissing his law­suit and upholding the government's deci­sion. 
It is a long-awaited disappointment. 
Hamadan is a complex figure. His criticism of certain French Jewish intellectuals has drawn accusations of anti­Semitism. But he has also called for religious tolerance. His writings and lectures and his family history -his grandfa­ther founded the Muslim Brotherhood -have elicited warnings from critics, who call him insincere and accuse him of baeking oppressive, militant Islam. But he is also known as a reformer, strongly opposed to extremism. 
At a Catholic university that emphasizes the

A controversial professor should not be hired for contro­versy's sake; a professor -controversial or not -should be hired for the value he presents to the University.

Let's got it startnd (ha!). let's get it started in here. Let's get it started (ha!), let's get it started in here. After wasting far too much time trying to come up with an adequate introduction to this article, we concluded 
that anything we came up with would pale in comparison to the words of the Black Eyed Peas. Now that we got things "started (ha)" on to the topic at hand ... how the new Budweiser spokesman is the embodiment of all the worst qualities of every jerk we've 
ever met 

For all of you who watched the AFC and/or NFC champi­onship games, no matter who you were rooting for, I think there is something we can all agree upon. The new Budweiser guy is a huge d-bag. Who is this condescending butt clown and why is he wearing that obnoxious sweater and sport jacket combo. 
I think we all know what this guy's story is: He was second team all confer­ence in hockey as well as the captain of the football team which made it to state his junior year. After high school he went to the same college as 69 percent

of his graduating class and was a pre­ferred walk-on to the football team. After quitting halfway through his freshman season he joined a fraternity where he earned the nickname "Moose" for his drinking prowess. 
Junior year, well on his way to his com­munications degree, he met his wife, Jenni, at the Phi Delta Phi "Jungle Jamboree." 
Fast forward 20 years and they are married with three boys. No longer known as "Moose," he prefers to be called "Coach" since he coaches his 12­year-old son's traveling baseball team. He is a really crappy coach and contin­ually plays his son way more than other kids even though his son throws like 
Smalls at the beginning of "The Sandlot." Up 15 runs, he has no prob­lem stealing second and then third. He enjoys bullying the pimple-faced 14­year-old umpires not just to get the calls but out of the pure pleasure he gets from seeing a pre-pubescent boy cower in fear. Finally, he intentionally walks the opposition's top players to reach the uncoordinated weiners at the bottom of the batting order. 
As if his on field actions weren't lame enough, this is the same dude that brags amount his hemi-loaded Dodge Ham and eats three quarters of his meal before deciding he doesn't like it and demanding a refund. Furthermore, this stud is the one creepy old guy who is always overly willing to buy beer for the high school kids in hopes of gettin' some from a 16-year-old JV cheer­leader. 
This patronizing douche is supposed to make me want to drink Budweiser "premium lager" by talking to real fake-looking people in a picturesque bar setting? I really wonder who thought it was a good idea to make this stereotypical meat head the face of Budweiser. I mean, I think everyone feels like they kind of know that guy or have met his type of person at some time in their life, but the only problem is when you think of that guy you immediately then think about how much he sueks and make that comment to the nearest person whereupon they agree and bring up something about him that you didn't know you hated.

Debates tarnish Obama's image 
Last Monday, during the contentious South Carolina Democratic debate, Sen. Barack Obama tarnished his own image as a "new" type of politician -so much so. that only his support from African­Americans rises above double dig­its over rival Senator Hillary Clinton. Obama continues to fall off message, exposing his inex­perience while under intense pres­sure and scrutiny on the national stage. The political landscape of the past half-century is littered with similarly unsuccessful presidential candidates of both parties who offered a new direction, good intentions and charismatic rhetoric -but failed to win their party's nomina­tions. Consequently, Obama has drifted away from his original image as an inclu­sive candidate with high ideals who hap­pens to be an African-American into the more narrowly defined candidate of African-Americans. Unfortunately, voters demand broad appeal rather than a nar­rowing candidacy, which can be as fatal as being labeled the Haliburton candi­date. 
Political pundits have consistently mis­characterized Obama's appeal. In Iowa, they lumped him with former Senator John Edwards as the anti-Clinton change agents. However, it is Edwards, the party's former vice presidential nominee, and Clinton who are dividing the experi­ence-based vote over Obama's inexperi­ence. While Obama energized new and independent voters with lofty ideals in early contests, South Carolina is the first "closed" primary of the season in which only Democrats may vote. With more than half of the voters African-American, Obama's win will be narrowly viewed. 

Obama's back-to-baek losses in New Hampshire and Nevada caused his cam­paign to change tactics, taking their eyes off of the ultimate prize. Desperate for a win, Obama catered to South Carolina's African-American majority voters, first with his Nevada concession speech (read from a Teleprompter), then with new body gestures and language that make him sound more like a Southern Baptist minister. Voters in other parts of the country can clearly see his transforma­tion away from his original Iowa persona, a demeanor that now dramatically emphasizes the notion that he is just another politician doing what he needs to do for a desperate win. 
Obama unwittingly began transforming himself by describing his candidacy to a Nevada editorial board. Comparing his goals with the coalition-building skills of Ronald Reagan was a fair assessment but lacked the wisdom to avoid agitating Democrats unenthusiastic about Reagan. However, when Obama lumped Bill Clinton with Richard Nixon, an effort to contrast and slightly discredit Hillary, he stooped to a personal level by insulting the former president. It is a mystery how Obama cannot comprehend that his remarks were personal and how they surely invited, and drew, a quick response from Bill Clinton. 
The Obama campaign has been too sen­sitive against and too quick to engage the Clintons. First, they accused Hillary of a callous disrespect for Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. when she suggested that he needed President Lyndon Johnson's sup­port to achieve the passage of civil and voting rights laws. Then, in a zeal to win the next primary and break his losing streak, Obama himself complained about the former president's remarks that Obama's votes for military funding are identical with Hillary's votes, yet she is accused of supporting the war. Obama has become so rattled by the Clintons that he publicly whined about the former president to Hillary during the debate. 
Bill Clinton is demonstrating that in the presidential arena, Obama cannot have it both ways -hurling insults on the one hand, which Obama then decries as the old political way, and rationalizing his personal Clinton slurs as simply laying forth the facts. If other Democrats, like AI Gore or John Kerry, had been standing in Hillary's place on stage, they would have scolded Obama with, "Well, welcome to the big leagues. Do you naively think Republicans are will be genteel this fall because you invoked Reagan's name?" 
Most importantly though, Obama has been impatient and sounded curt during the debates. This week, he landed a body blow to Clinton by announcing that she served on the Wal-Mart board of directors when he was working as a community activist. The savvy and experienced Clinton returned a roundhouse knock­down when she countered that he had worked for a "slum lord in the inner city of Chicago," a reference to "Tony" Rezko, an unsavory Obama financial backer, whose contributions of $40,000 this year and another $11,500 in 2006 were given to charities. 
Modern history shows that challengers like Obama rarely overcome insider can­didates like Clinton in the contest for either party's presidential nomination. Despite lofty ideals eloquently espoused by charismatic candidates, party faithful of all genders and races routinely reward candidates who are experienced and have earned their rises through the party ranks. Beyond Saturday's South Carolina primary lies Super Duper Tuesday, a national primary day of 22 states, most open only to Democrats. Immediately fol­lowing Monday's debate, Hillary left South Carolina to campaign elsewhere, keeping focused on the prize. For Obama, last Monday's debate marks a transformation of him and turning point in the campaign where his stature has been diminished.

Timid males 
Dear Editor: 

Why is it that so many Notre Dame males com­plain about the quality and quantity of "normal" social interaction with their female counterparts? I for one am tired of hearing it. 
The problem does not lie within the female pop­ulation. The problem is rooted in the timid males who hide behind masks of studliness. The reason for this is more complicated than it may first seem. It begins with the devastating fear of rejec­tion. 
Most Notre Dame males were very popular in high school and never quite became attuned to the reality of being rejected. Hell, one of the greatest and most mystical universities in the country even granted them acceptance. 
Then they enter the "Notre Dame zone" where the next guy is just as smart, just as popular as he. 
And the women are so much brighter and wiser to the ways of the world than Notre Dame males are used to. The Notre Dame male enters a world where he is no longer numero uno -which is in itself rejection. 
Many of these males become intimidated by the whole situation. Unfortunately one of the conse­quences of this is that they shy away from doing the things they did in high school-i.e., asking girls out on dates. 
This leads to the formulation of excuses for the poor social interaction between men and women here at Notre Dame. It also may be a cause of other problems such as alcohol abuse. And it is a shame that the major excuse used places the blame on the women in the Notre Dame communi­ty. Wake up, guys! 
I feel that it is a responsibility for you and me to cure this situation. Not by passing the blame to those who don't deserve it, but by taking action and asking that cute blonde who sits in front of you in philosophy class if she would like to see a movie with you on Friday. If she says no, ask another.

Fortnight Productions, "Titanic" ditrers vast­ly from nearly every other campus production in one regard -the east and crew will have staged the entire show, from auditions to per­formanees, in just two weeks. Talk about a whole new way of telling a familiar story. 
Given how busy many Notre Dame students are, Fortnight Productions provides another the­ater venue for would-be perform­ers who might not otherwise have the time to commit to a full-scale production. The cast read and sang through the show for the first time on Jan. 14 and then went through scheduled rehearsals for 12 of the next 13 days. With the accelerated production schedule, the extremely tight timetable forced the production staff to be flexible and adapt to various chal­lenges as they arose. 
Despite the many challenges of staging Titanic on two weeks' notice, Chamberlin said he has enjoyed the experience of directing the ship. "It has been particularly rewarding to help a group of tal­ented. intelligent, experienced per­formers do something that none of us have over done before," he said. 
Chamberlin went on to say that he listnrwd to the soundtrack for "Titanic: The Musical" well before he ever saw the show onstage. When he finally did see the show, the performancn didn't live up to his nxpectations. "With so many pnople on board that fateful voy­age, there was a host of' com­polling stories," he said. "I felt them was an opportunity to do so much more with the story." 
One of the stories the show does not indude is the story arc played out Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in the movie version of "Titanie." "Neither Jaek or Hose are anywhere to be found in our production, and if' you want to hear 'My lleart Will Go On" you best bring your mp3 player," Chamberlin said. "Instead of trying to eompetn with the grandeur of the movie. we left the foeus on our talnnt and the music."

former WWE super­star Hulk Hogan and boxing's super middleweight champion Laila Ali. Hogan can be counted on to get the crowd excited, and his personal­ity has not changed much since he was a professional wrestler. But Ali lacks the charisma that defined her father, Muhammad Ali, and often comes up short when doing interviews. 
Moreover, the pair act merely as talk­ing heads, laeking the same kind of play-by-play coverage that former hosts Mike Adamle and Larry Cso_nka did in the original series. Adamle and Csonka could be counted on for quality and insightful commentary that rivals most of what to be athletes; now, each of them has to have an interesting story. In the same episode, three different contenders claimed they needed to win the 
$100,000 grand prize in order to rebuild a house destroyed by Hurrieane Wilma, buy a house to help her mother move out of a trailer and help spread Christianity. 
On the other hand, the gladiators remain as they were in the original: mysterious and dominant. The names that you grew up with are gone (no more Thunder, Lazer or Gemini), but they have been replaeed by the Haka­dancing Toa and the howling Wolf. Wolf is by far the best of this new crop of American heroes, if for no other reason that he looks to be flat out crazy. During events in which he is competing, he has the wild look in his eye of a madman bent on vengeance -something that has suited him just fine in the early goings of "American Gladiators."

The most important ehange is the move of the "travelator" (an inclined treadmill) from the beginning of the race to the end. This has wreaked havoc on the contenders in the revival, pun­ishing the proud contenders as they struggle to maintain their footing all the way up to the finish. 
Overall, the new series provides the same quality entertainment that the original provided a decade ago. Even though the current installment or "American Gladiators" has not been able to, and may never, match enter­tainment and competition of its prede­cessor, this new 21st-century install­ment is still very much worth watching.

After the deaths of his father and a good friend, Lupe Fiasco bounces back with the release of his second album. 
Fiasco opened for OK GO at the 2007 version of "The Show" in Joyce Center here at Notre Dame.

SLUMP . 
By CORBIN HICKS Scene Writer 
Lupe Fiasco was given the tough task of following up a debut album that was pro­duced by Jay-Z and nominated for a Grammy. While the hip-hop artist doesn't deliver a classic this time around, it's safe to say that he has exceeded expectations. 
Since releasing his debut album, much has changed in the life of Lupe Fiasco. Gone are the incessant comparisons and references to skateboarding. Fiasco has had to deal with a bevy of recent personal struggles and obstacles -including the deaths of his father and his good friend, rapper Stack Bundles. Also, his mentor, business partner and close friend Charles "Chilly" Patton was sentenced to 44 years in prison after a conviction on drug charges. These have not been the best 12 months for Fiasco. 
However, it hasn't been all negative. Average listeners and critics alike hailed his debut album as an instant elassic. He almost effortlessly became an icon for lyri­cism and the poster child for a return to the founding ideals of hip-hop. Seemingly coming out of nowhere, he has established himself as an epic songwriter and has leapfrogged other· up-and-coming Chicago MCs, such as Rhymefest and Bump-J, in mainstream accessibility and critical acclaim. No small feat for a rookie in the music business. 
Lupe Fiasco's follow-up effort, "The Cool," shakes off any fears of falling victim

courtesy 
to the sophomore slump. The album begins with a spoken-word intra that discusses the subjectivity of things that are tolerated in our society. Fiasco claims that what may be "cool" for one person could strike fear into the hearts of others. This track is followed by a solemn tribute to his incarcerated mentor. 
The grave seriousness of these first two tracks is eased somewhat by the up-tempo, double-time rhythm used in "Go-Go Gadget Flow," where Fiasco proclaims that Chicago is the "best city in the whole wide world." The brooding theme returns on the next track, ''The Coolest," and we begin to see a trend that is littered throughout this album. Obviously, Fiasco has been dealing with some personal demons, and his song-· writing reflects these struggles. The subject matter on this album is very dark, but it is not unbearable as the music alternates between the lively and the moody. 
The next song is "Superstar," which was the album's first single. Most of the Notre Dame student body remembers this as one of the unknown songs that Fiasco per­formed when he stopped by for "The Show." The next track is "Paris, Tokyo," which has an old-school, A Tribe Called Quest vibe to it. In this song, he explains all of the different kinds of places that he would take a special lady. 
These places include Paris, Tokyo, New Orleans, Brazil and various other exotic locations. Next is perhaps the song that stands out the most. "Hi-Definition," which features a guest verse by Snoop Dogg, is by far the most commercial attempt on the 
album. It is not bad by any means, but it throws off the continuity that the album has built up so far. 
After "Gold Watch" are two of the best storytelling tracks to ever come from a rapper. "Hip-Hop Saved My Life" is a detailed description of the life of an aspiring rapper and the journey that they endure in order to reach stardom. By the way, if you hear a song with a screwed-up hook that goes "Stack That Cheese" in the next six months, you know where it came from. 

"The Cool" is Lupe's follow-up to is Grammy award winning debut album. 
"Intruder Alert" goes where very few rap songs go. In the span of the song, Fiasco covers three topics that are considered taboo, expounding on the vulnerability and heartache that certain situations cause people who become engulfed by tough cir­cumstances. 
The first verse deals with a female rape victim, the second verse discusses a drug addict and the third verse talks about a father sending his infant daughter to the United States so that she can have a better life. These topics could be stand-alone songs, but the fact that he is able to com­bine all three of these emotional stories into one song -that is actually an enjoy­able listen -speaks to the wonders of Lupe's songwriting abilities. 
The rest of the album is solid. The sub­ject matter varies drastically from child sol­diers to the average day of a cheeseburger, but it still maintains the album's somber undertone. His versatility makes this effort thoroughly enjoyable and the tough subject matter easy to digest. Lupe's latest might not win a Grammy, but it's worth a spin.

more, the five actors constant­ly switch between roles. They wear black cos­tumes and distinguish between most of their roles by changing accessories, props and accents. 
This bare-bones production may not be a good choice for viewers who are unfamiliar with "The Taming of the Shrew" because the actors' multiple roles, combined with the convoluted plot, could make this production diffi­cult to follow. Sometimes, the actors even play two characters within the same scene and carry on a conversa­tion between their different roles. Also, portraying so many different roles with only five actors may lessen the depth of individual characters, but most of the roles in "The Taming of the Shrew" are played for comedy and not depth, so the acting does not suf­fer much from this minimalist approach. 
The actors establish a chaotic, yet humorous atmosphere throughout the play, exploiting their characters' quirky personalities and portraying their dilemmas in a humorous light. Martin Parr draws several laughs from the audience, portraying a ser­vant who impersonates a young woman and playing Bianca's suitor Gremio with an exaggerated accent, and Andy Greenhalgh smoothly tran­sitions between characters just by changing his posture. 
The main characters, Katherine and Petruccio, are still likable, despite their strong wills and quick tempers. Although Katherine is a "shrew," Louise Yates makes her seem like a rational character, and the audience can sympathize with her assertions of independence and her frustrations with the other characters. For exam­ple, in one scene, as Bianca snivels in front of her father, viewers can under­stand Katherine's annoyance with her sister. Also, after Petruccio marries Katherine, Yates leaves the audience wondering whether Katherine is actu­ally submitting to him or just humor­ing him to get what she wants. Likewise, Victor Gardener blends Petruccio's volatile personality with craftiness and even affection, as he attempts to "tame" his new wife. 
Although newcomers to "The Taming of the Shrew" may have trou­ble understanding the play, viewers already familiar with the comedy will enjoy this alternative approach to Shakespeare as they watch five actors play 23 diverse roles.

Irish host WVU in final hon1e n1eet 
By JARED JEDICK Sports Writer 
Notre Dame gets one more chance to take on Big East competition before the con­ference championships when it faces West Virginia Saturday in the Shamrock Invitational. 
The Irish have almost a month ofT before the Big East meet. which will begin on Feb. 20. 
"This is really our last run­through," coach Carrie Nixon said. "We really want to hone and fine-tune our racing skills." 
The Irish take to the pool for their last regular season meet of the season at the Holfs Aquatic Center, and for the seniors, this will be their last opportunity to compete in their home pool. 
"They are a little nostalgic," Nixon said. "They are pumped and sad at the same time." 
West Virginia will be Notre Dame's third Big East oppo­nent this season. 

"It is a good chance to flex your muscles and boost your confidence against an in-con­ference team, and that's always great," Nixon said. 
This will be only the second meeting between the two schools, with the Irish win­ning big in a 222.5-147.5 romp in last year's Shamrock Invitational. 
This year will still be a chal­lenge for the Irish, assistant head coach Joel White said. 
"West Virginia has some great swimmers," White said. "We always like to focus on the Big East." 
This last competition will give the learn a preview of what it can expect in the Big East championship. 
In her final year, possible Olympic hopeful Caroline Johnson has been a top per­former for the Irish. Nixon praised the effort Johnson put forth over the past four years. 
"She has been a joy to coach from day one," Nixon said. "She has had a huge impact on the team and I can­not say enough." 
The Irish are swimming well, as they hold the fastest times in the conference in five individual events and one relay. 
Freshman Amywren Miller holds the record in the 50­yard freestyle, junior Christa Riggins in the 200 freestyle, junior Casey Wagner in the 1,650 freestyle, freshman Sam Maxwell in the 100 breaststroke, and freshman Katie Casey in the 200 fly. 
The Irish also have at least one swimmer in the top five in almost every event. That will be important in the Big East championship format, which favors depth over flair. 
Saturday's meet will consist of a morning and an evening session, the first beginning at 
9:30 a.m. and the second at 4 p.m.

Belles face Calvin after tough losses 
By PETE REISENAUER Sports Wrirer 
Saint Mary's hopes to rebound after two tough loss­es last weekend when it trav­els to Michigan to face MIAA power Calvin tonight. 
Coach Hyan Dombkowski said he thought the losses to Ilillsdale and Olivet brought his team together and taught it what it needs to do to beat a top-tier program like Calvin, whieh captured the MIAA title least season. 
"Even though we came up on the short end two meets in a row, I think that this week­end may even push us to be a better team than two wins would have," Dombkowski said. 
The team will need its best effort as it faces undefeated Calvin, ranked No. 4 in Division III. 

The Belles believe they are on the cusp of becoming a great program, and a win over Calvin could help them get there. To improve on their strong performances in the losses, the Belles will need top efforts from co-cap­tains senior Kelly Tighe and junior Melissa Gerbeth. Saint Mary's also needs sophomore Lindsey Nelis and freshman Casey Niezer to have another solid meet.

Tiger two back at Buick Invitational 
Associated Press 
SAN DIEGO -Tiger Woods delivered the score he expected in his 2008 debut, just not the game. 
Despite playing from the sand, rough and behind a few trees early in his round, Woods began a much-anticipated sea­son Thursday with a S-under 67 on the tougher South Course at Torrey Pines. That left him two shots behind Troy Matteson, and gave him a strong presence on the leaderboard as he goes for his fourth straight title in the Buick Invitational. 
"It wasn't pretty off the tee, but I hung in there," Woods said. "Shooting 67 is always going to feel pretty good on the South Course." 
Imagine how it felt for Matteson. 
He ran off five birdies in a six­hole stretch on the back nine, then finished his round with consecutive birdies to become the first player since Davis Love III in 2000 to have the first­round lead while playing the South. 
"I won't top that for awhile," Matteson said. 
Brad Adamonis had a 66 on the North Course, which is 600 yards shorter and played more than two strokes easier. 
Rory Sabbatini, Stuart Appleby and Kevin Streelman, who began the day as the third alternate, were in the group at 67 with Woods. They all played on the North, which is where Matteson and Woods play on Friday. 
Phil Mickelson opened his season with a 70 on the North. 
Matteson was 11 shots better than his last trip around the South Course. That was the final round a year ago, when he played alongside Woods and watched the world's No. 1 play­er turn an ordinary round into a winner. 
Maybe someone of that rubbed off on Matteson. 
"That's an experience that 
any player would remember," Matteson said. "Anytime you get paired with Tiger, it's very inter­esting from a crowd standpoint, from a what-he-does stand­point. It's just pretty neat to see the guy shoot 66 on Sunday to 
win." · 

Woods, who hasn't played since winning his Target World Challenge by seven shots on Dec. 16, wasn't the only person returning to work. 
Golf Channel anchor Kelly Tilghman was back in the booth after a two-week suspension for jokingly suggesting young play­ers wanting to take on Woods should "lynch him in a back alley." She recorded an apology that opened the telecast.

MEN'S SWIMMING 
Swimmers face West Virginia in final tune-up 
By CHRIS DOYEN Sports Writer 
Coming off losses last week­end to Louisville and Northwestern, No. 22 Notre Dame will try to capture a win Saturday in its final meet of the regular season, an important test before the Big East champi­onships. 
The Irish will face West Virginia in the Shamrock Invitational, a meet that coach Tim Welsh said will be special. 
"This is an important week­end for the team for several reasons," Welsh said. "It's the last meet of the season prior to the Big East championships, and it's the last home meet in this pool for seniors ever. It's our last chance to get every­thing right." 
The Irish have competed against two other Big East schools in dual meets this sea­son, notching a victory over 
Pittsburgh in November before 
dropping the meet against 
Louisville. 
Last season, the Irish squared 
off against Wes-t Virginia, 
Oakland, Penn State and 
Connecticut in the Shamrock 
Invitational. The Irish posted a 
2-2 mark to finish third in the 
meet, while the Mountaineers 
won, going 4-0. 
Junior diver Michael Bulfin, along with sophomores John Lytle, Andrew Hoffman and Ross Moore, are some of the returning point scorers from .last year's invitational. Their experience, along with contri­butions from a large freshman class, should help the Irish in their attempt to avenge last year's home loss to the 
Mountaineers. 
The two teams also met at the 
2007 Big East meet, where West 
Virginia, which ended its regu­
lar season undefeated, edged 
Notre Dame by 4 1/2 points to 
win the conference crown. 
West Virginia has faced four 
conference opponents in dual 
meets this year and has com­
piled a record of 2-2 with losses 
to Pittsburgh and Louisville, and 
victories over Georgetown and 
Cincinnati. 
Welsh thinks that Notre 
Dame's schedule in the past few 
weeks should help the Irish 
against West Virginia. 
"West Virginia is the defend­
ing champion, and Louisville 
has been the hottest team in the 
conference all season long," 
Welsh said. "We will have seen 
them both in the last two weeks 
of the season. It's good prepara­
tion for us, and' it's pretty excit­
ing." 

This year's Shamrock Invitational is a two-session dual meet, with the first session set to begin at 9:30 a.m. and the .second at 4 p.m. Saturday at 
Rolfs Aquatic Center.

Starting spots up for grabs in opening exhibition 
By MICHAEL BRYAN 
SportS Writer 
While Sunday's opening game against Hobert Morris is an exhibition, the Irish have plenty to play for with several starting positions still up for grabs. 
Notrn Dame, ranked fifth in Laerosse Magazine's preseason poll, will begin the season with a home serimmage against the Colonials at 10 a.m. The Irish will look to build on a strong 2007 eampaign that featured an NCAA Tournament appearanee and the team's 1Oth Great Western Laerosse League title. 
Notre Dame eoaeh Kevin Corrigan said he was looking forward to seeing his players go up against new eompetition. 
"l just want to see our guys going up and down, playing in the roles we're looking to !ill," Corrigan said. "When you eom­petn against yourselves every day tlwrn are things you don't get to see." 

Robert Morris enters South Bend in just its fourth season as a varsity program. The Colonials struggled last season, going 3-9 and ending the sea­son on a seven-game losing streak. 
Key returnees for Robert Morris indude senior eaptains Andrew Watt and John Kennedy, whose mammoth presenec in goal will ehallenge the Irish offense. The 6-foot-2, 330-pound Kennedy reeorded an 11.78 goals-against average last season in six games, while Watt led the Colonial offense with 22 goals and 30 points. 
While the Irish return seven of 10 starters from last season's 11-4 team. Corrigan said there are still battles for starting posi­tions. 
"We still have eompntition at some positions," Corrigan said. "A lot of guys will be trying to win jobs or solidify their spots." 
Heturning in net for the Irish 
· 
is senior eaptain Joey Kemp, a preseason All-Ameriean selee­tion and the 2007 GWLL player of the year. A four-year starter for Notre Dame, Kemp has a 26-11 reeord and 7.43 goals­against average for his eareer. 
Senior Sean Dougherty, another preseason All­Ameriean, anehors an Irish defense that gave up a pro­gram-best 6.66 goals per game last season. 
Two-sport athlete Will Yeatman, the 2007 LaxPower rookie of the year, will return as the leader of a strong Irish attaek. Yeatman, who also plays tight end on the football team, led Notre Dame in points as a freshman with 21 goals and 25 assists. 
Joining Yeatman on the attaek will be junior Ryan Hoff, who netted a team-high 40 goals for the Irish last year. Even more impressive than Hoff's searing might have been his aeeuraey -he posted a .500 shooting

Notre Dame fenees in New York City Saturday in the most important regular-sea­son competition on almost every elite team's schedule. 
The Irish take on the major powers of the sport in the NYU Duals this weekend, meeting with a slew of top-1 0 teams -Ohio State, St. John's, Columbia, Yale and Northwestern -among oth­ers. 
The only top team expected to challenge for the NCAA epeeist Kelley Hurley, who Colo., from Jan. 12-13. will be competing in a World "For us, it would be like an Cup event in Europe.

Because of Notre Dame's victories at the Western Invite two weeks ago and its national rankings (No. 1 among women's teams, No. 3 among men), Bednarski said, there will be added expectations for the Irish. 
"It's a pressure for sure. Kids, knowing we are going to the strong tournament, are very nervous -some of them," Bednarski said. "It's also an opportunity to deal with stress." 
The Irish left for New York Thursday morning and were scheduled to arrive in the eity by Thursday night. The team will go sightseeing in the Big Apple today before having dinner with alumni, including former feneers, tonight.

both times. Last year, the Irish lost to the Cavaliers 6-1, and they fell 4-3 two years ago when Virginia was again ranked No. 1. 
"We proved it can be done," Bayliss said. "We've had them on the ropes the last couple of years, but our freshmen have never been under that kind of pressure. It will tell us a lot about our team to see how well they handle the pressure this weekend." 
Last weekend, the Irish played in a home doubleheader. In the opening match, Notre Dame defeated talented Penn State 5-2. It capped off the day with a 7-0 win over Toledo. 
Coming through for the Irish was the doubles team of senior Sheeva Parbhu and junior Brett Helgeson, winning both of their matches. 
"They return as well as any­one in the country, and have made great improvements at net," Bayliss said. 
While Parbhu and Helgeson make the obvious splash at the top of the lineup, a quieter force has been brewing at No. 2 doubles: senior Andrew Roth and freshman Stephen Havens. Roth is putting his game togeth­er after injuries plagued his early years at Notre Dame. 
Roth has a determined work ethic, Bayliss said, and has become more accountable ­along with being an emotional sparkplug. 
Although the Irish came out with wins in their opening matches, they found some things they need to work on as well. 
"Stephen Havens needs to stay in longer rallies," Bayliss said. "[Freshman] David Anderson is still working on attacking with his forehand more often. He is also working on coming to net more." 
While these players are gear­ing up to face Virginia, one player isn't quite ready to see action. Freshman Matt Johnson is still sidelined because of a strained pectoral muscle. He has begun serving this week but will take more time to get back into playing shape, Bayliss said.

"I expect it to be a playoff­type situation because they're playing at a very high level right now," Jackson said of the Falcons, who will bring a "quick, frantic style of play" to the Joyce Center for tonight's 7:30 start. "They have had a lot of success and gained a lot of confidence, and it's up to us to take the style of play we want into this type of game." 
After a tough weekend series with No. 1 Michigan, in which the Irish lost a 3-2 heartbreaker on Friday before getting waxed 5-1 on Saturday, Jackson gave his frustrated club just what it needed: not extra rink-time, not added power-play drills, nor bonus conditioning, but a little game of "shinny." 
"We came in Monday not sure exactly what we were going to do," said junior right wing Erik Condra, who leads the Irish in scoring with 27 points. "Coach surprised us by saying we should go out and have some fun out on the pond like we used to when

(18-0, 5-0 Big East) and most recently beat No. 3 North Carolina at home on Monday. Regardless of the challenge the Irish face, Notre Dame coach Muffet McGraw said the chance to play the best team in the nation at home on national television -ESPN2 will tele­vise the game -will indicate how her team compares with the rest of the Big East. 
"[It's] another opportunity for us to come out and see just how far we have to go this sea­son to get to a spot in the Big East where we can really com­pete with everybody in the Big East," McGraw said during a conference call with reporters. "And we haven't been able to do that just yet, so that's some­thing we're working on." 
The Irish (15-4, 3-2 Big East) have sometimes hidden behind their offense, McGraw said. They average 79.4 points per we were younger, so we got our mittens and hats and hooded sweatshirts ana went out there.... Playing six-on­six, just having fun, having some hot cocoa out there ­just getting back to our 
roots." 
The timing may have been just right for a quick break from the daily grind of a long, grueling season, as Condra believes the time is now for the Irish to start ele­vating their game to a new level. 
"This is the weekend we need to start making a push for the end of the season," Condra said. "We're shooting for a playoff spot and a top­four seed in our league, and this weekend needs to start us off right." 
Much has been made of the power play's current dire straits, which appeared to hit rock-bottom hy giving up a short-handed goal in Saturday's loss to Michigan. Consistency's the word for Jackson, and he saw signs that the unit's coming around. 
"We're getting some scor­ing chances, and that's all we can really ask," said Jackson, who hinted at minor changes 
game and shoot 4 7.1 percent from the field. 
"We have a little bit of an attitude that our scoring's going well, so let's just keep scoring and get the ball back and outscore them," McGraw said. "And we really can't do that against good teams, and that's really been hurting us." 
Notre Dame allowed 87 points to Tennessee, 74 to Louisville, 86 to Georgetown and 81 to DePaul. McGraw said that playing zone defense might counteract the team's defensive woes, but that the team needs to focus no matter what defense it plays. 
"We've been playing a lot of man to man, and we just haven't been good guarding the 3-point line whether in man or zone," McGraw said. 
McGraw said the lineup did­n't matter. She said she could tinker with it to tailor the game plan against specific defensive matchups, but she doesn't anticipate lineup changes if the team plays more zone defense.

in personnel and strategy around the net. "Right now it's about getting the puck and trying to establish some pressure at the net. Those are the basics of the power play, and we have to make sure we're doing those things on a more consistent basis." 
Puck control will be crucial in thwarting the Falcons' fast-paced, transition attack, which is led by senior for­ward Derek Whitmore, Bowling Green's leading scor­er (24 points, 19 goals). Defenseman Kevin Schmidt (15 assists) and forward James Perkin (13 assists) will try early and often to get the puck to Whitmore, who has scored 18 of his 24 points in Bowling Green victories. 
"Looking back to last year, we didn't have that many close, tough games," Irish senior defenseman Brock Sheahan said. "A lot of things seemed to go our way, and that might've hurt us in the NCAA Tournament. We've been facing a lot more adver­sity this year, and hopefully that will help us in the long run."

"We're playing the same eight or nine people, not 1l big deal to me who starts," she said. 
While the Irish need to improve their perimeter defense, that will be the least of their worries against Connecticut. The Huskies aver­age 83.4 points per game and give up only 46.1. They shoot 
49.6 percent from the floor and make an average of 6.4 3­pointers per game. They out­rebound opponents by 16.9 per game. 
Huskies guard Renee Montgomery dropped 53 points in her last two games, 27 against Cincinnati on Jan. 19 and 26 against the Tar Heels, despite only averaging 
11.9 points per game. Freshman forward Maya Moore leads Connecticut with 
15.8 points per game, and cen­ter Tina Charles averages a double-double (13.8 points, 
10.4 boards). Guard Mel Thomas has hit 39.3 percent of her 3-point attempts. 
Despite her displeasure with the team's recent performance, McGraw said she was happy with the play of sophomore center Erica Williamson and freshman guard Ashley Barlow of late. Barlow led the team in scoring in the past three games and Williamson scored a career-high 16 points against DePaul Tuesday. She was also happy with sophomore guard Melissa Lechlitner. 
When asked about the notion that some conference coaches view Connecticut as a throw­away game, McGraw dismissed the idea and said she wel­comed the chance to face the Huskies. 
"I think there might be some teams in the league that feel they can't compete against Connecticut right now, but I think it s a challenge for us and opportunity for us to play the No. 1 team in the confer­ence ... and certainly for us on national TV, it makes it an even bigger opportunity," she said. "It's great to have them in the league because they set the standard for the conference. I think most of us would love to be where they are."

Georgetown team last weekend. Villanova does not have any play­ers taller than 6-foot-1 0, but the Wildcat<> feature a quick, guard­oriented system. 
"It's a different team than (;eorgetown," Irish coach Mike Brey said. "They're nowhere near as big but they're fast and they'll shoot it. And they'll drive it and they'll spread us out with a lot of speed." 
One of the biggest challenges for the Irish defense will be Wildcats sophomore guard Scottie Heynolds, who is the reigning Big East player of the week after scoring a combined 46 points against DePaul and Syracuse last week. 

"lie's a heck of a player," Brey said. "We've gotta really be aware of him because he's the guy that kind of makes them go." 
But in an 80-68 win over Villanova Wednesday, Rutgers proved that Heynolds can be con­tained. Rutgers held the Wildcats' star to 16 points on 5­of-1 9 shooting. 
"I think [defending him has] gotta be by committee," Brey said. "We'll change it up. You gotta throw a lot of different looks at him." 
Brey said he thinks the Irish can exploit Villanova's lack of size by giving touches to their big men, senior forward Rob Kurz and llarangody. 
"I do think we can get the ball inside and establish our inside game more successfully than we could against Georgetown," Brey said. "So we definitely want to try and do that." 
Kurz and junior forward Ryan Ayers, who both grew up in the Philadelphia area, are looking forward to playing in the Wachovia Center. 
Ayers said he is also excited to see Villanova red-shirt freshman Andrew Ott, who was Ayers' high school teammate at Germantown Academy. 
"It's gonna be a great environ­ment," Ayers said. ''I'm just excit­ed to play in front of my family and friends." 
Despite the many extra ticket requests he has received from family and friends, Ayers said. he is not distracted from his goal of helping the Irish to their first conference road win. 
"As long as we play like we've been playing at home [we'll winI," he said. "We have to trans­late our home identity onto the road." 
Brey agreed with Ayers, saying he doesn't want his team to change its style because it is the visiting team. 
"We have not been very good on the road but I don't know if we want to overanalyze things," Brey said. "We want to, you know, come out and compete again. I don't think you make all kinds of changes to your system."

In the teams' last meeting, Saint Mary's struggled to keep up with Hope, shooting only 36.2 percent to Hope's 
46.8 percent. 

"Hope comes into the game still undefeated and top in the country," Henley said. "We
