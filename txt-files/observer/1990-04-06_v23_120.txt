Lithuanian parliamnnt's infor­mation office called Thursday's message a "diplomatic and conciliatory" response to Gorbachev's demand that Lithuania renounce its indepen­d•mce dedaration. 
The message addressed Gorbaehev as "deeply esteemed president," and said the par­liament "reiterates its readi­ness to begin a dialogue and to discuss measures to establish new relations between our states." 
But Thursday afternoon, about 50 armed men entered the prosecutor's office, site of a prnvious Soviet attempt to seize authority from officials ap­pointed by the new Lithuanian government. 
Henrika Pocei, secretary to Lithuania's chief prosecutor, said in a telephone interview from Vilnius that the men "fully occupied the building, and there are six or night paratroopers ·~n each.. lloor dressed as po­hcmmm.

Official rallies in Tiananmen stop mourning on the Day of the Dead 
BEIJING (AP) -Authorities staged ail-day rallies in Tiananmen Square on Thursday, China's annual day for mourning the dead. pre­venting unofficial visits to the symbolic center of last year's erushed democracy movement. 
It was the second time in a week city officials held official activities in the squarn as an exeuse for closing it to the public. 
The method appeared suc­cessful. There were no reports of attempts to lay wreaths near the square or otherwise honor the hundreds and possibly thousands of people killed June 3-4, when the army opened firn on pro-democracy protesters and retook the square where they had camped. 
In Hong Kong, however, an estimated 20,000 people marched in honor of the Beijing dead, many carrying banners or bouquets of flowers. 
1\ wreath was left from Chai Ling, a leading activist in the Beijing uprising who escaped to the West last week after 10 months on the run in China. "Patriotic heroes will live for· ever." read a banner on the wreath. 
Thursday was China's annual Qingming, or Clear and Bright Festival, when families tradi­tionally visit graves to mourn their dead. Chinese dissidents abroad, through faxes and mailed leaflets, .urged Beijing residents to stroll through Tiananmen Square on Qingming in memory of the slain protesters. 
Early in the week, howevnr, Beijing authorities issued orders curbing even normal mourning activities. such as group visits to crematoriums. 
The Beijing Daily newspaper published a letter Sunday from a city official warning residents to pass Qingming in a "civilized and healthy" way and not "take advantage of the opportunity to create disturbances." 
Schools and factories told people not to wear traditional signs of mourning, such as black armbands or white !low­ers. Some colleges suddenly an­nounced special'. mandatory political lectures, apparently in an effort to keep students oc­cupied. 
Authorities bused thousands of high school-age Communist Youth League members into Tiananmen Square in the morning. They paid homage to China's revolutionary martyrs and listened to a leetu re on China's past strugglns against foreign imperialists. 
In the aftllrnoon, primary school nwmbers of the Young Pioneers. wearing their insignia n~d handkerchiefs around their necks, marched onto the square in formation to hear more pa­triotic speeches. Both the Youth League and the Young Pioneers try to foster Marxism among young people. 
Members of the Peopln's Armed Police, a paramilitary unit, stood guard on the square's perimeter. Dozens of ordinary police patrolled ad­joining streets, making sure members of the public did not try to enter. They yelled at for­eigners who tried to photo­graph the ceremonies. 
The city also held official ral­lies in the square Sunday. an­other day when overseas dissi­dents suggested Beijing resi­dents hold protest strolls there. 
The next three months indude many other dates when memorials or protests might seem apt. April 15 is the one­year anniversary of the death of ousted Communist Party leader llu Yaobang, a relative liberal.

Quayle not impressive to this observer 
When George Bush--------­announced that J. Danforth Quayle 
would be his running mate in the 1988 presidential cam­
paign, many people were skeptical. Quay!~ first came Corinne Pavlis 
under fire over the National_ Saint Mary's Editor 
GuardN1etnam scan dal. The public, media, and various talk show hosts then began criticizing his youth­fulness and questioning his intelligence. 
Being a political science major, I like to think I am somewhat politically aware. But, I have to admit that I really did not know too much about Quayle before his nomina­tion. I knew he was a second-term Indiana senator, but that was about it. 
I consider myself a patriotic American and subsequently felt an overwhelming need to find some information on Quayle. I wanted to know something about the man who would be second in command at the reigns of power for the United States. Also, I wanted to find reason to respect and have faith in the man the media seemed to love to slam. 
I tried to remain neutral until after he ac­tually assumed the Vice Presidency. Many of my fellow majors had already joined the "we don't like Quayle" bandwagon. Just in case there are some students left who have not yet felt the call to question Quayle's ca­pabilities in representing our country, Here is some food for thought. 
I was recently reading about an appear­ance Quayle made at a luncheon for the United Negro College Fund. I think every­one has heard the organization's straight­forward slogan "A mind is a terrible thing to waste." At the luncheon, Quayle at­tempted to voice support for the group by stating that "what a waste it is to lose one's mind, or not to have a mind." I guess he would know. 
My personal favorite Quayle blunder stems from his response when questioned about the Soviet Union's foreign policy and Gorbachev: Quayle responded that the Soviet union "Hadn't changed much in foreign policy." 
Anyone who has flipped on the evening news or picked up a daily paper at any time over the last year would know that the events surrounding Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union have been of profound histori­cal and political significance. History was being re-written and Quayle did not even no­tice. 
I know that I cannot judge his actual per­formance as Vice-President on the basis of these two incidents, but it just seems that a man who can become Vice President should not be making such moronic comments. I can not help but be a little disappointed in him and a little embarrassed of him.

Shuttle telescope test completed 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -NASA finished testing the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope aboard Discovery and started final pre­countdown work Thursday, raising the space agency's hopes for a timely launch next week. 
It is the most comfortable NASA officials have felt about Tuesday's launch date since a power outage interrupted the testing Monday, said George Diller, a spokesman for the space agency. 
"Basically, the work's done. We're just down to the things you can't do before now anyway," Diller said. 
"We're essentially on or near schedule on all of that work. I'm really not aware of anything that's unusually shaky," he said. 
The countdown is scheduled to begin Saturday afternoon. Early forecasts show an 80 percent chance of weather favorable for launch Tuesday, with the weather worsening 
slightly during  the  next  two  
days.  
Functional  testing  of  the  
telescope  and  shuttle  was  

completed early Thursday, and the launch pad was cleared of all non-essential personnel for final preparation of the payload and orbiter. 
Technicians were in the middle of the 52-hour test when a power outage at Kennedy Space Center knocked out air conditioning and forced the shutdown of heat-sensitive computers. Testing resumed Tuesday evening and had to be completed by Thursday morning for the mission to stay on schedule. 
As soon as the testing ended, technicians began the routine procedure of placing explosive devices on the shuttle's solid rocket boosters, external tank and the orbiter itself to be used in the event of a serious malfunction, said NASA spokesman Bruce Buckingham. 
Power was turned off to the telescope and shuttle so that the hazardous work could be performed. Charging of the telescope's nickel-hydrogen batteries also was halted and was to resume.

"Why did the Soviet Union delay so long?" he asked. "The Soviet Union ... until recently was obviously a dosed and con­trolled society. Bad news, espn­cially about the environment, was suppressed. Public expo­sure to problems about the Aral Sea was limited." 
He further added, "Irrigation and cotton production, and that's where most of the water went for ... was being pushed by the central authorities." 
"Since 1986, the Aral problem has become the foeus of na­tional and international con­cern," Micklin said, adding that western researchers like him­self and organizations such as the United Nations and National Geographic are now becoming involved. Micklin con­

Anti-drug efforts in D.C. are failing 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The federal initiative to stem drug abuse and related violence in the nation's capital has failed, the city's police chief said Thursday. 
A spokesman for federal drug policy coordinator William Bennett also said one lesson learned from the year-long ef­fort was that "civic resolve" is needed to make any anti-drug program a success. 
A senior spokesman for Bennett later backed away 

-from that comment, saying Bennett doesn't believe Washington residents la.ck the resolve needed to reduce drug abuse. Isaac Fulwood. the District of Columbia's police chief, ac­knowledged that the special anti-drug effort announced a 
year ago by Bennett has not lived up to expectations. 
"I think there's enough blame to go around for everybody," Fulwood said. "I would say ev­erything has failed right now because we haven't turned it around. Victory won't be de­clared until we stop the mur­ders." 
However, City Administrator Carol Thompson said: "We think we have made great strides in addressing the prob­!em." 
The federal government orig­inally promised to direct an ex­tra $100 million to drug pro­grams in the district, primarily for additional jail space. That money has gone unspent be­cause the city has failed to agree on a plan for jail con­struction. 
The administration also as­signed military prosecutors to district drug cases, offered money for new drug treatment centers and established a spe­cial Drug Enforcement Administration team. 
Bennett spokesman David Robb said Thursday that one of the lessons learned from the special effort was that "lack of civic resolve on the part of citi­zens in anv citv can hlod Pf­forts" to control the drug problem. 
B~t Don Hamilton, Benne~t's mam spoke~man, later dis­avowed Robb s comment. 
"It is not.the view of the of­flee or of director Bennett that there is any lack _o~ resolve on t~e ~art of the citizens of,the D1stnct or anywhere else to combat drugs, Hamilton said.

Rocket Pegasus sends first satellite payload into orbit 
EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) -An ex­perimental Pegasus rocket was blasted into space Thursday from a B-52 and successfully delivered its first satellite payload into a polar orbit, officials said. 
"Pegasus is on its way," bomber pilot Gordon Fullerton radioed to con­trollers at 12:11 p.m. as the 50-foot rocket was dropped from its perch beneath the jet's right wing. 
Twelve minutes later, tracking crews at the Ames­Dryden Flight Research Fa­cility at Edwards determined the 440-pound satellite had successfully reached orbit 368 miles above Earth. 
"Everything went accord­ing to the mission profile," said C.J. Fenrick, spokesman for Ames-Dryden. "This is a big step for the Air Force, NASA and private corpora­tions interested in space." 
Strapped beneath the right wing of the gleaming white and silver bomber, Pegasus was flown to 40,000 feet over the military's Western Test Range in the ocean off Southern California. 
The 41 ,000-pound rocket was released and appeared to fall free for five seconds, then streaked into space trailing a fiery ribbon of smoke. 
The delta-winged first-stage booster flew to 200,000 feet, then second-and third-stage rocket engines ignited to earry Pe­gasus into low orbit to eject it and its Navy satellite. 
Developed by Virginia­based Orbital Sciences Corp. and Delaware-based Her­cules Aerospace Corp., Pega­sus was designed to put small satellites into orbit at low cost. It has been called the poor man's satellite booster. 
"You are watching history, guys," Orbital Sciences spokeswoman Barbara Zed­ina told reporters. "I can't believe it. You go over this so many times in your mind. It's wonderful." 
The estimated rost of a 
Pegasus launch was between 
$6 million and $8 million, a 
fraction of the cost of an At­
las or Titan rocket firing, 
officials said. 
Thn PP,ntagon and the Na­tional Aeronautics and Space Administration want to use Pegasus for military and scinnee satnllites. but Pega­sus also is expcctnd to at­tract businoss from compa­nins, foreign governments and university scientists who ncnd a cheap way to put small payloads in orbit.

moderate damage, 5 consider­able damage, 6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a "major" earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a "great" quake, capable of tremendous damage. 
The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which oe­curred before the Hichter scale was devised, has been esti­mated at 8.3 on the Hichter seale. 


Armored vehicles enter Mexican state of Michoacan; opposition supporters ousted 
MEXICO CITY (AP) Armored vehicles rolled into Michoacan state as opposition supporters were ousted Thursday from city halls they had shut down in December to dramatize eleetion fraud charges against Mexico's ruling party. 
By midday there were reports that demonstrators from the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRO) had been dislodged from seven of the 17 city halls closed since the disputed December municipal elections. 
The army refused to ac­kn 
operation in the rugged farm­ing state known as a PRD stronghold. 
"We don't have any informa­tion on this. Absolutely noth­ing," said Second Lt. Jimenez, a Defense Department spokeswoman in Mexico City who declined to give her first name. 
A presidential spokesman who demanded anonymity said state judicial police had dis­lodged the demonstrators. He said the army did not take part. 
But a state spokesman said military police had removed demonstrators, some of whom were armed, from seven city halls and were on their way to an eighth by mid-afternoon. 
The spokesman, who de­manded anonymity, said 20 people were arrested.

Law students protest lack of minority faculty 
Law students around the country chanted, rallied, wore armbands and left class Thursday in the second annual protest of what they said is a lack of women and minorities on law school faculties. 
"Right now the situation is just horrendous," said Marie Arnold, a second-year student at Harvard Law School who helped organize a day of boycotts and picketing. 
Students at about 40 schools had planned to demonstrate in support of an agenda that included demands for more aggressive recruitment of black, Hispanic and female faculty members, Arnold said. 
Some students also demanded efforts to increase numbers of disabled and openly gay faculty, and sought changes in curricula to include a focus on women and minority issues. Students also wanted schools to enforce anti-discriminatory policies in handling law firms that recruit on campus. 
"These issues mean a great deal to the students," said Susan Szabo, who boycotted her classes at the University of California-Berkeley Law School, along with an estimated 135 others. 
"By striking, the students are taking a risk because the professors make rec­ommendations for jobs and the 
dean  picks  who  should  be  
clerks  for  Supreme  Court  
justices."  

The strikers demanded the 
hiring of five professors who 
would add to the diversity of 
the 96 percent white, 90 
percent male faculty of 55 
tenured professors. 
Berkeley Dean Jesse Choper said there is "no question about the need to continue to work hard to add outstanding women and minorities" to the faculty. 
But Choper questioned the strikers' suggestions for effecting change, saying he was opposed to racial or sexual quotas. 
Chanting "no diversity. no peace," some 130 Columbia University Law School students walked out of their classes, staging a sit-in on the first floor. 
There are two blacks and four women on tlw 50-member faculty at Columbia. Barbara Black, dean of the law school, stopped by and told the group she was headed to hnr ol'tiee to interview a woman for an opening at the school. 
Professor Subha Narasimhan told the protesters she believed in their political agenda. "Before I was at this end of it, I was at your end of it," Narasimhan said. 
In Cambridge, Mass., about 275 students boycotted classes, rallied on the Harvard campus and then stormed the office of Dean Robert Clark, the faculty dining room and the faculty lounge, but thcrn were no eonfrontations. 
phone interview from the state capital of Morelia, 150 miles northwest of Mexieo City. 
The PRD issued a statement saying there could be a "bloodbath" in Miehoaean. 
Ten people died in February and in March in neighboring Guerrero state during election fraud protests and the eviction by police of PHD supporters from occupied city halls. 
The PRD says· the ruling Institutional Hevolutionary Party or PHI. which has ruled Mexico 61 years, cheated it out of victory in the December elections in both states. 
Armored vehieles entered Michoaean Wednesday, accord­ing to witnesses and news re­ports. The action came the same day the PHI governor called on federal and state au­thorities to intervene if the PHI> did not rei' uish the city halls.

dispute on how to deal with Midwest concerns over acid

The measure now goes to the House lloor where it is Iikely to come up for debate
early next month. The committee cleared the legislation by a vote of 42-1. Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif., was the sole dissenter. Hep. John Dingell, D-Mich., the committee chairman, called the bill "significantly better" in protecting the en­vironment than a version approved by the Senate ear­lier in the week. The committee moved swiftly to approve the legis­lation after giving the nod to a compromise agreement aimed at easing concerns from Midwest congressmen over the high cost of acid rain controls. The acid rain compromise, worked out during three days of closed-door negotia­tions among committee members and staff, was ap­proved by a 39-4 vote, eras­ing the last major roadblock to committee passage of the bill. "The process has been rather curious," said Din­gell, alluding to the lengthy private negotiations that eased the committee through several obstacles. 
NEW YORK (AP) -Support for the reunification of East and West Germany is growing among Americans, with two out of three Americans saying they do not fear a united Germany, according to a New York Times-CBS News polL 
However. the poll published in Friday editions of the Times indieated that Americans are concerned about the economic might of a united Germany; nearly four out of 10 Americans worried that Germany would dominate the European economy. 
Forty-nine percent of those surveyed said a united Germany would not try to dominate Europe economically, while 36 percent believed that it would. 
Asked about the future of Germany, 76 percent of those surveyed said they favored uni­fication, an increase of 6 per­centage points from a similar survey in November. A majority, 67 percent, said they were not concerned that a united Germany would threaten peace, while 22 percent said they were worried it would.

U.S. must do battle in ,capitalist cold war 
/\mnrir.an influnncn and pownr is not what it once was. 
/\t tlw end of World War II, tlw Unitnd Statns creatnd al­most 50 pnrcent of the world's economic wealth; today that figure is down to 2:{ percent. Simultaneously, over the years /\mnriean political and strategic leadership has succumbed to centrifugal tendencies. In 1990, thern is no CENTO nor a SEATO nor really an /\NZUS. Only NATO is left intact. and /\nwrican influence in that or­ganization has been stretched to its limit. The only area whern the United States is more powerful than it was in 1945 is in tlw realm of pop culture. But Michael .Jackson T-shirts, blue jeans and Dallas reruns can hardly be equated with real influence. 
This loss of power would be acceptable if the United States had no other rivals for world l!ladnrship. But it has. Cnrtainly, onn of the threats is not the Soviet Union. That na­tion is currently in no position to exert authority internation­ally. It is not even clear whether it can do so internally. Clearly, the grnat communist threat has bnen dncisively marginalized. 
llowevnr, that leaves two otlwr real threats--Europe and Japan. Some Americans might be under the impression that Europnans and Japanese actu­ally appreeiate American post­war leadership. They do not. Old and proud civilizations as they are, they have always re­sented the upstart Americans.

"culture." 

The Japanese feel the same way. In the case of .Japan, there is a real contempt for America's multi-cultural diver­sity. Some Japanese, like former Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, seem to feel the mixing of different groups is a source of weakness, not strength. 
Add to this resentment of the United States the fact that both Europeans and .Japanese are aetively planning their own re­naissance. According to Hans­Jorg Rudloff, the chairman of Credit Swisse-First Boston. "The European challenge is to restore the Europe of 1914, when Europe was the biggest economic power in the world and had the best educated pop­ulation." No doubt Herr Rudloff would like to return to a world ruled by London, Paris, Berlin, and Moscow. Washington would be on the periphery. The European Community is Rudloffs point­man in the bid for restoration. 
And in Asia, Japan has emerged as the center of influ­ence and the model of affluence. Beyond some pop items, there is not an American product to be bought from Bangkok to Sapporo. You cannot buy an American car. /\II the cars and electronics are from Japan. The leading trading partner for ev­ery /\SEAN state, save the Philippines, is Japan. The Greater East Asian Co­Prospnrity Sphere is not a slo­gan; it exists. 
WherP does this leave the United States? Fir!?t. though some don't believe it, second­class status for America is not inevitable. Second, the United States must accept the objective realities of capitalist cold war and begin a counter-attack. 
Actually, the United States has already begun the counter­attack. The 1988 Free Trade Pact with Canada started it. The ultimate meaning of that pact, however, has only recently been exposed with the possible advent of United States­Mexican Free Trade talks. The idea is nothing less than to 
have one common market from the Yukon to the Yucatan. In other words, the giant conti­nent of North America may be moving toward economic, then political, consolidation. 
And what an immense power such an area would be. With a population of about 350 million and the land area of the Soviet Union, the combined force of the United States, Canada and Mexieo could easily match Europe and Japan. With the re­sources of Canada, the youth of Mexico and the industry of the United States, CAMEUS would breathe new life into the New World. 
It doesn't take a .Jean Monnet to visualize what American pol­icy should concentrate on. The United States must begin to spend more time developing close ties to Mexico City and Ottawa. Those two nations are our future. Thus, inter alia, the United States must be more conciliatory with Mexico on debt repayment. The United States must also listen to Canada's complaints regarding pollution. We can afford to be generous. Just because Europe and Japan want to marginalize the United States doesn't mean we should let them. We can shape our future. We should begin now.

LETTERS 

Students remain sheltered at NO 
Dear h'ditor: 
The letter by Brendan O'Shaughnessy printed last week (The Observer, March 27), clearly, and intelligently illus­trates how the disadvantages of parietals outweigh the ad­vantages. Unfortunately for the entire student body, O'Shaughnessy is indeed a bit naive for assuming that the administration would consider the abolition of parietals, even if the student body demon­strated considerable desire for doing so. Why? The University does not look at parietals as the hours of the day when the right to visit members of the opposite sex is suspended. Instead, they believe between the hours of 11 a.m. and midnight, and 2 a.m. on week­ends, they are granting students the "privilege" of visi­tation. Such an attitude obvi­ously assumes a narrow view of the maturity of the student body. 
Unfortunately, on every occa­sion that I have addressed a member of student government with possible plans for the re­peal of parietals, he or she has informed me that I was wasting my efforts even trying. I, like O'Shaughnessy, would like to believe this is not so. Parietals can become a thing of the past, but two things must occur. 
First, the students of Notre Dame must abandon their apa­thy. Never have I been any place wherP so many complain about so much, but do absolutely nothing about the problems at the sources of their complaints. I am not pointing any fingers. I am just as guilty of this as ev­erybody else. Yet, the energy spent whining about visitation hours could be channelled into constructive efforts against parietals. 
Second, both the students and the administratio,n must realize that the University of Notre Dame is not a piece of land in South Bend, Indiana, but is in­stead the studnnt body residing on that piece of land. Without us, the students, Notre Dame is nothing more than a collection of worthless buildings. We must stop allowing this University to parent us as though we are irresponsible children. We go away to college to leave the shelter of our par­ents and grow into individual, responsible beings, not to be parented by people whom we do not know, and have no previous relation with. The University can do more for its image by listening to the needs of stu­dents than by creating an envi­ronment which satisfies them.

Teaching is 'not a 9 to 5 job' 
MARC JOHNSON 
accent writer 

N 
otre Dame's "Year of the Family" can sometimes appear slightly hypocritical to a professor of the university, especially those with spouses who also teach. Such is the case of Professors Dennis and Noreen Moran. 
"The university is by nature intrusive into family," Dennis said. "It's not just ND. I would compare it to the situation that a doctor at a hospital faces." 
"Our work is our vocation not just our job," according to Noreen. "The university must just try to be caring to the needs of its professors." 
The Morans both teach Hu­manities Seminar at the fresh­man level, and Dennis says their conversations rarely cen­ter on the subject. "Our discus­sions are very nonanlytieal." he stated. 
"We may discuss what our students thought of [Joseph I Conrad, but more often our discussion turns to the general topics of the university," he said. 
Dennis Moran feels that both he and his wife have very strong opinions regarding aca­demic policy, but "we are both annoyed when we can't lind parking."

ong distance relationships can create many problems on the Notre Dame campus, but the difficulties are not only faced by the students. 
For many years Professors Lynwood Montell and Barbara Allen were forced to carry on a long distance marriage. Now both are professors at Notre Dame, and both are extremely pleased with their new situa­tion. 
Allen is an associate professor of American studies, and her husband, Montell, is now a visiting professor teaching in the American studies depart­ment. Professor Montell previ­ously taught at Western Ken­tucky University in Bowling Green. 
This situation created an in­teresting problem relating to commuter miles. Alternate weekends were spent in both states, but Allen and Montell now have the luxury of using their home in Kentucky for

Operation Rescue and the recruitment of smokers . 
The Committee on Notre 
Dame's Position on theRe­cruitment of Smokers-if you knock out the "P," then the acronym could be CINDERS-will hopefully hold its first meeting as a featured event of the Medjugorje Conference, at Notre Dame, May 12-13. 
Medjugorje happens to lie in the tobacco-growing region of Yugoslavia. The priests of St. James' Church in Medjugorje have promised, according to the promotionalliterature,that God will send rain to help the tobacco crop if the parishoners are faithful in attending church services. We hope that the vi­

.... sionary-will it be Vicka, Mar­ija, or Ivan?-who is expected to address the Conference will have a special word of comfort and encouragement for smok­ers. We already know that Our Lady of Medjugorje is on the side of smokers; was it not she who suggested that smokers give up their pleasant habit one day a week as a penance that would please her? Do you sup­pose Lou Holtz, as one of the featured speakers at the Con­ference, would help CINDERS by putting up signs that say,
"Thank you for Smoking"? 
At this point CINDERS is still on the drawing board, and Ahn Pettifer, an old-time smoker, I judge from what she has admit­ted in print, could become chairperson, if she cares about helping an endangered species. 
Incidentally, The Absurder story alleging Pettifer and me to be Siamese twins separated at hirth,should be read as a

letters to CJ lonely God 
• metaphor. As Woody Allen said, when spotted with Jackie Onas­sis at a New York opening, "We're merely good friends." I'm asking Father Tyson to make a statement that should take the silly gossip out of gen­eral circulation. 
CINDERS should begin with television spots showing the Marlboro Man in trouble, look­ing like Gabby Hayes, range-partner to Hopalong Cassidy. The voice-over could adapt the curtain speech from "Death of a Salesman:" 'Nobody dast blame this man. You don't understand: Willy was a smoker. Ahd for a smoker, there is no rock bottom to the life, once he's dangling a cigarette off his lip... 
'He don't put a bolt to a nut, 
he don't tell you the law or give you medicine, unlessen he can blow a smoke ring first. He's a man way out there in the blue, riding on a smile and a boot­shinre, drawing deep on fine tobacco. Ahd when they start not smiling back, because 
they're gasping for air from the sidestream effect-that's an earthquake. 
'Ahd then he gets himself a couple of spots on his white hat, and he's finished. A smoker is got to have his pack of butts to dream on, boy. It comes with the territory.' 
Or maybe the spot could show 
Dustin Hoffman, in a version of 
Shylock's speech, from "The 
n 
Merchant of Venice." 'Hath not 
a smoker eye? Hath not a 
smoker hands, organs, dimen­
sions, senses, affections, pas­
sions?' 
As a priest old enough to be saving for a headstone, why should I waste my time in de­fense of smoking? Maybe I'd rather be remembered for be­ing honest than for being in a state of grace when I die. 
The truth is, all the grownups on a college campus are trying to win the students to their ver­sion of the truth. Truth, how­ever, is illusive, and needs to be hedged in by distinctions. That's why I'm offended by the New York bishop who made headlines that were harder on his state's governor than the New Testament writers were on Pontius Pilate. 
You don't have to be much of a priest to be opposed to abor­tion. I'm not much of a priest, and I oppose abortion with all my heart and soul, and would do so even ifl weren't a priest. 
In a recent newspaper letter directed at me, a woman wrote, "In Operation Rescue, we're very gentle when we tell preg­nant women entering abortion clinics, 'Please, as a mother, don't kill your baby."' How would you measure gentleness that links "kill" with "baby" on the Richter scale? 
Not more than a dozen years ago, a married student woke me up on a Saturday morning to say, "During the night, my wife had a miscarriage." The wife was then in the' hospital. 
The student's question to me was what should he do with love's labor's lost, the evidence of the miscarriage? He had rescued it from the toilet and wrapped it in Kleenex, rather than flush it away. 
I never opened the Whitman's Sampler box, with the pathetic remains in it, which the student brought me on the back seat_of his car. Neither the undertaker nor the hospital had any inter­est in taking the box off my hands. 
As a priest who had married the couple because the bride was pregnant, I felt I had to honor those remains which, while quickened, had caused so much heartache. Wrapping that box in aluminum foil so that the dogs wouldn't disturb it, I buried it with a prayer at a friend's house, in a flower gar­den under a bed of chrysanthe­mums, to await the resurrec­tion. 
I can't tell you much about the evolving life terminated by Mother Nature, but whatever it was becoming, it wasn't a baby, but a life on the way to becom­ing a baby, which God called back. 
Maybe bishops, who identify embryos in via as babies, have God on their side, but in their sincere and passionate defense of the rights of the unborn, are they entitled to label Catholics who disagree with them as murderers in a class with the German soldiers who worked in the death camps the Jewish children were sent to? Theolog­ical hatred like that could be the death of the Catholic reb­

gion, if the Catholic religi~m mandated such an ugly view­point, which it doesn't. 
Now wimps like me are trying to launch CINDERS as a way of defending smoker's rights. Does that mean I have a vice that ~ want to wish on others? Not m the least! 
I am ticked, however, at laws that cut smokers off at the pass when they're using airlines. The Surgeon General has told us that smoking is one of the toughest kinds of addiction to shake free of. Will he be sur­prised when smokers, flying transcontinental, start hijacking the planes because they're not allowed to light up for hours and hours. 
Actually, CINDERS is a scare tactic. We could recruit new smokers, if we tried, and win back old smokers who say they have quit. How? Maybe we could persuade the Pope to is­sue an encyclical that declares smoking a sin like birth control. 
If, in addition to being ha­rassed as a smoker, I have to survive on a campus about to be swamped with the news of Medjugorje, I'm going to make it clmu-that Our Lady of Medju­gorje is on the side of us smok­ers. Just ask the visionaries or the priests at St. James. Maybe the great sign that's waited for in Mejugorje involves the rew~­lation that cigarettes are the sacrament of grace under pres­sure. 
Look for CINDERS at the Conference in May, under the big top at the JACC, or outside it, picketing like a New York bishop.

now an even larger component of our lives," said Mario. 
Notre Dame has never af­fected the Borellis' home in a negative manner, for Angela stayed with her son when he was young. She then started work in an adjunct position when her son started school. "He never was alone," said An­gel a. 
She said she understands that small children present difficult choices for a professor, but she is very satisfied with her indi­vidual choices. "The ideal situa­tion occurs when the family is grown," according to Angela. 
The Borellis say they experi­·ence no pressure from each other, and their situation does not lend itself to such circum­stances as to be jealous. They understand the difficulties that could arise, but say they are unaffected. 
The rigors of their profession do sometimes affect them. 

ing her current position. Ah-drew, meanwhile, remained in the department of sociology. 
As husband and wife who share the same workplace, Kathleen and Andrew Weigert are careful to keep their pro­fessionallives separate. "We make it a policy not to share every detail of our professional identities," according to Kath­leen. 
"There are just some things, particularly confidential mat­ters, that a husband and wife just don't need to talk about," she said. 
"There are some times we can pay attention to nothing else but our work," explained Mario. This situation very sel­dom occurs, and the Borellis feel that their profession has many more advantages than problems. "At times we cannot be located quickly, but that is the extent of our difficulties," said Mario. 
"I find it a great pleasure to share successes at Notre Dame with my husband," said Angela. "I feel that it is wonderful meeting so much of the student body with my husband.'~ She gave much of the credit to Notre Dame in particular rather than the university setting itself. 
Mario agreed that his at­tachment to Notre Dame is very deep. 
The Borellis have strong ties to their students and to the school at which they teach. Their dedication is refreshing, and their love for their students is obvious. Notre Dame perme­ates their lives in only positive ways, and the separation would be unwelcome on either side.

summers alone. "We only 
missed three weekends in all .our years," Montell stated 
proudly. 
Their situation has proved to be overwhelmingly positive. "The question of negatives is almost a non-issue," said Mon-tell. "We face the problems that any professionals might face." 
Allen and Montell also find the time commitment of teach­ing to be absolutely no diffi­culty. They often discuss new ideas with each other, and their results are highly productive. 


Moran 
continued from page 12 
His wife agrees that they dis­cuss actualities much less than might be expected. "You have your own place with your own courses. We do discuss theories but not specifics," she said. 
Since the Morans both teach the same courses, they often have the same calender stress. Finals week always proves to be a difficult time. "One of us cannot take a burden from the other, but we both are know)­edgeable of this," Noreen said. This mutual understanding of the problem can sometimes be enough to solve it. 
"Professionals take work home," said Dennis. "Teaching is not a 9 to 5 job." This irregu-Iarity is even more difficult when there are two profession­

"We have a great, big study desk in our home, and we often work facing each other," said Montell. 
Their discussion around this 

table has been very focused as 
of late, for Allen is working on 
a book regarding the history of 
gospel music, and Montell is 
working on a western narra­
tive. 
"I could remove my work from home, but I am a folk­lorist all the time," said Allen. She and her husband shave pent great amounts of time studying behavior. "We have immersed ourselves in it." 
Allen believes that others in much different fields behave in 
als in a household. Both part­ners are on equal footing , and there is no division of labor. If something needs to be done, ei­ther spouse will take care of the work. "Although I still won't wash the clothes," Dennis said. 
A professor spends much time working while his or her children do not necessarily view the results of such work. "At times the children of professors may seem disinterested, but they find that we have a vast resource of knowledge to of­fer," Noreen said. 
Although the Morans teach the same subject, they feel no competition or rivalry. Often in such relationships one spouse is in a subordinate position to the other, but the Morans agree that the couple will feel tension for the subordinate rather than rivalry for each other. 
They also agreed that a uni­versity should not necessarily much similar ways. "You need to get away from the routine, but the information is always there," she explained. 
Theoretically there could be competition in their relation­ship, but it is not present. Mon-tell joked that ''I'm on the tail • end of phasing out, but Ba~­bara is still on the way up. 
If this couple sounds pleased with their situation, it is be­cause they are. After a separa­tion of years, Notre Dame has provided Montell and Allen with a situation where they are al­lowed to do the work they love with the people they love. Mon-tell says that, "it's the ideal sit­uation; I can't criticize." May we all have it so good. 
hire spouses to keep a family together. 
Noreen Moran is an adjunct professor of English while Pro­fessor Dennis Moran is the managing editor of Review of Politics. Noreen Moran was initially hired as a part-time teacher, but like many adjunct professors, she retains her part-time status even though she teaches full time. 
Dennis Moran teaches as a professional specialist and does not function in a research ca­pacity. He is not attached to any specific college and has taught a variety of subjects. 
While the rigors of teaching can prove very demanding on time and energy, the Morans feel that it is worth it. Dennis Moran stated the situation most eloquently. "It's much bet­ter to be crazy together than alone."

Men's volleyball proves its point in victory 
Some things in life just can't be explained. 
Take for instance, the fact that the Notre Dame men's volleyball is still a club sport. The women's track team felt they deserved varsity status and next year they'll get their wish. So why not men's volleyball? Why haven't Dick Rosenthal and the Athletic Department taken a good look at this program? Are they worried about money? It certainly wouldn't cost more than what will be spent on women's track. 
Coach Bill Anderson spends hours of time with his team and he doesn't get paid: not one thin dime. But he isn't concerned about himself; he simply feels that his team has worked hard and has shown it can play, thus meriting a serious look. 
Maybe the Athletic Department could forego providing the football team with that tenth pair of shoes. 
The team pulled off their biggest win of the year last night by upsetting varsity squad Graceland College 13· 15,15-9,7-15,15-13,17-16. 
"This is the biggest win I've had here," commented Anderson. "Right now, I'm

the happiest coach world." Senior hitter  in the Andy  

Sullivan,whose missile-like kills were a key to the Irish victory, echoed the same sentiments. 
"That's the greatest come­back I've ever been in," he said." "Beating a varsity team like that, this is the highlight of my volleyball ca­reer." 
The Irish found themselves trailing 2-1 in games, but fought to a tough 15-13 win in game four. The fifth game used a rally scoring system, meaning there are no side­outs; the team that wins the point gets one on the score­board. The Yellowjackets zoomed out to a 4-0 lead, but the Irish started to make a comeback as a Sullivan kill made it 7-3. Grace land went ahead 11-5, but Pedro Nemalceff put down a tip to keep the Irish hopes alive. 
"We knew we could come­back," said Nemalceff. "We just had to hang tough. We believed in ourselves and did it." 
The Irish found themselves down 14-8 and one point away from a loss. With Nemalceff serving the Irish climbed the mountain to tie it.Tom Martin teamed with first Sullivan and then Dave Bose for key blocks. Mike Sheedy made an incredible save followed by a Sullivan kill to make it 14-13. After it was tied, Graceland went ahead 15-14. 
The Irish would not be de­nied, as Nemalceff set Sheedy for a kill that tied it at 15. A passing error by Graceland put the Irish one point away, but the Yellowjackets put down a kill for another tie. The game was now to be decided by the next point because of the 17 point limit on the fifth game in college volleyball. Graceland had its best server, Brad Senesac, at the back line, but Anderson called two consecutive time­outs. 
Tom Martin received the 
serve,  passed  it  to  
Nemalceff.  and  then  
pounded  the  set  by  the  

Graceland team for the victory.

Women's tennis to face three foes with Barton out of lineup 
By BARBARA MORAN Sports Writer 
The Notrl' Dame women's tennis team will head out on the road again this weekend in an attempt to better its 12-6 record without the services of top playPr Tracy Barton. The team will start off the weekend today at home against Northern Il!inois before head­ing east to face Ball State on Saturday and Ohio State on Sunday. 
Northern Illinois is expected to offer little challenge for the Irish, according to Notre Dame coach Jay Louderback. 
"They didn't do really well early in the year, but lately they've been playing a little bet­ter," said the coach. "If we just go out and play well we shouldn't have any problem." 
Louderback had comparable expectations for the Ball State match.

Irish hope to play some baseball

Bookstore basketball action continued yesterday  at Stepan Courts.

Assistant Sports Editor 
Notre Dame is looking to play some baseball. 
It sounds like a simple enough desire, like this could be done with relatively little diffi­culty in a country permitting much greater freedoms than playing baseball, but the Irish have been unable to compete due to poor conditions, either in air or on the field. 
All that may change this weekend. as Midwestern Collegiate Conference opponent Dayton visits for a pair of dou­bleheaders. The twin bills are scheduled for 12 p.m. on Saturday and 1 p.m. on Sunday. The Irish have a tentative ar­rangement to make up one of the games they have missed by playing at Illinois-Chicago tonight, if weather permits. 
The arrangement is tentative because the doubleheader at Illinois-Chicago scheduled for Wednesday was cancelled, and the pair of games slated for Tuesday in South Bend's Coveleski Stadium were also nixed. In their last 13 scheduled games, the Irish have played four. 
But Head Coach Pat Murphy 

ND lacrosse records fourth straight triumph; Denison visits Krause for weekend matchup 

By DAVE DIETEMAN 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame lacrosse team, which faces midwestern rival Denison on Saturday, ex­tended its winning streak to four games with an 11-3 road win over the Kenyon College Lords on Wednesday afternoon. 
For the Irish, whose upped their record to 6-3, Wednesday's game against Kenyon was the culmination of many hours of practice and rigorous game experiences. 
"This was our best and most consistent effort," said Notre Dame head coach Kevin Corrigan. "We played very well defensively, we had good goal­keeping, and our offense was patient against their zone de­fense." 
The Irish were not only able 

.. to adapt to the careful strategy of the rival Lords. Notre Dame also managed to dictate the tempo of the game to the Kenyon squad en route to its fourth win in a row. 
is turning adversity into advan­tage by getting the most out of the idle time while it lasts. 
"We've been practicing in­doors during these rainouts, letting the other teams worry about the weather," said Murphy. "We're using this time as an opportunity to get better, because we know that later on in the season we're not going to have as much time to practice. 
"All these games will be made up, without missing a class. We've got 44 games to play and we're going to get them in, and so we're going to be playing a lot of baseball in the next four weeks." 
The Dayton Flyers will be the first opponents to meet the Irish, who last played on March 31 against Saint Louis, in a week. Dayton brings in a 6-16 record for the season and a 8­18 overall record against the Irish. Last year the Flyers beat the Irish twice in nine games. 
Dayton's pitching staff has improved greatly since last year. Currently the team's earned run average is 3.60, compared to a stratospheric 
8.61 ERA for the season last year. Flyer ace Jeff Pollock is 3­1 with a 1.54 ERA, with his 
Kevin Corrigan 
"We really forced them to play man to man with us, which was to our advantage," ex­plained coach Corrigan. "We played very well all around." 
But the Irish will barely have time to savor the results of their efforts before they must square off with midwestern ri­val Denison on Saturday at 
1:30 p.m. at Moose Krause Stadium. 
Denison, 6-2 this season de­spite a demanding schedule, is spectable teams such as Cincinnati, Miami (Ohio) and Toledo. fellow starter Tony Miller is 0-1 with a 1.58 ERA. 

"Dayton is a much improved club," said Murphy. "Just look at the teams they've beaten. Pollock is one of the best pitch­ers in the conference, and it's going to be a big challenge for us. (Head Coachl Mark Schlemmer has done an unbe­lievable job. They are not intim­idated by Notre Dame by any stretch of the imagination." 
The drawback for Dayton at this time is hitting. Aside from junior left fielder Rob Bostico, who has been outstanding so far in hitting exactly .400, no one on the team is hitting above the .300 mark. The team bat­ting average is .236. 
Tonight the Flyers play a doubleheader with Toledo be­fore traveling to Notre Dame. 
Expected starters for the Irish are senior Brian Piotrowicz (3-2, 2.43 ERA) and freshman Pat Leahy (2-0, 1.51 ERA) on Saturday and fresh­man Alan Walania (0-0, 3.72 ERA) and sophomore Joe Binkiewicz (2-0, 2.81 ERA) on Sunday. 

Anemic shooters advance in Bookstore

Members of She's Cotta Have 
It and Gus and Ethel might be 
able to use the three-day break 
in Bookstore Basketball XIX to 
rest their arms. 
Those two teams advanced to 
the second round Thursday 
afternoon despite horrendous 
shooting outings. She's Gotta 
Have It downed La Polla 
Records 21-16, while Gus and 
Ethel routed The Fella She 
Owes and Four Other Suckers 
21-5. 
Gus and Ethel found the hoop 
on 21 of their 7 4 field goal 
tries, while The Fella She Owes 
and Four Other Suckers were 
5-of-52 from the field. The two 
teams shot shot a combined 20 
percent (26-of-1261.

"Denison is a team that can score a lot of goals," noted Irish head coach Kevin Corrigan. "There are only two games this season where they didn't score in double figures; both those times they scored 
9." 
But once again, Notre Dame remains optimistic. thanks largely to a defensive corps that has been tested in the hottest offensive fires. 
"The key for us is that we hold them down," stated coach Corrigan, "because they have given up some goals as well as scored some. We just need to stop them from scoring. Their team is always well-balanced, but their offense is key for them. More than anything, we need to play good defense." 
"Most importantly, we need fans out there," concluded coach Corrigan. "This is a good team, and we'd like to see a lot of fans there on Saturday."

Dan Manier led She's Cotta Have It with eight points, while Glenn Landers tossed in seven. 
No gamBs are scheduled this weekend because of senior formal in Chicago. Action will resume on 10 courts Monday afternoon at 4 p.m. 
In one of two overtime con­tests, Pants Without Zippers edged 288-STOP by a 23-21 count behind the 11 points of Mike Navarro. The winners trailed 12-8 but battled back to take a 19-17 lead before 288­Stop tied it at 19. 
"We just didn't give up," Navarro said. "We kept fighting back. We're a decent team. I hope to at least make the final 128 and maybe the final 64. If we get a couple of breaks. maybe even the final 32."
