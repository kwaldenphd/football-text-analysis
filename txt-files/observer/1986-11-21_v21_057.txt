Reagan aide says Roe may be reversed 
By CHRIS JULKA Copy Editor 
The 1973 Supreme Court Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion on demand, could be reversed within two years, Special Assistant to President Reagan for Public Liaison Carl Ander­son said in a lecture Thursday. 
"With the appointment of Scalia and Rehnquist, the Supreme Court is now split between four justices who favor the reversal of the Roe v. Wade decision and four who still support it, with Jus­tice Powell being a swing vote. Within the next two years Roe could be gone." 
Anderson said the Democrat­controlled Senate, which must approve all presidential appointees to the Su­preme Court, does not pose an insur­mountable obstacle. "We could look to the Senate for respected thinkers or lawyers who might serve as candidates if we ever get to a very close vote: maybe Orrin Hatch, Laxalt, or former Senator Jim Buckley." 
This, said Anderson, is because the Senate, unlike the House, is a fairly close-knit group, "like a club." There-
Parts-plant strike may force total OM plant shutdown 
Associated Press 
DETROIT -Negotiators returned to the bargaining table Thursday to work at ending a critical parts-plant strike that soon may force the nation's largest automaker to shut down nearly all of its assembly plants. 
"If the strike goes -well, not even too much longer ­we will be completely shut down," General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger Smith said late Wednesday. 
GM on Thursday laid off 33,350 workers until further notice in Michigan, Ken­tucky, Missouri, Ohio, Kansas, Delaware and New Jersey due to parts shortages caused by the 7,700-worker strike at a Delco Electronics plant in Kokom.o, Ind., GM spokes­man John Mueller said. 
About 16,700 of the workers were told not to report for work starting Thursday and the rest were told not to report starting Friday, Mueller said. 
Further assembly line shutdowns were expected among GM's 35 North Amer­ican assembly plants later Thursday, but many plant managers and spokesmen said they believed they could keep working until the end of the week. 
"We're all prepared to get laid off tomorrow," said Bill Bowers, president of United Auto Workers union Local 1112 at the 8,000-worker Lordstown, Ohio, complex. 
Talks resumed Thursday morning between represen­tatives of striking UAW local 292, the UAW international, GM and Delco Electronics. No further information was available on progress of the discussions, said GM spokesman John Mueller. 
The talks were moved to Detroit Wednesday so both sides could have easy access to information they might need, said UAW spokesman Bob Barbee. 
The Kokomo plant workers have been on strike since Monday, when talks failed to resolve a dispute over subcontracting of some jobs and transfer of radio production to Mexico. 
The plant makes and ships electronic parts such as radios, heat sensors and on­board computer components on a "just-in-time" basis as they are ordered, so little or no inventory of the parts ex­isted when the strike began. 
It took little more than 24 hours for the parts shortage

CLC approves proposals, extends Sunday parietals 
By CHRIS BEDNARSKI Assistant News Editor 
Proposals extending the parameters for parietals until 
12:30 a.m. on Sundays and clar­ifying the penalty for overnight parietals violations were passed yesterday by the Campus Life Council. 
The proposals will now be forwarded to Vice President for Student Affairs Father David Tyson, who must give his approval for them to take ef­fect, according to student senator and Chairman of the Student Senate Committee on Parietals Brian Holst. 
AIESEC holds reception at mayor's office 
Special to The Observer 
A mayoral reception was held Thursday at South Bend Mayor Roger Parent's office by the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's chapter of AIESEC in honor of its two international trainees from Belgium and Poland. 
Michelle Curtin, president of the AIESEC at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's, opened the reception with a welcome note to all present, followed by a 
Holst said Tyson  must  act  
within  seven  days  on  the  
proposals.  

The reason for extending parietals an extra half hour on Sunday, Holst said, is to accom­odate "co-ed receptions" after hall masses. "It allows stu­dents to relax and socialize after mass in one another's rooms," he said. 
"We're not viewing this as a foothold for further change," Holst said. We're not trying to change parietals a half hour at a time." 
The Council defeated a pro­posal to push daily parietals back to 10 a.m. 
brief description of AIESEC and its goals. 
AIESEC is the French acronym for the International Association of Sludents in Eco­nomics and Business Manage­ment. AIESEC operates in more than 440 universities and 64 countries worldwide. Notre Dame and Saint' Mary's have been a member of the group since 1968. · 
AIESEC functions through an International Traineeship Exchange Program, in which AIESEC members around the world raise jobs for associated foreign students in their local business communities. The traineeship offered by par­ticipating companies range from six weeks to 18 months. By hiring foreign AIESEC trainees, the company gives American students the oppor­tunity to apply for a traineeship abroad. This reciprocity is unique to AIESEC. 
Curtih's introduction was fol­lowed by a speech by Mayor 
see AIESEC, page 6 
According to the parietals violation proposal, an over­night parietals violation will still be considered "a serious violation of the University Rules and Regulations." The proposal, if enacted, would make a policy that says ''The penalty for an overnight parie­tals violation by itself does not normally constitute suspension or dismissal." 
The proposal distinguishes an overnight parietals viola­tion from a violation of the sexuality code. "An overnight parietals violation in no way

'Willie W onka' is a sweet charm for every audience 

I saw "Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Fac­tory" last night. I love that movie. I have seen it about four times and have enjoyed it a little more each viewing. 
I first saw "Willie Wonka" when I was pretty young (pretty young is that grey area of youth between first grade and high school that tends to get greyer as our collegiate minds get hazier). I think it may have been the first time I ever thought the movie version was better than the book. 
The crowd was great at the movie last night. Everyone cheered when old Charlie found out he was going to see the chocolate factory. Of course, everyone knew Charlie was going to make it; the fun was simply in pulling for the underdog, an old, familiar one at that. 
A movie from childhood is like an old friend. When you first see it, you look forward to seeing it as often as you can. Then, as time goes on, you grow up and lose touch, burying the memory somewhere in one of the deepest, but warmest, cockles of the heart. 
Coming across one of these movies is cer­tainly a treat. It is not very often that one gets a chance to leave the books and pressures aside, even for an old friend; there is so much work to be done at the end of the semester. Time, whom we sometimes tend to ignore, has a way of sneaking up behind us and tapping us on the shoulder with a crowbar. Even though I think I am pretty busy, I could have never justified missing Willie Wonka last night; it has been such a long time since I saw the film; I had to blow the dust off of my memories. 
There are a lot of movies like "Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" in almost every­one's past. "The Wizard of Oz" and "Old Yel­ler" leap to mind when I think of these types of movies. There are also the TV shows; The Grinch and Rudolph will soon be causing college students everywhere to put aside studying for impending finals at least for a couple of hours. 
For a show to hold an entire generation cap­tive to its memory is quite a feat. Those of us in college are presented daily with the marvels of technology; video games and computers are as much a part of our lives as automobiles were to our parents' lives. A movie or a television show must possess a special spark of life, a soul of sorts, to keep us coming back to it whenever our sentimental memories are jogged. 
Kevin Becker 
Managing Editor 

As far as I am concerned, "Willie Wonka ..." fits the above bill perfectly. It has a certain charm to it that wraps up the audience into one overly-sensitized heap and hurls it into an in­escapable fantasyland, allowing all of its mem­bers to feel like little kids and not be ashamed. 
Gene Wilder is great as Willie Wonka. He plays the lunatic quite well. Ever since I first saw the movie, I hated when Willie yelled at Charlie and told him that he got "nothing!". Charlie is such a good kid; I think we may all secretly want to be him in the movie. Of course, even though he is abused by Willie, he returns the Everlasting Gobstopper and becomes the heir to Willie's candy kingdom. 
The ending to "Willie Wonka and the Choco­late Factory" holds claim to a cutesy charisma that is not so sweet as to make us choke on its simplicity. When we were kids the moral of the story may have been honesty is the best policy. Now that we are old enough to know about the benefits of honesty, the moral may be some­what different for all of us. But for me, the moral is to never forget what wonderful things the dreams, and movies, of youth are made of.

More than 100,000 join Left in Philippine political display 1 
I 
Associated Press 
MANILA, Philippines -More than 100,000 people joined the funeral procession of slain labor leader Rolando Olalia on Thursday in the biggest display by the political left since a com­munist rebellion began 17 years ago. 
At a stop about 500 yards from President Corazon Aquino's office in Malacanang Palace, speakers urged her to use the left in confronting rightist challenges from Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile or loyalists of former President Ferdinand Marcos, who fled the country last February. 
Enrile, who also was defense minister under Marcos, has been outspoken in criticizing government policy. Rumors of coup plots by his supporters in the army have filled the city. 
About 50,000 people followed a truck carrying the caskets of Olalia, 52, and his driver, Leonor Alay-ay, in a day-long procession that was largely peaceful. It wound for 12 miles from suburbs to the downtown district. 
An equal number lined the route, many chanting "Revolu­tion! Revolution! " "Long Live the Communist Party of the Philippines!" and slogans de­manding Enrile's ouster. 
Riot police were deployed in the city but kept away from the procession. 
Many people wore T -shirts bearing the hammer and sickle symbol of the outlawed Com­munist Party of the Philip­pines. Party pamphlets accus­ing Enrile of Olalia 's murder circulated in the crowds. 
Olalia, 52-year-old leader of the Partido Bayan (People's Party) and the militant May 1st movement labor federation, and Alay-ay were kidnapped and murdered last week. 
The large funeral crowd heartened leftist leaders, but it also was expected to increase apprehension among conserva­tives and the military about the growing power of the left.

fore, despite all its partisan divisions, the senate is likely to approve one of its own mem­bers, according to Anderson. 
Anderson said the reversal of the 1973 Supreme Court deci­sion, which struck down a Texas statute protecting human life from the instant of conception, would return the abortion issue to state legisla­tures. 
This, Anderson said, would recognize "the wisdom of Jus­tice Holmes when he reminded us that the state 'legislatures are the ultimate guardians of the liberties and welfare of the people in quite as great degree as the courts.' " 
Anderson also quoted Judge Noonan's book A Private Choice: " 'The liberty estab­lished by the abortion cases has no foundation in the Constitu­tion of the United States .... Its establishment was il­legitimate and unprincipled, the imposition of the personal beliefs of seven justices on the women and men of fifty states. The continuation of the liberty is a continuing affront to con­stitutional government in this country.' " 
Anderson added that the con­sensus in the Supreme Court in 1973 as well as today in no way corresponds to the "reality in the country." 
In support of this view, An­derson cited referendums and and elections prior to Roe v. Wade which ushered in repeals of relaxed abortion statutes by margins sometimes as high as two to one. 
The reversal of Roe v. Wade also would reaffirm the Four­teenth Amendment, said An­derson. 
"The drafters of the Four­teenth Amendment used both

"Drugs and sex violations 

are morally incorrect actions. 
An overnight violation by itself, 
does not involve a moral 
issue," Holst said. 
Associate Vice President for 

Residence Life John Goldrick, 
said the proposals do not con­

"I think it will be a positive act of communication to spell it out this way because I think there is tremendous confusion about the principles. Even if it was no change... it would be a value," said Father Gerald Lardner, Grace Hall rector. 
The defeated proposal at­tempted to push parietals back to 10 a.m. every day. Visitation hours are currently set in DuLac at 11 a.m., and 10 a.m. on home football Saturdays. 
Holst said this proposal would allow students more time to study and socialize in the morning. "Most students are up by 10 a.m.," he said. 
the terms 'person' and 'citizen.' It is only the latter term which. is clearly condi­tioned on birth in order to au­tomatically claim the privileges and immunities of American citizenship. By use of the broader term 'person,' the drafters intended to offer a broad protection, including the protection of life, to those indi­viduals who did not meet the requirement of citizenship." 
Anderson cited the Federal Constitutional Court of West Germany as an example of a court taking an expansive view of the right-to-life provision in its Constitution. According to this court, said Anderson, ''since 'the protection of human life, one of the central values of the legal order', was in­volved in the question of abor­tion, there were 'limits' to 'legislative freedom of decision 
'" 

Just as the Fourteenth Amendment came in response to slavery in America, so the West German court acknowl­edged that its right-to-life Con­stitutional provision is '' 'a re­action to the ... final solution and to liquidations which were carried out by the National Socialistic Regime,' "said An­derson. In the same way, he said, "I would suggest that in its response to our national ex­perience of Roe v. Wade and its aftermath of nearly 15 mil­lion abortions, the Supreme Court -perhaps only gradually will also move to adopt an ex­pansive protection of life for human beings after birth." 
Anderson said, however, "the Supreme Court will not be able to step backward to the pre-Roe status quo. 
The lecture, which was held in the Law Building, was spon­sored by the Thomas J. White Center on Law and Govern­ment.

Soviets pass new law to permit self-employment 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW -The Supreme So­viet on Wednesday approved a law allowing citizens to moon­light as self-employed taxi drivers, restauranteurs and repairmen to earn extra cash in the socialist economy. 
The new Jaw follows up on Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbac­hev's effort to bolster con­sumer services plagued by shortages of both goods and manpower. 
It will legitimize some ser­vices already in high demand on the illegal market, which provides such consumer ser­vices as car repair. 
TJ:ie Jaw, which takes effect May 1, is the first to loosen prohibitions against free enter­prise since 1921, when Lenin in­troduced the New Economic Policy to cope with the eco­nomic chaos following the civil war. Most of those programs were phased out by the 1930s. 
The new law has yet to be published, but its provisions were outlined at the closing ses­sion of the fall Supreme Soviet

Any Soviet citizen 18 years or older will be allowed to propose individual enterprtses to make up local shortages, and local of­ficials would decide whether there was a need for the goods or services, Gladky said.

Cigarettes kill 350,000 Americans a year, afflicting victims with cancer, heart dis­ease, emphysema and other ailments, according to the cancer society. It holds the smokeout to encourage the na­tion's 54 million smokers to stop. 
A post-smokeout Gallup poll last year found that 23 million smokers had cut down for the day, and the society expected more participation this year, said Karen Crowe, spokes­woman for the society in New York. In 1980, she said, a sur­vey found that one million of the 1979 smokeout participants still were not smoking a year later. 
"It takes a long time to quit, and this is just the start," Ms. Crowe said. "A lot of the smokeout events are upbeat be­cause it really doesn't pay to nag at a smoker, or to say you're going to die. We want to be more positive, to show the benefits of quitting." 
One immediate payoff was available in Yakima, Wash., where Alder's Chevron offered gasoline for 50 cents a gallon to smokers willing to surrender a pack. "We did it for public awareness," said station manager Kevin Garratt. "But people are more interested in the gas at the discount." 
Other inducements to cut down included free chewing gum, peanuts, apples and even cold-turkey sandwiches offered at businesses and hospitals across the country. There was a pep rally in downtown Den­ver, a smoke-free fashion show in Gainesville, Fla., and a smokeout comedy show in San Francisco. 
A cigarette manufacturer, Philip Morris, tried to counter the smokeout by circulating what it called the "Great American Smoker's Kit," in­cluding stickers that read: "don't nag me I'm A great American Smoker.''

Associated Press 
WASHINGTON The Federal Aviation Administra­tion ordered airlines Thursday to inspect nearly 100 Lockheed L-1011 jetliners for possible cracking in the wing after a fracture was found in one of the Delta Air Lines wide-body jets. 
The FAA action was taken after the National Transporta­tion Safety Board, investigat­ing the Delta incident, raised concern about possible metal fatigue in the wing support beams of the L-1011 jets and urged an "immediate inspec­tion" of the planes. 
The FAA directive requires inspection within 50 flying hours, or about a week, of the wing supports, or spars, on the wide-body jets if they have had at least 10,000 takeoffs and lan­dings, said agency spokesman Fred Farrar. 
There are about 112 of the Lockheed L-lOlls being flown by U.S. airlines and almost all 

Khomeini denounces Iranian officials for softening toward United States 
Associatt>d Press 
NICOSIA, Cyprus -Iran's revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on Thursday ruled out reconcilia­tion with Washington and said any Iranian officials who seek things from these people," Khomeini, 86, said in a speech at his residence in north Teh­ran. His remarks were broad­cast by Tehran radio and mon­itored in Nicosia.

of them are owned by Delta, Eastern Airlines and Trans World Airlines. At least 93 of the planes would likely fall un­der the inspection provision, of­ficials said. 
Farrar and airline industry representatives said the in­spections are likely to have little impact on airline flights. Spokesmen for Delta and Eas­tern have said that the required inspections have been com­pleted or are underway. A TWA spokesman said its inspections would begin late Thursday or early Friday. 
The NTSB, meanwhile, was to conduct metallurgical tests on the wing support of the Delta plane in hopes of determining what caused the crack, accor­ding to safety board sources, who spoke on the condition they not be identified by name. 
The Delta jet, Flight 194, was landing at the Newark Interna­tional Airport on Aug. 13 when the airport tower informed the crew that smoke was coming from the right wing landing gear area. All of the crew and passengers left the plane safe­ly. 
But upon inspection, the crew found the smoke actually was fuel vapors and that fuel was leaking from the right wing tank, according to the safety board. NTSB investigators later found the crack in the rear support beam near the fuel tank inlet valve as well as "substantial damage" to the wing and fuel tank. 
Initially the crew filed a "hard landing" report, but NTSB investigators said an analysis of the flight data recorder and witness reports have discounted that as a likely cause of the crack. At best there was a "firm landing" well within the stress limits of the L-1011, one source close to the investigation said. 
At Eastern Airlines, spokes­man Glenn Parsons said 12 of its 25 L-1011s were inspected with no indications of cracking and the rest will be inspected by Friday evening. 


on contacts between Washing­ton and Tehran. 
He also urged unity within Iran's revolutionary leader­ship, in which Western obser­vers recently have reported deep divisions. 
Without mentioning names, Khomeini criticized Iranian leaders who publicly have dem­onstrated flexibility towards the United States in recent weeks. He accused them offal-ling prey to propaganda from the White House, which he called the "Black House." 
President Reagan disclosed last week that the United States had secret diplomatic contacts with Iran over the past 18 months and delivered small amounts of defensive weapons in a bid to improve relations.

Everyone must share 
responsibility for club Dear Editor: 
As student leaders, we try to provide social activities that are enjoyable and promote unity within our respective classes. However, the classes cannot provide social functions every night for everybody, and therefore, the need for an undergraduate club was realized. Construction moved imperceptibly slow, but finally Theodore's has emerged as an exciting permanent so­cial alternative. The University pro­vided Theodore's in response to the stu­dents' needs. 
While many students have enjoyed the club's offerings in a responsible and yet entertaining manner, a few have not. This abuse of our club, in our stu­dent center, must stop. Everybody must be personally responsible for their own actions. Destruction of Theodore's will remove the only permanent social alternative on campus. If there are in­dividuals among us that cannot use and maintain community property then they must be removed from the facility. So if you see someone abusing our club, please remember that it is your club and act appropriately. Stop the van­dalism, or approach a manager about the problem Help take care of Ted's! 
We empathize with the managers and workers at Theodore's. They volunteer their time and abilities to serve their friends. They should not have to act as policemen or bouncers. So let's ALL use Theodore's in a common purpose. Let's have fun.

Dame's mecca for responsible student gatherings--Theodores's. Five bands were supposed to play in a Campus Band Jam at the club when the Student Activities office pulled the rug out from under them. The M.E.C. was notified three days before the scheduled date that they could no longer use Theodore's. 
Theodore's had been promised to the 
M.E.C. and it was taken away. That was after big bucks had been spent on publicity and production. Your money, from your activities fee, was wasted. It was poor decision-making in the Stu­dent Activities office. A solution could have been found to keep Theodore's open and still address the club's long­term interest in stopping abuse. Secur­ity could have been increased and re­pairs scheduled at more convenient times. 
We are sorry that a more serious ef­fort was not put into making the right choice on how to handle the damages to Theodore's.

Moral outrage should include our own nation 
Dear Editor: 

Kevin Smant stated recently in a let­ter to the editor that "anti-apartheid zealots" have been negligent in their duty to expand the range of their con­cern to include those persons living un­der the " most tyrannical system of governments in existence today" (he's referring to Nicaraguans here, in case this fact escapes you). Well, it appears as if our friendly neighborhood zealots are not the only ones suffering from moral myopia these days. Since Mr. Smant obviously has no qualms about castigating those who mean well but suffer from tunnel vision, may I con­tinue this venerable tradition by focus­ing the spotlight yet elsewhere? 
Where is your moral outrage against a nation which, after having opened the "new frontier", mythologized the genocide of an indigenous people? And where is your moral indignation 
against  an  economic  system  that  
knowingly  produces  defective  and  
hazardous  wares  (remember  the  

Pinto?) on the grounds that the money 
saved by not redesigning the product will more than compensate for the es­timated expense incurred by impend­ing lawsuit settlements? The list could go on, but you get the point. Or do you?

Student wants weekly schedule of functions 
Dear Editor: 

In an effort to make student life com­patible :nith the more important func­tions of the University, I request that The Observer include a weekly column of where access to certain campus facilities is limited due to special events. The column should include all campus buildings and parking areas. This would allow students, especially those who have to drive in from off­campus, to make better use of their time by scheduling their day-to-day ac­tivities to coincide with the times when student facilities are available to stu­dents. 
On another note, a recent letter to The Observer struck a chord with me. It would seem that on the day following the showing of a film in the engineering building, an instructor found the smell emanating from some empty beer con­tainers to his distaste. The tone of the letter was that the privilege of using the facility would be taken away if the problem continued. I can empathize with the instructor. On the days follow­ing a home football game, off-campus students are greeted with parking areas strewn with broken glass. All the glass is either brown or green. Believe me, the sound of air hissing out of my tires can be as nauseating as the smell of stale beer. Perhaps the football fans should be threatened with loss of the use of our parking lots if they continue to bring alcoholic beverages to the games. This would unfortunately means that the usual University rules pertaining to alcohol would have to be extended to home football games, which would be out of keeping with the purpose of Notre Dame. A reasonable alternative would be to hire a platoon of stalwart youths to patrol the parking lots with brooms after the games and remove the glass. In return, we stu­dents could agree to take our empties with us when we leave the engineering building.

Student praises letter on pathway to peace 
Dear Editor: 

I'd like to commend Pete Morgan for his refreshing and sensitive examina­tion of the pathway to world peace in his guest column of Wednesday, Nov. 
19. Pete spoke my mind for me in his column and I won't waste space by repeating his statements. Just read the column for yourself -it's pretty inter­esting. 
By the way, Pete, you're right. Your ideas are silly and idealistic, but you are very wise. Thanks again, Pete.

Indiana's Alford heads list of stars on pre-season All-America team 
Associated Press 
Steve Alford is the only mem­ber of the 1984 U.S. Olympic team still playing college bas­ketball and he is the only re­turning first-team All­American from last season. 
So, it really wasn't surprising when the senior guard from In­diana was named yesterday to the Associated Press pre­season All-America team. 
Joining Alford on the team, chosen by the same nationwide panel of sportswriters and broadcasters that choose the weekly Top Twenty teams, were David Robinson of Navy, Danny Manning of Kansas, Kenny Smith of North Carolina and Pervis Ellison of Louis­ville. 
Robinson, who led the nation in rebounding and blocked shots last season as a junior, was named on 63 of the 66 bal­lots. Alford and Manning both were named on 59 ballots, while Smith had 49 votes and Ellison 36. 
Georgetown's Reggie Wil­liams, who was named on 25 ballots, and UCLA's Reggie Miller, named on 13, were the only other players named on more than 10 ballots. 
Alford averaged 22.5 points per game last season and that number could rise with the ad­dition of the three-point field goal this season, a pure jump shooter's dream. 
Alford enters the season having made 56 percent of his field goal attempts, while shooting 90 percent from the free throw line. 
Robinson led Navy to a 30-5 record last season and an ap­pearance in the Final Eight of the NCAA tournament. 
"I want to get stronger in­side, go to the basket more ag­gressively, improve my jump shot," Robinson said of the up­coming season. "I expect a lot more of myself this year. I feel like I can be the best." 
He already holds the NCAA record for blocked shots in a game, 14; season, 207, and career, 372. He can join Lew Alcindor of UCLA, now Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Patrick Ewing of Georgetown as the only players to score 2,100 points, grab 1,300 rebounds and shoot better than 60 percent from the floor. 
Manning, a second-team All­American last season, had a sophomore season that will be hard to top. The 6-foot-11 for­ward averaged 16.7 points and 
6.3 rebounds per game last season, while making 80 steals and blocking 46 shots. 
Ellison was named Most Out­standing Player of the Final Four as Louisville won the na­tional championship last season. The 6-9 sophomore averaged 13.1 points and 8.2 rebounds for the Cardinals.

Lulu(Melanle Griffith) picks up Charley(Jeff Daniels) as well as the tab In "Something Wild." 
DON SEYMOUR reatures writer 

"Something Wild" is an unpredictable, offbeat thriller that should not be mis­taken for another teen exploitation nick. 

Movie review 
Something Wild 
****(outof tour) 
Directed by Jonathan Demme ("Stop Making Sense," "Melvin and Howard"). it is a well-made, well-acted, funny, intelli­gent and thoroughly enjoyable 111m. In fact, it is everything that most films lack. 
Charley(Jeff Daniels) is a yuppie tax consultant who is caught running out on a check in a New York City diner by an odd freespirit named Lulu (Melanie Grif­fith). She offers to give him a ride back to work, but instead brings him on a wild weekend adventure that he will never for­get. What happens is continually surpris­ingand funny, but to divulge it here would destroy the fun of the movie. Leave it to say that things become kinky and violent; and that Charley and Lulu must run for their lives before the climax. 
Jeff Daniels ("Terms of Endearment," "Purple Rose of Cairo") does a good job as a nerdy, nervous, but not entirely in­nocent man whose life has gone beyond his control. Melanie Griffith is flaky as the offbeat Lulu and Ray Liotta makes a stun­ning motion picture debut as the villain. His portrayal is chilling, insidious and horrifying. 
The film obviously addresses itself to yuppies and other middle-of-the-road suburbanites, calling them to examine their lives, goals and values. It asks whe­ther the safe road is necessarily the hap­piest. The events of the film are not in­tended to be a model of the alternative lifestyle--they are far too violent and bizarre for ttiat--but a spark for Charley's, and the viewer's imagination, to unearth those gnawing dreams and de/)ires that have been repressed under the need to succeed. For some, the film can be un­
settling. It comes to no conclusions, but Charley does leave his job at the end, suggesting that we all need 'something wild' to wake us up. 
Jonathan Demme's direction is con­trolled and assured. There are very few wrong shots. He tells his story with a crispness uncommon in most of today's muddy films. The witty and unpredictable script was written by recent New York Unl­veristy graduate E. Max Frye; this is his first step into Hollywood. 
"Something Wild" should be the surprise hit of the fall. It's erlJoyable and compelling in showing its offbeat vision.

Happy Thanksgiving

The Observer -November 21, 1986

Christianity: A quiet existence behind The Curtain 
MARK MELLETT features writer 
Sitting In his warm office in Elkhart, Ind., Georgi Vins vividly describes the cold life of the re· llgious ministry In his homeland, the Soviet Union. He recounts children receiving religious in· struction under the cover of the woods and the poor living con­ditions of the prison camp Yakutlya in Siberia. Though his account of the situation sounds hopeless, Vins finds hope In God. 
In 1979, Vins was exiled to the United States after being ex­changed with four other prisoners of conscience for two Soviet spies. Since that time he has established the International Representation for the Council of Evangelical Baptist Churches of the Soviet Union. Through this organization Vins seeks to in· form Christians in the West of the religious situation in the So­viet Union and to warn them of the danger of atheism. 
It has been seven years since you were exiled from the Soviet Union. From your correspon· dences, how has the religious situation changed In this time? 
Very little has changed In the past seven years because the So· viet Union is an atheistic country. Soviet propaganda, newpapers and forms of mass media con· tinue their work against the church, against faith in God and slandering Christians. The most Important point Is that the Soviet authorities do not want to let children or teenagers into churches. The Soviet govern­ment is not changing. and their goal is to create a society without God, an anti-religious society. 
How are the members of your church In the Soviet Union prac­ticing their faith today? 
In the Soviet Union there are 2000 independant Evangelical Baptist Christian Baptist churches, and they are very ac· tive throughout the whole country. They don't hide when they meet for worship because they want other people to come. So they meet in private homes and sometimes In the forest. When they are having a worship service, for example, they'll leave the windows open. Then they'll sing. They'll preach. Everything ·is done openly. The children's and youth ministries, however, 
are secret. 
Within the Soviet constitution we are permitted, supposedly permitted the freedom of con· science and freedom ofworship. So there are no actual laws that say you cannot believe In God, that you cannot preach or hold a worship service. But the prob· lem Is that the authorities don't abide by their own laws. For ex· ample, the constitution says freedom of conscience. but that is explained in a certain way. It says that only adults over 18 years of age have freedom of conscience so that children and teenagers do not have the right. It also says that you are free to confess your faith, but the Soviet authorities interpret that to mean you are free to express your faith as long as you do not attract anybody else to your belief. 
There Is no book store In the country where you can purchase a Bible or a New Testament. People need Bibles. They need Christian books. The Soviet con­stitution guarantees freedom of the press. So according to the constitution we should be able to print Bibles or any type of scripture that we want. But you have to understand that in the system all the printing houses belong to the government. So the Christians basically invented their own printing presses and now they print Bibles and New Testaments. It has all been done secretly. 
The secret police are seachlng for those printing teams. But ac­tually there Is no law that they can accuse the Christians of breaking because there Is no law that says that you cannot print Bibles. They are accusing these Christians, who are printing Bibles up, of conducting a busi­ness or private enterprise. That is against the law. So they are printing Bibles and are accused of making a business of it. 
In what ways are the children receiving religious instruction? 
Soviet schools are atheistic and so children are taught at school that there is no God. But the Christian families raise their children In a Christian spirit to believe in God. It's part of the educational program that there Is no God. Actually there Is a sub­
ject that you take at school and it is Marxist-Leninist materialistic philosophy. It is taught at all levels. 
What tactics do the Soviets use to stop illegal functions? 
There are many different methods. The police would come to a meeting and break It up. Sometimes they fine the people who are there and violently dis­perse the meeting by beating people and throwing them out­side if It is winter. Sometimes they are not given their coats or boots. They are just shoved out­side. Many times they are ar­rested for a very short term, I 0 or 15 days. Key leaders are ar­rested and sentenced to long years in labor camps. There are many different ways that It is done. 
From your experience in the prison camp Yakutlya In Siberia, how are the present prisoners of conscience being treated? 
The Soviet prisoners are forced to work. In the country there are many prisoners, about five mlltlon together. Most of them are men and there is a whole Industry that is built upon the labor camps, for example the lumber industry. The work Is I 0 to 12 hours a day, and if you don't meet your work quota per day then you are punished by re­ceiving less food, which Is ter­rible anyway. 
When you get less of it and you are already sick It just completely undermines your health. The conditions are also horrible. It's very cold. You are not warmly dressed. The footwear Is not like heavy boots. Then there Is great isolation as they keep you from your family. Your family Is al­lowed to visit only once a year for two or three days. The food at the camps is terrible. Of course the family would like to supplement the prisoner's diet but they're allowed only to send one food parcel a year and It can­not weigh more than 10 pounds. 
The purpose Is supposedly for rehabilitation. This Includes reeducating the prisoner. After work the prisoners attend lec­tures on Marxism and Leninism. So after working In the cold, I 0 to 12 hours. and returning home exhausted you are not allowed to rest. Instead, you go to an at· heistlc lecture for an hour or longer. 
How is your organization fur· therlng and supporting the Reform Baptist movement In the Soviet Union? 
I was appointed to be the offi­cial representative of those 2000 churches. So the main goal is to represent the persecuted Chris· tians in the Soviet Union before the world-wide community of Christians. My organization Is their voice in the West. Then there Is the area of the ministry that we call "defense" which means that all the news that we get from the Soviet Union Is brought to the attention of Chris·

tians around the world through the press and through news let­ters to seek their prayer support and their petitions or interven­tions on behalf of those who are suffering. 
We maintain very close secret contacts with the Christians in the Soviet Union. So we have very current information on every­thing that is taking place with the Christians in the Soviet Union. We usually know when some­body is arrested or moved to an­other camp, If they are undergo­ing especially terrible hardships and the conditions of the camps. 
One of the main ways to sup­port the work over there Is to heIp supply things that are needed by the Christian's publishing house and to aid the prisoners' families with material support. We supply clothing. shoes, whatever is needed, and it is all done secret­ly. Another thing we do Is publish literature such as the Gospel of John. It is printed on synthetic paper. It isn't ruined by water or humidity. We deliver these to the Soviet Union in great quantities, and they are used for witnessing and sharing the Gospel and the plan of salvation. 
The thing to keep in mind is the Soviet Union has been athies­tic for about 69 years now. At­heism robs people. It takes away the Bible. It tries to take away God, but it doesn't offer anything in exchange. Basically, the people are tired of atheism and 
its hopeless system. It doesn't offer ideals to strive towards. The people in our country are search­ing for something spiritual. 
In your brochures you urge Americans and the Western world In general to take neces­sary action to radically Improve the situation of believers In the Soviet Union. By what means has the West changed the reli­gious situation In the Soviet Union In the past and how can It be done today?

viet Union. She said that the En­glish government was going to do something. They would inter­vene on the behalf of persecuted Christians, and she asked specif­ically for one man that she could speak out about. We see the result because Pastor Baturin is now free. 
When I met with President Reagan several years ago at the White House, he said that the 
U.S. government would also speak out on the behalf of per­secuted Christians in the Soviet Union. And it's not only govern­ments that are involved and are well informed but there are churches and individuals who are very active in writing peti­tions, in keeping their represen­tatives and congressmen in­formed about what is going on, and also people are very fervent in praying for those who are suf­fering. 
Do you think the Soviet Union will react In an unfavorable way to Western pressure? 
I don't think so. The Soviet government is very sensitive to Western opinion including the Christians in the West. I had been sentenced to 10 years imprison­ment. Thanks to the involvement of Christians in the West I was released half way through the term. 
Why do you think the Soviets exiled you when they could have checked your present opera­tions by continuing incarcera­tion? 
I think that you are right. But the question wasn't just about me personally. It was about five prisoners who were very well known in the West. Two Soviet spies had been caught and they were each sentenced to 50 years. The Soviets were willing to pay any price in order to get those men out ofAmerica. My case was with President Jimmy Carter seven years ago. To answer the question why was I one of the men chosen, I think perhaps it had to do with President Carter being a Baptist and I being a Bap­tist. But I'm not sure about that.

Kurtis Blow blew it 
TIM ADAMS features writer 
Poor Kurtis Blow. In the time since his last album, America, was released, Run-D.M.C. offand made themselves what may be the best rap record ever, Raising t-lell. Up until that time, Blow was reasonably able to maintain pace with most of the new crop of rap stars.

Kurtis Blow 

Grandmaster Flash totally fell apart with the defection of Melle Mel from his camp, and Whodini and the Fat Boys, though they both released their best records in 1984, displayed neither the consistency nor the inventive­ness to leave Blow in the dust. And Run-D.M.C.. who shot out of th~ starting gate with a kicker of a debut album, faltered on their King of Rock album, because ap­parently they couldn't decide whether to be a rap group or a rock group. 
Thus Blow managed to create decent records which captured a sizeable portion of the rap audi­ence, without any tremendous effort on his part. Things be changing. though, and if today·s rap connoisseurs have been keeping their cars functioning. they're going to realize that Kingdom Blow, the latest offer­ing from the "King of Rap," is pretty darn boring. 
Maybe you could call this record the start of a new sub­genre of street music: Yuprap. After all, it's got the slick yet "grit­ty" "Miami Vice" influenced sound, a guest rap by Bob Dylan 
(I) and a nice, tame attitude.­Break out the coolers, dudes, we got ourselves a party. Well, let them eat Blow; I'll take DMC anyday. 
Part of Blow's problem is that he clings too tightly to his admit­tedly well-deserved reputation as one of rap's forefathers. That's why, in a song like "Kingdom Blow" where Blow takes potshots at all up-and-corning rappers, he comes across more like a guy with a "sour grapes" attitude than somebody who is honestly proud of his past and current ac­complishments. He further dis­tances himself from rap's current movers and shakers in "''m Chit­lin' " simply by using the word "chill" instead of the preferred, hipper tag "ill." Funny thing is, even though Blow refuses to modernize his vocabulary to keep on top of things, he main­tains he's still number one. Yeah, right. 
All is not bad with this album, though. Simplicity rewards itself in "Sunshine" and the good­timey instrumental. "Unity Party Jam," and there's even a decent. if silly, love song. "Reasons for Wanting You." Still, these bright

But during certain songs you can feel the sarcasm and bitterness that made The Clash so volatile. And if I was to point a finger, I wouldn't look past Strummer.

Pete Gillen paid his dues. He was at Villanova for x amount of years. He was at VMI. He coached high school. He coached in way that, all of a sudden, its now his turn turn to go. Gary was back here for at least five or six years as an as­sistant. He was ready for it and I think Iona is the perfect sit­uation for Gary.

I think all those things will fall in line because we've al­ways had good people come in to represent the university as assistants on and off the court and that's why I think we're at­tractive, especially with Proposition 48 now into effect.

We're the one institution that's built its own China wall and resisted the temptation from boosters and alumni to try to control the athletic scene vs. people in the right perspective, saying you're a student first and an athlete second.

We want students to be ac­cepted who have got the back­ground, and make them com­petitive once they get here, like Kenny Barlow.

Timmy Kempton, through everything he had to go through as far as the students getting on him and everything else, he and I knew that there was a shot for him in the NBA and that was the most important thing once he got through with basketball at Notre Dame and that's why h~'s with the Clippers. He's there. He could get cut tomor­row, he could get cut next year, but the fact is he did that, and at the same time he could be a stockbroker in Boston any time he wants. The same with Jimmy Dolan. He's going to travel for a while to get basket­ball out of his system, maybe go to Europe, but he knows he's got a couple job offers when he comes back.

Volleyball team winds up big year against Northern Ill. and Purdue 

By BRIAN O'GARA Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame volleyball team finishes up its best season ever with a 4:30 p.m. match against Northern Illinois this after-noon in the ACC Pit and a road finale at Purdue tomor­row evening in a 7:00p.m. con­test. 
The Irish defeated Eastern Michigan 15-8, 15-10, Il-15, 15-8 on Wednesday evening to bring ·their season record to 32-6 and notch their 16th consecutive victory. One down, two to go before the Irish end their season and wait for a call from the NCAA tournament selec­tion committee. A tournament bid would be the first ever for Notre Dame volleyball. 
The Irish came out strong against Eastern Michigan to take the first two games of the evening. With Irish Coach Art Lambert out of town on family business, Assistant Coach Patty Hagemeyer was at the helm in the Irish victory. 
"The first two games we played consistently. We served very well and they didn't have a chance to get into their game," said Hagemeyer. 
The Hurons came back, however, to take advan-tage of a lack of concentration by the Irish and take the third game, 15-11. Notre Dame rallied in the fourth game to put the Hurons away with a a decisive 15-8 win. 
"It (the win) was easier than the scores indicate," added Hagemeyer, who noted her team's strong defensive perfor­mance. The Irish recorded an impressive 24 block assists and three solo blocks to stifle the Eastern Michigan offensive at­tack. 
Notre Dame also played a 
solid offensive match, led by 
sophomores Mary Kay Waller 
and Maureen Shea. Waller, 
ranked ninth in the nation for 
kill per-centage, recorded 17 
kills and Shea added 11 kills. 
Today the Irish face another challenge with their match against Northern Illinois in the ACC Pit. This will be the last home match of the season for the Irish, who defeated Nor­thern Illinois in October, 5-15, 15-6, 15-9, 15-9.

"I would hope we could make it easier on ourselves this time," said Hagemeyer. "But I assume that they are better than they were a month ago." 
Maybe, but so are the Irish who are 26-2 since September 20 and last weekend won the North Star Invitational by sweeping four opponents in 24 hours. 
On Saturday the Irish travel to Purdue for their final regular-season match of the year. The Boiler-makers will be a difficult foe for the season finale. Earlier this season, in the Hoosier Classic here at Notre Dame, Purdue rolled over the Irish in three consecu­tive games to win the tourna­ment. But there is a great deal of hope for the much-improved Irish. 
"This is a very big match," said Hagemeyer. "They have had an up-and-down season. They lost their best player to a knee injury and they've had to shuffle their team around. But they took Illinois (1st in the Big Ten) to five games and they can play when they want to play. They will not take us easi­ly." 
SportVision of Ch1cago will televise the Notre Dame­Northern Illinois match on Sat­urday at 7 p.m. The ND-Purdue contest will also be broadcast by SportsVision on Monday, November 24, at 8 p.m. 

The Observer/ Robert Jones Mary Kay Waller and the Notre Dame volleyball team are looking for an NCAA tournament bid. The 32-6 Irish will face Northern Illinois this afternoon. Brian 0' Gara has all the details in his

ing efficiency. His primary tar­get, Tim Brown, continues to prove that he is among the na­tion's best offensive players, standing third in the country in all-purpose yards, averaging 
169.9 per game. 
A steadily-improving defense, led by senior captain and inside linebacker Mike Kovaleski !68 tackles), will be tested once again, especially in the secondary. LSU averages better than 230 yards per game passing. 
While the Tigers look toward a New Year's Day Bowl, Holtz is looking to survive the last two weeks of the season. After LSU, the Irish head to Califor­nia to take on USC.

"We have two giant obstacles ahead of us," Holtz said. "We're playing two of the bet­ter teams in the country and we're playing them both on the road. We haven't even given any thought to the bowl games and, as far as I'm concerned, the bowl-game issue is dead. 
"I think we have a top-20 foot­ball team. I've felt for the last four weeks we've been as good as anybody in the country. We are a good football team and there are going to be a lot of football teams in bowl games worse than we are, but it doesn't matter. 
"Are we down right now?" Holtz asked. "You're dog-gone right we're down. It's really been difficult because I felt we could beat Penn State, even if they played really well. We had some key mistakes hurt us. It's like having a little brush fire and pouring gasoline on it, hoping to put it out."

Women's swimmers to test depth against tough Northern Michigan 
By THERESA KELLY Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's swim team will travel with the men's team to Ferris State this weekend, but the Irish women will take on Northern Mic. higan. 
Saturday's competition will be the first dual meet between the schools, and Coach Tim Welsh says he is hoping his team will be ready for some top-notch competition. 
"Northern Michigan will be extraordinarily difficult to beat," says Welsh. "The meet will definitely be our strongest challenge before Christmas." 
At last year's Midwestern In­dependents Swimming and Diving Championships, Nor­thern Michigan placed second, beating the third place Notre Dame team by a wide margin, 542·404. 
Although a few very strong individual swimmers can be the key to success in large meets, team depth will be the important factor in this dual meet. 
"Our fastest three or four swimmers are probably equal to theirs," says Welsh of his op­ponent. "Winning the meet will come down to our depth versus their depth." 
Northern Michigan changed head coaches after last season, and Welsh says it is difficult to determine how the team will have changed under new direc­tion. One apparent change in the Irish competition is in the distance freestyle races. Nor­thern Michigan did not enter distance freestyle swimmers in last year's Midwestern In­dependents Championship, but in a recent meet against Mic­higan State, the team's strongest events were the dis­tance freestyle. 
Northern Michigan is very strong in both short freestyle and the diving events. The team's top diver has already qualified for the regional com­petition in February. 
The young Notre Dame team is coming off an impressive performance at the Notre Dame relays. Coach Welsh says he expects excellent per­formances from all of his team members again this week. 
"Our training has gone really well. We have had excellent results in the pool recently." 
A strong team effort is the key to proving the Irish depth and beating the strong Nor­thern Michigan swimmers on Saturday. 
Allen's TD ron gives Raiders win 
Associated Press 
SAN DIEGO -Marcus Allen ran 28 yards for a touchdown 
8: 33 into overtime last night to rally the Los Angeles Raiders to a 37-31 NFL victory over the San Diego Chargers. 
The Raiders, winning for the eighth time in nine games since an 0-3 start, drove 56 yards in five plays on their second pos­session of the overtime period. A key play in the drive was a 28-yard pass completion from Jim Plunkett to Todd Christen­sen that moved the ball to the San Diego 38. Allen ran for 10 yards to the 28 and, after an incompletion, Allen scooted around right end, broke a couple of tackles and carried two Chargers into the end zone for the winning score. 
The Raiders, stung by San Diego's second-half rally from a 21·point deficit, had a chance to win the game with seven seconds to play in regulation. But Chris Bahr's 35-yard field goal attempt was blocked by rookie lineman Jeff Walker, who had blocked two kicks already this season. 
Although the kick was at­tempted on second down and the Raiders recovered the ball, officials didn't allow Bahr a second attempt because time had expired. 
Reserve quarterback Mark Herrmann guided the Chargers 66 yards in eight plays for the tying score.
