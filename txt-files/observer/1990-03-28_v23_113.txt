Soviet military takes over fifth Lithuanian building1 as Washington urges rest1raint 
VILNIUS. U.S.S.R. (AP) ­Lithuania's leaders on Tuesday angrily accused Moscow of "im~xcusable aggression" and of kidnapping its citizens after SoviPt troops stormed two hos­pitals in a harsh roundup of army deserters. 
Later. the KrPmlin ordered all fon~igrwrs to leave the republic, whieh declared independence March 11. Soviet troops occu­piPd a fifth Communist Party building in Vilnius. the capital. 
Washington and other for­Pign governments urged re­straint but avoided attacking Soviet President Mikhail Gor­barhev. who faces growing in­dependenc£~ movements in sev­eral republics as he tries to in­stitute reform. 
The Bush administration, in d1~dining to denounce Moscow, said it did not want to "inflame the situation." 
Soviet officials defended their 
actions  and  condemned  the  
Lithuanians'  aspirations  as  
dangerous.  

"Even Vice President Quayle admitted the other day there should be some discipline in the army." Sergei Chetverikov. minister-counselor at the Soviet Embassy, said at a news con­ference in Washington. 
Quayle said Saturday the So­viets should not threaten Lithuania but added that "if the Soviet Union is applying disci­plinary measures to people in their own military, that's a dif­ferent situation." 
In a furious letter to Gor­bachPv. Lithuania's president. Vytautas Landsbergis, and prime minister, Kazimera Prunskiene, said their govern­ment "demands the return· of it:; kidnapped citizens." They also urged negotiations with Moscow "in neutral territory." 
Both Landsbergis and Prun­skiene said Gorbachev had re­fused their calls. 
Soviet soldiers stormed two hospitals before dawn Tuesday and seized 23 Lithuanian de­serters who had sought refuge, the official Tass news agency said. Lithuanian television said two genuine mental patients were accidentally seized but that the soldiers let them go later. 
Witnesses said some desert­ers were beaten as they were taken from a run-down psychi­atric hospital in Vilnius. A trail of blood led down the steps and out the front door of the hospi­tal. 
"They beat them with their fists," said a duty nurse at the hospital, where windows and iron beds were broken. 
Gorbachev has called Lithua­nia's independence declaration invalid and last week ordered Lithuanians to turn in their weapons and stop signing up with a volunteer militia. 
He had promised not to use force unless lives were endan­gered in the Baltic republic, which the Soviet Union forcibly annexed along with Latvia and Estonia in 1940. But military authorities had warned Lithua­nia they would use force to capture deserters if the men had not returned voluntarily by last Saturday. 
In addition to storming the hospitals, Soviet troops Tues­day took over the Communist Party headquarters in the cen­ter of Vilnius. It was the fifth party building Soviet forces have seized in the republic since the weekend. 
Vladislav Shved, a leader of ·the Lithuanian Communist Party faction loyal to Moscow, indicated on the nightly news program "Vremya" that the troops were acting directly on the faction's request. 
When the government started to turn party offices over to other groups, "we had to take measures to protect our prop­erty," he said.

Candidates for other three districtswin unopposed 
By PETER LOFTUS Assistant News Editor 
Joe Wilson defeated Richard Delevan in the District Four Student Senate race and Mike Gaffney was victorious over John Brislin in the District Three elections, held Tuesday. 
Wilson captured 814 votes 
(72.3 percent) to Delevan's 312 
(27.7 percent), out of a total of 1,126 votes. Gaffney received 463 (51.2 percent) votes to Brislin's 441 (48.8 percent), out of a total of 904 votes. 
Elections were not held in Districts One, Two, and Five because unopposed candidates ran. The new senators in those districts are: 
•District 
One: Billy Allen, a freshman from Alumni Hall. 

•District 
Two: Lisa Bostwick, a junior from Walsh Hall. 

•District 
Five: Mark Bettencourt and Stephen 


Leinenweber, who will serve as Off-Campus Co-Presidents. 
''I'm glad the race is over," said Wilson, a freshman from Grace Hall. ''I'm anxious to get to work." 
"I plan on opening up a lot of communication with everyone in the district," said Wilson, re­ferring to what he said was one of the first things he needed to do. "''m ready to get to work for the district." 
Improvements in the safety and convenience of the D-2 Parking Lot are also on the top of Wilson's agenda once he takes office on April 1. 
''I'd like to thank the people who voted for me," said Gaffney, a junior from Zahm Hall. "It was a very good, clean race. And that speaks well for John (Brislin) and me." 
Gaffney said he would like to set up a North Quad council, consisting of eight to twelve students from his district that would represent "as many dif­ferent subgroups of students as possible." The council would help give him a greater idea of issues he might otherwise be "less in touch with." 
The proposed Bill of University and Student Relations is another item that Gaffney would like to work on once he takes office. He said that it is an issue that should be resolved by the year's end. 
Wilson won a majority vote in every dorm in District Four, the strongest support coming from Knott Hall (84 percent) and Pasquerilla East (82 percent). 
The race was much closer in District Three, with each can­didate winning three dorms. Gaffney's strongest suppor~ came from Farley Hall (76 per­cent) and Brislin's top dorm was Cavanaugh Hall (78 per­cent).

NO not 'proactive' toward disabled 
By SANDRA WIEGAND Assistant News Editor 
The Notre Dame campus is not adequately equipped for people with disabilities, accord­ing to graduate student Sue Murphy. 
Murphy, who lives in O'Hara­Grace graduate student resi­dences, uses a wheelchair. 
"I think they're making steps," she said, "but they have a long way to go." 
Murphy suggested that when students with disabilities first enter ND they should be given a publication showing where ac­cessible entrances to all build­ings are located. 
As the situation stands, she said, it is basically left to the initiative of the student with a disability to contact the office of the coordinator for disabled students and find out the nec­essary information. 
The administration is "more 
t ~.isabilities ~wareness
e s~od;,,~~,~~ 
reactive as opposed to pro-ac­tive," Murphy said. 
She described the work being done by Eileen Kolman, who is spending her first year at ND as coordinator for disabled students this year, as "a step in the right direction." 
Murphy pointed out the irony in the fact that Kolman's office is located on the second floor of the Administration Building ­which has no elevator. Kolman is very willing to arrange to meet with students with disabil­ities elsewhere, though, Murphy said. 
Winter in South Bend is diffi­
cult for students with mobility­
related disabilities, Murphy 
said, but the University has been very good about clearing snow from paths in the areas she needs to go. She said she has never had occasion to use the cart service on campus, but is aware of its existence. 
Other problems have arisen because of the weather, though, she said. For example, in Hag­gar Hall, students with disabili­ties must take a lift to reach the elevator, and sometimes the lift is frozen, she said. 
Murphy said she has missed class for this reason before, and also when she could not find a parking space because unauthorized people had parked in the handicapped spaces. 
Her professors have been very reasonable when she has had such problems, Murphy said. 
Murphy lived in Siegfried Hall last year, and said that five or six times during the first

Castro Hall a blight to America 
Sorin College the Fidel Castro Inter­national Center, a proposed housing op­tion at Dartmouth College which could prove to be the uni­versity's most callous 

and radical move 
yet. MONICA Y ANT 
The Castro !louse 

may become a reality, Asst. News Editor 
after members of Dartmouth's Interna­
tional Students Association voted last 
month to propose to change the name of 
their student center from the Nathan Lord 
House. Evidently the students felt Castro 
warrants greater admiration than Lord, the 
sixth president of their school. 

"The International Students house should 
be renamed after Fidel Castro because he 
embodies our sentiments for being in soli­
darity with the struggles in the Third 
World," said a senior in the school's news­
paper. 

Are we talking about the same Fidel Cas­
tro'! The communist dictator whose puppet 
strings are controlled by the Soviet Union? 
The man whose regime, according to an ar­
ticle in Conservative Chronicle, has more po­
litical prisoners, per capita, than any dicta­
torship in the world? 

llow could this man possibly be worth 
even the breath expelled uttering his name, 
let alone the commemoration of his atroci­
ties on a university building? 

Amazingly enough, the proposed name­
change raised few eyebrows at Dartmouth. 
Is this to say that a major United States 
university favors such a blatantly un-Ameri­
can decision, or just that the students at 
Dartmouth. known to lean slightly to the 
lnft anyway, simply don't care? 

.Just the thought of living in the house is nauseating. And since the house is for in­ternational students, I have to wonder how students from Cuba and equally-oppressed nations would feel about living under Cas­tro's roof. 
Dartmouth might as well not stop there. Why, the school could initiate changing other buildings' names as well. !low about The Ceausescu Hall of Social Studies? The Marx-Engels Economics Wing? Perhaps they'd prefer The Hitler Center for Jewish Studies? 
What Dartmouth has shown us is that so­cial injustice can prevail over social justice if the issue is trendy enough. They were quick to jump on the "Third World con­cerns" bandwagon, so quick that they for­got about the world they around them. 
In renaming their international house after a monster like Castro, these students will build up only their own social egos, and nothing else. 
Sorry Dartmouth. Notre Dame has more class than to trash a former university president in favor of a Cuban bully. Take your pseudo-social consciences to Castro. Word on the streets is that he needs all the help he can get.

AIDS education on the college campus is no longer an issue, the new challenge is converting knowledge to responsible ac­tion, according to Dr. Richard Keeling. 
Keeling, president of the AIDS Task Force for American College Health Association, said that polls taken at American universities show that "people who already know haven't con­sistently taken the precautions to prevent contraction of the disease." 
A poll taken at Bradford Col­lege, he said, showed that 87 percent of the males were hav­ing sexual intercourse, 78 per­cent of the females were, but only 53 percent of those polled said they had used a condom during their last intercourse. 
People have a "wait and see" attitude about AIDS, Keeling said. partially because of the long latency period of the dis­ease. 
"If you look among young people you get a distorted pic­ture." he said, "because the av­erage diagnosis age is 32, and the average latency period is ten years." 
Keeling described the disease as an "iceberg," because "You have a feeling that there's something hidden; what you see is not what you get." 
By 1994 or 1995, Keeling said, AIDS will be the highest cause of death for people be­tween the ages of 17 and 25 in the United States. 
People used to wonder if they should be tested for AIDS, he said, "People would say 'Why would you want to know?'. The question now is, do you want a 
fighting chance?" 
Keeling said that given the ef­fects early diagnosis can have on combatting the disease, it is important to find out as soon as possible if one is infected with the virus. The timing of the test as well as safety pre­cautions should be taken into consideration when one is tested, he added. 
The best time to be tested is 12 to 18 months after a per­son's most recent possible ex­posure, Keeling said. If one is tested prior to this, he may get· misleading negative results be­cause of the latency period of · the disease, he said. 
Safety precautions that should be taken, he said, in­clude social safety from dis­crimination, and psychological safety in the form of counseling and support services. 
"The experience of being tested is very hard," he said, "People must look back on old experiences and confront the past." 
In his study of college cam­puses, Keeling said, college students showed a feeling of not being at risk. Four assump­tions were very common, he said: 
•A sense of invulnerability 
•Stereotypes 
of people who have AIDS 

•A 
perception of time which leads students to think only of today 

•Absence 
of evidence of the disease 


Communication is a vital part of preventing contraction of AIDS, Keeling said. A poll taken at California University and UCLA showed that 52 percent of women said getting to know a male partner was a major precaution, but 60 percent said they believed that men had lied to them in order to get them to have sex. Of men, 35 percent admitted to having told such lies. 
"People say know more about your sexual partners, but no­body tells you how," Keeling said. 
It is important to talk to partners not about the disease itself, he said, but about your own desires. Self-esteem is very important, he said, stressing "internal," rather than "external," esteem. 
He spoke of the emphasis on external self-esteem that cul­ture in the U.S. gives, demand­ing that one try to become bet­ter or different than what he is and suggesting that a person is measured by "the sum of the numbers that describe him." 
Alcohol advertisements, especially, have an emphasis on sex, he said, pointing out that most cases of unwanted sex oc­cur when people are under the influence of alcohol. "What is not in the ads is the truth or the consequences," he said. 
"When you are drunk, you have sex with people you wouldn't normally have lunch with," he added. 
"Simple-minded solutions like 'Just say no won't work," he said, as there is a complex set of factors which influence a person's actions. "We may say 'Just say no,' but what do we do? Our culture says something different," he said. 
People should keep in mind that "the future is more impor­tant than anything that could

happen in the next 20 minutes," he said. 
Community support is verv important in getting people to act responsibly, Keeling said. At a Catholic university like Notre Dame, he said, the ad­ministration should give out in­formation without necessarily 
advocating,  for  example,  the  
use of condoms.  
"The  Catholic  Church  has  

been putting their heads in the ground," he said, "The Public 
Health Department simply looks at it as disease preven­tion. The Catholic Church con­flicts tremendously." 
The ideal situation, he said, would be a Catholic university acknowledging doctrinal issues, but also encouraging personal responsibility. Keeling said that he felt there are a lot of fun­damental things which the Catholic Church could relate to in the stance of the Public Health Department.

Contra demobilization mandatory for transfer
American Red Cross 

of power, says Ortega 
calls demobilization of the U.S.­backed Contra rebels "an essential element" for handing over the government. 
It says the new government will have control of the leftist Sandinista army and police and that only these institutions should have combat weapons. 
The document also says the conservative Chamorro gov­ernment will respect the rights of thousands of people given confiscated land and homes during a decade of revolution­ary Sandinista rule. 
The Sandinistas have bt>en handing out thousand of weapons to civilians since their Feb. 25 election defeat and have been urging people to de­fend the "conquests of thP revolution." 
They also have indicated an unwillingness to turn over con­trol of the armed forces and police as long as the Contras remain an armed force. 
The protocol says thP army and the police will be non-par­tisan organizations. 
The accord was announced late Tuesday by the leaders of the transition teams -Defense Minister Gen. Humberto Ortega of the Sandinistas and Antonio Lacayo of Chamorro's United National Opposition coalition, or UNO. 
Lacayo said the agreement envisions the demobilization of the Contras by the time Chamorro takes office April 25, as called for in an agreement reached Friday in Honduras between UNO and the rebels. 
Helicopters of a U.N. ob­server force meanwhile began flying over Nicaraguan war zones Tuesday in preparation for the Contra demobilization. 
Twelve white helicopters em­blazoned with the U.N. symbol landed at Sandinista army in­stallations Tuesday morning and two hours later took off to the east. 
Military sources said the air­craft carried members of the observer force to eastern jungle zones, where they will try to contact Contra chiefs. 
Under an agreement reached Friday, rebels in Honduran base camps are to disband and return to Nicaragua by April 20.

Meditation is key for business day 
Wednesday, March 28, 1990 The Observer page 7 
FAIRFIELD, Iowa (AP) -In the quiet of the morning, when the sun pecks over the rolling farm fields, the trek to the golden dome begins. One by one, businessmen arrive, ready to start their day -by sitting in silence. 
There are oil brokers and engineers. A toymaker, too. All are successful entrepreneurs. And all arc meditators. 
Thousands of souls have flocked to this meditation mecca, home of Maharishi International University, to study, share a lifestyle and build their own businesses -a trend that has spawned pros­perity and growth in an isolated patch of America's heartland. 
"It is a remarkable commu­nity," says Daniel Dittemore, head of the Iowa Product

grass  in  the  middle  of  the  
square.  

'There's a remarkable popu­lation of technologically ori­ented companies out of all pro­portion of what you'd expect to lind in a community that size," said Dittemore. 
Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad has dubbed Fairfield, a town of 11,000, one of the state's eco­nomic "superstars." 
The local business chamber doesn't track thn numbnr of companies run or owned by meditators, but some in the community claim such firms employ about 1,000 people and more than 50 do business na­tionally or overseas. 
"We've put a lot of energy into this town, a lot of money, a lot of talent and a lot of job opportunities," said John Narducci, president of Chappell Studio-Marathon Foto, which photographs marathons and nearly a quarter-million gradu­ates annually. 
"Any small town in the Midwest would like to have 2,500 people," said Jerry Leahy, a meditator who is board chairman of Overland Outfitters, a family-owned outerwear firm with 11 stores nationwide. "It just isn't often you have them come in and bring their own jobs and bring their own payroll." 
Though meditators contribute to Fairfield's success, they're not the prime movers, said Mike Brouwer, executive vice president of the Chamber of Commerce, which has about 400 members. 
'Tm not willing to slight 22 major manufacturers in this community -some have been here over 100 years," he said. 
But he credits the meditators with creating innovative ways to support themselves. 
Some come because of the university, others because "the benefits seem to grow when you're meditating with other people," said Patty Schneider, public affairs chief at the col­lege, founded by the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the Indian guru who once dazzled the Beatles and other celebrities. 
Transcendental meditators believe if they gather in large numbers, they create the "Maharishi Effect" -a positive influence on events ranging from global conflicts to the rate of traffic deaths. More than 7,000 meditators gathered here in 1983 for the "Taste of Utopia." 
Each morning and afternoon, meditators practice their tech­nique in the Golden Domes of Pure Knowledge -one for ladies, one for gents, to avoid distractions. 
Estimates of meditators range from 2,000 to 3,000; many attend or work at the university, which moved from California in 1974 into the campus of defunct Parsons College and has a full-time en­rollment of 799. Meditators also run their own school for elementary and high school students. 
Male MIU students often wear ties and jackets, and jeans are discouraged. 
The strait-laced appearance fits in well with mid-America, and meditators work side-by­side with non-meditators in businesses and the City Council.

SUB supports campus groups 
Dear Editor: 
I'm writing to respond to the accusations against the Student Union Board by Irish Accent Vice President Timothy Farish (The Observer, March 21). While we must apologize for a lack of internal communication regarding the several events in question--the lrish Accent Din­ner Theater and another SUB initiated dinner theater--we must also reply that it was not entirely SUB's fault. Further­more, we believe that SUB has always given attention and ef­fort to campus groups; Mr. Farish disagrees. 
First, SUB had contracted with several outside performers for the same period before we were informed of the date of the theater by Irish Accent. With these legally binding con­tracts in place and SUB's desire to space out similar events, we asked Irish Accent to change the date. They refused, stating that they wanted to hold the first dinner theater at Notre Dame, and, therefore would not sacrifice their schedule. The Student Union Board doesn't view this as a reason to justify the breaching of a contract to 
which the University is liable. 
To respond to the larger complaint of Mr. Farish, the Student Union Board has con­tinually supported campus stu­dent groups. Examples of this include regular sponsorship of Campus Bands on Fieldhouse Mall and in the Nazz Band Competition, support and ad­vice to the newly formed cof­feehouse in Grace Hall, in­volvement of campus clubs in panel discussions and intellec­tual weeks, and assistance in planning movies for all campus 
groups. 
We apologize that the end re­sult of this matter wasn't fa­vorable but believe it was inap­propriate communications and inflexibility that caused it, not a 
lack  of interest in  campus  
groups.

EDITORIAL 

It's time for students to stand up for their rights 
The Campus Life Council will meet today to discuss The Bill of University and Student Relations which, if adopted by the University, could give the students of Notre Dame unprecedented rights. 
The Constitution of the United States guarantees all of its citizens certain "inalienable rights." DuLac, however, in its current form, does not give these same rights to the students of Notre Dame. 
The Bill of University and Student Relations was proposed by the Legal Department of Student Govern­ment and was passed unanimously by the Student Se­nate on March 5. If the Campus Life Council (CLC) passes the bill, it is forwarded to Father David Tyson, vice-president for Student Affairs. 
In order for the "Student Bill of Rights" to become part of DuLac, Tyson must sign it. However, Tyson failed to send a representative from his office to the first meeting of the CLC. The fact that the ultimate decision on the bill will be left to someone who has not participated in the hearings or heard any of the CLC's input is frightening. 
Students at Saint Mary's are guaranteed several rights contained in the bill. The right to due process, the right to be judged by one's peers, the right to not be collectively punished and the right to an open hearing are all held by Saint Mary's students, but not by the students of Notre Dame. 
In addition, the right to public disclosure of all ad­ministrative hearings and the right to a free and un­censored press, which are essential for an atmosphere of openness and trust, are not to be found in DuLac. 
It is time for the University to relinquish some of its monopoly on students' rights. The Bill of University and Student Relations could be a major breakthrough in the struggle for students' rights in private universi­ties, and we strongly urge the CLC to approve it and Father Tyson to sign it. 
In order fur the voice of the students to be heard, there must be a clear display of student interest. Therefore, students are urged to attend the CLC's meeting, which will be held today at 3:30 p.m. in the Notre Dame Room of LaFortune. The students of Notre Dame are urged to get up and stand up for the rights which are held both across our nation and across the street. 
A representative from the Office of Student Affairs is also urged to show an interest in today's proceedings. Afterall, it's pretty hard to take a test when you've never gone to class.

Dear Editor: 
Notre Dame Student Government is currently preparing a report on issues of sexuality to be presented to the Notre Dame Board of Trustees in May 1990. Board of Trustees reports are intended to give the Board members students' per­spectives on pertinent issues regarding life at Notre Dame. This current report focuses on the various conditions of sexu­ality as they exist on the Notre Dame campus, including areas such as contraception, rape, school policy, homosexuality and health services. 
However, in order to present a truly accurate report, the Committee has designed a sur­vey to investigate these issues. Only a limited number of ran­dom students will receive a sur­vey. Therefore, we are making an appeal to those who do. Every student who receives a survey should complete and re­turn it either to the locked stu­dent government box located in each dorm or through campus mail in the included pre-ad­dressed envelope. 
The more responses we re­ceive, the more credible and successful our report will be in facilitating the needed dialogue on issues of sexuality. This is your opportunity, as a member of the Notre Dame student body, to directly affect policy. Your help and cooperation will be greatly appreciated.

All should work to improve global environment 
By Mark Wiltberger 
The 1mvironmental movement has really begun to explode. It's tough to pick up any magazine or newspaper without 11nding sonw artid1~ related to the envi­ronnwnt. Tlw U.S. has finally caught on to the Pnvironnwn­talism craze. Bush has an­nouncl~d that he is devoted to probl1~ms of the environment and has announced several en­vironnwntal measures to attack the problmn. Some feel his ae­tions an~ too much, others feel thny are too modest. 
Most actions of U.S. environ­mental groups are directed right lwrP in tlw U.S. Moves towards n~cyding cans and IWWSJ>apers an• bl'ginning to be inrorporatl'(l by local govl'l'n­nwnts across the U.S. There is a great thrust by groups to in­rrPasn awarniwss of larger problems outside tlw U.S. Tlwrn an~ movPmPnts dirncted toward the govPrnnwnt of Brazil and toward U.S. compa­nies in Brazil protl•sting tlw de­struction of Amazon rain forests. Then~ are bans on styrofoam because it is not re­cydable. Tlwre an~ protests against U.S. companies that market rhlorofluorocarbon­producing goods in foreign countries. 
These actions arl' based on the maxim, "Think globally, act l01:ally." They are based on the philosophy that Pnvironnwntal­ism is a change in attitude. One must first incorporate envi­ronnwntalism into 1me's own lifestyle and then one is able to change tlw world. If we cannot eliminate the wastefulness in our own Ameri1:an lifnstyle. then we an~ not qualified to protest wastl'fulness elsewlwrn in the world. 
This is all well and good. The environnwntal movement is growing, and Americans an~ fi­nally lwroming awarn of prob­lems that a small minority had noticed growing two or three decades ago. 
My fear is that environmen­talism will be a passing fad to Americans. We have just nndcd the ROs. a decade of supnrliciality and image. The BANDAID movement to combat world hungnr faded away in · Anwrican minds without it ever bning dear how much money actually fed starving Africans. Amnesty International tried hard to create awareness of the decades of human rights viola­tions in El Salvador. and all Americans could talk about was the U.S. invasion of Panama. Grennpeace wanted everyont~ to boycott tuna be­rausn of the massive destruc­tion of dolphins in .Japanese tuna 1wts. 
Wlwtlwr or not environmen­
talism is a passing fad to 
Anwricans, tlw Pnvironmental 
probl1~lll will not go away. By 
its VPry nature. it will only get 
worse, and the dedsions made 
by politicians, diplomats and 
businessmen will only get 
tougher. It will take more than 
an awareness to solve the 
problem. It will take self­
disdpline and stick-to-it-ive­
ness by thP American publie 
long aftPr the fad has faded. 
The other thing the environ­nwntally-awarc American must understand is that tlwre are no simple solutions to the cnvi­ronm!mlal problem. In the late 60s and 70s, the envirommmtal problem was, on the whole, a question of how to stop pollu­tion. Although this was a large and complicated problem, the general motion was to protest businesses responsible for the pollution and appeal to the gov1~rnment to pass restrictions on businesses. Companies had to clean up their smokestacks, car manufacturers had to clean up their fuel emissions. There was also the large concern in the mid-70s about depletion of energy resources and the search for alternate sources of energy. 
There has been a growing awareness in the ROs that pol­lution and energy resources are only part of the environmental problem. The environmental problem is concerned with the depletion of natural resources throughout most of the world. the most pressing ones being the reduction of biodiversity. deforestation, the destruction of the ozone layer, global warming, topsoil erosion and the loss of underground water sources. The enormity and complexity of the environmental problem is overwhelming. For example, the rain forests are a biologically diverse ecosystem with hundreds of thousands of species of animal and plant life. They cover a large area of the land mass of the globe and constitute most of the forest of the world. They an~ being dearPd fur development at an alarming ratn. 
The destruction of the rain fornsts affects the global envi­ronment in several ways. Loss of rain forests eliminates the greatest sou1·ce for conversion of carbon dioxide to oxygen; this build-up of carbon dioxide constitutes global warming. Large quantities of topsoil are lost when the cleared land is used for industry or farming. The most long-lasting effect of the destruction of the rain forests may be the elimination of biodiversity. The elimination of thousands of different undiscovered species makes a very diverse and deep gene pool very shallow and threatens the very ability or life to evolve for generations to come. 
The environmentally-aware American must remember the 
problems  of  less  developed  
countries  before  attacking  
them  too  vociferously.  Most  


Upcoming events provide opportunity to debate environmental issues at ND 
By James Dailey 
It SIWIIIS that Pveryone on the plarwt wants to call himself an environmentalist: in Hurope, it's the vogue. and tlw Gre1m l'arty racks up victory after victory: in Anwrica, 70 pere~~nt of tho pPopln considen•d them­selv!'s environnwntalists in a recent poll; in Eastern Europe and tlw USSH. environmental issues are at the the tops of the agendas: and even Margaret Thatcher and George Bush daim nwmbership in what is no longer an exclusive movement. 
But no wonder. With increas­ing frequoncy and severity. the many long-term dfects of our modernizing world have come to light in a s1~ries of problems that dwarf humanity's accom­plishments. In this "me" gener­ation, we are robbing future generations of resources and necessary ecological systmns, eounting this exploitation on the profit side of the ledger. Huled by the short-term "bottom line," in the race for bigger and better, we have for­gotten to plan for the seventh generation. leaving instead a legacy of problems that could and should have bm~n avoided. 
Poignantly, it is both a point 

of 1~mpowerment and blame 
that the environmental crises 
faeing our planet arc not 
caused by the Prratic position 
of a cornet, the harmonic con­
VI~rgence or the little grepn 
Keebler elves from Mars, but rathPr from the aetivi ties of our limited species. From ozone d1~pletion to acid rain, from global warming to groundwater pollution, from increasing cancer rates amongst workers to decreasing IQs of inner-city children, all of the crises are man-made. arising from the curnulativ1• artions of individu­als. 
Indeed, perhaps the greatest difficulty with these nnw trans­boundary problems, such as ozone depletion or global warming, lies with the fact that it requires a new and alien con­ception: man has become the source of a whole host of prob­lems traditionally conceived to be in the indisputable and un­controvl~rtible realm of nature. Modern science has given us the capacity to abuse our finite planet, but only rceently have scientists begun to understand the enormous but fragile com­plexity that sustains life on this planet alone in our solar sys­tem. 
Furthermore, what is emerg­ing from the conception of the interrelatedness of natural sys­tems is the idea that the planet is similar to an organism, living and breathing analogously in ways that arc mirrored by all organisms on the planet. In this context, no one and no organ­ism is an island. Each person, as part of this "organism," cannot ignore the implications of his/her actions, and we can­not ignore that individual rhoices multiplied millions of times become the conspicuous aetion taken by one aspect of lif1• on this planet. The choices that we make--what products to buy, where to shop, how many children we have, how much will we consumt)--all have implieations beyond the immediate cost-bennfit, both for our children and for the people in the exploited third 
world. 
During the following weeks. the Notre Dame community will be given the opportunity to dis­cuss and debate the many aspects of the environmental movement, the issues that gal­vanize support and cover head­lines, and the various agendas for change that havt~ been put forth as "the answer." The first week of events, sponsored by SUB and the Earth Day Com­mittee of Notre Dame, features three speakers, the most con­troversial being David Foreman, spokesperson for Earth First! Speaking at Cushing Hall on Wednesday. April 4 at 8 p.m., Foreman will address the tacties of his group, which range from tree­spiking (which prevents them from being cut down). to media events like the plastic "crack" in the Glen Canyon Dam. Such activities have earned his group the title of environmental radi­calism, general disapproval from other environmental groups, and tho attention of the FBI. Are their actions justified

Certainly. tho magnitude of the problems facing our planet, and the relative inaction of tlw world's governments cries out for action. Earth First! mem­bers believe that the main­stream environmental move­ment has sold out, compromis­ing their agenda for political expediency. The Notre Dame Environmental Action Club. which is responsible for the initiation and support of the Hecyclin' Irish, the "Ban-the­Styrofoam" project and the Earth Day Committee, would characterize itself as very mainstream environmental. While the EAC should appeal to the common interest, I cannot help but think that Foreman has a point, that we are copping out, taking the path of least resistance. Although it would be illegitimate to present myself as a spokesperson for Fornman, I don't think it too audacious to claim that Foreman does not entin~ly be­lieve in the non-violent ap­proach to conflict rnsolution-­and I have a problem with that. 
On the other hand. tlw upraised, clenched "gnHm" fist, so apropos for Earth First. strikes me as a good symbol for the philosophy necessary and appropriate for the envi­ronmental movmnent today-­the time has come to mak1~ a stand.

DOWN rca se 
Cavanaugh Hall comedy to benefit Sowder Scholarship Fund 
JANICE ARCHER 
accent writer 

Evnryonn can rnlatn to the premise found in thn titln of Bel Kaufman's comedy, "Up the Down Staircase." Most high schools have unwritten rules that are simply taken for grantPd, and are severe breaches of etiqunttn when vio­latE~d. Kaufman's play, per­formed this Thursday through Saturday at 8 p.m. in the li­brary auditorium by the Ca­vanaugh Hall Players, concen­tratns on a student who rebels and goes up the down staircase. 
Cavanaugh Hall Productions, who performed Woody Allen's play. "Don't Drink the Water" last year, chose Kaufman's play to raise money for the Andy Sowder Scholarship Fund. 
Sowder, who was president of Cavanaugh in 1979, was on a skiing vacation in February of that year when he was diag­nosed as having spinal meningi­tis. lie died on February 24. and a scholarship fund was set up by the I I all Council in his name.

Novel fund-raising ideas, such as the basketball game played on donkeys, were incorporated along with donations made by parents of students in the dorm, contributions of alumni and the parents and friends of Sowder. But eight years ago, the hall plays were discovered as an effective means of raising 
money. 

"Up the Down Staircase" is the story of a recently gradu­ated female teacher, Sylvia Barrett, who accepts her first teaching position in an inner New York City high school. Her problems and experiences are told in conjunction with the lives of several students. One of these students, Joe Ferone, comes to Sylvia for guidance 
when he begins to consider 
dropping out of school. The 
play is comical and light­
hearted, one of the reasons it 
was chosen as this year's per­
formance. 
Another reason "Up the 
Down Staircase" was chosen is 
its large number of parts. 
There are 24 actors and ac­
tresses. bringing more people 
into the activity and hopefully 
more spectators to the perfor­

I have decided that a lot of thn discus­sions in my classes would be mom liVPiy if the professors and stud1mts were equipped with padded "bof'f bats" which they could employ against each other when thny reachnd an im­passn in thnir disagrnemPnts. Here's how this might work in nmllife:

I" m not really all that sure that I'd learn that mueh more, but I know that I'd be enrtain to stay awake in class. 
In faet, imagine arms negoti­ations with both sides amply armed with boff bats; why, it'd be bdter than televised roller derby! Maybe violPnt pillow 

There are no tickets sold. Rather, seating is on a first come, first served basis. Dona­tions to the fund are accepted at the end of the play. Producer Steve Cattapan encourages ev­

Carson's ratings would plummet as millions tune in to watch the slaughtnr! On the down side. howevnr. Ted Koppel would be locked away as a menace to society! So per­haps we can't carry this idea too far --better to stick to boff bats. 
Yes. boff bats could be used in a thousand everyday activi­ties. Imagine boff bats in the dining hall:

Georgia Tech prepares for finals 
ATLANTA (AP) -Bobby Cremins used to fret over Georgia Tech's failures in the Atlantic Coast Conference and NCAA tournaments. 
Not anymore. 

The coach of the ninth­ranked Yellow Jackets took a more relaxed attitude this year, and it paid off with Tech's first trip to the Final Four. 
"I didn't want to extend the pressure of getting to the Final Four to my family and my team," Cremins said Tuesday. "I just decided that whether or not I got to the Final Four would not dictate my happi­ness." 
The Yellow Jackets (28-6) will meet second-ranked UNLV (33­
5) in the national semifinals 
Saturday in Denver. The winner 
advances to Monday night's 
championship game against the 
Arkansas-Duke winner. 
Georgia Tech won the ACC 
tournament in 1985 and ad­
vanced to the regional finals 
before losing to Georgetown. 
The Yellow Jackets lost the 
conference title game in 1986 
to Duke and were eliminated in 
the regional semifinals. 
Then they went winless in the ACC tournament and won only one more NCAA tournament game until this year, when they ·captured the league's postsea­son championship and made it 
all the way to Denver. 
"It is a great honor to be 
part of the Final Four," 
Cremins said. "It's one of the spec.~acular things in sports to­day. 
Tech enters the UNLV game with an eight-game winning streak. The Yellow Jackets beat Clemson in their regular-season finale, won three straight in the ACC tournament and followed that up with NCAA tournament victories over East Tennessee State, LSU, Michigan State and Minnesota -the last three by a total of six points. 
The Yellow Jaekets leave for Denver on Wednesday after­noon, giving them time to ad­just to Colorado's high altitude. 
"I just hope emotions of the game will be a lot higher than the altitude," Cremins said.

"We're dPiighted to sec thn umpires go back to work," union head Hichie Phillips said. "They need some work. partic­ularly behind the plate, to get ready for the openers April 9." 

The agreement was reached with the prodding of U.S. District .Judge Norma L. Shapiro, who was scheduled to hear arguments in the leagues' request for an injunction forc­ing the umpires to work.

Notre Dame Rugby C u opens season with v1ctory
Last fall, the Notre Dame Hughy team had a problem with coming out flat at the begin-Mike Kamradt ning of their games. Subsequently, they Club Corner often found themselves trailing early and des­perately trying to come back. Saturday, and pleasant temperatures, the club came out smoking and held off the Dayton Flyers for a 19-18 win on the A side. 
"We were really pleased," commented club presi­dent Mike Smiggen. "Dayton is ranked sixth in the region and last semester they beat Ohio State who was then ranked number one." 
The game was scoreless until ten minutes into the game when Sean McNamara booted a penalty kick for a 3-0 lead, but Dayton tied it on a monstrous 50-yard penalty kick. The Irish extended the lead to 13-9 at the half as McNamara chalked up two more penalty kicks and a conversion. Vic Pisani scored the only Irish try of the day in the half. 
Bather than allow the Flyers to close at the start of the second half, the Irish seized the initiative and broke away to a 19-9 lead with less than 15 minutes to play. However, the Flyers roared back to make it 19-18, but the Irish had enough in them to hold on for the victory. 
The unpredictable, usually lousy weather in the South Bend area accounts for why the Irish haven't been able to get in the shape they want to be. 
"It was a good confidence builder for only being 
outside for three days," explained Smiggen. "The 
teams really came together." 
"We took them out of their game," Smiggen con­
tinued. "Our fullback and wings played great." 
The B squad breezed to an easy 18-0 win in a 
game in which they thoroughly dominated and never 
struggled. Jim Dudley, Tim Slentz and Pat Monahan 
tallied tries for the Irish while Mike Lewis made 
good on all three of his conversion attempts. 
While the Illinois basketball team won't be return­
ing to Austin TX Oet alone any arena) for awhile 
after their first round NCAA loss, the Crew Team 
wouldn't mind going back soon. The team used the 
week of Spring Break as spring training and then 
raced in a regatta on St. Patrick's Day against 
Texas, Kansas, Kansas State, Minnesota and 
Northwestern. The Irish won the Men's Light Eight 
coxswained by Jill Jacobs. The Women's Heavy Four 
finished second as did the Women's Novice Heavy 
Eight. The Men's Heavy Eight finished third. 
"It was a pretty good week," commented club ·president Brian Lapps. "We use the week as spring training for the whole season, not just one race." 
Although the teams the Irish raced against were 
from all over the country, the regatta wasn't as dif­
ficult as some of the ones in which the team com­
peted in the fall. 

"These teams are on the same level as us," said 
Lapps. "This wasn't like traveling out east. These 
teams have been on the water longer than us so it's 
good we did well. By the end of the year, we will be able to beat all these teams." 
This Saturday the club will host the Notre Dame Regatta. Teams from Northwestern, Grand Valley State, University of Chicago, Indiana and Iowa will attempt to cruise the St. Joe River in the fastest times at Margaret Pritchett Park in Mishawaka. The race begins at 10 a.m. 
The Men's Volleyball team keeps rolling along as they won three matches in the past week. Last Wednesday, the Irish handled the Wolverines of Michigan in three straight 16-14, 15-9, and 15-11. 
"We played really well," commented junior captain Tom Martin. "They're annually one of our biggest rivals. It was sweet to beat them because we haven't beat them to often in the past few years." 
The following evening the Irish faced a geared down version of the tenth ranked Ball St. varsity squad. The Irish fell behind two games to none, but fought ba€k to win the match 15-17,11-15,15-8,15­10,15-10. Monday night the Irish made quick work of Western Michigan, winning 15-4, 15-2,15-2. 
This weekend the Irish will be seeded second as they go into the Midwest Championship where a to­tal of 36 teams will compete. Michigan St. is seeded above Notre Dame. 
"We have our sites set on winning," commented Martin. "We finished second last year and third the year before so we want this one bad." 
The top two teams will advance to the national tournament in Knoxville, TN.

Coyle places 37th in World Meet 
By SCOTT BRUTOCAO 
Assistant Sports Editor 
Ovm the weekend. freshman John Coyle finished 37th in the .Junior World Cross Country Championships in Aux-Les­Bains. France. 
lie returned on Monday night with the benefits of interna­tional compntition behind him. 
"It was amazing," said Coyle. "There worn all these countries from all over the world assem­bled to bring their best. It was an expnrience I want to expnri­ence again." 
Coyle felt that he could have improved his time of 24:18 over 8000 meters. 
"Ovmall it was nothing spe­cia!. It was a decent race to say the most," said Coyle. "I could have run better, there were a few things that I could have improved, and I didn't run that great. It was nothing special." 
"lie didn't do bad," said track coach Joe Piane, referring to Coyle's relatively high finish in a race with approximately 40 nations represented. "The pluses of this trip will be reaped down the road. Obviously this was a great trip, and he'll be a much better run­ner because of it." 
Coyle missed the entirety of last week at Notre Dame in preparation for the challenge. He ran the race on Saturday. March 24 after spending five days in France. 
"This experience will help him next year in cross country, and I can guarantee that if he stays healthy he'll be running right up there with (All American) Mike O'Connor," said Piane. 
Coyle had qualified for the race by winning the 19-and-un­der bracket at the U.S. World Cross Country qualifier in Seattle, Washington last month. At the Junior Worlds, he was the second American citizen to cross the finish line. 
"This race will serve as a mo­tivation," said Coyle. "Cross country is respected throughout the world, much more than it is here. There were tens of thousands of people watching and it was televised throughout Europe." 
Steinbrenner is investigated 
NEW YORK (AP) -John Dowd, who conducted base­ball's probe of Pete Rose, is now investigating the rela­tionship between George Steinbrenner and a gambler indicted for extorting money from the Yankees owner, ac­cording to a report. 
The New York Times re­ported Wednesday that Dowd is heading the investi­gation. Neither Dowd nor baseball commissioner Fay Vincent would confirm that, but the newspaper quoted Roland Thau, a lawyer for gambler Howie Spira, as say­ing he had spoken with Dowd on Monday. 
Rose, former manager of the Cincinnati Reds and baseball's career hit leader, accepted a permanent ban from the game last year for his gambling activities. Dowd investigated Rose at the behest of the then­Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti, who died shortly after banning Rose. 
Vincent said last week that he was looking into rela­tionaship between Steinbrenner and Spira. Steinbrenner admits paying Spira $40,000, but has said the money was a gift given "out of the goodness of my heart." 
Spira claims the money was part of deal he had with Steinbrenner in which he was rewarded for supplying in­formation about Yankees outfielder Dave Winfield.

school-record 48 wins, in­eluding a 4-2 mark against teams participating in the NCM tournament. 

•A 
final ranking of 23rd in the ESPN/Collegiate Baseball poll. 


This ESPN reckoning was more significant than just a business transaction. It was symbolic of how far the Notre Dame baseball program had come, so when ESPN gave Murphy a date and a need for a Top 20 opponent. the coach jumped. 
"They (ESPN) heard that we played exciting baseball," says Murphy, whose record as an Irish coach is 99-45-1. "They heard about some of our great wins against Miami and Texas and said they wanted to put us on. They pieked us, and so we looked around for a top 20 team to play and we found Illinois." 
Leave it to Murphy to east his line out into the murky waters of collegiate baseball and reel in a Top 20 program. Illinois, 42-16 last year, currently is ranked 14th in the nation by Baseball America and 21st by Collegiate Baseball. During the 1990 season they already have defeated Texas twice, Houston, Cal State Long Beach, New Orleans and Michigan.

Another area in which the Irish have not had a lot of suc­cess is run production. In their 16 games they've only scored 79 runs (which includes 10 run outbursts against St. Louis and Bradley). 
"It (lack of runs) is a concern, but thtise guys battle every game," states Flanagan. "We've won a lot of close games. If we got down five in a game, we'd players in double figures. Fleming finished with 17. 
NY 119, Bullets 100

just have to stick to the game plan. The way we battle there's no difference we can't overcome." 
Murphy isn't so sure. "If we get down by five, we're in trouble," he said. 
Still, this team's forte isn't its offensive prowess. Pitching and defense are what 's needed to carry the Irish to another MCC Championship.

MILWAUKEE-lUcky Pierce scored 20 of his 30 points in the second half and Jay llumphries added 26 as the Milwaukee Bucks defeated Phoenix 133-127, stopping the Suns from clinching a Western Conference playoff berth Tuesday night. ..­
Trailing 129-122, the Suns pulled to four on Kevin Johnson's three-point play with

Kevin Johnson had a career­high 44 points for th11 Suns. and Eddie Johnson had 29.

Coveleski Stadium in South 
Bend, is being promoted like a professional game. The first 500 fans will receive baseballs at the door, and buses will be making trips back and forth from campus to the stadium. The only other time the Irish have been televised nationally was whnn ESPN showed them get destroyed by Houston in 1984. 
The Fighting lllini will pro­pose great difficulty for the Irish, but the game itself is not the point. "Illinois is a top ten, top fiftenn team, a senior-dom­inated team. Illinois plays a tremendously tough schedule," says \1urphy, building up his opponent as he invariably does. 
What Murphy won't tell you is that the event outshines the execution. Even if the Irish are destroyed by Illinois, they still have won a larger contest. When Murphy stepped into a program wallowing in its own mediocrity and turned it into a national contender, he claimed a victory for Notre Dame base­ball. The ESPN opportunity is one manifestation of that.
