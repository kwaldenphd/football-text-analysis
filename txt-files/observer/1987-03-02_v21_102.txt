In Brief 
Seven college students were trapped in a flooded cave in Iowa while exploring with a college recreation program. Police reached the cave 30 minutes after the first three cavers called the school, but two cavers died of the cold before they could be reached. Though they had permission to be in the cave, police said none were equipped to descend into the cavern, described as one of the deepest in Iowa. -Associated Press 
Dozens of skiers fell from heights of up to 130 feet when a damaged chair lift collapsed at the Pyrenees resort of Luz-Ardiden in France. Five were killed and 41 were seriously injured in the accident, whose cause was not clear. The chairlift was new and opened just two weeks ago. Associated Press 
Authors Stephen King and John Irving are reading some of their works to raise money for a little-known short-story writer, Andre Dubus, who was injured in a car accident. The series of five readings cost $200 apiece. Dubus' leg was amputated and the other shattered after he stopped to help another motorist in trouble.

The question: Is Iran-contra scandal tragedy or comedy? 
Somewhere in Hollywood the scriptwriters are working around the clock to copy down the latest twists and turns in the Iran-Contra arms scandal. Ronald Reagan, once president of the screen actor's guild, undoubtedly likes to see the movie industry prosper. 
It was the magic of the silver screen that first brought the Great Communicator to national prominence, establishing him with the reputa­tion, wealth, and friends with which to launch a political career. But now, much to his chagrin, the benefactor-patron relationship will be reversed and the movies will prosper at his expense. 
It is only a matter of time before the first books are written. Once these are published the films will be soon to follow. Certainly those with inside knowledge of Iran-Contra affair will com­mand handsome prices for their memoirs -this is perhaps the reason why Oliver North and John Poindexter have shrewdly held out on their testimony. When the first copies inevitably hit the street, the booksellers face the difficult deci­sion of where to shelve the work. Potentially it could fall under the subject of history, politics, war, adventure, romance, or melodrama ­anything but family entertainment. 
The Iran-Contra connection relies on the clas­sic formula for entertainment success. Not only do we have the involvement of high government officials in secret arms deals, covert para­military operations, numbered Swiss bank deposits, and an elaborate cover-up scheme but also millions in unaccounted cash, beautiful secretaries, and an unexplained suicide at­tempt. Add to this the mystique of travel to foreign lands, the looming Soviet threat in Central America (Amerika?), the sudden-death danger of international terrorism, and the deafening roar of the ongoing Iran-Iraq war and you have the perfect backdrop for all the excitement. What else could a James Bond film want? 
Whatever productions are eventually made from this Iran-Contra affair certainly will not need artificial embellishments in order to keep the audience awake. 
To thicken the plot even further, there is the animosity between Nancy and Chief of Staff Donald Regan. The backstabbing behind this scene is gossip waiting to be told. 

Jim Carroll 
Photography Editor 


Then of course there is the Gipper, who now maintains that it is possible that he forgot whe­ther or not he took sides in a major, interna­tional war. 
At this point it is uncertain whether the Iran­Contra scandal is a comedy or a tragedy. It could be either or both, and the fact that the audience does not know whether to laugh or cry is a hallmark of excellence in drama. 
On the one hand, everyone finds it humorous whenever a figure of authority and respect is made to look foolish or is revealed to be the buffoon that he really is. For some reason it is hilarious to see a leader slip on a banana peel, bump his head, or publicly forget the causes he swears to defend. 
On the other hand, it is tragedy to see an individual drown in his own confusion and mis­takes. In a greater sense there is also sorrow to see a nation become engrossed by its own shortcomings and allegations of wrongdoing.

Sophomore parents have weekend at SMC 
By PEGGY PROSSER Staff Reporter 
More than 200 members of the Saint Mary's Class of 1989 hosted their parents this past weekend at the College's an­nual Sophomore Parents Weekend. 
Most parents arrived Friday night and attended a talent show, held in the Angela Ath­letic Facility, to begin their weekend. 
Saturday afternoon the Col­lege hosted an Open House, also in Angela. Parents and stu­dents were greeted by College President William Hickey and College Vice-President Dorothy Feigl. The College's academic departments were represented by department chairmen and professors. 
A Sunday Liturgy was held Saturday afternoon in the Church of Loretto on the Saint l'.1ary's campus. 
Saturday night students were given the chance to try to out­dance their parents at the din­ner dance, held at the Century Center in South Bend. The eve­ning began with a cash bar, fol­lowed by a welcome-to-parents speech by sophomore Marisa Ley, chairperson of the event. 
The brunch held at the Col­lege dining hall Sunday con­cluded the weekend. 
Ley was assisted by a com­mittee, consisting of Kathleen 
Needham,  Michele  Kruze,  
Kelly  Glavin,  Janice  Terpin  
and Barbara Krugh.

Tornado victims clean up after storm leaves 8 dead 
Associated Press 
LAUREL, Miss. -Resi­dents and cleanup crews worked under a sunny sky Sunday to recover belong­ings and clear up wreckage from a tornado that left eight people dead, nearly 500 families homeless and mil­lions of dollars in damage. 
"Everybody is tired, but things are looking up," said Carl Carlos, Jones County Civil Defense director. "It's just a matter of cleanup and get back on our feet now." 
The tornado left at least 145 people injured as it cut a 20-mile-long, 2-mile-wide path of destruction across mostly rural Jones County in southeastern Mississippi on Saturday morning. 
Some residents camped out overnight at bonfires be­side the piles of splintered lumber and brick that had been their homes, and the National Guard blocked off 15 roads and highways. 
"It probably caused more damage in one county than I've ever seen," said Gov. Bill Allain.

9 cities prepare for Pope's U.S. trip 
Associated Press 
One of the hottest tickets in the country this year is a seat at one of the masses which Pope John Paul II will celebrate in September. 
Though stadiums may be full, they won't be sold out -the tickets are free. Local church officials are depending on the generosity of Roman Catholics and corporations to defray mil­lions of dollars in expenses for the 10-day, nine-city visit. 
"There are more than a mil­lion Catholics in this diocese. I am sure we will be able to come up with the money," said the Rev. Jose Nickse, the spokes­man for the Archdiocese of Miami·, where the costs are es­timated at up to $2 million. 
There was more trepidation in San Francisco, where the pope's two-day visit is an­ticipated to cost $4 million. 
"When you have a special collection in an archdiocese like ours, $50,000 would be a big collection. That's a little piece of a million dollars," said the Rev. Miles Riley, spokesman for the San Francisco Archdiocese. 
"But it really is very little money for the impact of the visit," he added. "It's $2 billion worth of publicity alone." 
The pope's tentative schedule begins in Miami on Sept. 10, then on to Columbia, S.C., New Orleans, San An­tonio, Texas, Phoenix, Los An­geles, Monterey, Calif., San Francisco and Detroit. The pope departs for Rome on Sept. 19. 
Arrangements are being made now for security, media coverage and hotel rooms in the cities. Half a year before the pope's second extended visit to this country, the church

is already saying "no" to some 
demands for tickets or a few 
minutes of the pontiff's time. 
The diocese has 295,000 mem­
bers and 76,000 seats for a mass 
at Sun Devil Stadium. Rather 
than sell tickets, the diocese 
hopes to raise nearly $1 million, 
plus $300,000 to spruce up St. 
Mary's Basilica, through 
private and corporate dona­
tions, and by a special collec­
tion in every parish church this 
month. 
Diocesan officials in San An­
tonio reported raising about 
$500,000 of the required $2.5 
million. "We're right on tar­
get," said Bishop Charles V. 
Grahmann of Victoria. 
Financing is a particular pinch for the small diocese of Monterey, which is trying tc raise $2 million. The diocese had proposed seeking bids for rights to televise the pope's visit, but backed down last month after broadcasters protested. 
"We appreciate the prob­lems they have, but you can't sell rights to the pope's visit as if it were the Super Bowl," said Dick Little, news director of KSCO radio in Santa Cruz.

Hope for recovery lies with ring in the Grotto 
I think that what has happened to me last weekend will remain very close to me, no matter how old, or how far away I find myself from these past few days, or this place. 
Coni Rich 
guest column 
My mother did not come to South Bend last weekend because she has cancer and is currently fighting through chemotherapy treatments. The doctors felt that she would greatly jeopardize her already fragile health if she were to come in contact with large crowds, or if she were to become too tired from the long trip from Phoenix. She stayed at home with my sister Chrissy, and Dad made the decision that he would come and share the weekend with me instead of sending a favorite aunt and uncle or close friends. 
My dad and I enjoyed our time to­gether, although I was really worried by the amount of fatigue and sadness I saw in his eyes when my neighbor and I picked him up from the bus stop on Friday afternoon. He tried so hard to smile and laugh at my frustration at being late, but I just couldn't help but feel that this was going to be one of the most emotionally involved and ex­hausting weekends of our lives. 
'The ring on my father's hand was much more than just a symbol -it was everything my dad represented to me.' 
Like all of my other classmates, my dati and I attended every event. We were amazed at the huge crowds at the Friday night cocktail dance, and we were more than a little tired when we finally found a place tosit down. It was as the evening was drawing to a close that we ran into a good friend and his parents, and my dad pulled Dan aside and asked him if he would do a special favor for him. Dan is the "Grotto Keeper" (as I call him), and I thought that Dad might have a question about the Grotto, or maybe even a small con­tribution that he might like to make toward its upkeep. The Grotto has al­ways been my dad's favorite place to visit-it is the first place he goes to and 
Doonesbury 
the last place he leaves every time he is at Notre Dame, and I can still re­member when he told me to visit the Grotto every day. 
I might help my story here if I explain a little about my father. Dad is one of those people that has a way of entering your thoughts and staying there without you even knowing it-you find yourself thinking like him and not realizing where you've heard the words before. He came to Notre Dame in 1950 and then graduated in 1954 after four years of incredible study and hard work to pay his tuition. His father died when he was eleven years old, leaving him the only man in a family which consisted of Grandma, Aunt Lou, and Dad. His father never went to college, so Dad's only notion of Notre Dame came from a man who saw this university as the only one in America. Dad told us a story at the President's dinner about when he was little and he and his dad would go to the barber shop on Saturday mornings. They would listen to Notre Dame football on the radio, and all of the older men would place their bets on the day's winner. My Grandpa always chose Notre Dame, and he would tell my dad that someday he was going to send him to Notre Dame to make a lawyer out of him. 
Obviously, Dad's dream and his fa­ther's dream came true, and he became a part of the Notre Dame family that they had both come to love and respect. My dad received his class ring his senior year, and he constantly reminds me that when he was here, only seniors were given the honor of wearing that special symbol. This ring was more than a special symbol in my family. I can remember tracing my hand in kin­dergarten and proudly drawing a ring on the fourth finger of the right hand, but it never quite looked like I wanted it to. When my teacher would ask me what the ring meant, I would tell her that my dad wore a ring that was from a really neat place called Notre Dame, and that someday I was going to have one just like it. The ring on my father's hand was much more than just a sym­bol -it was everything my dad represented to me. When I put my little hand on his, I could feel the heaviness of it against my fingers, and when he talked and motioned with his hands, the ring was always there. He never took it off, and the ring itself was practically worn smooth on the sides from thirty­two years of wear. 
When my dad left me this afternoon to go back home, the ring wasn't on his finger. Earlier today, he asked me if we could make another trip to the Grot­to, and as we were standing there he took it off of his hand and placed it in mine. I knew then what the sadness was in his eyes. Yes, he was very sentimen­tal this weekend, and yes he shed more than a few tears after hearing Father Hesburgh's last address to to the Junior Parents Weekend crowd. 
My dad gave this ring to me today, and he asked me to place it at the feet of the Blessed Virgin with Dan's help as soon as I could. Of course I was stunned.-Just seeing that ring in my hand and not on his finger was enough to make me realize that there was something wrong. I held if for the longest time, just looking at it and thinking to myself that I was hopeless. There was no way I could fix whatever was wrong. He hugged me, and we walked to the car, and many people that we passed smiled sympathetically to themselves thinking that here was a poor junior having to say good-bye to her father after a lovely weekend. 
My mom may not live very much longer. She has colon cancer, which has spread to the liver. Since October, when I found out about her illness, I have ignored it and pretended that nothing was wrong, and that the next time I went home my mom's hair would be back and she wouldn't be sick anymore. Today I found out that this dream is just that -an alcove in the Grotto. My dad told me today that he has always tried to devote his life to her, and that by placing his ring at her feet he was asking in the most profound way for a gift of a miracle. That ring was and is my dad. It represents all that I have come to believe in as a member of this thing called Notre Dame. It means all that Father Hesburgh talked about last weekend in his speech -a devotion to God and man, a sense of responsibility in society, and a spiritual oneness that comes from being under the protection of that golden statue on top of the dome. Dad calls the Grotto his anchor point in life, and by placing himself there in the form of that ring, he gave himself totally up to the faith that he has nur­tured not only in himself, but in me as well. 
This place is special. I complain and hate it sometimes just as much if not more than most of the people here. But I can't deny the fact that a man like my dad found this place important enough to devote his life and love to its precepts. 
Dad will wear his ring again some­day. He asked that it be kept there at the Grotto until the day I graduate, when my mom will come home and get it for him. Just knowing that he believes that she will be here for that day is strength enough for me to go and put it where someday it can be found again.

Irish try for 20th victory tonight 
By BOB KEMPER 
Sports Writer 
A sign in the Notre Dame locker room outlines what must be done to win 20 games. The Irish will attempt to reach that perennial milestone when they square off against Brooklyn College tonight at at 7:30 in the ACC. 
If successful, it will be Notre Dame's fourth straight 20­victory season, the nth of Dig­ger Phelps' 16 seasons with the Irish, and the 24th in Notre Dame's history. The Kingsmen, who gained Divi­sion I status in 1982, stand at 10-15 going into the contest, which is the first ever meeting between the two schools. 
"Brooklyn will come in here with the idea of making its season by beating us," said Notre Dame head coach Digger Phelps. "They have played a lot of tough road games already this year, so that aspect shouldn't bother them. This is one of those games where you don't have much time to prepare, so we just have to come out and play hard and concentrate, especially early in the game." 
The only returning starter for Head Coach Mark Reiner is 6-7 senior Keith Grady who is averaging 18.5 points and 6.5 rebounds per contest. Other probable starters include 6-6 junior transfer Frank Gregov 
(16.1 pts., 8.2 rebs.), 6-7 junior transfer Adam Weinstein (8.0 pts., 5.0 rebs.), 5-11 freshman Spious Kilpatrick (10 pts., 2.3 rebs.), and 5-11 junior transfer Jeff Petway (7.4 pts., 2.2 rebs.). 
The Irish will be looking for their seventh consecutive vic­tory as they head toward the NCAA tournament. They can­not afford a lapse of any sort as momentum is a vital in­gredient in tournament play. 
"I like the way we are playing right now and I like the confidence we've developed," said Phelps. "We're playing with a lot of consistency, and I think our players know what they can do in every different situation. Right now, we just want to be in a groove as we wind down the last week of the regular season."

Women's swim team takes sixth 
By ROSE PIETRZAK Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's swim team ended its season placing sixth among a field of 12 teams in the Midwest Inde­pendent Swimming and Diving Championships at Notre Dame's Rolfs Aquatic Center. Tallying 322 points, the Irish did not match last year's third place finish, but did manage to place 25 swimmers in the top ten positions for 19 of 20 events. 
"We saw some incredible teams here this weekend," said second-year coach Tim Welsh. "As a team, we swam very well also. We had significant timing drops across the board and we were able to hold our own. One of our season goals was to move up a place in the rankings this weekend, but through the season, we realized that as a team we would probably not be able to accomplish that goal. We decided to stress the indi­vidual events and the best pos­sible performance." 
The squad depended heavily on veterans Amy Darlington and Suzanne DeVine to carry the burden of the events. Dar­lington, a junior from Fair­field, Ohio, captured a second­place finish in the 400-yard Individual Medley with a time of 4:38.24 to reset her own uni­versity record. Darlington also earned a third-place standing in the 500-yard freestyle with a time of 5:06.72. As a member of the 800-yard freestyle relay team, Darlington helped change the record with a time of 7:54.93. 
Senior Suzanne DeVine cap­tured fourth place in the 100­yard butterfly with a time of :59.50 and also an eighth place finish in the 200-yard Individual Medley. DeVine contributed to the 800-yard freestyle relay and also swam a leg of the sixth­place medley relay. 

Other outstanding perfor­mances were put in by fresh­man Georgia Bosseler and sophomore Barbara Byrne. Bosseler captured eighth place in a tough field of 26 divers in the one-meter diving event and Byrne placed eighth and sixth in the 100 and 200-yard back­stroke events respectively. 
"We entered the season with some worries," said Welsh. "We were lacking depth in some of our events and we needed to pull everything to­gether. It was an exciting weekend, partly due to having the championships here for the first time, and partly because 
we knew we would be doing our best."

Track team utilizes depth to subdue DePaul, Marquette 
I By THERESA KELLY Sports Writer 
The talent and depth of the Notre Dame men's track team, including a great performance by hurdler Glen Watson, were too much for DePaul and Mar­quette Saturday in the ACC Fieldhouse. The Irish over­whelmed the Blue Demons and the Warriors with the final team scores of Notre Dame 92, 
1 Marquette 43 and Depaul 34. "We had a lot of kids run 
really well," said Coach Joe Piane. "It was a great tune-up for the IC4A's. 
"We ran a lot of different guys in different events. We like a meet where we can do that." 
Piane also liked the perfor­mance of Glen Watson. The freshman set a school record in the 60 yard high hurdles. With his time of 7.29 seconds (also a meet record), Watson missed qualifying for the NCAA meet by just three­tenths of a second. The NCAA standard is 7.26 seconds.

"Glen ran the race of the day," said Piane. "He was just great. He just missed qualify­ing for Nationals by an eyelash." 
Field event standout Rick Muench won the triple jump with 47-5 lJ2 and the long jump with 23-2, almost a foot better than the old meet record, and placed second in the high jump with 6-6 for the Irish. 
"I was really pleased with Rick Muench," said Piane. "He did well for us Saturday and has really performed well all year." 
Many meet records fell in ad­dition to those broken by W at­son and Muench. Pole vaulter Chris Matteo bettered his own meet record by 3 inches, vault­ing 15'3", and the Irish mile relay team of Robert Nobles, Yan Searcy, Watson, and Chris McGuire set a new mark of 
3: 27.01. Tim Brown ran a record time of 6.38 seconds in the sixty yard dash and blew away the old mark of 32.35 with a 30.80 in the 300 yard dash.

Irish whip Warriors, environment, 72-60 
By RICK RIETBROCK Sports Writer 
MILWAUKEE In an "NCAA-type atmosphere" at the MECCA, Notre Dame ended a super month of basket­ball with a 72-60 win over Mar­quette. The Irish used a 33-23 rebounding advantage and hot shooting, 60 percent, that spilled beer from the Mar­quette student section could not even cool to capture its eighth­straight win in the rivalry be­tween the two independents. 
Irish head coach Digger Phelps said the environment prepared his team for what the NCAA Tournament will be like. 
"This was like playing the first-or second-round game in the NCAA Tournament on the road, with this type of crowd, these types of conditions and the excitement," he said. "We came into the game knowing that Marquette may have to beat Notre Dame and DePaul to get an NCAA Tournament bid, so we expected them to really be up, have the emotion going, and have the crowd going, and yet we took it to them early." 
Take it to them they did. The Irish exploded at the outset, breaking out to a 23-10 lead. But Marquette responded with a 16­2 run of their own, and when Mike Flory hit a driving layup, the Warriors had a 26-25 lead. Donald Royal and Flory traded baskets before the Irish went on a 6-2 run that gave them a 35-30 halftime edge. 
The Irish continued the surge at the beginning of the second half. After Michael Sims hit a jumper to open the scoring, Scott Hicks, Mark Stevenson and Royal connected to give Notre Dame a nine-point ad­vantage. 
But Marquette was not about to fold that easily. Copa and David Boone scored four points apiece to help Marquette into a tie at 48 with 11: 24left to play. 
The Irish came back with six quick points, punctuated by a Royal driving dunk, with David Rivers sitting .on the bench. Copa scored on a nice assist from Sims to close the Irish lead down to four, 54-50, but the Warriors never got any closer. 
Rivers came back into the game at the 7:50 mark, ran the show from there on. He found Hicks on an inbounds pass for a layup, and after Voce rebounded and put in Rivers' miss, the Irish point guard put in a driving basket. He then helped to salt the game away with four-for-four free throw shooting and two field goals when the Irish spread out the offense. 
The Irish backcourt duo of Rivers and Hicks scored 21 and 17 points to lead the Irish, while Donald Royal also had 17, in-

Comebacks highlight Bengal Bouts in weekend's early-round contests 
By TERRY LYNCH Sports Writer 
In an improbable comeback, Steve "Slim" Riedl survived a first-round knockdown to claim a split-decison victory over Gerry "The Boston Strangler" Graf in the quaterfinal round of the 57th annual Bengal Bouts last night at the Stepan Center. 
Riedl, a sophomore Grace resident from Columbus, Ohio, used a late flurry of punches in the third round of the junior middleweight to claim the vic­tory. Graf appeared to have the advantage through two rounds, but Riedl drew blood from Graf, who seemed to lose both energy and momentum after the bloody nose. 
Three freshmen are making strong bids for titles in their respective divisions. David "Sugar" Cane won a split deci­sion over Mike "Candy Man" Canavan to continue his rise in the junior welterweight divi­sion. Cane, who scored a knock­out in his first match on Friday, used an opening flurry of punches to stagger Canavan. 
But Canavan, by this point sporting a bloody nose, put Cane on the ropes in the second round. It was not enough, however, as Cane, a South Bend nati'e, claimed the win. 
Bill "The Annhilator" Angrick, a Grace freshman from Clive, Iowa, lived up to his billing in the cruiserweight class with a win over Tim "The Jersey Devil" Lyons. Angrick overpowered his opponent from the opening bell, and stopped Lyons with a standing eight count in the first round. 
The bell saved Lyons in the first round, but the referee stopped the bout only 20 seconds into the second round. 
In the bloodiest bout of the evening, Steve "The Delaware Destroyer" Freschi mauled freshman Glenn Scamman in the light heavyweight class. After receiving a standing eight count early in the first round, Scamman started bleeding from the nose. 
Scamman was slapped with another standing eight count in the second round, and after that the bout was a bloodbath. If it had been at the infirmary, Scamman would have been given a complimentary donut and glass of orange juice. 
Unbelievably, Scamman put together two successive flurries of punches in a third­round comeback effort against the senior Freschi. By this time Scamman's face was com­pletely covered with blood, and the referee decided to end the bout at the 1:06 mark of the
