RABAT, morocco-A missile attack downed one of two DC-7 planes from the U.S. agency for International Development over Mauritania on Thursday, and all five people aboard were presumed dead, officials said. 
Th~ other plane was damaged by the anti-aircraft missiles but was able to fly on and land in Morocco, and no injuries were reported among those aboard. 
Official sources in this North African country suggested that rebels of the Marxist Polisario Front were to blame for the at­tack. The sources spoke on con­dition of anonymity. 
The attack occurred as both planes flew over a border area where nationalist rebels have waged a guerrilla war against . the Moroccan government to establish an independent West­ern Sahara. 
The area where the plane was shot down is 650 miles southwest of Rabat, the Moroc­can capital. 
In Washington, AID spokes­man Bart Kull said both planes were used for spraying locusts swarms in Senegal, which bor­ders Mauritania to the south.

Missiles down two U.S. planes in Mauritania 
Locust infestations have ravaged much of northern Africa this year. 
A spokesman at the U.S. em­bassy in Rabat said the two planes left Dakar, Senegal, earlier Thursday and were bound for the Moroccan city of Agadir when they came under fire from ground-to-air mis­siles. 
Moroccan government offi­cials said the two planes were fired upon while they were flying at 10,000 feet to 11,000 feet in an international naviga­tion corridor over Bir Mogh­rein, northern Mauritania. 
"The five crew members of the downed aircraft, all of whom are American citizens, are presumed dead," an AID statement said. "The crew members of the other plane had been taken to Agadir." 
The AID statement said the 

planes are owned by T & G 
Aviation of Chandler, Ariz., 
and are under contract to AID's 
Office of Foreign Disaster As­
sistance for locust spraying.

MOSCOW-Soviet authorities rushed military surgeons and tons of medical supplies Thursday into Armenia, rocked by an earthquake that officials said virtually destroyed several cities and killed tens of thousands of people. 
Armenian journalists said a Polit­buro commission led by Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov received preliminary estimates that up to 50,000 people died in the Wednesday earthquake, which measured 6.9 on the Richter scale. So­viet officials reported thousands of people were killed but provided no death toll. 
President Mikhail Gorbachev cut short his trip to the United States and flew home to lead a worldwide emer­gency rescue effort in the southern republic, which has a population of 3.3 million. 
"Urgent measures are being taken to help all those affected by this terrible tragedy, and I have to be there in this effort,'' said Gorbachev, who planned to fly to Yerevan after arriving in Mos­cow. He canceled planned trips to Cuba and Britain. 
President Reagan offered emer­gency humanitarian aid, Cuban Presi­dent Fidel Castro pledged to sent con­struction workers, and Britain dispatched London firefighters to join the rescue effort. 
Soviet TV showed a clock on a build­ing in the city of Leninakan, on the Turkish border near the epicenter of the earthquake, stopped at 11:41-the instant disaster struck. 
The earthquake destroyed two-thirds of Leninakan, Armenia's second­largest city with a population of 250,000 people, a TV correspondent said. 
Spitak, a town of 16,000 about 45 miles away, "was practically erased from the face of the Earth," the correspondent said. 
Tass said half the buildings in Kirovakan, a city of 150,000, had crumbled. 
A special meeting of representatives of all 15 Soviet republics was called in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, on Friday to discuss disaster relief. 
Soviet authorities dispatched doc­tors, engineers, food and medical sup­plies to the area, and helicopters ferried the injured northward to hospi­tals in neighboring Soviet Georgia, the Tass news agency reported. 
Tass said 2,300 people were hospi­talized in Yerevan with injuries from the quake and that 200 had been hospi­talized across the border in Georgia. It did not say how many of the injured were treated elsewhere. . For a second night Thursday, mil­lions of Soviet TV viewers saw soldiers searching for survivors and bodies in huge piles of concrete rubble, either by hand or with cranes. The disaster

Waiting is not just for the Advent season 
I spent last Christmas eve in the Munich air­
port waiting for a friend to arrive. 
I had to leave the ski chalet where over a 
hundred Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students 
were spending Christmas in Kitzbuehl, Austria, 
at 5 a.m. to get to the airport in time. 
I think I woke the majority of them up as I 
crawled out from under the warmth of my feat­
her comforter. We had spent the night both 
celebrating our togetherness and forgetting the 
thousands of miles between us and our families, 
so let's just say that I've felt better. 
A few other students who were studying in 
Rome and Angers joined me on our prolonged 
and painfully early journey. It began with the 
hike down the sadly snowless slope to meet a 
taxi which took us to the train station in 
Kitzbuehl. We had to transfer trains in Woergl 
and Jenbach before we finally arrived in 
Munich. From the train station there I took a 
bus to the airport. 
All of this before 9 a.m., which is when the 
plane was supposed to arrive. 
Originally I had been concerned that I wouldn't beat the plane. Well, I did. It was still sitting in London. 
German airports don't exactly operate like ours. There are only two monitors announcing which planes have actually landed, and I dis­covered they are less than accurate. At various times, I read my friend's plane had landed, that it was cancelled, and that it was en route. 
Others were waiting for the same flight and we got what little information we could. It looked like there would be a delay of four or five hours, so most of the others returned to their homes, hotels, or went to downtown Munich to check out the Christmas market. 
My Deutsch-Marks were limited, so all I could do was sit and wait. ~~ 
I had brought stuff along to read and work on for the trip. My plans for after Christmas were to travel to Paris and London with my friend, so I had a copy of Dickens' "Tale of Two Cities." I started some letters and Christmas postcards that I'm pretty sure are still in a box in my closet. 
Eventually my Sesame Street attention span expired and I took to looking around at the people coming home for Christmas. I guess my fifteen years of Catholic education caught up with me because something else dawned on me then. 
It was Advent, and this is what Advent is all about: waiting. 
When I was little the hours on Christmas eve seemed to creep by too. We used to go sledding in the afternoon, and maybe bake Christmas cookies. Even dinner dragged on as we have this tradition of having fondue on Christmas eve. We also draw names for gifts in my family, so I had to wait to open those gifts. And then I had to wait until midnight to go to Mass. I used to read books just to pass the time.

Assistant News Editor . 

Nothing can beat an entire day at the Munich airport, though. As the morning and finally af­ternoon dragged on, we became seriously in jeopardy of missing the last train back to Kitzbuehl. 
Unless Oktoberfest is on, Munich is not a fa­vorite spot of mine. And excited as I was to see my friend who was arriving, I wasn't too keen on spending Christmas eve in Munich away from my friends and my skis. 
My airport story does have a happy ending. My friend finally got there, he brought me the new Billy Joel tape, we caught the very last train to Kitzbuehl, and we arrived back at the chalet just as dinner was starting. 
We drank Gluhwein, this incredible hot spiced wine, sang Christmas carols, and then walked a few miles in the clear Austrian night to the little parish church that looks like it's straight off of some calendar. 
As college students, waiting is a part of our everyday lives. We wait for our meals, for tick­ets, for checkmarks. Right now we are all waiting for exams to be over and for vacation to start. Some of us are waiting for graduation, for the job offer, for the right person to come along, for life in the "Real World" to begin. 
Hey kids, wake up. This is the "Real World." Well, that may be debatable, but it is your real life to do with it what you will. Christmas al­ways comes after Christmas eve, sweet and sour pork awaits at the end of the proverbial dining hall line, and for most of us graduation will come after college.

U.S.A.F. plane crash kills four in W. Germany 

Associated Press 
REMSCHEID, West Germany-A U.S. Air Force warplane struck an apartment building and exploded in flames Thursday, killing the pilot and at least three other people, injuring more than a dozen, and setting homes on fire. 
"This looks like a war," said Johannes Rau, governor of North Rhine-Westphalia state, after touring the scene in central West Germany. 
Even after the initial explo­sion, ammunition carried on the plane continued to explode periodically, hampering res­cue efforts, one rescuer said. 
The U.S. Air Force suspended all tactical training flights in Europe until Tues­day, and West German aut­horities asked their allies to

Soviets offer 10 percent army cut 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK-Mikhail Gor­bachev's offer to cut the Red Army by 10 percent and withdraw 50,000 Soviet troops from Eastern Europe has not fully eased Western worries about a decisive Kremlin edge in men, tanks and artillery. 
Gorbachev's unilateral cuts and message of peace were likely to further enhance his soaring popularity in Western Europe, and to rekindle calls in Congress and NATO mem­ber states for withdrawal of some of the 335,000 U.S. troops in Europe. 
But Secretary of State George Shultz and other foreign ministers of the Atlan­tic alliance quickly said Gor­bachev's statements con­firmed their view that the Soviets. have enough non­nuclear armaments to mount a blitzkrieg offensive and tip the balance in opening days of an East-West conflict. 
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, in a statement issued after Gorbachev's U.N. speech on Wednesday, said "the Soviet Union itself pos­sesses more tanks and artillery than all the other members of the Warsaw Pact and the (NATO) Alliance combined. And they are concentrated in a manner which raises grave concerns about the strategy which they are intended to sup­port." 
NATO secretary-General Manfred Woerner said Gorbac­hev's move "seems to be a step in the right direction," but warned big imbalances would remain. 
West German Defense Mini­ster Rupert Scholz said Gor­bachev must follow up with "actual and verifiable withdrawal of troops and re­duction of forces." 
NATO, which cannot afford to match the Soviets soldier for soldier and tank for tank, has a policy of deterring a conven­tional attack with the threat of nuclear weapons, an approach that wags have summarized as "fight like the devil for two weeks, then blow up the world." 
The NATO nuclear deterrent 
and the perceived will to use it 
has faded, however, with the 
signing last December of a 
U.S.-Soviet treaty to eliminate 
intermediate-range nuclear 
weapons and continuing 
negotiations to sharply reduce 
long-range strategic arms. 

The Soviets have been tinker­ing with their doctrine, as well, declaring that they will main­tain forces adequate only to fend off an attack, not to launch one.

Japanese Finance Minister implicated in financial scandal 
Associated Press 
TOKYO-Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, impl­icated in a stock dealing scandal that damaged the governing party, reportedly resigned Friday to help clear opposition to passage of tax reform bills in parlia­ment. 
Miyazawa submitted his resignation during a resign to take responsibility for repeatedly giving con­flicting accounts about his role in the stock trading con­troversy, and they refused to resume parliamentary debate on the tax reform package until he did so. 
Miyazawa, a two-term finance minister and vet­eran politician, changed ac­counts of his involvement in the stock deals at least three times in his statements to parliamentary committees investigating the scandal. 
The controversy involves questionable purchases of stocks of Recruit Cosmos Co. by dozens of leaders of the governing Liberal Dem­ocratic Party, including Miyazawa, Takeshita and former Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe-Japan's top three politicians.

U.S. helicopter crashes in Honduras, five Americans die 

Associated Press 
TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras­A U.S. military helicopter par­ticipating in maneuvers crashed in northern Honduras on Thursday, killing all five Americans aboard, a U.S. em­bassy official said. 
Embassy spokesman Charles Barclay said the CH-47 Chinook helicopter crashed at 1 p.m. (2 p.m. EST) near La Ceiba, 235 miles north of Tegucigalpa. 
Barclay refused to identify the victims until their relatives are notified.

"Five people were on board the helicopter," Barclay said. "Up to now only four bodies have been recovered from the craft, which was practically destroyed." 
Honduran and U.S. military personnel formed a search team "to look for the other body" in the area, he said. 
Barclay said the Chinoo, which took off earlier Thursday from Palmerola, was flying a supply mission and taking part in joint Honduran-U.S. military exercises. 
About 1,500 American troops are in Honduras, including 1,100 soldiers permanently sta­tioned at Palmerola. Others rotate during the year for train­ing exercises, military con­struction work and other proj­ects. 
"We saw sparks, showers of sparks, like rain," said Ruben Cabadas, 18, recounting his family's flight from their home as its ruins smoldered. 
The blaze was contained at daybreak, said Inspector Chuck Gutierrez of the Los An­geles County Fire Department. There was no damage esti­mate. 
Ten homes were destroyed and 15 damaged in La Verne, 30 miles east, by a fire believed caused by a downed power line, Gutierrez said. About 300 people were evacuated before the 150-acre blaze was con­tained. 
"It literally rained embers across roofs," said firefighter Ron Sillo.

beginning of the 1989-90 aca­demic year as a "new organization" to the Office of Student Activities. 
The letter from Tyson to the Knights officers stated that the guidelines would be amended to show the Knights as under the supervision of Rocca. 
According to Joseph Cassidy, director of student activies, the Knights' constituion on file would have to be revised and updated. An advisor who is a full time faculty member or ad­ministrator must also be on file, said Cassidy. 
Also under Rocca's jurisdic­tion are such organizations as the Alumni-Senior Club and the University Marching Band. "I don't foresee being more in­volved that for the other organ­izations," said Rocca. 
Knights Field Consutant Richard Scheiber spoke with Rocca at the beginning of the investigation. Scheiber said that the Supreme Council is looking into the matter, but these investigations can move at "glacial speed sometimes." 
The Knights of Columbus building remains closed, with keys available only through Tyson's office, according to University Maintenance. Ac­cording to Rocca, it "remains to be determined" how the building will be used "or if they will regain total, complete, use." 
The Knights were originally granted the use of the building by then-University President Father Theodore Hesburgh, said York. York added that the University reserved the right to remove the Knights from the building "if the mission of the Knights conflicts with the mis­sion of the University," accor­ding to a letter from Hesburgh to the Knights. 
The Knights officers, however, are still displeased with the University suspension. "A lot of people have been trying to find out what's going on. It's really over with for this year," said Faehner. "We ap­pealed the decision, but were told that they would not recon­sider and that the decision stands." 
But Scott Berg was more regretful than angry. 
"The Knights of Columbus were capable of good things ... they donated to many worthy organizations. It's a shame it had to stop. "

Three black leaders given jail in S. Africa 
Associated Press 
PRETORIA, South Africa-A judge, Thursday, sentenced three black leaders of the country's biggest anti­apartheid group to what he called lenient jail terms of· 10 and 12 years for treason. 
Anglican Archbishop Des­mond Tutu joined other ac­tivists in condemning as "vi­cious" the sentencing at the close of a controversial three­year trial in which the nation­wide coalition United Demo­cratic Front was declared a revolutionary organization. 
Tutu also accused the gov­ernment of "playing games" by moving jailed African Na­tional Congress leader Nelson Mandela to a house on a prison farm. 
"Mr. Mandela is still a pris­oner," said Tutu. "Let the gov­ernment release him and all other political prisoners uncon­ditionally. Then they will see the enormous influence for good, for peace and reconcilia­tion that he will be." 
U.S. ambassador Edward Perkins was among several diplomats at Pretoria Supreme Court. In a statement, his em­bassy said the sentences were "not as harsh as they might have been" but regrettable be­cause those convicted were "men of good will working peacefully for a non-racial democracy." 
Patrick Lekota, 40, a spokes­man for the front, was sen­tenced to 12 years; 10-year terms were given to its national secretary Popo Molefe, 36, and Moses Chikane, 40, the Transvaal Province branch secretary; church field worker Thomas Manthata, 48, was sen­tenced to six years' jail, also for treason. 
Seven other defendants were convicted of terrorism. Six received suspended sentences and were banned for two years from talking to the press or participating in politics. The seventh is to serve five years in jail.

Free-trade talks suspended 
Associated Press 
MONTREAL-Trade negotiators agreed Thursday to postpone decisions on free­trade proposals for four months after it became clear that a stalemate over farm sub­sidies could derail fragile ac­cords on other issues. 
The agreement, subject to ratification by cabinet minis­ters on Friday, will avert the collapse of the talks by giving time for the United States and the European Economic Com­munity to compromise on the complex and emotional issue of agricultural subsidies and bar­riers. 
"Time heals a lot of wounds. In this situation, time provides additional opportunities for creative thinking," U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeut­ter said. 
Willy de Clercq, the EEC's commissioner for trade and ex­ternal affairs, said he was ''prudently optimistic'' that the April meeting would produce an agreement. 
"On the one side I'm disap­pointed because we did not achieve the results we came for. On the other side, I think there has been a good job here" in areas other than agriculture, de Clercq said.

A true celebration of Christmas 
As Christmas nears, it is easy to get fed up with the anti-commercialism cant that is preached from soap boxes or their equivalent on every street cor­ner and moralized by the moralists at every turn. But let's face it, the chal­lenge that confronts most of us at Notre Dame these days is how to be Christians in a bourgeois world. And the Christmas weeks make this painfully evident. 
Thomas D'Andrea 
inside out 
We know that Christmas is more than gifts and good spirits, and sleeping late and dumping the laundry on Mom, and cruising the town with high school friends, and marathons of television, and too much to eat and too little exer­cise. Or do we? Of course we do. But how do we know this? What kind of knowledge do we possess? 
There is a convenient and helpful dis­tinction one can make between objec­tive and subjective knowledge: the former just sits there, passive and inert--it is cerebral, mere information. The latter is knowledge that is integra­ted into the totality of one's being; it structures, informs and gives insight into the practice of one's life. It is not strictly knowledge that conditions the way one acts. And this subjective knowledge is a very potent thing; it has changed the course of lives of individ­uals, of peoples, of entire civilizations. 
Returning to Christmas can we not say that the diffuiculty for us is to know what the birth of Christ is all about in a more than objective way? The cor­ruption of the best is the worst, as the old axiom says. What could be worse than a purely objective knowledge of the coming of God into our world? What is more maddeningly banal than a season in which a host of symbols and symbolic acts, orchestrated so as to enshrine the significance of this most singular event in cosmic history, is mis­taken for a mere customary sequence of events we "experience" every year from early in December to early J anu­ary? 
Such is the case for a Christmas in bourgeoisdom, for a Christmas where the holiday serves as an occasion for intensified and joyless comfort-seeking (which always adds up to intensified selfishness), and where the weight of the very small material things around us oppresses our spirit and veils from us as a heavy cloak the glory of the coming of our King. 
But Christmas is not that way in Christendom and it never will be. And where is Christendom? Christendom is not a country, it is not the Church in its visible and hierarchical structure, it is not a culture or civilization that once was, like Hapsburg Spain or the Holy Roman Empire. It is that ever-fluid, ever-dynamic community with out geo­graphical bounds comprised of all those citizens of this earth, in their diverse races, nations, and cultures, in whom the law of Christ, and thus the peace and joy of Christ, reigns. And because, for now, the kingdom of God is not a place but within us (Christ himself said so), it is only in Christendom, that vast twilight habitation between time and eternity, that Christmas is truly appre­ciated so as to be truly celebrated. 
The choice is ours: will ours be a de­partment store Christmas where the season once again slips by without us beginning to comprehend the sig­nificance of its central event? Or will we really know our King this time when He comes, mixing his Divinity with our clay so as to make holy again a world spotted by sin? If we really know what Christmas is about, we will struggle once more to make room for the reign of the kingdom of God within us--Christ does not belong in a cave. Quite simply this means we will give Christ the King and his laws, which are not burdensome but bring freedom, more dominion over the practice of our lives.

P.O. Box Q 
Engineers defend their integrity 
Dear Editor: 
We are writing this letter to address the Inside column of Dec. 2 "Engineers should take an ethics course." To agree with a well known stereotype that en­gineers are not excellent writers, please bear with us. However, to dis­agree with the stereotype presented in the aforementioned article, engineer­ing students are in no way more uneth­ical than any other students at the Uni­versity. 
We will not deny that cheating occurs in the College of Engineering, but we would like to voice the opinion of the majority of engineering students who work diligently and honestly towards their degree. As in any other college, engineering students work together on various projects and assignments to en­sure we understand the material in the courses. Copying verbatim is not one of our policies. 
Indeed, it would be sad to see a des­perate engineering student "rooting through trash cans for computer pro­grams to copy verbatim." However, to address the writer's question: no, we have not figured out how many equa­tions we can "jam" into a program­mable HP. We have neither the time nor the desire to do so in order to have a dishonest advantage over our fellow engineers. 
Finally, we find little analogy be­tween the accidents of the cases the writer mentioned and cheating in engineering. In the Ford Pinto case, er­ror in the gasoline tank design was dis­covered in testing before production. It was upper management who decided that an improved design was more costly than human life. Similarly, in the 
Doonesbury 
A7D aircraft brake case, a projects manager, with only a high school diplo­ma, and upper management prevented a rookie engineer from correcting a flaw in another engineer's design. Maybe if the engineers had worked to­gether to correct the problem before it got out of hand, the scandal never would have occurred. 
Thus, it is a shame that some students in all colleges at the University resort to cheating. However, we found the ar­ticle's accusations extreme. As en­gineers, yes, we have a heavy workload. Yes, we usually need to work harder than the average college stu­dent. Yes, we are honest students that came to the University of Notre Dame to learn. Unfortunately, the writer of this article has not learned respect for the majority of his fellow engineers.

Thanks to Fazzie card-signers 
Dear Editor: 

On behalf of Amnesty International, we are writing to thank all students, faculty, and staff, for their recent sup­port of our Christmas card campaign. Over 2,100 cards were sent to our pris­oner of conscience, Henry Mutile Fazzie, who has been imprisoned in South Africa for over two years without charge or trial. We hope that these cards will prompt a response form the South African government. At the least, we hope that the cards provide a lift for Mr. Fazzie as he spends his third consecutive Christmas in jail. 
While all those who signed cards deserve thanks, a few people deserve special recognition. The Amnesty com­mittee which handled the event did an excellent job, and the support of all AI members was invaluable. The aid of the Center for Social Concerns was cri­tical to our success, as was the help of the dorm social service commissioners. We would also like to thank student gov­ernment for its support of the event, and Fr. Malloy for endorsing our proj­ect. 
A final thank-you is given to Campus Ministry, and in particular Fr. Leveille for his support. Fr. Leveille and his or­ganization were truly instrumental in sponsoring the Christmas card drive, as well as in having cards distributed and signed at dorm masses. 
Our only regret is that we did not have more cards available. We apologize to all those who wished to sign cards but couldn't, since all had already been sent. We were simply overwhelmed by the campus response.

Intifada resistance continues 
Dear Editor: 
Exactly one year ago today the Pal­estinian uprising, the Intifada, began. The Intifada is a non-violent resistance movement, in the spirit of the Anti­Apartheid movement in South Africa. With it has come a new Palestinian self­awareness, a realization that, although deprived of their rights, their property and even their lives, they can still main­tain their dignity, their identity, and

their dream of freedom. In the past year, 384 Palestinians were killed (some buried alive), thousands have been jailed, others deported, and many others maimed and crippled by beatings administered by the Israeli authorities. (Amnesty International has condemned this violence, much of which goes unquestioned by the govern­ment.) 
In support of the Intifada, the PLO issued the Algiers declaration of a Pal­estinian state, publicly recognized the United Nations' resolutions previously cited as a prerequisite to peace negotia­tions, condemned terrorism, and, as of Dec. 7, explicitly recognized the state of Israel. 
Israel and the US have responded negatively. Mr. Shamir has flatly refused to speak to the PLO. The United States has been unsupportive of an in­ternational conference under the aus­pices of the UN and has denied Mr. Arafat a visa. 
Meanwhile, the Intifada goes on. Meanwhile, the United States continues its unwaivering support of Israel, in the form of $3.7 billion, mostly in military aid, given freely each year. 
These are the realities of the Intifada. This is the challenge to the Notre Dame community this Christmas season. Will the new year bring another $3.7 billion to finance another 384 deaths, to break more bones and destroy more homes and lives? Will the new year bring an­other rejection of Mr. Arafat's peace initiative? Will it be another year under occupation for the Palestinians, deprived of the most basic human rights?

challenge. courage to  Now accept.  we  must  find  the

Defense of University apartheid policy 
Developing convictions that lead to action, especially action that leads to a better life for the less fortunate, is at the heart of our educational mission here at the University of Notre Dame. Those who take the time and effort to volunteer at Logan Center, work at the center for the homeless, tutor young students, demonstrate for worthy causes, serve the elderly and partici­pate in the numerous other activities for justice and charity are those who make Notre Dame the great commu­nity that it is. We need more, not less, of these activities. 
Oliver Williams 
guest column 
It is often the case that people of good will analyze a situation differently, per­haps focusing on different features of the same experience, and thus adv­ocate different strategies for resolu­tion. This is surely the case when it comes to a reality as complex as apar­theid in South Africa. Examining the ethical literature, it is clear that there are two major responses proposed by moralists in regard to foreign invest­ments in South Africa. One school of thought advocates total withdraw I of all foreign investments from South Africa; another argues for maintaining invest­ment as long as that investment ad­vances the cause of blacks, which is the dismantling of apartheid. There are reputable scholars writing on both sides of this issue throughout the United States. The debate goes on in the U.S. Congress, on campuses across the na­tion, and amongst the religious leaders, business executives and concerned citizens. 
I wish I could say that my position, selective divestment, is the absolutely true one. Of course, I cannot. It may be that in trying to eliminate such a complex reality as apartheid there is no one Christian strategy, but rather a plurality of strategies, each contribu­ting to the dismantling of that horrible system. History will finally be the judge. Meanwhile, I argue and work for what I judge to be the truth. 
In this light, it is with some sadness that I read Professor Peter W alshe writing in a style recently character­ized by one campus journalist as one where conspiracies are "more impor­tant than issues" ("Search For Divest­ment, Not Conspiracies," Scholastic, Nov.l7, 1988). The really sad dimension to all of this is that the methods of Pro­fessor Walshe seem to betray the lack of any sense of the colleagueship so es­sential to a vital community of scholars. To this day, Professor Walshe has never asked me, Professor Lee Tavis, or Father Hesburgh--the three targets of his articles this fall--our ver­sion of the facts. Considering this be­havior, to read Professor Walshe's let­ter criticizing The Observer for not checking with him before the Armstrong remarks were published would be humorous if it were not so sad. ("Shell Affair Raises Ethical Questions," The Observer, Dec. 5 ). 
The September issue of Common Sense makes some remarkable state­ments. From the article by Professor Walshe, we learn: 
"A leaked corporate report that has come into my possession shows that Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, Rev. Oliver Williams (Associate Provost) and Prof. 
Lee Tavis (Business School) are now in collusion with Shell..." 
"A key instrument for undermining church and university support for sanc­tions is to be a Shell-sponsored institute at Notre Dame." 
These are very serious accusations. These statements are all false, and I could have demonstrated that had I been asked. I outlined my understand­ing of the truth of the matter in a View­point column of Oct. 7. In that article I made it clear that no one at the Uni­versity was working with Shell or Pagan International on any project and that absolutely no funds had been dis­cussed, promised or accepted from ' anyone for a Center on South Africa. Professor W alshe responded in the Oc­tober issue of Common Sense that indeed such discussions had taken place and that money was promised ("corporate funds were made available for the Notre Dame Project"), imply­ing that the agent of Shell was none other than James Armstrong, former Methodist bishop of Indiana and past president of the National Council of Churches. 
Professor Armstrong, presently a faculty member at the Iliff School of Technology in Colorado, did meet with Father Hesburgh on June 9, 1988, and at that time made a suggestion that the Notre Dame Institute of International Peace Studies consider a Center on South Africa. Armstrong relayed to Fa­ther Hesburgh the consensus of et­hicists at two brainstorming sessions held in 1987 that a Center might be help­ful for the conflict in RSA. lfesburgh agreed to raise the issue with the In­stitute for International Peace Studies. Armstrong also noted that, since no fun­ding was available, Hesburgh would have to take on that challenge. Father Hesburgh made no promises but did agree to raise the Center possibility and think more about the matter. 
Is Professor Walshe correct in his im­plication that James Armstrong is an agent of Shell? Armstrong vigorously denies such a claim, writing: "Walshe's statement: 'Notre Dame is cooperating with a Shell campaign to take pressure off South Africa and to establish an Institute for the Study of Post-Apartheid Problems' is, to put it bluntly, a lie." Professor Armstrong has had a long history of church lead­ership and work for the poor as a bishop and as a layman. Author of numerous religious publications and recipient of seven honorary degrees, he now directs a center for conflict resolution based in a seminary. Until I see some evidence to the contrary, I believe Professor Armstrong. 
In the Dec. 5 Observer piece, Profes­sor W alshe finally presents to his readers the evidence that convinces him that Professor Armstrong is Shell's agent and that Shell is offering funding for a Center on South Africa. The evidence, we are told, is a Feb. 9, 1988, letter from James Armstrong to Father Hesburgh. The quote from James Armstrong's letter that Professor Walshe believes makes the case is this: "I am no longer with Pagan Interna­tional, the conflict resolution firm in Washington through which corporate funds were made available to pursue the Notre Dame project." 
What James Armstrong is saying here is what he has said any number of times and in his letter to Common Sense: that at one time he was a part-time consultant to Pagan International and in that capacity pursued a long­time dream of his to see a Center for South African Conflict Resolution es­tablished at a U.S. university. What he calls "the Notre Dame project" has also been labeled an Emory, Howard, and various other projects; the minutes of the brainstorming sessions show that several schools might well be invited to consider the Center idea. If Professor W alshe had asked, I would have pro­vided some fifty pages of documents and some interpretation to put sen­tences in a context. I was a member of the brainstorming sessions and had first-hand familiarity with the strengths, weaknesses and origins of the Center idea. Armstrong is not an agent of Shell. As he says in his letter to Common Sense: "My views on South Africa are well documented and were not dictated by Shell, Pagan, or anyone else." Armstrong pursued his Center idea before, during and after working as a consultant for Pagan Interna-

tionaf. 

On the questions of funds for the pro­posed Center, it was always clear in the brainstorming sessions that there were none available and that they must be raised. The minutes of the Oct. 1987 brainstorming session indicate this in several places. 
Professor Walshe makes another remarkable statement in the Dec. 5 Ob­server letter. He writes: "Without my serendipitous receipt of a considerable amount of documentation--minutes and letters--Williams and Armstrong's at­tempt to mislead Notre Dame might well have succeeded." Whom does he think sent him the documentation? In June 1988 Father Hesburgh, as chair of the Board of the Institute, asked Pro­fessor John Gilligan, Director of the In­stitute for International Peace Studies, to think about the feasibility of a Center on South Africa. He provided Gilligan with some documentation giving back­ground to the Center idea. These docu­ments were not considered confidential and, in fact, were provided so that Gil­ligan might share them with interested faculty. The purpose of sending the documentation was to allow the faculty to decide the merits of the Center sug­gestion. It certainly is fair for Professor Walshe to judge that the Center sug­gestion is flawed, but it is ludicrous to say that he discovered a conspiracy using as evidence the very documents provided by the so-called conspirators. 
The sad fact is, according to Profes­sor Gilligan, Professor Walshe has never spoken to Gilligan about the doc­uments since they were given to him, and thus Walshe has had little oppor­tunity to understand a context. For ex­ample, Gilligan assures me that he was told from the start that no funding was available and it would have to be raised. 
Before publishing a version of 
"facts," most scholars would have con­sulted with some of those listed as pres­ent at the brainstorming sessions or others involved. If Professor Walshe had so consulted, he could not have written as he did. For the record, et­hicists at the brainstorming sessions in­cluded Father David Hollenbach, S.J., of Woodstock Center at Georgetown University; Father Rollins Lambert, Advisor for African Affairs and Human Rights Issues for the U.S. Catholic Con­ference; Robert Benne, of Roanoke School of Theology; Jon Gunneman, of Emory University Divinity School; Prakash Sethi, of City University of New York; Peter Storey, of the South African Council of Churches; Philip Wogaman, Wesley theological Semi­nary, and me. All those participating in the brainstorming sessions were not present as representatives of institu­tions but only as scholars with some competence in ethics or South African affairs. Incidentally, at least two of the above are strong proponents of eco­nomic sanctions. 
One of the central tenets of Professor Walshe's conspiracy theory has a logic which continues to escape me. He argues that the Center is supposedly conceived to "shift the atten­tion....away from sanctions and the boycott of Shell products to the prob­lems of a post-apartheid society." The sort of Center discussed in the two brainstorming sessions I was a part of would do no such thing. 
The best illustration of common sense that I have found in all of this discussion was that contained in the Nov. 17, 1988, Scholastic editorial "Stay Away From Conspiracy Hunting." In this light, I think that it is important to say that the administration of the University has not ignored the apartheid problems in South Africa. Father Malloy serves on the board of the South African Edu­cation Programs of the Institute of In­ternational Education. This group, chaired by Harvard President Derek Bok, responding to black South African leaders, raises funds and places hundreds of black South Africans in graduate programs in U.S. univer­sities. Notre Dame has had some of these students in our graduate school. Our law school educates some South Africans in a graduate program on civil rights. Under the sponsorship of Provost Timothy O'Meara, with the Student Activities Board, several im­portant programs of The Year of Cul­tural Diversity focus on South-Africa. Along with two major black leaders, I have accepted an invitation to join the three-person National Advisory Coun­cil to the 66 U.S. companies still oper­ating in South Africa. Our role as ad­visors will be to offer advice to the companies on how they might be more effective in dismantling apartheid in South Africa. This mission will take me to South Africa in February to examine the current situation first-hand and to reappraise my position. 
Are all these endeavors enough? As we prepare ourselves this Advent to celebrate the birth of Christ, we are reminded that we can all do more for justice. Let's all pray that we all have a blessed Christmas with our loved ones and that we never forget, in word and deed, the least advantaged both in our own communities and in South Africa.

FIESTA BOWL 
'fear not brave roadtrippers...' 

JOHN BLASI assistant accent editor 


Just think ... in less than a week finals will be over, Christmas will be on its way and the 

moment when the Irish face the Mountaineers in the Fiesta Bowl will be only 17 days away. 
If most of the Notre Dame roadtrippers are as prepared as I am for the bowl game they have already obtained their plane reservations and are presently scrambling around for hotel reservations. The last thing they're worried about is where they're going to spend New Year's Eve and meet their friends from the other side of the continent. 
But fear not brave roadtrip­pers, here is a list of sugges­ted restaurants, bars, clubs, and pre-post game activities in the stadium area. The best place to look for a listing of bands and concerts is a news­paper called the New Times-­I'm told it's a Bible to resi­dents of the Valley. 
Good luck, and be careful-­you're not in South Bend anymore, and of course, go Irish.

The 1989 Fiesta Bowl: a tale of two quarterbacks 
Rice has beaten the odds for ND 
By BRIAN O'GARA Sports Writer 
There have been a lot of knocks on Tony Rice since he first came to Notre Dame three years ago. 
First the critics scoffed at his SAT scores, which kept him on the sidelines during his fresh­man campaign. Next came questions about his ability to fill the quarterback role left vacant by the injured Terry Andrysiak last October. 
And once Rice had earned the signal-calling duties early this fall, the knocks on his arm and his passing were soon to follow. 
But there is one complaint that no one can have against the Woodruff, S.C. native. No one can say that Tony Rice does not know how to win. 
"All summer I heard people say we could never be a great team with Tony Rice as our quarterback because he can't throw," said Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz. "I'm not par­ticularly concerned about sta­tistics or anything else. Just  look at his record. As a starter he is 15-2, and that's with wins over USC (twice), Alabama, Michigan, Pitt, Miami. That's rather impressive if you ask me." 
Nothing has symbolized the obstacles Tony Rice has faced, and overcome, more than Notre Dame's 27-10 win over Southern California in the reg­ular season finale. 
As a Proposition 48 victim two years ago, Rice stayed be­hind while his teammates traveled to USC and pulled out a 38-37 come-from-behind vic­tory. 
Two years later, again at the Los Angeles Coliseum, Rice was at his finest, directing a 27-lOwin in a season-ending No. 1 vs. No. 2 matchup. One lin­gering memory from the win over USC is Rice scampering down the sideline for a 65-yard touchdown--the longest of his career. 
"I was looking for the man I was supposed to pitch out for,

Pressure is no major problem for West Virginia's Harris 


By SHELLY POE Mountaineer Illustrated 
There may be only one image ..nat describes the life Major Harris has been asked to lead. lately--the calm inside the storm. 
In the heat of battle on the football field while the veteran offensive line sends off charg­ing defenders under the sweaty glare of television lights or the unflinching accuracy of a tape recorder, Harris never blinks. 
If he's caught in the middle of a broken play, he swerves and makes up the yardage him­self. If he's accosted by a fan snapping pictures outside the Facilities Building, he smiles. 
And if he's edging close to meeting time and an interview is running long, he politely finishes. And when he's asked for his autograph for the umpteenth time, he signs. 
It takes a lot to shake the un­flappable Major Harris. 
Which is not exactly what his reputation is built upon--that glamorous image of the boy quarterback with the helter­skelter, . jitterbug moves that have transformed him and his marquis name into a persona of major proportions. 
Only a sophomore, Harris has placed fifth in the Heisman Trophy balloting and has led West Virginia to its first-ever unbeaten and untied regular season. 
The Mountaineers will be playing for the national cham­pionship Jan. 2largely because of Harris' explosive talents directing the West Virginia of­fensive attack. The Pittsburgh native has completed 92-of-160 passes for a completion rate of 
57.5 percent. Harris has thrown 13 touchdown passes with just seven interceptions. 
Harris also is third on the team in rushing with 599 yards. He has averaged five yards a carry and 54.5 yards per game while rushing for six touch­downs. 
Harris has become a legend within the Mountain State, where youngsters sport No. 9 apparel and mimic his every move. He is hometown hero in Pittsburgh, where his school­boy smile and gravel-v,Jiced tones appear weekly on the eve­ning news.

Starns and Pritchett: ND Hfootball's clown princes 
Free-spirited seniors find 
unique ways to lead squad 
By MARTY STRASEN Sports Editor 
When Frank Starns and Wes Pritchett are not earning their way into the national spotlight with their play on the Notre Dame defense, they sneak in. 
Irish head coach Lou Holtz found that out during practice one day, while being inter­viewed for a CNN national sports report. The cable net­work used field microphones to get the effect of hitting in the background, but instead got what sounded like the voices of Notre Dame's assistant coaches. 
"Nice going, Pritchett," one voice yelled into the microp­hone. "You're going to be a great one." 
"Atta boy Starns," shouted the other. "Keep that up and you're going to be an All­American." 
Lou Holtz could not contain his smile in front of the camera. He knew who thought so highly of his free-spirited fifth-year seniors: Starns and Pritchett themselves. 
"We were just giving our­selves a plug," explains Pritchett. "You never know when somebody you know might be watching." 
But Pritchett and Starns are at their best when people are not watching. That's when they really go to work, earning their reputation as the clown princes of the top-ranked Notre Dame football team. 
Consider a brief highlight film: 
 
Starns and freshman linebacker Troy Ridgley find defensive line coach Joe Palermo's Philadelphia hoagie, which was hand delivered by a friend from Pennsylvania. The two eat the hoagie, leaving a note that reads, "Thanks for the hoagie, Coach. Stoney (Mike Stone breaker) and I really en­joyed it." They sign the letter "Wes." 

 
Starns places a blue stripe on Pritchett's helmet early in the fall, when every freshman wore a stripe until he earned the right to take it off. Pritchett wonders what he did wrong, and when he discovers what happened, he puts the stripe on senior linebacker Ned Bolcar's helmet. 


When removing it, Bolcar rips the air valve on his helmet and loses all the protective air in it. He misses half a session. 
"It's like having no padding in your helmet," Pritchett said. "He was pleased about that," Starns added.

The big enchilada. All the marbles. 
The whole ball of wax. 
Get out your book of cliches, call it 
what you want, but this one's for the 
national championship. 
For Notre Dame, at least. 

If Notre Dame wins the Fiesta Bowl 
on Jan. 2 in Tempe, it will have won its 
eighth official national championship, 
capped off its 12th unbeaten, untied 
year and completed its first-ever 12-0 
season. 
If the West Virginia Mountaineers 
overcome the odds and topple the Irish, 
the situation may be a little stickier. If 
the Miami Hurricanes win impres­
sively over Nebraska in the Orange 
Bowl, 11-1 could win out over 12-0 by 
virtue of the dubious "tougher 
schedule." 
"Schedules are something you can't even get into," said West Virginia head coach Don Nehlen. "We're a Division I football team and we're undefeated and so is Notre Dame. We're the only ones left. At the end of (the Fiesta Bowl) there will be one undefeated team. That team will be the national champion." 
"West Virginia may very well be the best team in the country at the present time," said Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz. "Offensively, we're looking at a team that's much better than us, primarily because of their speed at wide receiver and strength at offensive line. 
"Joe Paterno told me that West Vir­ginia is a great football team. Pitt man­handled us, and West Virginia is better than that up front. They're bigger and more physical." 
Holtz also pointed to a pair of indi­viduals he worries about. 
"Their fullback (Undra Johnson) is probably the best we've played against, maybe the best in the country," Holtz said. "Their wide receivers have the speed of Pitt's receivers and the hands of Southern Cal's receivers. <Quarterback) Major Harris throws the ball like Rodney Peete and scrambles like a combination of Peete and Pitt's Darnell Dickerson." 
Of course, comments like these are a little more justified in preparation for West Virginia than were similar praises for mighty Rice and Navy. The Mountaineers are fired up and not to be underrated. 
Holtz will make sure they're not. 
Notre Dame offense vs. West VIrginia defense 
In Notre Dame's impressive 27-10 vic­tory over Southern Cal, the Irish of­fense was somewhat less than impres­sive. Holtz placed most of the blame on the offensive line, but it may have had something to do with the absence of the team's then-leading rusher and leading receiver. 
"(Against USC), I was extremely dis­appointed offensively," said Holtz, who

Anthony Brown leads the Moun­taineers with 913 yards rushing on 167 attempts this season, for an average 
is 1-1 against West Virginia, both times in the Peach Bowl when he coached North Carolina State. "I thought Andy Heck played really well, but outside of that we just aren't very good on the offensive line. If you can't run the foot­ball, you're just kidding yourselves." 
The Irish rushed for 162 yards against Southern California, nearly 100 yards below their average of 258 yards per game. Chances are that will be the area of concentration when preparations for the Fiesta Bowl resume on Dec. 16. 
Look for Mark Green, Anthony Johnson and Tony Brooks to grind it out on the ground against a West Virginia defensive front line which might not have faced as consistent a running game as Notre Dame has shown this year. 
No major changes are planned as of now in the Irish offensive scheme, and both Tony Brooks and Ricky Watters are cleared to play in the Fiesta Bowl. 
A deep West Virginia defense fea­tures nine starting seniors, including punter Lance Clarion. The Moun­taineers suit up an incredible 24 fifth­year seniors. 
Their effective 5-2 defensive front in­cludes seniors Chris Parker, Scott Sum­mits and Mike Fox at the tackles, senior Renaldo Turnbull at one end and junior Chris Haering at the other. Turnbull

West Virginia's is a defense which has given up 3,144 total yards, mostly passing yards late in games that have gotten out of hand. The Mountaineers have allowed 1,538 yards rushing on 466 attempts for only a 3.3 yards per carry average. 
Of course, that is reason for concern on Holtz's part. 
"Defensively," said Holtz, "I don't see much difference between the two teams (West Virginia and Notre Dame). They just shut down Pitt's of­fense and we had some trouble with it. Their defense is similar to Michigan's and USC's in terms of personnel and scheme."

West VIrginia offense vs . Notre Dame defense 

Now we come to the crucial question 
of the ballgame: Can Notre Dame's 
highly-touted defense stop Major Har­
ris and company? Harris has com­
pleted 58 percent off his passes, thrown 
for over 1,700 yards, is the third-leading 
rusher on the team and finished fifth in 
the Heisman Trophy balloting? 
He's the only Mountaineer you ever 
hear about, right? 
Perhaps, but don't let publicity judge 
this offense. 
Five Mountaineer backs, including 
Harris, average five yards per carry 
or better. Tailback Anthony Brown has 
913 yards in 10 games and running back 
Undra Johnson is the second-leading 
rusher on the team (704 yards, team­
high 11 touchdowns), despite starting 
only one of 11 games this year. 
West Virginia has several burners at 
the wideout spots, with the probable 
starters for the Fiesta Bowl being Cal­
vin Phillips (24 catches for 611 yards, 
25.5 yards per catch) and Reggie Rem­bert (22.7 yards per catch, 7 TDs). Keith Winn is a dependable tight end whom Harris isn't afraid to go to (13 for 180, fourth-leading receiver). 
The offensive line which has sprung the backs and given Harris all kinds of time is a veteran, all-senior bunch led by 6-4, 297-pound right tackle Brian Smider. The line averages 6-3, 275­pounds across and is rounded out by John Stroia and Bob Kovach at the guards, Kevin Koken at center, and Rick Phillips at left tackle. 
The placekicker is Charlie Baumann, a four-year starter with a career mark of 32-of-43 field goals (.744), but whose career long is only 44 yards. 
"West Virginia's offensive line is probably the best we've faced all year long," said Holtz. "Right now, they're much, much better than our offensive line. But the guy that really makes it happen is Major Harris. He's elusive and throws the ball extremely well. Overall, they're superior to Notre Dame offensively." 
Perhaps, but so were Miami and Southern Cal before the Irish played them. 
The scrambling and explosiveness of Harris and West Virginia's big-play of­fense poses a problem for Irish linebacker Wes Pritchett and the Notre Dame defense. 
"Obviously, Harris is a great runner and a great passer," said Pritchett. "If you can't contain him, your defense is in trouble." 
"I don't think we're as much a big­play team as West Virginia is," said Holtz. "We'd prefer not to be. We'd prefer to be more consistent. But of course, their explosiveness worries me." 
For Holtz and the Irish, only one game remains for the national cham­pionship. If they win, not even Holtz will be able to question who's the best team in the land. 
MOUNTAINEERS TO WATCH 

Major Harris (QB) 

Regarded as the best quar­terback in West Virginia history, the sophomore finished fifth in the Heisman balloting. Harr.is is a great runner and threw for 1,749 yards this year. 
Anthony Brown (TB) 
Brown rushed for 913 yards on 167 carries in 1 0 games this season for an average of 5.5 yards a carry. The powerful senior often requires more than one tackler per play. 
Theron Ellis (LB) 

Ellis is the No. 2 tackler on the squad with 90 stops. The hard-hitting sophomore has good speed and is especially ef­fective on the Mountaineers' pass rush. 
Chris Haering (LB) 
The junior is the mainstay of the West Virginia defense, leading the team in tackles with 
126. Haering has started every game over the past two years for the Mountaineers. 
Undra Johnson (FB) 
The senior has ·seen time at both tailback and fullback for the Mountaineers, and ranks second on the team with 704 yards on 139 carries for an a\lerage of 5.1 per rush.

lot more confident. A lot of people said we hadn't played a difficult schedule up until then." 
The 51-30 dismantling of Penn State on CBS television exposed West Vir­ginia to the rest of the nation as well. Penn State had an off-year, as its 5-6 record indicates, but West Virginia later crushed 9-2 Syracuse 31-9 on ESPN. 
West Virginia averaged 60,497 fans per game this season in Mountaineer Stadium, which holds 63,500. The Syracuse and Penn State games each drew over 65,000 fans. 
Although the first few home games did not sell out, West Virginia observers insist that is no way to judge the loyalty of the Mountaineer fans. 
"They supported a team that was 4-7 two years ago," said Furfari. "They're not fair-weather fans by any means."

 Starns and Pritchett put "Red Hot" in Ridgley's helmet on an 87-degree, two-a-day practice session in August. 
"Everybody else was 87 degrees; Ridgley was about 105," Stams,says. 
 Another Ridgley gem: With the Irish well ahead of Purdue in the second half, Starns and Pritchett notice that Ridgely is getting anxious to get in the game. So Pritchett stands behind Starns and Irish defensive coordinator Barry Alvarez, and yells, "Ridgley," in his best coach's voice. 
Ridgley jumps up and stands next to Alvarez, who asks the freshman what he wants. 
"He's such easy prey," Starns says of Ridgley, "because for a freshman, he's so outspoken. He leaves him­self open." 
This story will leave out details of the tandem's near X­rated appearance on WVFI radio's "Speaking of Sports" show, and the hundreds of un­printable lockerroom antics. You get the picture. 
Of course, Pritchett and Starns know when to take the game of football seriously. 
Pritchett, an inside 
linebacker and team co­
captain, leads the Irish in 
tackles with 112. Starns, a de­

fensive end, leads the team in 
sacks with seven and also has 
broken up four passes. 
The two terrorized Southern 
Cal quarterback Rodney Peete 
in Notre Dame's 27-10 victory 
over the Trojans in the last 
game of the regular season. They played no practical jokes on Peete; they just gave him a sound spanking. 
Holtz says he realizes the value of his seniors' non-stop comedy hour. He has recog­nized all season that this year's squad has a chemistry that works. 
"They have more fun than any kids in a sandbox," Holtz says. "Frank Starns and Wes Pritchett are always playing games. One of the key in­gredients in life is to look to have fun in everything you do." 
These guys do. 
"We like to have fun," Pritchett says. "That's been the key this year. It's not a con­scious effort on our part to al­ways have fun. We just enjoy playing for Notre Dame, and what we do is a result of that." 
But you might not want to believe everything you read in this story. You see, Pritchett and Starns have been known to victimize reporters with their pranks. 
For instance, Pritchett was once asked by a local reporter how he manages to keep up his studies and play football at the same time . 
"I told him that was nothing compared to the modeling I do on the side," laughs Pritchett. "I told him I also choreograph plays in my spare time, and he

And one time a campus joyed badminton and teather reporter asked Starns about ball. He told the guy I could play around all day in the park during the summer,'' Pritchett says. "It got in the story. I've never played badminton or teather ball in my life."

From Webber to 
Shakespeare: 
the Theater 
FRANCIS FEELEY accent writer 
A
ll the world's a stage," and this 
couldn't be more 
true than in Lon­
don's theatreland. 
The "West End" London's 
equivalent to N~w York's 
Broadway, is a cluster of 
theatres centered roughly 
around Picadilly Circus, 
Leicester Square and Covent 
Garden. 

London's playland is simply 
nirvana for the theatre lover. 
At any given time, a London 
theatregoer or visitor may 
choose from among approxi­
mately sixty West End 
productions, in addition to 
Fringe Theatre perfor­
mances, operas and ballets. 
The London stage is made 
up of both commercial and 
subsidized productions, unlike 
theatre in the U.S. which is 
almost stricly commercial. 
The Arts Council annually 
receives and distributes a 
large grant, a considerable 
portion of which is used to 
fund subsidized theatrical 
productions. 
Since World War II, the two 
main channels for drama sub­
sidies in London have been 
the National Theatre (NT) 
and the Barbican Centre, the 
home of the Royal Shake­
speare Company (RSC). 
The aims of subsidized 
theatre are twofold: to make 
the theatre affordable and ac­cessible to everyone and to allow the production of many works which would otherwise be too great of a financial risk for a commercial producer to undertake. 
The result of having both commercial and subsidized prod~ctions is the perpetua­tion of an incredibly vast and broad selection--everything from Shakespeare to Andrew Lloyd Webber. The theatre is utilized for purely artistic pursuits, for entertainment and as a social vehicle. 
Londoners frequent the theatre as regularly as many Americans attend the movies. Most theatres have money­saving schemes for students and senior citizens. In fact, the Leicester Square Ticket Booth sells tickets to personal callers on the day of the per­formance for half-price. 
Keeping abreast of what's on in London is no problem: London Theatre Guides can be found on almost every street corner, and the weekly "Time Out" contains a full listing as well as reviews of new productions. 
These conveniences make it even easier for patrons to turn to the theatre to be "en­largened, enlivened and en-, lightened." The most difficult task is deciding what to see. 
Speaking for myself and for any other prospective Notre Dame Londoner, the choice of what to see is very simple: Everything. 
Lager, ale and strongbow: the public house 
CHRIS COMPONOVO  AND BRIAN LAPPS accent writers 
W
e do not en­courage irrespon­sible drinking." Al­though the attitude of the London ad­ministration is the same as the one in South Bend, there is little that can be done to prevent the students from drinking in the United Kingdom. With a nationwide drinking age of 18 and a vari­ety of pubs to choose from, the pleasures of enjoying a "mellow night" out with the gang increases exponentially. 
With the closing of the Notre Dame Pub (which until this year had served beer during the day) the students were forced to turn elsewhere in order to have a drink. For­tunately, this task was not difficult as London is teeming with pubs. 
The word pub is derived from the term, "Public House," which carne into existence due to a growing need for a public meeting place where friends could gat­her and enjoy one another's company. As a result they are usually less crowded, more relaxed than United States bars and offer both lunch and dinner specials. 
It is not unusual to find people from all walks of life having chicken-n-chips or kidney-n-pork pie with a pint. Also English beer is served in a pint glass rather than in a measly 12 ounce American bottle. 
Along with a larger serving size comes a greater variety of beverages to choose from. 
Of course they come the traditional English way, 
anywhere from lukewarm to slightly chilled; beer taps dominate the length of the bar. Lager, the British term 
for what Americans consider regular beer, is plentiful yet nothing to write home about. (Not that we write anyway.) 
Bitter and brown ale, slightly stronger than Lager, and unique to Britain, are dis­pensed from ivory hand pumps. Bitter ale has a decreased amount of carbona­tion and its taste is pretty self -explanatory. Brown ale is distinctively flavored and usually does not sit well in American stomachs. 
For those strong of palate and heedless of calories, Guinness Extra Stout is al­ways available. The Notre Dame favorite is Strongbow, an alcoholic cider, which al­ways hits the mark. Live music, frequently available on Wednesday nights, en­hances the drinking experi­ence. 
For the homesick Domer who misses the smoke filled, overcrowded and overrated Bridget's, London provides its version, Ashes! 
If a pleasant English pub is more your liking, the Daniel Goch is close by (near Budgens supermarket). 
And for, a quick pint in be­tween classes, the Goat & Shelley's is right next door to school. 
As you can see, there are plenty of different places to be with friends plus enjoy a variety of drinks, and as you may have guessed this was the best research paper we have ever done.

Is Christmas another media event? 
D
o you ever get the feeling that Christmas is another media event, and that if it were left up to the churches to promote this feast, Christmas would get about as much attention as Groundhog's day? The priests can rant and rave all they want about putting Christ back into Christmas, but the priests need the Grinch, 
ween masks, and the malls turn into Toyland. In Manhat­tan, restaurants like Luc­how's feature their Christmas goose, and everyone goes to see Rockefeller Center and the toys in the window at 
F.A.O. Schwarz's. Religion doesn't have the money to compete with the businesses in setting up elaborate dis-

Father Robert Griffin 
Letters to a Lonely God 

Rudolf, the little drummer 
boy, Santa Claus and the 
partridge in a pear tree, as 
much as the stores need 
them. 

The same hype that gets people to go shopping also gets them to go to Mass on Dec. 25. That's the pastor's­one big day, when he gets his share of the take, and it's only fair that he should. But does he know that every time Bing Crosby is on the radio, dreaming of a white Christmas, he makes it possi­ble for pastors to dream of having a green Christmas when the collection plates are passed? 
I'm not a cynic who is hanging a guilt trip on the clergy or endorsing Lucy Brown's opinion of Christmas as a racket run by an Eas­tern syndicate, but look what happens. The media blitz starts in October with "I Saw Mommie Kissing Santa Claus," and ends on Christmas Eve with Handel's "Messiah." By Christmas 
night you can tell that the 
disc jockeys are experiencing 
burn-out by the weariness in 
their voices as they introduce 
"Jingle Bell Rock" one last 
time. 

In the shopping centers, 
mistletoe replaces the Hallo-
plays honoring the Prince of 
Peace. St. Patrick's Cathe­
dral isn't a big tourist attrac­
tion the week before 

Christmas, unless the tourists 
stop there to make a visit on 
their way to see the camels 
and dromedaries on stage in 
the Christmas show at Radio 
City Music Hall. 
By the time the churches, 
finally finished with Advent, 
start their celebration of 
Christmas at Midnight Mass, 
the party's over for another 
year, as far as the people 
who don't pray are con­
cerned. At mid-afternoon on 
Dec. 25, the vendors are sell­
ing expensive wreaths and 
trees at a fraction of their 
original prices. By evening, 
they're giving them away. 
The next day, spruces that 
sold for fifty dollars apiece, 
are trash on the sidewalks 
waiting to be hauled to the 
dump. 
By Jan. 1, the world is 
thoroughly pagan again, and 
hung over from New Year's. 
Hallmark is huckstering St. 
Valentine's cards, and if it 
weren't for the bills, you'd 
never know there had been a 
Christmas. On Jan. 6, Cat-holies are wondering why on love seems incomparably beautiful. Believing in love, I can, as God's child, be at home with those who love me. If love is a lie, life itself is bad news, but "all the way to

The paraphrase of a poem is much less wonderful than the poem itself. The exegesis of Scripture is less wonderful than the Scripture itself. The Gospels are documents of faith, but a paraphrase or exegesis of the Gospel isn't a document of faith. If you want to learn about the mys­tery and beauty of Christmas, you should read the accounts left by the evangelists, who told the story first. The story they gave us had the star, the Magi, the angels, and the rest. If you leave them out of Christmas, you could lose your direction on the way to the Christ Child.

Connor satisfied after switching to football team ­
By THERESA KELLY Assistant Sports Editor 
The chance to play on a na­tional championship team can overshadow a lot of missed op­portunities. 
Notre Dame back-up punter Sean Connor is learning just that this season. Connor, a senior from Zeigler, Ill., gave up his spot on the Irish basket­ball team to try to win the pun­ting job on the football team. 
And despite the fact that Jim Sexton won the starting posi­tion this fall, and Connor has punted only two times for a total. of 63 yards, Connor's ver­dict on his decision is that is definitely w.as a good thing. 
"I had the desire to play foot­ball," Connor says. "I'd missed it since high school, and I wanted to play again. The punter (Vince Phelan) graduated, and the job was open. I thought maybe there

would be a chance that I could win the job." 
Connor played football at Zeigler-Royalton High School in southern Illinois, earning four letters at quarterback, safety and punter as captain of the team for three years. As a sophomore, he led his team to a 12-0 record and the Illinois Class A state title. 
The success may be trans­formed into a national title, but Connor will have a lesser role. 
"I tried too hard early," Con­nor says. "Punting is similar to a golf swing. You have to have a smooth swing to get the b(!st results. I wasn't doing that. I was trying too hard, and it showed. 
''There was some pressure, but it was all pressure I put on myself. None of it came from the outside. It was all from myself. It's easy to say after the season that I could've done something different, but the first time, you can't say that. I had to prove to myself I could

play, and I tried a little too hard." Despite biding his time on the sidelines, Connor doesn't regret his decision. 
"It's been quite an experi­ence," he says. "I am having a great time and learning a lot

during Christmas break. Fol­lowing is a capsule preview of each of these games: VAL­PARAISO: Notre Dame will try to continue its history of suc­cess against Valparaiso when it visits the Athletics &Recrea­tion Center. 
The Irish hold a 30-1 all-time record against the Crusaders, including an 8849 rout last year in the JACC. Valpo last defeated Notre Dame during the 1920-21 season, toppling the Irish 32-26 in a low-scoring af­fair. 
First-year coach Homer Drew leads a Crusader team that went 12-16 a year ago. In a pre-season exhibition game, Valpo routed Zadar of Yugos­lavia, a team Notre Dame defeated 81-78 in a pre-season contest.

about the game. Being unde­feated and playing in the Fiesta Bowl, that would be enough to make anyone happy.'' 
Connor arrived at Notre Dame as one of the best small­school basketball players in Il­linois. As a high school junior, he led the state in scoring with 
33.5 points per game and was a two-time all-state selection. He averaged 28.4 points and 9.6 rebounds a game his senior year, and and he came toNotre Dame to join a team that in­cluded David Rivers, Donald Royal, Gary Voce and Ken Bar­low. 
The team Connor left was completely different from the 1985-86 team. Connor would have been the only senior on the team. 
"The basketball team is fun to watch this year," Connor said. "I know the guys on the team are very excited. I think 
off one major upset this season. 
Led by Walt Frazier III, this Ivy League school stunned Vil­lanova earlier this week. Frazier, a 6-2 guard, is one of four lettermen returning from last year's 10-16 squad. 
Center Hassan Duncombe, guard Tyrone Gilliams and guardforward Dane Watts also return for Penn. 
SAN FRANCISCO: Notre Dame begins a three-game West Coast swing Jan. 7 in Memorial Gymnasium, where the Irish will meet the Dons of the West Coast Athletic Confer­ence. 
San Francisco is 3-2 after winning its first three games. Since opening the season with victories over Pan American, Idaho State and California­Irvine, the Dons have fallen to California and Nevado-Reno. -Mark McCathrion, a 6-8 senior forwardlcenter, is moving up the USF all-time scoring list with over 1,000 points during his San Francisco career. Since recovering from an ankle injury, McCathrion (co-captains) Jamere 
(Jackson) and Joe (Fredrick) would have been team leaders no matter who was playing on the team. 
"I see those guys a lot. They're excited, and I'm ex­cited for them. We still talk about the team a lot. I played with some of them for two years, and basketball was fun." 
Connor averaged four points a game and started five of his 27 games as a junior, and he scored six points per contest as a sophomore. He lettered in basketball each of his three years with the team, but in 1988, it was time for a change of scenery. 
"No one could have an­ticipated the season the foot­ball team was going to have,'' he says. "Being undefeated makes my decision that much better to me." 

has scored in double figures in all four games which he has played. 
PORTLAND: The Irish head for the Chiles Center on Jan. 9 to play their third game in a week, meeting a Pilots team that has had its share of prob­lems recently. 
Following a 6-22 1987-88 season in the West Coast Ath­letic Conference, Portland has lost its first five games this year. 
Portland's woes can be par­tially attributed to its early­season schedule. The Pilots' first five games have included four matchups with Pac-10 Conference schools--Oregon State, Southern California, Oregon and Washington State. 
UCLA: When Notre Dame heads to Pauley Pavilion on Jan. 14 for its annual meeting with UCLA, the Irish will face a team that has recovered quite nicely from its disappointing 1987-88 season. 
With Walt Hazzard at the helm last year, the Bruins went 16-14 and failed to earn a bid to the NCAA tournament. UCLA has jumped out to a 4-0 start this year under new coach Jim Harrick, formerly of Pepper­dine. 
The Bruins have defeated Texas Tech, Miami, Brigham Young and Boston University with none of the games being decided by less than 10 points. 
Junior Trevor Wilson, a 6-8 forward, averages 20.5 points and 10.8 rebounds per game to lead UCLA in both categories. Freshman 6-10 forward Don McLean averages 20.3 points and 9.3 rebounds per game. 
Junior Kevin Walker, another 6-10 forward, is averaging 14 points a game, while senior point guard Jerome "Pooh" Richardson averages 13.3 points a game with 38 assists on the year. 
The Notre Dame-UCLA skir­mish will be televised nation­ally by NBC at 2:30p.m. EST.

After a week off for finals, the Irish, 3-1 after Wednes­day's 70-66 win over Mar­quette, will host the Toledo Rockets at 7:30 p.m. Mon­day, Dec. 19. 
The Irish then take to the road for two games before the new year, against James Madison and Youngstown State. Jan. 3 marks the return of the Irish to the Joyce ACC, to host the In­diana Hoosiers at 7:30 p.m. 
The Hoosiers hold a 2-1 se­ries advantage over the Irish, who lost to Indiana 62­59last season. The Hoosiers are led by 5-7 senior guard Ann Mooney, who averaged 
8.1 points per game last season, and 5-11 forward Pam Fritz, who averaged eight points and four rebounds per contest in the 1987-8 season. 
After a game against Van­derbilt in Nashville, the Irish will host perennial wo­men's basketball power Old Dominion, which has fallen on hard times this season but is nonetheless one of the top programs in the country. 
Midwest Collegiate Con­ference play begins for the Irish on Thursday, Jan. 12 at Evansville, followed by an­other road contest at St. Louis on Saturday, Jan. 14. 
Wrestlers bound for Florida 
By GREG SCHECKENBACH Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame wrestling team will be looking for a few presents this Christmas vaca­tion. Mainly, in the form of vic­tories on the mat. 
It will compete in five matches over break, four of those on the road. At the end of December, the wrestlers will escape winter and travel to Tampa, Fla. for the Sunshine Open. This is the first appear­ance for the Irish in the Open, which was won by Edinboro State last year. Over 40 teams will be present including many of the top Eastern power­houses. 
Once again, the Irish will be led by a trio of seniors: Pat Boyd, Jerry Durso, and Chris Geneser. Geneser and Durso are both looking for their third straight invitation to the NCAA tournament. Last weekend in Las Vegas Invitational, Boyd won fourth place, Durso fifth, and Geneser seventh. 
Head Coach Fran McCann is expecting the Irish to do well over break, especially in the dual meets. The Sunshine Open is the highlight of the break. 
"This (Sunshine Open) is a comparable tournament to Las Vegas in terms of the number of teams, but it will be a little different field," said McCann. "We will get to compete against a number of schools we haven't seen yet, and it is im­portant for our guys to see what's out there in terms of tal­ent before they get to nation­als." 
Mter the start of the new year the Irish hope to continue their winning ways in dual meets as they take on Purdue, Adams State, Ohio, and Ohio State. The only home match is against Adams State from Colorado on Jan. 9. They will be looking to revenge a loss to Adams State last year and up­hold their undefeated streak in dual matches. 
Wrestling for the Irish will be the usual · starters of Andy Radenbaugh at 118 pounds, Marcus Gowens at 126, Durso, Boyd, Todd LaYton at 150, Mark Gerardi at 158, Todd Tomazic at 167, Geneser, Curt Engler at 190, and heavyweight Chuck "Dream" Weaver. Layton, Gerardi, and Raden­baugh all competed in the NCAA tournament last year. 
Christmas in Florida should be beneficial for the Irish as they begin their drive to the NCAAs. The dual meets along with the tournaments should give Notre Dame added expe­rience which in turn could lead to a high finish in the NCAAs. 
Gifts 
continued from page 24 
To hockey coach Ric Schafer: A win. Any win. Soon. 
The 3-13-2 Irish hockey team has not won a game in its last 11 contests, spanning more than a month of the season. Notre Dame is not giving itself any presents by scheduling na­tional powers, but needs to stop giving gifts of the two-game­sweep variety to teams like Lake Forest. 
To women's basketball coach 
Muffet McGraw: A tuffet, 
some curds and whey-­
whatever those are. 
Actually, McGraw and the 
Irish are asking for their first 
NCAA tournament appearance 
for Christmas. 
To the thousands of students 
who did not buy basketball tick­
ets: A box of Kleenex--the kind 
with the lotion in it. 
Many of you may need it 
during the days of January and 
February, when the Irish are 
running and dunking against some of the best teams in the nation. Of course, there are so many other, more exciting so­cial alternatives at Notre Dame during that time of the year. 
To Miami and USC: Whatever Kleenex is left over, and make Miami's the kind without the lotion in it. 
To Digger Phelps: Silence. He doesn't want anyone to wake up his basketball team. 
The seniorless Irish entered the season with a question mark and enter Christmas break with an unblemished mark, as in 3-0. Ellis and the highly-regarded freshmen are running the ball, point guard Tim Singleton is running the show and the men in the paint are running up the rebounding margin--a trademark of Phelps-coached teams. 
Back-up present to Phelps: a future schedule that includes games in Texas, where his son­in-law, Jamie Moyer, soon will be pitching for the Rangers be­cause the Cubs traded him ear­lier this week. 

To the Chicago Cubs: A clue. They very seldom have one when it comes to trades. 
To the Notre Dame ticket of­fice: Better luck next year. This year was not exactly a smooth one: freshmen were scattered all over Notre Dame Stadium because of a shortage, and student basketball sales were low, in part because ap­plications were not mailed in­dividually this year. 
The Fiesta Bowl deal was great in that every Notre Dame student who wanted a ticket could purchase one. But the "proof beyond a shadow of a doubt" clause regarding iden­tification in Tempe should have been announced before many students tried to purchase them for their friends. 
To Lou Holtz: The same pres­ent that we're all asking from Santa. 
And to all of you who have made it this far in this column: Merry Christmas. May your New Year be blessed with the national championship we've all been awaiting.

who leads the team with 418 kills and 147 total blocks. 
And Illinois dominated net play in the first round of the tournament against Illinois State, as four players hit better than .500 for the match, with sophomore middle blocker Laura Bush recording an amazing .833 hitting percentage on 10 kills. 
Illinois activates its powerful attack with the skillful hands of sophomore setter Barb Win­sett, who has already regis­tered 1434 assists and picked up 221 digs. 
But Irish head coach Art Lambert tries to keep things in perspective. 
"I try not to worry about what Illinois is going to do," said Lambert. ''I just want the girls to go out and do what they've been doing all year. We stuck with our game plan all year and I think we've been successful." 
The Irish game plan will cen­ter around the powerful armswing of senior middle blocker Mary Kay Waller who has been a force for the team all year, recording 426 kills and 199 kills as well as 43 service aces. 
Senior Zanette Bennett adds another dimension to the Irish offense as her mixture of thun­derous spikes and soft shots-­totalling 377 kills for the season--and 147 total blocks have made her intimidating at the net. 
And senior Maureen Shea has been the personification of consistency for Notre Dame this season, contributing 285 kills for a .282 hitting percentage while also adding 84 total blocks and 210 digs. 
Freshman setter Julie Brem­ner has been all over the floor for the Irish, leading the team in assists (1284) and digs (312), while recording 117 total blocks and 25 service aces. 
But perhaps the most intan­gible factor for the team is the impact of players such as junior Kathy Cunningham and sophomore Tracey Shelton who have been able to come off the bench in pressure situations and provide a catalyst for the Irish. 
Notre Dame has not faced Il­linois since 1984, when it fell in three games, 15-4, 15-4 and 15-3 to the Illini in the Illinois Tourn­ament, but that was Lambert's inaugural season and this year the Irish have fared better against Big Ten teams, record­ing a 5-3 record after beating Iowa, Ohio State, Michigan and Northwestern twice. 
"I feel like we have as good a chance as they do of win­ning," said Lambert. "We have absolutely everything to win and nothing to lose, so if we go out and continue playing as we

Kalbas, Wenger, to compete 1n Milwaukee Classic

The key to winning is to stay one step ahead of your op­ponent. On Jan. 4-8, two members of the Notre Dame's men's tennis team will try to get a jump on their spring com­petition in the Milwaukee Ten­nis Classic. Brian Kalbas, No. 2 player, and Ryan Wenger, No. 5 player, are looking to prepare for the most compete­tive schedule in Irish tennis his­tory. 
"The tournament is a great tune-up," said second-year Head Coach Bob Bayliss. "It is a great to get good competition while we are not in school. It is important that Notre Dame be represented in this competition and our two guys have an op-

season. Kalbas upset Craig Wildley of Kansas, 6-2, 6-2. Wildley is ranked in top 50 in the country. 
The 128 single player field will determine if Ryan Wenger's turnaround is for real. Wenger fell on hard times early in the season but recently has raised his level of play 
"Ryan has come out of his' slump," said Bayliss. "He won two matches in the Tom Fallon Invitational, and beat a good Ohio St. player, Kevin Dibelius in the Rolex Regional Tourna­ment." 
Wenger and Kalbas, No. 3 duo, will take the court for the Irish in the 64 team double's · field. The pair has had some tough times in the fall season, 
yet this competition could turn things around for them. 
As for the other Irish players, they will play in local tourna­ments at home and try to heal their wounds. DiLucia, No. 1 player, has been suffering from shin splints for the past several weeks, but is expected to be ready for the spring season. 
Looking back at the fall season, Bayliss believes that his team is not quite where they should be. Asked what grade he would he would give his teams for the fall season, Bayliss had this to say. 
"I would give our team a low B," said Bayliss. "We weren't perfect but we are better than our record shows. With the in­jury factor, we performed ac­ceptable but not extraordi­nary."

"We will honor anyone who wishes to get a refund of their $35 for the ticket before they leave for break," continued Cunningham, "in the case that this policy will present prob­lems in Arizona. We would rather take care of any prob­lems here than have people stuck with a problem in Arizona."

Southall adjusts to switches 
Senior free safety 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Assistant Sports Editor 
When Corny Southall arrived at Notre Dame, he was not sure whether he would play tailback or defensive back when he got his chance with the Irish. 
But he already had set the major goal for his collegiate football career. 
''Any freshman with any idea of what they're getting into, they dream about it," said the senior from Rochester, N.Y., about his dream of a national title. "It's just one of those things, just the thought that, 'I'm going to Notre Dame on a full-ride scholarship. We recruit the best athletes in the country year in and year out. There's so much talent on the team that if we put it to­gether... ' 
"You do still have that belief because each year it's another chance to start over," contin­ued Southall. "You can say this is what we did last year, and this is where we can improve. Our freshman class, and I'm sure Tim Brown's freshman class, Steve Beuerlein's fresh­man class and Anthony Johnson's freshman class, yoQ just think that the talent's here and the coaching's here... " 
Southall finds himself one game away from finally ac­hieving that goal with the rest of the senior class. But before reaching this· position, the 6-2, 194-pound free safety has had to endure several personal ad­justments. 
First, after working as the third-team tailback his fresh­man year, Southall learned of his switch to the defensive backfield just before the Irish opened the year against Mic­higan his sophomore year. 
"All through spring, I was at running back, and even two weeks into fall camp I'd been at running back," said Sout­hall, who starred in both the offensive and defensive back­fields at Rush-Henrietta 
one game away from reaching goal 
Sperry High School. "The idea of going to defense wasn't even there. A few players in the sec­ondary went down a week or two before Michigan, and we needed someone capable of learning the system quickly. 
"It was more of a shock that I was switched at that time; normally you'd rather be switched in the spring because you'd know in your mind going into fall camp what you'd be doing," Southall continued. "I had a long talk with my par­ents, and they encouraged me. As it turned out, I learned the system a few weeks later, played and lettered that year." 
Things started out even bet­ter for Southall in his junior year. As a starter at free safety, he intercepted two passes in the season-opening win over Michigan and ran back an interception for a touchdown against Purdue. 
But Southall suffered a par­tially torn knee ligament in the very next game, at Pittsburgh, and he was sidelined for the next four games. 
"It was the first injury in 10 years of playing where I'd missed that many games," said Southall. 
Southall was back at full 
health as this season entered. 
The unexpected event to occur 
this season was a switch in the 
depth chart. Sophomore Pat 
Terrell, a speedster and former 
split end from St. Petersburg, 
Fla., replaced Southall as the 
starting free safety before the 
Pitt game. 

"For some guys, it would be 
difficult," said Southall. "I'm 
a senior sharing time with an 
underclassman, and some 
people probably would have a 
problem with that. I've been 
brought up to understand some 
things are more important than 
personal satisfaction. 

"I've started half the games 
and Pat's started half, but 
we've both played an equal Southall. "When I started, I'd tell him a few certain things that the other team was doing that we hadn't gone over in practice or that they had changed. When he started, the roles were reversed." 
Notre Dame's No. 1 ranking shows that all the changes en­dured by Southall have proven beneficial. He even got a taste of what might have been during the Southern Cal game, as he ran with the ball during Notre Dame's final play from scrim­mage in the 27-10 victory. 
"On defense, you get to hit the guy as hard as you want, and it's legal--you can get your frustrations out," said Sout-· hall. "As a running back, you take a beating. At practice, I don't take a pounding because I'm delivering the blow. At run­ning back, you're being hit about every third play, and it takes its toll. 
"During the Southern Cal game, I felt fine, but when I ran the last play at running back, I forgot how much the running back takes," contin­ued Southall. "It was a sweep, and I cut against the grain and was hit by about four people. I totally forgot what it's like to be tackled instead of delivering the blow."

Irish thank students 
To the Notre Dame student body: 
Usually when you're playing in a big basketball game, you're totally concentrating on the game itself. It's not very often that a distraction snaps you out of that and you notice something besides the game itself. Tuesday night after Indiana had cut our lead down to just two points midway through the second half, we came out of the huddle after a time-out and we couldn't help but hear how loud the students were. 
We came out on the court, heard our fans and said to each other that there was no way we were going to let this one slip away. Someone told us after the game that there were a lot of Indiana fans in the Joyce Center. However, our loyal fans must have been doing a pretty good job because we never heard the Hoosier fans. 
We're pretty proud of starting 3-0 and we're even prouder to have fans like ours backing us. We're going to do every­thing possible to make sure the football team isn't Notre Dame's only undefeated team on Jan. 3. 
Our theme this year is "Hang Loose." From the Notre Dame basketball team, Merry Christmas and "Hang Loose" during the holidays. Be sure to come over Saturday afternoon and let out all of those pre-exam frustrations when we play Creighton at 1 p.m. 
Again, thanks for your support this year. There can't be a better home court anywhere than at Notre Dame.

ND has three All-Americans 
Heck, Stams, Stonebreaker all are named to first team 
Associated Press 

When Notre Dame takes a perfect 11-0 record into the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 2, it will also take three Associated Press All-Americans. 
In the results of the voting announced Thursday, top­ranked Notre Dame placed three players on the All­America team--offensive tackle Andy Heck, defensive end Frank Starns and linebacker Mike Stonebreaker. 
Heck's honor is quite an ac­complishment for the senior co­capitan, who played tight end for the Irish until this season. Starns, also a senior, has ac­cumulated 51 total tackles, 32 unassisted, and has seven quarterback sacks. Stonebreaker, a junior, has 71 unassisted tacles and a total of 104 for the season. 
Notre Dame players receiv­ing honorable mention in­cluded tailback Mark Green, quarterback Tony Rice and guard Tim Ryan on offense and cornerback Todd Lyght, linebacker Wes Pritchett, cor­nerback Stan Smagala, free safety Pat Terrell and nose guard Chris Zorich on defense. 
Deion Sanders, Florida State's magnificent corner­back, was also named to the AP All-American college foot­ball team Thursday for the second year in a row, along with Reisman Trophy winner Barry Sanders of Oklahoma State. They are related only by talent. 
Despite missing two games in October, Deion Sanders in­tercepted five passes and returned two for touchdowns. He also led the nation in punt returns with a 15.24-yard average--33 returns for 503 yards and a touchdown. 
Barry Sanders' numbers were even more amazing. The 5-foot-8, 197-pound junior tail­back capped his record­smashing season with his top effort--332 yards against Texas Tech. It was his fourth 300-yard game of the season--no one else has ever had more than one in a cereer--and gave him 2,628 for the season, easily erasing the mark of 2,342 by Southern

'Tis the season for Christmas gifts 
So far, the Christmas season has been nothing but jolly for the Notre Dame athletic department. 
Santa gave the Irish soccer and volleyball teams their first-ever invitations to the NCAA tournament for being good this fall, and replaced the carnation he left in Digger Phelps' stocking 18 years ago with a 6-foot, 9­inch future superstar and a style of basketball that fans love to watch. 
And the gift that Santa gave Notre Dame football fans three years ago is now only one victory away from giving this school a present it has not been able to unwrap for 11 years.

So in the spirit of the holidays (not to mention the fact that giving Christmas gifts in a newspaper column does not cost anything), here are a few more presents for those athletes and coaches who seem to have every­thing: 
To volleyball coach Art Lambert: A flawless perfor­mance tonight at Illinois and three more outings before Christmas. 
Lambert's squad will almost certainly need the former against the fourth-ranked Illini in tonight's Sweet Sixteen game to earn the latter--and a shot at the national title.

The All-America team also includes defensive tackle Tracy Rocker of Auburn-­winner of both the Outland Trophy as the nation's best in­terior lineman and the Lom­bardi Award as the country's top lineman--and Derrick Thomas of Alabama, who won the Butkus Award as the top linebacker. 
Sanders is joined in the back­field by two other underclassmen--junior quar­terback Steve Walsh of Miami and Texas A&M sophomore running back Darren Lewis, both of whom shattered records this season. 
The wide receivers are two more record-breakers--Jason Phillips of Houston and Hart Lee Dykes, Sanders' Oklahoma State teammate. 
Oklahoma State, Nebraska and Arkansas were the only other schools, aside from Notre Dame, to be represented by more than one player.
