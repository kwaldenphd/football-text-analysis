Campus rebellions,disorders mushroom 
(UPI)-The campus rebellion mushroomed yesterday. 
Building occupations, campus lockouts, student strikes and protest demonstrations spread through dozens of colleges and universities. 
Eastern schools-including the Ivy League elite-were especially hard hit by the swelling chorus of dissent by minority but highly vocal bands of students. 
At gun frightened Cornell University, more than 1,000 students occupied a gymnasium, awaiting faculty action on demands that it nullify disciplinary action against black students. 
A group of American University students took over the school's administration building in Washington, D.C., and ousted Presid~nt George IL Williams from his office. 
City College of New York was closed down while some 1,000 students and the faculty met to settle differences over demands for 50 per cent enrollment of Negroes and Puerto Ricans. 
Eighty dissidents seized New York University's hall of languages to protest the English department's refusal to rehire a popular professor. 
Jury condemns Sirhan to death row 
LOS ANGELES (UPI)-Sirhan B. Sirhan, showing no emotion and convinced that no one could save him from the gas chamber, was 
condemned  Wednesday  to  die for  the  murder of Sen. Robert F.  
Kennedy.  
The  is  year  old  Arab  nonchalantly  chewed  gum  as  the jury  

decreed the death sentence. He told his attorneys he was not surprised and added, "even Jesus Christ could not have saved me." 
Appeals of the verdict were expected to stay indefinitely Sirhan's execution for the assassination of the presidential candidate in an Ambassador Hotel pantry last June 5. 
His attorneys immediately launched the first of what was expected to be a long series of legal maneuvers to save Sirhan's life by moving for a new trial. Superior Court Judge Herbert V. Walker set a hearing on the motion for May 14, the same date he will formally impose the death sentence on Sirhan. 
Chief defense attorney Grant B. Cooper said he would base his appeals on three things. He thought the judge did not exercise discretion in refusing to accept a guilty plea to first degree murder by Sirhan in return for a life sentence. 
He said he would also argue that the jury was not properly constituted and, thirdly, he contended Sirhan's notebooks were I"eceived in evidence over the defendant's objections.

Dear Mr. Galvin: 
I speak of the future the 
vacuumous invisibility of the 
coming times. The future has one certainty: the total acceptance by big business of the computer as a replacement for the office worl<er. Business 
has followed the times, even paced the times. Therefore, the 
speed, accuracy, and future creativity of developing computers cannot be denied by future business. 
The clerk, the bureaucratic non­entity of business, will be replaced by the complexity, yet practical simplicity of the computer. A computer gathers and analyzes information faster and more accurately than man. The memory loci< of any computer offers the most logical answer to any given problem and theoretically possesses an unlimited memory. And ifscience can duplicate in the machine the DNA code of the human, the creative thoughts of the human could be synthesized in the machine. 
The computer's primary code could essentially simulate man's life controlling function regulated by the mysterious DNA amino acids code. When research, as at the University of Chicago, refines its DNA investigation and applies it to cybernetics, the machine could achieve the creative function it now lacks. Thus, it is conceivable the machine could invent an item or develop a thought well beyond man's creative limits. 
The final determining force unfortunately is man's selective programming into the machine. Will man thus fear the power of the machine? Will computers be developed to their fullest potential, and allowed to function? More important, will business accept the apparent philosophical implications of a machine having better talents than man? 
Yours sincerely,

the individual. 

As to business' acceptance of the apparent philosophical implica­tions of a machine being better talented than man, let's expand your question to include society as a whole. Your suggested potential of the machine's inventiveness, after all, would not only affect the structure of business and its practices but the role of the individual in every institution of the com­munity education. government, the professions, in fact. man's day to day living environment. Already many of these changes have been manifest. 
Think of the brigades of bookkeepers trapped through the years into peering from under their green eyeshades at mounting columns of figures. With perfection of the adding machine and comptometer, their working world assumed a whole new dimension. No more scratching out monthly statements with a steel-tipped pen. Instead, many have assumed functionally more interesting responsibilities by applying the skills, and wider knowledge, needed to use these tools. As a result, the individual gained more capabilities, and industry, more capacity. 
The computer has broadened the horizon much further. With its characteristic abilities for sensing, feedback, and self-adjustment-the determination of changing requirements without human intervention masses of data can be digested and analyzed, and complex calculations made, to meet the needs for which it is programmed. 
Its applications already have had a profound effect on almost every phase of our daily lives. Look, for example, at its employment in teaching: programmed lesson plans in a dozen subjects that permit student responses, and instant correction of errors, which enable uninterrupted progress to the extent of each individual's capacity. And the day is not far off when many university libraries will be linked together in a vast information retrieval system.

Its uses in long-range economic policy planning by government and business are infinite. A projection of population growth concentrations five years ahead, or twenty, will make possible realistic plans for food requirements, or housing starts, or highway construction programs, or the thousands upon thousands of goods and services requisite for further up-grading our living standards. 
And what about the computerized services touching all of us that already are taken for granted: programming traffic lights to cope with rush-hour congestion ... reconciliation of monthly bank statements ... processing individual income tax returns ... even notifications from insurance companies when premiums are due. 

All of this is part of the increasingly fast-paced tempo of our times. Man now demands "more", and he demands it "faster." This poses requirements best met by wider usages of computers, and in turn prompts the need for computers with increasingly sophisticated characteristics to keep pace. 
The point is that the philosophic 
implications arising from the 
economic and social 
consequences of computer 
complexes already has been 
accepted by society. 
Paradoxically. as computerized functions broaden. job losses don't necessarily follow. To the contrary, new fields of employment open, and people directly affected acquire new skills and abilities which improve their earning capacities-to the extent that each utilizes the opportunities proffered. Isn't this a capsulated instance of the force-drive for progress, and man's growth? 
No one really knows to what exotic limits computers can be developed. The day may well come when "creative thought" is a characteristic. But I am confident that during the intermediate evolutionary steps, man's own intellectual sophistication will continue to outpace the machine. and assure control over a product of his own making. Certainly there's no real cause for worry, however, until the machine learns how to plug itself in.

Steinberg: 'Racism is ,~,~h~n~,!~,~~ 
David Steinberg, an NSA member in the field of racism, added a new emphasis and greater depth to the problem of racism in America as he ad­dressed an attentive audience last night in Moreau Hall. 
Starting with the assertion that "racism is as American as apple pie" he formed a directive of analyzation stating that the real question is not whether one particular person is or is not a racist but the broader aspect of the "serious values and language of our culture and society that have become innundated by ra­cism." 
He felt the present analyza­tion of the condition of Ameri­cans infested with racism was

That minute may have been spent as Paulists do, counsel­ing a questioning youth at a secular university, working in ghettos, saving a potential "dropout" or promoting bet­ter understanding of the Church and all religions.

analogous to the mental patient who by himself never realizes or accepts his true condition and only attempts half-hearted or ineffectual cures but who needs someone else to diagnose his case and prescribe the correct treatment. 
Stating that the "bulk of ra­cism is in institutional form", he indicted the educational institu­tion as being a practitioner of racism. 
Warning that "racism is one of the major issues facing society today" and that if present trends continue our society will "crum­ble either into chaos or facism," he added ominously that "there are no magic pressure points to change." 
His prescribed treatment of "redesigning the curriculum 
away from an educational sys­tem based on the white middle class to an educational "environ­ment where black people arc appropriate." 
He considered the addition of more black students, black teachers, and black courses as being important but as a dan­gerous stopping point which too often masked society as the real cancer of racism and which be­came "steps backwards instead of forwards." 
Steinberg felt that if Notre Dame wanted to make a true commitment to the eradication of' racism an appropriate re­sponse would be 2% of all her resources dedicated to nothing but the elimination of racism. "This would be a whale of a lot of resources."

Tom Ehrbar 

The War Watchers 

.........,......................... 
I received a letter from my good friend (and protege) Charley, 
yesterday. Besides 116 St. Joseph Bank statements issued on no 
account of my own, a rejection slip from Mad Magazine which read 
"What do you think we are-mad?", and several viciously sarcastic 
"Tell it t~ Tommy's", it was the first piece of personal mail plopped 
into my mail-box since Christmas. 
So 1 was particularly pleased that good ol' Charley had dropped 
me a line. All my other correspondents have simply dropped me. 
Charley, believe it or not, is a brilliant student, as shrewd as they 
come. And while he'll be graduating foam high school this June with 
an outstanding record, he just doesn't know where to turn. You see, 
Charley wants to go to college; he also wants to become a military 
officer s0meday. And the two don't really seem to go hand-in-hand 
in toda y's world of the enlightened liberal. It is a bit of a problem; I 
certainly don't know of any solution. , 
Just the other night 1 was watching CBS News (which has smothered its share of Tom, Dick, and radical Hairy's.) The show was some kind of a 3 hour "special" describing the patterned anihilation of ROTC units on campuses across the nation. I sat there, my eyes glued to the tube ... 
HOSTILITIES AT HARVARD-Students here continue to surround 
the Administration Building after eight days of intense conflict. An 
occasional shout of "end the killing, end ROTC" breaks the eerie 
pause of silence between the bursts of motor shell lobbed up from 
the rear. The shells have exploded sporadically throughout the night, 
and the Boston sky burns a bright shade of orange and red. 
One particularly bold student, in a fit of pacifistic frenzy, flipped one grenade after another at the ROTC Building, until a helmeted policeman escorted him from the scene. 
Both sides are now holding firm, and rumors of escalation have 
taken an air of credibility. One administration spokesman said 
"There is no relief in sight. We're in this mess now, and we can't just 
pull out. We have the Harvard reputation to think of." 
COLLISION AT COLUMBIA A unique plan to crumble the ROTC Military-Industrial complex has arisen from an SDS general meeting here at Columbia. The students hope to establish an Anti-ROTC unit on every American college campus. Hopefully these units will be fully accredited, thus endowed with a certain weight of respectability. One SDS leader said "This is as much a war as that crap over in Vietnam." 

A buddy of his mentioned the high level of organization anticipated to keep an operation as massive as Anti-ROTC rolling smoothly. Reluctantly he admitted, "To assure some sort of flexibility, we will probably assort ourselves into various patrols, squadrons, companies, etc. Of course, a little discipline will also be helpful, but proven leaders should immediately come to the fore. We'll set up a rigorous training program drills in lying-down and throw-and-run harassment tactics discussed in the classroom. Also, so that Anti-ROTC people can be universally recognized, we'll probably issue standard uniforms, perhaps in Navy-blue. A flag and motto aren't a bad idea either." 
CONFLICT AT CHICAGO Here in the middlewest war zone the fighting carries on, with casualties steadily mounting on both sides. While a bombing halt and cease-fire arc anticipated over the summer vacation when college students return to their homes and loved ones: the real war, the war of fear and mistrust, has no end in sight. The radicals continue to cling to a belief, which some consider naive, that unless ROTC is contained on the campus, it will diffuse into the mainstream of American life. "We must stop ROTC now", one bearded and sandeled spokesman said, "otherwise the whole country will fall like a stack of dominoes. Furthermore, and I find this preposterous in a land of democracy, why hasn't congress declared an official war. We have touched off as much violence as anyone." 
BACKFIRE AT BERKELY-There isn't much left of this once 
beautiful campus anymore. Where gardens and trees once blossomed 
in dazzling array, now there is only scattered debris and smoldering 
fires. Berkely, as we once knew and loved her, is no more. One 
elderly gentleman stro I ling through the waste, muttered through 
clenched teeth, "War is Hell." That sums it up precisely. 
SEMANTICS AT SAN FRANCISCO Peace talks go on and on and 
on here in this old gracious city. The moan of guns, and the buzz of 
planes are heard far in the distance, as the war enters its third month 
out at sea. 
Neither delegation, those of ROTC or of the SDS, is yet willing to 
admit to a compromise, neither will yield its demands. There is only 
the tinkling of cocktail glasses and the chatter of empty rhetoric. 
The UN is waiting if called for mediation. And the government of 
South Vietnam may be invited to assist in an "advisory capacity." 
One final note a peace movement is now beginning to emerge from 
the Pentagon. 
And so the war goes un . .. stay tuned to CBS News for further deJelopments where1er and whenever they happen. 
Now, the World of' Sports takes you to Notre Dame, Indiana 
where the Fighting Irish are colcluding another session of spring 
football practice ... 
What can I tell Charley?
