WASHINGTON -The House Ap­propriations Committee voted yes­terday to cut offfunds for U.S. forces in Lebanon unless President Reagan agrees to invoke the War Powers Act acknowledging a congressional role in deciding how long 1,200 U.S. Marines should remain in Beirut. 
The 20-16 party line vote marks a repudiation of a compromise War Powers resolution agreed to by Reagan and most congressional leaders, including Democratic House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill. 
"If we don't stand up to our con­stitutional responsibility to declare war, we don't deserve to be elected," said Rep. Clarence Long, D-Md., chairman of the committee's foreign operations subcommittee and author ofthe proposal. 
Long's amendment was attached to a stopgap spending bill which must be approved by Oct. 1 to keep most federal government agencies operating. 
Under the amendment, unless Reagan submits a report to Congress formally invoking the act and ack­nowledging that the House and Senate could call the troops home. the funds for U.S. forces in and around Lebanon would be cut off November I.

House committee to Reagan: Invoke War Powers Act 
Associated Press 
A huge dome of Canadian air locked the middle ofthe nation in an icebox yesterday, putting the lid on a wretched summer. Never had it been so cold ~o early in the season in many places. 
The mercury dropped to record subfreezing lows in at least 3H cities from Idaho to Illinois and Montana to Texas. It was the coldest Septem­ber morning on the books in parts of Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas and Arkansas. 

On the next to last day ofsummer, it was a sweaty 84 by mid-afternoon in Roston, but temperatures in the single digits. teens and 20s were reported during the morning from the Rockies to the Plains. including an unofficial 8 degrees at the Agate Fossil Reds National Monument, 35 miles north ofScottsbluff, Neb. 
"We've sold three or four times more coats here than normal this time of year," said Fred Caventer, manager ofa}.C. Penney store in the Nebraska panhandle town of Al­liance, where it was 14 degrees. 
But the cold in the Alliance area also damaged potato crops which were destined for potato chip fac­tories from Denver to Lincoln, Ncb. 
"The biggest problem we're having is the potatoes arc freezing in the ground," said Frank Whatzal, ex­tension agent of Box Butte County. "Some growers were only half through their digging."

'Temporary' housing home for 19 
By CINDY BOYLE 
StaffReporter 
Nineteen students who are still living in temporary housing at Saint Mary's will remain where they are for the remainder of the semester. Keys have been made for the stu­dents so that the rooms can be locked, and phones will be installed very soon, according to Director of Residence Life Pat Rissmeyer. 
The students who are living in temporary housing. expected to be placed in permanent rooms. "They said they'd find us something," said Marybeth McLaughlin, a freshman living in the Holy Cross parlor. "I like it, but I'm looking forward to moving into a permanent room." 
"For a while, they told us we'd on­ly be here a week, but then they told us to plan on staying the whole semester," said Erin Kirk, another freshman living in Holy Cross parlor. 
"I didn't expect temporary 
housing," said Pomi Smith, a fresh­
man living in the McCandless 
lounge. "In my case, the college 
didn't know 1was coming here until the day before because of a com­puter error. I think all of the other girls were accepted late." 

Nine freshmen are living in the lounge in the basement of McCand­less Hall, and four are living in one of the two Holy Cross Hall parlors. Six transfer students have moved into two former study rooms in the base­ment of Holy Cross. 
The two guest rooms in LeMans Hall were used as temporary housing for four students who have since moved to permanent rooms. The rooms were made available in case the incoming students did not "show up or dropped out," accord­ing to Rissmeyer. 
The six students who are now living in the basement of Holy Cross had been off campus. These stu­dents, along with two other students who have recently been placed in permanent housing, were living off campus in the home ofa Saint Mary's professor. 
"Our first responsibility is to the students," said Rissmeyer. "We would rather have them on campus in temporary housing than off campus." 
"We are very happy with the situa­tion because the girls are happy," said Rissmeyer. "Our first priority is to the students, and they like living together." 
"The rooms are really nice," added Rissmeyer. "We may even make the McCandless lounge per­manent living space for upperclas­smen." 
Since the students have been forced to adjust to the housing situa­tion, it will be difficult for them to move at the end ofthe semester. 
"I like it a lot, but we know we have to move," said Kirk. 
"I love it, it's great," said Smith. "We've gotten so used to it. It will be hard to move because we won't move together." 
Saint Mary's Residence Life hopes to prevent this housing shortage next year and in future years. 
"We are in the process oftrying to locate more permanent space, or nicer temporary space," said Ris­smeyer. "We are planning for an in­creased number of students next year." 
which Long opposes would allow the Marines to remain another 18 months, but would be initiated by Congress, not by the president as spelled out in the Vietnam-era War Power Act. 
Reagan has also said he has con­stitutional objections to the War Powers Act, even though he has agreed to sign the compromise worked out after careful negotia­tions with senior White House aides. 
In the Senate on Tuesday, Secretary ofState George Shultz said that although Reagan will sign the compromise resolution, the presi­dent does not intend to share responsibility on the deployment of 
U.S. military forces overseas. 
In testimony before the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations Committees, Shultz said repeatedly that Reagan had serious constitutional objections to the War Powers Act underwhich the resolu­tion was drafted. 
With or without the war powers resolution allowing 1,200 Marines to remain in Lebanon for 18 months, Shultz said the United States has no intention of widening its military role in Lebanon, 
"There is no plan to change the mission we have in Lebanon. Ifsuch a plan would emerge, we would con­sult with Congress about it," Shultz said. 
At the same time, Shultz refused to say if Reagan would seek further congressional approval if the Marines are still in Lebanon after the 18 months spelled out in the com­promise war powers resolution worked out between Reagan and congressional leaders. 
"I don't think the president will have to make a flat statement on what he's going to do about the deployment ofU.S. forces 18 months from now," the secretary said. . In ali-day testimony, Shultz met heavy criticism on the 18-month limit from House members and senators who said they are reluctant to give Reagan a "blankcheck" for so long a time in a volatile combat situation. 
The resolution is to be voted on in the House committee today and in the Senate panel tomorrow, with final congressional action next week. 
Meanwhile, Reagan hailed the war powers compromise as "a welcome step forward in our pursuit of 
peace."

Miami game to be shown at SMC Five Hall Dance 
ByEDWARD NOLAN 
News Staff 

Alarge-screen television will be set up on the third floor lounge of the Haggar Center to allow those attending the Five Hall Dance to see the Notre Dame/Miami game Saturday night. 
The Saint Mary's Programming Committee which met yesterday decided to install the TV screen at the dance which will take place Saturday from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. in the second-floor Ballroom of the center. The dance is free to all Notre Dame men and women. 
The committee also discussed the United Way campaign. Each hall and class will sponsor a project to raise money for the United Way Fund. No decision was made on how Saint Mary's students will help meet the SI6,854 Notre Dame/Saint Mary's student-faculty goal. The committee stated the new rules concerning sign-posting on campus. All publicity notices on campus must first be approved by resident assistants of the dorms. Hall directors or resident assis­tants must receive all posters at least four days before they are hung. After the posters are stamped with a seal the RA's will then post the publicity materials throughout the dorms. 
Shuttle schedules listing the new routes will be released within 
the next few days. The new routes will remain effective throughout 
the year, despite the fact that the committee noted the new stop on 
Douglas Road is not used enough to warrant the hourly trip. 
The shuttle now stops on every run at the University Village Apart­
ments, lengthening the riding time between campuses.

Best of the Mediocre 
Notre Dame may be the best Catholic university in the United States, but that's not saying much. At least, that's what 6,000 scholars said in a report on academic quality at American universities released by the Con­ference Board of Associated Research Councils. According to the report, Catholic universities trail their public and private counterparts -systematic scores place every Catholic university, including Notre Dame, in the bottom halfofAmerican universities. 
While Notre Dame administrators call the report in­complete and inconsequential, one Catholic sociologist, Father Andrew Greeley, has gone so far as to say that Catholic intellectualism will die unless Catholic universities get off their butts and develop "respect for learning." 
In this week's edition ofNational Catholtc Reporter, Greeley puts together one of the most fascinating and in-depth accounts of the demise of Catholic scholar­ship, a demise which Catholic historian Tracy Ellis (best

Anti-government protests explode into bloody street riots in Manila 
Associated Press 
MANILA, Philippines The 
bloodiest anti-government rioting in 
President Ferdinand E. Marcos' 18· 
year rule rocked Manila yesterday, 
leaving at least seven people dead 
and· 150 injured by official count. 
The violence exploded after a pean·ful demonstration by about '500,000 Filipinos in front of Manila's central post office exactly one month after the assassination of Marcos' chiefpolitical rival, Benigno Aquino. 
Street fires and rallies continued 
late into the night in both poor and 
we<~lthy Manila neighborhoods, hut 
the worst violence was on Mendiola 
Bridge leading to Marcos' palatial 
residence. 
Nearly I,000 youths shouting "'Ninoy, Ninoy," Aquino's nickname, thrt·w stone.~ and charged police lines, st·t afire two buse:-; and a dredg­ing crane and threw homemade bombs into police ranks.

other students off streets in the uni­
versity district, about a half-mile 
from the palace. 

The dead included two firemen, a 
marine corporal and four civilians, 
the government said. It said at least 
50 riot troops were injured, includ­
ing a brigadier general hit by shrap­
nel from a bomb. 

Injured civilians, including five 
reporters covering the riots, suf­
fered cuts and bruises and wounds 
from shrapnel or bullets. 

Rioters in a neighboring district 
looted and burned a government 
food store where goods arc sold at . disco,Mnted prices. 
Marcos went on national televi­
sion during the rally to say he was 
more saddened than angered by op­
position criticism. His palace later 
issued an appeal for <.·aim and 
promi.~cd continued dialogue and 
"maximum tolerance" in dealing 
with dt·monstrators. 

Mendiola Bridge was the site of a 
1970 student riot in which four 
youths were killed. A popular 
protest song in Tagalog, the Philippine language, calls Mendiola "the road where you can find our freedom." 
At the height ofthe rioting, youths posted a sign reading "Ninoy, you are not alone. We are with you." It was signed UNIDO, for the United Nationalist Democratic Organiza­tion, which organized the Manila ral­ly and others throughout the country. 
The opposition called it a "Day of National Sorrow," but for Marcos it was officially "Thanksgiving Day," the 11th anniversary of his declara­tion of martial law which lasted eight years. Schools had been dis­missed for the observance. 
In the modern suburb of Makati, Manila's business hub, thousands of office workers poured into the streets for the third time in a week to join the call for Marcos' re:-;ignation. 
Others hung "Ninoy" banners from high-rise windows and dumped confetti into the district's wide boulevards as hundreds ofcars flew yellow ribbons and honked dis­approval ofthe government.

"I think there is reasonable grounds to advise parents that if it's possible they ought to minimize the extent to which they expose their children w cigarette smoke," said Dr. Ira B. Tager, who directed the study. 
Although the researchers are con· vinced there is a link between mot· hers' smoking and slow lung growth, they are not positive whether breathing smoke-filled air at home is responsible. They said the damage may occur when women smoke during pregnancy. 
. During five years of study, the lungs of noh-smoking children :whose rrlothtfrs smoked grew at 93 _,~rcent i:'ll~ rale'ofthose whose mot­.rs did; nt>t ~hlokc. Children who ~ ~oked we"t{! studied separately. Their lung development also was 
slower when their mothers smoked too. 
"These data suggest that maternal smoking contributes to a reduction in the rate of development of lung function in children and, along with the child's own smoking habits, may be important in the development of chronic obstructive disease of the airways in adult life," the resear­chers wrote. 
The most common varieties of chronic obstructive lun~ disease are chronic bronchitis and emphysema. These diseases cause more than 50,000 deaths each year in the United States. 
The latest study was based on l, 156 children between the a~es of 5 and 9 who lived in East Boston. It was conducted by doctors from Brigham and Women's Hospital, Beth Israel Hospital and Harvard Medical School and was published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. 
Once a year, the children took tests that measured the volume of their lun~s. The exams re~istered the amount of air that they could blow out of their lungs in one second. 
The doctors found that smokin~ by the children's fathers had no ef· feet on their lung development. This may have simply meant that they spent less time with their fathers than with their mothers. Or it could mean that their lungs were retarded by smoke exposure while they were still in their mothers' wombs. 
Tager noted that about 20 percent of adults who smoke heavily get disabling lung diseases, while the rest do not.

Sandinista rebel priest dies in border skirmish 
Associated Press 
ST. LOUIS -The Rev. James F. Carney, who the Honduran military says died ofexhaustion while fleeing government troops, had gone to Central America three years ago to serve as chaplain to guerrillas, his sister said yesterday. 
Carney, a 58-year-old Roman Catholic priest, "had a deep love of the people and he wanted to minis­ter to them," said Eileen Connolly of suburban Clayton. "He's a very ten­der per~on, but he can't stand in­justice." 
Carney. who told friends he expected to be killed and didn't want his story to die with him, left behind unpublished memoirs, his brother-in-law said. 
The document "describes the situation in Central America as seen by a dedicated priest that has worked with the very, very poor over the past 20 years," said Car­ney's brother-in-law, joe Connolly. 
"But it also has an issue of con­
science on what it means to be a 
priest working in an oppressed 
country in which the human rights

In Honduras, Col. Cesar Elvir Sier­ra said Carney died of exhaustion caused by a lack offood while trying to escape with a rebel force during a government sweep of a moun­tainous area near the Nicaraguan border. His body had not been recovered. 
It was unclear when Carney died. and Sierra would only say that a rebel leader was killed Sunday during the government drive. 
The Rev. Jose Maria Tojeira, the Jesuit superior for Honduras, said he doubted the government's account. Carney, trained as a jesuit, recently resigned from the order but remained a priest, said a jesuit spokesman. 
"He lived with the poor, treated 
them with respect and tried to help 
them regain their land," Mrs. Con­
nolly said of her brother. "He's·a 
hero among the peasants of Hon­
duras. And ifit is true that he is dead, 
he could become a martyr."

SALISBURY, N.C. -A powerful explosion followed by three smaller blasts rocked a chemical plant yes­terday, setting fire to a factory build­ing and forcing the evacuation of a surrounding five-block area Four people were injured. 
Firefighters searched the burning building and found no bodies, said Rowan County Fire Marshal Robert Gunn. Company officials initially told police that five people were killed, said Ann Cole, records super­visor for the Salisbury Police Depart­ment. 
Henry Barry, a spokesman for National Starch and Chemical Co., owner of the plant through its Proc­tor Chemical division, said it was "unlikely" that any of the 60 employees was missing after the 
11:15 a.m. explosion, which was followed by three smaller blasts and a fire.

Good reasons to worry about computers 
!.ike it or not, computers are her e to stay. With their floppy disks, silicon chips, and cathode ray tuhes, they have become as American as hascball, hot dogs, apple pie, and Toyotas. 
Keith Picher 
Weekend philosopher 
Though the automata are more popular than cvt.>r, many people still sull"er from com· puterphobia. They sec the device as a deus ex machina rather than a machina ex deo. 
Perhap~ a short ca~c history would il· lustrate the point. All of The Observer's clas· sified ad~ must be entered into our computer by the person placing the ad. 
One young woman squeamishly sat down in front of the Hazeltine 1420 terminal the other day with a look of horror on her face. 
Though the instructions for entering ads are clearly displayed on the screen, she typed the information like a person defusing a bomb. Every time she pressed the return key, the screen startled her with new information. Finally she left, having sweat off a few pounds during the ordeal. 
Though many fear computers, others are overly enthusiastic about the machines. "Computer heads," as they are frequently dubbed, tend to see computers as cure-ails. 
"War Games," one of the summer's hottest box o·ffice items, praised the ingenuity ofsuch computer hackers. Though a bit preachy, the film addresses questions about the recreation· al and political use of computers, warning us that they are no better t11an their human programmers. 
Computers, like any form oftechnology, are not evil in themselves. They can simplify man's laborious and non-rewarding work. They can also store filedrawers ofinformation invisably. 
The advance of data storage techniques, though an aide to the professional, does raise 
serious questions about civil liberties and 
privacy. A recent article by Dorothy Samuels, 
former director of the New York Civil 
Liberties Union, looks at the implications of data storage in government institutions. The article (The New York Times, September 12) lists several instances of questionable practices. 
In New York state, drivers who lose their license for drunken driving must answer a questionaire about their sex lives to have their license reinstated. The results are stored in computer files until someone decides to delete them. 
The Internal Revenue Service recently an· nounced plans to cross-check "life style" data from various business services with their own tax records. In other words, a person who voluntarily answers a survey for research purposes could be nabbed by the IRS. 
The Federal Naturalization and Immigra· tion Service wanted access to the New York City Board of Education's file of a million stu· dents last year. If they had succeeded, they would have searched for Spanish surnames in order to track down illegal aliens. 
Information which was formerly hidden somewhere in file cabinets can be accessed now at the touch ofa button. Our records are no lon~er thrown away or lost, but are held indefinitely on magnetic disks. Anyone with enough knowledge can obtain information about other's lives without getting caught. 
Until steps are taken to improve computer 
security, and to punish unauthorized use of 
data, personal privacy will be compromised. 
Viewing such information is as much a viola· 
tion of of privacy as Peeping Tom's glance at 
Lady Godiva.

Why Notre Dame should offer Chinese 
In Det·ember l9'H, the United States for· mally t·xtendc:d diplomatic relations to the People'~ Hcpublic of China. Thus they ended an illusionary thirty year policy of not recognizing the most populous country on earth. 
Francis J. James 
Guest Columnist 
Mainland China has undergone phenomenal change-" in the short period of time since this historic decision and has pressed on with its policy ofthe '"four moder· nizations." These modernizations include change in t·ducation, the military, science, and agriculture. The ~oal is to make China a modern nation by the turn of the century. Hy gradually opening the "bamboo curtain," 
China is opening itself to and welcoming the 
influence of foreign husiness, technology, and 
ideas which will affect the country and the rest ofAsia profoundly. 
The University of Notre Dame seems ready to capitalize on this sud~en warming of rela· tions by establishing a summer language program in Tianjun, the third largest city in China. The paradox of all Notre Dame's good will and intention is that it does not offer the language on campus as a degree matriculating course. How can the University expect to en· courage students to participate in this program without even offering significant prepartory and continuing studies of the Chinese language? Will people make a sig· nificant investment of money, time, and effort to take a six week intensive course in China and then return to campus to forget it all? 
Until this year, Notre Dame had a little· 
known yet viable program in Taipei, Taiwan. Thus, a few interested students could pursue a year of study abroad, in Asia, studying the Chinese language and culture. All students returning from Foreign Study Programs can expect to continue studying their respective languages, and often end up majoring or double majoring in that language. On the other hand, students wishing to continue their studies in Chinese cannot. What are their options? What are they to do? 
Though the administration maintains that over the years there hasn't been much consis· tent interest, one need only look at the Japan program. For years it was languishing with very few students, but .,Jud4enly it has blossomed into a full scale language program due toJapan's important economic position in 
the world and our need to communicate with 
it. Similarly, with China's gradual emergence in the modern day world, its vast population, and its immense potential, the need and the interest in Chinese is here today. 
If the University wishes to make this sum· mer program a successful one, it should first start by offering Chinese here in Notre Dame, Indiana and not half way around the world. 
Can the University, and the United States for that matter, afford not to know a language spoken by one in four persons? Learn Chinese!

First move in new league 
USFL's Generals change hands 
NEW YORK (AP)-The NewJer­sey Generals are the first team in the year-old United States Football League to change hands, reportedly having been sold to Donald Trump, a New York real estate mogul whose interests include a soon-to-be opened gambling casino. 
Published and televised reports yesterday said that Oklahoma oil­man]. Walter Duncan, who owns 90 percent ofthe Generals and was one of the league's original owners, had sold the team to Trump. No pur­chase price was mentioned. 
Duncan reportedly had lost inter­est in owning a football team and had become more involved in his other business enterprises. 
Trump, 36, heads the Trump Or­ganization, which is a co-partner with Holiday Inns Inc. in the Har­rah's Boardwalk Hotel and Casino at Atlantic City, N.J., which is slated to open next sprin~. Gary Kaplan, assis­tant counsel to the USFL, said last night he would not discuss the im­plications of Trump's connection with the casino. 
The Generals made their biggest splash when they signed Heisman Trophy winner Herschel Walker to a S5 million, three-year contract, reportedly the richest deal in pro football history. The team was 
strongly  criticized  for  signing  
Walker,  who  had  one  year  of  
eligibility left.  
Generals  season  ticket  sales  

splurged following the signing to close to 35,000 season tickets. But the team stumbled on the field, finishing with a 6-12 record and drew an average of about 33,000 fans per game in the 76,000-seat stadium. 
USFL commissioner Chet Sim­mons has said that the 12 original USFL teams, who paid $2 million each to join the league, lost between $20 million and $30 million last year with the Generals losing a reported S3 million. Six expansion teams will begin play next year in Memphis, Jacksonville, Oklahoma City, Pitts­burgh, Houston and San Antonio, having paid $6 million each to join the league. 
Lonn Berney, a New York attor­ney, said last week he headed a group that was close to an agree­ment to purchase the Generals for S9 million and move them to New

York. Duncan, however, denied the deal and insisted he would not sell to anyone who intended to move the Generals. 
Trump has been a power for near­ly a decade in the interrelated worlds of New York City real estate ... 
and politicians. 
His hotel and apartment projects in Manhattan include the new Hyatt Hotel over Grand Central Station and the still-under-construction covention center. But his crowning achievement is the plush Trump Tower, combining 13 floors of offices and chic boutiques with 49 stories of condominiums ranging in price from $500,000 to S1.2 million.

of teamwork. 
Notre Dame's heritage of football greatness began before Rockne. It will last beyond Faust. Because it is built on discipline, cooperation, self­sacrifice--qualities that blend individual skill and spirit into fighting, winning teams. 
Teamwork always has been important in Michiana. Through the years, Michiana people have proven their willingness to put aside their differences, to work together to make their commun­ities alive with economic, education, cultural and spiritual opportunity. 
We at 1st Source Bank are proud to be part of the Michiana team. We're delighted that we have been able to play a role in a continuing regional effort to revitalize the economy through local business ownership. 
Of course, we know the game is not over. But we also think the time is right to celebrate the Notre Dame/Michiana tradition of teamwork. So we are pre­senting two very special television programs-"Wake Up the Echoes'' and ''Building with Our Vision." 
"Wake Up the Echoes" is the spine-tingling history of Notre Dame football. "Building with Our Vision" tells the bright story of Michiana yesterday, today and tomorrow. Thanks to the team­work of the staff at WNDU-TV, the two programs will be shown without commercial interruption starting at 3:30 P.M. SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, ON CHANNEL 16.

considered for commissioner of baseball?" somebody asked him. 
"If Hank thinks so, fine," Willie responded. "But you gotta ask your­self, 'Is he qualified?' You gotta be more than a onetime great ball player. You can't pick a commis­
., "Si'Oner on the color ofhis skin or just 
to make up for past injustices. 
"It's a big job. The commissioner must be a lawyer, a negotiator, a bus­inessman and a diplomat. He has to know all about TV contracts, player­management relations and stuff like that. 
"More than anything else, he has to be strong." 
When asked if there was anybody he thought might be right for the job, which Bowie Kuhn vacates at the end of the year, Willie rolled his eyes, pondered a moment and replied: 
"I don't want to say." 
Asked if he himself were in­terested, the all-time; All-Star in­dulged in the luxury ofa belly-laugh. 
"Me?" he said. "Not my thing." 
Mays was one ofthe special guests at New York's 21 Club restaurant yesterday to promote the second an­nual "Greatest Sports Legends" reunion next month at Bally's Park Place Hotel in Atlantic City, N.J. 
Some 60 super stars from a dozen sports will assemble for the party, including Larry Holmc:s, Eddie Ar­caro, Bob feller, Johnny Unitas, Mark Spitz, Bobby Riggs, Wilma Rudolph, Billy Casper and Gordie Howe. 
Willie took a 5100,000-a-year job as director of community affairs for the New Jersey casino some two months after he was formally in­ducted into baseball's Hall of Fame Aug. 5, 1979. 
Commissioner Kuhn immediately ordered him to sever all working relations with baseball on the premise that, as. an employee of a gambling casino, he would be exposed to unsavory influences. Later, the same action was taken against Mickey Mantle, another Hall of Farner, who accepted a similar position with a rival hotel.

day's pivotal loss, did it again yester­
day. 
He crossed the line too soon and 
had to circle back and start over. By 
the time he got there again, Liberty 
was 37 seconds ahead, a huge ad­
vantage and the fourth time in five 
races Conner had won the start. 
Bertrand immediately hoisted the 
protest flag, but that quickly became 
unnecessary. 
Conner, whose knack for finding the wind shifts had been the most noticeable difference in the series, sailed far to the right side of the course, leaving Australia II alone to pick up a 10-degree wind shift to port. 
Bertrand took full advantage and catapulted into the lead, never to trail again. 
He led by 23 seconds at the first mark, 4.5 miles into the race on the 24.3-mile triangular course. 
Bertrand held that margin after the second leg, a crosswind reach earlier races, and still led by 18 seconds after the third leg, also a reach. 
Rounding the fourth mark, it was Australia II by a safe I: I I, and there was no catching her as the wind diminished to I 0-1 5 knots. 
Turning for the final beat upwind, the Aussies led by 52 seconds. 
The victory, which took .3 hours, 29 minutes and I3 seconds, destroyed wh;lt was left of any form chart for this series, which saw Australia II advertised as the most serious threat yet to take away the Cup and break the longest winning streak in sports. Australia II, in fact, was favored by British bookmaker~. 
Each of the I2-meter yachts has won one race in light-to-medium wind, which was supposed to favor the lighter and more maneuverable Australia II. 
And equipment problem~ clouded the races in heavier wind. Besides Liberty's problem yester­day, Australia II broke a steering pul­ley in the first race and lost its

Sports 
Johnson contributes some punishment 
ByTRISH SULLIVAN 
Sports Writer 
There's never been any doubt. joe johnson has always known why he chose Notre Dame. 
"I came to Notre Dame because their football team wins games. Before I leave, I intend to he a part of that." 
johnson, a 6-2, 189-pound letter­man, entered Notre Dame in 1981 as part of the first class that Head Coach Gerry Faust recruited. Yet out of this highly talented class, johnson, along with roommate Joe Howard, were the only two mem­bers to crack into the starting lineup. 
"I really didn't expect my fresh­man year to come together as It did," saysJohnson. "My first goal was just to make the traveling team." 
Not only did he make the travel­i-:tg team, but during his freshmen year, he started in all II games and played the most minutes of any freshman player on defense. 
In his sophomore year, johnson switched positions from free safety to strong safety -a change that he welcomed. 
"I like strong safety better be· cause It lets me use my quickness more," says johnson. "Whereas before I had to go into a drop-back coverage, strong safety allows me to come up quick on the line. It also gives me the opportunity to get in there and hit more." 
johnson's aggressive style is very 
evident on the field and his 
teammates are well aware of this.

The growth of a program 
The Notrl· Dame volleyball team·~ record stands at +II ( ·l·.~ on the season and 0-H in tournaml'nt play). That hn't a mark for people to cheer about, or for playt·rs and coaches to hl· proud of. 
Hut it isn't a mark for people to laugh at or shake their hctd~ at. Beti>re people ~o writing the Irish off or makin~ them the butt of mediocre minor sports jokes, tlll'y should take a clo,er look at lhl· points the pro~ram ha~ won that don't show on the S<:orehoard. 
Let's go hack three years to the first season of varsity status for volleyball. Underclassmen obviously weren't here to remember that time. Even many seniors would have to strain to recollect the existence of varsity vol­leyball hack then. It wasn't exactly a threat to the popularity offootball or basketball. 
But, being a charter member of that inaugural team, it's not hard for me to look hack with amazement at the transformations the program has gone through and the prol>(ress the changes have incurred. 
Three years ago, all the team had was itself -12 walk-on players, one mana~er, and Coach Sandy Vansla~er. Since then, with the help of what Vanslager calls "substantial" monetary hacking hy the athletic ad­ministration, those nmbers have changed. 
Since the second season when the first two scholar­ships were awarded to Josie Maternowski and Mary jo Hensler, five more grant-in-aids have been doled out. Now, seven ofthe the 12 team members are on scholar­ship. 
Vanslager also is not alone in her coaching duties. First there was Dan Anderson, hut now Rick Nunez fills the po!'ition ofIrish assistant coach. 
Besides scholarships, the increase in funds has per­mitted the team to jump from Division II AlAW to Divi­sion I NCAA. With that move comes a tougher schedule, improved travel conditions, and national recognition. 
This year the Irish have already competed against the likes of Kentucky, Georgia, and San Diego State. They are expected to see at least 10 of the top twenty teams in the country. 
Three years ago we faced Goshen, Manchester, and Anderson in big games. Our farthest trip was to Evansville, Ind. (seven hours In a crowded van) to com­pete in a conference tournament -which we lost. 
At the end of this season, Notre Dame will fly to Louisiana to face such teams as Nebraska, Arizonia State, and LSU. That tournament is even being televised in the Southeast. 
"It's not just the fact that we are playing these teams 
that counts," Vanslager says. "You have to keep in mind 
that these programs have been in existence for years. 
Their players have been together for three and four 
presses confidence in johnson's capabilities. 
"The defense feels very confident when joe is in there," he says. "We know that if we miss our man, joe will he right there to put punish­ment on the back." 
There was also a possibility, Larkin explains, that johnson may have replaced him at linebacker when he went down with a pre­season injury. 
"I've never seen a strong safety like to stick offensive backs as much as he does," explains fell()w Ollio native Larkin. "He plays with great intensity." 
Strong safety is where johnson , was playing Saturday in one of the better games of his career thus far. He finished with six tackles while breaking up two key Michigan State pass plays. 
Yet, despite johnson's outstand­ing performance, it was a disappoint­ing afternoon. 
"There's no doubt we were the better team on the field Saturday," admits johnson. "But the big plays 
hurt  us.  We  just made  too  many  
mistakes."  
One  very  crucial  mistake  oc­ 

curred in the first quarter when Spartan quarterback Dave Yarema hit Darryl Turner over the middle for an 81-yard touchdown play. johnson explains the error simply. 
"It was just a matter of some missed assignments on our part and Michigan State doing it right." 
With the Spartans passing for a to­see JOE, page 9

years. They are awfully familiar with each other and their program." 
As a result of the increased scholarships and strong competition, Notre Dame has has to respond to the challenge in the quality of play. In the old days, we played a very simple and basic 6-2 offense. We didn't get fancy. 
Now, the Irish are making the difficult transition to a 5-1 line-up. Without getting technical, it requires players to take on more responsibility for maintaining and defending their positions. They have to know where to go, and when and how to get there. 
"It's a mental adjustment," Vanslager says. "You are being knocked out ofa position you know well and put into a new one. It's a matter ofchanging roles and learn­ing new ones." 
Perhaps to most people, the two statistics that best display the difference between then and now are records and attendance. 
Our first year, we were 3-19. The second year, gradual improvement boosted the team to 16-24. Then, last year for the first time, Notre Dame posted a winning record-an unbelievable 25-9. 
In our opening home match freshman year, we were being optimistic when we told people there were 50 people in the Pit. In Notre Dame's home opener against Georgia, Vanslager received an attendance figure of 325! And the games haven't even been moved to the Arena -yet (predicted for the October 18 match against St. Francis-Joliet). 
What all ofthese facts and figures should point out is that 4-11 is nothing to shake a finger at. In the com­posit~ picture, Notre Dame volleyball has won many tough battles offthe court that will never show up in the record books. It's not time to get down on the team. As Vanslager points out, "We're just in another phase of a giant growing process." 
Looking back over the years, I find it particularly ap· propriate to coin a certain commercial cliche, "You've come a long way baby." People might be shaking their heads at the team, but at least they're aware that Notre D.lme has a volleyball team.

Saint Mary's volleyball squad amazes Grace 
By ROSEMARY WHALEN 
Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's volleyball team scored their second victory of the season over Grace College last night in the Angela Athletic facility. 
First-year coach Brian Goralski was pleased with the Belles' confi­dent play in defeating Grace I5-:i, 15-0, 15-8. "We are expanding our multiple offense more and hope this will prove successful in the upcom­ing Illinois Benedictine Tournament this Saturday." 
Saint Mary's was represented hy a lineup comprised of senior co­captains Miki Maternowski and Loret Haney, along with backup sup­port from juniors Molly Baker, Teresa Rotta, and Ann Boutton. Sophomores Patrice Grant and jean WPivand, and freshmen standouts Pah, dlliams, Ann Brown, Pomi Smith, and Megan Brown also played a major role in the Belles' success. 
Saint Mary's started off strong with a fine display of offensive play, as Teresa Rotta and Patty Williams 
combined to serve nine straight points. This gave the Belles the op­portunity to try their new offensive game plan. They called on Haney for consistent setting. 
"Loret is an excellent setter," said freshman hitter Ann Brown. The Belles had a good night following Haney's lead. 
Boutton, the Belles strong middle

hitter, teamed up with Brown and outside spikers Williams, Rotta, B;1ker and Maternowski to hit Grace's weak spots consistently. 
Boutton commented, "We're still learning our new multiple offense and tonight had the opportunity to try more plays." 
Saint Mary's looked confident in moving the hall well inside and then surprised Grace with strong outside hitting by Williams. 
"The team has been working ex­tremely hard the last two weeks," said Haney. "We are beginning to gel as a team, and hopefully all our hard work will continue to pay off this weekend at the Illinois Benedictine Tournament."
