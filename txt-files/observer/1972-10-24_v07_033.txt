Masters &Johnson pack Washington hall 
Claim religious orthodoxy can create sexual dysfunction 
by Ann Therese Darin Campus News Editor 
Religious orthodoxy, whether Roman Catholic, Jewish, or fundamentalist Protestant. can create a sexual dysfunction, claimed Dr. William H. Masters, a noted obstetrician-gynecologist last night. 
Appearing with his wife, Virginia E. Johnson. co-director of St. Louis's Reproductive Biology Research Foundation with her husband Masters, the physician lectured on "Sex as a Natural Function" to a crowd of sutdents packed into Washington Hall. 
In response to a question by a student after a forty-five minute speech, Masters made the correlation between the problem when in­dividuals interpret orthodox religion and sexual disturbances. The sex as sinful syn­drome, he revealed, is one of the greatest obstacles toward normal sexual life in America. 
For the greaeter part of their lecture, the celebrated husband and wife team traced the problems created by not viewing sex as a natural function along with. breathing, eating, and other physical realities. 
"Sex is something you were born with the facility of accomplishing," defined Johnson. "Social controls developed for natural function, but through misun­derstanding and hopefully not maliciousness, the assigned controls to sexuality did not represent the naturalness of the function." She added that the common assumption that sexuality can be exposed to artificial controls and still remain healthy, creative and a birthright is a myth. 
The key to sexuality, Masters related, he learned in interviewing prostitutes in the mid­1950's. "Don't ever try to be an expert on the other person's background or needs," he advised. "Tell the other person what you think honestly and be a good listener... No man ever has been or ever will be an expert on the female sexual function ... No woman is an expert on man's needs physically or psychologically." 
Besides stressing the concept of sexuality 
as birthright and natural, the St. Louis-based 
team also examined and destroyed several 
popular myths about sexuality in modern 
America a~ a part of life, as the responsiblity 
of the ma,e partner, and as real as the 
Madison Avenue portrayal of it in ads. 
"One of the most universal myths," said 
Johnson. "was that. sex is a part of the 
whole of living. We don't fmd that much 
living it in this fashion, though. What we find 
is that it's considered apart from per­sonality.. " 

When she and her husband first began publishing articles and books in 1960 on human sexuality, Johnson remembered the critical comments. "If you know what it is," she mimicked the critics, "if it loses its mystery, then there's nothing left." 
"Mystery or specialness," she contended, "is completely individual to the person in­volved when people seek conformity, sooner or later, the birthright will be elusive when someone tries to exercise it." 
Both Johnson and her husband also blasted the myth, sex is something a man does to or for a woman. "Women harbor a concept," believes Johnson, "that if she expresses herself in any spontaneous way, she will be thought too aggressive or wholly experienced, to put her partner in the position of notefully exercising his sexual capabilities, and to misread or transgress some kinds of male prowess." According to Johnson, this is the greatest cause of sexual dysfund­tion today. Women perceive the male as the leader in the sexual act, she said. A great degree of male impotence can be linked to the woman's inability to express herself sexually. 
"Sexual functioning is the most effective means·of communication between a man and a woman. Communication is the exchange of vulnerability," they analyzed. "Sex is with someone, not at the expense of someone." 
Because of the exaggerated importance advertising has given breasts and male genitals, Masters and Johnson also denounced Madison Avenue advertising forms. "Madison Avenue convinced America that the bigger breasted woman was sexually superior," they explained. According to the team, tragically males and females alike have become breast conscious. 
"The size of the breast has nothing whatsoever to do with female responsibility," Masters alleged. "Ifyou think it is just males who believe the myth, who buys padded bras and has breast surgery'?" he quizzed. 
They also condemned the similar phenomenon regarding male genitals. These myths, they assert, cause destruction, ap­prehension and misunderstanding. 
To illustrate the antiquated view of sexuality in modern America, Johnson referred to present Indiana state law which prohibits certain normal actions of in­tercourse. In Maryland, according to the St. Louis gynecologist, masturbation is illegal. "If one were to enforce the sex laws.in all the states," he said, "we'd have a hard time finding jailers." 
The hesitancy to. discuss sexual activity is 
not limited to public discussions, Johnson: sexuality as a healthy, creative 

birthright. 
Johnson related. The first course in American medical schools on sexual function was taught in 1960. "Twenty per cent of all medical schools today believe that medical students shouldn't be instructed on the sub­ject." he reported. 
Johnson remembered that even ten years ago the topic of sex was kept on clinical and professional level. "It wasn't until 1966 when the New York Times and the Wall Street .Journal used anatomical terms on their front pages, she recalled. "Two years ago, people were willing to talk about it (sex), but not without laughter." 
In a question and answer period following the talk, a student asked Masters if the Notre Dame regulation concerning parietals could have permanent effect on a normal sex life of a student. Masters responded "I don't think it has any!" 
He responded to a query to evaluate Dr. David Reuben's book, Everything You've Wanted To Know About Sex But Were Afraid To Ask and Any Woman Can by asking for the next question.

WashhiKton -The capital awaited the return of Henry A. Kissinger from Saigon amid continuing speculation that a Vietnam or all-Indo-China cease-fire was near, but with no firm agreement to end the war apparently reached. It was thought that Kissinger would report to Nixon on his talks with President Nguyen Van Thieu, and probably fly to Paris to continue negotiations with the North Vietnamese there. 
New York-Twelve national art works whose total worth is estimated as more than $500,000 were stolen last Thursday

night from the Caramoor Center of Music and the Arts in suburban Katonah. The theft, which included a portrait by Lucas Cranach and Chinese works dating back to the Ming Dynasty, was not disclosed until Monday at the request of both local and federal authorities investigating the case, according to Michael Sweeley, Caramoor's executive director. 
Philadelphia -Sen. George McGovern visited patients in the United States Naval Hospital in Philadelphia to dramatize his Veterans Day pledge to provide jobs, education and health care for veterans of the Vietnam War. The Democratic presidential nominee said that he would join in the "rejoicing" if President Nixon should negotiate a peace settlement , even on election eve.

A Tough Job Ahead 
Whoever comes out on top in the election of a woman representative to the Student Life Council will actually come out at the bottom of a lot of work that must be done. 
The SLC has the makings of an exciting body this year. Simply from the point of view of meetings as a complete body, and as a council of committees, it shows signs 
of surpassing the efficiency of any SLC in the past. 
Its members realize this is a do or die year, and they certainly are showing all the vital signs of life. Meetings have not become bogged in Robert's Rules of Order, and the reason seems to be a general spirit of cooperation among all parties, rather than the student versus administration contests of the past when the faculty was courted or pressured to cast the deciding votes a certain way. 
Perhaps this is only because the council is just beginning to scratch the surface of major issues. When it does penetrate to the guts of the issues, the members will find more than enough work to keep them busy.

r sex & myth 
Editor:

In his review of Sex and Myth 
by Eugene Kennedy, Father 
McNally cites studies showing 
"young men and women who have 
been virgins before marriage 
make better adjustments and are 
less likely to divorce than those 
who have had premarital sex 
relations." While the statistic is 
probably reliable, I object to the 
implicit suggestion of a causal 
relationship between non-virginity 
and marital disharmony. Because 
the two are correlated with one 
another does not allow the 
assumption of causality. It is 
possible that factors associated 
with persons involved in 
premarital sexual behavior might 
have some role in disrupting 
marjtal stability, but not 
a lack of virginity, per se.

assigned to the Campus Life Committee. This is probably the most important SLC committee as far as students are con­cerned because it will recommend a North Quad dormitory as the next woman's hall, as well as investigate a coed halL 
Before the recommendation is made the committee will establish a liason with the rectors' committee; and study the structure, location, spirit activities, and alumni, student and feminine opinions of each hall under consideration. 
In addition to this she will be respon­sible for digesting reports and casting responsible votes on issues researched by the other three committees, and main­taining efficient communication with her constituents. 
Primary is important 

Today's primary is not important because it narrows the field of candidates from six to three, but because the best three must be selected from the run-off. 
Those of you who will care enough to vote should keep the above respon­sibilities in mind, or more than just the woman students will lose the extra benefits of having the best person in the SLC. 
The campus is not only watching this election, but it is counting on you whether it will admit it or not. 
As nearly everyone connected with the Notre Dame community must have heard by now, Father Hesburgh has appointed a Com­mittee on University Priorities which is charged to assess the University's "total mission" with a view to determining which are the most important elements of this mission "as contrasted with what might have seemed desirable under other circumstances.'' Such an assessment will make it easier to evaluate present and future priorities in the various areas of University life. The day-to-day running of the University requires incessant decisions, and thus in­volves explicit and implicit priorities. But, as Father Hesburgh notes, the present times seem to call for a thorough-going scrutiny of these priorities in the context of the aims of the University taken as a whole. The Committee will report to the Academic Council. The Committee has for a start decided to set up task forces in four areas: Research and Instruction, University Disciplines, University Facilities, and Enrollment. other groups will be constituted later. These task forces will directly 
Don Ruane 
involve many people outside the Committee itself, adding welcome expertise and drawing on every 
relevant point of view in preparation for the difficult and complex discussions that lie ahead. The composition of the first task forces will be announced shortly. 
In the meantime, the Committee would like to solicit suggestions and advise from trustees, faculty, students, administration, and alumni. The matter of University priorities is one in which everyone is engaged, and on which everyone has ideas to contribute . The Committee would be ineffective if it were to attempt to work in isolation; it intends on the the contrary to draw on the experience of the university community as a whole in every way that is feasible. 
Your help is sincerely and in­sistently requested in order that our task may be successfully carried through. 
Sincerely, Ernan McMullin, Secretary University Committee on Priorities 


Buried on the second page of last Wenesday's Observer was an in­teresting notice. According to the six-paragraph announcement, there will be a special election "to select a representative for the Student Life Council from Badin and Walsh" on Tuesday, October 24." This statement is attributed to Peg Pollara, a "member of the Walsh executive council" The announcement continues "one representative from Badin, Walsh, off-campus women and Notre Dame women living at St. Mary's will be elected." No where in the article is the question "WHY?" raised or answered. In the original story reporting the SLC meeting last week where the decision was reached published last Tuesday, there was also no mention of "WHY?" But, it is this question and its answer which is more important than all of the trivial election rules. 
Why should the SLC seat a woman representing the newly-admitted Notre Dame coeds? Why should the Student Life Council designate a seat which was for the the Student Body President and decided that a woman, who would be elected in a special election, assume all the rights and privileges that go with it? Who is Peg Pollara and what is her relationship with student government which usually monitors the SLC elections? 
Since women arrived on campus last month, there has been a movement afloat to make sure that they feel at home-to make sure that they feel they are one with the students. It was a noble, if im­possible, task for the older students to attempt to make the new women feel at ease -especially when they were competing with a deluge of microphones, television cameras, a corps of newspaper and magazine reporters misquoting and photographing every woman in sight. But,if I remember correctly, the general theme of the welcome was to make the women feel a part of as opposed to apart of the campus. It was this idea that was fostered during the first Student Life Council election last mongh. The two women's dorms were placed in a district with three other dorms, Dillon, Alumni, and Sorin. An advantage for a woman to be elected. The student government poohbahs who divided the districts could have split the two women's dormitories lumping the Badin votes with Morrissey, Howard and Lyons and Walsh's votes with St. Ed's, Cavanaugh and Zahm. In the first election the women were treated as equals. No woman chose to run for the district V seat during the nominating period. So the race was between Frank Devin of Dillon, H-Man <Dennis Etienne) of Alumni and a freshman. Jan Waltman, a third-floor Badin resident decided to run as a write-in candidate on the day of election. In spite of her good showing 002 votes) compared with 193 for Devine and 118 for H-Man, she lost. But more important than her good showing was that the women were equal with the men. They were treated as Notre Dame students, not as women, not as objects, but on a par with the residents of Alumni, Sorin and Dillon. 
Less than a month later, the Student Life Council decided to give the seat vacated by Bob Kersten to a woman representative. Although no reason has been publicly given for the decision, the most recurring one around campus is that the SLC wanted to give the women a voice on campus-to make them equal. They have a voice on campus. They freely elected Frank Devine to be their spokesman on the Student Life Council. There are approximately 300 women living in Badin and 
Walsh and not even half of them chose to elect a woman to the Stucent Life Council. It would be interesting to survey the SLC representatives to see whose dictum they were following in designating a woman to sit on the Board. Surely not the women's vote. It is also hardly likely that they were following the recommendations of the administrator's in the provost's office, since Sr. John Miriam Jones can act as spokesman for the undergraduate women and their so-called problems. 
By letting the women of Notre Dame elect an undergraduate woman representative to the Student Life Council, the SLC is committing several injustices. The SLC is degrading the Notre Dame women. Instead of treating them as equals (as they the in the first SLC election last month>, the council is treating the women unequally by giving them special privileges not allowed to other minority groups on campus. For example, if the SLC is so concerned about minority representation on the Council, why wasn't a seat apportioned to the black student community of the chicano student community as well as the women? While some would argue that the problems inherent in accepting women as Notre Dame students could be alleviated with an SLC seat, the even more serious problems which other minority groups not as lucky as the women , face on this campus deserve equal concern and treatment. 
Second, the SLC is dealing an injustice to Frank Devine, the original representative of District V: Badin, Walsh, Alumni, and Dillon, and Sorin. How seriously will his opinions be considered at SLC meetings, since he represents only half of a district? By decreasing the number of students in Devine's district, the SLC is also doing an injustice to the remaining constituents of District V in Dillon, Sorin and Alumni. Perhaps the majority of residents in these halls did not want Devine as their SLC representative, perhaps they wanted H-Man or perhaps, knowing that the representative would be from Dillon, Sorin, or Alumni, they would have chosen to elect someone else entirely? It is not fair to these students to have Devine represent them when they might not have wanted him. 
However, the greatest injustice is being done to the women them­selves. The women chosen in today's primary are chosen because they are women, not because of any talent or experience she might they might incidentally have. They will be a token to pacify the conscience of the SLC. They can alays turn to the woman SLC member and say, "As a woman ... " or "as the representative for the women on cam­pus ... " 
Another injustice is being done to the Notre Dame women who must live at St. Mary's this year.According to the opening sentence of Wednesday's article the representative must live in Badin and Walsh, however, any undergraduate Notre Dame woman can vote. But, which Notre Dame women living at SMC? There are at least three distinct classes. 
It is unfortunate that Notre Dame has chose to seat a woman on the Student Life Council in the manner they have chosen. Instead of acknowledging the important contributions that women can make on this campus as equals, they have insulted their new women students by making them tokens.

Y'know, a lot of people get something called "goose bumps" or "goose flesh" under certain conditions (other than South Bend's meterology report>.

SLC committee 
Bayh, Brade~nas teaiJl swing through area 
by Jerry Lutkus 
U. S. Senator Birch Bayh made a campaign swing through northern Indiana yesterday afternoon pushing the re-election of Congressman John Brademas. 
Bayh, the Junior Senator from Indiana, struck out at the Nixon Administration and called at­tention to Brademas' record in Congress. His trip included stops in Michigan City, South Bend, Goshen, and Elkhart. 
Bayh and Brademas addressed a crowd at a noontime luncheon at the Morris Inn. The crowd, con­sisting mainly of St. Joseph County Democratic leaders, heard Bayh claim the President Nixon's priorities are "out of whack." 
In particular Bayh questioned Nixon's veto of the anti-pollution bill last week. He claimed that even though the President vetoed the bill for inflationary reasons, he nonetheless went ahead with plans to ask Congress to fund plans for a Trident submarine which wasn't even off the drawing board yet. 
After the luncheon, the two In­diana politicians stopped at the UAW Local 9 hall in South Bend. 

dorms. 
As of this date, reports Kezele, letters have been sent to 22 dif­ferent universities maintaining coed dorms, requesting a report on their experences with the arrangement. 
Committee personnel suggested other forms this change in lifestyles could take, including creating some kind of system in which faculty live in the student residence hals, such as Prof. Frank O'Malley now living in Lyons. 
Another direction, decided the committee, could be to allow married hall resident assistants, or hall residence by other married university personnel, in an effort to bring more family life onto the campus to break the campus' sometimes "closed and stagnant" atmosphere. 
Considerations for renovation and new uses for the LaForutne Student Center, recently subjects of some discussion in ad­ministrative and student gover­nement circles, were batted about by the Committee yesterday af­ternoon. 
"We're not interested so much in 
crowd on the problems of the aged and aging. 
Bayh again took the opportunity to slash at the priorities of the Nixon Administration. 
After a half-hour ride, Brademas and Bayh took to the streets of Goshen shaking hands before they proceeded to Goshen College to address another small crowd. 
Bayh spoke of the "mediocrity" of the Nixon administration, the case of unsuccessful appointee Harold Carswell. 
"Not only was Carswell a racist, but he was a mediocre racist at that," Bayh claimed. 
Brademas joined in the attack pointing out the corruption of the Nixon White House. 
"I believe that the Vietnam War has dulled the moral consciousness of the American people," Brademas said. We cannot scream out with moral outrage any longer he asserted. 
According to the congressman, the dulled consciousness permits 
the  people  to  overlook  the  
corruption,  the  incidents  like  
Watergate,  and  deals  like  the

ID checker reinstated at the South Dining Hall

A student petition helped Mary Carmola, an ID checker at the west end of the south dining hall, to be reinstated to her post after being temporarily switched to the east section. 
Nick Catrambone, who started the petition said yesterday, "We met her last year and we just got to know her very well. She usually sits down and talks to us after they shut the dining hall, but not long ago, we noticed she wasn't there.

Shakespeare marathon held for Sister Marita's School 
by Mary Egan 
Observl'r Staff Reporter 
The Sigma Chapter of Alpha Phi Omega, a national service fraternity at N.D., will hold a 100­hour Shakespeare-reading marathon to benefit Sister M. Marita 's Day School in South Bend. 
The marathon will run from 
12:00 noon this Thursday until 4:00 
p.m. Monday. It will occur in the South Quad between the Law Building and Alumni Hall near the flagpole. A barrel will be there to collect donations. 
"We hope to raise at least $300.00 for the school," said Rick Ullinger, the head coordinator of the marathon. Sister Marita runs her own school for 1st through 3rd graders in the inner city with the help of a few teacher's aides. Donations pay for books, supplies, and all the expenses of the school. 

Volunteers are needed to help in the reading, which will consist of the entire works of Shakespeare. To volunteer or get information, call coordinators Rick Ullinger or Vince Wagner at 1553 or go to 432 Cavanaugh. 
Two years ago a group of in­terested N.D. students held a similar marathon, 97 hours long, to benefit the day school.

Keenan loses, Morrissey scared 
by Stan Urankar 
A pair of perennial campus powers were surprised in Sunday afternoon's lnterhall action. -Morrissey, winners of all their regular season games in the last three years, were shocked by Cavanaugh in a scoreless tie and KPenan. 1970 campus runne~s-up, fell from their spot at the top of LPague Three in a 6-Q loss to Stanford. 
l\1orrissf"y U, Cavanaugh 0 
"Cavanaugh played a really great game," commented Marauder coach Ron Salyer after the liO-minute deadlock. "You can't take anything away from them. They were up for us, and they played good football." 
"We (Morrissey> have looked progressively worse in every game this year," Salyer added. "We had a first and goal at their 11, but an offsides penalty and a fumble knocked us right out of scoring position."

The Irish Eye 
==============================================The not over yet
seoson's 
As coach AI Onofrio said to his Missouri Tigers one week ago, it's time to forget about last week and worry about this Saturday's game. The Tigers used the memory of their brutal, 62-Q shellacking at the hands of Nebraska only as an incentive to improve their play and avoid further embarrassment. They didn't let it keep them "down" and they certainly didn't quit. Saturday, it was Mizzou that did the embarassing, surprising the heavily-favored Fighting Irish, 30-26 in Notre Dame Stadium. 
At Notre Dame, where the national championship is the annual goal, a single loss takes on theproportions of a major disaster. After an Irish defeat there's always much wailing and gnashing of teeth lots of old­fashioned, hard core, end-of-the-bar cuss words bandied ab~ut an initial burst of disgust with the football team, accompanied by not a small feeling of betrayal, and the general cry that "the season's over now". All of which is just so much gar-barge, as the French say. 
This football season is far from over. It's precisely halfway finished. Notre Dame still looks to improve on last year's 8-2 record. The Irish are still seeking a return to the top ten in the final rankings, a position they vacated for the first time since 1963last fall. And Notre Dame still has a shot at the national title. That's right, the national title. 
Impossible, you say? Well, improbable -yes. Impossible? No, cer­tainly not impossible, especially with the frequency that major upsets are occuring in college football this season. 
I 
For starters, it should be pointed out that only five major college teams are still unbeaten at the midway mark in the season --Southern California, Alabama, Ohio State, Michigan, and Louisiana State. 
The Irish, of course, wind up their season against the ,currently top­rated Trojans, giving them a golden opportunity to spoil USC hopes for a perfect season, as the Trojans have so often done to Notre Dame. 
Looking at the situation a bit more deeply, the schedule shows that the other four unbeaten clubs play one of the "perfect teams". Ohio State 
t clashes with Michigan in the season finale for both squads and that game will undoubtedly decide the Big Ten title. LSU and Alabama square off in just two weeks, with the winner having a good chance to annex the Southeast Conference chanmpionship. Two more teams have to be eliminated from the ranks of the unbeaten before the season ends. The Irish will have a chance to add Southern California to that list of defeated ball clubs. Which leaves only the win­ners of those big conference battles without a blemish. But the holde~ of the Big Ten crown must face the Pacific Eight titlist, probably USC, m the Rose Bowl and victory there won't be easy. If Alabama beats LSU, and the Crimson Tide looms as slim favorites arch rival Auburn and a top-flight bowl opponent will be waiting in the wi~gs to pin a defeat on "Bear" Bryant's club. LSU plays always tough Mississippi the week before the 'Barna game and, if they win both, the Tigers will still have to get by Florida, Tulane and a bowl opponent to finsh unbeaten. And those two once-beaten powerhouses, Oklahoma and Nebraska still have their ~!l"ual donnybrook coming up in late November, saddli~g, in all probability, one of those teams with its second defeat. There's still plenty of time and many opportunities for a shake-up in the wire service polls. · While all this hoped-for activity is taking place in the upper echelons of the rankings the Irish have but one course of action open to them: to win and win big. It'll take more than a victory over USC to project Notre Dame back into the national championship picture. It'll also take a win over a tough opponent in a major bowl game, and the Irish may not get that opportunity if they don't start pummeling people, fast. Bowl com­mittees will have already extended bids prior to the December 2 meeting between the Trojans and the Irish and, as a result, Notre Dame will have to put together some impressive credentials in the upcoming weeks if they're to nab a prestigious bowl berth. There's no more time to play.. "nice guy". For once, Notre Dame will purposely have to roll up some scores. It's really too early to be talking about bowls but, r~ughly, the January 1lineup could appear this way: Rose -USC and Ohio State-Michigan; Orange -LSU-Alabama versus Nebraska-Oklahoma (unless the Irish look awfully good in the next few weeks~; Sugar-pick two from the losers of the LSU-Alabama and Oklahoma-Nebraska games and toss
... 
Notre Dame's name into the hat; Cottoln-Texas and some team that's out of the championship picture because the national title certainly won't be decided in Dallas this year. The Orange Bowl seems to be the spot where the real action's likely to be at. There, or in the Rose Bowl, which is closed to the Irish anyway. 
Notre Dame's task is far from easy. As stated, it's improbable, but not impossible. So let's see, if Notre Dame beats Texas, Stanford upsets Ohio State and LSU downs Nebraska -oops, wrong year. But you get the picture. 

The tie doesn't hurt the Marauders in the: League Two standings, though. With only a game to play, they still hold a three-point lead over idle Farley. 
Stanford li, Kef"nan 0 
One play spelled the end of this North Quad winning streak. Stanford quarterback George Packer hit Tommy Ryan with a 20­yard touchdown pass on the last play of the first half to cap a 60­yard drive. 
Keenan coach Tom Ewing said, "We just weren't up for the game. Stanford was really psyched to win. and we just didn't go after them." 
Defensive back Pete Diamond picked off a Keenan aerial, and linebackers Rock Bochetti and Joe Totten anchored the winners' defense which has yet to be scored on this season.

Spartan 
by Greg Corgan 

It was a gloomy weekend all around for Notre Dame football teams as the Irish JV's dropped their game to Michigan State 26-14 Friday afternoon. Quarterback Steve Moerdyk provided the of­fensive punch for the Spartans completing touchdown passes of 7; 66, and 16 yards in bringing State their first victory in four starts. Notre Dame's junior varsity record dropped to 1-1 after an opening game win over Michigan. 
The Irish drew first blood by scoring in the initial period on a 19 yd. pass from Rick Slager to sophomore tight end Ed Bauer. The score capped a 57-yard, ten play drive. Bill Arment, a defensive tackle who doubles as a kicker then booted the extra point to make it 7-o. But the Spartans came right with Moerdyk, a sophomore from Grand Rapids, hitting end Bill Klotz with a 7-yd. scoring toss. Dirk Krijt added the extra point and at the end of the first period the score was tied at seven. 
Notre Dame came up with its second touchdown early in the next period. After a Spartan fumble at the MSU 22-yd. line the Irish moved in for the score, and needed just three plays as Russ Kornman scampered 11 yards for the touch­down. The freshman running back from Wauwatosa, Wisconsin picked up 105 yards in 16 tries and a touchdown for the afternoon to lead all Irish rushers. Arment again added the extra point to make the score 14-7. Michigan State evened the score at 14 as Moerdyk connected on hi second touchdown pass of the afternoon­this one a 66 yarder to halfback Dane Fortney. Krijt kicked his second of three extra points as the team, by forfeit.

Harriers routed by ISU 
by John Wick 

A powerful Indiana State squad trounced the Irish harriers 17-49 in a dual meet held last Friday o~ their home course at Terre Haute, Ind. 
Steve Hienderich of ISU breezed through the five mile course in the record-breaking time of 25:09 to claim individual honors. This was the fourth consecutive meet this season in which Hienderich has shattered his own previously-set course record. 
Both teams kept together in a close pack over the first few miles but the Sycamores, having the advantage of running on their home course, suddenly picked up the pace and left the surprised Irish behind to struggle over the long hills, which were constantly a 
hindrance  to  the  Notre Dame  
harriers.  
Notre  Dame's  Dan  Dunne  

grabbed second place but Indiana 
managed to put five men between Dunne and 8th place finisher Marty Hill to capture six of the top seven spots. Other finishers for the Irish included steadily improving sophomore Mike Housely, Mike Gahagan and Jeff Eichner. 
This weekend the Irish will again face tough competition when they travel to Lafayette, Ind. for the Indiana State Meet. Top con­tention will come from Ball State University, Indiana State University, and Notre Dame. The Ball State squad captured second place out of the thirty colleges and universities that participated in the recent Notre Dame In­vitational. The Cardinals were anchored by the third place finish of Steve Wyden, who will contend for individual honors in Friday's ~~et. Other Invitational par­ticipants scheduled to appear in the State meet will include Butler, Taylor, Purdue and Indiana Universities.
