Notre Dame waits for 2004 Ohio decision 

By CLAIRE HEININGER News Editor 
Mirroring their home state, Notre Dame students from Ohio lingered longest in front of election coverage Tuesday night as the race hinged on the final swing state's 20 electoral votes. 
Despite some television net­works' early declarations of victory for President Bush there, Katie Johnson, a sopho­more from Toledo, and Chris Tracy, a sophomore from Cincinnati, planned to stay up until the state's entire tally was in. 
"I don't think Ohio is defi­nitely in the bag yet," Tracy said after Fox News called the race for the president. "I think it's going to be too close." 
But the possibility of a statewide recount would not be as daunting as the Florida crisis in 2000, Tracy said. 
"I don't think a recount has the same stigma," he said. 
"People are expecting it," Johnson added. "Whichever party loses is going to try to find states where people weren't counted ... and drag this out." 
While both Tracy and Johnson voted for Bush, they acknowledged that the parti­
sanship consuming the country throughout the campaign would pose a challenge for whoever is the eventual win­ner. 
"Both parties need to show some leadership to calm it down a little bit," Tracy said. 
Taking a lighter tone as he watched the returns, Ryan lafigliola, a sophomore from a Cleveland suburb, basked in his state's sudden spotlight. 
"We're hoping [Bush] takes it on Ohio so we can take credit," he said, adding that a battle there was inevitable, due to the precedent that no Republican has won the presi­dency without taking Ohio and 
the heavy campaigning from Bush and Democratic chal­lenger John Kerry. 
Iafigliola, who mailed his absentee ballot overnight so it would arrive in time, said he understood the media's hesita­tion in declaring a winner.­
" A lot depends on how the networks cover it," he said. "They want to be real careful after 2000." 
The candidates must also avoid repeating past mistakes, political science professor David Campbell said. After AI Gore conceded on election night four years ago, he entered the Florida recount at a disadvantage -a scenario Campbell said was unlikely to occur this year. 
"You will only see a conces­sion if they're truly con­vinced," he said. 
And while an Ohio recount seems likely, Campbell added, the weeks and months of legal challenges predicted by national pundits· might not materialize. 
"A lot of people are operat­ing under the assumption that 2004 will be a repeat of 2000, but it's not certain in my mind that it'll play that way," he said. "A lot of bizarre things had to happen at once."

ND students, South Bend residents flood polls at JACC 
Election workers ease process for Tuesday voters 

By TERESA FRALISH Associate News Editor 
Election volunteer Abby Willas, a 17-year-old Mishawaka High School sen­ior, spent her Tuesday at the Joyce Center polling place explaining the intricacies and procedures of Indiana ballot­ing to voters -which includ­ed University President Father Edward Malloy. 
"I didn't know he was the president of Notre Dame until he was at the poll," Willas said. 
After Malloy walked back to the booth, the other election workers told her who she had just helped vote. 
"Our inspector Norma [Patton] asked to shake his hand. and I just thought he was being nice," she said. 
Celebrity run-ins aside, 
Willis said this election sparked her interest in poli­tics, and she felt compelled to become involved. 
"I wanted to volunteer for my party, and they said they needed someone to work at Notre Dame," she said. 
But regardless of the voter's affiliation, Willas and other precinct officials made sure that each person could fill out his or her ballot quickly and smoothly. 
"We really do protect the privacy of the voter," precinct sheriff Donna King said. 
Throughout the day, poll workers saw a steady stream of Notre Dame students and South Bend residents come to east their votes in the Joyee Center. 
"It's just awesome to see. They come in with walkers and canes," King f!_aid of elder­ly voters. 
King and her fellow election volunteers -two clerks and two vote judges -arrived at the JACC early to set up voting materials and snacks for the day. All Indiana polls were open from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday. 
"I've been here since 5 a.m.," King said. 
In the morning. poll workers said they saw mostly older voters, with more students showing up to vote in the afternoon. 
"We had the priests and brothers from Holy Cross and a few nuns," King said. 
This election yp,ar, Indiana replaced its old lflver-style vot­ing maehinfls with electronic scanners, and poll workers said they had few problems with the new ballots. 
"For me it seems simple,"

INSIDE COLUMN 
Surviving w-inter 
I know that many of you are ovnrwhelmed by the elections. This is why I decided to give you a little break from the elections by writing about something that has nothing to do with them. The result of the elections will not Pamela Lock really affect us until January. but one thing 
photographer
that will affect 
us in the imme­
diate future is 
the "wonderful" South Bend win­
ter. I am originally from Lima, 
Peru. As many of you might not 
know, Lima is located in the West coast of Peru, in the middle of a 
desert. Yes, that means no snow. 
As I was getting ready to come here last year, I had to be opti­mistic about South Bend winter and think that it was not going to bn that bad, because that would make the thought of the death of my summer for tlw nnxt four years not too terribly depressing. But I was completely wrong. 
When it started to get cold, I became more and more excil!~d about snow. I had seen snow before, but never on a daily basis. Thoughts about running out in the snow. having snowball fights and making snow angpls made me morn exdtnd for the snow season to start. l.ikn a littln kid, I would wake up nvcry morning and look outside to sec if it had started snowing ynt. lronkally, the day it startnd snowing was the day wlwn I rnaliwd I wanted it to stop. My ears, nose, fePt. hands and dweks were all literally freezing and numb. The only thing that kept me a little warm was thP thought of the beach and sun back horne and how much I wantnd to lw tlwre. 
As winter WIHlt by. the tmnpera­turn kept on dropping beyond my belief. I used morn and morn lay­ers, but it reached a point when I rnalized that they w1~rn not helping much. At that point. I was forc1~d to settle to thP idea that what had been the summer months for me were now going to be all about snow, wind. gloomy days and a lot of slipping and landing nat on the ground. I even ended up at a med­ical cnntPr in Mishawaka bncause of a terrible hip bruise from slip­ping and landing at the edge of a stop. 
I guess this column is mostly directed to the freshman intnrna­tional or U.S. students that come from warm regions. I survived. I'm not gonna lie, it is tough and it will probably get colder than what you think, but it eould be worse. You could be in my situation and not have a summer in four years at 
all. ~

College Democrats, Republicans look back on calllpaigns 
By JANICE FLYNN News Writer 
College Democrats gathered at Reekers' Tuesday night, surrounded by Kerry/Edwards posters, sporting blue T­shirts and political stickers. 
The group of nearly 50 students could have been mistaken for television political analysts, scrutinizing precincts and debat­ing the early returns. 
"We don't know anything yet," said co­president Colin Taylor reminded everyone early in the night. 
Over the past year, they have been to Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, Massachusetts, Tennessee and back again, keeping up with the frenetic pace of the campaign trail and doing their part to get out the Democratic vote. 
But while most College Democrats sat glued to their TVs while at the same time celebrating their months of commitment, others were still out on the road. 
On Monday night, a handful traveled back to Toledo, Ohio, where College Democrats had been over the weekend. They greeted Senator Kerry at a midnight airport rally and helped with the Election Day voting effort. 
Another group offered their help in Michigan. In South Bend, students were shuttled back and forth from campus to the Joe Donnelly campaign headquarters. 
For Helen Adeosun, the field coordina­tor for the Donnelly campaign at Notre Dame, Election Day culminated a year of dedication to the local campaign, induct­ing a summer internship where she lived with the Donnelly family. 
"It's been worth it and so much more," Adeosun said. "I never saw myself doing so much [in polities] in a million years. I'm really tired, but now I know this is what I want to do." 
Most of all, students said they felt proud to have been a part of the political process. 
"If we win or if we lose, I still feel like I've done something that I wanted to do, what was right to do," College Democrat 
Co-President Colin Taylor said. ''I'm not going to feel less satisfied." Like Taylor, College Democrats eo-presi­dent Nicola Buniek agreed. 
"You hear all this stuff about how Americans don't care about how the coun­try is governed," she said. "That's not been my experience.... The overwhelm­ing majority really tries to make the best choice for their family, for America. It makes me want to do more." 
Time on the campaign trail was the most encouraging aspect, students said. 
"[In] Wisconsin, one woman was telling me about all the attention she felt she was getting this election when she had felt very much ignored in many elections past," Meghan Hawley said. 
In Mjchigan, Blake Jackson took the campaign door-to-door and was followed around by MSNBC crew cameras. Although a few doors were slammed, most families were eager to hear what Kerry had to offer, and others simply com­plemented their efforts. 
"One [man] wouldn't tell me who he was voting for," Jackson said. "But he did tell me he appreciated what I was doing, so that was cool." 
Tuesday marked the first presidential election most college students could vote in, which has had a huge impact on the College Democrats' level of enthusiasm. 
"In hlgh school, you spend all day with people who can't vote, and you ean talk about it all you want," Hawley said. "But you can't do anything about it." 
Co-President Taylor said that students of all political ideologies were invited to the free food and camaraderie in Reekers, despite the obvious Democratic atmos­phere. 
While some students preferred to watch the returns alone because of nerves, the College Democrats expected the substan­tial turnout. 
"We've all worked on this together, in varying ways," Taylor said. "So it's only right that we watch it together."

Members of the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College Republicans joined a spirited crowd in celebrating the victory of incumbent U.S. Representative Chris Chocola at his campaign party held at the Marriott. 
"That was very exhilarating for us," Ian Ronderos, eo-president of the Notre 
Dame College Republicans, said. 
"To see him win makes me very happy -he's such a phenomenal person. He's not just a

"We called 20,000 people and made 
40,000 calls today," Honderos said. 
"And we were done early afternoon." 
These last-minute efforts were 
worthwhile, Honderos said. 
"From what we've been told by the 
campaign, it was highly successful. . When you're calling people for five

Chocola. 
"He is a great man who understands the youth vote, a congressman who takes his skills and knowledge of Indiana to [Washington] D.C. and represents Indiana very well," Fabina said. 
Tom Rippinger, eo-president of the Notre Dame College Republicans, stressed the importance of Chocola's win on the national level. 
"It's really the Congress that will set the agenda as to what legislation will be passed the next four years," Rippinger said. 
Ronderos said that he had been working for the Chocola campaign all year along with other Notre Dame College Hepublieans and that he worked on Chocola's last campaign in 2002. 
Starting at 8:15 a.m., Honderos and other volunteers began last minute get-out-the-vote efforts, calling all the registered Hepublieans in the dis­trict. 
ehanee, obviously. That's sometimes the trick,'; Ronderos said. Voter turnout increased greatly this year, Honderos said. ''I'd call at 8:15 and a person would say, 'I was waiting in line at 6:00 
a.m. so that I could vote early,"' Ronderos said. 
Saint Mary's College Hepublicans wore their "Belles for Bush" shirts and watched the election returns together, according to Fabina. 
Though the Second Congressional District is one of the most heavily contested, Choeola's actions in Congress helped carry him to victory, according to Rippinger. 
Hippinger cited Choeola's "Washington Waste Watchers" pro­gram as appealing to voters because it cuts down on "pork-barrel legisla­tion," or pet projects for districts.

"We started at 7 ]p.m.], and we are going to go until much later hnrc, until we go to Corby's," said Agganis. 
At H:32 p.m. the room explodes in cheers as the South Carolina electoral votes are awarded to Prnsident Bush. Each candidate has now won nine states.

We run into senior class president Darrell Scott, who informs us that over 100 senior class members showed up for the two-hour event, which had just ended.

The partiers hung a map of the United States, which they said they planned to color in at 10 p.m. when most of the elec­toral votes are in. However, we decided not to wait. We grabbnd some of the many varieties of desserts provided and headed on our way.

The Saint Mary's College Democrats arc gathered to watch the election results unf!1ld. The group of eight girls is planning to watch until about 11 p.m. 
Club President Sarah Staley spent her day doing last minute campaigning for Kerry. 
"I really appreciate being together when we are all so nervous," she said. 
Club Treasurer Lyndsey Bergen skipped all her classes today to go vote in her home state of Michigan. 
"I will be heartbroken if Bush wins," she said. "I am joining the Peace Corps next ynar, so it will be a good excuse for me to leave the country."

In Morrissey Hall alone, we lind one party for Bush, another for Kerry and one room divided. We decide to split up to taekle this hall.

10:35 p.m. Badin. Hall 
Badin's television room resembles a middle school slumber party. Pizza boxes, pop cans and pillows are dispersed throughout the lounge. Twenty-five girls wearing pajamas and munching on snacks watch intently to monitor the progress of their favorite candidate. 
Freshman Cassie Belek, a Kansas resi­dent and political science major, was not afraid to criticize President Bush's oppo­nent after hours of watching the coverage. 
"John Kerry's face looks like it's made of Play-Doh," she said. 
10:45 p.m. LaFortune Student Center 
We bypass two large groups of students quietly waiting fi1r election results in the Coleman-Morse Center in favor of the large, normally rowdy television lounge in LaFortune. Almost 50 students porch in front of the two TVs, but the room is strangely silent. 
"People have been mostly doing their work or pretending to do work, like me," said senior Mark Guest. 
Fellow seniors Bobby Davidson of Indiana and Nkk Leseanie of Pennsylvania reserved front-row seats starting at around 6:30. 
"I think it's been pretty standard," Davidson said. "There haven't been any surprises. Things are going pretty well in Pennsylvania fi1r Kerry ... there's a lot of rod ~n t!~e screen, but I'm not getting too worrwd. 
Lescanic is not worried either. 
"I think this is all really sad. It sucks that we don't have anybody really good to vote for. We can vote for an idiot or a bigger idiot," he said. "It's probably not going to be decided for another month anyway, 
so..." 

11 :03 p.m. We return to The Observer office, weary from all the election partying but none the worse for wear. The general feeling ofl"-campus was one of celebration, no matter which candidate the party was for. On eampus, however, the students were hushed and pensive. The office is tense as the night wears on. Only time will tell whieh side prevails. These reporters say, may the best candidate win.

British vote to ban child spanking 
LONDON -After a passionate debate in the House of Commons, British lawmakers voted overwhelmingly Tuesday against ban­ning parents from spanking their children. 
Some lawmakers argued that even mild spanking should be outlawed and insisted children should have the same legal protec­tion as adults when it comes to being hit. 
But Prime Minister Tony Blair's govern­ment has shied away from an outright ban, fearing it will be accused of intruding into family affairs. Instead, ministers urged law­makers to back legislation that would allow mild smacking but make it easier to prose­cute parents who harm a child physically or mnntally. 
Lawmakers voted by 424-75 against an outright ban. Thny will vote later on the gov­ernment proposal. 
Kuwait sex-change woman struggles 
KUWAIT CITY -Iter father and brothers beat her. The government suspended her from her job. A group of Muslim fundamen­talists screamed abuse at her outside a courtroom. 
Ilcr crime: She was born a boy named Ahmed, and is now a tall, 29-year-old blonde who calls herself Amal-Hope. 
An overseas sex-change operation has done little to help Amal's struggle for official recognition as a woman in conservative Kuwait. One court ruled for her, another overturned it and now she is going to the Court of Cassation, her last avenue of appeal. 
"People see me as a comic case," said Amal. "I wish they could look at me as a human being, someone who was born with a disease."

ClAYWN, N.C.-A woman apparently upset about the firing of a friend took five people hostage Tuesday at a Caterpillar factory before gradually releasing them and surrendering. 
No one was injured during the two-hour inci­dent at the construction-equipment plant south­east of Raleigh. 
The woman appeared to be holding a shotgun and claimed she had explosives on her body when she walked into the plant's lobby in mid­afternoon, said Johnston County Sheriff Steve Bizzell. 
"Apparently, she is an acquaintance or friend of an employee terminated recently"and was "demanding answers," Bizzell said. He described the woman as "irate about the treat­ment that her friend got."

Car bombs kill12 Iraqis in Baghdad 
Violence continues as pressure mounts on Allawi against attacking Fallujah 
Associated Press 
BAGHDAD, Iraq -Car bombs killed at least a dozen people in Baghdad and another major city Tuesday as pressure mount­ed on interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi to avert a full-scale U.S. attack on the insurgent stronghold Fallujah. 
There was no word on an American and two other for­eigners abducted Monday night in Baghdad, although the kidnappers freed two Iraqi guards also captured in the bold attack. Some diplomats speculated the foreigners may have been seized to pressure the Americans against a Fallujah attack. 
In northern Iraq on Tuesday, saboteurs blew up an oil pipeline and attacked an oil well, violence that is expected to stop oil exports for the next 10 days, Iraqi oil officials said. Iraq's oil industry, which provides desperately needed money for reconstruction efforts, has been the target of repeated attacks by insur­gents.

FedEx CEO speaks about ethics 

By PETER LEAHY News Writer 
FedEx chief executive officer Alan B. Graf, Jr. discussed and applied business ethies to his eom­pany H.'i well as other U.S. eompa­nies in his leeture "Building a Culture of Ethics," Tuesday. The nxo1:utive vien prnsident of FedEx Corporation said FedEx has always strnssnd honesty and that nthical business op1~rations are an integral part of' FedEx procedure. 
In 1979, Fnderal Express, as it was 1:alled ttum. did $300 million in salm;. This yp,ar Graf predicted sales would be at around $28 bil­lion. The company does over (J million shipments a day and employs over 245,000 people, Gral' said. The eompany is broken down into live main branches -FedEx Ground, FedEx Express, FedEx Freight, FedEx Kinko's and FedEx Supply Chain Serviens. Each of the branches ha'i a unique function. 
The largest of the branches is FedEx Express, which has il'i own fleet of airplanes. 
"The fleet is the second largest fleet of commercial airplanes in the world," Graf said. 
Although this may not be sur­prising for a company the size of FedEx, the union with Kinko's may be. (;rar said why a shipping com­pany lik1~ FedEx would join with a printing company like Kinko's.

If the finish is that tight, Kerry stands to benefit, said juniors and Democrats Alexandra Pennington of Louisiana and Sheena Bowman of New York. 
Pennington pointed out that the Democratic senator has been a strong eloscr throughout his political career. 
"He's weak at the begin­ning ... but usually comes from behind at the last minute," she said.

"I low would you like to grade your own exam?" Graf asked. He followed with a more appealing question. "llow would you like to write the questions'? I get to do this every day." 
Graf also emphasized that busi­ness cannot funetion without pub­lic trust -a trust that Graf believes is declining because of scandals such as Enron. 
While strongly against fraud and dishonesty, Graf acknowledged that many times in business there is a gray area in which definite rules do not govern practices. 
"Hardly anything is black and white in your business career," Grafsaid. 
In situations in which gray areas arise, Gra.f recommended asking questions. Graf said judgment is important in the business world. 
"So many times you hear of someone doing something against their best judgment," Graf said. "Always use your best judgment." 
Graf pointed to Enron once more to emphasize the conse­quences of what he called "cutting corners" or "taking shortcuts." These terms are synonymous and encompass unethical business procedures such as faulty account­ing practices and tax fraud, Graf said. 
"Don't take the shortcut, you will not see [it's consequences] the first time, but the 25th time you will feel it," Graf said. "[Unethical behavior] is not worth it." 
To conclude the lecture, Graf illustrated how FedEx strives for honesty and cited the mission statement as exemplary of this goal. He explained how an inter­nal audit committee that answers directly to the Board of Directors is able to overview his fmancial deci­sions as well as the actions of everyone involved in the compa­ny's finances.

IN BRIEF 
America Online to cut 700 jobs 
NEW YORK -America Online, which has been trying to turn its fortunes around as users leave the service for broadband connec­tions, plans to cut about 700 jobs next month, or 5 percent of its U.S. work force, in a bid to meet financial targets, a person familiar with the matter said Tuesday. 
The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the job cuts would occur mainly in northern Virginia, where the online service is based. News of the cuts was report­ed earlier in The Washington Post. 
Jim Whitney, an AOL spokesman, declined to comment. 
Word of the job cuts came one day before AOL's parent company. the giant media con­glomerate Time Warner Inc., reports earnings for its third quarter. AOL is expected to be a key topic for investors, including its efforts to seek new kinds of revenues as its dial-up users migrate to high-speed Internet connec­tions. 
lansing to leave Paramount Pictures 
LOS ANGELES -Sherry Lansing, the one­time model and actress who broke down bar­riers for women in the movie industry as one of Hollywood's most powerful studio chiefs, said Tuesday she will leave her post as chair­woman of Paramount Pictures at the end of next year when her contract expires. 
At Paramount, Lansing was a key player in the Oscar-winning blockbusters "Titanic," "Braveheart" and "Saving Private Ryan." But the studio has seen a string of flops and box office disappointments in recent years, includ­ing "The Stepford Wives." 
''I'll have been in this job for 12 years and have had the opportunity and the privilege to work with the very best the entertainment industry has to offer," the 60-year-old Lansing said in a statement. "But now it is time for new challenges." 
I Ier announcement follows several manage­ment shake-ups at parent company Viacom Inc., including the departure of Jonathan Dolgen, who had shared power with Lansing at Paramount. 
A. Zahner Co.'s reputation grows 
Kansas City company internationally renowned for architectural metal work 
Associated Press 
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -It's unlikely that people driving by A. Zahner Co.'s head­quarters would imagine the creative work going on inside the nondescript buildings. 
A passer-by might notice different-sized, multicol­ored sheet metal with unusual designs stacked near the business, without realizing that many of those ~heets are destined tG become part of butJdings, museums and artwork around the world. 
In the last 15 yeats, Bill Zahner has made the com­pany founded by his great­grandfather in 1897 into a recognized leader in using metals in complex architec­tural or artistic projects . 
A. Zahner's reputation has grown partly because it is the company that archi­tect Frank Gehry usually depends on to determine how to color metal and make it bend to his adven­turous and challenging designs. It was A. Zahner that installed the stainless steel "skins" covering Gehry's Weisman Museum in Minneapolis and the Experience Music Project in Seattle.

Nevv cancer treahnent announced 
Procedure attacks dangerous tumors directly, bypassing healthy cells 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Texas researchers say they have perfected a method to deliver cancer treatment directly into tumors, bypassing healthy tissue. 
The study was done on mice, but human trials could begin soon, said Dr. Michael Andreeff, one author of the study in Wednesday's issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. 
The research team used the benefits of a known anti­cancer therapy, interferon beta, that can kill cancer cells. In practice, that thera­py has proven problematic. It causes toxic side effects and its benefits disappear within minutes of patients getting their shots. 
The research team worked around those problems by manipulating a certain type of stem cells to encode the interferon beta gene. The stem cells then move like guided missiles, targeting tumor cells and producing high concentrations of thera­peutic proteins within the tumor cells, Andreeff said. 
Besides taming toxic side effects, the cancer treatment stuck around in the tumor longer, he said in an inter­view. 
Mice with human breast cancer treated with the engi­neered human stem cells survived for 60 days, accord­ing to the JNCI paper. Mice treated with interferon beta alone lived for 41 days. Untreated mice survived for 37 days. Meanwhile, mice with melanoma treated with the stem cells survived 73.5 days, compared with 30 days for untreated mice. 
Andreeff said he's working on a protocol for a clinical trial to test the procedure in humans within a year, if the Food and Drug Administration agrees. Patients would be infused with the stem­cell-delivered 
Even though they're tumors, the malignant cells act just like "never-healing wounds," Andreeff said. Half the tumor is made up of stomal cells that provide structural support. For the body, forming that tumor support structure is much like healing wounds and forming scars. 
Enter the specialized stem cells. Giving them the clues they need to take on the con­struction duties of stomal cells delivers the cancer-busting ability directly to

The targeted delivery of anticancer therapy to tumors builds on what researchers already know about how wounds heal.

But because the stem cells are driven by a duty to help, that means a wound else­where in the body could dis­tract some from reaching tumors. 
"Any wound that's active, that requires repair, would be a target," Andreeff acknowledged. That means doctors would need to screen patients carefully to ensure the therapy is not attempted on people who had under­gone recent surgery, for example. 
Tobacco cotnpany wins key federal court appeal 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -A federal appeals court sided Tuesday with a tobacco company that is trying to keep a potentially damaging memo out of the 
U.S. government's $280 billion lawsuit against cigarette mak­ers. 
The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler erred when she said British American Tobacco PLC must produce the memo because the company .had, in effect, waived the right to protect the document under the claim of attorney-client privilege. 
The appellate ruling means BATCo. can continue to claim the document as privileged and try to keep it out of the massive civil racketeering case. However, the govern­ment can still challenge the claim in the lower court, where the trial is continuing. 
Justice Department lawyers have been seeking the 1990 memo for two years, believing it could strengthen their argu­ment that tobacco companies committed fraud by lying about the dangers of smoking and hiding that information from the public. 
Kessler, who is presiding over the trial, previously ruled that BATCo. had waived its right to attorney-client privi­lege by failing to list the memo on an initial document it gave Justice Department lawyers about items it was withholding on grounds the material was privileged. 
The three-judge appeals panel said the company's rea­sons for not handing over the memo were weak but said 
· waiving attorney-client privi­lege was too serious a sanction for Kessler to have imposed. 
The appellate justices also disagreed with Kessler's view that once government lawyers learned about the memo and sought it, the tobacco company neither produced it nor out­lined objections in a timely fashion. 
The memo by London-based lawyer Andrew Foyle advises an Australian subsidiary of BATCo. on whether the com­pany should keep or destroy internal paperwork in light of increasing litigation. 
Government lawyers haven't seen the sealed memo but know much of the contents because an Australian appeals court decision two years ago quoted the memo. 
British American Tobacco owns Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., which recently merged with R.J. Reynolds. The new company, Reynolds American Inc., is the second­largest cigarette maker in the United States behind Philip Morris USA.

Well, at least now I know why plas­tic cups come in red and blue. Pick your color, and proclaim your candi­date. At almost 11:30 p.m. on Nov. 2, I certainly didn't know much else about the results of the presidential eleetion. Katie Boyle If only the election 
coverage could be For M'hat It's more like the Oscars. Worth I like key moments to be nieely staggered throughout my evening. Trot out the Iowa results around eight, shake things up a little with Ohio at 10. But apparently national elections haven't been designed for my entertainment. 
Despite this obvious flaw, political science aficionado (or nerd) that I am, I knew I'd be glued to the television set for the rest of the night. I needed plenty of time to pack my bags for my permanent vacation in Canada should George W. Bush manage to pull this off. 
Hegardless of political affiliation, however, I am impressed with the Notre Dame student body's interest in this eleetion. Even my friend Brian's 20 first birthday party today was themed, complete with an Electoral College drinking game. You can't ask for more dedication than the inclusion of two aging politicians in your rite of passage. 
The student body, like the country, is

practically evenly divided. I'd like to point out the (very) obvious. Parietals are antiquated. And, of course, that no matter who won this election, a lot of people were going to be very unhappy. Partieularly Halph Nader, but who's listening to him now any­way? 
Hegardless of whether Sen. John Kerry or Bush won the election, it is important that the enthusiasm gener­ated among the younger seetor of the population remains strong. Even if your party hasn't gained the White House, individuals are still able to have an ineredible impact on politics, particularly in the local arena. Campaigns sueh as 'Hoek the Vote' and P. Diddy's 'Vote or Die' slogan, have increased awareness among new voters. 
Thanks to the closeness of this elec­tion, it's certainly been a nerve­wracking evening for me. On another level, however, this phenomenon has forced politicians to court not only the undecided voter, but the possible voter. The increased turn out and awareness of issues this year has been a positive for our eountry, even though it may not have resulted in a win fbr John Kerry. 
Unfortunately, it seems that political parties needed the impetus of this elose raee to launch get out the vote campaigns. So is it now the closer the

race, the greater the importance of eaeh voter? If you want to matter more, hope for a dead heat. Or that, like my roommate, you hail !'rum Ohio. 
A truly dedicated politician should strive to increase voter education and awareness aeross the nation regard­less of its importanee to their own eleetion. When I was younger, I used to think everyone should have to take a written exam on the issues before they could vote. Now I understand the impracticality, not to mention the elit­ism, of this plan, but I still maintain the sentiment behind it. 
Citizens should know not just for whom, but also for what they are vot­ing. People should research nvery candidate, rather than voting a straight party line. And politicians have a responsibility to their con­stituents to encourage voting in their communities, and to pronounce nuclear correctly. . ' ot,i 
In the end, all I ean say is if GeorgP

A day in the life of the American Democracy 
A cold and broken Hallelujah 
Today was indeed an interesting day. Reflecting badly timed midterm, and a two-page paper for back on the progress our nation has made in the ·another class. I didn't really want to wake up this 
past few months is truly inspiring. The story of today really began for me on the morning of Sept. 11. On that morning our generation of Americans was called to action. Our destinies had changed from that of lazy post-Tom Rippinger materialistic MTV watching spoiled brats to a calling similar to that of 
Confessions of 
our forefathers who fought and a Campus died in the worldwide struggles Conservative against tyranny and communism. 
The very legitimacy of our exis­tence as a nation has been called into question by radical Islamic militants opposed to the worldwide advancement of the principles of liberty. Our genera­tion has risen to the call in ways worthy of the American heritage. On the other side of the globe, brave young men and women of my generation are fighting and dying for the advancement of freedom in distant lands. 
Closer to home, our generation is doing what it can to continue the advancement of freedom. Over the past few months, we have had a spirited dialogue with our liberal counterparts debating the election. Both Democrats and Republicans are volunteering, voting, and actively voicing their opinion in the media from weblogs to national television. Although we've had our disagreements, they are fiercely fought in our media as opposed to fists. If anything can be learned from these past few vicious months, it is that a nation can fiercely disagree without resorting to violence. I feel that is the best example we can set for the rest of the world. 
The past few weeks have been hectic to say the least. On the whole political contribution can seem frustratingly minimal. I would make it through three pages of voters in a phone bank on a given night. A person in our club may knock on 100 doors in an afternoon. Today, I waited 45 minutes in line to cast one vote. All off these days add up and culminate into days like today where time seems to move at a near standstill. 
Today started out like any other day dealing with a morning, nor did I wish to do much of anything. I managed to make it through my midterm today, although my mind was definitely not on Medieval Politics. Townie that I am, my brother and I managed to make it out to Granger to vote in today's election. 
Wearing my Notre Dame Fighting Hepublicans T-shirt to the polls, I ran into Democratic challenger for the Indiana 2nd District seat Joe Donnelly outside my designated voting place. His family being long-time friends of ours, I sheepishly man­aged a h(;lllo and a handshake as I walked into the polls. I felt good in the fact that he could shake my hand and avoid making politics personal in the oldest tradition of American democracy. 
After voting, I promptly called the campaign manag­er for Congressman Chris Chocola, who ran for the 2nd District seat, to see if I could help wrap up the phone banks. However, I was shocked and pleas­antly surprised to hear hundreds of volunteers called every likely Republican voter in the district twice this morning. From there, all that was left after months of work was watching and waiting. 
Tuesday night at the Marriott, the officers of the College Republicans and I did just that. In the grand old tradition of the stereotypical Republican, Ian Ronderos and I took a break to smoke cigars in the 
lounge while watching the election results come in. 
After enjoying our cigars, we joined the victory rally 
upstairs after the race was called for both Congressman Chocola and Mitch Daniels for governor of Indiana. As I write this, we are currently ahead, pending the assault of the Democratic lawyers. For now, I'm enjoying the hard­work paid off in both local campaigns. Back over at 
home sweet home Castle Point, I'm cur­rently in an apart­ment with 20 other Bush enthusiasts watching the results of this election. I've resigned myself to accept victory or defeat. As they say, "it's not over till it's over." This election 
should be praised 
as a high point in 
American political activism either way. 

Resigning with you now to watch how the rest oJ this American drama plays out, I feel confident in the fact that events like Sept. 11 will never destroy our nation's greatest strengths of political activism and strong civil society.

It can be said that the greatest human sorrow lies in discovering that you have been betrayed. If this is indeed true, then perhaps there is nothing comparable to discovering that 
you have been  
betrayed by your own  Lance Gallop  
religion. Yet, thi"s is  
the accusation that I must lay down today:  The Third Way  
the Catholic Church  

has, through action and inaction, betrayed its gay and lesbian members -and through them all people. And far worse, the Catholic Church has betrayed the very heart of its own teachings. 
I want to disabuse people of the notion that Christianity is anti-gay. This is so far from the truth that it borders on ridiculous, and those Christians who are anti-gay in the name of God seem no less than blasphemers, for Christianity contains within it the seeds of a strong pro-gay theology, the likes of which has not been seen. No, it is only Christians -and I thank God not all Christians -who are anti-gay, not Christianity. 
But before you pull out your Catechism and start transcribing a Viewpoint, let me make it quite clear what I am not saying. I am not reject­ing the Church's position on sexual union, or its whole and complete role within human nature as the source of children. I could not do that and still call myself a Catholic. 
Rather, I am rejecting the destructive attitudes that have arisen within the Church about the meaning of being gay, and what arises from this character. I reject them, because these attitudes of the Church have become contrary to the teachings of the Church, and of late some of her documents and actions fly in the face of the Rule of Faith and the law written on the human heart. 
The prevalent mind-set has its official origin in a 1986 document by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. Its proclaims, among other things, that being gay is an "objective disorder," a condition from which noth­ing good can arise. (For what it is worth, the same Congregation has endeavored to stamp out the use of female alter servers, and considers it seriously improper to hold hands while reciting the Lord's Prayer during Mass.) Barring pastoral documents and recent dectarations -mostly about marriage -this is all that the Church formally has to say about being gay; precious lit­tle for such a complicated topic, almost nothing by its usual standards. 
And this single principle, as it is com­monly understood, is brazenly flawed. It leads directly to indefensible conse­quences that exist in violation of the Rule of Faith and the principles of the Natural Law. Namely, it encourages at best a sort of apathetic internal rejec­tion of one's self, and at worst it leads to unchecked self-loathing. It is implic­itly a "stay-in-the-closet" closet sort of principle, and it lends justification to those who would reject a social role for gays as anything but pariahs. It makes no distinction between innocent love and post-modernistic lust or between different types of attraction. It closes the door to any sort of positive inter­pretation of what it means to be gay, and it denies gays their human birthright of self-love, respect and dig­nity. 
It has been my belief for a very long time that the true principles of revulsion, which lies hidden within the Christianity lay within the person of theology of the Church and within the Christ, not within naked moral law, and personhood of Christ. And while the that without understanding the lmman­attitude of the Church -or more ure­ity of Christ, the law has no value. If cisely some of her leaders -is that of there is any grain of truth in what the the former, the teachings of the Church CDF ·says, it is so distant from point toward the later. the principles found in the Within a framework of fun­
person of Christ that it has lost all meaning, and now is capable of pro­voking only hatred and lies. 
And yet for the sake of the base­less attitude fed by this principle, the Church is bleed­ing gay and les­bian members who cannot tol­erate this rejec­tion. For the sake 

/

of a baseless atti­tude the Church has lost the opportunity to redefine what is means to be gay, presenting a model of a gay Catholic life that is secure, open, loving and true. Instead its model of gay life is a 

gray mess of discord, misun­
poems by Walt Whitman. The 
derstanding, and human coldness. And so I hold the Church accountable for it attitude and all the wrong that has come from it. 
There is a universe of difference between a general revulsion with limit­ed tolerance and a general acceptance with a few restrictions. It is my heart­felt belief that it is acceptance, not 
damental acceptance everything changes. Some of the more acidic critiques peo­ple have had over the position of gays at the University 
start to look embarrassing. The recognition 
that gay students have been seek­ing for years starts to look basic and unde­niable. It is an 
attitude that pushes us all for­ward, bound with the principle of love that is so des­perately needed.

The Unicorns bring indie rock to campus 
Popular indie band brings students out to LaFortune Ballroom for a concert with a little bit ofeverything 
By LAUREN WENDEL 

Scene Writer 
It is not an everyday occurrence 

that music fans come across a pop­
rock band as unique and innovative 
as the Unicorns. The current indie 
music scene is saturated with up­
and-coming artists; but not all of 
these new artists have as mueh tal­
ent or eomedic relief as the 
Unicorns. WVFI, Notre Dame's rock­
ing radio station, provided the 
opportunity for the hipsters of South 
Bend to unite under the lights of 
LaFortune Ballroom, for the simple 
purpose of hearing a great new 
band and having fun. 
This Montreal triplet of Nick (Neil) Diamonds, Alden Ginger and drum­mer Jaime Tambour have toured the world with Ben Kweller and Hot Hot Heat in the past and are about to embark on a European tour with The Decembrists next month. Their second album "Who Will Cut Our .Hair When We're Gone" (Alien8 recordings, Nov. 2003) received mixed reviews, but the band has enjoyed somewhat of a cult follow­
ing among the indie music scene. 
Their formless eompositions, outer­
worldly sound effects and off-the­
wall lyrics could have spelled disas­
ter. However the Unicorns were able 
to take their brand of well­
rehearsed improvisations, add a 
sense of humor and create a sound 
that was alive. They successfully 
stray from the traditional verse/cho­
rus/verse formula of most pop rock 
acts and infuse a new energy and 
comfort level to elitist rock. 
The show began with a unique mixing of heavy bass, mechanical drums and a variety of sound effects. In between the machine guns and sirens coming from the keyboard, singers Diamonds and Ginger would trade off singing near­ly incomprehensible lyrics. If there was a downfall of the show, it would be the acoustics of the location. The vocals were largely drowned out by the heavy guitars and snare beats, but at the same time large Corinthian columns are not usually well suited for a rock venue. 
The band picked up its energy throughout the show, flowing with the enthusiastic crowd. Diamonds and Ginger would trade off instru­ments throughout the set and jumped from microphone to micro­phone, which kept the show fresh and fun. Both are skilled at playing the bass, keyboard, electric and acoustic guitars, which was highly evident from the smooth chord pro­gressions and hooks in many songs. 
Often times the songs' tempos would change mid-song~ adding spontaneity to the set. The Unicorns would begin a song with a heavy electronic background, move into a more hardcore punk guitar, but then finish with a poppy beat (as in their song "Les OS"). This effortless blend of eclectic styles is not something many groups accomplish successful­ly, but the Unicorns seem to have discovered the secret formula. 
"Jellybones," one of the groups more recognizable songs, was a crowd pleaser. Some of the more enthusiastic crowd members writhed and bounced in-sync with 
the beats, which the band fed off of and answered back with even more rocking. Ginger, by far one of the most talented musicians to see live, gave nothing less than 120 percent to his set. lie jumped and lunged around on stage, at one point even holding up his bass mid-air to play. Ilis curly hair shaped in a mohawk only made him more appealing, in a retro punk rocker way. 
Diamonds did not disappoint either. His lively and random banter with the crowd nicely displayed the bands off-beai sense of humor. To his dismay, the crowd convinced him that indeed Notre Dame is not the "college Jesus went to" and a specif­ic dean is not God. 
Thanks to the low key and random lighting display, Diamonds compared the show more to a middle-school dance, awkward moments not included. He also brought out two mascots to the show, a teddy bear dressed in camouflage that played a patriotic country song and a kitty cat with a cowboy hat. If mascots don't impress you enough to check out this energetic and fun band live, then maybe lyrics from their most popular song "I was born [A Unicorn]" might: "I was born a uni­corn I I coulda sworn you believed in me I then how come all the other unicorns are dead?" If the show is any indication of the existence of unicorns, they are alive, just in the form of one rocking hipster Canadian band.

Witty "Fortinbras" promises political humor Department of film, television and theatre presents the humorus sequel to "Hamlet" 
By MICHELE JEFFERS 
Scene Writer 

You've all read the play in high school, seen it parodied countless times and ana­lyzed to death the soliloquies of·what is arguably literature's most complex charac­ter. But now it is time for some ballyhoo with the bard in "Fortinbras," a contempo­rary and comedic sequel to Hamlet written by playwright Lee Blessing. Produced by the film, theatre and television depart­ment, :Fortinbras" kicks off the PAC's Fall Art fest-Shakespeare in Performance. Directed by Jay Skelton, a visiting profes­sor of acting and directing from Chicago, "Fortinbras" features a cast of students who auditioned early on in the semester. 
Essentially, the play begins at the end of "Hamlet" with a dying Hamlet pleading Horatio to tell his tale. Before his body is even cold, however, the Norwegian prince, Fortinbras, swaggers in with Machiavellian buoyancy, and he quickly assumes the throne at Ellsinore. Claiming that the actu­al story of how the two families died is too outlandish. 
Fortinbras beseeches the aid of Horatio and the hilarious sycophant Osrich to spread his own fabricated version of the truth. Fortinbras' "un-noble lie," however, draws the attention of the ghosts of "Hamlet's" principal characters. Their trademark characteristics become the sub­jec:;t of comedy as they exhibit the opposite or ironic qualities of what they did in life. As specters, for example, the garrulous Polonius is too afraid to speak at all, while the passive Ophelia turns into a brassy seductress. Hamlet, on the other hand, is regulated to a television-a fitting conse­quence of his prior hesitation to act. Fortinbras' character is jilted through the warnings, advice and even sexual encoun­ters with the ghosts. Director Jay Skelton sees Fortinbras' character as the opposite of Hamlet's, "Whereas Hamlet was a char­acter of conscience who was led to action, Fortinbras is a character of action who is led to his conscience." 
"Fortinbras" is extremely entertaining as a parody of one of literature's most highly regarded plays, but it is an elevated to a higher level through its implicit commen­tary on contemporary politics. The portray­al of Fortinbras is comedic, yet pointed, because his actions highlight the political repercussions that can occur when a new political leader makes uneducated and brash decisions in a tenebrous situation. 
"Fortinbras" is extremely witty and is sure to be enjoyed by all regardless if you loved, hated, or never read "Hamlet." The cast delivers great acting, and it is obvious that the actors have taken great lengths to bring out the characters' laughable nuances. According to Skelton, those who come see it will "have a good time and walk out of the theater with a smile on their face." "Fortinbras" premieres tonight at the Philbin Studio Theatre in the Marie 
P. Debartolo Center for the Performing Arts with shows running through Nov. 13. Contact the ticket office at (574) 631-2800 to purchase your tickets.

Capers, Texans getting it right after rough start 

Associated Press 
HOUSTON -A lot happened to Dom Capers in the six years between his ambitious start with the expansion Carolina Panthers and the renewal of his head-coaching career with the expansion Houston Texans. 
Capers fed the Panthers with­in one win of the Super Bowl in 1996, was fired two years later, rebuilt his reputation as a defensive coordinator with Jacksonville and got another ­perhaps his final -chance to be a head coach in Houston. 
Capers is getting it right this time-with a lot of help. 
The Texans ( 4-3} have won four of their laf?t five, climbing above .500 for the first time in franchise history this late in a season. After dominating Jacksonville on Sunday, Houston moved into a second-place tie in the AFC South to confirm its sta­tus as a playoff contender. 
Starved for pro footb<Lll after Bud Adams took the Oilers to Tennessee in 1996, Houston has fallen hard for Capers, owner Bob McNair and the team despite its early struggles. 
McNair has quickly become one of the NFL's power brokers, ereating a buzz in the city and throughout the league that is fit­ting for the founder of one of the world's largest privately owned energy companies. 
He easily finessed the city into building the stadium -magnifi­cent 71,054-seat Reliant Stadium -that Adams always wanted; convinced the NFL to bring the Super Bowl to Houston last January, and did such a good job hosting the game that the league intends to return; and, most importantly to fans, put the right people in charge of the football team. 
Though the on-field product has been slow to come around, McNair remained steadfast in his demand for a roster full of' guys who rarely show up on a police blotter and arc charitable to the media, fans and commu­nity. 
So far, McNair has made all the moves Carolina and plenty other expansion team owners should have made from the very start. 
No one knows that better than Capers. 
Dating back to the Dallas Cowboys in 1960, no modern expansion team in the NFL won more games in its first two sea­sons than the Panthers built by Capers, then-GM Bill Polian and owner Jerry Hichardson. 
Carolina achieved success so quickly by loading up on estab­lished veterans, a plan that set up the Panthers for a quick downfall. The Panthers went 12-4 in 1996, won a playoff' game and seemed poise for another strong season with sec­ond-year quarterback -and the franchise's first-ever draft piek -Kerry Collins leading the way. 
But Carolina got old too quick­ly, Collins struggled with an alcohol problem and the Panthers didn't have nearly enough young talent to remain a contender. Carolina's draft chokes during that stretch read like a who's who of' lirst-round busts: Tim Biakabutuka in 1996, Rae Carruth in 1997 and Jason Petf)r in 1998. 
"What ended up happening is that we had a lot of veteran players on our team that really gave us good production the first two years," Capers said. "We weren't able to replace some of those veteran players, so it kind of worked against us. When the expectation level went up, we weren't quite as good and we startP-d to descend." 
Did they ever. 

The Panthers dropped to 4-12 in Capers' fourth season, his fast in Charlotte. He spent the next two years as a defensive coordi­nator in Jacksonville, and won­dered if he'd got another chance to lead a team.

Martin, Jordan power Jets to 6-1 start, tops in AFC 

Associated Press 

HEMPSTEAD, N.Y.-For the first six games of the season, Curtis Martin single-handedly shouldered the running burden for the New York Jets. 
Martin hardly ever took a break in games, while his sel­dom-used backup fidgeted impa­tiently on the sideline. LaMont Jordan envisioned a bigger role for himself this year, but quickly landed in the doghouse during training camp because of his bad attitude. 
So while Martin took a pound­ing, Jordan stood idle. That all changed in a 41-14 blowout win over the Miami Dolphins on Monday night. Martin and Jordan each went over 100 yards, help­ing the Jets to 275 yards rushing, tops in the NFL this season. 
Their outburst helped get the Jets off and running to their best game of the season. Now they are 6-1, tied atop the AFC with Pittsburgh and New England. 
What's more, the blowout vic­tory came on national television following a close loss to the Patriots. 
"People that hadn't watched us a whole lot probably think these guys are pretty good," coach Herman Edwards said Tuesday. 



"As a football team we knew all 
along we won some games but 
hadn't played all together. That 
came out last night. Now the 
whole key is can we continue to 
do that?" 
History says they can. Edwards 
has a near-perfect record in November, going 10-2 since he arrived in 2001. His .833 winning percentage is the best among coaches with at least 10 ·November games since the start 
of the Super Bowl era. 
The schedule does not get 
much harder this month. The 
Jets play at Buffalo (2-5) this 
Sunday, followed by games 
against Baltimore (4-3), 
Cleveland (3-4) and Arizona (2­
5). 
"We know the month of 
November is important. It's 
always been important around 
here for us," Edwards said. "It's 
what I call moving month. You 
start slotting yourself, where 
you're trying to go. Win as many 
games as you possibly can in 
November because December 
takes care of itself. That's how 
you play it in this league." 
Having two valuable backs also 
helps. The last time the Jets had 
two 100-yard runners in the 
same game was 1975. Martin 
had 19 carries for 115 yards and

left the game as a precaution with a bruised knee in the third quarter. The Jets kept going with Jordan, who had career highs with 14 carries for 115 yards. 
Each back had a 25-yard score, Helping embarrass the proud Miami defense. The 31-year-old Martin now is third in the league with 798 yards rushing, and the Jets rank second in rushing, averaging 152.7 yards. 
Coming into the game, Jordan had six carries. The sometimes disgruntled back becomes a free agent at the end of the season, but he will be needed to help spell Martin as the Jets keep ­making their playoff push. 
Jordan provides a nice change of pace to Martin, a smaller back who needs a few carries to get going. The 230-pound Jordan gets going immediately, bowling over would-be tacklers with nearly ever carry. 
"It just shows what kind of character I have, to go through everything I went through this offseason, to bounce back and have a game like I did," Jordan said after the game. "It meant a lot to me to ask for the ball the way I was asking for it and then when I got my opportunities, tak­ing advantage of them the way I did." 
on an otherwise bleak defen­sive day. 
"He played about 35 plays and did pretty well," coach Tony Dungy said. 
Sanders has waited nearly 10 months to hear those words. 
The Colts made him their top draft choice in April, trading down and selecting him in the second round with the 44th overall pick even though he was hurt. 
During his senior season at Iowa, Sanders had surgery for a stress fracture in his right foot. He did not practice during the team's offseason workouts. That was followed by a month­long holdout -the longest of any draft pick this year. 
When Doss injured his groin during the third quarter Sunday, Sanders finally got a chance to prove himself. If Doss can't play Monday night, Dungy said Sanders likely would make his first NFL start. 
-

And Sanders promises to be ready. 
"''m looking forward to the challenge," he said. "I want to make sure I'm prepared, and I've been here long enough to know what's going on." 
The Colts (4-3) are hoping this could be deja vu. 
In 2002, their top draft pick, defensive end Dwight Freeney, didn't start until Week 8 and quickly made an impact. He finished with 47 tackles, a team-record 13 sacks, nine forced fumbles and one fumble recovery. 
Dungy is not making any comparisons yet. 
But if Sanders cari stay healthy and play like he did Sunday, he could become a stabilizing presence in the Colts' injury-depleted second­ary.

AUBUHN IIILLS, Mich. _ Yao and T-Mac experi­enced what Shaq and Kobe did.The defending NBA champion Detroit Pistons arc a tough match for any dynamic duo. 
Hasheed Wallace, one of five Pistons to score in dou­ble figures, had 24 points to help Detroit defeat the Houston Hockets 87-79 Tuesday night in the first game of the NBA season. 
"A lot of people arc still doubting us, so I guess we just have to go win it all again," Wallace said. 
Tracy McGrady and Yao Ming, playing their first regular-season game together, found out what Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal did during their final five games together with the Los Angeles Lakers: The Pistons, relent­less on defense and well­balanced on offense, are diflicult to beat. 
"When you have one or two guys, we've got five coming at you," Richard Hamilton said. "That's tough." 
McGrady missed 12 of 18 shots and finished with 18 points after scoring just three during the first half. Yao had just seven points on 2-of-9 shooting. 
"They play 'D'. That's 
why they won a champi­onship," McGrady said. "They did a great job of picking up the intensity in the second half, and they hit shots in the fourth." 
Detroit's entire starting lineup from last season is back, and all five players scored at least 10. Aside from Hasheed Wallace's big night on 1 0-of-19 shooting, Chauncey Billups had 17, Hamilton scored 15, Ben Wallace had 15 points, 10 rebounds and three blocks. 
Tayshaun Prince scored 10 while smothering McGrady defensively much like he did against Bryant during the NBA Finals. 
"It's very similar to 
guarding Kobe," Prince said. "I just had to use my length." 
The Hockets shot just 39 percent. Charlie Ward had 13 points, Maurice Taylor had 12 and Jim Jackson added 10. 
"We aren't able to consis­tently attack on offense," Yao said. 
Hasheed Wallace, Billups and Prince made 3-point­
~rs early in the fourth quarter to cap a 13-2 run, putting the Pistons ahead 68-61. Arter Detroit's stingy defense forced a shot-dock violation mid­way through the fourth . Ben Wallace's tip-jam gave the Pistons a 76-66 lead.

Jeter, Wells vvin first Gold Gloves 
He took a three-week vacation from golf to celebrate honeymoon 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -Tiger Woods does not play golf with a ring on his finger. 
That was the answer to the first question about how things might be different in his first tournament as a married man. 
But the biggest change was more subtle. 
Woods began his pro-am round at the Tour Championship on the lOth tee. He usually is the first one off on the first tee, a perk he has been afforded the last five years. But the first tee was occupied Tuesday by Vijay 
Singh,  who  is  firmly  
entrenched at  No.  1 in the  
world.  

Then, Woods had to wait for Singh to finish his interview before he could step to the microphone. 
And once Woods finished talking about his three-week honeymoon on a 150-foot yacht in the Caribbean, he was bom­barded with questions about Singh -just like so many other players who for years grew weary talking about Woods. 
"He's played some just unbe­lievable golf this year," Woods said. "For him to play as much as he does and still maintain that edge, and as much as he practices, it's pretty impressive to do all that." 
Woods still has eight majors. He is the only professional to hold all four major champi­onship trophies at the same time. He has won more tourna­ments than anyone else still playing. 
But he now is just one of the 31 players at the Tour Championship trying to end his year on a good note. Children still ran after him for his auto­graph when he arrived at East

Lake. lie still had more people in his gallery than any other players. If television ratings go up this week, Woods will be the reason. 
Still, he now looks like one of the guys -and not just because he's married. 
"The fear factor is gone," one caddie said on the practice range as he watched Woods warm up. 
The last time Woods and Singh played together was out­­side Boston on Labor Day, when the 41-year-old Fijian won a thrilling back-nine duel in the Deutsche Bank Championship to end Woods' five-year reign at No. 1 in the world. 
Since then, Woods had a dis­astrous pairing with Phil Mickelson and another losing record in the Ryder Cup. He barely made it through 72 holes of the American Express Championship with a back injury. And he got married Oct. 5 in Barbados to Swedish nanny Elin Nordegren. 
And since becoming No. 1 in the world, Singh has won three times and was runner-up in his other PGA Tour start. 
It reminds Woods of the last time someone else was No. 1 in the world _ David Duval, who won 11 times in 18 months and became the first man to shoot 59 in the final round of a PGA Tour event. 
"Everybody has a run," Woods said. "I had one. Duval had one. Johnny Miller, (Jack) Nicklaus, (Tom) Watson,_ every­one has their run. It's just a matter of how long can you continue. Fortunately for me, I lasted five years." 
The question is how long Singh can keep this up -and whether Woods can come back. 
Woods had such a good time in the Caribbean that he skipped Disney for the first time since turning pro, and he nearly called it a year by not playing in the Tour Championship. 
Let's see -he's on a private yacht with his Swedish bride, with no one to bother him but the U.S. Coast Guard. Why even bother coming back for one tournament? 
"Trust me," Woods said with a big grin. "That thought went through my head a lot of times." 
Eventually, the honeymoon has to end. "I miss competing," Woods said. "That's what I love to do." He hasn't been shown much love in return. 
Woods' only victory this year is the Accenture Match Play Championship at La Costa at the end of February. His drought in the majors is 10 and counting. He is No. 3 in the world ranking, No. 4 on the money list. 
But even on the open sea, Woods still found room for golf. 
"When I was on the boat, I was actually thinking about my game quite a bit and organiz­ing my 'To Do' list -what causes what in the golf swing, and basically prioritizing what I needed to work on," Woods said. 
He thought his game was close before he got married. ..

NEW YORK -Derek Jeter's diving grab caught the atten­tion of all of baseball and per­haps earned him his first American League Gold Glove. 
The New York Yankees short­stop won the honor Tuesday, taking over from teammate Alex Rodriguez, who had won it two straight years before mov­ing to third base this year. 
In the 12th inning of a game against Boston on July 1, Jeter sprinted after Trot Nixon's pop down the left-field line with runners at second and third. He made the catch in fair territory, went sprawling into the crowd and was stopped by the hard­backed seats. lie was taken to a hospital with a bloodied chin, red-and-swollen cheek and bruised shoulder, and New York went on to win in the 13th inning. 
"I take pride in my defense, and I work hard each year to improve in the field," Jeter said in a statement issued by the Yankees. "There are a number of fantastic defensive shortstops in the American league -too many to count -and to be rec­ognized with the Gold Glove makes it that much more of a special accomplishment. I also want to thank our pitching staff for having so many of our opponents hit balls in my direc­tion." 
Some baseball analysts have said Jeter has less range than Rodriguez, Nomar Garciaparra and Miguel Tejada. 
"Derek Jeter is a great, inspired leader and captain," Yankees owner George Steinbrenner said in a state­ment. "He certainly deserves this honor." 
Toronto outfielder Vernon Wells also was a first-time win­ner. 
"My hope now for next year is to put together a complete sea­son when I might compete for both awards, the Gold Glove and Silver Slugger," Wells said. 
In his first season with Detroit, catcher Ivan Rodriguez won his 11th Gold Glove, his first since 2001 with Texas and the most for any catcher. Johnny Bench won the award 10 times. 
Rangers pitcher Kenny Rogers, who turns 40 on Nov. 10, won for the third time, the first since 2002. 
''I'm not the same guy I was in the years past," he said. "There's a lot of things physi­cally I could do that I can't do now," he said. 
Despite his age, Rogers had 65 total chances, third in the AL behind Jake Westbrook (76) and Mark Buehrle (71). 
"Shortstops and second base­men over the years have com­plained I go after balls that are hit right to them," Rogers said. 
Oakland third baseman Eric Chavez, Minnesota center field­er Torii Hunter and Seattle right fielder Ichiro Suzuki all won the award for the fourth straight season. Mariners sec­ond baseman Bret Boone won his third straight Gold Glove for the Mariners, his fourth overall, and Anaheim first baseman Darin Erstad won his third award, his first since 2002. 
Ivan Rodriguez and Erstad both earned $100,000 bonuses, while Boone, Chavez, Rogers, Suzuki and Wells each earned $50,000, and Hunter $25,000. The awards are sponsored by Rawlings. 
Gold Gloves, presented since 1957 by St. Louis-based Rawlings, are voted on by man­agers and coaches before the end of the regular season. They may not select players on their own teams, and they vote only for players in their own league.

Team finds success against ranked foes 
By ERIC RETTER Sports Writer 
The Irish ended the fall sea­son in a position all too familiar -in the middle of a strong field. 
The team finished tied for IOth out of 16 at the Prestigo at the P<;A Wesl. Notre Dame faced a strong field, including four teams ranked in the top 25, inducting No. 16 UCLA, who won the event. 
llowevnr, the Irish did not come away from the event unsuccessful. Sophomore Cole lsban, who has been arguably the loam's strongest member all season, finished second at the event. lsban shot a thrne­round total of 3-over-par 219 and finished two strokes behind Erik llill of UC-Davis, who rallied from two strokes behind lsban with a 69 in Ttwsday's final round. The run­ner-up trophy was the best lsban had ever earned in an event and was the third time the sophomore standout had finished in the top five since arriving at Notre Dame. 
Behind lbsan, junior Eric Deutsch and freshman Greg Hodgers ended the day tied for 49th place with a respective 


.. 

23-over-par 239. Deutsch rebounded from two consecu­tive over-80 scores by shooting a l-over-par 73 on Tuesday afternoon. 
Junior Scott Gustafson and freshman Mike King rounded out the Irish at the tournament. Gustafson scored a 26-over-par 242, and King finished one stroke behind with a 243. The pair finished tied for 57th and 61 st, respectively. 
With the fall season now coming to a close, the Irish now have a long winter to work on their games and prepare for the spring season.

Injury may sideline Orton 
Purdue quarterback unsure whether he will play on Saturday 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -Purdue quarterback and one-time Ileisman hopeful Kyle Orton is questionable for Saturday's game against Iowa with an injured lnft hip. 
Orton was injured in last week's 13-10 loss at Northwestern. lie was benched for backup Brandon Kirsch in the third quarter, partly becausn he was injured and part­ly bneauso ho was inea·eetive. 
Purdue coach Joe Tiller said Tuesday he is in no hurry to announce a starter for the game against Iowa. 
"We could hold it as long as game time," Tiller said. "We will delay the decision as long as pos­sible." 
Orton said Tuesday he was feel­ing much better than he did Saturday, and he thought he would be ready to go for the game in his home state. 
"You look at the progress I've made from Saturday until now, it's a lot bP.tter," he said. 
"If I can play and help the team, then I'm going to play through some pain. But I'm not going to be out there and hurting the team this week." 
It could be argued that Orton has done just that with his lack­luster play of late. Orton was just 15-for-33 for 143 yards, a touch­down and an interception last week against Northwestern. 
Over the last three games -all Purdue defeats -he has com­pleted just 50 percent of his pass­es for 591 yards, three touch­downs and three interceptions. 
It's a big change from the first five games of the season, when Purdue had its best start since 1945. 
In those five victories, Orton completed nearly 70 percent of his passes for 1,642 yards, 18 touchdowns and two intercep­tions. 
"It's been three rough weeks," Orton said. "It seems like every­thing's kind of falling apart a little bit." 
Once a media darling consid­ered thn front-runner for the Ileisman, Orton has found just how fickle the attention can be.

Willingham views the bye week as beneficial 
By HEATHER VAN HOEGARDEN Sports Editor 
Notre Dame is 23-2 all time coming ofT of a bye week during the regular season since 1984. Wins include the 1989 win over then-No. 1 Michigan, the 2003 win over then-No. 15 Pittsburgh and the 1999 win over then No. 23 Oklahoma. 
Irish coach Tyrone Willingham said the extra time serves a

more time to focus on that one opponent," Tyrone Willingham Willingham 
Irish coach 

said. "Whereas you may have only three or four days of preparation for most teams, and now you have a chance to gain two additional days. Depending on how you structure your plan, that helps. That's beneficial." 
Creating turnovers 
In the first four games, the Irish defense forced 16 turnovers, including six against Michigan State and five against Washington. 
In that span, the Irish were 3­
1. The last four games, in which Notre Dame is 2-2, the Irish have forced just three turnovers, including zero against Purdue and zero against Stanford. 
Willingham said he continues to emphasize the attitude that turnovers are needed. 
"The first thing is that you always talk about the attitude," Willingham said. "You've got to get where your whole defensive team is flying around and zip­ping around to the football. When you start getting more young men around the ball, you can get one guy to tackle; and one guy to rip for the ball or_you get better breaks on your pass routes if everybody is focused and seeing things in your zone coverage and even tighter man 
Willingham said Tuesday that he expected sophomore Freddie Parish to see more action at strong safety, alternating with Tom Zbikowski, the starter. 
Parish has seen limited time on defense this season, but has played a significant amount on special teams. 
"[Parish! is right in the middle of our strong safety situation," Willingham said. "He and Tommy [Zbikowski! will proba­bly, I won't say trade time, but there are some things that may happen that give [Parish! a little bit more time on the field."

out with the injury, the Irish have a different game plan than just last week. Facing only one quarterback, the Irish don't have to look at two options from each quarter­back's perspective. 
"If you look at their game plan, they do a lot of things with movement of the quar­terback," Willingham said Tuesday at his weekly press conference. 
"But yet one of those guys, his perception, his view may be that run is the option before pass is the option. Yet it ca:n still be the same play and the same call but a totally different option. 
"Because if you looked at those two guys, you would have different game plans for what they do well." 
Ainge is eighth in the SEC with a 134.58 passing-effi­ciency rating for the 7-1 Volunteers. He is also seventh in the conference with 162.9 passing yards per game, and has been sacked just twice in his five starts. Ainge has thrown for 1,303 yards already this season and has 16 touchdowns with nine interceptions. 
"He's not as mobile, but he's got'a tremendous arm and for what they've asked him to do as a true freshman, his stats are pretty good," Irish defen­sive coordinator Kent Baer said. 
"In some ways it was two different kinds of offenses, but in other ways it was all the same because of the forma­tions. We watched everything we could on Ainge this week because he's the guy." 
Before he was injured, Schaeffer had a 13<).53 pass­ing-efficiency rating in seven games and had completed 17­

"And when you have Schaeffer in the lineup, a play becomes very active even though they don't necessarily run a quarterback sweep, but they do it with his drop-back; and maybe his first option is not to pass, but to run."

Irish beco111e contenders 
Notre Dame wins Big East and proves to be a threat for the NCAA championship 
By BOBBY GRIFFIN Sports Wrircr 
Take nolien, the Notre Dame men's cross-country learn is rankml lif'lh in the nation and just won a Big East title. 
That's quite an accomplishment, but !,riven the hard work and dedi­cation this team has put forward this ynar, it is not a surprise. 
On Oct. 12, the Irish WPre ranked ninth in the country, however after taking second in the Pre-Nationals in Terre llauntP and first in last w1~ekend's Big East Championship -the Irish have shown that they am a !Pgilimate contender f(Jr the NCAA Championship. 
The Irish have relied on several different runners this year that have all proved to be central to the success of this year's tl~am. 
Tim Moore, who finished sixth overall in the Big East Championships, also finished 13th in the Pre-Nationals and 13th in the Notre Dame Invitational. 
Coach Joe Piane praised Moore's performanen in the Big East race. 
'That was one of his better races of the year, hn really kind of hblpod champion that group, and he and Kurt Bnnninger have been working extremely well together all year long," Piane said. 
Benninger has been another major reason (iJr the Irish success this season. as he has proved to be a model of consistency. 
Benninger took second place overall in the Notre Dame Invitational and finished SIWimth in this weekend's Big East Championship, just one second behind Moore. lie also finished 8th in the Pre-Nationals. 

Other runners, namely Kaleb Van Ort, Sean O'Donnell and Vinny Ambrico, have also provided a spark for thn Irish all season. 
Van Ort and O'Donnell finishnd eighth and ninth in the Big East race, with times of 23:54 and 23:55. 
Arnbrieo, who finished 60th in his previous race at the Pre­Nationals, finished 17th after mak­ing an intense push down the stretch to pass several runners. 
The continued strong running liJr the Irish is going to be imperative in the coming weeks. On Nov. 13, the team will travel to Ypsilanti, Mieh. for the Great Lakes regional NCAA qualifier. 
Here, the Irish will face several legitimate teams, including top­ranked Wisconsin, No. 10 Indiana and No. 13 ranked Butler. 
Depending on how the Irish lin­ish in this race, they will either receive an automatic qualification for the NCAA championships on Nov.22 in Terre Haute, or an at­large bid. 
"We would like to automatically qualify, there will the 30-plus teams there, and we would like to be in the top two. Those are the only teams to automatically quali­fy," Piane said. "Do you want to win it? Well, the team that is ranked number one in the country is in our region." 
Clearly, a solid race in the Great Lakes regional would be important to the team's continued success, but with the way that the Irish have been running all season, no accomplishment would be surpris­ing.

who was last year's Big East Most Improved Player, averaged 
9.9 points and 3.9 assists last year at the helm of the Irish offense. 
This duo is joined by a deep fronteourt that includes sopho­more Crystal Erwin, junior Courtney LaVere and senior Teresa Borton. Duffy will be joinnd in the backeourt by soph­omores Susie Powers and Breona Gray. Powers saw limit­nd time last year as a freshman, but Gray saw some significant minutes as defensive specialist. 
This group should lead a team coming off a second straight Sweet 16 appearance and a 21­11, including a 12-4 record in Big East play, good for second place. From that team, the Irish return seven monogram win­ners, including four starters. 
McGraw said the goal of tonight's game is to work on the things the team has been work­ing on in practice the last month. 
"We're going to work on some things," McGraw said. "We're focusing on our defense right now and hoping that our defense will be good because that's prob-

Saint Mary's finishes season on a high note 
By RYAN DUFFY Sporrs Wri tcr 
Behind the leadership of seven seniors playing in their final game, tlw Belles put an end to their problems on the road and dosed out their season on a high note with a 6-l victory over Tri­State Uniwrsity on Tunsday. 
"It was a very well played ganw, we werH finally able to play our game instead qf our tnndnncy to play to another toam's style," senior Katie Noble said. 
The Belles got out. to a quick start when senior Lauren Cortese found the back of the nnt for a 1-0 lead. Senior co-cap­tain .Jon Concannon then scored twicn bef'orn the half to give Saint Mary's a 3-0 lead at half­time. Tlw Belles played an equally strong second half, with goals from senior co-captain Jen Ilerdman, McKenna Keenan and Carolyn Logan allowing the Belles to extend their lead beforn dosing out the game 6-1. 

"I thought it was a good way to go out," Concannon said. "Everyone had fun out there, and since we had nothing to lose, w11 might as well make the last game of the season the best we possibly can." 
Concannon, who has been one of the team's leaders all year, went out with a bang by scoring two goals in her final eollegiate game. 
"It never surprises me when she scores, because she's such a talented player. She plays her heart out, and she deserves every goal she gets," Noble said.

Irish vvrap up strong season 
Team records most successful season in program's history 
By ERIC RETTER Sports Writer 

The Irish endod their strongest fall snason in the history of the program in a promising fashion. 
The team shot its lowest total score over three rounds at the Edwin Watts/Palmetto lntercollegiatn in Charleston, 
S.C. Notre Dame shot a 28­over-par 892, but fell to sixth due to turnouts from strong teams in the field, ineluding familiar rivals Michigan and Southern Methodist University, both of whom the Irish had defeated earlier in the season. Despite playing well, the finish was a little disappointing for the team, considering the ear­lier success during the season' and considering it was the event's defending r.hampions. 
Sophomore Stacy Brown led the team throughout the event, tying for 12th place by shooting a career-best 6-over

KERRY CAMP SAYS RACE NOT OVER 
President Bush crept close to re-election early today, leading challenger John Kerry in a campaign cliffhang­er framed by war in Iraq and joblessness at home. Ohio held the key, stirring echoes of Florida in 2000, but this time Bush's advantage was substantial. 
With a majority of the popular vote in hand, the Republican president planned to declare victory early today. 
Ceding nothing, Kerry went to bed without conced­ing.

DANIELS, CHOCOLA WIN 
Mitch Daniels, the former White House budget direc­tor whom President Bush proclaimed "My Man Mitch." was elected governor Tuesday by soundly beating incumbent Joe Kernan.With 92 percent of precincts reporting, Daniels had 1,175,079 votes, or 54 percent, and Kernan had 987,518, or 45 percent, according to unofficial results tabulated by The Associated Press. 
Republican Chris Chocola won his second term in north­ern Indiana's 2nd District with 56 percent of the vote to 43 percent for Democrat Joe Donnelly, which included 45 percent of the precincts reporting.

GOP CONTROLS CONGRESS 
Republicans tightened their grip on the Senate early today, capturing a string of Democratic seats across the South. Democratic leader Tom Daschle struggled for political survival in South Dakota. 
Republicans defeated four veteran Texas Democrats and snatched an open Democratic seat in Kentucky on Tuesday as they marched to the brink of extending their decade-long control of the House.

Bush camp declares victory 
Kerry camp says race not over 

Associated Press 
WASIJJN(;T()N -President Bush crnpt dose to re-election narly Wednosday, leading chal­lenger John Kerry in a campaign cliiThanger framed by war in Iraq and joblossness at home. Ohio held the kPy, stirring echoes of Florida in 2000, but this timo Bush's advantage was substantial. 
With a majority of the popular vote in hand. the Republican prnsident planned to declare vic­tory early Wednesday. "We are convinced that President Bush has won re-election," White House chief of staff Andrew Card said shortly before dawn in the East. 
Ceding nothing, Kerry went to bed without conceding. "We will fight for every vote," his running mate, Sen. John Edwards, told supporters in Boston, whero he and the four-term Massachusetts senator waited out the late, long count. 
Card said Bush not only won a second term but Hepublieans added "to our majority in the llouse and ... to our majority in the Senate." 
As Bush made plans to declare vietory, his high command dis­patehed a 10-person politieal and legal team to Ohio in the event Kerry triggewd a Florida­like right. Card said Bush delayed his own publie state­ment to "givn Smmtor Kerry the respect of morn time to rellect on the rosults ol'this election." 
That was a veiled rnqtmst for Kerry to bow out gracefully. and avoid the rancor that accompa­nied a :HJ-day roeount in fo'lorida four ynars ago. 
That margin was small, but Bush's Inad in Ohio is substan­tial _ Card caiiPd it "statistkally insurmountable, nvPn aftlw pro­visional ballots are eonsidornd." 
With Bush leading by 145,000 votes and roughly 190,000 yet to he counted. orw top Kerry advis­er said tho Dmnor.rat's chances of winning Ohio, and with it the White llouse, wnrP difficult at best. 
Thn ra1:e was remarkably sim­ilar to the 2000 campaign, Bush winning all but one of the states he carried four years ago, while Kerry picked up where Democrat AI Gore left off. For Bush, that meant sweeping the South and several western and Midwestern state. fo'or Kerry that meant capturing California, Pennsylvania, New York and lllinois, a handful of West Coast and Midwest states. 

Three states hung in the bal­ance -New Mexico, Iowa and Ohio, but only the Buckeye State had enough electoral votes to make a difference. 
After winning Nevada in the wee hours Wednesday, Bush stood only 16 electoral votes shy of the 270 required for a second term. Kerry stalled at 252. Bush made plans _ later revisited _ to declare victory. 
Ceding nothing, Kerry dis­patched Edwards to tell support­ers: "We've waited four years for this victory. We can wait one more night." 
The night proved grim for Democrats. Hepublicans expanded their majority in the Senate, knocking off Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, and the GOP extended its de·cade-long hold on the House for another two years. 
Florida fell into Bush's lap with relative ease. Kerry took New llampshire from Bush _ the first and perhaps only state to switch parties _ but it has just four electoral votes. That lel't Ohio as Kerry's only hope. 
The holdup was over provi­siomtl ballots _ those cast by people whose qualificati<)[]s to vote were challenged. At 3 a.m. EST, Bush had a lead of 125,000 votes; there were more provi­sional ballots outstanding. 
"There's no mathematical path to victory for Kerry in Ohio," said Nieolle Devenish, spokeswoman for the Bush­Chenoy campaign, arguing that Bush would get his shan~ of the pr<>visional ballots. The White House had contacted Ohio Secretary of State Kenneth Blaekwell, urging the Hepublican to clarify the num­her of provisional ballots. 
Nationwide, with 97 percent of the nation's precincts reporting, some 112 million people had voted -up from 105 million in 2000. 
Bush was winning the popular vote by around 3.6 million, or 51 percent to Kerry's 48 percent. 
Early in the voting, Kerry allowed himself to muse about the problems he might face in the White House, including a soaring deficit and a war that has claimed more than 1,100 lives. 
''I'm not pretending to any­body that it's a bed of roses," said the 60-year-old Massachusetts senator. 
The Electoral College count was excruciating: With 270 votes needed, Bush won 28 states for 254 votes. Kerry won 19 states plus the District of Columbia for 252 votes. 
With three states out, Kerry was still on the hunt for elec­toral votes that the GOP won four years ago. The states' won b,v Gore in 2000 are worth just 260 votes this year due to redis­tricting -10 short of the covet­ed number. 
Kerry could pick that up plus some in Ohio with 20 electoral votes. 
A 269-269 tie would throw the presidential raee to the House. 
Alongside the White House and congressional races, a full roster of propositions and local offices kept votnrs busy. But all eyes were focused on Kerry's bid to make Bush the !irst president voted out of ollice in the midst of a war. 
''I've given it my all," Bush said aftpr voting in a firnhouse at Crawford, Texas, hoping to avoid being ihe first wartime president bounced from office. 
Save Ohio, the race was a car­bon copy of 2000, a narrowly fought battle waged by lawyers and politicians alike. In 2000, Bush lost the popular vote to Gore but won the Electoral CollegP count and the presiden­cy after a ruling by the Supn~me Court gave him Florida. 
The incumbent sought to avoid 
the fate of his father -former 
President George H.W. Bush, 
who was ousted by voters in 
1992 after waging war against 
Iraq and ov,erseeing an ailing 
economy. 
Legions of lawyers and elec­tion-rights activists watched for signs of voter fraud or disen­franchisement. New lawsuits sought clearer standards to evaluate provisional ballots in Ohio and a longer deadline to count absentee ballots in Florida. 
While complaints were. wide­spread, they weren't significant. "So far, it's no big, but lots of Iit­tles," said elections expert Doug Chapin. 
Voters were torn over the presidential race, in ways all too familiar. 
Exit polls suggested that slightly more voters trusted Bush to handle terrorism than Kerry. A majority said the coun­try was safer from terrorism than four years ago, and they overwhelmingly backed Bush. 
However, among those who said they were very worried about a terrorist strike, Kerry held a slight lead. A majority of voters saidl things were going poorly in Iraq, and they heavily favored Kerry. 
With nearly 1 million jobs lost in Bush's term, Kerry was favored by eight or 1() voters who listed the economy as a top issue. 
The nation's mood? There was division on that, too. llalf said the country was headed in the right direction, a good sign for the incumbent. 
Voters weleomed an end to the longost., most expensive presi­dential eleetim1 on record. "It's the only way to make .the ads stop," Amanda Karel, 25, said as she waited to vote at a banquet hall in Columbus, Ohio. 
Both sides spent a combined $600 million on TV and radio ads, more than twice the total from 2000. 
Bush won among white men, voters with family incomes above $100,000 and weekly churchgoers. Three-fourths of 
white voters who described 
themselves as born-again 
Christians or evangelicals sup­
ported Bush. 
The president had hoped to increase his support among the religious right sinee 2000, but exit polls suggest then1 was little change. 
Kerry retained Gore's margins among blacks and union houso­holds, key parts of the Democratie base. llis voters named the economy and Iraq as top issues. 
One in 1 0 voters were casting ballots for the first time and fewer than 10 percent were young voters, hardly the groundswell that experts had predicted. Kerry was favored by both groups, according to the surveys conducted for The Associated Press by Edison Media Research and Mitofsky International. 
Bush won Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming. 
Kerry won California, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New llampshin~. New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhodo Island. Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and statowide in Mainn. 
Eleven gubornatorial eontosts wore being decided Tuesday, along with 5,800 logislative seats in 44 statos. Former Bush administration budgot director Miteh Daninls won the governor­ship in Indiana, taking tho seat from the Domocrats. 
Among the notable ballot measures, voters in 11 states approved propositions that would ban gay marriage. In California, voters approved spending $3 billion on stem-coli research.

Netvvorks proceed cautiously vvith rebuilt polling system. 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK-Mindful of the spectacu­lar failure of their blown calls four years ago. television networks proceeded with caution as election results came in Tuesday. 
There were concerns, however, that the Parly exit polls they commissioned had indicated John Kerry would do bet­ter than hP appeared to be faring as actual vote counts came in. 
Five TV news organizations and The Associated Press formed the National Election Pool to conduct exit polls of vot­ers. while the AP was supplying actual vote counts from across the nation. 
The networks blamed bad information from an old system for twice premature­ly declaring a winner in Florida in 2000 -the second time awarding the presi­dency to George W. Bush weeks before it was settled. 
When the 2004 results are completely known, the networks will look at whether this year's exit polls overesti­mated Democratic vote counts, said Bill Wheatley, NBC News vice president. But he noted that the networks relied on real vote counts to make their calls in contested states. 
"I think it would be premature to say that we had any substantial problems," Wheatley said. 
Before polls had closed, the exit poll information that had once been avail­able only to a privileged few was racing around the Internet. Television reporters tried, with varying degrees of success, not to ref1ect that information so as not to influence voters. 
Those early numbers looked so posi­tive for Kerry that Fox News Channel analyst Jim Pinkerton, at 3:30 p.m. EST, said, "I think it looks good for angry Democrats." 
And on evening news programs, some correspondents subtly telegraphed the polls. NBC's David Gregory said Bush "appeared subdued," while ABC's Terry Moran noted the president had expressed a "rare sense of doubt." 
Later on Fox, analysts talked openly about how some actual results contra­dicted exit polls numbers. 
"Either the exit polls are completely wrong," Fox analyst Susan Estrich said, "or George Bush loses." 
It wasn't until four hours into the cov­erage, when the major networks put Pennsylvania in Kerry's corner, that any of the big battleground states had been called. 
"Going into this we said it would be close, and we didn't lie." said Tom Brokaw, who was anchoring NBC's elec­tion coverage for the linal time. lie steps down as "Nightly News" anchor on Dec. 1. 
· Although networks r-alled states where there was little doubt quickly and con­sistently, there was little of the hyper­competitiveness often visible on election nights. Rivals waited nearly 30 minutes, for instance, to join CBS in putting Virginia and North Carolina in Bush's column. 
ABC's Peter Jennings even cautioned Moran as he stood outside the White House reporting on what the president was telling reporters inside. 
"You're speculating, aren't you?" Jennings asked. Moran admitted he was, but that it was informed speculation. 
ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox and the AP disbanded their previous exit poll and vote -counting consortium, Voter News Service, after the 2000 fiasco and anoth­er failure in 2002. Two veteran polling outfits -Mitofsky International and Edison Media Research .-collaborated on exit polls this year. 
The AP said it has beefed up its vote ­counting operation now that it will be the sole source of these results for the news organizations. 
The National Election Pool says it has made accommodations for the surge in early voting. While exit polls were taken in only three states that offered early voting in 2000, NEP has polled early vot­ers in 13 states this year, including Florida, said Michael Mokrzycki, the AP's director of polling. 
In response to what happened in 2000, NBC quarantined its experts making calls on winners and losers in a room without TV sets so they couldn't see their rivals, while Fox had four execu­tives on its decision desk and promised not to call a state unless all four agreed. CBS said it wouldn't declare a wiimer or loser in any state, cautiously saying it would only "estimate" a winner. 

World drawn into race with uncommon intensity 
Associated Press 
BERLIN -People outside the United States could only watch, wait and vent as Americans lined up to vote Tuesday in an election that provoked an extraordinary degree of emo­tional involvement beyond U.S. borders. 
Not just leaders and news media, but ordinary people were riveted by the contest between Presidef.lt Bush and John Kerry, convinced that a world roiled by the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq, the war on terrorism. and cultural and reli­gious conflict had a huge stake in the outcome. 
Saif-ur Hahman, a 36-year­old lawyer in Pakistan's capital, Islamabad. planned to watch the results come in and hopes for a change. 

"Muslims have suffered under Bush whether they are in America or elsewhere," he said. "I hope Kerry will change that." 
In Sao Paulo, Brazil, Wagner Markues, 54, also prefers Kerry and wonders why the race is so dose. 
"We don't understand America now," he said. "Are they getting different news than us about the scandals in the Iraqi prisons, and the children and civilians who are getting killed?" 
Lee Tim Hoe, a car salesman in Malaysia, said he was "keep­ing my fingers crossed for Kerry to win. I will try to keep awake to catch the final results." 
In the Mideast, prominent columnist Jihad al-Khazen wrote in the pan Arab daily Al­Hayat that Arabs would be no better off under either Bush or Kerry, but said people through­out the region worried about the result because "the American president exercises authority over us which our presidents don't." 
One Arab country where the Hepublican ticket remained strong was Kuwait, freed by 
U.S.-led forces under the first President Bush after Saddam Hussein invaded in 1990. 
"In Kuwait, we have love and respect for the Bushes because they moved the world to liber­ate Kuwait from its occupier, the toppled Saddam Hussein," read a column in Kuwait's Al­Anba daily. 
About 1,000 people gathered at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Amman, Jordan, for an election night function. Monsignor Nabil Haddad, head of the Melkite Catholic community, backed Kerry, calling him "a man of high caliber." But political sci­ence student Feras Sababha, 19, preferred Bush, saying he was a strong leader who will 
"press ahead with the policy of reform in the Arab world." In Israeli newspapers, the 
U.S. election topped front pages, overshadowing even big local stories -Yasser Arafat's illness and a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv. 
"Kerry or Bush," read the red, white and blue headline in the daily Yediot Ahronot. 
"A day that will decide the fate of the world," read a ban­ner headline in Britain's Independent. 
Many rooted for one side with a kind of intensity sometimes lacking in their own domestic elections. 
Bush's go-it-alone stance on many issues -from the Kyoto Treaty to the war in Iraq -as well as his religious outlook, his Texas background and single­minded approach, made him a target for many. 
Polls in many countries -and a quick survey of the newspa­pers and TV -left little doubt that Kerry is the preferred choice across much of the globe. But while popular opin­ion was sometimes skeptical of Bush, he has support from the leaders of foreign countries as diverse as Britain, Australia, Hussia and Japan. 
In Europe, Bush remained a tough sell. "The man to beat," France's 
Liberation said in big type above a picture of Bush. In Germany, where Bush is deeply unpopular, Michael Moore's anti-Bush film "Fahrenheit 9/11" was prime time fare on television on election eve. 
Many places have held mock polls, such as the artists, writ­ers and professors in the Italian region of Tuscany, who organ­ized what they billed as "the first American elections for non-Americans." 
At the heart of the matter is a belief that in an era of global­ization, when American deci­sions affect hundreds of mil­lions around the globe, the elec­tion is not just a U.S. issue. 
"Why shouldn't the Italians vote for the elections, too?" said screenwriter Michele Cogo. "The planet's destiny is decided in large part by America." 
Plenty of foreign politicians have personal stakes in the out­come -and in these circles the choice is more balanced. 
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and Hussian President Vladimir Putin, for instance, have signaled their preference for Bush. 
"I don't want to interfere in another country's election, but I'm close to Bush so I'd like him to do well," said Koizumi, who sent 500 Japanese troops to Iraq on a humanitarian mission. 
Putin has said a Bush defeat would mean a "new impulse" for terrorism, though he has declined to make an explicit endorsement. Bush has toned down criticism of Hussia's heavy handed campaign against sepa­ratist rebels in Chechnya in return for Putin's support in the war on terror. 
The politicians who were keeping quiet -the usual prac­tice regarding another country's elections -had a big stake as well. 
For France and Germany ­dubbed "Old Europe" by Defense Secretary Donald Humsfeld -a Kerry White House would mean a chance of mending ties, but could bring newfound complications. Both nations refused to help Bush in Iraq, but may have a-problem saying no again if Kerry makes good on his campaign pledge to seek more allies in the war. 
If Kerry wins, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder may face pressure to back off his refusal to send troops to Iraq. 
"If a newly elected president calls for a new contribution that we've refused up to now, it won't be so easy to reject ·as it fortunately has been with the enemy image of Bush," former defense minister Hudolf Scharping said.

Defining Moments in the 


Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The presi­dential race of 2004 lumbered into history as the longest and the costliest, a· wartime election with a nail-biter of a finish and a bitter residue of political divi­sion and polarization. 
The country was split down the middle between President Bush and Democratic chal­lenger John Kerry, and the nation's polities were so polar­ized that it seemed unlikely the winner would find common ground with opponents anytime soon. 
Hegardless of the outcome, 
half of the country  was  sure  to  
be unhappy.  
Troublesome  for  Bush,  a  

majority of Americans were unhappy about the war in Iraq and the .shape of the economy, according to Associated Press exit polls. Nine out of' 10 were worried about the availability and cost of health care. 
Three-fourths said they wor­ried about another major ter­rorist attack, and they split their votes between Bush and Kerry. 
A surge in voter registration and the biggest voter mobiliza­tion campaign ever added uncertainty. 
There were many ways to describe the presidential con­test. It was a competition of two men of wealth and privilege, both graduates of Yale University and members of the 
same secret ·society, Skull and Bones. 
It was the first White House election since the nation was shaken by its worst-ever terror­ist attack, the first sinr.P the American-led invasion of Iraq, and the first in wartime since Vietnam. 
Osama bin Laden edged into the race with a videotaped appearance that reminded Americans of the Y/11 attacks. More than half of voters said the bin Laden tape was impor­tant in their vote, and they tended to support Kerry. · 
Iraq towered over the election with grisly scenes of behead­ings, bombings and massacres, reminding Americans of the steep price of war. The nation has lost more than 1,100 troops in Iraq, and voters were split on whether the United States should have invaded in the first place and wondered how to get out. 
While incumbents often dele­gate negative campaigning to their vice presidents, Bush did not shrink from the task, brand­ing Kerry weak and indecisive and the kind of leader who would put the nation at risk. 
"This president has been the bad cop in chief," said Norman Ornstein. a well-known political analyst. lie described the race as "the nastiest in our lifetimes. It doesn't maybe equal the 19th century but it's hard to watch this without getting an upset stomach if you care about poli-

In addition, 34 Senate races and 435 House contests were on the ballot. 
Republicans retained their majority in the House for the fifth election in a row and held control of the Senate, too. 
One thing that made this year 
Iraq. 
In Congress, Democrats and Hepublicans regarded each other with suspi­cion and hostili­ty. Bush fueled the partisanship by refusing to compromise with Democrats on issues from taxes to judicial appointments. 
Rather than accommodate his opponents after emerging the winner of the

distinctive was the incredible flood of money that poured in despite the McCain­Feingold law t h at w a s· s u p ­posed to control campaign cash. Total spending in the presiden­tial and con­gressional r a c e s approached a breathtaking $4 billion. 
It also was the longest 

disputed election of 2000, Bush behaved like he had a mandate and relied on his Republican base rather than try to attract supporters on the other side. 
Bad feelings were exacerbated by a campaign in which both candidates tried to rouse their core supporters with negative attacks on the other side. "Under these circumstances it's likely that the honeymoon for the next president, even one 
race. With more than 40 trips to Pennsylvania and 30 to Florida underlining his most frequent destinations over four years, Bush arguably had been run­ning for re-election since he took office. 
The Democrats had their can­didate ready on March 2 -the earliest in modern times ­when Kerry clinched the nomi­nation with a string of Super Tuesday primary victories.

Voting snafus, dustups are scattered 

Associated Press 
Machines malfunctioned, tempers 

flared and edgy voters often waited 
hours Tuesday to pick a president in 
a contentious race watched by thou­
sands of monitors who expected the 
worst. 
But by the close of East Coast polls, 

only scattered local snafus had been 
reported in an election turnout that 
was shaping up to be the heaviest in 
years. 
"So far, it's no big, but lots of Iit­tles," said Doug Chapin, director of the Election Reform Information Project, a nonpartisan research group. "We know of no major melt­downs anywhere along the lines some people were worried about." About 50 percent of all voters said they were very certain ballots in their .state would be accurately counted, according to a national Associated Press exit poll conducted by Edison Media Research and Mitofsky 
International. 
I Iyper-vigilance appeared to be the 

order of the day, which in some 
states prompted poll closures and 
unf(mnded complaints. 
In New Jersey, for example, a sus­

picious substance later determined to 
be spilled salt prompted the two­
hour closure of a Mount Laurel 
precinct. In Pennsylvania, zealous 
GOP election monitors complained 
that some Philadelphia voting 
machines already had thousands of 
recorded votes when the polls 
opened at 7 a.m. 
Local election officials quickly explained that voting machines regis­tered every vote ever cast on them ­like mileage on a car odometer ­and that did not constitute evidence of fraud. 

"It's absolutely ridiculous," said Deputy City Commissioner Ed Schulgen. 
In Colorado, Republican Party ofli­cials said a lawyer for the Democrat.'> showed up at an Eagle County precinct with a list of registered GOP voters, planning to challenge them all. Democrats acknowledged it was true. 
In other closely contested sta,tes ­including Iowa and Michigan -the liberal group MoveOn.org was accused of disrupting local precincts. In Ohio, a woman filed a lawsuit on behalf of voters who didn't receive absentee ballots on time, asking they be allowed to cast provisional ballots. Later, a Toledo federal judge granted her request. 
Also in Michigan, the NAACP filed a Justice Department complaint, say­ing it received 35 complaints that GOP poll watchers were harassing voters in Detroit. 
In Wisconsin, Republicans said vandals spray-painted "Illegitimate Democracy" across state party head­quarters. In Milwaukee, police said tires were slashed on about 20 get­out-the-vote vehicles leased by the GOP. 
New touch-screen voting machines, criticized by computer scientists and several elections officials as suscepti­ble to hacking and malfunction, were used Tuesday in 29 states and the District of Columbia. Only Nevada has mandated the machines produce paper receipts, which could make recounts more reliable. 
In Florida, which gave the 2000 election to George W. Bush on the basis of 537 votes, 10 touch-screen voting machines failed at various precincts in Broward County. Nearly half the state's voters were using the_ ATM-like machines. 
Chellie Pingree, president of Common Cause and a former inter­national election monitor, said a toll­free voting hot line established by her citizens' lobbying group had logged at least 50,000 calls. 
Tuesday's high voter turnout could bring "more confusion to already overburdened, understaffed polling places," Pingree said. And many of those places, she added, "will have as many lawyers and poll chal­lengers as they have people voting." 
Tensions flared early at many of those sites. A Democratic official in Cleveland claimed he was thrown out of a church basement by a screaming poll judge. Another judge allowed him to return. 
In Florida, two Bush supporters filed a lawsuit seeking at least $15,000 in damages, claiming-they were punched, pushed, shoved and spat on when they showed up at a Halloween rally for Democratic can­didate John Kerry, dressed as giant flip-flops. In a separate lawsuit, the ACLU asked that absentee ballots mailed within the United States be subject to the same deadline, Nov. 
12. as overseas ballots. 
Kerry leads Bush on minority vote 
WASHINGTON -Republicans' hopes that President Bush would improve his standing with black voters came to little or nothing Tuesday, but he did better with Hispanics than four years ago. 
Bush was doing as poorly with blacks as he did in 2000, getting only about one in 10 of their votes, exit polls indicated. His performance with black voters in 2000 was the worst for a Hepublican presidential candidate since Barry Goldwater got 6 percent in 1964 in his race against Lyndon Johnson. 
Kerry also led among Hispanic voters, but the gap was closer and Bush made some progress on that front -getting 40 percent of their votes or a bit higher. Kerry had a 15-point lead over Bush with Hispanics -about half tlw margin that Democrat AI Gore enjoyed in 2000. 
Bush, a former Texas governor, activPly court­ed the llispanie vote in both presidential cam­paigns and speaks passing Spanish. 
Blacks made up roughly the sanw proportion of voters as in 2000, exit polls suggested. About one in 10 voters was blaek.

The most important candidate quality to Hispanic voters was the ability to bring about 
..

needed change -about a fourth chose that, and they overwhelmingly backed Kerry. 
The economy and jobs were important to black voters, cited by one-third of them as the issue that mattered most. Almost half or blacks said their own family's financial situation was worse than four years ago; only about one in seven said they were doing better. Americans overseas wait to see if their votes make a difference 
MEXICO CITY -Most cast their ballots weeks ago, and some will have to hunt down a televi­sion to find constant coverage of the U.S. elec­tion. 
But Americans around the globe, gathering at embassy parties, private homes and even bars to watch the results, know their vote counts more than ever. 
For months, the campaigns of President Bush and John Kerry have courted overseas voters, helping them register from as far away as Asia and sponsoring everything from fund-raisers to parties to get people involved. 
The attention wasn't a coincidence. Four years ago, Bush's victory was certified only after the overseas ballots were counted. That fact has encouraged a rise in overseas registration, embassies and political supporters say. 
On Tuesday, the Web sites of both Democrats Abroad and Republicans Abroad encouraged last-minute voters to fill out federal write-in absentee ballots and fax them home. 
Mexico was a key overseas battleground, with the largest number of U.S. citizens living abroad: an estimated 1 million Americans. Many are retirees, students or have business interests in everything from factories to hotels. 
In Mexico City, election parties were planned across the city Tuesday night, with diplomats and other political elite gathering at a U.S. Embassy event, and Democrats scheduling their own celebrations at a hotel and bar. 
In Moscow, the U.S. Embassy invited 700 peo­ple-to a reception that featured live music, 
TV campaign ads and life-size cutouts of Bush and Kerry for those wanting photo reminders of the night.

QUESTION OF THE DAY: WHAT WAS THE BIGGEST SURPRISE OF ELECTION NIGHT? 

ELECTION OFFBEAT 
Neighbors' names create 
special connection to elec­
tion 
NEW KENSINGTON, Pa.­Maybe the nation isn't as divid­ed as all the pundits daim. 
After all, Upper Burrell Township neighbors Kerry Bush and John George have made it through the presiden­tial campaign on speaking torrns . 
"I don't think people have put two-and-two tognthnr." Gnorge said, noting that rwighbors haven't targeted either man with eleetion Yf~ar pranks. 
GPorge said it was his fourth-grade son, Cole, who noticed that the neighbors' names combine to l'orrn those of President George W. Bush and his Democratie ehal­lenger, Sen ..John Kerry. 
Bush manages a company that just got the deaning eon­tract at a nearby hospital, and said his name helped break the ice with his nnw eo-work­ers. 
And he has a ready reply to their most frequent jokes. 
"I don't feel at all like a flip­flopper," Bush said. "I get called Mr. Bipartisan." 
Zoo names baby monkeys for presidential candidates 
DES MOINES, Iowa -_Two baby marmosets, who made their debut at the Blank Park Zoo, have a good reason to remember this election season -they've been named George and John for President Bush and his Democratic challenger, Sen. John Kerry. 
"We wanted to find a unique way to commemorate the times the presidential candi­dates monkeyed around in Iowa," quipped Terry Rich, chief executive officer at the zoo. "This has been a wild campaign." 
Thn tiny monkeys, born eight weeks ago. are twins -not that uncommon in marmosets, Rich said. They were kept under elose watch until deemed healthy enough to put on exhibit -which just hap­pened to l'aii on the eve of Tw~sday's election. 
Native to Brazil. marmosets eat fruit. leaves. seeds and inseets. They live to be 15 to 20 years old. and have sent pads to mark their territory. 
"I think one or them smiled, which probably indicatns tht1y've got a little political streak in them," Hich said. 
Women receive special ride to the polls on Election Day 
EUGENE, Ore. -Forgive some women for being a tad bit miffed when the hunky men who had oll'ered to drive them to polling stations arrived. After all, the men were fully dothed. 
The plan had called for the men of Long Tom Grange ­Oregon's best known nudie calendar -to offer voters a free limo ride to ballot drop-oil' sites. The men made head­lines last year when they ban~d all for a calendar benefiting local schools. 
Linda Roberts was surprised when 66-year-old rancher John Lopes greeted her in jeans and a cowboy shirt. As Mr. May in the group's 2005 
calendar, he wore only his belt and boots astride his horse. The group had considered going topless. "But it's too cold," Lopes eun­·fessed. 
Most Oregon voters mailed in 
their ballots, though some 
wanted to go drop them off in 
person. The men seized on the 
ballot delivery service as a way 
both to publicize their second 
calendar and to promote voter . 
participation. 

Despite the lack of nudity, 
Hoberts, 46, a stay-at-home 
mother of two. was grateful 
for the group's service Monday 
aftprnoon for people like her: 
"slackers and proerastinators." 
'Then I heard that their limo 
was corning for people and I 
thought, What a great way to 
go to the polls. I'd better fill my 
ballot out!" 
Family blends election duty 
with Day of the Dead tradi­
tion 

RENO, Nev. -While election 
talk fillod living rooms Tuesday 
evening, one family combined 
civic discussion with cultural 
tradition. 

Eight-year-old Rose Kibala lit a candle, remembering the death or her father on the sec­ond night of celebration for Dia de los Muertos, Day of the Dead. 
"In the midst of all the elec­tion results, we will still make time and do this," said Hose's mother Bettie Kibala, who voted Tuesday. "We live the American Dream yet still hold tight to our Aztec/Mexican tra­ditions. We balance our lives." 
Spirits return on the Day of the Dnad. a celnbration of both life and death. Faithful gather in graveyards in hopns of eon­taeting the dead through prayer, song and offerings of food and flowers. 
The Day of the Dmtd tradi­tion originated with the indige­nous people of Mexico. Tlw Aztecs kept skulls and dis­played them during a month­long l'itual. They wen~ used to symbolize death and robirth. 
The rituals merged with the Homan Catholic faith. Those who died as children are remembered bnl'ore dawn on Nov. 1 -All Saints Day ­whilP the following day -All Souls Day -is set aside for thosn who died as adults. 
This ynar. tho election has overshadowed the Mexican tradition. 
Bettie 'Kibala, who lives in Sparks, said she enjoyed tak­ing her family to the celebra­tion at Shopper's Square Mall in Heno but could not this year. 
"They said it conllieted with the election days and they had opted not to do it this year," she said. 
So the celebration with fami­ly and friends will remain in their home this year. 
On the altar, called an ofrnn­da in Spanish, arn pictures of David Kibala, who died in 1996 of a heart defect. There is the hammer, which was the first thing he made in wood­shop dass in seventh grade. There is a jug of water to refresh the spirit and candles to light the way. Trays of fruit, garlic, dried corn and lots of chocolate also decorate the table.
