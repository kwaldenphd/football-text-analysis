Dear Notre Dame Faculty, Administrators, and 
Students: · 
I had a meeting with concerned black students last week. We discussed a variety of problems that they presented. In general, I think that all of the problems are now either solved or on the way to a solution. 
More important than the specific problems was what they perceived as attitudes here and there on campus that might be described as racist. Our easiest reaction might be: no, never. There cannot possible be racism on a campus as open and caring as Notre Dame. 
One l~sson I have learned over the years is that if a reasonably large number of people perceive that something is wrong, it deserves attention, whatever my personal perception might be. I have found this to be particularly true when it concerns the perception from one side of a situation that lends 
itself  to  tension:  men  and  women,  faculty  and  
students,  administration  and  faculty,  black  and  
white, or whatever.  

I like to believe that ugly realities like overt racism and prejudice are generally absent here. Having spent so much time fighting these ugly realities all over the country in the sixties and early seventies, I would be very disappointed to find them alive and active here at home. 
Even so, I must admit that racism and prejudice are like termites that somehow get into the house. The main purpose of these few lines is to say that if our black students at times seem to perceive evidence of racism and prejudice among us, it well behooves all of us to be more alert to what is being perceived and why. Some frank conversations between blacks and whites, such as we had last week, would be helpful to both sides. I would be the first to admit that prejudice is a hardy weed that often flourishes despite our best efforts to stamp it out in our judgments and actions. 
I thought that the editorial "Discrimination Meditation" in last Friday's Observer stated the case very well. All that I can add at this time is an invitation to each one of you, and to myself, to be alert to the worm of prejudice that we all have within us. I otten find myself correcting my judgements when prejudice lurks in the background. It necessitates a constant effort to remind ourselves that we are all equal in the sight of God, that we are 
indeed brothers and sisters, that the differences of race, or nationality, or religion or sex are no valid excuse for discrimination or prejudice or blind adherence to ancient and benighted stereotypes. This will be a good community if we are each open to the other, if respect for each other equally abounds, if love and care motivate our dealings with each other. That may sound like Utopia in a world that is often unfair and cruel. However, it is precisely this atmosphere that will make everyone feel equally welcome and cherished at Notre Dame, and anything less is unworthy of all of us, if indeed we are what we claim to be at Notre Dame. 
I expect that the great majority of you agree with me in this hope for a very special kind of community here where all belong equally, where we cherish our common humanity whatever our individual differ­ences. 
For your personal help in making this ideal become ever more real here at Notre Dame, I am most grateful. 
~er devotedly in Notre Dame,

Also, the Office for Student Affairs will assist the Notre Dame Gospel Choir in funding· after a budget has been proposed and approved. 
Finally, Paczesny stated that "the Office of Student Affairs will share the topics discussed and proposals suggested by the black students with the various directors under its jurisdiction." 
Roemer expressed deep concern about the problem of discrimina­tion on the Notre Dame campus and "what appears to be wide­spread indifference to racial prob­lems on the part of the University as a whole." Although Roemer stated that he believes Notre Dame is "better than most white middle­class institutions in the area of discrimination," he said that the University should be more concer~ ned with improvement in that area. 
Essentially, Roemer observed, the problem is ignorance and the solution is education. He sugges­ted that blacks assume the roles of teachers as well as students in order to provide the education necessary for the elimination of discrimination. 
Roemer stressed the importance

coast. 
The Ekofisk field is about 170 

miles from the southern tip of 
Norway. Winds first blew the slick 
toward the Danish coast at Jutland, 
and then shifted Sunday night, 
pushing it toward the Scottish coast 
200 miles to the west. 
Officials said they have decided 

not to use special chemicals on the 
oil slick to break it up unless it 
comes seriously close to shore. 
Sea-life experts have warned that 
the dispersant chemicals might 
destroy rich mackerel spawning 
grounds in the sea. 
Phillips spokesman Kjetil Folme 

said the company had received 
Norwegian government approval 
for its plans to cap the pipe, 
bringing oil up from 10,000 feet 
beneath the sea floor. He said at 
best, the operation would take two 
or three days. 
The rig "blew" on Friday during 

routi;ne maintenance. With all pro­
duction from the Ekofisk field shut 
down, Norway is losing an estimat­
ed 5300,000 a day in revenues. 
Folme said Hansen and Hatten­. berg were on board the pipe laying 
barge Tucto alongside the Bravo 
rig. 
The two specialists from the Red 

Adair Oil Well Fire and Blowout 
Pre'vention Co. had mounted the 
platform twice on Sunday and 
reported that the blowout was only 
a partial one, and at least one 
safety valve along the pipe was still 
holding closed. · 
Folme said the operation will 

invilve trying to fit a multi valve cap 
over the pipe to stop the flow. ·If it 
fails to bold workers will fit more 
valves so they can start pumping 
heavy drilling mud into the pipe to 
hold down the oil and gas. 
In Britain, fishermen and en­

vironmentalists warned that the slick could turn large stretches of the fish-rich waters into a dead sea. 
Fred Holliday, a government marine biologist, said the oil may sweep across fresh fish, eggs floating on the surface, threatening stocks of plaice, sloe, haddock, whiting and herring over the next three years. 
The British Fishing Federation said it was "extremely worried." An expert on oil pollution said shellfish and seabirds are also in danger. 
Ifthe spill continues until Friday, experts estimate it will match the 
7.6 million gallons dumped into the sea by the broken tanker Argo Merchant off Nantucket Island, Mass., last December. The worst tanker spill in history was the 29 million gallons from the wreck of the supertanker Torrey Canyon off southwest England in 1967. 
In a related development, the Supreme Court in Washington let stand a lower court decision allow­ing the government to penalize those responsible for oil spills in 
U.S. waterways even if they obey the law and report them. 
Barge owners had cballebged the ruling saying it was unfair to penalize vessel owners who report sDills themselves.

ND Law School Civil Rights Center to hold lecture series this week 
by Chris Datzman Senior Staff Reporter 

The Center for Civil Rights of Notre Dame Law School will spon­sor an international symposium on human rights tomorrow through Saturday. 
The purpose of the symposium, according to Donald P. Kommers, director of the center, is to bring together leading human rights scholars and elicit their thoughts on the problems concerning the inter­national protection of human rights in the world today. 
Among those invited to present papers are Rita E. Hauser, former delegate to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, John Brademas, Majority Whip, 
U.S. House of Representatives, Donald Fraser, House of Represen­tatives and Karl Vasak, director of the Internaitonal Institute of Hu man Rights. Fr. Theodore Res­burgh. University president, will preside over the evening session on Friday. 
The Civil Rights Center yearly sponsors several conferences, con­centrating on a different theme each year. This year's theme, International Human Rights, is in keeping with the modern trend towards world-wide awareness,

''The issue of human rights is a 
very salient one these days," said 
Kommers. "Carter's human rights 
policy is becoming very controver­
sial and we want to explore the 
extent of human rights in various 
parts of the world." 
The revived interest in human 
rights is a result of declining liberal 
democracy and continuous racial 
discrimination in many countries, 
as well as an increase in the 
number of political prisoners and 
acts of transnational violence, 
Kommers noted. The symposium 
will explore these issues and 
examine more deeply the source, 
range and meaning of human 
dignity in today's world. 
The four day symposium will be 
broken down into seven sessions. 
Each session will feature one to 
three speakers who will present a 
summary oftheir papers. After the 
short presentation, discussants will 
ask questions or offer comments 
under the direction of a chairman­
rapporteur. Discussants will in­

open letters 
To: .The Notre "Dame Community 
I am concerned about the problem of discrimination raised by the Concerned Black Students in their statement of April20. This concern is heightened by what appears to be widespread indifference to racial problems on the part of the University community as a whole. I personally confess I hardly know how to describe or how to begin dealing with the issue of racial discrimination in a satisfactory and public way. 
I am aware of many conscious and unconscious acts of racial discrimination, some petty, others not so petty, that remain hidden behind the facade of indifference and hostility. 
I am sure that Notre Dame is better than most wh1te middle-class institutions in the area of discrimina­tion. We would, of course, like to believe that Notre Dame is much better off than most, and rapidly improving. But is it? At the very least, substantial improvement should become a priority in the list of University priorities. 
Since Notre Dame is an educational institution, it comes as no surprise that the problem is essentially one of education. We need to be educated to the extent and measure of the racial problem in this place. Ignorance is the enemy. But who will teach us? There is no obvious or simple solution to this problem. The Blacks need the wisdom, patience and determination to address a problem that is only dimly seen by most of us. What an admission to make after so much discrimination, so many protests, so much research! 
Is it fair to ask the Blacks to assume the good will of the majority of us in this enterprise? If such a deliberate and difficult act of faith is indeed made, it will then be necessary to raise issues and confront acts of discrimination with the purpose of both solving specific problems as well as at the same time educating the whole community. I am suggesting that the Blacks become teachers as well as students. 
The issue of human rights has become an issue of national and worldwide importance. It has become the theme of domestic and foreign policies, of conferences, workshops and seminars. It becomes intolerable for honest people at a Catholic university to speak out against violations of human rights in far-off places if we are indi~nt to similar

I'--Dean of Students 
To: The Notre Dame Family It would have been good to have had everyone who works or studies at Notre Dame listen to the concerned Black students this past April 21. That privilege was mine and that of the Dean of Students, Mr. Jim Roemer. 
The presentations were clear and precise with the desire to solve irritating and disruptive problems with sincere action and not mere rhetoric. 
Since the concerns of minority students touch many of the operations of the Office of Student Affairs, I have made the following commitments as a sign of good will to do something and not merely to say that I am only concerned: 
1. 
The top priority is to select a full-time Minority Student coordinator. The position has been on a part-time basis for several years. A search by t.he Black Student Affairs Committee will seek qualitied candidates interested in such service to fill the position, hopefully by September 1977. 

2. 
To assure input of the minority concerns with the Student Affairs Committee of the Board of Trustees, on behalf of the Chairman of the Committee, I extend an invitation to the minority students to select three students as candidates for appoint­ment by the Chairman to the Committee. 

3. 
The Notre Dame Gospel Choir, having been duly recognized by the Student Activities Office, will be assisted in funding after a suggested budget has been presented to the Office of Student Affairs. 

4. 
The Office of Student Affairs will share the topics discussed and proposals suggested by the Black students to the various Directors under its jurisdiction. 


Finally, Notre Dame must not be a place where one group in any way considers itself better than another and I will vigorously oppose any prejudicial actions that· are brought to the attention of the Off1ce for Student Affairs.

COUP report determines use for monies from Campaign 
by Marti Hogau Edltor-ID-Chlef 

Editor's note: This Is the fourth lu a series of articles explaiDIDg the recommeudatlous of the COUP report aud their relation to the Campalgu for Notre Dame. 
Although endowed professor­

ships enhance the academic atmo­
sphere at Notre Dame, a great deal 
of emphasis is also placed on the 
academic support ofthe University. 
As a result the Campaign for Notre 
Dame plans to set aside 
$29,500,000, the second largest 
component of the $92 million 
endowment, for the support of 
these programs. 
Five areas are included in aca­

demic support: library endow­
ment, academic programs, compu­
ter center expansion, teacher deve­
lopment and University Press. 
One third of the academic sup­

port endowment, or $10 million, 
will go to supportUniversitylibrar­
ies. When the Memorial Library 
opened in 1963 it was the largest 
collegiate library building in the 
world. This is no longer true, but 
the physical facilities are still in 
good condition. The main focus of 
the library endowment will be on 
the collections of books in the 
libraries because of inflation in the 
cost of books. 
The Committee on Unviersity 

Priorities(COUP) noted: "We must 
be careful to conserve and improve 
our collection because a temporary 
erosion is bothdifficult and expen­
sive to repair." The University has 
moved to stop the deterioration of 
its collections by increasing the 
budget a1Jocation for the libraries. 
Notre Dame has already acted ona 
COUP recommendation by estab­
lishing a special endowment for 
University libraries. However, the 
Univeristy feels the need to further 
increase this endowment to offset 
rising costs of maintaining and pur­
chasing books and related materi­
als. 
Academic programs also serve 

an important function in academic 
disciplines. Therefore, the Cam-
The Edward Frederik Sorin A­ward of Notre Dame's Alumni Association will be presented this year to Edmund A. Stephan, the first lay chairman of the Univer­~itY's Board of Trustees. The , Chicago attorney will receive the award from Robert E. Dowd of Cleveland, national president, dur­ing the Reunion Banquet scheduled 
for June 4 on the campus. 
Named for the founder of the University, the Sorin Award is presented annually to an alumnus for distinguished service to Notre Dame and for leadership in his profession.

Benda cites

Dr. Ernst Benda, the president of the German Federal Constitu­tional Court, spoke about Human Rights under the German Federal Constitution, focusing his remarks upon the subject of abortion in West Germany to an audience of approximately 70 people last night in the C.C.E. auditorium. 
Despite the number of similar­ities between the German Court and the U.S. Supreme Court, each court has come to radically differ­ent conclusions regarding abortion. 
In the U.S. Jurisprudence, the Supreme Court has declined to specify exactly when human life begins and withholds altogether from the unborn child the rights enjoyed by all other citizens. In Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme Court struck down the state statutes forbidding abortion, permitting mothers to obtain abortions in the first trimester of their pregnancies. 
In 1974 the West German Bundestag. equivalent to the U.S. Congress, passed an abortion reform law. The Jaw effectively permitted mothers to obtain legal abortions from physicians in the first trimester. The next year the Constitutional Court declared the statute unconstitutional, based upon a pro-life provision in the Federal Constitution. 
The German Constitution speci­fically insures every person's right to Jive and protects the inviolability of the person. This is not derived from a construction of some article or clause, but is written directly into the document. 
Thus the 1974 law was over­turned and in 1976 the Bundestag passed a Jaw which reflects the Constitution's pro-life stand. The new law requires any woman seeking an abortion to first consult

a state abortion counseling clinic. At the clinic, the counselors try to persuade the mother to keep the child, recommending the various alternatives to abortion. They are required by the law to promote the pro-life position, something which could never be enforced under the laws in the U.S. 
An abortion may still be pro­cured though, if the woman's health should be endangered by the pregnancy, or if the child is going to be born defective. But mor.e importantly, the Court recog­nized the financial stake that physicians have in performing abortions. A woman seeking an abortion is not likely to be dis­suaded by her private physician if he stands to make money by performing the operation, the Court noted. . 
The German Court has recog­nized that at 14 days the fetus takes on human characteristics, and thus all the rights of German citizens guaranteed under the Constitution are accorded the unborn child.

the department of Communication 
Arts during the Summer Session 
beginning June 20 at Notre Dame. 
The new Oral English course, 
taught by Frederick Syburg of the

will include discussions and dem­
onstrations or "readers' theater," 
improvisation, oral paragraphs and 
themes, and related oral practices. 
Traditional courses, such as writ­

Voluntary SMC program 
Clinic improves writing 
Editor's note: 
This is the second of a four-part series on innovative educational programs at St. Mary's. Subse­quent articles will examine the Math Department's Personalized System of Instruction [PSI] pro­
gram and tandem courses between departments. 
by Jean Powley St. Mary's Editor 

St. Mary's Writing Oinic is now in its fifth semester of operation and business is booming. 
Since its creation in the spring of 1975 by a recent graduate, Mary Orr, the program has more than tripled its clientele and its staff bas grown to 14 tutors and a faculty advisor. 
Orr, a graduate student at Indi­ana University, noticed a serious lack of writing ability on the part of many students before the problem was widely publicized. She started the clinic to try to correct the situation. Her idea was to help each student individually with their specific writing problem. 
The stated purpose of the Wri­ting Qinic is threefold. It strives to "improve the writing of weak students (including foreign stu­dents) and to assist students seek­ing excellence in already compe­tent writing; to increase faculty interest in and knowledge of stu­dent writing problems; and to work in coordination with the Writing Proficiency program." 
Of special concern are foreign students who have gained little confirtence in handling problems with English. 
At present, attendance at the clinic is voluntary and open to all students. Students are either referred by their teachers or seek appointments on their own. Once an appointment has been made, students may choose to attend on a weekly basis to work on specific assignments, or to only go occa­sionally when they have special problems. 
The clinic worked with 56 stu­dents during the ten weeks of its existence in the spring of 1975. Last semester, however, it handled 169 students with writing difficul­ties. 
The program is now under the guidance of the Office of Academic Affairs, with advice from the English department. Linnea Vac­ca, assistant professor of English, is its faculty coordinator, and as such, is responsible for the selec­tion. training and supervision of !he program's student tutors. 
The tutorial staff of the clinic 
consists of 14 juniors and seniors, 
recommended as good writers and 
sympathetic human beings by 
members of the English depart­
ment. These tutors were trained in 
composition, grammar and the 
diagnosis and treatment of writing 
problems over the summer. Each 
tutor has the option of, working for a

Hang Up Your Hangups is an Ombudsman service which responds to questions received by the Ombuds­man relative to the interests of the ND community. Enlist the assistapce of affable and able troubleshooters by phoning 7638. If we can't help you, we'll find a sleuth who can. 
What is the Society for Creative Anachronism? Misty Lackey, the representative for the society, stated their unusual purpose: to recreate the Middle Ages "not as they were, but as they should have been." Chivalry, honor, virtue, sieges of the time are maintained within the 20th century by this conglomera­tion of misplaced kings, queens, knights, peasants, etc. The group was founded here in August 1975 and is affiliated with the National Council which originiated circa April 1966 in California. The society is currently co-sponsoring the Tolkien Lecture Series and welcomes any noble or virtuous souls who would feel more at home in a different time zone. You won't need a Time Machine to contact Misty at 232-6798. My roommate, the OearasU Campus King, is 
interested in the origin of the Ugly Man on Campus contest. Good for business resumes et al. A Notre Dame service fraternity, Alpha Phi Omega, has 
sponsored the UMOC contest upon recommendation of the National Organization. This organization's program is characterized by flexibility--coordinators of the Campus Blood Drive, social activities, future concession stands--in addition to the eccentric oppor­tunity for students to pledge money for their ugly honey. The UMOC contest originated four years ago with $200-$500 netted. Last year $1700 was collected; this year's total is estimated at $3000. This is one portion of the "services" offered by Alpha Phi Omega. Interested persons are. encouraged to call Dave Palmer (#1061) concerning membership in the fraternity. You don't have to look like Don Knotts to join. 
' What the devU is Angel Flight? And but another service organization based in the ND-SMC community for a number of years. Currently, Angel Flight is a reactivation of that former service club. Their projects (for cancer drives, volunteer help at nursing homes, Corvella House. etc.) are supple­mented by fund-raising activities: concession stands, parties, cc-sponsored films. Angel Flight is associated with Air Force ROTC. but membership is not limited to AFROTC cadets and personnel.· Mary Beth O'Grady (4-4556), the President-elect, notes that halos, wings. and dog-eared copies of The Littlest Angel are not mandatory for membership. 
V ocabphobiacs take heed: Zaftig is a word af Yiddish origin meaning:

a Yom Kippur casserole 

b) 
foolishly derived pleasure 

c)
