The University will provide free transporta­
tion to the Notre Dame/Purdue game at the Indiana Hoosier Stadium in Indianapolis Sept. H.

McDonnell then asked for the president's help in determining tht.· number of people who would use the transporta­tion. "since the game is designated as a home game, the University feels compelled to provide free transportation," McDonnell said. The possibility of chartering a train is being considered, but most students will make the three hour trip by bus. Also at the meeting, Keenan Hall announced that tickets for the Keenan Hall Revue will be distributed this Sunday. The show will be on Feb. I, 3, and 4.

How 'bout them Apples? 



So you've got an empty space on your desk that is just crying to be used for the latest in microcomputer tech­nology? The new Macintosh personal computer from Apple could dry those tears, but the price for the system -even with the substantial discount offered to Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students -merits a closer look at what one gets for his money. 
According to economics professor William Davisson, 
students will be able to walk away with a Macintosh for 
S 1.090. This base price includes the keyboard, a high resolution screen, one disk drive, some :1 1/2 inch dis­kettes and the infamous "mouse." A dot-matrix printer, almost a necessity, gocs for S404, so by the time you have that desk corner covered, your bank account will have been debited a grand total of $1 S16.89, plus tax. That's not bad, considering that regular retail buyers will pay more than twice that. Even the IBM PC costs 
S2,900 with the current University discount. 
Davisson says he was "very favorably impressed" by the new system, but he adds that he only used the com­puter for thirty minutes in help in the preparation ofwork? The College ofArts and Letters is planning to use the computers extensively, and other colleges are developing applications. In addi­tion, initial configurations for a campus computer net­work arc expected by late summer or early next year. 
Second, if a student is not using a microprocessor in courses, would the other functions -word processing or graphics, for example -justify the cost? 
Third, the student should ask himse t If if he actually wants to be computer literate. Is that important? 
Spencer holds no reserva­
tions about his answer to the 
last question. In his view. 

California. He has two 
Macintoshes on order. and 
he says until he receives and 
tests them that he would not 
be able to judge the com­
puter's merits. 
However, "if it lives up to 

its potential, it will be a fan­
tastic unit," he says. 
Richard Spencer, assistant provost for computing, believes the Macintosh is "probably the leader right now" in the personal com­puter market. "It's the knowledge of the operation 
of a microcomputer is vital 
because the machine has 
begun to enter all facets of life, both at. ,home and at work. "It wo~fd be difficult to be in the businessJworld without knowing something about a microcomputer," he believes. 
But it's the simplicity of the new Apple systems that seems to have Spencer sold. "Why become a computer expert?" he asks. "You 

friendliest computer I've ever seen. You could probably use it without even opening a book." 
Hut for those who think that the Macintosh is not something for serious users who would just as soon not use a hand-held rodent, let it be known that the unit boasts a 32 bit processor, the largest used in personal computers. Apple's newest aiso comes with 128K of RAM ( Applc will expand this to 512K by the middle of the year) and 64K ofROM. 
"One hundred fifty companies are writing software for the Mac, and Microsoft (a software leader) has com­mitted 50 percent of its resources to developing software for the new computer. Their view is that it will be around for awhile," says Spencer. 
Yet Davisson views the system a little more cautious­ly. "If they (the companies) do a good job, yes. If they don't, forget it," he says. 
Spencer suggests students ask themselves three ques­tions to determine whether the computer is worth the expense. First, ifa computer is part ofa course, will it 
shouldn't have to know programming. Our en­thusiasm for the Macintosh 
is that it's friendly; it's an adjunct to what a person does, a tool that helps the person do his job, like a calculator or a telephone. Apple calls them bicycles of the mind." 
Fifteen hundred dollars seems expensive for a bicycle, too, but both men advise students to wait and try the computer when it arrives at the new computer store in approximately three weeks. "It's definitely worth checking into," says Davisson.

Reagan to endorse space station 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON President 
Reagan will endorse in his State of 
the Union speech tonight a manned 
orbiting station as the cornerstone 
of his Nation's Future In Space, 
government sources reported Tues­
day. 
The station, to be operational ear­ly in the next decade, would signal a permanent U.S. presence in space and could expand to such objectives as a manned lunar base and expedi­tions to Mars, said the sources, who asked to remain anonymous. 
There was no comment from the White House or the National Aeronautics and Space Administra­tion. However, NASA has scheduled a news briefing tomorrow on "State of the Union proposals." 
White House Science Adviser 
George A. Keyworth said recently 
that the p .resident wants to 
"recapture the vision ofApollo" and 
maintain U.S. leadership in space at a 
time when the Soviet Union is pursu­
ing ambitious space plans. 
A bold commitment to a long­range program centered on a space s t tation would be the first major space declaration by the United States since President Kennedv declared in I 961 that an America~ should land on the Moon before the end ofthat decade. 
As a down payment on the $8 bil­lion station, Reagan is asking for about $I 50 million in his proposed 


Pope appoints bishop for Boston 
Associated Press 
BOSTON -Pope John Paul II, starting a series of appointments to reshape the U.S. catholic Church, reached into rural Missouri yester­day to find a new bishop for Boston: Bernard Law, orthodox in doctrine but active in relations between races and faiths. 
Law, 52, bishop of 52,000 Cat­holics in the Springfield-Cape Girar­deau diocese in the largely Protestant cattle and farm country of the Missouri Ozarks, was named spiritual leader of the nation's third­largest Catholic archdiocese. He succeeds Cardinal Humberto Medeiros, who died last fall. 
A Harvard graduate, Law made his mark as a civil rights leader in Missis­sippi in the 1960s and has been in 
the  forefront  of  the  Catholic  
church's efforts to  embrace  Epis­ 
copal priests.  

With his ability to speak Spanish, Law is expected to help unify the blacks, Hispanics, Irish and Italians who make up the bulk of 2 million Catholics in the Boston archdiocese. 
"While the archdiocese is my primary responsibility, I look for­ward to working with the leaders of other Christian communities, Jewish religious leaders, and public officials ofthe Boston area as togeth­er we serve the common good," Law said. 
Asked how he wants to be 
received in Boston, Law replied: "I 
come as a man offaith, a deep faith. I 
also come as a man of hope. I know 
it's 1984, but I think George Orwell 
was wrong." Plans call for his instal­
lation in Boston's Cathedral of the 
Holy Cross on March 23. 
Medeiros had spoken quietly but firmly for social and racial justice, and led opposition to the violence against school busing in Boston. During his 13-year tenure, Medeiros also paid offpart ofthe reported $42 million debt ofthe diocese by selling

fiscal 1985 budget, which goes to Congress Feb. 1, the sources said. 
Preliminary 1985 spending projections given earlier this month to Republican Congressmen by Budget Director David Stockman show the administration wants to add $6 billion to NASA's budget over the next five years, principally for developing a station. That is a large increase for an agency whose budget has been between $6 billion and $7 billion annually and which has seen some lean y .ears since the glory days of the Apollo moon flights. 
The sources said Reagan, in his speech, will urge Congress to sup­port a station as a means of moving the United States ahead commercial­ly and technologicaly in space.

Eastern Airlines cited for safety violations 

Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -A government safety board yesterday finished its probe of last May's near-ditching in­to the Atlantic ofan Eastern Airlines jumbo jet, faulting the airline and federal officials for failing to uncover and correct serious maintenance lapses. 
The National Transportation Safety Board said Federal Aviation Administration inspectors missed errors that led to a dozen cases where engines on Eastern jets had to be cut in flight. The engines lost oil when critical seals were not in­stalled properly or at all. 
Such an oversight occurred in May, causing an Eastern L-1011 jet­liner to lose all three engines and come within minutes of ditching in the ocean. The plane was saved when one ofthe engines was restart· ed. Investigators found that mec­hanics forgot to put the seals on the three failed engines. 
But members of the NTSB at a hearing on the Eastern incident con­cluded Tuesday that the case reflected serious safety monitoring problems at Eastern and at the FAA, which has three full inspectors as­signed to the carrier. 
"We feel it is not simply enough to punish the mechanics involved when we had management people that were not developing a system that would be foolproof," said NTSB chairmanJim Burnett. 
Investigators found Eastern had 12 cases between September 1981 and last May where engines were cut in flight because of a loss of oil traced to problems with the seals ­so-called "0" rings. 
Still, said board member Vernon Grose. "neither the FAA or Eastern seemed to be concerned right up to May 19H3." Each incident was reported and examined separately, but neither management nor FAA in· spectors considered the problem a pattern requiring changes in main· tenance procedures. 
The board wrote a strongly worded letter Tuesday, rebuking the FAA for not interpreting the separate incidents as a signal ofbroader main· tenance problems and doing some· thing to assure the "o" rings are always installed. 
But after objections by several board members that some ofthe Ian· guage should be changed and that other parts of the letter are filled with "awful rhetoric that confounds the issue," the board put off a final vote on the letter. 
But several board members said the central criticsm of the FAA and Eastern are not in dispute and the NTSB is expected in its final report to call for the FAA to improve its monitoring ofair safety. 
The FAA has inspectors assigned to all carriers, but several safety ex­perts recently questioned whether the agency is doing enough to guard against some carriers ignoring government safety regulations. Several congressmen have called for hiring more inspectors because the administration in the past three years has cut its inspector force by 16 percent and plans more cuts this year. 
Transportaion Secretary Elizabeth Dole last month ordered the FAA to re-examine its safety actiVIties, including inspection and surveil­lance, but contends the agency's in­spector force is adequate.

Easy solution to car cover-up 
Students who chose to leave their cars 
here over the holidays probably wish 
they hadn't. 
Several students returned to find their cars either surrounded or buried by snow which University-owned plows had left as a Christmas present. 
John Moorman, director of main­tenance, says the cars are "a real problem" for the snowplows, especially after major snowstorms. Moving the cars would take more time than plowing the lots. 
And the quality of the University's equipment does not help matters any. To move' the snow, the plows must gain some speed -something which is hard to do ,when dodging cars. 
Students have their share ofcomplaints as well. Many fly home for break or car­pool to save money, and never think twice about leaving their cars in the lots. 
Many return to find their cars buried, if not damaged by piles of snow. Though security and maintenance are both wil­ling to help students dig out, they may have more important things to do. And some officers are physically unable to shovel snow (it isn't exactly in their job description). 
The easiest solution would be to set 
aside an area in one of the lots a few days 
before finals. With a little publicity, stu­
dents would be more than happy to move 
cars rather than be plowed under. 
Glenn Terry, director of security, says they've tried a similar scheme before without much success. Terry says they'd never achieve 100 percent compliance, and that estimating the number of cars and the size of the space needed would be a chore. 
But it seems the idea would save the departments tiine, ifanything. The plows would be able to clear the lots faster, security would have fewer parking lots to patrol, and nobody would have to help the students dig out after the fact. 
Even if some students didn't comply, they would have no one but themselves to blame. 
So let's hope the University takes some time now to settle the problem. After all, an ounce ofprevention is worth a pound ofcure.

Miss Manners 

The professor as captain of his class 
by Judith Martin 
D
ear Miss Manners,-I am a college professor and what bothers 
me more than the apathy and laziness ofsome students is their 
classroom manners. Particularly, I am referring to those who chew 
gum in class, those who sit and blow and/orpop the bubbles in front 
of the teacher who is trying to lecture and concentrate on getting a 
message across to those who do care and are in class to learn. 
One day, after having had it happen many times, I asked a young 
lady to please refrain from blowing bubbles and to keep the gum in 
her mouth. When it happened again, I asked her to please remove 
herselffrom the room and deposit the gum in the trash can, or, better 
yet, to remove it before entering the classroom. She acted insulted 
and as if her inalienable rights had been violated. I had embarrassed 
her but had asked her quietly. 
Please say something to remind millions ofstudents that this is very rude and annoying to the teacher. The same goes for chewing candy and drinking pop while the professor is trying to keep their undivided attention. 
Ifthey find the lectures boring, they needn't bother to come to 
class. Sleeping is even better than these annoying mannerisms. Per­
haps I speak for many other professors. 
I've thought about using the tactic that an old high school teacher 
once used. Those who were caught chewinggum in class had to buy 
a package ofpeanuts for everyone in class. But this would not work 
with my student and would be rather childish.Just a gentle reminder 
from you may cause them to think ofthe rightsofothers. At least it's 
worth a try. 
Gentle Reader -Miss Manners will certainly endorse and help 
teach the rule that classroom decorum, for students ofany age, re­quires sitting still with the appearance ofpaying rapt attention and 
refraining from activities, such as eating, drinking or gum chewing, that may distract others. (College students, unlike youngpupils, may claim that they can concentrate best with their eyes closed.) 
Through the high school level, it should be established that the teacher has the right to impose suh restrictionsas part ofthe instruc­tion. 
On the college level, it should be established that attendance of classes is a privilege that may haughtily withdrawn by the professor if, like a judge orsea captain, he finds his not unreasonable standards ofbehavior violated. That should end the nonsense about in­alienable rights. Your student has the inalienable right to behave as she wishes aft you have thrown her out ofclass. 
Dear Miss Manners -My problem lies in the general category of 
whether rules that have become outmoded because their practical 
need no longer exists should continue to be honored in the face of 
declining popular behavior. Is it still necessary for a gentleman al­
ways to walk on the curb side when escorting a lady on the 
sidewalk? 
It is vexing to accompany today's modern woman and duck be­
hind her to change sides at a corner, only to have her odge in the 
same direction, mistaking thinking I plan a change in course. This 
forces me to run to head her off .Or, worse yet, modem women will 
stop conversing in mid-sentence and look wildly about, as if I had 
suddenly flown away, and then sullenly drag their handbag to the 
other side as if it were filled with cement. 
Changing sides is a omplicated maneuver, made more difficult 
without the cooperation ofthe ladies. Perhaps the entire custom 
should be discontinued. 
GentleReader-Perhaps. But let us hear no more about abandon­
ing courtesies simply because there is no pratical need for them. 
That would include most ofthe civilized refinements and kindnesses 
tht comprise our standards ofbest behavior. 
Etiquette. Miss Manners keeps trying to explain, is folk custom. 
When it changes, it generally does so because a certain gesture has 
fallen into disuse to the extent that most people neither practice nor 
understand it. 
The custom ofthe gentlema walking on the outside may, indeed 
he well on its way toward oblivioR. Miss Manners can understad 
your reluctance to continue practicing it with ladies who are only 
bewildered by it. 
But it is not gone altogether. To the many ofus who are familiar 
with it, it remains a charminglittle courtesy, indeed impractical, but 
all the more valuable because it is associated with a disappearing 
grace. On such as Miss Manners, you would be well advised to con­
tinue.

"Silver Rainbow" is another group effort along the same lines as "Taking It All too Hard." 
The ftnal cut on the album, "It's Gonna Get Better," was the flip side to the EP single, Mama, released before the album. The song begins with a Banks keyboard intro. He uses his synthesizer to give the individual notes a long attack and a sharp decay. This results in a sound that could otherwise be achieved by playing an album backwards. While this sound is not unique, it has not been a Genesis mainstay. One of the few other times where Banks used it was in collaboration with Phil Col­lins on Anthony Phillips' solo album

Sims trial scheduled for today 
Associated Press 
DETROIT The trial to determine where Billy Sims will continue his professional football career begins in federal court today with franchises in rival leagues claiming his services. 
U.S. District Judge Robert E. DeMascio will decide whether Sims continues with the Detroit Lions of the National Football League or moves to the Houston Gamblers of the United States Football League. 

The brilliant running hack has signed five-year contracts with each. 
Sims signed a S3.5 million con­tract with the Gamblers on july 1 and an undated agreement Nov. 12, the USFL team said. He got $197,608 in july as part ofa S 1 million signing bonus, the Gamblers said. He also signed a S5 million pact with the Lions Dec. 16, that team said. 
Suits were filed in various cQUrts 
both in Michigan and in Texas, but 
they eventually landed in federal 
court at the request ofall parties be­
cause of the geographical diversity 
ofthe principals. 
The basic suit has been split into 
two parts. 
One is the question ofwhich con­tract Sims must honor. Then, if DeMascio decides that the Lions' contract with Sims is valid, there may be a separate trial to determine whether Argovitz and the Gamblers 

owe the Lions damages. But for now the question of con­tracts is the only issue. 
Elbert Hatchett, Sims' attorney. said that the case would take about a day and a half. Attorneys for the Gamblers, however, feel it could last up to five days. 
Hatchett said that he would call Sims, Argovitz, and "people who were present when the contracts were signed."

LOS ANGELES-Los Angeles resi­dents, who treated the Raiders with casual indifference during most of their two years here, turned out in force yesterday to honor the Super Bowl champions. 
A crowd put at 25,000 to 30,000 greeted members ofthe team during a noontime rally on the steps ofCity Hall in crowded downtown. 
"This magnificent team has brought the city together like never before in history," Mayor Tom Brad­ley said. "... Sunday's victory was a clear demonstration of a commit­ment to excellence." 
The Raiders -22 players at­tended the civic celebration under clear skies and warm weather ­were given keys to the city and proclamations from the City Coun­cil and the county Board of Super­visors. The crowd jammed onto a lawn outside City Hall and others watched the festivities from nearby office buildings -both from inside them and on rooftops. 
Three popular Raiders spoke to the crowd, many dressed in the

"I am in love with Los Angeles," said running back Marcus Allen, the Super Bowl MVP. "I'm extremely excited· to have everyone here to celebrate the world championship we brought back to L.A. The L.A. Raiders are here to stay." 
Allen, who gained a Super Bowl­record 191 yards in Sunday's 38-9 victory over the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl XVIII, was the crowd favorite. The former Heis­man Trophy winner from the Uni­versity of Southern California was serenaded by that school's marching band, which entertained before the ceremony. 
Defensive lineman Lyle Alzado, who perhaps symbolizes the Raider spirit more than any other player, told the crowd he had been waiting a long time for a championship. 
"It's a great experience," he said. "There's nothing like a world cham­pionship. Enjoy the world cham­pionship." 
Derrick Jensen, who scored the first touchdown Sunday after block­ing a Redskin punt, said the title was "a result ofthe drive and dedication 
of (owner) AI Davis and (coach) Tom Flores." Davis did not attend yesterday's celebration, but Flores did. 
"This (the crowd's response) is unbelievable," said Flores, who has guided the club to two Super Bowl titles in four years. "The excitement of this crowd s)lowed in our locker room every day. We have taken over Los Angeles as our home." 
Rich Marotta, a Raiders' radio an-. nouncer and emcee for the celebra­tion, quoted police as saying the crowd was the largest ever to honor one of the city's championship sports teams. 
The crowd interrupted Bradley when he tried to introduce political figures, chanting "Raiders! Raiders! Raiders!" 
Bradley suggested last week that the NFL should give Oakland an ex­pansion team to replace the Raiders, who moved here two years ago after a bitter court fight that still is being waged. Yesterday's crowd made it clear the town's sports fans certainly won't let the Raiders go without a struggle.

HOUSTON -Athletic directors at collegiate football powers Notre Dame and Texas are trying to scheduk a home-and-home series, probably in the mid 1990's.

The two teams have met eight times prt·viously, with Notre Dame winning six of the contests. 
Texas would replace Penn State on an Irish schedule which already includes football powerhouses Michigan, Southern California Alabama, and Pittsburgh, according to Corrigan. 
"There's no way we're going to play Penn State and Texas in the same season, not with all the other tough games we have," he said.

DiSabato, a 142-pounder, won a 
major decision with his 18-8 tri­

Although the results may not look 

good, coach Toth-Fejel was happy 
with the scores. 
"Both schools are always powers every year in wrestling," said Toth­Fejel, "and I was very pleased with the two wins we got against each team. I really thought they would blow us out." 
"The only way for a growing program like ours to improve is to compete against teams like those two," continued Toth-FejeL 
Last weekend the Irish travelled to Michigan for the Siena Heights In­vitational. 
Coach Toth-Fejel guided the Irish to an impressive showing, with three Irish wrestlers winning their weight divisions and five placing second. 
This Saturday the westling team will travel to Ohio to compete in th t e National Catholic Collegiate Tournament. They will bring a 13-3 team record into the tourney.

Lake Forest tonight 


Hockey team set to defend streak 
By ED DOMANSKY 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame hockey team will put its perfect 1S-0-0 mark on the line as it travels to Lake Forest tonight to take on the Division II var­sity Foresters. 
The last time the two teams met was in December. In the home-and­home series, Notre Dame won the opener on its home ice by a S-2 score. Tim Lukenda had 31 saves in the Irish goal to pick up the win. 
The next night the teams faced off in Lake Forest, and again Notre Dame came away a S-2 winner. AI Haverkamp held the Foresters scoreless through twf>-and-a-half periods, stopping 47 shots in ear-

ning the victory. 
The line of Adam Parsons, Mike Metzler, and co-captain Brent Chap­man were responsible for seven of 
the  ten  Notre  Dame goals in  the  
series.  
When  the  Irish  take  the  ice  
tonight, they will  be without  the  

services of Steve Ely and Tom Parent. Both are serving suspensions for game disqualification penalties received in the St. Norbert series over the weekend. On top of this, Gary Bec~er and Dave Waldbillig will possibly miss the game because of shoulder injuries suffered in last Saturday's victory over the Green Knights. 
"We're going to be a little bit shor­thanded," says Head Coach Lefty Smith, "but hopefully we'll be able to accept the challenge." 
There will be at least one change in the lineup tonight. That change will have co-captain Joe Bowie moving from defense to play left wing on the line with Tim Reilly and Rick Kennedy. 
"Lake Forest is a fine club," says Smith. "We had two excellent games with them in December. Both clubs have respect for one another, so it should be a good game." 
Smith tentatively has Lukenda penciled in as his starting goalten­der, but admits that there is a pos­sibility that he will go with Haverkamp.
