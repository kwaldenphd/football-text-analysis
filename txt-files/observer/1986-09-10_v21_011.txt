ND-subway lawsuit to go to court 
By CHRIS SKORCZ 
Senior Staff Reporter 
The lawsuit filed by the Univer­sity of Notre Dame against the Fighting Irish Subway Alumni As­sociation is expected to go to court sometime this spring, said Philip Faccenda, general counsel for the University. 
Claiming unlawful use of a federally-registered trademark, the University filed suit in federal court against the Subway Alumni Association in April 1985. Her­bert Juliano. former long-term employee of the University and founder of the Subway Alumni Association, likened the legal battle to a "David and Goliath" confrontation. 
"All my members are distressed and distraught that Notre Dame chose to attack us," said Juliano. "We expected to be welcomed with open arms not viewed as outcasts. Now, the Uni­versity is dragging us through court until they force us into bankruptcy." 
The Subway Alumni Associa­tion, founded in spring 1984 by Juliano, who was then employed in the Athletic Department, has been supported lately by Juliano's personal finances. Juliano, who referred to himself as "a giver, not a taker" during his thirty-six years of service to the University, said that he is forced to live on $400 per month, partially on Social Secur­ity and personal savings. Be­cause of the financial burden of operating the Subway Alumni As­sociation, whose membership has dropped 50 percent in the wake of the University's lawsuit, Juliano said that he will not spend any more of his own "meager life savings" on the As­sociation. 
Faccenda explained that the University has very good reason for filing suit against the Fighting Irish Subway Alumni Associa­tion. He said that the University

SYR schedule considered last night byHPC 
By J CHRISTOPHER MURPHY 
News Staff 
Last night's meeting of the Hall Presidents' Council sparked a discussion concerning the exten­sion of parietals and University policy regarding off-campus ac­tivities. 
HPC attempted to alleviate the problem of ten SYR's scheduled on the same weekend by having dorms attempt to change the dates of their dances. The real discussion arose concerning the extension of parietals and the possibility of having the dances on football weekends. 
According to several ha11 presi­dents, the office of John Goldrick, associate vice presi­dent for residence life, recom­mended that rectors do not en­courage SYR's in general and discouraged an extension of parietals for the functions. 
Rector and rectress complaints of having to place resident assis­tants at dorm entrances and also at off campus dances was the argument against holding off­campus dances on football weekends. 
In other HPC news, hall presi­dents John Walsh of Dillon, Frank Publicovcr of Keenan and Jim Ryan of Morrissey are plan­ning to speak with Goldrick con­cerning the University's state­ments on SYR's and alcohol policy for off-campus student residents. 
Joanie Cahill, HPC co-chairman, said, "We want stu­dents to be aware of the situation regarding University policy and police actions in off-campus ac­tivities.·: 
HPC is implementing the "Adopt A Section" campaign in hopes of sparking more interhall activities. The program is de­signed to have one section from each dorm to be paired with a section from another dorm to get together for social and athletic events.

Study lounges are for studying
In Brief 
A former University of Southern California employee has admitted to tapping into the campus computer system during a period of two years, apparently tampering with students' grades in return for money. USC administrators think 43 students paid the employee and two others to fix their grades. Since the scheme was uncovered last spring. 14 USC students have been expelled and the records of another 14 have been put on hold, pending further investigation. -The Observer

Former President Ford can't seem to shake his reputation for clumsiness. Ford was in the Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Hills Monday to speak at a fund-raiser for Jim Dunn, the Republican candidate for the 6th Congressional District. When he finished taking questions from reporters, Ford smiled and backed into a low-hanging chandelier. He wasn't hurt but the incident added to his list of minor accidents that have ranged from getting knocked over by a chair lift while skiing to hitting a spectator with a golf drive to stumbling on an airplane ramp. -Associated Press 
Geraldine Ferraro's stay on the Columbia University faculty was brief -just long enough for the university to announce that she would teach a course, and then announce that she had canceled. The former congresswoman and Democratic vice-presidential candidate had agreed to teach a course on "Critical Issues of Public Policy" for graduate students at Co­lumbia's School of International and Public Affairs. The school put out a news release quoting Ferraro as saying she was excited by the prospect of working with graduate students this fall. But on Monday, Columbia officials said Ferraro had backed out. Carol Vacchione, her spokeswoman, said the change was made because "her plans have changed ... She had personal reasons." She would not elaborate. -Associated

While some students like to get a head start on their schoolwork, that's not the reason why more than 80 Notre Dame freshmen are expected to be in study lounges this week. 
They'll be living in them but only for awhile, 
Because ofoverfilled dorms, about 84 freshmen will temporarily reside in study lounges in Flan­ner, Grace and Sarin halls, according to Evelyn Reinebold, director of student residences. -The Observer/Aug. 2.3, 1986 
Room 400 Grace looks much like any other freshman room. There are pictures of girlfriends, a campus map and a poster of a semi-clad woman posted on the wall. There are at least two stereos, a homemade shelf and a computer set up. 
But something about this room is different from most freshman rooms. Newspapers cover large windows facing the lobby. There's no refrigerator and no sink. 
Room 400 is a study lounge. But it's home to Dave Temeles, Tim Crawford, James Dailey and Steve McLaughlin. 
"The lo~ation is not too great" said Temeles. "On Emil 'night they knew where we were and threw a firecracker under the door. 
"But the room is good sized. And it's great for parties. 
"We get along very well and we do a lot to­gether," said Temeles. "We've all got similar in­terests too. Most of them are over at Saint Mary's." 
Temeles, like Crawford, Dailey and McLaughlin, has lived in Room 400 for almost two weeks now. He is waiting for Student Residences to find him a permanent room. 
Once it does, he'll move away. Probably to an­other dorm. And most likely without Crawford, Dailey or McLaughlin. 
"We kind pf upset about that" Temeles said. "It's an unfortunate situation. We like each other and the room isn't really too bad. And Grace is a pretty good hall. 
"We would like to get into the dorm life," Temeles said. "But it's kind of hard to get into dorm life when you're in a study lounge." 
They're not alone. About 50 other freshmen are living in study lounges as well. 
Student Residences will begin moving these freshmen into permanent rooms as soon as it gets a list of spaces left open by student "no shows," said Reinebold. If 50 spaces aren't avail­able, then some of the freshmen will have to wait until other students move off campus or leave the University, she said. 
Now, there may or may not be 50 students that didn't show up. If there are, then fantastic. Move the freshmen out so they can begin making friends at their new dorms. 
If there aren't 50 openings, Student Residences should do something more than just waiting for students to transfer or move off campus. 
One idea is for the University to rent part of a luxury apartment complex off campus. It then could offer students the opportunity to live there at the same cost as living in a dorm room. Stu­dents would jump at the opportunity, thereby freeing up on-campus housing for freshmen. 


Fiscally unsound, some would say. Unworkable. 
Ludicrous. 

But not to administrators at Emory University in Atlanta, Ga. Like Notre Dame, Emory couldn't provide enough on-campus housing for its stu­dents this year. So it adopted the luxury-apartment plan, and its housing problem disappeared. 
Of course, one shouldn't expect Notre Dame to rent part of an apartment complex so that fresh­men wouldn't have to live in study lounges. But one would expect Notre Dame to institute a varia­tion on Emory's idea. 
If a shortage of on-campus housing exists, Stu­dent Residences would offer students an incentive to move off campus. The incentive could be a tuition break, a discounted meal plan or hard cash. The incentive would be increased until enough students accepted the offer and moved off campus. 
Obviously, Notre Dame would have to spend some money to institute this plan. That might make it unappealing to some fiscally-minded ad­ministrators. 
But the University was willing to spend millions to improve student life by renovating Lafortune and several dorms. Certainly, the University could spend a little more so freshmen wouldn't have to languish in study lounges. 
But in the meantime, Temeles, like his room­mates and about 50 others, will wait for the day he must pack up and leave his friends behind. 
"I don't think we'll get out of here until October or Christmas," Temeles said. "Maybe they'll give us a Christmas gift and get us out of here."

STUDENT· ALUMNI PRE-PROFESSIONAL RELATIONS SOCIETY GROUP 
Sexual violence against women subject of lecture series at SMC 
By 'MARGIE KERSTEN 
Saint Mary's Editor 
"It Happens to Everyone: Sexual Violence against Women, Children and Men," is the topic of programs being offered at Saint Mary's this week and next. 
Pat Rissmeyer, director of residence life and housing at the College said the idea for these programs originated from the Se~ Offense Staff at the Madison Center in South Bend. Rissmeyer said a Campus Alliance for Rape Elimination group was formed consisting ofstudents from Saint Mary's, Indiana University-South Bend, Notre Dame and Bethel College. The group met last spring and this summer, with Saint Mary's developing a com­mittee to initiate a week long se­ries. 
Earlier this semester, each Saint Mary's student received a letter from Rissmeyer co­authored by a Saint Mary's stu­dent who wished to remain anonymous. Last semester the student was raped by a Notre Dame student. 
The letter said, "she met the man in much the same way you meet Notre Dame men-at a gat­hering of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students. Their first date was typical. He called and asked her to attend a dance sponsored by the University." The letter con­tinued, saying the Saint Mary's student attended the dance and afterwards agreed to go back to the man's room, where, "the man became very aggressive, pinned her down to the bed and raped her." 
The letter was a request from the student because she wants 
'students to give serious thought to their dating behavior and their vulnerability, Rissmeyer said. She said the student wanted to write the letter last semester, after the incident, but Rissmeyer and the committee decided to wait until they had programs for students to discuss their con­cerns about rape. 
Tonight's program is called the "The Dating Game." A student panel from Notre Dame and Saint Mary's will discuss their own per­ceptions of what dating is like in the Saint Mary'S'Notre Dame community, focusing on blind dates, SYR's, expectations, and values as well as a discussion with the audience. 
Tomorrow the "Medical and Legal Issues of Sexual Assault" will explain what happens to rape victims from the hospital to the court room. A panel of commu­nity professionals will present medical and legal information about rape, child molestation, incest, and sexual harassment. 

Sunday will continue the series with "Child Sexual Abuse and In­cest." Rissmeyer said this will es­pecially pertain to those students in teaching, nursing, social work and psychology majors and help them recognize signs in children who have been victimized. 
"Tell Someone" is next Mon­day's program which deals with harassment on thejob and in the classroom. A videotaoe and dis­cussion of different situations will help students know what rights they have. 
"To conclude the week in a very positive and prayerful way," the last program next Tuesday is the 'Non-Violence Approach'," Rissmeyer said. 
Rissmeyer said a student inter­ested in attending all the workshops is eligible to receive a program certificate. It will in­dicate that the student has received a basic introduction to the issues of sexual violence. It will be signed by. the SOS of Madison Center and the Dean of Student Affairs, she said. 
All programs begin at 6:45 
p.m.  in  Stapleton  Lounge  of

American educator kidnapped by Islamic Jihad group in Beirut 
Associated Press 
BEIRUT, Lebanon -An Ameri­can who runs a private school in Beirut was kidnapped by two armed men while on his way to play golf yesterday, and a caller claimed responsibility in the name of the Shiite Moslem group Islamic Jihad. 
It was the first kidnapping of an American in Lebanon in 15 months. 
The U.S. embassy identified the victim as Frank Herbert Reed, 53, of Malden, Mass., director of the Lebanese International School in Moslem west Beirut. 
A spate of politically motivated kidnappings in west Beirut in 1985 prompted most Americans and other Westerners to leave the city. 
A school associate said Reed has lived in Lebanon about eight years and had converted to Islam before marrying Sahmiya Dalati, a Syrian. The associate, who in­sisted on anonymity. said the couple have a five-year old son. Tareq. 
Islamic Jihad, which espouses the fundamentalist teachings of Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, has said it holds at least three other American hostages. 
U.S. embassy spokesman Christopher English said the em­bassy "does not have many details about it (the kidnapping) now." 
At the State Department in Washington, spokesman Ber­nard Kalb said, "We call on those who may be holding Mr. Reed as well as the other foreign hostages in Lebanon to release their captives immediately. We remind them further that we hold them responsible for the well­being of their captives." 
Police quoted family friends as saying Reed was kidnapped at 
I I: 15 a.m. near the ruins of a supermarket in west Beirut's Bir Hassan district while driving from his west Beirut home to play golf at the city's outskirts. 
Gunmen in a dark blue Volvo intercepted Reed's car a few hundred yards from the headquarters of Syrian intelli­gence officers supervising a se­curity plan for west Beirut, police said.

An anonymous caller claiming to speak for Islamic Jihad, which means Islamic Holy War, claimed in a call to a Western news agency that Reed was a CIA spy and that "documents convicting him" were found on him. 
An editor at the news agency said the call was in Lebanese­accented Arabic and that the cal­ler hung up after reading a state­ment. The Christian-controlled Voice of Lebanon radio said the man promised to distribute Reed's photograph soon. 
Islamic Jihad has cautioned repeatedly that any statement purporting to come from it with­out a hostage photograph would be false. 
Other American hostages held by Islamic Jihad are Terry Ander­son, 38, of Lorain, Ohio, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press; David Jacobsen, 55, of Huntington Beach, Calif., director of the American University Hospital; and Thomas Sutherland, 55, of Fort Collins, Colo., acting dean ofthe university's agriculture fac­ulty.

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa Three black insurgents, includ­ing a 19-year-old convicted in a bombing that killed five whites, were hanged yesterday after refusing to seek clemency. 
U.S. civil rights leader Caretta Scott King, meanwhile, canceled a meeting with President P. W. Botha at the last minute. She an­nounced her decision a day after leading anti-apartheid activists said they would not see her if she met with Botha. 
The execution of the rebels, members of the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla group, caused little public out­cry. Previous executions of ANC members prompted worldwide condemnation and appeals for clemency. 
The three Sibusiso Andrew Zondo, Simho Bridget Xulu and Clarence Lucky Payi were hanged at Pretoria Central Prison at 7 a.m., said Supreme Court Registrar Martin van der Wes­thuizen. 
He said three other convicted 
murderers also were executed. 
South Africa executes about I00 
people a year, most of them con­
victed murderers. 
The Sowetan, a Johannesburg newspaper for black readers, quoted relatives and defense at­torneys as saying the con­denmed men did not want a last­minute appeal to delay the executions. 
They were in good spirits and singing freedom songs on the eve of their executions, the 

lawyers were quoted as saying. 
"They told us not to worry be­
cause they were dying for their 
own people," the Sowetan 
quoted one relative as saying. 
Zondo's lawyer, Bheki Shezi, 
said his client's final message 
was that "the revolutionary loves 
his life but knows that life is not 
the end itself." Zondo was 19. 
About 40 people turned out for 
a memorial service for the three in a Johannesburg chapel. The Rev. Sol Jacobs said Zondo, Xulu and Payi "have given their lives in the fight for freedom in our land. They died in the belief that · they were working for the libera­
tion of their neighbor." 
Zondo was convicted in April 
in the Dec. 23 bombing at a 
shopping center south of Dur­
ban. Two women and three chil­
dren were killed and 48 others 
wounded. 
Zondo did not testify in his tri­
al. The trial judge noted that 
Zondo had acknowledged to a  
magistrate that he planted the 
bomb but intended only to 
wound people. 
Xulu and Payi were convicted 
last February in the May 1984 as­
sassination of a former student 
leader who had turned against 
the African National Congress. 
Their ages were not available. 
The United Democratic Front. 
the country's largest anti­
apartheid coalition, said Monday 
that "going on with the hangings 
can only be seen as immoral and 
unjust. There is nothing in this 
act that promotes reconcilia­
tion."

Blacks may suffer from anti-apartheid policy 
For the past two years, in places as diverse as the pages of the Observer and the halls of Congress and practically everywhere else in between, Americans have been debating overjust what we can do to force the South African government to end its practice of apartheid. Now, it seems we have finally decided on an an­swer: punitive economic sanctions coupled with the threat of total divest­ment ifthings do not change in the future. With the overwhelming vote in the Senate in favor of this policy, even President Reagan will be forced to agree with it. 
Adam Milani 
a closer look 
... 
But what are the consequences of such a policy? Even the people who support it admit that the blacks whom we are sup­posedly trying to help will suffer most because of it. Blacks in South Africa and surrounding African states will lose jobs, homes, and lives. A missionary in Lesotho told NBC News this summer that severe sanctions could result in the loss of an additional 50,000 lives to hunger and malnutrition among the children of miners laid-off from gold and diamond mines. Meanwhile, South African whites will feel few, if any, effects because the government we are attacking has already gone on the defensive and stockpiled both economic and military resources. 
If this is the case, and most agree it is, who then benefits from this policy? The disturbing answer is that the sole bene­ficiary is the American people, specifically the American moral conscience that is always looking for the most easily reached safe harbor. If the situation in South Africa does continue to deteriorate into the civil war that so many predict, we can stand self-righteously apart from

the right way, but they just wouldn't lis­
ten," or, if we hilve totally divested, "Hey, 
it's not our fault. They didn't have our 
support. We pulled completely out of 
there ages· ago." 
Self-righteousness after the fact of a civil war, however, will quite obviously not solve today's problems in South Africa. The time has come for us to realize that, politically, the U.S. has very little power in South Africa, and that the apar­theid situation cannot be paralleled with the U.S. civil rights movement. We cannot force the Pretoria government to institute changes in apartheid because unlike the 
U.S. of the 1950's and 60's, there is no significant governmental and popular support for change in South Africa. P. W. Botha does not have a Bobby Kennedy willing to call out the national guard to defend the rights of blacks against bigoted whites. Conversely, he is using the police to put down continued unrest among blacl\s whom he says have no rights. Even then he is criticized by mem­bers of his own party for being too soft on them. 
Our generation has been told that we learned in Vietnam that even the use of military might is not necessarily success­ful in forcing our values on people who are willing to go to the point of self destruction rather than accept them. Per­haps, then, we should study the values of the interested parties in South Africa as well as our own, finding the ones we share in the hope that we can use them to work toward something we have his­toriclly resisted, a compromise that will satisfy all and act as an alternative to bloodshed. 
First, we must identify the interested parties. The two most obvious and pow­erful ones are the African National Congress and the Pretoria government. With the ANC, the U.S. shares a profound longing to end apartheid. With the South

African government we share, good or bad, a belief In capitalism. The two do not have to be mutually exclusive as we are so often led to believe. The U.S. must, whatever the cost, open viable, identifi­able, and public diplomatic relations with the ANC and work with its leaders to find a way to bring the South African govern­ment leaders to the same bargaining table with them, for it is only there that any true "peace" agreement will be reached. At the same time we should con­tinue to use what little economic power we have to work toward total acceptance of the Sullivan principles by South African businesses. At the same time we should invest, yes, invest, more monies from or­ganizations like USAID in the homelands and surrounding black African states so that blacks can begin to help free them­selves from economic dependence on the bigoted whites. 

Our power in South Africa is much more limited than we wish to acknowledge. We must not waste it on empty symbolic ges­tures, such as sanctions and divestment, of a moral superiority our own history does not justify and that serve only to wash our own hands. Instead we must be willing to get our hands dirty and work hard from within the existing structures of the ANC, the South African govern­ment, and other organizations with the prayer that someday the bloodshed will 
end  and  a  just  compromise  will  be  
reached  to  achieve  true  and  lasting  
peace.

Hunger coalition seeks further student support 
Dear Editor: 
It's that time again. Today and Thursday, members of Notre Dame's World Hunger Coalition will be in the dining halls signing up students who want to participate in the Wednesday Lunch Fast program. 
Each Wednesday, from September 17 through December I 0, these students will forgo their lunch in the dining halls, and the Notre Dame Food Service will donate $I for each student lunch that is given up. The dining halls very generously sup­port this program, giving more per lunch than the food itself actually costs them. The World Hunger Coalition divides the donations, which total over $7,000 a se­mester, among seven development or­ganizations helping the needy in India, Bangladesh, Chile and Africa. .., 
This program produces good results all around. Less fortunate people receive the food and medicine necessary to live and learn to support themselves through education and agricultural assistance. College students with precious little time or money to give to charity can still donate to those in need. 
The reasons for the Fast go beyond the monetary matters, however. Fasting is also a vehicle to further awareness. The people who claim they get too hungry too fast are missing the point. Let's face it. The empty feeling in the stomach from skipping one meal is nothing compared

to subsisting on one bowl of rice a day, every day. 
More importantly, giving up that weekly hamburger and going hungry for those afternoon hours can get us thinking of how the millions of malnourished people have to live. This ugliness is horribly un­pleasant to contemplate; we'd rather not think about it. The reality remains, none­theless, and we have to face it. 
True, stopping to ponder the existence of people who live in abject poverty doesn't alleviate their suffering. Our awareness of their hunger doesn't feed them. But unless we reach this awareness and acknowledge the presence of their misery we will never be moved to elimi­nate it. 
The World Hunger Coalition would never claim that the ~·ast is the ultimate in social awareness. Missing one lunch a week gives us no idea what starvation is. We know that the dining halls will have pasta waiting for us on Wednesday night, and if we really want to, we'll be able to call Domino's. We can't fathom fasting every day of the week, without knowing when the next meal would come. 
Giving up lunch on Wednesday does, however, present us with the opportunity to begin to put into perspective the bless­ings that we can so easily take for granted, while sharing those blessings with less fortunate people around the world. 
Please join in this activity of awareness and generosity every Wednesday, and thank you for your support.

You have not seen "The Fly" yet'? What arc you waiting for'? 
Seriously though, "The Fly" is the newest creation of horror film director David Cronenberg ("The Dead Zone," "Scanners") who fell in love with the idea of an up­dated remake of the classic 1958 version of 'The f''ly" starring Vin­cent Price. 
MoviesN!: 
TheFiy ***' 
Cronenberg·s film contains aspects of the original film as well as new innovative concepts which make this "fly" one of 
Twentieth  Century  rox's  
strongest releases of th e  sum­ 
mer.  

The story opens in an art museum as Seth Brundle, played excellently by Jeff Goldblum of "The Big Chill" and "Into the Night" fame, meets an ambitious science reporter named Veronica, Geena Davis, star of television's "Sara." 
Veronica. in an attempt to ac­quire a story for her magazine, follows Bnm<lle to his warehouse-apartment. Brunelle has been experimenting with matter tcleportation ami al­though he shows Veronica his hardware at work, he refuses to allow her to print a story. As the old saying goes, one thing leads to another. and Brundle and Veronica eventually fall in love and move the action to the bedroom. 
Meanwhile, Veronica's old lover and present boss, Stathis Borans, portrayed by John Getz from "Magruder and Loud," con­fronts Veronica during a fit of childish jealousy in front of Brunelle's apartment. Brundle witnesses the argument and in his own petty envy and having drunk just a bit too much cham­pagne, attempts to teleport him­self. A fly just happens to buzz its way into the telepod with him and the resulting transmission of man and fly changes Brundle's life forever. 
In the original "Fly," the unfor­tunate transportee exited the second telepod with an arm and the head of a fly. In this version the damage is much deeper; Brundle's genetic pattern is fused with that of the fly. Once this fusion is completed, he begins a bizarre disease-like transformation which, under­standably, necessitates some very interesting changes in life­style. 
JeffGoldblum and Geena Davis are the stars of the horror-thriller "The Fly. "

Geena Davis is not bad, either. 
Clearly, she must yield to 
Goldblum's acting ability, 
however, she makes Veronica's 
role a believable one. It is diffi­

befall Brundle. Considering both 
the scientific and love interests 
of her character, Davis is able to 
bring potentially inconceivable 
emotions to stirring life.

Receiving the certificate of award was as much a surprise as an honor for Jones.

HS drug tests a hot issue 
Associated Press 
Proposed legislation to require drug and alcohol testing in In­diana high schools drew mixed reactions from school adminis­trators on Tuesday, some ques­tioning the fairness, enfor­ceability and cost of such a plan. 
Two state representatives said Monday they would introduce a bill in the 1987 General Assem­bly that would mandate the In­diana High School Athletic Asso­ciation to implement the testing program. IHSM Commissioner Gene Cato opposed the plan. 
Don Noblitt. the principal at Jasper and chairman of the IH­SM executive committee, said yesterday he tended to agree with Cato's opposition to the pro­posal. 
"My first reaction would be against it" he said. "It wouldn't be fairjust to have it for athletes. If you're going to test (for drugs). you might have to do it for all extracurricular activities, not just athletics." 
He said penalties at individual schools are often more severe than the 30-day suspension pro­posed by the legislators. 
"At Jasper High School and other area schools, the penalty is much more severe, including suspension from school for a se­mester," Noblitt said. 
Joan Finch, principal at Evansville Central, said she believes the program would create an initial scare in student athletes who use drugs, but ul­timately the program would 
create  "a  more  sophisticated  
user."  
She  said  education  at  a  

younger age is the way to cure the drug problem. 
John Reinitz, athletic director at Evansville Mater Dei. said in principle, the plan is good. But he believes it would be hard to enforce.

With only four minutes remain­ing in the match, Joanne Mar­shall tallied the final goal for the Irish, with a dual assist from McGlinn and Christine Sweeney. 
Although the Irish won impres­sively, Lindenfeld knows that there is room for improvement. 
"We need to work on marking better. Our defense has to cover the forwards and we have to score on the penalty corners," she said.

"I don't know what we'll do, but we will find a way to move the football," said Holtz, "I just hope it is forward. I don't know how consistent we can be running the football, and I don't believe that you can throw it every down either. "We need to be able to control the ball to some extent simply to avoid putting our defense in bad position too many times during a game."

Add all of this to the fact that Big Bad Bo's record on opening day is 16-I since he's been at the helm at Michigan. 
The last time Michigan stepped on the field, it defeated Nebraska in the Fiesta Bowl to complete a I 0-1-1 campaign. 
The last time the Irish stepped on the field, Jimmy Johnson's steamrolling crew crushed them by 51 points, to make for a 5-6 finish. 
So it may seem odd that a game between two teams com­ing off entirely different seasons may attract so much national at­tention. But after all. it is Notre Dame, and everyone seems to want to keep an eye on this Holtz guy. 

Parseghian optimistic about Holtz' chances 
Associated Press 

SOUTH BEND-Ara Parseghian, whose Notre Dame football teams won 95 games and two national championships in I I years, predicts that new coach Lou Holtz' ability to motivate players will make him a success with the Irish. 
"Within three years, he will set a pattern here that will bring a consistent winner. In three years, he will go down as one of Notre Dame's winningest coaches," said Parseghian. 
Holtz will make his debut with the Irish on Saturday when they face Michigan's third-ranked Wolverines. He succeeds Gerry Faust, who suffered more losses in his five years at Notre Dame than any Irish coach in history. 
As a color commentator on ABC from 1975-81, Parseghian saw Holtz lead an underdog Arkansas team over Oklahoma in the 1978 Orange Bowl and over previously unbeaten Texas in 

1981. In both cases, Parseghian said, Arkansas was clearly out­manned, but Holtz won by motivating his players. 
"He has enthusiasm. He's a very knowledgeable guy, and he knows how to motivate," said Parseghian, who now serves as football analyst with CBS. "You can't count this guy out. He's been around. He knows what he's doing. He can motivate people and that's a prerequisite for this job." 
Parseghian was openly critical of recent Notre Dame teams coached by Faust, who resigned last fall. 
Parseghian would not spec­ulate on the Irish's chances during Holtz's first season.

Senior sets record in win 
By MARGOT MACHECA 
Sports Writer 
Senior forward Corrine DiGiacomo led the Irish field hockey team to a convincing 6-0 shutout of Valparaiso University yesterday_ DiGiacomo tallied three goals in the first half to be­come tied for recognition as Notre Dame's all-time career goal scorer with 56 to her credit. 
"We played together well as a team today," noted Head Coach Jill Lindenfeld, "with outstanding inner passing and feeds to Cor­rine." Using that combination the Irish dominated the entire game. 
Junior Ann McGlinn contrib­uted one goal and two assists to the Irish's winning cause. Keeping the ball on Valparaiso's end of the field the whole after­noon, the Irish were seldom threatened by their opponents. The Crusaders made no shots on goal against Notre Dame's defense. 
"By maintaining possession and drawing penalty corners, we controlled the match," explained Lindenfeld. 
Because of great execution on 
the field by McGlinn and junior 
Benet DeBerry, the Irish had thir­
teen penalty corner opportuni­
ties.

Notre Dame running backs must overcome injury and inexperience 
By MIKE SZ¥MANSKI 
Assistant Sports Editor 
The Notre Dame football team's running back corps will have to overcome injury and in­experience to replace Allen Pinkett. the all-time leading groundgainer and three-time 
I.000-yard performer. However. multiple formations and a new offensive approach will also eliminate that tired cliche, 'Pinkett up the middle.' 
"We will run multiple offensive line-ups." said Irish running backs coach Mike Stock, "(including) the 'I' formation, the split backs, and the one-back of­fense. We can run most of the same plays out of the different sets." 
Sophmore Mark Green (6-0, 
183), who caught nine passes for 
I 16 yards as a receiver last season, will start against Mic­higan at tailback. 
"Mark earned the right to start." said Stock. "He has been the most consistent. most durable, and has stayed healthy. He has learned to play without the ball. to block effectively, and to catch the ball out of the back­field." 
"Green does everything you ask him to do," said Holtz. "He is a good college tailback." 
Senior Pernell Taylor (5-1 I, 2 16 with 7 carries for 37 yards and I TD) has emerged as the starting fullback. "Pernell has seen competition from both Frank Starns and Tom Monahan, who played last year, .. said Stock. "He was not I00 percent last year when he played. 
"He has been able to get some strength, and he has gained con­fidence in practice." Taylor spent two seasons rehabilitating from constructive knee surgery. 
"I didn't have any pre­conceived notions about what we would do offensively," said Head Coach Lou Holtz. "But because of the question marks regarding our offensive line and our tail­back and fullback positions, I didn't feel our personnel was conducive to running out of the 'I' all the time. 
"People always ask me about the option, and it's part of our package. But you won't see a steady diet of it because it's not a major part of the offense." 

Pernell Taylor 
The possibility of split end Tim Brown running out of the wish­bone is a real one. "We will try to get the ball to Brown as often and as in many ways as possi­ble," said Stock. 
Starns (6-4, 229 and 44 for 164, 3 TDs) worked primarily as the lead blocker for Pinkett last year. His spring was cut short in the fifth practice when he broke his tibia. "He is coming along nicely and has rehabilitated his leg. but he still has some bumps and bruises," said Stock. 
Monahan (5-I 0, 2 I 0 and 27 for 
93), a senior, is a former walk-on who was awarded a scholarship in the spring of '85. He was primarily used in short yardage situations. 
At tailback, sophomore D'Juan Francisco should be able to prac­tice tomorrow after healing his pulled hamstring. His brother senior Hiawatha (5-10, 194 and 60 for 252 and 3 TDs) switched from free safety after Alonzo Jef­ferson went down to a knee in­jury that will also keep him out this season. However. Hiawatha Francisco has had to battle injury as well. Severely arthritic knees kept him out of spring practice and offseason surgery helped the condition. Then he damaged a thumb liga­ment which was casted. Finally, he badly twisted his ankle in practice last weekjust as he was making major strides. Both of the brothers are doubtful against Michigan. 
"I know the Francisco brothers have an awful lot of talent with the ball under their arm," said Holtz, "but their ability to stay healthy always gives you some concern." 
"We are apprehensive about depth." said Stock. "We are really short on the plethora of backs normally at Notre Dame. We are hurting in physical numbers. 
"Two freshmen will help pick­up in depth, if they materialize. They must see things that they need to learn to be prepared to play Saturday." The two fresh­men are Anthony Johnson (6-1, 
220) and Braxston Banks (6-2, 
208) both at tailback. 
"The individual that really has a chance to make a contribution out of the freshman . dass ·is

All eyes on Irish as Holtz era begins 
We are being watched. 
Soon the whole campus will be invaded. but not by the body snatchers. The visitors will just be harmlessjournalists, alumni, relatives, and heaven forbid, Michigan Wolverine fans. 
One might be curious as to what all the commotion is about. After all, it is just another silly little game, right? How much excitement can a team coming off a 5-6 season generate? 
Evidently, quite a bit. You see, there is this Holtz fellow who has everyone taking another look at that 5-6 team. 

Rick Rietbrock 
Irish Items 

This Holtz fellow is not an imposing figure. He describes 
himself as "a guy five-feet-I 0, 150 pounds, who wears 
glasses, talks with a lisp and has a physique that looks like 
he's had beri beri and scurvy." 
He sounds like the type who spends his time playing com­
puterized chess. But instead, he spends his time rebuilding 
football programs. 

In 1969, Holtz took over the head spot at William & Mary. 
In his second season at the helm, the team earned a trip to 
the Tangerine Bowl. its first and only bowl invitation. 
Word started spreading throughout the east that this Holtz 
character could coach a football team. The word reached 
North Carolina State and Holtz became coach of the Wolfpack 
in 1972. A team coming off consecutive three-win seasons 
greeted him. He returned the greeting to the tune of an 8-3-1 
record. 

Continued success. including ACC "Coach of the Year" 
honors, enabled Holtz to be the first head coach to leave 
State with a winning record since 1919. 
More people began to take note of this Holtz, and in 1976 
he got a call from the pros. This is good news for players, 
but it was bad news for Holtz. One year was enough with the 
guys who play for pay as Holtz resigned before his first 
season, an unsuccessful one, was completed with the New 
York Jets. 

Arkansas was waiting with open arms for Holtz, after legend Frank Broyles stepped down following a 5-5-I season. The Razorbacks proved to be the right cure for Holtz· one-year slump. Picked to finish sixth in the Southwest Conference, Arkansas went I 0-I and upset second-ranked Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl, 31 -6. despite the suspension of three of­fensive stars who had accounted for over three-fourths of the 
·Arkansas touchdowns during the season. 
The legend of this little man grew bigger and bigger. He won' some national "Coach of the Year" awards and received over 12,000 letters in support of his disciplinary action. 
The Razorbacks continued to roll behind their wiry leader. who had a knack of ruining perfect seasons for opponents. Texas was ranked second in 1981, with its only loss being a 42-1 I rout in Arkansas. 
In 1982, Arkansas tied Southern Methodist to give the Mus­
tangs their only blemish of the year.
