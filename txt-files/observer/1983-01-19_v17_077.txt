A hearing is scheduled for tomor­row to decide if a temporary injunc­tion should be placed against Fan Action. Inc., publishers of Go Irish, to keep the magazine from publish­ing under its current name. 
The hearing is the result of a counter-suit filed by Notre Dame against Fan Action, charging it with making the publication appear to be connected with the t:niversity. Fan Action filed suit against Notre Dame in September alleging that the Sporrs Information Department was interfering with the normal business functions of Go Irish, an independ­ent publication which covers Notre Dame footbalL 
The original suit filed by Fan Ac­tion claims that the Sports Informa­tion Department "had done certain things to interfere with the workings of the publication,"' according to James Groves, attorney for Fan Ac­tion. The suit charges that the Sports Information Department denied Go Irish press credentials and that people from the Sports Information Department had tried to influence other universities not to cooperate with writers and other people from the publication. 
The University's counter-suit charges that Go Irish has been trying to make itself appear to be con­nected with Notre Dame, according to Philip Faccenda, legal representa­tive for the University. 
Included in the charges are the use of the word "Irish," the mast­head which reads "the newsmagazine devoted exxclusive­Iy to the coverage of Notre Dame Fighting Irish Football," the lack of disclaimers stating that the publica­tion was not connected with the University in any way, and other items which allegedly make the publication appear to be connected with Notre Dame. 
Go Irish has a folio at the bottom 
ofeach page declaring it as"An inde-

Roger Valdiserri, director of Sports Information, commented that he did not know why the Go Irish staffthought it was being treated un­fairly. He noted that the University has published regulations regarding the criteria for the issuance of press and photo credentials. 
Those criteria state that "weekly publishing media agencies if less than 100,000 published circulation cannot be accomodated." The cir­culation of Go Irish, published weekly during the football season and monthly during the offseason, is approximately 8,000. 
Valdiserri added that all inter­views must go through the Sports In­formation Department, because of the concern of gambling organiza­tions misrepresenting themselves to the players as media personneL

Hesburgh, leaders call for ban 
An international gathering of 1 I religious leaders, including University President Father Theodore M. Hesburgh, and representing the Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, Anglican, Coptic, and Muslim faiths met with six representatives of national academies of science in Vienna, Austria, last Thursday through Saturday to discuss the threat of nuclear arms. 
The group, which included Cardinal Franz Koenig, Archbishop of Vienna; Hesburgh; Arch­bishop Jean Jadot, president of the Vatican Secretariat for Non-Christians; Archbishop John Roach ofSt. Paul, Minnesota, president ofthe Nation­al Conference of Catholic Bishops; and Methodist Bishop James Armstrong, president of the National Conference of Churches of Christ, focused its dis­cussion on a statement issued in Rome last Septem­ber by SS world class scientists which called for a ban on nuclear warfare and elimination of existing nuclear arsenals. 
At the conclusion of the meeting, which was hosted by Koenig and Hesburgh, the religous leaders issued a joint statement affirming the scientists' call for action. 
"As persons from diverse religious traditions," they said, "we are impressed by the declaration of these eminent scientists. We speak as one to em­phasize that humanity, for the first time in history, has the power to destroy itself We believe that there is no cause that would morally justify the death and destruction caused by a nuclear conflagration." 
Denying the assertion that any side could "win" a nuclear war, the religious leaders said that the "first duty" of their respective faiths was to praise their Creator and to revere human life. 
Lasting peace, they said, "is both a gift of the Creator and a work ofours ...and can only be based upon global justice, respect for the dignity of each person, a conversion of mind and heart regarding war and peace, and, finally, the Creator's call for reconciliation between estranged peoples." 
Denouncing the arms race for its diversion of valuable resources from human needs, the religious leaders called upon national leaders to "repudiate as a means of settling disputes between nation states a destructive force that outstrips our ability to calc­ulate its effects. 
What human beings have made can be unmade, the religious leaders said. "Fatalism must give way to hope. We join the scientists in their call for urgent action to achieve verifiable disarmament agree­ments leading to the elimination of nuclear weapons. Nothing less is at stake than the future of humanity, with its rich and variegated cultures and religious traditions. 
which has a membership of about 540,000 firms. 
Under their plan, the federal deficit would be slashed by 25 per­cent -some SSO billion if the deficit reaches S200 billion or more in the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1. 
Future deficits should decline even more, and "no area of the budget should be regarded as sacred," said Alexander Trowbridge, president of the National Associa­tion of Manufacturers. 
He said deficits must be reduced so interest rates fall even further and capital is available to businesses for recovery. Capital for business ex­pansion would be sharply limited if the government were to borrow large sums to finance the federal debt. 
The group specifically called for about half of their recommended 1984 cutbacks -S 18 billion to S23 billion -to come out of the Pen­tagon's budget. 
Reagan said last week that he was willing to trim his record S285 bil­lion military budget plan next year oy s 1 1 billion in current spending and military orders. The cut would reduce actual spending during the year by S8 billion. 
But the business leaders urged an additional SS billion savings by canceling or deferring arms pur­chases and SS billion to S I 0 billion 
in  operations,  maintenance  and  
other areas.  
To help pare  S22 billion to  $30  

billion from the non-military side of the ledger, the groups said a one­year freeze should be placed on pay increases for federal . civilian workers. For federal benefit programs like Social Security. the plan suggested a temporary freeze on all cost-of-living adjustments or a reduction in the amount beneficiaries get in cost-of-living in­
creases. 
The administration has not yet released its plans for specific reduc­tions in non-defense spending, but that savings could run in the vicinity of S40 billion next year. 


More complications arise with Jarvik-7 
SALT LAKE CITY ( AP) -Artificial heart recipient Barney Clark went back into surgery late yesterday to seal two arteries in his left nasal passage that have been bleeding for 10 days, officials said. 
Clark, 61, a retired Seattle area dentist, was wheeled back into sur­gery around 4 p.m. and doctors ex­pected him to be in the operating room for several hours, said john Dwan, a spokesman for the Univer­sity oflltah Medical Center. 
Doctors had sealed Clark's nasal passages last Friday with a balloon­like catheter and packed them to try to stop the bleeding. They tried yes­terday to remove the packing, but bleeding continued in Clark's left passage, Dwan said. 
"The left side continues to bleed 
seriously, so Dr. (William) DeVries 
made the decision to return to sur­
gery," Dwan said. 
DeVries is the surgeon who im­
planted theJarvik-7 artificial heart in 
Clark's chest Dec. 2. 
Yesterday's operation was the third since the heart implant. On Dec. 7, surgeons closed leaking air sacs in Clark's lungs and on Dec. 14, they replaced his left ventricle which contained a faulty valve. 
"All surgery is serious, but Dr. DeVries said this is the least risky of any operations Dr. Clark has had so far," Dwan said.

The Winters-Greeley countersuits remain in pre­trial litigation. Before either case can go to court, the legal standing of Father Andrew Greeley's claim must be established. Although he is unsure, Winters' attorney, William Maddux, estimates that this 
legal test will be concluded within a month afterwhich the trial proceedings will ensue. Winters, the managing editor of the Notre Dame Magazine, sued the author of the bestselling book, The Car­dinal Sins for $3 million for impeding his career with remarks the priest made on thePhil Donahue Show last April. Greeley retaliated by filing a S5 million countersuit for compensation for the early release of information Winters took with permission from the 
priest's files. -The Observer 
Three men and three women were.shot to death yesterday at a house in a suburb ofVancouver, British Colum­bia, and police said a man was in custody. Royal Canadian Mounted Police Staff Sgt. Brian Scott confirmed the arrest but deferred most questions until a news conference later in the day. The shooting rook place in a house occupied by Richar Blackman, a Vancouver t1reman, his wife Irene and his 16-year-old son Rick. The Blackmans also had an older son and two married daughters. Scott said an arrest had been made but no charges tiled. Outside the Blackman house, shocked friends and neighbors stood and stared as the coroner and police investigated. Police were using a dog on the front lawn where a sporting rifle with a telescopic sight was discovered. -AP 
The Reagan administration, acting under a court order. said yestcrdav it was making S30.4 million available to provide assistance to homeowners and otners who mstall solar devices or make energy conservation improvements. The money is being given to 48 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Mariana Islands, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The money implements a 1980 law establish­ing a Solar Energy and Energy Conservation Bank to provide sub­sidized and direct grants to people making energy improvements in their homes. States last year were asked to submit plans for using the money. The Solar Lobby was among several consumer groups, the state of New York and the cities of Philadelphia and St. Paul, Minn., which sued the administration last year to force establishment ofthe bank. The groups contended that the administration was illegally impounding money appropriated by Congress to get the bank going. A federal court agreed and ordered the administration to start spend­ing the money. -AP 
House Speaker Thomas P. O'NeillJr. plays himself in his television acting debut, a five-minute cameo ap­pearance taped for the NBC comedy series "Cheers." "He knew all his lines perfectly ...the professionalism of the man was un­believable," publicist Dick Winters of Para\llount Television in Los Angeles said yesterday. O'Neill, in California this week to play in the Bob Hope Charity GolfClassic, raped the "Cheers" segment Monday. In the show, O'Neill ducks into a Boston bar to avoid a woman airing her political views. She turns out to be a waitress at the pub, which is the setting for the series. Once inside, the Massachusetts Democrat sits next to Norm, an unemployed accountant played by George Wendt. Norm is complaining that Congress doesn't accomplish any­thing. "This bozo next to me could do better than that bunch of bums," Norm says. He then asks O'Neill: "Are you out ofwork, too?" "No, I'm in the House," O'Neill says. "Got the wife working, huh?" Norm replies. -AP 
A newspaper photographerwho witnessed an apparent kidnapping says he hid behind a tree after photographing three men while they chased and carried away another man at a local park in Lake Elsinore, California. "I didn't want them to carry me off too," said the witness, a photographer for the weekly Lake Elsinore Valley Sun Tribune. "l decided it was best to keep a low profile." Riverside County sheriffs investigators have not identified the man who was abducted Sunday or the three men who chased him. The photographer was interviewed by the Riverside Press Enterprise, which withheld his name base of his fear of reprisals. The witness said he was shooting scenic pictures when he saw one man running down Lakeshore Drive. The man was being chased by one man on foot and two in a pickup, the witness said. As they ran closer to Holiday Park, one passenger in the truck got out and joined the foot chase. The witness said he photographed the incident and jumped behind a tree and bushes when he thought the driver of the truck saw him. -AP 
Entertainer Dolly Parton cancelled concerts this week in Louisiana and Texas because ofa threat against her last week in Owensboro, Ky., The Tennessean reported yesterday. The singer-actress also has hired a Los Angeles detective agency that specializes in investigating threats on the lives ofcelebrities, accord­ing to the newspaper. On Saturday night, Miss Parton cancelled con­certs in the Kentucky city after a woman called police there and said she knew a man who "hated the ground that Dolly Parton walked on" and who was going to harm her. This weekend's concerts were canceled in New Orleans, Beaumont, Texas, and Fort Worth, Texas, the newspaper said. She also has beefed up security at her home in suburban Nashville. -AP

Security: an elusive feeling 
Saint Mary's students are experiencing an increase in security coverage as of late. A security guard has been stationed in the McCandless parking lot from dusk till 2 
a.m. on an unofficial basis since another assault attempt occurred Dec. 12. 
The additional guard was authorized by Security 
Director Anthony Kovatch. So far, the McCandless 
guard has not been decreed a permanant t1xture t by the 
administration. Other options are still being discussed. 
The McCandless guard is the most sensible step Security has taken since the first assault attempt oc­curred Nov. 5. 
Kovatch previously had requested additional nighttime security oft1cers. The cost of additional coverage is, ofcourse, a major concern. But the safety of the students should be most important. The nightly lock-up procedures take the patrol officers away from their rounds for a total of several hours. There is no doubt that the assaults have proven a need for addition­al coverage. The McCand­less guard should be an officially authorized part of nighttime security. 
Other options include in­stalling a gate at the main entrance to monitor traffic or building a guardhouse near the lor similar to the 1111c-at ill<' m.,in g.1te 
These are hoth feasible 
ideas but the most logical 
solution has been ignored. 

The very fact that both of the assault attempts took place near the McCandless parking lot should raise a few questions. Saint Mary's students who live on campus can't leave their cars in the LeMans lots past early morning without getting ticketed. This forces the majority of students to park in the McCandless lot at night -the most isolated part of campus. Meanwhile, the entire LeMans parking lot sits in the heart of the campus -nearly deserted -all night. 
The very nature ofSaint Mary's as a women's college makes this parking situation an invitation for assault. The McCandless lot is virtually the furthest point on campus from most of the dorms. And the fact that McCandless Hall is not connected to the underground tunnel network makes the parking system even more senseless. 
As long as the LeMans lot is there -and safer due to 
its location -why shouldn't the students use it? 
Right now the lot is used primarily by administration members during the day. Let the stud,ents share the lot with the administration. And when that lot is filled up, let the extracars park in McCandless. There is no reason

Inside Wednesday 

from the McCandless lot to his or her office in broad daylight. 
The administration is also responsible for the policy that makes the Public Relations Director the official spokesman for Saint Mary's Security. From personal ex­perience, this often results in long periods of a form of shuttle diplomacy between Security and Public Rela­tions betore their facts coincide. 
The oft1ce of Public Relations is so far removed from 
the business of Secmity that what results is simply Public Relations repeating what Security claims. (An unnecessary bureaucratic hindrance.) For example, Security failed to notify the county sheriffs office after the Nov. 5 assault. Later Kovatch said his officers had contacted the sheriff Puhlic Rclatiuns \'t:niled thi~. lt wa" later learned from the sheriff that, in fact, it was one of the victims that had called the sheriff, two hours after the incident. 
Kovatch, as Director of Security, should have the responsibility ofacting as of ficial spokesman for his department. 
The search for suspects in the two assaults has not progressed. With no further incidents since the Dec. 12 attempt, the responsibility of the investigation has fallen on the sheriffs office. And Sergeant Greg Delinski of the Detective Bureau, who is conducting the investigation, says "We are just in a holding pattern until something breaks." 
With that kind ofofficial attitude eminating from the top, it is unfortunate bur necessary that Saint Mary's stu­dents assume so much responsibility for their own safety.

olates federal copyright laws. 
Kroft added that Sony and other makers of the popular machines must be held legally responsible for such armchair piracy. 
But Sony lawyer Dean Dunlavey of Los Angeles urged the justices to rule that the taping of a favorite TV program or televised movie is a legal "fair use" ofcopyright materials. 
"The issue is whether all Americans ...are to be denied the benefit oftime-shift home television viewing because a few program owners object," Dunlavey said. 
The recorders make it possible to store on tape a televised show and view it at some later time, giving rise to the "time-shift" label. 
The justices must decide whether a federal appeals court was right in ruling that video recorder manufac­turers like Sony can be forced to pay continuing royalties -or even made to stop selling the machines ­because more than 5 million American families already are violat­ing copyright laws. 
The lower court ruling theoreti­cally allows copyright owners to sue home viewers, but the chance for such actions is seen as remote. 
A huge amount of monev is at stake, nonetheless. American ~ales of home video recorders were es­timated at more than s I billion in 1982. Nearly 40 million recorders are expected to be in use by 1990.

Revising view 
Bishops discuss nuclear weapons 
The American bishops, who have moved to the forefront of the anti­nuclear movement, are preparing a final version ofa draft pastoral letter that condemns nuclear warfare, as well as some aspects of American strategic policy. The Reagan ad­ministration has contested portions ofthe document, including a call for a nuclear freeze that has been criticized by the White House as damaging the U.S. negotiating posi­
tion. 

Proposed at a Roman Catholic bis­
hops' meeting in Washington last 
November, the document con­
demned any intent or threat to use 
nuclear weapons and said even 
possessing them as a deterrent can 
be tolerated only if steps are being 
taken toward mutual disarmament 
by the United States and the Soviet Union. 
A Vatican official said the 
Americans wanted to hear the view­
points of their European colleagues 
and that the exchange might lead to 
changes before the 25,000-word 
document comes up for adoption at 
a meeting in Chicago in May. 

The official, who spoke on condi­
tion his name not be used, described 
the public stance of the French and 
West German bishops as more 
"middle-of-the-road" than that ofthe 
American bishops, while the English 
and Scottish bishops have been 
closer to the U.S. bishops. 

Italian bishops have made only 
one major statement, expressing 
concern over plans to install U.S. 
nuclear missiles in Sicily as part of a 
NATO build-up. 

"We simply want the insights of 
our peers in Western Europe as well 
as the Vatican," said one of the U.S. 
participants,_ Archbishop John R. 
Roach ofSt. Paul-Minneapolis, presi­
dent of the National Conference or 
Catholic Bishops. He said the views 
ofthe Vatican and European bishops 
will be taken into account as the 
American prelates prepare the final 
draft. 

VATICAN CITY (AP) -The Vatican convened a meeting of top 
U.S. and West European bishops yes­terday to discuss the American churchmen's sweeping condemna­tion of the use of nuclear weapons and possibly suggest changes before a final version is completed. 
In a sign ofthe importance the Ho­ly See attaches to the meeting, the Vatican assigned Secretary of State Cardinal Agostino Casaroli and its top theologian, Cardinal Joseph Rat-zinger, as moderators over the two­day conference of prelates from the United States, Britain, France, West Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Italy. 
The meeting, in the old Synod Hall of the Apostolic Palace, was closed to the public, and the Vatican said only that the initial session lasted three hours and gave no details of the talks. 
Discussions continued in the af­
ternoon. 


Jap internment based on lies, report says 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -A key military report that led to the intern­ment of nearly 120,000 Japanese­Americans during World War II was based on "intentional falsehoods," say attorneys planning appeals of three landmark cases from 1943. 
The cases involve the convictions 40 years ago of three men, now in their 60s, on charges of violating curfews and refusing to report to as­sembly centers, said attorny Don Tamaki. 
Part of the appeals will be based on documents found in the past few months in government archives by Peter Irons, a law professor in the political science department at the University ofCalifornia-San Diego. 
The writs will be filed today in 
federal courts in San Francisco, 
Seattle and Portland, Ore.. said 
Tamaki. 
Irons says the documents dis­credit a report hy Army Gen. John L. Dewitt which alleged Japanese­Americans were a threat to the na­tion's security. The report by Dewitt was used to justity the evacuation of American-born Japanese and Japanese aliens from the West Coast into internment camps, Tamaki said. 
Statements from that report also 
appeared in Justice Department 
briefs or in briefs filed by the attor­
neys general of California, Washing­
ton and Oregon in the three cases to 
be appealed. Tamaki said. "These 
three cases really are landmark deci­
sions which upheld the legality of 
the whole relocating of a group of 
people on a racial basis," said

From there, Valdiserri noted the in­terviews must be screened because of the great demand. 
"There is only a certain amount of time our athletes have to give inter­views," Valdiserri said. He indicated that the larger and more influential publications have priority in being granted interviews. 
The case was transferred out of 
Saint Joseph's county at the request 
of Fan Action, after the two sides 
were unable to reach an out-of-court 
agreement.

Tamaki. "The full basis for the Supreme Court decision upholding the evacuation was military neces­sity." 
Dewitt died in 1962, and Wash­
ington attorney Joan Z. Bernstein, 
chairman of the Commission on 
Wartime Relocation and Internment 
of Civilians, declined comment on 
the case yesterday because she has 
not seen the briefS. 
The original internment order 
was issued in early 1942 by Presi­
dent Franklin D. Roosevelt, who, at 
the time, said, "The successful 
prosecution of the war requires 
every possible protection against 
espionage and against sabotage." 
Lawyers for the three men -Fred 
Corematsu, Gordon Hirabyashi and 
Min Yasui -said the military argu­
ment advanced by the Dewitt report 
was that Japanese-Americans were 
engaging in espionage and sabotage 
by radio transmissions to enemy 
ships. 
Tamaki said the report also 
claimed the Japanese-American 
community was so "ethnically in­
sular" that it was "virtually impos­
sible to distinguish the loyal from 

the disloyal." The report said it was 
therefore necessary to intern all 
Japanese-Americans.

TREES need growth 
S
leep Convention is the debut album by Trees. Trees, however, is not a group but a "concept" by Dane Conover. On this album, Conover has created a bubble-gum avam-garde record that Midwest pop stations should love. While this description sounds derogatory, it isn't meant to be. 
Sleep Convention is not a "Sturm und Orang as it goes up against the wall ofthe rock and roll establishment," as an overly emhusastic MCA press release writer referred to it. Rather, it is a very accessible look at pop music, with good melodies and some substantial lyricism. 
What makes this album different from other pop releases is the full blend of music making. 


Ed Kontady 
record review 

The music is standard fare with no more than a touch or two ofin­fluence outside the American mainstream sound. However, the shaping ofsounds by Conover offers a very interesting look at the dif­ferent instruments. 
"In a way, I see myselfassembling, as if startingwith the girders of a building," Conover states. "Then the various musical parts are added; I'm almost an engineer thinking about the 'surfaces' ofa song: onefor the verse, another for the chorus. But, at the same time, I like having the emotional content of the lyrics reflected in the structure of the music as much as possible. 
" ...We recorded the various combinations ofinstruments to blend in synthesizers with acoustic instruments, rather than using them alone, because it creates a more natural sound." 
Sleep Convention marks the debut ofConover on vinyl for MCA. This 24-year-old San Diego suburbanite had a very unique oppor­tunity LO make sure his debut album sounded exactly the way he wished it to -Conover wrote the ten songs, arranged them, and produced them. 
One ofthe most remarkable things about the album is the range of 
instruments used to produce it. No one instrument is used to excess. 
and all are played with a fair amount ofsuccess. 
The blending ofsounds is impressive. However, it is ground­breaking only in its accessibility -using experimeri,al and radical sounds to create a pop atmosphere. This album is directed toward those "-10-year-old program directors who honestly believe thatjohn Cougar is punk rock. 
Inside this pop atmosphere, a listener can find some enjoyable melodies, all ofwhich cry out for the AM radio technique (play once a hour until nausea -then announct· the song is number one and play it for another month). Lyrically, the songs range from terrible to torrid. The opening song, "Come back", has a good melody and some good background vocals, but the lyrics ("You took my Con­tinental/You took my credit cards/You should have seen the phone bill/You left me high and dry/You should have seen the dirty dishes/Not a nice way to say goodbye") were not mi)~cd down quite enough. 
Another cut on the first side, "No Stranger". show~ ConoveJ 's 
talent in a better light, with the aforementioned good music and bet­
ter lvrics ("In a crowd ofcigarettes and lunchtime/Mother nature is 
acynic in disguise/There stands a stranger/In his eyes, a reflection of 
a nightmare/And a few that you wouldn't want to ever believe/It's 
too real"). 
Two other songs, "R~d Car" and "Shock ofthe New" are also notable. "Red Car" looks back at the atomic bomb experiments ofthe '50's while an ominous view ofthe future runs parallel. 
"Shock of the New" talks about how mankind is lagging behind, because ofour primitive emotions, while technology is moving ahe;t.

Louisville's Milt WagnerJed a t6-6 scoring spurt to open a 10-point gap that carried ninth-ranked Cardinals to a 63-55 victory over Tulane in a Metro Conference basketball game last night. Wagner got eight ofhis game-high 24 points during that seven­minute first-half surge, which ended with Louisville holding a 26-16 lead with 3:52 left to play in the opening half. Tulane fought back to within three at 52-49 with 1:48 left in the game. But Wagner and Lancaster Gordon iced the contest from the free throw line. Gordon finished with 15· points. Paul Thompson led Tulane with 15 points, 
and John Williams had 13 for the Green Wave. Louisville is 14-2 while Tulane fell to 8-7. Tulane and Louisville battled through the first seven minutes of play without either team being able to estab­lish an advantage. The score was tied five times in those opening minutes. With the score: knotted 12-12, Wagner hit a 22-foot jumper, Gordon followed with a 12-footer off a pass from Wagner and the scoring binge was on. -AP

After winning his first match by forfeit, Crown came out in his second match and ate up his op­ponent, registering a first round pin. 
John Krug and Matt Stamm also posted a pair ofvictories. Krug deci­sioned two opponents at 177 while Stamm did the same at 190. 
One scary note for the Irish last night was a sudden third round in­jury to co-captain Don Heintzelman. 
But Heintzelman had only ag­gravated the injury to his knee that required arthroscopic surgery ear­lier-this year. Bruno is hoping that it will not keep him out of action for too long.

USFL makes inroads 
Blitz to sign Lions' White 
Features 
CHICAGO ( AP) -The Chicago Blitz of the United States Football League said yesterday they were on the verge ofsigning "a major Nation­al Football League player." and a source said the negotiations in­volved Detroit Lion~ linebacker Stan White. 
If the Blitz doe.s sign White, he would become the first player active during the la~t NFL season to jump to the fledgling USFL, which begins play March 6. 
Blitz spokesman Kay Schultz said he was told to prepare for. a news conference today to announce the signing of a "major" NFL player. Schultz said he did not know who the player was. 
A source, who asked for anonymity, told The Associated Press the player was the 32-year-old White, an 11-year NFL veteran and one of the most militant members of the National Football League Players Association's executive council. He is also a practicing attorney who negotiates his own contracts. 
White could not be reached for comment at his Detroit home. 
Lions spokesman Don Kremer said in a telephone interview that, "I'd heard rumors (of the signing). l saw Stan in the office yesterday (Monday) and asked him about it. All he did was grin. 
"I've heard nothing official on it and until it happens, we won't have any comment." 
Blitz coach George Allen, a former NFL head coach who owns part of the Chicago franchise, would say on­ly, "You're always interested in somebody of the caliber of Stan White." 
Allen's son, Bruce, who is the club's general manager, said White was "one of the top five guys we are pursuing." 
The source, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, said signing White would prove the club's determination to field a "respectable" product. 
"Both (Tim) Spencer and (Trumaine) Johnson (recently signed by the Blitz) are legitimate NFL prospects," he said. "Getting White gives the club another push down the road to respectability." 

Goid medals given back to Jim Thorpe 
LOS ANGELES (AP) -Two gold medals won by Jim Thorpe in the 1912 Olympic Games were restored to his family yesterday, 70 years after he was stripped ofhis amateur status because he accepted 52 a game to play baseball. 
Juan Antonio Samaranch of Spain, president ofthe International Olym­pic Commmittee. officialy returned the gold medals for the pentathlon and decathlon events to the family of Thorpe, who died in I953 at age 64. 
"The 70-year-old marathon is over," said Thorpe's daughter, Char­lotte, 63, one of six of the athlete's children who attended the ceremony at the Biltmore Hotel. 
Another daughter, Grace, said she thought her father would have only said, "It's about time." 
Thorpe, an American Indian, won 
the grueling Olympic events at the 
age of 24 in Stockholm, Sweden, but 
lost the titles seven months later when he admitted he was paid to play for a resort baseball team in 1910. 
The gold medals awarded yester­day were not actually those won by Thorpe, because "it would be unfair to ask survivors of the second-place finishers to return their (gold) medals," Samaranch had said. 
Samaranch said that since Thorpe's disqualfication in 1913, "it is impossible to enumerate all those who protested against this decision and made every effort in order to reverse it." 
"In the end, when the IAAF (International Amateur Athletics Federation) and United States 0 lym­pic Committee had finally accepted to reinstate him, subsequent modification of the so-called 'amateur rule' into a much more positive 'eligibility rule' of the IOC enabled us to take this historic deci­sion."

The source also declined to com­ment on the terms of the contract being discussed with White. 
Spencer, the Big Ten's leading rus­her last seas,on, and Johnson, an All­America wide receiver from Grambling, signed contracts last week after being drafted by Chicago in the first round of the lJSFL's col­legiate draft. 
White, a two-time, all-Big Ten selection at Ohio State, was drafted in the 17th round of the 1972 draft by the Baltimore Colts. He set an NFL linebacker standard with eight interceptions in the 19'5 season and stole seven passes during 1977. He was traded to Detroit following the 1979 season for an eigh'th-round draft pick. 
White went on to become Detroit's player representative and defensive signal-caller. Last season, the 6-foot-1, 225-pound defender recorded 44 solo tackles and three interceptions.

BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) ­The U.S. Olympic Committee and the U.S. Amateur Basketball Associa­tion have reaffirmed their support for Bob Knight as coach of the 1984 
U.S. Olympic team. 
I 
Knight, the Indiana University coach, was criticized in a recent editorial in the Washington Post, which called for his removal as U.S. Olympic coach because of his be­
havior during the Pan American 
Games in Puerto Rico in I979. 
Knight, the U.S. men's coach in the Pan Am Games, was convicted in ab­sentia of assaulting a Puerto Rican policeman. The incident stemmed from an argument over a practice court. 
"Our director, Col. Don Miller, 
Eating Disorders 
 Anorexia Nervosa 
has given all his support to Bob 
Knight," said liSOC publiicist Mike 
Moran. "Basically, what Don Miller said when I talked to him was that this (complaint) happens all the time, that we've received letters once in a while objecting to Bob but that we've made our choice and we've accepted what the ABAUSA has done." 
The ABAUSA recommended Knight for the Olympic coaching job last summer. 
"We are very satisfied we picked the right man to coach our Olympic team," said Bill Wall ofthe basketball association. ''We are further ahead in our Olympic planning with Knight that we've ever been. Knight's cooperation has been outstanding."

started all 2S last year. This year's outstanding recruiting class, and the development of sophomore guard Laura Dougherty has relegated her to a till-in role. 
'"It hasn't been easy (to accept the playing-time reduction)," admits Mullins. "But, being captain makes the adjustment easier. You realize that there's a lot more to the game than just playing." 
"My role is to be a leader, and to push people in practice, to give my 100 percent. I've been here three years, and I remember things like the 76-point game (a 124-48 loss to South Carolina two years ago)." 
Her play two weeks ago at Georgetown, though, had to give Mary D. pause. Her six points in 17 minutes weren't staggering, but the minutes she played were Notre Dame's most effective.
