Online service offers restaurant review-s 
By BECKY HOGAN News Wrircr 
It may sound too good to be true, but an up-and-com­ing online service called NDtogo.com is promising students free food and a guide to great restaurants in South Bend. 
NDtogo is "armed with a sixth sense for good deals and a passion for hole-in­the-wall restaurants and lit­tle-known bars ... to help students drink and dine bet­ter and more cheaply," according to its Web site. 

Its three founders ­including Notre Dame alum­ni Rudy Reyes Jr. and OJ DiDonna -decided to intro­duce South Bend restau­rants, bars and eateries to stud1mts through its new Web site, NDtogo.com, expected to be fully usable later this month. Ian Runyon, a graduate of DePauw University, is also a cofounder of the company. 
"The concept is basically that local South Bend restaurants really want to have students come into their restaurants, Reyes said. "We are basically try­ing to bring restaurants into campus through the Internet." 
The idea was entered in the McCloskey Business Plan Competition last October through Mendoza's Gigot Center of Entrepreneurial Studies, Reyes said. While he and his business partners

OIT fights security breaches 
University plans to bolster protections 
By MARCELA BERRIOS Associare News Edi ror 

Following several publicized security breaches this winter and last, the Office of Information Technologies IOIT) plans to upgrade Notre Dame's standards of information secu­rity and its tools to combat network hackers, University officials said. 
The initiative comes after an official's laptop was stolen in December and sensitive infor­mation related to University employees -including Social Security numbers and salary figures -was potentially exposed, OIT Chief Information Officer Gordon Wishon said. 
However, OIT began making upgrades before the incident, Wishon said. Last summer, the University hired Ernst & Young, a professional services firm, to give an independent and objective assessment of the security systems on cam­pus. 
Ernst & Young, he said,. determined the University needed to improve its policies regarding the management of sensitive data within and across departments and offices, the inherent flaws of the Notre Dame network, and the education and awareness of students and employees regarding the handling and

April Fool's 111ediocrity 
I woke up Sunday morning (fine, Sunday afternoon) with every intention of starting my day early, being produc­tive and getting all of my work done in time for opening night of Major Bill Brink League Baseball. 
Of course, like every other Sports Sunday, I hit a 
Production Editor 
roadblock that hindered my goal. This road­block, however, was more tangible than the others; I opened my door on the way 
to the bath:room to find what looked like a solid steel wall barricading me into my 
room. 
It turned out to be duct tape, but it contained a type-set sign indicative of just what day it was. The sign simply said-"April Fools." 
One of the most entertaining days of the year, April Fool's Day came and went again yesterday without a bona fide prank. The duct tape was good, yes, but the pranks just went downhill from there. 
I received an e-mail from my AR that the Zoo, Fisher Hall's claim-to-fame party held the night before the Fisher Regatta, had been cancelled. Rea..<;ons cited -too many rules infractions and the fact that next year's RAs are abroad. Fat chance. 
Later, my girlfriend tried to convince me that she was taken to the hospital Saturday night after falling out of a van, landing on a broken bottle and slicing her arm open. Although this is some­thing she would conceivably do, she for­got she talked to me the night before and made no mention of a hospital trip. 
\Vhat happened to the good April Fool's Day pranks? The day used to be filled with brilliantly conceived debaucheries that could bring the cho­sen victim to tears. 
My cousin once busted out a bottle of ketchup and a carving knife, laid out a murder scene and went to town on his mother and sisters. like any good moth­er would, she went bonkers, then flipped out again once she found it to be a prank. 
ESPN baseball analyst Peter Gammons once convinced ESPN Radio host Dan Patrick that former player and manager Pete Rose, who received a lifetime ban from baseball for gambling, was going to be allowed into the Hall of Fame. He deceived not only Patrick but also the millions of listeners glued to their radios. 
The best prank I've heard of to date came from my high school days. A girl, in a heartless act of aggression/radiant display of ingenuity, told her boyfriend she was pregnant. Needless to say, the poor young man was too busy trying to restart his heart beat and rearrange his future to remember the date. 
The meaning of the day careened downhill from the glory days ofthe past. People need to take their April 1st more seriously in the future. 
\Vhy didn't I think of something, you may ask? A creative, naughty idea to break the streak of disappointing pranks? My Saturday was jam-packed. I was too busy watching Entourage DVDs and imagining what my life would be like ifI were Turtle. 
You know, Turtle would pull some sweet April Fool's shenanigans. Call it inspiration for next year.

Show takes modern approach to culture 
By BRIGID FENLON 
News Writer 
Notre Dame and Saint Mary's stu­dents as well as prospective high school seniors on campus for Spring Visitation weekend experi­enced an exhibition of Latin culture Friday at La Alianza's annual Latin Expressions event. 
The show, a mix of songs, dances and poetry recitations, was held in Saint Mary's O'Laughlin Auditorium. The theme for this year's performance was MetropoLatino, a celebration of urban Latino life. 
Sophomore Prisma Garcia said she enjoyed the performances that expanded on the theme of urban culture. 
"One of the most interesting parts was when the emcee came out after the show and displayed a variety of nags from Hispanic regions around the world as a sign of unity," Garcia said. 
Senior Nancy Weaver, who has helped with the show for four con­secutive years, said the production describes what it is like to be a Latino and so "enhances the sense of community for Latinos at Notre Dame." 
"One of the purposes is to see what the Latino community at Notre Dame is about and to show prospects that there are several different ways to express your cul­ture," Weaver said. 
For high school seniors from underrepresented ethnic groups, the show gives them a glimpse into the cultural experiences of students at Notre Dame, Garcia said. 
"This helps the prospective stu­dents to realize that despite the fact that they will be a minority on campus, they will not lose their cul­ture upon their arrival," she said. 
But Latin Expressions is not just for minority students, Garcia said. 
"Latin Expressions is a show that can be universally understood and appreciated. It is open to all cul­tures, and everyone can find enjoy­ment," Garcia said. 
The acts performed to a full audi­ence who remained impressed and intrigued throughout, Weaver said. 
This year's show featured per­formances from a more diverse variety of cultures in Latin America, sophomore Abby Salazar said. 
"This wider range added more variety and engaged more of the audience, as more people were able to identify with the unique tra­ditions of their culture," said Salazar, who performed a Mariachi dance. 
The modern take on Latin culture was also a popular change, she said. 
"Last year was a cultural look into Latino culture. This year was much more modern which drew a very diverse audience," Salazar said.

ICPA presents avvards to ND student print publications 
Observer Staff Report 

The Observer was named the third-best Indiana daily student newspaper at the annual Indiana Collegiate Press Association awards cere­mony Saturday, winning awards in 12 categories. 
The Observer staff earned first place in the Stand-Alone Section cate­gory for its April 6, 2006 issue, which provided special coverage· of University President Father John Jenkins' closing statement on aca­demic freedom and Catholic character. 
The 2006-07 editorial board also earned first place in the Best Staff Editorial category for "Academic Monologues Belong at ND," which reviewed the "Vagina Monologues" controversy. 
Numerous staff mem­bers captured a variety of individual honors as well. 
Current Editor in Chief Maddie Hanna won first place in the Best News Feature Story category for "ND evacuees return from Lebanon," a profile of the journeys a Notre Dame student and a pro­fessor and his family took to the U.S. from Lebanon

Other first place honors went to current Managing Editor Ken Fowler in the Best Sports News category for "Changing Regulations," an investigation of the Notre Dame athletic department's restrictions on media access to the football program, and to current Assistant Managing Editor Mary Kate Malone and former Assistant News Editor Katie Perry in the Best Non-Deadline News Reporting category for "Administrators question Facebook postings," an examination of Notre Dame's usage of informa­tion gathered from Facebook in disciplinary matters.

"fit" to him than other orders. 

"1 looked into lots of orders, including the Jesuits and Holy Cross, before I made a deci­sion," Hoeffel said. "It's like looking for colleges -I didn't want to limit myself, but I think I found my calling with the Jesuits." 
Although Hoeffel did not choose Holy Cross, he said he found a great source of sup­port for his decision to enter the priesthood since he has been at Notre Dame. 
"I've never heard one person here say a bad thing about the Jesuits," Hoeffel said. "There's a big world outside Notre Dame, and the overriding issue is, how can we each best serve the Church?" 
Another Notre Dame senior decided the best answer to that question is through joining the Congregation of the Holy Cross. 
Dustin VonHandorf is part of Old College, Notre Dame's undergraduate seminary pro­gram. 
He got involved in spiritual life at Notre Dame by helping coordinate Mass at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart during his first three years in college before he entered Old College in the fall.

graduating. Of schools ranked in the top 30, only Washington and Lee University had a worse employment rate than Notre Dame, and only four schools in the top 50 were lower than Notre Dame in the category. 
U.S. News and World Report's Web site said the employment category was worth 18 percent of the overall ranking. 
"The U.S. News formula for determining rankings is subject to a certain amount of vagueness and weights only those variables that the magazine deems impor­tant in assessing schools," O'Hara said in her e-mail to students. "Many legal educators fmd this approach and the criteria that the magazine uses to be reduc­tionist. At the same time, we live in the real world with market forces. For good or ill, the rank­ings are a reality with which we live, and of which we are cog­nizant." 
Student reaction varied, with some students attributing the drop to O'Hara's leadership and others saying the change should be viewed as a slight fluctuation with limited insight into the future of the Law School. 
"Initially I guess I was disap­pointed but not that surprised, and now I guess it's just caused me to think about why it hap­pened," said Melissa Nunez, a third-year law student. "There's a lot of reasons the school ... isn't doing its best to be a university law school." 
Nunez cited what she called a limited number of academically rigorous courses and a high number of cancelled courses as problems that have hurt stu­dents' training and, indirectly, the rankings. 
Third-year law student Derek Muller, however, said the Law School's problems are notewor­thy but not germane to the rank­ings. 
his junior year. He said the first time he visited Moreau Seminary -where prospective Holy Cross priests are trained -his reaction was ''I'm home." 
For students considering the priesthood, Old College is a way for them to explore their vocation, Old College Assistant Director Father Kevin Russeau said. 
"Even if students in Old College don't become priests, they receive formation to be good Catholic men," Russeau said. 
Unlike most dorms, Old College doesn't have a football team, resident assistants or 40 new freshmen every year. 
What it does have in abun­dance is "community," VonHandorf said. 
"Community here is very dif­ferent from dorm life," VonHandorf said. "Everyone wants to be here [at Old College]. No one gets put here randomly." 
Old College's staff has a more hands-on role in the spiritual development of residents than most dorms, he said. 
"We have weekly formation meetings with the staff, and one of the first things we do is choose a spiritual director," VonHandorf said. 
The spiritual director pro­vides an important benefit to Old College life, VonHandorf said. 
"They're available to ask questions and talk about what's on our mind when we need to," he said. 
He noted a turnover in the Law School's admissions office for the relevant incoming class and the unusually high number of admit­ted students that year. Notre Dame accepted 24.4 percent of applicants in 2006. 
"The numbers, I think, they reflected the class," Muller said. 
Muller said the University should address the discrepancy between evaluations by other schools and the judgments by those on the bar and on the bench. While Notre Dame received a score of 3.8 out of 5.0 from judges and lawyers, law school deans and long-tenured faculty from peer institutions gave the school a 3.3. 
"Notre Dame's reputation in the legal community, at least among law schools, has not improved, despite a lot of these excellent, outstanding young fac­ulty [at Notre Dame Law School]," Muller said. 
While Notre Dame's ranking slipped, its cost remained rela­tively moderate in comparison to other top law schools. 
According to statistics released by U.S. News and World Report, Notre Dame's yearly cost of $48,220 -which included tuition, room and board, books and "other expenses" -was 33rd among private law schools. At least nine public law schools -including Connecticut, Wayne State, Maryland, all four California state law schools, Virginia and Michigan -were more expensive for out-of-state students than Notre Dame, according to the available data. 
Notre Dame tied for ninth with Harvard Law School in the sub­field of trial advocacy but was unranked in all other specialties -tax law, legal writing, interna­tional law, intellectual property law, healthcare law, environmen­tal law, dispute resolution and clinical training. 
The specialty rankings did not factor into the overall score.

Earthquake hits Solomon Islands 
HONIARA, Solomon Islands -A powerful undersea earthquake Monday in the South Pacific sent a tsunami several yards high crashing into the Solomon Islands, devastating at least one village, officials and residents said. 
Police and residents said a wave about 10 feet high struck the western town of Gizo, inundating buildings and causing widespread destruction. A man who answered the tele­phone at the Gizo police station said there were initial reports that eight people, six of them children, had been killed by the tsunami but they were still unconfirmed. The phone cut out abruptly before the man gave his name. 
Gizo resident Judith Kennedy said water "right up to your head" swept through the town. 
"All the houses near the sea were flattened," she told The Associated Press by telephone. "The downtown area is a very big mess from the tsunami and the earthquake," she added. "A lot of houses have collapsed. The whole town is still shaking" from aftershocks. 
Iran airs video of captured Britons 
TEHRAN, Iran -Iranian state television aired new video Sunday showing two of the 15 captured British sailors pointing to a spot on a map of the Persian Gulf where they were seized and acknowledging it was in Iranian territorial waters. 
Britain's Foreign Office denounced the video, saying it was "completely unaccept­able for these pictures to be shown on TV." 
Adding to tensions between the two coun­tries, about 200 angry Iranian youths chanti­ng "Death to Britain" and "Death to America" threw rocks and firecrackers at the British Embassy and tried to rush the com­pound but were held back by police.

White House nmesGomales testimony 
WASHINGTON -The White House scram­bled Sunday to move up Attorney General Alberto Gonzales' planned testimony to Congress about his involvement in firing eight federal prosecutors, only to get a cold shoulder from majority Democrats. 
The effort reflected the frustration by Republican senators and the White House over how long it is taking the embattled attorney general to explain himself under oath. Congress has just begun a vacation ­one week for the Senate, two for the House. 
In a sign of Gonzales' diminished standing on Capitol Hill, the Senate GOP leader offered lukewarm support for the nation's top law enforcer, whose inconsistent expla­nations about the dismissals have become a distraction for the Bush administration.

The New York senator's total included $4.2 million raised through the Internet. The cam­paign did not specify how much of the $36 mil­lion was available only for the primary election and how much could be used just in the gener­al election, ifshe were the party's nominee.

VATICAN CITY 

John Paul IT moves closer to sainthood 
Church officials announce investigation into late Pope's life is finished 
Associated Press 
VATICAN CITY Catholic Church officials reached a key milestone in the drive to make Pope John Paul II a saint Monday, clos­ing an investigation into his life and handing over a dossier detailing the pur­ported miraculous cure of a nun who prayed to him. 
The events come two years to the day after John Paul died -a remarkably fast pace that underscores the church's keen interest in beatifying John Paul and responding to the calls of "Santo Subito" or "Sainthood Immediately!" that erupted after his death. 
Pope Benedict XVI put John Paul on the fast track for possible sainthood just weeks after his April 2, 2005, death, when he waived the customary five­year waiting period and allowed the investigation into his predecessor's virtues to begin immediate­ly. 
Such a waiver had only been granted once before, to Mother Teresa. 

Benedict will not attend Monday's ceremony at the St. John Lateran basilica to close the investigation into John Paul's life, a key step in the process of beatification and canonization.

classification of sensitive infor­mation. 
He said sensitive information in the Notre Dame network would include academic records, health services files, Social Security numbers, finan­cial aid documents and University financial and invest­ment information. 
One of the tools OIT placed on its Web site to help the cam­pus community pinpoint sensi­tive information is the Sensitive Number Finder software, which locates potential Social Security and credit card num­bers on the computer's hard drive, external hard drives, USB "thumb" drives and AFS or NetFile space, Wishon said. 
OIT will also supervise work with different University departments in the upcoming months to make sure the office computers have firewalls, antivirus software and other preventive tools running, according to the OIT Web site. 
To correct the flaws in the Notre Dame network, Wishon said OIT was taking Ernst & Young's advice and considering security-differentiated zones within the public network, developing more effective tire­walls against unauthorized users and making revisions and upgrades to the different servers on campus. 
OIT Information Security Director Gary Dobbins said there were more than 40 dif­ferent projects underway designed to reduce the risks of unauthorized access to University information. 
"We are working to improve security for all campus sys­tems, both desktops as well as servers," Dobbins said. "Locating and identifying them all, particularly those which might contain sensitive infor­mation, is itself no small chal­lenge." 
He said the Ernst & Young audit determined several servers on campus were oper­ating in a vulnerable condition. 
Dobbins said OIT representa­tives contacted the different offices and departments that were red-flagged to "further steps they can take to reduce those vulnerabilities." 
On Jan. 13, 2006, the University detected a breach in a Development Office server, which may have exposed the personal and financial informa­tion of several donors. 

The University sent the donors whose information may have been leaked a letter on Jan. 20, 2006, detailing the crime and suggesting they keep an eye on their accounts, due to the risk of identify theft. 
The University sent a similar letter on Jan. 2, 2007 to the employees who may have been affected by the laptop theft, WNDU reported. 
These recommendations, Wishon said, also extend to all members of the Notre Dame community. 
Information security, he said, pertained to firewalls and the individual's discipline alike. 
"[Information security! is about how we access, process, transmit and store sensitive information in all forms," Wishon said on OI'f's Web site. "It certainly covers laptop and desktop computers, but also includes how we deal with paper records or whether we're discrete in telephone conversations that involve sen­sitive data."

Maine's Holocaust center relocates 
Associated Press 
AUGUSTA. Maine -With a succession of four curved roof lines arching toward the south­ern sky before ending abruptly with walls of glass, the archi­tecture is striking. But inside the new home of Maine's Holocaust and Human Rights Center, visitors may find what they see and hear even more moving. 
Images of survivors of the Nazi horrors and their libera­tors will appear on four screens to tell stories of what they experienced during those dark days. As a backdrop to their words, ambient sounds from the death camps will fill the air. 
Visitors will see a letter from a GI to his sweetheart describ­ing what he saw as he became one of the first Americans to liberate the death camps. Outside, a small plot of ground will hold earth from Auschwitz­Birkenau, following a ceremo­ny on April 15, international Holocaust Remembrance Day. 
For years, mementoes, tapes and other material pertaining to Mainers who survived or helped to liberate the concen­tration camps of the World War II era were scattered in differ­ent locations. Tapes were housed in the state library. 
Other items wound up in Sharon Nichols' home. 
A Catholic who developed a deep interest in the Holocaust during a visit to Germany in the 1960s, Nichols found her­self consumed by questions about how people could inflict such cruelty on fellow humans, and how anything like it can be prevented in the future. 
Last year -21 years after the Holocaust and Human 

Rights Center was founded ­ground was broken for its per­manent home. 
The Michael Klahr Center is named in honor of a child Holocaust survivor who eventu­ally settled in Maine. 
Klahr was born in Paris in 1937. llis mother was deported and probably killed, and his father was shot by the Nazis. In 1946, Klahr arrived on an orphan ship in the United States. lie became wealthy in New York after investing in real estate. lie later moved to Maine, where h1~ married Phyllis Jalbert. The two ran sporting camps until Klahr died in 1998. 
Nichols said the timing is right for the $2.8 million, 6,000-square-foot Klahr center to open because survivors and liberators who serve as the backbone of public outreach efforts are now old and dying.

IN BRIEF 

Fund pushes for Ully shareholder vote 
INDIANAPOLIS-A major U.S. pension fund wants fellow Eli Lilly and Co. shareholders to have more of a voice in amending the bylaws governing the drug maker. 
The California Public Employees' Retirement System has proposed allowing shareholders to change bylaws by majority vote. Currently, only board members can change bylaws, which essentially provide a road map for how the com­pany is run. 
It owns roughly 4.8 million Lilly shares, which is less than 1 percent of the Indianapolis-based company's stock. 
The retirement system, known as CalPERS, pitched its proposal in Lilly's annual proxy state­ment and in a letter it sent to 1,600 major share­holders. It notes that share owners can amend bylaws at most S&P 500 companies. 
Lilly opposes the proposal because company officials believe it would lead to too much influ­ence from large shareholders. It notes that its board has a duty to look out for the interests of all shareholders. 
Indianapolis Power suit dismissed 
INDIANAPOLIS -A federal judge on Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit by some 2,000 former Indianapolis Power & Light Co. employees who claimed utility officials failed to protect their retirement savings from a multimillion-dollar stock collapse that followed a merger. 
The class action lawsuit alleged that the value of employees' 401(k) and retirement plans plum­meted when Virginia-based AES Corp. acquired the utility in a stock swap in 2001. It also alleged company officers dumped IPALCO shares about the time employees were prohibited from selling company stocks owned through their benefit plans. 
But Judge David F. Hamilton found no evidence of illicit profits or wrongdoing and said executives had complied with federal securities law. 
"There is no evidence at all that the individual defendants had any negative inside information about AES or the prospects of its stock," Hamilton wrote in a 113-page ruling. "Defendants did not give investment advice themselves."

Talks seek largest ever tariffs cut

Negotiators have met for

Many critics have noted that the pres­ent Iraq War is the first real, long-term war in which the vast majority has not sacrificed anything significant. They say that the .5 percent of the American pop­ulation in the armed services is bearing the entire burden of the war in Iraq. For the most part, I'm in agreement with their assessment. I don't have to present any ration coupons when purchasing groceries at the store. Gas prices are still incredibly low by international stan­dards, thanks to gratu­itous subsidies for oil companies by our gov­ernment. I don't face a draft like my father; I'm not staring at a TV screen clutching a number that will determine whether I go off to fight or remain at home. Personally, each of us is quite well off in this conflict, mental anguish aside. 
However, we've sacrificed much as a country. 
There are 3,248 U.S. military fatalities that have been confirmed by the Department of Defense and countless casualties. Each one of these deaths has shaken the lives of family and friends and each casualty has altered a life for­ever. We're quickly learning that a grow­ing number of soldiers are returning with post-traumatic stress disorder which has, in the history of warfare, gone severely undiagnosed, underreport­ed, and insufficiently treated. Thousands more lives have been lost by non-military personnel, civilians working in Iraq in a variety of ways, whether it be driving a truck or working for a private security firm. These fatalities and casualties are mounting on a daily basis, climbing at staggering rates. 
We've lost the hope of Iraqis. While the flower-throwers that Donald Rumsfeld anticipated mostly stayed home during the liberation of their country, there was still a great sense of victory and hope for the future of Iraq back in 2003. Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator and had been deposed in a matter of weeks. The words "sectarian violence" had yet to be uttered on the news and pictures of Iraqi children smiling at soldiers dominated the airwaves, not the lED explosions and bombed-out marketplaces full of grieving Iraqis we see today. We've lost the hope of Iraqis and therefore we've lost Iraq. According to the latest ABC News poll, 51 percent of Iraqis believe that it is "acceptable" to attack U.SJcoalition forces. 


We've lost the respect of the world. The administration has managed to take all the sympathy and support that was thrown at us from around the world on September 11 and mangle these alliances into a relationship of bitter dis­cord. These other countries unanimously agree that terrorism must be stopped but fundamentally disagree with our approach towards bringing peace and stability to the Middle East. They see the war in Iraq as the ill-advised debacle that it is and resent the losses that they, too, have accrued. 
We've sacrificed the moral high­ground that we once held as a nation. We were once the ultimate symbol of freedom, liberty and justice. Our country was what the world wanted to be. Our government was something that we could be proud of, an achievement of civ­ilization that stressed accountability, equality and rule by the people, for the people and of the people. Oh, how we mighty have fallen. We have stooped so low as to use torture as a primary tool in our attempts to garner intelligence from detainees. We export prisoners to 'black sites' run by the CIA which operate with­out Congressional oversight and send other detainees to allied countries where oversight does not exist and human rights are scoffed at. 
We've surrendered our principles to the Bush administration, allowing the war on terror to proceed without the hindrances of checks and balances, over­sight and transparency, features of our democracy which were earned through the sacrifices of previous generations. Habeus corpu~, one of the greatest inventions of civilization and one of the most fundamental of American rights, has been suspended for many detainees. We've now developed the hubris as a nation to imprison people indefinitely, without charge. 
Essentially, we're still living the every­day American way of life. In that respect, al Qaeda has failed. However, America, the nation, is not sustaining the American values of life. We've never prided ourselves as a nation because of our constant supply of butter during wartime, our ability to artificially deflate gas prices, or our ability to banish the harsh realities of war to the 24-hour news cycle, and we shouldn't start now. America is not tyranny and torture, hubris and hypocrisy, ignorance and ide­ology. America is the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Emancipation Proclamation, the victory at D-Day, the "I Have A Dream" speech, the Bible, the Torah and the Koran. 
There's a well-known picture on my wall of "the unknown rebel," a solitary man blocking a column of Chinese tanks advancing towards the protests in Tiananmen Square. Against all odds, he stands in the face of glaring injustice and oppression. While the answer has histor­ically been clear, we, as citizens of America, have to ask ourselves: are we the man, or are we the tank?

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Notre Dame ROTC vital to the nation 
Faith an important part ofofficer corps 
I would like to clear up many misconceptions that some students, faculty and concerned Catholics may hold regarding the Notre Dame ROTC program and the Catholic mission of Notre Dame. I applaud the many righteous causes for which the Catholic Worker movement has stood over the past several decades. However, I do not believe they have a valid reason to protest ROTC at Notre Dame. 
While being an active member of the Air Force ROTC unit, I became very confused about the ethics of war during my junior year at Notre Dame. I spoke with Father Warner, the ROTC chap­lain, and read up on St. Augustine's "Just War Theory." I came to the conclusion that war is an unfortunate yet necessary evil, because ifwe do not act, more innocent lives may be lost. We would be committing sins of omission if we were to sit idle and allow aggressors to destroy nations. 
Now, I do not want to parallel this idea to our current war over­seas. That is opening up a whole new can of worms. However, it is inevitable that this nation will always have a military and therefore a need for military officers. I feel more comfortable that many of these ranks are being filled by ethically sound and theologically­educated Notre Dame graduates who understand the sacredness of life and that war is a last resort, and not always a solution to every problem. Our military is far from perfect, but without Notre Dame's Christian presence in the officer corps, it now becomes much less perfect. 
Captain Greg Bergman alumnus Vandalia, Ohio March 30 

No dehumanizing in military 
curriculum 
This letter is in response to Bradley Jenkins' Letter to the Editor ("Protests aimed at solidari­ty," March 29) on protesting the presence of ROTC on the Notre Dame campus. I applaud Mr. Jenkins' activism and work to create peace in the world. Nobody wants that more than the military members that serve in harm's way far away from their friends and family. 
However, I do find objection with his assertion that the ROTC program "systematically trains many of our noblest young men and women to dehumanize the other and surrender their con­science." First of all, our students are taught Just War Theory along with the teachings of St. Augustine and Thomas Aquinas. They are also taught Divine Law and Natural Law and discuss how all of this fits with the teachings of the Catholic Church. They are vot taught to surren­der their conscience but are instead taught to search their conscience and ask if there are conflicts between their moral and religious beliefs and military operations that they might be engaged in. During that discussion they learn what courses of actions are available to them if they find themselves in an irreconcilable position. 
Secondly, ROTC students are also taught the Conduct of War and how honorable people treat enemy combatants. Much of the "moral armor" of the military profession is that we perform our mission not out of emotion or hatred but simply because it is our professional duty. In fact, dehumanizing your enemy would make us something less human and that is exactly what our moral code works to prevent. What is more noble than somebody that has taken an oath to defend our country and our way of life? And if we see a need to have that capability, then wouldn't our country be well served to have Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students as part of that that noble profession? I ask that you not confuse the issues around an unpopular war and those specific to being in the military. 
Coincidentally, in the same issue of The Observer there was a front page article about a speaker calling students to action to stop the genocide in Darfur. While I think that there are many things that people could do to affect the situation indirectly, eventually somebody is going to have to stop the killing. The harsh real­ity is that it probably means somebody taking direct action to stop the bad guys. The other part of that reality is that it may involve military action and taking a life to save a life. My ques­tion to you, Mr. Jenkins, is, "Who is going to do that?"

Moses commands sin to be put to death 
To my mind, no one has yet responded adequately to Xavier Lebec's charge ("First Down Moses underlies negative atti­tudes about other religions," March 27) that "First Down Moses" celebrates religious terrorism. Mark Flanagan ("Greater complexity to 'honorable' Moses," March 30) rightly observes that Nick Bloom's letter ("Moses was an honorable man," March 29) more confirms than answers it. But Flanagan's solution presents a Vatican II severed from the Tradition which gave it life. 
The Church realized that the Bible contains apparent atroci­ties long before Vatican II. Eighteen centuries ago, the Church Father Origen wrote that Scripture contains things that "can­not be believed to have happened appropriately and reason­ably." How should we read them? Echoing ancient Tradition, Vatican II reminds us to pay "attention ... to the content and unity of the whole of Scripture." For Christians, this "content and unity" is Jesus Christ. In the light of Christ, what does the command to "kill your brother, your friend and your neighbor" mean? Whom should I kill? Clearly not my enemies, for whom Christ commanded me to pray (Matt 5:44). Clearly not Christ's enemies, before whom Cluist commanded me to put away my sword (Matt 26:52). Who then must be put to death? Christians must hear in Moses' command St. Paul's exhortation to "put to death" (Col 3:5) all those sins that we have embraced as broth­er, friend, and neighbor. We must violently topple these golden calves which we have built and live for the one Lord. 
It is worth squeezing in one final and suggestive observation. It was the very jewelry taught by the Fathers to signify all that "is true and holy in [EJther] religions" that was distorted and misshapen into that golden idol. Part of the sin was therefore an abuse of that "ray of truth" which other religions "reflect." Perhaps my interpretation is unconvincing. But as Lebec insightf'ully pointed out, "whether or not the story is literally true does not matter as much as the fact that people accept its message as sacred." The Catholic Church considers the Bible sacred insofar as its message is Christ. A Catholic University honors religious images for the same reason. "First Down Moses" proclaims only that same message ever proclaimed by the Church: Jesus Christ alone is Lord.

Drinking is a personal choice 
As the daughter of a Domer, I saw the envy in my father's eyes when he dropped me off at school for the first time. 'Td give anything to go back," he even admitted. While I've heard a fair share of his college stories, his longing is not to relive his craziest nights but rather to regain the freedom he had as a college student. 
We've all heard that college is the best four years of our lives. In my experience in the past two years, I've learned that this is because in college we have more free time than we'll ever have again and can choose to do whatever we want with it. Never again will I be able to take two-hour naps at whim. Although I shudder at I the preceding thought, my real nightmare is others telling me what to do with my free time here, and unfor­1 
tunately it's becoming a reality. In my opinion, ifsomeone wants to spend his or her free time drinking alco­hol, it's their choice. While I hope that they are safe about it, they shouldn't have to answer anyone's inquiry as to why. If someone doesn't want to spend their free time that way, then they don't have to. All I ask is that they don't condemn others who choose differently. 
In regards to our reputation, I think it's safe from tarnish. One is the number of alumni that have expressed their disappointment about alcohol consumption at Notre Dame. I'd say a couple hundred is the number of alumni that have offered me alcohol before football games. And I'm willing to bet over a thousand is the num­ber of alumni that'd be disappointed ifNotre Dame took away my choice to say, "Yes."

DVD REVIEWS 
'Wild Bunch' bleeds brilliant cinema violence 
By BRIAN DOXTADER Senior Staff Writer 
Sam Peckinpah's 1969 classic "The Wild Bunch" is one of the defining west­erns, a blaze of glory that signaled the end of the genre in a traditional sense. 
As a reaction against the cold operat­ics of Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, it demonstrated that Hollywood still understood the genre better than anyone -although by subverting its own con­ventions, "The Wild Bunch" also brought closure to the genre that would not be revisited until Clint Eastwood's 1992 Best Picture winner "Unforgiven." 
"The Wild Bunch" is the story of Pike Bishop (William Holden, in one of his finest performances), who is the leader of the eponymous group, along with Dutch (Ernest Borgnine), Angel (Jaime Sanchez) and brothers Lyle and Tector Gorch (Warren Oates and Ben Johnson). At the start of the film, the Bunch botch­es a robbery and flees to Mexico. As Bishop starts to realize that their brand of outlaw justice is becoming antiquated, he comes to grips with his aging philoso­phies and decides to go out in one final confrontation. 

Peckinpah's film is a symbolic explo­ration of changing times. Set in 1910, it features aging men trying to understand a changing world. Ultimately, the Bunch realizes that they too have become out­dated and must face their destiny the only way they know how. "The Wild Bunch" has become revered for its por­trayals and characterization, and while the film is very violent (especially in its opening and closing confrontations), it has much more on its mind than being a typical Western. 
For a long time, "The Wild Bunch" was only available as a two-sided DVD that split up the movie. It has finally been released in a two-disc special edi­tion from Warner Bros. that preserves the original director's cut on a single disc (the second disc houses the special features). 
The picture quality, which preserves the original widescreen ratio, is very good -the image appears to have be.en cleaned up from the previous release, and the transfer is noticeably better, with a high contrast that highlights the cinematography. 
As with most Warner Bros. releases, the special features are informative and plentiful. There is commentary from Peckinpah biographers/documentarians Nick Redman, Paul Seydor, Garner Simmons and David Weddle. They relay a lot of information to the audience, though they often get sidetracked with unrelated anecdotes and stories about the director. 


There are also three documentaries: "Sam Peckinpah's West: Legacy of a Hollywood Renegade," which is a fea­ture-length biography. This is one of the best extras to come around in a while, and it sheds a lot of light on a director known for his outrageously violent films. 
Peckinpah also directed such classics as "Straw Dogs" and "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid." The other features include a short called "The Wild Bunch: An Album in Montage" and a documentary called "A Simple Adventure Story: Sam Peckinpah, Mexico and the Wild Bunch." 
It was a long time coming, but "The Wild Bunch" has finally been released on a DVD worthy of its classic status. While it isn't as spectacular as the treatment given to other classic films, Warner's update of the 1969 classic adds a lot to Peckinpah's best film. For those who have never seen "The Wild Bunch," the two-disc special edition is an excellent way to become acquainted with one of America's best westerns.

'Stick It' DVD stumbles, bumbles to perfect zero 
By MARTY SCHROEDER Assistant Scene Editor 
Why famed actor Jeff Bridges ever decided to act in the girl-power, gymnas­tics-themed "Stick It" is a question that will never be answered. The delinquent­turned-athletic star plot has been around the street more times than can be counted -and this time its gymnastics instead of cheerleading, softball or the myriad of sports they've picked to make similar films. 
"Stick It" stars Missy Peregrym as the middle-finger-in-the-air, punk rocker Haley Graham who enrolls in a presti­gious gymnastics school after getting in

trouble with the law. The dramatic conceit twists when it's revealed she's a former gymnastics star who walked out of the world championships dooming the American team to infamy. The problem is those with a sense of musical history will recognize the producers pulled out every stereotypical punker t-shirt they could find to make Graham seem more "rebel­lious." Instead, it only comes across as completely ridiculous and Graham seems more cliche than character. 
Jeff Bridges, who has no business being in a film like this, plays Graham's gymnas­tics coach Burt Vickerman -a rough rebel coach who eschews rules in favor of punchy and new routines. Bridges immor­tal 'The Dude' from "The Big Lebowski" is nowhere to be found here. He performs Vickerman well, but it does not come close to the other roles he's played. They say all actors make had films -"Stick It" most certainly counts as one for Bridges. 
Other than the two aforementioned characters, "Stick It" is filled with cookie­cutter high school guys, gymnast girls who swoon around guys, dumb blondes, bitchy brunettes and a host of stereotypes who run around the movie like a virus destroying any credibility the film still maintained. 
Written by Jessica Bendinger, who wrote the tween-flick "Aquamarine" and the cheerleading epic "Bring It On," "Stick It" marked her directorial debut -and she does both equally ineptly. With too many !-hate-my-parents style quips from Graham and too much l'm-the-wise­coach-listen-to-me sagacities from Bridges, the dialogue sounds forced and the direction stilted. 
This isn't to say "Stick It" has no redeeming qualities. The routines the gymnasts (or their stunt doubles) perform really are sights to behold. While not a documentary about gymnastics training, "Stick It" does give a flavor of the grueling training it takes to be a world-class gym­nast, and a certain well of appreciation springs up for competitors who represent their countries at athletic competitions. 


The DVD is a single-disc edition that includes the film and little beyond one extra that showcases the gymnasts' stunt doubles in the film. Also, the commen­taries on the DVD are somewhat insight­ful, but a film that was poorly executed will not have much to say. There are deleted scenes and two music videos ­hardly anything valuable. . 
"Stick It" is not a good film -it is a film that has a positive message and showcas­es some amazing gymnastic talent. Some of the routines are mind-blowingly good, while almost all of the acting is mind­blowingly bad. 
A film like this will never see any more treatment beyond its single-disc bare­bones DVD. Your little sister might like it, but you should stick it to the movie studios by not buying it and keep them from ever releasing a film like this again.

Brush up on lingo before Final Four tips off 
Shakespeare once wrote, "What's in a name?" Well no offense to William, but when it comes to the wide world of basket­ball, using the proper terminology when watching and playing the game is crucial, as it can either bolster your street cred or expose you worse than a throwback pair of high shorts. For exam­ple, you never want to be caught quoting Bill Walton. While watch­ing March Madness, it would be disastrous to yell out "Throw it down, big man!" after a particularly fierce slam dunk. Glances would be cast side­ways and you might find people slowly shuffling away from you on the sofa. As a result, here's a quick compilation of some of the latest and great­est court comments. 
+"Dummy," verb, to block someone's shot. Synonyms: to stuff, to reject. Usage: "Oh man, did you see Oden dummy that 
?"
guy. 
+"Hops," noun, the ability to jump high. Synonymsfmterchangeable phrases: "to get up" (as in, "Ohman, he really got up there) and "bunnies" ("Nate Robinson is only 5­foot-7, but boy does he have bunnies.") 
+"Cookies," grammatical part unknown. Exclamation: "Cookies!" is usually shouted during a game if one player loses control of the ball and an opposing player steals it. The origins of this phrase remain 

Tae Andrews 
Scene Editor 

unknown, but it is rumored that its birth has something to do with the age-old rhyme, "Who stole the cookies from the cookie jar?" etcetera. 
+"Handle(s)," singular and plural noun. The ability to dribble the ball well. Usage: "Ohman, Steve Nash has sick handles" would be a good choice to use as the mop­top hero bounces around the court. 
+"To get sick with it." Related phrases: "To get nasty," "to get up." This phrase can refer to a variety of things, but is mainly related to dazzling plays, as in "Oh gid­dyup! Tim Duncan just got sick with it all over Carmelo Anthony's face." It's usually said as, "sick wit it." Not to be confused with "getting jiggy with it." 
+"Ballin'," noun. This word has a lot of meanings (and also inspired the current hip-hop smash single by Jim Jones). "Ballin"' refers to succeeding at any walk in life, but especially on the court or in making a lot of money (synonyms: scrilla, cheddar, bread, etc.) Usage: "Wow, Manu Ginobili is just ballin' right now." 
+To "break someone's ankles" is to cause them to stumble, trip up on their own feet and perhaps even fall down after juking them with a nasty crossover. 
+"Teardrop," noun. Synonym: "floater." A high-arcing shot usually launched by a shorter player over a taller one, which con­cludes its journey going through the hoop. Usage: "Wow, Tony Parker just floated that teardrop shot over Elton Brand and in!" 
+To "have game" actually has two defi­nitions: one, the ability to successfully woo a female by use of smooth conversation and two, the quality of being a good bas-ketball player, as in the hit film "He Got Game," featuring Denzel Washington and Ray "Jesus Shuttlesworth" Allen. 

+"Mercin'," verb, to generally inflict pain and destruction; to bring ruin to another's doorstep; to impose one's will on the game. Usage: "Kobe Bryant is just mer­cin' right now. No one in the league can stop him." 
+"Kicks," noun, basketball shoes (or just shoes in general). As in, "Oh man, nice kicks! I didn't know you had copped that pair of white-on-white Air Force Ones." 
+"Facial," noun. Related term "posteri­zation." A bone-jarring dunk delivered with ferocious intensity as one player rises above another, usually less athletic player (or a player who just so happens to be in 
-
the wrong place at the wrong time) and slams the ball home, usually to raucous applause. 
+Also, any phraseology from the vintage video game "NBA Jam" is fair game: phrases such as "boom-shaka-laka," "raz­zle dazzle" and "is it the shoes?" have enduring relevance. Of course, if you have any questions , concerns or comments, feel free to contact our very own campus Merriam Webster of basketball terminolo­gy, Hudson Sullivan.

DVD REVIEW 
'Ghost' DVD remains timeless tale of true love 
By ERIN McGINN Assistant Scene Editor 
In the canon of so-called "chick flicks," Jerry Zucker's "Ghost" is always ranked near the top. Although it first appeared onscreen 17 years ago, it still remains as romantic and endearing as a movie could be. A special collector's edition of "Ghost" was recently released, and it includes a number of additional extras that make it a very worthy purchase. 
The film tells the story of a young cou­ple, Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) and Molly Jensen (Demi Moore), whose love is shattered when Sam is slain in a seemingly senseless event. Although he's dead, Sam's spirit still lingers on earth. He realizes he is stuck as a ghost so he can solve his murder. In his quest to find his killer, he teams up with Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg), a psychic and the only person who is able to talk to him. Through Oda Mae, Sam and Molly are able to once more reconnect their love, and along the way they hunt for his killer, discovering a deeper and more vengeful act than what his murder first appeared to be. 

"Ghost" won two Academy Awards: one for the screenplay, and the other for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for Whoopi Goldberg. Goldberg's perform­ance as a fake psychic who actually sees the ghost of Sam is definitely top-notch, and that alone is worth a watch. The late Vincent Schiavelli also puts in a sur­prisingly memorable performance, albeit a short one, as the subway ghost who helps Sam deal with his (literally) spiri­tual condition. Following suit are per­formances by both Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze who shine as the film's focus. 
Interestingly enough, as the documen­tary "The Making of a Classic" points out, the producers and director had no desire for Patrick Swayze to play the lead. He had just finished the movie "Road House," which was not received well by audiences or critics. Although they did not contact him for the part, Swayze read the script and asked if he could audition. It was only after his reading that the producers and director decided to cast Swayze in the role. Similarly, Goldberg got involved only after friends showed her the script and urged her to try out. 
This documentary, as well as the other features, makes the special edition a great purchase, even for fans who already have the original DVD edition. The documentary also intersperses footage of the actors on the set -which is unique and interesting to watch in relation to the characters the actors and actresses play -as well as new inter­views from both Goldberg and Swayze. Scene dissection analyzes the making of the well known "pottery scene" between Moore and Swayze and an "Inside the Paranormal" featurette showcases inter­views from real psychics and mediums who talk about their experiences. The commentary track features Zucker and screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin, who focus on elements of the script as well as the special effects work that was done for the film. 

"Ghost" is easily one of the best films that deal with paranormal elements in the real world. It manages to be roman­tic without being sappy and humorous without losing its important and weighty message. While it is nearly two decades old, "Ghost" tells the kind of timeless story that will always have a place in people's hearts.

KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. ­
Novak Djokovic whacked 
the tournament's final 
shot for a winner, then 
collapsed on his back, 
sprawled at the baseline. 
Djokovic rose to 
embrace his opponent and 
climbed into the stands to 
hug his parents. He 
returned to the court and 
threw his shirt and racket 
to the cheering crowd. 
The kid plays with flair 
and celebrates the same 
way. 
Djokovic succeeded 
where Roger Federer 
failed, beating qualifier 
Guillermo Canas 6-3, 6-2, 
6-4 Sunday to win the 
Sony Ericsson Open. 

Canas upset the top­ranked Federer twice last month, including in the fourth round Tuesday. But the 29-year-old Argentine's relentless baseline game failed to faze the 19-year-old Djokovic, who dominated with his versatile shot­making and held every service game. 
"I hope this is only the start," said Djokovic, run­ner-up at Indian Wells, Calif., two weeks ago. "I was always trying to com­pare myself to the best players in the world, because that's what I want to be. Right now I feel like probably for the first time in my career I'm on that level, that I deserve to be one of the three best play­ers in the world." 
Seeded 1Oth, Dj okovic will improve to a career­high No. 7 in the rankings Monday. With his first ATP Masters Series title, the slender Serb became the youngest men's champion in the tournament's 23­year history. 
Djokovic won every set he played _ the first time the Key Biscayne men's champion has done that since Ivan Lendl in 1989. 
"Tennis has a new star today," tournament chair­man Butch Buchholz said. "He's going to be around." 
Djokovic has already put Serbia back on the tennis map. The nation touts a modest tennis tradition aside from Monica Seles, a nine-time Grand Slam champion who was in the crowd Sunday. 
''I'm very happy about that because she was one of my idols when I was young," Djokovic said. 
The crowd roared when Djokovic skipped a fore­hand winner off the base­line on match point, and his exuberant celebration kept the cheers coming. Once he was shirtless, he waved his racket in sever­al directions before throwing it to a delighted young woman in the front row.

Scott nails SOfoot putt on final hole to finish 3 strokes ahead ofpack 
Associated Press 
HUMBLE, Texas-Adam Scott came to the Houston Open starv­ing for the stress of competition to prepare him for the Masters. 
He got what he needed from fel­low Australian Stuart Appleby. 
Scott held off Appleby with a 6­under 66 on Sunday, saving par with a 50-foot putt on the 72nd hole after hitting his tee shot into the water. 
Scott finished at 17 under, three strokes ahead of Appleby, the defending champion, and third­round leader Bubba Watson. 
Scott said before the tourna­ment that he was rusty after tak­ing a month off earlier this year. He tied for 61st at Doral and was pleasantly surprised how well his game held up under pressure this week heading into the Masters. 
"It was good for me to play in the heat of the battle again," Scott said. "Just to know how to control your nerves will be good for me." 
Playing together, Scott led Appleby by one stroke as they stood on the 18th tee, but Scott pulled his tee shot into the pond that lines the left side of the 488­yard hole, the course's most diffi­cult. 
Scott immediately had a flash­back to the 2004 Players Championship, when he had a two-shot lead on the final day and pulled a 6-iron into the water on the 72nd hole. 

"I don't know. Water on the left," Scott said. "It's not ideal for me, obviously." 
He salvaged a winning bogey at Sawgrass and got away with it again Sunday. 
Appleby drove into the fairway bunker, then immediately gave Scott a reprieve by hitting his approach into the water near the green. 
"I knew what I had to do," Appleby said. "It's just a matter of you've got to do it. And I didn't get to do it." 
Scott took his drop, hit his approach safely away from the water, then holed the par-saving putt. He pumped his fist, Tiger Woods-style, after the ball disap­peared and the crowd roared. 
"It was relief, along with ela­tion," said Scott, who earned his first win since last year's Tour Championship. "I was pretty happy for it to be all over with, because it was looking a bit messy." 
Appleby took a double bogey to finish with a 69. But it was easily his best finish of the year and filled him with confidence heading to Augusta. 
"I like the way I hit the ball," he said. "I want to get there (to Augusta) and get set for that. I'm ready to go." 
Watson, searching for his first win, birdied the last hole for a 72. 
Scott became the sixth Australian to win the Houston Open, joining Appleby, Bruce Devlin, Bruce Crampton, David Graham and Robert Allenby. Appleby and Crampton have won it twice and the eight victories by Australians are the most in any 
U.S. tour event. Only the British Open (9) has had more champions from Down Under. 
Appleby joked that it eased the sting of losing to know that anoth­er Aussie won. 
"Marginally," Appleby said. 

The 26-year-old Scott spent four weeks in Europe before returning at Doral. He shot a final-round 80 _ including a 10 on one hole _ and wasn't optimistic before the Houston Open started. 
But his swing held up all week and his putting improved with each round, even when his nerves started to fray. 
"I really needed to be in con­tention this week and take some­thing out of it," Scott said. "I can feed off that for next week now." 
Appleby and Scott started the day three shots behind Watson, but caught him with birdies on three of their first five holes. The Aussies matched each other shot for shot from there until Appleby bogeyed the par-3 14th and lost the lead for good. 
Scott hit two mammoth 3-woods to reach the 608-yard 15th hole and he two-putted to move to 17 under. Appleby bogeyed the 16th, then birdied the 17th to set up the tense finish. 
AP Adam Scott, right, of Australia, shakes hands with Stuart Appleby after winning the Shell Houston Open Sunday. 
"It's funny what happens com­ing down the stretch," Scott said. "We were solid all day and all of a sudden, you know, a couple of funny shots happened." 
Players were allowed to lift, clean and place their balls in the fairway for the second straight day after a morning thunderstorm dumped a half-inch of rain. 
Storms Saturday morning post­poned the start of the third round for six hours and Watson was one of 27 players who came back Sunday morning to finish. 
Watson bogeyed two of the three holes he played as the sun came up, but still shot an 8-under 64, which tied the course record set on Saturday by Johnson Wagner. 
Wagner, a 27 -year-old tour rookie, started the final round in a five-way tie at 11 under, along with Scott, Appleby, Houston resi­dent Jeff Maggert and Paul Stankowski.

Rutgers uses stifling defense to defeat LSU 
Tigers score fewest points ever in women's Final Four game; Scarlet Knights earn first berth in national championship 
Associated Press 
CLEVELAND --Rutgers' improbable run isn't over. 
The Scarlet Knights earned their first trip to the national championship behind Hall of Fame coach C. Vivian Stringer with another unlikely scenario --dominating the LSU Lady Tigers from the opening tip. 
Matee Ajavon scored 16 points and Rutgers (27 -8) hounded 6-foot-6 Sylvia Fowles to beat LSU 59-35 in a national semifinal Sunday night. The Scarlet Knights used a swarm­ing defense and hot touch from behind the arc to blow out LSU, which scored the fewest points ever in the Final Four -­Louisiana Tech had 44 vs. Tennessee in '87 title game. 
Frustrated by Rutgers' relent­less defenders, Fowles was held to five points and seven rebounds. 
Rutgers double-and triple­teamed Fowles, with Vaughn getting help from Heather Zurich. 
"I tried to keep her as far away from the basket as I 
could," Vaughn said. 
The Lady Tigers (30-8), who were making their fourth straight Final Four appearance, ended a surprising tournament run behind acting head coach Bob Starkey. He was thrust into the spotlight when

opening whistle and never improved. Kia Vaughn won the tip after Fowles appeared unready and barely got off the ground. 
Ajavon hit a 3-pointer and Rutgers broke out to a 12-2 lead in the first 5 minutes, sending the Rutgers cheering section to its feet. 
Fowles was held to 1-for-4 shooting over that span and unbelievably didn't take another shot until the closing seconds of the half. A defender knocked her headband askew on the play and she missed, then screamed out in anger as she ran down the court. 
When Vaughn got her second foul midway through the first half, it seemed Fowles might get her chances after all. 
But freshman Rashidat Junaid held her own against Fowles. With three freshman on the floor, Rutgers increased its lead to 21 on another Ajavon 3­pointer late in the first half. 
LSU went right to Fowles on the first possession of the sec­ond half and she scored easily, but got nothing else going the rest of the way. 
"She was a little frustrated," -Ajavon said. "It was just a defensive effort.... We're here to stay."

Besides qualifying her for the regional meet, that time put her among the country's leaders. "Molly Huddle ran very, very well, probably one of the top three or four times in the coun­try right now," Piane said. Senior Amy Kohlmeier's time of 16:51.26 in the 5,000 meters was good enough to qualify her for the regionals as well.

ND shut out in Columbus 
By DEIRDRE KRASULA Sports Writer 
Notre Dame almost forgot how to lose, winning 11 straight meets and dropping only 14 matches over that stretch. But the Irish were forced to peel themselves off the pavement Friday night, falling 7-0 to Ohio State in Columbus. 
''I'm still trying to get the number of the truck that hit us in Columbus," Notre Dame coach Bobby Bayliss said. "[Ohio State] played aggressive­ly and really well. They didn't make many mistakes." 
The No. 3 Buckeyes jumped ahead in the match by winning doubles play, the 43rd time in their last 47 matches that they have won the doubles point. 
Buckeyes Drew Eberly and Justin Kronauge defeated No. 7 Ryan Keckley and Sheeva Parbhu 8-6 at the No. 1 doubles position. Devin Mullings and Chris Klingemann then secured the doubles point for Ohio State with an 8-5 win over Barry King and Brett Helgeson. Notre Dame's only glimmer of hope came when the No. 3 doubles team of Stephen Bass and Andrew Roth knocked off Steven Moneke and Bryan Koniecko 9-7. 
With the doubles point in hand, Ohio State went on to sweep Notre Dame in singles 
play. No. 10 Moneke knocked off No. 8 Bass with a 6-1, 6-4 victory at the No. 1 spot. No. 25 Bryan Koniecko then defeated No. 54 Parbhu 4-6, 6-1, 6-2. Third in line for the Buckeyes was No. 34 Mullings, who cruised past Helgeson with a 6­2, 6-0 victory. 
Despite falling to Ohio State Friday night, the No. 5 Irish battled back to post a 5-2 win over No. 6 Illinois at home Sunday. 
Bayliss said the win over the Fighting Illini somewhat redeemed the loss to the Buckeyes. 
"If you lay an egg once a year and you bounce back they way we did today, it's OK," he said. 
Illinois jumped ahead to the early 1-0 lead after taking the doubles point. Kevin Anderson and Ryan Rowe defeated Keckley and Parbhu 8-4. Marc Spicijaric and G.D. Jones clinched the doubles point with an 8-4 win over King and Helgeson. 
Bayliss said he challenged his team to bounce back from the 1-0 deficit and they answered. 
Roth was first off the courts for the Irish with a 6-1,6-2 rout of Jordan Knue. Keckley fol­lowed suit with a 6-4, 6-4 win over Brandon Davis. 
Parbhu did not have as easy a win over Jones. The Irish junior dropped the first set 2-6, but rallied for the 2-6, 6-2, 6-3 win. 
King clinched the win for he Irish with a 6-7 (5), 6-1, 6-2 win over Spicijaric. After forc­ing the first set into a tiebreak­er and folding, King came back aggressively for the win. 
"Barry showed an aggressive­ness that I haven't seen before," Bayliss said. "And to me it's a sign of his maturity and growth as a player and as a competitor." 
Even with the win in Notre Dame's name, the battle wasn't over on the courts. 
No. 8 Bass continued to battle with No. 6 Anderson at No. 1 singles. Bass dropped the first set 4-6 but fought back to take the second set 6-2. Down 5-4 in the third set with Anderson serving for match point, the senior broke serve to eventually take the set 7-5 and win the match. 
Helgeson also put up a fight against No. 12 Rowe, but was unable to pull away with a vic­tory as Rowe defeated him 4-6, 6-4, 7-5. 
Despite losing to Ohio State Friday, Bayliss said that he was happy with his team's perform­ance this weekend. 
"We knew we were playing two top-1 0 teams in three days and that's a big load," he said. "And we wanted to make sure we got at least once of the wins, and today we made that hap­pen."

Linksters place 17th in 
loaded Augusta field 
By CHRIS DOYEN Sports Writer 
In a battle of 10 teams in the top 50 nationally, Notre Dame could not overcome the behe­moths in the field of 18 teams in the Administaff Augusta State Invitational, finishing in 17th place. 
Notre Dame's final score of a 20-over-par 884 put them 31 strokes behind first-place No. 11 Coastal Carolina. Other national powerhouses in the field includ­ed No. 13 East Tennessee State, No. 15 Tennessee, No. 17 North Carolina and No. 29 Georgia State, who all placed in the top six and fmished at par or lower. 
"We didn't get it together like we had hoped to," senior co­captain and All-America candi­date Cole Isban said. "You've got to expect those other teams to perform like they did, but we didn't have our best games." 
The Irish struggled in the sec­ond round especially, scoring a 12-over-par 300 Saturday. 
Before the tournament, Isban predicted that putting would be the most important aspect for Notre Dame's success, and it was his personal undoing for the weekend as he finished with a four-over-par 220. 
"I couldn't make a put to save my life," Isban said. "But a cou­ple other guys putted pretty well. I hit about 16 or 17 greens in regulation, but I had a num­ber of three-putts [on Sunday]." 
The team's performance was good enough, however, to place ahead of one of the participating top-50 programs, No. 28 Minnesota. Irish senior co-cap­tain Adam Gifford, who only recently started traveling with the team, finished tied for eighth with a team-low two­under-par 214. 
His three-under-par 69 Sunday helped the Irish finish the day at a respectable two­over-par 290. Gifford was the only Irish golfer to fmish in the top-40 on the individual leader­board. 
"[Gifford] played probably the best tournament of his career," Isban said. "His game is really coming around." 
The lineup for the weekend also included sophomore Josh Sandman, freshman Doug Fortner and junior Eddie Peckels. Sandman finished with a five-over-par 221, Fortner shot a 13-over-par 229 and Peckels contributed a 25-over­par 241. 
Next weekend, the Irish head to Purdue to participate in the Boilermaker Invitational.

Wheaton, Olivet upend Belles over weekend 
By ELLYN MICHALAK SportS Writer 
The competition in this week­end's Wheaton Invitational proved to be too tough for Saint Mary's. The Belles fell twice, once to tour­nament-host Wheaton College and then again to Olivet Nazarene to finish 0-2 on their trip into Illinois. 
Wheaton easily defeated the Belles 9-0 in their first match to add another win to its perfect record. 
"Wheaton College is definitely one of the top teams, if not the top team, in the Midwest," Belles coach Dee Stevenson said. 
In the first individual match of the Invitational opener Friday, Wheaton sophomore All­American Jordan Hook defeated Belles captain Kelly McDavitt in straight sets, 6-1 and 6-0. Belles freshman Camille Gebert did not have much luck in the No. 2 sin­gles spot, where she was defeated 7-5 and 6-0 by freshman Christin Thompson. 
In the third match of the day, Thunder senior Karly Olson defeated Belles freshman Lisa Rubino 6-2 and 6-3. In the follow­ing match, senior Tara O'Brien failed to win a game against Thunder junior Shannon Hale, falling in straight 6-0 sets. 
In the fifth singles spot, Saint Mary's junior Cassie Quaglia com­peted against Wheaton junior Brooke Parrish and lost 6-2 and 6-0. In the final singles matchup of the day, Thunder sophomore Brittney Dunn overcame Belles senior Grace Gordon with a score of 6-0 in two straight sets. 

The Belles put forth a stronger effort in the doubles matches, but Wheaton continued to shut down Saint Mary's. The Thunder dou­bles team of Hook and Olson defeated the Belles No. 1 doubles team of Gebert and McDavitt 8-1. In the second doubles match, Belles doubles partners Gordon and O'Brien fell to Dunn and Thompson by a score of 8-1. In the final doubles match of the day, Wheaton's Parrish and Hale defeated Saint Mary's Rubino and O'Brien 8-2. 
The Belles entered Saturday's match looking to defeat Olivet Nazarene for the second straight year, but Olivet Nazarene pro­duced a different result. Saint Mary's lost the match 8-1, while Gordon in the number six singles spot was the only Belle to win. 
"We didn't play particularly well in that match," Stevenson said. "Certainly not up to our full potential." 
McDavitt put forth a strong effort in the No. 1 singles spot, but lost the match in three close sets. Rubino played well in the third spot, battling until the super tiebreaker of the third set.

Irish sweep Big East foes 
By MICHAEL BRYAN Sports Writer 

When Notre Dame began playing back home at Ivy Field March 22, it was 9-12 and coming off a three-game los­ing streak. Since then, the Irish have played 10 straight games at home -all wins ­most recently sweeping dou­bleheaders against Pittsburgh and Syracuse this weekend. 
After a two-hour rain delay Saturday, the Irish (19-12, 8-0 Big East) extended their domi­nance over Pittsburgh (14-21, 2-3) with back-to-hack 4-0 wins. 
The first game remained scoreless until the third inning, when Irish catcher Gessica Hufnagle singled home lert fielder Beth Northway to put Notre Dame on the board. Shortstop Katie Laing then drove Hufnagle in to put the Irish up 2-0. 
Notre Dame put up another two runs in the fourth inning, with center fielder Stephanie Brown's two-run single. Brown had three hits on the game, her fifth three-hit per­formance of the year. 
Irish hurler Brittney Bargar continued her sparkling pitch­ing at home, throwing a com­plete-game shutout against the Panthers. Bargar, a sopho­more, struck out eight and allowed only two hits in the win, her 11th of the season. 
The Irish enjoyed similar 
success in the circle in the second game behind senior Kenya Fuemmeler. Fuemmeler threw a three-hit, complete­game shutout, striking out seven and walking only one for her sixth win of the sea­son. 
Offensively, the Irish manu­factured a run in the bottom of the first when a Laing sacri­fice fly drove home Brown. Notre Dame would not score again until the fifth, when Brown scored on a Laing field­er's choice. Laing then scored all the way from first on third baseman Heather Johnson's double. 
The Irish added an insur­ance run in the sixth with an RBI from right fielder Ashley Ellis for the 4-0 win. 
Notre Dame faced off against Syracuse (1 0-24, 3-5) Sunday and continued its pitching dominance. 
ln the first game, the Irish posted their third shutout in a row with a 7-0 victory over the Orange. Bargar pitched her second shutout in as many days, throwing one-hit ball for six innings while striking out seven. 
Notre Dame seized the lead early, scoring three runs in the bottom of the first. Northway doubled to drive in two runs, and first baseman Christine Lux singled her home before Syracuse could stop the bleed­ing. 
Hufnagle singled home another run in the second, and a Brown double drove in two runs in the third to give the Irish a commanding 6-0 lead. Notre Dame grabbed an insur­ance run in the sixth when Laing doubled home Brown from third. 
In the second game of the doubleheader, both teams remained scoreless for the first two innings. The Notre Dame offense exploded in the third, putting six runs on the board to break the game wide open. Johnson hit a bases­clearing double to drive home three runs, and Lux drove two in with her first career home run. 
Lux also doubled home two runs in the fourth, and a Johnson groundout scored Notre Dame's ninth run. 
The Orange finally got on the scoreboard with two runs in the fifth, but never threat­ened the Irish lead. Hufnagle singled in the bottom of the inning to give the Irish their 10th and final run. 
Brown led the Irish offen­sively on the weekend, going 12-for-15 on the weekend. Bargar and Fuemmeler's efforts gave Notre Dame a 
0.50 ERA in the four games. 
Pitching has fueled the suc­cess at home, where the Irish have allowed only six runs over the 10 games. Five of the wins in the streak have come in the form of shutouts.

Saint Mary's s"Weeps, is s"Wept in doubleheaders 
By BECKY SLINGER 
Sports Writer 
Even though Saint Mary's lost a doubleheader Saturday to Alma 9-1 and 4-0 -only its second and third losses of the season -it got its season back on track immediately by sweep­ing Manchester 10-2 and 20-0. 
In the first game against Alma, the Scots' hitters got the offense going early, scoring eight runs in the first inning off of seven hits. Belles pitcher Calli Davison, however, calmed down after the first inning, allowing only two more hits and one more run. 
The Belles failed to score a run until the fifth inning when freshman second baseman Mo Healy scored on an RBI from senior shortstop Sarah Miesle. The slaughter rule came into effect after the top of the fifth to give Alma the win. 
In their second loss to Alma, the Belles failed to score any runs on seven hits with nine runners left on base. Sophomore pitcher Kristin Amram allowed just four hits, but the Scots man­aged to capitalize on each hit. 
The two wins put Alma (17 -7) in first in the MIAA with a league record of 4-0. The Belles (13-3) are in eighth, 0-2 in the league. 
"They hit the ball really well in the first inning and jumped out on top. It's really hard to come back from being down 8-0 in the first inning," Belles junior captain McKenna Corrigan said. "They did a good job of scoring first." 
For how anemic the Belles were against Alma, they were just as effective against Manchester Sunday. Davison allowed seven hits with only two runs. Manchester freshman pitcher Kristi Brown allowed 12 hits in the 10-2 loss. 
Healy said the Belles' domi­nance of the Spartans avenged their earlier losses to Alma. 
"It's a big confidence boost. I think we were a little bit nerv­ous about playing out first con­ference game," she said. "Now that we've got that out of the way ... [we can] play to our full potential and have fun." 
In the sixth inning, sophomore second baseman Cathy Kurczak, Davison, Peterson, Healy, Miesle and sophomore catcher Ashley Fusaro all scored a run each for the Belles. In an outstanding offensive performance, Peterson also scored in the first and fourth. Sophomore first base­man Katie Rashid contributed a run in the fifth and Miesle had a run in the sixth. 
The second game against Manchester brought even better results for the Belles, who won the game 20-0, ending the game in only five innings. 
Manchester junior pitcher Tish Bitner allowed 23 hits in the loss. Amram pitched two innings and allowed just one hit before Davison pitched three innings in relief, allowing four hits. 
The Belles broke the game open in the second inning with nine hits. Freshman outfielder Sara Montelongo, Kurczak, Davison, Healy and Fusaro each scored one run. Montelongo also hit a three-run double to add to the Saint Mary's lead. Miesle scored an unearned run and had a three-run homer later in the inning, before Kurczak hit a home run in the third. 
In the fourth inning, five Belles scored unearned runs (Montelongo, Kurczak, Rashid, Peterson and Healy). Healy also singled to bat in two runs. Fusaro contributed a homerun in the fifth. 
Corrigan said the team will work on its confidence for its next league game against Hope Wednesday. 
"Our coach mentioned some­thing about having 'it.' It is the feeling you have when you know something is going to go well or the feeling you have when you're doing well," she said. "We didn't have 'it' ... against Alma. We have to make sure we have 'it' for the rest of our league games."

Makeshift squad still wins 
By CHRIS HINE Sports Editor 
Despite injuries to multiple key players, No. 2 Notre Dame extended its win streak in dual match play to 13 with a 5-2 indoor victory over No. 28 Wichita St. Friday and a 5-2 outdoor win over No. 38 Tulsa Sunday. 
The Irish (18-1) played with­out junior Brook Buck and freshman Colleen Rielley for the second straight week, forcing Irish coach Jay Louderback to move players around in both singles and doubles play. But even those that did play in the two matches this weekend were not completely healthy, Louderback said. 
"We have a few of them that are struggling with shoulders that have been playing a lot. We go inside and then we get out­side a few days," he said. "For us, I think health-wise we need to get where we can consistently get outside and get used to it. It's a tougher game outside when the wind's blowing -it's like you're hitting a ball that's heavier. It's a little more wear on the body." 
In doubles play, the nationally ranked No. 4 team of seniors Catrina and Christian Thompson won both of their matches this weekend, but at the No. 2 and 3 slots, Louderback deployed two teams that have yet to compete togeth­er in dual match play -fresh­man Kali Krisik with sophomore Kelcy Tefft, and freshman Cosmina Ciobanu with sopho­more Katie Potts. 
"It was really good with our depth," Louderback said. "I thought all three doubles teams -that was the big thing -we had two new doubles teams in both matches... It was good to see the two new doubles teams, the combinations, seeing them play well." 
The two new teams failed to miss a beat, winning all of their matches and giving the Irish the doubles point in both matches. 
Potts, who played with an injured shoulder, and Krisik replaced Rielley and Buck in singles play. Potts went 0-2 from the No. 5 slot, falling to Wichita State's Anna Egorova 6-3, 7-5 Friday and Tulsa's Agostino Santoro 4-6, 6-2, 6-1 Sunday. Krisik won both of her matches in straight sets from the No. 6 slot. 

"Katie had a couple of tough matches, lost both of hers. Kali did a good job," Louderback said. 
Rielley normally occupies the No. 3 slot. This meant that No. 62 Ciobanu and Tefft each had to move up a spot in the lineup and battle tougher competition than they would normally face. 
Both stepped up to the chal­lenge. Ciobanu and Tefft won all of their matches and played a pivotal part in Notre Dame's success this weekend by grab­bing two points in each match. Ciobanu is now 19-0 in dual match play, while Tefft improved to 13-3 this season. 
"Those two just win. They both compete well. They just win, that's all you can say. [Tefft] gets a lot of balls," Louderback said. "She doesn't overpower you, but she makes you play a lot of balls. Her forehand, she doesn't hit really hard, she'll slice it some. But she has a big backhand. It's hard to get into a rhythm against her. 
"[Ciobanu] is solid off the ground, both forehand and background, and if you give her anything loose at all she'll step in and hit it. She can hit win­ners, and just plays a smart game and is good at finishing off points." 
No. 19 Catrina Thompson dropped her match from the No. 1 slot against Wichita State's Madina Rakhim, 7-6, 6-3 Friday, but bounced back Sunday to defeat Tulsa's Kindsay Grimes 6-2, 6-2. "[Rakhim] is really good. She hadn't played any ranked kids, so she didn't have the points to be up there. She's one of the top 20 kids in the country, I think [from] watching her play, because Catrina played well." 
Christian Thompson also went 1-1 over the weekend. On Friday, Thompson defeated Wichita State's Florentina Hanisch 6-1, 6-0 but lost to Tulsa's Santie Delport 6-2, 6-1 Sunday. 
Notre Dame faces Purdue Tuesday. Louderback said he is not sure if Buck and Rielley will play against the Boilermakers. 
"We'll know [today]," he said.

sometimes it's still too close to call even when you get it down to two and then you have to make a hard decision." 
This rotation system was in full effect Saturday, when each of the four quarterbacks took turns throwing during the one­on-one drills. The quarterbacks threw to receivers up and down the depth chart and against all skill levels in defensive back. 
In the one-on-one drills, Weis made it clear that rising junior David Grimes and rising sopho­more George West are currently his top two receivers. 
Grimes -whom Weis called the most consistent receiver this spring -has the most experi­ence in an Irish uniform out of the receivers. Grimes finished last season fifth in yards (336) and receptions (26) and caught two touchdowns, one of which came during Notre Dame's 41­14 loss to LSU in the Sugar Bowl. 
But on a team that lost its top two receivers in Jeff Samardzija (78 catches, 1017 yards) and Rhema McKnight (67 catches, 907 yards) along with running back Darius Walker (56, 391), Grimes moved up the depth chart with ease. 
West lacks Grimes' experi­ence, with only two catches for 14 yards all last year, but accli­mated himself to the speed of college football by serving as a kick returner last season next to Grimes. 
"He isn't just running with that first group by default," 

Weis said of West. "At this point he's running with that first group because that's where he would be." 
Weis still hasn't made any decisions about the rest of the receivers because he said they are all too similar to make judg­ments. 
"We're just looking for people to pull ahead or fall behind," Weis said. "But there are too many guys besides David and George that are just in that pack right now." 
Regardless of the position or the players, Weis said he tries to remain balanced and objective in deciding the depth chart, and a large part of that depends on his own honesty with his team. 
"I think it's important to never lie to your players and always tell them the truth and where they stand," Weis said. "It isn't like depth charts never change. Depth charts change eventually and injuries occur on top of that. 
"That's part of being a starter and part of being a backup."

Irish midfielder 
Christman and midfielder Grant Krebs put Notre Dame up 6-1 early in the second period before the Bears' Jack Walsh found the back on the net. 
"Lacrosse is a sport of runs, and once you get up on a team, it forces them to come after you," Polk said. "Our team thrives on a fast­paced game, and when we go on a run, it forces teams to play into our hands." 
Polk set up another Irish 
goal, this time assisting attack Ryan Hoff, to extend the lead to 7-2 going into the half. Any chance of a Brown comeback was extin­guished early in the second half when goals from Wharton and Yeatman put the game out of reach. 
"Those goals were very important," Polk said. "Coming out of halftime, it's very easy to have a lull and let the other team back into the game. It really closed the door to come out and

Panthers 
continued from page 24 
offense Friday as he suffered his second loss in seven starts. The sophomore gave up four runs on eight hits and two walks in a total of six and two-thirds innings. The loss brought Phelps' ERA to 1.58. 
Designated hitter Morgan Kielty opened up the first inning for the Panthers with an RBI off of a groundout to first. Kielty shined at the plate again in the fifth with a double to drive in two additional runs -the inning saw Pittsburgh score three runs offthree hits. 
The sixth inning looked hopeful for Notre Dame as senior first baseman Mike Dury stepped up to the plate with the bases loaded. With the tying run at bat, the sen­ior struck out and missed the opportunity to bring the game to four apiece. Sophomore Eddy Mendiola cut the Panthers' lead in half with a two-run double. Brayden Ashdown scored easily with Brett Lilley not far behind him, but A.J. Pollock could not make it in time and was tagged out by catcher Nick Mullins. Mendiola's drive in the sixth was the end of offensive action for both teams. 
Notre Dame looked to threaten again in the eighth as Ashdown drew a leadoff walk off lefthander Rob Brant. The Panthers brought in righthander Kyle Landis to face Pollock. Pollock had little trouble adjusting to the pitching change and drove a single up the middle. Landis shut down the Irish drive with a strikeout and popup to end the inning and maintain the 4-2 lead. 
Notre Dame's inability to capi­talize on promising situations has been a recurring theme recently. 
"As a team we need some more guys to step up in big situations and get that big hit or get the big strikeout," Lilley said. 

Irish centerfielder Danny Dressman squares for a bunt during Notre Dame's 9-11oss to South Florida March 25. 
The Irish loss, he said, couldn't be blamed on one particular play. 
"We are going to win as a team, and we are going to lose as a team," he said. "And we lost as a team." 
Pittsburgh 5, Notre Dame 0 
Nardozzi, a righthander, pitched a two-hit shutout to pro­tect Pittsburgh's ofl'ensive drive in the middle four innings of Saturday's game. 
The matchup remained score­less until Gary Bucuren opened up from the plate for the Panthers in the third. The third baseman drove in an RBI off a sacrifice fly off Irish lefthander Wade Korpi. 
Korpi gave up another run in the fourth before retiring from the mound at the end of the inning. Junior Dan Williams, first at the plate for the Panthers, drove in a homerun to give Pittsburgh the 2­0 lead. Korpi allowed one run off two hits to end the inning. 
Junior righthander Joey Williamson took the mound for the Irish in the fifth and allowed one run. Williamson struggled from the mound again in the sixth as he allowed two more runs off two hits to increase the Panther's lead to 5-0. Williamson allowed no runs in the seventh or the eighth, but the Irish were not able to dig themselves out of the 5-0 hole. 
Nardozzi turned in nine innings from the mound for Pittsburgh, allowing only two hiL'>. 
Despite losing both games to Pittsburgh this weekend, the Irish will look to build from their trials on the road. The two losses brought the team just below the 500-mark with a 12-14 record on the season (1-4 Big East.) 
"Losing this weekend just makes each and every game from here on out that much more important, and we really have to start clicking as a team and start winning," Ulley said.

Quarterback, receiver battles headline Irish spring practices 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Associate Sports Editor 
Despite position battles on 

 both sides of the line of scrim­mage, two of the most glorified positions on the field -quarter­back and wide receiver -are still catching most people's attention. The quarterback battle is by far the most closely examined aspect of Notre Dame's spring practices, largely because of its uniq'ue nature. Irish coach Charlie Weis has four competing quarterbacks -rising junior Evan Sharpley, rising sopho­mores Zach Frazer and Demetrius Jones and incoming freshman Jimmy Clausen ­with different styles and abili­ties. each competing to be the lead signal caller for the Irish. 
Weis said although he is will­ing to change depending on the 
On the offensive 
situation, he is generally against using a platoon system at quar­terback -making the competi­tion for the top job even more intense. 
"There's been more than two quarterbacks but usually the competition's only been between two people," Weis said. "This one's a little bit unique because to give them equal opportunity, you have a rotation system built in place where guys are lead guys at certain times, and we're halfway through that process." 
Weis said he will rotate each quarterback through the first, second, third and fourth strings each week throughout the spring. In this way, each quar­terback gets the same opportu­nities to run plays with the starting receivers and backs. Weis said this keeps. him objec­tive since no one has extra time with the starting ofTense. 
"But really when you just take out the subjectivity and just making it objective analysis, it usually cleans itself up," Weis said. "Even in those cases,

Panthers sweep ND at Pitt 
Inclement weather cuts series from 3games to 2 
By DEIRDRE KRASULA SportS Writer 
Notre Dame headed to Pittsburgh Friday in hopes of cor­recting some of the problems it faced last weekend, but it failed to do so. 
The Irish dropped both games in what was originally scheduled to be a three-game series ­Sunday's game was canceled due to inclement weather in Pittsburgh. 
Irish sophomore David Phelps dropped only his second game of the season with a 4-2 loss Friday night, and Paul Nardozzi pitched a two-hit shutout for the Panthers in their 5-0 win over the Irish Saturday.
