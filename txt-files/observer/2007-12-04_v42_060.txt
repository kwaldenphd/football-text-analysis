Unusual exam schedule planned 
Divided study days accommodate latest possible semester start; no complaints reported 
By KAITLYNN RIELY Assistant News Editor 
For upperclassmen at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's, the exam sdwdule at each semester's end has been a constant -reading days Thursday through Sunday, and exams Monday through Friday. 
This year. dun to the late start­ing day for classes in August, there will be three reading days for Notrn Dame, and two for Saint Mary's. Exams for both schools will start Dec. 14, with testing on Friday and Saturday, then Monday through Wednesday. 
"It's an odd finish," said Harold Pace, the University registrar. 
The reason for the departure from the usual exam timetable dates back to the scheduling arrangements made in 1993, when Notre Dame's Academic 
-
Council approved the Perpetual Academic Calendar, Pace said. 
The rules of the calendar stated that the first class day in the fall semester would be on the fourth Tuesday in August, meaning dates ranging from Aug. 22 to Aug. 28. 
Every few years, as in 2001, 2007 and 2012, the fourth Tuesday of the month falls on Aug. 28. The Academic Council realized, Pace said, that if adjust­ments were not made to the final exam schedule in those years, then the last day of exams would be Dec. 21 and grades would be due Dec. 24, the day before Christmas. 
"We decided ... that in those years, we would trim a study day off, and try to get started on exams early, so students could

Contraceptives available for n1edical needs 
NO Health Services prescribes birth control for health reasons, not pregnancy prevention 
ByJENN METZ Assistant News Editor 
Notre Dame students cannot receive birth control prescrip­tions or pills at llealth Services unless they demonstrate a med­ical -not contraceptive ­need for the medication. 
If a student comes in asking for birth control for the purpose of contraception. "we're not going to ask a lot of questions," said Ann Kleva, director of Univnrsity lleallh Services. 
"We'II say point blank. 'I'm sorry, wo don't supply those snrvices on campus because we abide by the teachings of the Church,"' she said. "We're not here to judge anybody. That's one avenue, one medical prac­tice that we just do not partici-· pate in." 
Health Services does not refer students to places off campus where birth control can be obtained. Kleva said it's very unlikely a student would not be able to find out the name of a location online, from friends or in a phonebook. 
"If they're definite that's what they want, I'm sure they'll find a provider on their own," she said. 
If a student has certain med­ical symptoms, however. birth control pills can be prescribed and provided at Health Services, Kleva said. Such sce­narios include patients with irregular or painful menstrual cycles, no menstrual cycle or abdominal pain. 
In these cases, physicians "can and will prescribe birth control after a complete exam and evaluation if there is justifi­able reason," she said. 
During such an exam, physi­cians will rule out other abnor­malities that could be causing abdominal pain, which could range from "a hot appendix to an ovarian pregnancy," she said. 
The hormones necessary to regulate cycles could be pack­aged in birth control, which Kleva said is "very effective" for that purpose. 
Whether the patient on birth control has or will have sex is a conversation that may happen between the doctor and a patient, Kleva said. Questions about sexual activity, like those about the patient's menstrual cycle, are "normal questions to ask a female" during an exam to rule out pregnancy, she said. 
Also, Health Services will fill prescriptions for birth control from home physicians if a patient brings in paperwork, she said, but the reason for the

Cafe n1ay stay open past 10p.In. 
By ASHLEY CHARNLEY News Writer 
The possibility of extending Student Center hours for the rest of the semester dominated discussion at the Board of Governance (BOG) meeting Monday night. 
Sarita Fritzler, chief of staff, reported to BOG members a conversation she had with Vice President for Student Affairs Karen Johnson about extending the hours of the Student Center, which is normally open until 1 0 p.m. 
Johnson said she is interested in extending the hours, Fritzler said. Johnson said she would be willing to keep the Student Center open until 2 a.m. during finals week. The Cyber Cafe may also remain open until 12 a.m., she said. 
Fritzler said Johnson pro­posed providing coffee from 12 
a.m. to 2 a.m. after the Cafe closes. 
If attendance is high during finals, the hours may be extended permanently, Fritzler said. 
BOG is encouraging students to use the Student Center to study. The Board is also open­ing the student government office for students during the late hours.

Man accused of stealing plane to impress 
LaPORTE, Ind. -A man accused of stealing a twin-engine plane and driving it down the taxi­way staged the stunt while he was drunk to impress his girlfriend, police said. 
Michael Santos, 38, was charged Friday with theft, criminal mischief and operating a vehicle after his driving privileges had previously been forfeited for life. 
Santos, who is being held in the LaPorte County Jail on $2,000 bond, is accused of driv­ing to the LaPorte Municipal Airport despite 
a lifetime ban on his driv­ing privileges. 
According to poliee reports, Santos was drunk when he took his girl­friend to the airport Sept. 9 to show her that he could fly a plane. They <:limbed into the plane and were beading down the taxiway when, Santos told police, flames began shooting from the left engine. 
He said he turned off all the switches and veered into a soybean field. 
Accused thief makes a costume change

This change will ensure four grouped study days followed by f'ivc exam days on Monday through Friday.

"We need a letter from the doctor's office faxed to us directly telling us why it was prescribed if in fact it was pre­scribed for non-contraceptive purposes,'' Kleva said. 
Prescriptions for birth control and othnr medications ean also be transferred f'rom the home pharmacist to the pharmacist at llealth Services, Kleva said. Only government-regulated medications, like nareoties, cannot cross state borders, she said. 
While Health Serviens does not direct students to sourecs to find birth control, patients will be dimeted to counseling serv­ices, Campus Ministry or Gender Helations Center if they have other questions, she said. 
"If they need help with a rela­tionship situation, [wei will show them where to get coun­seling,'' Kleva said. 
Notre Dame's practices in the prescription of birth control are similar to those at other Catholic institutions. 
Elaine Whetzel, administrator of the Health Center at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., said birth eontrol is provided if it is "med­ically necessary." 
"If the doetor orders the pre­scription, it is for medical con­ditions only,'' she said. 
Unlike at Notre Dame, the Health Center at Georgetown does not fill prescriptions from outside physicians. 
The Boston College Web site states its health services does not "provide materials for the purpose of preventing eonenp­tion" beeausc of "the moral val­ues that Boston College espous­es." The director and adminis­trators of Health Serviens at Boston College did not return Observer inquiries by the time of publication.

Country chooses to stay democratic 
Voters narrowly defeat Chavez's constitutional referendum to move toward a socialist state 
Associated Press 
CAHACAS--Humbled by his first electoral defeat ever, President Hugo Chavez said Monday he may havn been too ambitious in asking vot­ers to let him stand indefi­nitely for re-election and endorse a huge leap to a socialist statn. 
"[ understand and accept that the proposal! made was quite profound and intense." he said after votp,rs narrowly rejected the sweeping consti­tutional reforms by 51 per­cent to 49 percent. 
Opposition activists were ecstatic as the results were announced shortly after midnight --with 88 percent of the vote counted. the trend was dP.clared irre­versible by elections couneil chief Tibisay Lucena.

IN BRIEF 
U.S. manufacturing continues to grow 
NEW YORK -U.S. manufacturing expanded in November as new orders and production improved, but weakness in employment suggested that industrial jobs may not be as plentiful in coming months. 
The Institute for Supply Management, a Tempe, Ariz.-based trade group, said Monday that its manufacturing index regis­tered 50.8 last month, down from 50.9 in October. A reading above 50 indicates growth; below that spells contraction. 
The November results, which marked the 1Oth consecutive monthly expansion. were slightly stronger than the 50.1 expected by analysts polled by Thomson/IFR Markets. 
"While other segments of the economy are struggling, manufacturing continues to grow due to continuing strength in new orders, and a recovery in production from last month," Norbert Ore, chairman of the institute's business survey committee, said in a statement. "Prices, driven higher by energy prices, are once again the major concern." 
Ford plans to offer full lineup in 2020 
DEAHBOHN, Mich. -Ford Motor Co. plans to offer a full line of vehicles, including trucks and sport utility vehicles, in 2020 despite tougher federal fuel economy regulations likely to take effect that year, Chief Executive Alan Mulally said Monday. 
The auto industry's fleet of new cars, sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and vans will have to average 35 miles per gallon in combined city and highway driving by 2020, according to the agreement that congressional negotiators announcod late Friday. That compares with the 2008 requirement of 27.5 mpg average for cars and 22.5 mpg for light trucks. It would be the first increase ordered by Congress in three decades. 
The commitment may be difficult for Ford, which doesn't have a single vehicle in its 2008 model year lineup that meets the new standards.

especially impolite 
method of abortion. O'Donnell also drew 
ominous conclusions from the fact that the

I'd seen that comment b«~forn. Back whc~n I wa<> an undergrad. the Viewpoint mtitor printed it once as the section's quote of the day. I'm not surn whom it was attrib­utnd to. I a<;sumed the point was valid, that the conflict in America over abortion is largdy a conflict betwenn men and women. Yes, I've always known women who wern dead-snt against it, and men who are very gratnful for it<; easy availability, but in many ways, subtle or not-so-subtle, our sodety reinforces the idea that the light against abortion is a matter of men telling women what to do. !laving bmm votHd "most gullible" in high school, I was always one to accept conventional wisdom. Besides. the women I'd known who'd most eagnrly expressed their opinion on the issue had been heavily on the pro-abortion side. 
So I was surprised by a Wa<>hington Times article back in July 2003 tillHd "Pro­[jfe Women Shift to Majority," by Grant Schulte. According to a survey conducted at the request of a pro-abortion advocacy group, 17 percent of American women think abortion should be illegal altogether. 34 percent more think it should be out­lawed except in cases of rape, incest or 
EDITORIAL CARTOON 
mortal danger to the mother; these ca<;es account for about one percent of abortions performed in America. So a slim majority of American women would ban 99 percent of abortions. Strangely, tl1e New York Times, which claims to print "all the nnws that's fit to print," didn't report on the story. Then again, such a story must be deeply embarrassing to an outfit that consistently editorializes in favor of unlimited abortion accHss under the euphemism "women's right<>." New York Times Magazine did indi­rnctly cover the story, however, printing an extended diatribe by a feminist angernd by the survey results, telling her li.11low women to get their thumbs out of their mouths (her metaphor, not mine). 
A dilli:mmt survey conducted around the same time showed that men lean the other way, but by a larger margin, which makes the population as a whole slightly pro­choice. And according to tl10 keynote speaker at the statn Hally for Life two years ago. there's a similar dynamic here in Maryland -the public leans pro-choice, but the women lean pro-life. So it's true: ThP.re is a gnnder gap on abortion. But it's not very big, and it's oppositn to the one Hosie and the rest would have us believe. 
My first rnaetion to these result<> was that once again, women arn demonstrably morally superior to men. which is what I already believed anyway. Just look at a list of serious sins-anger, lust. greed, dishon­esty. drunkenness. Isn't it like decoding the Y-ehromosome? But the data in this CIL<;e dearly don't support such a broad general­ization of female superiority. It's not like women are overwhelmingly against abor­tion and men overwhelmingly for. Actually, I'm disappointed the gap's not bigger, see­ing how men have less problem with killing in general (animals, criminals, enemy eom­batants), are less fond of babies, and are more interested in promiscuity -and make no mistake, the right to abortion is ultimately about the ability to be promiscu­ous. Moreover, women know, in a way men never can, that "uterine content<>" (a 
favorite New York Times term filf "baby" I 
is a who, not a what. And if' you removH 
from the comparison those men who 
deeply oppose abortion and would ban it 
but who have bem1 so morally gelded that

the right to tHII women not to destroy their

but gutless, who let their wives keep their 
maiden names, and who say "We're preg­

What then are we to eonelude? Maybe just what Solzhenit<>yn wrote. The line sep­arating good from evil doesn't dividn one dass from another, one raw from another. Christians from non-Christians, or women from men. The linn between good and evil goes right down the middle of' every human heart. Yes, I'd still rather have the next passerby bP a woman, if I wern dying along the side of a road, and I'd rather be at the mercy of' someone raised in a Christian home than in San Frandsm. but goodness isn't a !'unction of genes or upbringing.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Custodial staff deserves fair treatlllent 
When I was first hired at Notre Dame, I was ecstat­
ic. I felt that I had secured employment with a future. But four years later, l find myself disillusioned and disappointed. There are several issues I think the Univnrsity needs to address: The compensation pack­age for the custodial staff is shamefully lacking, we are over-worked and the University shows us little respect. 
The first area of concern is the salary and benefit package. People are usually impressed when I tell them I work at Notre Dame as it carries a certain prestige -along with the assumption that the salary would be adequate. Nothing could be further from the truth. After four years of employment, I have received a total salary increase of $.50 per hour. My wages are far less than the established federal pover­ty level for my family of five. As if this weren't diffi­cult enough, there is a hefty deductible from every paycheck for health insurance. Heaven help us if we become ill because there isn't enough money left to pay the co-pay for a doctor's visit. 
I am certainly willing to work hard for my salary, but the custodial staff at Notre Dame is fully over­worked. There is often more work than can be done in an eight-hour shift. There exists an inequality in job assignments, and if one employee calls in sick, it is up to the rest of us to take up the slack. Also, sev­eral employees have sustained job-related injuries and experienced other health issues as a result of their employment at Notre Dame, and they are often forced to return to work before they have fully recov­ered. 
Everybody needs to feel valued and appreciated, but the custodial staff at Notre Dame seems to receive little respect and recognition. The phrase, "The staff is the backbone of this university," has been tossed around for years, but I don't see that respect. For example, when the Jordan Hall of Science was dedicated, the custodial staff was told we needed to leave the building during these festivi­ties-after months of extra work assignments dur­ing the construction phase to get the building ready. There was no recognitio·n or respect shown for our extra hours of hard work. 
The custodial staff makes a contribution to this uni­versity that cannot be paralleled. This great institu­tion has a debt to us that needs to be paid. All we are asking for is a fair salary, a fair workload, and a little respect and appreciation. Is that asking too much?

Alcohol orthodoxy goes unchallenged 
When is an adult not an adult? When it comes to alcohol, the answer is: "whenever those in charge feel like it." 
New laws passed by the state legislature went into effect earlier this month, now creating a new "crime" for under­age consumption of alcohol. Not content with simply mak­ing criminals out of anyone under 21 in Steve possession of alcohol, the legislature has Skutnik decided that the scourge of 18, 19 and 20-year-olds drinking now warrant North Carolina police to seek out and arrest anyone State underage with even a drop of alcohol on University their breath. The Technician 
Almost never is the question raised why underage adults consuming alcohol is such an epi­demic to be stamped out with prejudice-the idea is sim­ply taken as unchallenged orthodoxy. Why shouldn't underagfl adult<; be drinking? "Because it's the law." No further reasoning required. 
Despite the university theoretically being a place of free inquiry, almost never does one hear members of the administration questioning the wisdom of diverting scarce police resources to the end of harassing underage students 
getting a beer buzz. Even our own student leaders regular­
ly crow about the need to prevent the bane of underage 
drinking through education and enforcement-as ifthe 
notion of challenging the current age regime (and in par­
ticular, the law enforcement priorities that go with it) was 
completely off the table. 
Thus, one has to ask -are lawmakers, administrators 

and student leaders simply too petty or cowardly to actual­
ly question the wisdom of treating adults as children when 
it comes to alcohol, or do they actually buy into the com­
pletely asinine notion that a double-standard of adulthood 
somehow manages to single-handedly stave off a plague of 
social ills? 
Even ifone were to generously assume that prohibiting 

underage drinking was completely successful in its 
enforcement (an unlikely notion, given both the status quo 
and the history of prohibition), what harm do proponents 
propose they are preventing? If it's the consequence of · irresponsible drinking, why doesn't the current poli9y not 
simply time-shift this behavior a mere few years into the 
future? 
Of course, these same people will regularly trot out the 

condescending argument that adults under 21 are simply not responsible enough to handle alcohol-despite being responsible enough in the eyes of the law to handle the vote (a far more dangerous good in the wrong hands), own firearms, and be tried as an adult for their crimes. The irony is appalling. 
Meanwhile, underage adults can take comfort in the fact that while they are legally denied the refreshing taste of a cold one for the next few years, they can still enjoy the thrill of being sent out to fight and die in whatever third­world hellhole Uncle Sam decides to invade next. All for the sake of a country that would infantile them back home. 
Because until they begin to exercise one of the few rigl)ts they have as a legal adult-the right to vote for those who would change the current laws -this will be one of the few thrills the law will still allow.

Grad school a choice, not a necessity

one solitary thought George prevails: "There has got Washington to be a better way!" University 
I looked at some of The G. W. my friends this week-Hatchet end who were killing themselves to learn and absorb every last piece of information possible, and then I looked at some of my friends who were at the movies and then out to dinner and then at parties. Ultimately we know that people who don't study for finals historically don't do well on them. These people probably won't get into great graduate schools straight out of college either. 
But what is so bad about that? 
All my life I have been conditioned to think that after high school comes college and after that comes some sort of graduate school, just the same as one moves from second to third grade without any questions asked. But now as ~ really am forced to examine my life and what I want to do with it, I have to ask myself: Why graduate school? 
There is an interesting social shift at play here. Twenty years ago the end all be all of education was simply a college degree. It was not uncommon for many to go to voca­tional schools right out of high school, never making it to college at all. Today many peo­ple think of a bachelor's degree as no better than a high school diploma and consider graduate school not a possibility, but a given. However, I contend that much can be done with a four-year undergraduate degree. 
There are plenty of professions that make money with no graduate schooling whatso­ever. IfI wanted to be a journalist, work on a political campaign, start my own company or any number of respectable professions I could begin within the next few years. 
Undoubtedly sometime in high school we were all shown that pie chart depicting the average salary of those with high school diplomas, those with bachelor's degrees and those with master's degrees. Those with a bachelor's, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, are supposed to make about $20,000 more per year than high school grads. Those with a master's are supposed to make another $10,-000 per year on top of that (averaging $62,000 per year). 
But let's be real here. One's motivation towards life, family background and work ethic have significantly more to do with your salary then does the number of years of college you completed. Sure, it is essen­tially impossible to be a doctor or a lawyer without going to medical or law school. But let's face it: We're not all cut out to be doc­tors or lawyers (no matter how many times our relatives tell us we are). 
While grad school does open the door to careers not available to those without those coveted master's degrees, think of all the opportunities wasted. Most obviously, the fact that you are in college another two to four years is time you are not making money. In fact, during that time you are most likely racking up some substantial debt currently coming close to averaging $100,000, according to U.S. News and World Report. And even if grad school is something you want to do, often times the job you can get out of college will pay for you to go back to school, since you will become a greater asset to their company. 
Maybe I'm just bitter because finals are upon us and tl1e stress of that coupled with the imminent holiday season is getting to me. Am I going to go to grad school? I don't even know yet. All I'm saying is that maybe it's not the logical next step after we gradu­ate from here. Maybe we should think about exploring the possibilities presented to us immediately following George Washington. Bill Gates didn't even go to col­lege, and look at him. All right, bad exam­ple. But you get my point.

NASHVILLE, Tenn.­Andy Pettitte decided to pitch for the New York Yankees in 2008 and put off retirement. 
Pettitte's agent, Randy Hendricks, said Monday that the 35-year-old left-bander had started telling team­mates on Sunday. Hendricks then informed Yankees gen­eral manager Brian Cashman of the news. 
Hendricks said Yankees captain Derek Jeter and catcher Jorge Posada had lobbied Pettitte to return, and the pitcher consulted his wife. 
"Players such as Jeter and Posada told him how much they needed him back, as did Brian Cashman and Joe Girardi," Hendricks said. "Andy decided this weekend that he didn't want to keep the Yankees on hold as they sought to determine their team for next year." 

The decision came as the Yankees set a Monday dead­line for the Minnesota Twins to decide whether they will trade them two-time AL Cy Young Award winner Johan Santana for pitcher Phil Hughes, center fielder Melky Cabrera and a midlevel prospect. 
Pettitte had declined a $16 million option last month, saying he needed more time, and Posada said last week that Pettitte was lean­ing toward retirement. The pitcher had said late in the 
IN BRIEF 
UCLA fires head football 
coach Dorrell 
LOS ANGELES -UCLA coach Karl Dorrell was fired Monday, a day after the Bruins accepted a bowl bid and two days after a loss to cross-town rival Southern California. 
Dorrell was let go despite leading the Bruins to a postseason game in each of his five seasons at UCLA, which had an outside chance to reach the Hose Bowl before its 24-7 defeat by USC over the weekend. 
The 43-year-old Dorrell, a former UCLA player who previously had not held a head coaching job, had a 35-27 record. 
The Bruins (6-61 will play BYU (1 0-2) in the Las Vegas Bowl on Dec. 22. UCLA athletic director Dan Guerrero said Dorrell will decide whether he wants to coach that game and, if not, defensive coordi­nator DoWayne Walker will serve as interim coach. 
season that it had become increasingly difficult to be away from his family during the season. 
Pettitte was 15-9 with a 
4.05 ERA this year in his return to the Yankees fol­lowing three seasons with his hometown Houston Astros. He went 11-3 after the All-Star break and was New York's most effective starter during the first­round playoff loss to Cleveland, pitching 6 1-3 scoreless innings in Game 2. 
New York had said it could wait until next month for Pettitte to make a deci­sion. Cashman said the $16 million option Pettitte declined was a standing oifer. 
All of the Yankees' major 
page 13 
free agents have now decid­ed to return, with Pettitte following Posada, third baseman Alex Rodriguez and closer Mariano Rivera. The only major change thus far as been replacing man­ager Joe Torre with Girardi. 
New York's projected rota­tion now includes Pettitte, Chien-Ming Wang, Mike Mussina, Hughes and Joba Chamberlain, with Ian Kennedy in reserve. But Yankees senior vice presi­dent Hank Steinbrenner said Sunday his preference was to make the deal for Santana, which would give New York a stronger ace as it competes to regain the AL East title from the World Series champion Boston Red Sox. 

Demsey back on PGA tour 
after 1 0-year absence 
WINTER GARDEN, Fla.-After a 1 0-year absence and two surgeries to remove a brain tumor the size of a golf ball, Todd Demsey finally made it back to the PGA Tour on Monday with perhaps the most significant round of his career. 
Demsey, a former NCAA champion and amateur teammate of Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson, closed with an 8-under 64 in the sixth and final round of Q-school to earn one of 26 full-exempt cards next year in the big leagues. 
Frank Lickliter II, who opened with consecutive 62s. completed a wire-to­wire week at Orange County National and ilnished as the medalist at 29­under 403. He won by four shots over Brett Humford of Australia. 
But the day belonged to Dcmsey. 35, who played bogey-free on the Crooked Cat course and was carried along by an amazing calm. 
Oilers top struggling Ducks 
to complete sweep 
ANAHEIM, Calif. -Dustin Penner showed the struggling Anaheim Ducks what the defend­ing Stanley Cup ehampions are missing. 
Penner, allowed to go to Edmonton in the offseason, scored against his former team in the first period as the Oilers beat the Ducks 4-0 Sunday to complete a sweep of the teams' home-and-home series. 
It was Penner's second appear­ance in Anaheim after signing a five-vear, $21.5 million offer sheet with. the Oilers in August which tho Ducks refused to match. The second-year forward had 29 goals for the Ducks last season, second only to Teemu Solanne. 
Without Penner and Selanne, who is not playing while he con­templates retirement, the Dur.ks continue to search for consistent scoring.

It was as grim as it could gnt. 
"I don't think anybody in that room was particularly happy with how they por­traynd themsnlves," Childress said. "It wasn't just the ol'f'nnsn. It wasn't just thn dnf'ensn or special teams. It was all of us. 1\nd when I say 'us,' I am talking about play­ers and coaches,." 
Three weeks later, Peterson is back on the field and the Vikings are steamrolling opponents in a way that has­n't bonn seen since Childrnss took ovnr as coach before last snason. 
The Vikings have outscored thn Haiders, Giants and Lions by a combined 112-49 in thrnn straight wins that have put them right bad in the thiek of the jumblnd NFC playoff ra1~e.

"I just think we're focusing a lot more," said Chester Taylor, one half of the tHam's dynamic backfield duo. "We're playing four quarters and just not stepping on our own feet and making mis­takes that wn used to make in thn bnginning of the season. Wn'rn just coming along as a tnarn right now." 
With Peterson and Taylor, the Vikings have become a high-powHred offense by pounding the ball on the ground, a rare strategy in this day and age of spread offenses and empty back­fields. 
They an~ averaging nearly 36 yards per game more on the ground than the second­ranked .Jacksonville .Jaguars and have rushed for 105 f'irst downs this sHason. 
Now 2S games into the Childress tenure, the ofTen­

On defense, the team's embattled secondary finally appHars to be eoming togeth­er as wnll. The Vikings have always been a top-flight defense against the run, but opposing quarterbacks have had little difficulty moving thH ball down the field through the air against the league's lowest-rated pass defensn. 
That has changed in the last two weeks. The Vikings intercepted Eli Manning four times -returning three for touchdowns -in a 41-17 vie­tory in the Meadowlands, then allowed just one touch­down to the high-flying Lions in a 42-10 win on Sunday at the Metrodome. 
"I think they are playing off each other very will, and I think we're doing some dif­ferent things in terms of dis­guising," Childress said. "I think thn guys on the back end are doing a great job of holding looks until the last moment, the linebackers the same way. 
In broader terms, it's a completely different atmos­phenl in the locker room now compared to the Monday after the Green Bay debaele. 
"We're more of a confident team than we were three weeks ago, but we also know where our focus needs to be," IinHbacker Chad Greenway said. 
With games remaining at San Franeisco (3-9), home against Chicago (5-7) and Washington (5-7) and at Denver (5-7). that newfound conl'idnnce appears to be jus­tilled. 
"I would say that nothing wins like winning,'' Childress said. "You build on it, whnthHr it is offense, defnnse or special teams and they all play off each other.... It's amazing how much that adds a little hop in your step."

Bush struggles in second season 
Associated Press 
METAIRIE, La. -There was a fumble that Heggie Bush was fortunate to recov­er. 
Thern were two short pass­es that slipped through his hands. 
Then there was the inaccu­rate, no-look toss on a botched trick play that may go down as the moment New Orleans truly blew its chance to get back into playof'f' con­tPntion. 
Y1~t. more than any of those, tiH~ imagns that seemed to symbolize Bush's difficult second season occurred off the field at the end of the Saints' 27-23 loss to Tampa Bay. 
Bush was walking toward tlw tunnel leading to the Louisiana SupHrdome locker room while what was initially called a fumble by Saints kick returner Lanen Moore was in the process of being overturned. Thern were 14 seconds left. and !wad coach Sean Payton had to run Bush down and angrily ordHr him baek to the bench. 

After the game, Bush sat in front of his locker for morn than a half hour, still in uni­2006 regular season -no form, with his hands on his one snickered when Bush head as he stared at the confidHntly predicted during floor.

entered the NFL with a lot of hype, only to find that much of what worked in col­lege only got in them in trou­ble against stronger, faster, more disciplined NFL defend­ers. 
Bush seemed to be figuring that out, even overcoming it, during the latter half of his rookie season, which was defined primarily by three spectacular plays: A game­winning, 55-yard punt return for a touchdown against Tampa Bay; a screen pass that he turned into a weav­ing, 61-yard score at Dallas; and his 88-yard touchdown catch in the NFC eham pi­onship game at Chicago, a play he finished by high-step­ping and then somersaulting into the end zone. 
With those highlights in mind -not to mention his 1,307 yards running and receiving combined and his nine touchdowns during the Houston 1­

yard line in a loss to the Texans and the botched toss to Hnnderson on Sunday while the Saints were trying to protect a 23-20 lead in the final 3 minutes. 
Bush, who had trouble with the handoff. already was running past Henderson by the time he got a handle on it. He had to make a split­second decision: Keep the ball and eat a likely loss of yardage, or make the risky toss. 
Bush chose the latter. Henderson reached back behind him with one hand but could not pull it in. Tampa Bay ended up recov­ering on the Saints 37 to set up the go-ahead touchdown. 
Payton sought to del'lect criticism from Bush. The coaeh said initially and again on Monday that he put Bush in a risky situation. 
"There's a lot of risk in a play like that and your worst fear is realized when you don't handle the exchange or block it just how you want," Payton said. "It's my fault for putting us in that position in that point in the game." 
Speaking generally, howev­er, Payton did say Bush needs to improve in the areas of ball security and pass block­ing. 
There have been other off­field distraetions. Tho NC!\1\ and Pac-1 0 are still investi­gating whether Bush or his family received improper benefits from agents while he was still in college. Bush has said repeatedly he did noth­ing wrong and his lawyer has said the Bush's are simply being extorted by criminals. 
Bush is also named in a civil lawsuit filed by a fledg­ing marketing agent who claims to gave givnn the Bush family monny. Bush could lose his lleisman if he's found to have violated NCA!\ rules. 
Still, Bush has never been accused of anything illegal and his NFL career in New Orleans would not bn afTeet­ed. Furthermore, Bush has insisted that the ease has not distracted him on the field. 
Brees said Bush benefited as a rookie from the pres­ence of veteran running back Deuce McAllister, who went out for the rest of this season after a knee injury in Week 3. 
"Heggie is still a young player in this leaguH, and like I said, I think a young back absolutely needs mentoring in this league from a guy like Deuce," Brees said. "It has been tough because (McAllister) has been hurt and isn't here like he was last year for him. So that's tough and I think it is just lnarning how to be a profns­sional. 
"There's definitely a learn­ing curve, and keHp in mind the tremendous expectations for Heggie Bush from the moment he stepped l'oot in this league," Brees contin­ued. "So I think that every­one expeets him to go out and just be Superman all the time and that is not the case, Hspneially in this league."

Three of the suspnets were transportnd from Lee County jail to Miami-Dade County jail Monday evening, said Janelle llall, a spokeswoman for Miami-Dade County jail. Charles Wardlow, 1X, Jason Mitchell. 19. and Venjah llunte. 20, were expected to appnar in court Tunsday morning, llall said. 
The fourth suspect, Erie Hivera. 17, would be processnd at a juvenile deten­tion center in Miami-Dade County, llall said.

Simpson expressed sympa­thy for the relatives of those arrested, as well as for Taylor. 
"It's horrible, not only for him, but for those other four families," Simpson said. "There arc four other lives that are gone." 
Videotaped tributes on large screens showed a sequence of bone-crunching hits and bro­ken-field runs by Taylor with the Hedskins, Hurricanes and Gulliver Preparatory in Miami. The final tribute closed with the words "We will miss you Sean" over a photo of him leaping across the goal line after an inter­

"Despite what happened yesterday, it doesn't matter now," defensive end Andre Carter said after the funeral. "We were happy to be here and be part of the service and to pay our respects." 
Gibbs' eulogy focused on faith. Be told the mourners Taylor became more spiritual as he matured after joining the team. 
"His life began to change," 

Gibbs said. "You saw thn way he loved Jackie and Jackie." 
Others also spoke of Taylor's transformation following the birth of his daughter. They addressed only indirectly his earlinr brushes with the law, which started with a 2001 fist fight and ineluded most recently a 2005 confrontation involving guns. 
There was pointed criticism for the way the media por­trayed Taylor's past in the wake of his violent death. 
"One of the things that l hope comes out of this tragedy is that the media get a small lesson in grace and humility," said Florida City mayor Otis Wallace, a friend of thn Taylor family. "For those who took the liberty or recklnssly spncu­laling that this young man's d(mth was eaused by the way hn lived, all l can say is they should be ashamed." 
The audience responded with a standing ovation. 
On the other sidn of the state, in Fort Myers, the four young men charged in Taylor's death sat in jail cells. Ed Griffith, a spokesman for the Miami-Dade County State Attorney's Office, said they could be in court as early as Tuesday morning. 
Hivera, Wardlow, Mitchell and Hunte face charges of unpremeditated murder, armed burglary and home invasion with a firearm or another deadly weapon.

'Alright, I guess I'll start hang­ing out with him."' 
The pair grew closer the next year when they shared a dorm room. 
"We had a pretty good time," Lapira said, "but I don't think Coach liked it too much." 
Irish coach Bobby Clark said the guys had a little too much fun living together and he had to pull in the reins a bit. 
"We were almost like evil twins. When we would get together we would just feed off each other," Yoshinaga said. "Since then we've toned it down a little bit." 
Clark agreed and said he has enjoyed watching both players progress as athletes and stu­dents during their four years. 
Lapira, Yoshinaga and the five other Irish seniors are now at the end of their careers with a chance to do something no Notre Dame team has done before -make it to the Final Four with a win over Wake Forest this weekend. 
The senior class has played a large part in getting Notre Dame to where it is now. 
"There is no question that the leadership has been one of the reasons that the team has done well," Clark said. "In a season there will always be hard times and setbacks and that's the time when you need strong leadership." 
Notre Dame (14-4-5) has not had many hard times or set­backs this year. However, it was a goal from Yoshinaga and a shutout from senior Chris Cahill that pulled the Irish out of a three-game winless streak in mid-October. 
Senior defender Ryan Miller said the success was due to a great work ethic in the off-sea­son. 
"If you were around in the spring, you would have seen how hard guys were working. I've never seen that in my four or five years here," Miller said. 
The group started working together the day after its quar­terfinal loss in last year's tour­nament to Virginia. 
"I think our team likes hang­ing around with one another. It's one of the nice things about this team," Clark said. "You don't need everybody on the team to be bosom buddies, but it is good that they get a good laugh together."

Irish nab second place in Invite 
Special to The Observer 
Notre Dame men's volleyball hosted seven teams from around the Midwest Saturday in the IrL'ih Invitational at Rolfs Athletic Center. The Irish reached the finals before falling to Indiana in a rematch of a game earlier in the day. 
The Hoosiers got their revenge in the championship match in three hard fought games, 25-21, 22-25,15-10. 
The very young Irish team, playing in its first tournament of the season, struggled to gain momentum going in the second and third games of its fifth match of the day, despite the outstanding play of senior Tim Goldsmith and sophomore Mike Nejedly. Notre Dame finished with a 4-1 record on the day. 
The Irish reached the fmals by defeating Ball State in two games in the semifinal, 25-20, 25-22. Senior outside hitter Dan Zibton and sophomore Alex Lewis led the offense, while sen­ior libero John Tibbie anchored the Irish defense. 
To reach the top bracket, the Irish knocked off the Hoosiers 25-20, 25-21 on what proved to be a showcase of young talent for Notre Dame. Freshman set­ter Mark landolo and right side hitter Jason Healy led the team to victory, including multiple assists from Healy while Iandolo was busy on defense. 

Notre Dame opened pool play against Grand Valley State-B in the first match of the day. While the Irish struggled at first, they hung on for the victory in three games, 25-20, 22-25, 15-12 with great defense from freshman Peter Balestracci and senior Frank Dax, who was playing in his last tournament with the team. Notre Dame also defeated Michigan State in two games, 25-17, 25-21, for the third victo­
. ry in pool play. The Irish fin­ished pool play in their home tournament 3-0 for the third straight time. 
Women's hockey 
The Irish traveled to Iowa this weekend to play the Quad City Blueliners for Notre Dame's sea­son-opening series. 
The weekend proved fairly successful overall. The Irish out­shot Quad Cities 26-15 on Saturday night, despite the unending line of penalties issued to both teams. 
The Blueliners' goalie kept them in the game as she saw lots of great shots from senior Kara Brennan, freshman Gillian Allsup and their linemates. Notre Dame lost the game 5-1 with its only goal coming in the third period scored by junior Amy Wilhelmy. Freshman Cassie Kral picked up the assist. 
On Sunday morning, the team's play was notably better. The Irish outshot the Blueliners 27-13 and got away with fewer penalties than the night before. 
In the first period, Notre Dame was down 1-0, but made an out­standing comeback throughout the second period. Junior Lauren Beuke scored an unas­sisted power play goal to open the period, which was followed shortly by an unassisted goal from sophomore Emily Chappell. Chappell assisted another goal scored by Beuke, putting the Irish ahead 3-1. 
The second period ended with another power play goal from Chappell. The Blueliners scored one last time, leaving the final score at 4-2 for the Irish. 
First year goalie Julia Gragtmans steadily improved over her first weekend of hock­ey. 
Dealing with a new coaching staff' and a new goaltender, first year coach Conor Brennan was proud of the team's performance and progress. 
"We definitely showed that it was our first game together on Saturday, but after the first peri­od it was all uphill for the rest of the weekend," he said. "By the looks of Sunday's game we should have a really strong sea­son." 
Defense 
continued from page 20 
said. "I think that's what got us going early, her in the mid­dle of the press creating havoc with Michigan. I think she's doing absolutely everything we could ask of in a point guard." 
Minutes later, guard Ashley Barlow came off the back line in the 2-3 zone to help with a double-team near the elbow. When the ball went into the corner, Barlow made it back in time to throw a hand in the shooter's face. 
"She's just so unafraid. She's fearless, she's relentless, she's determined, and she'll do any­thing, absolutely anything it Wolverines managed to inbound the ball past the press, and called out, "Fast break, fast break," as they ran down the floor. They ran the fast break, but center Melissa D'Amico stonewalled the charge and forced the drive underneath the basket by the baseline. By that time, Gaines had made her way back and forced Michigan into a set offense. 

The Irish use their quick­ness and athleticism on defense to set up their fast­break offense, guard Charel Allen said. "We like to rebound and run, and that's what we did on them," she said. 
With 13 minutes to play, Barlow intercepted a pass and fed it to guard Lindsay Schrader. Schrader penetrat­ed the lane before throwing a no-look pass behind her back to Gaines, who made an easy layup. 
Part of the reason why the Irish can play such a fast­paced athletic game is that they can sub often. 
"I think because of the depth we can sub more," McGraw said. "When someone looks tired, we can take them out and they can rest up a lit­tle bit before we put them back in. I think they play harder while they're in there. They play five or six minutes at a stretch because they know they can get out and rest." 
Notre Dame held Michigan to just 12 field goals and eight assists in the game anp forced 22 turnovers. McGraw, how­ever, said the defense can play better. 
"I think when we watch the film I think we'll see that we weren't as intense on the defensive end as we needed to be," she said. "I didn't think that our defense was as good as the score indicates."

takes for us to win," McGraw said of Barlow. 
One minute after that, guard Melissa Lechlitner got her 5­foot-7 body up high enough to steal a cross-court pass. 
McGraw said that Lechlitner, who had four assists and two steals, made a major difference in the game. 
"It was a seamless transition from Tulyah going out, getting all those steals and making us go defensively, and then Lech came in and did pretty much the same thing," McGraw said. "She ran the team, she got some steals, she gave us energy." 
Notre Dame did not let up in the second half. Soon after the half began, Notre Dame again presented Michigan with a tight full-court press. The

Wf'is. who stressed that he will not analyze the season as a whole until he finishes a round ol' recruiting duties on Dec. 17, said he will host rnorB than a dozen recruits this weeknnd. Weis and the recruits will attend tho men's baskntball game against Northnrn Illinois Saturday, at whieh Mikn Brey's squad will try l'or a sdwol-record 25th consecutive home vietory. 
"Wn'ro going to go break this record on Saturday night, so wn'rn going to bn a part of that." Weis said. "We'ro root­ing l'or Coach Brey and the haskPthall tnam."

Whnn askod about David Crimes' touehdown catch against Stanford that Big East ol'ficials ruiPd a completion on thn liPid but thn Pac-1 0 replay official ovnrturrwd, Wois was vagun and declinml to mention thn Pac-I 0 by nanw. 
"I think that we'vo had a vnry good ndationship with tlw Big East offirials this ynar s i nco WI~' VI' go rw to the Big l·:ast, and I think that they do a vory good job of' kn1~ping us informed on things that hap­pnn," Wnis said. "And we'll just kind of l1~ave it at that."

More on coaches 
If WPis iniliati'S any rhangPs to his coaching staff, it will not be until February -after rncruits sign their national letters of intent. 
But Wnis did say hn would change the team's current spneial teams coaching para­digm, undnr which all coaches eontribute to different parts of tho operation. Notre Dame's kicking game struggled might­ily, along with its kickoff rnturn blocking. Its punt cov­erage, however, was a bright spot. 
"It has to be changed," Weis said. "I was not pleased with the way it went." 
BnforB ineluding the entire starr in the special teams operations, Brian Polian was the team's special teams coach. Although Polian offi­eially became the inside line­
backers coach this year, he often direct­ed special teams assignments on the side­lines. 
Weis did not rule out maintaining a rnultiple­coaeh spe­cial teams setup, but said he could envi­sion a sce­nario with a single spe­

cial teams coach "if' it were tlw right person." 
Musings on next season 
Notre Dame begins the 2008 season a week later than the NCAA's oiTieial opening day and has only one, instead of the possible two, idle wonks. But Weis said he was not con­cerned with that. 
"I mean. it's just when you're starting," Weis said. "It's just like anything else, the schedule is the way it is. We still have a bye wBek dur­ing the yPar. Would you rather have two bye weeks during the year? I think having one byB week, and ... to have a bye wonk right at the mid­point of the year I think is almost an ideal situation or the proper time to heal some bumps and bruises and give you a midseason evaluation point." 
Notre Dame has a week off aftnr its sixth of 12 games next season -between road contests with North Carolina and Washington. 
Weis sticks to BCS opinions 
Weis once again argued that teams should not jump in the polls over teams who do not play on a given weekend. 
Asknd about Louisiana State's vault up the Bowl Championship Series stand­ings and into the national title game, Wnis said he thought Georgia should have gotten one of' the two spots in the ganw after No. I Missouri and No. 2 Wnst Virginia lost Saturday. 
"I ended up voting Ohio Stat~~ I No . I 1 and Georgi a I No.I 2 b1~cause that's where they wen~ on thn line," Weis said. "They were 3 and 4. Not that I'm a big fan of Ohio Stato or Goorgia or anyone niSI\ but if' you're next in line and you don't play. and the two tnams ahead of you losn, I think that you move up. I just don't know how you get pnnalizf'd for not playing."

East season begins after Christmas. 
"We ean make our name out here and let everyone know who we are," sophomore guard Tory Jackson said. 
The Irish have reeled off three wins in a row since los­ing back-to-hack games at the Paradise Jam in the Virgin Islands, but the Wildcats (5-2) represent a major step up in competition. 
"All these teams lwe'vB played! are good, but when you play Kansas State at the Garden, that's a different level," Notre Dame guard Kyle McAiarney said. "I think everyone's going to bring a higher energy to the game." 
The task of guarding Beasley will probably fall on Ayers or fellow Notre Dame small for­ward Zach Ilillesland. Both theoretically have the length and quickness to cover the 6­foot-1 0, 235-pounder. 
Whether they will actually be abln to stop him from scor­ing, however, is another mat­ter. Irish players said what is most important tonight is not whnther Beasley makes shots, but what happens after he misses them. 
"As long as we rebound and get efficient stops, we'll be good," Ayers said. 
Hebounding has been an Achilles heel for Notre Dame this season. The Irish were out-rebounded in both of their losses and only beat Eastern Michigan on the boards by two on Saturday. 
"When we rebound the ball well, we're great because we can got out in transition," MeAlarney said. "But some­times we forget to box out or don't do the little things." 
Tonight's game is a horne­coming for MeAlarney, who grew up in Staten Island. And since the junior missed last season's Big East tournament after being susp1mded, he said he can't wait to play in the Garden. 

"I'm nxcited to see somn familiar faces in tho crowd," he said. 
After a slow start to thn sea­son, McAlarney has rocketed up the Notre Dame seoring chart. In the last three games, he has averaged 23 points per game and is shooting 63 per­cent from behind the thrne point are. 
The Irish have scornd well on the inside as well. Forwards Luke llarangody and Hob Kurz are averaging a combined 31.2 points per game. 
But llarangody and Kurz will have to take on arguably the two best post players they've seen this year in Beasley and freshman Bill Walker. Walker (6-foot-6, 200 pounds) has added 10.8 points per game to Beasley's impressive statistics. 
On the perimeter, Kansas State is led by freshman Jacob Pullen, who is averaging 13.5 points per game and has hit 11 throe-pointers this year to lead the team. 
So far, the Wildcats' year has been similar to Notre Dame's. Kansas State opened the year with three straight wins against overmatched oppo­nents, tiHm suffered a disap­pointing loss to George Mason in the Old Spi1:e Classic in Lake Bwma Vista, Fla. The day after that loss, they struggled against Cnntral Florida before winning in ovnrtirni1. 
After an easy win over Hider, the Wildcats hosted Oregon in a non-conference showdown. The Ducks barely edged the Wildcats, X0-77. 
While Kansas Statn's athleti­cism presents a ehallengn Notre Damn has not seen yet this year, Jackson said the Irish are ready. 
"They've got great players, but we've got a groat team," he said. "That's going to be the difference."

Happy Birthday: This can be a charmed year if you pay homage to the people in your life who matter. Your outgoing, worldly personality will cause people to look up to you--as long as you don't exaggerate about your capabilities. Stick to what you know and finish what you start. Unnecessary change will lead to uncer­tainty. Your numbers are 3, 14, 26, 28, 33, 48 
ARIES (March 21-April 19): Look for new ways to stimulate your mind or ex­perience new things. You will be a target for an argument with loved ones so spend very little time at home . .Discovery and development should be your intent. 3 stars TAURUS (April 20-May 20): Be careful where you put your cash and don't donate, lend or pay for others today. A problem with someone's overindulgence or overspending will arise. Focus on making money, getting a better job or even selling something you own. 3 stars GEMINI (May 21-Jnne 20): Love, emotional issues, having fun and scoping out possibilities for the future should be on your agenda. A physical change will bring in some compliments and boost your confidence. Nurture a relationship that means a lot to you. 5 stars CANCER (June 21-Joly 22): Pick and choose what's important to you and follow through.

'D' carries team in Michigan victory 
Depth allows Irish to shut down Wolverines 
By BILL BRINK SportS Writer 
Mie.higan l1nad coaeh Kevin Borseth summarized Notre Damn's defensive prowess this season with onn snntnnee. 
"I just J'efd IikP a wounded fish in shark-infested watf'rs." Borsnth said arter Notrn Damn's def'nnsn shredded Michigan in its 77-4(, win ovnr the Wolverines Sunday. 
Borseth wrote ofT Mkhigan's of'fpnsivP stagnaney to laek of execution, but anyonn watch­ing could son a disparity betwenn his explanation and tho actual happnnings of the gamn. Tlw Irish prossed tlw Wolvorinns de11p in their zone, playnd tight defense on tho perinwtnr. and utiliznd doubln­teams of'foetivnly. 
Michigan had a size advan­tage over the Irish, most 
.notably in 6-foot-h center Krista Phillips. But what they laeked. and what Notre Dame has used to its advantage this season, were quickness and athleticism. Notre Dame got a hand or body in the way of numerous 
passes or shots in tlw ganw. Tlw Irish full-eourt prnss knpl Michigan in its zonn for nxtend­nd pPriods of t.imn, and when the Wolvf'rines did snt up its half-court offense, Notrn I>anw could doubln-tnam playnrs and still havn timn to gnt. hack in position aftnr a pass. 
The Irish altnrnatPd b!ltwemJ man-to-man and zorw dPfnnsP, something roach Muf'fnt MeGraw said lwlpnd k(wp tlw WolvPritH's guessing. 
"I think wn knpt tlwm ofT bal­ance a littln bit." McCraw said af'tnr tlw gamn. "Whnn WI' press wn likn to !'all back into the zonn. I like playing tlw zonn, I think wn'rn good at it. and I also likn the man-to-man. so I t hi n k i I' wn 1: a n ke11 p switching it on and ofT it will help kPop us a littlo bit mort' intensn." 
Onf' didn't havn to look hard to find oxamples. In the last five minutes of tho first half. guard Tulyah Gaines lunged to her left to knock a pass out of' bounds.
