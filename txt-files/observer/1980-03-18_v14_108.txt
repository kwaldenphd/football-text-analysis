N.D. honors O'Neill "With Laetare Medal 
Speaker of the House Tho­mas). (Tip) O'Neill Jr. has been named as the 1980 reci­pient of Notre Dame's Laetare Medal, the oldest honor ac­corded American Catholics. 
The 67-year-old Representa­tive from Massachusetts' Eighth Congressional District is one of several public servants honored with the medal in its 97 years of existence but the first to receive it while an active member of Congress. 
"Speaker O'Neill is a man whose lersonal integrity and practica wisdom have won the affection of his constituents and colleagues over more than four decades of public service," commented Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, University presi­dent. ''He has acted with un­common statesmanship, and, when the times called for it, with political courage as a mast~; of the legislative pro­cess. 
The grandson of an im­migrant bricklayer from County 

Thomas]. 0 'Netf Jr. 
Cork, Ireland, O'Neill was gra­duated from Boston College in 1936 and was elected on the Democratic ticket to the Mass­achusetts state legislature later that year. It was during his early years in state ~overnment that his lifelong tnteresr in quality education surfaced. In 1948, he became the youngest majority leader in the history of the state. 
When Congressman John F. Kennedy launched his senator­ial campaign in 1952, O'Neill ran successfully for his House seat. A protege of fellow Bostonian and Democratic House Whip ) ohn W. Mc­Cormack, the new congressman from Massachusetts received a quick introduction into the power structure of the House, includ­ing a second-term seat on the 
powerful Rules Committee. 
On the House floor, O'Neill has supported the liberal agenda of his party--housing redevelopment; mass transit; anti-poverty programs; the Civil Rights Acts of 1956, 1957, and 1964; Medicare; federal aid to education; consumer protec­tion and anti-pollution mea­sures. An original backer of President Johnson's military policy in Southeast Asia, he broke with the President in the late 1960s, supporting anti-war candidate Eugene v1cCarthy for president in 1968 and cocspon­soring legislation in 1971 sett­ing a date for American with­drawal from Vietnam, con­tingent upon release of Amer­ican prisoners of war. 
In 1972, he succeeded Hale Boggs, whose plane disappear­ed in a flight over Alaska, as majority leader of the House. He generally encouraged re­vision of the venerable seniority system and developed a reputa­tion for bridging the gap bet­ween the House old guard and change-oriented, younger con­gressmen. A careful cultivator of his Boston Irish and Italian constituency, O'Neill has never lost an election since entering the Massachusetts state le~isla­ture 44 years ago. "Poliucs," he once said, "is the art of effective compromise.''

NDprofs address Carter's budget 
sat d. 
by Roberta Bottei 
Calling inflation ''a symptom of economic distress" and asserting that "the entire Ameri­can family must try even harder to live within its means,'' President Carter last Friday announced his program of "urgent measures" and "econo­mic discipline'' to fight inflation. 
In response, three Notre Dame professors explained and evaluated certain key points in Mr. Carter's {>ian -balancing the federal budget, controllmg -consumer credit, and impos­ing a tax on gasoline. They also explained the recent Federal Reserve Board action of allowing the prime interest rate to rise to 18.5 percent. 
Kenneth ) ameson, associate /rofessor of economics, described the intende effects and the international framework which helped the Fed to decide to let the prime interest rate go up: "To lower the money supply, they are causing interest rates to rise, and therefore causing aggregate spending to fall... Yet the money supply has not appreciably declined overall, though it varies frommonthto month and because there are six to eight definitions of the money supply.'' 

College of Engineering receives grant

Senio:r Coj y Editor 
Theodore C. Lut~, President Carter's administrator of the Urban Mass Transit Admini­stration (UMT A), was on cam­pus yesterday to announce that the Notre Dame College of Engineering will receive a $5.) million research grant to study the effects of cold weather on mass transportation systems. Lutz was accompanied yester­day by House Majority Whip John Brad em as and Indiana Senator Birch Bayh who, ac­cording to Lutz, were instru­mental in seeing that the federal grant went to Notre Dame. 
Lutz, a former general mana­ger of the Washington, D.C. metro system, said that con­temporary mass transit systems have "a modern way of dealing with most problems, but an antiquated way of dealing with climate problems."

Carter said Friday he would balance the fiscal 1981 budget as part of an intensified strug­gle against inflation. An annual mflation rate of 18 percent was reported in January, the infla­tion rate exceeded 13 percent in 1979. 
Yesterday, the president met officials of the National League of Cities to defend his budget­cutting plan, saying "nothing short of stern measures" will stop the nation's headlong rush into w";<:f'ned inflation. 
"TJ-'-'~e is no sugar-coating this pill,'' Carter said of his budget plan, adding that muni­cipal officials can expect "less federal aid for cities." 
''There will be less even for defense programs, which are not directly related to combat readiness," he said. "It will mean our first real belt-tight­ening since World War II, when we fought against fascism." 
The president said the specif­ic budget reductions he wtll an­nounce later this month ''will affect everyone.'' 
Carter's original 1981 budget called for outlays of $616 bil­lion, with a projected deficit of $15.8 billion. 
The revised version calls for $13 billion in cuts, between $611 billion and $613 billion in spending, and a surplus of between $11 billion and $13 billion. 
The administration has ruled

saying a balanced budget ts

Sperm controversy comes to ahead,-officials worry 
ESCONDIDO, Calif (AP)-Following publicity about his sperm bank for Nobel Prize winners, Robert K. Graham says he has hired a guard for his 10-acre estate and underground sperm vault and refuses to talk with reporters. An outcry of criticism, and some plaudits, met Graham's statement Feb. 29 that three Nr-bel Prize winners had contributed sperm to the Hermann J. 1vfuller Repository for Germinal Choice. only 
one laureate, Dr. William Shockley, confirmed Graham's claim. The idea is to artificially inseminate intelligent women whose husband~ are infertile, said Graham, a 73-year-old businessman.

In illinois Primary 
Candidates exchange accusations 
CHICAGO (AP) -Rep. John B. Anderson accused Ronald Rea­~an of desperation tactics for mviting him out of the Republi­can party, while Sen. Edward 
M. Kennedy marched yester­day for what he conceded is 
close  to  a  lost  cause  in  his  
campaign  -the  Illinois  presi­ 
dential primary.  

On the eve of the contest all entries have called a watershed test of strength, Reagan, An­derson, and former U.N. Am­bassador George Bush roamed Chicago and the state in a final quest for votes. 
Kennedy was marching with Chicago Mayor } anc· Byrne in the St. Patrick's D~1y Parade. Kennedy and his wife· also went to Mass wit., the mayor, a key ally in his chalknge to Presi­dent Carter. 
But Kennedy virtually conced­ed that he will lose the popular vote in today's primary. In an election-eve television inter­view, he said he is most hopeful for a strong showing in the delegate-selection phase of the contest. The popular vote is advisory; delegate!' are elected separately. 
On a raw and rainy campaign day, Aoderson and Reagan did

The btg parade stepped off in controversy, sime the mayor at first refused to invite President Carter to march, then relented and asked him at Kennedy's urging.

The former California gover­nor denounced Carter's foreign and defense policies yesterday saying the administration al­ready has let the United States slip into second place in the world military strength. 
He told the Chicago Council on Forei~n Relations that Carter's promtse to keep the nation second to none is an empty one. ''How can he keep us where we are not?' Reagan asked. "We are already second to one, namely, the Soviet Union."

·SMC Board approves ~uition hike 
~y ToniAanstoos 
A 10.3 percent increase in student costs at Saint Mary's College has been approved by the Board of Regents. The tuition rose from $3,550 to $3,950, while the fee for board was increased from $930 to $980. The average room rate will be $122 higher· $1,040, as opposed to $918 this year. 
All of these changes will become effective this summer. The additional costs are neces­sary for the financial stability of the college, in accordance with the rising price of inflation, according to President John 
Duggan. 
A letter explaining the in­crease in fees sent from Dug­gan to the parents of SMC students stated the reason for the increase as follows: "To ensure a balanced budget and to allow for cost of livin~ increases for faculty, admini­stration, and staff.'' Other fac­tors influencing the increase is the climbing prices of heating, electricity, food, and telephone costs that the college must 
absorb. 
Duggan's letter continued, '' ...no aspect of the budget is more carefully weighed than the costs borne by parents: 
tuition, room and board, and fees.'' 
] ason Lin dower, controller at SMC explained the long and thorough process involved in building a budget. In August, the controller, Business Admi­nistration, and department heads meet with four econo­mists, and they attempt to predict the economic outlook not only for the following year but also the next four years. They use labor cost, general wage price, food prices, and utiltties as an index to aid in their forecasts. 
The committee meets again in October to revise their earlier plans, encorporating the econo­mic events that have occurred durin~ the intermittant months. Keepmg· a watchful eye on the budgetary issues, the commit-
Roemer drops charges 
Recent charges of cheating on an economics exam seem to have disippated, as preliminary investigations have discovered no evidence of cheating in the incident. 
Dean of Students ] ames Roemer recently said in a state­ment, "There has been no evidence uncovered which shows a conspiracy to obtain the test from the copy center nor has there been any evi­dence that reveals that any Copy Center employee has im­properly obtained and provided to others advance copies of a test.'' 
Economics professor Thomas Swartz had initially suspected that several students in Econo­mic courses 124 and 224 had obtained copies of the exam prior to the test. 
Students in Dillon hall were under investigation, but they denied the charges in a meeting with Roemer last week. Since the charges could not be sub­stantiated, Swartz released the grades of the students in the dorm late last week. 
tee waits until February to draw up their final budget proposal. This proposal must be submit· ted to the Board of Regents at their February meeting and must then be approved by the Board before it can be institut­ed. 
At a time of spiraling inflation, many colleges and universities across the nation are forced to raise their rates. Yet Lindower pointed out, "We issued one of the lowest increases in the state of Indiana. In fact, we're wor­ried that it is not high enough.'' 
The unpredictable rate of in­flation makes college budget planning more difficult and less accurate than in past years. However, SMC reserves the right to raise its fees in mid year iffaced with an unforeseen financial hardship. Lindower was quick to add, however, that the college would definitely try to wait out the year before raising its prices twice if su'ch a situation occurred. 
Cutting costs in areas where­ver possible would be advocat­ed to attempt to prolong such an increase until the next year. The next year, accordingly, would be a "catch-up year" and would include higher fee mcreases. 
As inflation rose in the past, so 
has the tuition, room and board at SMC. For example, from the 1976-77 school year to the '77-78 year, tuition rose $150, board went up $20 and room fees increased $57. From the 1977·78 to the '78-79 school year, tuition increased $300 and the board went up $50. There was no increase m room fee, however a phone fee of $50 was instituted. 
Duggan also pointed out that this year's increase in fees is accompanied by a J?roportional raise in scholarship funds, work-study programs, and on­campus jobs. 
The college has a general pool of revenues which accrues from such areas as the renting of the campus during the summer, commission from the vending machines, unrestricted gifts,· student fees, income on en­downment funds, and invest­ments. 
The majority of the revenue is from student fees, unrestricted gifts, and short-term invest­ments. The increase in scholar­ship funding is absorbed by this ~eneral pool of revenues; thus, It cannot be claimed that in­comt from only student fees covers the increase in scholar­ships.

year which required the city to hire 300 workers to remove snow and ice from transit rails as an example of an "antiquat­ed'' solution to a climate prob­lem. 
According to Engineering Dean Robert C. Hogan, there are ways modern technology can be applied to climate prob­lems such as snow and ice removal from mass transit syst­ems. 
"What we will do first, is determine the basic principles of the problem; the relation ships between snow and steel, and sleet and concrete to name two. Then, we will determine the best way to ~et rid of the problem by utihzing modern technology." Hogan suggested lasers, microwaves, and ultra­sonics as elements to be ex­plored as possible solutions for the problem of snow removal. He said that research will likely begin later this semester. 
Bayn, chairman of the Senate Transportation Appropriations Committee, lauded Notre Dame for having "the nucleus of expertise" to enable the ~rant to be given to a university m his home state. 
''This research is important because the energy problem is one that won't be wished away. Part of the over-all solution is to ~et people out of their cars and mto mass transit systems,'' he said. Bayh also predicted that "significant results" will be forthcpming from the research. 
The grant is part of the federal Department of Trans­portation's appropriated funds for research for fiscal 1980. Brademas, who had just re­turned from eight days of b~dget-trimming in Washing­ton, said that he and Bayh were fortunate to ''get the grant over the line" before the budget cuts began. More than 20 ND professors from five engineering depart­ments will be involved in the research. According to Hogan, student participation in the research will be mostly limited to graduate students as is the common practice with en­gineering research grants.

Speakers discuss Islamic world in sympOsium at SMC 
by Margie Brasstl and Beth Huffman 
The history of the Islamic world and the problems it faces today was the topicd of a symposium given by 12 spea­kers at Saint Mary's College over the weekend. 
The Islamic world takes in all parts of the world where people live who hold the Islamic faith, explained Prof. Seyyed Hossein Nasr of Temple University, (formerly Tehran University). Prof. Frank Tachai af the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle, noted that one of the myths of the contemporary world is that all Moslems are Arabs and all Arabs are Mos­lems. 
"Furthermore, 80 percent of Moslems are non-Arabic peo­ple. For example, 10 percent of Egypt, an Arab country, is Chnstian," Tachau explained. ''There are three million Mos­lems in the U.S. today, with the 
-majority being converts," he said. According to Nasr, there were three main factors which shap­ed the Islamic world of today. First, after World War II, the West ceased to be a model for Islam. Second, the leaders of Islam adopted an extreme form of Marxism. Third, and most important, oil brought wealth lf:lld power to the Islamic na­nons. "Today, there is seemingly a revolt of Islam against the West," said Prof. Ernest Dawn of the University of Illinois, 
NDPlayers to meet tonight 
The Notre Dame Student Play­ers will hold an organizational meeting tonight in order to begin their preparations for their fall production. The play­ers will meet at 7 p.m. in the Flanner Hall Pit. 
One of the primary purposes of the meeting will be to choose members for a Student Players Steering Committee. The com­mittee's responsibilities will in­clude the scheduling and selec­tion of all plays, and the appointing of all play-produc­tion staff. Any questions con­cerning the meeung should. be directed to the Student Umon, #7757. 
''The reformers have sought to strengthen Islam against wes­tern influence. They are oppos­ed to western ideas of freedom, equality, security, power, and glory. Reformists have conf!.­dence in themselves and their culture. They will turn to the past for self-assurance and help in assuring the people that Islamic faith is the first and only religion,'' Dawn explained. 
In tune with Dawn's speech, most of the speakers stressed the importance of the Islamic relition, the Moslem world and the hojads, the Islamic tea­chers. Prof. Bert De Vries of Calvin College, explaining some of the basic ideas of the Islamic religion, said it was a monotheistic sect founded by the prophet Mohammed. 
Mohammed stressed theocra­cy according to De Vries, a politics based on the belief that God is in charge. The Cliyin¢ law, or shauria, of Islam, given to Mohammed by Allah, stres­sed that religious law is to be the principle behavior within the state. 
''The Kalif, or successor of the prophet is to be followed," De Vries said. The Moslems be­lieve the world is divided into two factions, the House of Islam, or the territory under which God has control, and the Jihad, or the House of War, where God does not rule," De Vries explained. 
''Another myth of the Islamic faith perceived by the ~e~t. is that the Moslems are pnmmve and uncivilized," said Tachau. "In fact Islam is the closest religion to Christianity and ] udaism. Islam was perceived by Christians as a reJection of Christianiry. Moslems merely . deny the divinity of Christ,'' he 
explained. 
Islam traditionally calls Chris­tianity and ] udaism imperfect and claims the two religions distort the word of God accord­ing to Tachau. 
Russ Braley, correspondent for the New York Daily News in Iran, presented a lecture on the "Scourging of the Shah." Bra­ley termed the takeover ~>: Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomerm as an unforeseen and unpredic­table coup. In defense of the Shah, Braley said Mohammed Reza Pahlavi had nearly brought Iran into the 20th century. ''The media turned on Republic, left behind at least 31 other hostages, inCluding U.S. Ambassador Diego Asencio and 12 other ambassadors or acting ambassadors. 
the  Shah,"  said  Braley,  des­ 
cri~ing  the  downfall  of  the  
regime.  

The figure of 31 hostages was reported yesterday by Colom­bian_ media quoting othcial sources. Earlier reports had said about two dozen persons were being held. 
The guerrillas, demanding freedom for jailed comrades, have vowed to kill themselves and their captives if their conditions are not met. 
Colombian President Julio Ce­sar Turbay Ayala made public a message received last Friday from Cuban Premier Fidel Cas­tro which proposed "a way out of the complex situation" by offering ''to receive the guerril­la commandos, hostages and political prisoners through a direct Bogota-Havana flight." 
In his response, which was also made public, President Turbay Ayala ignored the men­tion of the political prisoners but thanked Castro for the offer and said he would take it into account if it became necessary. 
Gomez, in his underwear, opened a second-floor window at about 12:40 a.m. and lowered himself down a knotted string of sheets, but it broke and he dropped to a patch of grass in front of the embassy, authori­ties and witnesses said. 
SMCpresents play on alcoholism 
A play about alcoholism will be presented at Saint Mary's College today. The perfor­mance will begin at 7:30p.m. in Carroll Auditorium, Madeleva Hall. 
The presentation is sponsored by the Alcohol Education Coun­cil of Saint Mary's College in cooperation with the Alcoholic Treatment Unit at Alexian Bro­thers Medical Center, Elk Grove Village, Ilinois. 
The Pavilion Players, a troupe of actors and actresses who donate their time and talent to Alexian Brothers, portray the characters in the play, Under the direction of Father Martin McCormick, associate director of the Medical Center's Depart­ment of Religion, the Pavilion Players have presented over 100 performances before more th~n 20,000 persons. 
terrorists. It was a moonlit night and he was completely exposed to their guns," an army officer who participated in the rescue said. 
The guerrillas previously had released a total of 24 captives, including two ambassadors, Maria Elena Chassoul of Costa Rica and Edr Selzer of Austria. 
The guerrillas, members of the April 19 Movement, or M-19, suspende(·: negotiations with Colombian officials last Thursday. Officials say the next step is up to the terrorists, who demand freedom for 215 M-19 members held on such charges as rebellion, bank robbery, raiding an army arsenal, kid­napping, and murder.

... Rules 
[continued from page 8) 
Kansas, that the only way to change the rule -Article 39 C of the association's by-laws -is to submit a request to the NCAA to either abolish that rule or relax the provision to allow such things as "Bookstore" basket­ball competition. 
''However that would have had to be in by November 1, 1979," Berst pointed out when asked if it was too late to deal with the problem before this year's tournament. 
''What we needed was a 
... written request from someone in the athletic department such as Father Joyce or Mr. Krause,'' Berst continued. "We would have then circulat­ed that request among the member institutions and then voted on the motion at our joint convention in January.'' 
Why then was this not done? 
"But it was," protests Latz who recalls his extensive deal­ings with the NCAA of a year ago. "We sent them a written request last year and they set up a special conference call with a few of the NCAA's directors to decide on the matter. 
"We were turned down." 
Berst, however, maintains that it might not have hurt to resubmit the request to the general body in January. 
"Personally I wouldn't think they'd accept the proposal be­cause of the 'loose' interpreta­tions some schools might read into it," he explained. "How­ever, a couple of Jears ago I never thought we' . have sum­mer leagues, but the board passed that one. So there's 
Classifieds 
really no predicting how they will rule.'' 
Berst made it clear that he has no personal interest m the decision. 
"I really don't care," he added. "My job is simply to read the rules back between conventions.'' 
And you can bet that not a school in this country will ~et away with allowing their eltgi­ble varsity basketball players to participate in a campus tour­nament-for-fun as long as the NCAA's' super slueths are on the job. Oh, they may drive to classes in Cadillacs (assuming of course that they have to bother going to class), live in luxury apartments and never have to wonder where their next.C-note is coming from, but damn it, .not one of them better play in a Bookstore Basketball Game... 
After all, rule:s are rules. 
[continued from page 8) 
''I feel bad about not ~oing as far as possible with th1s year's senior class," said Smith. ''They combined their athletic talents with academic excel­lence in a very unique way. For the most part, they all enjoyed their best individual seasons this year and that was very pleas111g to see. l'mgra.teful for having had the opportunity to coach them. .

us a lot. They, wuh the morato­rium and all the adversity, the players certainly got the chance to grow and mature. They're better people for the way they handled all the adversity. They're one of the best group of players I have ever coached.'' 
All ofSmith's players earned a degree in a second major this season -the course was called Life.
