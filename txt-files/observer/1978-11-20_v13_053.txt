SMC charges highest dorm fees 

by Jean Powley Saint Mary's Editor 
Saint Mary's College charges the highest room and board fees of any college or university in the state of Indiana, according to a survey done by the Fort Wayne Journal-Gazette last May. Notre Dame ranked 22nd, tied with Marian College. 
Tuition is another story, how­ever. In that category, the survey disclosed, Notre Dame ranked third behind Earlham College and De Pauw, with Saint Mary's coming up fifth behind Wabash College in Crawfordsville. 
All 35 of Indiana's college with dormitory facilities were included in the study. 
"We have the best-kept dorms of any college I've ever seen, so our room and board should be high," Dr. John M. Duggan, Saint Mary's president, explained. 
Jason Lindower, the college's 

-controller, listed both the costs of staffing 24-hour open dormitory lobbies and the relatively few nuns employed on the hall staff!i as further reasons for Saint Mary's higher fees. 
So far this year, financial state-· ments reveal, the college is losing money on housing. But, according to Lindower, it is making up a slight amount of that loss in board. 
Although Saint Mary's residence fees head the list in Indiana, they are only slightly higher than the median when compared to other private liberal arts colleges of comparable size, according to a study done by Saint Mary's Institu­tional Research -Department. The college ranked tenth out of 24 in room and board fees. Most of the schools which..charge higher fees are located in Massachusetts and New York. 

For tuition fees, Saint Mary's ranked 17th in the same study, well below the median. In total fees the college again fell below the median, ranking 17th. 
In a comparison of these same private liberal arts colleges, how­ever, Saint Mary's ranked 19th out of 23 in average faculty salary, both including and excluding fringe benefits. The faculty compensation survey was based on 1977-78 figures.

Bomb explodes killing four 

JERUSALEM [AP]··A bomb ex­ploded on an intercity bus packed with Israelis and tourists in the occupied West Bank, and hospitals reported four persons were killed and 37 wounded in the worst terrorist incident here in· five months. 
In Beirut, Yasser Arafat's Fatah guerrlilas claimed responsibility for the attack, saying in a communique that an "underground squad acting inside occupied Palestine planted a time heavy explosive charge in an enemy bus while en route from the Dead Sea area to Jerusalem.--" 
Hospital officials said three .of the dead were young Belgian and two Israilis, and that 12 of the injured were tourists from Canada, Sweden and Britain. No Americans were reported hurt. The identity of the fourth person killed was not immediately known. 
The bomb blast occurred only hours after the Israeli Cabinet, meeting 10 miles away in Jerusa­lem, began debate on Egypt'sFr. Tallarida, rector of Zahm Hall, celebrated Zahm's birthday demand for a timetable to establish

Bank and Gaza Strip. 
A major concern of the Israelis in 
the Washington, D.C., peace talks 
has been security and the pursuit of 
terrorists in the occupied territories 
in the occupied territories if they 
are given autonomy. The Cabinet 
debate was adjourned until tomor­
row without a decision. 
The bombing, and a separate 
blast in Tel Aviv's Jaffa district 
that wounded two Israelis, came on 
the first anniversary of Egyptian 
President Anwar Sadat's visit to 
Jerusalem, when he began a 
go-it-alone drive for peace with 
Israil that has been violently 
opposed by· Arafat' s Palestine Lib­
eration Organization. 
Police later announced that 
another bomb had been discovered 
and defused at a busy intersection 
in the center of Jerusalem. The 
Fatah guerrillas also claimed re­
sponsibility for planting that de­
vice. 

The driver of the bus, which was 
filled with holiday visitors enjoying a sunny day at resorts by the Dead Sea, said the bomb exploded just after he let the passengers off at an Israeli West Bank settlement, Mitzpeh Jericho. 
"The whole bus filled with smoke and screaming," he said. 
"I stopped the bus and opened the doors as well as I could. Luckily a truck came by filled with sol­diers," he told the Israeli army radio. The army truck ferried the casualties to hospitals.

Keenan to amaze with talent! mtsttaoe mabness ~.g 1· 
-I by Mary~ Wlssc S eporter

"People will be amazed at t e range of talent in the Third Annual Keenan Revue--there will be a blend of serious talent along ·with talent exhibited through good-
natured skits and take-offs," Keenan Revue director Terry Smith said last week. 
Preparations for the Revue has been going on since the beginning of ·the year, Smith said. "We expecially talked it up with the freshmen while we encouraged the other residents to come up with new ideas," he stated. 
The Keenan Revue, planned this year for Dec. 1-2, was the brain­storm of two Keenan R.A.s in 1976. 
According to Smith, the revue was to be a hall get-together where the residents could work together and display their talents in an all-Keenan cast variety-type show. 
"The Revue, originally planned as a one night performance, was such a success and the demand was so great after the first show that an encore performance was put on the next weekend. Last year, in two shows, we performed to over 2,100 people," Smith explained. 
This year's Revue will consist of 
approximately 16 acts. For the past 
two months, hall residents have 
come to Smith and the other two 
co-directors, Kevin Flynn and Jim 
Buzard, with ideas for different 
acts. 
The residents' ideas were 
approved, and often improved, 
with the help of the three directors. 
"Now that most of the acts are 
formed, we are concerned with bringing everything together and rehearsing for the next two weeks as a complete show," Smith said. 
Included in the Revue will be the 
return of t~e ~eenan stage b~nd 
under the d1rctwn of Bryan Carhn. 
Sha~n M~Ken~a, pa.st band 
co-d1rcto~ w1.ll assist Carhn. .

P~ghese, Renar.d Guer~nger, and Mike Kammerd1ener will also be . presented. Lawrence McCarthy, t~re~ year veteran. of t~e Revu~, will ju~gle along with Bill Stracc1a 
and Enc Bauwens. 
Take-offs on TY ga?J-e shows and 
on Notre ?arne hfe will be featur~d 
once agam. Most o~ t~e maten~l

Were t~.mg to ma~e our 
humor as or1gmal as possible--we 
don't want ~o ba~k on the homor of 
Saturday ~,1ght L1ve or the National 
Lampoon, Flynn noted. 
"During the past month, we've 
a~l sat d~wn and tossed ar?und 
different ideas--we look for jokes 
that the entire campus will get--we 
don't want any inside jokes that 
only Keenan residents will get,'' 
Flynn added. 
Pat McAward, stage manager, 
stated that the purpose of the 
Revue is1 to get all residents 
involved in some phase of the 
show. "It is necessary to coordin­
ate the show as an entirety," he 'said. 
He als<fn_oted th.at being behind

show as. being on the stage. 
"Many residents are involved in 
set designs, set construction; 
sound, lighting, and work with the 
stage crew," McAward explained. 

Public relations and publicity are being handled by Paul Callahan and Mark Ronsini "We are

gram. We usually raise ,around $lSO in ads to offset the cost of the Revue," Callahan said; 
According to Ronsini, admit­tance to the Revue may be done on a first-come first-serve basis. "Tentative plans suggest that at the door we will have about 800 tickets to distribute to the guests. Upon entering the seating area, guests will then show their tickets to the ushers and be seated," Ronsini said. 
Last week, the revue was put in jeopardy when it was announced that Washington Hall was under· going some electrical wiring changes, Smith stated. 
But Donald Dedrick director of the Physical Plant, st~ted that his staff is "installing a portable dimmer board for a functional lighting system." Therefore the wiring changes will not interfere with the Revue and will be com­pleted by Dec 1st he said

Saturday's Fiasco 
=============:::===:=:=:=:=:=:::======::=:=:======================:=======:========:================:::::::::::=:=:=:The 
Irish Eye 
ATLANTA, Ga.·iEarlier in the week I spoke to Dan Devine about the upcoming game with Georgia Tech and the revenge factor following last year's 69-14 embarrassment of the Yellowjackets. He explained that the game was so important to each team boasting seven-game winning streaks that revenge was something fans thought more about. He spoke of the time Ara Parsegian brought a team down there and was pelted with fish and full cans of coke. So Saturday's fiasco must have came as no surprise. 
On the plane trip to Atlanta assistand head·, coach I Merv Johnson explained how the student body was seated right behind the Notre Dame bench and how the coaches might have to wear helmets. He concluded that "seeing they were all students, how can you stop them from throwing things." 
The display put on by 20 to SO fans at Grant Field was a disgrace. It was an embarrassment to the Georgia Tech coaches. players, fans and student body. "The actions of about 30 people in no way reflected the kind of coaches, players and students at Georgia Tech," graciously reflected Devine afterwards. Nevertheless, these actions were extremely dangerous and the school involved must be held responsible. Dan Devine saved Georgia Tech officials a lot of embarrassment by finishing a game he had every right to walk away from. People write these actions off at pro games with minor criticism of the city in which it takes place, but when ~~ happens at a college football game it is time to stop and take a look at where the game is going at this level of competition. As Edward "Moose" Krause reckoned from the press box, "This is college football!" 
"'"'"'"' 
On the brighter side. Vagas Ferguson put on the kind of show that is worthy of Reisman praise. He is well on his way to breaking every Notre Dame record and will be right up there with Charles White next year when preseason Heisman favorites get tossed around in conversations. Ferguson contines to improve every game and has shown a lot more confidence in his wide open running since Jerome Heavens got injured. 
"'"'"'"' 
Joe Montana played the kind of game that keeps pro scouts interested. While he completed his last ten passes to tie Angelo Bertelli's 1932 record, his biggest play came on that 13·yard scramble when he stuck his head down and made the first down by inches deeping the touchdown drive alive. 
Montana has improved greatly this season and has mastered the little tricks that were missing earlier in the year. The pressure of being a quarterback at Notre Dame is a tough as any 21-year-old will face. While the Fighting Irish signal caller is always in the limelight, Montana goes about his business very quietly. Despite his lack of flashiness, he is the person that will have to carry this te·lm through two more tough ballgames. Add to that the pressure of pr -scouts getting a last look to decide his future and you have a situation where a clutch athlete is truly tested. ll"":tV h.-wrr•"l!. ~11t T'11 h~• "" Montana. 

could have driven a truck through. Instead the junior halfback blasted through and then cut back to his left for 68 yards to the Wrambling Wreck six yard line. 
An illegal procedure penalty sent ND back to the seven yard line where the drive stalled and Chuck M<tle was called in to hit a 23-yard field goal, giving the Irish a 3-0 lead with 2:11 lapsed. 
In what was to be a dual between two quick backs, Ferguson and Tech's Eddie Lee Ivery, Ferguson had a lead he was never too relinquish as the Irish star broke the Notre Dame single game rushing mark with 255 yards (Ferguson held the old mark with 219 yards earlier this season vs. Navy) putting him over the 1,000 yard mark for the season. His 1,160 yards already this year is a Notre Dame season record (previ­ous record held by AI Hunter with 1,063 yards in 1976). 
For Ivery it was to be a long day. The Reisman candidate entered the game with 1,300 yards and picked up 103 more on 26 grueling carries. "Those were the toughest 100 yards I have ever gained," commented the senior fullback after the game. 
Notre Dame dominated the play in a nearly errorless first half. The first Irish touchdown came at the 
7:08 mark in the second quarter. The 12-play, 92-yard drive was highlighted by a Joe Montana scramble for 13 yards on a third down play that made a first down by inches. 
A Montana to Pete Pallas pass was good for the final 26 yards making the score 10-0 with the momentum swinging heavily in favor of the visitors. 
Lass than three minutes later, the Irish showed that Georgia Tech fans and players were in for a long 
Climb to second 
day as Ferguson continued his heroics hurdling tacklers en route to a 20-yard TD run. 
"Vagas made some unbelievable runs hurdling over people," prais­ed Montana. "I had fun just handing him the ball and watching him run." 
Notre Dame's defensive line men were doing a respectable job shutting off Ivery who entered the game as the top all-purpose offen­sive player in the nati~n with a 175.9-yard per game average. Ivery was the Yellowjackets' entire offense as he ran on badoffs and pitchouts beside coming out of the backfield on long yardage downs. 

It was an Ivery pass, ironically, that got Tech on the board as he took a -pitchout from freshman quarterback Mike Kelley and pulled up and tossed a strike to Bucky Shamburger waiting unmo­lested in the endzone. 
lfWrambling Wreck Head Coach Pepper Rodgers had thoughts of a comeback, they were erased by the end ofthe third quarter as the Irish offensive line bullied their way downfield. A Montana sneak behind center Dave Huffman put the game out of reach at 24-7. 
"It was a hard fought game in the first half," related NO's quarterback. "We just wore them down with our size in that first 30 minutes, especially up front." 
Devine also credited the offen­sive line for much of his team's success. "The offensive line played very well and came off the ball real well. Montana and Ferguson also had excellent days but that ties in with the effort of the front line." 
Touchdowns by Kris Haines and Jim Stone brought the score to 38-15 after Kelley connected with Drew Hill who raced 64 yards for GT's second touchdown (Ivery then caught a two-point pass). 
When Notre Dame went for its final point, fish, ice and bottles rained down from Tech's student section on the Notre Dame bench. Devine promptly walked onto the field and was surrounded by his players delaying the game's end. 
"I went onto the field because I felt it was getting dangerous when bottles started being thrown. I told the players I wanted to finish the game and not to retaliate because it would be below Notre Dame's dignity to do that.'' 
When play resumed, Yellow­jacket quarterback Mike Kelley kept things flying through the air as he threw on eight straight plays, completing five, the last one a six yard strike to George Moore clos­ing the scoring at 38-21. 
Kelley finished the day with 295 yards passing on 19-40 attempts and one interception. 
"Kelley is an excellent passer,"· plauded Irish free safety Joe Restic. "We didn't expect him to be this good especially since he's 

only  a  freshman.  He  has  the  
potential to  be  a great  quarter­ 
back."  

Kelley and Ivery proved to be the lone bright spots on a Georgia Tech team that finishes the home season with a 7-3 record. 
"Ivery is a great runner," com­mented Devine after the game. "You have to spot Ivery to win. We tried to bump him outside and then stop the cutback and I think it worked pretty well. But he is tough; the more we hit him the more he got up smiling." 
Notre Dame's win, coupled with a tie between Auburn and Georgia, opened the door to a Cotton Bowl bid Notre Dame officials promptly accepted. The Irish will travel to Los Angeles Saturday to play USC before completing the season on New Year's Day against projected SWC winner Houston. 
Irish skate past MSU twice 
by Mark Perry Assistant Sports Editor 

Strong performances by fresh­men players helped lead the Notre Dame Hockey team to a pair of wins over the Michigan State Spartans in WCHA action over the weekend. 
Dave Laurion, Notre Dame's rookie goaltender, was outstanding in the nets on Friday night, as the Irish cruised to a 9-1 win over Michigan State. 
On Saturday night, three goals by Irish freshmen in the third period led , Notre Dame to a S-4 come from behind win. 
The series sweep, the first of the year for Notre Dame, moved the Irish into second place in the WCHA with II points. They trail only Denver, who has 12 points. The win put them ahead of third place Minnesota, who has 10. 
Friday: Meredith scores four Greg Me_redith scored his first of fo.ur goals 23 seconds after the opening face-off, with aid from Steve Schneider and Ted Weltzin, and after State tied the score, the Irish reeled off eight straight goals on their way to an easy win.

WCHA, stopped 42 shots by the Spartans while allowing the fewest goals by· a Notre Dame opponent this year. 
The Irish goaltender made one of many great saves four minutes into the firs• period, as Russ Welch came storming in on a break-away. The State winger tried a high shot to Laurion's right, but Laurion made a quick glove save. 
State tied the game at the 8:28 mark, as Darryl DiPace tapped in his own rebound on a two-on-one break. Mike Stolzner and Paul Klasinski got the assists. 
The Irish grabbed the lead again at 12:16. the score coming just as Bill Shutt of State was coming on the ice after serving a two-minute penalty. Meredith took a pass from Weltzin in front of the Spartan net. Dave Poulin was also credited with an assist. 
Freshman John Schmidt scored his first career goal two minutes later, as he took a pass from Tom Michalek at the blue line, skated down the left side and slid a low shot under Mazzoleni's pads. 
Meredith completed his hat trick, the third of his career, with only 22 seconds elapsed in the second period. Weltzin took a pass from Schneider to Mazzoleni's left, and
