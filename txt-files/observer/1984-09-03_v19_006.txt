Bush honored in ceremony 
Associated Press 
NORFOLK, Va. -Vice President George Bush, shot down during a naval bombing mission in the South Pacific exactly 40 years before, was honored yesterday at a Navy cere­mony that Democrats branded a po­lltical event. 
Bush was the guest of honor on a stage erected on a sun-baked pier at the Norfolk Naval Station for the an­niversary ceremony. 
The Navy insisted that the event, at which Navy Secretary John Leh­man called Bush a man of outstand­ing courage, was non-political.

More than 500 Domcrs took to the beach at St. Joseph's Lake this past Saturday to soak up the last few rays of the summer sun. The Beach Party, sponsored by the Student Ac­tivities Board, started with an early morning biathlon and included a windsurfing clinic, canoeing, in­ncrtube waterpolo, and demonstra­tions by the crew and sailing teams. 
Sally Derengoski, Coordinator of Recreational Services, was pleased with the turnout. She said, "There was no promise ofgood weather un­til the biathlon was over. When the coholism.

Bush called the ceremony "a very moving occasion," and paid tribute to the two crew mates who died on the bombing mission. 
Ann Lewis, political director of the Democratic National Commit­tee, said in an interview last week that Bush was indulging in "epaulet­flexing" by putting a spotlight on his war record. 
"We were kids then," the 60-year­old Bush recalled. "But we knew that we were fighting for something very Important." 
He said, "We learned in World War II that you cannot appease totalitarians with weakness. In fact, it was the very pacifism ofthe demo­cratic nations before the war that tempted the aggressors on."

Reagan, Mondale kickoff campaigns 
Associated Press 
Walter F. Mondale said yesterday that President Reagan's linking ofre­ligion with politics is "not the Amer­ican way," as challenger and incumbent poised for the traditional Labor Day kickoff oftheir campaigns for the White House. 
After attending church in Min­neapolis and delivering a paid radio address heavy on religion, Mondale flew tg_New York, where he will launch his underdog candidacy Monday in a coast-to-coast blitz with his running mate, Geraldine Ferraro. Reagan flew to California Sunday, prepared to launch his "last cam­paign" in the friendly territory ofhis home state. 
But Mondale didn't wait for the Labor Day opening to take the offen­sive against Reagan, who enjoys a 
double-digit  lead  over  his  Demo­ 
cratic  challenger  in  most  public  
opinion polls.  

Referring to the president's state­ment last month that "politics and morality are inseparable," Mondale said in his broadcast that "government must not be permitted to dictate the religious life of our people." 
Reagan defended his earlier state­ment Sunday. "I was speaking about people who would deny such things as chaplains in the military ... I'm not seeking to install a state religion in any way," he told reporters as he left the White House for the West Coast. 
Sen. Robert Dole, R-Kan., said, meantime, that the Republican Party may be identifying too closely with religious groups. Conservative groups such as the Moral Majority, led by the Rev. Jerry Falwell, stand solidly behind Reagan. 
"I think religious conventions are very good. But I think there is a fine line. I think we are near the edge," Dole said on ABC's "This Week With David Brinkley."

Reagan will address a campaign­opening rally Monday in Orange County; Calif., which proved its long-time loyalty to him in 1980 by giving the former California gover­nor the largest majority of votes of any county in the nation. 
As Reagan leaves the state today, Mondale and Ms. Ferraro will arrive for a rally in Long Beach, the final leg of their day-long journey across America. The Mondale campaign has indicated it has not given up on Cali­fornia, with its 47 electoral votes. 
Toxic cloud threatens 
Associated Press 
OMAHA, Neb. -Police went door­to-door evacuating hundreds of Omaha residents and closed a stretch of Interstate 80 last night after a cloud of eye-irritating nitric oxide was released in a chemical leak at a computerfirm, officials said. 
There were no immediate reports ofinjuries. 
The chemical cloud, which could be toxic in heavier concentrations, was reported about 8:30 p.m. by Control Data, said Omaha police and the Douglas County Sheriffs Office. 
By about 9 p.m., residents were being evacuated from 96th to 120 Streets and from L to Harrison

Streets, about a 2-square-mile area. Police said Interstate 80 in the area was also closed to traffic. 
Officers in squad cars used loud speakers to tell residents south and east of the evacuated area to stay inside and close their windows to prevent inhalation of toxic fumes. More than 10,000 people live in the affected area, an official said. 
The Red Cross set up an evacua­tion center at a church. Winds were blowing the cloud south and east ofthe computerfirm. 
About 4,500 gallons of nitric acid, which formed the gas, began leaking slowly after a gasket between the valves on a tank apparently gave way, said Capt. joe Welge ofthe Mil­lard Fire Department. 

Shuttle waste system clogged 
Associated Press 

CAPE CANAVERAL, FLA. -A buildup of ice, blocking lines that dump excess water overboard from the space shuttle Discovery, prompted Miss~n Control yester­day to order the five-man, one­woman crew not to use the ship's toilet. 
"We would like you to use the on­board Apollo bags," the astronauts were told. On the Apollo moon flights, astronauts used plastic bags for human waste and 48 of the bags were stored aboard Discovery for just such an emergency. 
Mission control said there was enough space in the rapidly filling waste water tank for one or two crewmen to use through the end of the mission and it was presumed that it would be made available to Judy Resnik. 
The ice buildup, on the port side of the new shuttle, at first blocked only the nozzle used to dump the excess water that is a by-product of the electricity created by the ship's fuel cells. 
Mission control decided to see if water still could be forced through, but that caused a second outlet-the toilet drain -to be blocked. 
Television, beamed down from the camera on the shuttle's robot arm, dramatically showed the almost-instaneous formation of the second ice blob and the doubling in size of the first. 
"The bottom line is that we got buildup now on both nozzles," said commander Henry W. Hartsfield. It appeared the first chunk extended 2 to 3 feet from the shuttle; the second was smaller. 
Outside the discomfort of having no toilet, the astronauts were not threatened in any way. The concern about the ice was that it might come off during the flaming re-entry into Earth's atmosphere on Wednesday and damage the ship's tiles. 
The easy, but time-consuming so­lution for the problem was to turn the ship toward the sun and that was done. But that threatened to delay the continuation of tests Monday on the 102-foot solar sail being tested for the first time on the flight. 
Mission control said the solar ar­ray will not work properly if it gets too cold. 
Miss Resnik raised the golden solar wing 10 stories high above shuttle Discovery's cargo bay yesterday-almost like a sail on a tall ship of old -in demanding tests of a method that may one day harness the sun's power for space stations. 
The shiny "solar sail" was stretched first to 73 feet, then to its

full 1 02-foot height to check its stability. 
It was raised like a giant movie screen from the cargo bay upon computer commands issued from Discovery's cockpit by Miss Resnik. 
"We extended successfully to 100 percent," she said. "When we did so, all the panels ... popped free, very nicely, one at a time." The 15-inch plastic panels-84 ofthem-had been stored, accordion-like, in a box less than 4 inches high until they were pulled out. 
Engineers reported that at its full height. the top of the solar array moved 19 inches -considerably less than had been predicted before the flight.

important, but in a democracy like the Ameri­can it should be ecumenical, not Christian or anything else. 

r 
It is true that secularism has taken over the West since the 18th-Century French 
philosophers, and has led to Nietzsche's 

~ 
"death ofGod" and to Martin Buber's "eclipse r ofGod." r It is Paul Johnson's theme, in his sometimes 
r overstated but always powerful world history of the 20th century, "Modern Times" (Harper), that the "death" of God created a
~ vacuum of beliefs and a relativist ethic, and that the will to power moved into it. Hence Lenin, Hitler, Stalin, with their barberous poli­tical religions. If American liberals had not been im­prisoned in their dogmatic secularism they would have found ways of moving into the vacuum themselves. But it was the evangeli­cals who did, with their Moral Majority and their fundamentalist TV preachers. Ronald Reagan inherited the evangelical bonanza in 1980, even against a twice-born Jimmy Carter. He could have done it again this time, without the explicit political theology of his prayer breakfast talk at Dallas. But he chose to give history a nudge by making God an honorary convention delegate. The liberal Christian theology has been 
strong among the Democrats, as a Social 
Gospel theology. All three candidates who 
made it to San Francisco were theological in 
background -Walter Mondale as the son of a 
stern preacher, Gary Hart as a Yale theological 
graduate, Jesse Jackson as a radical revivalist 
preacher. The Jackson night at the Demo­
cratic convention was awash with a stirring 
religious tide. And the "liberation theology" 
ofour time, both Catholic and Protestant, puts 
the clergy on the side of the left guerrilla 
fighters, themselves godless. 

Thus religion and politics have been locked 
in an impassioned embrace, despite Madison's 
"double wall ofseparation." Think ofLincoln's 
inaugural addresses, think ofWilliamJennings 
Bryan's "Cross of Gold" speech. But in a 
secular age no one has figured out a workable 
theology for a capitalist, pluralist America. 
Reinhold Niebuhr, with his anti-fanatic demo­
cratic face, and Will Herberg, with his "three­
religion culture," .came closest. But the 
problems of state-subsidized abortion and 
school prayer and tuition tax credits are still 
unresolved. 

It was strangely left to Geraldine Ferraro to 
blurt out that Reagan wasn't so hot as a 
churchgoer or a Christian, and it was left to 
Ferraro's sponsor Gov. Mario Cuomo, and to 
Reagan's closefriend, Sen. Paul Laxalt, to cross 
swords over Bishop O'Connor's intervention 
on abortion. If these were pump primings, 
Reagan's Dallas speech was a Niagara of 
response. 

But campaign sledgehammers are not the 
 way to find a resolution. In the end it will have to assert that God is alive and doesn't need the state to help him live, that the constitution is religion-blind as well as color-blind, that no religion can have priority over others in America, but that children can't grow up in a vacuum ofbelief. 
IfAmericans can't make these propositions square with each other they don't deserve to be called a civilization.

What Ronald Reagan really believes 
As November 4 draws near, Americans are once again faced with the decision of who should hold the highest office in the land. In deciding whether the incumbent President deserves four more years of tenure, one help· ful element for Americans to consider would be a review of what Ronald Reagan really believes. In examining the President's under· lying values, it is interesting to see that Reagan has been remarkably consistent throughout his entire span ofpublic service. 
On the domestic front, reagan has always espoused the belief that government is evil and that its role in society should be min-
Paul Komyatte 
guest column 
imized. The President has consistently spoken out against excessive governmental social programs. In campaigning for Governor of California, Reagan called the state's welfare recipients "a faceless mass waiting for hand­outs." Indeed, Reagan's old Hollywood as­sociates vividly remember this beliefofhis. In a 1968 book about Reagan, one Hollywood wag is quoted as saying, "Ronnie always envied Errol Flynn's role in Robin Hood, but he thought the script should be changed from having the hero take from the rich to give to the poor. He wanted to make it the other way around." 
It should thus have come as no surprise when the President carried out his plans after his 1980 victory. The Reagan tax cut ended up lavishing the vast majority of savings to the very top percentage of income earners, a statistic verified by David Stockman'sAtlantic interview in which he admitted the tax cut was merely a trojan horse for the rich. Reagan's social cuts complemented the tax plan by making across the board slashes in vir­tually every social program, from food stamps to Medicare to Veteran benefits. 
This trend will likely continue if Reagan is granted a second term. While hedging on whether he would raise taxes, Reagan aides have leaked reports that one possible tax plan would be a value added tax similar to an addi­tional sales tax. Reagan has always stated a per­sonal preference for sales taxes, measures which shift the burden from the wealthy to the poor in a regressive manner. 
Reagan's foreign policy beliefs have also dis­played remarkable consistency. During the 1960s Reagan was charging the liberal es­tablishment with supporting a policy of ap­peasement and a choice "only between fight and surrender." Just how far Reagan may be willing to go in fighting communism was revealed in a quote since denied by the Presi­dent in theJuly 10,1967 issue ofNewsweek. "I don't think anyone would cheerfully want to use atomic weapons....(But) If we ask Ameri­can boys to fight and die for their country then we should do all in our power to aid them to win a victory as quickly as possible. I'd like to see the end in 24 hours (in Viet Nam) if it could be done." 
Reagan consistently displayed his staunch anticommunist views after his 1980 victory. Charging the Soviets with being the root of nearly every evil in the modern world, Reagan launched an unprecedented peace time mili­tary build up and became the first President since World War II that did not meet with So­viet leaders. In fighting what Reagan calls the spread of communism in our backyard, the 
U.S. has undertaken a covert war against Nicaragua in an effort to destabilize the Mar­xist oriented Sandinista leadership. Reagan went so far as mining Nicaraguan harbors to frustrate shipping. Similar military tactics were not even performed at the onset ofViet Nam for fear they would be too provocative. 
If November sees a Reagan victory, hard­line foreign policy will certainly continue. The Reagan administration has already prepared contingency plans for a military in­vasion of Nicaragua by 1985 or 1986 if CIA efforts fail to achieve the stated U.S. goal. Reagan has expressed keen interest in "star wars" space technology, and given the cur­rent stagnation in arms talks with the Soviets, a major arms control agreement does not ap­pear likely in a second Reagan term, leaving the way wide open for the militarization of space. 
Thus, in preparting to vote on November 4, one should realize that a vote for Reagan is a vote for the policies he has consistently espoused for nearly 20 years. The domestic scene will surely be marked by less emphasis on social programs and possibly a regressive tax measure such as the value added tax which would continue to shift the tax burden from the rich to the poor. Foreign policy will continue to be one of communist confronta­tion and continued military increases. In a world where Reagan views accomodation as being synonomous with appeasement and surrender, the prospects for real arms control agreements appear dim. The President has dis­played the same domestic and foreign beliefs for nearly two decades. This is what Reagan really stands for, and a Republican vote in No­vember should be seen by Americans as a vote and mandate for the continuation of these policies. 
Paul Komyatte is the president of the ND­SMC Young Democrats and a senior in the College ofArts & Letters at Notre Dame. 


P.O.BoxQ 
Not at all amusing 
After reading Marc Ramirez's "Freshmen's Comprehensive Guide to the Campus," I felt compelled to respond immediately. I am a freshman and I was not at all amused by the infantile nature ofthe article. 
Mr. Ramirez showed very poor taste in writing such as asinine "guide." While we may not be fully accustomed to campus life, we most certainly are not the simpletons or children the author seems to think we are. 
What is really disturbing in this case in that heretofore I had been impressed by the quality ofThe Observer and the genuine kind­ness shown to me by most everyone I've met. Perhaps Mr. Ramirez should stick to writing sports and leave the sarcasm to someone else.

Bridging the social gap 
A visit fro01 01' Buddy Ted by Marc Ramirez features columnist There was too much blank space on the wall. Something had to go there, between the Marilyn Monroe calendar and the Budweiser sign. I figured that's where I'd put up the "Risky Business" poster. I had just pulled out the masking tape when there was a knock at the door. "Yeah?" I said, not expecting anyone important. "Come on in." And in did come in someone I hadn't seen in quite a long time, prohably since freshman year. I was pleasantly surprised. "Ted!" I exclaimed. "How's it going, old buddy?" "Fine, thanks," he answered. "How are you?" "Oh, all right, I guess," I said. "You know how it goes, classes here, classes there, no time to do anything. Why don't you have a seat?" He sat in the chair near the window, and gazed out onto the South Quad. "Don't mind me," I told him as I returned to the business ofputting up the poster. "I'm just trying to liven up the room." "Yes," he said. "I noticed your Budweiser sign." "Oh, that," I said. "Well, it's not really mine, you know. I just found it and it was the only thing that would fit there." Yeah, Marc, I thought to myself, I'm sure he buys that. "Uh," I began, trying to change the subject. "So, Ted, what brings you here today? Got something on your mind? Or did you just want to see my room? Sorry I haven't been by to see yours yet, but you know how it goes, here a quiz, there a quiz, everywhere a quiz-quiz." He sat quietly in the chair, surveying the furnishings ofthe room. His expression never changed, not even when he saw the latest issue ofNational Lampoon sitting on the dresser. It was too quiet for me. "Do you like it?" I asked him abruptly. "The room, I mean? It just needs a little work here and there, and I thought maybe this poster ·" I stopped, and saw the girl stretched out on the Porsche at the bottom of the poster. It fell from my hands and I turned, smiling a little. His expression still hadn't changed. "Someone gave that poster to me," I said. "I really didn't want it, but you know how it goes. Suddenly he spoke. "About your columns, Marc," he started. Ah, so that's what this is all about, I thought. Maybe if I butter him up a little, then. . "Hey, Ted, old buddy, old pal," I said. But he wa.o; quicker than I on this particular afternoon. "So, I'm never here, huh?" he demanded. "What's that supposed to mean?'' No change in the expression yet, but I could tell he was a little hot under the ol' collar. "Well, you know, Ted, I really didn't mean anything by that. I just don't see you around here a whole lot. I mean, you could drop by for Mass or an interhall game or a party ­well, scratch that last item." Oops. I had blown it again. "Why is it you never anything good to say about this University?" he a.o;ked me. "All Ed wanted to do was to found a nice little school here in the forest by the lake and now here you go cutting it down every chance you get." Boy. Did I feel like a heel. Excuse me while I crawl under the cabinet over here. "Well, you know, that's not entirely true, Ted," I said in a desperate effort to retain some sense of survival. "I do have some good things to say about Notre Dame. Like, I don't know what the Admissions Office is doing different now but those freshmen girls are something else. I saw one walking out on the Quad the other day who should have been against the law or something. You'd have liked her." Oops again. Open mouth, insert foot. Take two of these and call back in the morning. "lJh, you know what I mean, Ted." "Yes, well," he replied, trailing off. lJh, oh, I thought, it's the ol' "yes, well" again. Those "yes, wells" ofhis always bothered me. "You know what I want you to do, Marc?" he said. "I want you to write something good about Notre Dame in one of your columns. Your next one, as a matter offact." lbat expression had yet to change. 'Ihat bothered me more than his "yes, wells." "Can I write about the girls?" I asked timidly. He just stared at me. His expression never changed. Some things never change. "Didn't think so," I muttered. "Well, maybe I'll write about you coming by to see me. I mean, that's not something I anticipate every day, you know what I mean? But it's certainly a welcome change." "lhis is a special ca.o;e," he answered. "I'm a busy man. And I have togo." "Well, thanks for coming by," I told him. "Be sure to drop by again. Let's have lunch, what do you say?" "We'll see after your column comes out Monday. I'm counting on you. We're all counting on you." And with that he turned and walked out the door. "See you, Ted!" I shouted after him. "Hey, we're still friends, aren't we?" But he wa.o; already out of hearing range. Well, I guess I blew that lunch date. But you know how it goes. A column here, a column there. And some things never change, anyway.

I 
am a bridge junkie. 
Unlike alcoholism, the fact that 
I admit this is not a significant step 
towards a cure. I have no intention 
ofseeking help. 
I never wanted to be a bridge 
junkie. For years I resisted my 
grandmother's best efforts to teach 
me the game. At the time it just 
didn't seem worth the effort since I 
already knew how to play gin 
rummy and at least four different 
kinds ofsolitaire. 
Years later, I met a Grace quad 
full of math majors (and Karl the 
Business-Spanish major) who all 
played bridge. For nearly two 
semesters I resisted their best effort 
to indoctrinate me -a feat made 
easier by their built-in foursome. 
Then, last summer, years of restraint were wiped out as one of the four finally convinced me to buy a book and learn the basics Qohn still won't admit that I learned the game from him). It all started innocently enough. We only played when it was convenient. Later, convenient came to mean merely that no long distance phone charges were involved. And the concept offour bridge players living in the same room began to take on Utopian characteristics. 
After a year ofplaying bridge with the same five or six people, we discovered duplicate bridge -the 
game that brings together bridge 
junkies ofall ages, shapes and sizes. 
It was a humbling experience. 
Those cute little old ladies we all 
regard as the harmless 
grandmother-type took great joy in 
making it painfully evident that we 
were in the big leagues now. 
But it had its rewards. The governing body, the American Contract Bridge League, awards Master Points-MPs-(or rather, hundredths ofan MP) for doing well in sanctioned games. After about two months, I managed to accumulated one entire MP, and with it the lofty rating ofJunior Master. By then, the quest for MPs was all-consuming. A typical week this summer went something like this: 
 Sunday afternoon-My favorite day for bridge; people bring food. Today it's Swiss teams in the B Flight. This gives each player three other people to blame instead of just one partner. We do well. I'll hear about John's brilliant play on hand six for days. 
Monday night -Small club game in Niles. This is supposed to be one ofthe easier games in the area. Not tonight. I don't want to talk about it. 
 Tuesday night -Standard club game. The club is in Town & Country Mall, just behind Godfat­her's Pizza, where it's 25 cent pitchers ofbeer tonight. We slip out before the last round to order a pizza for after the game. 

 Thurday afternoon -Another club game. I take a long lunch hour (three and a half hours) to get humiliated by the harmless grandmother-types again. 
Thursday night -lbe regular game at the Elk's Lodge is cancelled for a big charity event in Elkhart. This sort of things brings out the best players. We make them look even better. 
 Friday night -Another club game. A second place finish. More (hundredths of) MPs.John's turn to hear about my brilliance. No more games until Sunday, when the week starts over again. 
Most of the people we talk to at 

the Bridge Center claim to have 
become bridge junkies when they 
were in college. To hear them talk, 
if you didn't play bridge, you were 
practically a social outcast. 
It seems that times have changed. My roommates and I are always in search ofa fourth for a game. We accept calls from bridge players at any time of the day or night, but our phone remains disappointingly silent. 
I'm at a loss to name six bridge players on this entire campus. They say that misery loves company. I'm not sure ifmisery is the word that I'd use, but bridge junkies areal­ways looking to recruit new players. 

Letters to a lonely God 
New broo01s sweeping clean 

by Rev. Robert Griffin 
features staff writer 
I
n London, I got a letter from Notre Dame saying that Fr. Van had resigned. The next day, more mail came telling me ofthe change ofadministrators in Student Affairs. In honesty, I felt frightened. At my age, any news ofchange brings the question, "What is going to happen next?" Notre Dame is my home; Holy Cross, the C.S.C. community, is my family; this campus is the world I have chosen out of all possible worlds to live in. How gracefully could I take the news I am obsolete here? Ordinary worries become as big as circus tents when you are as far away as London. 
Getting back to New York, I found there was good news and bad news. The bad news was that the old team ofleaders in Student Af­fairs, with whom I felt so com­fortable, had stepped down; fortunately, except for Van, they were being assigned new jobs at Notre Dame. The good news was the realization I have personal ties offriendship with members of the new team; no one has to convince me how fine they are. SisterJean and I have shared many a cup of hot chocolate after Mass, in the rector's room at Farley. John and Jackie Goldrick~s children were almost charter members of the congrega­tion of moppets and urchins for whom I used to say Mass. Dave Tyson is one of the few smoking C.S.C.'s with whom I occasionally light up at breakfast in Corby. Frank Cafarelli is a member of the same Eastern province of Holy Cross I belong to. They are all new brooms, sweeping clean. Maybe I will have to reach new plateaus ofunder­standing with each of them. I trust them as friends who wish me well. 
As for the team that just turned in their uniforms, I am grateful to them all. I would like to write a word ofpraise for Jim Roemer. 
Years ago, a priest by the name of 
Fr. Collins was appointed dean of 
students. When he was congrat­
ulated on his promotion, Fr.Collins 
sounded discouraged about the 
toughness of his job. "The years in 
that office," he said, "leave you 
either dead or infirm." From that 
time on, I knew the dean ofstu­
dents was a person I should be 
concerned for. 

Jim and Mary Ann Roemer and I belong, with others, to the same prayer group. My earliest impres­sions ofJim were that in dealing with students having disciplinary problems, he could come across gently, like a father. If that approach didn't work, he could come on tough as a lawyer, spelling out the consequences ofan action in terms of a fine or a jail term. I learned to see he didn't wear two different masks. Listening to him, I started to admire a good Christian man with a lawyer's know-how and a father's caring, who was sensitive to the feelings ofstudents and their par­ents. This double-barrelled vision came out ofhis personal experi­ence. He had some idea of what if feels like to be twenty, not quite sure ofyourself, but willing to take risks. As a family man, he could imagine what it must be like to get the letter or phone call notifying you that your son or daughter is in trouble. He has the sense ofhumor to be amused by the comedies of student life, and tears to shed when the tragedies happen. He has the common sense to be tolerant. In the 
years we have lived through at Notre Dame, ifthe students and rectors hadn't had a dean ofstu­dents as kindly and honest as Jim Roemer, we would have had to invent one, if we wished to grow as an institution in wisdom and grace. It's my impression that student life is less wild than it used to he. 
Now the new team has taken the 

field, and they're doing fine, as I 
guessed they would when I thought 
about it. It's not easy, when you're 
not many years away from sixty, to 
get excited at a new leader inviting 
you to stand at attention. It feels 
like the reluctance to be responsive 
you have when students want to 
enlist your support for the newest 
project they are promoting with 
quad Masses, almsgiving, fasting, 
and the raising of consciousness. It 
would really be a sign ofage or 
burnout ifI dragged my feet, be­
coming a spectator who watches as 
the parade passes by. We arc always 
on the verge ofsomething new that 
is happening. The Catholic Church 
is presently renewing itself as 
though it were living through a 
second spring. It would be unfor­
tunate ifthe university, which 
serves a church that keeps being born again in a tired old world, isn't greater tomorrow than it is today. The hopeful news that is breaking forth as the good news ofChristian­ity, reflecting on its experience, is that grace is everywhere. Grace is in the classrooms, the dorms, the chapels, the stadium, and the fris­bee games. Grace is offered to everyone: the elderly brother, the retired nun, the coaches, the coeds in their summer dresses, the newest priest; to the members of the dear, old team, whatever they are doing; and to the members of the new team, now gloriouly reigning. Most personally exciting, grace is given to me, if I have the courage to be young ofheart, and love enough to be a faithful servant. 
It's a long, long time from June to September. I'm no longer nervous as I was in the spring. I don't know what's going to happen this year, but I'm curous to sec. I'm hopeful of being ofservice on the new frontier envisioned by the young leader taking over from Van, as once in the lifetime of the country, the young Kennedy took over from the elder statesman Ike.

Tigers confident about AL East division 'race' 
Associated Press 
Detroit had just battered the Oak· land A's 12-6 and Tigers' right· bander Milt Wilcox, who had posted a career-high 14th victory, was saying that the team didn't know how good it was. 
And he was serious. 

"We've got guys on this team who are just starting to hit," Wilcox said. ''I'm just now beginning to pitch the way I thought I could pitch my whole career. Who can say how good we are?" 
With less than a month to go in the regular major league season, the Tigers appear destined to lead the American League East Division from start to finish. 
With their magic number for clinching the division title rapidly diminishing, it no longer is a ques­tion of whether the Tigers will win the pennant, but by how much. 
"The distance between us and the (runner-up) Toronto Blue Jays has made for a relaxed atmosphere," said Tigers' catcher Lance Parrish. "Everybody on our club is aware of where we are right now. I don't believe anybody on our club believes they (the Blue Jays) are going to catch us." 
The race in the AL east was essen­tially over after the first 40 games, as the Tigers raced to a record-setting 35-5 record. From that point on, Detroit could have played .500 ball and won 96 games. 
By the end of August, the Tigers were in position to play .500 the rest of the way and win more than I00 games. The Baltimore Orioles won the title last year with a 98-64 mark. 
Toronto's problem has been in­consistent relief-23 ofthe Blue Jays' defeats this year have been charged to the relievers, making their failure to win the bidding war for fireballing 
Rich  Gossage  last  winter  all  the  
more painful.  
'lbe  collapse  of  the  Orioles  

centers on a collapse of both pitch· ing and hitting. The Orioles' offense has been so weak that Rich Dauer, the good-field. no-hit infielder, is third on the club in hits, but his average is only about .250. Eddie Murray and Cal Ripkin just haven't been able to carry the Orioles' attack by themselves, and the team's bat­ting average has fallen to last in the American League. 
'lbe Orioles head into the final month of the season locked in a bat· tie for third place with the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox. If the Yankees fail, Manager Yogi Berra may be fired. If the Red Sox fail, Manager Ralph Houk may retire. 

Third-ranked Pitt falls to Brigham Young 
Associated Press 
PITTSBURGH · Robbie Bosco, the latest in a long line of Brigham Young's prolific passers, rifled a 50­yard touchdown pass to Adam Hays­bert with 1:37 left in the game Saturday as the Cougars rallied from an 11-point deficit to shock third· ranked Pittsburgh 20-14. 
Pitt, expected to contend for the national college football champion­ship, turned two third-quarter inter­ceptions into touchdowns to take a I4-3lead, but BYU came back. 
Bosco, a junior making his first start after playing behind All­American Steve Young in 1983, completed 25 of 45 passes for 325 yards and two scores. 
BYU cut Pitt's lead w 14-9 wht·n Bosco threw to Lakci Hcimuli with 
4:53 to go in the third quarter. BYll, after forcing a Pitt punt, drove from its 17 to tht· Panther 6 but dected to go for a field goal on a fourth-and· goal. Lee Johnson's 23-yard kick cut Pitt's lead to 14-12 with 9: I 5 to play. Bosco throws of 35 yards to Glen Kozlowski and 22 yards to Richard Orr keyed the winning drive. 
The Cougars needed just five plays to cover the 74 yards on the game-winning drive, with Haysbert heating cornerback Keith Tinsley for the TD, one of nine receptions for 14 I yards. 
BYU led 3·0 at the half on johnson's 3'7-yard field goal. 
Bill Callahan's 78-yard return of a Bosco pass with just over three minutes gone in the second halfgave Pitt a 7·3 kad. Pitt then made it 14-5 less than three minutl"~ later aftt-r Tinsley's 20-yard interception return to the BHI 20. A 14-yard Con· gemi to Chuck Scales pass set up Bailey's !-yard run with 8:31 left in the period.

Notre Dame finds its man 
The athletic department aims toward top and picks Lambert to lead climb 
By ERIC SCHEUERMANN 
Sports Writer 
A coach who has been successful in the past can usually produce a winner wherever he goes. Notre Dame hopes this will be the case with new head volley­ball coach Art Lambert. 
Lambert has been chosen to lead the team as it strives to become a national contender. 
"We're competing at the highest level in men's foot­ball and basketball," said Notre Dame athletic director Gene Corrigan, "and we wanted a second women's sport in addition to basketball in which we could try to attain national recognition. We're making a serious commitment. We'll be offering the NCAA maximum in scholarships, which is 12. We're especially excited about having someone with Art's knowledge and expe­rience lead the way because he came so highly recom­mended." 
The 48-year-old Lambert returns to coaching after a five-year absence, and will try to bring to Notre Dame the success that has followed him everywhere. 
A San Fransisco native, Lambert earned both bis un­

dergraduate and master's degrees at San Jose State. After 
spending time in the service, he took the job as water 
polo coach at Awalt High School in Mountain View, 
Calif., simply because "the thing I'd done all my life was 
athletics." 
While there, Lambert guided his team to four straight state championships. He continued his coaching career at DeAnza College in Cupertino, Calif., where he served as both swimming and water polo coach. 
He served as coach of the United States water polo team at the 1967 Pan American Games, and led the team to a gold medal. He also guided the United States Olym­pic water polo team, leading the USA to a fifth-place finish in 1968 and a bronze medal in 1972. 
In 1973, he moved on to become water polo coach at Stanford University, and continued his amazing success. His teams won two Pac-1 0 titles and took home the NCAA championship in 1976. 
Lambert began his volleyball coaching career in 1974, as he took over the duties as head coach of the Cardinal men's volleyball team. 
"I always had played volleyball," says Lambert, "and it struck me as something that would be fun to coach." 
He took over the women's volleyball duties as well in 1976, as the program moved from the club level to the varsity level. Success followed him into the volleyball arena, as his teams consistently qualified for both regional and national honors. 
After five rewarding years at Stanford, however, Lam­bert left Palo Alto and entered the real estate business. 
"Costs were skyrocketing, especially in the Bay Area," says Lambert, "and when I couldn't get a raise I had to do something." 
Lambert resided in Sandpoint, Idaho, and coached several United States Volleyball Association teams over the next five years. He enjoyed the Sandpoint area, but when Notre Dame called he decided to make the move to South Bend. 
"I accepted because it is something I enjoy doing," says Lambert. "I love teaching. I love coaching. I didn't enjoy sitting behind a desk, so I made the move." 
Lambert had been offered many jobs in the time pre­vious to Notre Dame's offer, but had never really con­sidered them. 
"I had had solicitations from other schools," says Lambert, "but none I really wanted to accept. I had promised myself after I left Stanford that if I ever returned to coaching, I would return at a comparable school." 
Asked about his experiences so far here at the Univer­sity, Lambert has nothing but the highest praise. 
"This is a great place to work," he says. "The support I have received from the students, the administration and the athletic department is something I never had before, not even at Stanford. It is a small school, and there is a tremendous amount of spirit. I feel very for­tunate to be here." 
And, if he lives up to his advance billing, Notre Dame will feel very fortunate to have him.

"Josie will start," says Lambert. "She has been working hard, playing very well, and is one of our headiest players. Hensler is also coming along very nicely after a slow start." 
Sophomore Mollie Merchant and freshmen Kathy Baker, Kathleen Morin, and jane Weldon will also be in the running for spots as outside Lambert. "Kathy Baker, a freshman, probably has the most experience on the team, only because she has played with the California Junior team. That really shows you how in­experienced the team is."

Although some ofthe Irish are fine leapers, play at the net appears to be the team's weakness this year. 
"For us to win," says Lambert, "we've got to keep the ball in play. We won't be able to play at the net with other teams. We don't have the leaping ability we should have for our size. So we'll have to serve ag­gressively, keep the ball in play, and let the other team make the 


WANTED: A third money-making sport to go along with thefootball and basketball programs. Must be able to draw a large amount oflocal residents as well as students to home games. In order to do this, must be able to compete with the best in the country. Ifyour sportfulfills these requirements, call the Notre Dame athletic department as soon as possible. 
Traditionally, college athletic departments arc split into two groups: major sports and minor sports. In order for a sport to be considered "major," it must fulfill a number of require­ments, all of which are interrelated. First, it must be able to field a team that can compete with the best in the country. Second, it must schedule games with the other top teams. Third, it must generate enough spectator interest that admis­sion can be charged to home games. Finally, it must be able to pay its own bills and, hopefully, some of the bills of the "minor" sports with the money it earns. 
In the present world of college athletics, it's becoming in­creasingly important for a school to have a third major sport. Costs for even the most minor ofsports are rising all the time. Some schools, especially those on the West Coast, have had some luck with third and even fourth major sports, but most schools are struggling and have reached the point where they must drop a program or two. 
Notre Dame has been fortunate that its football and basket­ball programs have been such big moneymakers. Both teams are among the most profitable of their kind in the country. Still, the past few years have seen a decline in the amount of money the sports bring in. One bowl game and no NCAA Tournaments have hurt. Obviously, it would be nice to have a third major sport to act as insurance in case the other two falter. 
Notre Dame hasn't been so fortunate in finding a third major sport that can sustain itself, though. The athletic depart­ment decided the hockey program was not making money and knocked it down to the minor sport level again. The depart-

Mike Sullivan 

ment also seems to feel that soccer could not serve as a moneymaker over the long run so it hasn't put much money into the program. It has put money into women's basketball, but that sport hasn't been able to generate much fan interest at this point. 
However, Art Lambert thinks he knows what sport can be Notre Dame's third major sport -volleyball. Lambert, you see, is the new volleyball coach. He is the person to whom the future of volleyball at ND is entrusted. Ifthe program doesn't take off with Lambert leading it, it will never take off. 
"Volleyball is the only sport here besides (football and bas­ketball) that can make money," says Lambert almost matter­of-factly. "The only other one I can think of -women's gymnastics-they don't have here." 
Lambert's view might seem a little biased, but he may not be too far from the truth. Volleyball does seem to have a bright future. 
One indication that volleyball can be big is the support and excitement the sport generated in the Olympics. Not only was the Long Beach Arena packed for every day ofvolleyball com­petition, but ABC's coverage also spent a good deal of time with both the men's and women's teams. By the time the American teams reached the gold-medal games, the popular gymnastics competition was long over and volleyball became one ofthe most popular events of the Games. 
This, ofcourse, isn't enough evidence to prove that volley­ball has a bright future. After all, you would expect volleyball to be popular in Southern California. But you wouldn't expect volleyball to be a fan favorite in Kalamazoo, Mich., would you? Yes, Kalamazoo, home of the Mid-American Conference champs Western Michigan. Kalamazoo, about one hour from South Bend, where 5,000 people turned out for one match and where an average of more than 1,000 people per game gathered to watch the Broncos play some of the best volley­ball east ofCalifornia. 
"Our immediate goal is to get to the level of Western Mic­higan," says Lambert, showing a picture of the Broncos playing in front of a packed house. "They may have the best team in the Midwest this year." 
The success ofvolleyball at WMU shows that volleyball can be popular in the Midwest and that there is volleyball talent in the area. Contrary to the common opinion that all the volley­ball talent is in the West, Lambert feels that the Midwest is full oftalent. "As far as volleyball, the Midwest is this far away from the West," he says, holding his index finger and thumb less than one-half inch apart. "There's this Calfornia mystique about volleyball right now, but the only thing that hurts the Midwest is the caliber of competition. Here we don't quite have it yet, but it's just around the corner." 
Without a doubt, however, Notre Dame is looking toward the top in volleyball. The athletic department has announced it will supply the maximum amount of scholarships ( 12) and will be upgrading the schedule every year. The school also is planning to help improve the volleyball programs around South Bend (where there is already plenty of talent), possibly using the programs as a feeder system. 
So the pressure is on Lambert and his program. Ifvolleyball can't cut it as a profitable sport, there probably isn't another sport at ND that can in the near future. Obviously, it will take some building, but there is so much untapped talent in the Midwest that it might not be too long before ND volleyball is one ofthe top programs in the country.

ND volleyball, under first-year coach Lambert, begins building toward top 
With a new head coach and many 
a.~:m.cu young players, the Notre Dame volleyball team kicks off the 1984 season tonight with high 
for a successful year. 
a poor season in 1983, in 
the Irish finished with an 11· 
record, the Notre Dame athletic 
decided to make a 
commitment to volleyball. 
"We've talked to volleyball 
people all around the country, and 
we're now prepared to do the kind 
of things that will enable us to com­
with the top teams in the lr.rmnu-v" said Notre Dame Athletic 
Gene Corrigan last spring 
the department decided to 
its move. 
The most important change in the has been the hiring of Art Lambert the drive for success on the ln:ational level. He comes to Notre 
after a five-year absence from 
u,,..,.,.. coaching. Starting in 1973, enjoyed five very success-years at Stanford University, 
he coached water polo, men's ""·"---··-" and women's volleyball. 

The task ahead of Lambert is not an easy one, as the schedule this year is the most difficult Notre Dame has ever faced. The Irish at this point do not appear to have the talent to be successful competing against the top teams in the country, so Lam­bert's primary job will be to lay the groundwork for the future. 
"This was a Division III program for quite awhile, and only last year moved to Division I," says Lambert. "The girls are all playing better and are giving 110 percent. But if we wish to be a national contender, we'll have to get more talent." 
Nevertheless, the talent that is present should provide for a suc­cessful first year under Lambert. 
Lambert's first job was to find a setter for his 5-1 offense, which in­volves one person setting for the other five. As the one player on the floor who handles the ball every play, a good setter is crucial in plans for a successful team. 
"Setters make hitters," explains Lambert. "If you have a great setter, you have a great team. Ifyou have an average setter, you get an average-to-poor team." 
Freshman Jill Suglich earned the 
job in practice after bringing impres· 
Season opener tonight 

Tough Boilermakers visit Irish 
The Notre Dame volleyball team, under the direction of first-year Art Lambert, opens its 1984 tonight at 7 p.m. in the ACC The young and inexperi-Irish, who are struggling to a firm foothold in Division I, right into the fire in the opener play host to powerful 
"P.rnln.. has one of the two best 
teams in the Midwest," 
Lambert. "I know they'll be tough on us because they smoked us last year ( 15-0, 15-1, 15-2)." 
The Boilermakers, who finished 
in the nation two years ago, did not fare quite as well last year but still wound up in the top twenty. 
Carol Dewey lost only two 

players from that squad, however, and the Boilermakers should chal­lenge for the national title once again. 
If a team's setter is the most im­portant player on the court, then Purdue should be in excellent shape as its veteran setter Annette Bauer returns for her fourth year as a starter. Three other players who started last year return also. Juniors Kim Corwin and Marianne Smith, and senior Kate Crandell should make things tough on the Irish. 
Lambert's squad is going to have to figure out a way to throw the talented Boilermakers off track. His squad is badly outmatched at the net and will have to use its speed to compensate for lack ofheight. 
Bearing the brunt of the burden will be junior Mary McLaughlin, who will start as setter for the first sive prep credentials with her from Chicago. But problems with her ac­hilles tendon will force her to miss the home opener tonight against Purdue. So Lambert has tabbed junior Mary McLaughlin, previously a hitter, to start as setter·against the Boilermakers. 
"Mary has never played setter before," says Lambert, "but she has good hands. She has a lot of savvy and a good head on her shoulders." 
The rest of the squad will be con­sidered either middle hitters or outside hitters. 
Three players-Tracy Bennington, Karen Sapp, and Gretchen Kraus ­will contend for playing time at middle hitter. Bennington, a junior, will aid the team greatly at the net with her excellent leaping ability. Sapp comes off a good freshman year, and also should threaten at the net with her jumping ability and strength. Freshman Kraus will look for playing time after an impressive career at Central Catholic High School in Maumee, Ohio. 
Lambert will have six players to choose from at outside hitter, in­cluding the two seniors on the 
see IRISH, page 10 

going to have to keep them off bal­ance. 
Senior Josie Maternowski will join McLaughlin in the starting lineup, but, beyond that, the other positions are still up in the air. 
Lambert realizes that his squad is not as talented as Purdue's but he will make sure that the Irish put pressure on the visitors. 
"We have to serve aggressively and make them make mistakes," he says. "Ifwe go down, we'll go down aggressively." 
Tonight's game is the first of two games over the next two days for Irish. Tomorrow night they tain IU-PU Indianapolis at 7 p.m. the Arena.

Beuerlein heads up 
quarterback corps 
ByJOE BRUNETTI 
Sportswriter 

Most college football coaches might feel a little uneasy starting a sophomore as their quarterback, but when the signal caller is Steve Beuerlein there is no need to feel nervous. 
Beuerlein may be only a sopho­more, but he has more experience than many junior and senior quarter­backs around the country. After the Irish suffered early season losses to Michigan State and Miami in 1983, Beuerlein earned the starting bid in the Colorado game, and guided the Irish to a 27-3 win while connecting on eight of 12 passes for 133 yards. 
The Californian also led the Irish 
to consecutive wins against South 
Carolina, USC, Navy, and Army. In 
addition, he didn't throw his first in­
terception until his 77th pass of the 
season. He also didn't throw an in­
terception in five ofthe ten games in 
which he played. 

"I'm very pleased with Steve," of­fensive coordinator Ron Hudson says. "He has thrown very few inter­ceptions, and I expect him to mini­mize his mental errors as much as possible." 
Beuerlein didn't prove to be a big­play-type quarterback in 1983, throwing only four touchdown passes, but Hudson hopes that the 203-pounder won't try to change things this year by concentrating on the big play. 
"I don't want Steve to try and make the big play," Hudson says. "I just want him to take what the defense gives him; then the big play will come naturally." 
Besides having the experience of an upperclassmen, the Servite High graduate also possesses the leader­ship abilities usually found in juniors or seniors. 
"The team believes in Steve," says Hudson. "He's a competitor, and he doesn't like to lose. That attitude breeds to the rest of the team. He's a very important team leader." 
Beuerlein's greatest asset seems to be his excellent field vision. He has a knack for hitting his second and third receivers, and he has good accuracy. 
"Steve has great field vision," Hud­son proclaims. "He really wants to learn. He is a committed student of the game." 
While the majority of the passing duties are going to fall on Beuer­lein's shoulders, senior Scott Grooms will have the unenviable task of anchoring the back-up spot. He must be ready to play at anytime, which obviously is not an easy posi· tion to hold; however, Hudson feels Grooms has the confidence and abil­ity to play this role. 
"We have confidence in Scott," says Hudson. "He can finish the game for us. I'm very confident he can do the job." 
Grooms entered the 1983 season as the number-two man, but a bro­ken collarbone in the opener against Purdue ended his season early. 
Gerry Faust received some good news this weekend from the doctor's office. Unebacker Mike Larkin, who sustained a knee injury in last Thursday's scrimmage, has been diagnosed by team doctors to have only suf­fered a partial tear ofligaments in his left knee. It had been feared that the injury was much more serious and would require sur­gery. Contrary to what was re· ported in last Friday's Observer, the knee will not have to be operated on. Larkin has been fitted with a cast, which will be on for at least four weeks. If the healing process is normal, the cast will be removed, and Larkin will be ready to play in six to eight weeks. 
After playing for the Irish in 1980 and 1981 , he transferred to Miami of Ohio for a semester before returning to Notre Dame in 1982. Due to the transfer to Miami he was forcd to sit out the 1982 season and served as the Irish prep team quarterback. 
Grooms is a smart player who is good at reading defenses and knows how to execute the fundementals. 
"Scott has some of the best fun­dementals I've seen," says Hudson. "He has also worked on his arm strength. He is throwing the ball harder, which is going to make him a better player." 
While the first two quarterback spots appear to be locked up, the number-three spot still is up for grabs. Three scholarship freshmen are vying for the second back-up role. High school All-American Terry Andrysiak, Terry Byrne, and Duke St. Pierre all have the difficult task of trying to learn the Irish of­fense. 
"They're struggling," Hudson says, "but they are picking it up slowly." 


The O~rvcr/P~tc Lache~ 

High school All-American Terry Andrysiak hopes to get some playing time this yearatquarterbackfor the Irish, but there are two others ahead ofhim on Gerry Faust's depth chart. Steve Beuerlein andScott Grooms appear tohave the top twospots locked up, asJoe Brunettipoints outin his story about the quarterbacks above.
