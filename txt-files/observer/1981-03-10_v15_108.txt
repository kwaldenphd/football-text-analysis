At Commencement 
Reagan coming to ND 
ByTOMJACKMAN 
Executive News Editor 
President Ronald Reagan, who was last seen in South Bend in April, 1980, as a Republican candidate for the GOP nomination, will return to Indiana in May to deliver the com­mencement address at Notre Dame's 136th Commencement Ex­ercises. 
Reagan will attend the ceremonies at the invitation of Uni­versity President Fr. Theodore Hcs­burgh, and will receive an honorary doctor of law degree from Notre Dame. More than 2,000 students are expected to receive (\egrees in the May 17 graduation, to be held in the Athletic and Convocation Center. 
The president has been to the Notre Dame campus twice before during his career, in addition to his visit to Saint Mary's last April. The last time was in 1976, again as a presidential candidate in the Republican primary, and previously in 1939, while shooting the film biography Knute Rockne.· All 
American. 
The film's star, Pat O'Brien, who played Knute Rockne, will also be receiving an honorary degree at the ceremony. Others who will receive honorary degrees will be an­nounced at a later date, University officials said. 
Reagan will be the fifth president to receive an honorary degree from Notre Dame. In 1977, Jimmy Carter utilized his commencement address to deliver his first major foreign policy speech, saying the United States would not be intimidated by 
Soviet expansionism. Dwight Eisen­hower spoke to the graduating class of 1960, and both Gerald Ford and Franklin Roosevelt reccivt·d degrees in special academic convot·ations during their tt·rms. 
Although capacity in the ACC's main arena is II,34'5, seating, as al­ways, will be limited to graduates and their guests. 
Reagan's film role as George Gipp, one of Notre Dame's finest football halfbacks, won him fame as "The Gipper," and hdped immortalizt• the catch phrase, "Let's win one for the Gipper." Interestingly, the sn:ne In which Reagan utters that line has been edited from all prints of the film, although Warner Brothers is now in the process of restoring tht·

President Reagan applied the finishing touches yester­day to an unprecedented budget-cutting blitz which delves into more than 200 federal programs to trim S5 billion from government spend­ing this year and S45 billion in 1982. Reagan formally submits his reworked budgets to Congress today. Already, he has drawn cheers from business and fiscal conservatives and outcries from the pained defenders ofdozens ofaffected social programs. Even as he completed the final draft, for example, thousands of coal miners marched upon the White House to protest would-be cuts in black-lung benefits. The administration contends that its program of budget and tax cuts, rol­
lbacks in federal regulation and federal lending and restricted growth of the nation's money supply will bring inflation down sharply and stimulate increased economic growth. At that, Reagan cautioned last week it could be a year before the economy takes an upward swing. Administration officials have confirmed that programs affected by the new round of cuts will include veterans 't>rograms, farm subsidies, water projects, subsidized loans, employment training and legal services. In addition, an administration official confirmed Monday that the new round of cuts will include a proposal to reduce federal sub­sidies to the federal Railroad Retirement Board, which oversees pen­sions for some 1 million retirees. -AP 
Three Pakistani air pirates threatened an 
''extremely drastic measure" against more than 100 hostages aboard a hijacked jetliner at Damascus airport yesterday ifimprisoned opposi­tion activists were not freed in Pakistan. Three Americans and two other U.S. residents were among the hostages. In its eighth day, the hijacking that began over Pakistan tied in duration the 1976 Entebbe incident, believed the longest-ever. Rumors of a possible Syrian com­mando assault to rescue the hostages circulated after Pakistani Presi­dent Mohammed Zia ul-Haq was said to have phoned Syrian President Hafez Assad and given him a free hand to deal with the situation. But veteran observers doubted any stormingofthe plane would take place while other options remained. Assad vowed to take "every possible effort to safeguard the lives of the passengers," a source said. The heavily armed skyjackers set no deadline for the threat they made of "drastic" action after flying the Pakistan International Airways jet from Kabul, Mghanistan, to the Syrian capital before dawn. The nature of the "drastic" measure was not specified, but the hijackers previously threatened to blow up the plane or shoot more captives. They killed a Pakistani diplomat Friday. -AP 
Coal miners shut down hundreds of mines and marched upon the White House 6,000 strong with chants of "Black lung kills!" yesterday to protest President Reagan's proposed cutbacks in benefits for victims of the deadly respiratory disease. The march, organized by the United Mine Workers, was the focal point that closed virtually all of the nation's major coal mines. UMW president Sam Church called for the two-day "memorial period" as labor's response to President Reagan's claim last month that the black lung benefits fund was in shaky condition because of alleged award abuses. The president called for tighter eligiblity standards and a"reasonable" coal tax increase upon mine operators. Church vowed a bitter fight by the union, which has 160,000 active members. AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland joined the ensuing half-mile march to the White House. As they passed the White House, many members shouted "Down with the jellybean!" referring to the president via his sweet tooth. There was no reaction from:Reagan, but an administration official repeated Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan's assertion of last weekend that his aim is to make the black lung program solvent, not deprive deserv­ing claimants. According to the Labor Department, about 350,000 miners or their widows currently receive monthly black lung checks ranging from S254 to S508 for a miner with three children. -AP 
Ronald Reagan will visit Ottowa, canada 
today on his first foreign trip as president. Behind the smiles of Canadian friendship he will find an undercurrent of irritation over American-Canadian issues and mounting disapproval for his emerging global policies. The new president's 28-hour visit will be the first to Canada by an American chief executive since Richard M. Nixon travelled to Ottawa in 1972. U.S. officials say the trip is designed main­ly as a get-acquainted session for Reagan and Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. But in their several hours of talks, the two leaders will have a host of U.S.-Canadian problems to discuss, most dealing with economic and environmental matters. Differences will probably emerge over international issues as well. Trudeau, a long time vocal proponent of East-West detente, can be expected to urge Reagan to soften his tone toward the Soviet Union and to accept Soviet President Leonid I. Brezhnev's offer of a summit meeting. The Canadian leader is also likely to urge that the Reagan administration halt the reduction of U.S. foreign aid and to question Reagan closely about American involvement in El Salvador. Trudeau has already 
criticized U.S. military aid to the government of the violence-torn Central American nation. -AP

Sealed with a clout 
Ah, babies. Nothing is quite so effective as a baby of any species for initiating cooing sounds from otherwise staunch stoics. This includes the adorable little harp seal, who, with its big, dark eyes and cheerful coun­tenance, can melt even the iciest ofhearts. 
With some exceptions, that is. Each year hundreds of thousands ofseal pups are slaughtered in Alaska, Canada and Norway. Hunters approach the little fellows as they sun themselves on the ice, lmock than senseless with a club and proceed to slit their throats. Two minutes from the first onslaught, only the skinless and bloodied carcass ofthe baby seal remains. 
What makes the baby harp seal so attractive to the hunter is its snow-white fur, which brings top dollar on the market. And what makes the assault so repulsive to its opponents is the inherent friendly and trusting 
nature of the seals. They do not fear their hunters, and thus are unable to save themselves. The Humane Society is Sltepping up its efforts to save 
the species, by increasing anti-seal-hunt publications. It dubbed March I "Seal Sunday" and urged citizens on that day to write their representatives in support ofthe 
Marine Mammal Protection Act, which bans the im­portation ofharp seal skins into the U.S. 
Apparently, though, this ban is not enough. The hunt continues. ./i . .. .

England's University of York, found that Canadians may be overestimating the harp seal population by as much as one-third, while.seriously underestimating the rate of natural mortality. They warn that the quota may be too high, and that, when combined with the decline of edible sea life, spells disaster for the future of the species. 
One cause for concern is the apparent disregard for life exhibited by proponents of the hunt. The fur of these babies, while it is used to line gloves and jackets, is not necessary for human survival. Even the hunters who do the bloody deed receiv'e little of the more than 1!6 million realized each year from these hunts. The stan­dard fare is S200 per hunter per season. The profits, it seems, go to the large, mostly Norwegian corporations that process the skins. 
Four of the large "factory" ships that transport the hunters to and from the site are owned by Norwegian corporations, and the Canadian hunters must pay them room and board, as well as turn over their catches. 
It is no coincidence that Norwegian firms rake in the dough. Norway, the world's leading importer of harp

every year. The Norwegians, though, kill a mere 20,000 of the home-grown variety. The "practical" use of the corpses is confined to the flippers, which are viewed as an edible delicacy by the Norwegians. But, whether it be fried flipper, flipper fricassee, fillet offlipper, or even fl!Jwer flambe, it is hardly enough to justify the brutal 
murders. From Norway, the pelts not used domestically are ex­ported, some back to Canada, and the rest to Europe, most notably West Germany. France and Italy have banned the imports. 
Humane societies all over the globe are fighting this practice as loudly and as practically as they can. Many noted Hollywood stars are also involved in a "Save the

animals by giving each ofthe four countries a percent­age of the seal skins garnered on the Pribilofs. The Soviet Union conducts a hunt, simultaneous to that of the U.S., and, under the treaty, divides 30 percent ofits catch between Canada and Japan, while keeping the remainder. The u:s. is subject to similar restrictions. 
The most alarming fact of this hunt is that we, American taxpayers, are financing this practice. The fact that the Aleuts kill three-year-old bachelor seals, rather than the weeks-old babies, does not really mat­ter. It is why they do it that we should examine. 
The money is insignificant, really. The employment can only last throughout the month of July, and it is low-paying at best. The distressing fact is that Americans will continue to create a market for the products of the local slaughter, as they wear their fur "badges" with hauteur. 
It does take some amount of courage to sport dead animal remnants with pride in their ability to elevate one's social status. Vanity, thy name is idiot.

AfterJudy,s execution, Carrs reflecton ordeal 
By DAN LEDUC 
News Staff 
MICHIGAN CITY, Ind. -The foster parents ofexecuted murderer Steven T.Judy reflected quietly on the hours before their son's death. "HL'I day came, it finally came:," a sad and bitter Mary Carr said of her foster son. 
"He's really, actually dead." Mrs. Carr and her husband, Roben, described their last moments withJudy during a hastily called news conference at a local motel. 
"He made a final request tonight, a few minutes before midnight," Mrs. Carr said. "He asked them (prison officials) to take some pictures of him because he was proud of his new haircut." 
Judy's head had been shaved in preparation for the electrocution. Mr. Carr ~nd Judy's attorney, Steven Harris, witnessed the execu­tion at Judy's request. 
"He just wanted me to be there, so that's why I was there," Mr. Carr said. "I didn't panlcularly want to go but he felt like he wanted me there:." 
The Carrs complimented prison officials for their professionalism. "They kept talking about how they were going w be professional and do It with dignity," Mrs. Carr said. "And they were terribly profes­sional." 
Mrs. Carr sald Judy received a telegram from a former girlfriend named Jeannie In Texas 90 minutes before his execution. Harris ar­ranged a telephone call to the girl for Judy sometime after II p.m. 
"This Is the one girl in Stevt>'s entire life that he ever loved," Mrs. Carr said. After the call Judy broke down and cried. He composed himself, however, and walked to the electric chair unaided. 
Mr. Carr said the body would be taken to Indianapolis. "We'll show him on Wednesday and he will be buried on Thursday." 
When asked if she felt relieved that the ordeal was over, Mrs. Carr replied, "Not yet. 1 don't feel relieved. I don't really feel that he's dead -not yet." '

Features AIESEC Offers Overseas Internships 

W
h~t makes AIESEC (pronounced "eye-sec") spe­Cial? According to Business Week, "It's a foreign internship deal that can make most junior year-abroad programs seem like child's play." 
AIESEC (The International Association ofStudents in Economics and Business Management) was established in 1949. Currently it opcratcs in ';7 countries and ovcr l47 univcrsitics, including ';7 in thc U.S. 
One of AIESEC's primary objectives is to promote in­tcrnational undcrstanding and cooperation through husincss by dcveloping a pcrccptivc corps ofintcrna­tional managcrs. Its main instrumt·nt to foster this goal is an annual traincrship program. To apply for thl· inter­nship, onc must hc involvcd wih the local chaptcr to raise trainct:~llips in the South lknd-l'ort Wayne­Chicago area. For cvcry trainccship raiscd, a rncrnbcr of AIESEC-Notrc Damc has the opportunity to work for a t1rm in any busincss-rclatcd field in one of';7 countries. By involving himsclfwith AIESEC, a students develops managerial skills and makes business contacts thcrchy exposing himself to tht· busincss world. 
This year eight Notre Dame students will gain valuable business experience through this program. They will bc working with multinationals in Holland, Japan, France, West Germany, Spain and South Amcrica. 
AIESEC also sponsors regional and national con­ferences for members where distinguishcd guests arc invitcd to address the group about the dynamics of the United States industry. This past December, the annual National Conference was held at the Harvard Graduate School of Business. The conference was attended by 400 AIESEC-ers and speakers included Eliot Rkhardson-formcr Secretary of the Treasury, Dr. Rohl·rt Gough-vkc president ofData Resources, profes­sors from Harvard Law School and Business School, and other distinguished pcrsons. 
AIESEC-Notrc Dame wclcomes all Notre Dame and Saint Mary's business and economics students and urges tht·m to take advantagc ofthis uniquc opportunity. An informational meeting will he held tomorrow in thc LaFortune Little Theater at 7 p.m., for all interested stu· dents. 
'Chimingin 'at Saint .!;wary 's 
M 
ay is somcthing to look forward to. It means, ofcourse, graduation. It means finals and -ah! -blessed summer. It means A-frames and 
picnics at the dunes. It means barrcn lilac hushes 
( thcy've been raldcd by rosary-armcd worshippers of 
the Virgin Mary: May Is her month). It means a box of 
Fannie Farmer and a sappy card for your mother. 
May means, too, the annual publication ofChimes. 
Chimes Is the literary publication ofSaint Mary's Col­lege. In it arc to be found many pleasures/treasures. Last year's 68-page issue kicked offwih a paroy ofKenneth Koch's "My Misunderstandings," wherein author Mic­hck Strohman can't understand "crew cuts or/parents who make their Kids get crew cuts... and why Sunday is a day of rest when everyone is tired anyway..." In "Hcdy," Adri Trigiani awakes one morning to discover that "the acne gel was gone and... the underplucked eyebrows/were now perfect arches/just like Saint Louis'": overnight she has metamorphosed into a Hedy Lamarr look-alike. Katie Willson's poem "On the Event 
ofYour Loved One Hanging Upon You When You Were Still Saying Goodbye" needs no explanation. 
Though Chimes is edited and compiled by Saint Mary's students, it welcomes submissions from all quar­ters. In recent issues, Notre Dame students, members of the South Bend community, alumnae, and faculty have contributed. In 1978, for example, the poetry ofSaint Mary's English professorJean Rodes was accompanied by illustrations specially executed by New York artist Margo Hoff. As posters have stated, Chimes is for all writers, artists, poets, "and other significant people who don't Iron." 
Thus the annual distribution ofChimes each May is 

an event. For one thing, copies are free! For another, it's a vehicle by whi··' ···rit•·rs and artists can sec their labor~ in print wiL·•· 1ptying their pockets to "Publish-it·Yourself' outl1ts. The Chimes editorial staff Is now in the process ofsoliciting poetry and short prose, photos, drawings, and .prints for the '81 edition. lntt·rcstcd cn·ative sorts should contact Editor Adri Trigiani, Art Editor Mary Fickes, or advisor Max Westlcr 
Mary Pat Fickes

ly leg on the record-setting 400-yard medley relay (3:34.15, old record­
3:39.33) in an unofficial :50.3, which although faster than his :50.95 clock­ing, can't qualify for a record. Shepardson finished the weekend by anchoring the school's best ever 400-free relay (3:11.51, old record­3:13.5). 
"Shep just had the weekend ofhis life," smiled Stark. "He just put his injuries of the past behind him, and showed what he really can do." 
The Irish chalked up just two first place finishes among the 18 events. In addition lO Shepardson in the 50 fly, sophomore diver Paul McGowan performed almost flawlessly from the one-meter board, totaling 
41 1.75 points on 11 dives to take the championship. 
Junior Pat LaPiatney displayed the speed that put him in the books two years ago by breaking his old marks in both the 100-(:54.64, old record :55.1) and 200-yard backstroke 
( 1 :59.36 ), good for second and third place respectively.

something that has not been done in three years. He recorded bestsin the 100-(1:02.34, old record 1:02.3) and 200-yard (2:16.65, old record 
2:16.9) breaststroke preliminaries. 
And for the 1Oth time in his three­year career, Don Casey broke the school record in the 200-yard but­terfly with a I :57.40, two-tenths ofa second better than his previous best. 
Yet there were several best-ever performances turned in by people who didn't set records. Junior John Gibbons became only the third Irish swimmer ever to swim a sub-2:00.0 200-yard butterfly with a 1:58.95. Freshman Mark Staublin posted a personal best in the 400-yard in­dividual medley -4:21.27 in the consolation final. 
"I wish we could have had 
everyone along on the trip," Stark 
said, referring to the fact that he had 
to leave two of his standout perfor­
mer in South Bend because of il­
lnesses. "It's hard to say what would 
have happened, but I'm sure we'd 
have been right in there with Brad­
ley for second place." 
Freshman butterfly specialist Dan Flynn in recovering from a partially­collapsed lung and sophomore Lou Bowersox, a valuable asset in the backstroke, is recovering from strep throat. 
"I know that both would have scored points for us," added Stark. "Dan would have been right up there in the 200 fly, the 400 IM and the 1650 free, and Lou has been one ofour top men in the backstroke for the past two seasons."

Irish s-wimmers break 12 records 
By MICHAEL ORTMAN 
Sports Writer 
It was a fitting climax for a super season, and at long last, the Notre Dame swimming team lived up to its pre-season billing as the school's fas­test ever, Dennis Stark's Irish capped off its 9·3 1980-81 season this past weekend with a third-place finish at the annual Midwest Invitational Swimming Championships in Terre Haute. 
The highest Notre Dame had ever finished in the annual meet was fifth. The Irish totaled 306 points. Second place Bradley finished with 338 and champion Western Kentucky finished atop the I I-team field with 396 points. 
The Irish almost completely rewrote the school's record book, chalking up the best times of the season in every event including 12 new Irish marks. 
"It was just a super effort by everybody," said a proud Stark. "The other coaches were really surprised. They were wondering how come we were swimming so fast." · 
Stark may have been asking him­self that same question. Sycamore Pool is certainly not one of the fas­test pools the Irish competed in this season, and Notre Dame swimmers had recorded only one new school mark all season. 

Freshman Tim Jacob started the record-setting three-day meet off for the Irish with a 4:51.12 clocking in the 500-yard freestyle, almost two seconds better than the previous standard. Senior co-captain John Komora followed in the 200-yard in­dividual medley, and became the first Irish swimmer ever to break the two-minute barrier in the event. His time of 1:59.85 bettered Glenn Battle's record of 2:00.7 set last season at the same meet. The time also earned Komora second place in the event. 
Junior Michael Shepardson made it three straight, breaking the lon­gest standing Irish record -the 50­yard freestyle. His :21.47 in the preliminaries beat Jim Kane's six­year old mark of :21.5. Later in the weekend, Shepardson etched his name in the record book three more times. In the SO-yard butterfly, the Cooper City, Fla., native shattered his old varsity mark of :52.6 set last spring with a :50.95 clocking, also establishing a new pool record. 
Shepardson also swam the butterf-

Players' day off 

Irish recovering from DePaul 
Editor's Note: For the next three weeks Digger Phelps will join with Observer sports columnist Frank LaGrotta in logging this daily diary ofNotre Dame's preparationsfor NCAA tournamentplay. 
Sunday night we returned from Chicago and spent a few hours watching film of Georgetown against Con­necticut at Connecticut. Right now our main concern with Georgetown is their quickness. They are very or­ganized but their players tend to freelance quite a bit. They are not a great outside shooting team but their record this year is deceiving. 
As far as james Madison is concerned we have no film of them available right now but we've been in touch with some people back east and we know that they are a ball control team that likes to press and miX zones on defense. 
Yesterday we spent most ofthe afternoon looking at 
films of the DePaul game. My observations after watch­
ing all but the last five minutes of the game are as fol­
lows: 

1) We definitely forced too many situations that resulted in turnovers for us. 
2) We did not rebound well, but that's partly because the rebounding situations were abnormal. By that I mean that the ball came off the rim in funny ways be­cause ofthe long-distance shots that they took in many situations. 
3)We just got cold in key situations. The shotswe are usually goingto make we did not make against DePaul. I really doubt if Tripucka, Woolridge, Jackson and Pax­son will pLay that poorly in the tournament. I think if those four guys play the way they're capable ofplaying, well, we're as good as any team in the counrry. 
As f.tr as Timmy Andree and joe Kleine, I. think they pLayed better together against DePaul than they have all year. What we have been looking for is not so much for one or the other to take over, but to get solid play from both ofthem much in the ~me was we did from Bruce Flowers and Bill Laimbeer two years ago. 

Another thing the films showed was that De,Paul got most of the breaks. By that I don't necessarily mean all the referee's calls, but if there was a loose ball they'd come up with it. If there was a jump ball, they'd get it. Every basketball team has that kind of day once in a while. We had it against Dayton last week. You just have to hope that when you play a great team like DePaul that you don't hit them on a good day. 
One thing 1did notice about the officiating was that Mark Aguirre was protected. There were five or six oc­casions we saw on film when he pushed offaftoer he had his fourth foul and nothingwas called. It is very difficult to play against someone as good as Aguirre when he is allowed to do practically anything he wants and no fouls are called. 
Personally, yeah, I'm disappointed, but I'm excited about beginning the tournament so I'm not going to allow the loss to bofher me. I don't really put much stock in the stuffabout a loss like that helpinl!: us as we head into the NCAA's. Two years ago we lost our last game against Michigan and we lost in the regional finals. The year before that we lost our lastgame at Dayton and made it to the Final Four. 
Last year we yvon our last two games against DePaul 
and Dayton and we all know what happen•ed in the 
tournament. This is a new season for us. No looking 
back, no looking ahead. Right now all we're worried 
about is Georgetown andJames Madison. Period. 
That's the way we're going to play it this year. One 
game at a time. 
NITcontesttakes NCAA tourney rejects 
By LARRY SIDDONS 
APSports Writer 

WASHINGTON (AP)-With one conference champion, II teams with 20 or more victories, representatives from some ofthe nation's basketball hotbeds and the only team to beat DePaul, the National Invitation Tournament is compiling an intriguing field for its 44th edition. 
The nation's oldest post-season collegiate basketball competition announced bids Sunday for all but two spots in the 32-team tourna­ment that begins Tuesday night with Fordham at Dayton and ends in Madison Square Garden March 25. 
There was no word when the final two spots would be filled. 
Once the more prestigious of the nation's two major-college postseason tournaments, the NIT must now wait for the National Col­legiate Athletic Association to select schools for its burgeoning field. 
Syracuse, a surprise winner ofthe Big East Conference tournament but bypassed by the NCAA, was extended an NIT bid. 
So were Clemson, which burst into the national rankings at mid­season and finished 20-I0 after a rugged Atlantic Coast Conference schedule; South Alabama, 23-5; Tulsa, 2I-7; Southern Mississippi, 20­6; Duquesne, 20-9; Rhode Island, 21-7; San Jose State, 2I-8; Texas­Arlington, 20-7; American, 24-5; West Virginia, 20-8, and North Carolina A&T, 21-7. 
Also invited was Old Dominion, which finished 18-9 including a victory oversecond-ranked DePaul on ODU's home court last Decem­ber. Should both teams win their respective tournaments, the NIT would have the distinction ofhaving as its champion the only team to beat the national champ this season. 
Old Dominion opens NIT play Wednesday at Georgia, 18-11. 
Syracuse was denied an automatic NCAA berth because the Big East is a relatively new conference. But the Orange, 18-11, will be joined in the NIT by two other Big East teams -St.John's, 1 7-10, appearing in its 24th NIT and 17th consecutive postseason tournament, and Con­necticut, 19-8 after being unbeaten midway through the season. 
Clemson was one oftwo ACC teams picked, joined by Duke, 15-12. And the Big Ten, often mentioned with the ACC as the nation's stron­gest basketball conferences, was honored with three NIT selections -Michigan, Purdue, and Minnesota, all17-10.
