Sutherland finally returns to U.S. soil 
GRAPEVINE, Texas (AP) ­Thomas Sutherland arrived in the United States on Monday after 6 1/2 years as a hostage in Lebanon and said he would go back some day if his family and the government let him. 
"Beirut is a different place from what it was," said Sutherland, accompanied by family members after a flight from Germany. 
The American University in Beirut, where Sutherland was dean of agriculture when he was abducted June 9, 1985, was shattered by a bomb re­cently and needs rebuilding. "I would like to be part of that if it's possible," he said. 
Sutherland spoke to reporters at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport before going on to Berkeley, Calif., for Thanksgiving at the home of a daughter who is nearly nine months pregnant anc! couldn't fly. 
'"It's going to be absolutely wonderful," Sutherland said.

"There just isn't enough time in the day to catch up on every­thing that's happened." 
His wife, Jean, said she had no fear about going back to the Middle East, where she felt "very comfortable." Sutherland said it would be months before he made such a decision and he would first listen to what his family and the State Department tell him. 
Sutherland, 60, and Terry Waite of Britain were released Nov. 18. Their release was widely seen as the most impor­tant sign that freedom is near for all hostages taken by Iranian-backed Shiite Muslims in Lebanon. • 
Sutherland's captors told him two of the three remaining U.S. hostages would be freed in a few days. American Terry Anderson, the longest-held Western hostage, would be re­leased by the end of the month, Sutherland said.

Cease-fire holds in most of Croatia 
ZAGREB, Yugoslavia (AP) ­Sporadic shelling echoed around the strategic city of Osijek on Monday, but the 14th cease-fire in Yugoslavia's civil war reportedly held elsewhere in Croatia. ., · 
There were growing signs that Serbia and Croatia were trying to extricate themselves from the increasingly brutal war, which began after Croatia's June 25 declaration of independence. 
Some federal troops began withdrawing from army gar­risons in Croatia after the re­public's government agreed to lift a blockade on the bases, and Croatian and federal mili­tary leaders reached an agree­ment in Zagreb for an ex­change of all prisoners, the state news agency Tanjug re­ported. 
The accord was to be signed Tuesday. In a preliminary ges­

WASHINGTON (AP) -The Senate voted Monday to spend up to $500 million to help the Soviet Union dismantle its nu­clear arsenal rather than risk letting it fall into the hands of terrorists or third-world dicta­tors. 
The 86 to 8 vote, as Congress pushed toward a pre­Thanksgiving adjournment, came after several Democratic senators declared a political truce on the issue, promising not to criticize President Bush if he goes ahead with the aid. 
The Senate also voted 90 to 4 to approve a treaty setting strict ceilings on conventional weapons in Europe -a pact that nearly has become an anachronism just a year after it was signed. The tally was well above the two-thirds needed for

Despite claims it is outdated, Majority Leader George Mitchell said the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty "remains an important benchmark and building block for ensuring the future security of the European continent." 
With just one day left before adjournment, lawmakers took these other actions: 
• 
Hous·e Democrats were poised to seek a floor vote on a compromise ~rime bill that President Bush said was "simply not acceptable." Republicans, meanwhile, threatened to filibuster the leg­islation in the Senate, saying the bill was too soft on crime.

Congressional tax commit­tees approved a bill to extend 12 targeted tax breaks sched­uled to expire Dec. 31. The ex­tensions are strongly supported in both parties as helpful in a time of economic stress.

ailing savings and loans. And negotiators pressed to improve unemployment benefits even beyond the extension enacted two weeks ago. 
On Soviet aid, debate revolved around whether helping dis­mantle the former adversary's nuclear weapons was an urgent enough need to warrant U.S. taxpayers picking up part of the tab. 
"The question ... is, whether having won the Cold War, we are willing to join with our former adversaries to eliminate the Armageddon arsenals" it produced, said Sen. Joseph Biden, D-DeL "To defeat it would be a reckless gamble with history."

Saint Mary's considers three new official clubs 
By NICOLE MCGRATH 
News Writer 
A proposal for three new offi­cial clubs on Saint Mary's cam­pus was brought before Saint Mary's Board of Governance meeting last night. 
The three clubs proposed were the Asian Organization, the Sisters of Nefertiti Organization and FUERZA, a Hispanic organization. All three clubs promote cultural aware­ness and are open to anyone in­terested, the clubs' representa­tives said. 
Janet Yuen, representative for the Asian Organization, said "We want to recognize our diversity on Saint Mary's cam­pus." Membership is open to anyone interested in Asian cul­tures and customs, 
The Sisters of Nefertiti Organization is already active on campus, said representative Michelle Hill. Last spring, they put on a dance program. Currently, they are sponsoring a toy drive on campus. 
Delia Garcia, representative of FUERZA, explains that "FUERZA is a Spanish acronym for strength and unity among the races." 
All three clubs are interested in planning a multicultural week in conjunction with MINT, Saint Mary's minority office. The clubs are willing to work with admissions as well, ac­cording to Yuen. 
At this time, the clubs are not asking for any funding from the Board of Governance. They only hope to be recognized on Saint Mary's campus. 
In other business, a spring activities night has been set for Jan. 30. The activities night would run from 6 -8 p.m. It is tentatively set to be held in the LeMans Hall lobby.

INSIDE COLUMN 
ND could take lesson from undergrad Ivies Although Notre Dame prides itself on catering to undergraduates: it is difficult to discern the truth of that claim from observing campus life. Take DART, for example. Has it made life easier? Just three years ago, it Dave Dleteman was possible to get a class Sports Editor you wanted-provided you-......L--=-=--~.:...:....:...-­had the prerequisites and the gumption to get up early enough and wait in line. So what has DART accomplished? As things stand, many students find them­selves unable to get decent electives until they are seniors. To be blunt, DART has all the problems that checkmarking had. People still get closed out o classes. Worst of all, DART fails to solve the greatest problem facing this University-an appalling dearth of professors. It seems, therefore, that the University would be well-advised to hire some more faculty members, pawn all its expensive DART equipment and go back to the checkmarking system. Second, consider the course load which undergraduates must take. At Notre Dame, students take a minimum of 12 credits per semester, and, if they wish to graduate on time, must take 15 credits each semester. How many people have enough time and energy to wholeheartedly devote themselves to 15 hours of coursework every semester? What do you learn from doing that? Notre Dame would be advised to follow the lead of the Ivy League colleges and lessen the number of classes required for graduation. Most of the Ivies require well under 40 classes for graduation. If Notre Dame can imitate the Ivy League schools by getting rid of maid service, why not follow their lead on a more important issue: the quality of undergraduate education. Were Notre Dame to lower its class re­quirements, a number of problems would be solved, provided that the University did not cut back the number of classes or faculty. First, the quality of work would improve. No longer forced to waste energy on a fifth class, students could go into greater depth in their classes. It would be easier for the sloths to slip by without much effort, but the benefits accrued by those who worked would outweigh the bad point of making life easier for the lazy. Second, the professorial shortage would not be as serious. With every student taking only four classes, one extra class per student would be less in demand. Class sizes would shrink and the quality of education would rise in proportion. Third, a return to checkmarking would be easier. With less people struggling to fill the same classes, there would be less demand for classes in general, thus making classes easier to get. The views are those of the author and not necessarily those ofThe Observer.

Haitian officials read)' for elections 
•PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti-Haitian authorities said Monday they were prepared to call new elections in defiance of the international community, which wants the reinstatement of deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. After Aristide's ouster Sept. 30 in a military coup, lawmakers were pressured by the army to declare the presidency vacant and name a new provi­sional government, which would call elections within 90 days. The Organization of American States denounced the coup, refused to recognize the new government and called for a trade embargo to push for Aristide's rein­statement. The embargo has created a severe fuel shortage and crippled Haiti's economy. Some politicians expressed confidence that the United States, grappling with a sudden surge in Haitian boat people, would ease a punishing trade embargo even if Aristide were not returned to power.

•MI MI-Colombian drug lords gave the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan Contras 
~ 
up to $10 million, imprisoned kingpin Carlos Lehder testified yesterday in Manuel Noriega's drug smuggling trial. Lehder, who is trying to reduce his life sentence for drug trafficking by testifying against Noriega, acknowledged the contribution after the defense confronted him with a March 1990 prison interview he granted. The U.S.­supported Contras battled Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government throughout much of the 1980s -in part with help from Oliver North's illegal supply network. Noriega's defense has contended that some drug traf­ficking in Central America was accepted by the United States to support the Contras. Lehder has previously said the cartel paid Noriega to tranship cocaine though Panama to the United States between 1982 and 1984.

Noriega, who surrendered to U.S. invasion troops in January 1990, is charged with 10 drug and racketeering charges. If convicted, he faces a sentence of up to 140 years in prison. 
Kiss member Eric Carr dies of cancer 
•NEW YORK-Drummer Eric Car.r of the hard-rock group Kiss has died of complications from cancer, his publicist said Monday. He was 41. Carr had a malignant tumor removed from his heart earlier this year, then underwent chemotherapy for cancer in his lungs. The cancer appeared to go into remission, and he attended the MTV music video awards program in September, but two days later he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage. Soon afterward he suffered another hemorrhage and never regained consciousness, said his spokeswoman, Carol Kaye of Kayos Productions in Manhattan. Carr joined Kiss in 1980 after one of its founding members, drummer Peter Criss, left. Though he joined the band after the group's heyday, Carr performed for three years in makeup until the group dropped the theatrics in 1983. Carr is survived by his parent~ and two sisters.

Petrosky will spend the one-year graduate fellowship studying international relations and living in Germany, Austria or Switzerland. The Rotary Foundation Board of Trustees will inform her in December of the rmal location. Petrosky is one of only two winners in her district of western Pennsylvania. Petrosky said she is excited about living abroad because it will enhance her language ability and give her an experience in a culture other than her own.

N.V. schools to give out condoms 
NEW YORK (AP) -A con­dom-on-demand program that survived repeated attacks be­gins a long phase-in Tuesday in the nation's ·largest public school system. 
Specially trained teachers and guidance counselors will make condoms available to students in at least one school. Parents' permission isn't required. 
James Vlasto, a Board of Education spokesman, said 16 schools will be phased in during the next two weeks. The board aims to make condoms avail­able to 260,000 students at 120 public high schools by the end of 1992. 
Proponents say the program -part of a strengthened kindergarten-through-high school AIDS curriculum ­could help slow the spread of the disease and other sexually transmitted diseases. 
Opponents say the program interferes with parental rights and religious beliefs and could give teen-agers a false sense of security. 
"We -and I refer to a whole broad range of clergy and par­ents who were involved in this -do not believe this is the an-

"We also feel from a moral point of view that this is send­ing the wrong message to our young people: that it is promot­ing sexual promiscuity and early sexual activity." 
The Board of Education, after five months of rancorous debate, approved the condom plan Feb. 27. Some other cities are slowly following suit, but New York's program is consid­ered one of the most liberal be­cause it doesn't require visits to health clinics. 
In a separate effort Tuesday, the Gay Men's Health Crisis will give away 100,000 condoms at 34 subway stops during morn­ing and evening rush hours. 
New York City is home to about 3 percent of the nation's 13-to-21-year-olds, but ac­counts fur 20 percent of all AIDS cases in that age group. The city's school-based health clinics estimate one in four sexually active high schoolers gets a sexually transmitted dis­ease.·

Mathilde Krim, adjunct pro­fessor of public health at Columbia University and founding co-chairwoman of the American Foundation for AIDS Research,· has estimated that two of every 100 teen-agers in the city -more than 5,160 public school students -are infected with the AIDS virus. 
Each school, depending on its size, will have one or more "health resource rooms" where students from grades nine through 12 can get condoms donated by the manufacturers. 
The package will include in­structions for using the con­doms and literature on the risks and benefits of condom use and misuse. An accompanying card will instruct students that abstinence is the only sure way to avoid sexually transmitted disease. Vlasto said. 
Counseling will be optional. The state Board of Regents re­jected a last-ditch effort in October to require counseling each time a student requested a condom. City schools Chancellor Joseph Fernandez had argued that requiring counseling or parental permission would scare teens away.

Bush threatens to veto crime bill 
WASHINGTON (AP) President Bush threatened Monday to veto the anti-crime legislation heading for a final vote in Congress, accusing Democrats of producing a bill that actually would weaken law enforcement. 
Democrats who rammed the bill through a weekend House­Senate conference countered that Bush was looking for an excuse to scuttle the package because it would impos.e a waiting period for handgun purchases. The House was ex­pected to vote Monday; a Republican filibuster was pos­sible in the Senate. 
Bush said the package "is simply not acceptable" even though it would apply the fed­eral death penalty to 53 crimes, including espionage, terrorism and political assassinations. 
"So let me be clear: I would have to veto this bill because it would weaken our criminal justice system," Bush said dur­ing an appearance in Columbus, Ohio. 
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said House­Senate negotiators "basically gutted the bill in all of its meaningful provisions." 
Attorney General William Barr referred to the measure in a letter to Congress as a "so­called 'crime bill"' and argued it would "create broad new av­enues and new loopholes by which convicted criminals can exploit the system and evade punishment." 
The administration contends 
It's Ofliclal! Tammy Petak is 2I Love, Dad, Mom, 
Colleen U JuDe. 
the bill doesn't go far enough to limit habeas corpus petitions that state prisoners, particu­larly those on death row, file in federal court to appeal their sentences. 
But Sen. Joseph Bid en Jr., D­Del., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, called the veto threat "just a ploy" to block passage of the bill's five­day waiting period for handgun purchases. 
The handgun provtston known as the Brady Bill is stoutly opposed by the National Rifle Association. It is named for former White House press secretary James Brady, left disabled when he was shot in the head during a 1981 attempt to kill President Reagan. 
"They are going to the elec­tion with the right wing on their back, and the NRA," said Biden. "You look for any excuse to be able to veto the Brady Bill because you can't look at the (overall) bill and say it's soft on crime," he said. 
"It takes a real leap of imag­ination to suggest this is weak on crime," said Biden, noting that the American Civil Liberties Union strongly op­poses many of its provisions. "It looks like the only people who are unhappy are the civil libertarians and George Bush ­the ACLU and George Bush." 
House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said "it's ludicrous" for the White House to call the bill soft on crime. 
Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., chairman-of the House crime subcommittee, conceded the bill was probably dead this year, but he predicted that Bush would suffer politically if he vetoed it.

Language of Jesus may soon disappear from use 
~~ALOULA. Syria (AP) -Withm a generation, the sound of the language that Jesus spoke may fade from this mountain village, one of the world's few remaining pockets of Aramaic speakers. 
More. th.an 3,000 years old, Aramaic IS being continually absorbed by modern Arabic ­Syria's official language. .. In Maaloula, the language is 
only spoken, not written " said Palaija Sayaaf, the m'other superior of the St. Takla Greek Orthodox Convent, said to be one of the oldest hqly shrines in Christendom. 
"It's being diluted all the time. If the language of our Lord possibly the oldest in the world, is to survive," the childre~ should be formally taught it at school, she said. . The 44-year-old nun, swathed m the black robe of her order said that down through th~ centuries the language has been passed verbally from generation to generation by the people of Maaloula and two sma~l~r nearby villages, Jaba dm and Najafa. 
"I hope it will never die be­cause it's a link with the Lord Jesus and is very precious " she said. "The people her~ are proud of this tradition, of hav­mg kept the language alive all this time." . 
But she said the children, bombarded by Arabic, are mis­pronouncing the language, and there are fears that Aramaic could die within a generation or two. 
The language's survival is ~lso threatened by people drift­mg away from the mountains to the cities and beyond to America and other fara~ay lands. 
Such records as there were of Aramaic, which is closely linked t? Hebrew and Syriac, are be­lieved to have been destroyed during the French mandate from 1922 to 1946. 
The language stems from the Arameans, the forebears of the modern Syrians, nomads who settled around Damascus in the 13th Century B.C. Hundreds of years before the birth of Christ Aramaic was spoken through~ out the Middle East.

Preparing with quiet · 
When I was a child, growing up in Grand Rapids, I would look forward with great expectation to the Christmas season. Not only Christmas Day itself, but also the weeks before Christmas
I 
the time we call Advent, were filled with a sense of awe and wonder. It was a time of decorations and great preparations for a truly special day. To the eyes of a child, it seemed that, even amidst the hustle and bustle, people were generally happy. 
Upon reflection, I would have to say that the most striking moments of the Advent season were the ones we spent in Church. On any normal Sunday, my parents would become exasperated from trying to get me to pay attention, or at the very least, to quit fighting with my brothers during the readings and the homily. This, however, was not a problem during the Advent season, for I was taken in by the sense of change. 
There was a different atmosphere that was not present at any other time. I was fascinated by the Advent wreath. 1 loved the Gospel stories about the time leading up to the birth of Christ: the journey to Bethlehem by Mary and Joseph, the fact that there was no room in the Inn and so they were forced to stay in a stable. I was excited by the tales of John the Baptist proclaiming the coming of the Lord. As a child, all of this had a 
magical quality. And most importantly, I was struck by what 1 can only term a sense of joyful and prayerful quiet. 
Advent is a time for quiet reflection and preparation for that great event: the Incarnation of God in the person of Jesus Christ. Unfortunately, our schedule here at Notre Dame and 
Saint Mary's hardly gives us the time to prepare at all. 
Students are force~ t? spend their Advent cramming for exams. When exams are fm1shed, there is barely enough time to pack and get home by Christmas Eve. I have heard students state woefully that it's difficult to "get into the Christmas spirit" becau.se of such a harried schedule. Christmas can come and go With very little time spent in reflection of what it all means In fact, ~hat little t_ime we have seems to be spent in the mali, purchasmg that g1ft we never had time to buy in South Bend. 
Granted there is precious little time. However, a little time may be all that is necessary to help us experience the true meaning of Advent and Christmas. It really wouldn't be too difficult to spend five or ten minutes of quiet time a day in reflection during this Advent season. It would take only a few minutes to read through a Gospel passage such as the Annunciation of Mary or her wonderful Magnificat. It takes an hour to attend Sunday Vespers, or an Advent Reconciliation service. Sure, it is tough to find the time, but the reward is even greater. 
This Advent, we should absolutely refuse to be victims of the University schedule, and try· to work in a few moments of prayerful reflection every day. If we take some time during the Advent season to "come to the quiet," we may be better prepared to experience the abundant joy that comes with the celebration of the birth of the Christ Child. Peace on Earth!

LET IBIS TO THE EDITOR 
ND should not overlook co-ed housing as solution 
Dear Editor: 
Treachery is afoot at Notre Dame, and the villain again wears the black robe of an oli­garchical administration indif­ferent to the deep and sincere emotions of its students. The powers-that-be have issued a decree to increase their current quota of 37 percent admitted females per class to 42 or 43 percent, which is, in itself, a step in the right direction to­wards the successful consum­mation of the twenty-year-old dream of transforming Notre Dame into a coeducational uni­versity. 
Therefore, before any blood is spilt (if I'm not too late already) I would like to congratulate our reclusive leaders for their expediency and forthrightness in this matter. 
But of course, "every rose has its thorn," and the vitriolic evil associate with this decision must now be familiar to every student who calls this campus his or her "home." There have been repeated attempts by the administration to withhold this truth from the student body ­most recently in the front page article (Nov. 19) in which Vice Presi'dent for Resident Life Kirk stubbornly contends that the decision to be made, if it has not already been made, is just an "untrue rumor" -but by now we know better ·than to be taken in by the wolrs wily illu­sions. Namely, it is the dark in­tention to neuter one of South Quad's male dorms for female habitation in the 1991-92 aca­demic year. 
I suppose this transgression, though unforgivable, is at least true to the backward mentality of our administration so we can't fault them for being in­consistent. But that is where this angered student's favor ends. 
The probable temptation after 
the decision is announced will 
be a frustrated inclination to­
wards protest, which will most 
likely resemble some drunken 
diatribe by the chesen dorm 
against the administration, oc­
curring late at night around 
some repellant bonfire fueled 
by beer and other social bever­
ages. 
Or, perhaps if they are crafty, they may devise some sly re­tributive terrorist plot against the Office for Residence Life, such as a SUFResque sit-in or some other act of mischief. I am in total agreement that we must rebel against the alluring apathy so pervasive at Notre Dame so that we do not become the administration's plaything. 
These, however, are the ac­tions of common, petty, insin­cere men with a lust for battle and no real sense of purpose. Moreover, these actions will have no visible effect other than the public humiliation of the most vocal dissenters before the Office of Student Affairs, home of our maternal Dean of Discipline. 
What these bellicose males fail to realize is that if any true ac­tion is to be taken against this threat, it must be taken now, before the decision is an­nounced, so that the protest will not be perceived as an ar­rogant, selfish tantrum against the transformation of any one particular dorm, but against the central absurdity that any dorm should have its gender changed at this stage of the school's coeducational development. 
The only rational solution to this housing problem is a sim­ple one which the administra­tion hopes the student body will overlook because it flies rudely in the face of tradition and the school's confused conception of Christian morality. It does not involve the birth of another brick eyesore on this fertile concrete campus, nor does it involve the transference of an entire dorm of male students. 
Rather, I propose that the administration consider making one of the towers either Planner or Grace, co-ed by floor, according to the amount of housing required. Although this might disrupt the normal process by which students are admitted to those dorms, it would not only affect the ad­mission of freshman and would not have to involve the dis­placement of any matriculating residents. Moreover, since each of these dorms house over 700 students, only a few of the floors would be required for the housing of women. 
I realize that this is an outra­geously bold proposition for this campus, but I sincerely believe that it is the best solution to the problem for several reasons. First, it would obviously circumvent the unnecessary castration of a male dorm. 
Secondly, it would allow for a relatively minor disturbance in whatever tower would be cho­sen to house these women. And finally, it would be an important step towards making Notre Dame a genuinely coedu­cational institution through the life-learning which can only be gleaned by living under the same roof with member of the opposite sex. 
For a school which likes to consider itself among the top universities in the country, one would think that the compara­tive surveys which contribute to such a claim, which simultane­ously reveal that all other na­tional universities have co-ed dorms on their campuses, would have some effect on the leaders of this school. 
It is no longer sufficient to exclaim, "But we're Notre Dame!"; I think that the admin­istration realized that fact twenty years ago when, under the pressure of conforming to the Ivy League's initiative, they first admitted women. 
Transforming a South Quad male dorm, perhaps one with a long and celebrated tradition, into a female dorm would be a radical mastectomy for the rel­atively mild cancer the adminis­tration need to address. 
This administration now must come to terms with two facts before they make any rash de­cision which would be regret­table for all residents of this university for a long period of time. 
The first is that the male on­campus residents of this school have come to affectionately call their respective dorms "home," and I myself as a third-year of one of the dorms named for possible neutering, dread the thought of being forced to leave its warm confines so that I might be subjected to a random relocation process in which my future home and roommates may be completely unfamiliar. But it almost seems pointless to explain this concept to the ad­ministration, since the reports over the past few weeks indi­cate that such youthful days . are, for them, nothing but dis­tant, faded memories. 
The second fact is that they now have before them a unique opportunity to wonderfully transform the undergraduate identity of Notre Dame forever into a beautiful blossom of lib­erated tensions and thoughtful expressions between the sexes. 
It is therefore my dual hope that the students of Notre Dame will take up arms to combat their inherent apathy, and that the administration will take this letter seriously and act accordingly to complete the noble endeavor of transforming Notre Dame into a truly coedu­cational university.

Dear Editor: 
There exists today what an anthropologist at Western Michigan University has dubbed the Ne\v Indian Ring: a loose coalition of Indian activists, church groups, academics, en­vironmentalists, and assorted New Agers, all bound by a common worldview and politi­cal agenda. Professor A L. Soen's recent letter (The Observer, Nov. 14) bears similar views to those held by this coalition. 
White members of the NIR are penitents, dedicated to "discovering and denouncing the depravity of their ances­tors," as Judge Richard Nichols has described it. In salient con­trast is their version of tradi­tional Indian lives and cultures, which often borders on hagiog­raphy. This dualism is not to be questioned, and those who do so will find themselves labeled as culturally insensitive, if not as racists. 
Typical of NIR misinformation is Soens' claim that the federal government "unilaterally broke[n]" the great majority of Indian treaties. Soens is as wrong about that assertion as he is about the number of these treaties: there were 374 of them, not 305 as he states. Evidence exists to show that a handful of treaties were broken; none exists to show that many were. 
Certainly as conquering goes, treaty-making is highly civilized and should not be a source of shame for those whose ances­tors undertook it. Indian tribes who coveted other tribes' terri­tory generally employed the rape, pillage and plunder method of conquering most common in human history. 
For many reasons, some of them ethical, Anglo-Americans did not usually choose ·to deal with the Indians so barbarously. American travesties of justice against the aboriginal popula­tion, e.g., the Trail of Tears, stand out precisely because they are aberrations that shock our Western conscience. 
Some tribes viewed treaties very favorably and entered into dozens of them with the U.S. government over a period of a century (and with the British before there was a U.S.), and several actually initiated the treaty-making process. Many tribal leaders dickered shrewdly and held out tena­ciously for acceptable treaty terms, occasionally forcing fed­eral negotiators back to Washington for permission to cave in on this or that. Such tough negotiating would have been inexplicably stupid in its futility if, as Soens charges, the 
U.S. had been regularly violat­ing its treaty obligations. 
Interestingly, the federal gov­ernment sometimes insisted on stipulations requiring the Indian signatories to cease making war on other tribes. That the Indians did not always keep these promis'es makes them no worse, but also no bet­ter, than white humanity-both in terms of treaty breaching and aggression. 
Many people do not under­stand that the great majority of treaties are moot, comprised of term-specific schedules for payment in cash or kind that, with rare exception, were ful­filled more than a century ago. Both the claimed inequities of some treaties. and the fact that a few really were secured through fraud were resolved by the Indian Claims Commission after World War II. 
The settlements awarded by the ICC were understood by the Indians and their attorneys as final under the legal doctrine of res judicata. Nevertheless, for the last 20 years judges in many states have been infusing new life into dead treaties by granting various tribes valuable resource, hunting, and fishing rights on publicly and privately owned land. Many states must then negotiate with the tribes to buy back the right to control territory heretofore thought to have become theirs by the granting of statehood. 
Truly, until one has read an 18th or 19th century Indian treaty and then considered what a modern judge has im­puted to it, one does not fully comprehend the mischief poten­tial for judicial activism. The difficulty many might have imagining that signatories in­tended treaties as anything re­motely like the multi-million dollar, tax-payer funded bo­nanza they have become is sim­ply not a problem for a creative jurist guided by the desire to do something ..nice" for Indians. 
Of course, when the average. 
middle-class American objects to, say the threat that his real estate title has been clouded by these judicial decisions, the NIR intellectual elite labels him or her as a racist. However, the NIR is particularly venomous towards Indians who challenge treaty flim-flam; dehumanizing epithets such as Uncle Tomahawk and Apple Indian are commonly used to describe such persons. (Soens prefers Quisling.) 
These Indians have, as Soens puts it, been "co-opted." This co-opting notion is popular with the NIR, though exactly who plans and executes this ne­farious activity is pretty much left to conjecture. (One NIR conspiracy theorist has sug­gested it could be Exxon.) I and many Indians find such mean­spirited nonsense far more offensive than well-intentioned baseball fans chopping the air with tomahawks. 
It seems that the more im­plausible and erroneous the claim, the nastier are its advo­cates. If sarcasm is the weapon of a weak argument, viciousness thoroughly indicts it. Certainly Soen's over­wrought vitriol directed against those with whom he disagrees is inversely proportional to the factual basis for his assertions.

Wilber, left, and Mercedes relax in Mercedes' South Bend home. 
Meet Wilber and Mercedes 

Wake Up I Look Out 

Editor·s note: This is the third in a series of occasional articles on the lives and perceptions of people in the community but not a part of the ·Notre Dame Family. ,. 
By JOE MOODY Viewpoint Editor 
"According to what one person told me, I'm illiterate and uneducated," explained Mercedes with a sparkle in her eye standing before her antique book shelves. 
Mercedes didn't listen to what that one person told her as evident by her home which is a virtual library. The books, which she continues to study and read, date all the way back to the nineteenth century. 
When not occupied with her paper route or the small shoe shop she owns, Mercedes reads, draws, writes and spends time with her best friend, Wilber. 
"She's my charm in life," Wilber said of Mercedes sitting next to her blowing a few brassy blue notes from his harmonica into the dust-filled air. "But she don't know like I know," he smiled. 
The first impression Mercedes and Wilber had of the world came with the Great Depression. Since then, they have watched a modern society explode and move at a speed unparalleled in human history. All the while, they have managed to struggle by and dance to 
"'ne has to experience things to know them," says Mercedes. 
Two true non-conformists tell their tale 
the beat of their own drum. 
"Not everybody can live in this expensive world," Mercedes exclaimed with genuine concern in her face. 
"They say that now everybody gets more money than in the old days. But ahh, that isn't always so. That's why you see people out on the street. . . and I could tell you something about that." 
So could Wilber. On his sixteenth birthday, Wilber's father forced him to enter this wide world on his own. 
"Father set my clothes out on the porch and he told me, 'You've got to make your own way.' So I went anywhere I could find warmth. It was the night of my birthday, November 4th. It was very cold." He ended up spending most of his time hanging out in a pool hall and at the YMCA. Wilber's mother had died eleven years before. 
Mercedes managed to graduate high school but could not afford to enter college. Wilber only made it through the eighth grade. 
"The teacher got me in a corner," recounted Wilber through his thick, grey beard. He told me to do something and I said, 'Oh I don't have to.'" 
The teacher then dragged Wilber out of his seat and paddled him over forty times in front of the class. "I took my books and walked out the door," Wilber said with a hard glare. That was the last memory Wilber had of formal edu­cation. 
Neither Wilber nor Mercedes have let lack of funds or schooling stop them from pursuing their dreams which have included world travel and acquiring a sizable collection of antiques and literature. "You would be surprised at some of the things people throw away," laughed Mercedes. 
The following is an interview con­ducted with Mercedes and Wilber on November 16, 1991: 
What would you study if you now attended Notre Dame? Mercedes: "Architecture and 
Wilber: "I would study people." 
What have been your goals in life? 
Mercedes: "To go to Europe and have my own home." Wilber: "To be able to pay my bills and have enough money to live on." 
Mercedes: "We both believe in not owing anybody anything. And we never get anything unless we can pay for it." 
Mercedes, what do you think about the homeless problem? 
Mercedes: "It's true that a lot of people are on the street because they have no goals in life. Or they drink and use drugs. But a lot of people are there because they could not keep up with the pace." 
When you say •pace.' I assume you mean the technology and all the demands it places on one to live in it. Wilber, how do you feel about twentieth century technology? 
Wilber: "They're going to go into space whether people want 'em to or not. And if I had my way, I'd fly right up there with 'em.'' 
Does society give everyone an equal chance to succeed? 
Mercedes: "Not altogether. Society does limit a person. You can fight but you have to fight very hard. People hold you back saying 'You don't have money. You don't have education.' And if you still manage to struggle, they look down on you." 
Wilber, what do you two think about religion? Wilber: "There is nothing more powerful than God Almighty." 
I you two could say one thing to the Notre Dame community, what would you say? 
Mercedes: My high school teacher had a phrase, 'Education is the lubrication that takes the squeak out of living." 
Wilber (squinting his eyes and searching his mind): 
"An old 11liln going on a lone highway 
Stopped in the evening, cold and grey 
He come to a chasm, vast and wide 
He stopped to build a bridge to span the tide 
'Old man,' said afellow pilgrim near 
Your wasting your strength with your building here 
The builder looked at his old grey head 
'This very path I come,' he said 
'A fair headed youth must pass this way 
This chasm, it may not be to me 
But to that fair headed youth may pitfall be 
He too must cross in the twilight dim 
Good friend, I'm building this bridge for him."' 
Wilber never learned to read or write but had his knowledge passed down orally and cultivated in his mind freely. Along with knowing countless poems by heart, he's a self-taught musician who plays the piano, harmonica and a little guitar. 
"I study by mind," said Wilber. "When I play the piano, I play by my mind. Somebody might show me the way to play but I can't go the way they want me to go. I go the way my mind tells me to go," he quietly explained. 
The fashions worn by Mercedes and Wilber are dictated neither by California nor New York. They don't worry about Arab embargoes because they don't drive. Interest rates do not bother them because they own what they have. 
They are self-reliant. At least as much as they can try to be in such a lock-tight, electric society. 
"You know one time there was a television program and there was an actor, Art Carney," reflected Mercedes. 
"He was supposed to be an old man and his grandson wanted him to go to college with him. So they went to col­lege. 
"And in the history class, the teacher said to read some pages out of a history book and answer the questions at the end. Well, the old man didn't like what he read. He was poor-dirt poor-as a young man. 
"And the teacher said to the old man, [after reading his answers] 'This wasn't in the book.' And the old man said, 'No, because they didn't experience it. What they wrote is what they heard from others. I was there. I know how it was' 
"The teacher then wanted to banish him from the class," concluded Mercedes. 
~~~ 
"A person has to be his own self," says Wilber.

esc and undergraduate colleges sponsor new alumni enrichment program 
By MEREDITH MCCULLOUGH Accent Writer 
Rumor has it that once stu­dents graduate from Notre Dame they take on new person­alities. 
Plaid pants. Season tickets. Tattoos of the Golden Dome. 
An instant transformation into the revered, the feared, the infamous Notre Dame alumni who terrorize the campus during horne football weekends. 
But the Center for Social Concerns {CSC) has joined forces with the four undergraduate colleges to dispel these stereotypes. Together they are introducing a program illustrating that there is life be­yond Notre Dame. Life in plaid pants. 
As part of its celebration of the sesquicentennial, the esc has developed an alumni enrichment program to give students the opportunity to meet with graduates from their respective departments, according to Kathleen Weigert, faculty liaison and academic advisor at the Center. 
"We believe that these return­ing alumnilae will help highlight the University's commitment to values and to issues of social concerns throughout its history," she said. 
Weigert explained that the alumni will speak in classes and discuss with students "how they integrate into into-.,their careers in particular and into their lives overall, the values and copeten­cies they learned while at Notre Dame." 
"What we are trying to ac­complish is to let undergradu­ates know that incorporating social concerns into one's daily life is not only possible and practical but is also actually being done-with many ques­tions, joys, and struggles," she said. 
Each alum will participate in two sections of the program, according to Weigert. 
First, the alumni will visit a variety of classrooms ·to "share reflections ... about what they learned while undergraduates at Notre Dame," she said. During this class time, the students will have time to ask questions. 
Second, the faculty and un­dergraduates are encouraged to meet more informally with alumni from their field, said Weigert. 
The Center invited alumni based on suggestions made by members of the Notre Dame community and questionnaires sent to possible visitors, ac­cording to Weigert. 
"We hope{d) to invite a range of people (in age, occupation, marital status, etc.) to partici­pate in the project," she ex­plained. 
Daniel LeDuc, a 1983 alum with a degree in American Studies, will be the first return­ing graduate to take part in the program. 
LeDuc, who currently works for The Philadelphia Inquirer, will be at Notre Dame Monday, Dec. 2 and Tuesday, Dec. 3. : 
•Monday 
from 11-12:15 p.m. he will visit the Broadcast Journalism classroom (WNDU Stations) to discuss "Print and Television News-Strengths, Weaknesses, Ethical Issues." 

•Monday

U2's Achtung Baby lifts band to new level 
By ROLANDO DE AGUIAR Music Critic 
After three years of silence, one of corporate rock's most influential and outspoken bands has made its latest statement. 
With Achtung Baby, U2 has shed the last remnants of its archaic rocker image, replacing it with a hipper, more eccentric fa~ade. However, the band goes beyond superficial changes by delivering a crushing blow to the longbox, the music industry's biggest environmental faux pas of the 1980s. 
U2 has taken several new directions with Achtung Baby. The most predominant of these is an effort to destroy the apparently mindless and hollow world of dance music. 
The sound of "The Fly," the first single from the album, is more dance-oriented than anything else the band has attempted. And after the shock of Bono's voice being coupled with EMF­like guitars has worn off, the song gains respectability. 
Rhythm is similarly important in the second single, "Mysterious Ways." Like so many U2 songs, this track leaves the listener thinking about both the earthly and ethereal worlds. 
The album's opening track, "Zoo Station," gives the listener a preview of the changes that have taken place in the band's music. A peculiar filter over Bono's vocals, coupled with intentional distortion of bass sounds, are studio

tricks typical of the new U2. 
After this song, Achtung Baby never relinquishes its bass-driven hold on the listener, pounding track after track of quality through the woofers. 
The band has again made a departure from the sound which brought its greatest glory, but has again succeeded in making high-powered, exciting music. 
Today's U2 has blended the introspection of The Joshua Tree with the beat of the club scene, and has produced a typically superb album. 
However, the change in U2's music is a small step compared to the revolution which will likely result in compact disc packaging after the release of Achtung Baby. 
Released in two packages, Achtung Baby's compact disc gives the consumer the ability to choose the CD packaging of the future. 
The first of these, the AlphaPak, allows the familiar and ·appreciated plastic jewel box to survive. Similar to anti-theft cassette packaging found in most chain record stores, the AlphaPak has been criticized by independent CD vendors because of its expense. However, the idea is lauded by consumers who enjoy the familiar

Giants bitten by injury bug as Hostetler and L.T. fall 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -Jeff Hostetler will miss at least two games after breaking three small bones in his back, but the diagnosis for Lawrence Taylor remained un­clear Monday. 
Taylor, the Pro Bowl linebacker who in 11 seasons has missed just one game due to injury, was scheduled to un­dergo testing on his sprained left knee Monday night. 
The injuries occurred on what has become Black Sunday for the Super Bowl champions. In their 21-14 victory over Tampa Bay, the Giants' injury count totaled four starters, with of­fensive tackle Doug Riesenberg and cornerback Mark Collins also being knocked out of the game. 
On Monday, the Giants said Hostetler broke the second, third and fourth lumbar trans­verse processes when tackled by Broderick Thomas in the third quarter. On Sunday, the team said Hostetler broke only the third lumbar transverse process. 
Giants coach Ray Handley, who walked out of his weekly news conference Monday when asked to discuss the quarter­back situation now that veteran Phil Simms has stepped in for Hostetler, reiterated that Hostetler suffered no neurolog­ical damage. 
"Basically it's soft tissue around there," Handley said, referring to the transverse pro­cesses -little bones that stick out of vertebrae to which mus­cle attaches. "There is no threat of anything permanent or disabling. 
"It is very painful. He didn't sleep much last night and he'll be in the hospital a couple of days." 
Hostetler remained in a Tampa hospital Monday and it was unclear· when he would be released. The Giants have made plans to have him flown home once he receives medical clear­ance. 
"He won't be written off for the year," Handley said. "It doesn't look like an IR situation. It will be several weeks, though. Other than that I can't tell you much more." 
Taylor is another story. 
He was injured early in the second quarter when, pursuing a running play, he was blocked by guard Ian Beckles. 
"The doctors, partially be­cause it's L.T., can't tell me how long it's going to be," Handley said. "L.T. usually comes back in significantly I8ss time than anyone else with the same injury." 
The injury was diagnosed as a moderate sprain of the medial collateral ligament by Dr. Allan Levy, the Giants' associate team physician. 
"Let's put it this way, nobody should play on it this week," Levy said. "But with him, you never know." 
Taylor has a history of defying medical opinion. 
Earlier this year, Taylor tore ligaments in his left thumb and played the following week. A cracked bone in his foot and a severe shoulder injury also failed to sideline him during the 1989 and 1988 seasons. The only game he missed was in 1987 as a result of a hamstring injury. 
.Taylor arrived at Giants Stadium for treatment Monday but declined to discuss his in­jury. 
The Giants will list Taylor as doubtful for Sunday's game against Cincinnati. Second year pro Bobby Abrams would re­place him. 
Riesenberg has a sprained right ankle and Collins has a rib injury. Both are questionable for Sunday. 
Simms, who suffered a foot injury late last season and was replaced by Hostetler, rallied the Giants to victory on Sunday, hitting Stephen Baker with a 30-yard touchdown pass with 16 seconds left. Hostetler was given the starting job over Simms this season by Handley, who replaced Bill Parcells this _, season.

"I couldn't have withstood the training if the doctors didn't give me goals to work for," Wood said. "But I knew I could come back and they encouraged me by saying how much stronger I would be.Tim (Welsh) and I discussed not swimming my senior year. It turned out to be a good idea." 
The setback also helped her put things in perspective. While rehabilitating, she fulfilled her urge to compete with the Irish swim team by avidly covering the sport for the Observer. 
"Becky is both a good model for the program and a tremen­dous resource for her younger teammates," said Welsh. "Becky's role is not only to per­form well for us in the water, 
but to provide stability and 
wisdom as well." 
This past weekend at Illinois, she set personal best times for the 50, 100 and 200-meter breaststroke. 
Wood now has some unfinished business to do. 
"I don't feel I've reached my potential. That's the whole reason I returned this year," she said. 
The Irish will be defending their National Catholic crown next weekend in Boston. At the meet two years ago. Wood was just two seconds short of quali­fying for the NCAA's in both the 100 and 200. The following week she peaked, achieving the qualifying time (2:19.16) in the 200 at home against St. Mary's. 
Welsh believes Wood has fi­nally arrived at the form she displayed her sophomore year.

Special to The Observer 
On December 28 Notre 
Dame representatives will 
receive the 1991 CFA 
Academic Achievement 
Award recogmzmg the 
university with the highest 
graduation rate of football 
players among member 
institutions. 
This year marks the fifth time in the 11 years the award has been presented that the Irish have been the recipients. Twenty-four of the 26 football-playing student­athletes who entered the University in 1985 graduated for a mark of 92.3 percent. 
Mike DeCicco, academic advisor emeritus, was awarded the CFA Athletic Academic Advisor Award. In the four years the CFA has granted this award, DeCicco has won it twice, recognizing his efforts in helping Irish players work towards earning their degrees. 
Notre Dame was one of 56 schools that supplied the CFA with information used in the survey, based on student-ath­letes entering their respective institutions in 1985. 
Thirteen other schools re­ceived honorable mention recognition for graduating at least 70 percent of their stu­dent-athletes. Boston College, Duke, Hawaii, Kentucky, North Carolina, Penn State, Rice, Rutgers, Syracuse, Tennessee, Vanderbilt, Virginia and Wake Forest. 
The award, established in 1981, is awarded annually by the Touchdown Club of Memphis. It will be presented at the Liberty Bowl Luncheon in Memphis, Tenn.

Equestrian club fares well 
By JONATHAN JENSEN 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame/Saint Mary's Equestrian Club turned a few heads with an impressive performance in the Ball State Intercollegiate Horse Show on November 15-17. 
"This was the best show we've had," said Jennifer Strasser, president of the ND/SMC Equestrian Club, "Definitely this year and maybe even last year." 
The show consisted of two competitions, the Western competition on Friday and the English on Saturday and Sunday. 
Eric Ivanovich, the treasurer of the club, placed fourth and second in the respective competitions in the Advanced I Stock division. These feats are extremely impressive considering this was the first time Ivanovich has competed in the Advanced division. He qualified for regionals and moved up from the Intermediate division just the meet before. 
"Eric rode really well," said Strasser. "We were pretty im­pressed with him." 
The club also got sparkling performances from newcomers Megan Turpin, Julie Barry and Larissa Wenning in their first Intercollegiate Horse Show. 
Barry swept the Walk-Trot division, finishing first in both the Western and English com­petitions. 
On Friday, Turpin finished second in the Novice Flat divi­sion and first in the Novice Fences which made her the Reserve Champion in her first show on Friday. She then turned in sixth and third place finishes in the same divisions during the English competition. 
Wenning turned in the club's fourth first-place finish in the Beginning Walk-Trot Canter. 
"We had a lot of people in their first horse show," noted Strasser, who herself finished fifth in the Advanced Walk­Trot Canter division. ''I'm hoping the rest of the season will go really well."

provide. 
And speaking of national title implications, what about the real possibility of another split championship? With the present situation, we'll never really know who's deserving of the title, because Washington and Michigan are committed to the Rose Bowl, while Miami is in the Orange and Florida in the Sugar. 
So here's an idea for this year, at least. Should Washington and Miami win respectively January 1st, let's have a winne.r-take-all matchup two weeks later. Both teams are dying for the chance to take the other on, and it would settle the debate on which team is truly number one. 
I can hear the complaints already: this will cut into the athletes' academic schedule; it's only for the money; it downplays the significance of the bowls. 
But since the game would take place around January 11

gether in the second half," he concluded. 
In the confrontation against Calvin College, Saint Mary's was doomed by a first-half stretch in which it hit only one of ten shots. Calvin used this to come out on top. 
"We were ahead by five, but then stopped playing, stood around and watched the rest of the game," stated Cromer. "We have to put this behind us and begin playing how we practice." 
Against Calvin, senior co­captain Janet Libbing led the team with 23 points and four three-pointers, in addition to 10 rebounds; junior Julie Snyder and senior Kim Holmes contributed 14 and 12 points respectively. Co-captain Catherine Restovich came through with two three-point­ers as well as six rebounds.

the players would still be on Christmas vacation, thus not missing much if any class time. 
And to quiet concerns that this is only a money-making ploy by the schools and the NCAA, all proceeds can go to charity, after giving the universities a reasonable payout. Let's be realistic-the schools would have to get a cut, but if we keep it in the $1­$2 million range, there will be plenty left over to give to a charitable organization. 
The Shrine All-Star Game in Palo Alto, Cal., in its 67th year of existence, has raised hundreds of millions of dollars for Shriners Children's Hospitals around the country. Considering all the attention, corporate sponsorship and television ratings a true national championship game would draw, the Miami­Washington matchup should generate ample proceeds for whatever charity the two teams decide on. 
Finally, for all those who worry about the poor, 
defenseless bowls, the bowls' significance diminished years ago, when it became obvious that rather than provide the best matchup possible, they went for the best money­making game possible. 
All this wouldn't solve the ultimate dilemma of whether there should be a national playoff or not. Clearly, the poor judgment the bowls have made the past few years have made the question of a playoff not a question of whether or not to employ one, but rather a question of when it will occur. 
And yes, should either Miami or Washington fall from now until January 1, the whole debate becomes moot. Or if both teams should lose, a new debate would be waged. 
But what if? A Hurricane­Husky game may be in the making for next August (the Kickoff Classic is reportedly c_onsidering signing the two teams), but why should fans have to wait until then? 
Because the men in the multi­colored suits said so.

Bowl reps have too much power 
The men in the multi-colored suits have--------­spoken. 
What they've said is, "Let's have a playoff system for Division I football." 
Those men in the ugly suits are the bowl representatives who have been haunting college press boxes since mid-October, trying to find that perfect matchup (read: two teams with a reputation and lots of 
Rene Ferran 
eager fans) for their holiday extravaganzas. 
Out of Bounds 
For instance, Illinois is heading for the 
John Hancock Bowl-which of course used________ to be the Sun Bowl, but for enough bucks, you too can have a bowl game named after you. The Illini, who have lost four of their last six games, crawl into El Paso, Texas, with a 6-5 record. How about Arkansas? The Razorbacks also fashioned a 6-5 record against the likes of SMU, Southwest Louisiana and Rice. Only one of their victories, a 22-21 win over TCU (7-4) back on October 5, came against a team with a winning record . However, since Shreveport, La., host city for the Poulan-Weed Eater Independence Bowl-would you make up a name like that?-is home to the third-largest contingent of Arkansas alums (according to ESPN); the Razor backs are heading to a bowl. At the same time, teams like TCU, Kansas State (7 -4), North Carolina (7-4) and Utah (7-5) stay home. Finally, let's just look at our own case. It's not that Notre Dame doesn't deserve to be heading to a bowl game, but don't you think Sugar Bowl officials are kicking themselves right now for having committed to the Irish a bit prematurely. The natural Miami-Florida matchup was still a definite possibility when they made their decision. Now,' should Florida lose Saturday to Florida State, the potential ratings gain ABC expected from having Notre Dame in the Sugar could be lost. Assuming Miami gets by San Diego State, the Orange Bowl once again will have national title implications. neutralizing the natural ratings draw the Irish
