~==~======International Qu~ke hits 7.2 on scale 
BUCHAREST, RQmania (AP)-At least 600 deaths were reported yesterday in shattered Bucharest and areas of Romania and Bulgaria hit by the latest of a series of deadly earthquakes in southern Europe. 
The government said Friday night's massive quake, 7.2 on the Richter scale, was known to have killed 580 people in Romania, including 508 in Bucharest alone, and injured 3,214. Western diplomats said American medical students helping in hospitals estimated as many as 3,000 might have been killed in the disaster, which rocked Europe from Rome to Moscow Friday night. 

Communists-Sodalists unite 
GRENOBLE, France (AP)-The Communist party will move into the city council of one of France's best-managed and most attractive communities in nationwide municipal elections next Sunday without having to gather a single new vote. 
Their easy ·victory comes from the Communist's alliance with the Socialist party and anagreementto establish a single left-wing slate of candidates. On the national scale, the agreement holds in 204 big cities, with the Socialists occasionally being given a free ride into office in a Communist fief such as LeHavre. 
But the single slate essentially benefits the Communists, and in a place like Grenoble, it is little else than a giveaway of power. The Socialist party, in total control of the city for the last 12 years, offered the Communists 16 city council candidacies to 22 for itself on the united left ticket.

Urban poverty is target 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Secretary Juanita Kreps says the Commerce Department is strengthening its efforts to revive sagging local economies that have left thousands out of work in the nation's older cities and towns. 
Until recently, the department has had little role in the war on urban poverty, and Kreps' pledge to enter the fray may signal Carter administration efforts to stimulate private investment in the cities. 
"No statistical trick can hide the fact that structural unemploy­ment low incomes and small-business failures have been heavily conc~ntrated in the older cities and towns," Krei)ssaid yesterday.

Amin seeks good relations 
KAMPALA, Uganda [AP] -U­ganda's President Idi Amin said yesterday he would like the United States to reopen its embassy in Kampala and he predicted that one day President Carter will be "one of my best friends." 
In his first interview with U.S. correspondents since the war of nerves over the 240-person Ameri­can community in this East African nation, Amin asserted it never had been his intention to hold the Americans hostage. 
The Ugandan leader met with correspondents from The Associat­ed Press, CBS and NBC at the presidential lodge. 
He wore a blue track suit top and white shorts after an afternoon of basketball in which his hand-picked team trounced another from the armed forces and civil service. Amin, 6-feet-4, dwarfed the othet players and scored most of his team's baskets. 
Amin said fears raised for the safety of the Americans after he issued orders to them Feb. 25 not to leave the country until he met with them was a misunderstand­ing. He said it stemmed partly from what he called Carter's lack of knowledge about Africa. 
The crisis was defused after Amin cancelled a meeting with the American community and lifted his travel ban. 
The president stressed that he wants good relations with the

United States and said he would like to see the U.S. Embassy in _Kampala reopened as well as more Americans working in Uganda. The embassy was closed in 1973 in a dispute over its Marine guards, but the United Sates has not broken diplomatic relations with Kampala. 
Despite his conciliatory attitude toward the United States, Amin repeated his charge that some 2,600 mercenaries, working in co­
. operation with the U.S. Navy's Indian Ocean fleet and the Kenyan regular army, are "coming towards Uganda's borders." He said that although Uganda wants good relations with all its neighbors, "it is still capable of defending itself." Among other points made by

mores in the years 1961, 1971, and 1976, using a 124-item question­naire. "They (respondents from all groups) agreed on two-thirds of all the item -re_sponses for the entire inventory," Prof. Fargen said in a preliminary report. "This fact raises a question about whether these classes were really as differ­ent as students were often made out to be,'·' he added. 
When contrasts were evident in the survey, they were with the 1971 sophomores. The greatest differ­ences were between either the 1961 sophomores and their counterparts 10 years later or the 1971 sopho­mores and their counter parts five years later. The 1961 sophomores were surveyed about the time of the inauguration of president John 
F. Kennedy. The 1971 research coincided with the beginning of non-violence and less severe pro­testing on campuses, and the 1976 data were collected after the elec­tion of Jimmy Carter., 
Sections of the research instru­ment included family telations, outlook on life and the future, evaluation of education in general and Notre Dame in particular, and attitudes toward the economic and legal systems. 
ln questions about their own University, 1976 sophomores gave it the highest rating, 1961 sopho­mores were next, and 1971 sopho­mores last. Residentiality drew the strongest favorable assertion from all three groups, and the influence of coeducation, which arrived in 1972, could be seen in the turn­around in evaluation of social and recreational activities between the sophomores of 1971 and of 1976.

Pennsylvania coal miner escapes death trap 
TOWER CITY, Pa. [AP] -Ronald Adley, a feisty coal miner trapped deep inside a mountain for the longest five days of his life, squirmed to freedom yesterday and was taken to a hospital in good health. 
Several hours later the bodies of two more coal miners were located, bringing to four the number killed by the underground flood that trapped Adley last Tuesday. 
Five more miners remained missing. Efforts to locate them continued but no new signs of life were reported. 
"Pass that jackhammer over to me," Adley comanded as his rescuers burst through the last inches of a SO-foot wall of coal and quartz that had served as his prison door. 
Then the 37-year-old miner put the finishing touches on a shoulder­wide escape tunnel and wiggled his five-foot-seven frame through. He thanked his rescuers with slaps on the back and a few jokes. · 
It had taken them 108 hours to reach him. He cut some of the boredom by chewing tobacco pass­ed to him by rescuers. But when 
. · he had asked him for whiskey, they gave him only orange juice. Turning down an offer to ride on a stretcher the mile to the mine's mouth, Adley barked: "Hell no. I 
want to walk.'' 
When he reached the sunlight he turned down an offer of sunglasses to cut the sudden glare. 
''Adley is mentally alert and physically in good shape. He has several small abrasions on his forehead, legs and arms," said James Kirk, administrators of Pottsville Hospital where the miner was examined and admitted for observation. 
Adley and other miners were trapped ~tt midday Tuesday be­neath 400-foot-high Big Lick Moun­tain when a wall of ice-cold water crashed through a shaft ceiling, battering support timbers and trig­gering rock slides. Two bodies were found by late Wednesday. Three miners who escaped were injured. 
Walter J. Vincinelly, state com­missioner of deep mine safety, said there were no signs of other life in the 10-foot wide, 10-foot high chamber where Adley and the two bodies found yesterday had been. 
Two teams of four men each continued to search the area, which penetrates an unknown distance into a black hole. But it was only one of several sealed-off ·chutes in which other miners might be. 
After Adley's rescue, workers fell silent so three dynamite blasts could be set off to simulate a miner's distress signal and perhaps evoke a response from anyone trapped. Sensitive instruments detected nothing. 
Meanwhile, efforts proceeded to dig 43S feet into another area of the mine so television cameras and microphones could be lowered. 
After they reached him, Adley's rescuers escorted him 1,000 feet to a waiting shuttle car that ferried him another 4,000 feet to the surface. 
"The first thing he said when he got in was that he was afraid of getting the ambulance dirty," said Zerbe, the ambulance attendant. "I said, don't let it worry you:" 
Adley had been trapped for 32 hours before his efforts to tap out a message that he was alive were detected. A supply hole was driiied to his chamber and the efforts to cut a larger tunnel througli began. 
"He's alert and well oriented," said Dr. Leon Scicchitano, director of the surgery staff at Pottsville Hospital. "We plan to keep him under observation for between 24 and 36 hours." 
The Kocher Coal Co. mine, honeycombed with abandoned shafts that over the years have trapped pockets of rain water, is located in Schuylkill County over Pennsylvania's major anthracite field 40 miles northeast of 
In Business College 
Dean Ryan announces changes 
by Diane Wllson 

In an effort to "redistribute the 
manpower with the College of 
Business Administration" some 
administrative changes arP. due to 
take place soon, according to 
Brother Leo Ryan, Dean of the 
College. 
Dr. Yasaka Furuhashi, professor 
of marketing and former acting 
dean of Business Administraiton, 
will become associate dean for 
faculity development and curricu­
lum for undergraduate and gradu­.-ate students on June 1, 1977. 
Vincent R. Raymond, associate 
dean of the College since 1973, wiii 
continue in that role with responsi­
bility for student personnel and 
administrative services for both 
undergraduate and graduate 
students. · 
Dr. John R. Malone, associate· 
dean of the College of Business 
Administration will leave his ad­
ministrative position and return to 
teaching as a professor of market­
ing on May 31, 1977. Dr. Frank 
Yeandell, assistant dean of the 
College of Business Administra­
tion, will be joining the faculty at 
St. Mary's College where he will be 
assosiate professor of business and 
economics effective on Aug. 30, 
1977. 
· Reasonforchange 
Ace._, :·ding to Ryan, there are three purposes of these changes. One is to consolidate and join the administrative offices for graduate and undergraduate business ma­Jors into one unit covering both. A third purpose is to extend the scope of the associate deans so that each is respqnsible for the entire College rather than just one section of it, either the graduate or undergra­duate students. 
Presently, Raymond is respon­sible for undergraduates and Malone is responsible for graduate students in business. The way the new administration will be set up, each associate dean will have certain responsibilities for the en­tire college. · 
The administration conceives the college as a total operation. There is no graduate and undergraduate faculty so it makes more sense to have the administration cover the entire college rather than divide it between the graduat and under­graduate students. 
The College of Business is working on a major evaulation of the college and all the departments in it. When the evaulation is completed new requirements for the college and the departments will be recommended. There are no course changes slated for 1977­78 school year, but the study will be completed during that year and there will be a major shift within the college and within each department. 
Some things the evaluation is investigating include the structure of the sophomore year (the sopho­more year is filled with required intro business courses), the role of the computer for business courses, the role of statistics and applied statistics(BA graduates arerequired to have 6 hours of statistics), and the necessity of a 'cap-up' course at the end of the program connecting all of the · things the business graduate has learned in the college. 
Also being evaluated are the communication skills business ma­jors have and how they should be improved, the role of business in government relations, the need of an international curriculum for our "domestic economy in an interde­pendent world,'' and· the question ofvaluesin "business in society." 
The answers to these questions and many more will all be compiled next February and new curriculum and college requirements will be ready for the 1978-79 school year. All SS faculty members of the college will be working on the evaulation. They are all experts in the areas of business, not just in their specified field. 
According to Ryan, this will cause the evaluation to take longer .but will give better results as each professor is concerned with the entire college and not just his department. 
Overcrowding stiU a problem 
Another concern of the college is the crowding within the college. Ryan explained some experiments going on within the sophomore year in statistics. There are presently large sections with tutor­ials for problems. They will do the same thing with the statistics classes next year for an accurate appraisal of the system. 
Ryan said the collge was also working on not having to have all the sophomore courses large. They are also trying to revise the faculty to teach at the junior and senior level new courses and to have the senior courses smuller in number. 
There are three important rea­

Maintenance lists damage in dorms 'not excessive' 
by Mark Perry 

The amount of damage and vandalism in the dormitories has not been excessive so far this year, according to Edwin Lyon, director of maintenance at Notre Dame. 
Although he was unable to give specific figures at this time, Lyon stated "except for a couple of wild weekends last fall, over-all the students have been good to us this year." 
Lyon noted that some hall dam­age is expected each year, and commented ''We would allow for a certain amount of damage because of horseplay, but it's the malicious intentional vandalism that bothers us." 
He listed Planner and Grace· Halls as examples of this malicious vandalism, where the elevators are constantly being damaged by peo­ple covering the walls with graffiti. Lyon recalled one year when the elevators had to be painted four times because of this damage. 
Lyon said there was really no 
specific time where damage to halls was more prevalent, but noted that 'exam week was when students 
were more apt to cause uninten-. 
tiona] damage because of exam 
pressure. He also stated that 
damage was definitely more com­
mon in mens' dorms. 
In general, Lyon said students 
have been much better in the 
1970's than in the 1960's. 
Alf the hall rectors questioned 
also commended the students on 
their behavior this year. Sally 
Duffy, rector of Lewis Hall said most 
vandalism has been restricted 
mainly to tearing of wallpaper 
along the stairwells and other 
minor damage. When asked if she 
thought any of the dama,ge might 
be cause by parties in the hall, 
Duffy said that the girls for the 
most part have kept the parties 
very well organized. 
Br. Benesh of Alumni also said 
that he didn't know of any damage 
in the hall caused by people at 
parties in Alumni.

Retain Danehy
Prompted by the University's retirement 
of Prof. James P. Danehy, we examined, in Friday's editorial, Notre Dame's nebulous definition of tenure, and the manner in which this definition may be applied (at the administration's discretion) either to retire or re(ain professors once they reach 65. We concluded that the current system may not last much longer, in view of the animosity that exists between Notre Dame's faculty and administration. 
In this editorial, we tum to the mdividual case of Prof. Danehy. Whatever the general retirement rules, he deserves to go on teaching. 
By his own definition, Dr. Danehy'sprimary job as a Professor of Chemistry is to teach Organic Chemistry to Notre Dame's pre-med and science students. This course is the cut-throat pre-med course; it marks the point at which a student who wants to become an M. D. makes it or drops out of pre-med. 
A tough course for the student, Organic Chern is most certainly a rigorous course for the professor who teaches it. Professor Danehy has done an admirable job, puttinginto his teaching effort enthusiasm and vigor that many younger faculty members would be hard-pressed to match. 
Danehy' s teaching is not limited to chemistry. He teaches a section of Collegiate Seminar, a course which (ideal­ly) calls for a teacher who has some knowledge of philosophy, literature and

history.

A total scholar, Professor Danehy is intimately familiar with the great works of literature which are read for Seminar. Such a well-rounded professor is an asset to any school, especially Notre Dame, a university that stresses liberal education., 
In the classroom, Danehy gives himself totally to his teaching. Outside the classroom, he is always available for-consultation, and is willing to devote whatever time is necessary to help his students. Prof. Danehy demands much from those he teaches, but he demands much more from himself as a teacher. Dedicated and hard working, Danehy has earned the respect of his students, and is almost universally admired by those who have had him in class. 
James Danehy has not limited his involvement with Notre Dame to teaching.He is president of the Notre Dame Credit Union's Board of Directors. He is also a long-time member of the Faculty Senate. He nowserves as its chairman. In this role, he has increased the efforts of previous.chairmen to create an amicable workingrelationship between the Senate and the Administration. 
In view of his past record at Notre Dame,· and his continuing good work, we heartilysupport Professor James P. :nanehy in his effort to continue teaching, and we reproach anyone who would force him into retirement long before his time has come.

Dried Brain Syf}drome 
Dear Editor: 
Regarding Professor Danehy's forced retirement: The former pastor of my parish, an energetic, vigorous man, who was forced to retire by the Church once said bitterly; "You know, when you turn 65 your brains dry up." Apparent­ly some of our administrators suffer fror the same mentality.

Ticket Sales 

Questioned 
Dear Editor: 
On Tuesday morning, February 
22. a friend of mine anc I stood in line for a combined total of five hours at the Student Union box office in order to obtain the best possible tickets for the upcoming Electric Light Orchestra concert. When we finally reached the ticket window at II a.m.. we were told that the be~t sections, B and I 0, had already been sold out. This did not surprise us because we were preceded in th.e line by about 70 people. 
Eventually. we purchased a number of tickets in section 8 which, we were told, were the last <ne<, lcf1 in that ~cction. So &ftcr we left the window, sections B, 8, and 10 were supposedly sold out. I say "supposedly" because now I read in your paper that some tickets from these very same sections were stolen from the Student Union office last week. 
My question is: If these tickets were indeed "sold," how is it that there were still some available to be stolen? Obviously, these tickets were withheld from the students and I'd like to know why. 
Stephen L. Needles 


Observer 
Criticized 
Dear Editor: 
It seems that in dealing with the recent SBP Election, The Observer's actions were curiously inconsistent, and in the opinion of myself and a number of others. quite inappropriate. 
First there was the matter of endorsing a ticket. Had The Observer's editoriaL staff chose to endorse one of the nine tickets pripr to last Tuesday's preliminary election they would have their preference known to the campus without any way hampering the campaigns of the other candidates. It seems that if one of the tickets was so impressive as to warrant an endorsement from the editorial board, they they would have wished the campus to know their feeings before Tuesday's election. After all. the ticket they considered the best concievahly might not have gotten enough votes to even qualify for Thursday's run-off. Instead, they chose to wait until only tickets remained,. meaning that an endorsement of one would necessarily have some impact on the efforts of the other. 
At any rate, the editorial staff obviously felt that Wednesday's endorsement of the Bender-Soma ticket would not be "unfair to Mr. Russell," though he would not have "a chance to reply at length." 
Thus, their subsequent decision to delay the printing of Mr. Van Tassel's letter concerning Mr. Bender's misconceptions about the SLC was seemingly inconsistent, since the delay was justified by their reasoning that the printing would be "unfair to Mr. Bender" since he would not have "a chance to reply at equal length.·~ In this way an attempt to enlighten the campus about the weakness of one of the very planks of the platform that The Observer had recently so heartily endorsed was effectively suppressed until the election was over. 
If The Observer feels that it is performing a service to the Notre Dame-St. Mary's community by unbiased reporting of important and relevant information. and this commitment extended to SBP elec­tion coverage, then I feel the editorial staff should admit not merely their "regret" about this incident, but the fact that they made a serious error in judgement. This error may have cost a very dedicated and hard-working tl')divi­dual the election, when as it was the margin of defeat was c.\lremcly narrow. 
Tht.odurc A. Howard 

Apathy at Notre Dame is not inherent as some feared. The students are concerned and respon­sive when an issue of importance arises. Such was demonstrated by the tremendous turnout in this year's SBP and SBVP elections. A remarkable number of people case ballots this election; less than 'one percent separated my running 
mateJohn Geppert and myself from the winning ticket. 
Certainly this was one of the most memorable elections in recent times. The slim margin of victory demonstrates the political involve­ment that characterized the cam­pus for several days. For a special group however, this election was only culminated by the balloting. The entire process of organization, planning and strategy took hun­dreds of man-hours even five weeks before election day. 
We would like to _thank all of the V0ters who had the confidence in US to trust us with their votes. We cannot repay all of the individuals who pledged their loyalty and time fo our belief, nor can our hall coordinators or campaign mana­gers Brian Clancy, Chad Tiedemann and Jeff Kohler be adequately repaid. 
Perhaps Mark Eck, of the third place ticket, will never realize how indebted we are for his support and allegiance the night after he him­self had been defeated. Mark trusted our platform, had faith in its candidates and took hours of his own time to campaign for Russeii­Geppert in Flanner Hall. The ·overwhelming turnout there not only-demonstrated a mandate for the ticket;iJUt it al!.o demonstrated the confidence and respect of the Flanner ·residents toward Mark 
( 

Eck. This type of respect is the quality most admirable in a student leader at Notre Dame. 
Undeniably, the loss hurt, but not in a bitter sort of way. Almost two thousand students trusted their votes to us, an amazing display of support. We are onlyworriedthat we will not be in a position to implement the proposals the voters worked and voted for. However, we feel the programs and proposals of our platform are sound an implementable. Specifically, we urge our new SBP and SHVP, Dave Bender and Tom Soma to nurture the SLC along its path to deal with student life problems in a long range basis, secondly, to be visible student leaders and thirdly to recognize and deal with a social life on campus which is in .need of much improvement. 
At this time our Student Govern­ment has a tremendous opportunity to utilize an active and enthusiastic student body to accomplish its goals. With a completely unified Student Body Dave and Tom will be able to deal more convincingly with the business at hand. We are hopeful of a direction in student government towards greater vi~i-­bility and efficiency, which will enable Dave and Tom to maintain the interest of the student, body throughout their whole term. 
Only with the support of the greatest student body in the world can Notre Dame's Student Govern­ment represent the concerns of its students. We pledge our total support to Dave Bender and Tom Soma and en·courage our many supports to do likewise. There is a great deal to be done, we wish Dave and Tom the best of success in their approach to accomplish their goals.

The only business class offered to non-business majors is account­ing. This spring there are two sections, and next fall and spring there will be two sections each. This is a section per semester increase. All the departments are in the process of looking for courses that can be opened to non-business majors.
