Reform demands student, faculty, trustee drive 
By way of summary and review, this 
final segment of the Chancellor­
President position papers intends to 
reiterate those points which have led 
us to advocate a restructuring of Notre 
Dame's administration by the appoint­
ment of Father Theodore Hesburgh as 
Chancellor and Willis Nutting as Presi­
dent. 
Our first consideration was the 
question: What is education? We have 
suggested that one's actual education 
at Notre Dame is very far from the 
ideal higher education. However, it is 
not simply student dissatisfaction over 
lack of good teachers that is at fault. 
Samuel Clemen's adage that he never 
Jet his schooling interfere with his 
education suggests the fundamental 
nature of the problem. Today, coJ;ege 
education (as Dr. Nutting contends in 
his Free City) has become fragmented, 
"scholarly", and needlessly painful for 
those who most want to learn. 
We have suggested Dr. Nutting's plan for the Free City (Temple­gate,l967, available at the Notre Dame bookstore), which emphasizes a "for­mal dialogue" and an integration of all academic disciplines, to show just how far Notre Dame is from the ideal eUucational community. 
The first issue, then, is how do we best educate the man himself? Our answer: through a community of teachers-learners living in a free city of the mind. 
What is a University? We have attempted to answer this question by comparing the ideal uni­versity and the real university. We 
suggested that "the curriculum of the 
to fulfill that f It has 

Students plan 'Shamrocks for Dystrophy Day' 
Notre Dame and St. Mary's students are grouping force$ for an attack next week on muscular dystrophy, one of America's most dreaded and disabling diseases. 
In response to a request by Tom Parnell, district represen­tative of the muscular dystrophy association of America, the Hall Presidents' Council agreed two weeks ago to spearhead the fund drive, slated for Saturday, March 14. 
Tony Scolaro, Alumni Hall President, and sophomore Richard J. Wall, agreed to serve as co-chairman for the effort and 
SPIRO MADE ART CURATOR 
Stephen Spiro, a New York artist who has studied prints and drawings of the 19th century, has joined the Notre Dame staff as curator of the Art Gallery. Spiro holds a master's degree from Adelphi University, Garden City, N.Y., and had previously been associated with a New York art gallery. 
university ought to be interesting, as 
judged by the students who are com­
\3elled to follow it, and second, the 
government of the university ought to 
be fair, as judged by the faculty and 
students who are ruled by it. 
Notre Dame, as most universities, is 
not a community, but a corporation. 
It is on this issue that we find the need 
for a radical university restructuring. 
As Dr. Nutting says, "the educational 
pattern is thoroughly and intrinsically 
wrong." 
Administrative Schizophrenia? 
Could Notre Dame have a better 
administrative structure? Few people 
close to the situation disagree that the 
answer to this question is YES. The 
issue is over what the new structure 
will be. 
Because "universities are split be­
tween their external functions and 
their internal necessities," we have 
found that Father Hesburgh has been 
burdened with too much responsibility 
for any one man. 
The administrative schizophrenia, which tears our President away for one half of the school year to serve on nearly 30 boards and commissions must be confronted. ' 
Chancellor-President structure? 
The i roblem is not that Father 
Hesburgh has Qutlived his usefulness 
but that his responsibilities, as he see~ 
them, no longer correspond to the job 
of university president -namely, the 
supervision and progress of the inter­
nal affairs of the campus itself. 
Within the present structure, too many demands on the person of the President make it impossible for him 

Thus, we envision the establishment of a Chancellor-President system, splitting the present authority of the one President into two offices ac­cording to the already-existing split between the external and internal fun­ctions of the university. 
Hesburgh-Nutting? 
Assuming that we can make the necessary revisions in the by-laws of the university to allow for this struc­tural change, why appoint Dr. Nutting President and Father Hesburgh Chancellor? Our reply is twofold. 
First, the two men have shown outstanding ability to deal with the responsibilities the offices would en­tail. "Chancellor" Hesburgh possesses "a familiarity with both national and international commissions," he also posses "an intense rapport with the alumni." In these areas Father Hes­burgh has displayed both "skill and zeal." "President" Willis Nutting, on the other hand, has lived all of his life as an educator. That he is a teacher of distinction is an undeniable fact (ask anyone who knows him). His capacity for communication and understanding may be without parallel in the Univer­sity. And this ability, so much needed in the Presidency, would greatly bene­fit Notre Dame. 
Second, the two men, through their mutual dedication to the University of of Notre Dame would be able to work in a way that would most benefit the University. The compatibility of these two. is obvious after examining their 
lives. What Do You Think? 
set  a  goal  of  $2,000  for  the  
drive.  Part  of  a  national  cam­ 
paign  entitled  "Shamrocks  for  

Dystrophy Day," the fund­raising endeavor will concentrate on using students from Notre Dame and St. Mary's to collect funds within the halls on both campuses as well as from the South Bend community. 
Shamrock emblems will be distributed to contributors as an acknowledgement of their gen­erosity in the campaign, which takes its theme from the proxi­
mity to St. Patrick's Day. Tentative plans call for hall floor lobby of La Fortune Stu­dent Center. 
Organizers of the fund drive sited two ~oals for the campaign that the drive serve as adeviCe for fostering better relations be­tween the college community and the residents of South Bend. 
Scolaro added that the funds collected would be sent to the National Office of the Muscular Dystrophy Association and the money will be used to promote research, patient services and public health education in an 
effort to eliminate the disease, which strikes primarily at young children. 

in addition to the most imme­diate one of raising the thousand dollars. 
"Above and beyond the rais­
. ing of funds, it is imperative that we offer as many students as possible a chance for involve­ment in a cause that is worth-1 while and meaningful," Scolaro remarked. It is also important

position papers would serve as a cata­
lyst to discussion, criticism, and action 
in regard to Notre Dame's adminis­
trative structure. 
We are skeptical of the saving "the 
pen is mightier than the sword," it 
often takes an urgent and dramatic 
event to shake an educational institu­
tion into serious reflection and 
self-criticism. 
That Notre Dame is a good place to 
be is borne witness to by each of us 
every day that we spend here: that 
Notre Dame can become a real com­
munity remains to be seen. 
By remaining here at Notre Dame, each of us bear witness to the fact that Notre Dame is a good place to be. Yet, there are few among us who maintain that this same Notre Dame is a community. The urgency of the pen may not be clear, but the events of the future will probably continue to prove, (as those of the past few years) that Notre Dame is moving away from community. 
Father Hesburgh and Dr. Nutting 
both champion the cause of com­munity and dialogue. To keep this stand from being empty rhetoric we ask that the Board of Trustees and the Notre Dame student body and faculty help us move in this direction. Reform 
is absolutely essential, now.

Cfilulist? 
It's easy to tell a Paulist. Just talk with him. 
The first thing you notice is that he's contemporary. He Jives today, but plans tomorrow with the experience and knowl­edge of yesterday. That's a Paulist characteristic: the abil­ity to move with the times and to meet the challenges of each era.

SMC 0-C housing 
When the executive Committee of the Board of Trustees of St. Mary's meets on March 14, they will be presented with an off-campus housing proposal for the 1970-71 academic year. We feel that this proposal should be considered and accepted by the Committee for several reason. 
In the past St. Mary's has existed as a totally residential community with only a few of its students commuting. There was no chance for a resident to move off-campus unless she had relatives in the immediate area. We feel the college should realize and accept the individual student's needs as a student and as a person. Many residents are unhappy in the dorm situation where the rules and regulations tend to inhibit personal freedom and devel­opment. To demand that these students remain on campus is a mistake and denies the student her freedom of choice in determining her own style of living. 
But besides denying the student her right to develop as she desires, the current policy denies the college c.ummunity the opportunity to establish and maintain a contact with the outside area, and a variation in the current dormitory mode of existence. 
Many fear the loss of identity which a student establishes while living in the dorms at St. Mary's. Students who move off campus will have had at least one year of dormitory living under the proposal which allows only seniors, juniors, and sophomores to leave the campus. This will allow students to establish contact with other residents of the college which the move will not destroy. Also in the bill are suggestions for lunch passes and dry cleaning services which will allow daily contact between resident and off-campus students. This move off-campus can only improve the present environment at St. Mary's, by establishing a variation of ideas, different styles of living, and personal development ultimately making St. Mary's a more realistic and contemporary college. 
One final point should be mentioned. If the off-campus housing proposal is not accepted, students returning to St. Mary's for the fall term will find forced triples, quads, and quints in at least one dormitory. There will be approximate­ly ll 0 more girls than there are beds available. To prevent this intolerably overcrowded condition, we must turn to off-campus housing as the only realistic solution. 
Therefore, it is our opmton that the Executive Committe should accept the proposed bill and allow both the individual and the college to grow and develop.

Letters to the editor 
Overlan's duty 

Editor: 
I would like to offer a few suggestions to the University of Notre Dame and all others interested. First, if the campus police would stop trying to fill their quotas of parking tickets there would probably be a bit more security in the parking lots around campus. The police spend much of their time writing parking tickets, looking for girls in the halls, listening to their radios and filling in the rest of their time' by sleeping. I imagine 
the fault  is  not  all theirs since  
they  are  merely  following  the  
lead  of  their  leader,  Arthur  
Pears.  

And now for the Dean of Students I have this for a suggestion: Since you thought the symbolic burning of the lamb was done in good humor perhaps you will take this with a bit of humor also. There comes a time in every man's life when he no longer can keep up with the changing times. Although I don't believe you ever where in tune with the times, it is a certainty that you are prehistoric. Resign. 
For those of you who think that Notre Dame is becoming more aware than it was in the past, you haven't seen the mentality that the basketball season has created. Instead of Notre Dame being rah-rah for three months it has been extended for four more months and now Notre Dame has the privilege of being totally absurd instead of partially absurd. As one freshman said to me "What did you do around here when the basketball team wasn't any good?" 
This is mostly trivia, I find the most productive way to exist at Notre Dame is to ignore Notre Dame. But I do have an obligation to think, no matter how depressing it might be.

Signs too Dirty 

Editor: 
Permit me to use the "Letters to the Editor" column to ex­press a few comments concern­ing the tenor of several bits of publicity which have appeared at the Universtiy within the past week, one a notice on the bul­letin boards, the other the car­toons being distributed at the desk in the hall outside the Office of the Placement Bureau. 
Certainly no one will deny the fact that steps need to be taken to guarantee a greater degree of campus security, and I believe that the panel discussion on the matter scheduled for Thursday, February 26th, was a step in the right direction; campus security needs the concern and cooper­ation of all members of the Notre Dame community, a con­cern for the property and safety of others. I question the propri­ety and good taste, however, of the wording of the bulletin cal­ling attention to the meeting. ­There are certain words which are quite appropriate and entire­ly satisfactory in the breeding of c.anines, but I do believe that a careful and impassioned study of Roget's Thesaurus could have produced a word which would have been more in keeping with what might be expected in a community of scholars, and which would have expressed the deep concern which all of us who are dedicated to Notre Dame feel about some of the security conditions which prevail on this campus. 
Concerning the cartoons being distributed in the Administra­tion Building by the groups ob­jecting to interviews by certain companies, the nadir of gopd taste and gentility has been reached; they are the type of scurrilous scratchings one might expect to find on the walls of a public rest-room; gutter cartoons are poor substitutes for talent and imagination. Again, I main­tain that good taste and evi­dences of good breeding could have produced cartoon:; or a 
message of impact without re­sorting to a "pig-sty" theme. Customarily, the creators of car­toons feel enough ~ense of pride to warrant the initialling of their effoFts; the fact that these were not so marked would indicate that the perpetrators were not proud of their work. 
Sincerely yours,

"Unity" will be the keynote of the SBP campaign of junior Michael "Pete" Pete.rson. Peter­son, a junior in the General f!~ogram, has chosen sophomore history major Rory Baruth as his running mate in a campaign op­posed to what Peterson views as the "polarized" political situa­tion at Notre Dame. 
In an interview Tuesday night, 
Peterson stat~_t!!at he saw little not the same choice as offered by one of the other major candi­dates; it's a choice between us and one of them," said Peterson. 

Peterson listed his major activ­ity as "writer" and added that he had done and was doing publicity work for campus cof­fee houses. Neither Peterson nor Baruth have had experience in

difference between whom he considered· the two leading can-dictates, Tom Thrasher and Dave Kra~Tma, and previous campus elections. 
"Students look af the candi­dates and think, 'we got a choice between a Fascist and a Com­mie, who the hell cares'?" obser­ved Peterson. 
He viewed his candidacy as an alternative. "It (Peterson's candidacy) is 
student government. But Peter­son felt that this inexperience was an asset not a liability, that his varied experience was an aid to uniting the various political factions on campus. He felt the experience of the other candi­dates narrowed their political outlook. 
"I think I know more about what various factions on campus all think; 1 can see a larger segment of viewpoint," Peterson 
suggested. 
The junior from Star Lake, N.Y., added that he was getting more "co-operation" than he ex­pected. Peterson broke his cam­
paign into four "main priori­ties": coalition of factions, hall autonomy, academic reform and student services. The "coalition" would be ac­complished through his propos­e d "concensus" government. The consensus government is based partly on Peterson's belief that he represents a wide range of student opinion and his inten­tion to include within the Stu­dent Government structure stu­dents representing the opposing views on campus, possibly even his current opponents. Peterson saw on-campus stu­dents as "tenants" and the Uni­versity as "landlord." "When a student is required to shell-out in excess of $500, he must have

some independence," stated Peterson. 
Within "academic reform," the junior suggested the total abolishment of the present .grad­ing system in favor of a campus­wide pasS:.fail scheme. Peterson regafded the current system as "arcl\aic" a~d added that it was often seen that past grades are "not ·indicative of future per­formance." 
He recommended that a course in "citizenship" be offer­ed, possibly in the Free Universi­ty, to acquaint students, espe­cially off-campus residents, with their civil rights and responsibili­ties. "There are a lot of little things that people assume you know but you don't," said Peter­son.

by Mike Ruffer Two Notre Dame students, Joseph Pavoni and Richard Mur­ley, who are taking graduate courses in Environmental Health Engineering, have organized the Michiana Forum on the Environ­ment. The purpose of this for­um, according to Dr. Philip Sing­er Assistant Professor of Civil E~gineering, is to familiarize the people of the St. Joseph County area with the environmental problems confronting them, especially environmental deten­oration. Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin proposed a Day of Concern in dealing with the envi­ronment. The date set is April 
22. Progl'ams in accordance with this day have been organized on city, campus and school levels. 
On the city level, according to· Dr. Singer, the mayors of the local towns are expected to declare April 22 as a Day of Concern for their respective towns. ~eakers will address many civic organizations and leagues to help the people of the area gain a better knowledge of these problems. Talks will also be given in the local elementary and high schools. 
A local inventory of the prob­lems of St. Joseph County will be taken; including such aspects· as the air pollution ordinance. Consideration will also be given towards campaigns for the elim­ination of throw-away bottles, and how to eliminate waste dis­charges which make the St. Joseph River unfit for swimming or boating. 
Programs have been scheduled on the campuses of Notre Dame, Bethel College, the South Bend campus of Indiana University and possibly at St. Mary's Col­lege. Dr. Singer added that the purpose of these programs are to 
educate the student body on these environmental problems and to spur them into action to help correct these problems in any way they can. 

Applications available 
Applications for summer em­ployment are now available for interested students. The appli­cations may be picked up in the Placement Bureau Annex, Room 207, in the Main Building. The Annex will be open from I :00 
p.m. until 5:00 p.m., Monday through Wednesday. 
The Bureau, which will com­plete its work on summer em­ployment on March 26, recom­mends that students fill out their applications without delay. Sep­

Liberal Arts and. Engineering, Science students are available at the Annex and at the office of the Observer. A'list of employers who will be interviewing in the Placement Office during the week of March 9, is also avail­able at both locations. 
The SLC recently requested the Placement Bu~eau to make these lists more available and to do more in the area of summer employment. The request grew out of controversy over the limited work of the Bureau in level, though, it's worth it," McKenna says. 
McKenna's evaluation of the NSA's worth is not !Jhared by Young Americans for Freedom president Tom Murphy. Murphy contends that NSA membership isn't worth any membership dues. 
"I was glad to see the dues cut," Murphy said. "I suggest that the Senate cut the dues entirely and leave the organiza­tion."

A campus committee has already been established here at Notre Dame in accordance with the Day of Concern, consisting of a chairman and three stu­dents. Dr. Philip Singer, a teacher of Environmental Health Engineering, is the chairman of the committee. The students on the committee are Terry O'Con­nor ( 283-7909), Chris Putman (283-8175), and Tim Pine (233-3767). 
Dr. Sinra expressed his hopes that mo~.:: people would get in­volved in this program. There is a need · for people to act as speakers and instructors on this project. Anyone who is inter~ ested in working on this pro­gram, or those who would like to learn more about the prob­lems facing us and our environ­ment are urged to contact either be an association for radical stu­dents which provides an oppor­tunity once a year at a conven­tion for them to condemn all of society and themselves (if

society  (if  they're  a  minority  
group)."  

Student Body Vice-President Fred Detrich says that he is not dismayed by anti-NSA activity, although he himself supports the organization. "They have every right to say what they want," Detrich conceded, "But I think the NSA is well worth the time and money we put into it.". 
"In many senses, the NSA convention last summer was not structured enough. Problems arose when there weren't enough speakers, when there weren't enough programs to work on. The NSA conventions need more organization," the Vice-Presi­dent continued. 
Of course, the National Stu­dent Association is dependent on student government partici­pation. As the nationwide organ­ization peruses its uncertain des­tiny, it appears as though Notre Dame's relations with the organi­zation will be just as muddled.
