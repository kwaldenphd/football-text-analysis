PARIS (UP!) High allied sources said last night the Paris 
negotiations on Vietnam have been postponed again because of U.S. 
failure to break down South Vietnam's boycott of the talks. 
The sources said there would be no meeting today the usual day 
for formal sessions of Vietnam talks. It will mark the third straight 
week that the geginning of the broadened talks has been put off 
because of South Vietnamese objections. 
A diplomatic official with direct access to the negotiations said 
last night: ­
"We can report no progress in our effort to reach an accord with Saigon on terms of reference that would overcome their hostility to the presence of the National Liberation Front." 
But the United States was reported to have redoubled its efforts, and the source said hopes remained high in the allied camp that President Nguyen Van Thieu soon would work out a formula with 
U.S. envoy Ellsworth Bunker that would send a delegation to Paris. 
Kosygln Says Russia Will Negotiate 
MOSCOW (liPI) Soviet Premier Alexei N. Kosygin told two 
U.S. senators yesterday his country was ready to negotiate new arms control agreements with the United States, but expressed concern at President-elect Richard M. Nixon's views on the matter. 
Kosygin made his hopes and uncertainties known to the senators 
during a "lively exchange" that covered the chances fur world peace 
and the Soviet led invasion of Czecholsovakia. 
After the 80 minute meeting in Kosygin's Kremlin office, Sens. 
Albert Gore, D Tenn., and Claiborne Pelt, R R.I., said the Russian 
leader had expressed concern over statements by President elect 
Nixon about maintaining American military superiority. 
The senators said Kosygin told them it would be difficult to 
improve relations bet ween the two superpowers if one was trying to 
become stronger than the other. 
Gorr s:~id he had replied that while "mutuality of interests betwc·:n our two countries is greater than ever" serious discussions on ~lowing the missile race and the deployment of expensive anti-Lallistic missile systems "could not begin now because of the situation in Ctechoslovakia." 

Czech Students Strike for Reforms 
PRA(;UE (UPI) Thousands of striking students, buoyed hy protest songs, held university buildings yesterday i~ a campaign agai11st a new Communist party program abandonmg most of Ctechoslovakia's democratic reforms. 
The nation's leaders, however, began a drive to win support for th:: r>rogram in the Communist party's grassroots. Premier Oldrich Cer.tik called at a gathering of party functionaries at Ceske Budcjovice, a regional capital south of Prague, for full support of the new party line and rejection of "anti-Socialist clements." 
The line was laid down Monday in a 21-pagc Central Committee resolution that replaced the "action program" advanced by Czechoslovak reformers last April. The rcsolu tion omitted the earlier guarantees of freedom of the press, freedom of assembly and elimination of restrictions on travel. It retained a guarantee of protection against the arbitrary police methods of Stalinism. 

Germany To Prevent Mark Revaluation 
BONN (UPI) West Germany yesterday announced a series of "immediate tax measures" to prevent revaluation of the Gern~;1n marJ.. and increase its value during Europe's monetary crisis. The new taxes would increase imports and curb the country's export surplus. 
(;ovcrnmcnt spokesman Guenther Diehl told a news conference that Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesingcr and key cabinet members decided in a conference today to implement "immediate tax measures in the field of imports and exports." 
Diehl said the nature of the measures would be kept secret for the momertl. llowever, he said, they would have the effect of curbing the rapidly growing export surplus in the nation's balance of trade. 
lie said this would he done by making it cheaper to import and more expensive to export. 
But Diehl stressed the government stands by its past determination not to revalue the German mark. Speculators have been betting it would be revalued at the expense of the sagging French franc. 

Condition of the Franc Worsens 
PARIS (UP!) Banking reports said France's economic crrsrs worsened yesterday. President Charb de Gaulle held urgent talks on how to save th; franc from threatened devaluation. 
The reports said the Bank of France was again dipping heavily into shrinking reserves of gold to keep the franc afloat in money exchange lll<tr cts where nervous speculators arc dumping it. 
Premier Maurice Couve de Murville and Finance Minister Francois Xavier Ortoli met with De Gaulle. Later in the day Couve de Murvillc was expected to outline budget cuts designed to build confidence in the national economy and the franc.

Demonstration 1n 3rd Day 
The Dow Chemical Company and Central lntclligcnce Agency protest continued yesterday through the night for the second day in the rotunda of the second floor of the Administration Building. 
At press time (2 a.m.) the demonstrators were attempting to decide upon a course of action when the CIA recruiters arrive on campus today. Some were in favor of passive resistance, that is, a sit-in in front of the Placement Bureau rooms to prevent students from entering. Others were in favor of a protest of non-intervention. Most agreed that the decision would have to be a personal one, although the issue was by no means set tied. 
The afternoon was spent in discussion, poetry readings and speeches. Assistant English Professor Peter J. Michelson began the afternoon session before a small crowd of about 30 by reading selected poetry, some of his own composition including "The Eater." 
Visiting Professor of Education Vincent Lannic spoke again today briefly. lie called the demonstration "a vigil of wait; a vigil of hope." He gave a brief autographical description of his life and emphasized several incidents which changed his life. 
lie said that a visit with a wounded Vietnam veteran in Washington's Walter Reed Jlospital left him stunned in despair and disgust. Lannie told of several passages in the Bible which reconverted him to Christianity. 
IIe read a passage from Ecclesiastes, part of which read, "There is nothing new under the sun ... What has been done will be done again ... What vanity is it all and a chasing of the wind . 
very essence of my life." The 
passage was, "Avoid getting into debt except the debt of mutual love." Lannie added that "Love is what Dow fears." lie also quoted the epistle ending ". and the greatest of these is love." 
He called the day-night demonstration a love feast and said the participants were in love. He concluded with, "If you refuse to love then you only remain dead. When you feel love you feel Christ and when you feel Christ you arc in an ecstasy of love. Although we arc few in number we will win because lovers always win." 
At 8 p.m. the demonstrators witnessed several underground films shown by David Kahn. 
Visiting Assistant Education Professor Vincent Lannie said during the sermon of the mass that he had contacted students and faculty at New York University, Columbia, Rochester, the City College of New York and Boston University. He said that several sympathizers agreed to fast for one day to express their support of the Notre Dame demonstration. 
About 250 people attended the I I p.m. mass celebrated by Assistant University Chaplain Rev. Joseph Hoffman, CSC. At the conclusion of the mass the demonstrators locked hands and sang "We Shall Overcome."

Kahn Predicts 



Coming Soon: Move to Right 
Nuclear strategist Herman Kahn, Director of the Hudson Institute, told an audience of more than 300 in the Library Auditorium yesterday that "There is no question that the movement of history is for the New Left and the social activist and against the 'forgotten man' of the lower middle class." Kahn cautioned, however, that "There will be a slight move to the right in America over the next four to eight years." 
Kahn's predictions came at the end of an hour-long, witty talk on the subject "New Revolutionary Movements" in which the Hudson Institute

WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 20,1968 THE. OBSERVER 
Open Letter ·to the Demonstrator~ 
Friends: 
During the past several days a number of my friends have invited me to participate in the demonstration in the Administration Building this week. I have decided not to participate, and would like to explain my reasons for doing so. 
First of all, let me explain that I am a Christian pacifist. I do not believe in the use of war as an instrument of national will. 
I believe that the current war m Vietnam is especially immoral, and that certain weapons being used there fail to meet even the traditional Scholastic requirements of the waging of a so-called "just war." I believe that the Dow Chemical Company is wrong when it refuses to accept moral criteria as a basis for its acceptance of contracts. I also believe that the United States of America has engaged in a foreign policy that at best can be called imperialistic and exploitative, and that the Central Intelligence Agency has been au active conspirator in this policy.
D e m o n s t r a t i o n s · arc v a r i e d i n execution and purpose. One is the kind that results from the refusal of a court or lcgislat ive body to remove a particularly unjust law, or enact a desperately needed one. Civil disobedience is then used both to test the laws in a higher court and to pressure the responsible parties into legislative or judicial remedy. This was the rationale behind the famous sit-ins of Dr. Martiu Luther King in the South. 

Another type of demonstration may occur when a large segment of the public is ignorant of certain facts which might arous<! them to action. 
1\ third type of demonstration can occur when a particular grievance arises suddenly that is extremely odious and which one 
is  powerless  personally  to  
change.  Such  was  the  
Democratic  Convention  this  
year.  

The demonstration this week is not a forceful attempt to change an unjust law, unless o:·e considers the university polic~ on job recruiting as such. But anyone who seriously thinks that this demonstration will 
r 
actually change university po ICY 
politics

accusation particularly is subject to evidence and documentation, and such documentation is available. The articles in the Observer this week arc a step in the right direction. But wouldn't it have been wiser to print them before the demonstration as an initiative to discussion? Or what about having a former agent of the CIA speak first-hand of his experiences in a public lecture? Past experience with the Notre Dame student body has shown me that radical demonstrations tend to alienate more students than they convert. 
It m i g h t be a lot 
I c s s glamorous if one spent 
the three days walking through 
the halls and talking with 
students, but I feel it would 
probably he much more 
effective in the long run. 
I might here ask why the Dow 
Company and the CIA have been 
singled out for attention; I have 
yet to hear a convincing 
rationale. Certainly, Dow makes 
napalm. But if one could write a 
category of horrors of the war, it 
seems to me that the phosphorus 
bomb, which produces a burn 
down to the bone and is actually 
encouraged by the application of 
water, would he even more 
repulsive. 

The number of noncombatants inadvertently burned with napalm is actually minute when compared to those 
who have been killed or maimed 
with the good old conventional 
fragmentation bombs and hand 
grenades. Is it less immoral to 
manufacture these and send 
them to Vietnam? Who has the 
contract for the M-16 rille, for 
the portable flamethrower? 
Spc rry-Ran d manu fac lures 
precision instruments for the 
guidance of both conven tiona( 
and nuclear missiles. I do not 
rccull that anyone has sat down 
in front of the car of a 
Sperry-Rand recruiter. 
The point I am making is that 
the Vietnam war. American 
foreign policy, and the insane 
race to achieve a higher and 
higher ratio of overkill arc all rooteci in much deeper illnesses in our sick society. We need not 
look to the CIA and Dow for 
symbols or scapegoats-rather 
we should look in our owl. 
homes, our own classrooms, our own hearts. When one realizes 
the full depths of this problem, and still insists on demonstrating, I doubt if he will be sleeping for two nights in the Notre Dame Administration Building. The Catonsville Nine and the Milwaukee Fourteen realized this, and arc now facing a not very pleasant future in federal prison. 
But I still believe in the way of communication and discussion as the principal vehicle of change in this country. I still believe in responsible Black Power, in better schools, and equitable representation in legislatures and political parties. It is here where I must put my efforts. 
PAGE 3 

SMC Curfew & Sign-Out 
Due to considerable confusion and bafflement with regard to signout policy, SMC Student Body President Therese Ambrusko has provided these clarifications: 
-Girls may sign out at any time to spend the night in another hall. They must fill out an overnight card and enter the hall before curfew hours: 12:00 on weekdays; and 2:00 on weekends. 
-·· Freshman curfews remain 12:00 and 2:00. Although frosh can also sign out, provided they fill out an overnight card 24 hours in advance, and obtain approval from the hall director. 
-Men are not allowed in the halls at any time after curfews. -Girls cannot call the hall desk of their dorm after closing hours, to either sign out or change plans. -Upperclassmen may sign out at any time; if after curfew, they must present their /D to the security guard. -There is now no system of late minutes for upp~r-. class men. -Girls will not be allowed to enter the halls between 
5:30 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.; which is the changing of the guard. 
Yet, I am still in sympathy r-----------:-------------~ 
with much of what you are trying to say, and feel the need to express that sympathy. So, in a poor imitation of some of tl)e men from whom I have tried to draw my beliefs, I have initiated a 7-day fast as my means of expression, and invite others on campus to join me. 
And let us pray together for our fellow Americans, and all our brothers in fear and hope.

Ara Wants It 
After a two day break, the Irish returned to practice yesterday, in preparation for the Nov. 30 tussle with lop-ranked Southern Cal. 
You gotta figure i\ra Parseghian wants this game very badly. They're starling to say he always blows the big ones, that he lumps in the clutch. 
Two days after the loss at Michigan State. llarry DeVoid of The Football News wrote, ''Notre Dame now has two patsies in Navy and Pittsburgh and we can presume both the yardage and score will grow big. This is the type of Notre Dame team we've seen for the past five seasons-lopsided scores against weak sisters, but not too good a batting average when meeting opponents of similar material and ranking. Starting in 1964, Notre Dame has met 13 opponents who ended up in the Top Twenty-Five (according to DeVoid's ranking system) for the year. To date, Coach i\ra Parseghian has won only four, lost seven and tied two." 
Not only is this a chance for Ara to silence critics like DeVoid, it probably will be his first chance for an upset triumph. Never in his reign here has Notre Dame been an underdog. Las Vegas won't quote odds on this contest until Sunday evening, but the Trojans should be no less than a one-touchdown pick. 
The 45-year-old Armenian has some bad recollections of USC. Like 1964, for instance, when his Huarte-Snow-Carroll team entered L.A. Coliseum 9-0, took a 17-0 halftime lead, then bowed 21-17 in the final minutes on a Craig Fertig-to-Rod Sherman TO pass. 
Or 1967 when the unbeaten Trojans brought their No. I ranking to ND Stadium to face the once-beaten Irish, 12-to 14-point favorites. USC copped a 24-7 decision that day a·s 0.1. Simpson rushed for ISO yards and Notre Dame's offense turned over the ball five times via fumbles or interceptions inside the enemy 30 yardline. 
This year's Trojans are not nearly the same aggregation which visited Du Lac last fall. Barring further injuries this week against UCLA, only II of the 22 men who started last fall will face Notre Dame Nov. 30 before a national television audience. 
On offense, linemen Ron Yary, Mike Scarpace and Mike Taylor and split end Earl McCullough have been graduated. Flanker Jim Lawrence, also a '67 starter, is out with the broken shoulder he suffered Nov. 2 against Oregon. 
On defense, linemen Tim Russovich, Gary Magnar and Chip Oliver, linebacker Adrian Young and haltbacks Pat Cashman and Bill Jaroncyk all arc departed. 
Besides Lawrence, this team has suffered only two other major injuries this season. Wilson Bowie, Simpson's back-up man. broke a hand Nov. 9 against California while IIerman Franklin, a tleet kickoff return specialist, re-injured his right foot last month and underwent surgery. 
Unfortunately for Notre Dame, there is one 
.. ..end Tim Rossovich .... 
.... and the terrible Orenthal James Simpson . 
Trojan who has ne11 her graduated nor been 
injured. llis name is Orenthal James Simpson. llis 
statistics arc unreal. With two games to play in his 
two-year career (junior college transfers lose m1e 
year of eligibility), Simpson already owns these 
marks: 

Most yards gained rushing by a USC back in one 
season: 1,543 by O.J. in 1967. 
Most rushing plays by a USC hack in one 
season: 291 by O.J. in 196H. 
In addition, Simpson has a shot at these 
records: Most yards gained rushing in one season 
in NCAA history: I,571 by Eugene Morris of West 
Texas State in 196H. O.J. has 1,449 in 196H.

Simpson's list of awards is as amazing as his 
stats. He'll get the biggest individual award of all 
Dec. 5. That's the day of the llcisman Trophy 
banquet. Downtown Athletic Club of New York 
will name Simpson the winner next Tuesday. 
Still, the best plaudits O.J. receives arc not 
trophies or statistical championships. The best a1c 
those amusing quotes which flow from the mouths 
of those who marvel his ability. for instance: 
Dec Andros of Oregon State: "When he's got 
the footbalL we got to be there with seven or eight 
people or that scoreboard's gonna get tired." 
Bob Schwarzrnann of the Seattle Times: "O.J. 
did everything to the lluskies hut burp thcm ... thc 
Trojans used Simpson as the drip, drip, drip of a 
Chinese water torture." 
John McKay. CU.'s coach: "If they got better guys than him in the pros, they're sure not playing them on Sundays when I watch the games.''
