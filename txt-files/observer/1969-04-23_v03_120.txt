ROTC critics: ''antithetical to university" 
by Ted Price 
As academia has reacted to the Vietnamese war, and concurrent social problems at home, segments of it have become increasingly vocal in their criticism of ROTC on college and university campuses. The New York Times last Saturday reported that, "each of the eight Ivy League schools some with a splash of publicity, others quietly and behind the scenes-is in one stage or another of abolishing academic credit for the 
ROTC program." 
Second in a three-part series 

The Times article later adds that although these institutions provide very few of the officers commissioned by ROTC, their actions have stimulated fear in the Pentagon of widespread discredidation. The way that such loss of credit usually evolves is for the institutions involved to vote to allow the contract with the government to run out, and stipulating that if a new one is negotiated, no provision for academic credit will be made. 
This is the situation at Harvard, where the Army's contract expires at the end of the current academic year, and those of the Navy and Air Force in June of 1970. 
llere at Notre Dame, there is a movement among the faculty to bring the matter before the Faculty Senate, the only group that can bring about such action. Although many professors' major quarrel with the program is wqat they judge to be substandard teaching methods, many du object to the content of the courses themselves. 
English Professor Peter Michelson charged that ROTC "Has a bad educative function." 
"It teaches militarism, which kills people," he added. "ROTC is political technology. To me the military is a bad political agent, it is seductive. We fall too easily into a pattern of military resolution of international conflict." 
Richard Bizot, also a professor of English, who was one of the key figures in the New Politics Party during the November elections, called ROTC "an apprenticeship, not an academic discipline." 
"If it is indeed an academic discipline, why then are there no graduate schools in it, or for that matter, no undergraduate degrees?" he asked. 
Bizot said that charges that the program's critics are unfamiliar with its curriculum are begging the question and called for ROTC to demonstrate that it is worthy of academic credit. (cont. on pg. 4)

Moral Bankruptcy 
hlitor: 
In the debate on more sub­stantial matters of university policy and diredion one minor Notre Dame outrage has , un­fortunately, gone almost un­noticed. As you may recall this university did not cancel classes on the day of Dr. Martin Luther King's funeral a little more than a year ago. Life went on around here just like normal even as the nation paused to mourn the slain civil rights leader. Only the Stu­dent Senate really proposed any sort of tribute, passing a reso­lution .:alling on the Administra­tion to name one of the two new high-rise dorms after Dr. King. 
Two weeks ago the first anni­versary of the death of Martin Luther King was observed throughout the nation by ser­vices of commemoration and pledges by everyone up to but not including Richard Nixon that every effort would be made to eradi~.:ate racism from our society. Notre Dame's com­memoration took on something of a different nature. It was announced that the new dorm would be named after J. Peter Grace. 
Now I do not wish to get into a wmparison of Martin Luther King and J. Peter Gra~.:e. Let it suffice to say that one man gave his life in the cause of liberating an oppressed people while the other has devoted his life to raking in profits off Bolivian tin miners who earn the equivalent of two dollars a day. However, in what is undoubtedly the equalizing factor in the minds of the moral men who administer this university, the latter indi­vidual has given thousands of dollars to Notre Dame. 
Naming the dorm after Grace is, in my opinion, outrageous. There arc many more important things to bitch about around here, hut a certain degree of moral bankruptcy is revealed by such a ~.:om para tively in con­seq ucntial matter as naming a building after a rich alumnus as opposed to a slain civil rights leader. If this be the trend I expel.:! Fr. llesburgh to wm­memoratc the first anniversary of Los Angeles by announcing that the second dorm will be

Black Reflection 
l·:ditor: 
The Alumni flail Council re­
cently approved a limited con­
centrati0n of Blads next year, 
in two adjoining scdions of the 
hall. Although I and all but one 
of my wlleagues voted for the 
resolution, its presentation left 
much to be desired. 
First, although this proposal had been made known to the hall president several days pre­vious, most of the council mem­bers were not informed of the motion until the meeting. Our votes were thus based on the rather brief discussion presented at the meeting. 

Secondly, to say that the presence of the Student Body President, and several members of the Afro-Ameri~.:an Society, during the roll-call vote was an influential factor in the voting, would be an understatement. A vote on so important an issue should have been based on re­flective consideration and not subject to momenta! pressure. 
Thirdly, because of the impor­tan~.:e of this resolution for the members of the hall. it should have been publicly presented. As it was, section leaders were not told about the proposal in time to solicit views from their consti­tuents. Since this plan involved bringing in of non-hall residents, in a special procedure; since it could involve the displacement of some hall members, it should have been open to general opin­ion. 
This is not to be understood as a wholesale rejection of the idea, but rather the manner in which it came about. That these rcflel.:lions ~.:o me now, indicates the speedy, superficial treatment of this proposal. I think a thor­ough, inclusive discussion of this relevant issue, with its import on the hall and university com­munity, would have been highly beneficial to those communities, rather than light treatment given the bill last Monday. 
Respedfully, Daniel J. Oberst

dweller and the white ghetto on behalf of the Blackstone worker as one of resentment; a Rangers. "get-off-our-backs" attitude. 
When asked in a briefly heated question -and-answer session, what could a middle-class white do to improve the ghetto situation and black-white relations Fry replied that the white person should concern himself with working within the white controlling agencies to destroy the ingrained racism that undoubtably exists there. But the ghettos themselves, Fry stressed, should be left up to the black commun­ity. 




ROTC critics claim political poison

"The university is providing this service to the military at the expense of the students," he added. But he conceded that "I think it's a good thing that 
military officers (if we must have them) not be mindless boobs." 
Rev. Ernest Bartell, chairman of the economics department said that although he was a pacifist, his objection to the program was strictly on a profes­sionallevel. 
Bartell claimed that ''the system supporting ROTC is not the academic community." 

"This institutionally compro­mises the spirit of liberal inquiry," he said. "This is not a reflection on any of the individ­uals involved in the program, since I know that some of them have done their best to over­come this. However, they are working in this compromised system, which can always over­
rule them."
"We teach a three-hour Spanish course in CILA," he ained. "We decided not to

In u.n editorial which ran last week in 28 college newspapers across the country, ROTC is 
charged with being "not only antithetical to the ultimate pur­poses of higher educaiion, but contrary to basic pedagogical principles as well." The editorial continues, claiming that the program's teaching methods are based on a doctrinaire approach. 
But perhaps the most damn­ing part of the editorial is the paragraph which cites an officer at the University of Minnesota: 
"In a frighteningly serious echo of Catch 22, he declared, "Marching is the basic leadership program for every officer."

their minds on the issue. Many students, as a matter of fact object to ROTC, or find them­

"I really couldn't believe it," he recalled. "I wonder if they realize that such advertising probably turned off more students than it attracted. 
J u nior Tim McCarry also spoke in this vein when he said, "There have been studies of the authoritarian personality and its affinity for military-type dis­cipline and the military environ­ment." 
"There is this unquestioned political content which underlies ROTC training on all levels," he said. "The really distasteful word in that sentence is 'u nq uest ioned'. 
Mist critics would agree with McCarry and cite the use of certain training films which serve to reinforce this belief. They perceive the program as one of subtle political indoctrination, in addition to the merely military phase which many disagree with as well.
