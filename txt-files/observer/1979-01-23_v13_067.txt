Pope may visit the Philippines 
MANILA, Philip~.ines (AP)-Pope John Paul II may attend an international re~ious med:;;nJ in the Philippines in December, according to Car · IJaime L. Sin, Archbishop of Manila. The Cardinal disclosed the possible papal visit at a news conference Monday to announce that the Archdiocese of Manila will celebrate its 400th anniversary next month. "I'm thinking of p<>ssibly going to the Philippines in December,'' the cardinal quoted the lope as tetlin~ him when he was last in Rome. Sin adde , however, "its too early to say he's definitely coming." About 84.2 percent of the 46 million people of the Philippines are Roman Catholics. 

Steeler fans run amuck in Pittsburgh 
PITISBURGH (AP)-Thousands of cheering football fans penetrated a defensive line of 500 policemen'and whooped thier way through downtown Pittsburgh after the Steelers' third Super Bowl victory. Police said heavy patrols using dogs to control the crowds, prevented a reenactment of rampages that left downtown office and store windows shattered and cars overturned after Super Bowl wins in 1975 and 1976. "This isn't bad compared to the others," said Police Inspector A.). Brozovich, who was sidelined for 60 days in 1976 with hts front teeth knocked out in a downtown victory celebration. "We didn't have helmets last time either." Preparation appeared to be the difference this year, as police· sealed off the downtown area well before the game was over to all vehicles, including trolleys and buses. Pedestrians were not stopped. 
Supreme Court decides to rule on Laetrile ban 
WASHINGTON (AP)-The Supreme Court, stepping into a medical and legal storm of controversy ,said yesterday it will decide whether the federal government may ban laetrile. The justices voted to study lower court rulings that permitted the substance's use by terminally ill cancer victims. The controversy swirllng around Laetrile, a derivative of apricot pits, is a highly emotional one because of modem medicine's failure thus far to conquer cancer. The justices' eventual decision may hinge on the privacy rights of cancer victims . whether the government may limit the treatments available to persons suffering from a disease for which there is no known cure. Government lawyers say the Laetrile ban is necessary to protect cancer vicums because the substance has not been found to be safe or effective. Opponents of the substance also have ar~ued that allowing Laetrile treatments could keep cancer patients from seeking more traditional therapies that have been proven partly effective. 

Psych Services changes name to reflect change in services 
by Renee Leuchten 
Dr. Patricia Crosson, director of the newly christened Student Mental Health Center, formerly called ''Psychological Services,'' stresses that the name change reflects a change in the services and treatment used at the Center 
More short-term therapy ses­sions are one result of the new concept which emphasizes mental health instead of the formerly emphasized illness of a client. Treatment was typically year-long, but now sessions are held each week as _part of six-week programs. Students use problem-solvmg, behavior modi­fication, and gestalt techniques in the sessions. 
In addition to treatment changes, the Center has developed an outreach{rogram for the prevention o ps}'ch­ological problems. The ftrst phase of the program employs ftlms and talks on alcohol given in the halls by Peggy Cronin, A.C.S.W.Cronin has trained a group of students to assist her in her work. The group, called SOAP (Students on Alcohol Pro­blems), needs more members, Cronin points out. 
The second phase of the out­reach program, to be imple­mented this semester, is destgn­ed to build closer contact bet­ween the center, hall rectors and their staffs. Hoping to sensitize the hall staffs to detect .Problems before they become senous, the center offers tapes on a variety of psychological problems studentf'

may have. These tapes will be available to students in the future by radio or telephone. 
The program, consistent with the community mental health movement of the past 20 years, is one which Dr. Crosson helped develop since she became direct­of the Center last July. 
About six percent of the ND student body used the center last year. Most students had problems with peer relationships, academic anxieties, depression, or alcohol or drug abuse. 
In addition to individual therapy, many students particip­ate in group therapy where they can relate their problems to another's. Dr. Crosson said the individual and group therap}' sessions deal more on the feel­ing-level than the skill-level. She added that most Notre Dame students already know the skills used in relationships, yet many ' are out of touch with emotions which guide the relationship. 

Severe emotional problems are not necessary for psychomerapy. Any student who wants profess­ional aid ih the area of personal growth may call the Center for an appointment. The staff includes clinical psychologists, an alcohol counselor and a consultant psych­iatrist.

Jersey tenement fire clain1s seven lives 
jERSEY CITY* N.j. [AP]-North­ern New Jersey's second tene­ment fire m three days killed five children and two adults yester­day, and police launched a man­hunt for an arsonist who may have torched the building in a personal vendetta. 
The fire brought the death toll to 40 persons killed in fu-es thought to have been deliberately set in northern New Jersey cities in the past six weeks, authorities said. 
A mother and her five children where among_ those who died when a pre-dawn blaze swept through a four-story brick builo­ing in the third such fire in the Jersey City ~enement since December. 
Victims were seen pounding_ on a window shortly before fire­fighters arrived,' but apparently were overcome by smoke when they tried to reach a fu-e escaJ?e, said Deputy Fire Chief Domimck Cardillo. 
''If they had stayed at the front window, we could have gotten them out. But when people are in a ftre, they panic," Cardillo said. 
As Jersey City police hunted a man seen fleeing the building, less than two miles away a demolition crew was looking through the rubble of a Hobo!Cen tenement, looking for two bodies missing after a fu-e on Saturdav that clained at least 19 lives. 
Tweleve persons burned to death in a Newark tenement on Dec. 7. Witnesses told police they saw a man running away from the building. No arrests have been made. 
1ersey City Police Detective Howard Shea said authorities knew of no motive in yesterday's fire but sus_pected it was the work of an arsomst. 
"We think it had to be an act of spite, a personal vendetta of some kind," Shea said. 
A woman resident, who asked not to be identified, told report­ers that shortly before the 2 a.m. fire she saw a man in a hallway carrying a blue container. 
She said the man threw the container against the stairs and ran from the building. 
"I ~ot my kids out of the building and started screaming,'' she said. ''When I turned around the stairs were on fu-e. '' 
Authorities later found the blue container. 
The suspect was described as a black male, in his 20's, of medium build. He was wearing tennis shoes, she told police. 
''When they fmd him, I hope they hang him," said one resid­ent who asked not to be identif­ied. "Don't use my name. I don't want him to come back to find me." 

Roche sets guidelines 
SU selection process begins 
Student Union Director Bill Roche announced the _process for selecting next year's director and comptroller. Applications for the positions will be available Feb­ruary 13th in the Student Union office on the third floor of LaFortune. 
According to Roche, the dir­ector has two primary functions. First, he is, "responsible for overseeing all operation of the union.'' The director makes appointments, sees that the budget is executed and directs the steering committee. 
Secondly, "the director must relate the unions activities to the rest of the campus. He must keep in contact with the HPC, dorms and Student Govern­ment." 
''The comptroller keeps the financial records and is charge of the disbursement of funds," Roche explained. 
Any sophmore, junior or senior in the undergraduate student body is eligible for the positions. Roche emphasized that anybody can apply. "The selection pro­cess IS not limited to students presently working within the union, Roche stated. He added that if a person is interested in the job they "should have some knowledge of the structure and overall workin~s of the Union. 
The applicattons are due Feb­ruary 20th and will be evaluated during the next week by the steering committee. The com­mittee is made up of Director Roche, Comptroller Maureen Carney, Social Commissioner 
John Bonacci, Services Commis-

Closed roads switch shuttle route 
Due to problems caused by the closing of roads at Saint Mary's and Notre Dame, the shuttle has been rerouted. The stops at Saint Mary's will be Holy Cross Regma, McCandless and Maaeleva. The bus will no longer stop at LeMans Hall. 
On Notre Dame's campus, the Nieuwland stop has been discon­tinued due to construction work in the area. During the day the ND stops will be as follows: Grotto-Library--Main Circle­Gortto. The evening run on ND' s campus will remain unchanged. The complete new shuttle schedule will appear in the Observer later this week. 
sioner Gary Luchini and Cultural Arts Commissioner Jerry Perez. 
Applicants will be interviewed following the evaluation period on February 27. On the next day February 28, the steering com­mittee will meet to make recom­mendations for the positions of director and comptroller. Four votes are needed to gain the nomination. 
The decision will then be sent to the Board of Commissioners for review. Members of the Board of Commissioners are Roche, Andy McKenna, Student Body Pre­sident; Mike Roohan, Student Body Vice-President; Jayne Rizzo Judicial Coordinator; Pat Mason, Student Government Treasurer; Chuck Del Grande, Chairman of the Hall Presidents Council (HPq and Dan Darfler, HPC representative. 
The final decision will be made on March 1 and the new director and comptroller will take office on April 1. Anyone with quest­ions may call the Student Union office.

Junior class finalizes plans for Senior Oass trip to Acapulco 
by Ellen Buddy Saint Mary's Editor 
The 1980 Senior Class trip is scheduled for October break, 1979 in Acapulco, Mexico. Julie Essig, Public Relations person for the committee said a final decision was reached in a meeting last Friday. The decision was based on surveys that were administered to the 
Junior classes on both cam­puses this past November and five bid letters that were sent tol various travel agencies in the Chicago and South Bend areas. 
The bid letters inquired about both Acapulco and Jamaica, the first and second choices selected by the Junior class. According to Essig, Forlow Travel Agency of South Bend provided the best package deal and price for either loca­tion. Acapulco was chosen because transportation is easily accessible and reasonably priced, and because side trips to various places of interest are available at minimal cost. Also influencing the decision was the possibility of accomodations in four person condominiums with kitchenettes on Acapulco Bay. 
''The approximate initial cost based on air fare rates at this time is $295, but this is ex­pected to increase due to sub­sequent increases in air fare between now and October. I would not expect the base cost to be over $32 5 , " Essig said. This price includes round trip motor coach between South Bend/Chicago, five nisht con­dominium accommodations and round trip air fare. It also covers extras, such as a cocktail party and border taxes. 
Juniors could choose among October break, Christmas vaca­tion and Spring break for a trip October as the ftrst choice. According to Essig the commit­tee debated the date owing to the fact that many athletic pro~rams and student teaching assignments take place at this time, excluding some student participation. The committee reviewed all three possibilities with respect to the situation. 
Christmas vacation poses the problem of bad weather, pos­sibly resulting in cancellation of flights. The scheduling of flights from major points of departure to accommodate stu­dents from various states was another problem. The latter problem would also cause dis­crimination in base costs. It was believed that Spring break 
was too close to Senior formal 
and graduation. It is also a time 
set aside for job interviews. 
Ultimately, October break pro­
vided the best dates. 
Essig said a deposit, due in the Spring, will be necessary to reserve a place in the trip. The amount is not yet available but will be .released as plans are finalized. 
Anyone with questions, com­ments or suggestions is encour~' aged to contact any of the four members of the Senior Trip committee. They are Julie Essig (4-1-4796), Mary Beth Hudak (4-1-5728), Pat Bryski (8760),or Erin Boyle (6841). ' 
During Break 

Maids Feel Chilly 
by Betsy Spinelli 
Campus maids worked in temperatures ranging in the thirties during the semester 
break because of a University effort to conserve energy. 
Thermostats were turnedd down to lOC in student rooms while warmer temperatures were maintained in corridors and lavatories, according to one employee. 
Many maids were unaware of the plans to keep temperatures so low despite efforts in the maintenance office to inform cleaning staffs. 
Rumors circulated among dorm employees as recently as yesterday to the effect that a breakdown in the boilers neces­sitated turning vff the heat. An authority in the central heating office reported that there was no such breakdown. 
"We were lucky," said a hot water to do the floors. Some buildings didn't and the ladies had to have their hands in cold water." . 
"I'm one of the youngest (maids) here," she continued, adding, "Some of the others are almost seventy ...and they're only working so they can eat. Two of them down­stairs caught cold. I just wish we had known ahead of time so we could have planned on it (the cold) ... you can't work when you're sick.'' 
Father James L. Reihle, rector of Pangborn Hall and director of energy conservation for the University, reported thiu there has been little difficulty with heat reduction in the past and he was unaware of prob­lems this year. Figures which will reflect the savings gener­ated by the measures to con­serve energy will be made available to Fr. Reihle in about

Sex and Equality: ND's Virgin Territory 
Many girls have told me that, in one sense, Notre Dame has been the best experience of their lives--the reason­ing being that "if we can survive all the put-downs and anti-female pre­judice here at Notre Dame, we can survive anything.'' They may not realize it, but many men around duLac share the opinion that if they can survive four years with the ladies of Notre Dame, then they can overcome any conceivable obstacle that might await them on the "outside." Why this basic dissatisfaction on the part of so many students? Can we do anything about it? Perhaps the following points have something to do with this situation: 
(1) 
Although many men ~on't like to admit it, we should recogmze that the average woman who enters Notre Dame is--by almost any standard we have of measuring Intelligence-­smarter than the average freshman male. This fact, together with the famous "ratio", tends to intimidate a great many men. 

(2) 
Next we come to the well-known problem of s~x~ality. _I'm not su~e any reliable stattsttcs extst, but I d be willing to bet the vast majority ofNotre Dame women are virgins. This is no crime in itself, but it might go a lo_ng way toward explaining the negattve feelings experienced by women at ND. As any male Domer will tell you if he's honest, the combination of (a) a relatively small number ofwomen. and (b), a strong tendency on the.p.artof those women not to blaze new tratls on the road to sexual liberation makes for a lot of long, cold South Bend nights. The fact that so many women should feel this way is due to a lot of things, especially 

(A) 
the ethnic-Catholic background of many Notre Dame women 

(B) 
the University:s at~empts to keep intersexual relattonshtps as un­natural as possible (single-sex don~s, parietals, the du Lac regulatton 


against pre-marital sex, the conscious attempt to hold down the number of female students) 
(C) a strong feeltng of insecurity on the part of many women, brought on by the inability of some ~D men to distinguish between havmg sex and making love. 
Still, we have to admit that although sex without love may not be the best, love without sex is definitely the "?-ost boring. Not only that, but tt may JUSt be that a freer sexual atmosphere here at ND will turn out to be the salvation of many Notre Dame co-eds. There are several reasons for this, and all of them deserve mention: (1) Sex is fun. 
(2) The myth that "sex ts. me~~ingful only in the context of marnage . ts first of all a relic of medieval moraltty, and secondly one of the those statements people never think about, but agree to only because "I've been brought up that way'' or because to do ~o requires less ''risk'' and less tntellectual energy than to consider any possible alternative. (3) Women have an interest in full equality, and sex.ual freedom is one aspect of that equaltty. History clearly shows that where women have been most sexually restrained, they've also :;u.ffered frof!l social and poliucal inequ:tltty .. Here It might b~ useful to e~amu?-e . t~e historical bases ofpre-manta! vtrgmtty and general sex':lal r~straint, and see tf we can determme tf ou~-dated prac­tices have anything to do with the problem at Notre Dame. 
Exami_>Ies abound, but I o~ly have time to mclude a few. Constder the institution of the dowry--in every society in whicL it existed, it was scarcely more than a bribe paid by ~he father of the bride to the prospective husband for taking his daughter (an economic liability) off his hands. The daughter ws expected to be a virgin because virgintty meant she was 
"undamaged goods." She was a chattel, a piece of property, given to the husband along will all the cattle, pigs, or whatever else went into the dowry. We all know, of course, that the dowry has gone the way of the horse and buggY., but the mentality that created it still lingers. 
Consider all Islamic societies, (even in our own day), where ~omen ~~ve traditionally been placed m a posttt?n of legal, political, and sexual submts­sion with respect to men. 
Consider Victorian morality. The typical bourgeois female of the 19th century was expected to find sex vaguely distasteful--something done in the interests of having children, or perhaps in order to satisry "his" animalistic desires, but certatnly not a pleasureable outlet for the woman herself. Again, restrictions on female sexuality found their way into other areas of life as shown in the absurd notion that ~omen were too "dainty", too "fragile" to excel in athletics. At the same time, Victorian society denied women the vote, and empha­sized the passive, stay-at-home role of the woman. So much for the historical validity of virginity. 
What has the Church's role been in all this? The Church has proved itself a veritable bastion ofconservatism and male domination. The same Church that preaches against the evils of p,re-marital sex and in favor of the 
'sanctity of marria~e" tells women they have no place m its priesthood. While other churches have been busy improving the condition of wom~n, t~e Catholic Church. has ~een p~ym~ .ltp service to equaltty while mamtatmng solid op,positton to any proi_>osal (such as the 'legalizaiton'' of artificial birth control for women in the Church) which misht put women on an equal footing wtth men. 
Of course, outside the Catholic church (and ouside ND), much pro­gress has been. made. Women. are entering the ma~nstre~ of Af!Iertcan life after centunes of tcequaltty. It should be noted, however, that on the "outside" women are generally more sexually emancipated than at Notre Dame. Is there any connection? I think so. 
The evidence of the last thirty years tends to indicate that sexual freedom and social equality go together. ~he revolution in sexual mores whtch 
began in the late 40's with the Kinsey reports has spawned other revolutions. Everywhere--in business, academics, athletics (look at the tremendous increase in womens' sports programs in the last five years)--women are insisting on the right to equal treat­ment. The inhibitions and social taboos against women acting with freedom and assertiveness (in all areas) are crumbling. 
Stifl, there are many women who insist they don't Want to be equal. They like things the way they always have been. That's thetr choice, but those women should realize that although they may be "satisfied" to a certain extent with their lives, they'll never be treated with true respect and esteem--only with condescenston. The same goes for women who say they want equality but don't do anything about it. Action is what counts. The way to abolish sexual inequality is to change attitudes, not laws, because law~; are only the outward expressions of established attitudes. 
T:1e key to changing attitudes lies in demonstrating the equality of wom~n in all respects, and the place to start ts the bedroom where the most important male-female interactions take place. Either women act like they're equal, or they' II never be taken seriously by anvone. 
Confronted with these facts, what should the typical Notre Dame woman do? Should she go to bed with every guy she meets? Probably not. Not only is that a good way to pick up all sorts of nasty diseases, but, even ~?re importantly, sexual hypera.cttvtty might cut into precious study-nme. 
Should she realize there are man 

Brian Hogan 
dimensions to sex beyond that found in marriage? Defmitely. Should she take Notre Dame officials seriously when they tell her sex belongs only in marriage? I'm not qualified to answer that question for everyone, but I have the sneaking suspicton that sexual freedom and social equality, like two 
o hand in hand. 


The Threat of Love 
I feel I owe a progress report to the 
many students who responded to an 
earlier column I wrote about a former 
Notre Dame student who is undergoing 
treatment at the Menninger clinic. 
I was able to see her again over 
Christmas. I was deeply moved by the 
change in her condition and th~ positi~e 
signs of growth. As she explamed, this 
has been a very difficult and painful 
period of her life; but she has been 
realizing a great deal about herself that 
she never appreciated before. 
As she herself put it: ''How much the support I have gotten fr~m my f~iends has touched me! I am even learmng to accept it... slowly but surely. This is something that does not, and has never, come eas!!Y for me. I ha':e never had ~oo much difficulty supportmg and lovmg others; but allowing others to do the same for me was qwte a different story. I am seeing now that I w~ really cheating people out of something_ they chose to do. I still have a lot of difficulty with it, but I am working on it." 
I have been haunted by her words ever since our visit. Why is it we have such difficulty accepting love? Well, for o~e thing, there is .something _very self-satts­fying about domg something for another person. We may be inclined to be more comfortable saymg, "You're welcome" than "Thank you." We would rather possess another's gratitude than have to admit, through humble thanks, how much we needed the love someone gave us. 
In support of this, we may quote the old saymg, "It is more blessed .to give than to receive." But, in so domg, we may forget that the saying wo~ks both ways. If it's more blessed to gtve than receive, then it would behoove us frequently to allow others to do the more blessed thing to us. 
If we really knew the truth about ourselves, we would rejoice that others gift us with their concern and love; we would gladly recognize our many de~ts to others--for life, love, support, healmg and sustenance. 
There is, however, a more subtle reason why it is hard for many of us. to accept gifts of love from others. ~g~n, it may be a truth problem; but this tune not that we think too much of ourselves, but too little. We may simply not believe we are worthy of being favored by others. Like my friend at Menninge(s, despite many attempts at healmg touches, some people still are going to go on feeling like lepers. 
It is possible for us to be threatened by experiences that call for thanks: They can simJ>lY intensify our feeltngs of unworthmess. When someone holds herself in such low esteem, e':en a momentary tendernesss can cause t~­iation and pain. Itmakes her feel gutlty. She believes she does not deserve to be loved or favored. Consequently, when it haf>pens, it's like salt in an open wound; 
Fr. Bill Toohey 

and there is a tendency to lash out at the 
person inflicting the hurt. 
We remember the girl in I Never 
Promised You a Rose Garden; and the 
dramatiac scene in Who's Afraid of 
Virginia Woolf? when Martha attacks 
her husband. She explains that she 
strikes out at him because, "He can 
make me happy and I do not wish to be 
happy. And, yes, I do wish to be 
happy ... and he has made the hideous, 
the hurting, the insulting mistake. ~f 
loving me and must be puntshed for tt. 
There is a fmal reason why accepting 
love can be such a problem. It's just 
downright frightening for many persons. 
To be loved means becomin~ vulner­
able, allowing soMeone else mto your 
life; and that's always ri~ky. Even t~ose 
dedicated to the helpmg professtons 
(priests, doctors, counselors, teachers, 
social workers) have difficulties here. 
I have known many priests, for example, who are quite comfortable as dispensers of services. They very con scientiously offer many acts of care and concern to others. But they never permit any reciprocity; they fend off people who attempt to respond with love of their own; they rule out all efforts of anyone else to enter deep within. 
There is a great danger in this one-way-street approach. Those who are content to love but not w be loved in return may find their love terminating at an abstraction instead of concrete indivi­duals. For there is no way one can follow Jesus' way of loving without seeking to evoke a response of love from each r>erson loved m the name of Christ. This demands a willingness to accept love as well as to give it. 
Many of us are afrai~ of being lov~d because it demands nsk and entatls danger. A thousand seminary walls have echoed with the words, "Whatever you do, men, don't let yourselves get emotionally involved! '' And yet the refusal ro become emotionally involved with one's people, as Je.sus w~, absolutely guarantees an meffecuve ministry. 
The challenge is profound ... in what­ever way each of us is called to follow the life-style of Jesus. He sou~ht ~o establish a deeply personal relauonshtp with all He met; He literally proposed a relationship of love. But Hts was the fully mature acceptance ofbeing loved in return: He did not elicit a self-serving or erotic response, and always channe~ed the response to His Father, whose lovtng presence He had come to manifest. 
Not an easy act to follow. But well worth strugglmg and praying for.
