Out for the season with injuries are these Irish defenders: Tony Capers (upper left), Ed Vuillemin (upper right), Jim Sheahan (lower left) and Bob Neidert. 
''That's just not my cup of tea. 
"I don't relish trying to outscore opponents in order to win," Ara says. "But under the circumstances, there's not much we can do about it since any normal progress on defense has been handicapped by the abnormal amount of injuries we have sustained." 
Ailing are linebacker Bob Neidert (broken collarbone and separated shoulder), end Tony 
Capers  (severed  Achilles  
tendon),  halback  Jim  Sheahan  
(torn  knee  ligaments),  

end-linebacker Ed Vuillemin (torn knee ligaments), halfback Ernie Jackson (bruised knee) and linebacker Jim Wright (torn knee ligaments). 
But on offense, things are healthy and productive. Notre Dame's Eleven Prolific Men are second in the nation in total offense currently with I ,612 yards gained in three games. The Irish have tacked upll8 points in their trio of outings. 
Running the show is quarterback Terry Hanratty who ranks fifth in two departments according to this week's NCAA individual statistics. T.H.H. has 796 yards in total offense and 738 yards passing. He has connected on 56 of 93 attempts ~r 60 per cent. 
The ND attack has Northwestern coach Alex Agase plenty worried. "If we hope to have success against Notre Dame," he says, "we're going to have to make them travel a long, hard road toward the goal line." 
The Wildcat mentor worked his troops hard on defense this week after scouts informed him the Irish used 41 different offensive formations in the first three games. 
Injuries have hit the Wildcats a I so. Starting halfback Ken Luxton will miss his second straight game with a back injury. Defensive end Ed Paquette also is on the shelf for a second consecutive week. He has a sprained ankle. Co-captain John Cornell has been moved to Paquette's position from left outside linebacker. Sophomore Joel Hall will fill in at Cornell's old post. Paquette will dress for the game, but Agase says he will see little or no action. 
The Wildcat backfield is composed of three senior lettermen and one sophomore. Quarterback Dana Woodring, left half Chico Kurzawski and fullback Bob Olson (no relation to ND's co-captain) are the vets. Mike Adamale, right halfback, is the rookie. 
Today's game is the first of seven consecutive years when these teams will meet. Beginning next season, they will face each other in six consecutive opening games.

Ara, Alex 
Reunion 

Set Today 
In 1 9 56 , Ara Parseghian became head coach at Northwestern after an unbeaten 1955 season at Miami of Ohio. AI ex Agase became Ara 's chief assistant that year following two seasons with Iowa State. 
In his seven years from '56 to '63, Parseghian compiled a 36-35-1 record, including four victories over Notre Dame in four attempts -30-24 in 1959, 7-6 in '60, 12-10 in '61 and 35-6 in '62. His last two seasons (7-2 in '62 and 54 in '63) were the last winning years Northwestern ever had. 
Agase took over when Ara departed in 1964. Alex has turned in report cards of 3-6, 4-6, 3-6-1 and 3-7. Those marks include a 38-7 loss to NO in '65 and a 35-7 defeat in 1966, Notre Dame's National Championship year.

This one should be Purdue all the way. 

"I like Purdue, too," says Cardinal catcher Tim McCarver, who gave you a winner in Notre Dame last week. "With 13 points, though, I'll take Ohio State." 
With 13 points, I'll go with Purdue. They should win by more. 

O.J. Simpson and company also are on the road for their game with Stanford. They should win, too. By a bigger_ margin than Purdue. 
Upsets? There could be a few, the same way there are each Saturday. 
I know all about that fine California defense, but I like Army to beat the Bears, Nebraska to tip over Kansas and Iowa to surprise Indiana. 
THE EAST 
Syracuse over Pittsburgh-Cover your eyes. 
Boston College over Villanova This is supposed to be BC's year. 
Yale over Brown Blue is a more soothing shade. 
THE MIDWEST 
Michigan over Michigan State--Wolves have too much beef. 

Notre Dame over Northwestern--Tim McCarver says the Irish can't miss. 
Illinois over Minnesota-Dal Maxvill says McCarver should keep his mind on baseball. 
THE SOUTH 
Miami over LSU-A case of two good defensive lines. 
Oregon State overKentucky Any time, any place. 
Tennessee over Georgia Tech-A tough hurdle for the Vols but 

they should make it. THE SOUTHWEST Oklahoma over Texas--Shake hands, fellas, and come out fighting. Arkansas over Baylor-Razorbacks may get a scare, though. SMU over TCU-Not if there was some way the Horned Frogs could scuttle Chuck Hixson. And Texas A&M over Texas Tech, Houston over Oklahoma State and Arizona State over Washington State. THE WEST Penn State over UCLA-Huskies show some signs of improving. Wyoming over Brigham Young-Both have had better teams. And Utah over New Mexico, Montana State over Idaho State, and Idaho over Montana. 
NFL 

The defense never rests. Not the Los Angeles Rams' any way. Nothing gets by 'em. Green Bay, on the other hand, always is at its best in a big one. This one is a big one and I'm going with LA. Those Rams are just too big and tough. 
In The Other NFL Games: Baltimore over San Francisco-Colts have convinced me, Unitas or no Unitas. St. Louis over Cleveland--Football Cardinals keep working hard here without paying any attention to the World Series. New York over Atlanta-Tarkenton says hello to his old boss, the Dutchman. Minnesota over New Orleans Although Vikings are hamstrung for & sound quarterback. Dallas over Philadelphia-Cowboys havt! been warned about a possible licking in this one. Detroit over Chicago-It's hard knowing which way the Bears will go. Washington over Pittsburgh-Jurgenson prevails. 
AFL 
Buffalo over Miami Bills arc better than they've shown. 
Oakland over San Diego-Raiders shooting for a record. 

New York over Denver-Namath rarely has a bad day at Shea Stadium. Houston over Boston-Oilers still upset about last week. Kansas City over Cincinnati-Bengals asre in a little too deep 
here.

Back Bill Kenealy and second row man Dick Carrigan were named All-Americas by the na tiona I rugby magazine "Scrubdown", and some campus rugby aficianados wilr argue that these two were not the best on the team: Captain Tom Gibbs, Jay Firoello, Pat Keenan, Bill Gormley, and Brien Murphy all performed outstandingly for last year's Irish.

The Selectors 
Both wire services rated Penn State No. 3 this week, yet the 

Nittany Lions arc Il-l-point underdogs to UCLA tonight. Just makes 
you wonder who ranks college football teams and how they do it. 
The Associated Press polls an undisclosed list of 50 sportswriters 

and broadcasters from across the nation. Each man picks his top IS 
teams. They receive points on this basis: 20, 18, 16, 14, 12, I 0, 9, 8, 
7,6,5,4,3,2, I. 
United Press International's ratings are determined by a 35-man 

board of college coaches. Each mentor picks a top I 0 with I 0 points 
going to the top team, nine to the second, etc. 
UPJ's selectors are chosen from seven geographic areas. They are: 
East: Tom Cahill (Army), Bob Blackman (Dartmouth), Ben 

Schw-Mtzwalder (Syracuse), Bill Elias (Navy), John Yovicsin 
(llarvard). 
South: Vince Dooley (Georgia), Charley Tate (Miami of Fla.), 

Frank lloward (Clemson), Paul Dietzel (South Carolina), Johnny 
Vaught (Mississippi). 
Rockies: Ben Martin (Air Force), Eddie Crowder (Colorado), 

Mike Lude (Colorado State), Tommy Hudspeth (Brigham Young), 
Lloyd Eaton (Wyoming). 
West: John Ralston (Stanford), Tommy Prothro (UCLA), Jim 

Owens (Washington), Bill Sweeney (Washington State), John McKay 
(USC). 
Southwest: Frank Kush (Arizona State), Darrell Royal (Texas), !Iayden Fry (SMU), Bill Yeoman (Houston), Frank Broyles (Arkansas). 
Midwest: ARA PARSEGHIAN (NOTRE DAME), Woody Hayes (Ohio State), Murray Warmath (Minnesota), Duffy Caugherty (Michigan State), Alex Agase (Northwestern). 
Midlands: Bob Devaney (Nebraska), Chuck Fairbanks (Oklahoma), Phil Cutchin (Oklahoma State), Dan Devine (Missouri), Pepper Rodgers (Kansas). 
The Shillelagh 
In 1930, William T. Cosgrave, president of the Irish Free State, 

presented a shillelagh to Notre Dame immortal Knute Rockne. The 
Rock immediately suggested that it be made a traveling trophy for 
the NO-Northwestern series. 
The Irish and Wildcats each came into the game 7-0 that year. 

Besides the shillelagh, it meant the National Championship. The Irish 
took both with a 14-0 triumph and copped their last two games for a 
I 0-0 season. Notre Dame has the Shillelagh 17 of the 24 game-years 
since then. 
The lncredibles 
You can believe this if you want. It's true, but oh so incredible. 

Sports Illustrated last week sent this department Dan Jenkins' account of the Purdue game with a note attached: "The enclosed material is from today's issue of Sports Illustrated. You may want to note or quote."
