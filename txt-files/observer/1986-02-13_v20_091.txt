In Brief 
A woman who said she suffered brain damage whep a garage door hit her on the head at a department store was awarded S2 million in damages Friday. Susan Berberian, 30, of Framingham, Mass., was walking out of a K-mart auto repair shop four years ago when a worker closed the door to one ofthe bays and it struck her in the head. K-mart said the award will be appealed. A doctor testifying for the store said he believed Berberian was faking her injuries. -AP 
It's beach party time at St. Vincent College, Penn., where students have decorated the campus coffee house with five tons of sand, 12-foot palm trees, coconuts and fishnets filled with artificial lobsters, fish and seashells. "It's so authentic, you can almost hear the surf splashing," said Barbara Bungard, a co-chairwoman of the event. Besides a good imagination, all that is needed for admis­sion to the party Saturday night are a college identification card, a pair ofsunglasses and a swimsuit, Bungard said. -AP

Is pay for plasma donations spending cash or blood money? 
The other day, I was paging through The Observer when my eye spotted an advertisement a little different from the usual pizza coupons and student government announcements. 
"Your plasma makes a difference," it read. The ad 
went on to explain how donated plasma is used to treat 
hemophilia, and how the red blood cells are returned to 
the donor's body. Strangest of all, the ad offered S7 
"Cash For Your Donation," plus an extra S4 with the ad. 
Not a bad deal, I quickly decided, and showing the ad to some friends, told them of my plans to donate that afternoon. To my surprise, they reacted with horror. "Blood money!" "You're selling your body for Sl1 !" "You blood prostitute!" they yelled, only half-kidding. 
I was so taken aback I decided to cancel my plans. It did seem a little unkosher to earn money for the "gift of life" that Red Cross bloodmobiles are constantly plead­ing for. 
But reconsider that ad. Eleven dollars is a lot to offer for one liter of plasma. "Worldwide demand for

24 hours, a donor can give up to twice a week, instead ot the eight weeks needed between full blood donations. The clinic has a few regular Notre Dame donors, who come in and study as they bleed, said Edwards. 
Another concern directed at the blood industry is that paid donations lower the quality of the blood pool, by giving incentives to malnourished or alcoholic per­sons. But the clinic is extremely careful in its screening process, Edwards said. "Our screening process is so tight up front.

In fact, demand is very high. Three million Americans a year need trans­fusions, and 19 in 20 will have one before they die. Only eight million people a year donate, according to the American Blood Com­mission, with one liter per donation. Severe accident victims and some surgical patients often need many liters. 
The problem is compl­icated by the fear of AIDS among donors, which has led to private "blood clubs" and directed donations, where you stock up your blood pouches in case you, a friend or relative gets hurt. 
Although AIDS-phobia has affected the blood supply, the fears are completely groundless. Even in cases where plasma is taken out and cells returned to the body, the liquid is kept always in sterilized plastic pouches which are only used once. Needles and tubes, to~, are sterilized and thrown away after the first use. 
At the South Bend plasma clinic, which is run for profit by American Plasma Systems, blood is withdrawn and centrifuged to separate the red blood cells from plasma, according to Greg Edwards of the clinic. The cells are returned through the same needle, which is kept in the arm during the procedure. Two liters are drawn off this way, one at a time, yielding one liter of plasma. The whole procedure takes about an hour and a half. 
Since the plasma can be regenerated by the body in returned to the body. Food and Drug Administration standards are very stringent, he said, and the standards of their pharmaceutical clients are even higher. 
Unlike the nationwide trend, APS's blood volume has grown. However, its 
Notre  Dame  and  Saint  
Mary's  clientele  has  
decreased.  Edwards  does  
not  attribute  this  to  AIDS  

fears but to "more money from Mom and Dad." 
For those who do have qualms about selling their body fluids, plasma for money is not the only way. The Red Cross regularly conduct blood drives at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. This spring they will be at the Notre Dame infirmary several times a month, including Feb. 19, 25 and 26. They will visit Saint Mary's April I6 and I 7. The or­ganization even set up a blood clinic in Alumni Hall last week and may continue to do this for other dorms. The Red Cross gets a good response on campus. "Notre Dame does supply a lot of our blood throughout the year," said a representative of the South Bend branch. 
Eventually, I decided that worrying about the ethical problems ofdonating for money was not a good excuse for not givinganytbtng. I just may show up at the infir­mary this Wednesday.

SMC Sophomore Parents'Weekend to be packed with activities, people 
By HELENE GOUDEAU 
News Staff 
A busy weekend of activities has been planned for this year's Sop­homore Parents Weekend at Saint Mary's College, according to Shari GiUig and Patricia Murray, co­chairpersons of the event. 
The price for the entire weekend has been set at S80, a S5 Increase from the previous three years. The increase was called for in order to 
cover  necessary  expenses,  Gillig  
said.  
This  has  not  affected  the  es­ 

timated attendance, however, which should be near 450 people, including parents and students, she said. 
Gillig added that there could be as many as 800 people because many students arc expected to bring dates. A fee of S.20 will be charged for any additional guests at the din­ncr/dance, she said. 
Because co-chairpersons have been appointed this year, there has yet to be any complaints or problems, said Gillig. She added everything has been running smoothly. 
The weekend's activities, slated for February 28 through March 2, will begin on Friday with registra­tion at the Angela AthletiC Facility from 2 to 6 p.m. Latecomers can register at Angela on Saturday from 9 
a.m. to noon. 
The highlight of Friday evening, however may be the sophomore class talent show, which will be held at Angela. 
Saturday's activities start with an optional sports event to be held at Angela from 9 a.m. to noon. 
For those who may be more cul­turally inclined, there will be a taste of the arts 10 a.m. to noon in the second floor parlor of the Haggar College Center. Sophomores will have their art work displayed throughout the area. 
In the Welsh Parlor at Haggar, the Women's Choir will provide perfor­mances at 1 0 and 11 a.m. 
Sister Campion Kuhn will add a new touch to the weekend this year by presenting a slide show and his­tory of Saint Mary's in the Chameleon Room at Haggar at 10:30 
a.m. and again at 11 :30. 
An Open House for all parents, faculty, and students will be held from 12:30 to 2:30p.m. at Angela. 
From 4 to 5 p.m., the sophomores will hold a special mass at the Church of Loretto. 
Amajor event ofthe weekend will be the dinner/dance at the Century Center from 6 p.m. to 1 a.m. A cash bar will be available from 6 to 7:15 p.m. 
Between 7:15 and 7:45p.m., Wil­liam Hickey, acting president of Saint Mary's, will give the welcome, along with Gillig and Murray. This will be followed by dinner, followed by a dance until 1 a.m. 
The weekend will come to a close Sunday with a brunch catered by SAGA, who is also catering the open house. 
The Century Center will cater the dinner which will consist ofchicken cordon bleu, mixed vegetables, salad and chocolate mousse.

December.  
Madhu Malik,  a  junior  who  

studied in Innsbruck, Austria last year, said, "Airports are the most sus­ceptible to such acts with everybody coming and going." 
Malik, a world traveler since age five, said she believes most airports do "thorough, thorough checkups." 
"But you never know when ter­rorists may strike," she added. 
O'Hearn said he noticed the air­port guards in Brussels, Rome and Milan carried machine guns. 
Malik also expressed some ap­prehension. "Middle Easterners make me paranoid when I'm travel­ing. I make sure I don't say anything to arouse them," she said. 
"I have nothing personal against them. I understand the abuses com­mitted against them, but I don't believe in violence." 
"Terrorism just creates more an­tagonism," she said. "Terrorists have no respect for human life." 
Terrorism

Daher said. 
"One day in 1948 the Palestinians 
were declared non-people," said 
Daher, referring to the 1948 declara­
tion of Israel as a state. "When they 
do seemingly crazy things, it is not 
difficult to explain." 
Terrorism is not a hobby, he 
added. "There's some deeper cause 
ofit ... We must understand that," 
"Who are terrorists?," Daher 
asked. "Teens, refugees, the under­
privledged, the undernourished, the 
under everything .... And some do it because they believe" in the Pales­tinian cause, he added. 
One ofthe problems of terrorism, Daher said, is that it "... breeds ter­rorism, and then multiplies it." 
Referring to a past Israeli attack on a Palestinian refugee camp, Daher said, "When they see their parents and brothers killed on a wall without any reason, terrorism is the normal thing (for the young)to do;" he said. 
Latin America also has seen its 
share of terrorist acts. 
Ricardo Araujo, a Notre Dame 
senior from Brazil, said he believed 
terrorism stems from political and 
religious reasons. 
"There is an explanation behind 
terrorism," Araujo said. "It comes 
from anger. The terrorists don't 
think they can speak out," he said. 
But terrorism cannot be stopped 
with violence, said Araujo. "You 
don't have to grab guns to fight ter­
rorism," he said. 
Daher agreed, saying "It's a mistake trying to Stop terrorism by force." 
A better method, Daher said, would be for the United States to treat Middle-eastern countries equally.

"There's no problem without a solution," said Daher. "There must 
be  concessions.  The  Middle  East  
doesn't  need  homogenity,  but  
equality."  

Referring to the close relations between the United States and Is­rael, Daher said, "Balanced support (by the United States) would much diminish the terrorist acts. The United States government could stop being ignorant or acting ig­norant." 
Without the support ofthe United States, Gilligan said, "Israel couldn't last one week ..." 
Yet the United States must have the support of other countries to counter terrorism, Gilligan said. 
"The United States could make it a lot more difficult for the terrorists with European help," he said. "But that won't happen at the present time." 
"Europe thinks we're going after the wrong-guy and in the wrong way;" Gilligan said, adding that Israel held the same view as Europe. 
"The United States says Khadafy is responsible for the terrorist acts in the Mediterrean in recent months. But Israel says the United States is wrong -it's Syria ... Maybe Libya is easier to push around than Syria," he added.

She said, "We want to serve our class in all aspects ofstu­dent life, academic, spiritual, and athletic, as well as social." She also stressed the need to build cohesive­ness within the class as well as bet­ween the junior class at Saint Mary's and the junior class at Notre Dame.

Associated Press 
HANOVER, N.H. Eighteen Dartmouth College students were arrested Tuesday when they un­successfully tried to stop school offi­cials from tearing down a shanty that had been erected on the college green as a symbol against apartheid. 
The arrests on criminal trespass charges capped three months of struggle between the school and groups ofstudents over roughly S63 million in the college's investments in companies that do business in South Africa. 
Hanover police led the students away in handcuffs as about 300 ot­hers looked on. 
The shanty, which was con­structed along with other shacks last November to protest the invest­ments, was loosened from its frozen moorings by workers using a jack­hammer, and taken away with a forklift. 
One of the 18 arrested also was charged with simple assault on a police officer. All were released on S500 personal recognizance bail, police said. 
The arrests occurred about 3 p.m., after protest spokesman Erik Ness told a crowd of gathering students that the Dartmouth Community for Divestment was trying to negotiate relocation of the shanty to another campus location but the administra­tion was refusing to cooperate. 
"They are not bargaining in good faith," Ness had said. "Through this, the college is not dealing with the issues of divestment and racism, they're dealing with the logistics." 
Dartmouth Dean of Students Ed­ward Shanahan said the college was negotiating the removal of the 
shanties with the group, but that 
group members on Tuesday said 
they did not have the authority to 
approve a removal proposal and 
asked for more time. 
"We were bargaining, but we weren't going to have a protracted discussion," Shanahan said. 
Many in the crowd sang "We Shall 
Overcome" and chanted their sup­
port. 
Police first arrested a group ofstu­
dents inside the shanty. A 
plainclothes police officer then told 
other students nearby that anyone 
wishing to be arrested should 
remain at the door. Police then ar· 
rested the remaining students. 
Before the faceoff on the green, 
grounds crews removed a second 
shanty from the lawn of the ad­
ministration building, about 100 
yards from the green. 
"I think It's wonderful," said Roland Reynolds, a junior from San Juan Capistrano, Calif., and the editor of the conservative newspaper, the Dartmouth Review. "It's Hanover's Grenada." 
Some of the independent newspaper's staff members, not in· eluding Reynolds, face possible dis­ciplinary action as a result of a sledgehammer attack on the shan­tytown in January. 
The sledgehammer attack, which resulted in no injuries, sparked a brief takeover of the administration building and a one-day suspension of classes. 
Last week, College President David Mclaughlin urged that the shanties had served their purpose and should be removed from the green by Sunday, the end of the col­lege's Winter Carnival.

Parietals offenders have been treated 'too fairly' 
I would like to voice my opinion of the "issue of the month" at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's, that is, parietals. 
I think we can all agree that parietals violators are morally deficient, depraved in­dividuals with a perverse desire to flaunt their opposition to any law, order and authority. But is the fault solely theirs? I propose that it is not. After all, the character of the majority of the students at Notre Dame is still in its formative stage. I therefore propose that there are other culprits who must not escape punishment. 
Liz Reeves 
guest column 
First, there are the offenders' families. It is from the family that children derive most of their social and religious values. Undoubtedly, at some point in the little deviant's childhood, his or her parents neglected to administer a severe beating when, as a child, he or she vi­olated some minor law ofthe household. As a result, the pitiful pervert, now a young adult, is completely incapable of existing in polite society. I recommend an immediate trial by jury of cardinals to decide the fate of these unfit parents, with a suggested punishment of the suspension of all visitation rights, a revok­ing oftheir driver's licenses and an immediate denial of suffrage. This, of course, is not to be interpreted as a minimum punishment, as each case will be judged individually. 
Second, there are the deans, professors, academic advisors and teachers who instilled who knows what repulsive doctrines in the tender hearts of these traitors to the Notre Dame community. I feel strongly, nay, I insist, that each individual who had any significant contaCt with or influence on these psychotic and dangerous young adults be required to present a full account ofany criminal offenses, traffic violations, sexually communicable diseases or contact with men with hair longer than their shoulder blades, to a board ofpsyc­hoanalysts. Also, they must report for a urinalysis, a blood test and a close screen for any knowledge of the Russian language beyond that which could be gleaned from the Sunday edition of the New York Times. 
Any individuals who can be associated with subversive activity shall be denied contact with minors for the rest of their natural lives, unless they agree to be lobotomized, sterilized and to accept a new identity, which will be determined by the staff of the North Dining Hall. This punishment may be suspended if the convicted party agrees to serve for the remainder of his or her life as a test pilot for the space shuttle program. Of course, none ofthese are to be interpreted as minimum punishments, as each case shall be judged individually. 
It is not fair to impugn exclusively the character of the above-named social groups. Therefore, I would like to make the ad­ministration aware of the possible involve­ment of any and all of the following: the offenders' childhood friends, pets, parish priests, roommates, section mates, the editors of their most widely circulated hometown newspapers, Dan Rather, the pope, and of course, the omniscient guru of the freshman class, Emil Hofman. 
And what of the offenders themselves? I do not feel that expulsion or suspension is a punishment which fits the crime. After all, if these young criminals are products ofsociety, is it proper or morally responsible for the ad­ministration to send these flawed, weak souls back to the dens of sin and iniquity from whence they came? I think not. 
Therefore, I would recommend a semester offorced labor during which period these las­civious schizophrenics can contempklte the gravity of their offense. Afterwards, they will be granted the opportunity to confess their sins and beg forgiveness from the Notre Dame community on the steps ofthe Administration Building. 
Ifthe student body, alumni, and administra­tion decide that the individuals have suffi­ciently debased themselves, they will be readmitted to the school, although the glaringly ugly account of their wayward steps will remain on their permanent record. If forgiveness is denied, they will be sentenced to a slow and agony-filled death in a glorious exhibition at the front circle, where their death will serve as a warning to the South Bend/Notre Dame community. 
This proposal is humbly and piously sub­mitted in the nineteen hundred and eighty­sixth year of our Lord on the campus of the University of Notre Dame du Lac. I hope and pray that these suggestions will be accepted in the same spirit in which they were made. 
Liz Reeves is in the Freshman Year of Studies at Notre Dame. ­
Memories of the 'Four Horsemen' still alive at ND 
"Your grandfather is one ofthe 'Four Horse­men ofNotre Dame!' " 
Words not uncommon to myself as I've grown through the years and now find myself a junior at Notre Dame. However, even though I've told and retold the story of a man famous in my eyes and in the eyes of many others, I've never grown tired of sharing his story of accomplishments and athletic ac­claim which constantly shadowed his love for Notre Dame. The man I speak ofis Don Miller, Notre Dame's former right halfback, who quartered in the infamous backfield known as "The Four Horsemen ofNotre Dame." 
Dan Thompson guest column 
It all began some 62 years ago when, "Outlined against a blue, gray October sky ..." the lives offour young men would be altered forever. The immortal words of the New York Herald-Tribune's Grantland Rice on that blue, gray October day coined a phrase which became legendary in the annals ofcollege football history. 
To capture the spirit of that year of 1924, one must understand that the Cadets ofArmy were considered "the powerhouse" of na­tional college football, aided by the effective military draft. Notre Dame, on the other hand, came out ofthe small town ofSouth Bend, Ind. led by the soon to be famous Knute Rockne. Wor~ of "tradition" and "reputation" were yet unknown to the Irish football program. But oh, what a tradition would be initiated on that October day. 
The matchup of the Army -Notre Dame game was expected to be nothing more than another Cadet rout, adding to their column of wins. However, the unexpected would occur and history would be made. Notre Dame prevailed that dreary fall day by a score of 13 · 7, a score which shocked the country. It was following this unimaginable upset that Grantland Rice, a South Bend reporter, sat at his typewriter and made famous the phrase "the Four Horsemen of Notre Dame." Hen­ceforth, the lives of these four young men

would be accompanied by fame and attention. The men comprising this quartet of Death, Pestilence, Famine and Destruction were El­mery Rayden at fullback, Don Miller at right half, Jim Crowley at left half, and Harry Struhldreher at quarterback. 
Rice's analogy of "The Four Horsemen" came from the four horses found in the book ofRevelation in the New Testament. The anal­ogy implies strength, unity and cohesion; similar were the attributes ofthese four young players. 
To continue with that immaculate season of 1924, the "Four Horsemen" continued to ride in glory. Onward the quartet galloped, defeat­ing the Cornhuskers ofNebraska 34-6. On the road to an undefeated season, the Fighting Irish of 1924 became Notre Dame's first na­tional champions after defeating Stanford in the Rose Bowl. 
Their careers at Notre Dame attracted na­tional fame and attention, yet leaving as graduating seniors, none could boast a future in professional football. The four men even­tually would be inducted into the National 
Collegiate Football Hall ofFame. My grandfat­
her was an all-American in 1924 and still holds 
the school career record for average yards per 
rush at 6.83. School records survive the others 
as well. Each ofthe horsemen pursued careers 
in college football coaching, with Elmer 
Layden filling the shoes ofthe infamous Knute 
Rockne until 1941. However, it was much 
more than their lives on the gridiron which 
made then men ofgreatness. 
I grew up not only with the legend but with the man. My grandfather, Don Miller, con­tinued to walk in those shoes ofgreatness, the shoes he stepped into some 62 years ago along with his three other companions and teammates. After finishing several years of coaching at Georgia Tech, he went on to get a law degree, and eventually assumed the Office of District Attorney in Cleveland, Ohio. Several years later, he became a district court bankruptcy judge. He and his wife Mae had a family ofsix, with five daughters and one son, Don Jr. Don Jr. was the only member of the ·immediate Miller family to attend Notre Dame, yet many ofthe same family line would come to find themselves under that same Gol-

den Dome. Miller graduates can be traced back, on a continuous line, from several years before my grandfather's nephew, Creighten Miller, who was an all-American halfback for the Irish in the 40s. The line has been long and continuous, until the point in 1986, where I find myself a junior at that same school upon which my grandfather brought greatness years ago. 
Shadowed by a love for Notre Dame, I have continually felt the presence of that spirit of the Fightin' Irish. I knew what college I wanted to attend even before I was able to ride a tricycle. Though many see Notre Dame as just another university among universities, there are just as many who hold it with a bit more esteem. For many, Notre Dame is and always will be a very special place with many special individuals. For me, the love for Notre Dame which encompassed me in my childhood, has only been reinforced and strengthened in my three years thus far. The memories I cherish and the friends I've made are things I attribute and hold as unique to Notre Dame. 
Many a time did I sit in my grandfather's haven of trophies, honors, awards and pictures and acquire the feeling that Notre Dame was different. Reminiscing aloud, he

told of actual happenings here which we know of today by history books alone. I still have memories oftimes I spent here with him, for example, his being honored at half-time and post-game parties with all the players at the Morris Inn. Often, we fail to recognize or realize what many before us have done here at Notre Dame. Often, we forget their efforts, leaving many unrewarded. Now, I've stopped to take several moments to thank my grandfat­her and his three comrades of that immortal quartet, "the Four Horsemen of Notre Dame." These were men of greatness, at least in my eyes, who brought pride, respect and great­ness to the University of Notre Dame. These are qualities and attributes which we still 
pride ourselves on today. 
The Four Horsemen are all but gone now, with the last of the quartet, Jim Crowley, dying on Jan. 15, 1986. Though they are no longer here making appearances and giving speeches, their memories are still alive and vivid. Even today, with the ever-present "blue, gray October sky," the "Four Horsemen" still ride in glory.

the same spot as the one at Lourdes. But wiser people closed It up so as to prevent wild rumors regarding it. It did not gradually 'lessen."' 
Father Daniel R. Jenky, Rector of Sat·red Heart Church, described the Gratto today as a place where "even non-church-goers feel they can go to to be quiet and pray." He said that the atmosphere Is "unselfconscious and unpreten· tlous, where normal, active people can share faith without it being a big deal." 
''PeopIe don't

God. God is

-Father Jenky 
FatherJenky noted the reaction ofa visiting Canadian priest to the enormous number ofstudents who came to the Grotto to pray, "At Notre Dame, there is still the atmo­sphere that gives people permission to pray without looking like they're doing anything weird." 
"It's funny to watch the tourists," FatherJenky continued. "They come with cameras, but then they don't take the picture. They realize It is more a place of prayer." He said that the he receives many letters and plaques of thanksgiving to mark

"On a cold winter night, it's one of the few places you can go to be by yourself, yet never feel alone." 
-John Bruening 
"It symbolizes that element that sets Notre Dame apart from other universities." 
·Jane Heisel 
.:Among other things, it Is a place of quiet, and a place that Is always available to students, faculty, anybody else that wants to stop in from town, for example. I think it's a place where people know that prayer Is welcome and devotion is welcome. To see somebody kneel In prayer, to have two students, boy and girl, kneel down next to one another and pray ... I think Is a very special type ofsetting. It's not quite the same as the church, which Is enclosed; this Is outdoors... I think It's very special because of that. You stop In very briefly and go on."

The Grotto 
What does the Grotto mean to you? 
Complied by Doug Anderson 

"I think the Grotto is a great place to go and be alone. It's too bad it doesn't get used during the semester the way it does the week offinals." 
·Joseph Wood 
prayers answered every year, but he 
cannot accept them. "The walls 
would be completely covered," he 
explained. 
The Grotto is different from a 
church in a theological sense. 
"People don't pray to Mary like they 
do to God," Father Jenky said. "God 
Is God, but with Mary, we ask her to 
pray with us to God. She is a symbol 
offaith, the first disciple." 
She is more than a symbol offaith 
to University President Father Hes­
burgh. He usually attends the 
Grotto every day. "I really believe 
that Our Lady watches over this 
place. I feel I ought to stop in and 
say thanks, and also pray that she 
keeps watching over this place," he 
said. "I usually get down there in 
the wee hours of the morning when 
I leave the office," he continued, 
"There is almost always someone 
down there, rain, sleet, or snow." 
The Grotto adds a unique touch to the Notre Dame campus in com­parison with other schools. Father Hesburgh said, "Every university has a place where students hang out for their social life, libraries where they study, and playing fields where they play sports, but how many have a praying place?" Although there are thiny chapels in the dorms and elsewhere on campus, the popular place to pray is the Grotto. 
Student response to the Grotto from the freshmen to the seniors is usually universal. Senior Gretchen Wroblewski remarked, "It is what Notre Dame Is all about. A lot ofus come here for careers, but one of my priorities is growing spiritually. The Grotto is a place to put aside classes and grades, an outward sign ofwhat life's all about." 
Freshman Kathleen Flynn said the Grotto makes her feel a part of Notre Dame. "I can stop on my way home from the 'brar. It makes me

"I just spent my whole night in the library, basically, with the books. 
It's good to get away from that and come someplace that's quiet, some­place where you can think about 
things that are more Important than your studies: the goal ofyour studies, why you're here at Notre 
Dame, the underlying reasons for everything. It's a place where everybody comes, and I guess that makes It something that I'd want to come to. It's just not the candles, it's just not the statues or things Jlke that, but I guess since it's just set aside as a special place, it becomes a special place for everyone." 
-Rob Raphael 
feel complete. It's not hokey· religious, just quiet and personal." 
The Grotto has long been the hosting place ofmany Notre Dame traditions. The Rosary is said there every day at 6:45p.m., even in the winter at temperatures of twenty below zero, by the Holy Cross community. There are alumni reunions and countless retreats held there. 
Also, the Grotto hosts the last visit ofthe seniors after a prayer service at Sacred Heart. The Glee Club sings, and the seniors recdve

their final blessing before they leave the University. "When it is over, the seniors just stand there for a long time," FatherJenky said, "Nobody wants to move." 
Due to the September 23 fire, caused by as many as I500 burning candles, which substantially damaged the interior ofthe stone structure, rocks ofthe Grotto have been chipped and scaled to give it a slightly new filce from the one it showed ninety years ago. 
The fiery reds and soft greens of the Ivy will grow back in time. The Grotto has survived almost a cen­tury ofNotre Dame history as an outward symbol of the peaceful refuge students and religious have found right on campus. 
Whether illuminated In sunshine, blanketed in white snow, or softly glowing with the flickering of candles In the night, this special place is a hallmark ofthe Notre Dame tradition. As Doctor Dooley wrote, do we students appreciate what we have, while we have It?

volved in recruiting violations and other scandals in recent years. 
In 1980, five schools from the Pac 

10 -USC, UCLA, Arizona State, 
Oregon and Oregon State -were dis­
qualified from the conference cham­
pionship for recruiting violations in 
football. According to The Los An­
geles Times, one booster at UCLA al­
legedly helped players obtain cars, 
stereos, clothes and airline tickets 
free or at large discounts, "and may 
even have financed abortions for 
girlfriends." 
Another recruiting incident was 
exposed at Texas Christian Univer­
sity in the fall of 1985. Head Football 
Coach jim Wacker suspended seven 
players, including All-America run­
ning back Kenneth Davis, for accept­
ing improper payments from 
boosters. Davis said the reason he 
chose to attend TCU was because of 
offers made in writing by boosters, 
which amounted to a guaranteed 
S38,000 in cash and goods. 
Charlie Dierker, the associate sports information director at TCU, claims that the University's athletic department was not at fault in the incident. 
"The school's position remains the same," he says. "What occurred was the doing of certain individuals independently. As far as we know, the only people who knew anything about the incident were the violators, some of the coaches, and the players themselves. 
"The football office has taken steps to eliminate anyone from the outside taking part in illegal ac­tivities. In the past they welcomed recruiting help from our two booster clubs through letters and phone calls. Now only coaches and select individuals will be allowed to recruit." 
Nevertheless, boosters around the country continue to tamper where they should not-offering pay­ments to college athletes and often arranging for grades to be juggled. And while the scandals will certainly follow, Notre Dame has chosen to stay away. 
Alumni donations at the Univer-Lauren Romeo and Colleen O'Connor each scored 10. 
"We were behind by six points at one point in the first half," Donnelly noted. "Probably the key to our coming back was the full-court press." 
Center Kathleen McDavid's tough defense underneath also was in­strumental in PE's victory. Accord­ing to Donnelly, the 5-10 freshman played extremely well. 
Lewis 'A' soundly defeated the 'B' team in the in-hall rivalry. Junior center Moira McGrath, who measures in at 6-4, led all scorers with eight points for Lewis 'A.' 
sity ofNotre Dame go directly to the general fund, and the Athletic Department submits a budget in the same way as the other departments of the school. Only in a special case, such as the building of the aquatics center and the new indoor tennis facility, would the University rely on additional funds. 
"An endowment fund would only be pursued if the University iden­tified an athletic need," says Con­klin. "All fund-raising is done by professionals. It would be a Univer­sity program and no outside group would raise the money." 
By .) keeping fund-raising activities under the control of University offi­cials, Notre Dame appears to have found the answer to the booster problem. Other colleges have managed to combine independent boosters and university control successfully. 
But one fact remains. With the growth of college sports into a big business and the competitiveness in recruiting players, boosters will continue to play a major role in the athletic programs ofmany colleges.

Radke leads SMC basketball team 
Grace remains undefeated in inter hall hockey 
By KELLY PORTOLESE 
Saint Mary's Sports Editor 
Acoach's dream. That is how Saint Mary's basket· ball coach Marvin Wood describes 
his  team's  leading  scorer,  sop­ 
homore Tammye Radk e.  
"Tammye  is  a  real  class  

representative for Saint Mary's Col· lege both on and off the court," says W<XJd, who coached Radke on an AAU team (which placed fifth na­tionally) the summer before they both came to Saint Mary's. 
"Tammye ha.~ a super attitude, is consistent and Is a very unselfish player. Her range as an outside shooter is outstanding. She's one of the two best shooters at our level of play." 
Currently averaging 16 points a game, Radke is shooting 5 I percent from the field which is second best in NAJA District 21. She Is also an ob­vious team player, pa.~sing out HI as­sists thus far in I 7 games. 
Last season, Radke was one of two freshmen ranked nationally· in the NAJA for free-throw percentage. In one I 5-game spurt in her first season as a Belle, Radke connected on 85 percent of her free throws, a mere 44-of-53 from the line. She finished her freshman campaign fourth in free-throw percentage and sixth in field-goal percentage in the league. 
Radke says she doesn't really place that much importance on her individual accomplishments but knows that when her performance is down, it affects the team.

In the battle of the interhall h<ll"key unbeatens, Grace (5-0) created scoring opportunities through sharp goaltending and ef­fective forechecking to edge Cavanaugh/ Howard, by the score of 4-2 last week. 
"Goaltender Phil Coghlan had his best game of the season, stopping many scoring attacks," said Grace player-coach Jim Radaczak. "Left wing Sam Dempsey, Lance Williams and the team as a whole were very effective." 
The scoring for Grace was evenly­

balanced as Dempsey, Joe McBride Mike Marino, and Steve Bishop each netted one tally, Marino with the game-winner. But it was the Grace team quickness and defensive pressure that created scoring oppor­tunities in the form of many shots on goal. 
"Cavanaugh/Howard played us closer than anyone we have seen yet," said Radaczak. "We won on the heart ofour team, not one man had a bad game. Because Mike Prender­gast, who had two goals against Oil­Ion, was injured, some guys double-shifted to take up the slack." 
Among those who pulled extra duty were Drew Spesard, Dan says the Regina resident, who was her high school's female athlete of the year. "If I'm taking bad shots it hurts the team. 
"I want to play the best I can to help our team win. I always try to give I I 0 percent. I'm the most excited when we win and the most disappointed when we lose." 
After finishing 4-16 last year, Radke would have to label it a pretty disappointing season. But according to Radke, the team's final record is no reflection of the coaching it recieves from Wood. 
"He's an excellent coach," says Radke. "I think he teaches more than basketball, which is something you don't find a lot in coaches today. 
"All his teams have been classy. Everyone ha.~ good sportsmanship. This is really important, especially at Saint Mary's where we have such a high standard." 
One of the consistent dis­advantages Saint Mary's teams have had In the past Is their lack ofheight. 
"For her size, she has been an out­standing rebounder," says Wood of the 5-6 guard. 
Radke obviously hasn't let her lack of height affect her play and sometimes even likes to pretend that she's a little taller than the roster says she is. 
"I love it when I'm going in for a rebound and catch the ball and shoot it without coming back down on the floor," explains Radke. "It makes me feel tall-which I'm not." 
Teammate Kris Pantelleria, a high school opponent from nearby Ben­ton Harbor, Mich., generously helps out Radke's cause. 
"I'm usually the one who misses the shot so she can put it back in," quips the junior guard. 
"She'll be messing around in practice with some unbelievable shots one week, and have them ;''down to perfection the next. She's very excitinjZ to watch." 
Although Radke may not tower over her opponents on the court, she definitely walks tall in the clas­sroom. Carrying a 3.59 GPA, the economics major hopes to attend law school in the distant future and possibly stuuy corporate law. 
Her coach apparently thinks she will be just as effective in the courtroom as she is on the basket­ball court. 
"She's a great student of the game," says Wood. "She reads defenses well and reacts to them in a positive way." 
Tonight the 7-10 Belles will make the five-hour trek to Franklin, Ind., where they will meet an always­tough Franklin College team. That is, if the team can stay healthy enough to play the game. 
"Our biggest opponent right now is illness," says Wood, who has about seven players battling the flu. 
Radke was a little under-the­weather on Monday night against Valparaiso, playing just 28-of-40 minutes and still managing to con­tribute 19 points. 
Tammye Radke's dedication to the game of basketball and to her studies defines the model student­AP f'holo 
athlete. And ifshe someday becomes Michael Ray Richardson of the NBA's New jersey Nets ties up a corporate lawyer, it's a safe bet Clark Kellogg ofthe Indiana Pacers in a game earlier this season. she'd be a good person to have on Richardson rejoined the Nets yesterday after a drug test imposed by your side. the team proved negative.

OC spotted Cavanaugh/Howard a two-goal lead, on scoring efforts by Chris Sulllvan and Grant Weidner. OC was able to cut its deficit in half on Jim Grow's goal, just before the end of the first period. 
The goaltenders took over in the final period, as countless goal­scoring opportunities were turned aside by both goalies. Pat Collins' goal forged the tie, thus keeping OC in second place behind Grace. 
Despite the tie, Cavanaugh/Howard coach John Oteri was pleased with his team's ef­fort.

"The team gave a great effort though we missed a couple of our players," said Oteri. "Andy Fena, our goalkeeper, played a superb game despite having the flu, and Jim 'Scarface' Meija was an emotional in­spiration." 
Keenan and Sorin, two teams playing out the season, met in a Cor­rigan League match as Keenan won easily 7-2. Sorin (0-5) scored the first goal but opted to play its own style of hockey the rest ofthe way. 
The game featured many penalties soon after the score was out of reach. Keenan, which had only eight players, was able to contend with Sorin's rugged play to post its second victory in five games. 
In other matches played, Zahm (3-2) eked out a 3-2 victory over Fis­her (2-3) to keep its slim playoff hopes alive. Pangborn ( 4-0) stayed tied with Alumni for the Corrigan lead by whipping Keenan 7-2.

Jordan hopes to play, waits for final decision 


Associated Press 
CHICAGO -Michael Jordan is eager to return to the Chicago Bulls' lineup this weekend after a 3 I /2­month layoff, but his agent says he thinks the acrobatic guard should sit out the rest of the season. 
David Falk of Pro Serv, Jordan's agent, told the Washington Post that he would prefer that Jordan, who broke a bone in his left foot during the third game of the season, not try to return until next fall. 
"We've gone back and forth with him about it and we've been harping with the Bulls' management too. But Michael won't listen. He's such a competitor that if he thinks he's ready to play, then he's going to play," Falk told the Post. 
Falk was out of town Tuesday and unavailable for comment, according to his office in Washington. 
jordan has been consulting with bone specialists in Eugene, Ore., and in Cleveland the past two days before reporting back to the team's doctor, Tim Hallen, a spokesman for 
the National Basketball Association 
club, said Monday. 
"Then we'll compare notes and 
make a decision," said Hallen. 
Jordan had said he was hoping he 
could play tomorrow against the In­
diana Pacers or Sunday when the 
Dallas Mavericks play in Chicago. 
But Bulls General Manager Jerry Krause said the doctors would have to say jordan's foot is ready. 
"If one of those doctors says it's not ready, then he won't play," Krause said in Dallas last Sunday. 
jordan, the NBA's Rookie of the Year last season, told reporters he was certain the Bulls would make the playoffs ifhe comes back healthy and plays the rest of the season. 
"I know what I can do," he said. "I 
won't let this team miss the playoffs." 
Without Jordan, the Bulls are suf­fering with a 17-34 record, but trail the Cleveland Cavaliers by only two games in the race for the NBA east's final playoff berth.

"Based on pure numbers we had good success with the linemen," said Holtz of his recruits. "We have only four defensive and eight of­fensive linemen on scholarship right now, so I'm concerned about getting through spring practice. 
"But I think you want to look for balance when you recruit. With our current fullback situation there was a question of quickness. Well, the two young men coming in (Braxton Banks and Anthony johnson) have quickness. And Rice can run it downfield and hand the ball to the receiver. 
"The linebackers have very good size and seem to run very well. It looks like the defensive linemen have quick feet, and the offensive linemen can run." 
This is a group of recruits whose names migt)t become familiar to Irish fans as early as next season. 
"I will definitely play freshmen," said Holtz. "I think that it's usually easier for a freshman to play at a skill position than anywhere else, but for now the important thing is who gets better next year."

Price plays key scoring role for Irish off bench 
By NICK SCHRANTZ 
Sports Writer 
Over the past four years, Notre 
Dame senior Joseph Price has had a 
habit of breaking out of slumps in a 
big way. 
The 6-S swingman had struggled since the DePaul and BYlJ games in January, not scoring much and seeing a drop in playing time during those eight contests. 
He ended that string with a 28­minute, 12-point performance that helped the Irish defeat highly­ranked Syracuse last Saturday. He continued his fine play by making four shots in only six attempts as Notre Dame routed Fordham on Tuesday. 
Price's mid-season slump is reminiscent of la.'it year, when the Marion, Ind., native averaged less than I 0 minutes of play and one point over the la.'it eight regular­season games. 
Once again, Price rebounded with superb play in the team's final games. He replaced an ill Ken Bar­low in the NCAA Tournament against Oregon State and helped the tl·am with 34 quality minutes and 16 points on seven-of-nine shooting from the floor. Two days later he poured in nine points in 25 minutes 
during Notre Dame's dose loss to 
North Carolina. 
Irish coach Digger Phelps knows 
he needs Price to remain hot if his 
team wants to continue playing well 
the rest of the year. 
"Joseph Price was overdue, and that's why I predicted he would have a good game against Syracuse," Phelps said. "That game really helped his confidence, and that is a key. He played very well last year in the NCAA Tournament, and we need him since that's only a month away 
now." 
Price agreed with his coach con­cerning his play against Syracuse and during last year's tournament. 
"The Syracuse game lifted my confidence because I really haven't played too much lately," Price said. "Playing well in the NCAAs last year really gave me a lot of confidence, and put a lot ofconfidence in Coach Phelps. I didn't play much at the end of last season, so it made me feel good to help the team like I know I can when they needed me. Those games really helped me mature as I headed into my senior year." 
Despite his mid-season slump, Price still remains Notre Dame's fifth-leading scorer with almost seven points per game. He has started two games, but most of his

In Michigan, Perles got linebacker Curtis Young of Kalamazoo and defensive back Vetson Donaldson of Detroit. 
Illini Coach Mike White signed 28 players including 1 7 from the state of Illinois. The other 11 were all from neighboring Missouri and In­diana. White's top prospects from Il­linois were quarterback Chris Ondrula ofSpringfield and offensive linemen BradJames of Lockport and Ed Pedersen ofDeKalb. 
"We set out to put our major em­phasis on the state," said White. "I feel the results justify the approach we've taken. We got the numbers we wanted and, if we evaluated properly, this will be an excellent class." 
Ohio State signed quarterback Greg Frey of Cincinnati, but Coach Earle Bruce went heavy on linemen in the home state. The list included 270-pound John Peterson of Mid­dletown and 265-poundJeffKuczek ofYoungstown Boardman. 
"I think we have done a pretty good job," said Bruce. "It was a good year for linemen and I think that's the emphasis we took." 
Minnesota's program was jilted and jolted when Lou Holtz opted to take his coaching philosophy and dry humor to Notre Dame. John Gutekunst, who replaced Holtz, has done an excellent job under the cir­cumstances. 
Gutekunst landed most of the players he wanted in Minnesota in­cluding running backs Darrell Thompson, Pat Tinglehoff and Ron Goetz, and · defensive lineman Bob Coughlin. 
Tinglehoff is the son of former Minnesota Vikings' all-pro Mick Tinglehoff. Pat rushed for 1,662 yards and 23 touchdowns and could step in as Minnesota's kickoff return specialist. 
Gutekunst also went to Florida for running back Marcus Evans and wide receiver Eddie Miles.

Notre Dame signs 21 B.S. players; Holtz pleased with his first recruits 
By LARRY BURKE 
AsststantSports Editor 
Irish head football coach Lou 
Holtz called the signing of offensive 
and defensive linemen "a prime con· 
sideration." He also referred to the 
establishment of a strong recruiting 
base in Chicago as "an absolute 
necessity." 
He achieved both those goals yes­terday, the official signing day for high school seniors. 
The Irish received commitments from 21 recruits, five ofthem Parade Magazine All-Americans. But more importantly as far as Holtz is con­cerned, 12 of them are linemen, and nine of them are from the Chicago area. 
Overall the Irish did not do as well as they could have. They missed out on some blue chippers in the last few days, like safety Mark Carrier (to USC), lineman Adam Cooney (to Washington), tight end Ed McCaf· frey (to Stanford), and defensive lineman Warde Manuel (to Mic· higan). But considering the cir­cumstances surrounding the post-season coaching change, Notre Dame fared quite well. 
"I can't really say what our needs are because I don't know our ath· letes that well," Holtz said yesterday. "But I'd say considering that (the new coaching staff) had to pick up in mid-stream, we did pretty well. Overall, I'm pleased, because these

young men chose Notre Dame for the right reasons. They have a realis· tic understanding of Notre Dame and what we expect from them. And I'm still head coach · I didn't promise that title to anyone in order to get them to come here." 
· As Holtz had planned all along, the Irish signed justone quarterback. He is Tony Rice, a Parade All-American from Woodruff, S.C. The other four Irish recruits on the Parade honor 
I 
roll are St. Rita (Chicago)linebacker John Foley, McKinley (Canton, Ohio) lineman Dean Brown, and St. Laurence (Chicago) linemen Jeff Pearson and Paul Glonek. 
Holtz might have had a few more names from that Parade list, but he went into the recruiting race several weeks behind because he needed time to assemble his new staff last November. 
"The late start that we got was critical," Holtz said. "Did you ever try to get a date with a girl a week before her wedding? I wouldn't advise you to make a living that way. You won't fill up your social calen· dar doing it." 
But Holtz, along with recruiting coordinator Vinny Cerrato and the rest of the coaching staff, managed to fill his calendar pretty well. Holtz' recruiting philosophy is to bring in new talent that compliments the present athletes. His first Notre

Boosters create controversy; none present at Notre Dame 
(Editor's note: Today The Obser­ver begins its two-part series on boosters and college athletics. Part one focuses on booster scandals and wby there are no boosters at Notre Dame.) 
By MARTY STRASEN 
Sports Writer 
"Booster." Just mention the word to the athletic departments at 20 dif· ferent universities and you'll hear 20 different opinions. Just one thing. Don't mention boosters at Notre Dame. 
Boosters, while not highly· regarded at Notre Dame, are an in· tegral part of the athletic programs at a number of colleges throughout the country. Without their support, many top contenders in college football and basketball would not have the financial ability to field quality teams. 
Essentially, booster groups raise funds for athletic scholarships in any number of varsity sports, help finance new facilities, and help ath· letic programs survive among the rising costs of college sports. But why are boosters nowhere to be found at Notre Dame? 
"First of all, we're in better finan­cial shape than in many cases," ex­plains Director of Public Relations and Information Richard Conklin. "Our football and basketball teams have large followings and our alumni support has been superb in the past." 
But there's something more to the 

Boosters& College Athletics 
story which has to be said, and it might be appropriate to introduce a new word "scandal." Some boosters seem to have a knack of overstepping their bounds and violating the rules laid down by the NCAA. This, perhaps above all, frightens the Notre Dame athletic department away from booster groups. 
"Early on, we saw the danger ofan independent group controlling such a thing as athletic funding under the University name," says Conklin. "They can be trouble, and there are so many scandals to back that up. Some gain so much control that they can pay the better part of a coach's salary. (The University of) Colorado was the biggest case. If you can't control them, they can get out of hand." 
What Conklin was referring to oc· curred in 1980 at the University of Colorado, when an independent booster group known as the Flatirons Club raised $200,000 to hire football coach Chuck Fairbanks. To accept the new position, Fair· banks had to break his contract with the New England Patriots. The Patriots sued, and a settlement for $200,000 was reached out of court. In essence, the booster club had bought the rights to Fairbanks and cancelled the penalty for breaking a 
contract. 
But the Colorado incident is by no means an isolated one. Boosters have become more and more in·

Irish swim past Belles, earn 8th win of season 
By ANDREA LaFRENIERE 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame swim team defeated host Saint Mary's by a score of 79-32 last night at the Rolfs Aquatics Center. 
Notre Dame coach Tim Welsh was pleased not only with the vic­tory, which improved the team's record to 8-2, but with the addi· tional experience his swimmers received in preparation for upcom­ing championship meets. 
"We had the chance to try some events we hadn't swum before at this meet," he said. "We used several opportunities to prepare for upcom­ing events by swimming either over or under our primary distances." 
Despite the defeat, Saint Mary's swim coach Nancy Jo Kuzmitz was satisfied with the Belles perfor­mance. 
"It was fun," she said. "We got some more optional times qualified for Nationals, and that helps us a lot." 
The Irish started out on top, sweeping first, second and third places in the first event of the meet, the 200-yard medley relay. In a combined effort, senior Julie Boss, sophomores Hollianne Logan and Nancy O'Brien, and freshman Tracy Johnson finished first with a time of 
2:02.01. The team of sophomores Elizabeth Genega and Sharon Von· Dolman, and freshmen Erin Daly and Kelly Quinn took second place for Notre Dame. Juniors Katie Traxler, Suzanne DeVine, Monica Walker and 
P.J. Amberg completed the sweep for the Irish by placing third.

ND is not lowering standards to recruit Rice 
Under normal circumstances it would not be unusual for Notre Dame football fans to take notice of Tony Rice after the high school phenom signed a national letter of intent yesterday to play his collegiate ball here under new head coach Lou Holtz. After all, the star quarterback from Woodruff, S.C., is a Parade Magazine All-American and one ofthe highest-rated passers in this year's talent-laden pool of prep players. 
What is a bit unusual about the amount ofattentiQn Rice has been receiving on campus and in the local press is that it has nothing to do with his ability to throw the pigskin. 
In case you haven't heard, Rice is reported to have scored only a 640 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test. 
So what, you say? Isn't a 640 on either the Verbal test or Mathematical portion a relatively typical mark for a Notre Dame student? Yes, but this 640 is a combined score. Recent NCAA legislation requires all athletes to record a minimum score of660 on the SAT to remain eligible. Rice, who will receive a scholarship no matter what happens, therefore will retake the exam March 15. 
At many schools, such as Florida or Miami or SMU, the boosters would be losing sleep while they waited and worried about Rice's eligibility. At Notre Dame, however, a school that prides itselfon its squeaky-clean image in inter· collegiate affairs, the worrying is centered around academic standards. Is Notre Dame, a long-time and vocal 

Marty Burns 
Assistant Sports Editor 
supporter of tougher NCAA regulations, forming a new recruiting approach? 
Not a chance, says Holtz. 
"We would certainly never want to do anything that would jeopardize Notre Dame's reputation academically," said Holtz. "That's what makes Notre Dame great. Here the players have to be true student-athletes." 
It would appear, nevertheless, that Rice has been a lot more of an athlete than a student over his high school career. On the field, the 6-3, 200-pounder has passed for more than 7,000 yards total offense (40 touchdowns), while rushing last season for 934 yards and 21 touch· downs. In the classroom, Rice scored a less notable 2.65 grade-point average and the aforementioned 640 on the SAT. 
Holtz, however, emphasizes that Rice is not a special case, and that the star player completed all the necessary requirement& established by the undergraduate admis­sions office. 
"We had our coaches look at his academics to see if he could get in here," said Holtz. "He has taken all the subjects that everybody else around here has taken, and he has received excellent grades. To my knowledge, he's a good student. And I'll tell you, he's a real class young man and a very intelligent young man. He's a Notre Dame man and he'll blend in very well with the student body." 
Perhaps the most important thing to keep in mind is that Holtz will never have the final say in determining an ath· Jete's admission. The final decision, as Holtz himself is quick to point out, rests with the Notre Dame administra­tion. 
"I don't have anything to do with admissions," noted Holtz. "The admissions people do an outstanding job wit­hout me. I'm not even familiar with Rice's SAT scores. I do know, however, that there have probably been few who have made a more favorable impression on their visits to this university than Tony Rice. He impressed everybody that he met." 
An interesting note to the issue came from Irish basket­ball coach Digger Phelps, who disclosed that some of his players from previous years also would not have been
