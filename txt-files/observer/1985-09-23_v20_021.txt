A Roman Catholic priest accused of supplying young people with cocaine, marijuana and alcohol at his suburban Detroit rectory has pleaded innocent to the charges, state police say. Father Neil Kalina, 30, ofSt. Kieran Church in Shelby Township, in Romeo, Michigan, was freed on $12,000 bond Friday after arraign­ment on one count of delivering cocaine, two counts of marijuana possession and two counts of providing alcohol to minors, said Trooper Curtis Schram.

Medical issues in the media: more harm than good? 
From the National Enquirer to Newsweek, nearly every publication isscreaming the same message. AIDS. 
We are deluged with pictures ofRock Hudson weeks before his death and graphic descriptions ofhysteria in Hollywood and the local grammar school. 
And lost somewhere in the degrading photos and screaming parents are the patients and the problems. We read, or can read, as much about AIDS as we care to stomach, but chances are, few ofus have gained any real understandimz ofthe nrohlem or its solution. 
It's not the first time an illness has been used to sell magazines. 
A few years ago eating disorders -anorexia nervosa and bulimia -were·the darling of medical media. We were treated to pictures of an emaciated Karen Carpenter and dozens ofpseudo-informative articles in woman's magazines. 
In many cases these articles did more harm than they did good. Although the media is exploiting AIDS vic­tims, the press cannot spread the disease itself. You

and deal with the problem. Residence halls may request an educational workshop, focusing on proper eating habits as well as eating disorders. 
Students need not parade up to the third floor of the Student Health Center to get information. Counseline now has tapes available on eating disorders, for those who aren't sure ifthey have a problem or would just like some information. Students also may call and discuss their concerns and questions with Thompson or anot­her staff member. Callers will not be required to give

Eating disorders are "a problem that will be with us through the 80s," said Thompson. "It's a big, big problem on campus." 
It's also a problem that Notre Dame is prepared to deal with. Thompson, who has been treating patients with eating disorders for six years at Indiana University, is one of many qualified stall members at Counseling and Psychological Services willing to help students with eating disorders.

Student government starts own 'ad agency' 
By GREG STOHR 
StaffReporter 
Notre Dame Student Government has announced the creation of Ad­works, the Notre Dame Advenising Network, an agency which will spe­cialize in all types of advertising for student organizations. 
Student Government hopes that Adworks, originally the idea of Bob Vonderheide, former editor-in-chief of The Observer, will alleviate what it believes to be the inability of stu­dent organizations to adequately publicize campus events. 
"In the past, for a lot of events, there has been a lack ofcoordination in publicity," says Student Body President Bill Healy. "When Bob Vonderheide presented the idea to us last semester, we jumped at it." 
Vonderheide had noticed the in­eptitude of groups trying to publicize events through The Ob­server and felt a need for a new body to c:oordinate student advertising. 
"You have to have a professional approach," he said. "There is a cer­tain amount of skill involved. It ( Adwork.'i) works like an ad agency." 
Headed by junior Frank Vidergar, Adworks presently has a staff of ap­proximately 15. 
It now answers to the Notre Dame student government but Vidergar and Healy hope that Adworks will

"I have as my goal to become autonomous," Vidergar says, "but it may not happen this year." 
Adworks' budget of $2500 comes partially from Student GovernmelU and partially from the Office of StU­dent Activities. Vidergar says he hopes only to cover the budget, not to milke a large profit. 
"It's a business, but we still look at it as a service to the students," the business major says. "We will make very little profit because we will keep our rates really low." 
Though Adworks has yet to work with a medium other than The Ob­server, Vidergar plans to utilize posters, Scholastic magazine, radio, and perhaps The South Bend Tribune in the future. He expects that a growth in business volume will allow Adworks to explore these other media. 
The professionalism of Adworks, Vidergar thinks, will make it benefi­cial to student groups. 
"Our people have marketing ex­perience," he says. "Lots of our artists have worked in advenising agencies before."

SMC computer ability to expand 
By KATHY CEPERICH 
News Staff 
The basement of LeMans Hall will house a new computer center at Saint Mary's, which will be operative next semester according to As­sociate Professor Peter Smith of the Saint Mary's Mathematics depart­ment. 
Terminal labs, microcomputers and computers will be included in the east wing addition. 
Last spring, on the suggestion of Dr. Mark Bambenek of the Chemistry department, a petition was sent to the administration re­questing the additional machines. "They indicated to the administra­tion that they needed more micros on campus. The need had (already) hr.-n recognized and it (the peti­

tion) served as additional impetus," Bambenek said. 
"We needed the space, it was a planned process. We had already planned to do it when the petition W".IS submitted," said Smith. 
Additional Zenith 158 terminals, new printers and a new prime com­puter will be purchased, according to Smith. 
Bambenek said plans are under­way to increase the power and capability of the present computer mainframe. 
Previously a room in Madeleva Hall held the computers. The move is being made mainly to give addi­tional space. 
Some of the terminals will be available to the students 24 hours a day In an overnight facility and the rest will be available from 8 a.m. to II p.m. 
Students had been complaining about the shortage of computers, especially the Apple Maclntoshes. According to juniors Leigh Ann Hen­ricksen and Colleen Walker, "There is a justifiable demand for Macln­toshes. To write a paper one has to wait 2 to 3 hours. They (Maclntoshes) are so easy to learn that the number of users is growing faster than the number of machines." 
"The administration Is trying to develop a long range policy for com­puter use (and) what we're seeing now is that they're starting to imple­ment the policy. The computer lab at Lemans Is one stage. Ultimately the entire computer operation wlll move into that area," said Bam­benek.

Development director chosen by Saint Mary's 
By DIANE SCHOEDER 
StaffReporter 
Fundraising at Saint Mary's has a new leader with Becky Drury named as Director of Development by Vice President for College Relation, 'Lawrence Durance. 
Drury is responsible for oversee­ing the annual fund and alumni fund, as well as direct mail campaign and state planning, she said. 
Because Saint Mary's is relatively new at fundraising; Drury said she was attracted to the challenge and "newness lends itselfto molding." "I like to be a part of something new and essential to the college," she said. 
The development department has several new goals slated for the 1985-86 school year Drury said, commenting that the most impor­tant and underlying goal is to build an endowment at Saint Mary's com­parable to that of other woman's private colleges. 
Assistant Vice President of Col­
lege Relations, Anne Reed, stressed 
the need to compete with private schools, such as Smith and Holyoke, which have been raising funds for a much longer period oftime. 
To begin with, Drury is initiating two new fundraising programs. The Saint Mary's class of 1961 will be the first class involved with the reunion gift project. In celebration of their 25th anniversary, an anonymous donor has agreed to put up 10 thousand dollars ifthe class can raise 40 thousand by the first week of June, Drury said. 
Also initiated will be the National Endowment for Humanities Grant. Both programs are brand new this year and Drury said she is looki~g forward to the success and .con­tinued growth ofsimilar fundraising programs. 
"I hope to begin to develop and refine the methods of solicitation and to deliver the message to a broader base ofconstituents," stated Drury, who sees fundraising as a business. One way in which she plans to carry this out is by hiring the Institutional Development Council to organize solicitation funds. 
CHAMPAIGN, 11. -Flanked by huge banners reading "Keep America Growing," singer Willie Nelson and cavalcade ofother stars yesterday braved pouring rain to perform in a marathon FarmAid concert aimed at helping the na­tion's struggling farmers. 
"Thank you very much for com­ing to the concert for America," shouted Nelson, the driving force behind the 14-hour concert featur­ing some 50 stars ofcountry music, rock and blues. 
As a crowd estimated at 64,000 filed into the University of Illinois football stadium, Nelson and Neil Young teamed up to sing "Are There Any More Real Cowboys." Nelson then brought cheering fans to their feet with "Whiskey River." 
Nelson said a nationwide televi­sion and radio audience was cal­ling pledges in at a rate of S500,000 an hour. Singer Brenda Lee, who emceed the program for cable television, said about S3 mil­lion was pledged by late afternoon. That was in addition to S4 million promoters said was raised before the concert began. 
Nelson has said the concert's purpose was to raise money to help needy farmers and to increase public awareness of farmers' problems. 
"We want everyone to call in from 'Surf City' or wherever," lead singer Mike Love of the Beach Boys, told the audience. 
Music styles ranged from the rock of the Blasters to the country ofGeorge}onesandfrom the blues of B. B. king to the classics of Roy Orbison. Carole King played a white piano on the front edge of the stage with the FarmAid curtain as a backdrop. 
As darkness approached, John Fogerty -formerly of Credence Clearwater Revival -had the audience clapping and dancing, and told them, "Next time you sit down to a meal remember it didn't come in a cellophane bag from Safeway, some farmer put his whole life into growing thatfood." 
A steady rainfall began shortly after the concert opened at 10 a.m. The stage, with a rotating center disk for quick act changes, was covered with a blue plastic roof but puddles still formed and crew members armed with mops tried to keep up. 
Some concert-goers covered themselves with sheets of clear plastic, while others huddled beneath umbrellas or hooded rain­coats.

"A once-in-a-lifetime thing like this, how could you miss it," said Ken Lewis of Bloomington. "What's a little rain. We'll dry out tomorrow." 
Tom Parkinson, a University of Illinois spokesman, estimated that about 64,000 people were in the stadium at mid-afternoon, but said the number could climb as more concert-goers arrived. 
Despite the rain, the crowd rocked as X sang "Breathless" and swayed as Arlo Guthrie did "City of New Orleans." 
About 500 people received medical treatment by early evening, and at:J.other 300 were ex­pected to be treated by the time the concert ended at midnight, said Dr. Alan Baird, co-director of emergency services for the con­cert. 
"We just had minor cuts, scratches, twisted ankles," he said. Baird said marijuana use was widespread. 
Soon after the concert began, country singer Hoyt Axton got some of the rain-soaked audience up and dancing with "Joy To The World," then was joined oy Tanya Tucker. By then, television cameramen on stage had their video equipment wrapped in yel­low plastic to keep it dry. 
Reagan cautions U.S. against 'false hopes' 
WASHINGTON President Reagan, warning against "false hopes" about his upcoming summit with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbac­hev, said Saturday the meetings could "bear fruit" if Moscow is serious about superpower coopera­tion. 
"The Soviet Union frequently has been bent upon expansion," Reagan said in his weekly radio address. 
"Indeed, since the 1970s, the Soviet Union has been engaged in a military buildup which far exceeds any rational definition of its defensive needs." 
Reagan said that "given the Soviet nature of the Soviet system and its ideology, we must not raise false hopes." 
Speaking from his retreat at Camp David, Md., the president noted that he will meet Soviet Foreign Minister Edward Shevardnadze for the first time on Friday, a session Reagan said has "special significance." 
The meeting is to prepare for the Nov. 19-20 summit meeting in Geneva, the first U.S.-Soviet summit since 1979. 
In his meeting with Shevardnadze, the president said he plans to raise the issues ofhuman rights, the Soviet invasion ofMghanistan, and bilateral concerns such as trade and security matters, as well as U.S. efforts to ac-

hieve "genuine, verifiable reduc­tions" in nuclear arms. 
The president said he will "search for signs of a Soviet willingness to engage in genuine give-and-take," with the summit in mind. 
"The differences between com­munism and democracy are profound," Reagan said. "There will inevitably be competition between us. But it's the responsibility of the leaders of the United States and the USSR to ensure that this competition is peaceful." 
Reagan said that in the meetings he intends to protect Western inter­ests, but also do his part to improve relations and tell Shevardnadze "how genuinely we wish this meeting to bear fruit." 
"If there's comparable serious­ness and flexibility on the Soviet part, cooperation between our two great nations will be enhanced," Reagan said. 
The president slammed the Soviets for following policies that have "inflicted bitter costs upon the Soviet peoples every week," which he said included a mounting death toll among Soviet soldiers in M­ghanistan and a decreasing standard ofliving at home. 
"Mr. Gorbachev can change this," 
Reagan said, advising the Soviet 
leader to shift scarce resources from 
arms purchases to strengthening the 
economy.

Premier Fabius admits of French involvement in sinking 
PARIS Politicians and newspapers Saturday criticized President Francois Mitterrand and Premier Laurent Fabius for not clear­ing up allegations that a government espionage agency was responsible for the bombing of the Greenpeace environmental group flagship, the Ra.inbow Warrior. 
Greenpeace campaign coor· dinator Steve Sawyer pressed the French government to accept "moral and financial responsibility" for the bombing following Fabius' admission. 
"We hope this will open the eyes of world public opinion to the fun· damental immorality that lies at the base of the international nuclear arms race," Sawyer said in a state· ment from his headquarters in England.

AUBURN, Ala. ·A corporate jet and an ultralight one-man plane collided yesterday, killing two people and in· juring five in what federal officials called the first fatal collision involv· ing an ultralight. 
The planes collided as they ap· proachc:d for landings at Auburn-Opelika Airport, said Herb White, a spokesman for Auburn Uni· versity. The University owns the air· port. 
The ultralight pilot, who was killed in the crash, apparently did not have radio contact with the air· port, White said. The co-pilot of the

Defense Minister Charles Hernu resigned Friday in the scandal over the July 10 bombing in Auckland, New Zealand, which sank the Rain· bow Warrior before it could leave on a protest voyage to the French nuclear testing site in the South Pacific. 
Later that day, Adm. Pierre Lacoste, head of the General Direc­torate for External Security, was fired after refusing to answer ques· tions about the incident. 
French newspaper headlines Saturday read: "Hernu Sacrificed," "The Minister Leaves, The Mys~ry Remains," "The Truth Still Awaited ....

jet also died, said Lee County CoronerJon Williams. 
The accident was the "first fatal collision involving an ultralight and an aircraft," said Ira Furman, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board in Was­hington. 
Ultralights usually are one-person aircraft with open cockpits and small engines, descended from hang-gliders powered by tiny engines. Their popularity increased rapidly in the mid and late 1970s, and by 1981, it was estimated there were 6,000 ultralights in the United States. 
The jet, owned by Louisiana· Pacific Corp. of Conroe, Texas, was "upside down in the grass on the side of the runway," said White. 
Five people injured in the crash were treated at East Alabama Regional Medical Center, said Sher­rill Lewis, a spokeswoman for the hospital. 
"One of them is critical, two of them have fractured spines, one is in surgery and one was released," she said. 
She said the injured were relatives of an Auburn student to whom they were delivering furnishings from home. 
Williams identified the ultralight pilot as B.). Tidwell, of Auburn.

Mitterrand, who earlier in the 
week ordered a shake-up of the spy 
agency over the scandal, has 
remained personally untouched by 
it. New reports agreed he was un­
aware of French involvement in the 
attack until a week after it occurred. 
However, Serge July, editor ofthe 
newspaper Liberation, said the 
Greenpeace affair is "a time bomb 
that still risks exploding at the door 
of the presidential office." 
Jean-Claude Gaudin, president of 
the Union for French Democracy, in 
the National Assembly, said, "The 
forced resignation of Messrs. Hernu 
and Lacoste leaves the problem of 
the truth and the real responsibility. 
"Mr. Mitterrand is the chiefof the armies and Mr. Fabius is responsible ,for defense," he said.

Jacques Toubon, head of the con­servative Rally for the Republic party, said Fabius should explain why, as head ofthe government, "he is incapable ofdirecting the affairs of France." 
The Communists also went on the attack. Poliburo member Charles Fiterman said, "Given the dimension this affair has taken, it appears dif· ficult to me that the highest aut­horities of the state were not informed." 
Two french espionage agents are under arrest in New Zealand, charged with murder, arson and conspiracy, and three others who fled to France are being sought un­der international arrest warrants. 
Staci Harris of Clay City was named outstanding drum major and Lafayette Jefferson's drum­mers were named the outstand· ing percussion unit in the competition. Northview's flags and rifle corps won an award as the oustanding auxiliary unit.

Burfords arrested on DWicharges 
WASHINGTON · Former Environ· mental Protection Agency ad­ministrator Anne Burford and her husband, Robert Burford, an Interior Department official, were arrested on drinking-related charges late Friday night, officials In suburban Virginia said. 
Mr. Burford, director of the Bureau ofLand Management, was ar· rested by Virginia State Police after they saw his car stopped In the middle lane of a highway outside Washington. He was charged with driving while Intoxicated and refus­ing to submit to a breathalyzer test. 
Two hours later, shortly before 1 a.m., Mrs. Burford was arrested by Arlington, Va., police on a charge of being dnmk In public after making a scene at the Arlington County Detention Center, jail officials said. 
Mrs. Burford was in the car with her husband at the time ofhis arrest, according to C.W. Grant, a spokes­man for the state pollee. 
Arlington County Sheriff James Goodies said Mrs. Burford was rin· ging a button that buzzes deputies inside the jail. She also insisted loudly over the lobby intercom that she be allowed to see her husband, and repeatedly said she was a lawyer who knew her rights. 
Arlington police officers even· tually tired of Burford's behavior, Goodies said, and arrested her. "I would describe her behavior as abusive," he said. "Drunk-in-public charges are not very common anymore. You almost have to ask to be arrested." 
Gondles said Mrs. Burford was cooperative after she was arrested, but two hours later she "became a problem" while inside her cell. She was banging her shoe on the cell, and when a deputy went to inves· tigate, he was "scratched up" by Mrs. Burford, Gondles sald.

CO ec S mmy nomina lOllS and awards in 37th presentation
AaMM:Jated Press 
PASADENA, Calif. -"Cagney & Lacey," CBS's once-canceled policewoman show, and "The Cosby Show," the series that has sparked NBC's drive for top ratings, dominated the early awards at the 37th annual Emmys yesterday. 
"Cagney & Lacey," which stayed on the air only because of a massive letter-writing campaign, won as best dramatic series -upsetting NBC's much-non*ated "Miami Vice"-and took awards for best direction and best writing. 
Tyne Daly, as Mary Beth Lacey, won best dramatic actress for the third straight year. 
"Every year I come expecting to hear someone else's name called," she said. "I think it must be the part I get to play." 
But NBC, which has topped the rating'!! for 16 of the past 1 7 weeks, dominated the awards with eight of the first 15. It led the nominations with 125, more than double the to­tals for both CBS and ABC. 
"The Cosby Show," new last season, won best comedy writing for Ed Weinberg and Michael Leeson and best direction for Jay Sandrich. Bill Cosby, the star and driving force behind the show, rejected a nomina­tion, saying he didn't believe in com­peting against other performers, and boycotted the ceremony at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium. 
"So much ofmy work is shaped by Bill Cosby's wit and philosophy of what a family could be," Sandrich said in accepting his honor at a faster-paced, restructed awards show televised live on ABC. 
William Daniels, the heart sur­geon Dr. Mark Craig on NBC's "St. Elsewhere," won the award as best actor in a dramatic series. 
Betty Thomas, Sgt. Lucille Bates on NBC's "Hill Street Blues," won best supporting actress m a urama, but was upstaged when a prankster accepted the award for her, saying she couldn't be present -even though the camera had plainly showed her in the audience. 
"Well, it is definitely hard to fol­low an act like that," she joked, when she finally took the podium after a commercial. 
"Miami Vice," a pastel and neon blend ofcop show and music video, won best supporting actor award for Edward James Olmos as the stone-faced Lt. Martin Castillo. 
"Yes, Lieutenant Castillo does smile," Olmos said. The show, which had the most nominations with 15, won three technical Emmys announced earlier, but lost the first two awards for which it was eligible. John Addison's music for CBS's "Murder, She Wrote" beat Jan Hammer's "Miami Vice" score and Karen Arthur won the dramatic directing Emmy for a "Cagney & lacey" episode, defeating two "Miami Vice" nominees. Robert Guillaume, the star of ABC's "Benson," whose character has progressed from manservant to lieutenant governor, won the award as best comedy actor. "I know you can't tell, but I just lost my color," the black performer joked. "This certainly beats going home empty-handed for a sixth time, and I'd like to thank Bill Cosby for not being here." The women comedy performers were both repeats from last year: Jane Curtin, as the more insecure of two roommate divorcees on CBS's "Kate & Allie," was best actress, while Rhea Perlman won supporting actress for her portrayal ofthe tough barmaid Carla on NBC's "Cheers." "Twice is really a lot to be up here!" Miss Perlman exulted, con­cluding with a greeting to her hus­band, former "Taxi" actor Danny De

John Larroquette, who plays Dan Fielding, the pompous, woman-chasing prosecutor on NBC's "Night Court," won best supporting actor on a comedy series. 
"Hill Street Blues," which has dominated the Emmys the past four years, was eclipsed by "Miami Vice" in this year's Television Academy nominations, 11 to 15. Both "Hill Street Blues" and the NBC musical special "Motown Returns to the Apollo" had 11. 
FRANKFURT, West Germany ­Former Nazi SS soldiers welcomed a group of U.S. World War II veterans to a controversial reunion yesterday and agreed to continue their decade-long friendship despite criticism from Jewish leaders. 
As television cameras whirred, 2 5 veterans of the U.S. 70th Infantry Division and their wives hugged and shook hands at Frankport airport with three veterans of the 6th SS mountain Division. The two divi­sions fought each other in the Battle of the Bulge in France near the end of the war. 
"This is no official joint reunion or celebration; we're not trying to create a precedent or a confronta­tion," said Floyd Freeman, a U.S. veteran who organized the Americans' two-week visit to Ger­many and France. 
"We are just meeting our friends by choice as individuals," Freeman said. ·

atrocities. 
In response, the U.S. group called off its traditional get-together with the German veterans at a French cemetery but said they still planned 
to  meet  informally  in  the  small  
Bavarian  spa  town  of  Bad  
Windsheim later this week.  

"This is the only year a fuss has been raised. Maybe it's the 40th an­niversary (of World War Il's end), the memory's fading and some people want to jog it," said Delyle Omholt, president of the 70th In­fantry Association. 
"We're here to check out old bat­tlefields, meet friends. We do respect criticism, and that's why we're now going to the cemetery alone. We ofcourse do not condone Nazi atrocities." 
Wilhelm Gottenstroeter, director of the SS veterans organization, in­sisted the annual encounters with former enemies were meant to nurture friendships and "have not­hing to do with politics." 
Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal earlier this month cabled the U.S. veterans group urging the meeting be canceled. 
"The SS will use it as a sign of reconciliation," he wrote. "Your meeting will become an offense for tnillions of victios of Nazi oppres­sion." 
Neil Sandberg, a top official in the American Jewish Committee, said last week that the Waffen SS, the tnilitary arm of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler's elite guard, "included large amounts of people who ran ... con­centration camps." 
Willi Weiler, an SS veteran who greeted the Americans at the airport Sunday, said his division had nothing to do with the death camps and was never accused of atrocities at the Nuremberg war crimes trial in 1946. 
Nevertheless, Gottenstroeter said 
any meetings with the U.S. veterans 
during their 1985 visit ''will be in 
private settings to avoid any 
disputes or trouble." 
Two 40th-anniversary reunions of 
Waffen SS veterans last May 
prompted violent street demonstra­
tions outside the meeting places. 
Jewish and veterans groups in the 
United States protested President 
Reagan's visit in May to a German 
military cemetery where SS mem­
bers were buried.

Big Red Q Quickprint Center is changing its name to Express Press of Indiana, Incorporated effective May 6th 1985 
Our franchise agreement with Big Red Q Quickprint has come to an end, and we determined that our customers could be best served by becoming an in­dependent Quickprinter. This decision was made because we have developed into a larger company than a typical franchised Quickprinter, with more diver­sified printing, typesetting, and high speed copying skills. We now possess in­house the talent to provide everything !hfi1 franchise did formerly -without the extra financial bu~den of the franchise royalty payments. Needless to say, this will help us maintain our keen competitive edge well into the future. 
During the past year, in addition to completing our new facility here in South Bend, we have opened a second location in Michigan City, Indiana, upgraded our typesetting equipment to Compugraphic's newest, finest state of the art equipment, added a new printing press that allows us to print 2 colors on the­sheet at once, and have just installed a high speed copier that will copy one or both sides of the sheet, collate simultaneously and do it very rapidly, allowing us to extend some very special prices for your multi-original, short run copying, booklet, manual, or legal brief. 
So when you see the new Express Press sign, and hear us answer the phone "Express Press" remember we are moving ahead in Quickprinting even further. 
We appreciate your business and look forward to serving you better in the future.

What do these three personalities have in

hams at heart and dare to different. Norms 
fall by the wayside when they arrive. 
The young men living on the first floor in the northeast corner ofCavanaugh Hall approached their quest for attention in a novel way ·with the now rather well-known "Quote ofthe Day" in their window. 
"We had to live by the.rector so we thought we'd have some fun," said junior Chris Thompson, creator of the window attraction. "We decided to take advantage of our position and do something weird · at least amusing." 
Thus, the "Cavanaugh Quote of the Day" was born. "Each night we go through a list of quotes we have and pick our favorite accord­ing to our mood," explained sophomore Mark Hannon, a member of the quote crew. "We began with about 1 5 ofour own quotes and now we use ones suggested by people 
The Observer/Paul Pahoresky 

"The quote that has received the best 
response is: 'When the load get'> tough, the 
tough get loaded,' "said sophomore Mike 
Ricker. "We had people yelling and clapping, 
and banging on our windows that day." 
Student response to the daily inspirations 
has ranged from "quite amusing" and "pretty 
entertaining" to "offensive" and "sexist." 
SeniorJoe Creely, who lived in the room last 
year, feels that the quotes such as "Women. 
can't live with them, can't shoot 'em." arc 
"infantile and a very poor reflection on the 
hall and its members." He added emphati· 
cally, "I think it is a disgrace to the legacy of 
the room.'·' 
Thompson has found that the majority of 
audience reaction has been positive. "One 
guy told us to take it (the quote) down and 
one girl told us we were being sexist," he 
said. "But, we've had people cheer and even 
had three girls come in and introduce them· 
selves because they wanted to see what kind 
ofguys would do something like this." 
What did these girls find? Three sop· 
homores and a junior who "like doing weird 
things," and as one of their quotes says, 
"Never let schooling interfere with educa­
tion." 
Spectator participation is encouraged by a 
sign next to the quote that says "Suggestions 
and crowd response welcome." Hannon said 
this request has led some students to bang on 
the windows and complain when there is no 
quote, because walked out of their way to see 
it. Some suggestions have been offered but as 
Mark said, "We do have to be selective." 
When the quote of the day is one that 
might be considered offensive, like Friday's 
"Smile· it's the second best thing you can do 
with your lips," 'lbompson said he sits and 
watches to see how women react and 
sometimes asks a woman what she thinks. He 
added that only one woman has told him the 
quotes are offensive. 
Other women students who read the quotes say they have been offended at times but usually enjoy the quotes. Freshman Ros Winner said, "I enjoy it when they are funny but when they aren't, it offends me because some ofthem degrade women." Theresa Henley, also a freshman, said, "They are really funny sometimes and sometimes they are offensive but it's their right to put whatever they want in their windows." 
Some men who read the quotes feel strongly that the quotes are too often sexist. Joe Creely said he would be extremely insulted ifhe was a girl passing by the quote. 
But freshman John Sullivan said quotes like "Everyone has to believe in something. I believe in having another beer" are "meant to be taken lightly. They aren't aimed at anyone in particular. If names were used, that would be offensive and really rude." 
Freshman Laurie Bain agrees with a smile, "Keep it up!" 
Keep it up the quote crew will do ·only six days a week, though. Laughed Hannon, "Even God rests on Sundays."

Town votes to dump Rolls-Royce 
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -A man donated a $25,000 Rolls-Royce to 
Palm Beach County, and officials 
promptly voted to dump the classic

The freighter Mercedes I, which ran aground last November, was hauled away and sunk March 30 as a reef. 
So Palm Beach officials decided to work toward forming their own artificial reefs, valued as prime sport fishing and diving spots.

Wedding-take 2 

MANSFIELD Woodhouse, England -when Mark and Sandra Kerry got married two months ago, their wedding pictures got lost in the mail. 
So on Saturday, they staged it all again -complete with 200 guests, including friends, relatives, four bridesmaids and the vicar. 
The vicar gave permission for the photographs to be taken inside the Anglican church, St. Edmunds at Mansfield Woodhouse, a town in the English Midlands, just as they were in the real ceremony. 
A florist sent a replica bouqut:t of the original 24 red roses carried by the bride. 
The couple, both 21, said they had to contact all the original 200 guests to tell them of the wedding. 
They said the envelope contain· ing the original photographs came back torn and containing no pictures.

f Offers 'concrete' ways to build a better campus 
When is something going to be done about our government's deficit spending? Solutions seem to be on every politician's lips, but when it comes to voting for these measures, the voices fall silent. 
Ken Kollman no easy solutions 
James Fallows, in the September issue of "The Atlantic", addresses what he calls "The Three Fiscal Crises": the budget deficit, the trade deficit, and the unbalanced borrowing from other nations. He ties them together and shows how the connections between them create an enormously complicated issue which necessitates quite a bit of belt­tightening. 
In very simplified terms, the currentlevelof borrowing that our country does just to pay

off its debts drives up real interest rates, which

Michael Iallacci 
the troubadour 
I know what some of you are thinking: the monument will be a big and hulking monstrosity that will ruin the intimacy of the little sidewalk cafe and forever hinder our view of the library. I believe these are the sacrifices we must accept if we wish to be a major university. I firmly believe that the benefits from the grandeur of the sculpture will far outweigh any of its perceived aes­thetic defects. I myself think that it is far more aesthetically pleasing than a smaller, more delicately crafted design. Grandeur, after all, is a sign of modernity. Allow me therefore, to give a few examples ofits benefits. 
First, the monument would provide never­before-imagined photo opportunities for alumni visiting on football weekends. As it stands now, all the prime locations for a scrap­book shot are greatly overcrowded. There are just too many people who stand by the dome and the library. This lovely fountain will divert some of this overflow and force fewer alumni to wait in line. 
Second, it helps fill an embarrassing gap in the University's outlay. I am afraid the con­crete sidewalks were not enough to give the area the aesthetic delight ofa proper campus. The area was too empty, too devoid of some contribution to the University. Too much grass was showing anyway. The campus ha5 too much grass as it is (and it is so time­consuming to have it cut). Some people have suggested a garden with real flowers be planted as a fitting memorial. Such people have only a myopic vision ofa university. Such things are old-fashioned and frankly, too sen­timental. Concrete is the way for a truly progressive university. It is sleek, clean, easy

become unnaturally high because the ex­change rates on the invested foreign money is higher than normal. 
With the value ofthe dollar so high, our ex­ported goods are more expensive to foreig­ners, contributing to our ballooning trade deficit. It is a cycle that does not meet back at the starting point, but rather goes up a notch every time, spiraling to incredible figures. 
With the present federal deficits lingering at approximately five percent ofthe country's gross national product and a projected 1985 trade deficit of U 20 billion, there remains little doubt as to the existence of what the House Budget Committee has said "may be the final and most costly burden placed on future generations." 
Reagan and his fiscal policies only pass along the economically painful solution to another administration. Fallows says "Reagan's supporters contend that his ad­ministration 'has restored confidence and patriotism to a nation that lacked them. Maybe so, but it may be remembered longer for con­ditioning us to the free lunch." 
to maintain and very "modern." Add to this the sight of concrete columns hulking over the sidewalk cafe, and I am sure you will agree their impressive stature and imposing gran­deur will more than compensate for the tri­fling simplicity and beauty that is sacrificed. _ 
Third, ofcourse, the Universityshows quite advanced thinking by adhering to the whole phenomena of memorials. A university can never be great unless it honors its dead mem­bers by the standards that befit them. The old type of memorials were not quite successful. The memorial crossroads fountain is a touch­ing but ineffectual gesture. One canwalk right by it without realizing the stature the man was held in. The Rockne Memorial, though im­pressive, is too mundane. Rockne's honor is besmirched daily by its use. Even the various statues on campus are too beautiful and too delicate to evoke the proper griefand respect the dead deserve. No, the modern monument must be impressive, completely useless and utterly ugly. 
The Shaheen/Mestrovich Memorial is anot­her example of Notre Dame's progessive spirit. The great sculpture's works themselves are not impresive enough to honor the man. They were too simple, too subtly beautiful to truly show Mestrovich's genius. It took a master stroke to put all those sculptures toget­her, giving his works a bold, overwhelming focus. Distributing them across campus would only have dispersed the beauty all over the University. The true genius came, however, in modernizing the whole memorial by the impressive concrete foundation. The wonderful sign, I think, is also impressive. No one can walk by without thinking, "this is a memorial." Even the benches give an almost sacred air, like pews in church. The new memorial will serve to develop more fully this theme, and add a more imposing grandeur to the campus in honor ofthe dead. 
Yet I hope the University·with its spirit of modernity does not stop here. Much more work must be done to bringfame and honor to the University. I see potential, for example, in the whole concept of memorials themselves. There is plenty of grass in the South Quad, used for nothing but recreation, which could 
This burden is not reserved solely for the future. It also is costing us a great deal today. Our current aftluence is in return for a lower standard ofliving in the future, but it depends on our spending a large part of what we have now for the interest on what we borrowed in the past. 
Four out ofevery 10 dollars collected in in­dividual income tax dollars goes for premiums on Treasury bills. A man with the same percentage ofdebt, let alone interest on the debt, would have declared himself bankrupt several times over. 
One area to find a solution might be attack­ing the trade deficit. Calls for protectionism against foreign competitors are growing in­creasingly loud, and economists cannot agree whether this will be beneficial to the economy, or just another band-aid remedy by some of our shortsighted Congressmen and lobbyists. 
By far the most widely accepted solution is balancing the federal budget, a task that only gets more difficult every time Caspar Weinberger and Tip O'Neill open their 
easily be the site ofa World War II memorial. Say, why not honor all the dead? We can find some grassy knoll somewhere to honor the dead of World War I, the Spanish-American War, the Civil War, the Boxer Rebellion and the Hough Riots. The possibilities are im­measurable and as long as grass remains, we at least should consider the possibility of memorializing someone. 
I have a few other modest proposals, that if you grant me an ear, I would like to share with you. We should turn O'Shaughnessy into offices for the New Institute for Scholarship, Notre Dame Magazine and the Commission for Excellence in Education. Any great univer­sity has committees working to solve the many problems of university life and they should be given optimum space and facilities so they can research these problems more ef­fectively. 
We would not need that many classrooms anyway. We could just decrease the total number ofclasses and increase total class size to, say, a thousand. We could thus take advantage ofsuch places as Stepan Center, the stadium and the ACC for classes. They are un­derused now as it is. This would solve the problem of class size by making them all uni­formly gigantic and by giving the professors fewer distractions as they work toward publication. 
By the way, the idea of a student-faculty lounge is ludicrous to me. At agreat university

mouths. Yet drawing on Walter Mondale's ex­perience, no sane politician ever will call for a tax increase ofany substantial size, at least not in the near future, and we all can see how dif­ficult it is to cut spending. One balances a budget by either of these two methods, and progress in both directions is at a virtual standstill. 
So where does this lead us? Fallows gives us few answers. What he does do is put too much of the blame on Reagan. No doubt, Reagan deserves a large share of it and history will most assuredly grant him his portion. But what about the voters, Congressmen and lob­byists? 
In effect, we are all to blame; an uncom­fortable outlook by any standard. After all, voters like getting $1 00 ofdefense and social benefits for S80. Our grandchildren, however, are not going to like this burden, for they are the ones who will suffer for our shortsighted­ness.

students are too busy gettinggood grades, and 
professors are too interested in getting 
published to really learn anything from one 
another. We are no longer so naive as to think 
learning is the real reason for the existence of 
a progresive university. 
The sooner we realize money is the true mark of success, the more successful we as a university shall become. The University has al­ready made great strides in this direction but, I believe, they still fall short. Thus I propose to make better use of the library. We don't have enough books to fill up the whole thing anyway. Let us consolidate all the books from the 4th to the 8th floor and convert the upper floors into a combination meeting room, luxury hotel-restaurant (with all the enter­tainment unknown in South Bend). This way. Father Hesburgh can more easily and ef­fectively wine and dine rich alumni to in­crease the endowment. And if he is lucky, to get someone to donate another memorial. 
I hope that I have offered some thoughtful insight into Notre Dame's future. I further hope that in all seriousness you consider these proposals for what they are. You will agree, I am sure, with their spirit ifnot their content.

P.O. BoxQ 
Explains reasons for survey's responses 
Dear Editor: 
·1 Ellyn Mastako's article in the Sept. 17 issue 
of 'Inc Observer revealed that students at 
Saint Mary's believe homosexuals are dis­
criminated against on both campuses. It fur­
ther showed a large majority of Saint Mary's 
students don't want additional information 
about male and female homosexualtiy. Could 
it he these two findings are linked, maybe 
even as intimately as cause and effect? 
The basis of discrimination is fear, and fear 
has it roots in lack of knowledge. By this, I do 
not mean to infer that Saint Mary's women 
have a monopoly (or even partial interest) in 
fear and ignorance. They are but a sample of 
the American population which, in general, 
would just as soon not be reminded that 
homosexuals exist, much less take the effort 
to learn more about homosexuality. 
My contention is most people are afraid of 
homosexuality. '!bey may be afraid ofhaving a 
gay or lesbian roommate/neighbor, or they 
may he afraid of being approached by a 
homosexual. The possibility that such things 
could occur may provoke feelings of discom­
fort, hut there is something deeper, someth­
ing darker here. 
Perhaps homosexuality is terrifying 
because it's not just the personal property ofa 
few. isolated "perverts" but is, instead, to 
varying degrees, a very real part of a large 
majority ofthe human race. Kinsey's landmatk 
report ( 19S·i) only has been corroborated in 
il~ finding that feelings of physical attraction 
h>r members of the same sex are widespread 
and are not limited to predominately 
homosexual people. 
Our particular culture forces us to devote sub~tantial amounts of psychic energy to the task of burying these feelings. For the most part, we are successful because we must be successful; failure means almost certain ostracization, failure means becoming one of the untouchables. So successful is the repres­sion that only an oe<:asional dream rises up to tell us what wt"'ve been hiding from ourselves. 
Fear of confronting and coming to grips with our personal homosexuality leads many to simply ignore and even avoid the topic of 
homosexuality, unless it be in the safe form of 
a crude joke or a slur, rather than deal with the 
harrowing consequences. The result, or 
maybe the cause, is a mass ofeducated people 
who actually believe that there are two dis­
tinct categories of people: homosexual and 
heterosexual. Believe that people consciously 
choose to become homosexuals; that it is im­
possible for homosexuals to be happy because 
they are sick, or sinful, or both and that all 
homosexuals are child molesters, or 
transvestites or effeminate. There are not 
enough letters in the alphabet with which to 
catalogue all the myths and misunderstand­
ings. 

When one walks around with such a burden 
of misinformation, it is very easy to dis­
criminate against homosexuals. If you don't 
want to be a part ofdiscrimination (and that is 
a big "if'), you must first put away your fear. In 
order to put away your fear, you must replace 
misinformation with truth -you must want 
additional information. 
Congratulations to the Saint Mary's ad­
ministration and Campus Ministry team, and 
especially to the respondents of the survey, 
who took that first critical step.

Worry less about form and more about content 
Dear Editor: 
Sue Barton recently wrote a letter including comments on the use of the terms "girls" and "guys." She said the use of "guys" was inap­propriate except when addressing mixed groups ofpeople. I do not mind being referred to as a "guy" (as opposed to a "man"), but when the plural term is used to address groups which include women, it seems sexist. Ideally we should all start saying "y'all," as is done in the South. 
Unfortunately, this brings up another problem, prejudices about accents, about which l am more seriously concerned. There is a widespread· view in academic environ­ments (including Notre Dame) that a sout­hern accent sounds "uneducated" and should be suppressed if a person is to gain intellectual respect. 
'lllis is a silly attitude, especially since most Southern accents are more pleasant to listen 
l J r IC 
c:J 
to than the nasal twangs coming from other 
parts of the country. There is nothing in­
herently wrong, however, with these latter ac­
cents, either. I've been accused ofhaving such 
an accent myself. 

We ought to be tolerant of foreign accents 
as well. American students tend to complain 
and/or make fun of their foreign-born profes­
sors' and fellow students' accents, saying they 
are too difficult to understand. Granted there 
is sometimes a genuine problem, but in most 
cases all that is needed is a little more mental 
flexibility on the part of the listener. 
The important thing at a university is com­
munication -and we should worry more 
about the content of the communication and 
less about its form. Do you hear, y'all?

Football fans w.,atch the game and want to win 
DearEditor: 

This letter is in response to Kelly Por­tolese's article on "Notre Dame-Saint Mary's equality." 
Being a student at Notre Dame, (not Notre Dame-Saint Mary's), I had a hard time reading the article without "shaking down the thunder." 
My first problem with the article is that it considers a Notre Dame football game a social event. Social Event? When the Irish beat the University of Southern California in 1977 or the University of Michigan in 1980, I don't remember any headlines reading "Irish Know Ho~ to Throw a Party." But then, of course, I read the sports section, and not the society page. 
Notre Dame football is a battle from begin­ning to end (especially these days), and fans have a responsibility to help their team in every way. If any Saint Mary's student is com­plaining about the price ofthe football tickets she must pay, yet wants to be a part ofa Satur­day social event, she is welcome to my father's tailgater -and I'll buy her tickets from her so the rest ofmy family can be a positive force in helping Notre Dame win. 
The question is "Why?" and I commend Portolese on her observation. It is not why do Saint Mary's students pay more than Notre Dame students, however, but why do they even have the opportunity to buy tickets to a Notre Dame game? Never in my 20 years on this earth have I heard the greatest college football rivalry referred to as the "ND-SMC vs USC game," nor have I heard any cheer "We are ND-SMC." 
I think Portolese should keep in mind her opportunity to buy tickets to the Notre Dame games is a privilege, not aright at any price. Maybe she should also stop expressing her views, before Holy Cross Junior College and Saint Joseph's High School hear about her gripe and offer to pay face value for the tickets currently offered to her at two-thirds price. 
Maybe she also should pray I never get Mike Bobinski's job.

Majority of students do not steal from peers 
DearEditor: 

I'm writing in response to Jeffrey Griffin's letter to the editor in The Observer on Tues­day, Sept. 3 about the loss of his bookbag. Last week I lost a very valuable amethyst and gold bracelet given to me by my parents for my 21st birthday as part of a matching set with a necklace and earrings. 
So I know how you feel, Jeff Griffin, about the loss of your bookbag and I'm sorry. But I am more sorry about your pessimistic at­
titude. I thought you, as well as the many 
young members ofthe class of 1989, to whom 
you directed your irrational warning, would 
like to know that my bracelet, which I thought 
was gone forever, was found and returned to 
me. 

The girl who found it easily could haYe kept 
the bracelet: But because she's a sincere, 
l fthoughtful person, she realized what it meant to me and returned it. Yes, there are honest, trustworthy people at Notre Dame and I hope you find out before you graduate. It's unfor­tunate the loss ofyour bookbag caused such a hopeless attitude toward your fellow stu­dents. 4 
I admit there may be thieves at Notre Dame, 
 
as there are everywhere. But, more impor­

tantly, there are honest, sincere people at 

Notre Dame as well. In fact, they are in the A majority. And to the many young members of 
l 
A
the class of 1989, I hope you find these honest 
people as I have found them.

Words sometimes have more than one meaning 
Dear Editor: 
Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students are taking life in South Bend much too seriously. This is evident by the response to Erin O'Brien's light-hearted article on Sept. 12 con­cerning what life would be like should Saint Mary's decide to go coed. 
O'Brien obviously was writing tongue-in­cheek, but it appears several readers mistook humor for ignorance. The article was in no. way a reflection of the "academic prestige" of either Institution, but rather a humorous look at college life as it is and what it could be like. 
To those of you who insist on taking everything so literally, that's your prerogative. But, please, lighten up on those of us who don't.

Put pressure where it 
can be heard the most 
DearEdttor: 
Upon returning to the University this fall, I found myself wishing that l could bring one aspect of home back to school. At home l am able to receive WBNY, the Buffalo State radio station. I listened to it all summer break and became quite addicted. When I returned to Notre Dame, however, to my dismay I found I could not tune in our campus station, WVFJ. Notre Dame is suffering acutely from the ab­sence of a radio station. ll~ format and programming are very acceptable (progressive music), but the technical quality (or lack of it) makes the station sorely inade· quate. 
One could argue the students are apathetic and would like to listen to the local stations just as well. This, unfortunately, is not the case. Supply the students with the equipment to produce a radio station that can be received and they will listen. By not supplying the stu­dents with a workable station you deprive them ofa very large facet ofcollege life: music. You also deprive them a means of expression and communication. 
A fund drive one-quarter as successful as last year's MS drive would allow Notre Dame to purchase the basic tools with which to build an adequate campus radio station. Ifyou support me in this endeavor, please write to The Observer, or what is more preferable, contact anyone in student government and encourage them to put pressure where pressure is needed.

Sutton wins on sudden­death hole 
Associated Press 

ABILENE, Tex.-Hal Sutton rolled 
in a I 5-foot birdie putt on the first 
hole of sudden death yesterday to 
beat Mike Reid for the S72,000 first­
place check in the S400,000 South­
west Golf Classic. 

It was Sutton's second victory in 
extra holes this year. He defeated 
David Ogrin in a playoff at the 
Memphis Classic. 

Reid, who has finished second 
twice in his nine years on the tour 
but has never won, missed the green 
on the 398-yard, par-4 No. 1 hole but 
chipped to within a foot for a certain 
par. 

Sutton hit the green in regulation 
then canned his putt to earn his fifth 
victory of his PGA tour career. He 
has now won $362,-560 on the tour. 
Sutton has been in three playoffs on 
the tour and won all ofthem. 

Howard Twitty made a hard 
charge, shooting a 3-under-par 69 to 
finish at 14-under 274, justa shot be­
hind Sutton and Reid, who were at 
273. He won S27,200. 

Richard Zokol was another shot back at 275, posting a 2-under 70 over the windswept, par 36-36-72 Fairway Oaks Golf Club Course for Jl9,200. 
Reid and Sutton came to the 18th hole tied after they both birdied the 471-yard, par-4 No. 17. Reid also birdied the 165-yard, par-3 No. 16 to tie Sutton, who had either lead or shared the lead since the third hole. 
Boh missed I 5-foot putts on the 72nd green to force the first playoff in the five-year history ofthe tourna­ment. Sutton shot a !-under-par 71 while Reid was level par 72 as they played in the same threesome with Andy Bean.

heavyweight champion, scoring a close, but unanimous 15-round decision over Holmes for the Inter­national Boxing Federation title. 
"It's all over now," Holmes said in his hotel suite following his upset loss, which prevented him from tying Rocky Marciano's 49-0 record. 
''I'm glad. 
"Why do you think I lost? They wanted a rematch," Holmes said of the decision in which all three judges gave Spinks the last round. This gave Spinks a one-point margin on two officials' cards. He won by three points on the third card. 
"It was in the cards for me to lose," said Holmes, adding that he has been bothered this year by a pinched nerve In his neck. 
"I hate to make excuses for myself," he said. "God always gives you a sign when to quit." 
Most boxing observers feel that pressure will be put on Holmes for a rematch. 
Butch Lewis, who promotes Spinks' fights and co-promoted 
Saturday  night's  match,  said  he  
wasn't  sure  what  was  n~xt  for  
Spinks.  

Before the fight, NBC had offered $3.5 million for Holmes to go after victory No. 50 against somebody like Alfonzo Ratliff In prime time Nov. 22, which is a ratings sweeps period. 
Ratliff aiso lost Saturday night, dropping the World Boxing Council cruiserwelght championship in a 12­round decision to Bernard Benton. 
A first defense by Spinks certainly would be attractive to NBC or the other networks or to HBO, which telecast Spinks' upset victory. 
Lewis said Spinks could hold both the undisputed light heavyweight title and the IBF heavyweight cham­pionship for 90 days. 
When someone asked which title Spinks would relinquish, both Spinks and Lewis laughed. 
One intriguing fight possibility mentioned was a fight between Spinks and Marvelous Marvin Hagler, the undisputed mid­dleweight champion, at catch weights for the heavyweight title . The weight limit could be 175 pounds. 
"I don't want to fight Hagler," Spinks said. 
Spinks, who weighed 200 pounds, 25 pounds over the light heavyweight limit, said he "felt I needed the l 5th round to win."

Sen tor trl-captain David Mtles ( 14) challenges an Indiana op­ponent for the ball whUe teammate Marvin Lett (3) looks on. The Irish lost to the Hoosiers 4-0 yesterday, dropping their record to 1-6-1. For more on the soccer team'sfortunes over the weekend, see Phtl Wolfs story at right. 
ByPHILWOLF 
AssistantSports Editor 
There was a case ofbad timing for the Notre Dame soccer team when it took to Alumni Field yesterday against Indiana. The Irish played poorly while the Hoosiers played their best game of the season and took a 4-0 victory back to Bloomington. 
The loss dragged Notre Dame's record down to 1-6-1, including a 1­1 ,Pe with Michigan State Friday night on Cartier Field. The Hoosiers, who beat Ohio State, 4-1, Friday night, went to 3-4. 
"We have been improving with every game," Indiana Head Coach Jerry Yeagley said after yesterday's contest, "and I'd say this was (our best game of the year)-I thought we played with intensity and concentra­tion for the whole game. 
"We kept our composure and poise, and we really moved the ball nicely as a team." 
The Irish, meanwhile, lost their composure and let the Hoosiers take advantage oftheir tentativeness. 
"As soon as the game started, we just gave them way too much rt"spect," Irish Head Coach Dennis

"We never really went out to chal­lenge them. We backed off. We were intimidated by them. 
"I don't think we played well," Grace concluded. "We didn't even give them a good workout." 
The Hoosiers established the lead early in the game when Han Roest scored off a corner kick with an as­sist from Rod Castro just 3:42 into the match. Pete Stoyanovlch dribbled through a loose Irish defense and shot the ball past goalkeeper Hugh Breslin for the second goal ofthe game at 15:29

eighth victory over the Irish in as 
many years. 
"We played very well," Yeagley said, "and the things we wanted to do we were able to. I'd say rather than a bad effort on Notre Dame's part, it was an extremely good effort on ours." 
Grace, a former player and assis­tant coach under Yeagley at Indiana, disagreed. 
"Midway through the first half, the sun came out. That was the only bright spot I saw," he said. 
There were more bright spots last Friday night, but the Irish still could not record a win. They tied Mic­higan State, 1-1, under Cartier's lights. 
Notre Dame outshot the visiting team, 25-7, but still managed only the one goal. 
The goal came.at 62:21. Senior tri­captain Dave Miles scored his first goal of the season from 30 yards after receiving a cross from Joe Sternberg, who carried the ball down the right side ofthe field. 
The Irish had numerous other scoring opportunities, but many shots were saved by Spartan goalkeeper Paul Zimmerman, who had 10 saves all night. Several other shots hit the goal posts or barely missed the opening. 
"We had plenty ofopportunities," Grace observed after the game. "We were all over that team. We had enough chances to win. And again (for the seventh time this season), we didn't win. A tie is just as bad as a loss." 
The Spartans scored their goal at 
78:11. Peter Crawley beat Irish defensman Stuart MacDonald and passed to Jim Gallina, who shot th(' ball past the outstretched Breslin. 
"There is no way we should have let them get back in the ballgame," Grace said. "They're very fortunate to get out of here with a tie. They didn't have too many scoring oppor­tunities." 
The Spartans forced Breslin to make only five saves. 
The Irish continued to dominate play in the two overtime periods, but they could not get the ball in the net. 
It was the third time Notre Dame had been in overtime this season and failed to win. The Irish previously had lost to Wisconsin-Milwaukee, 3· 2, and Evansville, 4-2, in overtime contests. 
It was the Spartans' first overtime game this season. Last year, the Irish settled for a 2-2 tie with the Spartans in East Lansing. 
Notre Dame will play at Wisconsin-Green Bay on Saturday and Northwestern on Sunday. 
The next Irish home game is Oct. 2 against Bowling Green.

Irish baseball team plays poorly, loses four games over the weekend 

By BILL IRVIN 
Sports Writer 

The rain came down on the Notre Dame baseball team this weekend, both literally and figuratively. 
As a cloudburst fell during the first game of yesterday's doubleheader against Western Michigan, the Irish exhibited soggy play in dropping an 11-2 contest. Western Michigan also won the second game handily, 9-2, thus completing a dismal weekend for Notre Dame. Bethel College also gained a sweep on Saturday, beating the Irish, 10-3 and 9-3. 
The tone of the weekend's actjon was revealed in microcosm in that first game yesterday, as Westerm Michigan exploded for seven runs in the first two innings. After an infield out and a walk started the game, the next three hitters knocked out singles, setting up an RBI sacrifice fly by Abe Walker and a run-scoring single by Jim Davis. The visitors, up 4-0, quickly iced the win by pushing across three more runs in the second, on two hits and two walks. 
In addition to their inability to stop enemy hitters this weekend, .the action this weekend. the Irish also failed to generate "I'm pleased with our young much offense.
