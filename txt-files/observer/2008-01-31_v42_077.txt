THE 
Director of GRC says 
ca111pus at extre111es 
By ANN-MARIE WOODS News Writer 
The University's Catholic character plays a major role in promoting many students to search exclusively for life partners and others to respond by rejecting commit­ted relationships altogether, the director of the Gender Helations Center said Wednesday. 
Citing Catholic character as the "framework of our values and morals," at Notre Dame, Heather Rakoczy spoke about relationships and interactions on campus as part of the· second install­ment of "Notre Dating" 
Wednesday. 
"People take relationships much more seriously here, searching for a life partner rather than simply dating in order to meet people and have a good time," Rakoczy said. At the other extreme, students are fearful of this culture of dating and abstain from the process entirely or "feel pressure to be in com­mitted, long-lasting relation­ships." 
The problem lies in the extremes. Students' respons­es are "radical on either end. There is no middle ground," Rakoczy said. 
The GRC's focus, therefore,

Nuliquor, no patrons, no Casa 
Unpaid taxes lead to restaurant closing 
By MARCELA BERRIOS and 
KAREN LANGLEY 
News Writers 
Adios, Taco Tuesdays and half-off pitchers. 
Casa del Rio, a popular off­campus eatery located at 1705 South Bend Ave., will serve its last meal tonight after a failure to keep up with tax payments prevented its owner from renewing the establishment's liquor license. 
''I've been pondering it for a while," owner Jesse Arredondo, said. "It's just been harder and harder to make ends meet." 
Arredondo, who opened Casa in September 2004, said he is out of the capital needed to run the restaurant. Casa will not reopen unless he finds business partners in the next few days. 
The restaurant's liquor license expired Dec. 21, and Arredondo couldn't renew it because the property's taxes were not up to date, a require­ment under Indiana law. 
"You have to be current when you go to the renewal hearing," he said. 
And without its famous drink deals -such as $1 domestic draughts on Tuesdays and half­price margarita pitchers Sundays and Wednesdays -Casa saw an immediate drop in revenue. 
"It has hurt me extremely to be without the liquor license," Arredondo said.

Oceanic flight 815 
John Locke. Saint Mary's 
It's been 260 days Editor 
since the "Lost" 
Season Three finale. 
And yes, of course I've been counting. 
And tonight at 8 p.m., "Lost" is finally 
back. 
The sole purpose of this column is to explain why John Locke is the deepest, most mysterious, craziest and phenomenal character on "Lost" -which is why, even after being shot and thrown into a ditch to die at the end of Season Three, he emerged just in time to try to convince Jack not to use the radio (which he does anyway, but still). 
John Locke was brought up in fos­ter care, only to be conned by his bio­logical father, Anthony Cooper, for his kidney. After confronting him several times in order to prevent him from conning a woman to steal her for­tune, his father threw him out an eight-story window, leading to his four-year wheelehair stint as a para­plegie. 
But Locke didn't give up. lie went to Australia to participate in a "walka­bout." which is a spiritual journey, even though he was in a wheelchair. And now, he is going to be the reason "The Others" don't kill all 38 of the remaining survivors. 
If anyone watches "Lost," they'll know Locke's often-used phrase, "Don't tdl me what I ean't do." IIis character is tragi<\ but strong. lie makes everyone else on the island look weak and selfish. lie has become one with the island and as a result. hn is the only person who doesn't really want to leave. 
Everyone looks to Locke for guid­ance bncause they can sense that he knows what's up. And he dons. 
John Locke spent a majority of Season One with Boone unearthing the I latch, which sustained life with food, medical supplies and shelter while everyone else was sitting under tarps next to campfires. 
lie realized there was something special about Walt before he got kid­napped when everyone else thought he was a creepy child molester. 
lie was learning the secrets of "The Others" while everyone else thought he was a traitor. 
lie has single-handedly helped every single person on the island and now with season four so very close, I cannot wait to see what Locke will do next. 
While Loeke has never been the central character in the show, it wouldn't be a show without him. There's so much more we need to lind out and hopefully, it'll happen in. Season Four. 
Even though there are 48 more episodes over the next three seasons, Locke will not die. He will not be a traitor. And he will get off the island. I am totally sure of it. And if I'm wrong, he's going to have a pretty sweet exit.

VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. -Authorities removed nearly 200 animals from a Virginia Beach home, including 89 frozen ferret carcasses. Police spokes­woman Margie Long said animal control agents found more than 100 live ferrets, a dog, a bird and three cats, most of them suffering from dehydra­tion and malnutrition.

Ore. boy picks wrong place to park bike 
SALEM, Ore. -If it's on the floor at the Goodwill store in Salem, it's for sale. So when Cody Young parked his bicycle in the wrong place, it got sold. Not only that, the bike that cost $232 four years ago went for $6.99. "That was just insulting," the seventh-grader said. 
Young said he and friends went to the store on Sunday to look at speakers. He didn't have 
a Jock, but his friends told him they'd previous­ly parked inside the store. He left it near other bikes that were for sale. While they were shopping, his black BMX bike was sold. 
Goodwill officials said they were looking into the sale. They said they were unable to identify the bike's purchaser. 
"We will make every effort to do the right thing," spokesman Bob Barsocchini said, "and we will throw in a bike lock."

Special to The Observer 
ND Alert, Notre Dame's com­prehensive emergency notifi­cation system, will be retested Friday afternoon. During the process, many students, facul­ty and staff will receive text­message alerts to their cell phones for the first time. 
An ND Alert test in November revealed that some e-mail messages took more than two hours to arrive. Modifications have been made to local e-mail delivery sys­tems, and the upeoming test will verify the effectiveness of these ehanges.

Some employees, par­ticularly those who must pay a per-message fee for texts, may want to opt out of this feature. This may be done by following the instructions at the emer­gency page of OIT's web site. 
As with the first test, the mass notification system will distrib­ute messages to student, faculty and employee home and office telephones, registered cell phones, University e-mail accounts and any additional personal e-mail accounts previ­ously provided.

Notre Dame is climbing up the list of medium-sized schools sending students into the Peace Corps. 
After spending last year as No. 21, Notre Dame jumped 
to No. 17 in 2007 with 23 alumni cur­rently in the Peace Corps. 
Medium-sized schools on the list are defined as those with undergraduate enrollments between 5,000 and 15,000. Notre Dame, with an enroll­ment of about 8,000, is tied for its spot on the list with Appalachian S t a t e University and The University of Montana. 
Notre Dame has been

endangered species via negotiated agreements between private landown­ers and the federal govern­ment rather than by gov­ernment mandate alone. 
"Though these agree­ments may have promise for addressing conflicts over species conservation and economic develop­ment," he said, "with few exceptions they are adopted with little participation from the public or inde­pendent scientists. This too often produces risky regu­latory approvals that lack basic yet vital information."

ideals of Notre Dame and the Peace Corps are very much in sync. Peace Corps enjoys enormous support on cam­pus from faculty and staff, which we truly appreciate." 

Camacho cites the often­touted Plum Creek agree­ment in Washington. 
"The agreement remains in effect despite a 50 per­cent decline in endangered spotted owls attributable to an alarming influx of inva­sive barred owls -a con-
every regulatory program. Such adaptive regulation would allow enacted laws, Congress, and administra­tive agencies to actually be judged on their perform­ance and be held account­able for outcomes, not just intentions." 
A member of the Notre Dame faculty since 2005, Camacho earned law degrees from Harvard Law School and Georgetown University. He specializes in the study of regulatory innovation in environmen­tal, land use, and local gov­ernment law. 
Many Notre Dame gradu­ates are searching for a way to give back to the communi­ty through service to others and do so through the Peace Corps. 
Erik Janowsky, a 1987 alumnus, had an affinity for Latin Ameriea and studied Spanish throughout his years at Notre Dame, he said. He went to Ecuador as a Peaee Corps member and service soon became a vocation for him. 
He embarked on a career in community development and eventually co-founded a non-profit organization with another Notre Dame alum­nus establishing a primary health care projeet in Ecuador, he said. 
The Center of Social Concerns is responsible for informing and providing Notre Dame graduates with the opportunity to join the Peace Corps. 
Students, faculty and com­munity members interested in the Peace Corps can attend the upcoming campus information presentation, or contact the Notre Dame regional recruiter Liz Ategou. The presentation is on Thursday, at 6 p.m. in Hoom 116 of DeBartolo Hall.

Much of the money to be made available after the settlement would be funneled through the NCAA's existing $218 million opportunity fund. 
"The biggest dollar amount talked about is the student athlete opportunity fund whieh is an NCAA sponsored program which basically provides funding through the conferences to the membership and that money can be used for a variety of things," Heisler said.

Fmal report spares Israeli prime minister 
JERUSALEM -Prime Minister Ehud Olmert emerged relatively unscathed from the final report Wednesday on his handling of Israel's 2006 war in Lebanon, even though the inquiry criticized both the government and the army for "serious failings and 11aws." 
The report stopped short of blaming Olmert personally for what many Israelis saw as a stunning debacle that emboldened the Jewish state's enemies. A harsher indictment could have threatened Olmert's rule and his stated goal of signing a peace treaty with the Palestinians within a year.

GENEVA -The United States has told China to get serious about relaxing the restraints on financial information providers in a letter that could represent a linal warning before the U.S. asks the WTO to intervene in the matter, the A<>sodated Press learned Wednesday. 
In the letter to Chinese trade officials. the office of the U.S. Trade Representative signaled it has run out of patience with China's refusal to changr. rules introduced two years ago that appeared to boost the official Xinhua News Agency at the expense of financial information companirs such as Reuters Group PLC and Bloomberg LP.

Jendayi Frazer said neither President Mwai Kibaki nor his chief rival, opposition leader Raila Odinga, is doing enough to stop the bloodshed that has claimed more than 800 lives since the disputed Dec. 27 presidential vote. 
Much of the violence has pitted other tribes, including Odinga's Luo, against Kibaki's Kikuyu who are the largest ethnic group. Kikuyus have long been resented for their dominance of Kenya's econo­my and politics, but poor Kikuyu are among the slum dwellers who have been left out of the country's economic boom. 
Frazer said the violence she saw during a visit earlier tllis month to the western Rift Valley pitted the Kalenjin, who support Odinga, against Kikuyus. 
"The first wave of this vio­lence, it was primarily in the Rift Valley, and it was Kalenjin pushing out Kikuyu.

"A lot of factors, in the end, were responsible," he said. "But having a poor season cer­tainly didn't help our economy." 
At its peak in 2006, Casa did a bustling business, Arredondo said. On some Tuesdays, when tacos and domestic drafts were each $1, a customer could find a wait as long as 100 tables.

Hate

that the student b"ody sup­ports the G and L communi­ty," Bant said. "I think it does a larger disservice to the gay and lesbian community to keep bringing up this hate and keep mentioning this hate, as obviously it was a very immature act that was done for attention, and we're giving them attenlion." 
However, other senators said that the Senate should pass the resolution to show that this act should not be condoned. 
"It might have been just two shirts, but just the fact that no one has really said any­thing is extremely disturb­ing," Howard Senator Erdina Francillon said. "I believe that it is important to pass this to finally get on the right path." 
A few senators compared the T-shirt incident to the racist letters sent to three residence halls last week. O'Neill Senator Matt Molloy said the T-shirt incident is worth specifically addressing in light of the recent mailings. While the University notified the entire campus about the racist letters through an e­mail, the offensive T-shirts received much less attention. 
"The University sent an e­mail to every student denouncing the racist letters, and nothing happened with the [anti-gay] shirts," Molloy said. "We need to stand up and address it because no one else has." 
Koski said that in addition to passing the resolution, the Senate should take action to support the GLBTQ communi­ty and to combat hate speech. Possible events could be a dialogue series and greater involvement with "Stand Against Hate Week" in April, she said. 
Academic Affairs Committee Chair Carol Hendrickson also gave a presentation about the hiring and tenure of Catholic faculty. Hendrickson said that future Senate meetings will feature speakers about this topic, including a Faculty Senate member and a mem­ber of the administration ­though the speakers have not been confirmed. 
Hendrickson presented a graph showing a projection of Catholic faculty compared to non-Catholic factory, from 2006-2042, 
"Most people are just con­cerned about going to class and their everyday routine and not thinking about when [they'll[ send [their[ kids here or the history and the legacy of Notre Dame," Franeillon said.

IN BRIEF Deal near in investigation of Eli Ully 
NEW YORK -Eli Lilly and Co. and federal prosecutors are exploring a settlement of an investigation into the drugmaker's marketing of' its top seller, the anti-psychotic Zyprexa, The New York Times reported Wednesday. 
The Times reported on its Web site that the company could wind up paying more than $1 billion to state and federal governments. The report said several unidentified people involved in the investigation confirmed the settlement discussions. 
Indianapolis-based Lilly said in a statement that it received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania seeking Zyprexa-related docu­ments. Lilly spokeswoman Tarra Ryker declined to elaborate on the possibility of a settlement when reached by phone. 
"We are cooperating with the government in these investigations, and the discussions around those are confidential," she told The Associated Press. "We've said pretty much all we're going to be able to say on this." 

Economy has worst year since 2002 
WASHINGTON -The economy nearly stalled in the fourth quarter with a growth rate of just 
0.6 percent, capping its worst year since 2002. 
Wednesday's Commerce Department report showed that the economy deteriorated consid­erably during the October-to-December quar­ter as worsening problems in the housing mar­ket and harder-to-get credit made individuals and businesses more cautious in their spend­ing. Fears of a recession have grown, even as inllation remained elevated. 
For all of 2007, the economy grew by just 2.2 percent, the weakest performance in five years, when the country was struggling to recover from the 2001 recession. The housing collapse was the biggest culprit; builders slashed spending on housing projects by 16.9 percent on an annualized basis, the most in 25 years. 
The gross domestic product report for the last quarter of 2007 came as the Democratic­run Congress and the Bush administration con­tinued to work on a program of tax rebates and business incentives. 




Tax rebates inch closer to reality 
Senate finance committee approves bill, hopes for full floor vote by week's end 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -A plan to send $500-$1,000 rebates to all but the rich­est taxpayers advanced in the Senate Wednesday after Republicans and Democrats teamed to add aid for dis­abled veterans, the elderly and the unemployed to a !louse-passed economic recovery bill. 
The package would make individuals with annual incomes of up to $150,000 and couples with incomes up to $300,000 eligible for the rebates. Qualifying fam­ilies would also get $300 for each child. 
The Senate Finance Committee approved the measure on a bipartisan vote Wednesday, and senior aides said the Senate could begin voting on it as early as Thursday in hopes of completing it by week's end. 
The income limits com­pare with caps of $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for couples in an economic stimulus bill the House passed on Tuesday. 
They were part of a bill written by Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., the Finance Committee chair­man, and backed by Charles Grassley of Iowa, the panel's senior with Republican, which would pump $193 billion into the Mitch economy over the next two years.

Schvvarzenegger vvill support John McCain 
California governor to back Arizona senator for impending Republican primary elections 
Associated (>rcss 

SIMI VALLEY--Gov. Arnold Schwarzcnegger will endorse John McCain on Thursday, giving a certain boost to the Hcpubliean presidential front-runner six days heforn California's high­prize primary. 
The two will appear at a IH~ws confnrenee after touring a Los Angeles-based solar eneq.,ry com­pany and the governor will make his endorsement ollicial, his sen­ior aides eonlirmml Wednesday. 
Schwarzenegger's endorse­ment is yet another setback for Mitt Homney, the former Massachusetts governor who saw Florida slip from his grasp Tuosday after McCain rolled up the support of that state's two top electnd Hepublicans, (iov. Charlie Crist and Son. Mel Martinez. 
I lis stratn).,ry in tatters. Homney plans to olror himself as the eon­servativn altl~rnativn to McCain as he pushes ahead in hopes of winning enough dPlegates to top­ple thn Arizona snnator when 21 statns vote in the Hepublican contest on Tuesday. 
Sehwarzenegger's move mmes as McCain plows ahead toward the nomination. the only Hepuhlican candidate to have won three hotly contested pri­marins sine~ voting began earlier this month. 
"Governor Schwarzenegger is an exeeptional governor and we am honored that he has decided to endorse Senator McCain, and look forward to the event tomor­row," said Steve Schmidt, a sen­ior McCain adviser who managed Sehwarzenegger's 2006 cam­paign. 

The four-term senator is run­ning strongly ahead of his com­petitors in California, which oilers a whopping 170 delegates to the Hepublican nominating convention. Candidates secure three delegates for each of the state's 53 congressional districts tlwy win in the primary, in which only Republicans can vote. 
The ultimate effect of Schwarzenegger's endorsement is undnar. The celebrity governor and former actor is universally known in the state, and his politi­cal nntwork certainly will be helpful to McCain, who has virtu­ally no organized effort in California after his candidacy nearly collapsed. The actor­turnnd-governor also is a prolific fund raiser. 
But Sehwarzenegger has a strainnd relationship with some conservatives in his own party and McCain, himself, is fighting to convince GOP rank-and-file that he's committed to conserva­tive values. Schwarzenegger's nod could exacerbate concerns about McCain among the party establishment. 
Breathalizer tests not per111itted in hearings 
Poor performance in toxicology labs results in judge's refusal to allow device in courtrooms 
Associated Press 
SEATTLE -Tho State Patrol's toxicology lab has had so many nthical lapsns and made so many scientific mistakes in recent years that alcohol breath test results should not bn admittnd at trial, a court ruled Wednesday. 
The ruling by a three-member panel of King County District Court will likely make it easier for defendants in pending county cases to beat drunken driving charges and for those previously convicted on breath test evi­dence to appeal. 

"Simply stated, without the reliable evidence that a correctly · functioning breath test instru­ment can provide, the discovery of tho truth in DUI eases suf­fers," the judges wrote. "The innocent may be wrongly con­~ict~;,d. and the guilty may go 
free. 
Prosncutors <~an still try to win convictions based on other evi­d!~ncn, such as nrratic driving and field sobriety tnsts. 
Thn ruling by .Judges David Steiiwr. I>arrPII Phillipson and Mark Chow is not binding on the county's otlwr I X district judgf\s but is .-xpertl'd to be highly inlluPntial, said l'wsiding .Judge Barbara LindP. 
Tlw wurt handl~s about 5,000 drunken driving cases a ynar, and tlw vast majority plnad guilty or arrPpt dei'PITPd prose­cution. 

The ruling cited problems with the patrol's toxicology lab, including the false certification of solutions used to verify breath tnsts, the improper rejection of data, mistakenly switched data and reliance on software that miscalculated data. Prosecutors ean try to get breath tests admit­ted in eases after they have proven the lab's practices have been cleaned up, the judges said. 
"The judges are saying, 'If you wanna play 'CSI,' you've got to make sure you can do it the way 'CSI' does it,"' defense attorney Ted Vosk said. "The science they did at the lab was so sloppy you can have no confidence in any of the results that were obtained." 
Vosk said he was one of many defense attorneys around the state who helpnd cover the more than $25,000 it cost for exports, transcripts and other legal expenses in challenging the lab's work before the King County judges. 
King County is the third in the state to reconsider the validity of the tnsts since reports of prob­lllms surfacPd, and its ruling is the most sweeping. Skagit County judgns ruled that although misconduct at the lab was troubling, there was no immediate evidence that thn hrnath test results wnrn invalid. In Snohomish County, judgns threw out the tests in about 40 casns.

Town targets Bush, Cheney 
Petition accuses president, vice president ofcrimes against Constitution 
Associated Press 
BRATTLEBORO, Vt. ~ A town petition making President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney subject to arrest for crimes against the Constitution has triggered a barrage of crit­icism from people who say res­idents are "wackjobs" and "nuts." 
In e-mail messages, voice­mail messages and telephone calls, outraged people are call­ing the measure the equivalent of treason and vowing never to visit Vermont. 
"Has everyone up there been out in the cold too long?" said one. 
"I would like to know how I could get some water from your town," said another. "It's obvious that there is something special in it." 
The petition ~ with more than 436 signatures, or at least the 5 percent of voters neces­sary to be considered ~ was submitted Thursday and the town Select Board voted 3-2 Friday to put it on the ballot. It goes to a town-wide vote March 4. 
It reads: "Shall the Selectboard instruct the Town Attorney to draft indictments against President Bush and Vice President Cheney for crimes against our Constitution, and publish said indictments for consideration by other authorities and shall it be the law of the Town of Brattleboro that the Brattleboro Police, pursuant to the above-mentioned indict­ments, arrest and detain George Bush and Richard Cheney in Brattleboro if they are not duly impeached, and prosecute or extradite them to other authorities that may rea­sonably contend to prosecute them?" 
· News of the measure made the rounds on the Internet, and soon people started calling and writing. The Brattleboro Area Chamber of Commerce got about 60 e-mails Monday, all of them negative, said Executive Director Jerry Goldberg. 
A day later, he said, "we had three or four calls in a row that were very positive. One even volunteered to help." 
The petition has no legal standing, since the town attor­ney has no authority to write an indictment and the police have no authority to arrest Bush or Cheney if either visits Brattleboro. 
Bush has not visited Vermont during his presidency; Cheney visited Burlington in 2002, but has not been to Brattleboro. 
Anger at the Bush adminis­tration is hardly new in Vermont. The state Senate voted last year to support impeaching the president. Anti-war rallies are regular occurrences, and "Impeach Bush" bumper stickers are common.

Cle111son University fraternity onprobation 
Three members charged with misdemeanors after freshman dies of alcohol poisoning 
Associated Press 
WALHALLA, S.C. ~ Three fraternity members at Clemson University were charged with alcohol-related misdemeanors after a fresh­man died of alcohol poisoning during an off-campus-party, a prosecutor said Wednesday. 
The students' activities did not directly lead to the death of 18-year-old Benjamin Garrison Sprague, prosecutor Chrissy Adams said. But the three students, all members of the fraternity Sigma Nu, face charges that include transferring beer and liquor to a minor and using fake identification to buy alcohol. 
Sprague was not forced to drink at the party, Adams said.

"Ben made choices that night to consume alcohol, and he consumed alcohol in excess, and that led to his death," Adams said. "These boys made a mistake by pro­viding the alcohol and having it available at a fraternity party to underage drinkers." 
Sprague died of alcohol poi­soning Dec. 9 at a Sigma Nu fraternity house. He had a blood-alcohol level of nearly 
0.38 percent ~ about five times above the legal thresh­old for driving, Oconee County Coroner Karl Addis has said. 
After Sprague's death, the school's Sigma Nu chapter was placed on interim sus­pension by the university and the national fraternity pend­ing investigations. The sus­pension means the group can­not hold any meetings or par­ties. 
"We fully expect our mem­bers to abide by, uphold and support the laws of the land, including laws pertaining to alcohol purchase, consump­tion and use," said Brad Beacham, executive director of the Virginia-based national Sigma Nu Fraternity. 
Adams said Sprague, who had recently been initiated into the fraternity, had been drinking for four hours before he arrived at the party. Adams read a statement from Sprague's parents that said, "While we acknowledge Ben's errors in judgment, we do not believe his errors overshadow his goodness." 
Clemson spokeswoman Robin Denny said the school will determine whether the students who were charged would also be suspended. 
"Our first thoughts are with the Sprague family and con­tinue to be with them, since this is just another sad day for their family and for the Clemson family," Denny said. 
The prosecutor said Jetin Patel, 19, of Spartanburg, was charged with using a fake ID to purchase beer at a grocery store. He also faces charges of underage posses­sion of beer and transfer of beer to a person under 21. 
Matthew Rinckel, 20, of Lynchburg, Va., was charged with transfer of beer and transfer of liquor to a person under 21. 
Addison Kerr, 21, of Atlanta, was charged with transfer of liquor to a minor. 
Kerr's attorney, Mills Ariail, said his client was hoping to be allowed to enter a pretrial intervention program, which could remove the charges from his record. 
"The family, from what I understand, did not want criminal charges brought," Ariail said. "They don't want these boys to face this the rest of their life." 
An attorney for Rinckel declined to comment through another lawyer in his firm, and it was unclear whether Patel had an attorney. All three were booked Tuesday and released from jail on their own recognizance. A court appearance for them has been scheduled for late February, Ariail said.

Why are you here? 

At least a few times in my career here at Notre Dame, I've bmm asked this question in manners incredulous and inquisitive, hostile and hospitable. 
Now, I cannot rnad minds and so I can­
John Everett

Kids These 
beliel's of other peo­
Days

ple with any degree of certainty, but I think it is a fairly safe bet that if reli­gious belief were somehow quantifiable I'd probably be considered below aver­age, to be cautious. Living in close proximity to other people means that this gets noticed, and occasionally ques­tioned. 
I try to brush oil' the question with something flippant or funny, such as "The weather was too nice to say no" or "I heard the food at North Dining Hall was great" but these are diversions, not just to the questioner but to myself, the questioned. You see, I've been trying to explain it to myself darn near every day I've been on campus the last four years. I likn it here a lot, I really do. I'd stay another year or two if they'd tnt me (well, if they let me for free), but why? Yes, there are friends and fun times and all that, and I don't mean to dismiss these crucial considerations, but recent­ly, I think I may have come upon an answer. 
Ironically enough, I was attending mass at the time. Our dorm's priest was delivering the homily and talking about the greatest needs human beings had. I found myself nodding along when the three he listed were to love, to be loved, and to be a part of something greater than themselves. The last of these three was referred to as the main reason most people believe in a religion. I believe it is also the main criteria by which I select my favorite movies. 
Sitting there listening to the priest I realized that nearly all of the movies I love involve a group of people coming together and utilizing their individual talents toward the pursuit of a common goal. The preference stretches across genre lines. My favorite war movie is "The Great Escape," in which the inmates of a POW camp undertake an intricate escape plan, hoping to free 200 people. The effort encompasses tailors, strategists. li:>rgers, diggers and Steve McQueen. Though the plan is ultimately less than successful, the story is inspir­ing. 
My favorite western is "The Magnificent Seven," in which seven dis­parate gunslingers take very little pay to defend a Mexican village from an evil thief. Though mentioning the compari­son in an article ostensibly about reli­gion might strike some as curious, I think the same philosophy might apply to caper films sueh as "Ocean's Eleven" and, of course, "The Great Muppet Caper." 
The point of all this is to say, in an embarrassingly inflated fashion, that although I might not agree with very much of the dogma, I still empathize with the need for that feeling of being a part of something greater. I want to feel that there is a reason for us to be here. 
The more strident atheists, like Hichard Dawkins, author of the provocatively titled "The God Delusion," and his kindred spirit Christopher Hitchens fail to see religious belief in the proper light. They think of it as the complete acceptance of an utterly ridiculous story and thus view it unfa­vorably. I tend to think of religious belief as an attempt to come up with answers to the questions our own existence forces upon us, including the one which leads off this column: Why are you (or any of us) here? 
I don't doubt that Dawkins and Hitchens have considered these ques­tions. My problem is that they have answered them so eonlidently that they seem .to have moved on from them. We are here beeausB of a random distur­bance in the universe, leading eventual­ly to the creation of all life. We fall in love because our genes want us to reproduce. People are happier or sad­der than other people bl~cause of dill'er­ing levels of certain ehemkals in the brain. In short, Dawkins and llitchens have dismissed the notion of a soul. 
The problem with these answers, however true, is that they are too eer­tain. Heligion may niTer similarly pat answnrs, i.e. we are bern because of the will of God, and we are here to do God's will, etc., but it does not, or should not, lend itself to thn saml~ degree of certain­ty, as the believer is forced to ask fur­ther, "What is <;od's will, and how do we best enaet it?" 
If belief is a continuum, I myself may fall closer to Dawkins' and llitchens' end of it than to St. Frands', but I don't conceive of myself as an easily under­stood product of natural selection and chemical imbalances. I like to think more of myself', and the rest of us, than that. And that's tl111 reason I like it here. As Norman Mailer, a man with uncer­tain religious beliefs himself, onee said, "You can say the word soul at Notre Dame and nobody snickers." 
John Everett is a senior English major. He is thought to be somewhere between 21 and 45 years ofage. l!e is armed only with a sharp wit and is considered cantankerous. Ifyou have any information regarding his whereabouts. please contact jeverett@ndedu

Celebrate Catholic education, community 
This week marks the 36th annual national celebration of Catholic Schools Week. All over the country, Catholic ele­mentary and high schools are celebrat­ing the unique contributions a Catholic education makes to the students who attend, as well as to the world. At my Kate Barrett children's grade 
school, "St. Joe FaithpointSouth Bend," as the students call it, kids 
are participating in a special prayer service, an environmen­tal awareness day, a pep rally, "share a book with a buddy," an all-school rosary, "no homework night," and that most beloved of all days for uniform­wearing grade-schoolers everywhere, Dress Down Day. They also have, rather inexplicably, a Catholic Schools Week Breadstick Day fundraiser for two local charities, through which, for $1, you get two scrumptious Little Caesar's bread­sticks. With sauce. Though the connec­tion between breadsticks and Catholic Schools Week remains unclear, they can't wait to dig in on Friday (which is also Dress Down Day -no sauce on the uniforms!). And in one of the very human twists of fate that only happens in Catholic schools, my oldest son will take a break from Dress Down Day tomorrow morning, pull his good shoes out of his backpack, and help serve at the funeral of an elderly parishioner 
who died earlier this week. 
The National Catholic Education Association has chosen "Light the Way" as the theme for this year's Catholic Schools Week, to challenge Catholic school students and graduates to let their lights shine and brighten the future for all humankind. It also reminds us that we are on "the Way," just as the Bible described the followers of Jesus in the early Church. 
Now, I know this isn't "Catholic Universities Week." You don't need to be told to read with a buddy; declaring a no-homework night could be fun, but probably inadvisable; and you don't have uniforms to dress down from. But that which makes all Catholic schools unique also makes Notre Dame unlike any secular school anywhere: communi­ties connected by a commitment to a common faith in Jesus Christ simply live 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Affirmative action fair 
In his Viewpoint column ("True diversi­ty," Jan 29), Greg Yatarola argued against affirmative action, claiming that "not all blacks and Hispanics are disadvantaged. In fact, when they marry and form stable families, they move into the middle class about as well as everyone else." I'm hav­ing some trouble understanding this claim. 
There's the suggestion that "stable fami­lies" are the key to achieving middle-class status -a claim that was roundly debunked almost immediately after Senator Moynihan made it in the '70s. More fundamentally, Yatarola seems to be assuming that being disadvantaged or advantaged is a matter of wealth or eco­nomic class. That is, racism-the disad­vantages faced by African-Americans and others -is nothing more than classism ­the disadvantages faced by the poor. Racism, strictly speaking, does not exist. If this is the assumption Yatarola is starting with, then the conclusion that affirmative action should go probably follows fairly quickly: affirmative action was created to fight racism, but racism doesn't exist, therefore there's no reason for affirmative action. But this assertion that racism is nothing more than classism is, sadly, false. 
Barack Obama, for example, is a wealthy, politically powerful African-American. If Yatarola is right, racism would play no role in Obama's bid for the Democratic nomination. He would not, in particular, be attacked using stereotypes of African-Americans. And yet, last week, Rick Murphy, a columnist for a Long Island newspaper called The Independent, published just such an attack. (The pub­lisher has since taken his column ofiline, but -should you wish to see the ugly face of American racism firsthand -you can view Google's cached version of the page at httpJ/tinyurl.cornl2p2bs7.) 
Yatarola suggests that "The simple, obvious solution would be to favor those applicants who can actually show some degree of hardship in their backgrounds, instead of trying to infer it from their races." But ifa wealthy, powerful African­American like Barack Obama has faced the hardship of racism, it's a safe bet that most African-Americans face the hardship of racism. Affirmative action, in the vari­ous forms which it currently takes, infers hardship from race because race is a reli­able indicator that one has suffered hard­ships.

life differently. And when all the newly matriculated students cascade out of here each May after Commencement weekend, so very many of them begin, in small ways and large, to "light the way." The experience of sharing faith and life here in a Catholic community that prays, mourns and rejoices togeth­er will lead you to seek out parishes to pray in; propel you to serve in ACE schools; motivate you to choose Holy Cross Associates or Farm of the Child or Covenant House; and compel you to bring, through your faith, a much heightened level of ethical behavior to whatever your chosen career path. 
Maybe you remember Catholic Schools Week from your own educational past, or maybe not. But think about all the kids around South Bend and all over the nation who are celebrating, praying, participating in fundraisers, dressing down, and learning what it means to "light the way." Maybe all of us here, at this place which has an unparalleled opportunity to be a light of hope and wisdom and courage, could take a deep breath, pray Father Hesburgh 's prayer, "Come, Holy Spirit," and live as a light. 
The right to skip 
With all due respect University Provost Thomas Burish ("University clarifies absence policy," Jan. 30), I am 21 years old and feel that I am capable of making my own decision on whether or not to attend class. I'm sure most freshmen have that decision-making quality as well. 
If I skip and get a poor grade, oh well, my fault. From now on, will I need my mommy to call my professor when my tummy hurts like in high school? Is this com­munist Russia? I don't think so. 
Please don't take our last col­lege freedom of sleeping in or napping past the one easy class on our schedule. You've taken so much away from the students. Don't stoop this low. It's on­American. 
Ryan Sarb senior off campus Jan. 30 

Do your part to make your section, resi­dence hall, team or class a stronger, more welcoming community. Don't let slurs which perpetuate racism or cheapen sexuality or glorify superficial values pass unchallenged. Make sure you're spending part of each day focused on other people and not just yourself. Dare to ask for help if you're trapped by an addiction to alcohol or pornography or other self-destructive behavior. 
Through the grace of God, each of us has gifts in abundance to offer those around us. Though you could easily, maybe cynically, say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah," and never give this one more thought, I hope you won't. Take some time to pray about what you have to offer to the world, and do not fear to help light the way.

No need for attacks 
In response to Will Guappone's sug­gestion that we must accept bad behav­ior from politicians ("Truth, lies and politicians," Jan. 29), I say stop hiding behind your cynicism and recognize that voters have a real choice in this election. 
It's true that no candidate is perfect, but when one campaign is engaging in bitter, divisive and patently false attacks while the other calls for inclusion, posi­tivity, and a new way forward, plati­tudes like Guappone's insistence that politics is dirty straight up hurt our democracy. 
Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are running fundamentally different kinds of campaigns, and this year there's no need to accept lies and meanness as part of the game. Just stop making excuses and choose what is possible ­leadership that may not be perfect, but that all Americans can be proud of. 
Claire McGathey JuniOr abroad Jan. 29 


The true silverware thief 
As a senior, I have endured four years of being lumped in with our so-called "thieving" student body. I'm no thief...except for that time I stole a traffic cone and put it in the middle of the road. And that time that I took a "No Trespassing" sign while trespass­ing (just for the irony). Oh, and I totally saw a girl last year snag a nutcracker from North Dining Hall during the Christmas season. During Christmas! For shame. If you are reading this, you know who you are. Jesus is watching. 
Exceptions aside, every time that yearly summary of dining hall "theft" is published in the paper, I cringe. No more. It is time the truth came to light. My freshman year, I worked in SDH on the dishline. During my time spent plugging my nose and sift­ing through other people's refuse, I noticed something interesting. First of all, what's with people throwing away whole pieces of fruit? While they do make good projectiles for dishline food fights, I think that's a little waste­ful. Oh, and when baked potatoes hit your face they do some seri­ous damage. 
But I digress. What I noticed was that while frantically trying to keep up with the flow of trays, lots-and I mean lots-of sil­verware got thrown away. I think I know where all 12,960 spoons went, as well as any forks and knives. I'm sure that this accounts for almost all of the lost utensils, and maybe even some of the bowls, plates, and cups. Now as for the chairs and tables, I'm not so sure. But hey, I guess theo­retically those could get lost down the dishline as well. 
I guess my point, Food Services, is that when you point a finger, there are three pointing back at you.

took screen time away from fan favorites like Hurley and Locke. Also, the decision to air the first six­episodes long before the last 16 episodes was a con­troversial one. Some felt the creators had no plan for the storyline and only answered questions with more questions. 
With this, the producers announced the show would end after three more seasons and they began to satisfy many a quenching mystery. In the latter half of Season 3, "Lost" regained its original form and began to show quality episodes, one after another. This culminated 4 Premiere with the season finale that shocked and surprised the haters (who took back their harsh words about their
8p.m. 
show) and completely changed the 
story-telling narrative of the series. 
While "Lost" excites viewers with clifihangers and intrigues them with mysteries and philosophical dilemmas. it is ultimately the characters and flash­backs that are the heart of the show. Their dilemmas on and off the island and inner-demons drive the show forward. From the heroin-addled former rock star to the Korean eouple to the former torturer for the Iraqi Republican Guard, it is the depth of the characters that navigates "Lost." The viewers see that heroes are not always so perfect and villains are not always so clear-cut. 
With Season 3's thrilling conclusion, there lies the whole new mystery of who the people are on the freighter and the promises that these new characters are even more frightening and dangerous than The Others. 
The producers have compared each season to a chapter of a novel, which they unwrap and tell. I compan~ it to a live-course meal at a fine restaurant. The procedural shows like "Law and Order" or "real­ity" TV shows are like a Happy Meal at McDonald's compared to "Lost." They fill a basic need. but go no further and are not truly satisfying. No other show is as complex, deep, and intense as "Lost." It is ulti­mately a tale of survival and suffering, pain and redemption of tho human experience. Live together, die alone.

No.1 Memphis wins 15th consecutive road game; Spartans beat Illini, reach best 21-game record in school history 
Associated Press 
OXFOBD, Miss. -The rest of 
the Southeastern Conference 
might want to take notice of 
Mississippi's Eniel Polynice. 
The small forward relent­lessly drove to the basket for 1 H points Wednesday night in the Bebels' 74-58 much-need­ed victory over Vanderbilt and rendered Shan Foster, one of th1~ SEC's top scorers, inefTec­tive. 
"J>olyniee was better off the dribble than we were about getting in front of him and he was a great l'inisher," Vanderbilt coach Kevin Stallings said. "lie had six layups in the first half and live eame against one guy." 
That one guy was likely Foster, though Stallings didn't want to identify the player after he made the comment. But Ole Miss players were well aware of the score after Polyniee's tough all-around game. 
lie finished with live assists. four rebounds and two blocks and sealed the game with a steal and dunk with about three minutes left. As impor­tant, he held foster, the SEC's No. 2 scorer, live points below his average of 19 pM game. 
"E.P.'s always on the other team's best man," Ole Miss' Dwayne Curtis said. 
Polyniee provided most of the highlights -including three eye-popping reverse layups off baseline drives -but it was Ole Miss' freshmen who pulled the game out when Vanderbilt rallied in the second half. 
Led by Chris Warren, fresh­men scored 18 of Ole Miss' first 26 points in the pivotal opening minutes of the second half as the Bebels (16-3, 3-3 Southeastern Conference) stopped a two-game losing streak and sent the Commodores (17-4, 2-4) to their fourth loss in five games. 

Memphis 89, Houston 77 
Coach John Calipari shrugged when he learned Kansas lost on Wednesday night, leaving his top-ranked Memphis Tigers as the last undefeated team in the coun­try. 
Chris Douglas-Hoberts scored 30 points and Joey Dorsey grabbed 22 rebounds, match­ing a career high, as Memphis equaled the best start in school history with an 89-77 win over Houston. 
About the same time the Tigers closed out the Cougars, the Jayhawks lost 84-75 to Kansas State. Calipari only cares that his team seems to be improving with each game. 
"It's nice, I guess," he said. "Are we getting better? We got better today." 
Robert Dozier scored 17 of his 21 points in the second half and the Tigers (20-0, 6-0 Conference USA) overcame a season-high 22 turnovers to extend their regular-season winning streak to 39 games. Memphis matched its best start since 1985-86 and won its 15th consecutive road game. 
The Tigers countered their turnover total by shooting 58.5 percent, out-rebounding the smaller Cougars 49-29 and scoring 44 points in the paint. 
"We turned it over a few too 
many times, but we played 
well," Calipari said. "What you 
saw was one of our best 
efforts." 

Dion Dowell scored 23 points and Robert McKiver scored 20 for the Cougars (15-4, 4-1), who dropped to 2-10 all-time against the No. 1 team. Houston coach Tom Penders was also denied his 600th career victory. 
Penders was more resigned than disappointed afterward, conceding that the Cougars were simply overmatched. 
"They're just a great teain," Penders said. "You're going to have to play an extremely strong, efficient game, and hope they're not playing at their highest level, to knock them off." 
Michigan State 51, Illinois 
41 

Drew Neitzel scored nine of his 15 points during a key stretch in the second half, helping No. 8 Michigan State beat Illinois 51-41 and set a school record on Wednesday night. 
"The milestone will probably mean more to me tomorrow than it does right now," coach Tom Izzo said. 
The Spartans (19-2, 7-1 Big Ten) have their best 21-game record in program's 109-year history. 
The Illini (10-12, 2-7) didn't make it easy. 
Illinois went on a 17-2 run after a rough start, led at half­time and responded to Neitzel's scoring flurry by tak­ing a 32-31 lead.

Iguodala scores 18, 76ers destroy Bucks by 43 
Magic's fourth quarter run secures win over heat; Raptors Bargnani scores 19 points to defeat Wizards 
Associated Press 
PHILADELPHIA -Watching on Philadelphia's bench with a rare fourth quarter off, Samuel Dalembert felt like an investor following his hot stock tip sky­rocket on the scrolling ticker. 
Philly piled up the points ­+30,+39,+41,+47. 
Milwaukee totally crashed. 
"You want to see how far you can hold them down," Dalembert said. "We gave them no life at all." 
Andre Iguodala scored 18 points and Andre Miller had 14 to lead Philadelphia to a 112-69 victory over the Bucks on Wednesday night, the 76ers' largest win in more than 25 years. 
"This is one we need to forget about," said Bucks coach Larry Krystkowiak. 
The Sixers, who won for only the fourth time in the last 15 games, hit a pair of milestones in the rout: This was their largest blowout victory since defeating Atlanta 132-85 on Dec. 8, 1982, and the Sixers recorded their widest margin of victory in 12 seasons at the Wachovia Center. 
The Sixers had 32-point wins over Charlotte in 2005 and Seattle in 2001. 
"Oh really?" said Iguodala, his eyes widened. "It shows we just kept playing." 
Thaddeus Young scored 14 points for the Sixers, who ended the month with a 4-4 mark. Not great, but enough for rebuilding Philadelphia to find itself on the brink of a playoff spot. Coach Maurice Cheeks has tried to squash blossoming talk of a postseason push and instead worry only about winning a nice slate of home games leading into the All-Star break. 
Counting the win against the Bucks, the Sixers play seven of eight at home before the break. 
Cheeks said before the game his goal for the semi-homestand was to win all seven. Well, they're off to a nice start after punishing the Bucks for all 48 minutes. 
"That was a great game for us from start to finish," Cheeks said. 
Royal Ivey scored 17 for the Bucks, who were without lead­ing scorer Michael Redd for the third straight game because of a left knee strain. Mo Williams had 14. 
The Bucks haven't won on the road since winning at Philadelphia on Jan. 8. They are only 5-22 on the road, including an 87-80 loss at New Jersey on Tuesday. They also matched their lowest point total of the season. 
"There wasn't much fuel in the tank," Krystkowiak said. "There wasn't much they could call upon. I know they're tired, but we need to get our energy up, rest up and get our feet back under us." 
Magic 107, Heat 91 
The score suggests that it was just another Orlando Magic blowout victory over the woebe­gone Miami Heat. 
A victory, yes. 
A blowout, well, not exactly. 
Hedo Turkoglu had 27 points and 12 rebounds, Rashard Lewis scored 19 points and the Magic needed 12 consecutive points in the final quarter to pull away and beat the under­manned Heat Wednesday night. 
"Glad to have that win," Magic coach Stan Van Gundy said. "Scary game." 
Dwight Howard scored 16 points with 13 rebounds and Maurice Evans added 13 points for the Southeast Division-lead­ing Magic (29-18), who have won the last eight meetings between the Sunshine State rivals. 
Ricky Davis scored 21 points, while Luke Jackson and Chris Quinn added 14 apiece for the Heat, who played without Dwyane Wade (flu), Shaquille O'Neal (hip) and Udonis Haslem (ankle). Not surprisingly, given the lineup depletion, Miami trailed most of the way in what became its 17th loss in the past 18 games. 
But that didn't mean the Heat couldn't make things interest­ing. 
"We all knew that it was going to be tough because those guys ... they've got nothing to lose," Turkoglu said. 
Daequan Cook's jumper with 11 minutes remaining drew Miami within 83-80, and the Heat were clearly thinking upset. 
From there, though, it was all Orlando. 
An 18-1 run gave a close game the appearance of a run­away. 
"We thought we had a battle there," Quinn said. "And then they stepped up." 
In the teams' last four meet­ings at Orlando, the Magic have prevailed by an average of 23 points. 
It was the first time since O'Neal was traded to Miami that he, Wade and 1-Iaslem all missed

a game. And the diminished bench seemed to take a toll on the Heat down the stretch. Miami shot 28 percent (5-for­
18) in the final quarter, getting outscored 24-15. 
Raptors 122, Wizards 83 
The Toronto Raptors didn't have to wait long for another shot at Washington, and they certainly took advantage of it. 
Andrea Bargnani scored 19 points, Chris Bosh had 16 and Toronto used a big second quar­ter and a flurry of 3-pointers to beat the Wizards on Wednesday night. 
The 39-point margin of victo­ry matched the biggest in team history, a 112-73 win over Atlanta on April12, 2002. 
"They blew us out of the water," Washington guard DeShawn Stevenson said. 
Anthony Parker had 15 points and Jose Calderon added 11 points and 11 assists for the 
Raptors, who avenged a  108­ 
104  overtime  loss  at  
Washington on Tuesday.  

"We were mad about [Tuesday] night's game so we just came out and played our basketball game by being more aggressive," Calderon said. "We did this tonight and didn't let the other team get back." 
The top pick in the 2006 draft, Bargnani reached double figures for the third time in four games. 
"If he continues to do that, this team is going to be a lot better," Bosh said. 
Juan Dixon had 12 points and Carlos Delfino added 11 for Toronto, which finished 13-of­18 from 3-point range. The Raptors are the NBA's best 3­point shooting team, making 
42.3 percent from beyond the arc. 
Washington's Roger Mason called Toronto's shooting "phe­nomenal," but Antawn Jamison said the Haptors benefited from easy looks. 
"You can ill afford to have them shooting open jump shots like they did tonight," Jamison said. "They got a numerous amount of open jump shots and they converted them." 
Toronto has won a season­high six straight at home and eight of 11 overall. 
"More than just the 3s, it's the way we moved the basketball," Toronto coach Sam Mitchell said. "We rebounded a whole lot better, we kept our defense like we did [Tuesday] night. The difference is we shot the ball much better and we rebounded better." 
Stevenson led Washington with 16 points, Mason had 14, Andray Blatche 12 and Jamison 
11. The Wizards were without forward Caron Butler (hip flex­or) for the second straight game. 
The Wizards, who had won seven of 10, were out of this one early. Toronto scored the game's first 12 points before Stevenson made a 3-pointer. The Raptors led 28-23 after the opening quarter. 
"We just couldn't get it going," Jamison said. "We didn't com­municate. I'm disappointed with our performance defensively." 
A 3-pointer by Mason cut it to 36-32 with 7:56 remaining in the second, but that was the last time the Wizards were close. The Raptors pulled away with a 17-2 run over the next four minutes, capping the spurt with 3-pointers from Bargnani, Dixon, a hook shot by Rasho NestProvic and a :~-pointer from Delfino, forcing Washington to call timeout trailing 53-34. 
"They executed very well." Wizards eoaeh Eddie Jordan said. "We triPd different adjust­ments and we just didn't get it done. We didn't do enough to dose out people on the perime­ter and when we did, they still made shots."

Belles drop game to Olivet 
Comets catch fire i~ second half, defeat struggling Saint Mary's 
SMC BASKETBALL BOXING 
Politician refuses to appear vvith Iron Mike 
By GRIFFIN DASSATTI Sporrs Wrirer 
Despite all five starters scoring in double figures, Saint Mary's skid continued Wednesday when the Belles lost 80-70 at Olivet. 
Coming off back-to-hack confer­ence losses to Calvin and Hope, Saint Mary's (8-10, 4-6 MIAA) entered the game needing a win to get back on track in the MIAA. 
The first half looked promising, especially when two free-throws by junior guard Katie Rashid pushed the Saint Mary's lead to 21-13 with 10:13 left in the first half. But Olivet chipped away at the lead, and the Belles clung to a 33-31 lead at halftime. 
The Comets tied the score at 42 on a 3-pointer by sophomore guard Nykole Pfall" and followed that up with another trey, this time by junior guard Sarah Mangold with 13:57 to go in the game. Olivet got up by as many as six, at 55-49, with 10:15 to play. 
Twice the Belles cut the margin to just a single point -first on a Kammrath layup with 7:28 left to make the score 57-56, and later on a Newsom three to bring the score to 62-61 with 6:05left. 
But the Comets scored 15 of the game's next 17 points to open up an insurmountable lead. Olivet hit its free throws down the stretch to keep the Belles at bay until the final buzzer. 
As a group, the Belles' starters had their best offensive output of the season. Junior guard Meghan Conaty led all scorers with 17 points, including 14 in the first half. 

Oose behind Conaty were guard Alison Kessler with 15, sophomore forward Anna Kammrath with 14, junior forward Erin Newsom with 13, and Rashid with 11. 
Kammrath and Newsom also came up big on the boards, pulling down 10 and nine rebounds, respectively. 
But no bench players from Saint Mary's scored, and Olivet's reserves totaled 32 points.

South African leader under pressure from women's rights groups 
Associated Press 
JOHANNESBURG, South 
Africa -ANC leader Jacob 
Zuma withdrew from a chari­
ty fundraising banquet hon­
oring former boxer Mike 
Tyson on Wednesday after 
being criticized by women's 
groups in South Africa. 
In a country with one of the 
highest rates of rape, Zuma 
was found not guilty of rap­
ing a family friend two years 
ago. Tyson served a three­
year sentence for the 1991 
rape of an 18-year-old beauty 
queen in Indiana. 
Reporters arriving at the 
event were handed a state­
ment from organizers saying 
Zuma "had been called away 
on urgent ANC business." 
Women's groups had called 
on Zuma to withdraw from 
the event. Earlier 
Wednesday, the One in Nine

Tyson as inviting particularly his sexual distasteful Carrie Shelver advances. and abhor­
People Opposing Women Abuse Z u m a has 
rent." 
Carrie Shelver, of People Opposing Women Abuse. called Zuma's with­drawal a good step. 
"It may be, and it seems to us, that pressure placed on him in the media may have swayed him," Shelver said. 
About 50,000 rape cases are reported each year in South Africa, almost 150 per day. Women's rights groups estimate that only one in nine rapes is reported to police. 
Zuma had planned to be the keynote speaker at the banquet, where an auction of Tyson items was to benefit children's organizations. 
African National Congress officials did not immediately return calls. 
Tyson, once called the "baddest man on the planet," will tour Soweto on Thursday and be a celebrity commenta­tor at a boxing event on Saturday. 
Organizers promised Tyson would make a statement at the banquet denouncing vio­lence against women. 
However, Tyson did not address the issue. He took to the stage and made a brief statement about how pleased he was to be in South Africa and thanked the organizers for their hospitality. 
He then returned to his seat next to Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, the anti-apartheid icon and ex­wife of former president Nelson Mandela, who he befriended some years ago in New York. 
The master of ceremonies, Carol Manana, did make comments supporting women's rights and the erad­ication of violence against women. Manana is a televi­sion sports presenter and survivor of domestic abuse. 
Both Zuma and Tyson are seen as fighters who have survived harsh upbringings to become powerful popular figures. Both have had run­ins with the law, and have poor records when it comes to women's rights. 
The 41-year-old boxer, who famously took a bite out of rival Evander Holyfield's ear, also was accused of abusing his former wife. 
Zuma, who is facing cor­ruption charges, said during 
his rape 
trial that the

apologized 
for his state­

ments dur­ing his trial, but recently earned more criticism from women's groups when he took a second wife. Polygamy is in line with some South African traditions. 
Zuma's "statements prior, during and post rape trial reveal his patriarchal beliefs on men and women's roles and rights in South Africa," the statement from the One in Nine Campaign said. 
The women's groups said they couldn't protest at the banquet venue, a casino and hotel on airport land, which is considered a key national security point. Emperors Palace is hosting Tyson. 
Mark Jakins, owner of the casino and hotel, acknowl­edged many sporting heroes have been "tinged by contro­versy," but that organizers were "focusing on Mike Tyson's credentials as a boxer." 
Shelver said Tyson was a poor role model. 
"There is some skepticism about his rehabilitation and you need to be careful," she said. "The youth are an easy target. They love sporting heroes."

Irish look for fifth straight win over Michigan

Hillesland had four assists, six rebounds and a momen­tum-changing dunk, while Ayers scored 10 points in 19 minutes off the bench, including hitting two of his three 3-point attempts. 
Brey said he will keep the new lineup for the foresee­able future, including tonight's game against the Friars, because Hillesland's quickne'ss makes the Irish 
harder to defend. 
"There's a little differ­ent feel with me and [point guard] Tory [Jackson] both driving and trying to kick it to shooters," Hillesland said. 
Ayers said 

"We,re not looking past Providence. They beat Connecticut, who,s the hottest team in our league. ,, 
Mike Brey Irish coach 
coming off the bench forced him to make better use of his time on the floor. 
"It made me a little more aggressive," he said. "It gave me a little more edge." 
But the junior hasn't ruled out starting again later this season. 
"I want to keep working hard and maybe get back into the starting lineup if 1 can," he said. 
Most of Notre Dame's scoring against the Wildcats came from two familiar faces. Junior guard Kyle McAlarney, who poured in 30 last Saturday, is averaging 18.2 points per game in Big East play and was awarded the con­ference's player-of-the­week award for his per­formance. 
"He's a big part of things," Brey said of McAlarney. "His confidence and his aggressiveness can jumpstart us sometimes." 
Lost in McAlarney's suc­cess last Saturday was the play of sophomore forward Luke Harangody, who 
scored 2 5 points. The 6-foot-8 Harangody, who is aver­aging 22.5 points per game, has been espe­cially effec­tive against smaller cen­ters. 
Providence will proba­bly guard 
Harangody with forward Randall Hanke. At 6-foot­11, Hanke will have a height advantage on the Irish big man, but he will not have quite the advan­tage that 7 -footers Hasheem Thabeet of Connecticut and Roy Hibbert of Georgetown had when they slowed Harangody earlier this month. 
The Friars get most of their scoring from their guards, four of whom aver­age double-figure points per game. Their leading scorer is junior Jeff Xavier, who averages 13.1 points per game. 
At 12-7 and 3-4 in the conference, Providence is in a tie for 11th in the Big East. 
But they beat third-place Connecticut on the road on Jan. 17, so Brey is taking nothing for granted. 
"We're not looking past Providence," Brey said. "They beat Connecticut, who's the hottest team in our league." 
Notes: 
+ 
Harangody was named one of the top-30 candi­dates for the 2008 Naismith Award, college basketball's most presti­gious player-of-the-year honor.

Tonight's game is "Camo Night." Free camou­flage T-shirts will be hand­ed out to the entire lower bowl of the Joyce Center. 


At halftime, Notre Dame will honor Sgt. First Class John Adams, who has recently been named one of the United States Army's "Real Heroes." A video about Brey's trip to Kuwait over the summer for Operation Hardwood will be shown.

Allhough the Irish widened their lead in the second half. their defense lacked intensity and lost focus near the end of th<l game. 
"Our post defense was partic­ularly bad." McGraw said. "And we just quit playing at the end. They were just trying to get the ball ba(:k to trv to score." 
Providenc~ (11-9, 1-6 Big Eastl has 14 players on its ros­hlr, but only eight traveled to the game. Because Friars fresh­man guard Trinity llull, who had eight points on 2-for-5 shooting, has a stress fracture, Seymore had to practice with his team so there would be enough players. 
"You should have seen me, I was sweating, man, it was pret­ty bad." he said, laughing. 
While McGraw had her gripes about the game, she was happy with the conference win. 
"Every win is really critical for us right now," she said. "We're thinking, 'This is the game we have to win to get a bye in the first round of the big east tournament.' We've got a brutal schedule, and we've got to be ready for it. And tonight we weren't ready."

Irish coach Muffet McGraw admitted in her post-game news conference that she thought the team "quit playing" at the defensive end of the court during the second half. 
Providence also was able to pound the ball inside against the hi<>h, taking advantage ofi1s height. The Friars played Wednesday night with only eight players, but three of them were 6-foot-4 or taller-giv­ing them a significant edge during times when the Irish had 6-fbot-1 forward Becca Bruszewski in the post with four guards around her. 
McGraw also said that the team seemed to be complacent with let­ting Providence get ea<>y shot<> ifit wa'> unable to force a turnover in the press. 
"We did a nice job in the lin.i half of getting them to tum the ball over. But ifthey wernn 't turning it over, they were scoring," McGraw said. 
And even the turnovers weren't that special. Forcing turnovers in large numbers has almost become standard operating procedum for the Irish this sea<;on. Not many teams could force 29 takeaways and still boast that it wasn't a sea­son-high. (It wa<; 33 against Boston College on Nov. 24.) 
In fact, the pmss wasn't even eflective until lrnshman Devereaux Peters entered the game afu~r the first !bur minutes. The Irish were down 5-2 at that point and would fall as far baek a'> 9-3 befiwe turn­ing thn game around. A few Irish steals and bad Friar shots later, the Irish wnre back on top. 
But the Iri'ih haven't had trouble scoring against inferior teams all sea<;on, with a dozen 80-point scor­ing night<; and thrnn wins by 30 points or more. But what thny 
haven't done (<md what they 
showed they might not do if thny 
play like thPy did in the first live 

minutes Wednesday night against a 
more talentnd team) is provo their 
coiL<;istency. 
Notm Dame h1L'i strugglnd 
against every ranknd team it h<L'> 
played this season-and even a 
few unranked ones like Bowling 
Green. A slow stmi against a tnam 

like Rutgers or Pitt'iburgh -both of 
whom the lri'>h play in the next few 
weeks-would spell disa<;ter. 
Connecticut shownd the Iri'>h on 
Sunday that a small funk, like the 
one to start the Providencn gmne, 
could turn ugly fa'it with its 22-6 
run in the first half of a lopsided 
Husky victory. 
So what's next? 
Most import1u1tly, the lri'ih have 
to get better defensively or thny 
might not survive February. 
Well, they will still male the Big 

East and NCAA tournament'>. Their 
record and stren).,rth of schedule 
until now will get them that. 

But seeding count<;. Last year's team fell victim to this bea<;t, enter­ing the Big Ea<>t tourney a'> the seven-seed and March Madness as an eight. Notre Dame lost in thn confenmee tourmtmnnt to an even­ly-matehed DePaul squad fill" a one­and-done. And in the NCAA's they beat Caliii>rnia only to faen No. 1 North Carolina for a relativnly narly exit from the big dance. 
IfNotrn Dame can't piek up it'> dnfeiL'iive output fi>r what McGraw railed a "brutal schedule" in February, it could be in for another world of" hurt come March.

It seems like Notre Dame's home winning streak has been stuck on 3 I games for a long limn. 
The Irish ( I4-4, 4-2 Big I:ast) haven't played a home game since their 91-74 win over Cindnnati Jan. 15, but they have a chance to win their :~2nd straight at the .Ioyce Center tonight against Provide nee at 7. 

"It feels like we haven't lwn n honw in a wh i In," Irish -coach Mike Brey said. "I think that will energize us." Notre Dame, currently in second place in the Big 1\ast, is I 1/2 games behind eonfereneP leader c;eorgntown. The team is roming orr a 90-SO win at then-No. 1 S Villanova last Saturday. Tlw victory, which was the first confPrencn road win for the Irish, featured a lineup shirt. Brey inserted junior forward Zaeh llillnsland into the starting lineup in place of' junior Hyan Aynrs.

After suffering its first loss of the season to No. 1 Virginia Sunday, No. 11 Notre Dame defeated Michigan State 4-3 Wednesday at the Eck Tennis Pavilion. 
The Irish won despite drop­ping the doubles point; Michigan State won two of the three doubles matches. 
Spartan seniors Nick Hink and Adam Monich defeated senior Sheeva Parbhu and junior Brett Helgeson 8-4 in the first doubles match. 
:'Michigan State is very good at one and two dou­bles," Bayliss said. "We usu­ally rely on our one and two singles players and had to today as well." 
Spartan junior Alex forger teamed with freshman Billy Gardner to defeat senior Andrew Roth and freshman Stephen Havens 8-5 at No. 2 doubles. 
"Havens is a grPat ball striker," Bayliss said. "lie still has a few things to learn strategically, but he is mak­ing significant strides over­all." 
The Irish doubles teams salvaged one match with freshman Tyler Davis and junior Santiago Montoya defeating junior John Allare and freshman John Stratton S-6. 
In singles action, the Irish took charge and clinched the match. 
Parbhu lost a tough match to Hinks 6-4, 0-6, 6-2, while Helgeson easily defeated Forger 6-1, 6-4. 
Both pulled out another tight match over Allare, win­ning in three sets, 0-6, 6-3, 6-3.
