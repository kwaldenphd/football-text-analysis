Administration, Congress divided over budget-balancing restrictions 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The Reagan ad­ministration clashed with Congress yesterday in a Supreme Court con­frontation over the validity of the law that requires a balanced budget by 1991. 
Under brisk questioning from the justices, both sides engaged in a highly technical debate with far­reaching practical consequences. 
Charles Fried, the administra­tion's top courtroom lawyer, challenged the central provision of the law-the Gramm-Rudman Act­that empowers the comptroller general to determine required levels of deficit reduction. 
"Here we have an officer who gives orders to the president," said Fried. "These powers are entirely novel." 
He argued that the role of the comptroller general is unlawful because he performs executive functions under Gramm-Rudman but may not be fired by the presi­dent. 
This grant of authority violates the Constitution," Fried said. Lawyers for the House, the 
Senate and the comptroller general defended the law. 
Michael Davidson, the Senate's legal counsel, said the comptroller general performs as "a scorekeeper" under Gramm­Rudman, and the real power over deficit reduction is retained by the president and Congress. 
"The law, not the comptroller general, determines the desirable limit of deficit financing," David­son said. 
Steven Ross, representing the bipartisan leadership of the House, 
1 said the comptroller general's func­tion was the product of painstaking political compromise. 
The comptroller general was chosen for his role under Gramm­Rudman because of his in­dependence, Ross said, "in order to insure these calculations were wall­ed off from political considera­tions." 
Several justices suggested the comptroller general is actually a legislative officer, not an indepen­dent agent. 
The court, expediting considera­tion of the dispute, is expected to announce its decision by early July. 
On Feb. 7, a special three-judge

court agreed with the Reagan ad­ministration and other challengers to the law and struck down a key 
provision  that  would  force  
automatic  cuts  in  the  federal  
deficit.  
But  the  law  remains  in  effect  

pending the Supreme Court's rul­ing, and Congress also continues to struggle with balancing the budget. 
The first $11.7 billion in spen­ding cuts required by the law took effect March 1, unaffected by the decision of the three-judge panel, which suspended its own ruling pending the Supreme Court review. 
The law calls for deeper cuts un­til all red ink in the federal budget is eliminated by 1991. 
The deficit now stands at ap­proximately $208 billion, although some in Congress hope favorable economic developments will reduce it. The Gramm-Rudman law re­quires the figure to be $144 billion for the next fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. 
To reach that goal, the law would force across-the-board cuts, with half the money slashed from military spending and half from domestic programs.

The first was Dennis Hill, an

Beirut. 
Kilburn is the only American

and give blacks a significant 
politial role. 
President P.W. Botha "still has 

to answer on the question of 
political representation for blacks 
at the decision-making level," 
Morobe said. 
Reaction from white moderates was more enthusiastic. Colin Eglin, leader of the opposition Pro­gressive Federal Party, predicted an economic upturn for the country when it became "free from the restrictions of the past ... and im­bued with a new positive spirit." 
The South African Institute of Race Relations, a private organiza­tion, said abolition of the pass laws, along with official recogni­tion of black unions in 1979, was "the most important reform in South Africa since World War II." 
The government's policy state­ment said the government believed "fundamental rights should be pro­tected and that discrimination on the grounds of race or color is not acceptable."

Many of Mestrovic's sculptures was originally conceived after the around the Notre Dame campus war in Rome, proceeded to reside have curious histories concerning in the Metropolitan Museum of their construction or acquistion. Art, and finally came to Notre One such sculpture, Christ and the Dame openly exposed on a flatbed 
to the amazement of other motorists. Mestrovic was once of­fered $150,000 for this same piece in 1955 by Marshal Tito but prefer­red not to give any demonstration of support to the communist regime. There are quite a few other interesting examples of his work on campus as well, many of which are consolidated in his old studio (now a gallery of the Snite Museum). 
Ivan Mestrovic worked until January 16, 1962 when he fell ill in his studio and died later the same day. However, the spirit of Mestrovic is still alive at Notre Dame, as he once said, "Our works in this world are the impressions left by the wings of our souls, which though they are not eternal are the impress of an eternal be­ing." It is especially important to be aware of this outstanding man as he made a lasting imprint, not only on Notre Dame but on the world, in the words of Amte Tresic, a Croatian writer, "Mestrovic is not only a great artist but a very pro­found thinker. He is Proteus in everlasting evolution, always t  ~ same, yet always different, like the time and ambient atmosphere in which he works. He trys to express all the sentiments and aspirations not only of his nation, but of all humanity. He belongs not only to 
one nation but to all nations and all times."

"I feel very good about the pro­gression of the tight ends so far," said Stewart. "I think Joel has real­ly come on this spring, and I think he has a chance to follow the tradi­tion here and be a great tight end. But Andy Heck could be also with the physical tools he possesses. But there's no question we're in ade­quate shape right now."

Still, most viewers of the Notre Dame practices could not help but be impressed by the early showing of those called on to fill in the gaps. 
Included in this group of satisfied observers is Stock.

Kevin Dineen scored an unassisted goal 1 :07 into overtime, lifting the Hartford Whalers to a 2-1 victory over the Montreal Canadiens last night. The Adams Division series is tied at two games apiece. The fifth game of the series will ;be"played tomorrow night at Montreal. 
Dineen picked the puck up in the
-neutral zone, stepped around defenseman Larry Robinson and lifted a wrist shot over Canadiens goalie Patrick Roy. Mats Naslund had scored a power-play goal with 7:38 remain­ing in regulation to tie the game for Montreal. 
The Whalers scored first in the first period when a shot by Sylvain Turgeon from close range was par­tially deflected by Roy and stuffed into the net by Stewart Gavin.

Physical play intensifies in Women's Bookstore 
By KATHLEEN McKERNAN 
Sports Writer 
Referees started work yesterday in the quarterfinals of the Women's Bookstore Basketball Tournament -and not a round too soon, as moments of physical play increased with the level of competition. Ad­vancing to the semis are We Weren't Cheerleaders in High School, Double Decker Oreo Cookie, Revenge of the Quixotic Quint and The Almosts. 
We Weren't Cheerleaders in High School continued its winning string yesterday against Negligence. Fielding a team of freshmen, We Weren't Cheerleaders capitalized on some of Negligence's shooting difficulties to win 15-7. Kathleen

McDavid, playing in the low post, dominated Cheerleaders' scoring with six points, while Helen Gilboy paced the rebounding with eight boards. Volleyball player Mary Kay Waller also contributed underneath, and point guard Lauren Romeo honed her defensive skills, holding Negligence's backcourt to a combined 0-of-15 performance. 
Challenger and 4 Other Balls of Fire failed to avenge last year's third round loss to Revenge of the Quixotic Quint, losing again this year, 21-10. Last year, the Quint went all the way to the finals with three of its five players. Marilu Almeida, Regi Richter and Kara England. A fourth, Mimi Storen, played against the Quint yesterday on Challenger. Richter led all scorers with nine points. Former varsity guard Denise Basford drop­ped in eight. 

Richter, the Quint's center, ex­pressed her pleasure at playing on the same team with Basford. 
"Denise is really good," said Richter. "She's a good all-around athlete. We're really lucky to get her." 
In a minor upset, Double Decker Oreo Cookie defeated Violent Fem­mes II, the tourney's fourth seed. Oreo Cookie carries its full allowance of varsity athletes with a 
former  basketball  player,  Lisa

players  Zanette  BenpPtt  and

All Flavors Rochelle Holder. The Femmes, though, kept up with the Cookie. At one point late in the game, Cookie only Jed 15-13. In the end, however, Double Decker Oreo pull­ed ahead to win by a final score of 21-15. 
Oreo Cookie balanced its scoring across the roster. Holder finished with seven, Bennett with six and Brown with five. For the Femmes, dominating center Janet Shander turned in an excellent 9-of-12 per­formance. 
The Almosts, the tourney's third seed, used superior team organiza­tion to defeat The Pacers, 21-14. The third seed was simply over­powering on the boards. Patti Mileski pulled down 15, Mary Ellen Mileski had 13 and Laura Gleason grabbed II. 
Most of The Pacers managed to work out a scheduling conflict with registration at Saint Mary's, but the game still began without Lisa McGrath. McGrath entered the competition about 15 minutes into the game as the Pacers were trailing 8-3. Jenn Harto's six points and ten rebounds Jed the Pacers. Eight points from Gleason carried The Almosts. 
The final four remaining teams receive an off day tomorrow before beginning the semifinals on Saturday We Weren't Cheerleaders in High School will take on Double Decker Oreo Cookie, and Revenge of the Quixotic Quint play The Almosts at 5 Saturday on the Stepan courts.

Golfers expect a fight with tough Ohio teams 
By ORLANDO RUBIANO 
Sports Writer 
After spending last weekend in Columbus, the men's golf team will once again return to Ohio. this weekend's site will be in Kent, Ohio , where the Irish will participate in the 13th annual Kent St. invita­tional, as Ball St., Miami of Ohio, 
N. Illinois, Ohio and Kent St. are all ranked in the top 10. Windmill Lakes Golf Club will be the site of the tourney, with the·format calling for 36 holes Friday, and 18 Satur­day on the par 70 course. the Irish will hold a practice round today, before starting play Friday at 8:00 a.m.. They will be paired with tournament favorite Kent St. 
Notre Dame coach Noel O'Sullivan says his squad is looking forward to a stiff challenge this weekend, as the team will be mak­ing its first appearance in the an­nual tournament. 
"We are very hopeful that this will be a good tournament for us, we need to improve upon last week's finish," O'Sullivan says. "The key for us may be that we have had past success playing MAC schools, so I think our 
guys know that they can play well against the rest of the field. We are due, as a team, to play a good tour­nament."

Much More Manhood outmann­ed Keenan Inmates II in the long run, winning 21-16. Tim Brown was once again the driving factor for Manhood, shooting 9-of-18. 
The Inmates kept it close by banging under the boards to outre­bound Manhood 36-24, as George Boldus grabbed 10. The Inmates could not break out of a 16-60 shooting handcuff as many calls were contested by both teams in this rough game.

The Irish hopes for a top finish will ultimately depend on the character of the team. From the ranks emerges one person who ex­emplifies the word, character. Ac­cording to O'Sullivan, senior Lon Huffman has exhibited this trait, especially over the last three weeks. 
"Lon has been hitting the best, by far, lately," says O'Sullivan. "He has been our number one guy in the last two tournaments we have been in, and in my eyes he has played very impressively." 
O'Sullivan also noted that sophomore Richard Connelly could be a pleasnat surprise in the tourna­ment. 
"Rich is capable of shooting good rounds, which we would most certainly like to see him get, so I think he could be a big factor in us doing well this weekend." 
Naturally, the other members of the team will have to pull their own weight if the club has any illusions of finishing first. But, there is little doubt in O'Sullivan's mind that they can win the whole thing. 
"I know we can win this tourna­ment, whether we do or not of course, remains to be seen. Look­ing at it realistically, I would be happy with at least a top three placement. That would be a real compliment for the team." 
In the slam dunk contest, Peters used an air toss-bounce-slam move to please not only the judges but the crowd for the win. Despite his lack of size, David Rivers used im­pressive leaping ability to impress above the rim for second place. Pete Hebert finished third with a solid array of slams. 
At the nine foot level, Buscher twirled through a 360-degree leap from the boards to take first. Mike Shimota placed second and Mike Moore third to round out the short man's division. Unfortunately, the crowd was appeased by only one baseline slam by Ken Barlow, as both Barlow and Donald Royal declined the cheers of the gallery.

No team has demonstrated shooting prowess quite like WBBS with Ed Smerciak in the tourna­ment characterized by inside play. WBBS shot 21-of-36 as a team with Kenny Scheurman was the WBBS high man with 6-of-9 in a quickly played contest which took 25 minutes.

David Rivers sky-walked to second place in the slam dunk contest held at the Bookstore courts yesterday. In Sweet Sixteen Bookstore XV action, The Embarassing Stains earned a hard­fought victory over Mr. Coffey and the Non-Dairy Creamers. Mike Szymanski details the games at left. 
By MIKE SZYMANSKI 
Assistant Sports Editor 
The Bookstore XV Sweet Sixteen offered some intense battles yester­day as survival of the fittest nar­rowed the field to eight teams. The Bookstore courts also witnessed the high-flying slam dunk competition, producing some surprises with Jeff Peters garnering the 10-foot category, and John Buscher slam­ming for first from nine feet. 
With the advent of referees for the third day, perhaps the most fervently contested game was The Embarrassing Stains' 21-18 victory over Mr. Coffey and the Non­Dairy Creamers. 
Tim Kempton's 9-of-21 with 12 rebounds, and Mike Kelly's II re­bounds for the Stains overpowered Creamers' big men Pete Hebert and Eric J anowsky in a highly physical game. Milt Jackson, 6-of-15, and Dave McGuffey, 7-of-20, both gave fine performances in the los­ing effort. 
Tequila White Lightning outlasted a strong second half rally to defeat Tofu Chaka Khan, 21-16. Key free throw shooting and defen­sive play by Sean Cullinan, 8-of-14, in the stretch sealed the victory. Tequila's Chris Nanni turned in a strong game, shooting 6-of-13. Tofu had its problems from the field as Bill ZadeH went 1-of-10, and James Welch shot 2-of-10. 
"Tofu played well together," said Nanni, "but we can play better than we did today. Leone's Stallions (Tofu's next opponent) is bigger than us, but we will stick to our running game." 
Let's Go Crazy kept its wits while Port-a-Pit played out of control

resulting in a Crazy 21-17 victory. Crazy man Chris Perozek was the key performer shooting 5-of-9. Pit players Joe Price, 4-of-15, and Cedric Figaro, 0-of-6, were off, as Pit shot 13-of-49 from the field. 
"It was a very physical game in­side, we like to run but were hindered by injuries," said Crazy guard Carlton West. "We will need a solid effort against the Fun Bunch in our next game."

Irish offensive linemen feature potential talent 
By MARTY BURNS and MARTY STRASEN 
Assistant Sports Editors 
This spring the Notre Dame of­fense has really shown something different. And in more ways than just an occasional option pitch or flanker reverse. 
Gone are Allen Pinkett, Tim Scannell, Ron Plantz, Tom Doerger and Mike Perrino. Who's in, however, is still anybody's guess 
Spring ,Football 
'86 

as the 20-practice spnng season winds down to its final two ses­sions. 
In fact, the only thing that's cer­tain right now for line coaches Tony Yelovich and George Stewart and running back coach Mike Stock is that they have a crop of in­experienced players with the poten­tial to exceed anybody's expecta­tions. 
Here, then, is an update on the status of the offensive line and backfield as it stands right now on the spring season. 
offensive line 
An offensive line is supposed to create huge holes, but not the type that veterans Scannell, Plantz, Doerger, and Perrino made with their impending graduations. For­tunately for the Irish, veteran star­ting guard Shawn Heffern does return to add some stability in the trenches. 
This Joss of depth, along with the new blocking assignments required by head coach Lou Holtz' new of­fensive system, has opened things up at every other position on the line but the right guard slot manned by Heffern. Still, the unit as a whole has responded well to the challenge and the holes have begun to fill. 
"We lost a lot of guys from last year and (the coaches) put in a new system, so it was tough at the beginning," said Heffern. "But we're really not that inexperienced because the second string played a Jot last year. · 
"Also, this year the coaches are stressing the little things, hustling around the ball, enthusiasm. We're finally getting a solid grasp of the offense. We have a ways to go but I definitely feel we're getting close 
r 
to being able to play Michigan." 
Just who will be playing when the Irish face the Wolverines Sept. 13 is difficult to say at this stage. Besides Heffern, center Chuck Lanza, guards John Askin and Tom Freeman, and tackles Byron Spruell, Pete Rokich, and Tom Rehder have all played well. Among the other canqidates for playing time have been converted guard Tom McHugh at center, and Tom Riley, Joe Kelty, Dom Prin­ziavalli and Rick Michalak filling in the rest of the line. 
Veteran Joel Williams seems to have the reins on the tight end posi­tion, as his steady imporvement over the spring campaign allowed Rehder's move to tackle. Backing up Williams is emerging freshman Andy Heck, who has been battling it out with walk-on Mike Brennan and converted linebacker Kurt
