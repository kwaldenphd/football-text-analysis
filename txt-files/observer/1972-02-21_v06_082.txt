SchlOsser cmnounces; 
intends to 11se 'fonnal

by T.C. Treanor Obst>rver Assistant Editor 
Charging that "student government is in a sad state of inac­tivity," and that "the social and cultural life at Notre Dame is in hi berna t ion, " 0 ff­campus Junior Joe Schlosser yesterday announced his can­didacy for Notre Dame's Student Body Presidency. 
Schlosser, who last year lost a bid to

the off-campus Indiana Public Research Group. 

-Schlosser, an American Studies Major from Plainfield, New Jersey, said he will use "the formal student government structures for gauging student opinion." and "the formal university governance structure for pressing student demands." 
He contended that "In its leadership capacity, student government must stil}lulate the students to question administrative policies, plans, and action. Student government officers often have the information students need." 
"No behind -the -scenes deals," Schlosser promised. 
Schlosser complained about the performance of current SBP John Barkett in this year's parietal hours SLC meeting held in the Engineering building. 
"There were six hundred people there and the thing just kind of fell apart. A trickle resulted from a powerful surge of student support," he said. 
"Student Government's responsibility is to press student needs as first priority," Schlosser contended. "The officers of student government must maintain an accurate sense of student desires and opinions -they must implement student opinion even when it conflicts with personal opinion." 
"We don't feel that Student Government should run on what we want -but what the students want," Schlosser said. 

Schlosser proposed no immediate changes in student government structures. 
"The Hall President's Council has the potential to deliver student opinion accurately," he speculated. "But it tries to come to a con­senseus for all twenty halls but a consenseus often ignores the minority halls." 
"We have entered the race for SBP and SBVP to put life into the formal structure," he said. 
"We want to be elected on our philosophy," Soldati echoed "We think our philosophy will become evident in the course of the campaign." 
Schlosser pledged himself to "a new attitude in student government based on self-determination of students directing their own lives." 
"We intend to transform the past rhetoric of student power into action," he said. 
Schlosser and Soldati also promised to "revitalize the cultural atmosphere." "We can privide time, space, information and funds to individual artists," Schlosser said, "The energies of these students can be actualized: coffeehouses, poetry readings, music sessions, craft workshops." 
Schlosser also pledged several unspecified campaign "innovations." 

Rogers joins race; wants to adopt stay hall system at SMC 
by T.C. Treanor Observer Assistant Editor 
Sophomore Class President Maureen Rogers yesterday evening became the second officially -an­nounced candidate in the St. Mary's Student Body Presidential Race. 
Miss Rogers, who will run with Sophomore Mary Mack, would try to "establish the stay­hall system at St. Mary's" and "cen­tralize the college's

she contended that the stay-hall system would "build up hall counsels 

and make people build up the ·halls." "One of the main reasons this hall (Regina) is in trouble is that everybody here can't wait until she gets out," Rogers contended. 
She said that "Our emphasis will be in two areas: hall life and services." According to Miss Rogers, "Strengthening hall community will provide a new impetus for legislation, both on the hall level and campus-wide." 
She also favored making the Judicial Board a hall-level operation. According to the Junior Class President, the Judicial Board is "not applicable to the students now. Students will think of the J-Board, and they'll think of punish­ment." 
Miss Rogers would "reduce punishments and substitute instead constructive work for the hall." 
She contended that "situations weren't the same across campus. Parietals-and rules­shouldn't necessarily be the same in Regina and Augusta halls." 
According to Regers, "halls, not student government, ought to press for parietals." 
Miss Rogers echoed Notre Dame Student Body Presidential candidate Chuck Luken's con­tention that the President must apply "diplomacy and pressure" to administration and Trustees in order to get things done. 
She said that "student governmental philosophies (at Notre Dame and St. Mary's) seemed to be two extremes of a spectrum, but they were really a lot closer than they looked. Both philosophies were good ones, but not complete." 
But she did say that many of the objectives of 
St. Mary's Barlow "had not been attained." She said that she favored "many of the same ser­vice," including: --a birth-control information center --more money for minority scholarships and financial aid. --a day-student commissioner. Miss Rogers contended that the one hundred four off-campus day students had been treated "like high school students" by St. Mary's. --drug information center. --a cooperative grocery. She suggested renting space from the school and setting up a co-op run by students, with student employees, so "that students can buy their groceries there instead of going to the snack bar and paying crazy prices." --Health and Psychological services. According to Miss Rogers, "two people have had nervous breakdowns this year that might have been prevented if we had proper psychological ser­vices." 


Caruso in running; pledges 'to go as far as the students want' 
by T.C. Treanor Observer Assistant Editor 
Gary J. Caruso, a member of the St. Mary's student assembly, Junior Class Executive Coordinator, and former Co­exchange Dining Director, last night announced his can­didacy for Notre Dame's student body presidential post. 
In an address given before approximately fifty people in Lyon's hall chapel, Caruso pledged to go "as far as the students want" in 
and say 'act.' " 
pressing the ad­ministration for change. "We show the initiative and place the burden on 
the shoulders and say 'act,' " Caruso suggested. Caruso also accepted Pangborn Senator Chuck Luken's invitation to debate. 
Caruso, who comes from Canonsburg, Penn­sylvania, will run with Flanner Senator Bob Long, a Sophomore from Monroeville, Pa. 
Caruso said he would take "drastic action, if necessary" in behalf of co-ed dorms or "whatever else the student body really wants." 
"If the student body wants, really wants co-ed dorms, I'll go as far as renting U-hauls and moving some men into different dorms. So then the administration says, 'No, you can't move.' I say fine, get the national guard or maintenance to move us out, and while you do that, we'll stand on the side without any disturbance, but we'll also have NBC and CBS there showing the country what ND is really like." 
Caruso accused current SBP John Barkett of "Backing down" on the parietals issue, con­tending that "we blew our chance to change parietals this year because the SBP backed own." 
Caruso also predicted that the parietals issue would crop up again next year. "Next year when we have men and women dorms those same rules will be on the books," Caruso said, "but this time they will be enforced. So I foesee another parietals confrontation." 
The former Co-ex commissioner said that "many smaller but aggravating problems can be changed by simply nagging those in charge...'But no one ever tries. They sit up there and say 'We're changing this structure, or we went to that meeting.' A hell of a lot of good that does for our snowbound cars, or missed classes." 
He argued that if student government "just gets some of these smaller things done, along with introducing more student union ac­tivities...when an issue like parietals comes along, then the students will rally for a cause, and all the SBP has to do is lead them, not refuse them like this year." 
Caruso's running-mate, Long, suggested four changes in Student Union. They are: --a Winter carnival "patterned along the lines of An Tostal weekend" --a renegotiation of the current ACC contract --"higher quality groups of greater appeal" for concerts --remodeling of LaFortune Student Center facilities. 
Caruso said that the facilities could be remodeled if student government "offers a sum of money from the student ogovernrnent budget asks the administration to match it.

Over seventy-five percent of Notre Dame students have signed the petition to put the $3.00 IN­PIRG fee on the student bill for the fall semester, according to INPIRG spokesmen Bill Rahner and Gerry Nagle. 
Forty-two percent of Saint Mary's students signed the same petition yesterday afternoon when twenty five Notre Dame and SMC students petitioned the SMC halls during Open House.

The next step in the INPIRG process is to get the $3 added to the student bill through the Office of Student Accounts. According to Rahner, the students are in a good bargaining position. 
As to whether they will suc­ceed, Rahner said, "We really don't know yet, because the University really didn't give us a firm figure to shoot for." 
Nagle said that the officers of the University, the Vice­Presidents Council, will have the final word on the INPIRG request. He said that the INPIRG staff itself was satisfied with their work, and noted that over 80 percent of on-campus students signed the petition. Saint Mary's petitioning will

Nixon arriv~s in Peking 
world briefs 
<Cl 1!172 New York Times News Service 
(cl 1!172 New York Times 
Pt>king, Ft>b 21-President Nixon and the Panoply of the American Presidency arrived in China this morning to mark the end of a generation of hostility and to begin a new, but still un­defined relationship between the most powerful and the most populous of nations. 
Mr. and Mrs. Nixon, leading an official paty of 15 but a total contingent of more than 300 Americans, flew in from the Pacific across the muddy mouth of the Yangtze River and touched down at Shanghai's Hung Chiao airport at 9 A.M. (8 p.m. Sunday 
E.S..T.) 
After taking tea at the teminal there, they were to fly on with a Chinese navigator across the wintry north plain toward a scheduled landing in Peking at 
11 :30 a.m. and a cordial official welcome. 
The welcome promised to be relatively restrained. Foreign diplomats stationed in Peking were advised not to come to the airport and it was doubtful that the ceremony would be the kind of full-throated reception given to China's warmest friends. 
Premier Chou En-Lai will lead the reception committee at the Capital Airport. And it is his handshake that will symbolize the end of American ostracism of his Communist Government. Nixon will be grasping the hand that John Foster Dulles spurned at Geneva in 1954, when the

There was to be an honor guard and the playing of anthems at the airport. But there are to be no welcoming speeches for the airport assemblage of the worldwide television audience that could watch the arrival here over an especially imported satellite communications system. 
Nixon and Chou are to meet again this afternoon for at least two hours of formal discussion, and they will probably trade toasts at an official banquet this evening.But for the moment they intend to say next to nothing in public about their conversation until they issue a communique near the end of the eight-day visit. 
The schedule for the rest of the week in Peking and for brief visists to Hangchow and Shanghai next weekend has not been announce. But if appears that the American and Chinese leaders will meet almost every day, including one or two calls by Nixon or Chairman Mao Tse­Tung, the founder and leader of China's Communist state.

The Vice-Presidents Council will soon be called upon to decide whether or not to allow the three dollar InPIRG fee on the tuition bill. Over seventy five percent of the Notre Dame student body has signed a petition indicating support for placing the charge on the statement. 
Putting extra fees on the student's financial statements is not a privilege granted lightly. Rather each request is carefully weighed by the Vice-President's council and permission almost never is granted. In fact there are only two organizations that have such a fee on the bill now--the Observer and Notre Dame Student Government. 
That a position on the bill is granted only to special groups, groups that serve virtually every student, is a good thing. The bill is not a means to finance each and every campus group, or even part of them. It is meant as a revenue collecting device for the university and for those unique organizations that usually touch each and every student during the year. 
InPIRG is such an organization. With the money that the students voluntarily give to it, it will be able to fund research teams that will represent the consumer's interests in the state. These teams will be able to counteract the vicious influence that industry's lobbies exert on legislators and government officials. 
Much talk about change goes on at Notre Dame. Much talk about community and lots of talk about life in general. Most students hate pollution, despise legislators who are owned by-the corporate plutocrats, are scornful of the tax structure which allows mammoth companies to get away with paying few taxes and lacksidasical enforcement of anti-trust laws and industry controlled regulatory agencies. 
No Vice-Presiden of Notre Dame is in favor of any of the above ills. No Vice-President would ever say that none of the above are not grave and serious problems. We think that no Vice-President can vote against having InPIRG on the bill. This organization is one of the best hopes we have for turning this country around. Each and every one of the Vice Presidents should realize this when he votes, and vote affirmatively. 
Telegram 
The Governor of Indiana, the Honorable Edgar Whitcomb has vetoed the bill which would have given eighteen year olds the right to drink. 
The Governor feels that the number of deaths that occur from drunk driving would shoot up if eighteen year olds were allowed to imbibe. In response to his forceful gesture, the Editor-in -Chief of the Observer has sent the following telegram: Excellency: Congratulations on vetoing the bill allowing eighteen year olds the right to drink. How such a despicable measure ever gotpast the great legislators of this state is beyond me. But now, with one stroke of your pen, you have done more than a minister of the Lord himself was able to do-you removed this evillegisla tion from the books. By standing up to the combined interests of the dealers of demon rum and those miserable college students you have exhibited rare moral courage, for a politican, and are worthy of great praise. Your action is especially commendable in light of the fact that these youngsters have been given the right to vote and could very well wreak vengence upon your [)art at the next election. Our modern, safe, highway system is witness to far too many deaths caused by drunken driving already. If eighteen year olds were allowed to indulge an awful carnage would result -a carnage almost as terrible as the conflict in Vietnam. My hope is that the legislature will support your action and sustain your veto, despite the fact that they, unlike yourself will stand for re-election and be forced to face their younger constitutents. Again best wishes and sincere congratulations. You have made the state of Indiana proud of you, in spite of what some may say! 
Yours truly,

For What It's Worth 
The SBP election is finally beginning to look like an exciting cam­paign now that Gary Caruso has joined the race. 
Caruso has been the center of various controversies ever since he was connected with the botched Freshman class elections and led the fight for sophomore cars on campus while Sophomore Class Executive Director. 
Since then he has faded from his behind the scenes seat as con­troller of his class government to unsuccessfully seek an SLC seat, charge the Observer with favoritism in the campaign, co-author a parietal proposal for SMC dorms and lead the co-ex dinner program until he was fired last week and charged his former boss, Research and Development Commissioner Ed Ellis, with playing little bureaucratic games. 
Caruso does not have an impressive record, and has made a few political enemies. There is bound to be a bit of mudslinging this campaign and it will probably start in Caruso's camp with criticism of Hall Life Commissioner Bob Higgins, a candidate and close friend of Ed Ellis. 
Without Caruso the campaign would be very dull. None of the other four candidates are really outstanding as student politicians go. 
Higgins gathered most of his experience this year in John Barkett's cabinet. Most of his time has been spent compiling a hall life report, which is yet to appear, and helping INPIRG establish itself on campus. If Higgins had designs on this year's election, his foresight in chosing the hall life commission is commendable and hopefully will remain with him if he is elected, but his lack of experience will be a big hindrance. 
Floyd Kezele, by far, has the most experience in the art of campus government, and the art of dealing with the duLac administrators. All of it has come from his membership on the SLC, where he is vice chairman. A member since November 1970, he created the present committe system to save time and improve efficiency, and has been a leader in several student causes such as the sanctions issue and having SMC representatives on the SLC. Kezele, however, has not had much contact with student government outside of the SLC. 
Ombudsman Paul . Dziedzic might be considered a major can­didate by some. Unfortunately he has not distinguished himself as a student leader. He has tried though, with a shortlived attempt to define the Imminent Danger Clause, by joining the SMC Student Assembly, and getting appointed to the Hall Life Committee. He also drew some attention with a national voters' peace pledge letter drive. 
An even more undistinguished candidate is Chuck Luken, a senator from Pangborn. Luken spent his sophomore year in Tokyo, and is a hall petitioner for INPIRG. As in every election there is a joker, and this year he comes from the South Quad. Identified only as "Greeker", he promises to annex South Bend and merge with USC. Greeker claims the merger with Southern Cal would solve at least two ND problems: girls and our poor poor football record with the Trojans. Transportation between campuses will be a problem, but the Greeker has a solution, build a barr street between the two,

Co-ex Clarification 
Editor: 

Just two points of clarification concerning your article about the Co-ex dining ticket fiasco: 1) I said that Mr. Ellis was playing games and NOT the Hall President's Council, 2) Ed Ellis FIRED me from my job as Co-Ex rlirector---I did not give in to him or anyone else --I still believe that tickets at the Student Union is the only fair and best way to handle the program (fifty tickets at the Union and fifty tickets to each hall per day might be the best way>.

And Another Minority 

Editor: 
In recent weeks various men have expressed their feelings concerning their sexual preferences, I too feel that I must bare my bosom in this regard. 
1Homosexuals and bisexuals are, no doubt, repressed sects, but by far the most downtrodden of all sexual minorities are those practitioners of beastiality. 
Oh why, oh why must we be discriminated against'? Gays can room together, straights have parietals, I should be allowed the comfort of my dog. 
How can I describe the feeling that swells inside of me as I wander through a flock of sheep or prance through a gaggle of geese'? Variety is the spice of life, and who among you can quarrel with getting back to nature?

Dorm Complaints 
Editor: 
The article in the Observer by Marlene Zloza compelled me to write this letter. It appears to me that very few students are satisfied with the proposed girl's dormitories for next year. Miss 
Zloza expressed disappointment with the idea of living in either Walsh or Badin Halls next year. There are at least 180 Walsh residents who are even more distressed with their eviction notice. 
Recently two SMC Co-eds objected strenuously to the decision, "they gave us the two worst dorms on campus!" Most Walsh residents will tell you that Walxh is the finest hall on campus and very few want to leave. In fact, most of the students presently living in Walsh specifically requested residence there. It would seem that some better accomodations could be arranged. Why move guys out that want to stay and move girls in that feel cheated? 
Last year Walsh remodeled it's basement, many Walsh men sacrificed at least on week of their summer vacation to return early to help with the work. In September money was collected from each resident to buy a new T.V., etc. It seems regretable to evict these same guys six months later. I believe that the 

University could reach a more satisfactory solution. Sincerely, 
Brent Shreiner

I do admire your newspaper for 
its gadfly courage and integrity 
in printing stories fearlessly. I do 
wish some other, so called more 
liberal institutions had student 
newspapers as enlightened as 
yours. 
I have come across the story by 
Gahlib Ahmes <Ghalib Ahmed?) 
in the Observer last Wednesday. 
It is entitled: "Go Home Geof­
frey" My answer is as follows. 
No, No-America, America!! 
I have been a Human Rights 
Officer of the United Nations and 
I left that career appointment in 
order to be the Visiting Professor 
at St. Mary's College in 1967. I 
agree that in Pakistan human 
rights are still being violated. But 
that is no reason for denying 
minorities, be they racial or 
intellectual, their civil rights in 
an advanced country like the 
United States. Why should I be 
blamed for the actions of 
Pakistan authorities. In fact I 
wasthefirst person who publically 
criticised the dictatorship of ex­
President Sir Ayub Khan back in 
1960. In 1965, I authored a new 
theory of justice: Justice is the 
Absence of Dictatorial 
perogative. In 1966 I wrote my 
paper on the denial of human 
rights in my motherland. It is 
now an Honor Paper at Harvard. 
While I was at St. Mary's College, 
I was invited for a guest lecture 
at Syracuse Univer:.tty, .J.be 
lecture critices the orutality of 
Ayub Khan regime so 
vehemently that several s­
ycophants and scholarship 
holders from Pakistan booed me 
magnificently. One day when the 
story of fight for democracy by 
few is written, my contribution 
will not be ignored. In 1970, after 
fighting my battles, I left 
Pakistan because I could no 
longer continue in a dictatorial 
regime. Incidently my income in 
Pakistan was at least 6 times my 
earnings in the US. Mr. Gahlib A­
hmes, in his eagerness to pease 
some, should not be irresponsible 
with facts. 
I have not criticised the ND 
students. I have criticised ND 
administration for its bigoted 
personnel policies. When did they 
first hire a negro teacher'? Why 
have they not employed any
black man in any administrative 
position? For more than 100 
years, they could not find a 
qualified black man; the 
qualifications for an assistant 
dean are B.A. or M.A. The 
University started hiring ­
minorities for teaching posts only 
recently for pure tokenism 
reasons. 
I am not wealthy in America. I 
barely manage to survive -but with my head high. I have fought bigotry without distinction as to race, color or national origin. I consider America to be my home. Isn't it the Nation of Immigrants? I must have done something right that I am the youngest man in America listed in all major Who's Who's. IfI were white or an Uncle Tom, 1 would be the president of some University. In fact I see · nothing wrong with a Muslim being the president of ND and a christian heading Al-Azhar 
University. Merit should count 
more than labels. 

Very little intelligence or decency is needed to see that discrimination prevails at ND and this must be corrected. I see something wrong at ND, and I am trying to change it. Incidentally Mr. Ahmes has some glamorous ideas about asst' deanship, it's a ­lowly-paid job. Incidentally, a Vice-Presidency is open at ND. And speaking about my idealism.. .! did prove my ex­cellence at SMC with my on-job performance. At the end may I ask Ahmes to please wake up and not compromise his conscience for the sake of scholarship potential or an attendantship at the Library. We can build a better America and I am doing my bit, bit by bit and with a little bite. I am doing what I can do for my country, removing last remnants of bigotry here. 
Sincerely yours,

Abortion 
Editor: 

The recent barrage of verbal 
abuse leveled at the Knights of 
Columbus for its allgedly "re­
volting" ad in this noble journal 
has prompted me to add 
something to this inexorable heap 
of dung. My opinions are based on 
a selfish belief in the right to life, 
and I care not whether they are 
shared or decried. 

Recent history has shown this ­campu~ to be painfully apathetic regardmg any issue. It, then, is surprising that anything as "tri­vial" as the issue of life should ­raise even an eyebrow among the socially (and morally?) elite of this community. However, all good attitudes must come to an end, and I suppose this issue is just as pertinent as Co-Ex tickets. Therefore, let me interject my two cents into the debate and then dissolve into the oblivion of the printed page. 
Although many people take gr­eat pains to confound this issue with highly patronizing and in­tellectual bullshit, the fact rem­ains that the moral implications are distinct: Abortion is murder. It is an indefensible evil with ugly ramifications on the whole of our society. 
With this in mind, I can only ­add that it takes a minute quant­ity of ·intelligence to compare sacrificed human beings with "squashed frogs." Finally, I offer no apologies for the K. of C. abor­tion in its most antiseptic form.

The Purdue tankers slowed down the high flying Notre Dame swim team Saturday afternoon, handing the . Irish an 84-39 drubbing in West LaFayette. 
In the one-sided dual meet, the Irish swimmers were only able to come up with two first place finishes. 
Gene Krathaus and freshman Jim Kane carried the Irish colors in the disappointing performance in the Boilermaker pool. 
Kane captured first place in the 100-yard freestyle, and also managed a second place finish in the 200 yard freestyle. 
Krathaus won a blue ribbon in the 50 yard freestyle, and added a third place finish in the 100 yard freestyle. 
ND fencers split pair 
by Joe Wilkowski The Irish fencing team split a pair of matches with Big Ten rivals on Saturday in East Lansing. They easily polished off Michigan State, 18-9, but fell to a strong Ohio State team, 15-12. 
In the first match of the af­ternoon, the foil team led Notre Dame to the victory over Michigan State. The foilsmen racked up an impressive 8-1 record over the Spartans. The epee and saber teams con­tributed 5-4 victories to the decision over State. In this contest, the victory was insured early, and Irish substitutes in all three weapons ran up the score against the host club. 
Against Ohio State, however, the foil team quickly went from hero to goat as it dropped an 8-1 decision to the Buckeye foilsmen and cost Notre Dame the match. The epee team made a strong showing with their 6-3 record, but unfortunately, due to a staggered start, most of their theatrics came after the match was decided. The saber team again finished 5-4. 
Junior Mike Matranga led the Notre Dame fencers Saturday, compiling a perfect 5-0 record in epee. Senior sabremen Ron Sollitto and Matt Fruzynski again turned in fine performances, Ron going 5-l and Matt 4-2 on the afternoon. Jim Mullenix paced the foil team at 3-2. 
The fencers will meet three more Big Ten foes on the road next weekend, taking on Purdue

Joe O'Connor added two third place finishes to the Irish totals, scoring in the 1000 yard freestyle and the 500 yard freestyle. 
Larry LaFratta, John Sherk, Ed Strack, and John Balthrop also turned in third place per­formances for the Irish. LaFratta ended up with third place in the 1 meter diving, Sherk third in the 50 yard freestyle, Strack third in the 200 yard butterfly and John

in 4:21. In the 167-pound match, 
Mike Kemp battled Bob Hickey to 
an 8-all deadlock. 
Rick Peterson scored St. Francis' final three points of the night with a 7-3 decision over Rick Komar in the 177-pound duel. But 190-pound AI Rocek came back with a quick pin of Bob Madden at 3:05 of their match, and heavyweight Mike Fanning recorded the fastest pin of the night, taking AI Diehl to the mat at 2:36. 
Notre Dame stands 11-3 on the season, a team record for vic­tories. The next dual meet for the Irish matmen is scheduled for March 4 at Milwaukee, where they will face Marquette University. 
This weekend, six members of the team, headed by Mike Fanning and Ken Ryan, will travel to Cincinnati for the qualifying rounds of the NCAA Wrestling Tournament. The first three finishers 'in each weight class will advance to the final ro­
