This week will mark the beginning of a new phase in the lives of 377 first-year students, 11 linkage stu­dents from Holy Cross and 42 transfers who will call Saint Mary's home this fall. 
The Saint Mary's class of 2006 is strong academically, said Saint Mary's director of admissions Mary Pat Nolan. The middle 50 percent of the class has a grade point average ranging from 3.33 to 3.91, SAT scores from 1060-1230 and ACT scores from 22-27. 
While the majority of the students are from the Midwest, the first year stu­dents come from many other areas.

INSIDE COLUMN 
It's t-o--w-n-i-e 
Oh, good, you made it past the front page. Now, only 26 more pages of advice, welcome let­ters, campus maps and athletic team previews to go. 
It's all very useful in that "thanks for giving 

me even more stuff to read this weekend" kind of way. Poor freshmen. At this point, some of you have probably received so many mailings and information packets that going to the bathroom without a list of detailed instructions is pos­ing a problem. 
Just for kicks, here's another list. Don't worry, it's a fun one. 
But just because I'm no "Dear Abby" don't think that these aren't wise words. In fact, consider 
Jason McFarley 
Editor in Chief 
clipping the column and saving it in a nice 
frame, wooden if you have one. Just a thought. 
Anyway. on with the list of dos and don'ts for life at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. Of course, life at the University and the College means life in South Bend, so we'll call this "the good, the bad and the Bend." 
First, an admission. I know a Notre Dame stu­dent who's from the Bend. We'll call him Jason McFarley since he's me. Sure enough, I've lived here for almost a decade now and in northern Indiana for all my life. 
So here's rule No. 1: Remember, the term "South Bend resident" is tops with me and my ilk. But if you must refer to us by the "t" word. please spell it "townie" and not "towny." 
We may not have much choice in the matter of being from South Bend, but darn it, we will have some control over our indigenous nickname. 
Another rule: l don't care what the sign says; for the next four years, you live in South Bend ­not Notre Dame, Ind. Get used to telling people that South Bend is where you live and go to school. And say it with pride, for crying out loud. You're going to college in the Midwest, not being banished to a Siberian prison. Deal with it. 
On that note, if by Siberian prison you imagine cold weather and strict rules, then disregard that last thought. 
Sorry 'bout that. But you'll thank me for these next observations. 
Here's the first: Townies are people, too. It's not all that necessary to go out of your way to shun us. 
Inevitably, you will venture off campus late one weekend night, destined for a downtown South Bend bar. In the back ofyour mind will be the story that some junior told you about the 35­year-old townie with two teeth, a mullet and no shoes who tries to pick up unsuspecting coeds at Boat Club. 
Fear not, the story's bogus. That guy has at least three teeth and got a better haircut this summer. 
Unless I've blown it at this point, all this is meant to get you to realize the charm of life here. Notre Dame and Saint Mary's long have realized that they are inextricably linked to South Bend, and both schools have invested a lot of money and other resources in the community. 
Someplace before the cornfields and flat farm­land begin, there's a city beyond the University, the College and Turtle Creek and College Park apartments. You'd do well to explore more ofit than the bars, stores and restaurants. 
Welcome, freshmen, to top-notch schools and a wonderful city. You're in a great place. Take it from a towny, er, townie.

Film advisers to include Scorsese 
Special to The Observer 
Film directors Sydney Pollack and Martin Scorsese and actress Catherine Hicks are among the mem­bers of a newly established Advisory Council for the Performing Arts at Notre Dame. 
Other council members are Jeannelle Brady, Elkhart, Ind.; John 
S. Cullen II, Buffalo, N.Y.; John Goberman, New York City; Martha Head, Vail, Colo.; Jeremiah P. O'Grady, Radnor, Pa.; Mark Radcliffe.Tulsa, Okla.; Edward R. Smith, San Francisco; Susan St. James, Litchfield, Conn.; Timothy L. Strader, Corona de! Mar, Calif.; and Christine R. Swanson, Pasadena, Calif. 
The advisory council will guide Notre Dame's future endeavors in the performing arts, which will be boost­ed in 2004 with the completion of the University's new Marie P. DeBartolo Center for the Performing Arts. 
Now under construction, the 123,000-square-foot DeBartolo Center will cost more than $50 million and has been underwritten with a portion of a $33-million gift to Notre Dame in 1989 from the late Edward J. DeBartolo, a 1932 Notre Dame gradu­ate, in honor of his wife, Marie. 
The center will be home to the University's Department of Film, Television and Theatre and will house five performance spaces: the 900-seat Leighton Concert Hall, underwritten by South Bend civic leader and phil­anthropist Judd Leighton and his late wife, Mary Lou; the 350-seat Patricia George Decio Drama Theatre, under­written by Notre Dame Trustee Arthur J. Decio in honor of his wife; the 100-seat Regis Philbin Studio Theatre, underwritten by the popular television host and 1953 Notre Dame graduate; a 200-seat cinema theatre; and a 100-seat organ and chorale hall. 
An accomplished actor, director and producer, Pollack is a two-time Academy Award winner, as both director and producer of the 1985 film "Out of Africa." Other films he has directed include "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" "The Way We Were," "Three Days of the Condor," "Absence of Malice" and "The Firm." A South Bend native, he is chief exec­utive officer of Mirage Productions, which has produced such films as "Presumed Innocent," "The Fabulous Baker Boys" and "Sense and Sensibility." 
Scorsese is the director of such notable films as "Taxi Driver," which won the Palme d'Or at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival, "Raging Bull," "Goodfellas" and "Casino."

Orientation gives transfers chance to adjust 
By TERESA FRALISH 
N""'s Writer 
While Notre Dame and Saint Mary's begin to welcome about 2,500 new freshmen, another group of newcomers, transfer students, prepare to make their way on campus. This fall. 131 transfer students will enroll at Notre Dame and 43 at Saint Mary's. These numbers are average figures for the fall semester. 
All transfers are entering as either sophomores or juniors and bring previous experience at another college to Notre Dame and Saint Marv's. 
"Transfers are ve·ry special because they have had an experience somewhere else," said Mary Pat Nolan, director of admissions at Saint Mary's. "When they come to Saint Mary's, they adjust faster to the Saint Mary's family and seem very happy with their college choice." 
Along with experience at another school, transfer stu­dents also contribute a wide range of views and a sense of assuredness about their deci­sion, according to Michael Gantt, assistant director of admissions at Notre Dame. 
"[Transfer students bring] a sense of maturity and a variety of experience," Gantt said. "They can bring a diversity of opinion."

"Statistics parallel the freshmen in terms of quality and geographic dis­tribution," said Nolan. 
Three international students, from Georgia,_ Albania, and Rwanda, have also made their way to Saint Mary's. 
After being admitted, trans­fers must begin the search to find local housing, as both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's do not guarantee on-campus housing to transfer students. Despite having a high percent­age of on-campus students, all students at Saint Mary's who wish to live in a residence hall have been able to, according to Gerry Madsen, assistant direc­tor of residence life at Saint Mary's. "We're in the 90th percentile for capacity, but 1 wouldn't say we're at a short­age," said Madsen. 
While some transfers at Notre Dame have been assigned to a residence hall, the majority of students have been forced to look for other options. According to Gantt, Notre Dame faces a severe a housing shortage as last year due to fewer students living off campus than the University had originally planned for. 
In a reversal from last year, women transfer students are being given on-campus hous­ing much more slowly than men. "This year it's a problem for women," said Gantt. 
Residence Life officials at Notre Dame declined to com­ment. 
Both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's offer special orienta­tion events tailored to specific issues and concerns that trans­fers have. Notre Dame's trans­fer orientation began Thursday with a mass at Sacred Heart Basilica and lun­cheon with parents. while Saint Mary's program began Friday with a luncheon for stu­dents. The College's Office of Student Activities and Notre Dame's Office of Undergraduate Admissions handle the preparations for transfer orientation. 
Planners for the orientation programs said they hoped the events would acclimate the new students to campus life. 
"My biggest hope is that they feel like they belong at Notre Dame," said Gantt. "We want them to feel welcome and acclimated to the Notre Dame culture." 
Both schools' programs include transfer orientation counselors who were once transfer students themselves. 
Georgeanna Rosenbush. director of student activities at Saint Mary's, said the coun­selors help provide incoming students with the best possible opportunity to feel welcome at their new school. 
"We hope it helps them to make a smooth transition to our college," Rosenbush said.

Ins and outs of campus leadership 
Finding where first.year students fit in the big picture 
Libby Bishop President 

story by JASON McFARLEY 

Your new roommate was senior class president in high school. You were the student council secretary last year. If either of you wants to get involved in politics at Notre Dame, you're in luck. There's a leadership position here for anybody who wants one. But freshmen, take note: Notre Dame student government is a complex tangle of acronyms, committees and boards. Here's a basic sketch. 
Office of the President 
The different branches of campus government make up the Student Union. 
At the head of the Student Union this year are Student Body President Libby Bishop and Vice President Trip Foley. Elected every February by the majority vote of the undergraduate student body, the pair elected to these positions take office April 1. 
The Office of the President staff includes Bishop and Foley's appointees to the chief of staff position and other posts in divisions such as academics, policy and technology. 
After leading a campaign in the spring against changes to the alcohol policy, the office's key concern this fall will be helping students understand the new rules, Bishop said. 
"These are such big changes, we want to make sure everyone knows the rules and is clear on them," she said. 
Student Senate 
The Senate includes one elected student from each of the 27 undergraduate residence halls as well as one senator who represents off-campus students. Senators are elected every spring semester and begin their terms April 1. 
The Senate proposes and considers resolutions, which, if approved, are for­warded to administrators or the Campus Life Council. Members must serve on two of the Senate's seven standing committees that target such issues as resi­dence life and University affairs. 
Last spring, the Senate was part of the student movement against changes to the alcohol. policy. This fa.11, the group will continue the effort to give students a. voice in campus changes, said Foley, Senate chair. 
Beginning Aug. 28, the body meets each Wednesday at 6 p,.m. in the Notre Dame Room of LaFortune Student Center. Meetings are open to the public. 
Campus Life Council 
The CLC's membership reflects all sides of Notre Dame residence life and includes administrators, faculty, rectors and students. Council members are elected to the group from other bodies, such as the Faculty and Student senates and the Hall Presidents and Club Coordination councils. 
The CLC drafts its own resolutions and considers those forwarded to the coun­cil from other groups, generally the Student Senate. In the past, the CLC has been one of the few bodies with student membership to make policy recommendations directly to the Office of Student Affairs. 
Work that began last semester on alcohol and tailgating issues will likely carry over this year, said Bishop, who chairs the CLC. Starting Sept. 2, the council meets every other Monday at 4:30 p.m. in the Not.re Dame Room. Meetings are open to the public. 
Student Union Board 
Think concerts, movies and other fun stuff. SUB, the programming arm of the Student Union, brings this entertainment to campus. 
In past years, SUB has brought actor James Earl Jones and singer Ani Difranco to the University's Stepan Center. Last winter, "Sex and the City" author Candace Bushnell spoke as part of SUB's annual Sophomore Literary Festival. 
Other annual events include the Collegiate Jazz Festival and Antostal. the weekend spring carnival. 
More student government 
If those groups don't bring out the student leader in you, there are other options. 
Getting involved in class council is one way to get a foot in the student govern­ment door. Each fall, 27 first-year students are elected to class council through their residence halls. The freshman representatives then elect from among them­selves the council's four executive officers. 
Every spring semester, rising sophomores, juniors and seniors are elected on a four-person class council ticket. The officers then appoint other students from their class to committee positions on the council. 
Two other important branches of the Student Union are Judicial Council and the Financial Management Board. "J-Council" oversees elections and runs the peer advocate program for students facing University discipline. FMB allocates money to student clubs and supervises the Student Business Board and the annu­al football "Shirt Project." 
And finally, the most basic unit of campus leadership is hall government. There are many dorm commissioner positions and hall president posts available to stu­dents. Hall presidents also are part of the campus-wide Hall Presidents Council. 
Bottom line: If you're unwilling to leave student government memories behind with your high school yearbook, or if you just want be able to distinguish CLC from SUB or FMB from HPC, the opportunities are there. 
Start by attending a meeting or looking for announcements around your dorm. Happy hunting. 



Student Body President Kim Jensen (middle) and Vice President Elizabeth Jablonski-Diehl pass out fliers In Regina Hall before the student body elec­tions in January 2002. 
story by LAURA CORISTIN 
During the next four years, first year students at Saint Mary's will become very familiar with the acronym "BOG." 
BOG, short for Board of Governance, is the primary student board on Saint Mary's campus. All other boards and clubs, including other major boards, class governments, hall councils, and academic clubs, branch off of BOG. 
In order to change, enhance or add a board. it must first be passed by BOG. BOG also serves as the communication link between students, admin­istration and the faculty. 
"BOG this year is working to strengthen all of its ties," said Kim Jensen, student body president. "We are also working on building ties with Notre Dame's student body President [Libby Bishop] and Vice President [Trip Foley]." 
Jensen. along with vice president Elizabeth Jablonski-Diehl, sat on the committee that has put the detex system into the washers and dryers throughout Saint Mary's campus, which Jensen says was one of their goals from the beginning. Through the detex system, Saint Mary's ID cards work like a debit card for laundry services. 
The pair has also been working on a new method to prepare the study proposal that includes a campus-wide survey with responses from over 700 students. Finally, Jensen and Jablonski-Diehl are working to bring designat­ed driver cards and other alcohol safety policies to Saint Mary's campus. 
Other major student boards at Saint Mary's include: 
Student Activities Board 
This board, led by President Adrienne Dorbish, aims to enhance campus culture with entertainment and social events for students. SAB serves stu­dents by planning student activities for SMC Pride Week, Midnight Madness, SMC Tosta) and Twilight Tailgate. Weekends are spiced up with smaller events including entertainers at Dalloway's coffeehouse and the occasional free off-campus movie. 
Student Diversity Board 
This board sponsors campus events to increase diversity awareness among students. In addition, President Sara Mahoney and other members of SOB work toward policy changes. 
Residence Hall Association 
Under President Jillian Kamaski, the RHA oversees hall councils and plans activities such as the All School Formal and Little Sibs Weekend. 
Student Academic Council 
This board deals with student concerns related to academics and faculty. SAC plans the Major of the Week and also works on policies. Student body Vice President Elizabeth Jablonski-Diehl is the president of SAC.

Key Events: Last Year on Campus 
It's tough enough finding the wayfrom the dorm to the class to the dining hall and back. First-year students don't want to get lost in the conversation loop, too. Here's a brieflook at last year's news at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's that might still come up in conversation on both campuses.

Sept. 11, 2001 
The images of terrorist planes crashing into the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon have become icons in American history, but during that time of sadness and mourning, thousands gathered on South Quad for a Mass to pray and reflect on the events of Sept. 11. A similar Mass was also held in Saint Mary's Regina chapel with about 400 people attending. Many students also embraced a patriotic spirit and displayed flags in their dorm windows. A collection at the Notre Dame-Michigan State game 

Elam
raised almost $300,000 for the families of New York firefighters and police. 

Chaotic coaching search 
After years of inconsistent performance from for­mer football head coach Bob Davie. the University decided that the football team needed a new leader. Athletic Director Kevin White fired Davie and put his confidence in former Georgia Tech head coach George O'Leary. But embellishments on the newly hired coach's resume led to a quick res ignation and a widely reported embarassment for the Notre Dame football team. Over the course of a month, White reconsidered an earlier candidate, former Stanford head coach Tyrone Willingham, as someone to fill the void O'Leary left behind. On Jan. 1, the new year rang in a new leader for the Irish as Willingham was formally introduced to the pub­lic as the team's head coach. 



Sexual assaults 
Sexual assault cases emerged early in the 2001 ·2002 school year with reports of an alleged rape in Keough Hall and sexual misconduct in an off-campus student apartment. 
Yet when a Notre Dame female claimed she was raped by four Notre Dame foot­ball players in an off-campus house, the issue attracted attention both on and off campus. 
As the case remained in the St. Joseph County prosecutor's hands, the University arranged its own disciplinary procedure. 
It resulted in the expulsions of former 
Crawford students senior Donald Dykes, sopho­mores Lorenzo Crawford and Abram Elam and Justin Smith, who was taking gradu­ate-level classes while finishing a fifth year of athletic eligibility. 

On May 24, prosecutor Chris Toth charged all except for Elam with rape. All four were charged with conspiracy to commit rape among other charges. 
Dykes, who would have graduated last year, had a prior incident with the police last July when he was arrested for crimi­nal trespassing. 
The first trial begins in October.

Senior Jesse Hensley holds a flaming copy of Notre Dame's student handbook, duLac, as senior Ryan Schildkraut looks on during the alcohol town hall meeting. Students gathered to protest the announcement of a new alcohol policy that takes effect this fall.

Most people who think of Notre Dame think of fall. 
Football games with pep rallies and tailgate parties bring more than 80,000 fans to campus every Saturday morning for bag pipes, burgers, beer and the band. But among the chaos of face paint, footballs, little girls in Notre Dame cheerlead­ing uniforms and old men in plaid pants there is a certain rever­ence shared by alumni, students and fans alike ­a respect for Notre Dame's history as well as its present. 
For every heated debate about Bobby Brown's "excessive celebra­tion" in '99 carried on in the parking lot next to Senior Bar, another con­versation about how difficult it must be to be admitted to Notre Dame can be heard on the steps of the Dome. 
But this is fall -a time for students to stand and scream and embrace the most well-known of Notre Dame's tra­ditions. while alumni knock at their old dorm room doors to remind new residents that Walsh wasn't always a girls dorm, or retrace their favorite path to the Grotto as the nation watches on NBC. Fall is for fans. 
Most students at Notre Dame dread winter. 
The first snowfall always seems innocent, but lake-effect snow brings permanent cold, endless papers, impossible exams and a general inability to recognize your closest friends beside you on South Quad due to excessive layers of clothing and a constant need to eye the ice beneath your feet. 
Melted snow floods the halls of DeBartolo and students who come to Notre Dame from anywhere between Tampa and Los Angeles question their own sanity every time they pass a dorm door whiteboard with a spring break countdown on it. Campus can feel tired and bleak, and in the same way the fall's traditions reveal a nationwide enthusiasm for Our Lady. 

Kate Nagengast 
Managing 
Editor 
winter's activities demonstrate frus­trations and cabin fever. 
But traditions prevail nonetheless. From Bengal Bouts, an annual cam­pus boxing tournament to benefit mis­sions of Bangladesh. to snowball fights on the quad and the Keenan Revue's comedic quips at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's stereotypes, jabs of the physical and the verbal variety give students a cathartic escape from finals and freezing weather. 
But winter is also a chance to settle into Notre Dame. With little motiva­tion to leave the dorms, winter allows time to relax and really get to know the people you meet in the stands at football games or in Calculus 105. Winter is for friends. 
There is nowhere like Notre Dame in the spring. 
When I decided to study abroad during my junior year most people thought I was crazy to go to London during the fall semester and miss a football season. As it turns out, 2001 was the season to miss. But that cir­cumstance aside, I would have much preferred to miss a football season than a spring semester on campus. 
Of course the excitement of football season cannot be replicated, but it can be experienced throughout life. Many Notre Dame alumni are football ticket holders, and a few have even attempted to reclaim the traditions of their undergraduate days, such as standing through games and doing push-ups after points, by requesting tickets in this season's inaugural Alumni Alley section of the stadium. 
Current students and alumni alike feel the same swell of emotion as the band steps off from the Dome steps or the basketball team beats a Big 10 rival -which is why fall is for fans of all ages, but spring is for students. 
Only those who are in the midst of the four short years during which they call Notre Dame home can truly appreciate the traditions of spring. The first sunny day when thermome­ters break 65 degrees bring dozens of couches, stereos and Frisbees to the quads. 
Attendance in Friday afternoon classes can get sparse surrounding spring break, but students are not entirely absent. In fact, spring is the time students' presence -not specta­tors' -is most sincerely felt on cam­pus. 
By mid-March they swarm campus for events like Bookstore Basketball, the largest five-on-five basketball tournament in the country. Christmas in April. a day of service in the South Bend community, and dorm events like the Fisher Regatta, Alumni Wake or O'Neill's Mardi Gras. 
These are the events that alumni remember. but never recreate. They are solely for students, and the stu­dents make them their own with big­ger and more eccentric additions each year. 
Dillon had couches on the quad freshmen year, someone planted a palm tree in front of O'Shaughnessy sophomore year, and junior year brought kiddy pools and slip n' slides to the grass in front of Alumni Hall. Spring is the time for students to cre­ate their own traditions and "act their age" with the greatest abandon. 
This was my first summer at Notre Dame. But it was also my last, just as I am about to experience my last fall, winter and spring here. Though I wouldn't trade the time I've had at Notre Dame, I'm slightly jealous of the seasons freshmen have left to see. 
Although August may seem full of anxiety over meeting roommates and finding classrooms or even something edible in the dining halls, before you realize it, football season will become February and winter's frustrations will become springtime festivities. 
Weather is one of the most talked about and unpredictable aspects of life in northern Indiana, and it's impossible to predict what each sea­son will bring to Notre Dame through­out the next four years. Even campus traditions and rules will likely change, but for the most part, Notre Dame is for its students -so make sure your time here is full of memo­ries to reminisce about when you return to Notre Dame in the fall of 2006 as a fan.

LETTERS FROM ADMINISTRATORS 
Student Affairs extends blessing 
I would like to extend to you a warm welcome on behalf of all of us who work in the Division of Student Affairs -the Offices of Alcohol and Drug Education, Campus Ministry, the Career Center, Counseling Center, Health Services, International Student Services and Activities, Multicultural Student Programs and Services, the Office of Residence Life and Housing, Security. Student Activities and the staffs of your residence halls. Although we provide a variety of services, we share a common desire to do everything we can to help facilitate your intellectual, spiritual and personal growth. 
We extend a special welcome to our new students -first-year students, transfer students and new graduate and professional students. We welcome back the sophomores, juniors and seniors, as well as the returning graduate and professional students. As a community, we draw our strength from the unique and diverse gifts offered by each of you. We hope that all of you -both those who are new and those who are returning -will be able to achieve the goals you set for yourselves this year. 
I hope that I will have the opportunity to come to know as many of you as possible in the months ahead. Until I am able to greet you in person, please know that you have my very best wishes for a year filled with all God's blessings. 
Father Mark Poorman 
Vice President for Student Affairs Notre Dame August 20, 2002 

Presidents welcome freshmen to community 
Welcome to Notre Dame. We have a beautiful campus and a talented faculty. I am sure that you will grow in every way as a thoughtful and reflec­tive person preparing to make your way in the 
world. We arc also proud of our residence tradition on campus and the many activi­ties available for you to use your God-given talents in leadership and service. 
It is my hope that during your time with us you will make some of the best friends 

of your life. We welcome 
students from every state in Malloy the union and from a wide array of foreign countries and cultures. We arc enriched by the different experiences and perspectives that you bring to our common life. 
I will have the privilege of teaching some of you in my seminar class. Others I will come to know through my residing in Sorin Hall. I hope to have a chance to interact with all of you in some way or another during your time at Notre Dame. 
Once again welcome to Notre Dame. I am confi­dent that this will be a great year for all of us. May God bless our life together. 
Father Edward Malloy 
President Notre Dame August 20, 2002 
Welcome to Saint Mary's for the 2002-2003 academic year. I hope that the summer for every student included a combination of rest and 
rejuvenation, a time to think about your acade­mic life and your future -and I'm sure for all of you earning money was a high priori­ty. 

Now that we 
are back into the Eldred new year, I hope that it will be very challenging and rewarding for you. In particular, I welcome our new first-year and transfer students and assure you that your experience at Saint Mary's will be an important time in your life. 
I look forward to meeting with stu­dents and faculty throughout the year and continuing our good rela­tionships with Notre Dame and Holy Cross College. 
Marilou Eldred 
President Saine Mary's August 20, 2002 
Learning what brochures don't tell you 
This summer, you probably received dozens of mailings from the place you're going to call home for the next four, five, maybe six years. If you took the time to read any of it, you'd learn the dining hall actually employs taste testers, your first year advisor really did spend lots of time making your excuse for a sched­ule and your fresh­man orientation staff thinks your dorm is the coolest on campus. 
All those brochures, pam­phlets, letters and other items you used to line your pet's cage this summer served one purpose ­adjusting you to college life. But nowhere will you read the stuff you really have to know. 
For example, this weekend, your fel­low classmates don't care about what music you like, what your hobbies are, or your views on how to achieve world peace. They want to know four things: name, hometown, dorm and major, and that's it. 
Did they tell you you're going to spend three days cramming for your first test, and you won't study half as long for any other test during the rest of your college career? You may think you will, but it's so much more fun to complain about how bad you're going to fail rather than actually study, Besides, in most cases, it's inevitable -no matter how much you study, the test will still kick your butt. 

Nowhere in Notre Dame's packet of goodies did they tell you the two most popular sentences around campus. The first is, "There's nothing to do on cam­pus." And after you've gone to the mall, the movie theater and Grape Road, you realize, "There's nothing to do off campus." Welcome to South Bend, Ind., the armpit of America. 
I didn't know about God's gift to procrastinators -Instant Messenger ­until I got to campus. With this wonderful program, you can communi­cate with your room­mate without opening your mouth, leave witty away messages so everyone knows what you're doing at any given moment and appall your gram­mar instructors with gibberish like "ok, gtg, be back l8r." 
Yes, you may be thrilled to have your parents oui of your hair now and pumped to expe­rience this wonderful thing called inde­pendence, but by late fall you can't wait for them to come back to campus so you get a free meal at a real restau 
rant. And the best thing about being 
away from home is when fall break 
rolls around, the folks will be so eager 
to see you they don't mind washing the 
three duffel bags of laundry you dragged home with you. It's called freeloading. Learn to do it. Did you know that among the Y-chromo­somes, the second most popular pas­time on campus is complaining about the gen­der relations 
and whining that you can't get a 
date. The first is play­ing video 
games. 
If you're a guy in a female dorm when 
parietals rolls around, expect a highly dan­gerous and lethal team of commandos known only as "female RAs" to descend upon your location and fire dirty stares in your direction until 
you leave their innocent dorm 
mate alone. If you 're a girl in a male 
dorm, make sure you say goodnight to 
the RA when he closes the door at two 
in the morning. 
There are thousands of other things nobody told you about, either. You'll discover that girls have a recessive gene that, when triggered by Bon Jovi or other '80s music, causes them to scream ecstatically. jump up and down hysterically and dance together obnox­iously. 
You'll find out that the best thing about a high-speed Internet connection isn't easy access to hundreds of research sites, it's the ability to down­load MP3s before you can say "copy­right infringement." 
Yes, your dorm is the coolest on cam­pus, unless the word "Zahm" is etched in stone on your building. And the two greatest words in the English language are "free food." 
The greatest irony of college is that the one thing everyone told you is the one thing you brushed aside. When your four years are up, you're going to wish you could do it all over again. You're not here to get good grades; you're here to get an education. There's a difference, 
So get involved in an organization. Make friends that don't care if you turn your socks inside out to save a load of wash. Take classes in whatever seems fun. Lose your voice screaming at football games. 
But always remember the most important thing of all: It's pop, not soda.

LETTERS FROM STUDENT GOVERNMENT 
Exploring fresh opportun1t1es 
It is with warmest wishes that we, Libby and Trip, welcome you to Notre Dame. We took office as Student Body President and Vice President this past April, and we are excited about being your representatives this year. 
Even as two seniors we still vividly remember what a big transition ihis first weekend is. We remember the excitement, underlying anticipation, and the pressure of meeting hundreds of your classmates at orientation mixers and not remembering anyone's name. But the good news is that you're not alone ­no one remembers anyone's name from those mixers and every freshman is probably just as nervous as you arc this first week. 
Once you do get settled in. with your new roommate, friends, and class schedule (and once you finally think you know your way around the dining hall). then we hope that you will take time to sit down and think about what activities, clubs and organizations you want to be a part of during your next four years at Notre Dame. 
The Activities Fair that will be held in the JACC is a great place to start researching all the opportunities to get involved in everything from community service to the swing dance club. 
And our one piece of advice to you is this: Don't be afraid to try something new this year. This is your year to start over if you want, exploring things that you always wanted to do but never did for whatever reason. And here at Notre Dame there are numerous opportunities to do the extraordinary. 
The Student Government office is located in 203 LaFortune, and we invite you to stop by sometime to introduce yourself. We would be more than happy to talk with you about student government or other opportunities to get involved on campus.

Use individuality to contribute 
Welcome to Saint Mary's College. 
It is our joy and privilege to be two of the many to extend a warm welcome on behalf of Saint Mary's College. Here you will find a close-knit communi­ty, rich in history, tradition, and opportunity. The campus is small, but far-reaching, and the year ahead will be every­thing you make of it. Each stu­dent will find something to suit her interests, be it in acade­mics, sports or extra-curricu­lar activities. 
We are blessed with a very accomplished faculty, always willing to talk to and help stu­dents. We as students have access to some of the most amazing people around, and they are willing to share their knowledge and experience both in and out of the class­room. Reach out and hold tightly to the opportunities and friendships that lie ahead of you. 
Each person on this campus has something unique to con­tribute to our community. Your individuality is such an asset to the College, so take care to maintain it. While you are getting continually more occupied with classes and activities, do not forget to take a little time for yourself each day to reflect on who you are and who you are becoming. Get involved on campus, but rather than assimilating your­self into a group, focus on what your unique personality and abilities will add to it. 
If you ever have any ques­tions, please stop by our office on the third floor of Haggar College Center or give us a call. If we do not have the answer, we'll make one up. Just kidding, but we will do our very best to help you in whatever way we can. We love hearing from you. Bring your thoughts, cares and problems to us. If you'd like to be a part of Student Government Association, keep your eyes open for applications or for information on SGA. 
On behalf of the student body, we would like to wish all of you the best of luck for the year ahead. Welcome to the academic year of 2002-2003. Let's make the most of it.

I'm sure you've heard all the hype before: "Notre Dame is great; it's different from anywhere else on the planet;" "You're entering the best years of your life," etc. True to any such cliche, each contains its own kernel of truth. But I urge you not to buy into them as a whole. 
I'm entering my fourth year as a Domer, and I can tell you for absolutely certain, there really isn't any other place quite like Notre Dame. Love it or hate it, it's different. You'll find in the coming months as you try to explain 
John Litle
Notre Dame's dorm setup to your state school friends, they just don't 
quite understand it, and no matter what you say, you just can't get the whole idea across to them. Some of you might have experienced 
my first night's horror as my mother was removed from my dorm by Observer 
RAs at midnight. I'm sure I was a little bit different from you, howev­Columnist 
er, as it was at that very moment that I first learned of parietals. 
Some people claim that Notre Dame never changes. That's true and false at the same time as well. You'll be joining Notre Dame with no graffiti dance, no football ticket campout and, most shockingly, no hard liquor. You will, however, have a con­cert by a famous funk legend. I never got that. Those are changes for sure, but at the same time, for all the alumni -many of your parents as well -Notre Dame seems just the same as the day they left (or so I hear). I'm sure that among other things not to change, during your time at Notre Dame, both Alumni Hall will remain the greatest dorm on campus and Father Poorman will retain his likable personality. I guess what I'm saying is that, while cir­cumstances at the University may change, the Notre Dame we all love will always be the Notre Dame we all love. 
Lots of people will give you lots of advice these first weeks of school, so I'm not sure if what I'm saying will have much meaning. However, there are a couple of things I wish someone had said to me when I was a freshman that might have helped me in my first year. 
The first thing is, welcome to college. You just got a chance to start out again from zero. No one here knows you, and everyone had great accomplishments in high school. The good thing is that now that you're here, you don't have to worry about all those things from high school, because no one cares. I wish I had gotten that through my head, as I might not have spent my first few weeks being intimidated by all these popular-looking, high-achieving peo­ple around me without realizing I was just the same as all of them: in a new place. alone, and wanting to meet some new people like me. Alternatively, and perhaps more upsetting in the long run, I might not have spent those first few weeks remembering how great I did in high school and how popular I was, only later to be brought down to earth realizing again, that I was just the same as everyone else, in a new place, alone, and wanting to meet people like me. 
The next piece of advice I might have wanted was the advice to go out and meet friends and not to be afraid to be yourself. Some might criticize my advice, but so be it. Notre Dame is a college, but whatever you hear from your state school friends, not all colleges are just huge meat markets. (You know what I'm saying). Notre Dame is such a college. If you're a guy, I've seen it done both ways, and I tell you, you're much better to start off here by going out and meeting ladies on a friendly basis. This is as opposed to hoping to find meaningless sexual encounters. Of course, this advice holds true for the ladies as well. Notre Dame isn't like most schools. and you're going to be meeting some of the best friends of your life here. Making guy friends is very important. In the words of one of my best friends (who also hap­pens to be female), "Don't get all focused on academics and only hang out with girls." I couldn't agree more. 
My last point, of course, is that whole statement "the best years of your life." I've never liked that statement, because if it's true, the rest of your life will just be a constant look back on the past. But what I can say is this: It should be your goal to make every year of your life the best year of your life. Notre Dame will give you the tools to complete that task. It's up to you to make it happen.

-youmade the grades. You survived the stress-relat­
ed, heart attack-inducing application process. You 
got accepted. You stuffed all your worldly posses­sions into the family station wagon or a few suitcases. You finally made it. And now you might want to know how to escape. 
Notre Dame and Saint Mary's offer their residents a complete life. Any necessity you require is almost certainly available on campus. There are numerous restaurants, stores, salons, banks, laundry mats and doctor's offices that offer a student access to all of his or her needs. Hypothetically, a student could never set foot off campus until the end of the semester. In fact, as the workload increases, many freshmen will find that they spend more time on campus than they realize or would like. 
Despite the material conveniences on campus, inevitably students will want to break away from the campuses' iso­lated bubble. Luckily, The Observer's Scene staff has com­piled a brief guide to living large in and around the Bend. 
Shopping 
South Bend has the average Mid-West array of shop­ping. Students particularly frequent the University Park Mall and its surrounding shopping centers. Busses to the mall leave from campus from the street side entrance to the Hesburgh Library. Take bus No. 7 to the University Park mall; tickets cost $.75. The United Limo shuttle that runs between Saint Mary's and Notre Dame also stops at Hesburgh Library. The shuttle is free on weekdays, but there is a small fee after 6:00 p.m. on weekends. Bus schedules are available at the information desk in Lafortune Student Center at Notre Dame and in the Security Office or Haggar Hall at Saint Mary's. 
For the uninitiated, the most popular student pit stop is Meijer. Originally a small chain of general stores sprinkled across the Midwest, Meijer has been reborn as the apogee of capitalism. The new mega-stores sell everything: gro­ceries, clothes, furniture, hardware, gardening supplies, CDs, electronics and more. There are three Meijers in South Bend area; of the two closest to campus, one is located at 3600 Portage Road off Lincolnway and the other is at 5020 Grape Road about a half mile south of the mall. 
Late Night Munchies 
As the dining halls close at 9:00 p.m., most students are just opening their books. An all-nighter might require a lit­tle brain food and, if you aren't in the mood for a Reeker's pizza, South Bend offers a number of tasty and sometimes colorful late-night dining experiences. 
Boracho Burrito: The legendary Boracho Burrito is a culinary Mecca for weekend after-parietals partiers. Co­owned and operated by two Notre Dame graduates, Boracho Burrito regularly has students standing in lines out the door on Thursday through Saturday nights for fists full of Mexican goodness. A burrito with chicken, steak, or ground beef costs about $4.75. Boracho Burrito is located on at 1724 N Ironwood Drive, near Hollywood Video. 
Nick's Patio: Open 24-hours a day, Nick's Patio offers cheap American grill food. But there's not much more to say than the fact that it's always open and has American grill food. Nick's Patio is located at 1710 N. Ironwood Or. conveniently next to Boracho Burrito. 
The White House Restaurant: Most students will never hear this place called by its offkial name, but those names are secrets unto themselves and are best left. unspoken in the restaurant itself. The White House restaurant is per­haps the ultimate example of the American greasy spoon; eat your heart out Jack Kerouac. Serving all American diner food and a slice of South Bend culture to boot, The White House Restaurant stays open around the clock. It's located at the intersection of Mishawaka Avenue and Twyckenham Drive. 
Denny's is located at 52626 US Highway 33 just north of Saint Mary's and Steak and Shake is on the main drag of Grape Road between 180-90 and N. Edison. Both are open

24 hours a day. 
Pizza 
A traditional staple of the college diet, pizza delivery is available from 
To a number of establishments across the Bend. A few student favorites are: 
Papa John's Pizza: Call (574) 271­1177 for delivery or carry out. Ask about campus specials, generally a large one-topping pizza for $7 late night. Papa John's is open Monday through Saturday from 11 until 2 
a.m. (depending upon demand), and from 12 p.m. until midnight Sunday. 
Domino's Pizza: The closest to campus, Domino's delivers from 4 to 1 a.m. on Monday through Thursday and 4 until 3 a.m. on Friday and Saturday. Call (574) 271-0330. 
Marco's Pizza: A bit farther from campus, but often a needed break from the hegemony of Papa John's and Domino's. Call (574) 243-1122 for delivery or carry out. Marco's Pizza is open from 11 a.m. to mid­night, Sunday through Thursday, and from 11 a.m. to 1 a.m. on Friday and Saturday 
East of Chicago Pizza: A newer player in the delivery scene, most students either love it or hate it. Call 
(574) 271-1277 for delivery. East of Chicago is open Sunday through Thursday from 4 until 10 p.m. and Friday and Saturday from 4 until 11 p.m. 
Ethnic Food 
South Bend is a bit short on quality ethic meals, but a few establishments hide out here and there: 
The Golden Dragon Restaurant: The quickest and cheapest Chinese food near campus; located at 3302 Portage Avenue. The Golden Dragon delivers very quickly too, call (574) 243-8800 to place an order. 
The Malabar: Located on the cor­ner at 1640 S Bend Ave adjacent to campus, The Malabar serves deli­cious but moderately pricey Indian food. 
Star of India: Located at 620 W. Edison Road near Grape Road, Star 
B«n ting t~of India has decent and cheap Indian food. They have a wonderful lunch 
buffet from 1l until 2:30 p.m. for about $6 per person. A mango shake is a delicious meal toppn for the culinary adventure. 
Student Favorite Dining 
Grape Road has a strip of American chain restaurants frequented by many students including T.G.I. Friday's, The Olive Carden, The Outback Steakhouse, Chili's, Lone Star Steakhouse and Don Pablo's. All are located on the main drag of Grape Road. 
CJ's Pub: Greasy burgers in this favorite South Bend haunt cost about six bucks. The pub has a live musician perform on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays, as well as a DJ that spins on Fridays and Saturdays. CJ's is locat­ed at 417 N. Michigan St., just south of Memorial Hospital in downtovvn South Dend. 
Rocco's: Serving Notre OamP students and alumni since 1951, Rocco's pizza is a popular hang out. With school memorabilia decorating every wall, it doesn't get much better than a great pizza with friends. Rocco's is located on the corner of St. Louis Street and South Bend Ave. 
Bruno's: Located about 15 minutes southwest of campus at 2610 Prairie Avenue, Bruno's serves the "largest" small a pizza lover will ever see. 
Movies 
South 81:md has three major multiplex theaters showing A­run movies. The Cinemark Movies 14 is closest to campus, located at 910 West Edison. The theater is often a week or two slow to release some features, but is conveniently located and

The closest places to rent movies are Blockbuster Video and Hollywood Video, which are both located on the corner of Ironwood Drive State Road 23 near Boracho Burrito and Nick's Patio. Both rent VHS and DVD as well as video games. Blockbuster has a better selection but higher prices and shorter rental periods than Hollywood Video. Hollywood Video offers a rent two VHS or DVDs and get a third free. Be careful because if you return movies late you are charged late fees for all three. 
Getting Far Away 
If you need to get out of Indiana Chicago is about two hours by train, the South Shore Train, which leaves from the South Bend airport. A round trip ticket to downtown Chicago costs a little under $20. Unfortunately, the late trains out of Chicago don't all stop in South Bend so check the timetables for information. Also, keep in mind that during the winter months there is a time difference between South Bend and Chicago. Heading west you'll lose an hour, so be sure to note the change. Chicago is about 90 min­utes by car, heading west on 180-90. Parking in Chicago, run by organized crime, is the biggest rip off ever. If you can't find a metered space you might be paying up to $48 a day to park in a garage. 
The fabled trip to Windsor, Canada takes about four hours by car. Windsor has a number of casinos, bars, clubs and other nightlife to offer in a country where the drink­ing age is 19. Remember to bring ID or you may be turned away at the board­er by the grumpy Canadian boarder patrol. If you look like a seedy American student expect you and your car to be searched. 
time of year. While South 
Bend isn't Hell's Kitchen, 
drunken students on foot get mugged occasionally on their way back to campus. The safest way home is a cab. Most offer about $2 per person for groups of three or more to and from campus. Sharing cabs ½ith strangers has been known to cause problems. Don't get in a cab if you feel unsafe; request an empty cab instead. If you are in an uncomfortable situation in a cab, ask for service directly to your dorm. There are a number of cab companies operating in South Bend: 
Ace Cab Lines: 295-6886 
University Cabs: 233-4004 
A-B-C Cabs: 233-4000 
Shamrock Cabs: 243-5500 
If a Saint Mary's student is broke after a late night out, the campus offers an honor system with local cab compa­nies where students can ride for free and pay the next day. Saint Mary's students can call campus security, (574) 284-5000, and explain the situation to the dispatch that· will call a cab for the student or, in case of immediate safety concerns, send a security vehicle off campus or con­tact South Bend or County police. Students are expected to reimburse the Security Office within 48 hours. 
Contra Bans 
Campus stores offer most amenities students want with a few notable exceptions: 
Cigarettes: Both campuses are non-smoking and no stores sell cigarettes. For smokers, the cheapest place to buy cigarettes is Low Bob's Campus Tobacco located on State Road 23 behind the Turtle Creek apartments. All night gas stations sell packs and cartons at higher prices but are open all hours. During the day some cabbies with drive to a gas station and buy cigarettes and deliver them to campus for a surcharge. 
Women's services: The medical facilities at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's can treat most minor colds and infec­tions, set broken bones and fill most prescriptions. However, neither facility will prescribe or fill prescriptions for birth control pill regardless of whether they are pre­scribed for contraceptive or other medical purposes. Meijer, Wal-Mart, and Osco Drug mart all can fill any pre­scription. The Planned Parenthood at UrbanCare at 818 S. Miami offers a full array of medical services for women. 
A word to the wise 
College can offer brand new experiences to students. It's easy to forget that bad things can happen both on and off campus when you are surrounded by such a unique, friendly and open campus community. Freshmen year is a major transition for many students and many may find the bubble bursts when they don't want it to. Binge drinking, drug abuse and rape are present on both campuses. Neither campus nor South Bend are particularly danger­ous, but it's important to be responsible and safe inside and outside the bubble.

their top six scorers from last season. Forwards Erich Braun and Dev1m Prescod -the team's two leading scorers in 2001 ­have already bt~gun to assert their offensive potency, scoring eight of Notre Dame's 19 goals in Scotland. 
Freshman striker Tony Megna, who has shown the promise of being an "arly contributor to the Irish offense. has been sidelined since the start of summer prac­tice with a back injury that kept him out of his entire senior sea­son in high school. 
J\t midfield, the Irish l'inallv have the advantage of depth and consistency, returning all players at that position and 11ot having to endun~ u coaching change for the first time in three years. Tri­captains Justin Hatcliffe and Grng Martin, and juniors Justin 1)1\lter, Chad Biley and Filipo Chillemi. havr~ had a rull yPar to learn Clark's offensive and cldnnsiv1! sclwmos and play togethnr as a unit. 
This d1'pth will allow incoming l'r<~shmen Nick Tarnay, .Ion Mark Thompson and the injured John Stnphnns tirno to settle into both Clark's system and the pressurns of' colloge lire. 
"!The frpshmcnl am all work­ing away, and I think it's far too early to say right now how much they'll lrn abh! to do right away," Clark said. "They're all young and arP still cxcitNI to be out them. We 'II let them settle in, and tlmy'II basically tell us when tlwy're ready. They'll tell us by tlw way they comn out to prac­tice every day. I've never been in a hurry to rush frnshmen in because I think it's good to let tlrnm sntlle into school life first." 
With tlrn returning starters and the confidence of a success­ful first year together under their 
belts. the Irish hope to take another step this season toward achieving national prominence as a soccer program. 
"We want to win every game as they come up, and we can't look beyond our next game," Clark said. "I think we all know what we want to do. I never try to jinx myself by saying [that a certain accomplishment should be our goal]. But I think every­one realizes that we want to play well in every game, because if we play well in every game, I -,. believe we have a fair chance of winning every one."

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
Fewer freshmen fit in just fine 
By KATIE McVOY Associate Spons Ediror 
This summer, there were more old faces than new. Following a season with six new freshmen to break in. the Irish were glad to welcome just two ni>w recruits Lhis summer as Megan Duffy and Courtney La Vere joined last year's returning veterans. 
The two incoming freshmen got their first taste of college life this summer, taking classes, training in the weight room and practicing with teammates. Unlike last year, the veterans outnumbered the rookies. However, being new to campus was a memoi~y that was still frosh in the minds of most of the players. 
"It was so much easier mainly because our sophomores did such a fantastic job with them and I think that was really a great thing," said head coach MuffPt Mc<;raw "They really fit in woll. ThP chemistry was Lremnndous." 
Duffy nnd Lavere spent the summPr rooming with post play­er Teresa Borton and guard Allison Bustamante. Borton and Bustamante, along with the otlwr four returning sophomores who still rPmember being the newhi,\s, w1're more than willing to share those important bits of knowli·dg,i with the new recruits -lik,, what timP curfew is dur­ing a,.,,ay games,

While the door is open for Stovall and McKnight, the complex pass routes of Willingham ·s pro-style offense often leave the two stumbling around trying to find their way, 
"When you look at the two young freshmen. from experi­ence-wise, they're truly green, but they're so talented," offen­sive coordinator Bill Diedrick said. "It's kind of a love-hate relationship. They'll go out and make a couple of bone­head plays and then they'll make a couple of really great plays." 
Now that the team has start­ed game preparations for the Aug. 31 season-opener against Maryland, the oppor­tunities for freshmen have slowly diminished as coaches prepare to implement specific straL1!gies. Just when many freshmen were starting to grasp the system, they now find themselves watching from the sideline and therefore los­ing the chance to learn even 
more. 
"What we have as coaches is an understanding about lhat. so therefore, we've got some patience." Willingham said. ''We'll keep working with them tu ke11p them progress­ing so they can make a contri­bution to this team." 
Contact Andrew Soukup at asoukup@nd.edu. 
about until later," Dnfly said. 
In addition to getting to know their teammates, Duffy and LaVerc got an added bonus -a leg up on the rest of the fresh­man rlass hitting rampus this week. They both have two col­lege classes under their belts. have worked on balancing prac­tice with academics and, most importantly, they know where the dining hall is. 
"Yeah, I'm going to be a pro at freshman orientation," Duffy said. 
Duffy and LaVere both seemed to take to college life without much trouble. 
"I was so pleased," McGraw said. "They didn't seem to go through that normal period of freshman homesickness. There weren't a lot of bumps in: the road. So that seemed almost too easy." 
But there is still much to do. 
Duffy, a 5-foot-7 point guard from Dayton, Ohio. will have her work cut out for her, both physi­cally and mentallv. She suffered a season-ending knee injury midway through her senior sea­son at Chaminade-Julienne High School but was back on the court in time for summer workouts. She will continue to rehabilitate the knee through the preseason. 
"I My knee I is getting there," Duffy said. "It's starting to feel pretty decent. I'm excited to get back and start playing full go." 
In addition to making sure her knee is in working order, as a point guard, Duffy will have to not only learn her position on the floor, but also get to know her way around the whole offen­sive scheme, to know what everyone is supposed to be doing at any given moment. 
"It's definitely going to be exc.iting," Duffy said. "U's com­pletely new. That's why I came here -for the opportunity to play under Coach McGraw and play with LeTania [Severe]. I'm excited to learn completely new information." 
Duffy should be able to step up to the challenge. She ended her high school career ½'ith an aver­age of 15.1 points, 4 rebounds, 3,8 assists and 3 steals a game. In addition to the statistics, Duffy also has a good head for the game. 
"She's someone I'm confident has a great mental game, some­body that I feel I can really relate to and I just feel like we're going to have a really good chemistry," McGraw said. "l really like her attitude." 
LaVcre will add to the depth at the Irish post position. in an offense that often plays three women at post. The 6-foot-3 for­ward from Ventura, Calf. should feel right at home. 
"Not that it's going to be easy for Courtney, but the offense 
Welcome to Notre Dame. 
we're going to run is perfect for her," McGraw said. "l think she's going to fit in really well. We only have the three post players and we can play three at a time. We really need to sure up our depth. She should got a lot of playing time as a freshman." 
Lavere, a third-team Parade All-American selection, wrapped up her high school career aver­aging 26.5 points, 11.4 rebounds and 3.5 blocks per game. 
She and Duffy should both find themselves right in the thick of things. 
'Tm excited about both of them and l see both of them jumping right in," McGraw said. 
The Irish will begin individual workouts next week and will begin practice officially on Oct. 12.

SMC VOLLEYBALL 
Belles look to start fresh 
By KATIE McVOY Associate Spores Ediror 
There is only one word to describe the Saint Mary's volley­ball team -young. With one senior returning and no player with more than one year of col­legiate play, experience will not be on the Belles' list of assets. 
"Everyone returning is only a second year player with this program," coach Julie Schroeder-Biek said. "So. in terms of experience, [we're} very young." 
Four new freshmen will be joining the team, which finished last season with a record of 4­23, 1-13 in the MIAA. Shelly Bender. Julianne Miller, Talia Matury-Vicaro and Heidi Superczynski will team up with the eight returning members of the team. including lone senior Elizabeth Albert. 
Tryouts for the team conclud­ed Thursday, leaving three of the seven women who came out for the team without a position. 
"All that tried out were very talented and hard-working," Schrooder-Biek said. "[It was] a very difficult cut this year ­nothing was clear cut. It just came down to how much depth was needed at the various posi­tions." 
The four players joining the team will have to step up to make up for some serious loss­es. During the course of the sea­son last year, the Belles lost team leader Angie Meyers to a season-ending ACL tear. With graduation, they also said good­bye to co-captain Jolie Lebeau, setter Jaime Dineen and defen­sive specialist Denise Langlois. Meyers and LeBeau were both four-year players. 
The Belles will be looking to recover from a last-place finish in I.he MIAA last season. They open play on Aug. 30 at the Alma Tournament.

SMC SOCCER 
Young team expects challenging season 
By KATIE McVOY 
Associate Sports Editor 
New faces are not unusual on the soccer field at Saint Mary's. 
Following a year that saw major improvement marred by the departure of key seniors, starters and the head coach, fresh players and coaches wiU be as commonplace as return­ing veterans. 
For the third time in for four years, the Belles soccer team will be adjusting to a new coaching style -this time under the leadership of Chris Pfau. Pfau. who came to Saint Mary's from Mount Marty College in South Dakota. will take over a team that saw improvement under coach Bobby Johnston, who left Saint Mary's for the University of Tampa last spring. 
With so many changes the past four years, Pfau recog­nizes that the focus this season can't be fancy footwork or long shots on goal. It must be noth­ing other than laying the first stones of a foundation neces­sary for success. 
"All I'm going to do is give them a structure, something solid, a foundation on which they can play," Pfau said. "It might take a month, it might take the whole season. That's my biggest goal." 
Pfau wiU be passing that goal along to a very young team. Saint Mary's graduated three key seniors and lost senior Heather Muth, who suffered several injuries last season and decided not to return after Johnston announced his resig­nation. 
This season, the Belles will be welcoming six new recruits to the playing field. 
Leading the incoming class is freshman Carrie Orr. The mid­fielder from Dayton. Ohio, stands a good chance of start­ing this season. Fans may also see freshman Shannon Culbertson blocking opposing players at a defensive position. 
Pfau identified Orr and Culbertson as "big impact play­ers" for the class of 2006. 
Lynn Taylor, the only senior and four-year member of the squad, will undertake a heavy leadership role. However, the Belles will alc;o be counting on sophomore Jen Concannon, who led the team in scoring last season. 
Following the tumultuous off-season, it's back to the drawing board with hopes of finding something stable enough to bring home some victories. 
"There's been a lot of turnover, so [I want] something they can always fall back upon and some stability," Pfau said.

CROSS COUNTRY ND VOLLEYBALL 
Same goal, different paths for 2 squads 
By JOE HETTLER 
Associate Sports Editor 
The Notre Dame mens and womens cross country teams will start their respective sea­sons trying to reach the same goal -a national champi­onship. Each will he eyeing that goal from very different standpoints, however. 
The mens team graduated five of its top seven runners from last season's fifth-ranked squad and hopes to use a strong incoming freshman class to turn more than a few 
-heads this season. 
"Are the [freshmen] going to be able to replace five All­Americans that graduated? No, of course not," national coach of the year Joe Piane said. "[But] I think we'll be better than people give us credit for." 
The Irish do return All­American Todd Mobley and top runners David Alber and John Keane as well as Eric Morrison and Brian Kerwin. Kernin was 
_ bothered by injuries last sea­son, but is healthy and looking towards a solid season. Notre Dame will also be aided by three exceptional freshmen, including highly­touted Tim Moore. Moore was the highest underclassman fin­isher at the Foot Locker ,, National meet and, according to Piane. should be one of the top five runners on the team. Newcomers Tom Longo and Kaleb VanOrt also are also expected to contribute signifi­cantly this season.

For the women, graduating All-Americans won't be a prob­lem because the team lost no one from last season when they finished ranked 19th. Coach Tim Connelly has high expecta­tions for his team. 
"We're in a pretty good posi­tion, we finished 19th at the NCAA Championships last year and we're bringing everyone back," Connelly said. 
The Irish return top runners such as All-American Lauren King as well as NCAA qualifier Jen Handley. Connelly also expects large contributions from Megan Johnson, Jennifer Fibuch, Christi Arnerich, Melissa Schmidt, Julia Schmidt and Rachel Endress. 
Freshmen Mollv Huddle. Stephanie Nadia, Laurie King and Jean Marinangeli will all be counted on to contribute as well. 
However, Connelly does not expect to start his full team at Notre Dame's first meet, the adidas Invitational hosted at Notre Dame on Sept. 6. 
"To be honest, we probably won't run our whole team [at the first meet] because I want [the freshman] to get settled into school." Connelly said. "I think we have enough depth to do that early in the season." 
Both the mens and womens cross country teams will open their season on Sept. 6 in the adidas Invitational at Notre Dame.

Recruits stand above rest 
ByMATTLOZAR 
Sports Writer 
After graduating the starting front row from last year's Big East Championship team, Notre Dame volleyball coach Debbie Brown recruited six tall players to comprise her nationally­ranked freshman class. And their impact in summer prac­tices has shown instantly. 
"They have lit in really well." Brown said. "Even though we lost considerable experience, we have more depth than we have had in a long time. The practices have been very competitive." 
Outside hitters Meg Henican and Lindsay Peterson. setter Kelly Burrell and middle block­ers Lauren Brewster, Carolyn Cooper and Lauren Kelbley were rated fifth-best by Volleyball Magazine. 
Each player is at least 5-foot­10 and Student Sports Magazine ranked the class as third in the country. 
Henican earned Louisiana Player of the Year honors in her junior and senior years. Brewster was named the state tournament MVP in 2000 and 2001. Student Sports Magazine named Burrell a preseason All­American as a junior and senior. 
Although the Irish have not played a game, the freshmen have noticed some differences between high school and college volleyball. 
"We have to look at things more mentally than physically," said Kelbley. 
"The time commitment is year-round," Brewster added. "With this team, the team unity is also better than any high school team I have been on." 
Offer valid every Monday 11 a.m. to dose. 
Brown knows the freshmen are about to experience an entirely new level of competition. 
"The ball is coming a lot faster, hitters are bigger," Brown said. "The front row is significantly bigger than the past. We play above the net. The power is a lot more than their high school and club teams. 
"Also. in terms of their high school season. the duration of the season and the intensity is different. That is very taxing mentally. Not being used to play­ing at that level for an extended period of time can be difficult." 
Besides making the transition on the court, the freshmen have to adapt to the change of living at college. Their upperclass teammates are attempting to make that transition as smooth as possible. 
"The upperclassmen are amazing. They have all been great," Brewster said. "They were helpful in knowing what is going on -finding our classes,

who we need to talk to. They made the transition easy." 
"They are great," Kelbley agreed. "They gave us a little booklet telling us what we need for preseason. They are really helping us on and off the court." 
Even before the freshmen arrived on campus, the upper­classmen were making their new teammates feel welcome. 
"There has been a great job by the returners making the fresh­men feel at home." Brown said. "Even before the first day, dur­ing the summer, the returners sent them stuff to let the fresh­men know what to bring." 
Overcoming the adjustment to college volleyball will allow the freshmen to contribute to the Irish's goal of winning a third consecutive Big East Championship and make its 11th straight NCAA Tournament appearance.

ing players to adjust tn the challenge of Division I college soccnr. "The tnam now understands the impor­tance of' leadership -not just from your 
seniors, but all the veterans," Waldrum said. "They know we went astray last sea­son, but that chapter is closed." 
All three starting forwards from last year's team are back, including Amy Warner, Melissa Tancredi and 2001 Big East Tournament MVP Amanda Guertin. Freshmen Holly Law and Maggie Manning could provide solid energy off the bench to assist the trio of returning juniors. 
The Irish also return midfielders Dryer and junior Randi Scheller. Waldrum was extremely impressed with Scheller's hard work and dedication over the off-season and believes she is poised for a break-out season. 
"[Scheller] made a big step last year, but we think she can make a bigger one this year, to the point of getting some national recognition and getting into the national team pool," Waldrum said. 
The Irish must replace the playmaking ability and creativity of departed captain Mia Sarkesian at the third midfield posi­tion. Juniors Kim Carpenter and Molly Tate and sophomore Mary Boland are all candidates to replace Sarkesian in the starting lineup, with highly touted fresh­man Katie Thorlakson also figuring into the mix. Fellow freshmen Michelle Daley

and Jenny Walz are also expected to com­pete for playing time at midfield. Versatile sophomore Sarah Halpenny -a transfer from UC-Irvine -may see time at either midfield or defense. 
With only two returning starters, the Irish defense and goalkeeping positions remain the biggest question marks. Sophomore Candace Chapman and All­American Pruzinsky will be back at their starting defensive positions, but the Irish must replace All-American Monica Gonzales and three-year starter Lindsey Jones. To make matters worse, the Notre Dame defense suffered a huge blow before the season even began when top recruit Annie Sheftcr tore her ACL in late July and is expected to miss the entire season. 
Sophomore Gunnar Gunnarsdottir fig­ures tu have the insidfl trar.k for one of the two opening starting positions. Freshman Kat Sigler from Windsor, Calif., emerged as a leading candidate for the fourth defensive. Sophomore Kate Tulisiak and freshmen Amber McMillan, Annie Wieber and Miranda Ford will also see action at midfield. 
The Irish goalkeeping position is still up for grabs. Junior Launm Kent and fresh­man Erika Bohn arc battling to replace the departed Liz Wagner at the starting goalkeeper position. Kont and Bohn·s pm·­formances in upcoming exhibitions against perennial powers North Carolina and Kentucky will go a long way in helping Waldrum determine the starter.

Brey admits he's concerned about how Peterkin, who com­mitted to the Irish in May, will adjust to the team. While Francis, Cornett and Quinn are completely immersed with the rest of the veterans, Brey said he would pay close atten­tion to see how Peterkin adjusts. If necessary, he said he would consider holding the 6-foot-9 freshman out of games his freshman year to preserve a year of eligibility. 
But when Quinn, Francis and Cornett join Peterkin on campus this weekend, Brey laughed at the thought of the other three freshmen helping Peterkin adjust to college life. After all, Brey said, they spent six weeks on campus and can't wait to help their teammate out. 
"I think it was a giant help just getting acclimated to the college level," Quinn said. "We got to learn about how a col­lege class would go, and ath­letically, we got to play against guys day in and day out. It just kind of set up the process of learning about what we have to do."

Fresh in the system 
. Freshmen look to adjust to new offensive, defensive schemes 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Sports \Xlrircr 
Chris Olsen was nervous. 
In the corners of team meeting rooms and 011 tlrn summer practice fields. uppPrclassmen hintf'd what kind of' initiation routine the freshman quarterback would have to go through. Somo hinted at shaving heads. others 111enlioned climbing up on tablPs and singing high school fight songs. 
Rookie quarterback Olsen and the other 17 frPshman recruits wr,ren't quite sure what to expect.. But they didn't plan on first-year head coach Tyrone Willingham banning freshman hazing. 
"I think that made the freshmen feel a lot better." Olsen said. "There were a few worries that we were going to havp to do something things hazing­wise. but most of tlw upperclassmen told us that there would be none of that this year, and they wanted to make it easier on us as freshmen. I think that put everyonP at ease." 
Besides, the freshmen had enough to worry about trying to learn the complex new offensive and defensive schemes thrown at them by [rish coaches. 
When the first-year players arrived on campus nearly three weeks ago, the coaching staff handed the entire playbook to the young recruits, forc­ing them to try to understand every­thing to which the rest of the team had eight months to assimilate. 
That's a ton of information to learn in a short puiod of time. Blocking schemes, cov1~rages, pass routes, audibles -the list piled up quickly. In many cases. the newest membnrs of' the Irish squad lf'arned more schemes iu a week than Orny did during their senior seasons. 
"It's a lot to learn. and at some point, that overload hits. and then they don't respond very well to the conditions around them." Willingham said. "Most freshmen go through it, and ours are no different. They're going through it. anti they're trying to find thrir way to -bi·rak through it and really start to find their place on this 
team." 
Four freshmen -Olson, running back Naw Schiccatano. safety Jake Carnry and offensivE' linPman Scott Raridon -spent the summer with the rest of the team participating in con­ditioning drills. That gave thE'm a bit of a clue about what to expect when fall camp started in August. 
"Anything is going to be difficult at first," Carney said. "But once we got in and got some reps, we started to grasp it a little better. and having the team around makes it a little less nerve-racking." 
"The first few davs it's real intimi­dating being out the"re with the other guys, but l got more comfortable with them," Olsen added. "They always say good job and try to make it easier for me." 
Highly touted wide receivers Maurice Stovall and Rhema McKnight have the greatest chance of playing as freshman. Under the option-oriented offense former head coach Bob Davie used during last year's 5-6 season, the Irish finished 114th in the nation in scoring offense and rarely threw the ball. Only Omar Jenkins and Arnaz Battle had at least five catches.

Irish return with depth 
By CHRIS FEDERICO Spores Editor 
After a verv successful inau­gural season· for men's soccer coach Bobbv Clark in 2001. the sophomore ·coach will return to Alumni Field this fall with a young. but experienced squad looking to build on last season's NCAA. Tournament appear­ance. the program·s firsl in five vears. 
 The Irish return nine starters from last season's tPam that shocked many in the collegiate soccer world by turning a 7-8-2 tram in 2000 into a 12-7 finish­er. The Irish played to a 7-3 record in the Big East and fin­ished in a tie for second by advancing to the Big East Tournament Semifinals before dropping a 1-0 decision to the r-wentual conference champion St. John's University. 
The 2002 campaign actually began for the Irish on Aug. 2 in Scotland with a two-week, five­game exhibition tour for the nturning upperclassmen. 
"On the Scolland lrip, the guys worked very hard. Tlrny played five games in 11 days with only an 18 man roster," Clark said. "\Nhen you consider that two of those guys [senior Alan Lyskawa and sophomore Luke Boughen] were unable to play because of an injury, and two were goalkeepers. that left us with 14 players. Since European rules don't allow us to have free substitution like we do in the states, that can be very exhausting for th<l guys." 
The Irish went 4-0-1 during the trip, knocking off semi-pro squads Formantine United 6-1 and Banks of Dee 8-1. Notre Dame then faced the heavier competition of the full-time professionals, beating Hoss

Waldrum looks to rediscover focus 
By JOE LICANDRO Sports Wricer 
A shocking second-round NCAA Tournament upset loss to Cincinnati ended Notre Dame's frustrating 2001 campaign. This season. with ten new names on his roster and thirteen returning players, Irish coach Handy Waldrum is hoping that his squad is ready to return to national prominence. 
"Our freshman class also will be led by some highly-competi­tive and driven players," he said. 'Td be very surprised if we don't rediscover that focus and consis­tency that's so important to what Notre Dame soccer is all about." 
Of 23 players, only Ashley Dryer and Vanessa Pruzinsky are seniors, meaning learlership could be an issue for the Irish. However. Waldrum is confident in the leadership abilities of the other veterans to help the incom­
