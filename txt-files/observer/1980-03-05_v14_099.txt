Former Alaska Governor Walter ]. Hickel will address tonight's Mock Republican Convention, as keynote speaker. 
Anderson UJins Massachusetts 
BOSTON (AP) -Rep. John Anderson surged from the Re­publican field to hold Ronald Reagan and George Bush to startling standoffs last night in the Vermont and Massachu­setts primaries. Sen. Edward Kennedy gained a landslide vic­tory at home iq Massachusetts, but President Carter swamped him in Vermont. 
Anderson led by a handful of votes as the Vermont vote neared completion. He had led throughout most of the evening but Reagan earned a spurt of late votes.. from a number of rural towns. 
Anderson remained narrowly ahead in Massachusetts. · 
The white-thatched congress­man from Illinois was the big gainer in a two-primary day. After campaigning as a lonely, liberal outsider, he earned his credentials as a contender in contests to come. 
Kennedy was gaini 1g 65 per­cent of Massachusert's Demo­cratic vote. He told a Bos­ton victory rally that his vic­tory proves the voters ''will not tolerate an inflation rate of 20 percent and an inter­est rate of 17 percent.'' They want, he said, the wage-price freeze he advocates. 
"We have faced adversity and disappointment'' in the challenge to Carter, he said, but none so serious as the economic woes facing the A­met;ican people. 
Anderson succeeded in vali­dating his claim that the Re­publican race has not narrowed to a two-candidate affair be­tween Reagan and Bush. 
With more than two-thirds of the Massal ~usetts precincts counted, Anderson was gain­ing 31 percent of the vote, .Bush 31 percent and Reagan

u.S.admits  
to foul-up  
on Israel vote  
WASHINGTON· (AP) -Secre­ 
tary of State Cyrus R. Vance  
took responsibility yesterday  
for a "foulup" in which the  
United States voted for a U.N.  
resolution critical of Israel's  
occupation of'east Jerusalem.  
The U.S. vote in favor of  
the resolution touched off a  
diplomatic and political furor·  
and President Carter issued  
a statement Monday night say­ 
ing the vote had bten an  
error and was cast in the  
mistaken belief that references  
to Jerusalem had been deleted.  
·JJ State D~partment spokesman  
Hodding Carter said yesterday  
that Vance was taking respon­ 
sibility for the "foulup" and  
that President Carter's instruc­ 
jons on how to vote on the  
issue were not transmitted cor­ 
rectly to Donald McHenry, the  
U.S. Ambassador to the United  
Nations.  
''The Secretary of State ac­ 
cepts responsibility for the fail­ 
ure in communications,''  
spokesman Carter said.  
Following Satuday's U.N. vote  
the Israeli cabinet, meeting  
in Jerusalem, formally rejected  
the Security Council resolution  
which called for dismanding  
all old and new Jewish set­ 
tlements in occupied Arab ter­ 
ritory. The Israeli cabinet  
.expressed dismay over the U.S.  
vote.  
The resolution's repeated ref­ 
erences to Jerusalem as occu­ 
pied territory is particularly  
mitating to israel. The city was reunited during the Six­Day war of 1967 and is now the country's 'Capital. In the "clarification" issued  I I J j  
by the White House on Mon­day, President Carter assured Israel that the vote "does not represent a change in our  ~  
position regarding the Israeli  
settlements in the occupied  
areas nor regarding the status  
ofJerusalem.''  
According to Sate Department  
spokesman C::.arter, before Mc­ 
Henry could vote for the re­ 
solution the references to J e­ 
rusalem were to have been  
:leleted. The instructions were  
"mistranslated," he said.  
In Addition to infuriating the  
Israelis, McHenry said at a  
news conference that the ad­ 
ministration's repudiation of its  
vote Wll;S certain to anger the  
Arab world.  
''The effect in the /Arab world will not be loving,"  
McHenry said. He said there  
would be "wounded feelings"  
among Arab governmc::nts. .  

In Vermont, Anderson and Reagan each had 31 percent, and Bush was well back at 22 percent. 
That left the candidates short of the 40 percent required to win any delegates there; they will be chosen later at a state party convention. 
The three GOP leaders were to divide about equally most of Massachusetts' 42 Repub­lican delegates. 
Reagan said he was not un­happy to be in a three-way tie in Massachusetts. 
Reagan and Bush, who had struggled for the elusive man-· tle of Republican frontrunner, left the Republican field without a clear leader. This could make it easier for for­mer President Gerald R. Ford to enter the competition be­latedly. 

Anderson's support was bouy­ed by a hefty turnout of in­dependent voters in the Repub­lican primaries in both states. That' won't be available to him later in closed primaries where only registered Republicans can vote. 
J ody Powell, in Burlington, Vt., said Vermont Democrats provided Carter with his widest margin of the season, 3 to 1.

Ata record 17.25% 

Inflation signalsprime rate increase 
NEW YORK (AP) -With business still lining up to borrow money despite record-high interest rates, major banks yesterday raised their prime lending rates to a record 17 114 percent. 
The increase, begun by Chase Manhattan Bank and matched by nearly every major bank, came in response to new signs the Federal Reserve is determined to tighten credit. 
''The Federal Reser:ve is now telling us it is aiming for a recession,'' said William Gibson, an economist with the Wall Street firm of Smith Barney, Aarris Upham & Co. "It's trying to do whatever it takes to slow down the economy.'' 
"We're on the brink of a credit crisis," said another Wall Street economist, David Jones of Hubrey G. Lanston & Co. "It's very likely the cost of money will be prohibitive to a growing number of small and middle-sized companies." 
Chase Manhattan, the third-largest bank in the nation, cited a "very strong" demand for business loans and rapidly rising interest rates it pays to acquire funds as the reasons for the increase from 16 3/4 percent. 

The prime rate is charged by banks on loan.s to their most credit-worthy corporate borrowers. It ' stood at 151 I 4 percent Feb. 15 when the Federal 
Reserve launched its latest effort to tighten credit as a way of fighting inflation. 
Other industrial and commercial borrowers pay more than the prime rate, in some cases more than 20 percent. But the demand for loans has grown in recent weeks, despite the high rates. 
The prime rate does not directly affect rates on consumer loans, but is widely watched as an indicator of short-term interest rates. 
The surge in rates this week came after the Federal Reserve acted to reduce the amount of reserves available to banks, and thereby reduce the·amount of money available for lending. 
Among the banks that .{>OS ted the 171 I 4 percent prime was San Francisco-based bank of America, the nation's largest ranked by de­posits. Among the top 10 banks, only No. 2 Citibank, ofNew York, failed to join the move to 171 I 4 percent. Citibank traaitionally announces changes in its prime rate on Fridays. 
Most Wall Street analysts think the prime rate wiU keep rising, probably to 18 percent and perha.Ps beyond, as the Federal Reseve tries to fight mflation by slowing the economy. .

Thirteen year oldtycoon rewrites NYtax law 
ALBANY, N.Y.-Jody Gerard, the 13-year-old required to pay sales tax on his fisbing-worm sales, was met by scowls when he confronted State Tax Commissioner James Tully. But Tully says he was only teasing as he tried Monday to convince J ody that he never meant to be an ogre. And J ody, in a similar spirit, presented the Legislature with a bag of red wrigglers "just so you all remember me." "I'm glad you dectded to help change this law. If you figure it out logically, it cost the state more to collect the whole $3 tax I paid than I could pay in my childhood,'' said J ody in a brief speech he had prepared for the occasion. 
CAB grants approvalfor service to Cleveland -~ 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Air Wisconsin received permission today from the Civil Aeronautics Board to begin providing non-stop service between South Bend and Cleveland. The airline was among 26 carriers allowed to add an additional route each under an automatic entry provision of the airline deregulation act. The provision permits an airline to apply for one new route a year for three years starting in 1979. The CAB must grant the request unless it finds that an award would substantially harm the national air transportation system, or if an incumbent carrier has successfully protected that route. On Dec. 31, 1981, the CAB will lose its authority over domestic routes and the airlines will have almost total freedom to fly where they want. 
U.S. agrees to buygrain left from Soviet embargo 
WASHINGTON -Agriculture Secretary Bob Bergland announced today plans to buy up to 13 million metric tons of wheat and corn, part of the gram that President Carter two months ago embargoed from d~li~ery to the Soviet Un~o~. Officials said the purchases will mvolv~ _up to 4.25 mtlhon metric tons of wheat and up to 9 mtllwn of corn. The purchases will be made ''at prevailing market prices'' from country elevators and, in some cases, farmers themselves. No costs were announced, but at current farm prices the furchases could total as much as $1.4 b~ll~on, including about f819 million for the corn and $582 mtllton for the whellt.

S~Csophs 
hold parents' weekend 
by Mary Agnes Carey 
Over 300 Saint Mary's soph­omores and their parents par­ticipated in the annual "Soph­omore Parent Weekend" last weekend, establishing a new attendance record for the event, according to Nini Stoll; SPW chairman. · 
"The turnout was excellent, the budget worked out, and everyone had an excellent weekend," Stoll said. 
Events for students and parents included the soph­omore ~class production, ''If They Could See Us Now,'' a champagne receptioni a faculty­admimstration pane , an aca­demic open house, a dinner­dance at Century Center, and Sunday mass at the Church of Our Lady of Loretto with brunch 
at the SMC cafeteria. 
Anita Ramker, producer and 
director of the sophomore class 
production, expressed her sa­
tisfaction with the cast, ''I was 
very pleased that the girls 
worked so hard. . They really 
had to dedicate themselves, 
since we've been rehearsing for 
six months for the show. 
Everything went as planned, if 
not better," Ramker said. 
Colleen Murphy, a soph­
omore, explained, ''The whole 
weekend was really very well 
planned and I think it was one 
of the best weekends I've had 
since I've been at Saint 
Mary's." 
Mary ] o Schramm, another 
sophomore, agreed. "Soph­
omore Parent Weekend was a 
good way to bring us closer to 
our parents as well as to our 
friends," she said.

John Auerbach 
Rea:Jing -MONDAY MARCH lOth 4:00PM MEM LIB AUD 
With neither malice or charity towards anyone, John Auerbach structures the silence of our lives in such a way that is both arresting and sympathetic. 
I stood on the poop deck watching Greek islands conjured out from the sea which zpas a silver panel, and disappeanng szlently to give place to other zslands ... 
In the same way an island will both appear and disappear when one stands viewin~ it from a ship, so the stability of ltfe is transitory and wandering. Auerbach writes of the disposessed, the pathetic mambers of the Hebrew nation. He writes of a people tainted with a malevolent tntluence, a past thay can and should not for~et. 
In hts works, Auerbach builds an interesting tension which can be descrihed as ''The Unwilling Under­standing." His characters are co­erced tnCO situations in which they, albeit not by choice, must face the trith of their existence mirrored in the pathos of an unwitting companion. Industrialized man can not forget the past, says Auerbach, even by ignor­tng the present. 
He was born inWarsaw, has lived in Israel, and is presently working with Saul Bellow, a man who greatly admires him at the University of Chicago. His works have been pub­lished in Midstream and Prism magazines, and he will be included in an upcoming issue of Commentary. At the same time as he is speaking here, the Spingold Theater of Bran­deis University will be performing his play, Endgame in Kiryat Gat.

Fisher represents a rather para­doxical English nature poet. His imagery of light and wind c.'nnot be disputed, but that imagery is in competition with the confined reality of the walled, urban society. An example of this is found in a poem entitled ''The Park''. Here the reader confronts and contrasts a "sky drawn thin with frost, I its cloud-rims bright and bitter'', and a ''Shallow concrete lake,/scummed over, fouled with paper''. The essential nature of such a society must perish. 

POET'S WORKSHOP FRIDAY MARr:H 14th MEM. LIB. LOUNGE 11:00 AM 
Louise Gluck is undoubtedly one of the most highly regarded members of the c~ntemporary literary world; the critics agree that her distinctive style captivates her audience, ~awing the reader's ima~ination alon~ wit~ her as the poem develops. Whtle many of the works whtch appeared m Fzrstborn, her first volume of poetry, are vigorous and arresting, the uniformity of the tense emotions in her second volume, The HrJuse on the Marshland, illustrate~ how a style can mature to become even more effective. In the latter book, the reader ftnds his own identity entangled with the poem's at the end of the reading, juH as Gluck herself meshes indiscriminately the autobiographical and he universal. 
Gluck was born Arril 22, 1943 in New York City.. She attended Sarah Lawrence College and Columbia University. Her lengthy list of honors include: an Academy of American p, ets Prize, a Rockefeller Foundation grant, a National Endowment of the An ; grant, the Eunice Tietjens Memorial Prize from Poetry, and a Guggenheim I ellowshtp. In addition to the volumes previously mentioned, Gluck has written The Garden, and many of her 
selections appear in various popular anthologies. 
Ms. Gluck's poems are highly praised by literary reviews even though they concede that her earlier works were net polished--at times the images were too obvious and the words too crowded--; nevertheless, they are still beautiful as unfinished gems. The poems are indeed brilliant, but are missing the crowning glory ~ince they too consciously strove for perfection. They are, according to the Sewanee Review: "tense performances, ... brilliant but lack reson.mce," and unfortunately the reader "cannot bel: eve a one of them." 
However the consensus seems to be unanimous that Gluck has reached a new It:vel of excellence in her later work. The critics ala: :>st seem superfluous in their praise--they say that everywhere she has r1anaged to entwine opposite elements in an emotional and realistic way. Quoting the Sewanee Review again, "Invention agrees with taste... bola and restrained ... originality. could not at the same time be more classis... purity and poise." But this seemingly excessive admiration can be understood by wanderin through some of her drifting lines : ''Sap rises from the sodden ditch/ anc glues two gree .I ears/ to the dead birch twig./'Perilous beauty ... " 
Gluck's poems bring together many elements of pain and confusion and beauty. She ties them together in a beautiful and moving style. Her poems seem to relfect her feelings, as well as the reader's feelings: they seem to have a life of their own. Since she has exhibited such remarkable improvement since her earlier work, which is superb, yet incomparable to the more recent efforts, there is no telling how much further she can go as she wanders through even more of life's experiences, through, as she expresses it, "the proper pain."

The scenes depict~d are of human beings all found tn tpe worst of situations. 
Most of the stories in Black Tickets are ofa page or less, but Ms. Phillips does not need much space to say a great dea! about life. Her characters are usually either destitutely poor, morally dead, or, have in some way been deprived love, caring or c. ..ense of being needed. Girls that tell each other dirty words stories in a shack while small boys listen avidly out­side; and a fourteen-year-old mute orphan girl who sells dirty pictures and hustles her bodr for her drug ad~i~t , pimp. are al exa~ined _in Philltp s wnung. The world ts deple­ted as a sadistic carnival groumd wher! the .nentally deranged are all on a free ide. 
But alo .g with the cruelty of life exists the :;orrow for those that are its victims. Although still somewhat farfetched, these few stories add a touch of sentiment that is noticeably absent beforehand. The common situation is the more or less reluctant return home of a young woman, usually a student or teacher, who finds herself challenged or threat­ened by _parent's concern about what she's domg with her life. There is also the father who touchingly deflects his worry about his daughter into an obsessive and annoying worry of her car, and the mother who upon hearing her daughter making love with her boyfriend, leaves the house, not out of offended assumptions of decercy, but because she fears revh ag her dead interest in sexual 
grat .lcation. Bt, ck Tickets is not a collection of 
fairy  tales  about  people  that  live  
happily  ever  after,  but  then,  few  
people  in  real  life  ever  do.  

Instead, Jayne Anne Phillips takes a harsh look at reality and puts society through the ringer. In the process, she provides an awakening for those persons who have a tendency to act as if the world were just fine and dandy as it is. Unfortunately, it is these same people that will not get past the title page without consider­tor the book worthless.

Recipient ofa Guggenheim Fellow­ship in 1949 and an award from the National Academy of Arts and Let­ters, ) ohn Cage has constantly confounded audiences for his radical innovation in musical composition and literature. 
Born in Los Angeles in 1912, and educated at Ponoma College, Cage made his debut in New York in 1943. Cage, a former student of avant -garde composer Arnold Schoenberg, directed a large group of musicians who played flowerpots, brake bands, and other objects. Schoenberg, Cage claimed, was never radical enough. In an interview in 1946,cage stated that his major contribution to musical composition was the elimination of harmony. 
Cage carries his radical artistic views to literature. Author of M: Selected Wn'tings 67-72, and several other works, Cage expresses Zen Buddhist comvictions. Both his music and his literary works reflect Cage's artistic and intellectual diversity. Concert-goers, readers and students of art ftnd Cage's work stimulating, innovative and, sometimes, shocking. 
Peggy Glanville-Huhs once wrote: '') ohn Cage is one of the rarest people ... not only is he endowed with humor, an inordinate sense of beauty and purity, and a brilliant musical brain, but he brings with him, wherever he may be, the happiness and tranquility of an integrated personality and a mind of peace."

Charles Simic, Yugoslavian born poet presently residing in the United States, is the author of four books of poetry: What the Grass Says (1967), Somewhere Amoung us a Stone is Taking Notes, Dismantling the Si­leflce (1971), and White (1972). He also translated the works of several French, Russian and Yugoslavian writers including Vasko Popa and Luan Luok. Simic graduated from New York University in 1966 with a bachelor of arts. He is presently teaching at California State College in Hayward. 
Simic's poetry is primarily con­cerned with the relationship between individual man and the natural world around him, which, Simic _perceives is innately good and leads to the truth. The natural world speaks with a different language, and for Simic, the major problem for the poet is to struggle with the deftencies of the language of man which must inter-. pret what the poet intuitively per­ceives from his touch with nature. 
Simic's poetic style has been described as one of austure simplici­ty. He prefers a plain phrase and describes concrete tmages. Paradoxi­cally, his strong common oblects

hostages inside the U.S. Em­

a meeting between the approxi­

President Abolhassan Bani-
Sadr said. 
The militants said earlier they 
would not let the five-member 
panel see the hostages, who 
began their fifth IJlonth in 
captivity yesterday. 
The militants have followed Khomeini's directives in the past. A spokesman for them, contacted by telephone after . the council meeting, said they 
had not been informed of 
Khomeini's decision and de­
dined further comment. · Bani-Sadr, speakin~ to repor­
