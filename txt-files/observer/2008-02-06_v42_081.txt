ND: No double-take for tw-ins 

Siblings' applications reviewed separately 
By ANN-MARIE WOODS News Writer 
On average, about six sets of twins apply for admission to Notre Dame every year. In 2005, Chris and Lindsay Holland were one of them. 
Though both had dreamed of attending Notre Dame, only Chris was admitted to the class of 2010. 
"I think she was happy for me but it was both of our dreams to come here and I would have loved to share that with her," Holland said. 
The Hollands' case should put to rest any uncertainties about the University's handling of twin appli­cants, Assistant Provost for Enrollment Dan Saracino said. Notre Dame reviews twins' appli­cations separately, he said, quenching rumors that the University would -by policy ­either accept both twins or reject both. 
"Applicants' files are each viewed separately," he said. 
In this way, Saracino said, every student has the opportunity to excel in the admissions office, based on his or her credentials. He said it's not a good idea to base admissions decisions on whether the applicant's twin sibling is also a good candidate. 
"It would not be fair to the twin applicant pool or to the entire applicant pool," Saracino said. 
But freshmen twin brothers Kennedy and Coleman Collins said during their application process last year, a Notre Dame represen­

After being held at an off­campus location in 2007, "The Vagina Monologues" will be performed in a DeBartolo classroom at Notre Dame from March 26­28. 
Organizers tailored the production to fit specific guidelines set forth by University President Father John Jenkins -who, after speaking with students and faculty for 10 weeks in 2006 -decided not to prohibit the sexually explicit Eve Ensler play at Notre Dame.

entrust academic depart­ments with deciding what events should and should not be sponsored, and they emphasize the need for mul­tiple viewpoints on contro­versial topics. 
As a result, each perform­ance of the "Monologues" will be followed by an aca­demic panel discussion that will approach the play from different intellectual per­spectives. 
"We used those [guidelines) and sat down and consid­ered, 'How can we make this event fulfill this criteria?'" said senior Lisa Raub, one of the play's lead organizers.

Witness of Rockne crash remembered 
By MEG MIRSHAK News Writer 
James "Easter" Heathman, who was 13 when he rushed to a pasture near his family's home in Chase County, Kan., to find the plane crash that killed Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne, died Jan. 29. He was 90. 
Heathman died at an Emporia, Kan., hospital of complications from pneumonia, his son, Tom Heathman, said. , 
On a cold, foggy March morn­ing in 1931, Easter Heathman heard the sound of engines roar­ing, his son said. Seeing nothing outside, Easter Heathman thought it was a car racing along the highway. 
Shortly after, the phone rang and a telephone operator from Bazaar, Kan., informed the Heathman household that a plane had crashed near their home, Tom Heathman said. 
"Dad, his dad and a few of his brothers jumped in their Model-T and drove up there," Tom Heathman said. "They saw the tail of the plane in the air and the engines driven into the ground." 
At the crash site, which is on a cattle pasture located three miles south of Bazaar, Heathman saw five bodies thrown from the plane and three more still inside. Just a week shy of his 14th birthday, Heathman was one of the first people to arrive at the scene. 
A few days later, newspapers reported that Rockne was among the victims but even then, "it did­n't mean anything to [Easter)," Tom Heathman said. 
Rockne, who was 43 at the time of his death, led Notre Dame to consecutive undefeated seasons in his last two years. In his 13 years at Notre Dame, Rockne's team won six national champi­onships. 
President Herbert Hoover called Rockne's death "a national loss." 
But to a young Easter Heathman in a small Kansas farming community, Notre Dame football was not a topic of every­day conversation, Tom Heathman said. 
"Dad became more interested in Notre Dame from talking to people," he said. 
After he retired, Easter Heathman got permission to take people to the crash site, which is located on private property. He took people on free tours to the site for about 20 years, Tom Heathman said. 
"He loved taking people up there and enjoyed the people he met who made an effort to come to Chase County from every­where," Easter Heathman's 
'Peru Days' to aid quake victims 
By DENNIS SLATER News Writer 
On Aug. 15, 2007, a powerful earthquake killed more than 500 people in the region just south of Lima, Peru. Today, the Kellogg Center for International Studies will start auctioning the work of internationally acclaimed Peruvian photographer Guillermo Rivas to benefit the victims of the tragedy. 
In exhibition at the Great Hall of the llesburgh Center for International Studies since Jan. 28, Rivas' photographs focus on the colorful Feast of the Virgin of Candelaria, which is going on now in the Andean town of Puno, near Lake Titicaca. The artist's daugh­ter, senior Andrea Hivas Dreyfuss,

daughter, Sue Ann Brown, said. 
A monument was erected in 1934 on the site by the Chase County Chamber of Commerce to honor the eight victims of the accident. 
"Dad took it upon himself to show people the monument because he didn't want the guys who died in the crash to be for­gotten," Tom Heathman said. 
The limestone rock and marble monument, which stands at about 10 feet tall, is engraved with the names of all eight victims. But even before the monument was there, Easter Heathman had taken it upon himself to honor those who were killed. 
"Dad built eight wooden crosses because he wanted people to know that there were eight peo­ple, not just Knute Rockne," Tom Heathman said.

Meinbers discuss a possible taxi flat rate 
By JOSEPH McMAHON Assistant News Editor 
The Council of Representatives lCOR) met Tuesday to discuss a plan to make taxi services in South Bend cheaper and more reli­able for students. 
Sophomore Gustavo Gari, the Keenan senator and chair­man of the Campus Life Council's taskforce on commu­nity relations, presented to the Council the basic ideas of a proposal that will be given to Vice President of Student Affairs Father Mark Poorman at the beginning of April. 
The proposal will outline suggestions, including the pos­sibility of a flat rate for stu­dents. 
"We'd like something where we can involve cab companies and different parts of the administration to get some­thing where students get charged a flat rate," Gari said. 
Many COR members voiced concerns that cab companies charge students more than other South Bend residents. Gari said the implementation of a flat rate would help fix

Rooting and recruiting 
Today is perhaps the most exciting 
day in wllege sports. At least in the 
ofT-season. Sorry, Mr. Mora, I'm not 
talking about playoffs, and no, Mr. 
Iverson, I'm not talking about prac­
tice. 
I'm talking 

about National Tae Andrews 
Signing Day. 

On a day more Scene Editor exciting to some than Super 
Tuesday, grown men across the coun­
try will cheek their Internet browsers 
to see if very large and highly athletic 
young men across the country have 
signed on the dotted line with their 
eo liege of choice. 

Notre Dame happens to be one such 
college. 

After suffering through the worst 
s1mson of football in Notre Dame histo­
ry, Irish fans, media and recruiting 
awlytes turn to the future, as names 
such as quarterback Dane Crist and 
n~ceiver Mike Floyd have the potential 
to be1:ome the Brady Quinns and Jeff 
Samardzijas of the future. 

Given tlw utter ineptitude of the 
2007 campaign, the Irish faithful 
found thmnselves reduced to reveling 
in the schadenfreude of other pro­
grams' struggles (see Michigan­
Appalaehian State, or Ohio State's 
blowout loss to LSU in the title game) 
and trading on-fiP.Id trash talk for 
wait-till-next-year wagers. So what if 
(insert team from the 2007) blew out 
Notre Dame'? Our recruiting class is 
top-live, haby! 

As of Tuesday night, recruiting Web 
site rivals.1:om had Notre Dame's crop 
or committed recruits rated third in 
tlw nation, up there with the likes or 
powerhouse programs such as 
Florida. Alabama and Oklahoma. 
Unfortunatnly, during the wooing, 
wining and dining process recruits can 
vacillate more than Mitt Homney dis­
cussing abortion. The wild and woolly 
world of college football recruiting 
features more conniving, de-commit­
ting, backstabbing and betrayal than 
an episode of "The Heal World." 
As such. nothing is set in stone until it's set in ink, which is why today is such an important day for Notre Dame football. One highly-rated prospeet, Omar llunter (cue Darth Vader "kill" chant), already fled the coop for Florida, marking the seeond time in as many years that Gators coach Urban Meyer (cough cough @$"%&$*) has poached a Notre Dame recruit. 
Ilopefully, all of Notre Dame's rncruits will put their ink where their mouth is and make good on their ver­bal commitments. If they do, the Golden Dome looks to have more four­and five-stars gatherPd in one place than a sta!T meeting at the Pentagon. 
So keep your fingers crossed and hope for a little luck for the Irish. Notre Dame's Golden Dome has been lacking in luster as of late. Keeping all of our recruits would help get back some of that golden glow.

The reb. I article, "NO looks w boost llnancial aid," said that over the past 18 years, spending on financial aid has risen from $55 million to $72 million.

BOARD OF GOVERNANCE 


Conunittee seeks funds for Midnight Madness 
By ASHLEY CHARNLEY News Writer 
The head of the committee for Saint Mary's annual Midnight Madness, senior Noreen Sherred, sought funds for the event at Tuesday's Board of Governance (BOG) meeting. Midnight Madness, co-sponsored by the athletic department, is an annual night of games, food and door prizes inside the Angela Athletic Facility. 
"[The event] brings the Saint Mary's community together and builds Saint Mary's pride," said Sherred, who is also the athletic commissioner. 
This year, the event will be run by students more than in the past, she said. 
"Midnight Madness is put on to reward the women for all of the service they give the community throughout the year," Sherred said. 
And it's only fair that they are in charge of it, she said. 
The committee for the event has sent out letters and is cur­rently receiving donations for prizes, Sherred said. However, it still needs more funding for food and decorations. The usual stipend from the athletic depart­ment has been cut back this year because the department believes it shouldn't spend too many resources on events that aren't specilically for Saint Mary's ath­letes, she said.

Mass, penance scheduled 
Notre Dame, Saint Mary's offer services for Ash Wednesday 
By NIKKI TAYLOR News Writer 
With the start of the Lenten season today, both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's will be offering prayer services and Masses to observe Ash Wednesday. 
Mass will be celebrated at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart today at 11:30 a.m. and 5:15 p.m. At Saint Mary's, Mass will be cele­brated at 7 and 11 a.m. at the Church of Our Lady of Loretto and at 9 p.m. in the Regina Chapel. There will also be a Liturgy of the Word and distribution of ashes at 
12:15 and 6 p.m. in the Regina Chapel. 
"Ash Wednesday services will be standing room only in the chapel," Judy Fe an, director of Campus Ministry at Saint Mary's, said. 
Father Joe Carey, assistant director of Campus Ministry (CM) at Notre Dame, said he expects students to fill the Ash Wednesday services. 
"The Masses in the Basilica and the residence halls are well attended every year," Carey said. 
Since one of the main focuses of Lent is penance, CM will host a campus-wide Lenten Penance service Thursday at 7 p.m. in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. After the prayer service there will be 10 priests available for individual confessions, Carey said. 
For a deeper spiritual experience, both schools also will be offering retreats dur­ing the Lenten season. The Four:7 Catholic fellowship is sponsoring a Lenten retreat, "The Journey Through the Desert," this weekend. At Saint Mary's, there will be a Busy Person's Retreat, designed to fit the hectic schedules of students. 
Running from Feb. 10-14, this type of retreat takes up one hour every day. Participants spend 30 min­utes per day in prayer and then another 30 minutes talking with a spiritual guide, Fean said. 
Father John Pearson will host a three-part analysis on Catholicism and Lent enti­tled, "Sin, Grace, and Reconciliation." He will dis­cuss these topics during the next three Tuesdays. 
The Lenten tradition of Stations of the Cross will be observed at both campuses. Stations of the Cross will be held every Friday during Lent at 7:15 p.m. in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. In addition, Saint Mary's and Notre Dame will both be hosting campus-wide Stations of the Cross in March. 
Notre Dame's Cross Cultural Ministries will also be hosting a Lenten Day of Reflection at Creek House on Feb. 24. 
Fean said she hopes the variety of events and services available to students will allow them to fit some of them into their schedules. 
"We have different events from last year. We are look­ing forward to offering opportunities throughout the six weeks so students can take advantage and grow spiritually," Fean said. 
This is "a season when everyone in this community is encouraged to examine his or her life and see how they can live holier lives," Carey said.

this problem. 
"It's a legitimate concern and one of the major reasons we're exploring a flat rate," he said. 
The taskforce, Gari said, is currently doing extensive research on the issue by talk­ing to various groups in the Notre Dame administration, including Poorman, Notre Damn Security/Police and Card Services. The task force has also contacted other universi­ties, ineluding the University of Virginia, Duke and Vanderbilt, to learn about the programs they currently have in place. 

"Thn list of schools we're rnsearching for this report has a range of city sizes," student body president Liz Brown said. 
Gari said Virginia's system was especially interesting because it allows students to swipe their student ID inside the cab and charge the fare to their university account. 
In other COR news: 
+ The Council also discussed the possibility of rriaking the Student Business Board gener­al manager a voting member. 

The proposal, which was put forth by Student Union Board treasurer Kedeja Gaines, would require a change to the Student Body Constitution. Though there wasn't an offi­cial vote, Brown conducted an informal "straw poll," where the majority of the membnrs polled said they would not support the proposal. 
The Student Business Board is comprised of two student­owned businesses -Irish c;ardens and Adworks. According to the group's Web site, "it is the responsibility of the Student Business Board to provide students with practi­cal experience in a business environment and offer conven­ient serviens to the Notre Monogram Club, Kil said. 
Brown said her father feared the plane crash story would be lost once he could not take people to the site anymore. But last November, fundraising efforts began in Cha_<;e County for the cre­aticm of a Knute Rockne Museum, Brown said. 
"Dad wanted to see it opened," she said. 
She said the effort began after a member of the Rockne family offered to donate a 1932 restored Hoekne Studebaker ear if a place to display it eould be furnished. 
The Chase County Historical Society has since purchased a building that is currently being refurbished to house the ear and other memorabilia, aeeording to Brown. 
And while a museum might efl'eetively carry on the story of what happened on March 31, 1931, Tom Heathman said his father's own version will also live on among those who knew him. 
"Dad has touched a lot of people and I don't think we will quit hear­ing about !his story)," Tom Heathman said. 
Kil agreed, saying Easter Heathman and all the members of his family "are exceptional people in the way they treat others and respect the legacy of Knute Rockne. Just knowing him, to everyone who came to him and visited him, he treated everybody equally."

Dame community. The mmi­mum goal of the Student Business Board is to break­even after all debts are paid." 
Gaines said she "feels strongly that the Student Business Board manager should be added" to the voting list. But for various reasons, many COR members disagreed with her. 
Chief executive assistant Sheena Plamoottil said she wasn't sure any of the issues discussed in COR would apply to the Student Business Board manager. 
"I don't really see the value of him being in COR," she said. 
Junior class president Hobert Reish suggested that perhaps the Student Business Board manager should be added as a nonvoting member, but Brown said she did not sec the purpose in that move. 
+ Brown also announced student government will be hosting a town-hall meeting on the University's policy of hiring Catholic professors. The meeting most likely will be held in Washington Hall in late February. 
There will be a debate fol­lowed by a question-and­answer session exploring whether the University should set a quota for the number of Catholic faculty members. In addition to members of the student body, some Notre Dame faculty and administra­tors will attend. 
Attendance will be mandato­ry for all student government members.

was first performed at Notre Dame in 2002. More than 600 colleges and uni­versities stage the produc­tion during the months of January, February and March as part of the world­wide V-Day campaign, which aims to raise aware­ness about sexual violence against women.

But last year, organizers failed to find a department to sponsor the production and held the "Monologues" at South Bend's First Unitarian Church. This was due to hurried planning ­not faculty or department unease, Rauh said. 
The sociology and anthro­pology departments are co­sponsoring the 2008 "Monologues." Faculty members in both depart­ments agreed to do so unanimously, according to Mark Schurr, chair of the anthropology department, and Rory McVeigh, chair of the sociology depart­ment. 
The academic panel schedule is still being finalized, Raub said. The first panel is scheduled to present a theological per­spective on the play, and the second panel will study the play from socio­logical and anthropologi­cal standpoints. 
The final panel will most likely examine how the "Monologues" can help victims of sexual violence heal and move forward ­a topic "that has never been included" in panel discussions in the past, Raub said. "I think that's an aspect of the play that

"Monologues" -a signal, he said, that Jenkins' final decision regarding the pro­duction was well received. 
"You could put any play on in the DPAC, and if it was just a play by itself it would be entertainment," he said. "But if it was engaged ... talked about by professors, used as a course assignment ... it becomes an intellectual event. It's up to the students and faculty to look for the intellectual con­

is really important." 

The panel for the psycho­logical discussion will inelude psychology experts who study performance and music "as a part of the healing process," Hauh said. Some -but not all -of the play's performers are vic­tims of sexual violence or know individuals who have been, Raub said. 
In pairs, Hauh and other lead organizers of "The Vagina Monologues" pre­sented their proposal for the play's production to var­ious departments in the College of Arts and Letters. 
"The girls have done a fantastic job.... They came forward with a very respon­
sible proposal that really focused on this play as an intellectu­al event from several dif­ferent per­spectives," Schurr said. "For [the anthropology department], 
the  interest  
was  that they  
had  one  

panel specifi­
tent in life. That's one of the 
things we should be doing 
as a university." 
The event, though contro­versial, will "spark impor­tant discussions about important topics and issues that will benefit the commu­nity" especially with the inclusion of different aca­demic perspectives, McVeigh said. 
Students participating in the V-Day campaign are asked to fulfill two criteria in order to perform the "Monologues" on their cam­pus: It must be performed on campus and raise money for local anti-violence organizations. 
The Notre Dame produc­tion has been granted an exception for not fulfilling those criteria. Jenkins' decision prohibited such events from raising money on campus. Raub is still finalizing which DeBartolo classroom the play will be performed in. 
"The Vagina Monologues" has a purpose and place at Notre Dame as long as "new intellectual information can be brought to bare" every year, Schurr said. 
He likened it to a produc­tion of Shakespeare's "Hamlet" or an elective course at Notre Dame ­they are rarely presented annually in order to ensure that students are always engaging fresh material. 
"If !the 'Monologues'] did change every year," he said, "I could see having it every year. If it didn't change much, I think it would be perfectly reasonable to have it less frequently."

Al-Qaida training militants in Pakistan 
WASHINGTON -Al-Qaida, increasingly tamped down in Iraq, is establishing cells in other countries as Osama bin Laden's organi­zation uses Pakistan's tribal region to train for attacks in Afghanistan, the Middle East, Africa and the United States, the U.S. intelligence chief said Tuesday. 
"Al-Qaida remains the pre-eminent threat against the United States," Mike McConnell told a Senate hearing more than six years after the Sept. 11 attacks. 
McConnell said that fewer than 100 al-Qaida terrorists have moved from Iraq to establish cells in other countries as the U.S. military clamps down on their activities, and the organ­ization "may deploy resources to mount attacks outside the country." 
McConnell said while the level of violence in Iraq has dropped sharply since last year, it is going to be years before Iraq is stable. 
"It is not going to be over in a year. It's going to be a long time to bring it to closure," he said.

Tensions rise between Sunnis, U.S. 
BAGHDAD -The U.S. military faced com­plaints Tuesday from its Sunni allies over claims that more civilians had been killed by American forces -amplifying tensions as the Pentagon tries to calm anger over an airstrike last week that claimed innocent lives. 
The disputes have further strained ties with anti-al-Qaida fighters considered cru­cial in turning the tide against extremist vio­lence. 
The latest deaths occurred when U.S. sol­diers -acting on tips -stormed a squat, mud-brick house in the village of Adwar, 10 miles south of Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit. The predominantly Sunni area is home to many former members of Saddam's regime, and has been the frequent site of American raids. 


Israel retaliates, kills 8 Hamas militants 
GAZA CITY -Israel killed eight Hamas militants Tuesday, firing missiles into the sandy courtyard of a Barnas police station as the Islamic militant group claimed responsi­bility for a bold strike inside Israel, the first suicide mission in over a year. 
The latest round of violence followed two weeks of anarchy on the Gaza-Egypt border that has heightened Israeli concerns that Islamic militants could use the chaos to infil­trate into Israel to carry out attacks.

State drops plan to privatize hospitals 
INDIANAPOLIS -The Family and Social Services Administration has dropped a plan to privatize three state hospitals, throwing new uncertainty into its future care for chronically mentally ill patients. 
Less than five months after FSSA Secretary Mitch Hoob told a state panel that a federal audit showed Indiana need­ed a new way of delivering care to chroni­cally mentally ill patients, he has ended negotiations with a group vying to take over Richmond State Hospital. 
Hoob for the past 2 years maintained that the best way for the hospitals to remain open decades from now was for local nonprofits to take over their opera­tions. However, in a Jan. 24 letter to the leader of the Richmond group, he said the slate needed to revamp its system of care for mental patients. 
McCain seizes GOP command 

No end in sight for Democratic race; Clinton takes Calif., Obama still alive 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -Sen. John McCain seized com­mand of the race for the Republican presidential nomination early Wednesday, winning dele­gate-rich primaries from the East Coast to California. Democratic rivals Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama traded victories in an epic struggle with no end in sight. 
Clinton won Super Tuesday's biggest state, California, in the Democratic campaign, capitalizing on backing from Hispanic vot­ers. Obama fashioned victo­ries in Alabama and Georgia on the strength of black sup­port. 
McCain's own victory in the Republican race in the Golden State dealt a crush­ing blow to his closest pur­suer, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Homney. 
"We've won some of the biggest states in the coun­try," McCain told cheering supporters at a rally in Phoenix, hours before California made his Tuesday Super. An underdog for months, he proclaimed him­self the front-runner at last, and added. "I don't really mind it one bit."

IN BRIEF Stocks fall as investors sense recession 
NEW YORK -Wall Street plunged Tuesday, driving the Dow Jones industrials down 370 points after investors saw an unexpected contrac­tion in the service sector as evidence the economy is sinking into recession. It was the Dow's biggest percentage drop in almost a year. 
The volatility that pummeled stocks in January returned with the news that the service sector shrank last month for the first time since March 2003. The report from the Institute for Supply Management wiped out the nascent optimism about the economy that had sent stocks surging higher last week. 
"The report drives a nail into the coffin from investors' minds that we're in a recession," said Todd Salamone, director of trading at Schaeffer's Investment Research. "That doesn't mean stock prices in the months ahead will be lower. But when you see headline numbers like this, there tends to be a reactionary sell." 

Treasury watching global markets 
WASHINGTON-U.S. and global financial mar­kets are continuing to adjust to a period of pro­longed turmoil and the Bush administration is closely monitoring developments, two top Treasury Department officials said Tuesday. 
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, testifying before the Senate Finance Committee, said the administration has been closely watching capital markets since a severe credit crisis hit in August, roiling markets around the globe. 
"While we are in a difficult transition period as markets reassess and re-price risk, I have great confidence in our markets," Paulson told the com­mittee. "They have recovered from stressful peri­ods in the past and they will again." 
Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will be in Tokyo this weekend for a meeting of finance ministers and central bank presidents from the Group of Seven major indus­trial nations. 
David McCormick, the department's undersec­retary for international affairs, said that the mar­ket turmoil would be a top item on the discussion agenda at the Saturday meeting among the G-7 countries. Those nations are the United States, Japan, Germany. Britain, France, Italy and Canada.

Service sector shrinks in January 
Decline the first of its kind since 2003; observers surprised; recession feared 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -For the first time in almost five years, the nation's services sector -including restau­rants, travel, banking, con­struction and retail -con­tracted in January, stoking rising worries of a recession. 
The Institute for Supply Management's report, released Tuesday, shook the stock market while bond prices surged. The Dow Jones industrial average, the Standard & Poor's 500 index and the Nasdaq composite index all fell. 
"This is an absolute col­lapse of this index," said Nigel Gault, chief U.S. econ­omist at Global Insight. 
The Institute for Supply Management reported that its new composite index measuring the health of the service sector was 44.6 in January. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while below 50 indicates contrac­tion. ISM introduced the composite index on Tuesday. 

ISM's measure of non­manufacturing business activity fell to 41.9 in January from a revised reading of 54.4 in December. Economists surveyed by Thomson Financial!IFR had expected a slight slowdown but had still forecast growth, and during that recession, prices, and worries over cutbacks in less-essential with a median estimate for the index hung around 48 or inflation and the housing spending has dragged down the index of 53. 49 -several points higher market. such segments as arts and

Administration defends Bush's budget 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -Top administra­tion officials were on Capitol Hill Tuesday defending President Bush's $3.1 trillion budget plan from com­plaints by Democrats that it adds almost $800 billion to U.S. debt and doesn't pay for the war in Iraq. 
Democrats on two Senate panels tossed brickbats at Bush's budget and some key Republicans criticized it as well as lawmakers made it plain that they would ignore the president's proposals to cut Medicare and Medicaid spending. 
At the Senate Budget Committee, White House budget chief Jim Nussle put in a combative perform­ance, returning criticism of Bush's budget with attacks on lawmakers for not fully funding his long-pend­ing war request and challenging them to join Bush in curbing the rapid growth of benefit programs. 
Senate Budget Chairman Kent 
Conrad, D-N.D., slammed the budget for piling $7 61 billion in debt onto the government's books, both in bonds held by investors at home and abroad and IOUs in the Social Security trust funds. 
"The debt has done nothing under this president's watch but skyrock­et," charged Conrad. 
"Then let's open up mandatory spending," Nussle shot back, refer­ring to the spiraling growth of bene­fit programs like Medicare. 
Top panel Republican Judd Gregg of New Hampshire again criticized the Bush blueprint for having "some serious flaws from the standpoint of accuracy and even more serious flaws from the standpoint of policy." But he also attacked Democrats for assuming phony revenue boosts when passing a congressional budg­et plan last year. 
A few floors below, at the Finance Committee, with jurisdiction over taxes and Medicare, the atmosphere was more sedate, but the Bush budget plan wasn't faring any bet­ter. 

"A good budget must be realistic," Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., said at a hearing featuring Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. Baucus, Finance Committee chairman, said key aspects of the Bush budget ­proposed cuts in health programs, making Bush's tax cuts permanent and omitting war costs in predicting a budget surplus by 2012 -failed that test. 
The top Republican on the panel, Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, chid­ed the administration for not consid­ering the costs of adjusting the alternative minimum tax in future years and acknowledged that peo­ple's attention was already shifting to the next administration. "The focus is not going to be on the presi­dent's budget. The focus is going to be on what the next president will d0.,

Are they nuts? 237 students returned from Christmas to go into training for the Bengal Bouts. In addition to endless push­ups, sit-ups, running, etc., they invite the rearrangement of their own facial land­
scapes. Charles Rice 
No, they are not crazy. Let me tell you why. A family 

of four among the Right or Wrong ultra-poor served by the Holy Cross missions in Bangladesh would live for at least a week on the $3.87 we casually drop for a latte at Starbuck's. In 2007, the Bouts contributed $60,000 to those mis­sions. The Holy Cross Brothers had run a boxing program at Notre Dame in the mid-1920s, but the Bengal Bouts began in 1931, with all proceeds going to the mis­sions as they have every year since then. Bangladesh has 140 million people in a country the size of Iowa. It is 88.3 percent Muslim, 10.5 percent Hindu and 0.3 per­cent Christian. The per capita annual income is $1,470. Holy Cross missionaries came there in 1854. There are 145 Holy Cross priests, seminarians and brothers (133 of them Bangladeshi) and 70 Holy Cross sisters there. They run two colleges, eight high schools and 10 parishes as well as other apostolates. In addition to politi­cal violence and corruption. they have to deal with the effects of Cyclone Sidr last November 15, which killed at least 5,000 people, injured 40,000, destroyed or dam­aged 1.2 million homes and 1.6 million acres of cropland and killed 1 million live­stock. The missions depend on the Bengal Bouts, according to Father Tom Smith of the Holy Cross Mission Center. The needs are basic: sanitation, clean water, safe shelter, electricity, etc. In Khalippur Parish, 20 villages of poor tribal people need for each village a latrine, costing $25 each and a tube well at $150 each. St. Joseph the Worker Parish in Srimangal needs to repair seven one­room primary schools of mud-wall or bamboo construction with tin roofs. A pri­mary school hostel for forty boys (kinder­
garten through grade five) needs a roof 
and benches. The only way students from 
remote villages can get an education is to 
live in those primitive hostels. 
Space limits prevent mention of many other urgent needs. But the next time you interview for a job after graduation, give a thought to Holy Cross Parish in Dhaka which needs to hire a full-time teacher­catechist to work among the Telegu, a people of the lowest caste, many of whom are joining the Church. The teacher's annual salary will be $1,000. 
The participants in the Bouts take their purpose seriously. The program, under the sponsorship of Rich O'Leary and Dave Brown of RecSports, is run by the officers of the Boxing Club, president Hunter Land and captains Jesse Brawer, Patrick O'Brien, Patrick Ryan, Lawrence Sullivan, Michael Lee, Leo Rubinkowski, Mark Weber and Andres VIllalba. "We run a tough program," Hunter Land said, "but the rewards are great, including the camaraderie and friendships and espe­cially the certainty that we are helping those who need it most." 
The toughness of the program is largely the doing of Tom Suddes, a Columbus developer who runs practices guaranteed to reduce the number of participants. Tom describes the practices as "character building." Those who survive tend to agree. 'The boxing alumni," notes Tom, "say that what they remember above all about Notre Dame is the Bengal Bouts and the resulting friendships." Tom and the other head coaches -Chicago attor­ney Terry Johnson and University pilot Pat Farrell-are former Bengal champs and volunteer their time. The assistant coach­es include Sweet C. Robinson of the Buchanan Police Department, former boxers Ryan Rans, Chip Farrell, Thad Naquin, Judge Roland Chamblee and Father Brian Daley. Jimmy Rogers, of RecSports, doubles as coach and supervi­sor. 
The emphasis is on safety, with no seri­ous injuries in 77 years. Dr. Jim Moriarty, the University physician and his staff, keep that record going with strict testing and safety rules. Emergency Medical 
Technician Terri Engel attends every 
sparring session along with EMTs Eva 
Chu, Baker Jones, Jordan Lacy, Wayne 
Bishop, and Gordon Martinzak of the 
Notre Dame Fire Department. 
If you think that no one is indispensable, let me introduce you to the student man­agers, Melanie Rodarte, Meghan O'Farrell, Kelly Garvey, Ac;hley Mensch and Katherine Johnston. They maintain the financial, sparring, Pquipment and other records. They organize, thPy solve problems and they leave no doubt in any­one's mind that if they faltered, thP opera­tion would dPscend into chaos. They share the viPw expressed by MPlanie when asked why she gives so much time to this. "One word," she said. "Bangladesh. When I graduate, I want to know that I did something special here that helped real people in real need." 
The Bouts will be held in four sessions, all in the Joyce CentPr: Feb. 25 and 28 at 6:30p.m., March 11 at 7:00p.m. and the finals on March 14 at 7:30p.m. The first two sessions will havP two rings opPrating simultaneously. A "season ticket," at $10, will admit you to all sessions. Admission on Feb. 25, the preliminaries, is free. 
One final word, from Father Louis Cruge, who runs the Nevin Clinic for the Sick Poor in Dhaka: "So many sick people are coming to us from the city slum area, the budget is always in the red. Most expensive is our care for cancer patients. We never have enough to care for all the sick who come. The patients can offer very little. Please pray for us so that we can do something good for the poor and needy sick people and show God's kind­ness and mercy to them." 
Please support the Bengal Bouts. They are fun to watch. And they are one of the very best things we do at Notre Dame.

The incredible story of 2008 thus far and not likely to be dethroned in terms of newswarthiness unless an event of overwhelming importance transpires in the next 11 months, presidential can­didates Barack Jed Pressgrove Obama and Hillary Clinton hugged. The Reflector 
Politicians rarely hug. As we know, they are not normal people. And normal people hug quite a bit. Appropriately in stores and inappro­priately in church. 
These candidates, in fact, are more like bears. Both are ferocious, and both will leave you alone if you play dead. You could think of delegates as skittish salmon. (I would be skittish too if two hunky bears like Hillary and Barack were after me.) Yet again, even a.s an easy comparison can be drawn between these officials and

bears, we see the same delineation. Bears hug, politicians don't. 
After drilling into my brain for answers, something told me politi­cians embrace for reasons akin to those of large mammals that lust after honey, run at surprisingly high speeds and protect their families swift-paw. 
My understanding of the academic literature on bears hugging is admit­tedly limited. Still, persistent thought and reading have led me to three rea­sons to share, three reasons that bears hug. 
As we move from reason to reason, I will evaluate whether these are plau­sible explanations for the warm dis­play of these two politicians. 
First, bears have reported in several surveys that they hug to crush the bones of humans. One researcher, Frances Skalayhew, probed a commu­nity of bears on why its members dis­mantle human anatomy in this way. The reason given? Unfocused anger. 
I suppose this theory is somewhat credible. We have seen both Hillary and Barack deface the other in recent news. Perhaps they wanted to crush human bones because of unfocused anger. Neither was strong enough­or unfocusedly angry enough -to do this, so scratch that possibility. 
Second, researchers have discovered at least 25 bear religions (as opposed to bare religions, such as the Christian Nudists). In seven of these religions, hugging is a ritual believed to build kind habit and informed doctrine. For a bear, kind habit is spraying insecti­cide for the community. Informed doc­trine is defecating into a river. 
I doubt this possibility, frankly. Neither candidate could ever be privy to the technique involved in poison spraying. I also doubt either would be willing to defecate in a river or able to recognize one, whichever comes first. 
Third, research has established a theory where bears hug each other to

display affection. This affection can be genuine or pageantry, planned or spontaneous, heartwarming or awk­ward. In this way, bears are like humans. 
Having established politicians are not normal people and as this final reason links the behavior of bears to that of normal people, I reject this notion. 
So unfortunately, despite promise. and a well-oiled theoretical engine, I cannot say the obvious connection between politicians and bears can illustrate why Hillary and Barack wrapped their suit-clad bodies around each other.

A compelling argument for McCain 
After eight long years under President Bush, there's hardly a face in the Republican field that wouldn't represent a welcome departure from the status quo. Among these candidates, however, Sen. 
John Mc~ain stands Staff Editorial 
out for his pragma­tism and political courage. The Daily 
In years of public Californian service, McCain has repeatedly taken bold stances unpopular within his own party, reaching across the aisle to like­minded Democrats in the process. 
His work on campaign finance reform demonstrated real bipartisan leadership, and we applaud his unequivocal opposition to the use of torture on terror suspects. 
In calling for the closure of the facilities at Guantanamo Bay he takes a position even many Democrats find too hard to market, giving us some hope that he has the backbone to salvage the rotting remains of U.S. moral authority abroad. 
The senator's staunch defense of the war in Iraq -occasionally bordering on out­right enthusiasm -is unsettling to those who found the venture misguided from the get-go. That said, his position is typical of the Republican candidates, and we can at least trust McCain as a veteran and former POW to prioritize the best interests of U.S. troops when formulating military strategy. 
In the realm of economic policy and on social issues such as abortion we have additional disagreements with the senator -and every other viable Republican in the race. But our concern is mitigated by the reasonable belief that as president McCain would respect the limits of the office, allow­ing the legislature and judiciary to provide the input Bush has consistently ignored, manipulated and suppressed. 
Mitt Romney's history of growing busi­nesses and bridging the party divide is appealing given the impending economic downturn. Unfortunately, it is accompanied by an equally lengthy record of complete reversals on a range of issues, indicating a shallowness and political opportunism that make McCain seem all the more appealing. 
As for Mike Huckabee -his tendency to confuse the Bible for the Constitution rules him out as potential leader of a country whose diversity and international commit­ments demand a far broader ideological understanding. 
We are wary of the some of the senator's policy preferences, but deeply respect his character and record of principled argu­ment. 
Vote McCain for Republican nominee for president.

higHlights slate of new shows 
NEW BREED OF HIGH-POWERED WOMEN NAVIGATE "LIPSTICK JUNGLE" 
By CASSIE BELEK Assistant Scene Editor 

Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha are the women of the past as "Sex and the City" grows up in Wendy, Nico and Victory of "Lipstick Jungle"-the new hour-long NBC series based ofl' of Candace Bushnell's book of the same name. The show's promos say it all: They're not looking lor Mr. Big. They are Mr. Big. 
"Lipstick Jungle," which premieres Thursday at 10 p.m., follows three high-powered New York City women as they balance family, friendship and careers. It goes beyond "Sex and the City" as it focuses less on the politics of sex and more on the everyday struggles of working women. Brooke Shields stars as movie exec­utive Wendy Healy, Kim Haver stars as editor in chief Nico Heilly and Lindsay Price stars as fashion designer Victory Ford. Much like in "Sex and the City," the cen­tral component of the show is the characters' friend­ship, something they lean on to get through just about everything. "Lipstick Jungle" is a departure from "Sex and the City" yet it still draws inspiration from its pred­ecessor. 
"The women are a little older, a little wiser but sort of equally as flawed," NBC development executive and Notre Dame alumna Katie O'Connell said by phone Monday. O'Connell, who developed recent dramas "Chuck" and "Bionic Woman," convinced Bushnell to bring "Lipstick Jungle" to NBC. "I knew Candace and I had read her book over the summer and I loved it and I thought that it lent itself so cleanly to a television series," O'Connell says. 
O'Connell got the ball rolling on the series two and half years ago when she started a development depart­ment for NBC in New York City. After hearing that Bushnell had almost closed a deal with another net­work, O'Connell sent the "Sex and the City" author a giant basket of lipsticks and had a fortuitous run-in 
· with her at fashion designer Cynthia Rowley's wedding. In the end, O'Connell convinced Bushnell that NBC was the network for "Lipstick .Jungle." 
Bushnell isn't the only big name attached to the proj­ect. The most notable leading lady is Shields, the popu­lar star who had another series with NBC in the late 1990s -"Suddenly Susan." O'Connell first met with the actress about "Lipstick Jungle" whon she was star­ring as Roxie Hart in "Chicago" on Broadway. By the time the show was ready to cast li1r the pilot, Shinlds was pregnant, but thanks to the pushing back of pro­duction, she was able to do the series all.er all. 
"She's always loved the book and she's always been kind of the prototype li1r us lor the Wendy charaeter," O'Connell says of Shields. 
O'Connell also praises executive producer Timothy Busfield, who has aetnd in series such as "30-some­thing" and "The West Wing" and is a co-executive pro­ducer of both "Without a Trace" and "Ed." "I think he's really captured a tone that I haven't seen in television in a long time," she says. It's a tone that Buslield has said he brings from "30-something" and it's a tone that, according to O'Comwll. sets "Lipstick Jungle" apart from new ABC rival "Cashmern Malia." 
The two series have already drawn endless compar­L<>ons even as they try to set themselves apart from one another. "Cashmere Mafia" comes from the creative mind of Darren Star, who ereated a cultural juggernaut with Bushnell in IIBO's "Sex and the City." O'Connell recognizes that the shows are rather similar on the surface, but she adds: "Our cast is completely dill'erent. our tone is a little bit mon~ grounded and it feels a little bit more relatable." 
As an NBC executive, O'Connell says that she relates to the struggles of the characters in the show. which she says is one of the reasons that she has been so involved in the development of the series. 
"What we've endeavored to do is really explore for each character a robust personal life and a robust pro­fessional life," she says. Wendy, Nico and Victory get through their professional and personal lives in each episode through the stnmgth of their friendship. "It's really a celebration of successful women and the bene­fits that come with and also the challenges that come with. that," O'Connell says. 
Starting tomorrow, three new fashionistas will navi­gate the jungle of New York City with careers, friends and family, and they'll do it wearing perfect lipstick and stiletto heels. They just won't need Mr. Big.

"It was great to be able to tell them what I've been saying all along -that I've never used steroids or growth hormone," the seven-time Cy Young Award winner and former New York Yankee said. 
Clemens, wearing a pin­striped gray suit, did not take questions from reporters. Carrying a black briefcase and accompanied by two attor­neys, Clemens headed to an elevator to exit the building. 
Someone down the mar­ble hallway at the Rayburn House Office Building yelled out the pitcher's nickname, "Rocket!" That drew a quick wave of a hand from Clemens as he stepped into the wood-paneled ele­vator.

IN BRIEF Arkansas asks NCAA to let 
Mallett play in '08 
FAYETIEVIllE, Ark. -Arkansa<; will ask the NCAA to allow transfer quarter­back Ryan Mallett to play immediately for the Razorbacks without sitting out a year. 
Mallett transferred from Michigan after Rich Rodriguez replaced retiring coach Uoyd Carr. 
"After visiting with Ryan and his par­ents, we feel that it is appropriate to file a waiver in this ca<;e based on extenuat­ing circumstances," Arkansas athletic director Jeff Long said in a release. "While the outcome of the waiver request is uncertain, we feel strongly that as an institution we should offer our full support to Ryan and his family in this process." 
The 6-foot-7 Mallett, who played in 11 games for the Wolverines last year, has three years of eligibility remaining. Mallett appears well suited to a pro-style offense, but Rodriguez's offense works well with a more mobile quarterback. 
eighth in major league his­tory with 354 career wins. He put off retirement yet again in 2007, returning to the Yankees in June and going 6-6 with a 4.18 ERA. 
His closed-door, sworn testimony on Capitol Hill came one day after his Yankees teammate and workout partner, Andy Pettitte, gave a deposition to committee staff for 2? hours. 
Both players' interviews are part of preparation for a Feb. 13 hearing, a public session expected to focus on allegations made in the Mitchell report by their former trainer, Brian McNamee. McNamee said that he injected Clemens 
more than a dozen times with human growth hor­mone and steroids in 1998, 2000 and 2001. 
"I look forward to being here, I guess in this room, next week," Clemens said in his 25-second statement after the deposition. 
He has chosen various ways to strongly deny what McNamee said, including a taped TV interview, a live news con­ference and, repeatedly, through his lawyers. 
Tuesday's deposition was the first time Clemens addressed the allegations under oath -meaning it also was the first time he faced legal risk if he were to make false statements. 
Packers sign McCarthy to 
five-year contract 
GREEN BAY, Wis. -The Green Bay Packers signed coach Mike McCarthy on Tuesday to a five-year contract that runs through the 2012 season. 
"We have accomplished some of our goals over the past two seasons, but there remains much left to be done," McCarthy said in a statement. "I am excited by the opportunity to meet those challenges and someday return another Lombardi Trophy home to Green Bay." 
McCarthy, who had a year left on his original three-year deal, report­edly agreed in principle last month to the new contract, which is worth about $4 million per season. 
"Mike brings tremendous passion, work ethic and structure to his posi­tion," general manager Ted Thompson said. "These are the traits we saw in him when he was hired, and we're very happy for the success we have had under his guidance." 
Pats' Anderson pleads not 
guilty to possessiOn 
LOWELL, Mass. -New England Patriots defensive back Willie Andrews pleaded not guilty to drug possession Tuesday, hours after authorities said they found him with a half-pound of marijuana. 
Andrews was charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and driving an unregistered motor vehi­cle. Prosecutors said he had $6,800 in cash, three bags of marijuana, and no means to smoke the drugs. 
According to authorities, Lowell police responded to an anonymous caller who reported possible drug activity in a black motor vehicle. Police later pulled over the car, and when they approached it, detectives smelled a strong odor they believed to be marijuana, District Attorney Gerry Leone said. 
Andrews was released on personal recognizance after entering not guilty pleas during his arraignment in Lowell District Court.

NFL 

Giants celebrate Super Bowl win with parade 
Associated Press 

NEW YOHK -On a day for jumping and whooping it up, Michael Strahan showed the throngs of jubilant fans just how it's donn, New York Giants style. 
The star defensive end fires up his team -a wildly improbable NFL champion -with a leap that he calls "stomping you out." And with that, Strahan jumped skyward on the podium at a Sup1~r Bowl rally Tuesday, lifting his krwes to his shoulders. 
"We would like to extend this to every other team in the NFL and particularly for tlw last team we defeated, the New England Patriots," he said. his teammates standing behind him. "Because you know what we did to you? We stomped you out!" 
Two days after the Giants won the title with a 17-14 victory that ended the Nnw England Patriots' perfect season, fans gathered at City llall Park after a ticker-tape parade to watch their team get the keys to the city. 
And those fans, umbrellas raised in a light rain, made a plea to Strahan, who is contem­plating retirement. "One more ynar!" came the chant as soon as hn got to the podium. 
':Or~e ~ore ~ear?" Strahan s<ud. We II see. 
Eli Manning, the MVP of the Super Bowl, said the team was proud to "bring the champi­onship back to New York City." 
"It's b1~en an unbelievable jour­ney," he said. 
Manning and Strahan were joined by the entire Giants organization in a parade through the "Canyon of Heroes" before hundreds of thousands of fans, many decked out in Giants blue, to celebrate one of the city's great sports triumphs. 
After the Manhattan lovefest, the team took buses back to New Jersey, where it was met by a crowd of more than 20,000 fans at Giants Stadium. The crowd saved its loudest cheers for coach Tom Coughlin, who emerged from a tunnel holding aloft the Super Bowl trophy. 
"You believed in us and this group of young men believed in themselves," he said. "And that's why we're standing here today." 
The crowd burst into cheers when wide receive David Tyree was introduced and pressed a football to his head, simulating his astonishing catch in the final minutes of Sunday's game. 
State Senate President Hichard 
J. Codey took a jab at the Patriots when he referred to their video­taping scandal at Giants Stadium against the Jets in September. 
"If the Patriots were here today, they could film all they want," Codey said. 
Earlier, across the Hudson Hiver, the Giants rode in floats and many players carried video cameras to record the moment. A huge cheer went up when Manning joined Strahan at the front of a float. The float also carried Mayor Michael Bloomberg as well as the Vince Lombardi Trophy, which was cradled like a baby in Strahan's massive arms. 

"I've never ever played with a bigger group of goofballs than this group here," Strahan said. "And you know what? We won the Super Bowl!" 
Bloomberg gave team officials and players keys to the city after the festivities. Gov. Eliot Spitzer and Sen. Charles Schumer were among the politicians joining Bloomberg at City Hall. 
'The Giants may not be perfect but no one is, at least not this year in the NFL," Bloomberg said, taking a shot at the Patriots' 18-1 season. 
Schumer said: "Now the Giants aren't just New ¥ork's team, they're America's team." 
Coughlin thanked the city for the outpouring of enthusiasm. 
"That parade and that show of loyalty and the response to our championship season is just something we'll remember for the rest of our lives," he said. 
While it dearly was a day for a parade, it was also a day for poli­tics: New York and the 23 other Super Tuesday states were hold­ing primaries. 
Near City Ilall, signs for Democratic candidate Barack Obama were surrounded by fans wearing Giants red, white and blue. Spitzer told the crowd he had written in Coughlin for his presidential pick, with Manning for vice president.

NBA 

Cavs continue hot play -with -win over Celtics 
Associated Press 
CLEVElAND-LeBron James scored 33 points and barely missed a triple-double as the Cleveland Cavaliers beat Boston for the second time this season, downing the Celtics 114-113 on Tuesday night. 
.lames added 12 assists. nine rebounds and live steals to pace the Cavaliers, who improved to 1 !i-4 sincn Dec. 25 and handed the NBA's best road team just its fifth loss away from home. Cleveland also beat the Cclties in overtime on Nov. 27. 
For a change, James, who leads the league in fourth-quar­ter scoring, didn't have to do it all by himself' down the stretch. 
Zydrunas Ilgauskas added 21 points, Larry llughes had 1 X and seldom-us!HI Ira Newble had I !i for Cleveland. Also, guard Daniel Gibson made a big stmtl in the final minutP to help tlw Cavs hang on. 
Hay Allen scored 24 points and Paul Pierce 19 for the Celties, who were again without KPvin Garnett. The All-Star center missed his fourth straight game with an abdomi­nal strain sustained on Jan. 25, and is likely to sit out Friday's game in Minnesota, his first visit back there since the Timberwolves traded him to Boston last summer. 
For three quarters, a matchup betwnnn two of the East's top teams looked more like one between two up-and­down Western Conference teams as defensn was scarce. But with the gamn on the line in the fourth quarter, both teams tightened things up. 
The Celtics pulled to 97-96 before James drained a 3-point­er and drove the lane before feeding Ilgauskas for a dunk. Gibson then· scored on a circus­like scoop shot in the lane and James hit a jumpm to put the Cavs up 106-<JS with 4:43 left. 
Boston, though, quickly cut it to two as Kendrick Perkins scored on a three-point play and Pierce drained a 3. 
Hajon Hondo made a jumper and two free throws as the Ccltics pulled within 110-108 with 1:4S remaining. But on Cleveland's next possession, Boston's defense was so con­cerned about stopping James that the Celtics let Newble, who needed four stitches to close a gash over his right eye in the first half, .drive the baseline for a dunk. 
Pierce's basket got Boston within two. and the Celtics had a chance to tic it but Gibson stripped Hondo and llgauskas made two free throws with 1C1.6 seconds left to put Cleveland ahead 114-110. 
James Posey dropped a 3­pointer for Boston at the horn to close the scoring. 
Already playing without Sasha Pavlovic (sprained foot) and Anderson Varcjao (sprained ankle), the Cavaliers lost forward Drew Gooden early in the third with a strained right groin. 
Gooden hurt himself while crashing the boards, grabbing a rebound and dunking over an unsuspecting Allen. 
NCAA BASKETBALL 
Lawson likely out for UNC 
Speedy sophomore on crutches with sprained ankle for Duke game 
Associated Press 

CHAPEL HILL, N.C. -Roy Williams went to the training room Tuesday morning to see how point guard Ty Lawson was recovering from a sprained left ankle. The answer was enough to give the North Carolina coach reason for con­cern. 
"lie walked in the trainer's room on crutches," Williams said, "and. I think it's awfully diflicult to go from crutches one day to playing against Duke the next day." 
Lawson's status has become the biggest variable in the latest matchup of college basketball's most intense rivalry. With a healthy Lawson, the third­ranked Tar Heels can run with their typical zeal and better handle the second-ranked Blue Devils' perimeter pressure. If the speedy sophomore is limit­ed or can't play at all, North Carolina will be a different team. 
Lawson was hurt about four minutes into Sunday's 84-73 overtime win at Florida State and dido't return. lie missed practice Monday and was unavailable for comment before Tuesday's practice because he was ·receiving treatment. Afterward, team spokesman Steve Kirschner said Lawson was unable to participate in team drills and managed only some light shooting on his own while wearing an air cast, though he has not been ruled out. 
It is the second time this sea­son Lawson's ankles have been a hot topic leading up to a game. He sat out at Ohio State in November after spraining his right ankle against BYU in the Las Vegas Invitational. 
But this time, the Tar Heels (21-1, 6-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) have less depth to handle it. Heserve Bobby Frasor, who started against the Buckeyes and could play both guard positions, was lost to a season-ending knee injury in December. 
That leaves the Tar Heels with senior Quentin Thomas, a career reserve and the only active player remaining from the 2005 NCAA championship team. He would likely inherit the starting role if Lawson is out with junior swingman Marcus Ginyard also to see time at point against the Blue Devils (19-1, 7-0). 
"For me personally, it's being ready for anything," said Thomas, who had a career-high nine points to go with six assists in 36 minutes against the Seminoles. "And whenever my time is to go out there for the game, I just have to be pre­pared.... Whether it's 36 min­utes or 2 minutes, I just need to do what it takes." 
Either way, both teams sound ready to run in a matchup of two of the nation's top ofl'enses. North Carolina ranks second nationally in scoring at 91 points per game, while Duke ranks third at S5.7. Duke eoach Mike Krzyzewski is preparing his team as though Lawson will play at full strength. 
"I just think it's tough to keep any kid out of this game, from either side," Krzyzewski said.

No. 5 Belles set to host rival Alma 
Team hopes to pick up second straight conference victory 
By MEAGHAN VESELIK Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's broke is MIAA losing streak Saturday with a 10-point victory over Adrian College. The Belles will look to continue their success against conference rival Alma tonight. The fifth-place Belles (5-6 MIAA, 9-10 overall) kick off a stretch of five home games when they play the Scots at 
7:30 in the Angela Athletic Center. 
Losing three consecutive conference games wasn't the statement Saint Mary's wanted to make to the rest of the MIAA during the last three weeks. After losses to third-place Calvin and the nation's No. 1 Division III team, Hope, Saint Mary's lost its third contest in a row to Olivet Jan. 30. 
Against Adrian, the Belles came back in the second period after being down 31­28 at the half. The Belles shot 42.3 percent for the half, with junior Erin Newsom scoring 10 points in the first seven minutes of play. Katie Rashid, another junior, chipped in eight points in the half and 14 overall. 
"I thought our team played a great second half against Adrian on Saturday," Belles coach Jenn Henley said. "And I am expecting to build upon that performance as we face Alma." 
The Belles' concentration is on enhancing their defense. 
"We continue to focus on improving our overall team defense while controlling the boards," Henley said. 
Saint Mary's has been out­rebounding opponents by an average margin of 41-37.4 per game. But Adrian pulled down just as many rebounds as Saint Mary's on Saturday. 
Looking ahead to its game against Alma, Henley has outlined additional goals for her team. 

"We have been working on ways to score on the inside to prepare for Alma," Henley said. "They are a strong team that will show us a lot of different looks defensively." 
This season, Saint Mary's has been scoring an average of 67.2 points per game while Alma has been aver­aging 58.5 points per con­test. 
Alma stands at seventh place in the MIAA, two spots behind Saint Mary's. In their three meetings last season, the Belles defeated the Scots by scores of 72-60, 66-58 and 66-54. 
"The game against Alma will be another great MIAA matchup," Henley said.

Recruits

involved the recruits with the inner workings of the pro­gram, informing them via e­mail with the day-to-day oper­ations of the team. 
Nearly a year ago, the Irish received their first commit­ment for this class from Mike Golic Jr., son of former Irish defensive lineman Mike Golic. They received their latest commitment from Deion Walker on Jan. 5. In between, Weis gained a _slew of top commitments, including scout.com's No. 1 tight end Kyle Rudolph, Minnesota wide receiver Michael Floyd, California quarterback Dayne Crist, Oregon defensive end Ethan Johnson, and Chicago linebacker Darius Fleming, all slated to attend Notre Dame in the fall. 
Last season, the Irish had three early enrollees -quar­terback Jimmy Clausen, run­ning back Armando Allen, and cornerback Gary Gray -who began attending the University last spring semester. This year, only one recruit, offen-sive lineman Trevor Robinson, decided to enroll early. 

Part of Weis' success recruiting this season came as a result of learning from his mistakes in the past. 
After losing multiple prospects last season just before Signing Day, Charlie Weis instituted a policy that said he would revoke scholar­ship offers from recruits who gave their verbal commit­ments to the Irish, then took scheduled visits at other schools. Hunter chose to take an official visit to Florida, and Weis subsequently revoked his scholarship offer. 
The rest remained commit­ted to Notre Dame, giving even the most despairing Irish fan hope for the future.

at this level, and hopefully in moving onto the next level. That's just the I way I play, and that's the way the game should be played ­hard and physical." 
As important as the pro­tection he provides for Irish goaltender Jordan Pearce is the role he has acquired as a mentor to freshman defenseman Teddy Huth, a second-round NIIL pick and one of Notre Dame's bud­ding stars. 
"We've become pretty good friends off the ice, which is interesting for a guy Eiv~1 years you n.ger .~ha.n 
me, Sheahan said. Its 
pretty unique having a rela­
tionship with a guy who I 
think is going to be in the 
NIII. some day. 
"lie can be a leader for years to come on this team, even as a sophomore {next yearl, and that's something I'll tell him as I'm moving on -just make sure he keeps working and carrying on the Notre Dame tradition." 
After the Irish won only five games in his freshman season, Sheahan has seen his squad's win totals more than double in each of the past two years: from five to 13 as a sophomore, to a school record 32 last sea­son. 
"We were here in that transition period, so we def­initely got to see the pro­gram transform into more of a powerhouse, nationally­prominent program," said Sheahan, one of Notre Dame's five seniors. "Our elass, along with the senior elass from last year, had a big part in changing the cul­ture of the program and the expectations of the players, and that's my biggest memo­ry." 
Those with whom he shares that memory realize both the impact Sheahan makes on a daily basis and the imprint he's put on the team and program. 

"lie's fired up every day, and he brings it in practice every single day," senior for­ward Evan Rankin said. "When you have a guy who's one of your leaders, a cap­tain, and he's coming out every single day in practice like that, it make you want to give that extra effort, too." 
As much of an impact Sheahan has had on the Notre Dame program, Jackson has returned the favor to the defenseman. 
"Ever since Coach Jackson has been here, it's been about doing all the little things to the best of your 

ability -little things in practice like doing push-ups after you miss the net," Sheahan said. "I hope to carry that over into every aspect of life, and hopefully that helps me as a person ­just doing the right things and good things will hap­pen."

The Irish, who lead the con­ference in rebounding margin, will have an advantage in the frontcourt against Seton Hall -mostly because of leading scorer Luke 1-Iarangody, 
The sopho­more forward is averaging 

things yesterday at practice," he said. "We'll probably start off in man and see what hap­pens." 
Notre Dame is 1-2 in true road games this season, although the atmosphere in Newark's Prudential Center probably won't reach the ani­mosity the Irish saw in games at Marquette, Georgetown and Villanova. 
The Prudential Center is live miles from Seton Hall's campus and is not known for being an intimidating venue. However, the game is sold out, something that rarely happened when the Pirates played at the larger Continental Airlines Arena, 14 miles from their campus. 
Note: 

High school junior Jack Cooley of Glenview, Ill., orally committed to play for Notre Dame beginning in the 2009-1 0 school year. 
Cooley, a 6-foot-8, 21 0-pound forward, has been compared to llarangody. Cooley also had scholarship offers from Illinois and Wisconsin.

Nalional Signing Day -the day din-hard fans have longed for sinen Notre Dame's season of rewrd-sntting futility began -is linally here. 
During a season that saw tho Irish start 0-4 for the 11rst limn in school history and lin­ish a dismal 3-<J, the prosp1~ct of nabbing a top-tier recruit­ing elass buoyed fans weighed down by dnprnssing perform­ances on tlw liPid.

Reports: Yeatman arrested for DWI 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Writer 

Irish tight end and lacrosse player Will Yeatman has been suspPnded indefinitPiy from both teams. 
The South Bend Tribune reported Tuesday that Yeatman had been arrested on Jan. 2R li>r operating a vehieln whiln intoxi­cated. In 2005, tho University suspended fullback Hashon Powers-Neal from extracurricu­lar aetivitios after he was arrest­ed for a similar crime in his home state of Minnesota. 
Yeatman, a rising junior, was the football team's No. 2 tight end in 2007, behind senior John Carlson. With Carlson's gradua­tion. Yeatman was expected to take over the top spot at his posi­tion. 
Rising sophomore Mike Ragone and non-scholarship ris­ing senior Kevin Brooks are the only other returning tight ends on the Irish roster. 
Notre Dame is expncted to sign two top-rated high school senior tight ends today, which is the tirst day seniors can sign binding scholarship oll'ers with schools. 
Cincinnati prospect Kyle Rudolph -ranked by analysts as the No. 1 tight end in his dass -and Joseph Fauria, of Encino. Calif., are considered solid Irish commitments.

Jackson calls Sheahan a 'w-arrior' on the ice 
By SAM WERNER Sports Writer 

As the old saying goes, you don't get a second chance to make a first impression. When he met Irish coach Jeff Jackson for the first time in May 2005, current senior defenseman and alternate captain Brock Sheahan didn't need one. 
"When I first came in here, it wasn't difficult to pick out the guys who I thought could help us build our identity as a program, and Brock was one of those guys from day one," said Jackson, who took over after Sheahan's freshman season when former coach Dave Poulin resigned. "That's because he has great intensi­ty, a great work ethic, a great desire to beeome a great player: and I could tell imme­diately that he'd be one of the guys to try to build the cul­ture around." 
Sheahan, a native of Alberta, Canada, has lived up to Jackson's lofty expecta­tions, emerging as a vocal leader, an elite blue-line defender and il gritty, hard­nosed player for the Irish. 
"lie's a warrior," Jackson said. "lie's not the biggest man, but he plays extremely big. lie has no f1~ar, he con­stantly will physically pay the price, and he's smart with the puck. 
''I'm extremely proud of Brock and what he's done, and I don't know if there's a better defensive player in the CCHA." 
Slwahan's tenadous. hard­hitting style stems in part from what he calls being a "late bloomer" -the trait that led him to Notrn Dame in the nrst place. 
"My goal was to play cDllnge hockey-I wasn't going to be playing major junior hockey back home becausn I was too small," Sheahan said. "I've learned I havn to play a hard­nosed game to be suceessful
