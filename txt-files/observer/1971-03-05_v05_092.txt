Black Studies 
The black students, with Dr. Joseph Scott in the lead, have presented a proposal to Father 
Burtchaell and Dean Corsson that recommends that the university establish a Black 
Studies 

The call for departmental status springs from acute dissatisfaction with the status quo 
program status; specifically with the inability of Dr. Scott to hire independently hire 
competent black teachers. With the present status of 'Black Studies· as a program, new 
faculty members can only be hired through the approval of other department heads. If Dr. 
Scott wishes to bring a black economist to Notre Dame, for example, that economist can, at 
present, only be hired if the chairman of the economics department includes that man in 
that department. Most importantly, since the Black Studies Program 1 possesses no in­
dependent funds, faculty salaries for black scholars come from already impoverished 
liberal arts departments: As one department chairman candidly advised Dr. Scott, "He who 
pays the piper calls the tune." 
Without independent funds, and without the ability to hire its own faculty members, the 
present Black Studies Program is essentially powerless. Dependence upon the monies and 
decisions of white department heads allows these men to control the nature and size of the 
Balck Studies Program. It is easy to understand why the black students and Dr. Scott are 
acutely dissatisfied with their present relience upon the benevolence of white department 
heads. 

Secondly, the proposal recommends that a complementary administrative structure be 
created within the University administration to server the special academic, economic, 
social, and psychological requirements of the black students. A black counselor, financial 
aid advisor. recruiter, and other black administrators are needed within the the system of 
present administration. The need for these administrators springs from the extraordinary 
difficulties that blacks face at a predominantly white-oriented university. 
Dr. Scott and the black students feel that a Fr 1 deadline for a response is 
necessary if black faculty are to be brought to a Notre Dame BlackStudies Department 
next fall. 

What will be the response of Dean Crosson and Burtchaell? The argument that the 
University cannot afford the monies to fund a Black Studies Department has already been 
offered. An above the the board description of how and where <Cotton Bowll revenues are 
spent is required to clear the air. 
Yet two things are immediately evident. First, the power to hire faculty must be tran­sferred to the Director of Black Studies. Secondly, black recruiters, counselors, and othzr administrators are necessary if Notre Dame is to be sincere to its commitment of racial equality. 
The need for Black Studies--whether as a program or as a department--should be self­
evident, for no problem plagues the spirit of this nation more than the covert and overt 
racism that has produced our festering ghettoes. Full scale academic research into these 
racist perversions is of primary importance to the future of all concerned men, black and 
white. Anything less than concerted fulfillment of the black students recommendations can stitutes that benevolent tokenism that is the thinly disguised form of much modern day racism. 

GSU Elections 
The upcoming Graduate Student Union Elections have thus far attracted no candidates for the office of President. Bill Lorimer, who presently heads up the GSU, has said that unless someone comes forward to run for presidnet, theorganization will fold. 
Such an occurence would be an unqualified disaster. Just at the point when graduate students are finally entering in the mainstream of university life and making their needs known tothe administration, their representative body is on the verge of collapse. 
A group insurance plan, a residnece hall for male graduates, and a graduate stuedent council are among the more important accomplishments of the GSU in the short time it has been in existence. It's potential is great, but if the graduate students are so diinterested that they allow ti to disppear all the work that has been done will come to naught. 
Perhaps the .. GSU has not responded to the real needs of the graduate students. If that is the case then there should be people willing to step forward and campaoign for theoffice onthe promise of major reforem. 
If the graduate students fail to respond to this then they have no one to blame but them­sieves for any unfortuante situations they may find themselfes in, in future years.

In response to public demand I feel compelled to help foster a spirit of open mindedness at Notre Dame. And I can think of no better topic on which to foster such a spirit than coeducation. 
The most intelligent thing I have heard spoken on this whole issue was the comment that it is simply not a question of absolutes. It is not true that education either with or without coeducation is "objectively" better than the opposite alternative or that one brand of education is better for all people. Some people would be better educated at a coeducational institution. Others would be better educated at all-male or all-female institutions. 
Now the case for those who prefer coeducation has been Iengthly stated by many people. The case for non-co-education is less often presented by anyone, but sit should be. It goes something like this; the primary purpose of a college education is the development of the in­tellect (as opposed to the physique or manners or whatever). The development of the intellect is not a particularly easy task under any conditions. 
Now for unmarried post-puberty males in our society the fair sex seems to exert a considerable attraction. The effect of this attraction on the development of one's intellect can vary considerably. Some people who feel very thwarted in this attraction may be distracted from their academic duties by frustration (thus the case for coeducation). On the other hand, some people may be distracted from 
academic duties by indulgence in this attraction, and this is the reason why coeducation would be less suitable for some people. 
Having established thus in-{)ne fell swoop the arguments for and against coeducation, I proceed to draw the fairly obvious conclusion: there ought to be diversity among schools-some co-ed, and some not. Instead of having a uniform system, it makes sense to foster a variety of styles of education. 
One would hardly worry about the lack of co-educational nuvuv­scyqties in our society -the trend is overwhelmingly in that direction (primarily because the co-called major universities have acceded to student pressure on the matter, and most other feel compelled to be equally progressive). But there are legitimate grounds for worrying about the availability of non-co-ed schools. 
Notre Dame has an element of tradition still. Part of that tradition 
involves being a sort of huge all-male fraternity (admittedly with 
frequent access to a nearly all-female sorority). Therefore Notre 
Dame is singularly suited to fulfill a certain necessary role in our 
educational system, and in fulfilling the role can return an aspect of 
the long-standing tradition. 
Thus my contribution to open-mindedness at Notre Dame ... 
LETTERS 

Editor: 
In reference to the article on page one of the Observer today, March 4, 1971 regarding room selection policy. I would like to call your attention to the paragraph in your article con­cerning room selection in Grace and Flanner Halls: 
"Chambers said that students will will have to be kicked out of the towers because these halls are more attractive than the other halls so fewer people want to move out. These halls also have been used 'l:IS depositories by outcasted the fact that many students have moved into these halls from other residence halls on the campus. I did not infer in any way that they were outcasts' from other halls. 
I would also like to clear up your statement that "there is a possibility of separating the room and board fee from the laundry fee is being considered". If this is being considered, I am not aware of it. The room, board and laundry fee will be one unit -as always. 
With kind wishes, I Temain

Collegiate Jazz Festival here this weekend 
"Jazz rocks , That's what the eo le from the Coliegiate Jazz Festiv~ 'ire telling us this year, and it's true, too. For that matter, rock jazzes too, and what they are trying to tell you, what I am trying to tell you, is that right here at Notre Dame there is a musical experience offered that all us little music freaks can't afford to 
pass up. 
The Collegiate Jazz Festival has come a long way since that day about four years ago when the judges refused to award a "Best Combo" prize because none of the finalist groups, in their opinion, played "music deserving of an award from the Collegiate Jazz Festival" or something like that. What they meant to say was, nobody played any JAZZ, at least jazz in the Tommy Dorsey or some equally ar­chaic sense, which is about all that many "buffs" were willing to accept at the time (and, sadly enough, at this time too, for some.) 
That "some" is in the minority now, though, and I don't think jazz has been healthier in a long time. You're not about to find the judges of this year's festival pulling one of those "but that's not jazz" moves this year. One reason is that CJF won't let them--the competition at CJF, compared to a few short years ago, is almost non-existent. But even if they "Yould let them, the problem wouldn't be hkely to appear. ~fter t~e val?' strange and fantastically mventive thmgs Leo~ Thomas ha_s done on Pharaoh Sanders kar~aan?Jewels of Tho~ght (not to m~ntwn his o~n albums), he s _not about to crmge at the sight of an electnc base.

And even if the judges were a collection of invalid refugees from the Robie Lan­scombe Rest Home, I doubt if that would phase Hank Levy, who leads the Towson State band in playing unbelievable charts that he later sends to Don Ellis ("Rock Oddyssey" and "Antea" from the 
Fillmore album, for instance, both of, which Towson previewed at last year's festival), or John Garvey, whose Illinois band goes on more State Department tours than Melvin Laird. 
All these "but nots and even ifs" mean to say that as much as your Chicago and Blook, Sweat, and Tears and Sons have been looking to jazz for the inspiration that has been creating some of the more in­ventive rock music of late, the jazz cats, too, have been looking around, and coming up with some real neat things.

they've been using them with an ingenuity and a passion that most of the rock guys never thought of. Take it from an avowed 
rock freak--there's very little in rock 
music, in any music for that matter, that 
can match the emotional intensity and 
pure-gut psych that you'll find in the best 
of big jazz bands. 
And as we see the rock guys growing up and the old jazz guys looking down benignly on the youngsters just like your grandmother doesn't understand what all the fuss over blue-jeans is about, we might hope that what we are starting to get now is a bunch of young musicians that don't give a damn if it's rock or if it's jazz or country or blues or honky-tonk piano, and that would be a good thing. Because, face it man, 4-4 E-A-B is nice to dance to, but you can't listen to it. 
What you can listen to is music by some of the country's most creative young musicians at this year's CJF. Granted, OK it was probably our guys, the rock guys, that started "looking around" first and better, but now the jazz guys are holding up their end, so buy a Gery Burton album Mld go to CJF and do your part for the Mare of music and motherhood. 

Waches in Washington Hall 
Following close on the heels of Little Foxes, the ND-SMC Theatre will present l>ark of the Moon in Washington Hall on March, 5,6,7. The second Studio Production of the season will be directed by Charles A. Ballinger a newcomer to the Drama Department. 
The action of this theatrical folk ballad centers around John, a witch boy who becomes human in order to marry the beautiful Barbara Allen, who is already carrying his child. It is set in a valley of the Smokey Mountains and none of the color of the region is lost. All the superstition simplicity and honesty of the people comes across as we watch them in their fight against the witches. The direction of the play focuses on the unreal elements including the mountain-ridge scenes with Conjur Man, Conjur Woman and the seductive wit­ches. The play is alive with in­tense drama, high comedy, song and dance. Technically, the show will be enhanced by John Colton's set design as well as be eerie lighting, mysterious music and sound effects. Period costumes were designed by Jane Shan­barger, and choreography is to be directed by Kyra Quinlan. 
Bob Urbanic will be seen as the tormented witch boy, John, whose humanness is at times too much for him. Mary Beth Fencl plays "blue-eyed Barbara Allen of the copper hair" whose fidelity to John will determine his fate. 
The play may be seen on the 5th and 6th at 8:30p.m. and on the 7th at 7:30p.m. 
In the life of a HOLY 
CROSS BRO!rlER all of these pieces fit together.

GSU President 

According to Bill Lorimer, GSU President, no candidates have yet been announced for the up­coming GSU Presidential elec­tion. If there are no candidates, the Grad Student Union will cease to exist. 
The current president says the grad students want things handed to them, but don't want to expend any effort to help the GSU. He also stated that people seem to expect the Grad Union to exist indefinitely, but warned that "We aren't going to go on forever if people don't start lending a hand." 
The Graduate Student Union no longer needs to "justify its existence," according to Lorimer, because it is only since the institution of the GSU that grad students have become a part of the University com­munity. 
While he admits that there are s still many unresolved problems facing grad students, Lorimer feels that these could be over­come, and that the only threat to the GSU's future is grad student apathy. 
If no candidate turns up for the GSU elections, the grad students will lose their representation, presently provided by the Grad Union, on the Faculty Senate, Board of Trustees, Academic and Graduate Councils, and the Advanced SHstudent Affairs Committee, as well as the Traffic Appeals Board. 
According to Lorimer, the grad students "may not miss this at first, but they will eventually miss it very much."
