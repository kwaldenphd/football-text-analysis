Weeklong vacation a welcome respite after mid-term exams 
By LAURA WILCZEK News Writer 
For students at Notre Dame, midterms week is a race to reach the semester's halfway point, with fall break as their finish llne. After cramming for the vari­ous political science, biology, organic chemistry and engi­neering exams, students are eager for the week of vaca­tion to arrive. Not all college students across the nation have a fall break, which makes the time even more precious for students. 
Laura Yamartino plans on spending her fall break at Boston College to make it all the sweeter. 
"[I'm going to Boston College] so I can make all my friends there absolutely jeal­ous," she said. 
For many students, like sophomore Monique Rangel, fall break is the perfect opportunity to relax. 
"I plan on sleeping in and spending time with my fami­ly," Rangel said. 
Travel, both international and domestic, is also a popu­lar break activity. 
Hundreds of students on campus will participate in the fall break Center for Social Concerns Seminars. The seminars allow students to travel to places like Appalachia and Washington 
D.C. while engaging in serv­ice projects.

Chazan discusses w-otnen, peace 
Professor says women crucial to peace process 
BySONIARAO 
News Writer 
Women's involvement and failure in peace movements took center stage in a lecture by professor Naomi Chazan entitled "A Comparative Look at the Role of Women in Conflict Resolution Today" Thursday at the Hesburgh Center. 
"Women are involved in every contemporary peace process I know of," said Chazan, the Provost's Distinguished Woman Lecturer. "They are active peace workers, they have pro­moted conflict resolution ... 
and they are absolutely essen­tial for peace building after the peace process has been con­cluded." 
Chazan described the salient characteristics specific to women's peace movements with several "P's," -political, pioneering, persevering, patient, passionate and prag­matic. The political nature of peace movements, Chazan argued, is essential for success. 
"If you bring antagonistic parties together and you avoid politics you are deluding your­self," she said. "These are political problems." 
Paradoxically, Chazan argued that although women are ubiq­uitous in peace processes, their influence has been "infinitesi­mal, if at all." In fact, in the major peace negotiations of the past 30 years, there have been no women present at all. After "spend[ing] hours, mostly nights trying to figure out [why peacemaking efforts aren't working]," Chazan identified five confounding factors to peace movements in general, referring to them as "five F's," including the inability to con­front failure, fear, frustration, fatigue and friction within the movements. 
Chazan also presented rea­sons as to why women specifi­cally have been unsuccessful in implementing peace, including the onset of violence, which "is primarily, not exclusively, the domain of men," as well as the general perspective that women are irrelevant and inef­

SMC students use time off to volunteer 
By KATIE KOHLER 
News Writer 

For many Saint Mary's students, fall break offers a week of relaxation and escape from college life. For others, break is a time to give back to the community through service. 
This year, over 40 women are volunteering on various service trips through the Office for Civic and Social Engagement, according to OCSE Director Carrie Call. 
Saint Mary's is sponsoring three service trips this year: the Catalyst Trip to Cincinnati, the Habitat for 
Humanity  Trip  to  St.  
Tammany  Parish  in  
Louisiana,  and  the  

Pilgrimage to Mexico. 

Students are responsible for paying for their own food, but the majority of the costs are covered by grant supports from the Center for

Not all students are lucky enough to escape South Bend or even the rigors of school

Religion to be required at Harvard 
Theology already part ofND core curriculum 
By KATHLEEN McDONNELL News Writer 
While Notre Dame students are no strangers to required classes in religion, Harvard students will face a similar requirement for the first time in quite a while -a move which brings to light the growing importance of reli­gious studies in American uni­versities. · 
On Oct. 4, CNN reported that a faculty committee recom­mendation at Harvard University proposed require­ments for undergraduates be expanded to include a course in "reason and faith." The "surprisingly bold recommen­dation," as CNN reported, aims to broaden Harvard's core curriculum, whose nar­row academic focus has been criticized in recent years. 
Notre Dame has traditionally emphasized the importance of religious inquiry in under­graduate formation, most noted in the two theology requirements undergraduates must fulfill before graduation. 
Taking into account the inclusion of religion in the core curricula of other Ivy League schools like Columbia and Dartmouth, Harvard's reintroduction of religious material seems part of a pos­sible trend amongst secular schools. 
But while Harvard's new classes include material on religion, its focus seems slight­ly different from that of a reli­

Baseball's irrelevance 
Cory Lidle, a pitcher for the New York Yankees and nine-year veteran of Major League Baseball, died Wednesday when his Cirrus SR-20 crashed into a sky­scraper in Manhattan. He was a human being. 
For the first two hours of nonstop broadcast coverage of the tragedy, the news media focused on the fear of ter­rorism and the pos­sibility of deaths in the building ­


along with the obvi- Ken Fowler  
ous question of how such a tragedy  Sports Editor  
could have occurred.  

The Associated Press had a 900-word, 27-paragraph story rrnming on its news wire at 4:50p.m.-2 hours after the accident -when word broke that Lidle was aboard the doomed flight. 
"A small plane crashed into a 50-story condominium tower Wednesday on Manhattan's Upper East Side, raining flaming debris onto the sidewalks below and rattling New Yorkers' nerves five years after the Sept. 11 attack," the story read at 4:47p.m. "Police said at least two people were killed." 
But after 10 versions of the crash story, the AP scrapped the entire article and began anew with the information about Lidle. 
Here's the entire story as of 4:57p.m. Wednesday: "A small plane with New York Yankees pitcher Cory Lidle aboard crashed into a 50-story condominium tower Wednesday on Manhattan's Upper East Side, killing at least four people, authorities said." · That was it. 
Even though the casualty numbers were the same, the fears had still been flamed and debris still lay on the side­walk near 72nd and York, the story now revolved around who and not what. 
That Cory lidle, a sports figure, was dead was more important than anything else. And it wasn't just the AP who had that thought. Reuters, CNN and even The New York Times all changed the focus on the tragedy and fear to one of the two persons killed. Here at The Observer, I fell right into that sad trap. I was trying to convince the editorial board that the story should run in the sports section instead of the news section because it involved Lidle. As I thought about it today, I realized how wrong I was. 
Whether it was Lidle and a flight instructor, a 31-year-old stock broker and his son or two sight-seeing buddies, the story should have remained the same. Two people tragically lost their lives when their plane hit an apartment build­ing-and luckily no one inside the build­ing was killed. 
But what would have been a much more dramatic story-about two people surviving the plane's impact into their apartment-was lost in the focus on Lidle. 
Buried deep in today's articles is a tale about a doctor and his wife who ran from their apartment as the plane hit their window. Dr. Parviz Benhuri and his wife survived. 
The unnecessary shift of focus might all be part of the human condition, sad as it may be. Next time, hopefully, I'll at least catch my mistake earlier.

Baker makes wife cream puff wedding dress 
UZHHOROD, Ukraine -Valentyn Shtefano's pastries were known for attracting stares and giggles as well as lip-smacking murmurs. But even his fiancee was sur­prised when Shtefano told her he was making her wed­ding dress -out of flour, eggs, sugar and caramel. 
The dress -made of 1,500 cream puffs and weighing 20 pounds -took the 28-year­old baker two months to make, and by the end of the wedding reception, bride Viktoriya said she didn't want to take it off. 
Shtefano is a rising star in the field of baking as visual art, earning him a following in this city near the border with Slovakia. His creations have generated a buzz in a place where cake is often lay­ers of heavy cream, wafers and nuts or poppy seeds ­more something to eat than to look at.

College of Science revises pre-tned advising center 
Initiative will prepare students for careers 
Special to The Observer 
Since 1943, Notre Dame has given special attention to stu­dents whose postgraduate plans included medical or den­tal school. Part of this assis­tance involved the develop­ment of preprofessional pro­grams that pair a strong but general core of science cours­es with classes in the social sciences and humanities. Another part has involved advising and assistance with applications. 
As new as the Jordan Hall of Science itself is a revised approach to preparing those students, and a new director: Rev. James Foster, C.S.C., who also is a physician. In addition to leading the preprofessional program for the College of Science, he is director of the newly named Center for Health Sciences Advising. 
This consolidated service responds to several develop­ments in the health care field. First, says Father Foster, a service that advises only med­ical and dental school appli­cants is a bit narrow in scope. What about students who want to be optometrists or physical therapists? 
Also, the process of building an application for the health services professions is becom­ing more competitive and complex. Students now are encouraged to have a summer service background or an undergraduate research expe­
rience. Future dentists are encouraged to have shadowed a practicing professional, Father Foster says. 
Now, under one roof on the second floor of Jordan, Father Foster shares office space with fellow advisors Kathleen Kolberg, Jennifer Nemecek and the undergraduate research coordinator, Michelle Whaley. Kolberg, an assistant dean of the College of Science, works with science majors who plan to attend one of the professional schools but who are forgoing the preprofes­sional program for traditional majors such as biology. Nemechek advises Arts and Letters majors. Whaley helps coordinate undergraduate research projects for College of Science majors. 
"It's like a home," Kolberg says. "It belongs to everyone who wants to go into medicine and the health professions." 
With their strong interest in service and their clear intel­lectual capacity, Notre Dame students are attractive prospects to health care pro­fessional programs. Some 80 percent of Notre Dame stu­dents who apply to medical school are accepted, com­pared to the approximate 45 percent nationally, Father Foster says. 
The task of helping students become attractive candidates over a four-year period ­candidates who combine strong academics, service and research -draws on Father Foster's skills both as a priest and a former practicing physi­cian. 


escreceives service award 
Catholic group praises center's mission work 
By RYAN SYDLIK News Writer 

Notre Dame's Center for Social Concerns (CSC) received a distin­guished award from the United States Catholic Mission Association Oct. 2 at a banquet concluding the USCMA's annual conference held at Notre Dame. 
A network of Catholic organi­zations, religious communities and laity based in Washington, D.C., the USCMA's stated pur­pose is to bring together people across the globe serving Christ through the Church. 
The award was presented to Father William Lies, executive director of the Center, and Father Don McNeill, who found­ed the center in 1983 for "23 years of cross-cultural global mission in service to the Church and the world." 
Since its inception, the CSC has provided educational experi­ences through social service inspired by Catholic teaching. It also assists students, faculty, staff and alumni in reflecting on social issues and responsibilities. 
Throughout its 23 years, the esc has expanded greatly in its abilities and mission. 
''The Center has grown from an organization that originally coordinated local and national volunteer and experiential learn­ing efforts for Notre Dame stu­dents to a nationally-recognized center deeply rooted in commu­nity-based learning, research and service informed by Catholic social tradition," Lies said. 
Lies said students are very involved in service both to the

"Instead of studying religion as if it were an object, we try to rearticulate it, to under­stand the parts of faith ­articulating a tradition based in faith," Cavadini said.

"Eighty-five percent of all Notre Dame students are involved in service at least once a year, which is well above the national collegiate average, and also of that, nearly 40 percent engage in at least one to two hours of service weekly," he said. 
In addition, Lies said that 10 from five placements in three countries to 36 placements in 14 countries today.

The CSC promptly created the Summer Service Learning pro­gram, in which students go to sites across the United States to perform service for people in need. The program now sends students to about 200 sites every summer. The esc expanded the program's role in 1996 to include the International Summer Service Learning Program, which extends service to across the world. It has grown

The Center also hopes to hold more small, issue-focused semi­nars such as the "Lives in the Balance" seminar, which would examine violence in schools, and to increase the number of inter­national opportunities to stu­dents.

"The CSC will always seek to be a leader in the field of com­munity-based research and service-learning, while challeng­ing Notre Dame undergraduates to develop a life-long commit­ment to social justice," he said.

According to the University­approved rationale for the core requirements of theology, the primary goal of these courses is to "contribute to a student's disciplined reflection on what it means to think about God, God's revelation, and everything else in light of God's revelation." 
The first required course, Foundations of Theology, aims to help students understand the discipline of theology, to encounter the authoritative texts and to become aware of the constitution, transmission and interpretation of the texts as well as to acquire interpre­tive skills of one's own. The focus is not only on the basics of Christian thought but also on improving interpretive skills that can be translated to other disciplines. 
The second required course examines a major theme in the Christian theological tradition and explores its implications through an inquiry of Christian history. 
A spring 2005 survey of stu­dents in the midst of the sec­ond theology requirement found the majority of students to be highly satisfied or satis­fied with the foundations of theology course. The depart­ment, however, is always try­ing to improve the require­ment classes, and often works off student feedback, Cavadini said. 
As for the importance of reli­gious study to the University, "Catholic intellectual life is inconceivable without theolo­gy," Cavadini said.

Gallaudet students protest hire 
Demonstrators want new presidential pick 
Associated Press WASHINGTON -Gallaudet University students blocked access to campus for a second day Thursday, escalating their protest against an incoming president they say lacks the skills to lead the nation's only liberal arts university for the deaf and hearing impaired. "We're in the middle of a crisis here," said LaToya Plummer, 25, a junior from Suitland, Md., who was among the protesters. Students eased their blockade of campus entrances Thursday night after meeting with District of Columbia police and universi­ty officials for three hours. Protest leaders agreed to open one side entrance to avoid being 
arrested.~ 

Other gates, including the main entrance, remained blocked. Students also decided to fill the campus parking garage with their own cars to prevent other vehicles from parking there. 
"We see the police lined up. They are ready to take us, and they can," said Ryan Commerson, a graduate student who took part in the talks. 
The protesters have said they wouldn't let school resume unless the presidential search process is reopened. 
The blockade began around 3 
a.m. Wednesday and forced the university to cancel classes for a second day Thursday as about 200 students protested at the front gate. Some linked arms and formed a human chain to block the main entrance to cam­pus while about 10 police offi­cers looked on from across the street. 
The protests began last spring when then-Provost Jane K. Fernandes was appointed to replace president I. King Jordan, beginning in January, by the school's board of trustees. 
Students intensified their protests on Oct. 5, when they took over Gallaudet's main class­room building -an occupation that was marred by complaints about rough actions by campus police. Since then, the demon­strations have escalated, with students blocking campus gates, forcing school officials to move or cancel classes. 
Plummer, who signed through an interpreter, and other stu­dents and some faculty said they felt shut out of the selection process for the next president. Some also felt the field of candi­dates was not ethnically diverse. 
"They have no idea who we are," Plummer said of the board of trustees. 
Fernandes has said some peo­ple do not consider her "deaf enough" to be president. She was born deaf but grew up speaking and did not learn American Sign Language until she was 23. Those who are against her presidency say she is an unsuitable choice for other reasons. 
"I feel that this institution can­not move forward under Dr. Fernandes' leadership because there are too many disagree­ments about her as a leader," said Mark Weinberger, a profes­sor of foreign languages at Gallaudet and also chair of the faculty's Senate.

"Basically I am going to work for the [Notre Darnel Sports Information Department and work on some papers, all in the com­fort of [South Bend!." 
The University will have a few activities for those stu­dents like Shoemaker who will stay on campus for the week. 
The Snite Museum will host the exhibit "Caras Vemos Corazones No Sabemos" a free exhibit that addresses "the human landscape of Mexican migration." The exhibit is free and open to the public. 
On Oct. 20, the Notre Dame volleyball team will compete against Connecticut in the Joyce Center at 4 p.m. Later that evening, the comedy troupe "The Capitol Steps" will perform at 8:30 pm at the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center. 
Last, but not least, the Notre Dame football team faces UCLA at home on Oct. 21 at 2:30 p.m. -probably drawing many students back for an early end to break.

British presence in Iraq criticized 
LONDON -Britain's new army commander said British troops in Iraq are making the situa­tion worse and must leave the country soon and he called Prime Minister Tony Blair's policies "naive," according to an interview published Thursday. 
Gen. Richard Dannatt said the British military should "get ourselves out sometime soon because our presence exacerbates the security problems," according to the interview with the Daily Mail released on the tabloid's Web site. 
"Whatever consent we may have had in the first place" from the Iraqi people "has largely turned to intolerance," he said, according to the report. 
The Defense Ministry and Blair's office said they could not immediately comment. 
Dannatt's comments are certain to infuriate Blair, who is President Bush's key ally in the Iraq war. 
New mouse discovered in Cyprus 
LONDON-Using DNA testing, scientists have discovered what is believed to be the first terres­trial mammal found in Europe in decades: a mouse with a big head, ears, eyes and teeth that lives in a mountainous area of Cyprus. 
The mouse was native to the eastern Mediterranean island, survived the arrival of man on Cyprus and could be considered a "liv­ing fossil," experts said. 
"New mammal species are mainly discovered in hot spots of biodiversity like Southeast Asia, and it was generally believed that every species of mammal in Europe had been identified," said Thomas Cucchi, a research fellow at Durham University in northeast England. 
'This is why the discovery of a new species of mouse on Cyprus was so unexpected and excit­ing," he said in an interview Thursday.

JOPLIN, Mo. -The father of a 13-year-old who fired a shot inside his school in a blood­less shooting was arrested Thursday and charged with being a felon in possession of a gun, authorities said. 
Gregory Lynn White, 44, appeared before a federal magistrate in Springfield after being arrested without incident outside his Joplin home, federal agents said. 
White did not enter a plea and was released on $5,000 bond. If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison or fines up to $250,000. 
Amish shooting site demolished 
NICKEL MINES, Pa. -Ten days after the Amish schoolhouse shootings, a demolition crew using heavy equipment tore down the bloodstained building Thursday and obliterat­ed nearly all traces of the place where five girls were killed. 
Only a bare patch of earth was left behind, and it was planted with grass seed, so that eventually even the footprint of the one-room schoolhouse will be gone, too. 
Any kind of plaque or memorial is unlikely. Members of the plain-living Amish community said it would be too showy and would attract too many visitors. 
"They do not want to make it a tourist attraction," said the 27-year-old brother of two of the 15 boys sent out of the schoolhouse by the gunman before the shooting.

Exploratory drilling inconclusive 
MONTGOMERY, Ind. -The state Department of Natural Resources told residents that results of recent exploratory drilling for coal in a south­em Indiana wildlife preserve were inconclusive. 
"We do not have any concept of what may or may not be there," DNR Director Kyle Hupfer said Wednesday during the first of a series of public hearings on the project. 
The Evansville-based Black Beauty Coal Co. was given approval by the Department of Natural Resources last month to drill up to three dozen holes at depths from 130 feet to 180 feet at the Glendale Fish and Wildlife area in Daviess County, northeast of Evansville.

17 Guantanamo prisoners freed 
16 Afghans, 1 Iranian released from long captivity at U.S. prison zn Cuba 
Associated Press 
KABUL Sixteen Afghans and one Iranian released from years in captivity at the U.S. prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, arrived in Afghanistan on Thur­sday, an Afghan official said. 
The 16 Afghans appe­ared at a news confer­ence alongside Sibgh­atullah Mujaddedi, head of Afghanistan's reconcil­iation commission, which assists with the release of detainees from Guant­anamo and the U.S. prison at the Bagram military base north of Kabul. 
Mujaddedi said many of the detainees, who are now free, had served up to four years in Guant­anamo. He said "most" of the prisoners were inno­cent and had been turned in to the U.S. military by other Afghans because of personal disputes. 
The released Iranian 
prisoner, who also ar­
rived in Afghanistan on 
Thursday, was handed 
over to the International 
Committee of the Red 
Cross, he said.

Women's InterCultural Leadership (CWIL). 
The Catalyst Trip has been an annual event over the past several years, whereas the Pilgrimage to Mexico and Habitat are relatively new to the college. 
"If there is sufficient interest among students, staff and fac­ulty, then I would love to see these [Habitat and Pilgrimage] become annual trips; although in the future, the exact desti­nation might be different depend-in this country," she said. "We empower women to be leaders in the undoing of racism through workshops led by two exceptional diversity trainers." 

Those diversity trainers are Dorothy Friesen and Rosemarie Harris. Friesen co­facilitates anti-racism work­shops for various churches and social agencies. Harris is a criminal justice administra­tor and formerly served as Saint Mary's Director of Security. 
Nicole Garcia, who graduat­ed from Saint Mary's in 2004, was quick to emphasize the power of the Catalyst Trip.

Pastoral visits to the elderly and youth education programs are among the variety of min­istry programs implemented by the mission. 
The group will be visiting different parishes in the area, but will take residence in the Hospitality House of the Sisters of the Holy Cross. 
"We will be working with the youth groups that the sisters have in Monterrey, visiting parishes, having lunch with the elderly, celebrating wor­ship together, learning about immigration, learning more about Mexican culture [and] having structured reflection sessions on how these experi­ences challenge and shape our faith lives and learning about the Sisters' work in Mexico," Ortiz said. 
The trip will focus on per­sonal reflection, in order to discover the individual's greater impact on the world. 
"Each day will end with the­ological reflection about the daily experiences and how that impacts one's under­standing of a global world, as well as 'What does Catholic Social Teaching have to offer about the situation of the resi­
dents?' and 'Are  we  being

added.  

Senior Beth Sands is a Spanish major and hopes this trip will be a learning experi­ence for her. 
"I am hoping to practice speaking Spanish in a setting where I am also learning about my faith through inter­acting with another culture," she said. 
This trip begins on Monday, Oct. 16 and students return on Sunday, Oct. 22. 
As these students give back over the break, they may find themselves with a greater understanding of Saint Mary's. 
"I think it's important that all the trips reflect the mission and concerns of the College in real, tangible ways," Call said. "All three of these [trips] do exactly that."

However, a group of 120 students will take an alter­nate path by heading south to help rebuild New Orleans, operating independently of the esc for no credit. 
Junior Caity Schneeman, chair of the Gulf Coast Task Force that's in charge of the excursion, has led several recovery trips to New Orleans since Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. The group she's taking this week will be her largest yet, Schneeman said. 
"It's ridiculous how there are still hundreds of homes that need to be gutted, so our goal is to remove furniture, take down walls, and repair them for rebuilding," she said. "It's a really effective way of doing service." 
The students will work with Catholic Charities and Operation Helping Hands ­affiliates of the Archdiocese of New Orleans. Funding and student recruitment has been so successful that Schneeman

The Cultural Diversity Seminar, though less service­oriented, will immerse 10 stu­dents in Chicago's ethnic neighborhoods where they will initiate dialogue with various community leaders. They will be studying the demographics and frustra­tions of diversity in Chicago through coordination with the Urban Life Center. 
"Our goal is to ensure that every single person can iden­tify with multi-ethnic back­grounds," said Ashley Williams, sophomore student coordinator. "We want to make it personal for every­body." 
A group of 11 students will head east to participate in the Washington, D.C. Seminar to study foreign relations and international affairs. 
"We'll be meeting with a wide range of think tanks, advocacy groups and govern­mental organizations that span the ideological spectrum to try to get a balanced pic­ture of foreign relations today," said senior student coordinator Christian Hoeffel.

Students will travel to Washington, D.C. and meet with Church leaders, elected officials and representatives of agencies that focus on these issues. 

The common thread uniting each of these issues is stu­dents' call to action and faith. Through their involvement in these programs, they will learn to question and gain a basic understanding of social justice issues as American citizens. 
"This will be an education for them," Miller-McGraw said. "When one has the experience to offer himself to another, they are in turn edu­cating themselves. Through the act of serving and giving back you learn much about yourself and the community."

IN BRIEF 

Stores lower prices on generic drugs 
TRENTON, N.J.-Consumers are suddenly get­ting a break on the cost of generic drugs as dis­count retailers and some prescription benefit managers start programs that provide a host of popu1ar medications at very low costs. 
In the last month, Wal-Mart stores Inc. and Target Corp. have begun programs at pharmacies in their Florida stores, including Wal-Mart's Sam's Club, offering dozens of generic drugs for $4. Last May, Kmart Holding Corp.'s 1,100 stores began offering generics for $15 for a 90-day supply. 
On Thursday, Medco Health Solutions, one of the largest U.S. prescription benefit managers, announced a plan targeting consumers indirectly through small-and medium-sized businesses struggling to offer employees prescription cover­age. 
Medco, based in Franklin Lakes, will offer its "Generics First" plan through partner health insurers for which it manages prescription claims and shipments from its mail order pharmacies. The plan kicks off this week through the first insurer to sign up, Nationwide Ufe Insurance Co., said John Driscoll, Medco's group president for new business development. 

Filmmaker leaves Wal-Mart group 
A filmmaker whose work praised Wal-Mart has quit a national advocacy group funded by the retailer, saying pay caps adopted recently by the nation's largest employer were unfair to its long-time workers. 
Ron Galloway said Wednesday he left the national steering committee of Working Families for Wal-Mart about a week ago over the pay caps adopted in August. Galloway said the caps, which Wal-Mart has defended as a standard industry practice, would hurt the company by encouraging experienced employ­ees to leave. 
Working Families spokesman Kevin Sheridan r.onfirmed Galloway had left but said it was over environmental policy differences. 
"Hon agreed to depart the committee in order to fully pursue a new film on the so­called myth of global warming, which runs contrary to Wal-Mart's aggressive sustainabili­ty agenda. We thank him for his support and wish him well with his new project," Sheridan said. 


Dow Jones closes at record high 
Index sets intraday high; McDonald's, other companies keep market upbeat 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -The Dow Jones industrial average broke through 11,900 to close at a record high Thursday, boosted by opti­mism over the health of cor­porate earnings. 
The index's gain marked its fifth record close in two weeks; the Dow also set a record intraday high. 
The markets were upbeat Thursday, with investors focusing on positive news from well-known consumer brands such as McDonald's Corp. and on economic data that indicated the economy was holding up even as it slowed. Oil prices, which remain near lows for the year, also boosted the mood on Wall Street. 
"In general, we're getting friendly reports between oil inventories being up higher than expected and then some bellwether companies that are exceeding esti­mates," said John C. Forelli, portfolio manager for Independence Investment LLC in Boston. "It's kind of a return to the Goldilocks economy." 
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 95.57, or 0.81 percent, to 11,947.70. The advance put the 12,000 threshold within investors' sights. The previous record close, from Tuesday, was 11,867.17.

Faculty recruiting needs shift 
Notre Dame is right in seeking to increase the number of Catholic faculty at the University. Whether it is immediately noticeable or not, more professors bringing more religious con­text into the classroom will help further the University's stated mission. That mission, however, must also inclmle a broad spectrum of opinions that fosters intellectual religious debate. Religion without question is no faith; it is an assumption that bears no imminent influence on your life. Notre Dame's mis­sion wants anything but that. 
In that light, the questions that some faculty members have raised about the University's initiative to increase

stay at Notre Dame rather than searching for jobs at schools where they would feel more appreciated. 
2) Keep Notre Dame's advantage in the recruiting of non­Catholic faculty. As a top-20 American university, Notre Dame is in a position to attract top-line professors of all religions. By actively searching for religious professors -no matter what religion they are -and professors who have genuine opinions on religion they arn not afraid to express, the school can bring an added element that other top universities do not have. By 
embracing serious, continuous religious discussion  - some­

Dame can set itself apart from o ther top  

ments creating a database of only top Catholic academics diminishes the importance of Jenkins' message. 
Thus, the University's departments should seek to attract both Catholic and non-Catholic intellectuals that do not fear invoking religion in discussions and debates with students about all fields of study -from bioethics and business to poli­tics and philosophy. 
This religious focus would help in three eoncrete ways: 
1) Minimize the chance current non-Catholic faculty feel unwanted and "less equal." By explaining and putting actions behind words expressing Notre Dame's need for non-Catholic faculty, our top Muslim, Buddhist, Protestant, Orthodox, Jewish, agnostic and atheist professors will be more likely to 
rently. By keeping prominent non-Catholic schol­ars on their radars, department heads will see the top overall candidates, as well as the top Catholic candidates. A specific quota isn't what Notre Dame needs, as Arts and Letters Dean Mark Roche pointed out. To indude the bigger picture is essen­tial to keeping Notre Dame as an institution of higher learning with the best possible professors. 
Notre Dame strives to be a top-5 university, period. But it won't -and shouldn't-give up its Catholic character to achieve that status. Through openness about its goals and a commitment to realize them, Notre Dame can and will fmd a place in the upper echelon of higher learning while reempha­sizing its Catholic faith. 
LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
'Right to life' not single-issue 
In her letter ("Examining Pro-Life Values," Oct. 11) Mary DeBroeck correctly asserts that "in the Catholic call for social justice," one cannot fight "for an end to abortion while turn­ing a deaf ear to all the rest" of the injustices committed against human life. It is necessary to point out two fallacies that need to be clarified in order for Notre Dame Right to Life to be portrayed accurately. 
Having "attended her first and only meet­ing" of the club two years ago, DeBroeck is unaware of the extent of the activi­ties of the organization. Based on her expansive and sound pro-life convictions, she finds Notre Dame Right to Life at fault for not focusing on issues such as "capital punishment, mistreated and mentally disabled, euthanasia vic­tims, mistreated prison­ers of war, as well as the hungry in Africa." Such an accusation is simply not true. 
Precisely because the club seeks to build an entire culture of life based on the innate digni­ty of every human person, the club cannot and does not overlook the necessity of raising awareness of all the injustices committed against the human person. Last year, the club sponsored a discussion and lecture on the death penalty. Right to Life co-sponsored the Edith Stein Project, a conference that focused on, among other issues, women's eating disorders and violence against women. The club has also invited speakers to discuss issues ranging from stem-cell research, to euthanasia and end-of-life issues, to contraception. Making the claim that the club neglects issues other than abortion is being misin­formed. 
Secondly, Pope John Paul Il reminds us in "The Gospel of Life," "among all the crimes which can be committed against life, procured abortion has characteristics making it particu­larly serious and deplorable." The Second Vatican Council in "Gaudium et Spes" defines abortion, together with infanti­cide, an "unspeakable crime." 
DeBroeck correctly recognizes that Notre Dame Right to Life is decidedly "abortion focused." While every crime against the life of a human being is a deplorable sin that cries out for vengeance to God, the moral gravity and social effects of "thou­sands dying from capital punishment each year" cannot be equated with the one million and six hundred thousand innocent human beings killed yearly by surgi­cal abortion in our country alone. "No one more absolutely 
innocent could be imag­ined. In no way could this human being ever be con­
sidered an aggressor, much less an unjust aggressor," John Paul II reminds us. 
We are grateful to DeBroeck for reminding the Notre Dame communi­ty of the necessity of upholding the dignity of all human life and of fighting to end injustices on many fronts. 

Notre Dame Right to Life fre­quently cooperates with many other campus organizations that 
seek to fight against these injustices. It is the specific goal and mission of this organization, however, to bring to the fore­
front of the public forum the absolute necessity of recognizing that the light against abortion is of fundamental importance to building a culture of life.

piece were the event and its interpretation Clerk at once. 
This memory has remained with me as a parable charting my own ambivalence concerning the nature of journalism and its consequences for our political cul­ture. 
My classmate's attempt to render edi­torial pages as Cliffs Notes for reality expressed what Cardinal Newman con­demned as the "opinionatedness" of modern culture, in which having a posi­tion on every question is not only a right but a necessity. If one lacks leisure to contemplate the stakes of a given ques­tion, finding a shortcut to a firm opinion seems only practical. 
Journalists, in general, are not sophis­ticated thinkers, and that helps in their business. If one can see through the ambiguities of an event and immediately discover the pro or con formula at its core, one would likely make a fine reporter. Never mind that this kind of "seeing through" is in truth a blindness to difficulties. Americans support or oppose the Iraq war for multiple rea­sons. In the world constructed by the news media these reasons are the first jetsam jettisoned and all that remains is a standardized index of favorable and unfavorable sentiments.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Africa's problems more complex 
An Oct. 4 op-ed piece in the International Herald Tribune by New York Times columnist Nicholas D. Kristof was titled "Optimism and Africa." In it Kristof highlights the changing situations in some countries on the African continent, with improvements in Governance, in the fight against corruption, in economic reform and in the investment climate. He gives exam­ples of Tanzania, Ghana, Rwanda and Nigeria. 
This pales in comparison to the rather negative tone that your report on Professor Naomi Chazan lecture on Africa conveyed. Particularly striking was the sentence, "she referred to the political breakdown of states due to ethnic fragmentation and conflict, famine and the AIDS epidemic." Currently only Somalia (and maybe Sudan) are breaking apart because of ethnic fragmentation and conflict. Other states such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, Angola and Liberia (and even Cote D'Ivoire) are still single units despite years of varying degrees of conflict. 
The stereotypical image of Africa is changing and while the problems continue to be present, there are numerous positive changes. More than a continent of political breakdown, ethnic conflict famine and AIDS, Africa is a continent suffering from the collapse of infra­structure (particularly roads and power), very unequal and uneven distribution of wealth, the lack of opportuni­ty for skilled labor, the lack of investment in technology, a continued backwardness in its primary economic activity of agriculture and a very slow growth in the institutionalization of politics and political activity in much of Africa. It is also a continent in which political pluralism in its own unique form is taking root with vir­tually every country holding regular multiparty elections and many countries experiencing smooth transitions from one party to another. My hope is that Professor Chazan touched on some of these more modern prob­lems and issues and not just what has been the presen­tation of Africa over the past thirty years. 
Rev. David Kashangaki, C.S.C Jinja, Uganda Oct. II 

dichotomous thinking on the grounds that the ballot box does not consider reasons but rather counts votes, and so our political discourse must pragmati­cally model itself on the instrument of popular suffrage. Some such conception must lie behind the practice in certain college political science courses where the students use small "clickers" to reg­ister their for/against opinion on numer­ous issues at each class meeting. Education in such a course does not attempt to "get behind" the practices of a democracy to explore and interpret them. Rather it seeks to assure its stu­dents that speedy "opinionatedness" goes all the way down. One understands politics as soon as one understands the necessity of having an opinion about everything. 
Studies of the news media's effect on popular opinion suggest that the press does not shape persons' beliefs per se, but rather, frames the categories in which people think through those beliefs. The p-ress may not sway me to support a given immigration bill, but it can and does delimit the menu of responses most people will have to it. 
The deleterious effects of such cate­gorical thinking may not result merely from the coarseness of journalists' intel­lects, however. Journalists generally pursue a professional commitment to avoid "bias," and they often try to do so outside of the greenroom of the editorial page. Their attempt, unfortunately, is constituted by a series of five "objective" tests that determine whether an article is unbiased. The most damaging of these is the test that a story must represent "both sides" of a given topic. The power to decide how a question may be asked, how a debate may be framed, is four-fifths of the terrain of politics. Choosing sides accounts for the last fraction, and is the sorry postage stamp remaining to most of us. 
One should be suspicious of any series of "objective" tests that establish a piece of writing's fairness. While the efforts of journalists to achieve "fair and bal­anced" news coverage are admirable, they have miscarried. This is so not because clarity and honesty are unob­tainable, but because these are goals that can be obtained, as it were, only though a personal commitment to them. The attempt to free oneself of this com­mitment by following five-or five hun­dred -external tests should be an embarrassment almost as sad as the lukewarm citizen who insists he is a "good person" because he has not killed anyone, paid his taxes and stopped at every stop sign. 
To be a good person, one must stu­diously conceive an image of what the "good life for man" looks like and har­ness the will to model one's own life upon it. Strength of will is naturally important, but so is the faculty that matures as one contemplates the experi­ences of a lifetime, namely, wisdom. 
A freshman student of my own once wrote an essay on "bias in the media" and concluded that "tests" do not fair news make. Only wisdom, the practice of honestly evaluating a question in the light of one's accumulated experience, can result in articulate truth. If this were recognized, newspapers would probably have fewer young reporters writing copy, but they might also cultivate editorial writers who could reflect inwardly on the difficulties of a question, drawing on the integrity of their experience, rather than merely excrete an opinion pro or con at every question framed on the front page. 
Before the emergence of journalism programs in America, the popular news presses tended to cater explicitly to its own partisan audience. The journalist had authority with readers because they had a priori trust in his sharing funda­mental beliefs and principles with them. So long as the journalist clung to a stan­dard of honor and honesty, the "interest­ed" perspective of the writing testified to commitment to a certain body of wis­dom. Of late, this kind of writing has reemerged in magazines like First Things, The Weekly Standard, The American Conservative and The New Republic. However much I sometimes disagree with the opinions threaded through their pages, the commitment of their writers to acknowledging the prin­ciples on which, and through which, they argue testifies to their integrity and wis­dom. In contrast, the unacknowledged distortions and infuriating simplifica­tions of The New York Times lead one to conclude that its writers may pass all the "objectivity tests" in the world and still not give us the truth. 
Wisdom may seem an unreliable sub­stitute for the "certainty" of tests that can be taught in journalism courses. But certain tests are not themselves truth and the only path to truth is full of unfortunate but inevitable byways.

'THE DEPARTED' MOVIE REVIEW 
Sergeant Dignam 
(MarkWahlberg) 
-.............. 



Captain Ellerby 

(Alee Baldwin) 

By BRIAN DOXTADER and MARTY SCHROEDER Scene Critics 
If redemption is the linchpin of past Martin Scorsese films, then "The Departed" is indica­tive of a significant break with tradition. Most of the director's work offers some kind of sol­ace, but this film succeeds in spite (or perhaps because oO its conscious need to turn from the past. 
All Scorsese pictures are volatile, but "The Departed" is as vicious, cynical and nihilistic as any film the director has made. It's also one of his best, which is no small feat considering the magnitude of his oeuvre. 
Based on the popular Hong Kong trilogy "Infernal Affairs," "The Departed" follows an undercover cop, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), who infiltrates the gang of Boston mafioso Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Costello, meanwhile. has an undercover agent among the police, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon). As Costigan infiltrates deeper into Costello's organization, so too does Sullivan rise up the police ranks. Eventually, the lilm becomes a tense, taut cat-and-mouse game between cop and criminal. 
What separates "The Departed" from Scorsese's other well-known works is the eon­temporary nature of the narrative. Unlike his two immediately preceding films -"Gangs of New York" and "The Aviator" -and other pictures like "The Age of Innocence" and "Goodfellas," 'The Departed" is not a period piece. Yet there is still a tension between the past and present that enhances rather than detracts from the film's noirish tone. Seeing classically-styled gangsters conducting busi­ness on their cell phones is initially jarring, but Scorsese adroitly weaves these modern references into the narrative. 
However, "The Departed" is still unmistak­ably a Scorsese picture. Idiosyncratic film­making tendencies, like references to the French New Wave, are sprinkled throughout. More than almost any director, Scorsese cre­ates films that are, above all, cinematic. Nowhere is this more evident than in "The Departed," which is one of his most consis­tently engaging pictures. 
The acting is incredible thoughout, anchored by Leonardo DiCaprio as the tor­mented Costigan. DiCaprio, who has emerged as Scorsese's new DeNiro, gives a fiery, gritty performance that ranks among his best, and Academy Award voters will likely take notice. 
Jack Nicholson is predictably reliable as Costello, though he seems to be having the most fun he's had with a role in years. Nicholson's improvisatory acting style would seem to contrast with Scorsese's meticulous tendencies, but that tension produces fantastic results. Nicholson is given some free reign by the director, who in turn pulls the actor in just enough that his perform­

dictability, and that very quality is what made those characters so gal­vanizing. 
The most surprising performance belongs to Mark Wahlberg, who dominates every frame he's in. The one-time rapper gets some of the best lines in the picture and he takes full advantage, which makes Dignam, Wahlberg's foul-mouthed cop, one of the most memorable in the film. The supporting cast is incredible, rounded out by Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin, both of whom give effortless, pitch­perfect performances. 
The acting would be wasted if not for a great script, and "The Departed" delivers in spades. William Monahan's screenplay is funny, profane and affecting all at once, full of punchy dialogue and brisk pacing. Taking cues from Mamet, Tarantino and one-time Scorsese scribe Paul Schrader, Monahan brings a darkly ironic mentality to the script, which is one of the best screenpl~, tor has had since "Goodfellas." 1 of the screenplay is startling, es1 sidering that Monahan's only prel credit is "Kingdom of Heaven."

Better with age 
Striker Joseph Lapira is enjoying tranquil times and an explosive season 
By ERIC RETTER Associate Spons Ediror 
Joseph Lapira is having a breakout season. That much is obvious. 
The Notre Dame junior forward currently leads the NCAA with 18 goals and 39 points, and has been named the Big East offen­sive player of the week three times. He has also received five national honors, among them being named the College Soccer News national player of the week in each of the last two weeks ­making him the first player to ever receive the honor in back­to-hack weeks. 
"He's just an offensive machine, which is terrific," Irish coach Bobby Clark said. 'That's why we play him as the first-up striker. He's got tremendous ability in this area, and he's got tremen­dous appetite to get into scoring position." 
The fact that Lapira is an offen­sive threat has come as no sur­prise to those familiar with the Irish program. As a sophomore last season, Lapira led the team in goals, scoring seven in 23 games. 
No one could have predicted, however, that he would have exploded the way he has in recent weeks. In the last six games alone, Lapira has netted 11 goals, and he eclipsed last year's season total in the fourth game of a stretch that began on Sept. 23 against Pittsburgh and saw him score two goals a game for five games in a row. That streak ended Wednesday, as Lapira managed only one goal in a 3-0 Irish win over Michigan State. 
"I had no idea it was going to be like this," Lapira said. "I had no idea it was going to be me who came out, [and) broke out. I've been the one who's been in the right place at the right time." 
Lapira has downplayed the importance of his personal awards and achievements this year, and he said that he didn't fmd out that he had the national lead in goals scored until he read about it in the newspaper. 
"It's more of just something to joke around with in the locker room," Lapira said. "The only dif­ferent thing for me is people back home that I haven't talked to in a long while [have started] calling me or sending me e-mails and IMs saying 'good job."' 
His recent hot streak has pro­pelled No.8 Notre Dame to a 10­3-2 record (6-2-0 in the Big East), and he is a major reason why the Irish ofl'ense, which struggled to consistently score goals early this season, is now ranked in the top­1 0 nationally for scoring offense. Since Lapira began his run, the Notre Dame offense has per­formed more like it expected to all season. 
"We've really developed a con­fidence these last few games," fellow forward Justin McGeeney said. "We don't feel as anxious about scoring goals. We know they're going to come." 

role model, and just what I can do for him to be a leader," Lapira said. "He's coming into his junior year on his soccer team and he's captain and he's looking to me for advice." 
Lapira's family has also influ­enced one of his major pre-game rituals. For each game, Lapira wears a crucifix that his mother gave him as a Confirmation pres­ent. The crucifix has brought him enough success on the pitch that he has begun lending it to his girlfriend Kerri Hanks, a forward on the Irish women's soccer team, for her matches. 
"She claims she can't score unless she has my crucifix on," he said. · 
The junior forward has also created a pre-game ritual with McGeeney, who has become his close friend over the past few years. Before each match, the two share a cup of tea with team­

new to me," he said. "I hated it." 
Lapira has spent much of the past two years maturing into who he is today, both as a person and as a player. 
On the field, he wizened as a player, especially with regards to budgeting his energy. 
"He used to always run himself to a standstill by doing too much work," Clark said. "I think now he's getting a lot smarter as a player [while] still working very hard." 
Lapira agrees with his coach's analysis. 
"As a freshman, I just got out there and ran around like a chicken with its head cut off, [and] I wasn't a great soccer player by any means," he said. "This year, I've really settled into things, [and) I'm really relaxed in games. 
His greatest strides, however, have come in areas completely outside of soccer. Last year, Lapira's home in Lake Charles was destroyed when a tree fell through it during Hurricane Rita. Lapira remembers how the events brought life into perspec­tive for him. 
"I saw my friend's docks and piers that I had hung out in in the summer just months beforehand, [destroyed on the news, and] it was kind of surreal," he said. "It can happen to anybody and it happened to me." 
While no one in his family was hurt, Lapira struggled to deal with what had happened for much of his sophomore year. 
"Last year, I had never been so stressed in my life," he said. "I tried not to let people know, I tried to hide my feelings about things last year. I got really stressed out during the season, I'd miss class because of it, work would pile up and at the end of the semester, I was just falling apart." 
Lapira also sees the a correla­tion between his mt:mtal state and his play last year, which he felt was not always up to his best. 
"I had let it all build up, putting it down and not letting a.nyone know about it, and I think that just got to me in the end," he said. "As a student, I struggled last year, and maybe that's part of the reason I didn't have such a good season." 
After what happened, Lapira has come out stronger from the experience. His family has begun a transition to Houston, and he is ready to move on. 
"This year, I'm on top of things, if I get stressed out about some­thing ... I'll go talk to coach, talk to my girlfriend, just get it out there." 
'I'd like to play as long as I could' 
As Lapira's family slowly moves to Houston -with his father traveling for the majority of Notre Dame's games-he has refocused his efforts on improv­ing on the field. Over the summer, he worked extensively with sen­ior midfielder Nate Norman to improve his dribbling skills. 
"He's one of the most unbeliev­able dribblers, and [I] tried to start dribbling a little more like him instead of myself," he said. 
Lapira is also having more fun with his environment this season. For the past few weeks, he has worn a mustache which he won't shave while the team remains hot. 
"I don't really like shaving that much, and whenever I'd go to shave, I'd leave ... something stu­pid for the day," he said. "I kind of like it ... and then the goal streak started. Since then, I've kind of been like, 'well, might as well keep the mustache, we've got agood thing going."' 
After leaving school, the junior entrepreneurship major envi­sions a life of professional soccer. 
"I'd like to play as long as I could, [though] I don't know if that would be in MLS or over­seas." 
However, Lapira doesn't plan on pursuing that goal before graduation, and his primary focus at the moment is to help Notre Dame win a national championship. 
"Right now I'll just worry about being a [Notre Dame playerl," he said. 
Contact Eric Retter at eretter@nd.edu 
wears his heart on his sleeve." 
Despite the fact that he is nei­ther a captain nor a particularly vocal member of the team, Lapira has come forward as a leader of the experienced Irish squad. 
"The first thing a leader's got to do is lead by example, and I think Joseph does that superbly well," Clark said. "I think Joseph's biggest asset is not what he says, but what he does." 
Lapira's emergence as a leader perhaps applies more to life ofT the pitch than on it, and he cred­its Clark with encouraging his development over the summer. 
"Whenever [Clark] talks about it, he puts it in perspective of my little brother looking to me as a No Goal Patrol, so 

we were like, 'lets write something on our chest,"' Lapira said. "We were kind of being immature about it and just wrote something ... We figured why not." 
'You probably want to look at other schools' 
Lapira and McGeeney actually became friends before the former had even enrolled at Notre Dame. While on his recruiting visit, McGeeney hosted Lapira, and the two became fast friends. 
However, had it not been for Lapira's own initiative, he may never have made that trip to South Bend. As a junior in high school, Lapira first came to Notre Dame to visit his cousin, and as part of his visit, e-mailed Clark about scheduling a meeting. While Clark happily agreed to meet with him, the initial encounter wasn't particularly promising. 
"I went in and met with him with my uncle and my dad, and he was like 'you probably want to look at other schools, this is a pretty tough school to get into,"' Lapira said. "[However, Clark said] if you get a chance, come to our camp and send me an e-mail about what tournaments your team is playing in." 
Lapira ended up impressing Clark at the summer camp, and Clark decided to recruit Lapira after traveling that fall to see the striker's club team play at a tour­nament in Iowa. 
With Notre Dame as a suitor, the Lake Charles, La. native recalls that his college decision wasn't too difficult. 
"It wasn't really like I had a whole bunch of schools knocking at my door," he said. "It was Notre Dame or go to LSU to be with my friends." 
Once at Notre Dame, it took Lapira a while to adjust to the new environment. 
"I had never seen snow before, so just getting used to playing in the cold weather was completely

MARTIN ScoRSESE: PoRTRAIT OF AN AuTEUR 
By BRIAN DOXTADER Scene Editor 
The critical consensus on 'The Departed" is that Scorsese has returned to the mean streets where he belongs, but even a cursory glance at his filmography proves that he never really left. The direc­tor has directed a handful of true classics, many of which rank among the very best films of all time. 
Mean Streets (1973, Warners) 
Scorsese shows off his film school background right off the bat and establishes many of his defining cin­ematic and thematic tendencies in this, his first major critical success. Taking cues from the French New Wave and boasting a fast-paced dialogue style, "Mean Streets" fol­lows Charlie as he attempts to keep his twisted morals straight. Featuring a young Robert DeNiro as Johnny Boy, Scorsese quickly solidi­fied the themes and motifs that would become his calling cards ­religion, morality, gangsters, pro­fanity and (ultimately) a sort of redemption. 
Taxi Driver (1976, Columbia) 
A major critical success, "Taxi Driver" helped vault Scorsese into directorial stardom. A terrifying examination of post-Vietnam, post­Watergate paranoia, the film fol­lows Travis Bickle (DeNiro), an unhinged taxi driver as he attempts to save a young prostitute (Jodie Foster) from her dominating pimp (Harvey Keitel). The most famous scene, in which DeNiro stands in front of a mirror saying, "You talkin' to me?" is one of the great sequences in cinema history. Scorsese's energy and cinematic technique is evident throughout, though "Taxi Driver" hasn't aged quite as well as some of the direc­tor's other films. It is a picture about its time, and as a snapshot "Taxi Driver" is very effective. 

Raging Bull (1980, UA) 

In the late 1970s, Scorsese suf­fered a drug overdose and nearly died. While in the hospital, he was approached by Robert DeNiro, who asked him to make "Raging Bull" about real-life middeweight boxing Jake LaMotta. Scorsese eventually agreed and used filmmaking as an emotional and artistic outlet. The final product is, without doubt, Scorsese's fmest film, which in turn makes it one of the finest films of all time. DeNiro gives the performance of his life as LaMotta, first sparring over 1,000 rounds with the real-life boxer, then gaining nearly 60 pounds to play the former champi­on as a washed-up, middle-age schmuck. Scorsese is DeNiro's equal every step of the way, crafting a pic­ture to match the actor's stunning performance. The most famous scenes are the boxing sequences, which are both impressionistic and artistic. "Raging Bull" was nominat­ed for several Oscars and won Best Actor and Best Editing. 
The Last Temptation of Christ (1987, Universal) 
Oddly one of Scorsese's most per­sonal films, "The Last Temptation of Christ" is a controversial adaptation of Nikos Kazantzaki's equally con­troversial novel of the same name. Starring Willem Dafoe as Jesus and Harvey Keitel as a street-tough Judas, the picture follows the life of Christ up to his crucifixion and death. Scorsese brings his Catholic upbringing into the film, giving a surprisingly pro-religious bent to the proceedings. "The Last Temptation of Christ" was poorly received due to its departure from scripture, though Scorsese received a Best Director Oscar nomination for his work. 
Goodfellas (1990, Warners) 
A wild exploration of "three decades of life in the mob," "Goodfellas" may be the director's most fast-paced and frenetic film. Ray Liotta plays Henry Hill, a low­level gangster whose rise and fall is documented over the course of a driving 150 minutes. Every Scorsese trick in the book is pulled out, from long tracking shots to freeze frames. The best shot may be a long, 181-second tracking shot through the underbelly of the Copacabana that ends onstage. This fantastic shot literally takes the viewer through the privileged life of a small-time gangster. Like most Scorsese films, "Goodfellas" fea­tures great acting, especially by Joe Pesci, whose Tommy DeVito is as terrifying as they come -it won the diminutive actor a Best Supporting Actor. 
From the sacred to the profane, Scorsese's films have run the gamut, but his themes and stylistic tendencies have remained largely the same. As a director and film­maker, he has grown and evolved over the years, which makes the sacred profanity of "The Departed" seem at once effortless and familiar. 
Yet there is a freshness to his lat­est film that proves that, despite his age, Scorsese remains one of the best filmmakers in the world and one of the few remaining auteurist cornerstones of his generation.

MEN'S INTERHALL 

Despite weather, Keenan too hot to handle 
O'Neill uses strong running game, stout defense, to secure playoff berth with convincing win over Alumni 
By JOHN TIERNEY and KATE DONLIN Sports Writers 
On a night that warmth forgot, Keenan played like a team that remembered its destiny. 
Behind 108 rushing yards and two touchdowns from running back Alex Gonzalez, the Knights beat Morrissey 12-6 in a battle of undefeated teams vying for the Gold League's top seed. 
The Manorites got off to a good start in the first quarter, scoring on the game's opening series. Quarterback Alvin Reynolds went 2-for-2, throwing for 48 yards and a touchdown on the drive, both of his completions coming on third down. After leading the Manorites into Knight territory, Reynolds hooked up with wide receiver Carl Anderson for a 39­yard touchdown to give Morrissey a 6-0 lead. 
Despite his success on the opening drive, Reynolds was pulled in favor of regular starter Joe McBrayer. McBrayer was less successful against the tough Knight defense, as he completed only four of his 13 passes for 73 yards and an interception. 
After the initial Manorite score, Keenan put together a 36-yard drive that lasted into the second quarter but ended in a fumble. 
After a Morrissey fumble two plays later, the Knights took pos­session again at their own 38­yard line. Behind 38 yards on five carries from Gonzalez, including a touchdown run from 12 yards out, Keenan tied the game at six. 
Morrissey had a chance before the half to respond to the Knight touchdown, but that ended with an Anderson interception two plays into the Manorite drive. 
After halftime, Keenan started with the ball and came out strong. Capitalizing on an emo­tional argument with the refer­ees by the Manorite-affiliated chain gang, the Knights put together an 8-play, 65-yard scor­ing drive. Keenan began the drive with a trick play out of the half, in which 10 Keenan players, including Gonzalez lined up near their sideline. Gonzalez received a direct snap from center and ran 25 yards to the Manorite 40­yard line. 

From there, Gonzalez rushed for another 20 yards on the drive, including the eventual game-winning touchdown. 
While the loss was a disap­pointment for Morrissey, the squad is still eligible for the post­season. Meanwhile, the win clinches the Gold League's top seed for Keenan. Both teams will begin their playoff runs following fall break. 
O'Nelll13, Alumni 0 
Despite the falling snow and freezing temperatures, the Angry Mob from O'Neill managed to heat things up on the field. 
The Mob's victory over Alumni secured its spot in the playoffs, meaning O'Neill is one step clos­er to reaching its ultimate goal ­the championship game. 
Just seconds into the contest, O'Neill made sure the Dawgs knew they came to play. Mob running back Mike Mattingly dashed 70 yards into the end zone, dodging tackles and taking advantage of his teammates' blocks. The successful point-after gave the Mob an early 7-0 lead. 
"We knew we were facing a tough O'Neill team," Alumni jun­ior Eddie Villa said. "They have some really good athletes playing for them." 
After a disappointing first pos­session that ended in a punt, Alumni seemed discouraged. As the O'Neill offense made its way down the field, the Dawgs got a surge of hope when they recov­ered a fumble deep within O'Neill territory. Unfortunately for the Dawgs, Alumni quarterback John Lauinger subsequently threw an interception. 
The Alumni defense played tough and forced O'Neill to punt, but the Dawgs' ofl'ensive trouble continued their next possession. 
O'Neill captain Pat Conley picked off another one of Lauinger's passes. This time the Mob capi­talized on Alumni's mistake, and it eventually added six points to its score with a 60-yard touch­down pass, giving the Mob a 13-0 lead heading into the half. 

"We didn't play our best, but we did enough on offense to come out with a win," O'Neill junior Braden Turner said. "Also our defense put up their third shutout of the season." 
The second half was a defen­sive showdown, with neither team managing to get much of an offense going. 
In the end, O'Neill held onto its 13-point margin, giving the Mob a 3-1 regular season record, pro­pelling it into the playoffs. 
"We're really optimistic about the playoffs," Turner said. "We are ready to work hard to make it deep into the postseason."

NEW YORK -Tom Glavine tossed another gem, Carlos Beltran rocked Shea Stadium with a homer that crashed off the score­board, and the New York Mets jumped in front of St. Louis in the NL champi­onship series. 
Glavine shut down Albert Pujols and extended his postseason scoreless streak to 13 innings, pitching the Mets to a 2-0 victory over the Cardinals in Game 1 on Thursday night. 
"Tommy was the key," Mets manager Willie Randolph said. "He just qui­etly goes about his business and he's a real leader on our staff." 
Beltran, who wore out St. Louis in the NLCS with Houston two years ago, hit a two-run shot off an other­wise impressive Jeff Weaver in the sixth. That was all the offense New York need­ed to win its eighth straight game, dating to the regular season. 
· "It pains me that there's going to be an 'L' next to Jeff's name tomorrow. There's no way that he's a losing pitcher," Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said. "Jeff was outstanding. We hit too many balls in the air." 
After rain postponed the opener Wednesday night, the Cardinals bumped up ace Chris Carpenter, who will pitch on regular rest Friday night in Game 2. Rookie right-hander John Maine will be on the mound for the Mets. 
Missing injured starters Pedro Martinez and Orlando Hernandez, the Mets are counting heavily on Glavine as they chase their first World Series title in 20 years. The 40-year· old left-bander, sharp and deceptive as ever, has deliv­ered in a big way. 
He threw six scoreless innings in Game 2 of the first round, helping the Mets to a three-game sweep of the Los Angeles Dodgers. And the two-time Cy Young Award winner, who waited 
IN BRIEF 

Riggs takes top starting 
spot for Charolelte 
CONCORD, N.C. -Scott Riggs remained perfect in qualifying at Lowe's Motor Speedway by winning the pole Friday night for the third time this season. 
Riggs posted a lap at 191.469 mph to put his No. 10 Dodge in the top starting spot for Saturday night's race. He also started first in the non­points Nextel Open and the Coca­Cola 600 in May. 
"We knew we had a good car, and we got a good draw going late," Riggs said. "Coming back here we wanted to get back on our streak of qualifying well and finishing well. We can put it right back where it was." 
Riggs edged Kasey Kahne, his Evernham Motorsports teammate, for the pole. Kahne went out early, posting a lap of 190.194 mph to sit on top of the leaderboard for most of the qualifying session. 
Stanton, Smith don't put 
games between friendship 
COLUMBUS, Ohio -They were teenagers, trying to prove them­selves and dreaming of becoming college football stars. 
When Troy Smith and Drew Stanton roomed together at a quar­terbacks camp five years ago, each saw something in the other that drew them closer. 
They were almost inseparable dur­ing seven days of intensive practices. At night, they'd talk about what they hoped to become and how they'd go about getting there. 
On Saturday, they'll be on opposing sides for the last time in their college careers. Smith leads No. 1 Ohio State into Michigan State to take on Stanton and the Spartans. The friendship is bound to go on long after the competition ends. 
"You know what kind of a friend he is from the time you meet him," Smith said. 
four seasons to reach the playoffs with New York after doing so year after year in Atlanta, was just as good against St. Louis. 
"I understand the impor­tance of when I pitch now. At the same time, I'm trying to play mental games with myself and dismiss that," Glavine said. "I don't want to go out there with any added pressure." 
Helped by two inning­ending double plays and a sprawling catch by super sub Endy Chavez, Glavine yielded only four hits and two walks. He struck out Pujols in the first, walked him in the fourth and retired him on a liner to shortstop in the sixth. 

Veterans Sorenstam, Ochoa 
dominate as Wie implodes 
PALM DESERT, Calif. -Michelle Wie didn't exactly steal the show Thursday at the Samsung World Championship. 
If anything, she held it up. 
Starting her second year as a pro, Wie took a half-hour to play the 14th hole at Bighorn with two rulings, a whiff, an unplayable lie from a desert bush and a shot off the cement cart path just to get back to the fairway. She wound up with a quadruple­bogey 8 on the shortest par 4 at Bighorn, sending her to a 2-over 7 4. 
The real show belonged to some familiar names on the LPGA Tour ­Lorena Ochoa and Annika Sorenstam. 
Both waited endlessly along the back nine for the Wie rulings, although it hardly affected their games. Ochoa fired off four birdies in five holes, and Sorenstam caught up with her in the final holes as both fin­ished at 67.

Raiders prepare for Rivers 
Bolts' unpredictable quarterback finding success in preparation 
Associated Press 

SAN FRANCISCO -Manny Lawson knows a few helpful guidelines for faeing San Diego quarterback Philip Hivers. 
Don't read his eyes, don't watch his body language _ and definitely don't slack on film study, because Rivers won't. 
Lawson always admired Hivers' meticulous game prepa­ration during the two years they played together at North Carolina State, and the San Francisco 49ers' rookie line­backer learned to expect the unexpectod during thousands of practice faceoffs in Haleigh. Hivers can be tricky, and nobody knows it better than his teammates. 
"Any time that I was in cover­age with somebody, you can think he's going to throw your guy the ball and you're going to get an interception. and he'll throw it ofT," Lawson said. "Or he won't look at you at all, but throw it to your guy." 
Lawson and the 49ers (2-3) will attempt to keep up with the surging Chargers (3-1) on Sunday in their fourth home game in five weeks. While San Diego hits the game on a high after knocking off Pittsburgh last week, rebuilding San Francisco has another chance to measure itself against the NFL's elite before its bye week. 
And Lawson, the 49ers' first­round pick who played defen­sive end at North Carolina State, gets to test his knowledge of Rivers' craftiness for the first time when it counts. 
"He's a smart quarterback," Lawson said. "He knows what his job is, and he tries to find out what the defensive player's job is, too. (That) will make him so successful in years to come: understanding what an outside linebacker's job is, understand­ing what the safety is doing, how they're rotating. He sees all that, and he studies all that." 
thing on the film or in his mem­ory banks to share with the rest of the Chargers. 
"If it was a stone-cold key I found, then maybe," Rivers said. "But you don't want to get caught up watching one guy, because there are 10 other guys. When you know a guy, it's fun to watch them. You enjoy it, because you remember pulling for them on your side, and now you are trying to beat them."

49ers linebacker
But in truth, the Chargers' pass­ing game under ever-cautious coach Marty Schottenheimer is the only aspect of the club that hasn't bPen a dominant force this sea­son. 
San Diego's intimidating defense is ranked atop the NFL in most statistical categories, while the running game has been nearly unstoppable with LaDainian Tomlinson leading the way. 
Hivers, who has completed 67 percent of his passes with five touchdowns, remembers Lawson's disruptive play in col­lege. Lawson blocked a punt and played a stellar defensive game in last week's win over Oakland, and Rivers only wish­es he knew some special trick for stopping his former team­mate. 
He acknowledged watching Lawson's pass rushing on tape this week, but couldn't find any-
Oakland last 
month. 
As if coach Mike Nolan didn't have enough concerns about the Chargers' defense, nose tackle Jamal Williams might have enjoyed the biggest game of his career last week with six tackles and a sack against Pittsburgh, earn­ing the AFC's defensive player of the week award. 
''I'm really glad I don't have to play that guy," Tomlinson said. "I think he's getting better. He's just becoming more and more dominant, and the way he played Sunday night I think showed the world he's the best nose tackle in the game, bar none." 
Williams and the Chargers' daunting front seven will face a San Francisco offensive line that has been surprisingly suc­cessful this season, leading run­ning back Frank Gore to an NFL-best 465 yards rushing in the first five games.

Notre Dan1e looks for steady in1proven1ent 
PGA West Facility, designed by Norman, offers rare challenge 
By FRAN TOLAN Sports Writer 
After a second place finish as host of the inaugural Fighting Irish Gridiron Golf Classic Monday and Tuesday, Notre Dame will travel to La Quinta, Calif. next week to compete in The Prestige at the famed PGA West facility Oct. 16 and 1 7. 
The tournament will be the third for a young Notre Dame team that began to hit its stride with a runner-up finish last week. The Irish defeated several teams ranked higher than them coming into the Gridiron Classic, but are not completely satisfied with their results. 
"Second isn't what we're shoot­ing for," said senior co-captain Cole Isban. "But I think the sec­ond-place finish will be a good thing for us. It should be great motivation and will help us this coming weekend." 
After a poor ninth-place show­ing in Minnesota's Gopher Invitational to start the season, the Irish have now come close to victory and believe they can com­pete with some of the stronger teams in the NCAA. 
"If we play our best we think we'll be up [at the top of the leaderboard] this weekend," lsban said. 
The event will be co-hosted by UC-Davis and Stanford, which won the Gopher Invitational Sept. 17. 
"There's going to be a strong field," !shan said. "It should be a lot offun." 
The Irish finished fifth last year at The Prestige, played on a course designed by PGA star Greg Norman. Isban believes his team will be close to top form and expects a better result this year. 
"We've just finished a tourna­ment so we're more ready than we were [for the Gridiron Classic]." 
After the Gopher Invitational, the Irish were forced to endure a three-week layofl' beforP resum­ing play last weekend. Being rusty will not be an excuse in California. 
"We won't have taken such a long break this time," Isban said. "That will definitely help us." 
In addition to Isban, the Irish roster for The Prestige features senior co-captain Adam Gifl'ord, junior Greg Rodgers, sophomore Josh Sandman and freshman Doug Fortner.

"We're still trying to get to know each other. We've asked a lot of each other in trying to get a read on our states of mind," she said. "They tend to be self-criti­cal already so I just encour­age them to go out and play their game and we work on what needs to be worked on afterward."

NFL 

Patriots still class of AFC East 
Despite losses of key players, Belichick has New England rolling 
Associated Press 
FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -The departures of Adam Vmatieri and Deion Branch figured to hurt the Patriots. The presence of Buffalo, Miami and the New York Jets in the team's division has only helped. 

New England's remaining schedule outside the AFC East isn't particularly frightening either. 
But none of that kept coach Bill Belichick from sending his players away on their bye week with an analogy intended to keep them from easing up just five games into the season _ their first season in three years when they're not defending a Super Bowl champi­onship. 
"Bill said we're just a third into the season, kind of like a horse race," cornerback Ellis Hobbs said. "As you go around there might be a horse in first and, all of a sudden, coming around to the finish he's dead last. We don't want to be that team." 
The Patriots charged to the front of the pack with a 4-1 record that includes wins over the three other teams in their division. Buffalo is 2-3 coming off a 40-7 loss to Chicago and tied with New York, which was trounced by Jacksonville 41-0 last Sunday. Miami is 1-4 after losing to New England 20-10. 
The Patriots' first opponent after the bye is Buffalo, and they play only two teams in their remaining 11 games with a record better than 3-2. 
"You could feel good about yourself and you could feel like you've accomplished something by being 4-1, coming back and playing a team that you already beat, and go out there and disap­point yourself and get your butt kicked," strong safety Rodney Harrison said. 
.That certainly could happen if they don't go along with Belichick's emphasis on avoiding overconfidence as much as offen­sive turnovers. 
The Patriots still don't have a solid grasp on what kind of team they'll be as the season progress­es. 
Tom Brady hasn't played up to his usual high level. He's still get­ting used to the four wide receivers who weren't on the team last season. Vmatieri, one of the NFI:s best clutch kickers, went to Indianapolis as a free agent and was replaced by a rookie, Stephen Gostkowski. Branch, their top wide receiver, was traded to Seattle after Belichick refused to give in to his extended holdout. 
But rookie Laurence Maroney has been outstanding, joining Corey Dillon in a strong running attack behind a deep offensive line. The defense, with a powerful front line, has been stingy, allow­ing just seven touchdowns in five games. And the Patriots have five takeaways in the last two games after getting just one in the first three. 
"What we need to do is develop some consistency in certain areas," linebacker Rosevelt Colvin said. "We've gotten a little bit bet­ter these last couple of weeks at doing that." 

The Patriots' breakout game came two weeks ago with a 38-13 win at Cincinnati after a 17-7 loss to Denver. They followed that by holding Miami to 283 yards, their third opponent to fall short of 300. With the loss of Branch and David Givens, now with Tennessee, hurt­ing the passing attack, stopping the opposing offense became even more important. 
If they were distracted by the losses of Branch, Vinatieri, Givens and defensive end Willie McGinest, a free agent who went to Cleveland, the standings don't show it. 
"It may have an effect on you, but as a professional player, you have to be able to put that stuff behind you," defensive end Richard Seymour said. "You still have to prepare to do the things it takes to be a champion in this league." 
Harrison's not surprised the team is 4-1 even with some of last year's best players gone. 
"I think it was a sense of Wlcer­tainty," he said, "but, overall, I think that we still felt like we had the core guys here and we can get it done." 
Two of their next six games are against Indianapolis and Chicago, both 5-0, but those are in Foxborough. Their final five oppo­nents are Detroit (now 0-5), Miami (1-4), Houston (1-3), Jacksonville (3-2) and Tennessee (0-5).

The Midland tournament draws competitors from 15 schools, including the 2005 national champion UCLA, 2004 national champion Baylor, Pepperdine, Texas and Illinois. 
The Irish will face tough competition from these top teams including national No. 1 Benjamin Kohlloeffel of UCLA who won the NCAA men's sin­gle title last season. 
Illinois also poses a threat with its No. 1 ranked doubles team of Kevin Anderson and Ryan Rowe. The duo took the NCAA men's double champi­onship last season and was the second team to do so for Illinois since 2003. 
Notre Dame has its share of ranked players as well as Bass is right behind No. 20 junior Sheeva Parbhu. Notre Dame also has strength in its doubles game -something Irish coach Bobby Bayliss has looked for -with Parbhu and Ryan Keckley at No. 36 and Bass and Brett Helgeson with a No. 46 ranking. 
The Irish will not only be led by Bayliss, but also by the youth and talent of assistant coach Ryan Sachire. 
"[Sachire] has been a tremendous addition," Bayliss said. "His ability to influence our guys has been indispensa­ble." 
The tournament begins today and continues Saturday and Sunday.

Squad prepares for a busy vveek of tnatches 
By MICHAEL BRYAN Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's will have little time 

to relax this f~ll break as it hits the 
road for matches with Alma, 
Windsor and Kalamazoo. 
The Belles are coming off a 

tough loss on Senior Night at 
home against second place Hope. 
After falling behind following a 
loss in the opening game, Saint 
Mary's took a 2-1 game lead on 
the visiting Flying Dutch. 
Unfortunately for the Belles, Hope stormed back in the final two games, taking 30-28 and 15-8 victories to clinch the victory. Hope's strong performance was led by Nora Slenk, who recorded a team-high 19 kills to go with 12 . digs. Senior Deena VanAssen had 25 digs to lead the team defen­
sively. 
The win improved Hope's con­

ference record to 9-1, 16-6 over­
all. 
For the Belles, Kristen Playko 

and Anne Cusack both put up 
tremendous efforts in their last 
home games -Playko with a 
double-double of 20 kills and 21 
digs, and Cusack tallying 23 digs 
of her own. Freshman Lorna 
Slupczynski netted a match-high 
23 kills and 12 digs for a double­
double of her own. With the loss, 
the Belles dropped to 14-7 on the 
year at 7-5 remained in fourth 
place in the MIAA. 
Saint Mary's coach Julie 

Schroeder-Biek said the loss does 
not change the Belles attitude 
toward the rest of the season. 
"Our goals are still very much our goals," she said. "One loss doesn't change that." 
Saint Mary's first match of the road trip will be Saturday with conference foe Alma. The Scots are 8-10 on the season, 5-5 in conference play. Led by senior Kelsee Krull, the Scots will look to avenge their 3-0 loss at Saint Mary's Oct. 8. 
Wmdsor will be the Belles' next opponent as the team heads north of the border to face Windsor in an Oct. 18 exhibition matchup. The Lancers, members of the Canadian Interuniversity Sport Conference, have not played any regular season matches to date. 
The Belles road trip will con­clude with a conference match against 7-12 Kalamazoo. The Hornets are 3-7 in the MIAA, one of those losses a 3-0 sweep at the hands of Saint Mary's earlier this season. 
Although the MIAA tournament is less than a month away, Schroeder-Biek said the team is not looking past its next game. 
"We have very high goals we want to accomplish which include the conference tournament, but we can only achieve these goals one game at a time," Schroeder­Biek said. "We're in the home stretch with some tough matches ahead of us, we just need to take things one game at a time and fin­ish strong."

ND CROSS COUNTRY 
Irish hit the road running 
Men look to keep up momentum, women look to bounce back 
By JAY FITZPATRICK 
Sporrs Writer 
After racing consecutive meets at Burke Memorial Golf Course at Notre Dame, the Irish will venture to Terra Haute, Ind., Saturday to com­pete in the Pre-National Meet, another tune-up race before the all-important post­season races begin. 
The men's team is coming off back-to-back top five fin­ishes at home, including a win in the National Catholic Championship (NCC) and a very strong fourth-place tie in the Notre Dame Invitational. Although the team actually finished worse in the latter race, which fea­tured strong competition from a field that included seven top-30 teams. 
The team is led by sopho­more Patrick Smyth and sen­ior Kurt Benninger, both of whom finished in the top 15 of the Notre Dame Invitational -the first race of the season for both runners. 
Although Smyth and Benninger are considered the top runners for the Irish, Notre Dame's most successful athlete so far this season has been sophomore Jake Watson. Watson has been consistent in his two races this season, finishing second in the NCC while finishing 21st against the strong com­petition at the Notre Dame Invitational. 
On the other hand, the Irish women have struggled 

recently to perform up to their expectations. 
After tying then-No. 18 Marquette for first at the NCC, the Irish finished a dis­appointing 12th out of 19 teams at the Notre Dame Invite. The Irish runners were also completely unable to stay in a pack as they had practiced, instead spreading out throughout the runners and falling behind early. 
"Our team was disappoint­ing at the NO Invite. We felt we could do a better job rep­resenting Notre Dame," jun­ior Sunni Olding said. 
Much of the focus in the last two weeks of practice for the women's team has been correcting this inability to run together. 
"We've worked really hard this week in practice," Olding said. "We've really worked hard on running together better as a team and running in a group." 
The team will need to put this practice into effect if they want to prepare for the post season, which begins in two weeks with the Big East Championship in Boston. 
"We are hoping for a much better performance this week," Olding said. "We have prepared to race well and use this as our opportunity to get ready for postseason races." 
Olding believes her team will be able to step up their game this weekend and rebound from the tough loss two weeks ago. 
"We want to show we have what it takes to do well in cross country," she said. "We are going to go and run our hearts out."

Belles open year against Olivet 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Editor 
Saint Mary's hopes to make a splash tonight as it opens its season at 7 in a dual meet with Olivet. 
Without the benefit of a div­ing team, the Belles finished the 2005-06 season last in the MIAA but got better as the season went on. Olivet fin­ished third in the league last season, behind Calvin and Hope, and beat Saint Mary's 89-11 in their only meeting. 
But Olivet's only All-MIAA swimmer from last season ­Jill Lingbeek -graduated, and Saint Mary's is looking for a strong showing under first-year coach Ryan Dombkowski. 

With just one senior on the team, juniors Noreen Sherred and Kelly Tighe will lead the Belles into the 2006-07 sea­son. Sherred specializes in the middle-distance freestyle events, while Tighe is a freestyle sprinter. 
Olivet coach Dave Stubbs is in his fifth year with the pro­gram after collecting 531 wins and 31 conference 
championships at the high school level. 
Sophomores Erin Tramper, who holds the school record in the 100-and 200-meter breaststroke, and Amy Johnson, whose 24.50 second 50-meter freestyle time in best in Olivet history, will lead the Comets. 
After today's match, the Belles have two weeks off before taking on the Hope Flying Dutchmen at home Oct. 27.

In order to keep his squad focused throughout the sea­son, Waldrum devised a sys­tem of rating each players' practice effort, then posting standings in the locker room.

"They have a very talented team," he said. "They got off on the wrong foot a little bit this year, but they'll be right there in the Big East tourna­ment." 
Unlike earlier in the sea­son, the Irish have few injuries and no players play­ing in tournaments abroad. Still, Waldrum said the start­ing lineup will continue to be fluid from game to game. 
"We don't quite have our starting 11 set," he said. "If we set it too early, then peo­ple will just say 'oh, I'm not starting,' and they might not work as hard. Plus we have two games every weekend, so we want to sub and keep

Waldrum said focus will be especially important during fall break, when the team will remain on campus while their class and dorm-mates head home. 
"We're going to try to do some team activities, possi­bly catch a movie or go bowling," said Waldrum of the squad's plans over break. "Also, we're going to have some practices in the morning instead of the after­noon -anything to keep them from lying around all day." 
The first round of the Big East tournament begins Oct. 25 at campus sites. If the season ended today, the Irish would be playing the Friars at Alumni Field that day.

two each by left wing Garrett Regan and center Mark Van Guilder. 
In the first two games of the season, including a 9-0 exhibition win over Windsor last Friday, the team now has 15 goals -it took the Irish five games, including one exhibition, to reach that total last season. 
"We've been doing a lot of work on shooting and scoring skills," Jackson said. "That's the whole skill sessions we ran for the first month of training camp." 
Last season, Notre Dame dropped a 2-1 home decision to Minnesota State (0-1) but won on the road 3-2 with nine seconds left. . 
Irish goalie Dave Brown made 36 saves and allowed only a power-play goal on a turnover in the Irish zone. 
"My main goal coming into this year was to pick up where I fin­ished last year," Brown said. "And to get that many shots, that many variations of shots, you know it really felt good to make the big saves and keep the guys in." 
The Mavericks entered the sec­ond period down 1-0, but within eight minutes the North Star state team was buried under a four-goal Irish onslaught marked by flashy goals and an even flashier offensive unit -includ­ing three goals on the first five shots. 
Regan scored 44 seconds into the period and knocked Tormey's water bottle of the top of the net with his second goal two and a half minutes later. Van Guilder added two at 4:20 and 8:24 to give Notre Dame the 5-0 advan­tage. 
"Obviously they came out and capitalized," Mavericks head coach Troy Jutting said. "I was just trying to calm them down and make sure we kept our heads in the game." 
Regan's first goal came off the rebound from an initial shot by center Jason Paige. Regan col­lected the loose puck between the circles and turned to wrap a forehand shot around Tormey's right pad. For his second goal and the 3-0 lead, Regan received a pass from defenseman Noah Babin just inside the Maverick blue line and took several strides to the top of the left circle before he sniped the puck top-shelf, glove-side on Tormey. 
"We just wanted to get [the puck] on net," Regan said. "Coach [Jackson] has been talk­ing about shooting and if we get a lot of chances, if we shoot it's going to go in. More of our main objective this year is to drive in on them down low and get the puck on net." 
Four of the six Irish goals came below the circle hash marks and two came while inside the crease. 
Van Guilder gave the Irish the 4-0 lead a minute later on an assist from left wing Ryan Thang when he beat Tormey blocker side from the bottom of the left circle. Van Guilder then put home his own rebound from the top of the crease when he stuffed his second chance around Tormey's right pad. Center Kevin Deeth fed Van Guilder in front of the net with a pass from the right boards to set up the 5-0 lead. 
Minnesota State and Notre Dame exchanged goals in the third period several minutes apart to make the final 6-1. 
Mavericks left wing Jon Kalinski shoved an open-net rebound off Brown's pads while short-handed into the right side of the net after he made the ini­tial save on center Travis Morin's left-side slap shot. The goal cut the game to S-1 at 3:18 into the period and was prec:ipitated by a turnover in the Irish zone on a clear-out by Brown. 
''I'll take credit for [Brown's turnover]," Jackson said. "We're trying to work on breakout situa­tions on line changes, and he was trying to fire it out. We had peo­ple posted up on the far blue line, and he just made an errant pass, so I'll take the fall for that." 
Thang capped of a furious Notre Dame break with a roofed one-timer off the right side of the crease at 6:48. Irish defenseman Wes O'Neill secured the puck at the Irish blue line and made a neutral-zone pass to right wing Dan Kissel, who broke down the left side and lured the Maverick defenseman toward him, open­ing Thang on the far side. 
Irish left wing Josh Sciba scored first in the game with a low shot from the point on the power play 14:05 into the first period, assisted by Van Guilder and O'Neill for the 1-0 lead. Sciba received a cross pass on the right point from O'Neill and fired a wrist shot through net traffic and a screened Tormey. 
The Irish power play went 1­for-1 0 as Jackson swapped numerous players in and out of the man-advantage unit. The penalty-kill unit was a successful 6-for-6. 
"It's about evaluating person­nel," Jackson said. ''I've been try­ing some freshmen on the kill, trying some new guys. The penalty-killing is only as good as our goaltender and David Brown was a big part of our penalty kill." 
The Irish will travel to Mankato, Minn., to play Minnesota State in the finale of the two-game series Saturday night. Notre Dame will then take a brief tour of Hockey East, play­ing at No. 1 Boston College at Kelley Rink Oct. 20 and at Providence College Oct. 21. 
Notes: 
+Irish captain T.J. Jindra had to sit out the game due to a scratched cornea. He is expected to play Saturday against against the Mavericks in Mankato.

Talley leaves team; junior's future unknown 
Departure a "mutual decision" with coaches 
By KEN FOWLER 
Sports Editor 

Irish junior defensive end Ronald Talley has left the football team, Notre Dame Director of Football Media Relations Brian Hardin said in an e-mail sent to local media members Thursday. 
"Notre Dame defensive end Ronald Talley has decided to leave the Notre Dame football team," the e-mail said. "The decision was mutually agreed upon." 
Hardin did not specify the reasons for Talley's departure and said Irish coach Charlie Weis will be unavailable for comment on the situation until Monday during his next scheduled press confer­ence.

Irish to play four key Big ;East games away from Alumni Field 
By CHRIS KHOREY Associate Sports Editor 

There are only two weeks left in the regular season, but No. 1 Notre Dame still has a long way to go. 
The Irish (13-0, 6-0 Big East) play four road conference games over the next two weekends against UConn today, Providence Sunday, No. 23 Villanova Oct. 20 and Georgetown Oct. 22. 
The Wildcats (13-0-2, 5-0-2 Big East) are second behind the Irish in the con­ference's National Division. Other than Notre Dame, Villanova is the only unde­feated team in the NSCAA Top 25. 
Led by freshman defender Kelly Eagan, Villanova has allowed just two goals this season.

Irish will also face conferencefoe DePaul in ahome game tonight 
By DEVIN PRESTON Sports Writer 

The Irish have a huge week ahead of them. 
While their classmates are on break, they'll go to work playing five matches before classes start back up next Oct. 23. 
The busy schedule starts with Big East opponent DePaul (5-16, 0-5 Big East) tonight at 7 in the Joyce Center. The Irish (11-5, 5-0 Big East) plan to continue their steady streak of victories in conference com­petition. The Blue Demons hope to put an end to their nine-match losing streak. 
On Monday, Notre Dame travels to Manoa, Hawaii., to play No. 11 Hawaii (13-4) in two matches on back-to-hack days. If the Irish win, it will be their first win over a top-25 opponent this season. 
"It's an opportunity to play against a ranked team and really raise our level of play," head coach Debbie Brown said, "We're hoping to win both matches. It's a tall order, but it definitely can be done."

Notre Dame coach Jeff Jackson asked Arena Manager Pat Klaybor to make three shooting boards in the off-sea­son to train Irish players to pick their shots high into the corners and over the goalies' shoulders. It showed in the team's season-opening 6-1 win Thursday night over Minnesota State-Mankato at the Joyce Center.
