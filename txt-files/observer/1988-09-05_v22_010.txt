IN BRIEF 
Lisa Mackett is recovering after being hit by a car Thursday near the JACC. The Knott Hall sophomore should be out of the hospital this Wednesday, said Father Andre Leveille, director of Campus Ministry. Mackett was cross­ing Juniper Road to buy football tickets when the accident occurred. She suffered a broken leg and some cuts to her left hand and forehead. "I'm concerned with our safety and the safety of pedestrians (on Juniper)," Leveille said. "Juniper is a major road. Sometimes people are not care­ful." -The Observer 
More fat is being cut away from red meat servings by Americans according to the Reebok Aerobic Information Bureau. In 1979, American households cut away about 3.5 grams of fat a day. In 1985, that figure rose to 7.5 grams. Now, however, Americans are eating more meats with hidden fat that cannot be cut away, according to a study in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association. -­

INSIDE COLUMN 



Notre Dame students are too resistant to change 
After spending 15 minutes fighting her way to the keg, she returns holding aloft a cup of the cheap brew of the evening. She takes a te~tat~ve sip, grimacing as she does so, gazing with distaste at the contents of the plastic cup. Concerned, I ask her what is wrong. Smiling sel~-consciously, she confesses in a stage whisper that she "doesn't really like beer." I feel somewhat compelled to ask her why she spent the last quarter of an hour being liberally doused in a substance she doesn't even like so she can spend the next hour pulling attractive faces as she forces it down. When I tactfully pose this earth-shattering question, a look of shock spreads over her face. This is, after all, a party. 
This scenario typifies a common problem at Notre Dame: people's actions are too often governed by others' expectations, rather than their own feelings. They tend to push aside their true desires in order to conform to society's standards of right and wrong or sacrifice an opportunity because they are afraid of what the outcome might be. "He's really cool. Too bad he's a freshman." If I had a nickel for every time I've heard that in the last two weeks I'd be a millionaire. While it might help me with my college tuition, I'd gladly sacrifice the wealth to rid myself of the annoyance I feel at hearing people being written off as unworthy because of their ages. The thought that there are women on this campus who, given the choice, would date a senior who is twenty-one going on twelve before consider­ing a freshman who conducts himself with the self-assurance of someone older never ceases to amaze me. 
It also saddens me when I think of people who close their hearts and minds to relationsips be­cause they feel threatened by the insecurity of what could happen. The guy or girl is nothing like the type you usually date; therefore, the relationship is doomed. They prefer the secur­ity of staying home on Saturday nights to taking a chance with someone new. Sure, you run the risk of having to listen to the excuse that the bodacious blonde bimbo you saw hanging all over the love of your life's arm when he thought you were at home with the flu is really his long lost sister, but on the other hand you could be missing out on a fantastic experience.

another prime example. I would never consider wasting four years of my life and spending thousands of dollars to study something I don't really like and don't believe in. Maybe deciding that a business major was not the right one for me decreased my job prospects, but at least I won't be gnashing my teeth over classes I hate. Cha_nces are, if I don't like studying a certain subJect, I probably won't like the job it prepares me for much better. I may never own a yacht or a townhouse in a fashionable area of London but I'll be doing something I enjoy. ' 
Generally speaking, I have found that the stu­dents at this university are extremely resistant to change. They are afraid that by admitting that a decision they have made is wrong, they are also conceding that they have failed in some ~a¥: Too manY_ p_eopl~ run away from this pos­sibility by avmdmg situations that they have not previously encountered.

Bangladesh floods endanger millions 
Associated Press 
DHAKA, Bangladesh-­Floods have inundated three­quarters of this impoverished nation, stranding at least 20 million people who are eating raw food and drinking muddy, probably contaminated water, officials said Sunday. 
At least 882 people have died since June, when rivers began overflowing their banks in an­nual monsoon flooding in this country of 110 million people, according to newspapers in Dhaka. The government count of 333 dead is widely considered low.

"It is a calamity," Informa­tion Minister Mahbubur Rah-man told reporters Sunday night. "It is a havoc-creating, menacing flood." 
The rivers flood almost every year after the monsoon rains in Bangladesh and India. 
This season, some refugees have found shelter in relief centers or relatives' homes, said government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. But they estimated that at least 20 million people were either stranded in their homes or marooned on small outcroppings of high ground with few supplies.

Indiana lacks personnel policy on workers convicted of crimes 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS--With no state policy to help them, direc­tors of state agencies must rely on their own discretion when an employee commits a crime. 
"There isn't a black-and­white rule that says any crime will get you fired," said Keith Beesley, deputy director of state personnel. 
State employee Mark Abbey, who was charged with felony crimes after a domestic inci­dent involving his estranged wife, has benefited from the lack of a strict policy. 
Abbey has kept his job as an oil and gas inspector for the In­diana Department of Natural Resources. The decision was made by Gary Fricke, division director. 
"I was glad to hear him (Fricke) say he wanted me to stay," Abbey said. "At the time that's all I could see that I had going for me. And had I lost that, it would have been worse." 
"It would have been a prime opportunity to terminate a marginal employee who didn't show any potential," said Fricke. 
But Abbey, 33, didn't fit that mold. His job with state gov­ernment, at least for the mo­ment, remains secure. 
"You can hire someone con­victed of a felony, but you don't have to," Beesley said. "It's a legitimate reason to pass over someone. I'm sure _there are former felons workmg for the 
state of Indiana. I'm not sure 
how many." 
A judge has sentenced Abbey to spend weekends in a commu­nity corrections center in Evansville. He will do so for more than 90 weekends as part of a plea agreement. 
Abbey was charged with four felonies last November. He ab­ducted his wife from the Uni­versity of Evansville campus and held her captive in a truck for several hours, according to police records. Then there was a struggle and the gun dis­charged, causing damage to the truck. 
Police reports characterized the incident as a domestic dis­pute.

Soviet cargo plane aborts takeoff at air show 
Associated Press 
FARNBOROUGH, England-­A massive Soviet cargo plane aborted takeoff Sunday when flames shot from an engine 100 yards from spectators as Europe's top aviation event opened under the shadow of last week's West German air show disaster. 
Soon after a Soviet MiG-29 fighter thrilled the crowd at the Farnborough Air Show with precision maneuvers, a blue­and-white Antonov-124, the world's heaviest aircraft, began its takeoff. 

About 10,000 spectators stood by as a 20-foot sheet of flame shot out of the No. 2 engine. 
A pilot cut the other engines and halted the nearly 450-ton aircraft of the Soviet Aeroflot state airline. No one was in­jured. 
An official of the Soviet delegation at Farnborough said the Antonov-124 "will fly again before the end of the week." The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not immediately give the cause of the mishap. 
The Antonov, 227 feet long and with a wingspan of 240 feet and a cargo bay 21 feet wide, was to have given daily demonstrations during the week-long Farnborough show, Europe's main aviation show­case. 
Organizers stressed that Farnborough's safety regula­tions were stringent. 
Their comments came after the Aug. 28 disaster at the U.S. 
Air Force base at Ramstein, West Germany. Three Italian jets collided during an aerobatics display at a Ramstein air show, and one of the crashing aircraft hurtled in flames into the spectators, kil­ling 51 and injuring more than 300. 
On Sunday, two MiGs, the first advanced Soviet combat aircraft to take part in a West­ern display, took star billing.

Gang-related violence on the rise in US 
Associated Press 
Los Angeles--Gang violence rages on in the City of Angels and street thugs are expanding their drug trade to other cities in the United States despite police sweeps, a new FBI task force and two "gang sum­mits." 
More than 200 people have died in gang-related slayings so far this year; 11 people were slain last weekend, and an un­dercover police officer was shot to death Saturday while tailing suspects in a drive-by shooting. 
Los Angeles County had a record 387 gang-related slayings in 1987, and aut­horities are expecting more than 420 in 1988, said Deputy District Attorney Michael Genelin, head of the district at­torney's Hardcore Gang Unit. 
Drive-by gang killings now average more than one a day and often claim innocent bystanders. 
Community outcry prompted Los Angeles police to launch a full-scale assault in March. Twice since then, they have marched 1,000 officers into the most gang-infested areas on weekends. 
The result has been a decline 
in the overall crime rate, al­
though the gang murder rate 
continues to climb. 
"We're in a holding action. We're keeping the flames from spreading but we're not putting them out," said Robert 

Philibosian, former district at­torney and head of a state task force on gangs and drugs. 
Los Angeles gangs are ex­panding their cocaine­trafficking networks as far as Seattle, Kansas City, Mo., and Philadelphia, law enforcement authorities said. 
"We have people coming from L.A. to sell cocaine, not to start gangs. It's a business deal here, it's not gangs," said Seattle Police Officer Dan For-dice. 

Lotto pot highest in US history 
Associated Press MIAMI BEACH, Fla.-­There's a new multimillionaire somewhere out there, as only one Lotto ticket held the six numbers needed to win America's richest-ever lottery jackpot of $54 million, officials said Sunday. The winning $1 ticket for Sat­urday night's drawing was pur­chased in Longwood, in central Florida, Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul said. She declined to name the store until the winner steps forward. The new Florida millionaire­-or millionaires, if several per­sons shared the ticket--gets 180 days to claim the prize. The earliest it can be claimed is Tuesday, after the Labor Day holiday. The prize will be doled out over 20 years. The state lottery withholds 20 percent of large payouts for federal income taxes, although actual federal taxes owed could be higher. Florida has no state income tax. Players had turned to psyc­hics, gimmicks and other for­mulas to beat the 14 million-to-t odds of picking the six winning digits out of 49. "This became an interna­tional news story. What better way to let people know about your lottery than through an in­ternational news story," Paul said at a news conference. At least $20 million of the week's lottery profits will go to state education, Paul added. Besides the jackpot, more than 1 million other Lotto players won smaller prizes. Ticket vendors across the state reported brisk Saturday sales. "Frantic isn't the word," said James Salvatore, owner of Lotto News in Miami. "It's madness." Meanwhile, lotteries in other states credited Florida's Lotto with boosting their sales. "That kind of publicity raises the awareness of lottery of everyone in the nation, and we all see an increase in sales," said Kathy Rem, a spokes­woman for the Illinois lottery, which had a $21 million drawing Saturday. Florida Lottery spokesman Ed George spoke via telephone on an Arizona radio talk show and said he was deluged with questions from people who wanted to play Florida's game.

P.O. Box Q 
Freshman laments football fiasco 
Dear Editor: 
"Get your football tickets?" people ask me. "Of course," I tell them. Who doesn't get football tickets? "What section?" is the typical follow­up. "13, 16 twice, 17, 18, 21, and 23," I tell them, trying to supress my frustration. 
You won't see me or a few hundred of my classmates in the student section at any of the football games this year. Not because we aren't loyal, spirited Irish football fans. Not because we'll be out of town. Not because we'll be too busy for the seven biggest events on campus. You see, we've been tossed to the winds, scattered at random throughout the stadium. 
Those freshmen towards the back of the line were not issued the standard student ticket books. Instead, the ticket office exchanged our $73.50 for seven tickets, each from a different row and section, neatly wrapped with a rubber band. How considerate. 
You might say, "That's what you get for going late." And you'd be right. I didn't camp out. I had classes in the morning. But another freshman would have received my sorry set if I had lined up earlier. It never occurred to us that we might be placed outside the student section. I guess we were naive to think that as students, we were entitled to sit there. 
"Welcome to the Notre Dame fam­ily," we were told a few weeks ago. We've been welcomed to the family all 
but on unequal terms. It's like when the family gets together for Thanksgiving, and you have to sit at the little kids' table instead of with the adults. It's the same meal, perhaps, but you're not part of the real action. 
Rockne understood the importance of the student body at a football game. In· his autobiography, Rockne writes, "The most loyal support a coach can have--support he should cherish and hold--should come from the student body." Maybe if Rockne were here, he would do something for us. Lacking his intervention, we will have to settle for petitioning the powers-that-be for whatever aid they can render. It's prob­ably too late for our freshman class, but maybe with some better planning next year, there will be room for the entire Class of 1993 in the student sec­tion. 
Roger Hipp Dillon Hall Sept. 4, 1988 

Students should register and vote 
Dear Editor: 
The 1988 election year has proven to be an exciting and controversial time. We have been assaulted by scandal and rhetoric, conventions and stirring oratory. However, beyond the images and superficial questions bandied about the media there is a deeper issue that strikes at the heart of this entire poli­tical season. That is, how, as respon­sible adults, do we participate in choos­ing the next President of our country? The two most obvious answers are, to be informed about the stands and back­ground of the respective candidates and to vote. 

In light of the afore mentioned criteria for participation in the process Student Government will run a dual project of voter registration and politi­cal information. That is, beginning in approximately two weeks in the dining halls and out on Field House Mall, Stu­dent Government will have tables set up to register any student who wishes to vote in the November election. Con­currently, along with the registration, campaign information stations will be provided with literature on both presidential candidates, George Bush and Michael Dukakis. 
Clearly, the time has come for Notre Dame students to demonstrate their committment to political participation in this country. Our mission here is not to sit back and watch the country move ahead or fall behind. Instead, each of us must make a committment to be active in the system of which we are intrinsically a part. Robert Ken­nedy in his 1967 campaign for the presidency called on young voters to make a difference. He said, "The youthfulness I speak of is not a time of life but a state of mind, a temper of the will, quality of the imagination, a predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure of love of ease ... It does not accept the failures of today as a reason for the cruelties of tomorrow. It believes that one man (or woman) can make a difference-and that men (and women) of goodwill, working together, can grasp the future and mold it to our will."

NO students recruit at their high schools 
Dear Editor: 
When I first volunteered for the Un­dergraduate Schools Commitee as a freshmen, I made the mistake of telling an upperclassman during the football season that I really liked U.S.C .. After much rather tenuous discussion, I fi­nally convinced the now dialated domer that I did not like that hated school in Southern California but rather enjoyed participating with the student arm of the undergraduate admissions office. As such, U.S.C. has nothing to do with 
football per se but much to do with the 
spirit behind the football chant, "We 
are N.D." 
Members of U.S.C., excited about Notre Dame and what it means to them, volunteer to visit their high school during fall or Christmas break to talk to interested students about Notre Dame. Since admissions counselors cannot possibly visit every high school where there are students interested in Notre Dame, let alone every high school from which present students come, people who may add much to Notre Dame are not learning important things about Notre Dame. By having students who enjoy Notre Dame go back to visit their high schools, at least some of these students for whom atten­dance at Notre Dame would be benefi­cial are reached. 
In other words, by talking about Notre Dame to high school students of any race or belief all across the country, the undergraduates of Notre Dame, the very same people who chant "We are N.D." become visible repre­sentatives of Notre Dame and impor­tant agents in the constant effort to im­prove Notre Dame's student body. 
Last year approximately 280 students participated in U.S.C., and an enthusi­astic reaction was received from both the Notre Dame students and the high school students with whom they talked. However, considering the size of our student body, the spirit we are known for and the number of people who will return to their home towns for at least one of these breaks, 280 people is a rela­tively small number. Furthermore, visiting your high school to talk to old teachers and friends isn't exactly a hardship situation. We can and should be eager to represent Notre Dame to other people who can benefit from the experience of Notre Dame. I encourage anyone who would feel comfortable to join U.S.C. and make a valuable con­tribution to the maintainance and im­provement of the quality of the Notre Dame student body. If you are inter­ested, plan on attending one of the plan­ning and training sessions on Sept. 5, 6, or 7 at 7:00 p.m. in the Hesburgh Library Lounge. Further questions can be directed to the admissions office on the ground floor of the administration building.

New facilities to make Senior Bar The Club 

This is part one ofa two-part series on the changes at the Alumni Senior Club. The second part will run on Wed­nesday. 
MARIA DOTI 
accent writer Mter a long day of classes, 
meetings, and other school­related activities, students of­ten look forward to their eve­
ning plans--whatever they may be. Money is sometimes hard to come by, so entertainment has to be affordable with a lot of benefits. 
One pastime that many Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students enjoy is an occasional trip to the bars, but as many 
First impressions in letter to Mom 

Dear Mom, 
It's been well over a week now since we said goodbye, and I thought you'd like to know that your son is still alive and well and living in South Bend. I know that first phone call home wasn't exactly the friendliest one you've ever had, but it was very awkward to talk with you on the phone in a room filled with suitemates who were still strangers; eventually you must have noticed how most of my answers were one-syllable grunts. 
These past few days have been some of the busiest of my life. I've moved in, bought books, joined clubs, met people, and oh yes, attended class. The weather isn't as bad as I was led to believe, but then again, nothing short of the North Pole would have been. 
By the way, I have now arrived late to every class on my schedule at least once, which just goes to show two things: one, that some things never change, and two, that the snooze alarm is one of the greatest technological ad­vances of man since the invention of fire. The classes themselves are fine; it turns out that I wasn't the only one in my Spanish class who didn't speak like a native, and I even got by the much dreaded swim test. But already I can tell that classes in college move much faster that those in high school; normally it would take three weeks before math started to become incomprehensible, in col­lege it took just one. 
It's very hard to go from being a senior in high school-­the most knowledgeable and coolest group of people in the world--back to being a freshman--one of the lowest forms of existence. It's very awkward to walk into a room and not know anyone. It's very difficult to walk up to a total stranger and introduce yourself. I spent a considerable amount of time last week doing both. But on the whole, it's been easier making friends than I expected, and I think things will turn out all right. 
Last Friday they picked up our dirty laundry for the first time. The only problem was that I forgot the pick-up time and ended up having to run the bags over myself. In a strange way, it felt good to make a mistake like that on my own. I mean, if I had been at home, you would have made sure that I didn't forget. Here at college I pretty much have to make decisions and mistakes on my own, and that's kind of new and exciting. Don't worry though-­if I come across a problem too big (or maybe a bank account too small) you can be sure that you'll hear from 
me. 
During the freshman orientation program, when I hear the band play the Alma Mater (now my Alma Mater) and I joined the chant "We are ND," I didn't really feel like I was ND, at least not entirely. But as I was walking across campus this week, writing down my impressions of the University's architecture for Humanities class (sample question: "How does this quad make you feel?") I sud­denly heard someone praying "Blessed are you, Lord of all creation ... " I discovered then that I had come across the Grotto without realizing it, and that Mass was being celebrated there. And somehow hearing the familiar words made me feel just a little bit better. I've heard the same prayer a thousand times back home, and maybe it just reminded me that people are a lot the same here as they are back home. 
On Sunday night, when I looked out my seventh floor window, I saw the sunset cover the campus with the Golden Dome shrouded in scaffolding, in the foreground. And I felt if not exactly at home, then at least not homesick.

u\ still a little lonely, but I think that I'm beginning to feel a part of this place and that, well, "I am ND." Love and Go Irish! Ian 
Ian Mitchell is a freshman from Tuscon, Arizona. He will be a regular Accent columnist. 

students know, this can become 
one very expensive habit. The 
management and staff of the 
Alumni Senior Club (also 
dubbed "Senior Bar") have 
changed that image, so that "a 
night out" won't put a strain on 
one's wallet. 
Although The Club may not 
look physically different to its 
veteran patrons, definite 
changes have been made. "We 
would like to emphasize the 
'club' atmosphere as opposed 
to a 'bar,' explained Mark 
Gibbs, student rentals and pro­
motions manager. That is ex­
actly how The Club got its 
n<}me. Gibbs said he feels the 
word "Club" gives people the 
impression that it's more than 
just a filling station. 
The Club offers students a va­
riety of settings within one lo­
cation. Equipped with a spa­
cious dance floor, a quality 
sound system, and a recently 
installed light show, The Club 
is one of few places in South 
Bend where people can dance 
and the only one specifically for 
students. The game room, op­
posite the dance floor, is a 
remote area complete with 
pool tables, electronic darts, a 
new Pop-N-Shot and plenty of 
video games. If Notre Dame 
happens to be playing an away 
game, and you just can't seem to tear yourself away from your television set, The Club's game room has a wide screen TV. 
Sometimes, a hearty appe­tite accompanies your thirst for enjoyment, and with most "bars" you'd have to go else­where to find food. The Club serves several enticing entrees, such as pizza, subs, nachos, potato skins, burgers or fries (to name a few). "Our goal is to limit quantity and in­crease quality," Gibbs said. The managers agree that they would rather have good food than just a good selection of food. 

One little-known aspect of 

The Club's operation is rentals. 
The Club is now offering its 
facilities, including food and 
beverages, to a variety of stu­
dent clubs and organizations. 
The Club may be reserved for 
rental before business hours 
during off days, according to 
Viz. 
Those people who have 

visited The Club already this 
school year have probably 
noticed one monetary change­
-before they even get to step foot 
in the place. The $2 cover (up 
from $1last year) may initially 
turn off some customers, but if 
you frequent The Club enough, 
you can invest in a lifetime 
membership. For $25, you can 
free yourself of that $2 cover 
charge and receive an Alumni 
Senior Club mug, t-shirt and 
cap, take advantage of 75 cent 
refills (when you bring in your 
mug) and special discounts on 
drinks. 
Every night is a special night 

at The Club, with mixed drinks 
and brand beer at special stu­
dent prices. Wednesdays are 
dollar imports; Thursdays are 
cup night (for special "mug" 
owners; and the 50 cent drafts 
attract the weekend crowds on 
Friday and Saturday nights. 
At The Club entertainment is 

performed for the students and ­
by the students. The Club is 
looking for comics, singers, lip 
sync-ers and D.J.s to perform. 
"It's the perfect outlet for stu­
dent talents," explained Viz, 
"and if the students have any 
suggestions they'd like to offer 
us, we'd be more than happy 
to consider them." 
With a trained student staff of 25, the Alumni Senior Club is ready to start off the new school year. "Things have really gelled together so far," Viz remarked confidently. "Needless to say, we're looking forward to a very successful

Miami destroys Florida State; Hawaii stuns Iowa 
Associated Press 
Against No. 1 teams, the Miami Hurricanes are tops. 
"The players went out and took care of business," Miami Coach Jimmy Johnson said after the Hurricanes crushed the Florida State Seminoles 31­0 Saturday night in a mis­matched battle of southern football powers. "I'm proud of how we approached this game, in a business-like manner." 
While taking care of Florida State in impressive fashion, the Hurricanes continued a glitter­ing record against No.1-ranked teams in this decade. 
With the victory in the Or­ange Bowl, the Hurricanes im­proved their record against top-ranked teams in the 1980s to 6-0. Miami, the defending na­tional champion, went into the 1988 season ranked No.6 in the country in The Associated Press poll. 
Steve Walsh passed for two touchdowns and Cleveland Gary ran for one to lead the Hurricanes. Miami used a lightning-quick defense to smother one of the nation's most explosive offenses, limit­ing Florida State to 91 yards in the first half and permitting the Seminoles to cross midfield

carries. 
Hawaii 27, Iowa 24 
Freshman place-kicker Jason Elam, making up for a key earlier miss, hit two fourth­quarter field goals and Hawaii held on to upset Iowa. 
Iowa just missed tying the game when a 43-yard field goal attempt by Iowa place-kicker Jeff Skillet fell short with 21 seconds remaining. Before connecting on his game­winning field goals, Elam had missed one in the third quarter. 
Elam's second field goal put Hawaii ahead to stay with 1:36 to go. His first, a 47-yard kick into the wind, gave Hawaii a 24-21 lead with 9: 58 left. 
Skillet had tied the game for Iowa on a 44-yard field goal with 7:48 left.

Irish volleyball spikes Hoosiers 1n home opener 
By GREG SCHECKENBACH 
Sports Writer 
The Irish women's volleyball team started the season Satur­day night with a bang. Or maybe it was a boom. 
"Boom" was the cheer from the Irish fans at the Joyce ACC as Notre Dame spiked its way to an impressive 15-9, 15-7, 15-7 victory over state rival In­diana. 
After starting slowly in the first game, Notre Dame easily outmatched the Indiana team with an assortment of shots that included power spikes, quick sets, and finesse dinks. The . serving in the first game did not please Irish head coach Art Lambert as Notre Dame 
.. 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES --Reisman Trophy winner Tim Brown returned the first kickoff of his NFL career 97 yards for a touchdown as the Raiders began the climb back from their worst season in 25 years. 
Brown's return with 1:43 to go before halftime followed Vince Abbott's 23-yard field goal and gave the Raiders a 14­
 
3lead. 
Steve Beuerlein, another former Notre Dame standout, completed only 13 of 29 passes for 171 yards in his first NFL start. 
The Raiders, 5-10 last season, limited San Diego to only a 24­yard scoring pass from Babe Laufenberg to Jamie Holland with 3:25 to play. 
Marcus Allen ran for two Raiders touchdowns. 
Bears 34, Dolphins 7 
Jim McMahon, whose ailing shoulder had robbed him of the ability to pass and the Chicago Bears of their inspirational put five serves into the net. The team rebounded with four ser­vice aces in the following two games. 
Senior outside hitter Zanette Bennett, who led the team with 14 kills, blasted her way farther into the record books as Notre Dame's career kill leader. She also led the squad with 10 digs, most of which were of spectac­ular fashion. 
Indiana's leaders were Liz Armbrustmacher and Jill Beggs, who each contributed nine kills. Indiana had a kill percentage of .136 compared to .373 for the Irish, who exploded in the final game with an out­standing .483 kill percentage. 
Art Lambert was pleased with the results of the opening match. 
leader, guided a devastating attack on Sunday that buried the Miami Dolphins 34-7. 
McMahon ran for two touch­downs and led the Bears on two other long scoring drives to keep the ball away from Miami quarterback Dan Marino. 
On the rare occasions that Marino had the ball, the Chicago defense routinely destroyed pis pass pocket, limiting him to a career-low nine completions and sacking him once. 
''A lot of people wrote us off,'' McMahon said. "But we have a lot of confidence in this team. We accept the role of under­dogs." 
"We went out there and played as bad as we've ever played," Miami coach Don Shula said. "We were bad in all phases --offense, defense and special teams. I'm bitterly dis­appointed in our team." 
Neal Anderson scored two 
touchdowns, the second after 
Richard Dent's fumble 
recovery on the Miami 1-yard 
line, for a 14-0 first-period lead. 
"I am happy with the way we played, but we had too many unforced errors," he said. "If we do that against Stanford (the next Irish opponent) we'll get beat." 
"Consistency was a weak­ness tonight," added Lambert, "We would phase in and phase out giving them three or four point spurts." 
Lambert was especially pleased with Junior Kathy Cun­ningham and freshman Julie Bremner. Cunningham, who is coming off shoulder surgery for an injury suffered early last season, contributed eight digs and six kills. Bremner gave Irish hitters 29 assists from the setter position. She also stunned the Hoosiers with a va-
Patriots 28, Jets 3 
Steve Grogan threw for 256 yards and two touchdowns, both to Irving Fryar, and rookie Teddy Garcia added three goals for New England. 
The Patriots led just 6-3 at halftime despite Grogan's 165 passing yards against an inex­perienced Jets secondary. 
A short punt sent up Grogan's 26-yard pass to Fryar that gave the Patriots a 13-3 lead. 
Oilers 17, Colts 14 OT 
Tony Zendejas, who missed two attempts in regulation play, kicked a 35-yard field goal 
3: 51 into overtime as the Oilers took advantage of a fumble by Eric Dickerson. It took Hous­ton six plays to score after Dickerson coughed up the ball after a pass reception at the In­dianapolis 42.

riety of quick hits from everywhere on the court. 
"We'll have to play with much more intensity if we plan on beating Stanford," said Bremner. 
Maureen Shea and Mary Kay Waller dominated at the net for the Irish throughout the match. They had nine and eight kills respectively. The major contri­bution of the two six-foot seniors was their play at the net. They snuffed out Indiana's big hitters with 'numerous blocks. 
"In the first few points we definitely had first game jit­ters, but we settled down in the second and third games," Wal­ler said. 
Senior Whitney Shewman came off the bench to add eight digs, which was second on the team. Freshman Joanna Bruno played well despite game jit­ters. She had seven kills and two service aces along with four assists to Irish hitters. 
"I was really nervous," Bruno said. "I was shaking on the first play, and the first hit came right to me." 
Overall, Notre Dame dominated almost every aspect of the match. The Irish will be looking for an equal perfor­mance against fourth-ranked Stanford Wednesday night. Last season, Stanford was the runner-up in the NCAA tourn­ament. 

Soccer team takes tourney by beating Lafayette 3-2 
Special to The Observer 
The Notre Dame men's soccer team stayed unde­feated over the weekend by winning the Metropolitan Life Soccer Classic in Lafayette, Pa. 
Notre Dame, now 3-0, 'defeated Maine 3-1 on Satur­day and came from behind to edge host school Lafayette 3-2 on Sunday to take the championship. 
In Sunday's title game, the Irish spotted the Leopards a 2-0 halftime lead before mounting a comeback in the second half. 
Steve LaVigne started the Irish spurt by scoring at 
51:00. Rolfe Behrje tied the game 14 minutes later, and Joe Sternberg scored the championship-winning goal with eight minutes left in the game. 
Randy Morris recorded two assists during the Lafayette game to become Notre Dame's all-time career leader in that cate­gory. Morris has 31 career assists. 
In Saturday's game with Maine, Bruce "Tiger" McCourt led the Irish attack with two goals. 
Tom Connaghan started the scoring against the Black Bears 23 minutes into the contest, giving the Irish a 1-0 lead. The score remained 1-0 at halftime. 
McCourt scored one goal at 60:00, on an assist by Mor­ris, then added his second goal with help from Sternberg at 79:00. 
Lafayette tripped Syracuse 4-1 in Saturday's game to reach Sunday's final. 
Notre Dame's McCourt, Morris and Johnny Guignon all were named to the all­tournament team.
