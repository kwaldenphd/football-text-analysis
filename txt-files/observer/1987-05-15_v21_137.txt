Trustees do not alter ND investment policy 
By JIM RILEY News Editor 
The Board of Trustees decided last Saturday to con­tinue following its current policy on South African invest­ments at its meeting last weekend, according to Richard Conklin, director of public re­lations and information. 
Besides hearing the report of the investments committee, the Board also received reports from other committees includ­ing the student affairs commit­tee. 
Rev. Leon Sullivan, author of the Sullivan Priniciples, has scheduled a June 1 press con­ference at which he will tell uni­versities, such-as Notre Dame, which follow his principles whether or not he recommends that they divest. 
If necessary, members of the Board could then meet to review Notre Dame's policy in light of Sullivan's recommen­dations. "The executive com­mittee in concert with the in­vestments committee could act before the next Board meeting," Conklin said. 
The Board, however, is not bound by Sullivan's recom­mendations. 
The Board is following a policy which authorizes divest­ment of stock from firms doing business in South Africa which do not meet the requirements of the Equality of Opportunity Principles, which were formu­lated by Sullivan. 
In November, the Board decided it would completely reassess Notre Dame's invest­ment policy at its May meeting. Sullivan had said he would be making an announcement before the meeting as to whe­ther companies which follow his principles should pull out of South Africa. 
But, in April, Sullivan asked all colleges and universities which follow his principles to postpone any divestment deci­sions until after his June 1 press conference, according to Fa­ther Oliver Williams, associate provost and member of the Board's ad hoc committee on South African investments. 
During June, Sullivan will

41,000 see Hesburgh farewell 
By CHRIS BEDNARSKI News Editor 
For the first time in more than three decades, a Notre Dame president bid farewell to the University. 
Speaking to a worldwide audience of more than 41,000 alumni, students, parents and guests last Saturday, retiring University Presi­dent Father Theodore Hes­burgh said goodbye to the office he has held for 35 years. 
"How does one exit quickly and gracefully after 35 years on center stage? Certainly it's not easy, and I must say that tonight, of all nights, I feel it's some­what difficult to speak when my heart's in my mouth," said Hesburgh, during an hour-long television pro­gram entitled "A, Notre Dame Moment." 
The event, which included the first presentation of Uni­versity President-elect Fa­ther Edward "Monk" Mal­loy to a nation-wide audience, was broadcast live via closed-circiut televi­sion from Washington Hall to 187 alumni clubs at 127 1930's. Dom Helder has worked in the slums of Rio De Janiero, where he con­centrated his efforts on improving low­income cooperative housing. 
The archbishop received his appoint­ment in 1964, and at this time he spoke against state-sanctioned violence and political torture. He-was banned from appearing in the news media by the government for these convictions. 
Dom Helder has received many in­ternational honors, including the Mar­tin Luther King, Jr. Award in 1970 and the Niwano Peace Prize in 1983. In ad­dition to these awards, the archbishop has been recogonized for his studies on a new understanding of gospel Iibera­

locations in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico and San Salavador, according to Maria Miceli, assistant director of the alumni asso­ciation. 
The event also was the for­mal beginning of a $300 mil­lion development program. More than two-thirds of the goal has already been com­mitted, according to Rich­ard Conklin, director of public relations and infor­mation. 
Hesburgh, who will hold the title of president emeritus, spoke in front of members of the Board of Trustees, benefactors, alumni and other dignitaries assembled at Washington Hall. He spent much of his address expressing his feelings about the Univer­sity he has led since 1952. 
"(Notre Dame) is the greatest shrine of our Lady," he said. "I think what we should say tonight is that here, for over a cen­tury and a half, She has been working the most wonderful lasting miracles in the lives of young men, and now young women too." 
These miracles, Hesburgh said, provide him with his most precious memories. "To have been privy to so many of these spiritual and educational miracles," he said, "is a priviledge, I think, beyond counting. But that precisely is the most precious memory that sur­vives all those years, the miracles of our Lady in this place." 
Hesburgh gave thanks for having been present for these miracles. "My main word, in looking backwards over all those years, is thanksgiving; thanksgivng for graces unmerited and blessing absolutely without number, and of course miracles without number," he said. 
"What more could one want than to spend so many years in this wonderful place with so many wonderful people, Hesburgh asked. "How does one describe to those who haven't spent long years here how special, how very special this place is." . Hesburgh, who will give his final address as Univer­

ROTC detachments at Notre Dame will have a new building. The building, which will be erected for the Army, Navy and Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps units, is underwritten by a $5 million gift from trustee Frank Pasquerilla. The building will be constructed near Stepan Center and will include classrooms, faculty offices, supply facilities and cadet lounges. There are currently 791 stu­dents enrolled in the three programs. ROTC units cur­rently operate out of a "temporary" building erected in 1942. -The Observer

Wine coolers are dangerous, Lake County Prosecutor Jack F. Crawford said Thursday. Crawford said that wine coolers, a wine and juice mix consumed by two teen-agers shortly before their deaths, are popular among underage drinkers and very dangerous.

"Wine coolers are some of the most dangerous beverages on the market," Crawford said. "Kids drink them like soda pop or lemonade." -Associated Press

Commencement will leave us with our friends, memories 
It's still a little hard to believe. 
The clues have been there for weeks: com­mencement ticket applications, registration Marypackets from the Alumni Office, y,earbooks that have our pictures in the senior section, "for Heilmann sale" signs advertising all the things that have 

made small, impersonal dorm rooms home for -----------­
the last four years. 

Yet, when I overheard several juniors who had finished exams congratulate themselves on their new status as seniors, I felt just a little surprised -and more than a little sad -that my class was actually graduating and another class was waiting to take our places. 
I guess it's always a bit overwhelming to realize that things go on without you, that it's time to let go. It's hard to remember that com­mencement means "beginning" when every event, from a trip to the Grotto to a meal in the dining hall, takes on the almost maudlin sense of finality, a litany of "lasts." 
Those lasts are almost over now. Today I'll pick up my cap and gown and in two days I'll be holding my diploma and standing in front of the Dome and the Library posing for the rounds of family pictures that go along with this kind of thing. It's what we've all worked for through four long years of studying and tests and more studying and more tests.

$300 million drive for funds begins 
Special to The Observer 
The University formally announced its $300 million fund-raising drive during retiring University President Father Theodore Hesburgh's valedictory ad­dress last Saturday. 
The program is intended to position Notre Dame among the nation's most eminent institutions of higher learing, according to University officials. 
More than two-thirds of the goal, or $203.5 million, has already been commit­ted. 
The chairman of the "Notre Dame: A Strategic Moment" campaign is Donald Keough, chairman of Notre Dame's Board of Trustees and president of the Coca-Cola company. 
A major thrust of the fund­raising effort, the largest ever launched by a Catholic university, is graduate edu­cation and research. 
Among items related to that goal are $10 million for computing; a microelectronics research center ($2.5 million); an aerospace research center. ($1.5 million); and a life sciences resource center ($3 million). 
The largest single cam­paign component is $60 mil­lion in endowment for stu­dent aid. A $10 million classroom building is among physical facilities sought. 
Another $35.5 million is targeted for enhancement of student life, including new residence halls, social facilities and student life programs. 
Three million dollars is set aside for restoration of Sa­cred Heart Church. 
"Notre Dame: A Strategic Moment" is the fifth major fund-raising endeavor for the University since 1960, and its $300 million goal exceeds the total of $289.6 million raised in the four previous campaigns. 
During Hesburgh's presidency, which began in 1952, Notre Dame's endow­ment has gone from $9 mil­lion to more than $400 mil­lion and annual voluntary support from $1.1 million to $48.3 million. 
Valedictorians to address classes 
By SANDY CERIMELE Assistant Saint Mary's Editor 
The valedictorians of Saint Mary's and Notre Dame will address their classmates, families and faculty at com­mencement ceremonies this weekend. 
Saint Mary's valedictorian, Laura Milligan said that in her speech, she will thank the people who have contributed to her success at Saint Mary's. 
"I hope to represent the class and identify with them, includ­ing my experiences here," Mil­ligan said. 
Milligan will speak at Saint Mary's commencement cere­mony slated for Saturday after­noon. 
John Zic, Notre Dame valedictorian, will speak at commencement excercises Sunday afternoon. "My speech begins with a story, takes you on a journey and says good­bye," he said. 
Milligan, an education major from Arlington Heights, Ill., 
earned  a 3.97  grade  point  
average.  
Zic,  a  science  pre­ 

professional major from Oak Lawn, Ill., earned a 3.983 grade point average. 
The students were chosen by their administrators on the sole basis of having the highest of cumulative grade point average at their schools. 
The students attributed their academic success to hard work and organization, yet the honor took them both by surprise. 
"I just wanted to get the most out of the school I attended. I knew my grades were high enough, but I didn't seriously consider myself a candidate," said Milligan. 
Zic said he assuined someone else had a 4.0 because "two­thirds of graduating valedic­torians probably have a 4.0." However, he added, "I knew exactly what had to be done, and I learned how to play the game quickly." 
Milligan was a student teacher at Harris School in Granger, Ind. The experience prepared her to take the Na­tional Teachers Exam, which certifies her as a teacher. She is presently interviewing in her hometown and expects to be notified at the end of May. She hopes to teach one of the pri­mary grades. 
Zic said he will attend Van­derbilt University School of Medicine in the Fall, on a full four-year scholarship from the university.

Fraternity inducts new members 
By KEVIN BECKER Editor-in-Chief 
The Notre Dame chapter of Phi Beta Kappa will induct 73 new members into its frater­nity Saturday at 11:30 a.m. in the Library Auditorium. 
Founded on Dec. 5, 1776, Phi Beta Kappa was the first soci­ety to have a Greek letter name and is a national fraternity devoted to honoring academic achievment and excellence in the pursuit of a liberal educa­tion. 
"We evaluate students' files 
who have excelled academi­
cally and check to see if they 
have undertaken a truly liberal 
education," said Professor 
Walter Nicgorski, Notre Dame 
chapter secretary. "After eval­
uation of their vitae, their 
names are proposed to the gen­
eral chapter for induction or 
objection.'' 
This year's new members are students from the College of Arts and Letters and the Col­lege of Science and generally have a grade point average above 3.7, the chapter's cutoff point for consideration as a member. 
Seventy one of the initiates are graduating seniors; the other two are graduates. 
Notre Dame's standards for membership are rather strin­gent compared to those of other chapters nationally, Nicgorski said. 
"There are general national guidelines for acceptance into the fraternity, but our chapter seems to keep some very high standards compared to others across the country," he said. 
This year's initiation cere­mony will include several traditional exercises such as the Administration of the Promise, the presentation of in­itiates for certificates and the explanation of the Phi Beta Kappa key. The speaker for the ceremony will be University President-elect Edward "Monk" Malloy. 
The first members of the Notre Dame chapter of Phi Beta Kappa were inducted in May of 1968.

Courier says he helped North get Contras money, weapons 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -National Security Council Aide Lt. Col. Oliver North worked directly with a courier who helped get money and weapons to the Nicaraguan Contras at a time Congress had banned U.S. mil­itary aid to the rebels, the Iran­
Contra  hearings  were  told  
Thursday.  
The  testimony,  by  former  

courier Robert Owen, trig­gered the sudden resignation of a White House official he impl­icated, Johnathan S. Miller. 
The second week of the House-Senate hearings con­cluded with the testimony by Owen, who gave the commit­tees details of his role as mid­dleman between North and Contra leaders. Owen will return to the witness table when the hearings resume on Tuesday. 
After Thursday's session, Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Senate Intelli­gence Committee, said Owen's testimony demonstrated that North and perhaps others in the Reagan administration were clearly involved in providing arms and information to the Contras at a time when a con­gressional ban on such aid was in effect. 
"It appears that Mr. Owen is another kind of well-meaning person who has gotten drawn into a whole series of actions in a tragic way because the government tried to find a way to get around the law," Boren said. 
Owen testified that Miller, director of the White House of­fice of administration, had cashed traveler's checks from North for distribution to a leader of the Contra rebels in March 1985.

Malloy, who will officially take control of the University on June 1, also addressed Notre Dame's future. "We will es­tablish institutes like Kellog and the Peace Institute. We will allow people to come here for symposiums. We will try to find ways to do that kind of critical research that we have the tal­ents and the resources to pro­vide," he said. 

"We need to explore residen­tiality; the dorm structure that has been so crucial in Notre Dame's history," he added. "We need to expand our stu­dent body, not in numbers, but in diversity. We need more black students, hispanic stu~ dents. We need the resources to get them here in the first place and we need the support structures to make them happy and proud to be Notre Dame students," he said. 
The administrators, staff and faculty he has worked with, said Hesburgh, are a blessing to the University. "To have been president of such a com­pany of valiant searching souls, for so many years; to have walked at the head of this 35-year profession, this is the blessing that I hope to carry into eternity," he said. 
This 35-year profession has left Hesburgh "deepfully grateful to God and His blessed Mother," as well as the Notre Dame community, he said. 
"I leave my future in the hands of God," he said. "I leave this University," he added, "in the hands of Notre Dame, our Lady."

Seniors continue to grow from experience 

Throughout our lives, there are veqr few things of which we can be certain. One of these is the concept of change. No matter what paths our lives take through the course of time, we can al­ways be sure that certain changes along the way are inevitable. Our lives are not stagnant entries that exist aim­lessly in this world. They are dynamic beings whose change reflects the growth that they experience physically, emotionally, and mentally. These changes are for the benefit of both the beings, and the society in which they live. For if it were not for this dynamic, ever-changing characteristic, life would cease. 
Dave Miklos 

guest column 
This weekend marks one of the most important changes of our lives to date, the passing from student to adult. This change, although greatly anticipated, brings with it a full range of possibly unexpected ramifications. The cross­ing of this line is the end of the basic educational process which has been an integral part of our lives for the last sixteen years. The adjustment is not only as a student emerging from a con­quered educational system, but as an adult entering a world with new goals and aspirations. Upon entering this new world, it becomes apparent that what we have to offer is a direct result of the experiences and knowledge that we have acquired in these past sixteen years. Upon close examination, one finds that these experiences do not merely consist of a type of dry, educa­tional growth. But in fact, these last relatively few years have been a pre­cious speck of earthly time, serving to establish not only our intellect, but also 
P.O.BoxQ 
Seniors congratulated on a job well done 
Dear Graduating Seniors: 

First of all, best congratulations on a task well done. We are all proud of your many accomplishments during the past four years, not the least of which is your upcoming graduation. With your parents, may I say to one and all, well done; we are proud of you. 
We are bending every effort to make the greatest weekend for you and your families. In a very true way, it is always the best weekend of the year, full of pride, joy, satisfaction, hope, anticipa­tion, and a bit of nostalgia, too. What will life be like for you at your five year reunion in 1992? Even better, I trust, as you gather five years from now to swap stories: How the jobs went, how the marriages came to be, how the next generation of Domers are doing here, and maybe even, what happened to Fa­ther Ted? 
We have a distinguished speaker and an impressive list of honorary doctors who will join your class. I know you will join me in giving President Bok of Harvard and our other distinguished the emotional and spiritual traits which fomprise the entire person. 
Within this mere tick of the universal clock, we have had the chance to dis­cover ourselves. But, more important­ly, we have had the opportunity to ex­perience others, and to draw upon those experiences. Perhaps the biggest fac­tor influencing the graduates that sit anxiously awaiting this weekend's com­mencement, is the impact of the many special personal relationships that have been established here at Notre Dame. For it is the unique people at this University, which not only share their ideas, emotions and friendships on a personal basis, who are the source of the unique spirit and pride which we all know as Notre Dame. 
As an incoming freshman, each of us entered the Notre Dame community with a series of expectations and an­ticipations. We were thrust into a foreign atmosphere consisting of dorms, dining halls, and Emil. Com­plicating the situation even further, was the new, and seemingly infinite community of unique people. Through the next four years we were to realize that these people are Notre Dame's most precious commidity. The four years which have comprised our Notre Dame experience, have consisted of many transitions. These many transi­tions have carried us through our phases of inevitable growth. But, in­herent in these transitions are the dear friends that have made them possible. As we continue throughout our lives, these transitionary phases may seem to meld together, the knowledge ac­quired may gradually slip, and the grades earned eventually forgotten. But, the most treasured aspect of our lives at Notre Dame, the many friends that we have acquired, will persist forever. 
Thus it was a great honor to be entrusted with the stewardship of the Class of 1987, and we thank you for al­lowing us to serve you as your class officers. Three years ago, Jim, Annie, Mark, and Dave established a commit­ment to excellence in the class office that has been emulated by each succeeding administration. Class unity was designated as the one goal to which all activities were directed, and this has been maintained ever since. The class budget has tripled sinced then, but the commitment to promoting class unity continues. So it is appropriate that on this weekend of changes that we reded­icate ourselves to the promotion of class unity through the continuing Notre Dame community called the alumni. 
The Class of 1987 will continue to exist as long as the friendships developed at Notre Dame flourish, and we will recon­vene every five years to celebrate our love for each other, our God, and our alma mater. Fred Nelson will keep us informed of friends who have married, relocated, borne children, and eventu­ally, died. We will share these events with each other through the Notre Dame Alumni Magazine. At the end of each Class of 1987 column will be Fred's address to which more information can be sent. Please share your lives with us. We will also compose two newslet­ters each year that will feature the class news in a looser format: anec­dotes, gossip, and "true stories." Fred will also be the vehicle for this effort. 
We look forward to our first return as alumni, to cheer for old Notre Dame, to legitimately tailgate in Green Field and to rekindle a candle at the Grotto. We will sponsor a pre-reunion reunion on September 19, the Michigan State game weekend. We realize that not everyone will not receive tickets for 
guests a typical Notre Dame welcome. Let's save the champagne and fire crackers for after the ceremony. I am sure you will make your graduation a truly class event that will be one of the best ever. 
I have always found graduations both touching and moving. The thought of so many of you launching your life's careers, the realization of your family's and your own hopes and dreams for this happy day, the joy of past accomplish­ments joined with future hopes ­horizons stretching all across this world for many years to come, this indeed is a moment to remember and to celebrate with those you love best. 
I would like to give you a parting thought from Fyodor Dostoyevsky's "The Brothers Karamazov." 
"We will remember ... all our lives. And even if we are occupied with im­portant things, even if we attain honor or fall into misfortune -still let us re­member how good it was once here, when we were all together, united by a good and kind feeling which made us, for the time ... better perhaps than we are... " 
"You must know that there is nothing higher and stronger and more wholesome and good for life in the fu­ture than some good memory. People talk to you a great deal about your edu­cation, but some good sacred memory.. .is perhaps the best educa­tion. If a man carries many such memories with him into his life, he is safe to the end of his days." 
My best hopes and prayers go with you as we complete our time here to­gether. I'll be back, God willing, and the river not rising, but then, so will all of you. God be with you, one and all. 
Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C. President 
Father Malloy gives advice for the future 
To the Class of 1987: 
Congratulations on the successful completion of your undergraduate degree here at Notre Dame. I know that you have had your moments of struggle and pain, but I hope that in retrospect the good times seem predominate -the friendships made, the insights gained and the service rendered. You have en­riched us with your presence and I know that you will carry a bit of the this game, but come celebrate our friendships and share new lives. We will inform you about the weekend ac­tivities in the first newsletter to come out in late August, but mark your calen­dar and ticket application now. 
Our four years at Notre Dame was an opportunity made possible for most of us through our parents' love and dedication. We each share our ap­preciation for our parents' sacrifices in different ways, and this weekend which celebrates our achievements at Notre Dame, away from our families, really celebrates our parents' successses. They have established and developed values and ethics that have prepared us for the obligations of friendship, re­ligion, scholarly works, and the chal­lenges and responsibilities of life. So we dedicate this Commencement Weekend to our parents in apprecia­tion, thanks and love. We love you. 
Each of us will depart with a lump in our throat, and tears in our eyes. Isn't it wonderful that it hurts so much to leave, that life-long friendships have been established and must now survive separation, that Notre Dame has be­come God's sanctuary, and that we realize the moral and ethical responsi­bilities that we must now commit our­selves? It is a sad and difficult weekend, but this pain stands as a tes­timony to the awesome four years preceding. 
Commencement is a weekend of changes but not endings. Say goodbye, but promise to return. Be happy for the opportunity of new life challenges, but never forget Our Lady and her home, Notre Dame. 
Dave Miklos is the President, Melissa Moody is the Vice President, Fred Nel­son is the Secretary, and Ed LaHood is the Treasurer of the Class of 1987. 
place wherever you go. 
The future will be full of determina­tive choices -whether to marry or remain single, what kind of career to pursue, how to allow God a fitting place, and how much responsibility to assume for resolving the great issues of the day. Do not be afraid to take some risks. 
You are now a life-time member of the Notre Dame family. Get involved with your local alumni club. Stay inter­ested in what is happening on campus and come back to visit us frequently. Notre Dame is only as good as its people. We will continue to depend upon your counsel, your criticism and your support in the years ahead. May God be with you. 
Reverend Edward A. Malloy, C.S.C. President-Elect

The summer after senior year. A time for transition. A time of uncertainty. 
Donald Royal and Scott Hicks will get a hint of what is in store for them on June 22, the day the NBA holds its an­nual player draft of college players. But draft day will not provide any clear answers for either of the Notre Dame grads. 
"Both of them are very nice college players," said Marty Blake, head of NBA scouting services. "But with some teams still in playoffs, they haven't even had a chance to do a lot of scouting." 
Given the usual surprise picks on draft day, it is nearly impossible to tell exactly where the two Irish players will get drafted. Most observers, feel that Royal will go anywhere from late in the first round to early in the second, while Hicks should be taken in one of the late rounds. 
"I'm going to get the oppor­tunity, and that's all I can ask," said Royal. "From there it's up to me. It's always been a dream of mine to play in the NBA, and I'll have the oppor­
"If I had a choice, I'd like to go to a team on the West Coast. I would also like to be drafted by a team that wants to run, because I think my game is more suited to an up-tempo style." 
Royal showed marked im­provement every season at Notre Dame and finished his final regular season with a team-leading 15.7 scoring average and 6.9 rebounding mark. He shot over 57 percent from the field and 82 percent from the foul line. 
Hicks rebounded from a dis­appointing junior year to average 11.3 points and 3.2 rebounds per game. 
Notre Dame head basketball coach, Digger Phelps, says that both players could fit in if drafted by the proper teams, but that the key is what impres­sion they make after getting drafted. 
"The scouts love Royal," Phelps said. "They think he can fit into the off-guard or small forward slot. He'll be a real sleeper. He's going to be one of those guys that if the right team will take him, he's going to make it for a long time because he's fundamentally sound and he's been through 
"Scotty will get picked by someone in the later rounds. After that, it's all up to him. He's got to make his mark and convince someone that he can help the team." 
As part of a team rule im­posed by Phelps, both players conducted several interviews before the basketball season, opening up other possibilities in case their NBA dreams run afoul. 
Ken Barlow was the last Notre Dame player to be drafted in the first round. He was taken by the Los Angeles Lakers last year with the final pick of the first round. He was then traded to the Atlanta Hawks, but played in Italy. 
Blake said Navy center David Robinson is the likely bet for the first pick. Robinson, however, has two years of Navy service remaining, and will not be eligible to play until that service is completed. Any team that picks him has until next year's draft to sign him. After that he is eligible for the draft again. 
Other players that figure to go very early include Geor­getown forward Reggie Wil­liams and Ohio State forward Dennis Hopson.

Faust 
continued from page 16 
officially ended, Gerry Faust had resigned as head coach and the final regular season game was an embarrassing 58-7 loss to a low-class team. But rays of hope began to shine before we left campus for Thanksgiv­ing break as the University named Lou Holtz as the new coach. Our enthusiasm began to swell -cautiously. 
Things didn't turn out much better with Digger Phelps and his squad. Hopes were high after last season's showing in the tournament and Phelps was counting on four key seniors to lead the way. The regular season saw an inspired victory against Syracuse in the famed Carrier Dome -supposedly an arena where no one leaves alive. But the Irish would also be dealt a heartbreaking 75-74 loss to Duke and a crushing 73­61 loss to North Carolina. We finished the season strong with a 23-5 record and we were off to play the University of Arkansas-Little Rock, a team none of us had actually heard of. But soon, we knew them all too well. The team never seemed to get things going in Minneapolis that day, and the predictions of getting to the "Sweet Sixteen" were just wishful thinking as we fell 90­83.

Irish to take summer tour 
By DENNIS CORRIGAN Sports Editor 
Like many Notre Dame stu­dents, the Notre Dame men's basketball squad has planned a summer vacation, a European vacation. The Irish are tentatively scheduled to play 10 games in Yugoslavia and Italy starting May 24 and ending June 6. 
The Irish will play the Yugos­lavian national team as well as Yugoslavian club teams. The team will make a sidetrip to Trieste, Italy, for a pair of games. 
Under NCAA rules, a school is permitted one foreign trip every four years. This marks the third time that Notre Daem has traveled to Yugoslavia. The Yugoslavian club team Sibenik, who the Irish beat in an exhibition game to open the 1986-87 season, will host the the tour. 
This will be the first oppor­tunity that Phelps will have to see freshman Keith Robinson in an Irish uniform. Robinson, who sat out this season under the provisions of Proposition 48, has been declared eligible by the NCAA following an ap­peal from Notre Dame, accor­ding to Athletic Department spokesman John Heisler. 
David Rivers, who under­went surgery following the NCAA Tournament to correct complications stemming from last fall's auto accident, has been given the green light to play from doctors, according to Heisler. How much time he will see is uncertain. 
Sullivan captured the individ­ual title.. .In track, fellow junior Robert Nobles teamed with John McNelis, Jeff Van Wie, and Jim Tyler to place third in the NCAA indoors in the 4x800 relay. 
SENIOR YEAR 
We've just completed our final year and the first year of the Holtz era. The new head coach didn't make any prom­ises, but did show a new sense of pride and a new excitement both on and off th~ field (what football player -or student -did not enjoy those 6 a.m. puke runs). Nevertheless, our senior year was filled with close com­ebacks and heartaches. And it all began against Michigan. Who will ever forget the won­derful officiating in the end zone and the dissappointing 24­23 loss to the second ranked team in the country. Or the sad feelings we all had rumbling through our bodies after the Pittsburgh, Penn State and Louisiana State losses. Yet, someone, somehwere was not going to let the class of '87 graduate without one glorious moment on the football field. Fittingly, it was the last game of the season and it was a come­from-behind win in the tradi­tional Notre Dame honor. Despite the fact that the CBS cameras missed the action we all knew when they came back to the air and we saw the hoards of white jerseys swarm­ing the field. Finally the luck of the Irish had turned and we went out winners. 
The basketball season was now ahead of us and unfortun­ately it looked as if our hopes would be dashed once again ­this time, before the season even began. In August, David Rivers was involved in a near­fatal accident and no one was sure what the outcome would be. It was that incident that sparked the emergence of two seniors on the squad -Donald Royal and Scott Hicks. Their 


The Irish lost in their last bowl appearance to the SMU Mustangs in the Aloha Bowl. Two 5-6 
leadership on and off the court sparked the team to "Giant Kil­ler" status. Will the A&CC ever see a contest like that Febuary 1 game against the top-ranked North Carolina? Or a near game-losing technical called on the crowd? There also was the downing of Duke and DePaul in the "friendly con­fines" giving us more than enough reasons to celebrate. Irish finished 22-7 and after get­ting by two stingy opponents in postseason play, Digger Phelps had to take his squad into Bren­dan Byrne Arena for a third-round contest against none other than the Tarheels. The Meadowlands have never been good to the Irish and this time was no different as the team went down in defeat. 74-68. This squad had most certainly met with great adversity from the beginning, but like the football team, did not give up in the end. 
ALSO'S... In fencing, it was the women's team this time that took the national champi­onship after a successful 19-0 regular season. The men would finish fourth as a team, but senior Charles Higgs­Coulthard would become only the second four-time All­American in fencing history at Notre Dame.. .In field hockey, senior classmate Corrine DiGiacomo became the school's leading scorer with a finaltally of 68 goals ... Suzanne DeVine finishes her term with the Irish swimming program after setting six individual Uni­versity records ... The Irish lacrosse team was paced by senior John McLachlan who had an outstanding year with 48 points, on 19 goals, and 29 
assists. Those assists tie him for the school record in a season and rank him in the na­tional top ten for that category. 
As we enter the "fifth quar­ter" of our game, we now are officially alumni -and some of us may even show up to tail­gaters in loud plaid pants. But one thing will always tie us to­gether ... No matter how far away from the Dome we roam, the Notre Dame athletic tradi­tion will always be with us. Re­member, the people that graced us with all these memories are our classmates and friends -those we ate with, walked to class with, and laughed with. That's a Notre Dame moment that will never be written in the books -only in the hearts of the members of the class of '87.

By DENNIS CORRIGAN Sports Editor 
Among other things, graduating from Notre Dame means no more camping out for foootball tickets. But if you want to see the Irish this or any other fall, getting tickets is a bit more complicated. 
"Graduating seniors get a free ride for ticket applications year," said Ticket Manager Mike Bobinski. "By a free ride, I mean they don't have to con­tribute anything to get applica­tions. We're shooting for next Friday (May 22) to get them out. They'll be sent to the stu­dent's permanent address that we have on file.

But after next year, the free ride comes to an end. 
"For the next five years, you have to make a contribution of $25 per year to the annual fund to get an application," said Bobinski. "From five years to 50 years, the contribution goes up to $50. After 50 years, the contribution goes back to $25." 
If you're thinking about season tickets, be advised that Notre Dame has not sold a season ticket since 1966, and ac­cording to Bobinski, the waiting list is "huge." 
"Barring something drastic like adding on to the stadium or building a new stadium, we're not going to have openings. If you want to get on the waiting list, send a note to the ticket office with your name and address." 
Seems like waiting in line was much more simple.

The Rutgers tournament will mark the last competition for the men's tennis team under the direction of Fallon, who has been coaching the Irish for the past 34 years. Fallon holds a record of 518-201, including eight 20-win seasons in the past nine years.

Riding high on an eight­match winning streak, the men's tennis team will try to follow up on a successful 23-10 regular season by capturing the Eastern Collegiate Cham­pionship at Rutgers, N.J., on May 25. 
"We know a few teams like Rutgers, Cornell, and a few other teams from the East Coast will be there, like maybe Dartmouth," said Irish head coach Tom Fallon. "If we win it this year, we get to retire the cup, so that gives us some extra incentive." 
Notre Dame has won the Eas­tern Collegiates for two con­secutive years, when the Championships were held in Rochester, N.Y. The site this year has been changed to the home court of Rutgers, the team that might give the Irish the most problems. 
teams we did, and they looked strong. Rutgers, Dartmouth and Cornell should be the toug­hest competition.'' 
The Irish will try to win the Championships without the aid of junior captain Dan Walsh. Walsh, who led the team with a 31-2 regular season singles record, has a personal commit­ment that will keep him out of action. 
"I'm sure we'll miss Walsh, but I think we're pretty strong down the line," said Fallon. "We have a lot of depth." 
Notre Dame will be going with Brian Kalbas (20-11 singles record) and Mike Wal­lace (20-9) in the A Division. Dave Reiter (17-6), Paul Daggs (19-6), Sean O'Brien (4-3) and Jim Kilway will compete in the B Division. 
Reiter and Wallace will team up in A Division doubles. The

Gallo takes Wake posts 
Special to The Observer 

Notre Dame baseball coach Larry Gallo resigned this week to become an associate athletic director and assis­tant baseball coach at Wake Forest fol­lowing seven years at the Irish helm. 
At Wake Forest, Gallo will be reunited with George Greer, an old friend of his. Greer was recently named to the Demon Deacons' head slot after coaching at Davidson. Gallo has joined Greer at the Atlantic Coast Conference baseball tournament this week in Greenville, S.C. 
"Whether to leave Notre Dame was the toughest decision I've ever had to make," Gallo told the South Bend Tribune before leaving for Greenville. "Notre Dame has been good to me, and I'd like to think I've been good for baseball at Notre Dame. 
"I never planned to coach all my life, and this will give me a chance to get involved in college administration." 
Gallo finished with a record of 157­167-3 at Notre Dame. This spring's team finished with a 15-29 record, fol­lowing a 7-6, 13-inning loss to Northwes­tern. Gallo told the Tribune that this season's record had no bearing on his decision to join Greer at Wake. 
Gallo has known Greer since the two

A senior's look back on four years of Irish sports 
Like many of you, as I began reminiscing about our four years at this fine academic and athletic institution, I thought about the negatives, the hear­taches, and the losses. But the more I considered our time here, the more I began to think of these past four years as special Notre Dame moments. Let me refresh your memory: FRESHMEN YEAR 
Remeber the first game we all attended (or watched) as official Notre Dame students? It was a contest against arch rival Purdue, and the Irish soundily defeated the Boilermakers 52-6. It seemed like all those stories our fathers told us of Notre Dame football tradition were true. But alas, Dad's immortal cheers would soon die as the team took a nosedive in November and lost to Pittsburgh, Penn State, and Air Force. The Irish finished the season at 6-5 but managed to receive a bid to a post-season bowl. The team was off to the "land of Elvis" to face Boston College and future Heisman trophy winner, Doug Flutie, in the Liberty Bowl. The Irish prevailed, 19-18. 
On the hardcourt, the Irish basketball squad plowed their way through a mediocre schedule to finish 21-12 and received a bid to the National In­vitational Tournament. After wracking up four wins in a row, the team ·round itself in the "grapple for the Big Apple" against Michigan. Digger Phelps and his squad never got into their groove and the team fell, 83-63, to the Wolverines. 
ALSO'S... The men's fencing team went 19-1 on the season and fellow frosh Charles Higgs-Coulthard captured the NCAA individual foil title ... The hockey program was bumped down to the club status and finished the season at 22-6-1. 
SOPHOMORE YEAR 
Once again, our season opener in football was against Purdue. But this time we would all have to board buses at 6 a.m. to watch this home (?) contest. We all settle into our seats and await the opening

kickoff. We watch it sail through the air into the awaiting hands of the freshman returning the kick and then watch as that freshman fumbles it. That was the highlight of the game actually because it gave us the opportunity to see the sensational Tim Brown (he certainly has made up for that rookie error more than once). The Irish lost that day, 23-21', and that seemed to set the tone for the year. Every home game in October it rained and the Irish seemed to play as well as the weather, but still managed to earn their way into the Aloha Bowl against Southern Methodist. We came up short that afternoon, 27-20. 
But our spirits were uplifted slightly when bas­ketball season rolled around. During our sophomore year we witnessed the emergence of freshman David Rivers, who would go on to spark the Irish to many last minute victories -including the 63-62 win at Marquette in which Al McGuire dubbed him a "Michelangelo." Finishing the season at 20-8, Dig­ger Phelps' squad and Irish fans anxiously awaited a post-season bid after a thrilling double-overtime victory at Dayton. We hosted the tourney that year and got by Oregon State in the first round only to face a favored North Carolina team. Fate dealt a cruel blow that afternoon in the Athletic and Con­vocation Center, as the Irish lost 60-58, in the waning moments on a fluke mishap. 
ALSO'S... The volleyball program received a new head coach as Art Lambert took over the helm from long time University emolovee Sandy Vanslager. 
With Lambert's hiring, Notre Dame was showmg a renewed dedication to women's athletics and the volleyball program ... The hockey program was re­elevated to the Division I level and struggled to a 11-16-1 mark. 
JUNIOR YEAR 
And so began our saddest year in athletics. On the gridiron, our beloved team went a sorry 5-6 on the year. It started with a tough 20-12 loss to Mic­higan and didn't get much better from there. The "usual" wins against Purdue and Air Force were losses this time around. We managed to beat USC 37-3 and that always salvages things for an Irish fan, but nothing could patch up the broken spirits of Irishmen on and off the field. Before the season
