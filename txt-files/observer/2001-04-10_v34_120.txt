BOARD OF GOVERNANCE 
Board creates focus groups on women's issues, concerns 

By COLLEEN McCARTHY Assistam News Editor 
Focus groups designed to ask students what kind of programming they want to see surrounding issues of women's sexu­ality, health and violence against women have not generated as much participa­tion as the administration hoped for, reported Linda Timm, vice president of student affairs to the Saint Mary's Board of Governance. 
"We decided to have these focus groups because of the dialogue that began surrounding the 'Vagina Monologues' and we wanted to continue that dialogue on issues of women's sexu­ality, health and violence against women. We wanted to get their thoughts, suggestions and ideas," said Timm. 
About 345 students were selected ran­domly from all four classes at Saint 
Mary's and given an invitation to participate in the groups. As of Monday, of a possible 145 students who could have attended sessions so far, onlv seven stu­dents have attended. 
··we wanted to target the broadest context of students we could get and l would like to see a larger number of stu­dents attend the remain­ing sessions," said Timm.

Timm added that noontime sessions are also being held allowing students who did not receive the original invita­tions to sign up and attend. 
Once the infonnation from the sessions is gathered and the final session has been held, Timm, along with a group of five other individuals from the College, including one student, will meet to look over the data. They hope to determine common themes that surfaced repeated­ly to determine what direction to take with programming. 
'Tm stumped as to how else to get peo­pie to attend the sessions," said Timm. 
After a discussion last week regarding whether the Board would recognize the Notre Dame Student Players as a Saint Mary's club, the Board invited Lindsay Landvogt of the Saint Mary's Thespians Unplugged Club to offer her insights regarding recognition of the Notre Dame theater group. 
Board members raised concerns at the last meeting that the Saint Mary's club was approved last fall and that recogniz­ing the Notre Dame club could take away from participants in the Saint Mary's group. 
"We are still such a young club and are trying to get our feet planted and it's hard to get people involved," said Landvogt. "I hate to say it, but if Saint Mary's students see there is a similar club at Notre Dame, they might be more likely to join that club instead of ours." 
On the other hand, Landvogt said that

"I can't predict what approving the Notre Dame club would do to our group," said Landvogt.

INSIDE COLUMN 
Burrito 

Revolution 
As the recently self-appointed chief connois­

seur of campus burrito affairs, I felt obligated to 
let everyone know what has happened since my 
article ran in the paper two Fridays ago. My 
scathing criticism of the Huddle Mart, as well as 
the protest that ensued, has 
returnedjustice to the world. 
We stormed into the Huddle 
Friday afternoon, with our 
signs declaring slogans like 
"Bring back Little Juan!" and 
"Why have you taken my 
soul away?" 
Little Juan is not back on 

his shelf, as my group of 15 
protesters demanded, but in 
his place was placed our 
new best friend, "El 
Monterey: Half Pound Beef 
and Bean burrito." We obvi­
ously took our small. deter­
mined force and angrily 
demanded thatjustice be 
returned to the Huddle Mart. and we backed 
management into a corner, and there was much 
celebrating as they signed the order form to put 
El Monterey onto the shelf. This was an unfore­
seen twist, and not a bad one. One fellow burrito 
rights activist, John [name wil.hheld for fear of 
reprisal], declared El Monterey to be responsible 
for making 'The bomb burrito." 
However, there is a point to this. I was just kidding. There was no revolt in the Huddle Mart. I did write a thing about Little Juan burritos, and I was warmly surprised when I saw a new burri­to product on the shelf last night where Little Juan used to be. I would like to think that my article might have inspired the Huddle Mart to purchase frozen burritos for the student popu­lace. Which I would find ironic, because I think many students here would vomit at the notion of eating 65percent of your daily fat allowance in one greasy burrito sitting. 
What I find somewhat misguided is the Student Farm workers Alliance protest of Taco Bell this past weekend. There is a way to bring about change in the world. and pissing oITmaybe 16 poor fast food employees is not the best way to evoke change. Granted, the NDSFA did give those who read the article in last Thursday's viewpoint section the option of writing directly to Taco Bell management, which I think is a good way to show your displeasure for a company, if they receive enough letters. Another thing to keep in mind is that it's not like Taco Bell is the only corporation that exploits migrant farm workers. When you walk into the supermarket, do you think that all the produce there was picked by migrant farm workers that make decent wages? Migrants are used to pick pro­duce because employers don't have to pay them substantial wages. Taco Bell isn't con­cerned with how they get their produce as long as it's cheap and not fully rotten. Taco Bell is concerned with making tacos. Taco Bell needs to learn to be concerned with their produce sources. 
The plight of migrant farm workers is truly something to be concerned about. Bringing about a change for them is going to take a little more than spending one Sunday afternoon at Taco Bell making noise and annoying people that just want to get some cheap fast food.

NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY 
Students battle over gender roles 
I.AS CRUCES, N.M 
The gender of Homecoming King and Queen is an issue once again as the Associated Students of New Mexico State University prepares to hear arguments for and against distinguishing which gender can run for which position. The issue now appears in the form of Bill 106 sponsored by Senators Esteban Rael [Graduate]. Heather Johnson [Arts & Sciences] and Matthew Peterson [Arts & Sciences]. Despite being tabled in the Community Affairs Committee, the bill's sponsors plan on addressing the issue at Thursday's Senate meeting. This issue arose in 1999 when Aaron Schubert, a male member of Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals and Friends, ran for Homecoming Queen. Shortly after Schubert's campaign, ASNMSU passed Bill 34, which requires king and queen candidates to be male and female respectively. Rael said it is not an issue of gay rights, but an issue of expression. "If this is meant to target any group of individuals, which I believe the current law does, then that's creating inequality on campus," said Rael.

AMERICAN UNIVERSITY 
Technology used to peak interest 
WASHINGTON 

An increasing number of universities. including American University, are making use of new computer technology like "bubble" images to show off their cam­puses to prospective students. Bubble images offer prospective students 360-degree views of campuses and are becoming an important part of many online virtual tours. Virtual tours have been around for sev­eral years, but the new bubble images allow students to view many areas that could not be seen in the past through still photos. The images are created by a cam­era with a fisheye lens that is mounted on a special tripod, which is developed by Internet Pictures or iPix creates the new images. The tripod rotates at 180-degrees and shoots photos from many different angles. Students at AU think the new technology is a good way to give future college students a view of campuses. "I think its a good idea, as long as it gives an accurate depiction of the school," AU junior Lauren Unger said.

Cruz urges Latinos to puruse college degrees 
By MYRA McGRIFF 
Saint Mary's Editor 
In Monday's lecture, "Benefits and importance of education for the Latin com­munity," Miriam Cruz, for­mer Deputy Assistant to President Carter for Hispanic Affairs, outlined a successful career for young Latinos. 
Through examples of work she has done over the years, Cruz stressed the need for Latinos to go to college in order reach success. Cruz, who was born in San Juan. Puerto Rico and attended college in both the United States and Puerto Rico, start­ed working with children in Chicago. She noticed a trend among those kids she helped -they wanted to disassoci­ate themselves from their culture and home life. 
"A young man said to me 'I don't like rice and beans,' but times have past. But you know what hasn'l changed, a college education can go far,'' said Cruz. 
Giving full emphasis to the benefits of a college educa­tion for young Latinos, espe­cially women, Cruz discussed how to bridge the divide between Spanish speaking parents and their children. 
Cruz spoke to a concern in the Latino community: that some parents do not see a difference between their children going away and staying at home and work­ing. 
Cruz said that for women in the Latino communitv leaving home only happens once they are married. BowevN, because she sees businesses ·like Motorola expanding into Latin coun­tries, Spanish and multicul­tural peoples have an oppor­tunity to thrive in today's economy. 
"What do you think (com­panies] need? Bilingual and multicultural people that understand the needs of the area," Cruz said 
To get Spanish speaking parents to understand the connection b.etween college and success. Cruz provided a solution. The answer rersts in community involvement within the realm mentoring. 
"We ne~d to have more parents from the community get involved to help parents understa'nd," said Cruz. 
With parent involvement from the community Cruz hopes that other mentoring and programming for the young Latino community will flourish. 


McVeigh has last chance to seek stay of execution

WASHINGTON 

Timothy McVeigh's last chance to ask for a stay of exe­cution will be two hours before he's scheduled to die, when he will be allowed to meet with his lawyers for the last time. 
Justice Department orficials. speaking on condition of anonymity Monday, described parts of an elaborate process to handle any last-minute legal interruptions of McVeigh's exe­cution, scheduled for May 16 at a federal prison in Terre Haute, Ind. 
McVeigh was sentenced to die for the 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building. killing 168 people. 
Visits by family members and attorneys will be curtailed two hours ahead of the execution, olTicials said. If McVeigh wants his lawyers to ask a judge or the president for a stay, he must do so at that linal meet­ing.

The protests coincided with a visit Monday from Organization of American States Assistant Secretary-General Luigi Einaudi to try to bring both sides together. 
The pro-Aristide demon­strators blocked traffic in at least three neighbor­hoods in and around Port­Au-Pri.nce, demanding the reopening of negotiations that were suspended when Aristide was inau­gurated on Feb. 7. 
Aristide has sai!l he wel­comes more talks, but the opposition has rejected offers of joining the gov­ernment, saying Aristide's victory was illegitimate because of fraudulent elections. 
The government did not immediately re·act to Monday's protests, but it has condemned violence, blaming the opposition for provoking it. Last week, Aristide appealed for a "truce" wjth the opposi­tion. 
Since March 14, when 
Aristide supporters dis­rupted a peaceful opposi­tion demonstration in front of the city's OAS headquarters, political violence has left three dead and scores injured across Haiti. 
"Recent tensions are a clear sign that an immedi ate dialogue among all Haitians is overdue," said Einaudi. 
Opposition politician Sauveur Pierre Etienne said he thought Monday's protests launched by Aristide militants were timed to show the OAS that negotiations had to be under Aristide's terms.· 
The OAS has been 
unable in two previous attempts to facilitate a resolution of the crisis, which has divided Haiti's leadership since last year, when the opposition charged that some local and legislative elections were rigged to favor Aristide's Lavalas Family party. 
The OAS said 10 Senate races should have gone to runoffs. As a result mil­lions of dollars in interna­tional aid to Haiti has been suspended. 
The 15-party opposition alliance Convergence boy­cotted the election that returned Aristide to the presidency in N ovembi\r.

Police face uphill battle against skyrocketing crime 
Associated Pr~ss 
QUETZALTENANGO 
Seconds after three men with machine guns pulled off a lunchtinw robbery at her oil-change shop, Miram Hodas was on the phom~ to tlrn police. 
Fivc hours later she real­
ized no nfficrrs wero coming. 
"We saw the faccs of the criminals and we wern ready to describe thcm. But nobody came," said Hodas, co-owner of Cifuntes Oil. "Until sonrn­one dies. tbe police don't show up." 
l\1any pnoplP in Guatemala's second-largest city say Hodas was lucky ­at least she didn't gr,t a busy signal. 
At tlw end of March, an unpaid $13,000 bill led the phonP company to switch off four police phonP lines, leav­ing authorities in Quetzaltcnango with just one working emergency phone number. 
While officials insist the phones have been turned back on. an unpaid electrici­ty bill worth almost twice as much could eventually leave the city's 600 police officers in the dark. 
As crime continues to soar in this Central American nation, aulhorities say they don't have the -resources to keep the streets safe. 
The state does not keep 
reliable crime statistics. But Mutual Support Group, a human rights advocate, says 123 murders in the first three months of the year put Guatemala on the worst pace since the last year of a dev­astating civil war.

groups to combat crime. 
Frustration over a lack of policing in rural, largely Indian areas has made Guatemala among the world leaders in mob killings. Since the end of the civil war, vigi­lante violence has killed 157 people. 
"The criminals in Guatemala are better pre­pared then the police," said Fuastino Sanchez, a spokesman for Guatemala's 18,366-officer national 
police force. "Of course we would like to have more resources, but we are doing all we can." 
The budget approved for the police force this year was $10.1 million -$500,000 less than last year. 
Jorge Perez, a spokesman for President Alfonso Portillo, said the budget cut was necessary, given the government's strained finances. He acknowledged there is "no way the police could respond quickly to vio­lence." 
All over Guatemala, it is common to see one blue-and­white police pickup carrying up to eight officers armed with machine guns. 
Of the 6,000 trucks the police use for patrolling the streets, only 2,400 are dri­vable at any given time, Sanchez said. 
Floridalma Godinez, a gro­cer, said she recently had to temporarily close-her small shop in a c,,.wded Quetzaltenango market dis­trict because police took more than an hour to collect the body of a man killed by a hit-and-run driver. 
"The bees and flies were terrible," Godinez said. "And I just had to think that if it takes a long time to come and remove a dead body, the police will have no chance of catching the person that was driving the car." 
Out of control 
The crime rate in Guatemala. a country about the size of Iowa, has grown to such a degree that the police force is having difficulty handling it with its current resources. 


California reaches deal on power lines, relieving debt 
Associated Prt=ss 
LOS ANGELES 
In a bid to pull the state's second biggest utility back from the brink of bankruptcy, Gov. Gray Davis announced a deal on Monday for the state to buy power lines from Southern California Edison for $2.76 billion. 
The deal is a key part of the gove rnor's plan to keep the cash-strapped utility solvent It would give Edison money to reorganize its debts and pay power generators, many of which have not been paid for power since last November. 
"These were tough negotia­tions but they've produced a good, balanced deal," Davis said. 
The deal requires Edison to 
provide power from its gener­
ation plants to customers at 
low rates for 10 years and to 
drop a lawsuit seeking hikes 
in consumer rates, Davis said. 
ll still requires approval from 
the California Public Utilitie/ 
Commission. 
Davis had originally pr ­posed buying parts of the state's transmission grid owned by all three of the state's investor-owned, utili­lies. That plan was dealt a serious blow Friday when Pacil'ic Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility, pulled out of negotiations and filed for bankruptcy protection. 
SoCal Edison chairman Steve 
Frank said the state would 
benefit morn from improving 
the utility's financial status 
than from owning the lines. 
Frank said the deal for the transmission lines gives the state a hard asset in return for the $2.76 billion, But he said the real value was helping Edison become a creditworthy buyer of electric power.

Davis said the amount the state offered for the lines was more than twice their estimat­ed value. He said the deal was worth it because Edison had agreed to sell low-cost power. 
Under the agreement Monday, Edison will start buy­ing power on its own at the end of 2002. The state will continue buying power for the utility in the meantime. 
Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights said buying the power lines was a way for the state to help Edison with­out appearing to bail out the ut,ility. He said Davis "misled t:he public ... by trying to pre

Republican Assemblyman Dave Cox also criticized the Democratic governor's plan, saying the power lines could require billions of dollars in improvements. 
Edison and PG&E say they have lost more than $13 bil­lion since June because of sky­rocketing wholesale power prices. They cannot pass on their costs to customers under the state's 1996 deregulation law. 
Edison also was expected to file an update Monday on its financial condition with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

SmalJer crop yields. Earlier flu seasons. Deadlier and more fre­quent storms. 
In the wakf' of President Bush's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, sci­entists from 25 countries on Monday forecast a perilous future for the planet if emissions of carbon dioxide and other so­called greenhouse gases contin­ue to rise. 
"If we do nothing, we \\ill have a disastrous situation facing us," said Oavid Warrilow, head of research on climate change at Britain's Department of the Environment. Transport and the Regions. 
Despite "vested interests" that want to play up scientific uncer­tainties about global warming "there is enough evidence now that it is worth acting," he told delegates at a conference at Cambridge University.

Ginsburg backs fight to end death penalty 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said Monday she supports a proposed state mora­torium on the death penalty, adding that accused murderers with good lawyers ''do not get the death penalty." Ginsburg criticized the often "meager" amount of money spent to defend poor people, and said she would be "glad to see" Maryland become the second state after Illinois to pass a moratorium on imposition of the death penalty. 
Rut the effort failed a few hours later when Maryland law­makers adjourned for the year without voting on thfl measure. 
"I have yet to see a death case among the dozens coming to the Supreme Court on eve-of-execu­tion stay applications in which the defendant was well repre­sented at trial," Ginsburg said in a lecture on the importance of public service law. 
"People who arc well repre­sented at trial do not get the death penalty," she added later. 
Ginsburg has gone on record as saying she would have grant­ed last-minute stays, or delays, in capital cases. The Supreme Court has at least a five-member majority in favor of the death penalty in general. 
The justices have agreed to hear a case next fall testing whether mentally retarded peo­ple may be executed. 
Speaking at the University of the District of Columbia, Ginsburg also proposed a legal service corps on the model of VISTA public service program that sends mostly young volun­teers to help the poor. 
"How much healthier to enlist young people in this kind of community service than to sign them up for armed combat," she said. 
Ginsburg ducked a question about the Bush v. Gore case that ended ballot recounts in florida and effectively decided the 2000 election for President Rush, say­ing she made hflr point in her written dissent. She was among the four-member minority that supported the continued recounts sought by Democratic candidate Al Gore. 
Politically liberal lawyers, pro­fessors and politicians made up much of the audience at the public, open-enrollment univer­sity. Ginsburg smiled but did not applaud during partisan intro­ductory remarks by B. Michael Rauh, president of the District of Columbia School of Law Foundation.

Jews mark Passover amidst violence 
U.N. enters rebel town 
Associated Press 
HEBRON 
Amid daily violence, hun­dreds of Jewish pilgrims from Israel streamed through Hebron to mark Passover at the disputed Tomb of the Patriarchs and show support for the small and beleaguered community of Jewish settlers in the divided West Bank city. 
Helmeted Israeli soldiers car­rying submachine gu·ns patrolled the streets, perched on rooftops and manned check­points as Jews arrived in buses from around the country Mond,ay and toured the city's Jewish enclaves and its muse­um. The weeklong Passover holiday began Saturday. 
Hebron is the only West Bank city divided into Israeli and Palestinian zones. Israeli sol­diers protect about 450 Israeli settlers who live in three enclaves in the center of the city, exchanging fire with Palestinian gunmen every day. 
The Tomb of the Patriarchs 
makes the city holy to 
Christians, Muslims and Jews 
alike. Strict security considera­

Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are 
believed to be buried.

site into a mosque for Muslims

Struggles of Kenyan streetchildren must be noticed

me a great deal, and each day he continues to guide and guard me. However, his voice is only one amongst many voices in Kenya that have left me with a reason to teach oth­ers about what why we need to help fel­low nations in need. The other voices that ring in my ears are those of the little Kenyan streetchildren. 
There are an estimated 100 million streetchildren in the world today. While in 1969 there were roughly a few hun­dred urban child wanderers in Kenya, currently there could be as many as 30,000 streetchildren in the capital city of Nairobi alone. There are both micro-and macro-reasons for this enormous boom of what Americans would identify as homeless children, in Kenya and other African nations. 
Certainly, AIDS is one of the largest macro-issues because it is the root of the breakdown in the family which experts say is the largest push factor encouraging children to run to the streets. The extend­ed family, traditionally Africa's only social safety net, has also been pulled apart by overpopulation, urbanization and nega­tive Western social influences. All of these factors combined to form the most diffi­cult to trace and intricately woven web of modernity and tradition, two words that are not antonyms but are treated as such in Western culture. 
Journalists write about the soaring numbers of people infected with the HIV virus in Africa but spend so much time reflecting on statistical proof that they are unable to link it to other tragedies, such as streetchildren. When parents and caretakers die because of AIDS, the chil­dren are often stranded since the concept of urbanization and modernization has made it difficult to contact extended fami­ly members. 
Urbanization has also been the cause of kids' attraction to large cities. The con­densation of businessmen, Western trav­elers and big businesses all in one area lure Kenyan children to Nairobi and other cities. The Western values of greater personal independence and sin­gle lifestyles rather than village responsi­bilities have an effect on teens who are at the most impressionable age. 
Whatever the cause may be, the conse­quences of the issue are heartbreaking for those who represent our future. Loving, intelligent and creatively gifted kids are left without the promise of a bright future because they arc pulled away from education. Kids flee to the streets when they cannot afford school fees. Kids also flock the streets when their families need the additional financial support of the small pit­tance the kids can work for or cannot afford to feed the chil­dren enough food. Thus. even if they did not have to pay school fees, they are too needed at home and too hungry to concen­trate. 
Other effects include juvenile injustice in the form of abuse by police ollicers and prolonged detention in juvenile jails hav­ing the most nnsan­ilary, cramped con­ditions. Kenyan policemen fre­quently sweep the streets, collecting and arresting kids who are begging or sleeping in the city. If they are not arresting them, they are bribing or beat­ing them. They are able to get away with it because, in Kenya, "street loitering" is a federal offense, no matter how old you are. 
S treetchildren are a problem that differs according to gen­der. Whereas boys might find them­selves in a position of begging or work­ing as parking boys for survival, girls in the same predicament engage in survival prostitution. Girls are therefore harassed by the police in more fright­ening ways than boys. 
Sadly enough, it is the harrassment and negative adult reactions. not their hunger, that troubles streetchildren the most. Isolation 
and distrust cause them the great­est pain. Once, while I was in Kenya, a police officer stopped a streetboy who was walking with me and helping me carry boxes. He immediately assumed the boy was about to steal from me and chased him while swinging a baton. He forbid the boy to go near any white lady, threatening him with arrest, even after.I protested and defended him. The kids invariably are accused of lying. 
I.ronically. as ostracized and rejected as

In contrast to much or the surrounding culture, they do not distribute themselves according to dilfornnces·or tribal identity. Perhaps that is why it is so difli­cult to discern the vari­ous ages or their many beautiful faces. Perhaps that is why they arc so warm and welcoming to all who are willing to spend time with them. This is another true story: When malaria-infected Vincent of the streets became sick, he was near death. Each day he became worse, lying on one of' the few paved sidewalks of the town of Kisumu, Kenya, growing colder, hungrier and more emaci­ated. After col­lecting enough money through work and peti­tion, his family of fellow streetchil­dren carried him on their backs to the nearest hospi­tal miles away so that he could visit a doctor. When they returned to their usual hang-out with Vincent and medication in hand, they took turns caring and nursing him in shifts until ho became better. No, they are not manipulative, stupid, dirty or mean. They are witty, smart, strong and compassionate. And as much as they have learned to care for themselves, they are only children. And they are our 
future no matter where they live.

Wearing what's inside 
There seems to have been a lot of talk lately on clothes and what they say about people. If you think about it. judging a person by the clothes he or she wears is a lot like the old phrase, "judging a book by its cover." It is what is inside that counts. 
But really, I am sure you aU know that anyway and none of you would ever dream of assuming that because a woman is wear­ing tight or revealing clothing it means she wants to hit it all night long in your dorm room. 
But I rugress. That kind of talk about clothing is not what I want to get into, because things get messy, peo­ple start assuming things, and we all know that when you assume something. you make an ass out of you and me -but especially you. 
Anyway, clothing is something that I have been think­ing about lately, because in looking for a job (which I still do not have) one of the things that I have been warned about is the phrase, "business formal attire." Frankly. this scares me. I don't do suits, I don't do heels, I don't do clothes that inhibit my breathing reg­ularly. On a day-to-day basis, I am in jeans and a T­shirt, or on really great days still in my pajamas. going about my day perfectly happy with myself. 
And you are trying to tell me that in just a matter of weeks I have to give all that up? I don't think so. There are many reasons I am an English major, and the fact that I can show up to class in track pants and a baseball cap and still make a valid point about the idea of the American dream in "The Great Gatsby," as well as have my professors take me seriously is high on the list. Really, it goes for any major. 
So, does the fact that I do not regularly participate in the fashion show that plagues both Saint Mary's and Notre Dame mean that in essence I am a slacker. and a company should not hire me? Not in the least. Granted, playing dress up is fun every once in a while and it is usually accompanied with a, "Wow, Molly, why are you so dressed up today?" It has never been accompanied with a, "Wow, Molly, that suit and heels made your comments and theories in class today so much smarter!" 
I like these companies that I hear about that do not require you to look like you are attending a funeral every day of the week. A friend of mine works out in Phoenix, and his company has the right idea. He can do his computer work in shorts and a T-shirt if he so chooses. They know he is a smart guy, that is why they hired him. They did not hire him because they liked his tie. 
I really do not see the point ofmaking myself uncomfortable in clothing. That utterly defeats the ultimate purpose. I think I will propose that all com­panies make the rule that clothing, while not optional, should at least be option-full. 
If you want to come to work all dressed up and ready to rock the work week, great. And if you want to come in your favorite jeans and shirt that you have had since freshman year of high school, that is fine too. As long as you get your work done, what does it matter? 
ln a perfect world, this would work like a charm. Alas, as we all know this is not a perfect world by far. and people still seem to think that business for­mal means that the job gets done better and in a more "professional" atmosphere. Translation, in a more "boring" atmosphere. 
And in general, this forces us all to spend more than a rational amount of money on clothing, because now, besides that $300 suit (and that's a cheap­er one, too), you have to buy clothes for other times, like the weekends. You know -bars, clubs and other occasions that require the unspoken dress code that we all be perfectly put together, yada, yada. yada. If you think about it, it's pretty ridiculous. 
Hopefully, when I find a job, and I wear my suit I bought for the sole rea­son of getting an interview, they will not even care what I am wearing and hire me because I have the smarts tu be a great asset to their company. Hopefully, when I find a job, it will be because of all the work I have put into the last four years, and not because of how neatly pressed I am. And hope­fully, when I do find a job, it will be with one of the companies out there that embraces individuality and has an office that is not thriving on navy, gray, black and pinstripes. Because honestly, I don't look good in pinstripes.

The excuse used most fre­

However, with her debut album Acoustic Soul, India.Arie manages to display the potential of the guitar as an essAntial element of neo-soul. 
In the late '90s India.Arie and her band Groovement formed an independent label and released an album with some of her early songs. Soon after. she had a spot on Sarah McLachlan's quietly successful Lilith Fair tour in 1998 and was courted by several major labels. Later signing with Motown, India.Arie released Acoustic Soul in late March with very little recognition. 
Nonetheless, the quirky, simple video for her first sin­gle. "Video," has garnered national atten­tion and made her "buzzwor­thy" on BET and MTV alike. On the track, she sings of being the antithesis of the supermodels and booty-shak­ers seen with alarming con­stancy on the same television stations that have generated her earlv suc­cess.

With songs like "Strength, Courage, & Wisdom" and "Ready For Love," India.Arie showcases her strong voice and song writing skills. The latter is infused with the waning and waxing of a single cello while she makes her most soulful attempt on the record. 
Other songs like "Back to the Middle" and "Part of My Life" don't add much to the total composition, but do provide an opportunity for the guitar's presence to be fully recognized and appreciated. 
Fortunately, the pleasantly funky "Brown Skin," in which India.Arie claims "Brown skin you know I love your brown skin/ I can't tell where yours begins I can't tell where mine ends," compensates for any of the album's minor blunders. Her voice low and smooth, India.Arie profess­es a love for pigmentation and creates the vivid. lush images that great songs arc made of. The song is reminiscent of the vibe present on D'Angelo's debut release Brown Sugar and proves that India.Arie deserves a position among those artists of neo-classic soul. 
Though she lacks the hard funk of Me'Shell NdegeOccllo and the quiet soul of Tracy Chapman, India.Arie is well on her way to becoming a champion of her genre. Acoustic Soul is a squirt of flavor in the occasionally repetitive field of mushy love songs and shallow thought. India.Arie, it seems, is restricted by noth­ing: she is lyrically and musically sound, proving her artistic prowess and potential longevity.

ALBUM REVIEW 
OTR reach creative height with Films for Radio 
By GREG RUEHLMANN Scene Music Critic 
The road to musical success is rarely easy. The typical band must spend years fostering a fan base, finding the right label, and developing its sound before it can achieve a breakthrough hit -if it ever does. A band that has certainly paid its dues over the last decade is the Cincinnati~based group Over the Rhine. Led by the hus­band-wife song writing duo of Linford Detweiler (piano. keyboard) and Karin Bergquist (vocals, guitar), the group has endured record label problems and the departure of two band members. But judging from their new release, Films for Radio, all of OTB's struggles are finally about to pay off. 
Over the Rhine -named after Cincinnati's poorest inner-city neighborhood -got its start in 1989 playing at clubs like Sudsy Malone's, the Queen City's infamous laundroma1/ alternative music venue. The band's unique blend of folk, rock, pop and blues propelled it to the forefront of a vibrant Cincinnati music scene with the likes of The Afghan Whigs, The Ass Ponys and Blessid Union of Souls. Eleven years and seven albums later, OTR's hometown popularity and small but devoted national following continue to grow. 
Through the years, the group has dealt with its fair share of difficulties. In 1996. it lost its record deal when the label I.R.S. disappeared in the midst of massive industry restructuring. Later that year, two of'the band's four founding members left to pursue other opportuni­ties. But Bergquist and Detweiler pressed on. They hired new musicians and continued to record music. 
Through their own independent label, they distributed OTH's music, including the original band's final album, the independent classic Good Dog Bad Dog. The couple performed on "CBS This Morning" in late 1998 and gri­maced as the host described Over the Rhine as "one of America's great unsigned bands." Fortunately, that "unsigned" was dropped

..... ; ...-l,
and should translate better to popular 
radio than any of Over the Rhine's previous works. The album resounds as a triumph for Over the Rhine and a landmark in the group's musi­cal development. 
Films for Radio gets off to a great start with the track "The World Can Wait." Don Heffington's pounding per­cussion and Detweiler's keyboards give the song a mysti cal quality that sets the perfect tone for the rest the record. "The World Can Wait" leads into other memo­rable songs such as "Give Me Strength," "Little Blue River," and "Goodbye." 
"Give Me Strength" represents quite a departure for OTR, and has already earned significant airplay on alternative stations across the country. Co-written by Dido, it is a slightly dark, introspective piece, textured with rich electronic rhythms rather than piano and gui­tar. The refrain is an anthem of determination: "Give me strength to find the road that's lost in me/ Give me time to heal and build myself a dream/ Give me eyes to see the world surrounding me/ Give me strength to be only me." 
"Little Blue River" is a classic Over the Rhine number -bluesy and totally intoxicating, Detweiler plays some spectacular piano on this track. The line "Roll me over that little blue river now, church child" will be stuck in music fans' minds for a long time to come. "Little Blue River" is followed by "Goodbye," which sounds like the wistful pop of Over the Rhine's early days. lt examines the daily uncertainty of life, ultimately finding a shimmer of hope as Bergquist exclaims, "This is not goodbye." 
OTR closes Films for Radio with the showstopper "When I Go." The band's lyrics have never sounded so passionate, or so melancholy. Bergquist has one of the world's most beautiful voices, and she uses it to carry this song entirely by herself. She cries out for validation, "I want to know/ Will it make a difference/ When I go?" as Detweiler and guitarist Jack Henderson softly com­plement her singing. "When I Go" ends the album as strongly as "The World Can Wait" began it. 
With Films for Radio, Over the Rhine has achieved new heights of' creativity. Hopefully, the album will also take the band to new heights of popular success. In a world where mainstream music has gone so stale, the artistry of a band like OTR should be warmly welcomed. 
ALBUM REVIEW 
Double album showcases DiFranco's diversity 
By MAUREEN SMITHE Scene Music Critic 
Often described as a jazz, funk, soul, rock and folk artist, Ani DiFranco contin­ues to defy generalizations. Her newest album, Revelling/Reckoning, leaves listen­ers with this same conundrum -who is Ani Difranco? 
Experimenting with a wide range of gui­tars, from electric to acoustic, Difranco successfully reveals her dynamic and unique musical strengths in this special double album. Clearly different and divid­ed, the two discs play off of each other in an attempt to define the many experiences that have made Difranco the musician she is today. 
The first disc in the set, Revelling, opens with the bluesy shuffle "Ain't That The Way." Like every other track on this disc, this song demonstrates DiFranco's intellec­tual and poetic lyric ability: "I gotta beeline double time/ Leave my home sweet home for your honeycomb." The groove heard in "Ain't That The Way" continues through­out the disc. 
Revelling literally reveals the wide span of musical context in which Difranco develops her music. Ranging from solo acoustic numbers to songs with a strong band back up, this CD is the more jazzy of the two. 
In addition to her newly embraced vin­tage jazz-singer pitches, "What How When Where (Why Who)" features some well placed horns, including a trumpet and a saxophone played by well-known musician Maceo Parker. Vocal support from addi­tional artists blends nicely with this track's overall jazzy feel. 
The completely acoustic track, "Harvest," surprises the listener because for once, DiFranco has nothing verbal to say. Her lyrics are so concise and clear and honest throughout the disc's other tracks. However, most Ani Difranco fans can't argue that her intricate guitar work continues to impress when left without her voice. 
The album's second disc, Reckoning, is a departure from the jazzy setup she pre­pares for the listener with Revelling. Most

musical and per­sonal develop­ment. Lyrics such as "The first per­son in your life/ To ever really matter/ Is saying the last thing/ That you want to hear," from "Sick of' Me," demon­strate her grow­ing confronta­tional nature with life. 
As always, DiFranco also takes the oppor­tunity to use her fame to make some political commentary. In "Your Next Bold Move" she takes a shot at the problems she sees in America. "Coming of age during the

down democra­cy/ It had this funny effect on me/ I guess." Honestly and boldly, she takes the risks necessary to make changes. 
This theme is also felt in the social revo­lution anthem "Subdivision." She makes no apologies for her frustrations. "White people are so scared of black people/ They bulldoze out the country ... And while America gets its heart cut right out of its chest/ The Berlin Wall still runs down Main Street." She wants "her country" to rise out of social oppression and conformi­ty. Accompanied by a clarinet, shakers. drums and bass, this song is a fusion of both instruments and ideals. 
This double album is classic Difranco. Faithful to her fans and her art, she never strays too far from what she does best.

Hall of Farner dies from stroke 
A5'ociated Press 
PITTSBURGH 
The Family has lost its patri­
arch. 
Hall of Pamer Willie Stargell. who led the Pirates to two World Series victories with his tape-measure homers, died of a stroke Monday at age 61. 
Ile had been in failing health for several years with a kidney disorder, according to officials at New Hanover Regional Medical Center in Wilmington, N.C. 
The Pirates unveiled a 12­foot bronze statue of the man known as "Pops" on Saturday at PNC Park, where they played their first game Monday only hours after Stargell died. 
"Now, every opening day at PNC Park, everybody will know this is Willie Stargell's day," said Chuck Tanner, Stargell's manager from 1977-82. "He's up there. and he knows the Pirates are opening today." 
One of the greatest home run hitters ever, in volume and in distance, Stargell hit 475 homers -many of them soar­ing, majestic shots that rattled a pitcher's confidence. With Stargell batting cleanup for most of his 20-year career, the Pirates won World Series championships and NL pen­nants in 1971 and 1979 and six NL East titles from 1970­
79. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1988. 
Stargell was a dynamic leader on the field and a fatherly yet forceful presence off it. The 1979 Pirates were nicknamed "the Family" from the Sister Sledge song, "We Are Family," and Stargell said years later that it wasn't a misnomer. 
"We won, we lived and we enjoyed as one," Stargell said. "We molded together dozens of different individuals into one working force. We were prod­ucts of different races, were raised in different income brackets, but in the clubhouse and on the field we were one." 
He distributed his coveted 
stars for extra effort to team­
mates who proudly attached 
them to their ballcaps. 
"We fought for those stars," former teammate Bill Robinson said Monday. "Those were pre­cious. If he forgot to give you one, we'd be at his locker say­ing, 'Willie, I did this' or 'Willie, 1 did that.' To get those stars from your leader and captain, that was special." 
Tanner agreed that Stargell's personal magnetism was a key ingredient in the clubhouse. 
"When you had Willie Stargell on your team, it was like having a diamond ring on your finger," Tanner said. 
Big and powerful at 6-foot-4, 225 pounds. with a deep. com­manding voice. Stargell intimi­dated pitchers even before they delivered the ball by pin­wheeling the bat in rhythm with their delivery. 
Despite being overshadowed at times by more prolific home run hitters Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, and by the play of his own Hall of Fame team­mate, Roberto Clemente, Stargell's sheer power was unrivaled. He hit seven of the 18 homers over the right-field roof at Pittsburgh's Forbes Field from 1909-70 and once held the record for the longest homer in nearly half of the National League parks. 
"He didn't just hit pitchers, he took away their dignity," former Dodgers pitcher Don Sutton said. 
For nearly 30 years, Stargell was the only player to hit a ball out of Dodger Stadium, and he did it twice. If he hadn't played his first 8 1/2 seasons at cavernous Forbes Field, then the majors' most spacious ballpark, he probably would have hit more than 600 homers. 
Stargell's first wife, Dolores, kept detailed statistics on every ball he hit and estimated 
he would have had 22 more 
homers in 1%9 if the Pirates 
had played in Three Rivers 
Stadium, which opened a year 
later. Stargell hit 29 homers in 
1969. 
"Nobody could hit a ball as far as Willie," Tanner said. "In 1979 in Montreal, he hit a ball so far there they painted the seat gold. I went up there the next day and sat in that seat, and everybody on [icld looked like puppets, that's how far it traveled." 
For his first 10 years in the majors, Stargell was content to play in Clemente's shadow, even after he passed Clemente in production. Stargell reluc­tantly became the Pirates' leader upon Clemente's death in a Dec. 31, 1972, plane crash, saying. "There's a time in a man's life when he has to decide if he's going to be a man." 
Stargell wore the mantle of leadership as well as he did an outfielder's glove or a first baseman's mitt as an unappre­ciated defensive player. 
Stargell enjoyed his best sea­son in 1971, with 48 homers and 125 RBIs. However, he was O-for-14 in the NL playoffs against the Giants and had only one RBI in the Pirates' seven-game World Series vic­tory over favored Baltimore. He left center stage to the 38­year-old Clemente, who, fear­ful he would never play in another Series, turned the postseason into a personal showcase of his grace, talent and determination. Only 14 months later. Clemente was dead. 
In 1979, it was Stargell's turn to transform the World Series into a one-man act for an aging star. At 39, seemingly several years past his prime, and after knee injuries had robbed him of his mobility and some of his strength, Stargell's postseason performance was every bit as haunting and as driven as Clemente's. 
Rumors fly over Jordan's return 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
The owner of the 
Washington Wizards said he 
has a "gut feeling" that 
Michael Jordan will return to 
the NBA next season. 
In a story running on the front page of Tuesday's Washington Post. Wizards majority owner Abe Pollin said he believes the odds are that Jordan will play for the Wizards next season. Pollin stressed that he did not know if Jordan has made up his mind yet. 
"The odds are that he's going to come back," Pollin said. "I think he's going to decide whether he's going to be able to play at the level that is satisfying to him." 
Jordan, a part-owner and president of basketball oper­ations for Washington, has consistently said that he's 
99.9 percent sure he'll never play again. He was unavailable for comment Monday night. 
Pollin stressed to the Post that he was simply stating his opinion. "What I said was my gut feeling," Pollin said. "It's his decision. I didn't think he'd come back when I first heard the talk. But when Mario Lemieux came back to the Penguins, it stirred something in Michael." 
Lemieux, one of the owners of the Pittsburgh Penguins, returned to the ice in December after retiring at the end of the 1997 season and led the Penguins into the playoffs. 
Pollin said he thinks Jordan, who won six NBA titles with the Chicago Bulls, is going through a self-exam­ination of sorts. Jordan has been working out recently, including practicing with the Wizards. 
"lle's certainly working at seeing if he feels like he can return," Pollin said. "He's told me when he has some­thing to say about it, he'll tell me. 
"We'd welcome him with open arms," said Pollin, whose team's 18-59 record is third worst in the NBA. "It's his decision. It would have to be in his interest to come back and he would not do it unless he could perform at the standard he set for him­self. 
"But it would be very excit­ing for everyone." 
In order for Jordan to play again under NBA rules, he would have to divest his ownership interest in the Wizards N although he could find a caretaker to purchase his stake sell it back to him when he stops playing. 
"I am working out because I got up to 240 pounds and I'm trying to lose weight," Jordan said last month. "People are taking this stuff way too far, but I can't con­trol what people write or think so I'm not going to address this any more." 
Some of the speculation about Jordan's return has been fueled by Jordan's close friend, Charles Barkley. who has said he would like to play with Jordan in Washington next season. 
Jordan retired in 1993 after winning three NBA titles and tried to make a career in professional base­balI. But he returned for the NBA playoffs in 1995 and played through 1998, win-

up a 4-0 lead. but MBA stars made a run to take an 8­6 lead. and Ill Tempered led just 11-9 at the half. It was a seesaw battle from that point on. with no lead ever getting above three poinlc;. 
The keys to the Ill Tempered win were Jon Pentzion's inside scoring and Tom Slabach's outside shooting during a stretch when his teammates had gone cold. 
"It was real tight the whole way, and in the second half Tom Slabach started hitting a couple outside shots," Ill Tempered Sea Bass point guard Matt Yung said. "It was a big defensive battle mostly. They're a very fit team -they had some big guys that can crash the boards. They're the best team we'll play for a few rounds." 
It's not usually considered a close game when one team scores three times more than its opponent, but that's what No. 3 seed NDToday.com thought of its 21-7 first-round win over 0-DAG! 
"They played hard the whole time," said NDToday's Todd Titus. "They were more aggressive than I thought." 
NDToday, whir,h lost in the finals a year ago. used a rebounding advantage to advance past a better-than­average first-round opponent. Mike Oesterle led the team in scoring and B.J _Kloska dropped in several long-distance jump shots. 
"We were getting the cobwebs out," said Oesterle. "Their guard was pretty good." 
Varsity basketball player Meaghan Leahy's team, Team 3()2, may have lost to Whipple Effect IV Monday. but Leahy said their Bookstore run isn't over yet. 
"We got 14 point_<;," Leahy said. "Now we're gonna go win the girls' bracket."

Bookstore? "I don't know," joked Dunbar, who is also playing Bookstore. "Not Meaghan Leahy's team." One factor working against Team 392 was its lack of experience, with the exception of Leahy. As Lina Sidrys said. "We haven't played basketball in 10 years."

The development of the New Testament was gradual. The earliest books of the New Testament were probably some ofthe letters of Paul and date back to the S0's, some 
20 years after Jesus' death. The gospels were written significantly later. Most of their development took place between the years 70 and 110. During chis same period many ocher Christian writings also entered into circulation among the various Christian communities. Even as the early Church was beginning to regard some of this Christian literature as scripture, it was not at all certain which of these books were

CLUB SPORTS 
Gymnasts earn 2nd national championship 
Specia.J lo The Observer 
The men's gymnastics team once again has vaulted to the pinnacle of success. winning the club national championship, a title it also claimed in 1998. The Irish team score of 147.75 nar­rowly edged runner-up Texas, 146.95. 
Defending champion Texas A&M took Bronze with a 145.95 score, just ahead of '99 champi­on Syracuse in fourth. Mickey McGarry and Jason Miller paced the Irish. with McGarry claiming sixth in the All-Around. McGarry took fifth in floor, sixth in rings, fifth in vault and sev­enth in parallel bars, while Miller placed sixth in the vault. Pete Asmuth also scored points for the Irish although he did not place. The trophy will be on dis­play at the Rolfs Sports Recreation Center. 
The Irish women's team also distinguished itself. with its fourth consecutive top 10 rank­ing. finishing eighth in the cham­pionships. Emily Smith won Gold in the Uneven Bars with a 
9.6 performance to highlight the competition. Smith's fifth in the vault and seventh on both foor and balance beam earned her third in the all-around competi­tion. Erin Henry finished 11th in Ralance Beam and 17th in the all-around, as the team finished eighth with a 131.6 score. Texas. Texas A&M and Miami of Ohio took the top three spots. 
Women's Water Polo 
The Notre Dame women's water polo club claimed its sec­ond Midwest Championship in three years with a championship game 8-5 victory over rival and defending champion Miami Ohio. After blitzing through the first three rounds with victories over Miami B, 16-2, Bowling Green, 13-6. and Grand Valley. 15-1, the Irish faced a nemesis that had defeated them twice earlier this season -Miami Ohio. 
In what coach Brian Coughlin described as "an amazing game and great effort by all," The Irish displayed ability and composure. Trailing the Red llawks by two goals. the Irish tallied five straight scores. Lauren Kuzniar battled in hole to score four times, including a 4 meter rock­et. 
Liz Parolin splashed two more into the net. while drawing four ejections. Brigctt J\lge's tena­cious defense in the hole shut down Miami's MVP of a year ago. while Alge also scored twice for the Irish. 
Lisa Thomas proved to be among the best goalies in the country, and she received great defensive support from Meg Daday, Sarah Todnem. Margo Klosterman and Meghann Stepan, as these four also helped with assists on the attack. 
In four weeks the Irish will compete in the Nationals at Miami of Ohio, against the best teams from California, Florida, Arizona and the rest of the country. 
Ultimate Frisbee 
For the second week in a row, the women's squad claimed first place, as the Irish won the Great Lakes Invitational. In round robin play, the women defeated Oberlin, 8-6, University of Chicago. 11-3, Ohio State. 12-5 and Case Western, 11-5, before dropping an 11-10 decision to Ohio U.. Despite losing top play­er Carolyn Scully to injury, the Irish defeated Oberlin in the semilinaJs, 10-5, and Michigan in the championship, 10-9. Julia Pilipovich was the leading scorer for the Irish, while Monica Kerschner was a standout on defense. The club will return to action in the sectionals in two weeks. 
The men's squad again played shorthanded, as four top players were injured and missing from the tournament. Yet the Jrish still managed to post a 5-2 record. 
Because of strong wind condi­tions, the club played zone defense, which contributed to the Irish fast start, as they post­ed wins over Miami Ohio, 13-6, Ohio, 13-8; and Ohio State, 13­12, before dropping the finale on Saturday to Indiana, 13-7. In Sunday's quarterfinals, the Irish defeated Case Western, 13-1. and took the semifinals over Ohio State, 15-9, before falling in the finals to Indiana, 13-11. 
Salling 
The Notre Dame Sailing club placed third this weekend at the University of Michigan in the Big 10 Team Racing Regatta. Michigan and Wisconsin finished first and second ahead of the Irish, with Northwestern, Minnesota, and Iowa State plac­ing fourth, fifth and sixth respec­tively. 
Rowing 
Fresh off its win in last week's Lubber's Cub over Michigan State and Grand Valley State, the Howing club traveled to Ypslianti, Mich. to challenge Michigan and Michigan State. Twenty mile-per-hour quarter­ing tail winds with gusts forced the cancellation of the 3F and Varsity 4-plus races. In the events that were held, it was a clean sweep for Michigan, as the Wolverines won the Freshman 4-plus. Varsity 8, followed by Notre Dame and Michigan State, and in the final race on the long course, wind conditions swamped all but two boats, forc­ing the course to be shortened to 91 O meters. On the short course, Michigan again topped the Irish with the Spartans trail­ing in the firsts and second Freshman 8 races.

4-1 at No. 4 singles befom rallying for a 3­6, 6-4, 6-3 win in the match at 3-3. 
In Sunday's match against ninth-ranked Southern Methodist University, the Irish kept iL dose in their third 4-3 loss of the season. SMU swept all three doubles matches, beating the Irish 8-6 at No. 1 and 2 doubles and 8-3 at No. 3. 
Smith again had the biggest challenge of the match, playing SMU's 6th ranked senior Genius Chidzikwe in the deciding match. The Mustang's 24th-ranked. .Jon Wallmark also defeated Javier Taborga at No. 2 singles, 6-3, 7-6, and Brian Farrell lost only his third dual singles match of the year, 6-4, 6-3 to SMU's Johan Brunstrom. 
"I was awfully proud of Casey. LChidzikwe] is one of the best college ten­nis players in the country. He played in the Davis Cup for Zimbabwe, and was an IPA All-American. His expnience really showed," said Bayliss. 
The three wins of the day for the Irish again demonstrated their depth in the middle of their lineup. Haddock-Morales defeated Krystian Pfeiffer 3-6. 6-4, 7-5 at no. 3 singles, Aaron Talarico defeated Alexis Rudzinski 6-2. 6-2 at No. 4 singles, and Matt Daly won 6-4, 6-3 over SMU's Lukasz Scnszysyn at No. 6. 
"Luis [Haddock-Morales] really had a break out match against SMU. Aaron Talarico was solid as could be and has really been a rock all season," said Bayliss. "It was a great weekend for him, too." 
The Irish face 18th-ranked Indiana State at home today at 3:30 p.m. 
"Indiana State has a solid team, especial­ly at No. 1 and 2 singles. Most are consis­tent, baseline players. They're a little more rested, but we're a little more seasoned," said Bayliss. 
They will not have to travel for a match again until the Big East at the end of the 
month. 
"It's been a tough stretch, and we've played a lot of good teams," said Bayliss. "But you don't have a chance to do well at the end of the year unless you know what's in you."

Fighting high winds and weather condi­tions, the 16th-ranked men's tennis team sent Baylor packing in Texas this week­end. defeating the team 4-3. 
The Irish fought their way back from a 2-0 deficit early in the 
match to claim the win. 
"The conditions were far from perfect. but I think our guys did a great job of keeping their poise and fighting hard when there was every 

reason to fold up and Bayliss go home," said head coach Bobby Bayliss. "It was difficult to adjust, and any of them deserve a lot of credit." 
The 21st-ranked Irish doubles team of juniors Javier Taborga and Aaron Talarico defeated Baylor's 18th-ranked team of Reiner Neurohor and Mark Williams 9-7 at No. 1 doubles. The No. 32 ranked Baylor Bears defeated Notre Dame's no. 2 doubles teams of freshman Luis Haddock-Morales and Casey Smith 8-6 and also the No. 3 team of senior Matt Daly and sophomore Brian Farrell 8-2.

Bledsoe and Syracuse second base­man Lindsay Richards collided as Bledsoe attempted to steal second. Both lay on the ground for minutes before being helped off the field. 
Notre Dame coach Liz Miller report­ed that it was a PCL tear. and she will be out two to four weeks. 
"Andrea said she'll be back in a week," said Miller. "It's good that she's got that attitude,". 
Bledsoe was 4-5 with a double and two RBI before being removed from the game due to the injury. 
"We've got to have good contribution from those who step in her place," said Miller. "She was playing great before she went down, she had a key double in the first game." 
With the two wins, they improved their record to an outstanding 32-3, and 8-0 in the Big East. 
Pitching was again the key, as Jen 
showed again 
why she is a premier leadoIT hitter, going 6-8 with a triple and two RBIs. Lizzy Lemire, leading the charge, was 4-7, including a double and her second homer of the season, with four runs and three BBi.

"We're really getting the job done right now," commented Miller. "We're getting it done offensively, and we're getting the pitching down." 
The No. 11 Irish have won seven straight doubleheaders, seemingly headed for a birth in the top 10. 
The team tries to stay on a roll Wednesday when it welcomes Bowling Green to town. The first pitch is scheduled for 3:30 p.m. at Ivy Field. 
WOMEN'S TRACK 
Graf breaks school record in Belles' meet 
By MOLLY MCVOY Senior Staff Writer 
The Belles continued to run like this is their last season at the College Saturday in a MIAA dual meet. 
Junior Laura Graf broke the school record in the 400 meter dash with a time of 59.10, shav­ing nearly three seconds off the old record of 1:02.0 that had been held by Cyndy Short since 1982. 
The Belles split the meet, beating Olivet 69-58, while los­ing to Adrian 86-58. This was the first league meet the Belles competed in, and their record is now 1-1 in the conference. 
"We gave Adrian a run for their money," senior co-captain Kara Bergman said. "We gener­ally did a very good job." 
Graf finished first in both the 400 meter dash, where she broke the record and the 200­meter dash where she recorded a time of 28.70. Junior Erica Burket also was a two-time win­ner for Saint Mary's, winning the 100 meter hurdles (16.90) and the triple jump (31 '0"). 
The Belles took both the 400 meter relay with a time of 54.55 and the 1600 motet relay, post­ing a time of 4:42.70. The 400 meter team consisted of Graf. Burket, freshman Jaclyn Thompson and freshman Bechy Shepkowski while the 1600M team included Graf, sophomore Whitney Ross, Erin Thayer and freshman Nicole Garcia. 
Every team member that com­peted in Saturday's meet scored for Saint Mary's. Although track is often perceived as an individ­ual sport, the Belles feel that this sort of teamwork is essen­tial for success. 
"With the low number of peo­ple we have on the team, every­one contributing is especially important," Bergman said. 
Saint Mary's will face another dual MIAA league meet on Saturday. They will face Alma and Calvin at Calvin College at noon. Alma has a 1-1 record in the MIM and Calvin has yet to compete in a league meet this season. Alma and Calvin will face each other at Hope College on Wednesday before facing Saint Mary's. Both Calvin and Alma defeated Saint Mary's in their meetings last season. 
"We want to basically do our best Saturday. Calvin is the biggest team in our league and they always are at the top of the league," Bergman said. 
"We go back and forth with Alma. I know they lost a lot of really strong seniors last year so there's a good chanc,e we can beat them. However, we have yet to see them in competition."

MEN'S LACROSSE 
Seniors lead Irish to win over Air Force 
By JOE LICANDRO 
Sports Writer 
Thanks to three goals apiece from seniors Todd Ulrich and Jon Harvey, combined with another strong per­formance from senior goalie Kirk Ilowell, the men's lacrosse team eas­ily defeated its Great Western Lacrosse League rivals Air Force Falcons 13 to 2. 
With their third straight blowout victory, the seventh-ranked Irish improved to 8-1 on the season with only four games left to play in the regular season. 
"For the third straight game, we jumped out to a quick lead," said head coach Kevin Corrigan. "That makes it much easier to control the game and play for a full 60 minutes." 
The Irish jumped out to a critical quick start as junior Devin Ryan got the scoring started on a strong drive through the heart of the Air Force defense for a one-on-one chance against Air Force goalie Bill Arnold. 
After Ryan capitalized on his opportunity, Steve Bishko, Ulrich and Harvey rounded out the scoring in the first quarter, giving the Irish a 4­0 lead. 
Todd Ulrich would add two of the Irish's four total second quarter goals. allowing the Irish to take a substantial 8-0 advantage heading into halftime. 
Ulrich has been on a scoring tear over the last two games, netting seven goals in the games, raising his season total to 10. 
"I have had some good looks at the net over the last two games," said Ulrich. "Playing at home makes it a lot easier." 
The Jrish continued their domi­
nance in the second half. adding five 
more goals. After some spectacular 
saves, Irish goalie Kirk Howell would 
leave the game midway through the 
third quarter posting a shutout. 
"I only had to stop five shots the whole game," said Howell. "Our defense played well again so they made my job a lot easier out there." 
Coach Corrigan began pulling his starters in the second half, allowing the younger sophomores and fresh­men. to gain some valuable experi­ence. 
Sophomore backup goalie Nick Antol would pick up where Howell left off, making some incredible saves and allowing Air Force only two goals. Freshmen John Mulfur and Steve Clagget provided the scor­ing with each netting their first career goals. 
''l was really happy with the play of our sophomores and freshmen," said Corrigan. "They work hard in practice just like the juniors and seniors. These last three games, the younger guys have been gaining some experience. I enjoy watching them keep getting better." 
With the victory over Air Force, the Irish improved to· 3-0 in Great Western Lacrosse League Divisional Play. This was the second of a four game home stand for the Irish. 
The Irish next host Army on Saturday at lp.m., where they look to continue their strong team defense and relentless offensive pressure in hoping to continue to climb up the national rankings before the start of the NCAA tourna­ment.

The headed into Piscataway. New Jersey for a crucial three-game series with Big East rival Rutgers last week­end. 
Walking away Sunday after­noon with three wins, the Irish completed their first ever sweep of a Notre Dame­Rutgers series, and started on the inside track to the regular season Big East title. 
The Irish blew away the Scarlet Knights Saturday. win­ning the two games of the double-header, 10-2 and 8-2. On Sunday, the team showed great poise mixed with some clutch hitting to pull out an eleven-inning 5-4 victory. 
The three wins of the week­end improved Notre Dame's record to 25-5-1. The Irish were rewarded for their great play with their highest ever ranking in the collegiate polis. Notre Dame now holds respec­tive rankings of 4, 6 and 7 in the College Baseball, USA Today/Coaches and Baseball America Polls. 
"It was as good of a series as I've ever seen at my tenure at Notre Dame," stated Coach Paul Mainieri. "The overall team effort was great. Everyone got involved to do something to help us win. Pitching, defense. hitting, base running -we did everything well." 
The team contributions were evident in the numbers from the series. In. the three games, 10 different players got hits while nine contributed RBIs to the team's 23 total runs. 
Six different members of the Irish pitching staff put togeth­er three more brilliant out­ings, only allowing eight runs in the series. 
In the first game of the dou­ble-header, Notre Dame ace Aaron Heilman pitched his fifth complete game of the season, allowing two runs on only three hits. 
The right-handed senior improved to 8-0 on the year. The win was also his 18th career Big East victory, mov­ing him into first place all­time in that category. 
The game had been knotted at 2-2 until the Irish bats exploded in the sixth inning, bringing eight runs across the plate. The inning began when freshman Steve Sollmann, leading the team in batting with a .426 average, slapped a lead off single. After right fielder Brian Stavisky walked, Kris Billrnaier broke open the tie with a two-run single. The RBIs were two of the four in the series for Billmaier, who is batting .324 with runners in scoring position-seventy points above his normal average. 
Junior Ken Meyer brought in another run with a hard ground ball that was followed by a double from first base­man Joe Thaman. Center fielder Steve Stanley then brought in Meyer and Thaman with another single. 
Appropriately, Sollrnann capped off the inning that he started with his third homcrun of the season, pacing the Irish in that category as well. 
The Irish carried the momentum of the first game into the nightcap, kicking off the game with five runs in the team's first turn at bat. In this inning, third baseman Andrew Bushey had a bases loaded double that provided three of his five RBIs on the day. Notre Dame added two more runs in the inning on singles by 0H Matt Bok and Thaman. Sophomore J.P. .Gagne improved to 2-2 on the year with his six-inning perfor­mance, and classmate Brandon Viloria earned the save by pitching three score­less innings in relief. · 
In the game Sunday. the Irish demonstrated the poise that will make them a con­tender this year for the national title, battling back from a 3-0 deficit in the eighth inning to steal a game from Rutgers on their own field. 
"Sunday we showed a really great attitude," commented Mainieri. "Our guys never threw in the towel. and they ended up fighting back for the win." 
It was not until their last at bat that the Irish would make their move. 
It all began with the top of the lineup that has been such a key to igniting the Irish offense this year. The first and second hitters, Stanley and Sollmann, once again put together back-to-back singles. Stavisky then slapped a single to score Stanley. After a dou­ble steal, Billmaier brought home Sollmann with a sacri­fice fly; however, there were two outs in the inning. One out away from a loss, catcher Paul O'Toole -0-3 on the day­came through with a great piece of clutch hitting. knock­ing a single to tie the game. 
Notre Dame avoided a scare in the tenth inning when sophomore Matt Laird got out of a one-out bases loaded jam. Laird got Rutgers' left fielder Nick Cerulo to pop out to shal­low left and then struck out DH Jeff Majewski. 
In the 11th inning, the Irish went on top for good when Sollmann singled to start the inning. Billmaier then came through with another clutch RBI. getting a single that would score Sollmann all the way from first with the help of some errant throws by the Rutgers fielders. 
The Irish don't plan on let­ting these big wins go to their heads, however, as there is much baseball left to play, especially in the Big East. 
"We're not looking past any­one on our schedule," said Mainieri. "We have got a lot of tough games this week and a few injuries to deal with. Our guys will just play every game as its own." 
Notre Dame has a busy week ahead, facing two non-confer­ence opponents, Cleveland State and Detroit, on Tuesday and Wednesday. Then the Irish return to Big East play with doubleheaders against Georgetown on Thursday and West Virginia on Saturday.

NFL 
Aikman announces retirement 
Asso~iatcd Press 
IRVING, Texas 
As always, Troy Aikman 
came to Texas Stadium with 
his game face on. 
lie brought an inch-thick 
stack of index cards and 
enough family and friends to 
till a ballroom. Banners from 
the three Super Bowls he won 
hung from the hole-in-the-roof 
visible behind him. 
But when it came time to talk 
about the end of his 12-year 
career. the usually unflappable 
quarterback was overcome by 
emotion. 
A few sentences into his 
nearly 1 1/2-hour retirement 
news conference Monday, 
Aikman put down the cards, 
took a breath and dragged a 
finger beneath and above his 
left eye. 
"You watch and you think 
your time will never come,'' 
Aikman said slowly. "And my 
time's come." 
Aikman called it a career 33 
days after being waived by the 
Dallas Cowboys. · 
While he believes he can still 
be a starting quarterback in 
the NFL, the right job wasn't 
out there. 
So rather than risk suffering an 11th concussion or taking another hit on his aching back, the 34-year-old Aikman ended his playing career and is preparing to start another as a broadcaster. 
"I know it's the right thing for me because of my health, concussions, the back prob­lems I've had," Aikman said. "It took its toll." 
Aikman is close to finalizing a deal with Fox to replace Matt Millen as the partner for play­by-play announcer Dick Stockton, an industry source told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. An announcement could come as early as Tuesday. the source said. 
Aikman's life is rapidly changing. He recently moved to California and in late August his wife is due to have their first child. The couple also is raising an 11-year-old daugh­ter from her previous mar­riage. 
"I wanted to play. I just can't do that anymore," Aikman said. "l think when all things are considered it was the right thing for me and my family." 
Aikman bit his lip as Cowboys owner Jerry Jones introduced the first player he ever drafted and reminisced about the rise of the team and the quarterback. · 
Before he turned the micro­phone over to Aikman, Jones presented a video prepared by NFL Films. It began with home movies from Aikman's youth and featured great moments from his career. 
Aikman told about going to the Green Bay Packers' final game in 1988 and rooting for them to win so Dallas would have the top pick in the draft. The Packers won and. before leaving the stadium, Aikman 'iought a Cowboys cap. 
Dallas made Aikman the first pick in 1989 and also drafted Daryl Johnston, Mark Stepnoski and Tony Tolbert. 
"One of the most meaningful things in my career was com­ing in with that group," 
"You watch and you think your time will never come. And my time's come." 
Troy Aikman Cowboys' player 
Aikman said. 
He recalled losing the first 11 
games of his career and 
thanked former teammates and 
coaches for propping up his 
confidence during that time. He 
said that type of character was 
the hallmark of Dallas' Super 
Bowl champion teams in 1992, 
'93 and '95. 
"There was no animosity, no 
selfishness. nobody wanting 
any more credit than the next 
guy," he said. "We just wanted 
to win. 
"There have been a lot of 
teams in this league that have 
been more talented than those 
teams were, but they didn't 
come close to accomplishing 
what we did because the chem­
istry of that ballclub and 
unselfish manner in which we 
played. You can't beat that 
combination." 
Then, showing the candor 
that will serve him well in 
broadcasting, Aikman added: 
"Maybe over recent years 
we've lost sight of that. It's 
become a game that every­
body's in it for themsel".es." 
Aikman talked about the 
things he'll miss. such as the 
locker room after a big win, 
and the things he won't, like 
facing reporters after a big 
loss. 
He also thanked scores of 
people. He named 18 offensive 
linemen, about a dozen coach­
es. including Barry Switzer, 
and practically every member 
of the Cowboys' organization, 
including Jones and his family. 
He had trouble talking about specific teammates, especially "The Triplets" -himself, receiver Michael Irvin and run­ning back Emmitt Smith. 
"I loved it when they called us that," Aikman said, teary­eyed. "l told Emmitt when I saw him earlier, 'There's noth­ing I would've loved more than to be on the field when you break Walter Payton's record."' 
Sitting in the second row, Smith draped an arm around Irvin and both bit their lips as they held back their emotions. 
"All three of us stepped up," said Smith, who is 1.561 yards behind Payton's career rushing mark. "We all pushed one another. 
"He probably was the laid­back one, but he was the stub­born one. too. His stubbornness was really his way of showing that losing was not an option." 
Aikman never lost his desire to win, but age and injuries sapped his ability. 
He missed five games last year with injuries and was knocked out of three more in the first quarter. He suffered four of his 10 concussions in his last 20 starts. 
When Aikman played last season, he lacked his trade­mark arm strength and accura­cy. He had the worst QB rating among NFC starters. 
The Cowboys waived him March 7, one day before owing him a $7 million bonus and seven-year contract extension 
A few weeks into being a free agent for the first time, Aikman told agent Leigh Steinberg he was finally ready to consider­ing a job in broadcasting. Networks have been interested in Aikman since he did color commentary on NFL Europe games for Fox two years ago. 
Aikman's legacy begins with his three Super Bowl titles. Only Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw won as many. 
His 90 wins in 1990s are the most by any quarterback in any decade. Aikman also won his first seven playoff games and 10 of his first 11, and was the ·MVP of his first Super Bowl. 
Rather than joining Montana, Joe Namath and Johnny Unitas as quarterbacks whose careers ended in seemingly foreign uni­forms, Aikman will forever be a Cowboy. 
"It's going to be very difficult to view the Dallas Cowboys the same way," Johnston said. 
Aikman also joins the list of NFL stars who have retired at least partly because of concus­sions. 
Other notables include Steve Young, who reluctantly quit last summer, and Roger Staubach, who led Dallas to two Super Bowl titles before retiring in March 1980 at age 38. 
'Tm looking forward to being a supporter of the Dallas Cowboys," Aikman said. "I want to watch them win anoth­er Super Bowl. I know it's going to happen." 

NCAA BASKETBALL 
Arizona's Wright declares for draft 
Associated Press 
TUCSON 
Michael Wright. a third­team all-American and three­year starter for NCAA runner­up Arizona, is the second Wildcats player in two days to announce he will skip his senior season to enter the NBA draft. 
The 6-foot-7. 238-pound power forward's announce­ment Monday came one day after teammate Richard Jefferson said he would forego his final year of eligibility to go to the NBA. 
"I think we are all working toward the goal of being pro­fessionals and I think this is my time to go after it with all my energies," Wright said in a statement released by the uni­versity. 
Until this season, coach Lute Olson had only two players leave school early for the NBA -Brian Williams in 1991 and Mike Bibby in 1997. 
Yet to be heard from is sophomore guard Gilbert Arenas, who also is strongly considering leaving for the 
NBA. 
If Arenas goes, that would leave only sophomore point guard Jason Gardner remain­ing from the starting lineup of the team that lost to Duke in the national championship game. 
Center Loren Woods was the only senior among the Wildcats' starters. 
In his statement, Wright thanked Olson, assistant coach Jim Rosborough and under­graduate assistant Josh Pastner, who was his road roommate for three years. 
"Special thanks to the peo­ple of Tucson, who touched me in ways they can ever know," Wright said. "Tucson was a different world for me to adjust to three years ago. Tucson took me into their hearts and I leave Tucson a better person." 
Wright, who grew up in Chicago. had nine double-dou­bles last season and 34 for his college career. 
While Wright was an out­standing college player, some NBA scouts wonder if his size makes him too small for power forward and too big and bulky for small forward. Wright had 10 points and 11 rebounds in Arizona's loss to Duke. 
He averaged 15.6 points, and a team-leading 7.8 rebounds in 36 games last season. 
All five Arizona starters averaged in double figures in scoring last season. 
Jefferson, whose NBA stock rose sharply with his strong NCAA tournament run, aver­aged 11.3 points, 5.4 rebounds and 2.7 assists in 35 games.

WOMEN'S TENNIS 
By KATIE MCVOY Associate Spans Editor 
Today's tennis match doesn't have as much to do with serves and backhands as it does with mental focus and determination. Saint Mary's will be facing off against the Knights of Calvin in a battle that may foretell the results of the MIAA tournament. 
"I think this match is going to de.termine a lot," team captain Annie Knish said. 'This will tell us how well we're expected to do at Conference. Albion, Hope and Calvin are our toughest competitors at conference and we've already beaten Hope and Albion so we have one more to go." 
The Knights of Calvin represent the last major hurdle for the Belles' aim at finishing first in regular season play in the MIAA. After a solid victory over the Hope Flying Dutch, Saint Mary's will be mov­ing its focus to the Knights. 
Last season the Belles tied with the Knights for a second place finish behind the Flying Dutch. Since the has promised to be tough competition, but a recent loss to Albion may make the Knights less formidable opponents. Saint Mary's topped Albion 6-3 on April 4. 
"It gives us a little more confidence, who we've beaten," Knish said. "But we can't go into the match being too cocky. We have to go in there and play our best and make sure we're getting all the points we need." 
The starting Belles team had a day off on Sunday as the Saint Mary's B team had the opportunity to get some playing time. They will be back on the court today to face off against Calvin after time for men­tal preparation. 
"A day off is important not only to rest physically but to rest mentally as well," Knish said. "Having so many matches is tiring." 
Knish will face Calvin's Disselkoen, who hails from South Africa, in No. 1 sin­gles and in No. 1 doubles when Knish teams up with Natalie Cook. 
Disselkoen is one of four returning Calvin players
