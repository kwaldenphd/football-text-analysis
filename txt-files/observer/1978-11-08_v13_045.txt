firm for women. She lectured on career opportunities in the working world for a liberal arts major and the business world's view of these graduates. 
She cited certain basic skills as being highly important for a liberal arts major in the working world and in personal life. Learning to develop decision making, problem solving, forecasting, planning and communication skills is extremely crucial to the success of a liberal arts major, Cavanaugh said. 
Cavanaugh also discussed some of the characteristic stereotypes that women in the working world must face. She claimed that a liberal arts education enables a woman to incorporate such "womanly" virtues as being emotional, dependant and detai' · oriented with the more "manly virtues of rationality, initiative an.. risk-taking. 
"The real need is to hang on the the core of who you are. This core is the result of your liberal arts education," Cavanaugh noted. 
Weber dealt with the family­oriented domestic alternative for a liberal arts graduate. She main­tained that motherhood, a full-tie job with many rewards and many problems, can also include a part­time career. While her husband was in law school, Weber worked full-time. 
Over the ears, Weber has worked as a full-time high school English teacher· and a part-time newspaper editor. She still finds time for several community activi­
ties,  particularly  the  League  of  
Women Voters.  
Weber  went  on  to  say that  a  

full-time working mother must learn how to handle the criticism directed at her by society. It is possible, she asserted to be a mother and have a full-time career.

Besides contributing mental health, a liberal arts educa­tion can be of economic value. It is an investment in the future, she added.

On ND investment 
Hesburgh discusses policies 
by Rob Powers Staff Reporter 

"The University is not investing in any banks that lend money to the South African government," Uni­versity President Fr. Theodore Hesburgh told a crowd of 100 in Keenan-Stanford Chapel last night. 
Hesburgh discussed the Univer­sity's investment policy, as well as the proposed new women's dorm, coed dorms and Notre Dame-Saint Mary's relations, at the forum which was sponsored by the Stan­ford Academic Commission. 
Hesburgh, a board member of Chase Manhattan Bank, said that, in 1977, Chase Manhattan became the first bank to adopt officially the policy of refusing loans to the South African government. 
Hesburgh said that he spent two weeks in South Africa last summer talking to university, government and business officials from several sectors of society. "It was clear to me after talking to all the groups (blacks, Afrikaaners, English), they need some help," he said. 
If American companies pull out 

of South Africa, he-said, German and Japanese firms will immedi­ately move in. If this occurs, apartheid will not be stopped. "It would be better to stay in and influence them (the government)," he said. 
Hesburgh pointed out that 423 of 425 General Electric employees in South Africa are black. If the firm were to pull out, it would be harming the minority it intended to help. 
Hesburgh said that he told those South Africans whom he met on his visit to "open up your society as we did in 1964." When they replied that this was not possible because of the black majority, Hesburgh replied, "You can do it here in Sout Africa. We did it in the U.S. and we have more than twenty million blacks." 
"Most of you find it easy to condemn South Africa," Hesburgh said, adding, "The situation was just as bad in the South prior to 1964." Hesburgh described the numerous segregation practices in theaters, buses and other public places in the South prior to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. -Hesburgh said that he writes 
directly to those companies which 
~ave plants in .South Africa, "keep­
mg an eye on them" and recom­
mending that they recognized black 
laborunions. 
In response to a student's ques­
tion, Hesburgh stated that he plans 
to enroll 500 more women at Notre 
Dame, but that a quota system 
would be maintained. He 
explained that some of the reasons 
for keeping a quota were the 
expense of converting men's halls, 
Notre Dame's tradition as a men's 
school and the greater generosity 
of men alumni. 
"A few years ago, the president of Bryn Mawr (a women's college) had to practically kill himself to raise twenty million from the alumni," Hesburgh offered as an example. 
The architectural plan for the proposed women's residence has not yet been decided, Hes-burgh said, "because students keep changing their minds." The first plan for another high-rise hall was approved by students in one survey and then disapproved in a later survey. 
"I doubt we will have coed dorms," Hesburgh said in reply to another student-raised question. He pointed to single sex dorms as having the "best of both worlds," offereing "privacy and allowing students to visit each other better than half of each day." 
Hesburgh said that the trend toward coed dormitories on college campuses has leveled off. He pointed out that' Princeton is offer­ing single sex housing for the first time in several years. 
Hesburgh also commented on the importance of Notre Dame's social relationship with Saint , Mary's. "Notre Dame women should associate with Saint Mary's women," he stressed.

Brownschidle:: Irish defenseman won't be home for Christmas 
by Brian Beglane Sports Writer 
He won't be able to spend any vacation time at home for Christ­mas. He'll have to leave right after exams and miss two of the team's games. And he'll get back just in time to start playing with the team again. 
But there are countless hockey players across the country who would love to be in his skates and go where he is going. And that's Sweden. 
Jeff Brownschidle has been se-­lected as one of six defensemen to play for the United States Junior National team in the World Junior Tournament just outside Stockholm The tournament will be held De· cember 27 to January 3, and as the Sophomore Irish blueliner explains representing his country at this tournament is nothing new to him. 
"I played for the Junior National team two years ago when I was 17, '' offers the native of East Amherst, N.Y., "and I was a lot younger than any of the other players then. It was a great experience plqing in Czechoslava­kia in world competition and I'm looking forward to playing again. ''I've gotten more experience now with a full year of college hockey under my belt and just hope that I will be able to play better this 

time." 
Lou s~ vio ofthe Amateur Hockey Associat on, who makes his home in ColorE do Springs, will be coach­ing this year's squad and has equipped himself with 12 players from WCHA. Jeff Lundgren and Marc Pe1tygrove of Colorado, Mike Ramsey of Minnesota and Mike Stone o( North Dakota will be joining Hrownschilde on the blue line for he U.S. Stuart Birenbaum of Denv,!r (remember him from Saturday "s game?) and Jim Jetland of Minnesota will be in the nets. Five WC HA skaters will also be playing llp front. 
"The fact that 12 players from the WCHA have been selected to play for :he United States," says Notre Dane coach Lefty Smith, "is a tribute to the quality of the league." 
Brown!.chidle had the opportun­nity to play with the Junior National :earn last year but due to scheduling conflicts with the tour­nament and Irish games, was forced to decline. This season he will miss two non-league games at Boston College and Harvard and will be b iick in time for the first series after Christmas, against North Dalwta. 
"This i1; an excellent opportunity for a yollng, talented player like Jeff," said Smith, "and since he will not be missing _any league games the opportunity is JUSt too good to let him pass it up." 
Smith got a first hand look at 
Brownschidle's progress this past 
summer when he coached the 
sophomore at the National Sports 
Festival in Colorado Springs. 
"I was very fortunate to be able 
to work with Jeff and a lot of other 
fi'ne hockey players at the Sports 
Festival this summer," noted the 
10-year coach of the Irish icers. 
"Jeff has improved a great deal 
over the past year and I think he 
should do well for the United States 
in this tournament. He has 
excellent ability as far as rushing 
the puck and hitting are concerned 
and was a good choice for the 
team." 
It is no secret that Brownschidle is considered a prospect for the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team and so the opportunity to play in this international tournament becomes all the more valuable. 
"I'm looking forward to possibly playing in the Olympics and some­thing like that is a great opportu­nity," commented Jeff, whose brother Jack was a former Irish standout. "I look forward to gaining more international experi­en,·e at the World Junior Tourna­ment and hope it will help me·." 
Jeff's defensive partner, Scott Cameron, joked about putting up

StanfQrd dumps Keenan , 2-0 to win interha/1 crown 
by Mark Perry Assistant Sports Editor 

In the finals of the interhall soccer tournament held last night on the frozen Astroturf of Cartier Field, Stanford Hall defeated Keenan Hall, 2-0, to win the championship. 
. Strong offensive play was the key to. Stanford's victory, as they had several good shots on goal in the game. Only the strong play of Keenan goalie Bill Hickey kept the score close, as he made some outstanding saves. 
The tirst half wa~> scoreless, although both teams had some opportunities to take the lead.

Hockey 
The Notre Dame hockey team skated to an exciting split in their series with Denver last weekend, winning Friday's c<·ntest 6-4 and having a desperate rally halted on Saturday, losing 4-3. Tom Michalek is leading 
the WCHA in scoring, averaging three points a game. The vaunted Pangborn trio of Meredith, Weltzin and Schneide--connected for five goals during the series. 
Anyone who was present at Friday evening's contest would be hard-pressed to argue with the following acco1Int of tl.e game: "The Fighting Irish recorded an artistic 6-4 win over the Pioneers. Rookie goalie Dave ~urion WflS an acrobat in the nets, gliding gracefully to rob Den··er play"s of certain opportunities. The fiftl. Notre Dame goal was a thing of beauty, as freshman Bill Rothstein feigned a defenseman, then juked the Pioneer goalie out of the crease and de:'tly flicked the puck past him." 
Artistry, acrobatics, grace, beauty--someof the~ things that distinguish 
college hockey from the pro game, where at times bloodshed and mayhem seem to be the principal objectives of those playe·s known as "goons." It is rare indeed to see a bench-clearing brawl in a WCHA game, due to the discipline instilled by coaches and the strict contnl in which officials hold the game. In short, violence has no place in the college game. 
This weekend the Irish icers travel to Minneapolis to play the Golden Gophers, picked to finish first in the league. With a resurgence of interest in Notre Dame hockey among the student body,. WSND sports director Paul Stauder arranged to have the FM station broadcast away series and secured advertisers among the South Bend community. A vote was held among the honchos at the station, and by a 6-1 rna ·gin, it was decided that 
. the FM station would carry a full slate of away games. 
With posters dotting the campus expounding 1he merits of ice hockey, the infectious enthusiasm of this year's young team and the announcement by WSND, the revitalization of Iri! h hockey began to have a snowball effect. Friday's crowd, although not capacity, was an excited one that appreciated the nuances of the contest as well as Notre Dame goals. With the gridders at home this weekend against Tennessee, it was expected that we could follow the progess of the hockey team over the 
airwaves. 

As reported in last Friday's Observer, WSND-FM has no'w decided not 
to carry any away games. Station Manager Kate Bernard said that the 
decision was made entirely by the station's staff, as hockey "is not 
compatible with the station's programming." However, these comments 
were misleading and do not tell the whole story. 
''The station's staff voted to keep the hockey program by a S-2 margin," WSND Sports Director Paul Stauder related. Bernard later decided to overrule this vote due to financial pressure from the University. ''We sensed that the University was displeased with ha-..ing hockey on 
FM," commented Stauder, "Becuase of this we felt that it would 
jeopardize the funding procedure that the University employs for 
WSND.'' 

"Since they have threatened in the past to cut off our funding, we wanted to avoid that," continued Stauder. "There was, however, no threat made this year before Kate made the decision." 
For the University to place the onus for the decison on Bernard is simply discourteous and not worth discussing. Jiowever, for the Notre Dame student body to be deprived of the chance to listen to away games serves not to protect WSND-FM's standing as a fine arts station, but to cheat the team of the recognition that they deserve and sorely need. It hardly seems logical that five hours of broadcasting hockey on a couple of weekend evenings is going to destroy the fine arts character of the station. In fact, . the Admjnistration's decision totally defies reasonable explanation, and the hockey team deserves an explanation as to why they are being deprived of this publicity. Maybe we should stop worrying about fine arts and trying to emulate Princeton. Sports are important to our student body-, and our University's Administration should npt make a conscious effort to hinder the Irish hockey program. 
Keenan had the best chance in the half, as a scramble in front of the Stanford net left goalie AI Leverone out of position. But Stanford 
fullback Joe Dowling came out of nowhere to block a line drive shot towards the open net with his foot and boot the ball QUt of bounds. 
Stanford broke the ice in the middle of the second half. Don Zimmerman scored, as he booted in a loose ball after a pileup in front of the Keenan net after a corner 
kick. 

Stanford increased its lead a few minuted later, as Ray "Butch" Weiss used a burst of speed to beat Hickey to the ball on a breakaway pass, and put a low kick into the far corner of the net. 
"This was definitely a team effort," said Stanford captain Keith Connor, whose team finished with a 6-0 record. "Everyone on the team contributed in the win, although both Weiss and Dowling did a great job for us." 
Connor was also complimentary of the Keenan team. "They had some good players, and their goalie (Hickey) was the best that we have faced allyear. We just tried to take advantage of the slick conditions by controlling the ball and using short passes, and it worked well for us." · 
"We played well, but they just outplayed us," said Ted Schade, captain of the Keenan team. "We. just fell apart after they scored the' first goal.'' Keenan finished with a 4-2 record for the season. 
In semifinal play, Stanford de­feated Dillon, 1-0, and Keenan beat Planner, 2-1 in overtime, to ad­vance to last night's final.
