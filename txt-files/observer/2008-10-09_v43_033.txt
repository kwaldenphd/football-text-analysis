ELECTION 2008 
Professors debate role of abortion in election 
Catholic committee members for McCain, Obama argue about role of moral responsibility 
By MADELINE BUCKLEY 
News Writer 
Notre Dame law professors Gerard Bradley, a member of the Catholics for McCain National Steering Committee, and Vincent Rougeau, a member of Democratic presidential can­didate Sen. Barack Obama's Catholic National Advisory Council steering committee, debated the role the abortion issue should play in the voting decision of a Catholic citizen in a packed auditorium in McKenna Hall Wednesday. 
Bradley, a supporter of Republican candidate Sen. John McCain, spoke first, representing the pro-life side of the issue. He said the pro-life stance is based on two beliefs -human life begins at conception, so aborting a fetus is killing a person, and it is morally wrong to kill an inno­cent person. 
"You can figure out that killing is wrong by reflecting on the natural law ... or any society's legal code," Bradley said. 
The moral responsibility for the injustice of abortion is not limited to the pregnant woman and those immediately involved in the action, he said. The responsibility extends to the society that allows the act to happen and the voter that puts pro-choice candidates in office, Bradley said. 
"It is wrong, in my opinion, to support a political candidate that approves or supports these [abortion] policies," he said. "It is wrong to support this sinful structure." 
In order to determine if, as a Catholic, a person should consid­er voting for a pro-choice candi­date, Bradley said the person should apply the Golden Rule ­to treat others as you would like to be treated -to the situation. He said this rule makes people walk in others' shoes.

Community celebrates Yom Kippur 
Jewish students, faculty observe holiday 
By ROBERT SINGER 
News Wrirer 
Starting at sunset Wednesday, members of Notre Dame's Jewish community will officially begin obser­vance of Yom Kippur, also known as the "Day of Atonement," onn of' the most important holidays in the Jewish faith. 
Traditionally. Jews observe Yom Kippur by spending time in prayer, abstaining from work and fasting for the day. 
Notre Dame junior Damian Sharratt, who is Jewish, said he will be observing the holy day by fasting and praying at a synagogue in South Bend with the local Jewish commu­nity. 
Sharratt explained that today's holiday marks the conclusion of the "10 Days of Repentance," which began last Tuesday with Rosh Hashanah. 
"Hosh Hashanah is the Day of Judgment -the Jewish New Year," he said. "It means that for Jews, the entire year is evaluated on that day to see how they did." 
On Rosh Hashanah, Sharratt said, the first of the

BoARD OF GOVERNANCE 

Budget 111otion fails to pass 
By LIZ HARTER and ASHLEY 
CHARNLEY 
News Writers 

The Saint Mary's Board of Governance (BOG) voted Wednesday against passing the Student Government Association's (SGA) budget, a motion discussed last week at its meeting. 
The motion, which needed 16 votes to receive the two­thirds majority, did not carry with a 15-9 vote. Gruscinski said the motion will be pre­sented to BOG again next week. 
The vote took place because it was brought to the Executive Board's attention that BOG might be required to give final approval to the budget as directed by the SGA Constitution, student body president Mickey Gruscinski said. 
"There's a discrepancy in the Constitution," student body vice president Sarah Falvey said. "In some places it says the execs approve it as the budgeting committee and in some it says that Board of Governance has a say." 
Gruscinski read the section of the Constitution about the

I'll admit, my knowledge of football isn't nearly as complete as that of most boys. I compan~ it to a foreign language -1wnn though I've studind it. for years, I will never be at tlw level of a natural­born speaker.

Cirls ask me all the tinw to explain something to them, to give them a talk­ing point or even to explain who the players are. So here's my attempt to put a few necessary Irish football faets into laywoman's terms. 
First. the ofl(msive line. This little tout­nd group is the most important part of' the football team. An efTeetive line blocks the other team's dof'ense from getting to the playmakers. Thus, the quarterback doesn't get sacked (our line is doing well on this so far) and the run­ning hacks havn a place to run (not quite as well. but still better than last year). Without the offensive line, Jimmy Clausen would be getting knocked over morn than Charlie Weis. 
Second, USC. The Trojans are our biggest rivalry, and yes, that does mat­tor. We've hated them since the days of Knuln HIH~kne, which is why today we cheer nvnry year when they got pum­melnd by Oregon Stale and why we refusn to speak to people wearing their gear. As a reeent historieal refernnce point, you ean bring up the Bush Push (look it up. I ~~an't get into it without cry­ing likn a Cubs fan). If that awful nvnnt is evnr mentioned, you must shake your hnad and give a long, sad sigh, showing that you know what happened just a few years b1~fore you matriculated and, most importantly, that you loathe USC. 
Sadly, I'm only two points in and I'm fairly sure I've gone ovnr my word munt. I lnavn you with somn good con­versation starters sure to impress any guy: 
"Check out that great blocking! Jimmy had all tlw tinw in the world to get oil' that Tl> pass!"

STUDENT SENATE 

Group discusses registration 
Senators consider ifscheduling times should be arranged around classes 

By JOSEPH McMAHON 
Assisstam News Editor 
Student Senate discussed Wednesday whether or not registration times for classes each semester should be moved to before or after stu­dents have classes rather during class. 
Senate Academic Affairs committee chair Ryan Brellenthin said representa­tives from the University Hegistrar's office had recent­ly asked him to gauge the response for moving the reg­istration times. As it current­ly stands, registration times are on two days for each class year and between the hours of 8 a.m. and 12 p.m. 
"The status quo is you wouldn't register outside of 8 to noon," Brellenthin said. 
However, because many students have classes during these times, Brellenthin said the Hegistrar's office was considering moving registra­tion times to either in the early morning, between the hours of 6 and 8 a.m., or late at night, between the hours of 8 p.m. and midnight. 
While registration times are scheduled around a stu­dent's classes, Brellenthin said students with early morning classes were less likely to get a good registra­tion time and thus could lose a competitive advantage in registering for classes. The process of deciding whether students register on the first or second day would still be decided based on the last digit of the student's ID num­ber (odd numbers register on the first day for spring semester classes, even num­bers register on the first day for fall semester classes). 
Senate Technology commit­tee chair Devin Fee said problems could arise with students who have difficul­ties registering, as help desks would not be open both early in the morning and late at night. 
Student body president Bob Reish and vice president Grant Schmidt consider changing class registration times Wednesday. 
"You'd be pushed essential­ly to the next business day and would lose your advan­tage if you had an early time," Fee said. 
Lewis Senator Robin Brown said the early morning regis­tration times would be better because people would be too busy with activities in the evening. 
"I think it should be in the morning before all the class­es," Brown said. "People are going to have clubs or proj­ects late at night." 
Siegfried senator Hyan Hawley said students would be furious if they were forced to wake up in the wee hours of the morning or stay up until midnight just to register for classes. 
"I think you're going to have a ton of angry people," Hawley said. 
Overall, student body vice president Grant Schmidt said most people seemed to be happy with the registration times the way they are cur­rently administered, and he said he would most likely recommend they don't change them. 
"There doesn't seem to be an overwhelming response for change," Schmidt said. 
In other senate news: 
+ By a vote of 26-1, the 

Senate amended the constitu­tion to include a new stipula­tion for those appealing for funding from the Council of Representatives' (COR) Collaboration Fund. 
Senate Oversight Committee chair Ian Secviar introduced the amendment, which does not requires that representatives of clubs seeking money from COR be present at the meetings where the resolution is dis­cussed. The amendment also requires the clubs' presidents to give COR one week of advance notice that they will be appealing for funds. 
"If there is no one there to answer questions to help alleviate apprehension, it could put a lot of pressure on the vote," Secviar said. 
+ Brellenthin was elected by a vote of 26 to 1 as the student representative to the Advisory Committee on Academic and Student Life (ACASL), with Brellenthin being the only nay vote. University President Fr. John Jenkins had requested the Senate elect a student repre­sentative for the council, which seeks to integrate aca­demics better into student life.

Lugar said that all forms of alternative energy -biofu­els, wind, solar, nuclear, clean carbon and others ­must be a part of developing energy independence.

"During Yom Kippur. the sin of the golden calf happened," he said. "The basic idea is we have these 10 days to make resolutions and try to correct what we've done wrong in the past and continue to grow." 
It is traditional for Jews to avoid wearing jewelry on Yom Kippur, Sharratt said, so as to not remind God of the golden calf. 
Although there are few Jewish Notre Dame students, Sharratt said he usually feels comfortable practicing his faith on a predominately Catholie eampus.

NATO defense ministers set to meet 
LONDON -When NATO defense ministers meet in Budapest on Thursday, they will face a worsening situation in Afghanistan and vexing qunstions about whether the war can bn won. 
Increasingly, military commanders and politi­cal leaders are asking: Is it time to talk to the Taliban? 
With U.S. and NATO forces suffering their deadliest year so far in Afghanistan, a rising chorus of voices, including Defense Secretary Robert Gatns and the incoming head of U.S. Central Command, have endorsed efforts to reach out to members of the Taliban considered willing to seek an accommodation with President I !amid Karzai's government. 
'That is one of the key long-term solutions in Afghanistan, just a.<; it has been in Iraq," Gates told reporters Monday. "Part of the solution is mconciliation with pnople who are willing to work with the Afghan government going for­ward." 
Gen. David Petraeus, who will become respon­sible for U.S. military operations in Afghanistan as head of U.S. Central Command on Oct. 31, agreed. 
Security agreement still not in place 
BAGHDAD-A U.S.-Iraqi security agreement spelling out how American troops and contrac­tors operate was supposed to be in place over the summer, but the thorniest issues remain unsettled and neither side is budging. 
Time is running out. The deal must be finished and ratifind by Iraq's parliament before Dec. 31, when the U.N. mandate authorizing the U.S. mil­itary mission expires. Otherwise, there will be no legal basis for the U.S. presence in Iraq. 
For President Bush, some of the pressure to get a fa..qt deal has faded since Iraq is no longer a dominant issue in the presidential campaign.

GALVESTON. Texas-The coast here doesn't have the whitest sand or the clearest water, but to millions of Houstonians and other Texans, this is the beach. And thanks to Hurricane Ike, it's also a mess. The remains of houses, rotting cattle carcass­r,s and othr-r dr-bris are scattered along Galveston Island. In some spots, all the sand was sucked back out to the Gulf of Mexico, leaving only rocks. 
Galveston-area officials are scrambling to clean up the sand, which draws throngs of out-of-towners who spend millions on food, rental housing and shopping.

WASHINGTON-With the deepening U.S. eco­nomic crisis rippling around the globe, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain seem to agree the question facing anxious voters is: Who do you trust? 
"All we heard from Sen. McCain was more of the same Bush economics that led us into this mess," Obama said in Indianapoli'i the day after their sec­ond debate. "lie thinks we won't notice" downsides of his health care proposals, but "we're not going to be hoodwinkr,d. We're not going to be bamboozled. We're not going to let him get away with it." 
In Bethlehr-m, Pa., McCain shot back: "I don't need lessons about telling the truth to American people." And. McCain said, if hr, ever did. he "probably wouldn't seek advice from a Chicago politician."

Governor candidate hits the road 
INDIANAPOLIS -Democratic gubernatori­al candidate Jill Long Thompson is spending the week touting her economic plan to vot­ers around the state -trying to draw atten­tion to hnr campaign after about a month without television advertising. 
If Long Thompson can't afford to hit the airwaves, it makes sense for her to hit the road in hopes of earning news coverage from local newspapers and television sta­tions, said political analyst Brian Vargus. 
"She has to go out and just do what she can," Vargus said. "What else can she do?"

U.S.-based scientists win Nobel Prize 
Team discovers, develops green fluorescent protein to win Chemistry Prize 
Associated Press 

Three U.S.-based scientists won a Nobel Prize on Wednesday for turning a glow­ing green protein from jellyfish into a revolutionary way to watch the tiniest details of life within cells and living crea­tures. 
Osamu Shimomura, a Japanese citizen who works in the United States, and Americans Martin Chalfie and Roger Tsien shared the chem­istry prize for discovering and developing green fluorescent protein, or GFP. 
When exposed to ultraviolet light, the protein glows green. It can act as a marker on oth­erwise invisible proteins within cells to trace them as they go about their business. It can tag individual cells in tissue. And it can show when and where particular genes turn on and off. 
Researchers worldwide now use GFP to track development of brain cells, the growth of tumors and the spread of can­cer cells. It has let them study nerve cell damage from Alzheimer's disease and see how insulin-producing beta cells arise in the pancreas of a growing embryo, for example. 
In awarding the prize, the Royal Swedish Academy com­pared the impact of GFP on sci­ence to the invention of the technique is called "Brainbow." reporters. blue, but you never know when microscope.

IN BRIEF 
Federal Reserve loans $37.8 billion 
CHARLOTTE -The Federal Reserve on Wednesday agreed to provide insurance giant American International Group Inc. with a loan of up to $37.8 billion, on top of one made to the troubled company last month. 
Under the new program, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York will borrow up to $37.8 billion in investment-grade, fixed income securities from AIG in return for cash collateral. These securities were previously lent by AIG's insurance company subsidiaries to third parties. 
The arrangement will help AIG secure funds on an as-neednd basis, the New York-based insurer said in a statement. 
As of Monday, about $37.2 billion of securities were available for loans under AIG's securities lending program. 
On the brink of failure last month, AIG was bailed out when the government offered it an $85 billion loan during the ongoing credit crisis that saw Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. file for bank­ruptcy protection and the sale of Merrill Lynch & Co. to Bank of America Corp. In return for the two-year loan, the government received war­rants to purchase up to 79.9 percent of AIG. 
Experts skeptical of mortgage plan 
WASHINGTON -Ordering the govern­ment to buy up bad mortgages to cut home­owners' monthly payments might sound good, but experts are skeptical. They say the plan John McCain is promoting is unlikely to solve the housing crisis that's pushing the economy toward recession. 
One big problem: The vast majority of the toxic home loans that are clogging financial markets and freezing up credit have been sliced, diced and repackaged into complex investments that the government would be hard-pressed to unravel and buy. 
Even if the government did gain access to the mortgages, it would have to pay far more than they would ever be worth, hous­ing specialists said Wednesday. That would effectively bail out banks and lenders with taxpayer money to a greater degree than Congress and the Bush administration are already doing through the $700 billion financial industry rescue enacted last week.

Wall Street bounces between extremes 
Federal Reserve drops funds rate to 1.5 percent; Dow Jones loses 189 points 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -Wall 
Street bounced higher and 
lower Wednesday trying to 
make up its mind about an 
unprecedented coordinated 
interest rate cut by central 
banks around the world. In 
the end it settled on a famil­
iar feeling -fear -and 
plunged again. 

The Federal Reserve, des­
perately trying to jump-start 
the lending that keeps the 
U.S. economy moving, dropped its closely watched federal funds rate to 1. 5 percent. The cut from 2 per­cent took the rate to its low­est level in more than four years. 
Central banks in England, 
China, Canada, Sweden and 
Switzerland and the 
European Central Bank also 
cut rates after a series of 
high-stakes phone calls over 
several days between Fed 
Chairman Ben Bernanke 
and his counterparts. 
But the Dow Jones indus­
trial average lost another 
189 points, or 2 percent, to 
close at 9,258. It was the 
sixth straight day of losses 
for the Dow. The index has 
shed more than a third of its 
value, nearly 5,000 points, 
since its all-time high, set 
one year ago Thursday. 
The Dow opened down

As the debate wrapped up, I was imme­diately bombarded with about four hun­dred analysts ready to tell me all about what had just happened. I immediately turned the T.V. ofT and walked over to my 
computer to write. 
I turned otT the TV. not because I didn't care, but precisely because I was afraid that I myself would be too influenced in an attempt to 


make an honest Jason Coleman judgment of what 
had happened. This would be difli-Man at Large 
cult with the "point" scoring and instant replay analy­sis so common to the major news network follow-ups. As an amateur journalist, my stab at this, of course, will be amateur, but it will be my own honest reaction. 
To begin, I think it is necessary to out­line what each candidate needed to achieve in the debate. 
Since the beginning of the finaneial cri­sis, Obama has slowly been pulling away in a number of important battle ground states. Beeause of this Obama's goals were not, nor needed to be, quite as lofty, so we will start with him. 
Obama only truly needed to hold steady, as he had in the first debate. lie had to keep to the issues that he does well on, the economy and healthcare, and show fluency in the issues that he hasn't done as well on, sueh as foreign policy. 
Conversely, John MeCain needed to turn in an excellent performance. The election was (and is) still dose enough not to necessitate any sort of Hail Mary-type of tactic, but he would have to hit a few runs to slow Obama's momentum. McCain also needed to distance himself from Bush, and eontinue to push the "naivete" but­ton, as he had done fairly successfully in the first debate. Of eourse, neither eandi­date eould afford to make any major mis­
takes. 

While I wouldn't declare either candi­date the winner, it seems that Obama achieved his goals a little bit more dearly than did McCain. A<> soon as the topic turned to the economy, Obama wasted no time in taking the first jab, repeating McCain's oft-repeated statement on the fundamentals of the economy. This works towards Obama's advantage. 
McCain swung back with an awkward eomment on Obama and his "cronies," in regards to some sort of FanniP/Freddie regulation. It was a bit unclear, but it seemed that the cronies to whom he was ref(~rring would have been his fellow sen­ators. If this is the ease, this line worked against McCain's general argument that he is the greater steward of bi-partisan­ship. If it's not the ease, McCain's argu­ment came out a bit convoluted. 
One of the few weak points for Obama came soon thereafter, however, when the discussion turned toward government spending and taxing. When pressed, Obama made a fairly large claim -that all of his proposed spending would be covered by increased revenue-without oflering much in the way of support. Regardless of whether this is true or not, I felt the statement was too large to end the question. 
While I wouldn't consider it a misstep, MeCain failed to press this issue at all, and turned instead to earmarks, a favorite topic of his. In both debates so far, this topic has seemed to completely flat line McCain on the CNN viewer reac­tion graph. I'm just not sure that Americans see this as an issue essential to the state of the economy. 
One of the more interesting sequences occurred later, with McCain chastising Obama for being too hawkish on attack­ing terrorists within Pakistan's borders. He had invoked Teddy Roosevelt's famous adage, "Speak softly and carry a big stick," in respect to Obama's policy. 
Obama promptly turned the situation around, calling to mind far more bellicose statements made by McCain on bombing Iran and annihilating North Korea. If there was any sort of serious headshot in the debate, this was it. McCain was unable to respond effectively, nor made a serious attempt to explain what he meant. 
In regards to how they 1:arried them­selves, I thought Obama did a little better in looking and acting presidential. McCain's few attempts at humor fell flat (in part because the audience was not permitted to respond) and a lew of his comment<> seemed reminiscent of the kid who sits in the back making wise cracks -"We never heard the size of the fine?" While Obama did not make too many seri­ous attempt<> at wit, he seemnd more presidential and in control. I'm not sun~ how much this sort of perception plays into voter prnfimmce, but I think it is important to note. 
Honestly, I don't think either one blew the lid off this debate. Obama was able to foeus the topie back to the economy on a number of questions, which could only help. He also held his own within the town hall fi.1rmat that many believe favored MeCain. 
MeCain also did all right. Although he was unable to really hit any home runs, he did seem to have a clearer plan for the economy and pushed it a little bit morn efl'ectively than in the first dnbate. I le also left out a lot of the gimmicks from his campaign (the suspension last week. for instance) that seemed to bn holding him down. 
My prediction: little movement in the polls. We'll move on to next Wednesday and domestic policy issues.

Frozen bubbles and the mysteries of God 
Being a Notre Dame or St. Mary's stu­dent means having to wrestle with two competing realities. The first of these realities is that. in the person of Jesus Christ, we seek to know the Logos, the 
Divine Word. or as  
so beautifully pre- Fr. Tim Scully  
figured in Jewish  
Wisdom Literature,  
Sophia, the Divine  Faithpoint  
Craftsperson, who  

sat beside the Creator as the world was birthed into being. It is this Jesus, as St. Paul writes, through whom and for whom our world was created, who ordered the world and to whom the world is ordered. So that, as Gerard Manley Hopkins inimitably poeticized: "The world is charged with the grandeur of God." 
So, on the one hand, our world is Incarnational-God dwells within it; ·which means that, by delving into its depths -through natural and social sciences. through theology and philoso­phy, art and literature -we come to know God, and come to love God, and God's creation. There is a wonderful image from the diaries of Hopkins, jn which the Jesuit poet spends pages and pages describing the formation of air bubbles frozen in the lake outside his rectory. He sat on the ice and just stared, mesmerized by their frozen for­mation, and was convinced -perhaps as only a poet can be! -that these for­mations of suspended bubbles, if per­ceived with enough reason, imagination, and faith, would unlock mysteries about the God who created them. I find it a helpful image some days, as I sift through seemingly endless iterations of regression analyses derived from recent survey data for my current research on religion and politics in Latin America. Maybe, just maybe, if I stare and ponder and imagine enough, I can come to know creation -and thereby the Creator -in beautiful ways. 
On the other hand, and at the same time, we in pursuit of a "Catholic educa­tion" must contend with the stubborn reality that, as St. Paul writes, "The wis­dom of God is foolishness to the wise." 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Respect Life -week 
Dear Observer Reader, 

The week of October 5-11 the Notre Dame Campus, in union with the United States Council for Catholic Bishops, will observing Respect Life Week. The aim of the week is to promote prayer for an end to abortion and all issues that offend the dignity of human life, to educate campus on the essential facts of these life issues and to promote practical ways in which students can help to address these issues. 
I can imagine that you, Observer reader, might fall into one of three camps. You might be avidly pro-choice, and with the best of intentions might believe that while abortion is a truly tragic thing, a woman ought to have a right to make a choice about her future and her body. In that case, in the true spirit of a university-which comes from the Latin uni­versitas. meaning "the whole, the total, the universe, the world"-I invite you to come and hear "the whole;" I invite you to hear what we have to say. Your claim is that you care for women-and I believe you do -but we daim to care as well. Thus I invite you to come and see exactly how it is that we claim to care for the dignity of women. 
Pardon if I'm entirely misrepresenting you, Observer reader, and the above might not be you at all. You might be joyfully pro-life, and very much in line with the cause for life. With that in mind, you might won­der, "I know what they're going to talk about, why ought I to go?" True, you might know exactly all that we'll be addressing, but you might have a friend who does not. Further, you might not have heard this or that particular point of view. Finally, as a one who truly cares about promot­ing a culture of life, it is your responsibility to form yourself in the best way to uphold and defend this culture, and a huge part of this week is meant to be just that: formational. 
Finally, Observer reader, you might be neither A nor B above, but rather C: "it's not really that big of an issue, people get too worked up about it." Maybe that's not quite it either: "''m personally opposed, but I think women ought to have a right to choose," or maybe just simply, "I don't really know what I think, and I don't really care." Granted, A and B above are much more defined, but C is the very broad middle ground of the life debate. 
If that be the case, then I'll leave you with this: thousands of people around the world claim that this is a huge issue -one way or the other -and this University is giving you the chance to find out why. And ulti­mately, a university education is about finding out the 'why.' I invite you to come see for yourself. 
If you've made it this far in this letter, I commend you; you've already been far too generous with your time. That's exactly what I want to fin­ish with: time. You are all tremendously busy, and busy with many good things: friends, service, studying, etc. But this year's Respect Life Week I want to challenge you to seriously think about these life issues. Think seriously-whether you fall into A, B, C, above or even none of the above -if you could do something for yourself by attending one of our events this Respect Life Week. 
Will everything entirely collapse, will you not get into law school, will your girlfriend or boyfriend dump you or will you flunk out of college if you spend between an hour or an hour and a half one day of this week to seriously engage life issues? Probably not, but you might end up doing something, quite literally life-changing [no pun intended] for yourself or a friend.

Or, again more poetically, as Pascal said; "There are reasons of the heart of which reason is unaware." The human person is much more than intellect alone. As educators and learners in the tradition of the Congregation of Holy Cross, we consciously seek to be formed in the heart as well as the mind, and to invite and persuade the heart and the mind mutually to form and inform one another. As Holy Cross' founder, Blessed Basil Moreau, wrote, "We shall always place education side by side with instruction; the mind will not be culti­vated at the expense of the heart. While we prepare useful citizens for society, we shall likewise do our utmost to pre­pare citizens for heaven." 
Even more, as we seek to uncover the fingerprints of our Creator throughout creation, we never lose sight of that other Way -the Way of the Beatitudes and the Cross -revealed to us by our Creator's Son, in which creation also becomes known through paradox. In Christ's new creation, which is in no way opposed to God's C~;eation and mys­teriously enlivens it even as it disrupts it, the poor are rich, those who mourn laugh, and the ones who give their lives away in love gain the fullness of exis­tence. 
As seekers of the truth within a dis­tinctively Catholic context, we live and learn in the tension of these two com­peting realities, simultaneously and boldly. We do so full of hope that this tension will reveal, not a more confused understanding of creation, but a fuller one. We do so fully aware that the jour­ney of faith and reason -as well as our common destiny -is infinitely richer than what either our hearts or minds alone could conceive.

Correct pronunciation 
As an enthusiastic Irish fan aHd a mem­ber of the Band of the Fighting Irish. 1 love playing and hearing the Victory Clog, "Damhsa Bua," at Concert on the Steps. 
As a student of the Irish language, I cringe every time it's mispronounced. I know it's a confusing language, but mispro­nouncing Irish week after week at one of the only schools in the country with an Irish language department is truly a shame on the University. Repeated requests for this to be fixed have come to naught. 
The correct pronunciation of the word "Damhsa" is "Dow-sa," wherein the first syllable rhymes with "cow." That "mh" combination is foreign, I know, but just think of it as a "w." Each time it's said "Dam-sha," some sort of strange dyslexic abomination comes through that speaker and makes me wish the school had more pride in our excellent Irish language department. 
JT, I love everything you do for the band and the fans, but PLEASE pronounce it cor­rectly. It's "Dow-sa" Bua! Thank you so much for having enough respect for the lan­guage and the department to say the word correctly. 
Go Irish!

Attire isn't everytlting 
While I agree with a majority of Mr. Mooney's letter ("Of colors and T-shirts," Oct. 7), I must object strongly to the unfair stab he took at students who choose to deviate from the normal student attire. 
Going into this season, I knew that I had precious few games left as a student to enjoy. I thought long and hard about how I could best celebrate and enjoy those games. Without a doubt, Notre Dame football is a spectacle. What better way to celebrate that that to make a spectacle out of my appear-· ance? 
I proudly admit that I am one of those stu­dents who thinks it is "really cool or funny" to wear something other than The Shirt. For the Michigan game I donned a set of overalls with rolled up pant legs over a bright green Irish shirt and a sweet bandanna. You may have spotted me during the Purdue game sporting a referee shirt complete with cutoff jean shorts (a.k.a "jorts") and argyle socks. 
I'd also like to point out that a number of students in the seats surrounding me have taken up this noble practice, and there is a mutual respect and admiration between those who dress outside the box. I don't do this to call attention to myself or to separate myself from the student body. I am merely celebrating and supporting the football team in a different manner than the rest of the stu­dent section. 
I am just as much a fanatic and supporter of our team and University as everyone else. The last time I checked, this is America, where a fan can support his team any way he pleases. 
On a final note, the next home game against Pittsburgh falls on the day after Halloween. I can only hope that a large part of the student body decides to wear a cre­ative costume in order to celebrate Notre Dame, Halloween, and our First Amendment rights. 
Go Irish!

This week, we're aiming for a healthy bent. Sometimes it's hard to stick to the food pyramid when you're surrounded by some or the less-than-optimal­but-so-addicting foods you can lind in the dining hall, whether it's the French fries, the oh-so­buttery grilled cheese or the s'mores (just to name some of my weaknesses). These recipes at least send you in the right dirnction, without loosing any taste, of course. We can't have that. 
This week's recipes: 

Pasta with Feta, Wine Vinegar and Broccoli 
This dish is a lighter and 
healthier alternative to the cream pasta sauces provided by the dining hall, using lemon and wine vinegar to flavor instead of a thick pasta sauce. But don't think that means the flavors have to be any less strong, the feta, vinegar and lemon give this pasta a good zing. 
1. 
Fill a bowl with whole grain pasta (or any short pasta if that is not available). 

2. 
Add feta, red onion and broccoli to the pasta. 

3. 
Drizzle with a good dosage of red wine vinegar and spritz with a lemon wedge. 

4. 
Mix and make sure the feta is crumbled and the ingredients arB evenly distributed. . 

5. 
Heat in the microwave for about 45 seconds. 

6. 
Top with lots of pepper and takn a bitn. Feel free to experi­ment with other vegetablns; both 


edamame and bell peppers would pair nicely with this dish as well. 
Hummus Nosh 
I love that the dining hall always has hummus. If I am completely at a loss for what to eat, it is usually what I turn to. Not only is it delicious, but it also ensures that I eat some of those pesky vegetables, and the hum­oms itself is pretty good for you. Even better, this is beyond easy. 
1. Fill a bowl with hummus. 
2. 
Gather up your favorite things to dip into hummus. Some of my favorites include: pita bread, olives, and bell peppers of any color. Other popular options are carrots, celery, and cucum­ber. Also pick up a lemon. 

3. 
Squeeze the lemon into your hummus and give a good dash of 


pepper. Mix. 

4. Dip away! Didn't I tell you that was easy? 
Quick Tip 

Try this challenge: make a salad without using dressing. Dressing is usually the least healthy part of the salad, and the best thing about a dining hall is that there are so many options that would normally take consid­erable effort to slice and dice. And don't limit yourself to the salad bar. Exp1ore the dining hall for fruits, vegetables, beans, cheeses and meats (got t.o have that protein) to make your salad explode with flavor without drowning in dressing.

Green Bay QB commits to play 
Associated Press 

GHEEN BAY, Wis. -Barring some sort of min or medical mir­adn, Grnen Bay Packers quar­tnrback Aaron Hodgers will onc11 again be playing through thn pain of a sprained right shouldnr on Sunday. 
At least now hn knows hn can do it, 1!1aving "no doubt" that lw'll bn on the field in Seattln. 
With his effort in a loss to Atlanta last Sunday, H(Jdgers rnmovnd any lingering doubts in his own mind about his ability to shrug ofl' a significant injury. 
"Being able to play, and real­izing the pain that I went through last week and pushing through it told me I can play with it," Hodgers said Wndnesday. ''I'm very confident I can play this wnek. I'm hoping thn pain and the soreness will bn lnss, but eithPr way I'm going to go." 
A wnek af'tnr spraining his right shoulder in a game against Tampa Bay, Hodgers played against tho Falcons -and played well. The Packnrs lost the game, but Hodgers won more rnspeet in the locker room. 
Hodgers said he felt a "duty" to play as onfl of the team's leaders. But he was quick to point out that linebacker A.J. llawk, cornerback Charles Woodson and others also are playing through significant injuries. 
"I don't want to single myself out as the only guy playing with pain, because we all are," Hodgers said. "A.J. didn't prac­tice all week and played, Wood's bonn doing it for a number of weeks now. But. as one of the leaders of this football team, I felt like it was my duty to be on the lield as long as I could play dose to the level of efl'eetiveness I fmlll'm capabln of playing at." 
Thn decision to let Hodgers play against the Faleons wasn't made until a few hours before game time. after Hodgers proved to Packers coach Mike McCarthy that he could make all the throws he needed to in a dosed-door warmup session at an indoor praetiee facility across the stnwt from Lambnau Field. 
And whiln Hodgers' participa­tion in practice will be signifi­cantly restricted again this week, he doesn't expect to be a game-time decision against Seattle. 
''I'm going to play. No doubt about that," Hodgers said. "But I'm hoping I can be a little bet­ter for Friday and maybe do a little bit more. But that still remains to be seen." 
Rodgers made only a cameo appearance in the portion of Packers practice that was open to the media on Wednesday. He didn't throw a pass during a jog­through period, then left before full-speed team drills began. 
McCarthy's plan going into the week was to have Rodgers begin throwing on a limited basis Thursday, but the Packers want to see how he responds to reha­bilitation exercises. 
"lie was sore yesterday so they backed off him, and then they were going to rehab him hard again today," McCarthy said. "We'll see where he is in the morning." 
Either way, Rodgers said the injury is better than it was a week ago. 
"The shoulder's doing better than it was last week at this point," Rodgers said. "But we're just going day-by-day. The guys in the training room are doing a great job, spending time with me. We've been working on strength and flexibility, just try­ing to maintain and feel better each day and go from there." 
Rodgers barely practiced at all last week, but still managed to go 25-for-37 for 313 yards with three touchdowns against Atlanta -and nearly led the Packers to a late comeback. 
lie did make one major mis­take, a fourth-quarter intercep­tion deep in Packers territory that set up a Falcons touch­down. But McCarthy said earlier this week that coaches gave Hodgers' overall performance high marks. 
"I think I proved to the staff and really to myself -although you don't want this to be a precedent -that I can play effectively without practicing all week," Rodgers said. "Now, I don't want to set that as a precedent for the season. I want to be out there as much as I can. but you have to be realistic with the .~tate of my body at the moment. 
For Hodgers, the biggest con­cern about missing practice is not having a handle on what his distance and accuracy might be likeuntil the game starts. · 
But he figures that's how it's going to be until the Packers' off week Oct. 26. 
"That's kind of what I have to deal with at the moment," Rodgers said. "Hopefully my shoulder will be feeling a little bit better this Sunday, but I think until I have a couple good weeks to not do anything, which will be the bye week, that's kind of the pain I'll be in. I think my pain threshold is such that I can deal with that."

Ovechkin focused on Stanley Cup 
Associated Press 

SPRINGFIELD, Va. -Alex Ovechkin is hardly the first professional athlete to empha­size winning percentage above personal statistics, to maintain he's all about team, to insist he won't rest until he's earned a championship. 
"I want to wiri the Stanley Cup; that's why we play hockey in the NHL," he said during an interview at the Washington Capitals' charity golf event this week. "''m always that way. I want to do everything for the victory." 
Standard stuff, right? Here, then, is what separates Ovechkin: He isn't just talk. 
This is an MVP who skates with the rookies, a $124 mil­lion man who thinks nothing of a two-hour drive on his night off to catch a little exhibition hockey, a league-leading scor­er who keeps close tabs on what the club is up to during free agency. 
All with a singular aim. 
"Uitimate"ly," teammate Brooks Laich said, "I don't think Alex will go to sleep at nigh!. until he's won a Stanley Cup. 
Ovechkin took it upon him­self to lace up his skates and get out on the ice at the Capitals' rookie camp in September, a week before the defending Southeast Division champions opened training camp for veterans. 
"I just want to support all the guys on my team," Ovechkin said. "It doesn't matter if they 
play  in  the  NHL  or  the  
minors."  
Coach  Bruce  Boudreau  

appreciated the effort. 
"When I blew the whistle, he was the first one to get over to me, the first one in line," Boudreau said. "And I'm sure -because he's this smart ­he knew players would see that and they would say, 'Well, if that's how Alex Ovechkin operates, that's how I want to operate.' He never wanted any applause or anything. He just knew this was a good thing to do for the kids." 
Ovechkin, who just turned 23, is basically a kid himself, one whose energy, enthusiasm and will to win are infectious. 
That's the case whether he's slamming his body into the boards to celebrate one of his goals or tackling a teammate to celebrate one of theirs. Or trying to beat linemate Nicklas Backstrom at pingpong. Or showing off during a pickup basketball game at a team din­ner last weekend (Ovechkin's mother won two Olympic gold medals in that sport; his hock~ ey jersey bears her No. 8). Or playing poker ("When he

bluffs," goalie Jose Theodore said, "he's going to show you his cards -just to let you know.''). 
Or carrying on during a charity golf outing. 
Ovechkin dished fist bumps on the green of the first hole, then slapped high-fives between yells of "Whooo!" and "Yes!" after his next tee shot. He prepared for a par-3 by bouncing a ball on the head of an iron and jokingly referring to himself as "Tiger." He plopped his first effort there into the water, then took a mulligan and put his second try right on the green, turning to anyone who would listen to shout, "Told you! Told you!" 
So much for country club manners, eh? 
"Guys like that -you know why they're always on top. It's because they try to be the best at whatever they do," veteran enforcer Donald Brashear said. "They always try to win, and they always find a way to." 
To that end, Ovechkin's actions speak loudly. 
Teammates take note of what might seem like little ges­tures, such as when he hopped in his car and went to Philadelphia during the pre­season to watch the Capitals play a game from which he was scratched. Did the same thing last year. 
The Hussian is no prima donna on skates, either. He ranked in the league's top 10 in hits last season and helped kill penalties this preseason ­doing the latter, Ovechkin said, because then "the whole team trusts you" -even though those aren't the skills that prompted the Capitals to rebuild around him. 
They, of course, were fasci­nated by the talent that allowed him to break the NHL record for goals by a left wing with 65 last season, the first player at any position to top 60 in a dozen years. Add in his 4 7 assists, and Ovechkin led the league in total points. Not only are his 163 goals so far 17 more than anyone else has scored since the start of 2005­06, but his total ranks No. 3 in history for a player's first three NHL seasons, behind only Wayne Gretzky and Mike Bossy. 
Boudreau acknowledges he was nervous when he was introduced to Ovechkin while still coaching W~shington's AI-IL affiliate. 
"Well, you know," Boudreau explained, "it's like when I first met Gretzky." 
Boudreau is far from the only person associated with the Capitals who speaks about Ovechkin in reverential tones. 
"He's a remarkable human being. lie's very self-actualized at a very young age," owner Ted Leonsis said. 
The fawning is the sort that might lead to resentment among teammates. 
"You know why it's not an issue? Because Alex isn't like that. If Alex was like that and just craved the spotlight and just talked about himself, then maybe it would rub guys the wrong way," Laich said. "We haven't heard Alex say one word about himself being the star and himself winning these awards and himself earning all this money. We haven't heard one word of that." 
Instead, they hear about how Ovechkin called a Capitals spokesman over and over from Russia on July 1, the first day of free agency, and checked in with general manager George McPhee, too, intent on getting the latest news.

Tuberville fires coordinator 
after seven games on offense 
AUBURN -Auburn coach Tommy Tuberville fired offensive coordina­tor Tony Franklin on Wednesday just seven games into his tenure, pulling the plug after the Tigers' rocky attempt to adapt to his spread offense. 
The 20th-ranked Tigers have struggled offensively all season after entering as the favorites to win the Southeastern Conference Western Division. They have dropped Southeastern Conference games to LSU and Vanderbilt after beating Mississippi State by a score of 3-2. 
"After evaluating where we are at this point of the season offensively, I felt it was in the best interest of the Auburn football program to make this change," Tuberville said. ''I'm not satisfied with where we are and I am personally going to take a larg­er role with the offense the remain­der of the season. 
Utley and Howard lacking 
any production in playoffs 
PHILADELPHIA -For all their big hits and long homers during the regular season, Chase Utley and Ryan Howard have to provide the Philadelphia Phillies with more offense in October. 
The slumping stars were a com­bined 4-for-26 in the first round of the playoffs against Milwaukee, but strong pitching and timely hitting from other Phillies carried the team into the NL championship series against Los Angeles. Utley and Howard also had troubles in their postseason debuts last year, and Philadelphia was swept out of the first round by Colorado. 
If the Phillies are going to beat the Dodgers and advance to the World Series for the first time since 1993, they'll need their 3-4 hitters to break out of their funks. Game 1 of the NLCS is Thursday night at Citizens Bank Park. 
QB Brady has succesful 
surgery on his left knee 
BOSTON -New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady underwent surgery on his left knee this week, a month after he was sidelined with the season-ending injury, The Boston Globe said. 
The paper reported Wednesday that the operation was performed Monday in Los Angeles. Brady's replacement, Matt Cassel, said he tried calling him. 
"I haven't gotten a return phone call yet," he said. ''I'm sure he's just resting." 
Patriots spokesman Stacey James declined comment. Coach Bill Belichick refused comment during his regular news conference Wednesday at San Jose State, where the team is practicing for Sunday's game at the San Diego Chargers. 
"We're not going to comment on anybody's situation," he said. "We're not going to get into a daily update."

That doesn't make him 
Boston's aco. 

Josh Beckett is still No. 1 in 
the Hed Sox rotation -espe­
cially during the playoffs ­

even though he had the worst 
outing of the three Boston 
starters who faced the Los 
Angeles Angels in the first 
round. Beckett, coming ofT a 
strained side muscle, is sched­
uled to pitch Game 2 in the 
best-of-seven series against the 
Hays. 

"Before Beckett's last start, he was the best postseason pitcher maybe in the history of the game," Hed Sox manager Terry Francona said Wednesday after announcing his rotation. "lie had the audacity to be a little rusty after two weeks. We don't need to run away from Beckett, we need to get him on a run." 
l<rancona chose Matsuzaka to start against the Hays in Game 1 not because of Bnekett's injury, and certainly not because the team lost any faith in a guy who won five straight postseason outings bel"ore Boston's Game 3 loss to the Angels. Even with his off night versus L.A., Beekett is 6­2 with a 2.09 EHA in his post­season career. 
Instead, l<rancona said, the Hed Sox schnduled Beckett for the second game because it would give him, Matsuzaka and Game 3 starter Jon Lester essentially the same amount of rest. Tim Wakefield will start Game 4, with Matsuzaka, Beckett and Lester ready to piteh again in Games 5-7 if necessary. 
"Nobody's going to throw three," Francona said. "So hav­ing those three twice is really what's important, regardless of how it's lined up." 
Matsuzaka was 18-3 with a 
2.90 EHA this season, best among the Boston starters in both categories. But he also led the rotation with 94 walks, raising his pitch count and lim­iting him to 16 7 2-3 innings. 
"We're going to have to wait him out and see how he's throwing," Hays rookie Evan Longoria said. "It's a little bit different when you're playing in a playoff game. Walks are so important. and if he's going to come out and do what hP. nor­mally does, he usually walks a ton of guys and throws a lot of pitches early. If we can get him on the ropes early, we've really got to take advantage of that." 
In the NL, Philadelphia and the Los Angeles Dodgers begin their series Thursday night, with Cole llamels facing Derek Lowe in Game 1. The Phillies haven't made it to the World Series since losing to Toronto in 1993, and thP. Dodgers haven't been there sincP. thP.ir victory over Oakland in 1988. 
The Hed Sox have gone twiee since 2004, sweeping the Series both times. But the Hays had never finished above .500 bP.fore this year, posting the worst record in the majors in '07.

Sox charge. 

The Hays again took two of three from Boston a week later at home to cement their hold on the division lead, going on to win by two games and leave the Hed Sox as the wild card. Tampa Bay then dispatched the Chicago White Sox 3-1 in the best-of-live first round. 
And they no longer qualify as surprising. 
"It shouldn't be a surprise 162 games and a playoff series that they're good," Francona said. "I understand some of the story behind this.

McNabb calls llleeting after losses 
Associated Press 
PHILADELPHIA -Donovan McNabb decided it was time to speak up. 
After a pair of disheartening losses dropped the Eagles to 2­3 and the bottom of the com­petitive NFC East, the veteran quarterback called a team meeting earlier this week. 
"I tried to let them know that it's easy for us to sit and say we could be undefeated right now or we should be 4-1, whatever it may be, but we're not," McNabb said. "So, in order for us to correct that and put these four or five games behind us, we have to do it right now." 
Against Washington last 
week, the Eagles

the game. In the have to prove 
competitive and I hate losing, and especially hate losing in that fashion." 
On his blog, McNabb wrote Tuesday that he was "embar­rassed" by the team's perform­ance. 
"''m embarrassed with the way we played the past two weeks," McNabb wrote. "I believe that we lost to teams we should have beaten. Not because I think they are not good-they are. But I still believe we are better; we just didn't show it." 
McNabb did not single out any teammates for criticism, saying only that he didn't do enough to win, and added it's 
not too late to 
turn the sea­
son around. 
''I'm better 

fourth quarter they had to set­tle for a field goal after driving to the Washington 2-yard line and eventually lost, 23-17. · 
Against the Bears the previ­ous week, the Eagles snapped out of a second-half offensive lull long enough to drive inside the Bears' 5-yard line in the closing minutes. But Philadelphia failed to score the go-ahead touchdown on three runs from the 1 in a 24-20 defeat. 
"There is no reason for us to come out the way we did early in the season and to be where we are at right now," McNabb said. "People take it hard. I'm one of the guys who are very it." 
McNabb was 

impressive the first two weeks but has been unspectacular the last three games. He's completed 64 per­cent of his passes for 1,296 yards and six touchdowns with two interceptions and a quar­terback rating of 92.9. 
There was plenty he could have done better against Washington, he said. 
''I'm very hard on myself. If it's a throw that I missed that I know I can make, that's some­thing that I have to correct," McNabb said. "If it's a sudden movement in the pocket to buy a little time, that's something that I also see." 
McNabb and the Eagles 

could be missing a big offen­sive weapon if running back Brian Westbrook is unable to play against the 49ers. 
After sitting out the Bears game with an ankle injury, Westbrook broke two ribs early in the game against Washington. He was able to return after an injection of 
painkillers,  but  sat  out  
Wednesday's practice.  
"I  am  just trying  to  get  

healthy enough to play and get to the point where the pain is not as strong and try to get out there on the field," Westbrook said. 
"You try to go out there, you want to be as healthy as possi­ble and produce for your team. When you're out there and you keep getting injured and keep getting nicked up, it's tough to handle that type of thing." 
Coach Andy Reid praised Westbrook's toughness but did not know if he could play this week. 
"He was a warrior in that game, being able to play," Reid said. "We've just got to get it calmed down there. We'll see how things go as the week progresses." 
Westbrook finished with 84 total yards and a touchdown against Washington, but the Eagles offense was stuck in neutral for much of the rest of the game after he was hurt. 
"Everyone has to understand what situation we are in," McNabb said. "It's a one­game-at-a-time approach, but you have to have a sense of urgency to go out and change that. And in order for us to change that, we all, collective­ly, have to do it at the same time."

Rays ready and full of confidence 
Associated Press 
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. ­Young, eager and brimming with confidence. 
The surprising Tampa Bay Rays spent the entire season dispelling the notion that they were too inexperienced to compete with the Boston Red Sox, and the AL East champi­ons aren't about to stop believing in themselves now that they're four wins from the World Series. 
"We don't want to get ahead of ourselves," left fielder Carl Crawford said, "but we defi­nitely feel good about our chances." 
With good reason. 
The Rays won the season series between the division rivals 10-8, tak­ing eight of 
at The Trop, where the Rays compiled the best home record in baseball (57 -24) and won the first two games of their first-round playoff series against the Chicago White Sox. 
"We're excited. This is how we envisioned it from Day 1. The two best teams playing for the American League championship," Rays rookie Evan Longoria said. 
Tampa Bay isn't discounting Boston's experience. The Red Sox won two of the past four World Series titles, while the Rays -in the playoffs for the first time -are just four games into their postseason history.

CHICAGO -Rich Harden's

LAKE FOHEST, Ill. Suddenly, Kyle Orton's play is as dif'l'icult to ignore as his board. 
Quarterbacks who throw for :n4 yards as he did for the Chicago Bears in a 34-7 win at Detroit last week tend to attract attention, and he cer­tainly turned a few heads with that performance.

W h i I e Atlanta's del'nnse ranks just 23rd, Orton will have to kenp an eye on John Abraham, who leads the league with seven sacks. There worn no such issues with Dntroit. 
The Lions fired general manager Matt Millen two wneks ago, but turning around tho franchise will takn time. Orton was brilliant even if he was matched against the lnague's worst defense, eom­pleting 24 or 34 passes (70.6 percent) for an average of

No onn passed for more yards last week than Orton, who sot a earner-high for the second time in three wonks, and only Eli Manning had a higher rating than his 121.4. 
This is Kyle Orton?

lie showed poise under pressure and offensive coordi­nator Hon Turner showed his faith in the quarterback by calling for passes on 14 of 30 first downs before Grossman came in at the end. 
"We're not going to do it if we don't feel confident that we can have success doing it, but also it's a rel'lection or what they were trying to do defensively," Turner said.

The Cubs acquired Harden from Oakland on July 8. He was the losing pitcher in Game 3 of the NL division series Saturday night as the Cubs were swept in three games by the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
The 26-year-old Harden went a combined 10-2 with a 2.07 ERA in 25 starts for the Athletics and Cubs this season. Harden, who has battled arm problems throughout his career, was 5-1 with a 1.77 ERA in 12 starts with the Cubs. 
J-Je underwent an MRI 
Zambrano, Ryan Dempster and Ted Lilly. Harden had five double-figure strikeout games for Chicago. 
When they acquired him, the Cubs knew they would have to be prudent with Harden because of his history of injuries. 
Harden reportedly had a cor­tisone injection in early September. Chicago gave him extra rest in the final month when he made only three starts, throwing 17 innings but averaging nearly 100 pitches per outing. 
"He's had to take eare of this for a long time," Hendry said, adding he appreciated Harden's effort late in the sea­son. "I'm sure there were times he pitched with some discomfort." 
Against the Dodgers in Game 3, Harden allowed three runs

"There was no permanent damage done to the facility," Hendry added. "Honestly, major leagues players that won a division and lost the way we played and then we're three and out, I certainly would have been disappointed if some peo­ple, if they weren't angry either at themselves or angry at the results."

"If you told me today we are going to get 24, 25 good starts out of Rich next year and we're going to have to push him back or miss a start or two here or there, I'd do that in a heart­beat," Hendry said.

"We hope to finish the regular season strong," sophomore cap­tain Kathy Poploski said. "And establish momentum for the playoffs." 
This game will defmitely affect seeding in the women's playoffs. But each team is more focused on setting a pattern for the play­offs and building momentum. 
The teams kick off tonight at 7 at the Riehle Fields. 
Lewis vs. Breen-Phillips 
Though a win is a win, no matter when it comes, a team's first win can set the tone for the rest of the season. 
Tonight at 8 at Riehle Field, Lewis (0-4-0) and Breen-Philips (0-2-2) will face off to determine which team gets its first taste of success. 
Chicks captain Katie Sushinsky believes her team is close to breaking through. 
"We have improved a lot in the last few games," Sushinsky said. "In practice we've focused a lot on scrimmaging and trying to improve on our consistency. If we are able to come out and play two good halves of football like we know we can, we're going to be successful. We feel confident going into this game." 
Although the Chicks will not be able to make the playoffs, they are still motivated to finish the season strong. 
"We are always excited to play, no matter the outcome," Sushinsky said. "It's really important for us to end the sea­son on a high note and gain some momentum heading into next year." 
Meanwhile, the Babes are also looking to rebound, coming off a tough loss to Walsh in which they led 21-7 at halftime but ended up losing on a touchdown pass on the last play of the game. 
"In several of our games, we just haven't been able to fmish," Babes captain Melissa Meagher said. "We've come as close as you possibly can to winning 
without actually winning.  We  
are  definitely right  on  the  
brink."  

Still, Meagher has her team working hard, and she recog­nizes that it still has a lot to play

nine players who have shown, at times, that they are very capable of winning in the lower lineup slots." 
The Irish are coming off an impressive showing at the Wolverine Invitational, where they took five of the seven singles matches from a Michigan team that advanced to the Sweet 16 a year ago. Even more impressive about the five victories over the Wolverines was that none of those victories came from Helgeson who was out with an injury. 
Bayliss also noted that the team's showing against Miami was a good sign of things to come, and a testament to the potential the team has. 
This weekend the team, minus Helgeson will host the Tom Fallon Invitational. The tournament field includes Harvard, Wisconsin, Michigan State, Western Michigan and Ball State. 
"We approach this tourna­ment on two fronts," Bayliss said. "One, to see how we 

for. 
"Our practices have been intense this week," Meagher said. "We've run through our offensive playbook, and we've focused on new kinds of offense to give our defense a chance to see some different looks. We may still have a chance to make the playoffs if we win out, so the time to step up is now." 
Welsh Family vs. Badin 
After an emotionally charged comeback win last week against Farley, Welsh Family fmds itself positioned for a potential "trap game" against Badin at 9 tonight night at Riehle Fields. 
Despite having a standout quarterback in Jenni Gargula and a defense which supple­ments its tenacious pass rush with a ball-hawking secondary, Welsh Family (4-0) hopes to avoid tripping up in a game against the Bullfrogs 
"Even with the big win over Farley, we're just going to try and stay focused and concen­trate on winning tomorrow," Gargula said. 
Badin (1-2-1) is hungry to keep its playoff aspirations alive after a scrappy 7-6 victory over Lewis last week. With only one win, Badin cannot afford to drop another game, and with Welsh Family on the horizon, the Bullfrogs will need to pull out all the stops if they want to topple the powerhouse Whirlwinds. 
The Bullfrogs played stingy defense against Lewis but the Whirlwinds, even with a few miscues against Farley, will pro­vide a stiffer test. The onus will be on Badin senior Katie Rose Hackney not only to motivate her team, but also to pick apart the Whirlwinds' opportunistic defense. 
"The things we've worked on in practice this week have been the same as the previous weeks. This consistency has really helped us put together such a good season thus far," Gargula said. 
Relying mostly on young play­ers, Badin will have to play like veterans tomorrow if it wishes to take down the Goliath that is Welsh Family.

stack up against the other teams. And two, to give each individual the opportunity to garner some good wins. We will move our players up and down the lineup to see what each might be able to achieve. The field will give us some indication of how far we need to go before January when we open with Pepperdine." 
Bayliss said he has a lot of confidence in his freshman class, which has been led by 
Casey  Watt  and  Niall  
Fitzgerald.  
"Casey  Watt  can  be  an  

impact freshman, and Niall Fitzgerald is improving by leaps and bounds," Bayliss said. "[Freshman] Sam Keeton has his arm in a cast, but has taken that opportuni­ty to add better net play and a slice backhand to his reper­toire." 
The Irish will look to show the rest of the teams at the Tom Fallon Invitational how dangerous they can be, with the tournament opening on Friday. Helgeson will open today at the All-American Championships.

"We've had the injury bug alrnady," Brown said. "llop11fully we will be able to come baek stron!{. but injuries happen sometimes. Luckily we have lmen able to eomp11nsate for it so far." 
With the Irish sitting atop the Bi!{ East despite all these injuries, there should be a n~newnd ennq.,ry when the t11am finally starts to get healthier. 
"We've moved things around to dna! with injuries more than we would have liked to," Brown said. "But we liJUnd a way to win by playing dill"en~nt positions." 
The brightest spot for the team has been its oll"ense. Notre Dame has the highest hitting percnnt­age in the eonferenee at a .301 dip. The Irish also lead the Big East in assists pt~r game at 14.43 and kills per game at 15. 
"I am pretty pleased with how the offense has played so far," Brown sai?,. "We have really progressed. 
Lmtdin!{ the Irish oll'ense so far have been junior outside hitter Christina Kaelin with 3.25 kills per set, sophomore outside hit­ter Kellie Sciacca with 2.59 kills per set, and freshman outside hitter Kristen Dealy with 2.67 kills per set. 
Dealy has been a pleasant sur­prise for the Irish so far this ynar. 
"Dealy is doing a really, really !{ood job," Brown said. "Whether its passing, defense, or serving, she is playing evcrythin!{ very well. She has really steppnd in." 
What worries Brown, however, is the state of the defense and the laek of opportunities that are bning gennrated for their potent oll"ense. 
"Our hitting percentage is very good, but our defense is not so good," Brown said. "We've stru!{gled with our serves, our blocks and our defense in gener­al. We need to practice our serves morn."

The Irish defense shut down not only DeMartin but the entire Spartans offense, holding Michigan State to only six shots on the evening.

Irish tied for first in conference at midpoint of season 
Coach says squad must inzprove defense 
By JARED JEDICK Sports Wri[cr 

After reaching the midpoint of their season, the Irish lind them­selves tied atop the Big East standings with St. John's, ·Pittsburgh and Ceorgetown and in position to have a very good second halt'. 
"You ~~an ask anyone on the team, and they would all say that they would like to have a better record," head coach Debbie Brown said. "But we are defi­nitely going in the right direc­tion." 
According to Brown, the Irish (8-8; 3-1 Big East) set three pri­mary goals at the beginning of the season -to go undefeated at horne, win two of their non-con­ference tournaments, and win the regular season title in the Big East. Although the first two goals were not achieved, the third and most important goal -winning the Big East regular season title -is right within their grasp. 
"It's still pretty early," Brown said. "But to have your lirst four Big East games on the road and come out 3-1 puts us in pretty good position." 
The Irish have already defeat­ed two of the Big East favorites in convincing fashion on the road this season -South Florida ( 11­7; 2-2 Big East) and Louisville (6­8; 2-2 Big East). Louisville was picked by the Big East eoaches to win the conference this year. 
"Although it was great to beat them, we can't rest on the past," Brown said. "Against [South Florida! we played very well with a lot of intensity, and against Louisville I didn't think we played as well, but we still found a way to win. Going forward it is not going to be easy." 
Adding significance t~ these victories is the fact that they have all been on the road in hos­tile environments. The Irish will finally get a travel break this weekend and play West Virginia (5-10; 0-4 Big East) and Pittsburgh (1 0-8; 3-1 Big East) in front of their home fans for the first time in three weeks. 
"It's not really easier to play at home," Brown said. "But it does give you a lot more control over everything. Everything is more familiar and you don't have to travel, s~. you hopB you play well at home. 
The first half of the season has been partly characterized by a severe case of the injury bug. Junior outside hitter Serenity Phillips has just returned from a

Dike puts team ahead for good with tally in first period

Sports Wri[cr 

For a coach and a team that have never faced a two-game losing streak, Bobby Clark and his No. 14 Irish were very composed heading into Wednesday night's game against Miehigan State. 
Cood thing. 

Notre Dame turned in a con­fident and dominating per­formance, downing the Spartans 3-0 at Alumni Field to got back into the winner's cirdn. 
"We didn't talk a lot about setting the record straight Ihnl'ore Wednesday's game I." Clark said. "We talked about what. we normally talked about -playing with tempo, playing quickly and getting our fullbacks involved in tlw attack. 
"I felt we played well in the other two games, but you can sometimes start doubting yourself. You've got to hold to your beliefs, and I think we did that." 
After being outscored 5-2 in their past two games, the Irish dominated the Spartans on both ends of the field. Forward Bright Dike jump­started the offense once again. The senior has quickly turned himself into one of the most dangerous strikers in the country. 
Dike opened the scoring for Notre Dame in the 39th minute when he received a ball near the top of the box from midfielder Michael Thomas, turned on his defender and fired home from 12 yards out. It was Dike's team-leading eighth goal of the season and the fifth straight game that the senior has found the back of the net. 
"lie's just such a handful for any tPam to try and handle," Clark said of Dike. "l think the good thing is that, after not playing last year, he's finding

After putting up 74 points in its last three games, Pangborn is not short on confidence. 
That confidence will be put to the test Thursday, as the Phoxes will take on Farley (4­1), who is coming oil' of its first loss or the season. 
Both teams are already focus­ing on life artBr f<ill break. A win Thursday for Pangborn (3­
2) will assure it a playoff berth.. Farley is already in great posi­tion for the playoff.<>. but wants more. 
Last Sunday, Farley lost 15-7 to Welsh Family in a tough defensive battle. If not for two deflected interceptions going in Welsh Family's favor, Farley could still be undefeated. 
"It is definitely a goal of ours to make it to the playoffs," Farley senior captain Jenny Holts said. "And lwe would like to] get a chance to play Welsh Family again." 
Boll's herself is especially hungry for a win. Sunday was her first game back from a rib injury. While not at full strength, she will play tho rest of the season. A second matehup against Wnlsh Family. next time in the playoffs, is inspiring, Holfs said. 
Farley will collide with a team stronger than its 3-2 reeord indicates in Pangborn. The Phoxes began the season 0-2, but have since reeled off thwn dominating victories. 
In the past three games, the Pangborn defense has seven interceptions, inducting four by safety Kaitlin Furrey. Sophomore quartnrbaek Gabby Tate has had four rushing touchdowns and four morn passing in the past two games alone. 
Appreciating their recnnt string of vietorins, the Phoxes arc intent on knoping the sea­son rolling.
