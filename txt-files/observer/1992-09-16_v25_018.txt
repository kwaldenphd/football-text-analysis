Art experts discourage removal of art exhibit 
By KATIE CAPUTO News Writer 
A panel of experts in art and philosophy discouraged the removal of Marcia Kaplan's sculptures from the Le Mans lawn at Saint Mary's, saying that censorship is wrong and art should stimulate discussion. 
"The work confronts us and we are forced to respond," said Father Austin Collins, sculptor and associate professor of art at Notre Dame. "Our artistic expression should be as broad as our educational pursuits." 
About 100 people, both students and faculty, attended the discussion of censorship on college_ campuses, which resulted from the removal of Kaplan's sculptures two weeks ago and "concern over the operation of censorship on the campus." 
"This is a constructive and educational way of raising issues regarding censorship of the arts," said Bob Hohl, a reference librarian at the Cushwa-Leighton Library. Informal discussions and concerns among faculty and students led to a formal meeting, according to Hohl. 
Collins said that the intolerant attitude evident on the Saint Mary's campus is "totally inappropriate in an academic environment." 
By removing "something that is going to stimulate conversation," we are rejecting the opportunity to know and learn, said Ann Plamondon, chairman of the department of communications, dance, and theater at SMC. 
"People have different ideas of what art ought to be," but that does not make censorship right, according to Ann Clark, chair of the department of philosophy at Saint Mary's. 
She discussed the female

ley. But the rust belt 
city south of campus 
scared the living corn out of me. 
Crime was rampant, the weather rivaled that of Moscow, and the people of Michiana loved my school's football team, but hated me and my roommates. 
Those were the old days. Over the last month, I've come to a realization. South Bend is a great little town. And if Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students would stick their necks out far enough to see the Society Bank building, they might also see a community which actually has a lot to offer. 
Yesterday, I went to the library. But this library didn't display a garish, 130-foot brown-on­brown mosaic of the Christian savior on its favade. Rather, it was sleek, chic and full of stu you can't find on campus. 
The South Bend Public Library has a huge collection of records, tapes and compact discs, as well as video tapes. You can check them out for free if you have a library card. Their selection of newspapers makes the Hesburgh Library's look like the coffee table in my living room. 
Is your room under-decorated, or looking like a studio in Haight-Ashbury circa 1969, with old Jefferson Airplane black light posters papering the walls? Then take a trip to the library, and check out a painting for six weeks. 
Maybe you are not satisfied with free music, movies and art. Then how about almost-free furniture, clothes and gadgets? 
South Bend is the home of what I believe to be the world's largest Goodwill. In fact, after the Boeing Vehicle Assembly Building and the Pentagon, it is the biggest building in North America. They've got everything from candles to lawn jockeys. And the last Saturday of every month is half-off day. So get out there and buy a barometer, because in Michiana, you need one. 
I'm from Florida, a peninsula renowned for its sudden, drastic weather changes. I love the unpredictability and randomness of South Bend's weather, too. Yesterday we had 85 degrees. We had thunderstorms. Today a major cold front is moving in. This is meteorological beauty, Dick Addis-style. 
But the beauty of South Bend isn't in its weather. Michiana is actually filled with great people who like Notre Dame students. 
Unfortunately, few Notre Dame students are willing to involve themselves in the everyday goings-on of South Bend and Mishawaka. Lots o us take part in service activities, but most of us are also guilty of distancing ourselves from the community of which we are a big part. The people of South Bend tend to see us as rich college kids, aloof toward all those in the real world of Michiana. 
So try a little harder. Make an effort to enjoy South Bend. After all, you do live here.

Hotel rejects American AIDS patient 
TOKYO -A Tokyo hotel refused to provide accommodations for an American AIDS sufferer who was in Japan to speak at a symposium on the disease, hotel officials said today. Organizers of the symposium, entitled "Living with AIDS," requested reservations at the Hotel Toshi Center for Sean Duque, 38, who addressed the one-day event last Thursday. But the hotel rejected the request. "We don't want AIDS patients to stay because our customers will feel uneasy. ... And we're not equipped with hygiene measures," said an official at the hotel, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

HPC discusses taxi voucher program

A man approached two Notre Dame students sunbathing on the dock of St. Joseph beach Sunday claiming he was a photographer for The Observer and asked to take photographs of the women, according to Phil Johnson, assistant director of Notre Dame Security.

Notre Dame security reports suspicious person; vandalism 
By BEVIN KOVALIK News Writer 
A taxi voucher program was introduced last night to the Hall Presidents' Council. 
The goal of the program, introduced last year by a group of seniors, is to prevent drinking and driving and to encourage safety by allowing students to charge a taxi and be billed later, according to Mark Pogue, coordinator of the Office of Drug and Alcohol Administration. 
"This voucher system will be a safe option for students, but if this program is going to fly," he said, "it is going to have to be a student-run project." 
The suspect is described as being a white male, 5'10", between the ages of 30 and 35 with light brown hair and a mustache, Johnson said. 
In a separate incident, 13 paintings were vandalized sometime this weekend in the basic painting room in Riley Hall of Art and Design. 
Three of the paintings were ripped and 10 had paint smeared on them, Johnson said. There are no suspects at this time. 
Johnson requested that anyone with information about these incidents notify Security. 
Members of the organization Students Against Drunk Driving (SADD) will be helping to organize this project, he said. 
More orders for "The Shirt" are being placed today, according to Steve Hank from Alumni Hall. So far the net profit is $100,000 and shirt sales have doubled the original estimate, he said. 
The Lyons Hall volleyball tournament will be September 27 and teams comprised of six students can register for $10 September 21 in both dining halls during the lunch and dinner hours, said Wendy Holthaus, coordinator. 
Lyons Hall will donate all 

proceeds to the American Heart Association in memory of Karen Whitman, a Lyons resident who died of a haert attack over the summer. 
Because there is a lack of places to host formals this year, Senior Bar will be available for non-alcoholic formals only, said Mary Glode, manager of the Senior Bar. 
Senior Bar will also be incorporated into the Weekend Wheels project, she said. 
"This is a great service because it helps to reduce the liability of bars and gets students home safely," Glode said.

Russian cosmonauts move antenna on Mir 

Russian unemployment figures 
expected to skyrocket in 1993 
MOSCOW (AP) -Russian 

MOSCOW (AP) -Russian unemployment could jump nearly 20-fold to more than 5 million people next year as cuts in subsidies drive more businesses into bankruptcy, a senior official said in remarks published Tuesday. 
In a sign of discontent, farmers picketed in cities across Russia on Tuesday, protesting that reforms have driven up the prices they must pay at a faster rate than prices they receive for their produce. 
Inflation has skyrocketed since President Boris Yeltsin accelerated reform by freeing prices last January. But so far his government has balked at cutting subsidies to unprofitable state-owned businesses for fear of sinking them and throwing millions out of work. 
Yeltsin vowed last week to fight hyperinflation by slashing subsidies. A wide-scale privatization program he promised to launch Oct. 1 is expected to cause bankruptcies and social hardship. 
Economics Minister Andrei Nechayev said the number of people needing work next year could rise to about 7 million people, or 8 percent of the work force -about the same as the

imagery in Kaplan's sculptures, saying "it is a sad thing that in this all women's college, we reject that image of the power of the female body." 
Although a member of the audience said the sculptures are offensive to women, art major Valerie Hicks disagreed. 
"I was impressed with the voluptuous forms because of their power," she said "If anything, that power embodies the spirit of a woman." 
Hicks went on to say that she was not offended by the sculptures, but by the vandalism on them. 
Susan Visser, executive director of the South Bend Regional Museum of Art, said that she often is caught between the artist and the public and that she feels that keeping open communication is the greatest challenge in the world of art. 
She suggested that we need to "have communication, keep an open mind, examine the other side and know our own side." She stressed that when dealing with art, we should "constantly re-examine and test our own personal courage." 
"If art is to nourish the roots of our culture, society must set the artist free to follow his vision wherever it takes him," said Collins, quoting President John Kennedy.

Most Soviet spaceships use a different docking system, a so-called "male­female" hook-up in which a probe from one ship fits into a cone on the other, according to James Oberg, an American expert on the Russian space program. 
The Russians are preparing for the space shuttle linkup well in advance, giving themselves plenty of time to test the androgynous system, in which the two ships have identical interlocking docks, Oberg said in a telephone interview from his home in Houston. 
The spacewalk began at 
11:49 a.m. Besides moving the antenna, the cosmonauts retrieved samples from the Mir's solar energy panels and other exposed parts. Examination of the samples will help the Russians determine how much wear and tear the 6-year-old craft has suffered.

Collegiate officials defend rising costs, despite study 
WASHINGTON (AP) -College officials on Tuesday disputed a congressional study that blamed skyrocketing college tuition and fees on administrative bloat and costly academic research. 
Richard Rosser, president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, said that the House Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families had provided an "incredibly simplistic" explanation for the skyrocketing costs of public collegiate education Monday. 
Rosser, one of six higher education officials who met with reporters to discuss wide­ranging education issues, said officials "would welcome a meeting" with Rep. Patricia Schroeder, 0-Colo. and the committee chairwoman. 
Schroeder's committee released results of an investigation that found that tuition and fees rose by 141 percent at public four-year colleges and universities from 1980 to 1990, and by 12 percent for the 1991-92 school year. Inflation was 63.6 percent in the 1980s, 3.2 percent last year. 
Despite the increases, Schroeder said, the amount of teaching time went down and class size went up, with colleges increasing their use of graduate assistants to teach undergraduate courses. Schroeder attributed the changes to an increased emphasis on research. 
Also, the investigation found that the number of academic · support professionals -such as financial aid counselors and coaches -grew by more than 60 percent between 1975 and 1985. Full-time faculty rose by 6 percent, while executive and administrative employees increased by 18 percent. 
"I think what we have is really a distortion," said Rosser. 
James Appleberry, president of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, said that over two years higher education lost $3.2 billion in purchasing power, mainly because of budget cuts and inflation.Appleberry said that last year 22 state institutions began the year with less money appropriated than the year before, while 35 schools cut their budgets in mid-year. This year, 15 institutions had their budgets cut from the previous year, he said. 
"We don't see_any end in sight now," said Appleberry. 
Peter Magrath, president of the National Association of State Universities and Land­Grant Colleges, acknowledged that "there is some imbalance between research and teaching functions at a limited number of schools and universities, maybe 200." 
Robert Rosenzweig, president of the Association of American Universities, said "we need a better way to evaluate teachers" but stressed that the use of teaching assistants is essential.

Endeavour astronauts' experiments yield 'really unexpected' observations 
SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) -Endeavour's astronauts today peered at tiny tadpoles hatched in space as they wriggled around in a flurry of motions that one scientist called "really unexpected." 
The quarter-inch tadpoles hatched aboard the shuttle during the last two days from frog eggs fertilized on the ground before flight. They darted, swam rapidly in circles or floated, tails wriggling, inside two experimental flasks.

The tadpoles' weightless aquatics were "certainly not what one would see on Earth," said scientist Ken Souza of NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif. 
"They were swimming in backwards somersaults, forward somersaults. Some froze, some swam normally," Souza said. "We had a real hodgepodge of swimming behavior from these tads, and that was really unexpected." 
Previous low-gravity tests had led scientists to expect the tadpoles to either remain still or do forward flips, Souza said. The tadpoles will be looked at later in the flight to see how they are adapting to space, he said. 
Also unexpected was the high mortality rate in one of the flasks: Five of six frog embryos in it failed to develop, possibly because of Spacelab's warmth, Souza said. Another flask, in which the tadpoles were a day older, had at least five survivors, he said. 

Astronauts Jan Davis and Mae Jemison had to use a video recorder to beam down pictures of the creatures after a microscope intended for use in the experiment malfunctioned. 
Earlier today, Jemison levitated drops using sound waves, balancing reddish beads of mineral oil in an acoustical chamber using sound from three speakers. 
Some of the eight or so drops drifted off and burst, but scientists said they had some success manipulating a few of the drops, which ranged in size from less than a half-inch to nearly an inch. 
The experiment may help scientists develop methods of processing materials without contaminating them by touching container walls. 
Monday, Endeavour's astronauts got some good news on their frog embryology experiment. 
Four South African clawed frogs aboard the space shuttle were injected Sunday with hormones to induce ovulation.

ELECTION '92 

Candidates continue to bash opponents' former records 
SALT LAKE CITY (AP) ­President Bush told a military group Tuesday that Bill Clinton's draft record ma.tters since any president "might have to decide if our sons and daughters should knock early on death's door." Clinton steered clear of the draft issue while telling the group he was ready to lead the military as commander in chief. 
The candidates addressed the National Guard Association an hour apart in appearances that had been seen as a chance for a hard-hitting exchange on Clinton's descriptions of how he avoided the Vietnam draft. 
Bush spoke of "controversy swirling around" the issue, but his references were brief and, for the most part, indirect. 
Aides said Clinton had prepared a response in case Bush attacked directly on the draft issue, as other Republicans have, but decided it was unnecessary after hearing Bush's speech. 
The Democrat emphasized the subject he considers at the center of the campaign: the economy. "National security begins with economic security," he told the group. 
Bush, speaking first, raised the draft issue even as he said it was not his intention to make a political assault. 
"There's been a lot of controversy swirling around about service to country. and influence to avoid the military. 
and I've read a great deal of speculation that I was going to come out here and use this forum to attack Gov. Clinton," he said. 
"I didn't come here to attack him," Bush told the group. Still, "I want to tell you I feel very strongly about certain aspects of the controversy swirling around Gov. Clinton." 
"Despite all our problems at home, we can never forget that we ask our presidents to lead the military -to bear the awful authority of deciding to send your sons and daughters in harm's way," he said. 
Bush, a Navy flyer shot down in World War II, said, "Does this mean that if you've never seen the awful horror of battle that you can never be commander in chief?" 
"Of course not. Not at all," said Bush, who followed non­combatant Ronald Reagan into the White House. "But it does mean that we must hold our presidents to the highest standard." 
Clinton, who watched Bush's speech on television before arriving at the hall, rearranged his schedule to be on hand to respond to Bush directly. But he ended up ignoring the president's swipes. 
"I will never allow a hollow army," Clinton vowed. "We still must have the best-equipped and best-trained military to meet today's threats," he said, echoing Bush's own remarks.

Environment 
Wednesday, September 16, 1992 page 7 
Being "green" means living simply 

First of all, let's get one thing clear. You don't have to be "crunchy" to consider your­self an environmentalist. You don't need to change your hair or your clothes ...just your habits. 
Start small-don't try to save the planet all at once. It all adds up. You've probably heard the phrase, "Think globally, act locally." That's all it really means. Little things like re­cycling and turning off the lights when you leave a room, or turning off the water while you're brushing your teeth, really do make a difference. If everyone paid attention to the little things they do that waste our planet's resources, the sum of all of these little efforts would have a profound effect on our envi­ronment. 
The fact is, every American produces five pounds of trash per day. While Americans make up only about five percent of the world's population, we use 25 percent of the world's energy. Much of this waste can be easily eliminated. 
The idea of "green consumerism" plays a large part in the trimming of this excess. When you shop, buy products which are re­cyclable and use recycled materials in their packaging. Avoid excess packaging. It may look nice on the shelf, but let's face it, you're just going to throw it away. Buying products in bulk not only saves you money, it also cuts down on packaging. Avoid single-serving products, and stay away from disposable products when you have a choice. 
Now, you might be thinking that that sounds a little too simple, and you're right, it is. While a change in your habits will effect the trend of environmental degradation we see, it isn't quite enough. It's important to see the inter-connection of different environmen­tal problems and how they fit into the "big picture." 
Environmentalists are sometimes criticized for trying to save the world at the expense of humankind, but in reality this could not be further from the truth. Strict policies and regulations advocated by "green" groups are aimed not at restricting individual or corpo­rate freedoms, but at ensuring a safe and comfortable planet for future generations to enjoy. 
Environmental goals and economic well­being do not have to be conflicting issues. For example, the entire field of renewable energy research and development promises a favor­able economic impact. In general, common sense tells us that saving resources means saving money. 
Basically, the message is: Be Aware. Be aware of what you are doing to affect the world around you, and be aware of what others are doing as well. Make a change to impact your environment more favorably, and encourage others to do the same. LIVE SIMPLY, SO THAT OTHERS MAY SIMPLY LIVE.

ND power plant meets regulations 
By BECKY BARNES 
Assistant News Editor 
Energy at Notre Dame is produced by a cogenerating power plant that operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year on a scale incomparable to the average residence, according to John DeLee, director of utilities. 
The power plant is basically a heating plant, designed to keep campus buildings warm, said DeLee. It uses coal, gas and oil in a process of heat co-generation. 
"In a standard plant, that heat would be wasted, but on our campus it goes to heat dorms," he said. 
Emissions from the plant are "standard emissions from boilers," said DeLee. However, "our boilers are more efficient so you don't have as many losses as you do with smaller boilers," he continued. 
The plant must comply with federal and state regulations, which are "many and varied," said DeLee. The plant is inspected every two years and has not had to make any modifications so far. 
The new Clean Air Act has forced many larger plants to make changes, but it has not touched the ND plant. However, the act calls for states to make individual regulations, and the University plant "probably will be affected by that." 
Along with providing heat for the campus, the also supplies air conditioning to campus buildings through chillers, steam turbine driven machines that pump cool water to air conditioning units. The has 13,300 tons of chilling capacity, "which is a lot, said DeLee. 
The plant also maintains an energy management system, which looks for problems in the system and provides the controls for decreasing the heat supplied to dorms at night, said DeLee.

year of the program and more every year since. 
The power plant supplies about half of the electricity used by the University while the rest is purchased from Indiana and Michigan Power Co. The plant is in the process of relocating a substation, presently located by Fischer Graduate Housing, in order to increase the capability to buy more electricity at a higher voltage, said DeLee .. 
The switch will take about three years to complete, but the conversion will provide more reliable and cheaper energy, he continued. 
Superfund program failing to do its job 
Editor's note: This is the first in a three-part series examining the federal Superfund program. Follow­ing are excerpts from a letter written by Jan Edelstein, director of the Na­tional Environmental Trust Fund. 
Ironically, in an election year where change is discussed so vigorously, policy failures are under attack and environmental issues are so prominent, there has been a marked lack of attention to one of the largest, costliest, and least effective environmental programs in this nation's history: Superfund. 
The law is up for reauthorization in the next Congress and is likely to be the environmental issue for the new Congress and a new or revitalized Administration in 1993. Environmen­talists, local officials, citizens, and the business community are all dissatis­fied with the current program. 
The federal Superfund program was enacted in 1980 to promote rapid and long-term cleanup of our nation's worst hazardous waste sites. After 12 years, it has proven to be a dismal failure. Only 84 of the over 1,200 sites on the National Priorities List (NPR) have been completely cleaned up. 
Billions of public and private sector dollars have been spent. Nearly 20,000 potentially responsible parties (PRPs) have been ensnared in a morass of Superfund litigation. And hundreds of communities are struggling with the economic and environmental consequences of delayed cleanup and endless legal wrangling over Superfund sites within their borders. 
Superfund has failed so terribly in part because it was crafted to solve what was thought to be a modest, relatively inexpensive problem. In fact, the scope and cost of hazardous waste cleanups vastly exceeds what anyone imagined. Yet, Superfund is still trying to raise cleanup funds through the system designed for the original problem. 
Congress hoped to make individual "polluters" pay for cleanup and so gave EPA extraordinary powers to raise money by establishing in­dividual liability on a site-by-site basis. The system has turned out to be completely inadequate and inappropriate. 
Virtually everyone involved in the program is decrying its waste and ineffectiveness, voicing what is painfully evident after twelve years: the program is broken and needs to be flxed. 
Without question, Superfund is the upcoming, hot environmental issue. Raising it with our elected and would­be elected officials during this campaign is timely and relevant to determining their ability to ensure that Superfund meets its cleanup goals quickly and cost-effectively. 
Controversy arises over Great Lakes' water 
MARQUETTE, Mich. (AP)-Long unused as a natural resource ex­ploited for profit or export, Great Lakes water now claims government protection as the "gold of the next century." 
Michigan has 3,200 miles of shore­line on four of the five Great Lakes. Nicknamed "the Great Lakes state," Michigan seems to be taking a leading role in the fight to preserve the resource. 
"Water is the gold of the next cen­tury," said Glenda Daniels, executive director of the environmental group Lake Michigan Federation. "We al­ready have a job drain away from this region, and ifwater is going to control where people are, we want to bring jobs back here. 
"We don't want to send our water away to support jobs somewhere else." . 
The eight U.S. states bordering the lakes -Michigan, Wisconsin, Min­nesota, Illinois, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Indiana -signed the Great Lakes Charter in 1985. 
The agreement ensures the states will confer with one another before granting any requests for diverting Great Lakes water. 
A year later, the United States bol­stered that with the Water Resources Development Act. That requires di­version measures to meet unanimous approval from all eight Great Lakes states. 
In May, Michigan Gov. John Engler used that veto power to block water diversion from Lake Michigan to Lowell, Ind. 
The town of 6,400 about 25 miles from Lake Michigan's southern shore had sought lake water to dilute its fluoride-soaked drinking water. The town had been ordered by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1987 to fmd another water source. 
"We feel any out-of-basin diversion must be done only as a last measure and then only in cases of imminent danger to public health, safety and welfare," he said in a news release.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Information is provided about virus protection 
Dear Editor: 
The Sept. 9 story on the Michelangelo virus found on a computer at the Law School raised questions concerning virus protection available at Notre Dame. 
The information provided below addresses virus protec­tion. Further information can be obtained by calling the In­formation Resource Center at 239-8111. 
Anti-virus programs are available which are specifically designed to detect and elimi­nate computer viruses. 
No anti-virus program can claim absolute protection from virus damage, as new viruses or strains (variations of previ­ously discovered viruses) con­tinue to appear on an almost daily basis. 
The Office of University Com­puting has researched several of the leading anti-virus pro­grams and currently recom­mends McAfee Associates Vir­uScan for DOS computers and Disinfectant for Macintosh computers. 
Both of these programs are available free of charge to stu­dents, through the Information Resource Center (IRC) in room 111 of the Computing Cen­ter/Math Building. If you own your own computer, we strongly encourage you to obtain some type of anti-virus program. 
It is important to stay current with the latest versions, to re­duce the possibility of being in­fected by a new virus. 
·If you previously obtained ei­ther ViruScan or Disinfectant, you should check the version number of the program you are

currently using, as both of these programs have been updated over the past summer. ViruScan is currently at version 95, and Disinfectant is at ver­sion 2.9. 
To obtain either of these pro­grams, bring a blank diskette to the IRC and request either the DOS or Macintosh program. 
University faculty and staff should call the IRC to find out how they can obtain the latest versions of these anti-virus programs. 
All campus clusters adminis­tered by the Office of University Computing continually monitor diskettes used in the cluster for the presence of viruses. 
If you are concerned that one of your diskettes may have been infected with a virus, you may visit any of the clusters and re­quest that your disk be scanned for a virus. 
This is actually a requirement to use any of the DOS comput­ers in the Hesburgh Library, Hayes-Healy or DeBartolo clusters, and is done automati­cally on Macintosh computers in the clusters. 
To further protect your data against viruses or any other damage, always make a backup copy on a separate diskette of any work you cannot afford to lose. 
If you have further questions or concerns about viruses please call the IRC at 239-8111. 
Denise Moser Marilyn Van Bergen Office of University Com­puting Sept. 1 0, 1992 
Dear Editor: 

The presidential candidate of one of the U.S.'s two major po­litical parties spoke on campus Sept. 11. 
Unfortunately, some members of the Notre Dame community chose to extend a less-than­gracious welcome. 
As an ardent advocate of the First Amendment, I believe people have an absolute right to peacefully protest and express their views. Those persons who stood outside Stepan Center and displayed signs or distributed literature or discussed their views with others have my full respect and support for the exercise of their freedom to speak. 
But those who, having en­tered the hall, sought to disrupt the candidate's speech merely "demonstrated" their complete lack of understanding of the true meaning of freedom of speech. 
When anyone, minority of majority, seeks to shout down, drown out, or silence other speakers through intimidation, heckling, or other tactics, we as a community should stand in condemnation. 
Such behavior is never the exercise of free speech, it is its suppression. 

Notre Dame, as an institution devoted to knowledge, should not condone such acts. The majority pf the Notre Dame community conducted itself admirably today. 
Unfortunately, the television screens of America will reflect the intolerant, immature, and unprofessional behavior of the few. 
Those who acted this was, whatever the cause they espouse, should be ashamed. 
Daniel 0. Myers Law School Sept. 11, 1992 
.. .but disruption of speech was intolerable 
Dear Editor: 

During Bill Clinton's speech Friday, I was appalled by the behavior of Notre Dame's Right to Life group. 
They were rude, intolerant and immature. The result of· their behavior was to turn me, and many other people, against the Right to Life group. 
While waiting in line outside before the speech, the Right to Life group distributed tasteful pamphlets welcoming Clinton and explaining their point of view. 
The literature and posters demonstrated to all present that the Right to Life group is against Clinton's views on abortion. This should have been an adequate demonstra­tion. 
The group became offensive when Clinton began his speech, however. Throughout his speech, they yelled, booed, and often prevented both Clinton from speaking and the crowd from hearing. 
Notre Dame is supposed to be a liberal arts school. An impor­tant part of that is being toler­ant and listening to all the sides of an issue. 
Not only did the Right to Life group turn deaf ears to Clin­ton's many other viewpoints on issues other than abortion, but they prevented the 2000 other students and staff present from listening to him. 
I am well aware of the Right to Life's opinions; let me hear the presidential candidate's opinions, since I have the right to make an informed decision. 

Many other people feel the way I do. They are all embar­rassed by the behavior of the Right to Life group. They por­trayed Notre Dame as rude children, not willing to listen nor allowing opposing points of view. 
Previously, I had felt ambiva­lent to both pro-life and pro­choice groups, but after this display I feel too embarrassed and disgusted to side with Notre Dame's Right to Life group.

reg Brady was never my favorite 
Brady son. 

In fact, Peter was much cuter. Especially after the perm. Lenny and Squiggy always kind of repulsed me, in a cute sort of way. 
What ever happened to the television of the 70s and early 80s? Can shows like "Blossom" and "Alf' truly replace "Diff'rent Strokes" and "M.A.S.H." in the hearts of America? 
I think not. 
I grew up as a disciple of the boob tube. Year after year, my parents would try to set limits on the amount of time I spent glued to the set. But it didn't work. I was hooked. 
"The Bugaloos" fascinated me. "Sigmund the Sea Monster" made me laugh. I wanted to be either Electra Woman or Dyna Girl. 
Waking up extra-early guaranteed time to watch the end of Gary Gnu's newscast on "The Great Space Coaster." Wasn't life great? 
But afternoon TV was just as good. Maybe even better. 
From "Bosom Buddies" with Tom Hanks and Peter Scolari to "Good Times" with Jimmy Walker (a.k.a. Kid Dynomite), afternoon television in the 70s couldn't have been better. 
Remember sitting in front of the TV watching "The Facts of Life" or "Three's Company," ready at any given moment to change the channel if Mom walked in? I never really understood why Mom didn't think Jack Tripper should live with two women, but I figured if she didn't like it, it had to be good. 
Even game shows were great. "Tic Tac Dough's" Wink Martindale and Richard Dawson of "The Family Feud" entertained and wooed countless American women. 
Saturday mornings would not have been the same without television-most importantly, "Schoolhouse Rock" on ABC. There was some kind of great satisfaction in watching that bill sit on Capitol Hill and become a law. 
From "Conjunction, junction, what's your function?" to "Lolly, lolly, lolly, get your adverbs here," the phonics and grammar skills of America's youth were forever improved. 
The original "Captain Caveman" and the "Superfriends" could hold their own against a Ninja Turtle any day. Between Wonder Woman's invisible jet and "Wonder twin powers, activate," the world was theirs to conquer. 
Musical television was always close at hand. The words "originality, style and showmanship" would never be the same after being first uttered by Denny Terrio, and how could lipsinc have become such a staple of American life without the help of Alan Faucett and "Puttin' on the Hits?" 
Marilyn McCoo and the Solid Gold dancers brought disco to new heights, as Donny and Marie squabbled over country vs. rock 'n' roll. 
Nighttime TV was always classic. "Charlie's Angels," "The Love Boat" (how did Dr. Bricker get all those babes?) and "Fantasy Island" all shaped and molded us into the people we are today. OK, maybe not. 
But it does appear that the television of our youth is making a comeback. 
How else can you explain the success of Barry Williams' book "Growing up Brady?" Or the fact that Donny Osmond is starring in the current musical "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat"? 
Re-runs of our favorites are forever popular, and we're always interested in the latest scandals involving the Drummond and Brady kids. 
It's time to re-vamp American television. The desire of the American public is there. How hard could it be? After all, as the Brady's say: "When it's time to change ... "

The last year has been a tough one for Tesla. 
A band which claimed several major pop-rock successes since 1988 suddenly disappeared on the radio, as new musical icons, fertilized by Nirvana and Lollapalooza, sprouted from the west coast. 
But Tesla hasn't been forced to sell its equipment-yet. While Pearl Jam and Red Hot Chili Peppers are this season's talk among the masses, Tesla's Psychotic Supper has quietly reached the top 15 of the Billboard album chart and sold a mildly impressive 500,000 copies. The band's three previous albums were platinum sellers. 
Tonight, Tesla will play in the south dome of the JACC. The band comes to South Bend after shows in Noblesville and Evansville kicked off September. 
The group's gimmicky reverence of scientist Nikola Tesla, inventor of the Tesla coil and, according to Tesla­sponsored propaganda, the radio, has grown quite old in the days since their first major album, Mechanical Resonance, gave the band national attention. 
Tesla continues to acknowledge the work of the scientist, and their own astute acknowledgement of it, with at least one song per album. This trend is continued on Psychotic Supper. 
The album's most megalomaniacal song, "Edison's Medicine," is a misdirected monologue about Nikola Tesla's devotion to science, despite the 
Tesla is already well on its way to the same flavor-of­the-month obscurity into which Great White, Warrant, Winger, and Whitesnake fell. 
scarcity of material rewards for those in his profession. 
Whether correct or not, the par­allels Tesla likes to draw between itself and the man after which it is named are simply ridiculous, self­aggrandizing poses which parallel Spinal Tap more closely than Nikola Tesla. 
But despite the laughs that can be drawn from Tesla's work, the band's core supporters remain willing to buy their product. Tesla is already well on its way to the same flavor-of-the­month obscurity into which Great White, Warrant, Winger, and Whitesnake fell. 
Tesla's opening act, Firehouse, looks like it, too, is headed down that road. After "Baby, Don't Treat Me Bad," the group vanished into the hair spray vortex created by Poison and Bon Jovi. 
Hopefully, fans won't confuse Firehouse with the infinitely more talented FIREHOSE, the veteran Los Angeles trio led by virtuoso bassist Mike Watt, which signed a major-label contract last year. 
Tesla's JACC concert is its third Indiana date on the current tour, which has recently bounced the band around the northeast quadrant of the United States. In addition to dates in Noblesville and Evansville, Ind., Tesla played Chicago's World Music Theater, the same venue catering to the U2 extravaganza this week. 
Tickets for Tesla and special guest Firehouse are still on sale for $17.50 from the JACC box office.

-Free agency beckons 
Ozzie Smith may leave Cards 
ST. LOUIS (AP) -As the days dwindle down to a precious few in the 1992 season, All-Star shortstop Ozzie Smith is looking forward to free agency and perhaps severing his ties with the St. Louis Cardinals after 11 seasons. 
The Cardinals are expected to make Smith a contract offer for 1993 in the near future. But Smith's tired of waiting and would just as soon test the market to see what it will bear for a 37 -year-old shortstop who can hit for average, steal bases, cover a lot of ground in the field and generally defy Father Time. 
Smith wants a multiyear deal and the Cardinals, as they were last winter, are said to be interested only in taking it a season at a time. 
"I never really wanted to test the market," Smith said. "But I think sometimes, as in this case, you're forced to do it. 
"Having gone as far as we've gone now, why not? Why not find out what other people think of you?" 
Smith already knows what the St. Louis fans think of him. Last month a "Save Ozzie" rally was held near Busch Stadium and hundreds of fans attended. A newspaper poll also indicated overwhelming support for signing Smith. 
But with about three weeks to go in the season, Smith is still waiting for the Cardinals to make their move. 
"I haven't heard anything," Smith said. ''I'm just sitting at home, waiting by the phone." 
If the Cardinals have anything in mind, they're not saying. 
General manager Dal Maxvill has been vocal about the Smith situation in the past, defending the Cardinals' decision to pick up Smith's option at $2 million for this season instead of giving 

Smith a two-or three-year deal 
because of Smith's age. 

In spring training he said the front office would assess Smith's contract situation in August or September after it got a chance to watch him play for several months. And just last Friday he said this about Smith: "I'll be talking with Ozzie or his representative here in the near future." 
Not anymore. 

"You won't hear anything more from me about Ozzie until it's resolved," Maxvill said Monday. "No comment." 
Actually, it would probably be wise for the Cardinals to wait until after the expansion draft in November to sign Smith. If they sign him now they would have to include him, as a player with 10 years major-league experience and five with the same team, on their 15-player protected list. 
If he declares free agency this fall, the Cardinals would be free to protect someone else. Smith's agent, Debbie Ehlman of St. Louis, said both parties have agreed to wait to announce any deal until after, the draft. 
"I haven't given that issue a whole lot of thought," Maxvill said, speaking of the team's free agents in general terms. 
What to do? "I don't know if they're going to do anything," Smith said. 
In the meantime, Smith is taking care of business. He may be 37, but he's finishing the season on a hot streak, going 14 for 29 in his last six games. He leads Cardinals regulars with a .301 average, is second in steals with 38 in only 45 attempts, and has made only seven errors.

Nets must match Detroit for Mills 
AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP)­The Detroit Pistons continued a major roster shakeup with the signing of Terry Mills to an of­fer sheet on Tuesday. 
Mills, a former Michigan star, is a restricted free agent with New Jersey, so the Nets have 15 days to match the Pistons' offer, reported to be $10 million over five years. 
Willis Reed, the Nets vice president of basketball opera­tions, has said the club would match any offer Mills received. Chuck Daly, the Nets new coach, also has said he would like to sign Mills. 
Reed was on vacation Tues­day. 
"We've received the offer sheet," Nets senior vice presi­dent Jim Lampariello said. "We are reviewing it and checking out all our options." 
But Billy McKinney, the Pis­tons director of player person-
SPORTS BRIEFS 
nel, said he hoped the Detroit offer would be too high for the Nets to match. 
"We aren't disclosing the terms. But he won't have to worry about purchasing the latest Nintendo game," McKin­ney said. "But even if New Jer­sey does match this, it's just one of many moves we have on the drawing board. We intend to shake things up around here. We have contingency plans if this falls through." 
The way was cleared for the Pistons to make Mills an offer when Bill Laimbeer agreed to have his $1.9 million contract restructured by extending it one year. Laimbeer's coopera­tion was needed to free up more money under the NBA's salary cap of $14 million. 
After trading William Bedford and John Salley, and cutting guard Charles Thomas, the Pis­tons were about $650,000 un­

der the salary cap. 
"This team has a winning tra­dition, and we're banking on that," McKinney said. "Laimbeer's offer is an exam­ple of the winning attitude around here." 
Mills, 24, who averaged 9 points and 5.5 rebounds last season, is a low-post scorer, something the Pistons have lacked since the days of Bob Lanier. 
"What Terry gives us is a guy who can score in the low post, something we haven't had in the last few years," McKinney said. "He also is a rebounder, a good passer, and a big guy who can also shot a 17 -footer when you need him to." 
"Terry would get substantial minutes with the Pistons, and possibly be a starter here." 
Detroit had hoped to work out a deal for a disgruntled Ha­keem Oljuwon of the Houston Rockets. But the Pistons' offer of Dennis Rodman and a first­round draft pick didn't com­pare with other offers the Rockets have on the table. 
The Pistons also covet Stanley 
Roberts, the Orlando Magic's 7­
foot center. 
Big Ten schools under financial aid probe 
CHICAGO (AP) -The NCAA will conduct its own probe of seven Big Ten schools that gave extra financial aid in non­revenue sports, delaying accep­tance of the conference's report on the matter, the league said Tuesday.

cooperate fully with the NCAA," said Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany. "We've shared all our information with the NCAA, and it is currently reviewing the situation." 
The NCAA is concerned about some inconsistencies over rea­sons why the extra aid was paid by Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Purdue and Wisconsin, the Chicago Tribune reported in its Tuesday editions. 
Michigan State, Northwest­ern, Ohio State were not in­volved.

"No doubt there was a great deal of exaggeration involved in the whole affair," Purdue's John W. Hicks said in a letter to California athletic director Bob Bockrath. 
"Apparently, one or two play­ers may have had on cowboy hats (not straw)," Hicks wrote, "and a few may have been chewing stalks of grass. This news was passed along and grew and grew, until some be­lieved these random events were a planned stab at Purdue. 
"Hearing these stories, our football staff used it as a motivator with the team. I apologize for the whole affair," Hicks said. 
Bockrath said he investigated the incident and found it was "a fabrication" that was "unfair to our institution and our players." 
California coach Keith 
Gilbertson said he didn't hear 
anything about the incident 
until his father, a high school 
coach, called him after reading 
a story in a Seattle newspaper. 
"I told my dad, the ol' coach, that the straw hats never hap­pened," Gilbertson said. "I re­ally am offended by that. But, touche. You do whatever you do to motivate your football team. If you've got to do that, well that's fine." 

Purdue coach Jim Colletta 
said Thesday that "a lot of this 
is my fault." 

"Somebody ran in the locker 
room Friday afternoon and said 
he saw the California team get 
of the plane with straw hats on. J 
I mentioned it, and as the story 
went from person to person it 
got worse."

Wrecking Crew leads A&M Nittany Lions' McDuffie 
COLLEGE STATION, Texas sees much room for improve­times against Tulsa and the 
sentenced to rehab stint 
(AP) -"The Wrecking Crew," ment. Wrecking Crew picked it up. 
fifth-ranked Texas A&M's de­fensive unit, is off to another destructive start in dismantling opposing offenses. 
Well, almost. 
The Aggies struggled at times in their first two games, but the Tulsa Hurricane felt the full force of the Wrecking Crew last week. It hopes to give Missouri the same treatment on Satur­day. 
The rich history of the Aggies defense has started to work on the current crop of wreckers, headed by linebacker Marcus Buckley."You hear about all the players who have been great players in the Wrecking Crew," Buckley said. "Just to be a part of that defense makes you play better." 
Feeling the glare of former Wrecking Crew members pushing him on, Buckley played his best game of the season in a 19-9 victory over Tulsa. He had seven tackles -four behind the line -one ·sack, caused one fumble, recovered another and broke up a pass. 
"We started kind of slowly against Stanford and we didn't play well at LSU, but against Tulsa we had to realize that we're the Wrecking Crew and we had to rise to the chal­lenge," Buckley said. 
Linebacking mate Steve Solari 

"I don't think we're as good as last year but the season has a long way to go," Solari said. "We haven't peaked, that's for sure. We need to just work more on techniques and run­ning to the ball." 
The Aggies will take a 3-0 record to Columbia, Mo. They are trying to open the season 4­0 for the first time since 1978. 
The last time A&M held a No. 5 national ranking was Sept. 6, 1977 prior to a 41-3 loss to Michigan. 
The Aggies led the nation in total defense last season for the third time. A repeat by the Wrecking Crew this year would tie the Aggies with Auburn for the most seasons leading the nation in total defense. 
"This defense is getting better and they can be outstanding before the seasons ends," coach 
"You can't have one without the other," Toledo said. "When we aren't contributing, the other side has to be better. Against Louisiana State, they kind of struggled and we held our own. 
"Last week, we put them in jeopardy and they did a great job of holding them to just field goals. We could have lost that game if they hadn't done that." 
Slocum expects Missouri, coached by his close friend Bob Stull, will try to make a target of the Aggies' lofty national rank. 
"It helps them because the coaches coach better and the players play better," Slocum said. "They'll be saying, 'We'd better get ready for these guys. They're ranked No. 5 in the nation.' 
STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) ­A Penn State football player who admitted he took part in a brawl at an arts festival has been sentenced to rehabilita­tion for first-time, nonviolent offenders. 
O.J. McDuffie, a wide re­ceiver, was one of three Penn State players accused of joining in a fight that began early July 10. · 
He pleaded guilty Monday to two misdemeanors: disorderly conduct and failure to disperse after ordered by police. 
McDuffie, senior wide re­ceiver Rick Sayles and fifth­year cornerback Mark Graham, 22, were accused of roles in the fracas during the Central Pennsylvania Festival of the Arts. 
Police said McDuffie and Sayles interfered with officers

"It only lasts twenty minutes?" my roommate questioned in disbelief when I asked her if she wanted to go to the men's cross country meet. 
"Yeah," I replied, "They shoot the gun. The guys run five miles and it's over." 
And thus I introduced two of my roommates to the the world of watching cross country meets. I dragged both of them over to Burke Memorial Golf Course on Saturday morning to watch the men race against Georgetown. 
I realize that there are a number of people at this school who have run on cross country teams in the past, but as a service to the rest of the people who have no clue what happens at a cross country meet or invitational, I present a guide to the sport of cross country. 
Understanding a cross country meet is quite simple. The sport has only one rule: run as fast as you can. You always know which individual is winning because, well, he or she is ahead of the pack. 
There is a twist in this, because although an individual can win the race, the meet is won by a team. Points are awarded for the first six members of each team who cross the finish line, but unlike most other sports, the team with the lowest score wins. 
Runners get the same number of points as the place at which they finish. For example, a runner who finishes first gets one point and a runner who finishes 16th gets 16 points. The more runners that a team has that finish well, the better a team's chance of winning the meet. An strong individual finish can never beat a solid team effort. 
Notre Dame's cross country coaches understand this and encourage a strategy of running in a pack for their teams. A Notre Dame individual may not lead the race all the way through, but the team will run together and slowly chip away at the leader. Hence, a good number of the Irish runners finish high and the teams usually do well in meets. 
Watching a cross country meet is not simple. You have two options. One, you can watch the start, wait around for about 20 minutes and then watch the runners cross the finish line. This option requires less work, but lets the spectator see only a portion of the race. 
The second option is more physically taxing, but it is also more fun. You watch the start of the race and then follow the crowd to various vantage points along the course including the finish. You crisscross the golf course as the runners in the meet run around the outside of it and at the vantage points you get to cheer for the runners as they go by.

Irish assault Valparaiso to even record 
Palmer scores two; freshmen contribute

It was a muggy night at Alumni Field, and the Notre Dame men's soccer team mugged Valparaiso 5-1 for their second win of the season. 
Despite the slick and soggy conditions, the Irish appeared sure-footed as they jumped out to an early lead and never looked back. 
"It's difficult because everything is so slippery and that caused us to make some mistakes," Notre Dame coach Mike Berticelli said. "But overall I thought we handled the conditions well." 
Led by junior Mike Palmer's two goals, the Irish continued the offensive assault that they began in Friday's 7-0 win over Illinois-Chicago. 
Palmer opened the scoring less than three minutes into the game, converting a throw-in from freshman Eric Ferguson. 
Sophomore Tim Oates continued the barrage 15 minutes later after he stole the ball from Valpo goalie Dan Naden and slipped a shot into the corner of the net. 
Kevin Pendergast notched the 26th goal of his career late in the first half on a shot from deep in the corner, giving the Irish a 3-0 lead and moving him into the top 10 on Notre Dame's all-time career scoring list. 
"I wasn't even aware of that," Pendergast said of his place on the charts. "I don't really think about it." 
His goal tuned out to be an important one, as the Irish came out sluggish in the second-half and Valparaiso looked like they might storm back. 
In fact, it was a goal by the Crusaders' Brian Thiel's goal at the 63:11 mark that seemed to wake up the Irish. 
"We should never have let that happen," Pendergast said. "The intensity that we played with after they scored should be there all the time." 
After the Valparaiso goal, the Irish played with renewed enthusiasm and reopened the shelling of the Crusader de­

Strange things happen when a team anticipates a win. A team can becomes lazy and not play up to its potential. 
That's what happened Tuesday night to the Belles' volleyball team. After defeating Concordia University in straight games last season, 15-9, 15-9, 15-9, the Belles were shocked by the Cougars, 15-0, 15-13,15-11. 
In the first game, which took seven minutes, it was evident that Saint Mary's was looking for last year's Concordia team. 
"We were going to work on coming out strong and not letting up, but we didn't come out," explained coach Julie Schroeder-Biek. 
During the second game, the Belles played much better. But with many unnecessary service receiving errors, as well as blocking errors, Saint Mary's couldn't hold on to an early lead. 
"Andrea Salazar played great in the middle," said Schroeder-Biek. "We made their middle blocker stay put, but passing errors hurt us." 
In the third game, the Belles came alive and established an impressive 8-2 lead, but Concordia's Linda Pfeiffer served ten points in a row to give the Cougars the lead and ultimately the match. 
"We didn't show who we are in this match whatsoever," Schroeder-Biek said. 
This weekend the Belles will play in the Baldwin College Tournament where they should participate in at least four matches. 
"We'll make up for this loss this weekend," promised Schroeder-Biek.
