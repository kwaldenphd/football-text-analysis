Students call for instituting course in cultural diversity 
By DAVID KINNEY 
Assistant News Editor 

Students called for the University to make progress toward instituting a course concerning cultural diversity at a meeting between administration and student government representatives. 
One student said that more progress in the area of cultural diversity is crucial because "there is misunderstanding, and, to a certain extent, hatred ... and anger." 
The students, all of whom worked on the committee that wrote the Board of Trustees report on cultural diversity, stated once again that their primary goal is to institute a mandatory credit-carrying course to expose students to diversity. However, they also presented the idea of operating a workshop involving lectures and small-group discussions to set up a foundation on which the University could build. 
The students asked the administration to make some progress, even as little as to form a committee to discuss the possibilities of a required course, within the next month.

The Gulf crisis cannot be re­garded as a purely regional is­sue or as a crisis whose world wide significance is dependent on Arab oil, according to Mo­hamed Sid-Ahmed, foreign af­fairs editorial writer.

Allen, Certo head into runoff 
By JOSEPH ADAMS 
News Writer 
The District 1 Student Senate runoff election did not produce a winner and another runoff election will have to be held. 
The candidates for the runoff election, which will be held Monday, are Billy Allen and David Certo. Allen captured 281 votes for 38.8 percent of the vote while Certo received 276 votes for 38.1percent. William McDonald received 167 votes for 23.1percent of the votes cast. 
The Student Senate ordered this election because of com­plaints received due to cam­paign violations on the part of Paul Peralez, a candidate for the District 1 seat. The Peralez ticket was removed from the ballot for this new election. 
Allen, who captured the most votes in the original election, was optimistic about his chances on Monday. He said, "My experience and record speak for themselves." 
Certo, who gained 109 votes as a result of the new election, credited his "ability to do more effective campaigning" for his increase in votes. Certo said, 'Tm glad to see people thinking before voting." 
International Peace Studies. 
"More fundamentally, it has become the main testing ground for the rapprochement between East and West as applied to North-South relations," he said. This is due mainly to the deterioration of the previous bipolar world and an emergence of a new multi-polar world, added Ahmed. 
The main ingredient in the East-West rapprochement is in­terdependence, however, in the North-South relationship it is unevenness. It is this inequality 
McDonald, who was elimi­nated from the race, said he was "sorry to see" the results, but promised voters, ''I'll be back." 
744 votes were cast in this election, which was 144 fewer than in the original election. Election Commission Chairman Matt Caito blamed the lower turnout on student apathy. "Students are losing interest in the election," said Caito. 
The runoff election will be on Monday in District 1 residence halls during the same times as this past election. 
Of notions which gives rise to diverging perspectives. 
The East-West reconciliation is built upon rules which ap­pear to be of a universal char­acter, but the South is not oblivious to the fact that they are being formulated by parties in the North which represent less than one quarter of hu­mankind, he said. 
"The wave of liberalization that swept through Eastern Europe...was bound sooner of later to spill over into the Arab world...because of similarities 
A student expressed anger that University President Edward Malloy has formed a committee to deal with the problem of smoking on campus, but has taken no concrete action to deal with the problems of cultural diversity. 
One administrator called for the students to take direct action by drafting a clear proposal and submitting to the Academic Council through the student representative on the council. This action would, at least, place a specfic entity on the floor that could be discussed and revised. The issue must be in place if it is to be discussed, he said. 
Administration representatives, which included Patricia O'Hara, vice president of Student Affairs; Eileen Kolman, dean of the Freshman Year of Studies; John Keane, dean of the college of Business Administration; Francis Castellino, dean of the college of Science; Anthony Michel, dean of the college of engineering; Kenneth Durgans, Director of Minority Student Affairs; and Roland Smith, executive assistant to the president, were hesitant to use an administrative mandate to institute the course. 
Mandates concerning curriculum have not been sucessful in the past. The failed Wholistic Health Module was discussed to highlight the problems the surrounding the enlightening large numbers of students about "affective" issues. 
In order to change the attitudes of students concerning cultural diversity, said one administration official, the University must utilize small classes and facilitators trained to deal with the issues at hand. Such complex logistical concerns are difficult to coordinate. 
Students said that a workshop program could succeed in promoting diversity before a mandatory class could be instituted. Trained lecturers and student facilitators could use a variety of experimental techniques as well as large lectures and small group discussions. 
According to students, a program instituted by Erskine Peters, a professor of English, is a. step in the right direction. The program is an effort to expand the topics about which faculty member teach, especially concerning diversity. The students hoped that it could be expanded to involve students. 
The mandatory course, on the other hand, if it were to become a distinct academic department, would involve a long-term commitment. A major difficulty would be the need to recruit and hire qualified staff. 
It was pointed out by one administrator that, in general, such a course could not be staffed by current faculty at Notre Dame. Although many professors may be

in state structure and curtail­ment of human rights," said Ahmed. 
Because they knew it was im­perative to implement a change, a number of Arab regimes in­troduced a degree of pluralism and held relatively free elec­tions, he added. He also said "What finally forced the Arab world to face up to the realities of the new international order was Saddam Hussein's takeover of Kuwait." 
Only in the Arab world has the legitimacy of Sad dam's ac-
District 1 Student Senate 
tions been debated. This is be­cause the Arabs have been ex­tremely frustrated by their in­ability to cope with the chal­lenges put forward by the "new world order." Thus, any Arab leader who even attempts to challenge the West immediately becomes a hero. Saddam felt that because the bipolar world was breaking down he could in­vade Kuwait without outside in­tervention.

·'New Kids' give new meaning to love 


Kids make my proverbial liver quiver. 
Sure, I've loved before. There were the Bay City Rollers, there was Menudo, there was a brief fling with "Ponyhoy" from "The Outsiders." But this 
is it. Joe Mcintyre and I 
are soul mates. I found this out when I was doing "research" on my New Kids story on the 
Paige Smoron 
Assistant Accent Editor 
Etc. page. From a list of Joe's "Fave Raves," I learned that his ideal date would be to ... DISNEYWORLD. (Me too!) Also, he hates war. (Isn't this uncanny?) And this is the clincher: his nickname is "Joey Bird." My mom calls me "Paigie Bird." Tell me the karma's not there. 
It was my cousin Amanda who turned me onto the New Kids. Like all other thinking pre-teen girls, Amanda lives for the New Kids. But she's the best at it. She's so good she set up false residences in 7 states just so she could be the president of more than one fan club. 
We get along fine as long as I promise to keep my hands off Donnie. 
I've tried "real" guys. They send lots of roses. But let's face it: movie stars, rock stars, and MTV veejays are better than Notre Dame guys. Kevin Costner would never be late to the dining hall. Mel Gibson would never refer to you as a "skirt." And a New Kid would never throw up in your garbage can at an SYR. 
True, a New Kid might burn down your dorm ... (Incidentally, I don't believe aword of it. Donnie Wahlberg was set up by malicious conspirators to decrease his clean-cut popularity. Possibly Gerardo of "Rico Suave" fame is behind it all.) 
How great would it be if Joe would write a song about me? With a great falsetto part for Jordan? Can I tell you just how tragically short we are of songs with the name "Paige" in the title? (Tragically short.) I don't know why, because it rhymes with lots of words: rage, cage, visage (ha ha, no, not really). 
Please don't write me letters telling me I'm a brainless, one-trunk-inheriting rabbit­sucker. (That's a traditional Shakespearian insult, but then, it might've been over your head.) I'm really quite cerebral (that means "brainy"). I play chess (albeit impatiently). I quote Chaucer (in Middle English). I know what "euphemism" means. 
I've done a lot of educated, sophisticated thinking about the New Kids, and I've con­cluded: they make me happy. 
I hereby sacrifice myself to the group as a permanent love ornament. 
W~y am I so devoted? I think the thing I admire most about the New Kids is their unwavering resolve in the face of pressure to change their moniker from "New Kids" to something more appropriate, like, say, "Slightly Tarnished Young Adults." These guys aren't afraid to stand up for their beliefs. Plus they're really cute . 
. But Notre Dame men need not be totally disheartened. Try donning some sequins, refraining from calling us skirts, and, well, H'm sorry, I can't help it) ... hang tough.

 NEWORK -Five years and countless accusations later, the fight for the Marcos money comes down to two widows: one rich, the other powerful, both seeking revenge. Imelda Marcos, on the defensive throughout her 
U.S. exile, says she's ready to confront Corazon Aquino in her homeland, whether the Philippine president wants her or not. Mrs. Marcos' attorneys say she's intent on returning to her homeland this July. Her will to return is matched by Mrs. Aquino's determination to keep her out. Mrs. Aquino blames Ferdinand Marcos for the murder of her husband, Marcos opposition leader Benigno Aquino, who was assassinated in Manila in 1983. After Mrs. Marcos' acquittal, it tentatively agreed to settle the suit for $250 million. The deal fell through because the Philippine government wanted proof that the accounts Mrs. Marcos agreed to turn over held at least that much.

University scientists conduct summer lake· experiments 
Special to The Observer 
An innovative experiment continues this summer in a Wisconsin lake to study the ef­fects crayfish and large fish have on the ecosystem in which they live. 
Of particular interest to the University of Notre Dame sci­entists is a species that has re­cently invaded the area, the rusty crayfish. 
Five large enclosures were in­stalled last summer in Carrol Lake in northern Wisconsin, curtaining off these sections from the rest of the lake. This year, in late may or early June, different configurations of crayfish and bass will be added to three of the enclosures. 
The curtains section off areas of 500 square meters each in relatively shallow sections of the lake, from shoreline to depths of·about two meters. According to aquatic ecologist David Lodge, who heads the Notre Dame research team in this investigation, the project is the first to use such curtains to study nearshore ecosystems on such a large scale. 
"We have to work on a scale that's realistic for the organ­isms," say Lodge. "It allows us to examine the entire food web in this part of the lake, putting it all together in one experi­ment." 
Each enclosure contains the typical native populations of fish, lake bottom invertebrates, vascular plants and algae. In one enclosure the number of bass will be increased, in an­other the number of crayfish will be increased, and in a third the number of both bass and crayfish will be increased. 
The other two enclosures will serve as control groups. 
The populations within the enclosures will be monitored closely during the next two summers (May through September) to record changes that take place in the ecosys­tems. 
"One basic goal of the exper­iment," says Lodge, "is to learn enough about the ecological communities in lakes to see if

there are ways we can manage 
the lake by manipulating the 
upper end of the food web. We 
will look at how these natural 
systems are put together and 
what factors are important in 
their structure." 
Three species of crayfish in a 
range of sizes will be included 
in the study, one of them the 
rusty crayfish, an exotic organ­
ism not native to the area that 
has caused a lot of problems in 
Wisconsin lakes' plant and an­
imal life. The rusty crayfish is 
thought to have been brought 
into the area by fishermen us­
ing the animal for bait. 
The introduction of this cray­
fish led to declines of sub­
merged plants and ultimately 
fish populations. Lodge says 
there are three possible expla­
nations why fish became less 
plentiful: 
competition 
for food-cray­fish and bass both eat small invertebrates. 

crayfish's 
destruction of plants, which provide protec­tion especially for young fish. 

disruption 
of spawning-fish lay their eggs on the lake bot­tom where they are readily ac­cessible to crayfish. 


"Hopefully, through this ex­
periment we'll be able to con­
firm which of the three possible 
explanations is really happen­
ing and the mechanisms of that 
process," said Lodge. 
"Once we discover what is ac­
tually happening we can focus 
on ways to reverse the damage 
that crayfish are doing to the 
lakes," said Lodge. "We think 
that will include the use of 
large fish, which have been re­
duced by fisherman, to control 
crayfish populations." 
Lodge believes one of the rea­
sons that crayfish are devastat­
ing to a lake's ecosystem is be­
cause the creature is omnivo­
rous, feeding both on plants 
and animals. 
"Most organisms have more specialized diets," he said. "We're wondering, does this omnivorous capacity of crayfish give them a competitive edge, does it give them the ability to persist even as other organisms are dying out?" 
The rusty crayfish is a typical of invading species, according to Lodge, because its presence has not followed the population booms and busts pattern seen with other invading species. 
Lodge theorizes there are two stable states for lake ecosys­tems: 
a 
low population of crayfish and a diverse configuration of plants. fish and invertebrates. 

an 
abundance of crayfish and a low population of plants, fish and invertebrates. 


He believes that heavy fishing of a lake can cause the shift from the first stable state to the second stable state. 
There's only one way to come out ahead of the pack.

Dennis Cloud, vice president of the Notre Dame MBA asso­ciation, and Coach Lou Holtz presented a check of $ 4368.89 to the St. Joseph County Dia­betes Association Thursday. 
The donation will be used ex­clusively for financial assistance for St. Joseph county residents struggling with the disease. 
Sister Sharon Marie Fox, president of the St. Joseph County Diabetes Association, accepted the donation. 
"We had run out of funds for financial assistance," said Fox. "This is a real blessing." 
According to Fox, the dona­tion "came at a very opportune moment. Being Easter, it's nice to be able to help. It gives peo­ple so much hope to get assis­tance." 
"In the first quarter of this year, calls for financial assis­tance have increased rapidly," said Therese Platt, director of Development and Marketing for

Fox noted that, "mec;lications, testing and supplies can be very expensive" especially while the country is experiencing an eco­nomic recession. 
The ND MBA association, consisting of approximately twenty first and second year MBA students, raised the money through entrepreneurial pursuits. Minus the initial costs, half of the money raised went to the MBA association and the remaining half was donated to the St. Joseph County. Diabetes Association.

"It's beautiful that you (the MBA students) are using your talents and gifts, not for your­self but for someone else," said Fox.

"Diabetes is one charity my wife and I decided to concen­trate on." Holtz added that many people do not realize the seriousness of the disease and view insulin as a cure. In real­ity, however, Holtz pointed out, "the average life expectancy of a person with diabetes is far lower than normal." 
For the time being, the MBA association plans to continue supporting the St. Joseph Dia­betes Association again next year.

Polish consolate members discuss E. European market 
BY ANDREA CAVANAUGH 
News Writer 
In order to create a free market economy, the Eastern Europeans must change their patterns of behavior from "Soviet to capitalist," according to Woldzimierz Siwinski, vice president of the University of Poland at Warsaw. 
Siwinski and Maciej Broz­dowski of the Polish consolate spoke of the problems con­fronting the Polish government in the Spring Forum sponsored by the Notre Dame Council on International Business Devel­opment (NDCIBD). 
Gaulius Draugelis, a senior double major in government and Japanese and a native Lithuanian, addressed the is­sues surrounding the current Lithuanian situation, and Paul Shinn, a junior double major in government and philosophy, discussed the solutions to the difficulties of attracting foreign investment in Eastern Europe. 
Siwinski said that Poland was handicapped by a "destabilized" economy. When non-commu­nist forces came to power in the Polish government, inflation was at 1200 percent and the Gross National Product had fallen drastically. 
To challenge these economic problems, Siwinski believes that an entirely new mode of thought must be employed by the Polish people to bring about a capitalist economy. 
"The basic behavioral pattern is simply distributive," he said. "They are not looking for profit. Cost means nothing." he stated. 
In the Soviet system, the workers simply want to fulfill the planned supply, and gov­ernment subsidies provide the

When it comes to increasing productivity at an economical price, there's no tool that's more able.

difference. Siwinski stated that Polish policies must break this dependence upon the govern­ment and foster capitalist activ­ity. 
Siwinski sees the current eco­nomic stabilization policy of the Polish government as "pretty good." Inflation, although outrageous by Western stan­dards, is basically under con­trol, exports are good and cur­rency is fully exchangeable. 
"We have no other option," he said. "I am sure there will be ups and downs, but this is our only option." 
Brozdowski addressed the microeconomic problems of the Polish transition to a capitalist system. "Our problems do not lie in lack of skill, manpower or democratic process but in the lack of a good business envi­ronment." 
He saw no network to inte-

grate trade financing, manu­facturing and insurance, but recently, the Polish government has made telecommunications, banking and various computer projects top priority to develop this infrastructure. 
"If American investors are prepared and strong enough...especially now, they can make good business in Poland," he said. 
Draugelis said that although Gorbachev has openly admitted the problems of his country, he has not acted definitively to of­fer real solutions to the unrest in the Baltic states. His pro­grams of glasnost and pere­stroika have been left open to interpretation and became the Lithuanian "catalyst for inde­pendence." 
Draugelis believes that through diplomacy, Lithuania can become a friendly trading partner with the Soviet Union. Lithuania can then provide for­eign investment and a bridge for the Soviets to trade with the West. 
Shinn proposed two NDCIBD solutions to help Eastern Eu­rope convert from a command to a market economy.

Christmas in April extended to two days 
Special to The Observer 

Christmas in April, South Bend's extensive 
volunteer home repair program, has extended its 
work load in the St. Casimir's/Ford Street neigh­
borhood over two days this year. 
Tomorrow, nearly 300 volunteers from the St. 
Joseph Valley Building and Construction Trades 
Council and 60 community volunteers will tackle 
major repairs such as reroofing, rewiring, plumbing, 
plastering and carpentry work. 
One week later on April 13, over 3,000 volunteers 
from the community, South Bend, Notre Dame and 
Saint Mary's College will complete a variety of re­
pairs, including painting, plastering, caulking, 
cleaning, insulating and winterizing. 
"We've always done some preparatory work on 
many of the homes prior to the actual celebration of 
Christmas in April, but this year our efforts are much 
more organized," said David Roos, president of the 
Christmas in April Board of Managers. 
"With so many volunteers we wanted to make sure everyone contributed. By allowing the skilled volunteers to go in a week earlier and get many of the major repairs completed, we expect to accomplish a lot more on April 13." 
Now in its third year, Christmas in April helps provide safe, warm, dry housing for preselected elderly, handicapped and low-income homeowners who cannot restore their property by themselves because of physical or financial limitations. 
Sponsored by the City of South Bend, the University of Notre Dame and the Chamber of Commerce of St. Joseph County, Christmas in April expects to complete at least $500,000 worth of repairs in 52 homes in the St. Casimir'siFord Street neighborhood in 1991. 
Of the 3,000 volunteers expected to participate, approximately 2,000 are students at the University and Saint Mary's College. Five hundred are com­munity residents, 300 are members of local skilled labor unions and 200 are employees of the City of South Bend. 
Skilled volunteers will represent the following building trades unions: Asbestos Workers; Bricklayers, Masons and Plasterers; Carpenters and Joiners; Laborers International Union; Electrical Workers; Glaziers and Allied Trades; Ironworkers; United Union of Roofers; Operating Engineers; Painters Decorators and Paperhangers; Plumbers and Pipefitters; Sheet Metal Workers; and Teamsters. 
Last year over 3,000 volunteers helped complete nearly $750,000 worth of repairs in 59 homes in South Bend West Washington neighborhood. 
In 1989, the first year of the project, 43 homes in the city's Northeast neighborhood received over $215,000 worth of repairs. 
The honorary chairmen for this year's event are South Bend Mayor Joe Kernan; Christopher Murphy, president and chief executive officer of 1st Source Bank; Larry Harding, chairman of the South Bend­Mishawaka Chamber of Commerce; and Patricia O'Hara, vice president of Student Affairs at the Notre Dame. 
Christmas in April, a not-for-profit project of the Housing Development Corporation, is funded through a variety of loans, grants and individual and corporate donations. 
For more information, contact Karen Heisler, 239­1616, or the South Bend Bureau of Housing, 284­9475.

Shuttle Atlantis carries 17-ton satellite into .orbit today 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -The shuttle Atlantis was but­toned up and ready Thursday to carry a 17-ton satellite into space to study the incredibly powerful gamma rays that burst violently but unseen through the universe. 
"Gamma Ray Observatory is truly a mission of discovery be­cause we will be looking at re­gions of space that have not been studied before," said Len­nard Fisk, NASA's chief scien­tist. "You have the real possi­bility of seeing phenomena that have not been observed before and perhaps have not been imagined before." 
NASA scheduled the liftoff for 
9:18 a.m. EST Friday but said it could delay until nearly 2 p.m. to wait out any weather problems. In an update Thurs­day, weather forecasters gave NASA 60-40 odds of getting off on time and held out hope for improvement later in the morn­ing. 

The shuttle will be flying for the first time with new comput­ers, replacing the set that was used since the space fleet went into operation 10 years ago this month. The new general purpose computers have 2.5 times the memory and three times the speed of the earlier ones. 
Air Force Col. Steven Nagel and his crew of three men and one woman will be the first Americans to go into space in four months. They are to return to Earth on Wednesday morning at Edwards Air Force Base in California. 
The astronauts' main mission is Sunday's release of the 35,000-pound Gamma Ray Ob­servatory, the heaviest scientific instrument ever carried in the shuttle bay. A day later, mission specialists Jerry Ross and Jay Apt will put on space suits and move out into the open cargo bay to test techniques to be used in building a space station. 
It will be the first American space walk in more than five years. The last American space­walker, in late 1985, was Ross. 
The Gamma Ray Observatory, or GRO, is the second in NASA's Great Observatory series. The first, the Hubble Space Tele­scope, was launched last April and, despite some disappoint­ments in its ability to look back to the beginning of time, is re­turning valuable scientific divi­dends. 

GRO, which cost $617 million, will be 31 feet long when it is extended in orbit. Three of its four scientific instruments are about the size of a Volkswagen. 
Other observatories still to come in the series will study the X-ray and infrared spectrums. 
While the Hubble does its work in the relatively narrow bands of the visible spectrum, gathering light that originated billions of years ago, the GRO operates at the extreme far end -beyond ultraviolet and X­rays. 
In that range, it monitors en­ergies ranging from 20,000 to more than 30 billion electron volts. Gamma rays are born often in cataclysms that flourish in what appears to the naked eye as the void of the heavens -in black holes, quasars, pulsars and supernova explosions. 
If the actions of gamma rays were visible -the rays do not penetrate Earth's atmosphere -the sky would be a flashing, violent sight. 
"This is a continuation of the second age of space science," Fisk said. "GRO will allow us to observe in the universe the most energetic form of radia­tion, gamma rays, with un­precedented resolution and sensitivity. Gamma rays have been studied before with a variety of smaller

Opera diva follows own Reilly exhibit begins April 14 
advice to world renown 
By MARK BERRETTINI 
News Writer 
Over the course of her career, 
Martina Arroyo has followed 
her own advice in becoming a 
world-reknowned opera diva. 
"I think the most satisfying aspect of my career is being able to talk to young people and say this is what can hap­pen, " said Arroyo in the An­nenberg Auditorium lecture Thursday. 
"I like to talk about the past and having memories, but memories fade. So for me at this moment, the most satisfy­ing is to have these memories to share with young people," Arroyo added. "But as far as a performance, I've had thou­sands of satisfying moments." 
Arroyo's career started at the age of fourteen at Hunter Col­lege High School. 
"When I started out I didn't want to be a singer and didn't know I could be a singer, in the sense that I hadn't been ex­posed to opera," she said. 
While standing outside an opera workshop for college students, Arroyo was caught mimicking the singers. As her punishment, the director of the workshop made her sing. After she finished, he told her it was good, but questioned what lan­guage she was singing. To fur­ther punish her, the director made Arroyo take the workshop after she graduated. 
Arroyo received a degree in Education and Romance Lan­guages from Hunter College, so her parents would feel more 

comfortable with her decision 
to be a singer. 
"In my family, education was your life," Arroyo said. "I took Italian and fell in love with the literature. At the Met (Metropolitan Opera) auditions in 1958, I was the only singer who could not read a note." 
This did not hinder Arroyo, who took first place at the au­ditions and won a small con­tract to sing with the Met. After a year of small roles at the Met, the director of the company told her to go to Europe and get more experience. The Met called her back in 1965 and "that started everything." 
Over the course of her career, Arroyo has sung in the major operatic centers of Europe, in­cluding Vienna, Berlin, Zurich and the Met. In recent years, Arroyo has appeared more than twenty times on the Johnny Carson Show and on The Odd Couple, where she played herself. 
Arroyo advised the group to keep in touch with their friends and young people as they move on in their professions. 
"We (professionals) should be available to young people to tell them what is out there," she said. "After four years, students may get out and say, 'What have I gotten into?' I guess that is why I'm here to tell you about it. Give yourself the time to be the best in your profession and you will be." 
The lecture was co-sponsored by the Year of the Woman committee and the ND Depart­ment of Music.

A collection of 78 outstanding Old Master and 19th Century drawings from the Reilly Collec­tion will be on exhibit April 14 through May 26 at the Snite Museum of Art on the campus of the University of Notre Dame. 
John Reilly, a 1963 alumnus, formed the 235-piece collection over the last six years with the close consultation of the Snite Museum staff. The collection consists primarily of French, Italian, German and English drawings ranging in date from circa 1450 to 1900. 
The collection contains a va­riety of drawings, from highly finished works to studies from paintings and larger projects as well as spontaneous initial thoughts. 
Among the other finished works in the exhibition are an impressive landscape of Val­montone by Natoire, a striking view of the falls at Tivoli by Hackert, and two portraits by the influential pastelists Carri­era and Hoin. 
Studies from important known works include a drawing for Degas' first jockey painting and a red chalk drawing of part of a decorative program by Puvis de Chavannes, which is the most significant drawing in this country by the artist. 
Studies for one of Piazzetta's earliest paintings and a major altarpiece by Guercino also are among the recent discoveries

satellites and high-altitude balloons, but never with an instrument as large and as sensitive as GRO. 
For example, GRO can detect very high temperatures flowing out of stellar black holes, and thereby verify that these exotic that have entered the collection. 
Among the more spontaneous 
and fluid drawings represented 
in the exhibition are one from 
Fragonard's famous series of 
preliminary drawings to illus­
trate Ariosto's "Orlando Fu­
rioso" and a landscape with 
shepherds and cattle by Cas­
tiglione. 
The development of drawing 
in 18th century France is well 
represented in the exhibition 
with works by Lancret, Wat­
teau, Oudry, Lemoine, 
Bouchardon, Boucher, van Loo, 
Cochin, Saint-Aubin and 
Greuze. David's portrait of 
Baroness Jeanin and her 
daughter and a study after the 
antique are impressive exam­
ples by the major neoclassical 
artist. 

Other 19th century drawings 
include a dramatic scene of 
Christ before Pilate by Girodet, 
an intriguing double-sided 
sheet by Gericault, portraits by 
Boilly and Lehmann, landscapes 
by Corot, Millet, Daubigny, and 
Pissarro, and a study of a ballet 
dancer by Degas. 
A sheet by Raimondi is the 
earliest Italian work in the ex­
hibition. Other significant Ital­
ian drawings include studies for 
major projects by Tibaldi, Ricci, 
Maratta, and Diziani, ceiling 
studies by Gaulli and Carlone, 
and dramatic figural groupings 
by Giovanni Battista and 
Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo. 
Included in the German selec­
tion are rarely seen landscapes 
objects do exist. The observa­tory will resolve questions of how matter was distributed through the universe and about the processes that followed the "Big Bang," which is believed to have created the universe. 
On their space walk, Ross and Apt will test three prototype cart designs being evaluated for transporting astronauts around the outside of a space station.

entries have been researched 
and written by Stephen Spiro, 
chief curator, and Mary Frisk, 
assistant curator, with addi­
tional essays by the art histori­
ans Marjorie Kinsey and Marcia 
Rickard. 
A number of the drawings in 
this catalogue never have been 
published or thoroughly re­
searched. Snite administrators 
hope that the exhibition, in 
conjunction with the catalogue, 
will prompt further research 
and disseminate the images for 
those scholars and the general 
public who are not aware of 
this continually developing col­
lection. 
There will be a reception for 
the opening of the exhibition 
April 14 (Sunday) from 2 to 4 
p.m. Museum hours are 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday through Sat­urday and 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday and 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Thursday (when classes are in session). The museum is closed Monday and all major holidays. Admission is free. 
The space walk is scheduled to last six hours. 
Atlantis also will carry a package of instruments to measure contamination in its cargo bay during launch. Sev­eral secondary experiments are on the middeck, and the crew will take part in a ham radio experiment in which the astro­nauts will contact amateur ra­dio operators around the world. 
Diversity 
continued from page 1 
exposed to the issue of cultural 
diversity, they may not be able 
to teach it. 
Students emphasized that the University needs something now. It was suggested that the non-academic, non-credit workshops be used as a foun­dation and a transitionary measure on which further mea­sures could be built. 
"The University has the op­portunity to take the forefront on the issue of diversity," said one student. 
The group also addressed the problem of the lack of retention of ethnic American students at the university. Only 7 5 percent of ethnic American students graduate from the University, as opposed to 90 percent over­all. In addition, 29 percent of ethnic American students left the colleges of engineering and science before the end of their freshman year. 
Freshman Year of Studies is using counseling, tutoring, one­on-one work, and other pro­grams in order to curtail these problems. Six-week summer programs have been instituted in order to give students a head start in college court work, especially in engineering and science. A pre-calculus course has been investigated. and the Learning Resource Center has hired a specialist to aid stu­dents in science and engineer­ing. 
One administrator promised that more will be done to ad­dress the issues of diversity in the Freshman Year of Studies.

as provincial conservatives who are interested in nothing other than oppressing women, mi­norities, and homosexuals. I · would like to remind him that many of us have progressive voting records. Furthermore, the charge of provincialism is completely dishonest. Within the tradition of Western thought are contained various political, economic, religious, and ethnic points of view. The tradition that Mr. Mills himself belongs to is Western, for the concept of the equality of all individuals, either before the law or before God, is a Western concept. 
I'm sure Mr. Mills agrees with this. Within the canon of West­ern literature may be found monarchists, democrats, com­munists, atheists, saints, sin­ners, men and women (Mr. Mills may check it for himself: both Jane Austen and George Eliot are on the Great Books list at the University of Chicago, the den of iniquity where the whole idea started). 
Furthermore, the influence of Western writers on what all of us raised in American civiliza­tion do and think is undeniable. The thoughts of eighteenth­century Enlightenment thinkers

probably been influenced by Bertrand Russell or Jean-Paul Sartre. And did not the scien­tific insight of Copernicus, Newton, Galileo, and Einstein completely revolutionize the entire world? Whom did Chi­nese students emulate before government tanks slaughtered them? 
I firmly believe in the intellec­tual virtues of studying non­Western peoples. They are our brothers and sisters in human­ity, and our neighbors in the community of the world. But how can students understand foreign peoples without under­standing themselves? If any of my students rejects any of the ideas in the Western tradition, at least they know what they are rejecting. I do.ubt if Mr. Mills does. 
I must aver that education, like charity, begins at home. We need to know where we come from intellectually, before we can understand anyone else. Even the partial understanding of other cultures is the fruit of understanding one's own.

Dear Editor: 
I feel compelled to respond to a letter by Mr. Scott (The Ob­server, 2/28) which stated that Christianity and warfare are not contradictory. The line of thought in his brief letter left me boggled. For Mr. Scott: "Some claim rightly that the Gospel and war contradict each other but then conclude wrongly that a Christian cannot support a war." 
He does not seem to feel a need to further explain this seemingly self-contradictory statement other than to imply that the Gospels are not meant to "answer every problem in the world." While I do not maintain that the Gospels were written as a "manual of answers," I do believe that Christianity pro­vides the spiritual grounding for the best action in all situations. 
To imply that Jesus only cov­ered certain areas of truth, leaving others wholly up in the air, is both erroneous and dan­gerous. To claim that Christian­ity is somehow insufficient is· to say that we will accept Christianity when it gives us the answers we want, but when it gives us difficult answers we will simply say that it is out of its element and we must take over from there. 

Unfortunately, this seems to be a common human flaw ­from the Pharisees to modern day. to say that Jesus never spoke on the dangers of nuclear war and thus Christianity has nothing to add to the debate is pure folly. Jesus did not teach as Aristotle did, trying to algo­rithmically explore all possible situations. Instead, he preached a spirit of truth, the spirit of God that will always lead us rightly. 
We try to avoid this by saying such things as "Things are much more complicated now." And indeed they may be. but to make addendums to Christianity in our own interests is ulti­mately a testimony to a lack of faith in that spirit of truth, a clinging to our own desires over the will of God who is truth. We gush over the nice phrases of Christianity and quickly glance away from the implications and challenges. 
"Love one another...": are we loving the Iraqis, the 150,000 of them that we killed? No, I will admit that it is not all that easy, but neither is the excuse of self­defense as neat and tidy as 
GARRY TRUDEAU 
many tout it to be. I simply can't imagine Jesus with an M-16 in his hands. I ask you to listen and question, open to the spirit of truth, challenge, don't simply rationalize; we must allow ourselves to be taught by Jesus (his words in the Gospels and his Word in our hearts). He calls each of us and we must respond as best we can. 
"You have heard the com­mandment, 'You shall love your countryman but hate your en­emy.' My command to you is: love your enemies, pray for your persecutors. This will prove that you are sons of your heavenly Father, for his sun rises on the bad and the good, he rains on the just and the un­just. If you love those who love you, what merit is there in that? Do not tax collectors do as much? And if you greet your brothers only, what is so praiseworthy about that? Do not pagans do as much? 
In a word, you must be made perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect."

moments before the big event was to begin. Wide-eyed and full of anticipation, I awaited my first English pre-registra­tion, only to be somewhat dis­appointed. 
The ordeal was not nearly as strenuous as my first impres­sion would indicate. Only one person passed out from sheer exhaustion (and too much beer). As he laid pitifully at the end of the hall, I wondered what was wrong. Maybe English regi!?tration is too soft. Obviously, English majors are too virile and athletically in­clined: mere sleep deprivation is not enough. Next year, in­stead of one lone student in agony, I want to see more. Out­law the futons, the pillows and the blankets! I want to step tri­umphantly over the weak. Third floor of 0' Shag has such po­tential for becoming a true test of endurance. Let the campus, the world know that English majors are a rare and tough group of students like no other. 
When it was all over, I experi­ence a thorough sense of ac­complishment, similar to how I imagine finishing a marathon would feel. On second thought, pre-registration has got to be better. At the end of a marathon, what reward is there? Sore muscles? A t-shirt? I, however, now have British Lit II and Comparative Studies in Modern Poetry. What a rush! 
.... And to that person who cut in front of me and five other people at 9:35-·-watch your­self. I understand that the om­niscient spirit of Shakespeare avenges such unscrupulous conduct. 
Bridget Bobick is a Junior enrolled in the College of Arts and Letters. 
It takes guts to be an English major. "No wimps need apply" should be the slogan in the re­cruitment books sent to prospective Domers. While other students strain to dial their PIN numbers, English majors rebel against technology and modernization. Anxiously, we await each semester's pre­registration test of endurance. 
Rumor has it that this week, the dedicated group in the front of the line pitched camp around 4pm Monday, 14 hours before registration was to begin. And not just any Monday; this was Easter Monday, an official Notre Dame holiday. Unfortunately, no one ( to my knowledge) had to miss Easter. But there's always next year! I imagine Mass held on third floor of O'Shag for overzealous English majors. I wonder if the Honey Baked Ham Company delivers ... 
Overall, the experience was a memorable and beautiful ex­pression of commitment to the English major. I have never seen anything like it. When I arrived at 6am Tuesday, sleep­ing bags and masses of people spanning the entire third floor. Carefully, I descended the crowded stairway and took my place in line on the second floor

Donnie Wahlberg, the first me~er of the group, cultivates an Image somewhere between Vanilla Ice and Shaggy. He's the bad boy, the militant rap stud, and has been involved in several well-publicized fights sometimes with young women ' 
Donnie hangs with Flav~r Flav of Public Enemy, and is usually captured snarling on

film. "I don't want people to see me as pop star of New Kids on the Block goody-two-shoes wholesome boy." 
At the same time, Donnie is the most outspoken against drugs. "Peace out! Say no to drugs."

Danny likes to lift in his spare time and is an avid reader of "Flex" magazine. His better photographs fea­ture his biceps. 
Also, Danny was an A stu­dent, and he has deferred a 4-year scholarship to Boston University until he has some time off from touring.

Joseph Mcintyre, 18, is the youngest of the group, and is by far the dreamboatiest. 
Joey was recruited for the group to be a Michael Jackson-type singer who would appeal to a pre-teen audience, and he sang their first real hit, "Please Don't Go Girl." Unfortunately, by the time the record hit, his voice had changed. Now he sings it an octave lower.

Jordan Knight is arguably the only New Kid who can actually sing. His experience in choirs has given him a distinctive falsetto and the ability to carry the group'svocals. 
Jordan also has the moves. When he dances, his feet are a blur. And when he croons "I'll be loving you forever ... " it's ac-companied by a swoon­inducing, tender, vulnerable

They're h-ot. They're hip. They're permanently on the cover of "Teen Beat." But more importantly, they're almost here. And quite frankly, I think I'm going to scream. 
Hysterics are the customary reaction to New Kids on the Block, at least on the part of their pre-adolescent fans. And on Sunday, Notre Dame will have its chance to scream at them. 
Okay, they don't even play in­struments. But they do perform at least 50% of their concerts live. And if nothing else, they're not bad to look at. 
To their credit, the New Kids take advantage of their popu­larity by making a conscious effort to be good role models for their fans. They emphasize an anti-drug message at all times, and also have been quoted on subjects like the en­vironment and world peace. 
However, their squeaky-clean image has not emerged entirely unscathed. The Globe ran a story by one of the New Kids' ex-groupies, entitled "My Nights of Kinky Sex with Nude Kids on the Block." 
Also, an ugly controversy has been surrounding this tour. Donnie Wahlberg, the unofficial front man of the group, has been brought up on charges of arson, which carries with it a potential of 20 years to life in jail. Presumably, his action fig­ure will come out with a new line of prison garb. 
In addition to Donnie, there are four more sequined studs: Jordan, Jonathan, Danny and Joseph. Pick out the one most pleasing to the eye. It's best to concentrate on screaming one name, and later you can mur­mur it feverishly after you've fainted. 
I'll take Joey.

Male golfers hope to beat weather against top competitions at Indiana 
By RICHARD MATHURIN Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame golf team will attempt to overcome its major foe so far this season, the weather. Last weekend, the Irish were snowed out in two of their three days at the Johnny Owens Invitational at Lexington, Kentucky. 
This weekend they travel to Indianapolis to compete in the Indianapolis Intercollegiate tournament. It will be a two­round tournament to be played at the very difficult Eagle Creek Golf Course. 
The field will include many of the top teams in Midwest in­cluding Perdue, Ball State, Bradley, Eastern Michigan, and Ferris State. 

"I think we'll do fairly well. All northern schools will be competing and that should make the field pretty equal," said Irish coach George Thomas. 
Eagle Creek Golf Course will be especially challenging to the Irish having a slope (course rating) of 135. 
"Eagle Creek is very difficult. It's a shot makers golf course," observed Thomas. 
The team has been competing in shootouts all week to determine which five golfers will compete for ND. Senior captain Paul Nolta and junior Mike O'Connell are assured spots, but the other three spots are wide open. 
''I'm looking for Todd Klem and Brennan Murphy, both freshman, to play well," com~ mented Thomas. 
The team has struggled with its short game and reaching the greens in regulation due to the lack of practice. 
"We haven't had the oppor­tunity to get much practice be­cause the weather has ex­tremely bad around here," said Thomas. 
"We want to make a good showing, so as to make an im­pression for the NCAA's," said Thomas.

A young Irish women's golf squad faces big test 
Special to The Observer 
The Notre Dame women's golf team will compete in the Indiana Univ~sity Women's Invitational at the IU Golf Complex this weekend. 
Notre Dame will take a rela­tively young squad to Bloomington. It will consist of senior captain Roberta Bryer, senior Pandora Fecko, junior Allison Wojnas, and sopho­mores Kathy Phares and Cappy Mack. 
The Invitational will provide tough competition for the Irish. The field will consist of 17 teams including some of the best teams in the Midwest re­gion. Last year, Indiana won easily and the Irish finished 14th out of a field of 15. 
"The better the opponent, the better we will become," said Coach Tom Hanlon. "You have to be hungry if you want to win and it is difficult to remain hungry if your opponent is not playing well." 
"This tournament will be tough all the way around-tough because of the long layoff since our last tournament (March 14-15) and tough because of the competition," said Hanlon.

NO's Zorich getting down to business 
SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) ­Notre Dame lineman Chris Zorich put his business class lessons to work when he per­formed for NFL scouts. 
"This was my job interview," Zorich said. "I went out of my way to say a lot of 'Yes sirs' and 'No sirs.' I put everything that I learned in my business communications classes to work. 
''I'm not applying for a con­ventional 9-to-5 job, but it's basically all the same. You clean up, you're neat and you sell yourself." 
Zorich, who won the Lombardi Award as college football's best defensive lineman, attended the NFL scouting combine held

players may need to adjust. 
Thanks to some enjoyable South Bend weather, the team has had a chance to practice outside, which could help them over the weekend. 
Said doubles-specialist Ann Bradshaw, "We played outdoors this week, but we don't know where the matches will be played. The altitude could be a problem, and I don't know if any of us have played in that condition before. The travel­ling will also be hard, but we have to be up." 
The Irish have won five straight, so they have momen­tum going into this crucial weekend. 
"With only two weeks left in the season," said Louderback, "everyone knows that we have to stay focused on tennis. It's going to be a busy end to the season. 
A potential NCAA bid hinges on the team's performance the remainder of the season. ND has wins over teams ranked or receiving votes in the top-25, including dominating victories over then 16th-ranked South Carolina and Wisconsin. However, other highly-ranked teams, such as Indiana and San Diego State, have proved to be too strong for the Irish. 
With four of the last five matches against top-25 caliber teams. the Irish need to make their stand now if they are to get into the twenty-team tour­nament field. Bids will not offi­cially be extended until late April. 
The team is playing with con­fidence, on a strong winning streak, and, said Bradshaw, "Everyone feels more seasoned right now, more conditioned as the year has progressed. Now is our chance to pull out all the stops." 

earlier in Indianapolis, but a knee injury prevented him from working out. 
He ran, jumped and per­formed a series of defensive drills on campus Wednesday. 
Scouts and managers liked what they saw. 
"Before any of us ever stepped in the building, we knew Chris was an outstanding football player and an outstanding per­son," said Carl Peterson, presi­dent and general manager of the Kansas City Chiefs. 
-we don't like to make mis­takes in the draft. We take the extra time and extra money to scrutinize the players we like." 
Peterson predicted Zorich will be taken high in the April 21 NFL draft. 
Pittsburgh Steeler scout Joe Greene, a Hall of Fame defen­sive lineman, said, "I was never scrutinized like this. If I had to place myself in Zorich's posi­tion, I'd be annoyed." 
Zorich said the pressure of staging a one-man show was tougher than performing with other prospects in Indianapolis. 
"I would have been one of a lot of athletes there," he said. "Here, everyone was looking at me and watching every step I took. If I failed out there, I won't get hired, just like any other job. It's that simple." 

BYTHEWAY,CHRIS, WHAT IS THAT ON YOUR HEAD. ANYW A YS, HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -It is Nick Faldo against the field ­and history. 
No one has ever won the Masters three times in a row. Faldo has two. No one has ever won the grand slam of golf. Faldo has dreams. 
Not since the glory days of Jack Nicklaus has one man so dominated the pre-tournament talk. 
Through it all, the tall Englishman with the elegant swing and steadiest of games remains a calm craftsman going about his business. 
"I don't think of it as a third Masters," Faldo said. ''I'm try­ing to approach it as a major, any major." 
Besides, Faldo said, he has set himself a much more difficult target than a mere third con­secutive Masters. 
"The ultimate goal," he said, "is the grand slam." 
No one has ever won the Masters, U.S. and British Opens, and the PGA in the same year. Only Nicklaus, Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan and Gary Player have won all four in a career. 
But Faldo thinks it can be done. 
"In theory, nothing is impos­sible, is it?" he asked. His eyes took on a far-away look as he mused aloud, "You must do ev­erything right. Play 16 wonder­ful rounds of golf." 
The first of those 16 rounds will be Thursday at Augusta National Golf Club when 88 of the world's finest players -69 Americans and 19 from abroad -tee off in the first of the year's four major tests. 
Only one other person has had a shot at three consecutive Masters titles. Nicklaus won in 1965 and 1966, but missed the cut the next year when he shot 72-79. In fact, only three men have won any of the four ma­jors in three successive years. And no one has done it since Peter Thompson won the British Open from 1954-56. 
It is a measure of Faldo's pre­sent stature in the game -and the level of his confidence ­that he has his sites set on more than just a third straight Masters. 
"My goal is to try to win more majors," he said. "Just keep trying. I'm anxious to see what is in store." 
Faldo made a run at it last year. He won the Masters in a playoff victory over Ray Floyd, missed making a playoff at the 
U.S. Open when a birdie putt on the last hole lipped the cup, and then won the British Open for the second time. 
Ben Hogan is the only player to have a shot at the grand slam, and he passed on the chance. Hogan won the first three -the Masters, U.S. and

...... 

British Opens -in 1953 then did not play in the PGA. Nicklaus won the first two ­the Masters and U.S. Open-in 1972. 
Faldo is approaching this Masters with a single-minded intensity reminiscent of the young Nicklaus -focusing on the majors to the exclusion of all else. 
Just as Nicklaus did, he has reduced his playing schedule and built it around the Big Four. He is giving himself every chance. 
''I've won some (majors) now. I know how to do it. I'm on a roll. I want to try to win more," said Faldo, now 33 and in the prime of his career. 
After closing his 1990 season with a victory in the Hong Kong Open in December, Faldo took a two-month break from com­petition and granted only one television and one newspaper interview. 
He spent time with his family. 
He gained about 10 pounds and says he has benefitted from an exercise program designed to combat tendonitis in his wrists and elbows. 
"I'm a lot stronger," said Faldo, now carrying about 210 pounds on a 6-foot-3 frame.

but (last week) was the first 200 Raghib has run since senior year in high school," Piane said. "Next week, he'll run ex­clusively the 100, but running the 200 now will give him the additional strength necessary to go through all the rounds at the NCAAs in the 100." 


For the Irish to come out vic­torious in Saturday's meet, however, their dominance in the field events must continue. They experienced a minor setback in that goal this week 
I \, 
when long jumper Jeff Smith (23-5 last week) ripped a hamstring muscle. 
Still, Notre Dame remains strong in the field, especially in the javelin (Ryan Mihalko and Matt DeAngelis), discus (Oscar McBride, Tony Smith, and John Smerek) and high jump (John Cole, Paul Maloney and Todd Herman)-an event the Irish swept in Houston. 
Notre Dame's strongest op­ponent this weekend will be Western Michigan. "Western Michigan is very good," Piane said. "Our major competition this weekend should come from 

( I. them." 
A major reason for his con­cern is the Broncos' capability to counter some of Notre Dame's strength in the field. 


In the javelin, Mihalko (206-1) will face a stiff challenge from freshman Brian Keane, who has thrown over 213 feet this season. And in the high jump, Cole, whose career-best is seven feet, will lead the Irish trio against another Bronco freshman, Vinton Bennett, who has cleared 6-11 this year.

Drake also competed at the Meeting of the Minds meet, fin­ishing a distant third. The Bulldogs derive most of their points in the field, led by Joel Sward (60-1/2, shot put) and Tyrone Minor (24-11 1/2, long jump; 49-1, triple jump). Their top runners are juniors Dave Cairns (1:53.9, 800), Bill Sitton (14:36.3, 5000-meters) and Craig Carver (21.75, 200).

Notre Dame baseball team is on the road again to face Mqc foe Evansville 
By JENNIFER MARTEN 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame baseball team is heading down to Evansville this weekend for an­other stop on its 29-game road trip. The Irish, 13-10, will face the Aces, 15-7-1, in a pair of Midwestern Collegiate Conference doubleheaders. 
Notre Dame coach Pat Murphy appraised the Aces. "'Evansville's a very tough team. They are one of the top teams in the conference. They have beaten great competition na­tionally and we'll have our hands full," said Murphy. 
The Irish had a 20-2 confer­ence record last year including two losses to Evansville in the MCC tournament. The Aces went on to win the tournament, but Murphy does not feel that the Aces were the best in the conference. 

"'We totally dominated the conference the last three years," said Murphy. "They weren't champions of the con­ference by any stretch of the imagination." 
On the mound for the Irish will be sophomore Alan Walania, 4-3 with a 3.76 ERA; sophomore Pat Leahy, 3-1 with a 4.13 ERA; sophomore David Sinnes, 1-1 with a 6.49 ERA; and freshman Tom Price, 2-1 with a 2.93 ERA. 
The Irish hope to dominate at the plate in the games against Evansville. Leading the attack will be senior Frank Jacobs, sophomore Eric Danapilis, and freshman Greg Layson. 
The Irish head into Evansville with a four-game losing streak, but the losses came against Stanford, UCLA, and Minnesota. Stanford has been national champions in two out of the last three years, UCLA is one of the top teams in the country, and Minnesota is probably the best team in the Midwest. 
"We played them all tough and we didn't get beat by any of them. We beat ourselves," said Murphy of the games. "The losses, that is part of baseball. The bottom line is that we are definitely one of the best teams in the country." 
Right now, the team's record stands at 13-10, but their de­manding schedule included twelve games against teams in the top 25. 
"Our win/loss record has nothing to do with how good a club it is. I know that this is the best team I've had in the four years I've been here at Notre Dame," said Murphy.

Irish lacrosse team travels to Ohio to face Denison 

By DAVE McMAHON Associate Sports Editor 
The Notre Dame lacrosse team, coming off a 15-9 loss to Villanova, hits the road Saturday to face Division III power Denison College (3-2). The Irish (3-4) have had trouble with the Big Red in the past, as Denison leads the series 8-3. 
After over 30 years of play under Coach Tommy Thomsen, Denison, ranked 12th in the Division III poll, is in its first year under the direction of Mike Karaban, who worked with Irish coach Kevin Corrigan while the two were coaching at Virginia. 
"We've had a lot of difficulty in the past beating Denison," said Corrigan. "He's going to have his team well prepared." 
The Irish, 1-3 on Denison's home turf. are still searching for a complete game perfor­mance. The squad plays well at different times, but not throughout the game. 
"We're still looking for our team to play as well as we think we can play," said Corrigan. "We need to concentrate on ex­ecuting for sixty minutes and then we'll be alright." 

The Irish offense should get an ample amount of opportuni­ties to execute, as Corrigan doesn't expect the Big Red to play a high-pressure game. 
"We'll be able to do the things we want to do without them forcing us out of our game plan," said Corrigan. "We'll need to play with patience and good judgment in order to be successful." 
Last year, Notre Dame lost 7-6 in a game that Corrigan feels his team should have won. While the Big Red sported an experienced defense last sea­son, this year's young squad should allow the Irish a few more shots on goal. 
Notre Dame has been hesitant at times on offense, looking for easy shots rather than taking what's available. 
"I don't think our shot selec­tion is bad," said Corrigan. "I think sometimes we're almost a little too selective." 
While the Irish offensive threat has been suspect at times, Corrigan believes sophomore midfielder Brian Mayglothling has what it takes to power the Irish offensive at-
Utah next stop for Irish women's tennis team 
tack. 
"Brian has shown that he's capable of playing with anybody in the country," said Corrigan. "It's time for him to step forward now and be willing to carry a little bit more of the load. He's got outstanding talent and we need him to produce for us." 
Lack of scoring has plagued the Irish at different intervals throughout the season, but the base of the problem may not have much to do with offensive techniques. 
"Most of problems have been the result of mental break­downs, so we're trying to get our attitudes ready for this game," said junior midfielder Chris Nelson. "We need to be able to look across the line and believe that we can win." 
Midfielder Brian Crowley powers the Big Red offensive attack, while third-year goalie Billy Barroll lets few shots pass him. 
"Their goalie is back again and he's an excellent player," said Corrigan. "We'll have to get the ball past him more than six times to win this game, too." .. 

Dilucia honored as men head south 

By HUGH MUNDY Sports Writer 
After an Easter break which featured defeats of Midwestern foes Minnesota and Michigan State, the Notre Dame men's tennis team sets its sights southward for two weekend matches. 
The Irish face Duke University tomorrow followed by a match against #25 West Virginia. 
Although Duke has struggled against nationally-ranked competition, Notre Dame coach Bob Bayliss anticipates a challenge. 
"Duke is a very talented team," he remarked. "They've had a number of close defeats against some outstanding squads." 
The Irish, which narrowly won last year's match with the Blue Devils, will rely on its ex­perienced singles lineup in this season's contest. 

"I think we'll benefit from our depth at singles, "Bayliss said. "We've gained strength from our difficult schedule." 
Nevertheless, the Irish coach expects to be tested. 
"Duke definitely remembers last year's loss," he commented. "Revenge will be a major factor." 
Following the Duke match, Notre Dame faces a perennial top-twenty team in West Virginia. 
The Mountaineers have been beset by injuries throughout the season but should be at full strength against the Irish. 
"They lost their number one and three singles players for a month," Bayliss said. 
"However, I expect they'll re­turn this weekend." 
Bayliss, whose squad has also experienced a rash of injuries, believes his players will be able to handle the difficult weekend road test. 
"We practiced hard this week," he said. "That tells me we're healthy and ready to go." 
Notre Dame All-American Dave DiLucia, who has suffered back spasms throughout the season, should be available to play singles in both matches. 
DiLucia received more good news earlier in the week when he was named Volvo Collegiate Player of the Month for March. 
The Irish junior grabbed most valuable athlete honors at the prestigious Blue-Gray tour­nament in Alabama to solidify his position as one of the na­tion's premier collegiate play­ers. DiLucia is currently ranked third in the Volvo Collegiate Rankings, and-all four of his defeats have been to players ranked in the top 10 this year. 
"It's a nice honor," said DiLucia. "There are a lot of

With only two weeks left in the spring season, the Notre Dame women's tennis team, riding the crest of a five-match winning streak, travels out west to face two ranked teams, with a potential NCAA tourna­ment bid waiting in the wings. 
The Irish (14-6) head out to Utah this weekend to face Brigham Young in Provo on Saturday, and then visit Salt Lake City on Sunday to take on Utah. 
The Irish are currently 23rd in the Volvo Collegiate Poll, and will be facing some stiff competition this weekend. BYU is ranked 13th in the country, and Utah is holding at the 21st position. This will be a chance for the Irish to turn some heads at the NCAA tournament selection committee. 

"For us to finish the season as high as we possibly can," said Irish coach Jay Louderback, "we have to play these types of teams. Utah is in the running for a tournament bid, and I can't see BYU not getting in, since they have had a great year. To get a bid, you have to have wins over teams that will be in it, so this is a chance for us to play teams like that." 
Notre Dame may face the handicap of the altitude out in Utah. The team does not yet know if it will be playing in­doors or outdoors, and the altitude does make a difference. Some balls will fly a little bit more and the

If the Notre Dame women's track team has butterflies in the stomachs this Saturday, it's completely understandable. Not only is this their home de­but for the '91-'92 outdoor season, it also is their inaugural campaign as a varsity sport. 
The team has no plans of starting off small, in terms of competition. The quadrangular meet features squads from St. John's, Western Michigan, and Drake University . 
"All three of these programs have established, solid pro­grams," said Coach Joe Piane. "Drake's program has been around since the beginning of women's competitions." 
Nevertheless, he does not 
simply hope his team will com­pete well. He wants them to win. 
The team is anchored by the strong middle-distance running of sophomore Lisa Gorski, and junior Diana Bradley in the 1500-meter run. Sophomore Karen Harris adds depth to the field events with her perfor­mances in the shot, discus, and javelin, and two freshman, Ashea Price and Latrice Waters, head the list of Notre Dame sprinters. 
"Price and Waters, are very solid runners, and should per­form well," commented Coach Piane. 
Action begins at 1:30 pm, at the Monogram Track and Field facilities in Moose Krause Stadium.

The Notre Dame men's track 
and field team hosts a quad­
rangular meet this Saturday at

s' the Monogram Track. The Irish will face competition from St. John's, Western Michigan, and Drake. 
This is the second meet for Notre Dame during the outdoor season. Last weekend, the Irish finished a close second to Rice at the Meeting of the Minds Invitational in Houston, Texas, a result coach Joe Piane was 

., not surprised by after the meet. 

-;, "We scored where we needed to score with the exception of one event (the 800-meter run)," Piane said. "That may have been my fault in a way, putting (Brian) Peppard in the 1500­meters and the 800. I was hop­ing he could score in the 1500 and come back and score in the 800. I guess I got a little greedy, and it cost us." 
This week, however, Peppard will run exclusively in the 800-his strongest event 
(1 :51.4 last weekend)-while two of Notre Dame's distance stars, Ryan Cahill and Mike O'Connor, will compete at 1500. 
In the sprints, freshman Willie Clark will run in the 100­and 200-meters, Clark ran ca­reer bests in Houston (10.6; 
20.92) to qualify for both the IC4A championships and the 
U.S. Junior Nationals. 

Junior Raghib Ismail will try to improve on last weekend's fourth-place finish in the 200 this weekend as well as anchor the 4x100 relay team. Although the 100 is his stronger outdoor event, Piane does not expect to use him in that capacity Saturday. 
"The 100 is his better event,
