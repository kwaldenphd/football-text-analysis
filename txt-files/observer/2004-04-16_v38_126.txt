Lt. c;rng Dnitehley, spokesman for the Distriel 1 exdse of'lice, said ollkers nntnrml the bar at approximately 12:50 a.m. al'ler n~ndving an alnrt from an underc~ovnr policeman inside. 
I>nitehlny confirmed that The Library was only one of several bars that had been targeted for a bust Friday. He said that excise heard reports from several other locations before deciding to raid The Library. 
Poliee dosed doors and asked patrons to present identification upon·exit, issuing minor in a tav­ern citations to eaeh of the 17 who were found to be underage. Some of"the patrons were also ticketed for l'alsn identification, Deitehley said. 
Three patrons were also taken to St. Joseph County Jail on charges of disorderly eonduet, resisting arrest and public intoxi­cation. One of the three, a 20­year old Notre Dame student, attempted to elude officers by hiding under the bar's refrigera­tor, said Lieutenant Marc Mersich of the South Bend Police.

Faculty hiring push shrinks classes 
By JOE TROMBELLO 
A~'isram N~ws Editor 
A hiring push that began in IIJIJ3 has translatnd into a lower faeulty-studnnt ratio ­and fnwnr large, anonymous elasses -despite sizeable increases in student enroll­nwnt over the past decade. 
Suggested in Notre Dame's 1993 strategie plan, "A Colloquy for the Year 2000," the push to bring in more full-time instructional faeulty members has allowed the University to eompensate for tlw tmrollment jump -from 7,610 undergraduate stu­dents in 1992 to 8,261 stu­dents in 2002. 
Faculty hiring has more than knpt pace, rising from 608 in the 1990-91 academic year to 760 members in the 2002-03 academic year. As a result, Notre Dame showed the biggest reduction in the country in its faculty-student ratio over the same ten-year pnriod, said viee president and assoeiate provost .John

Dorm. program. connects students and faculty 
Expanded Hall Fellows program promotes student-faculty interaction outside of classroom 
By AMANDA MICHAELS 
News Writer 
For visiting assistant pro­fessor of anthropology Kimbra Smith, interaction between the students and faeulty is an essential part of the college experience ­which would explain why, at 6 p.m., she is in Welsh Family's soeial space, sur­roundnd by girls, bowls and raw fish. 
"It's so great, just spend­ing time with students, mak­ing sushi," she said while slw gently corrects one girl's 
rice-spreading technique. 
Such a scene, whether it be sushi around a table or discussion over a pizza, is not uncommon these days in the seven dorms participat­ing in the Hall Fellows Program. Started in January by the Student Senate's Committee on Student­Faculty Interaction and sup­ported by the Office of the Provost and the Office of Student Activities, the pro­gram aims to expose stu­dents to discussion in a more relaxed setting and to develop the professors' awareness of student resi­dence life. 
"In my experience, there weren't a lot of ways to start a strong student/faculty relationship," said Lauren Williams, academic commis­sioner for Welsh Family and chair of the Committee on Student-Faculty Interaction. "A lot of professors have never even walked into a dorm, so there's a gap that needs to be bridged." 
Academic commissioners from Lyons, Dillon, Keough, O'Neill, Breen-Phillips, Cavanaugh, Howard, Keenan and Welsh Family chose from a list of approxi­
mately 50 professors who earlier in the year expressed their interest in becoming Hall Fellows. 
"Exactly what each Hall Fellow does depends on the direction that each Hall Fellow and academic com­missioner decides to do," explained Williams. "The events can center around or be off-shoots of the expert­ise of the professor or sim­ply ideas that interest both the professor and the stu­dents."

Students to help rebuild community 
By KATE GALES News Writer 

Despite the warm weather, Christmas is in the air for stu­dents, city leaders and mem­bers of the South Bend corn­munity. 
Christmas in April/Hebuil­difig Together, an annual coop­erative ef1'ort to improve a low­income neighborhood in South Bend, will take place Saturday. 
"It's a full day lof'l service where we go out and fix up people's houses," said Karsten Steinhauser, the student coor­dinator of the program. "!We dol the most interesting and oddest types of jobs to improve ... houses for people who are unable to afford it or are phys­ically unable to do it them­selves." 
According to faculty adviser Darrell Paulson, around 900 students have signed up for this year's program -down from previous years, where over 1,000 students would reserve spots. 
"We've had a little bit of a drop this year in student inter­est," Steinhauser said. "Wo'rn still trying to figure out if it's the way we publicized it ... or if it's bncause it's the same day as the MCATs." 
According to Paulsen, a number of students do not show up on the day of' the proj­ect, perhaps because of the 7 
a.m. start time. Nonetheless, he said the event becomes a community effort and is not exclusive to Notre Dame stu­dents. 
"We work with a whole com­munity in South Bend," Paulsen said. "There is a whole group -on April 3 all the skilled laborers lwentl to 26 houses in the South Bend community in one neighbor­hood that the city commission­er picked. (Saturday!, we're

The joys of spring 

Suddenly, it hits you. You're sit· ting in DeBartolo, listening to a professor drone on about the latest developments in some earth-shat­tering, life-saving technique that is probably infinite­ly more impor­Ram a tant than the Gottumukkala source of your current distrac­

Scene Editor 

You take a quick glance out the window and realize ... it's gor­geous outside! Per(ect, breezy, 67 degree weather with scattered white clouds set in a clear blue sky. The harsh winter of South Bend has finally broken and all that you love and loathe about the end of the school year is finally here. 
No matter where you walk these afternoons, Frisbees, footballs and happily frolicking students fill the various quads on campus. With a little luck, you might even be able to lean on your professor to take that discussion class outdoors (while of course insisting it's only in the best interest of holding the class' attention on such a beautiful day). 
Who would have thought that a usually tiring hour and 15-minute class could fly by with a little sun­shine and wind at your back? 
Once again, the spring semester has zoomed by and it is that time to say good-bye to the graduating seniors, who have been mentors, playful bullies and long-time friends. As hard as it is for us lowly underclassmen to concen­trate on upcoming finals and schoolwork, I could only imagine how hard it must be for our gradu­ating seniors to focus a mere month before graduation. 
Even those seniors who have been saying all semester how much they are going to enjoy leaving this wonderful town of South Bend (in perhaps more colorful language than the words I have used) and all the hassles of classes behind, will probably want to return the first chance they get next year. As they take their last few trips to the Grotto and enjoy their last month of walking on hallowed ground, these memories of friends and brothers will hopefully last much longer than their last few weeks among us. 
It seems like just th~ other day that spring semester arrived with that cold blast of harsh January weather. And now it is just a month until the end of the year. 
Three whole months of sitting around doing absolutely nothing (for the lucky few) and, even better still, only five more months until we are back on campus for the start of the new school year and, what is infinitely more important, football season. 
How anyone could concentrate at a time like this is beyond me. It takes someone much greater than me to focus at times like these.

The University's popular study­abroad programs have expanded again. with students now offered participation in a cooperative Bologna, Italy program and a year­long option in London. 
The Bologna Cooperative Study Program, administrated through Indiana University in Bloomington, will have students from the Universities of Chicago, Illinois, Minnesota. North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin-Madison and Northwestt~rn University. 
"We're sending two students next year." said Tom Bogcnschild, direc­tor of the Notre Dame's International Studies Programs.

"It's hard to tell" how many stu­dents apply, he said, "since we allow students to apply to more than one program at the same time." 
"The number of applications has definitely risen," he said. 
As the numbers increase, the application process has become more selective. 
"We look for academic potential and orientation, but it's not just sim­ply a matter of academics," Bogenschild said. "It's about aca­demic merit, academic potential, but above all, in my mind, it's moti­

The screening process is also designed to prevent students who simply are looking for a travel opportunity from being chosen. 
"It's an expensive way to travel," Bogenschild said. "If students are simply looking to travel 

around Europe or Southeast Asia, we try to screen those students or orient them in a different direction." 
According to Bogenschild, the programs are "constantly adapting." He does not, however, see any addi­tional programs opening in the immediate future.

As part of April being sexu­al assault awareness month, students from Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and Holy Cross united Thursday in a campus­sponsored Take Back the Night march and rally. 
Take Back the Night is an international event organized in local communities with the purpose of unifying women, men and children in a greater awareness of the violence that occurs against women, children and families. Students and community members who participate in or support this occasion are ready to take a stand against violence and make the night safe for everyone. 
Recent statistics point out that one in four women will be sexually assaulted during her college years. 
Groups such as Feminist Collective, Saint Mary's Campus Alliance for Rape Elimination (C.A.R.E.), Notre Dame's C.A.R.E. team and the Sex Offense Services (SOS) of South Bend, helped make the rally possible. Holy Cross College also helped sponsor the event, and this year marks the first that all three campuses joined together for this cause. 
Student body presidents 
from all three schools were in attendance. 
Saint Mary's student body vice president Sarah Catherine White said the event is aimed at all campus­es and said she hopes more people will participate in next year's night. 
"The turnout for the event is inspiring in that we are try­
ing to change not only as Saint Mary's College, but as a tri-campus community," White said. "I can only hope that this event will grow in the future." 
The march began at Holy Cross College at 
4:30 p.m., pick­
ing up Saint Mary's women at 5:30 and meeting Notre Dame students women of Saint Mary's, Notre Dame and Holy Cross, as well as one male from Holy Cross College.

Hammons also contested the choice to raid The Library over other larger downtown bars such as Heartland and the State Theatre.

Dietchley was unable to confirm how many of the 17 cited were Notre Dame or Saint Mary's students, but said campus phone­books were used by officers to identify those who received the minor in a tav­ern charge.

Bill chosen as 'The Apprentice' 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Kwame was fired. Bill is hired. 
"The Apprentice" came to its much-anticipated climax Thursday when Donald Trump chose Bill Rancic, the street-smart 32-year-old Internet entrepreneur from Chicago, to be his appren­tice for the next year. 
"Kwame, I think you have an amazing future," said Trump. "You're a brilliant guy, great education, and I have no doubt you're going to be a big success. But right now: Bill, you're hired." 
Rancic edged out fellow finalist Kwame Jackson, the laid-back 29-year-old New Yorker and Harvard MBA, for the Trump-described "dream job of a lifetime" and its $250,000 salary. 
Rancic will get to return home to Chicago to manage the construction of a hotel and residential tower as president of one of Trump's companies.

Williams plans to contin­ue the program next year, and hopes that starting in September instead of January will encourage more dorms to participate. 
Though the position is unpaid, Smith -one of Welsh Family's two Hall Fellows -considers it invaluable for both the stu­dents and the faculty. 
"One of the problems with college is that most students are stuck with people within a four-year age range. When I was in college I liked interacting with different age groups, and I really appreciated those professors who spent time outside of the class­room getting to know stu­dents," Smith said. "Now it's my turn."

Bin Laden releases new audio 
CIA officials say. voice is authentic; tape offers truce with Europe, threatens U.S. 
Associated Press 

CAIRO -A man identify­ing himself as Osama bin Laden offered a "truce" to European countries that do not attack Muslims, saying it would begin when their soldiers leave Islamic nations, according to a recording broadcast Thursday on Arab satellite networks. 
Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain quickly spurned what appeared to be an attempt to drive a wedge between Europe and America. 
The tape, which ran in full at more than seven minutes, also vowed revenge against America for the Israeli assassination of llamas founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin and denounced the United States as using the Iraq war for corporate profiteering. 
"I announce a truce with the European countries that do not attack Muslim coun­tries," the taped message said as the stations showed an old, still picture of ai­Qaida leader. 
The message said "the door to a truce is open for three months," but the time frame could be extended. "The truce will begin when the last soldier leaves our countries," the speaker said without elaborating. 
A CIA official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the agency conducted a technical analysis of the recording and concluded it is probably authentic. The official said the tape was likely recorded in the past several weeks because of its reference to Israel's killing of Yassin last month. 
The tape made clear overtures to Europeans, calling them "our neighbors north of the Mediter­ranean," and tried to drive a wedge between Europe and the United States. 
Several audio and video­tapes of al-Qaida's No. 2, Ayman al-Zawahri, have been released in recent months, but Thursday's

tape was the first purport­edly from bin Laden since September. Then, a video­tape showed bin Laden climbing down a craggy mountainside with al­Zawahri. 
Ayman Gaballah, editor of Al-Arabiya, said only that the pan-Arab television net­work received the tape from "our sources." He would not say if the tape was received at its head­
. quarters in the United Arab Emirates or in a bureau elsewhere, such as Pakistan or Afghanistan. "From the voice, it seems it is bin Laden, but we are not experts to confirm it," Gaballah said. Al-Jazeera, a Qatar-based 
satellite station, also aired the tape in full. Its chief edi­tor wasn't available for c.omment. 
Sen. Joseph Biden, senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Comm­ittee, said on NBC's 'Today" show that bin Laden was "trying to separate us from the Europeans, and Europeans from the U.S. It's an example of how oppor­tunistic he is." 
Sen. Richard Shelby, H­Ala., expressed skepticism about the offer made on the tape. 
"You cannot negotiate with terrorists, especially someone like Osama bin Laden," Shelby told "Today." 
In London, the Foreign Office ruled out any deal with al-Qaida. 
"Their attacks arc against the very idea of co-exis­tence," the Foreign Ofl1cc said. "The right response is to continue to confront ter­rorism, not give in to its demands." 
A British opposition spokesman said the pur­ported truce offered was a sign that the al-Qaida net­work is rattled. 
"It is obviously an attempt by al-Qaida or the associ­ates of al-Qaida, to try and drive a wedge between the coalition," said Michael Ancram, foreign affairs spokesman for the opposi­tion Conservative Party. 

EPA condemns air pollution levels 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -The Environmental Protection agency told oflicials in 31 states Thursday they must develop new pollution controls because the air in some of their counties, home to more than 150 million people, does not meet air quality standards. 
The EPA. acting under court order, identified all or part of 4 7 4 counties. The localities, mostly in the eastern third of the country and in California, do not meet the federal health stan­dard for smog-causing ozone. Oflicials have three years to develop plans to come into compliance. 
The new standards "are strong medicine" and "will require more actions on your part to achieve clean­er, healthier air," EPA Administrator Mike Leavitt said he told governors of the states. 
Ground-level ozone, a precursor to smog, has been found to be a serious health problems, causing respiratory illnesses. It can be especially damag­ing to the elderly, children and people with asthma. according to health advocates. 
The EPA said that the regions in noncompliance may have to impose new controls on industrial plants, restrict transportation and require 
tougher vehicle inspection programs to clean up their air. Some counties also may have to require tho use of special. cleaner-burning gasoline. 
The EPA already has said it will take actions to reduce pollution from power plants and announced Thursday, in a companion regulation, new requirements aimed at. curtailing air pollution over parks. 
"This isn't about the air getting dirti­er. The air is getting cleaner," said Leavitt. "These new rules arc about our new understanding of health threats, about our standards getting tougher and our national resolve to meet them."

Affleck-Graves said that 


some departments often experience more teaching pressure in given years than others, based on the number of faculty available and the number of students who major in a particular disci­pline. However, he added that the process usually corrects itself with time. 
"Every year there is teach­ing pressure and teaching slack in some departments, but it usually corrects itself." he said. 
He noted that a rise in the number of faculty who teach at other universities on a vis­iting basis has meant that some departments have less faculty members to work with in a given year, and he also said that departments often using adjunct professors or graduate students to "correct temporary imbalances" in teaching loads. 
While Affleck-Graves said that the University has not had to rely more heavily on adjunct or graduate student teachers in recent years, he noted that more adjuncts than graduate students are used to teach courses in com­parison with a decade ago. 
Professors in several departments that have tradi­tionally housed large lecture courses said that they have seen varying degrees of decrease in class sizes over the last decade. 
Xavier Creary, a chemistry and biochemistry professor, said that he is currently teaching a 145-person section of general chemistry that averaged around 250 stu­dents six years ago. He noted the general chemistry class size was even larger 25 years ago-around 700 students­and that increased hiring and more sections have reduced class size. 
Creary said, however, more work needs to be done. 
"There is still a need for support for these sections in the form of small tutorials and recitation sections which are not offered to all stu­dents," he said. "The total number of faculty in our department has increased by only a few over the last 20 years. This means that other areas, such as graduate courses, receive less attention than in the ideal situation."

UNEMPLOYMENT 

New jobless claims hit 360,000 
Claims for unemployment benefits reach highest mark since December 2002 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -New claims for unemployment benefits increased last week by 30,000. the biggest jump in 16 months. Still, analysts said Thursday they believe the labor market has turned a corner, pointing the way to a sus­tainable economic recov­ery. 
The Labor Department reported that there were 360,000 newly unem­ployed workers filing for jobless benefits last week. Only a week earlier, the number was 330.000, the lowest in more than three years. 
The increase was far above the 7,000 rise in nnw claims that analysts had expected. It was the largest one-week ,gain since December 2002. when the country was struggling to rebound from the 2001 recession. 
Analysts pointed to a number of factors that skewed last week's num­ber. For one, it was the first week in a new quar­ter, a time when claims often temporarily surge. 
The four-week moving average for claims, which smooths out some of the volatility, rose a smaller 6,750 to stand at 344,250, still below 350,000 -a level generally seen as raising, interest rates turning point in the econ­mortgag1~ refinancing denoting an improving job sooner than expected.

Boston University to overhaul board 
Associated Press 
BOSTON Boston University's trustees voted Thursday to overhaul the board in a move likely to weaken for­mer President John Silber's iron grip on the school he headed for most of the past three decades. 
The overhaul includes term limits that would eventually remove many of Silber's long­time allies, some of whom have served for decades. 
Also, the board adopted a new conflict-of-interest policy in response to criticism of BU's payment of $30 million last year to companies and nonprofit organizations in which universi­ty trustees were involved. 
The board also named Alan Leventhal as chairman of the board. He replaces Christopher Barreca, who is stepping down for health reasons. 
"We are at an exciting junc­ture in Boston University's his­tory and I hope to work with my colleagues to continue to build upon our success as a world class university," said Leventhal, calling the board­approved changes a "mile­stone." 
The move follows last year's messy collapse of the school's presidential search, when the trustees hired former NASA chief Daniel S. Goldin as presi­dent, only to back out at the last moment amid rumors of a power struggle between Silber loyalists and Goldin. 
Trustees said the deal with Goldin broke down after he questioned· the financial rela­tionships some trustees had with the university, and sug­gested they amounted to con­flicts of interest. 
After the embarrassing spec­tacle, the trustees -who have long been criticized for their tight ties to Silber -formed a committee to review the board's operations and propose changes. The full board took up the panel's recommendations on Thursday. 
Silber, a hard-charging and often abrasive figure, served as president from 1971 to 1996 before becoming chancellor. He was widely cr.edited with help­ing transform BU from a sec­ond-tier regional university into the nation's fourth-largest pri­vate university. He stepped down as chancellor and a mem­ber of the board when the Goldin deal fell through. 
One expert said the changes by the board would reassure candidates who might other­wise be wary of taking the pres­ident's job. 
"This clears the way for the selection of a new president who will have limited to no con­cerns about the problems of yesteryear," said Sheldon Steinbach, general counsel for the American Council on Education.· 
Rita Bornstein, president of Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla., and author of the book "Legitimacy in the Academic Presidency: From Entrance to Exit," said: "I think what they're doing is excellent. They're cleaning up their act. They're telling the world they're going to play by com­monly accepted rules and they're going to be more than ethical in everything they do and that will help them attract a great president." 
'Divas' show to highlight Si111pson 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Even the folks at VHl admit they didn't really consider Jessica Simpson diva material when they put togeth­er their annual "Divas" extrav­aganza last year. 
"At that point, she was geared a little toward a teen audience," Rick Krim, a VHl executive vice president, said delicately. More bluntly, Simpson was widely regarded as a C-list Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera with dimin­ishing record sales and ques­tionable star power. 
One year later, Simpson's once dull star has not only brightened -it has exploded, ever since she and hubby Nick Lachey turned their marriage over to MTV for the hugely suc­cessful series "Newlyweds: Nick & Jessica." 
Simpson's latest album, "In This Skin," a dud when it was first released last summer. is now platinum and still climb­ing. The couple's April 11 TV special, "The Nick & Jessica Variety Hour," was so success­ful that ABC ordered another for Christmas.

'The best part about life right now is watching prayers being answered. That's so amazing," Simpson, 23, told The Associated Press in an inter­view. 
And she finally ranks as a diva -in VHl 's eyes, anyway. She's one of the headliners at Sunday's live broadcast from Las Vegas. 
''I've always watched 'Divas,' and I knew I could hang with them. I knew I could do it.

That "other side" happened to be her ditzy side. She's been widely lampooned for her bub­ble-head antics on the "Newlyweds" (like eschewing Buffalo wings because "I don't eat buffalo"). But she's not only accepted her doofus status, she's reveled in it. 
"I think that's what makes it funny, and that's what makes it endearing, is that I'm accepting of the fact that I know I don't think before I talk, and I have my ditzy moments. It's just who I am,'' Simpson said. 
For those who ask, "How can she be that dumb?" the answer is, she's not. She's just acting her hair color.

Simpson, who is quick to rave about her husband during a conversation ("Nick has a great sense of humor,'' she gushes). is also quick to shoot down rumors of jealousy. 
"I think in general, focus is always more on women because there's always a story in an outfit or in a purse,'' she said. "From 'Newlyweds,' peo­ple have seen what an amazing man of character Nick is, and I think most of the viewers would want to be married to him if! wasn't." 
Of course, if she wasn't mar­ried to Lachey, she might not have such amazing success ­she even jokes it was the best move of her career.

Families protest extensions 
National Guard unit's tour extended shortly after soldier's death 
Associated Press 
WAUSAU, Wis.-After wait­ing a year for their loved ones to come home, relatives of a Wisconsin National Guard unit received a double shock in the past week: One-of its soldiers was killed in Iraq, and the rest had their tour of duty extended four months. 
Some families of soldiers in the Guard's 32nd Military Police Company are responding with an Internet campaign to urge J>residcnt Bush and members of Congress to intervene to bring back the company's 160 sol­diers, who had been scheduled to return from Iraq by early next month. 
"We are not anti-war," said Linda Aber, whose 22-year-old daughter. Kelli. is in the unit. "We feel it is unfair at this point. Mentally, we feel they arc spent. ... We're trying to put some prcssun~ on politicians to help." 
1\bnr, 44, of Madison, helped create the Web site, which includes elected officials' phone numbers. 
The office of Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., said he had received about 100 calls and 120 e-mails by Thursday regarding the Guard unit's extension. 
In a statement, Feingold said he wrote Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld about the fam­ilies' concerns and urged him to do "all he can to increase the predictability of deployments." 
The lack of predictable deployments has been a prob­lem since the start of the war and "can have a corrosive effect on morale," Feingold wrote. 
The Pentagon said Thursday it is extending by three months the tours of about 20,000 U.S. troops in Iraq, giving command­ers extra frrepower to confront an insurgency that is taking a mounting toll. About one-quar­ter of the troops are members of the National Guard or Heserve. 
The decision breaks a promise to soldiers who were assured when they arrived in Iraq that they would stay no more than a year. By extending their tours of duty by three months, the Pentagon is acknowledging the insurgency has ruined its plans to reduce the size of the U.S. military presence this spring. 
The news about the 32nd Police Company's extended tour of duty came as it mourned the death of Spc. Michelle Witmer, 20, who was killed April 9 when her Ilumvee came under attack in Baghdad. She was the first Wisconsin National Guard sol­dier to die in military combat since World War II and the first woman Guard member ever killed in combat. 
TWo of her sisters also served in Iraq, one in the same Guard unit and the other as a medic in another unit. They returned home on leave and haven't decided whether they will return to Iraq.

These findings are among those (')f investigators for the commission -investigating the Sept. 11 attacks, which has harshly criticized the intelli­gence-gathering efforts of the CIA and FBI. 
FBI and Justice Department officials said Thursday they are working to address all three issues, which limit the government's ability to gather the kind of intelligence needed to head off another cata­strophic terrorist attack. 
The warrants, authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, allow for wiretaps, video surveillance, property searches and other spying on people believed to be terrorists or spies. After the 2001 Patriot Act and a key 2002 court decision crumbled the legal wall separating the FBI's criminal and intelligence investigations, use of FISA warrants has soared as shar­ing of information has become easier. 
Since 2001, the number of warrants has risen from 934 to more than 1,700 in 2003, according to the FBI. The FBI adopted streamlined proce­dures to move the warrant requests quickly from the field offices to headquarters after Sept. 11. 
But a Sept. 11 commission report released this week found that the Justice Department approval process "continues to be long and

slow" and that the mounting 
requests "are overwhelming 
the ability of the system to 
process them." Although there 
are provisions for the attorney 
general to issue emergency 
FISA warrants, these are good 
for only 72 hours before they 
must be reviewed by a special 
court. 

The department and FBI are 
"attempting to address bottle­
necks" in the system, the com­
mission report found, but the 
difficulties suggest that some 
surveillance opportunities 
could be delayed or lost. 

Attorney General John 
Ashcroft is issuing new guide­
lines for the Justice 
Department's Office of 
Intelligence Policy and Heview, 
which handles FISA requests, 
spokesman Mark Corallo said. 
The changes are aimed at 
reducing and preventing back­
logs, he said. 

"We have been in a constant 
state of revising and stream­
lining the FISA process," 
Corallo said. More lawyers are 
being added to the unit so the 
warrant requests are more 
quickly reviewed and sent to 
the court for approval. 

The inability to gather enough evidence for a FIS/\ warrant caused the FBI prob­lems in the case of Zacarias Moussaoui, the only person charged in connection with the Sept. 11 attacks. He was taken into custody on immigration charges in August 2001 after his desire to learn to fly a Boeing 747 with little flight background aroused suspi­cions. 
The FBI turned to the CIA to help produce evidence needed to show that Moussaoui might be connected to a foreign ter­rorist group, which would enable agents to get a FISA warrant to search Moussaoui's computer. That led to an Aug. 23-24 briefing memo to CIA Director George Tenet head­lined "Islamic Extremist Learns to Fly," but nothing was done before the 19 hijack­ers completed the Sept. 11 plot that took nearly 3,000 lives. 
The commission said it is possible that if the government had acted more quickly on the inform a ti<fn involvi n g Moussaoui it could have led authorities to the hijackers. 
Some lawmakers and priva­cy activists worry that FISA remains ripe for abuse. Legislation introduced on Capitol I I ill would require the Justice Department to publicly account for the number of Americans subjected to FISA surveillance and how often it is used in criminal cases. 
"What it will do is go a long way toward assuaging grow­ing public mistrust of the gov­ernment," said Timothy Edgar, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union. 
Even if the FISA delays are solved, the FBI is struggling to provide the surveillance experts necessary to carry out the warrants. 
The commission staff found shortages at every FBI field office they visited and noted that some of these personnel "are not treated as part of an integrated intelligence pro­gram" and do not meet regu­larly with case agents working terrorism suspects.

PSA needs to reconsider tactics 
Sustained civil disobedience poses two challenges for demon­strators to consider -not only how long to wait before taking a daring public stance, but how best to approach the audience their bold step will address. 
Members of the Progressive Student Alliance decided Wednesday that they had waited long enough for Notre Dame to make an official statement against renewing its contract with Taco Bell. After delivering letters to the office of University President Father Edward Malloy for the past two weeks, the students opted to further publicize their three-day hunger strike by making their presence felt in the Office of the President. OJhe 
While such initiative is admirable at Notre userver Dame -a campus traditionally rife with student  meetings in advance -an option the group did apathy -the PSA's choice of a confrontational not pursue -the PSA must realize that sponta-
Editon 
approach may have soured a productive, if slow­moving, dialogue with the administration. 
Students from the group have met since last fall with vice president and general counsel Carol Kaesebier to air their con­cerns. Kaesebier's office has been open both to ongoing discus­sion and to seeking Taco Bell's response, and should be praised for its performance in a mediating role between the students, the corporation and the administration -stressing fairness to all sides at every step in the process. 
The letter Kaesebier sent to Taco Bell March 5 and the fol­low-up call placed Wednesday exemplify a willingness to address the students' concerns. By delegating responsibility to the general counsel. the University provided an avenue for the PSA to seek answers from Taco Bell that specifically speak to its relationship with Notre Dame. The University's responsibili­ty to hear its sponsor's side and its responsibility to assist alarmed students have both been fulfilled. 
The PSA, however, questions Notre Dame's responsibility to be persistent. The University's cooperative assistance clearly is not as outspoken as the students' relentless efforts in the name of their cause. 
But passion, the PSA learned Wednesday, is not always pro­ductive. 
Arriving unannounced at Malloy's office was within their 
rights. Students who want to approach the presi­
dent should be able to do so. Yet out of respect al for his position and for his protocol of scheduling 
neously approaching Malloy will be ineffective. 
A statement from the administration will only come when they have heard from Taco Bell and evaluated the corporation's claims. Kaesebier. Counselor to the President Father Peter Jarret and others have made that clear. And while acts of civil disobedience like sit-ins and hunger strikes have proven historically successful in other contexts, with the Notre Dame administration they carry less weight than the more professional exchange the students had with Kaesebier. 
Though patience may be frustrating. continuing on the course begun with the general counsel is the wisest choice for the students. · 
Justice too long delayed is justice denied, says the PSA rally­ing cry. But justice forced may disrupt justice forthcoming. 
LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

Pass in Revie-w location not acceptable 
April 14 was a beautiful day to be outside. A warm breeze and clear skies marked the day of the annual Presidential Pass in Review Ceremony. That afternoon, I had to make my way through the maze of construction fences to find the Loftus Center where the ceremony was to take place indoors. · Earlier this year, my Senate committee recognized the stu­dent demand for an outdoor location for the ceremony. We col­lected 2,082 signatures in only one week. petitioning for its relocation. Student Activities denied the request and cited rea­sons such as convenience and previous low-student atten­dance. In response. my committee took the project further to create greater awareness of the ceremony among the student body. We made posters, flyers and table tents. With greater campus discussion, students realized their uniformed peers were leaving the Notre Dame bubble for active duty. When our country is in a time of war, it is important to realize many of the soldiers and sailors who fight toduy were only marching in Loftus last year. . 
I worked to move the ceremony outdoors because ROTC cadets and midshipmen want the ceremony outdoors. As we continued the project, I learned that many non-ROTC students want an outdoor ceremony equally, such as myself. We simply want a flagpole, real grass and the possibility of an aircraft fly­over. Contrary to popular rumor, the original relocation four years ago was neither in response to anti-ROTC protestors nor as a way of hiding the ROTC program. University President Father Edward Malloy spoke of the pride Notre Dame feels

towards the ROTC program at Wednesday's ceremony. While the past four years in Loftus may have been for the planner's convenience, this year the ROTC department wanted an out­door location. The Student Activities department felt that an outdoor venue was not necessary and Loftus was fully ade­quate. They were mistaken. 
The ceremony attendance on Wednesday was the greatest in the past four years inside Loftus. Captain Shelton of the Navy Department told me the crowd size was four times larger than last year's. While the 2,082 petitioners did not all join me, I feel the large audience demonstrated the Notre Dame commu­nity's committed support for the cadets and midshipmen who marched before us. The crowd certainly fit inside Loftus, but the fieldhouse was not adequate for the ceremony. The Pass in Review deserves an outdoor location, to honor all those who attended, including active duty officers and veterans. I hope the ceremony will remain on people's minds and that next year the student body will once again encourage Student Activities to reconsider the ceremony's location. On a personal note. I want to thank the ROTC department and students for their continued assistance in the project. It has been an honor. Thank you.

Diversity has its limits 
"Diversity" has been a buzzword at Notre Dame for the past few years. Diversity is lauded in terms of race, gender. socio-eco­nomic class and countless other classifica­tions. Sadly, there is one place at Notre Dame where diversity is slowly being elim­
John lnfranca

inated: diversity of thought. In 
particular. eco­nomic thought. Dissident 
This past year Poetry the College of Arts and Letters decided to split Notre Dame's Department of Economics in two: a Department of Economics and Econometrics and a Department of Economics and Policy Studies. Notre Dame's Economics department had long been one of the few departments in the nation committed to cultivating a variety of approaches to the study of economics. This includes scholarship and tnaching oul'iide of the mainstream or nco-classical approach. So-callrd heterodox economics often does not receive the same attention garnered by main­stream approaches. It does, however, fre­quently focus on broader issues of social con­cern: labor standards, income distribution, environmental quality, fair trade and poverty. Such approaches often resonate with Catholic social teaching on economics which, in the words of the U.S. Bishop's Pastoral Letter Economic Justice for All, "does not embrace 50 economics journal, and hence Jensen 
questioned their impact. The same logic 
might be used to argue that opinions which 
are not popular and already accepted are 
simply not worth expressing. So much for 
positive social change. 

Perhaps more ironic is the perspective 
ofTered by Mark Roche, the dean of the 
College of Arts and Letters. According to the 
National Catholic Reporter, Roche described 
the professors chosen for the Econometrics 
Department as "those persons who are 
actively contributing to mainstream econom­
ics." Roche said that they alone will be able to 
hire new faculty members "because ifyou 
have persons who aren't conversant with the . mainstream or people who arc opposed to 
the mainstream, you're not going to get the 
hires you need to advance the department in 
mainstream economics." 

This commitment to mainstream thought 
contrasts with Roche's thoughts in his recent 
booklet "The Intellectual Appeal of 
Catholicism and the Idea of a Catholic 
University." There he spoke admiringly of 
"The Catholic tradition, inspired by the con­
cept of the unity of knowledge." This commit­
ment to "the lost ideal of holistic knowledge 
provides, precisely in its foreignness, a valu­
able antidote to some of the weaknesses of 
the modern age and of the contemporary 
University. Not only does familiarity with a 
contrasting ideal ofTer the formal advantage 
of fostering critical distance toward the 
any particular theory of how the 
reigning ideals of one's own era, in economy works." this case the holistic model pres-· 
In contrast, the Economics and Econometrics Department is committed solely to neo­classical theory. It also focuses on a particular method of studying the economy known as econometrics. Econometrics empha­sizes the use of mathe­matics and statistical research to f(m~cast economic trends and make policy deci­sions. Unfortunately, not all of the econo­my's effects on indi­viduals can be meas­ured quantitatively. 1\s Economic Justice for All observes: "Our faith calls us to meas­ure this economy, not by what it produces but also by how it touches human life and whether it protects or undermines thn dignity of the human per­son." Econometrics docs not ofTcr a formula for measuring concern for human dignity. Like any single approach it has its limita­tions. 
The decision to split the Economics depart­ment has led many to worry that heterodox economic thought will eventually be eliminat­ed at Notre Dame. The new Economics and Econometrics Department is allowed to hire new faculty, while the Economics and Policy Studies Department is not. In addition, the graduate program will, when it is restarted, be located in and controlled by the smaller Econometrics Department. 
The National Catholic Hcporter's most rnccnt issue reporl<> on the split. The article was based in part on an interview with the Econometrics Department's chairperson, Hichard Jensen. Jensen stressed that the decision to split the department was due to a need to raL<>e the program's ranking, which is defined solely in terms of the number of arti­cles faculty members publish in leading peer­reviewed publications, most of which focus on neo-classical approaches. Hence conform­ity to this accepted paradigm of how econom­ic$ should be done trumped any desire to question the merits of this approach to judg­ing the quality of a program, or, for that mat­ter, any desire to critically evaluate the sup­positions of neo-classical economics. Most heterodox publications do not rank in the top 
ents us with a substantive alter­native, an ideal toward ~ich a Catholic University is obliged to strive." It appears that such "criti­cal distance form the reigning ideals" and the desire to ofTer a "sub­
stantive alternative" is useful only in so far as it does not afTect aca­
demic rankings, rankings determined by conformity to those very "reigning ideals." The distinct­ness of Catholic iden­tity is wonderful when it serves to 
attract students and faculty but should Catholicism's commit­ment to social and eco­nomic justice compel questions with regard to the assumptions of neo­classical economics tradi­
tion no longer serves its pur­pose. This is not to say that Notre 
Dame should not teach neo-classi­cal economics or econometrics; an 
understanding of both is crucial for anyone who hopes to engage in reflection and debate on economic matters. The decision, however, to focus on neo-classical approaches and eliminate graduate studies in heterodox eco­nomics, largely due to a desire to improve an academic ranking determined by allegiance to a single theoretical approach, is troubling. It was troubling enough to compel Robert Solow, a neo-classical economist and the 1987 Nobel Prize winner, to write a letter to University President Father Edward Malloy encouraging him to rethink the split. Solow declared the decision "a cruelly bad idea" and remarked that "Economics, like any dis­cipline, ought to welcome unorthodox ideas, and deal with them intellectually as best it can." Unfortunately Solow's opinions do not afTcct academic rankings. Until that changes, neither his opinions, nor those of heterodox economists, will receive much attention here at Notre Dame. Diversity has its limits.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 


Bake sales promote , political activism 
I am a class of 2001 alumnus, writing from Washington, D.C., where I have con­sciously avoided the political scene (happy hours and marches) for two years. During the past week, however, I have found the following headlines and e-maiL<> too disturbing to ignore or delete. 
For example, in the city's metro there are ads saying, "lie knew. Congress must censure the President," with further information on how the country has been misinformed with distorted intelligence. In an e-mail I received from MoveOn.org, an organization dedicated to bringing ordinary people back into politics through online activism networking, I read the following: 
"President Bush presents himself as a man of the people, but a look at his fundraising shows otherwise. Over $95 million of his money has come in the form of bundles of $2000 checks from high-rolling CEOs and lobbyists." 
As someone who has felt powerless and struggled to even vote through absentee ballots over the years, I am urging you to consider taking baby steps toward action. Initially I was convinced our main recourse would be saying novenas at the grotto. Fortunately, the grassroots organization I mentioned above has suggested a thoughtful and empowering alternative, a bake sale. A "Bake Sale for Democracy" to raise money for Move On's campaign to "Take Back the White House." 
This weekend over 1,000 bake sales will be held across the country on April 17. Saddened by the fact that none of these were taking place in South Bend, a friend and I registered to hold our own -our original plan was to be in town for a reunion. If after reading information on www.moveon.org you feel motivated, or if you feel like this country is in need of a change, please consider bringing items to Field House Mall (Stonehenge) at 11 a.m. on Saturday, or simply supporting the sale between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. At the very least, I would urge you to make an efTort to vote this fall. Personally, I have decided that prayer and thought are not enough: the time has come to take an active role in making a difference.

SHAWN A MONSON 


By MARIA SMITH Scene Editor 

The chance to perform Shakespeare is one of the greatest challenges, and the greatest joys, of professional and amateur actors alike. 
The language may be antiquat­ed, the lines may be complicated and the characters may take weeks to understand. But actors and directors with the passion and talent to get past these difficulties can find a world of possibilities in every one of Shakespeare's plays. 
Through the years the Not So Royal Shakespeare Company has taken a crack at the comedies, tragedies and histories with equal vigor and varying amounts of suc­cess. Last year the group took the stage with Taming of the Shrew and Hamlet. Fall semester featured many of the group's best old and new actors in the always popular Much Ado About Nothing. 

This weekend the com­pany will take on a greater challenge in its performance of King Lear. In addition to being widely acknowledged as one of Shakespeare's greatest tragedies, the story of King Lear's descent from his throne into gradually increasing mad­ness at the hands of his treacher­ous daughters is one of the most difficult to perform. The dark themes of the play and complicat­ed development of the characters place great demands on the actors. While the company's pres­entation of the play is not flaw­less, the cast of King Lear puts on an admirable performance. 
Hamlet may be the role every actor aspires to play, but in many ways King Lear may be a more difficult role to perform. Senior Mike Federico's performance in this show makes it clear why the computer science major has been cast in major roles in the compa­ny since he came to Notre Dame. In the past four years Federico has played Mercutio, Hoderigo, Falstaff and other coveted Shakespearean characters on the Notre Dame stage. 
"This role is, first, impossible," Federico said. "To have enough breath to say all the lines and scream them the way he does is really impossible." 
Federico certainly has a tough act to follow playing a role that has been filled with great actors such as Laurence Olivier and Orson Welles. 
"Most actors play this part when they are at least 60 years plus and have their careers behind them," Federico said. "But that's the beauty of college theatre." 
Senior Mario Bird also brings a personal slant to his role as the Earl of Kent with a carefully culti­vated 
Scottish a c c e n t drawn from a variety of popular entertainment. 

"[The accent] comes from an amalgamation of a number of dif­ferent sources," Bird said. 
The attempt may sound like a gimmick, but is surprisingly effec­tive in developing the character and bring­ing out Bird's nat-"King ural acting 
energy. 
The play also fea­t u r e s notable perform­ances by some of the University's younger actors. Freshman 


C o n o r w 0 0 d s plays the minor character of Oswald with distinctive character, and sophomore David Tull adapts well to the challenge of playing a character who masquerades as a madman for half the play.

"It's b e e n draining," Tull said. "But it's been so rnwarding to go back !l.nd forth and try a couple differ­
j ent dlltractors." 
Junior Lfma Caligiuri, east in a double role, is good as Lear's youngnst daughter Cordelia. She is more striking as the Fool who accompa­nies Lear lear" on the later parts

east tho samn actor for both rolns in an dfort to contribute to thn portrayal of Lear's psychologieal dnvnlopmnnt. 
"I wantnd to find a way to nxprnss Lnar's madness," KnrtPz 
said. "With the face of Cordelia 
the character of the Fool is a lot 
more powerful." 
One problem actors often 
encounter in performing 
Shakespeare is the tendency to 
get lost in the language. At times 
the actors or the company also 
run into diff1culty interpreting the 
subtleties of Shakespeare. While 
the plot and the characters are 
well developed and several of 
the actors live up to the chal­
lenge of performing 
Shakespeare as though he 
wrote for modern audi­
ences. some of the finer 
points of language and 
conversation get lost in 
the company's perform­
ance. 
The company also 
uses a mix of props and 
costumes from differ­
ent time periods, 
which may be done for 
efffJCt, but can feel dis­
jointed. The mix of 
swords, guns, fur 
capes and strapless 
dresses may be a func­
tion of the company's 
limited budget, but 
does not add to tho 
sense of reality on the 
stage. 
This weekend's per­formance will be the last time many of the most active performers or the senior elass will take the stage as Notre Dame under­graduates. Federico, Kertez, Adel llanash and Spencer Beggs have been part of the Notre Dame dramatic scene for four years. Bird only began acting onstage at Notre Dame last semestnr, but has rapidly become an important part of the company. 
"A lot of people who have been a huge part of NSR in the past are going to be gone," Tull ·said. "But a lot of what's fun about this show is leaving spots open for people to come in and fill the ranks. You can see the people getting ready to fill the seniors' spots." 
Even for those seniors not i,ntending to pursue a career in acting, the end of the Not So Hoyal Shakespeare Company does not mean the end of performing Shakespeare. Several of the actors including llanash, Tull and Kertez will perform in the Summer Shakespeare perform­ance of Homeo and Juliet this summer. Federico was east in the role of Paris. and graduate Jeff Eyerman, appearing as the Earl of Gloucester in King Lear, works as executive director of the Summer Shakespeare program. 
"I think that Shakespeare's every single word feels so special, so magical to perform," Tull said. "They say there's the acting bug, but there's also the Shakespeare bug. Once you get addieted to per­forming these works, which you do, you get hooked on it."

Red Sox, Yankees renew their rivalry today 

Associated Pn:ss 
BOSTON -Thought base­ball's best rivalry couldn't get more intense? Think again. 
The Bed Sox and Yankees resume their feud Friday, sure to remember the nastiness and drama of last year's AL champi­onship series and the sniping over Alex Rodriguez in the off­season. 
Of course, Boston and New York didn't need more reasons to hate each other in a battle that began even before the Red Sox traded Babe Huth to the Yankees in 1920. 
Well, they got 'em, anyway. 
"It's the greatest rivalry in sports," Boston's Kevin Millar said. "With the whole A-Rod thing, it's going to be unbeliev­able. It's an exciting time. You've got two bulldog teams going at each other." 
The Red Sox and Yankees 
insist their focus will be on try­ing to win, not the bad blood between them. Still, the fans at Fenway, some of whom will be in new seats on the right-field roof, will make it clear this is no ordinary four-game series. 
''I'm not expecting too many cheers," said Rodriguez, who

N-otre Dame Athletics 
donned pinstripes rather than red socks when the Yankees obtained him from Texas after Boston failed to get him. 
The series begins exactly six months after their last dramatic meeting -a Yankees victory in Game 7 of the AL championship series. Pedro Martinez blew a three-run lead in the eighth inning at Yankee Stadium and Aaron Boone gave New York a 6-5 win with a homer in the 11th inning off Tim Wakefield. 
Boston was five outs from clinching the series when man­ager Grady Little made a much­criticized decision to stick with Martinez. It backfired, and Little lost his job to Terry Francona. 
Wakefield will be back on the mound, throwing the first pitch of Friday's game. Martinez will twt pitch in the series. 
Boone is probably out for the season, sidelined with a knee injury that created an opening at third base. The Yankees filled that with Bodrigucz, considered baseball's best all-around play­cr. 
New York has won 26 World Series since Boston won its last in 1918. 
As if to give the team an addi­tional boost before the game, Boston will unveil a statue of the most beloved Bed Sox of all, Ted Williams. 
"llopefully, we can pick it up a notch, show them who the best team is," Boston's Johnny Damon said.""l'm convinced we are." 
Both teams added key play­ers. The Red Sox got Curt Schilling and Keith Foulke. Besides Hodriguez, the Yankees picked up Gary Shellield, Kevin Brown and Javier Vazquez, who pitches the opener. 
With Seattle and Texas, Rodriguez never had the chance to play in such a rivalry. 
"He's asked questions," Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter said, "but you can only say so much. You can only explain so much. Until you experience it firsthand, you have no idea." 
The signing of Hodriguez prompted Hed Sox owner John Henry to call for a salary cap. Yankees owner George Steinbrenner lired back, calling llcnry a whiner. 
The teams have baseball's highest payrolls, the Yankees at $183 million and the Bed Sox at $125 million. 
Seven of this year's 19 regu­lar-season meetings are in April with Boston's No mar Garciaparra and Trot Nixon on the disabled list. Against the Hcd Sox last year, the Yankees were 10-9 in the regular sea­son.

Associated Press 
NEW YORK -As a boy, Bud Selig went to Wrigley Field to watch a rookie named Jackie Robinson. More than a half-century later, the memory still sticks with the commis­sioner. 
"We were the only white people in the upper deck," Selig said. "I never saw so much excitement." 
At ballparks all across the majors Thursday, fans and players got to see and hear about the Hall of Farner's legacy. Baseball paused for Jackie Robinson Day, with video tributes, speeches and commemorative No. 42 signs honoring the man who broke the sport's color barrier. 
"When you look back on the history of our game, Jackie Robinson coming into baseball -there's no question in my mind that April 15, 1947, was the most powerful moment in baseball history," Selig said at Shea Stadium. 
."It transcended baseball. It was a precursor to the civil rights movement by 15 or 16 years," he said. 
Robinson's widow, Rachel, was escorted onto the field by Selig and New York Mets center fielder Mike Cameron before the game against Atlanta. 
Rachel Robinson spoke to a sparse crowd and her daughter, Sharon, took part in a first-pitch cere­mony. 
Rachel recalled those early days after Robinson started his career with the Brooklyn Dodgers. 
"After the first few games, when black fans started to come to the games and rooted so hard and came up to him, he began to get the feeling of what his playing meant to people," she said. 
"Sharon and I know that a younger generation are beginning to discover Jackie Robinson. We're proud of all the progress," she said. "I also know in a very intense and passion­ate way that there's a lot that still needs to be done in baseball and in life." 
Starting this year, every April 15 will be celebrated as Jackie Robinson Day in the majors. 
His No. 42 was retired throughout baseball in 1997 when the sport paid tribute to the 50th anniver­sary of the day he debuted for Brooklyn. 
Players who wore No. 42 at the time were allowed to keep it. Mariano Rivera of the New York Yankees and injured Mo Vaughn of the Mets still have it. 
IN BRIEF 
Haas continues comeback 
HOUSTON -German Tommy Haas took another step in his comeback from shoulder surgery with a 6-4, 6-2 victory Thursday over Paul Goldstein in a second-round match at the U.S. Men's Clay Court championships. 
"The more you play, the more you get comfortable," Haas said. "I felt pretty comfortable in the second set, stepping it up with my strokes. But there's still always improvement to make." 
Haas, who missed all of last season and hasn't played on clay since the 2002 French Open, broke Goldstein in the 1Oth game of the first set. Haas ran away with the second set with breaks in the second and eighth games. 
"Obviously, I'm trying to do the best I can each week," Haas said. "Maybe to say winning a tournament right now would be a little much. I'm still trying to test my way back into the matches. You never know what can happen." 
Williams return cut short 
CHARLESTON, S.C. -Serena Williams' comeback was cut short. 
The six-time major champion with­drew from the Family Circle Cup on Thursday, saying her left knee is sore from practicing and playing too much after returning from an eight-month absence. 
The announcement comes a day after Williams pulled out of the U.S. Fed Cup team's first-round match at Slovenia and raises questions about Williams' fitness with the French Open less than six weeks away. 
She had knee surgery Aug. 1, then missed the U.S. Open and Australian Open, returning to the tour just last month. 
"The official diagnosis by the doctor was that he was shocked I was play­ing this many tournaments in the beginning," Williams said. 
"He said normally when you're coming back from a procedure like me, you should play one week and then maybe take a week or two weeks off."

The Buckeyes finally broke the 10-goal unanswered scoring streak with eight seconds remain-effort as the Irish netted three of the next four goals to start the second half. bumping their lead to 13-2 and effectively icing the game. 
While the showdown in the nation's capital is easily the biggest of the year for the Irish, Coyne and the Irish aren't fazed by the significance of the contest and plan to stick with the game plan that has facilitated Notre Dame in jumping 15 spots in the rivalry; it has all the ingredients you're looking for in a big game atmosphere," Coyne said. "But I don't feel any extra pressure, and we're approaching this game like we have every other game. 
"We've stayed very focused. and we're looking forward to the opportunity to go out and play a really good opponent."

Both coaches agreed to go to the international tiebreaker, in which the last out of the previous inning is put on second base to start the inning. In the top half of the inning, the Flames sacrificed Jessica Reusnow to third base, and then she was driven in by Alycia Creese's single through the right side. Creese also picked up the win for the Flames. 
The Irish had their chances in the bottom half of the inning, but they failed to sacrifice Carissa Jacquish over to third, and then Stephanie Brown popped out. With two outs, deFau hit a hot grounder to the shortstop, who bobbled the ball, and Gumpf waved Jacquish home. She was called out to end the game, good for the Flames' first win ever at Ivy Field.

Irish journey to 46th annual Mt. SAC relays 
By MIKE GILLOON 
Spons Writer 
It's been said that tough compe­tition brings out the best in an athlete. The Irish hope this old adage holds true this weekend as seventeen Notre Dame competi­tors will travel to the 46th annual Mt. SAC relays in Walnut, Calif. The relays. held at Mt. San Antonio College, attract a first­class field of runners, jumpers and throwers. 
The athletes hail from colleges all around the country including powerhouses Arkansas, Oregon, Arizona and USC. There will also be international entrants on national teams from countries such a<; Canada, Kenya. Australia and Great Britain. 
"This is known as one of the best meets in the country," said Irish assistant coach Tim Connelly. "It will attract a lot of post-collegiate runners and many contenders for the Olympics." 
Among the group Notre Dame will bn sending are distance standouts Molly Huddle and Thomas Chamney. Chamney won hL<it week's men's 800 meters and looks to continue his success against the solid field. 
Huddle is coming off a third place finish in last week's Missouri Invitational. However she did manage to qualify for the Big ElL"it Championships and will be one of the top collegiate com­petitors in the 5000 meters. 
Huddle's teammate Stephanie Madia will also run in the 5000 meters. 
Some of the other team mem­bers going to the meet include Godwin Mbagwu and Stacey Cowan. Mbagwu won the triple jump last week at Missouri with a leap of 14.52 meters. Cowan has been a consistent threat in the women's high jump all season long. She placed firSt in her most recent outdoor appearance, a 1.68-meter leap earlier this month in the spring opener. Both the men's and women's 4-by-400 meter relay teams will also make the trip. 
Those not making the trek to California will stay closer to home and participate in the Indy Relays in Indianapolis. Teams from around the region such as Butler, DePauw, Louisville and Ball State are expected to compete. 
"We just want to get people ready to run fast," Connelly said when asked what his team focused on this week in practice. 
The mild weather the last cou­ple of days has made outdoor practice easier on the Irish. 
"The bad weather has affected everyone lately and we had been hoping at some point to get a break," Connelly said. "From what I hear it's supposed to be nice in both places this weekend."

Irish ready for Lady Boilermaker Invitational 
By ERIC RETTER 
Sports Wrirer 

The only way for a team to reach its ultimate goal is to strive for greater and greater challenges. 
Notre Dame women's golf coach Debby King certainly has a lot of faith in this philosophy, as her team gets set to play in the Lady Boilermaker Invitational at Purdue. In what has become a pattern this sea­son, the Irish will once again face freshman Noriko Nakazaki. and her team "haven't really

The Irish came up short at No. 4, with sophomore Lauren Connelly falling to Jamie Peisel 7-6 (7 -2), 4-6, 7­6 (7 -4) to give the Wildcats a 4-2 lead.

Strong weekend key for Belles 
By BOBBY GRIFFIN 
Sports Writer 
The Belles have been clicking on all cylinders as of late, and they will look to continue that strong play this weekend when they visit Olivet Nazarene and Saint Xavier. 
Saint Mary's currently sits fifth in the MIAA with a 7-5 record. However, the two teams ahead of the Belles are 7-3 and 6-4, marks that Saint Mary's could feasibly pass in their last four contests. 
Coach Anna Walsh commented that the Belles are in a good position to make the postseason tournament for the first time ever, because of favorable league

Belles top Kalamazoo, 6-3 
By RYAN DUFFY Sports Writer 
Last year, Kalamazoo was the only team that could stop Saint Mary's. The Belles have continued to prove, howeve~ that a new year means a sec­ond chance, winning 6-3 Thursday for their second vic­tory over Kalamazoo in the past week. 
"They are always one of the better teams," Caitlin Cutler said. "We lost to them last year, and we wanted revenge. It's always a close match when we get together. It was a good win scheduling down the stretch, provided that they play well in their last four games. 
The Belles play their last remaining MIAA series against Kalamazoo, a team that current­ly sits at 0-8 in the league, while the other teams that Saint Mary's is competing with for positioning in the tournament have yet to play one another. 
This could open the door for Saint Mary's, provided that they can defeat Kalamazoo. 
Olivet Nazarene will present the Belles with their first non­league game since they dirtied their spikes on March 29 against Tri-State. The Belles had little trouble handling them, sweeping the doubleheader, but this week­end's games should present the 
for us because we improved from last weekend, and we were excited about that." 
No. 1 singles player Jeannie Knish agreed. 
"This was a really big win for us. We beat them 5-4 last weekend, then improved on that this time," she said. "We have two more conference matches to finish the season, but this was the big one. We have to keep the momentum up for the last two games to wrap up the conference." 
Saint Mary's currently stands undefeated in conference with a 5-0 record. 
"There were a lot of close 

Belles with much stiffer competi­tion. 
-Coach Welsh stated the week­end's games would allow the Belles to experiment with differ­ent pitching lineups because it is non-league play. While the Belles are confident that they can win provided they play as well as they did against Hope. Olivet Nazarene and Saint Xavier are top-level opponents, and coach Welsh commented that they could be the toughest two dou­bleheaders of the season. 
The Belles play Saturday against Olivet Nazarene at 1 p.m. and on Sunday against Saint Xavier at 12 p.m.

matches today, and everyone fought hard," Knish said. "People managed to come through and put in their best effort. Hopefully, we can play this way the rest of the season and keep it up next week." 
Cutler also felt the team gave a stronger effort than usual. 
"We are all kind of burned out with one week left in the season, so when we play our toughest competition. we give a little stronger effort and have a little stronger motivation," she said.

as passionate about basketball as they are about studying. 
In the first half, Team Zoidberg led most of the way but never by more than three points. Bosl's Fan Club closed the half with a surge to only trail by one, 11-10. 
But that was as close as they would get. Team Zoidberg, led by captain Kortny Hall, opened up an 18-14 lead before holding on to win. 
The two teams seemed equally matched, leaving Zoidberg team member Scott Stolpa confused as to how his team emerged victori­ous. 
"I still don't know how we won," he said. 
With a little more certainty, Hall pointed to his team's ability to get out and run the ball. "We had to keep running on them. I think we tired them out," he said. 
Varsity basketball player Greg Bosl did have some words of advice to his admiring grad school fans, even though not all team members were familiar with who their team's namesake actually is. 
"Stay in school," Bosl said, "because they're not gonna have fun next year." 
In a later game, The Danza Slaps had a rough time -literal­ly -with team Sex, Drugs, and House. During The Slaps' 21-10 loss to House, Kevin Fussner of the Slaps dove for a ball heading out of bounds. Unfortunately for Fussner, his team had opted to be "skins" and his dive left him with a glowing red scrape that covered the left half of his bare torso. 
An exasperated Fussner felt that his pectoral abrasion sig­naled a turning point in the game. 
"Five men, nine nipples -how do you expect to win a game like that?" he exclaimed. 
Meanwhile, Sex, Drugs, and House was busy winning the game to the tune of their favorite song, "Sex, Drugs, and House." A boombox sat on the sidelines and pumped out the tunes which House team member Griffin Eaton found both sophisticated and inspirational. 
"We just tried to class up this joint," he said, "[and] all our shots were money." 
In the realm of the ranked teams, No. 2 seed The Library had no problem closing the book on team Fisted Sister by a 21-5 margin. The Library, led by cap­tain Justin Funk, dominated the entire game from end to end. 
Sister team member John Bisanz felt that, all things being equal, the game just came down to talent. 
"Other than our lack of height and complete ineptness on the basketball court, [we lost] pretty much because we were deathly out of shape and they are just superior basketball players," he said. 
After the win, Funk said his team is looking forward with its eyes on a bigger prize. 
"We better [make the finals], we'll be pretty upset if we don't," he said. 
"We were No. 3 last year, and we lost in the Final Four so I want to make it one step farther.".

ND runs away with game against Butler 
By DAN TAPETILLO Sports Writer 
The Irish proved to be too much for Butler Thursday as they topped the Bulldogs 15-5. 
After getting off to a 1-3 start, the Irish have rebounded strongly -winning five of their last six games. 
No. 13 Notre Dame improved its record to 3-1 in the GWLL and 6-4 overall. 
"After our loss against Ohio State, we became determined to win," Irish attack Pat Walsh said. 
Butler could not stop Notre Dame from winning their third consecutive conference match after a strong offensive perform­ance. 
Notre Dame scored seven of the first eight goals of the match to take a commanding lead early in the contest. 
Brian Hubschmann led the 
Irish in scoring as he netted three goals for the team. 
"He is one of our best offensive players and it is important because he takes the attention away from our opponent's defense and it allows opportuni­ties for other players on our team to score," Walsh said. 
Walsh, Matt Karweck, Matt Howell and Lucious Polk each scored two goals apiece. 
A strong effort was made by the Irish defense, led by goalie Stewart Crosland. 
Crosland came away with another strong defensive per­formance after making 10 saves. He was relieved by Sean Quigley with just three minutes left in the match. 
Notre Dame took 53 shots and held a 40-35 advantage in ground balls. The team also won 12 of 24 face-off's. 
Butler was led by Phil Brauch who scored two goals, Anthony Crimmins who made a goal and an assist, and the team's leading scorer. Colin Joyce who netted one goal for the team. Goalie Sam Ashley made 19 saves. 
The loss drops Butler to 0-3 in the GWLL, 5-6 overall for the season. 
Despite impressive wins over their last three opponents, the Irish have not changed their goals from the beginning of the season.  
"Our main focus is still to just go out and win," Walsh said. "We are just trying to play for 60 min­utes and just taking it one step at a time."  
Notre Dame will wrap up its stretch of four games in 1 0 days by facing Fairfield Sunday at noon at Moose Krause Stadium. The match against Fairfield will be the team's final home game.

A capital opportunity 
No.2 Irish put"undefeated record on line at No.5 Georgetown 
By MATT PUGLISI Sports Writer 

A paj,r of lacrosse giants locks horns Saturday when 'the red hot No. 2 Irish travel to Washington to challenge rival No. 5 Georgetown (8-2, 4-0 in Big East) at 1 p.m. in a showdown with Big East Championship implications. 
"[Georgetown's] obviously very good," Irish coach Tracy Coyne said. 
"It's a huge rivalry game. They're a strong team in every position on the field, and we're just going to have to go out and play the way we have been." · 
Several other factors are on the line Saturday, including Notre Dame's current undefeated 10-0 mark, school record 14-game winning streak stretching back to last season and a prime oppor­tunity for revenge after the Hoyas handed the Irish a 16-15 overtime heartbreaking loss at Moose Krause Stadium last year. Notre Dame was unable to protect a 13-10 lead with 2:22 left, allowing three goals in regulation before ulti­mately falling in overtime. 
"We all think we should have won that game last year, and I think that overtime loss last year is definitely motivation," Coyne said. "All we had to do was get one possession off the draw [to win]. When you break it down to something as simple as one possession, I think people realize that we can [beat Georgetown]." 
While a glance at the most recent poll might suggest the surging Irish are the favorite come Saturday, the opposite appears to be the case. 
"If you went down to D.C. and asked who the

Irish face Big East rival Hoyas in key m_atchup 
By CHRIS FEDERICO Senior Staff Writer 
With just one game separating the top four spots in the Big East standings, the No. 5 Irish (27 -5, 8­2 in the Big East) suddenly find themselves in the middle of a dog­fight for the conf~rence title. 
After splitting a pair of confer­ence doubleheaders last weekend with Boston College and St. John's, the Irish travel to Bethesda, Md., for a three-game Big East series with Georgetown (20-20, 5-8). 
Notre Dame currently sits tied with Rutgers atop the Big East standings. Right on their heels are Pittsburgh and St. John's with conference records of7-3. 
The Hoyas have fallen on rough times of late, dropping seven of

-their last 10 conference matchups, but they won their most recent game Thursday, 5-4 over cross­town rival George Washington. The Hoyas are led offensively by 
left fielder Ron Cano with a .346 batting average. The heart of the team however is 2003 Big East third-team catcher Michael Lombardi. The fourth-year starter currently is batting .310. He is also second on the team with 23 RBis. 
As a team, the Hoyas are bat­ting .249, while opponents have hit .268 off the Georgetown pitch­ers. 
On the mound, Georgetown has a pair of four-game winners in junior right-hander Eduardo Pena and freshman righty Erick Chandler, who have posted ERAs of 2.75 and 3.09, respectively, this year. The Hoyas have a staff ERA of4.42. 
The Irish, meanwhile, saw sub­stantial mid-week success with a 17-5 victory over Oakland Wednesday, in which the Irish bat­ters cranked out 14 hits.

UICburns Irish in 10 
By HEATHER VAN HOEGARDEN Sports Editor 

Despite the fact that warm weather fmally arrived, the bats were cold at Ivy Field on Thursday evening. 
"It was a beautiful day," Irish coach Deanna Gumpf said. "You couldn't ask for anything nicer than what we got. We just didn't get it done." 
Notre Dame (32-12) was unable to muster enough offense to over­come Illinois-Chicago (20-18) in a 10-inning marathon game won by the Flames 4-3. 
"We had five hits in the first four innings and then just three hits after that," Gumpf said. "You've got to hit to win, and we didn't make anything happen. [The team] just waited for someone else to do it." 
The Irish struck blood first, put­ting a run on the board in both the first and second innings. In the first, Meagan Ruthrauff drove in Nicole deFau with a RBI double to left-center to make it 1-0. 
The next inning was much of the same, as Liz Hartmann and Nicole Wicks hit back-to-hack doubles to put the Irish ahead 2-0,

BOOKSTORE BASKETBALL XXXIII 
Battles on the hardtop continue 
By MATT MOONEY Sports Writer 

After two weeks of long sleeve shirts, tights and Spandex, the Barons of the Blacktop, otherwise known as the participants of Bookstore Basketball XXXIII, resumed second-round play on a balmy Thursday evening. The weather drew a large contingent of female spectators to the courts including senior Danielle Davis. 
"It's a great time for everyone to showcase their talent and for the girls to come out and scope some hot bodies," she said. 
But the games, not the bodies, proved to be the main attraction. 
Getting a jump on their assigned court time, two teams of graduate students met in one of the first games of the day in which Zoidberg and the Technicolour Express benched Bosl's Fan Oub by a 21-18 score. The competitiveness of the game proved these two teams are just
