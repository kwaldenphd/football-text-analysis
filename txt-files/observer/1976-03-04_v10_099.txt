Mock Convention underway 
Delegates get down to business 
by Phil Cackley Senior Staff Reporter 
The delegates of the Mock Convention rolled up their sleeves and 
got down to work last night, beginning the process of approving the 
platform. 
Also accolmplished last night was the election of a permanent 
chairperson and the approval of the reports of the credentials and 
rules committees. 

Ten planks were passed by the delegates, but not without l'Onsiderable debate. The platform was not originally on Wednesday's agenda, but platform chairmen Rick Littlefield and Mike Meissner made the decision to begin the consideration to avoid an overly extended session tonight, due to long debate on certain planks. 
The more controversial issues are to be considered tonight, including abortion. women's rights, gun control, busing and school financing. 

Only one major change was made in the platform, the acceptance of the minority plank on labor relations and standards. The minority plank was not the main plank presented by the platform committee to the delegates, and is more conservative than the majority plank. 
The decision to accept the minority plank came after a long roll call 
vote. the only one of the evening, in which the vote was 397 in favor 

of the minority plank, and 351 favoring the majority. 
There was considerable debate on the labor relations plank and numerous ammendments were proposed. Most of the planks dealt with last night were am mended in some way, and there was debate on nearly every plank and ammendment offered. 
Other planks approved were on national economic policy and management. tax reform. farm labor, assistance to farmenr, export produce, national energy policy, national transportation policy, environmental protection and foreign policy on Western Europe. 


Ten Planks were passed by the delegates last night but not without considerable debate. Most of the planks were passed by voice vote alone. 
Ron Hathaway was elected per­manent chairperson for the conven­tion early in the evening. The credentials committee. which ap­proved all of the delegates present, was accepted, as was the rules committee report. 
The election of the chairperson and the credentials report came ahead of the main speaker, Robert Strauss, National Democratic Party Chairman. who was late. The rules report was dealt with after Strauss' speech and the platform was 
considered  for  the  rest  of  the  
cvenin);!.  
Platform  chairman  Rich  Ltttle­ 

ficld commented last night that "Things went rather well, but judging from tonight it's going to go late tomorrow. 
All delegates and alternates have been requested to attend tonight's session, which is devoted solely to the platform. The NO Jazz Band will play from 6:30p.m. to 7 p.m., and Congressman Don Reigle of Michigan, will be the Keynote speakers. Visitors are encouraged to attend.

WASHINGTON AP -Despite White House insistence that "noth­ing was kept secret" in the Sinai accords, several members of the Senate Foreign Relations Commit­tee said Wednesday they knew nothing of agreements described by Egyptian President Anwar Sa­dat. 
Sadat told a weekend news conference there were three "sec­ret agreements." He said the United States guaranteed that Is­rael would not attack Syria, pled­ged to do all it could to see that the Palestinians would have a role in

any settlement, and vowed to try to bring about another disengage­ment agreement on the Syrian front. 
Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield, D-Mont., a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said: "We were told there were no secret agreements." 
Mansfield said he thought the panel ought to investigate the matter. He said the committee staff ought to "make appropriate inquiries at the Sate Department."

the committee, said Case did not recall being told of any agreements such as those described by Sadat. 
Nothing secret At the White House Press Secretary Ron Nessen said, "Noth­ing was kept secret in the consulta­tions with Congress . . . Any understandings of agreements were spelled out in great detail." State Department spokesman Robert Funseth said, "We have not withheld any secret agreements from Congress.'' Sen. Hubert Humphrey, D-Minn., said the agreements des­cribed by Sadat were familiar. He said the committee was told by 
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger that the United Staes "would encourage the Israelis to talk to the Syrians."

Sen. Frank Church, D-Idaho, said that if Sadat's version is true, "Congress and the American peop­le were once again deceived in a manner reminiscent of the Nixon years." 
Kissinger testified before the committee in closed session last October when the administration was seeking approval to send 200 American technicians to the Middle East to man surveillance stations in the Sinai. 
Members of the committee questioned him closely about whet­her there were any secret agree­ments. 
After a seven-hour session with the committee, Kissinger emerged with Church and the Idaho senator told reporters that Kissinger "told the committee this afternoon that all of the commitments that have been made by the government of the United States that are regarded as binding in character by the administration have been submitt­ed to the committee." 
An aide to Sen. Hugh Scott, R-Pa., said, "I've not seen any­thing along those lines" when asked about the Sadat statements.

the government can, under the first claim, interfere if you drive while drunk since you will be endangering others. However, under the second claim you would also be allowed to decide whether or not you were endangering anyone else; if you decided that you were not, then the government would have to allow you to continue driving. 
The claim to make solely personal decisions free from government interference is generally accepted in America (except in certain backward area where in loco parentis stiii reigns). But it is the society which usually decides whether the matter is really an entirely private one in which your actions will not hurt others, or whether you are violating someone else's rights. 
But one may ask whether the usual practice should be followed regarding abortion. The First Amendment properly prohibits any American government from passing legislation based on religious belief. But to what extent can society legislate a philosophical belief. (Of course many philosophical beliefs are implicit in existing laws: e.g. legislation against segregation implies strong philosoph­ical beliefs about the equality of men.) Does it make a difference that divisions of opinions are so sharp and that the numbers of people on both sides are roughly equal? 
These are all questioils that need to be answered if we are individually and collectively to come to the right decision about abortion. They will not be answered by screaming fanatics. Only calm, rational people aware ofthe complexities they are getting into

Conversations with a Campus Homosexual 
~~Christianity condemns hypocrisy, therefore I will not liue in the shadows" 

t;DITOR'S NOTE: The following interview was conduded by two OBSERVER editors with Cliff Dearagon, a ND student who has retently admitted his homosexuality. The text of the interview begins with a prepared statement by Deargon  

DEARAGON: No man can live apart, yet I am pressured by an act of institutional violence to live by standards that are not mine; standards that crush my indididual­ity. personality. and force me to live outside of my feelings, outside of myself. which is ultimately a form on insanity. and causes me ultimately to lose touch with myself and reality. Therefore I declare my individuality. my integrity, my devotion to truth and goodness in saying publicly that I am a homosexual. I have known for some time that by the grace of God I am well balanced. whole, trustworthy. and be­cause of this. I cannot take a position different from the church of which I am a 
member. of the society I live in without reverentially saying that it is false, hypocritical. baseless, and immoral. Objectively. though. this calls for pru­dence. Christianity condemns hypocrisy, therefore, I will not hide in the shadows. I call for the end of the church's and society's double-standard, well-intention­ed though it may be. Christianity censures immoral behavior, therefore I declare that what I do is not immoral. but that the attitude of the church and society as 11 whole is immoral. To insinuate that I am corrup.t, base, objectively evil. is an evil thing to do. OBSERVER: How long have you been a 
homosexual, and Is there something defin­Ite that made you declare yourself public­ly? 
DEARAGON: I am a deliberate person. and I've known since I was a child. but about age ten years ago I became involved with the homosexual life and I actually practiced it for live or six years. I stopped...at that time my mind was completely clouded. I didn't value myself. I didn't value society's norms. I turned a lot of dispicablc attitudes in toward myself. .. I just felt like a worm. By a process of drugs and searching out eastern religions, I came to know that God is my saviour. i thought that now I must lead this existence totally. and I did--my last experience was in 1969. I naively believed I was cured. I prayed, I went to prayer helped me to determine to take this stand for myself, though I'm late in doing this. But I feel I understand my position much better now. 
I am of the same basic position I was before I decided to take this step. before I 
espoused Christ, and followed the Church. 
when I attacked homosexuality and tried to 
persuade homosexuals to change their 
ways and I am in· the same position now. 
My basic position remains Catholic, Christ­
ian. and conservative. 
OBSERVER: How do you plan to react to general social opposition? DEARAGON: Case by case, and as things happen. I hope I would be able to react well. I'm not an exceptional person, just 
your ordinary Joe Blow. I'm not filled with pOise, repartee, and other natural defenses 
that arc going to help me. I just hope that I can respond in a way that people react towards me. Before I stated my position, I felt an inner turmoil. I didn't know what I was fighting. I'd rather know who is against me and who is for me. OBSERVER: You mention christianity quite frequently, yet the established Catholic attitude toward homosexuality is quite negative. So what brought you to Notre Dame? 
DEARAGON: I had no internal turmoil when I came to Notre Dame. I got here, and was quite ready to accept the Church's stand on homosexuals. I came here because I am a religious person. The help I hoped to receive is the help of my religion, the help any person expects to receive, and I had to pray because my conscience was taking a position contrary to the Church, and my conscience saying to me you are an integreted person, a whole and entire person. So I had to take a long look at what I was doing. I prayed a lot over Christmas vacation. After six or seven years of no experience, I would stop by the Grotto and ask Our Lady to keep me safe on a trip to Chicago; don't let me do anything. We!!. it didn't work out that way. I did have an engagement with two people. If that hadn't happened, I might not have had to confront the issue. But I did confront the issue, something I put before the Lord in 
prayer.  
OBSERVER:  How has thi s affe cted your  
family life?  
DEARAGON:  The  same  way  it  would  

affect your family life, I suppose, if you wrote home and said "I'm a homosexual." My mother and three sisters live in Phoenix, my father is dead. She probably wouldn't understand, and my sisters would love to spout off about how the Catholic Church is wrong, and give credence to the 
photograph of a homosexual. surface of things, what is the conscience and unconscious. Psychologists say the 

unconscious is feminine, so that puts me in touch with the feminine. One myth I would like to put rest is that homosexuals, or haptic persons, like to behave like a woman. If I have to suppress anything, the only instinct I have to suppress is being chauvanistic, machismo, the same as any other male. And my being a very feeling person gives me an insight into what is happenning underneath the conscious level, and to sec trends in society on a deeper level than most people experience. If our society was right, which I think it isn't, I feel I would be protected from worrying about my sexual proclivities at a!!. I would be a valuable person in society. As it is I feel my role is denied, but I have a role. Women's role is to be earth-people, to nurture life in some way, not just in the womb. Men tend to abstract the principles of what things are about. We all have a role. I would have preferred not to have played the role of publicly defending myself as one categorized as a homosexual. As one who is now a spokesman, I would have preferred to be in a position of just

groups, I was prayed over, and I was "cured," because now I realize the only thing I had to be cured of was my lack of character which led me to accept other people's norms. In that sense, I was cured. But as for being changed in my sexual orientation, I was rea!!y not true to myself. Because I fell in love with a _girl, I felt that I was whole. I used to go to gay bars I don't like them, by the way, I think they're the saddest places --and I used to trv to persuade the people to go straight. Then I would go home and be filled with desire, 
and I couldn't understand why.! would do this night after night, and I was just dccieving myself. I lived under this delusion. I came to Notre Dame and I was stripped of all my defenses. Then I came to realize the vulnerable position that I was in. Seeing Sgt. Leonard Mat!ovich on TV rca!!y helped me, because here was a person who was completley sane, good, healthy, of moral character and integrity, and I identified with him strongly as a person who was strongly indealistic. This 
myth that the Church marries homosex­uals. It hasn't affected my family life at all, because I'm not communicating with them. OBSERVER: Could you define your sexual morality; do you practice sex exclusively as an extentlon of love? DEARAGON: I cannot define it apart from love. In fact my experience over Christmas was enough to make me want to part with gay morality. I'm not -gay, I don't even like the term. I 1escribe myseif as a "haptic" person. someone who tends not to go by logtcal standards, but more by feeling and by wanting to experience something through his own feeling rather than by logical deduction. I am a happy person. 

OBSERVER: Sexually as well? 
DEARAGON: Though I seem illogical, I feel that in the total picture I am logical, some science we have not yet discovered. I fee! I have a definite role in society, not just as someone longing to be free, I believe God made me that way in order that I mav discern what is beneath the being 6-3, 2501bs., and being able to punch anybody in the mouth if they said anything I didn't like. I feel I know my role well, because I have had to look at it again and again and again, forced by Church and society. OBSERVER: Are you a member of Gay Liberation or have any affiliation with It on campus? DEARAGON: No. My personal philos­ophy is to live free. Because of my 
philosophy, I don't tend to belong. 
OBSERVER: You don't feel a greater 
responsibility to DEARAGON: I feel I am exercising my 
responsibility in as much as I can as well as a liberationist, because they haven't dared to come out in public and say who they are. Part of Notre Dame is very much a separationist creed, from society. NO is very exclusive. Gay Liberation is also very exclusive. I stand for myself. I don't know a single person who is gay on campus. Love is more improtant to me. I will never have a relationship apart from love. Now

that I have declared myself, it doesn't 
mean that I will have any affairs. 
OBSERVER: So you don't see yourself 
psychologically imbalanced in any way? DEARAGON: No. 
OBSERVER: Ifyou had a choice between a 
homo-or herersexuallife, which would you 
take? 
DEARAGON: Now you are putting things 
into categories. There are only people. I 
don't want to be other than what I am, 
what I was meant to be. 
OBSERVER: You seem to have quite a 
developed philosophy. Do you think this 
typical of homosexuals? 
DEARAGON: No, I would say I'm rather 
atypical. 
OBSERVER: Do you have any concept of 
what would constitute the typical homosex­ual attitude? DEARAGON: The typical attitude is a lack of identity, though homosexuals arc coming more into their own in the community. But they are wholly promis­suous. If I make a commitment, It must be a commlttment of total love, and could not be promiscuous In any way, therefore, I could not easily move in gay life, because promiscuouty Is assumed. The heterosex­ual is enhanced, held up for his sexual exploit, but the homosexual is looked down upon, as if he is some evil force. So 1must, 
in justice, fight this. OBSERVER: Now that you are openly declaring yourself, what do you see as your future? 
DEARAGON: It's going to be touch-and­go. I can't see what is ahead, I don't know how things are going to hit me. I will probably receive the most flak from my own department, the Physics Department, because people in science tend to be most rigid in their thinking. I am much more than just a haptic person. I am a person that wants to make the world better for this generation and generations to come. I'm the type of person who wants to love as a Christian. And so I expect many favorable things to happen as well, many people who will be extremely gratifying and enjoyable. 
1see myself as a human being. A human being, with intelectual, with much creativ­ity and positive value. The fact taht I feel well about myself made me impelled to do what I'm doing. OBSERVER: Then you are not apprehen­sive at all? DEARAGON: I may lose friends, I may have serious repurcussion with some people 1really depend on, but I may gain friends. I will really know who my friends are, whereas you may never know. OBSERVER: Thank you, Mr. Dearagon.

The problem was devised for the National Moot Court Competition held this fall. In that competition, the Notre Dame team finished fourth out of over 200 competmg teams.

At a news conference, officials said that to "improve checks and balances" at the executive level, the once-powerful office of pres­ident had been replaced by four secretaries and four directors, who are to share administrative respon­sibilities. 
Directors testify 
Two weeks ago, two managing directors of Marubeni resigned after testifying in parliamentary hearings that they had signed receipts for Lockheed for "pea­nuts," "pieces" and "units" with­
out knowing what these represent­ed and without receiving any payments. They and Hiyama all denied allegations that they had suggested or handled Lockheed payments to Japanese government officials in efforts to boost Lockheed sales here.

Batton hasn't set many goals for himself while at Notre Dame. "You can't set that many goals like scoring and that when you have a guy like Adrian Dantley in front of you." he pointed out. "I just go out and play to the best of my abilities and give 100 per cent. That's my only real goal." 
Not being a big-name player has hurt Batton somewhat. He would like to play on the Olympic team this summer, but as of yet he hasn't received an invitation to tryout. "If I get an invitation I'll tryout, but I don't think I will," he said. "I'm just not known well enough." 
Despite his lack of publicity. he is confident of his ability to play the game. Batton feels that he is capable of playing pro basketball and would like to give it a try after graduation. "I think I can play professional ball," he said. "If I get an opportunity I'll give it a shot. I've always wanted to, every kid that plays basketball dreams of becoming a pro.
