ND political clubs plan promotions 
BY TRAVIS SMITH 
News Writer 
With the presidential election just a month away, Notre Dame's two campus political party groups are making plans to promote their respective candidates. 
According to recent campus polls, Democratic can­didate Bill Clinton holds a slight advantage over President George Bush among campus voters.

"I believe Notre Dame is pulling away from its label as a conservative school. This is the biggest democratic movement here since John F. Kennedy in the 1960s," according to Andrew Holmgren, sophomore president of the College Democrats at Notre Dame. 
College Republican President Mark McGrath agrees. "I think it is unusual for the race to be so close on campus because of Notre Dame's conservative nature. This is a sign that the student body might be moving away from such conservatism," McGrath said. 
Holmgren said that the College Democrats have a number of events planned in the next month to promote Bill Clinton, including four or five debates. 
"Our primary goal is to get Governor Bill Clinton elected. Secondly, we want to increase a more demo­cratic way of thinking on campus," Holmgren said. 
"We're going to remain active as we have been, and we're going to win the campus," he added.

NO financial aid rose 8 percent last year 
By JOHN CONNORTON 
News Writer 
Financial aid distributed to students by the University of Notre Dame rose 8 percent to a record $72.6 million in the 1991-92 academic year, ac­cording to the annual report of the Office of Financial Aid. 
Of the almost $73 million in aid distributed, nearly $44.3 million went to undergraduate students, while graduate stu­dents received $28 million. A total of 7,181 students, 71 per­cent of the student body, re­ceived some form of aid during the year. 
This increase includes all re­sources provided to all stu­dents, namely scholarships, loans, grants and jobs from the University, government and private sources, said Joseph Russo, director of Financial Aid. 
"In 1990, our executive vice­president, Father Beauchamp, and the Board of Trustees set the long-range goal of meeting the full fmancial need of all stu­dents," continued Russo. "The significant jump in scholarships reflects the increased efforts of the development department and the University as a whole to meet this goal." 
In determining financial need, the University employs the services of an agency spe­cializing in college students. "This is basically how it's done across the country, at Harvard, Illinois, Stanford and many other schools," said Russo. Fi­nancial aid is then adjusted an­nually for each individual stu­dent, based on continuing need and the fmdings of the agency. 
Priority for University money is directed to incoming fresh­man students who are Notre Dame scholars and Holy Cross students if they demonstrate significant financial need, Russo said. However, he emphasized, "if students don't show a need, they won't get funding no matter how minority or how bright they are." 
Russo expects the NBC-Notre Dame television contract to eventually produce a large windfall for financial aid. The money given to the University has been invested and the in­terest accrued on the contract will be made available to stu­dents, Russo said. 
"The expected amount this year for financial aid is nearly $125,000. Eventually over 100 students will benefit at the end of the contract," said Russo. 
Russo said he was pleased with the financial aid situation and was hopeful for the future. Although he expressed regret that not every student could be helped, "given all the priorities for funding, the trustees and the officers have been reason­able in the support they have given," Russo said. 

Badin Hall gives $3,500 to victims of hurricane 
By MIKE NORBUT 
News Writer · 

Badin Hall residents pre­sented a check for $3,500 yes­terday to a family that relocated to the Michiana area after losing its home in Homestead, Fla., to Hurricane Andrew in September, according to Badin Hall President Nikki Wellman. 
The father of the Granado family, a mechanic by trade, lost all of his tools during the disaster, leaving the family without an income, she said. When they were recently relo­cated to the Michiana area, the family of nine children had to start from scratch. 
Badin heard of the family when WNDU covered the fam­ily's struggle, and the dorm decided to donate some of the proceeds from T-shirts sold earlier this year to the family. 
"We had planned to give $500 here and there, but we decided that we would make a bigger impact if we put it in one place," said Wellman, who pre­sented the check yesterday. "We wanted it to be personal, and this seemed to be a great opportunity." 
Badin earned over $10,000 from sales of their shirt. The money donated to the Granados will be used primarily to buy school clothing for the nine children, along with other inci­dentals. 
"We have sold some 3000 shirts since the beginning of the year," continued Wellman. "The people in the dorm have been a great help. Badin came through in a big way with this project."

INSIDE COLUMN 
What will the next Senate resolution be? 

The other day, while I was in the Student Union Board office (seeing if they had any more of those An Tostal T-shirts), I happened to find an interesting document. 
Its writer was identified only by the 
Paul Pearson 
name "P. McCarthy," but Associate News Editor 
it bore the title "Agendafor Future Senate ________ Meetings." 
What a coup, I thought. Then I read the list: 
• 
Pass a resolution saying that CBS should apologize for the antics of Murphy Brown and her desecration of the sacred office of Vice President of the United States. 

Underneath this, there was a handwritten note: "Have CLC officially change spelling of the word 'potato.'" 

• 
Urge the administration to change du Lac to make flag-burning punishable by crucifixion. 

• 
Ask ABC to officially apologize for that immoral action of broadcasting University o Miami football games. 

• 
Pass a resolution calling for the head of that offensive left-wing atheist who keeps slandering the good name of the President of the United States. 


Yikes! This last one hit pretty close to home, and it made me shiver. Maybe I should find some other public figure to criticize publicly, I thought, but I can do that later... 
• 
Create a policy forbidding anyone who doesn't show proper reverence to His Holiness John Paul II from being invited to speak at Notre Dame. 

• 
Have campus video store remove all copies of such movies as "The Last Temptation o Christ," "The History of the World, Part I," and "Monty Python's Life of Brian." 


Since I doubt they have those movies in there anyway, I ignored that one. 
• Pass procedure rule stating that all campus issues (security, research, academic quality, etc.) be locked into subcommittees, to ensure that really important stuff (i.e. stuff from 'Saturday Night Live') is always debated in full Senate meetings. 
Again, a handwritten note: "This one should be fairly easy." 
• 
Request that the Hammes Notre Dame Bookstore pull all copies of albums by such artists as Sinead O'Connor, Public Enemy, Madonna, Led Zeppelin and others whose songs represent "a front to the values we hold." 

• 
Draft a letter to His Holiness John Paul II telling him about all the things we've done to defend his sacred honor. 


Once again, a handwritten note, "Explain to Senate that the pope may not have been informed of it yet." 
• Urge HPC to create a "no-safe haven" policy, stating that those not showing "religious tolerance" will not be tolerated themselves on this campus. 
I had a little trouble reading that last one, since it was scratched out. In the end, I decided to ignore the document. It was too silly even for our student government.

Military plane was on fire before it crashed into West Virginia house 
BERKELEY SPRINGS, W.Va. (AP) -Witnesses said an Air National Guard transport plane was on fire before it slammed into a house, killing all six crew members in the third U.S. crash of a C-130 this year. 
A man escaped from the burning house with only singed eyebrows after the plane went down on a training mission Wednesday. 
National Guard officials would not speculate on the cause of the crash. The 11 other C-130s at the plane's Martinsburg base were grounded while the Air Force investigates, said Maj. Edward Dockeney Jr., a West Virginia Air National Guard spokesman. 
John Kazyak, who was flying his single-engine plane about four miles away when he saw the turboprop C-130E go down, said the pilot appeared to be trying to steer the crippled plane away from a residential neighborhood. 
"When it rolled I got the clear outline of a wing up toward the sky and I saw one engine. The other side was in flames," Kazyak said. 
Larry Yost, a 37-year-old carpenter, said the plane ap­peared to be missing a wing and had an engine on fire. "There was popping and snapping, and then it made a tremendous bang, and smoke and fire shot out the back end," he said. 
The crew gave no indication of trouble before the crash, said Capt. Ron Garton, an Air Na­tional Guard spokesman. The cockpit voice recorder was found and will be studied, said Brig. Gen. Jack Koch. 
The plane slammed into the home of 77-year-old Milton Barnhart, who was sitting at his kitchen table. He ran from the burning house, uninjured except for eyebrows and hair singed by flames. 
"There was just a little noise and then a big boom. I ran out, got out of there," Barnhart said, clutching a charred photo of his grandson. "There was fire inside and outside." 
Killed were: Lt. Col. Alfred Steinberger, 45, the pilot; Capt. Dallas Adams Jr., 32, the co­pilot; Master Sgt. George Grif­fith, 56, flight engineer; Staff Sgt. James Hinchman, 31, flight engineer; Staff Sgt. Frederick Jones, 24, load master; and Tech. Sgt. John Funkhouser, 32, load master.

"Most people are aware of

Search for crash victims ends in Netherlands 
AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP)~ Tbe search for bo(ii~s ·· at the El Al crash site ended Thursday; four days after the airliner tore into an apartment complex, and officials con~ 
firmed a death toll Qf 50. · · · ··· But they stressed that .a mu~h higher number of people d~~ main missing, most likely for~ ever. A formal list of the mh!s­ing was to be issued on Friday. "In a disaster of this type itJs highly likely tha,t hum~n bodies have been subjected to forces which render{them) irretrievable," said Anthony Busuttil, the senior forensic pathologist in the investigation of the crash of Pan Am Flight 103 ove.r Locker hie, Scotland on Dec. 22, 1988. "I have been to the site ofthe disaster area ... and, indeed, this is a situation where such disintegration is highly possi~ ble," said Busuttil, who is help~ ing officials determine the .ca­sualty toll in Sunday's disaster. The El AI 747-200 cargo jet crashed 14 minutes after tak­ing off from Schiphol airport. It slammed into a high~rise apartment complex as the pilot tried to return to Schiphol after losing at least one engine. Amsterdam Police Commis­sioner Erik Nordholt said the last body found was that of one of the plane's crew members. It was not identified furthero The jet's crew of three and one passenger all died in the crash. The rest of the victims

Security Council will attempt grounding Serbian warplanes 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) ­The Security Council on Friday will approve a ban on military flights over Bosnia and Herzegovina aimed at grounding at­tacking Serbian warplanes, diplomats said. 
But the council will not immediately authorize military action against the aircraft, they said. 
"This will be a two-step process," said British Ambassador Sir David Hannay. Friday's resolution calls for U.N. officials to monitor flights. A second resolution would be needed to authorize the shooting down of aircraft violating the "no-fly" zone. 
It was not known when the air-exclusion zone would go into effect, and no date was specified in the resolution. 
The United States initially had pressed for immediate military enforcement of the zone, but Britain and France argued for the two­stage approach, because enforcement could have prompted Serb attacks on 
U.N. peacekeepers and aid convoys. 
The United States, unlike Britain and France, has no peacekeepers on the ground in the region. 
The resolution says the council "decides to establish a ban on military flights in the airspace of Bosnia and Herzegovina, this ban not to apply to U.N. Protection Force (peacekeeping) flights or to other flights in support of U.N. operations, including humanitarian assistance." 
It calls establishment of a ban on military flights essential for distribution of humanitarian assistance and crucial to cessation of hostilities. 
It will be the first time the council has imposed such a zone. 
In Iraq, the United States, Britain and France acted independently in August to impose a flight ban below the 32nd parallel to protect Shiite Muslims from attack by the Iraqi government planes. 
Earlier Thursday, Bosnian Ambassador Muhamed Sacirbey asked for immediate enforcement of the zone to help aid reach Bosnian people.

Two car bombs explode in central London 
LONDON (AP) -Two car bombs exploded in central London on Thursday night, the London Fire Brigade said, a day after two small bombs planted by the Irish Republican Army went off in the city's theater district. 
There were no immediate reports of injuries and no 
immediate claim of responsibility for the latest blasts, which threw traffic into chaos and paralyzed parts of the British capital's subway system. 
The first blast Thursday was reported at 9:20 p.m. in Tooley Street, near the busy London Bridge train station, according to a Fire Brigade spokeswoman The second occurred at 10:30 
p.m. in Balcombe Street, near Paddington train station in northwest London, the Fire Brigade spokeswoman said. 
The Irish Republican Army's bombing campaign in London is part of a plan to disrupt British life and pressure the government to relinquish 

who spoke on condition of anonymity in accordance with British custom. 
"The area has been cordoned off and police are searching the area," she said. Police also closed London Bridge station and parts of London's subway system and cordoned off surrounding roads. 
Police said a telephone warning was received 10 minutes before the blast. 
control over Northern Ireland. 
The IRA said it planted the two bombs that went off in London's theater district Wednesday, one before dawn and the other before the evening curtain call. 
In the first attack Wednesday, five people were treated for minor injuries and shock after a small bomb exploded in a cast iron trash can near Piccadilly Circus, a busy tourist area packed with nightclubs.

U.S. Senate passes bill to aid cities 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The Senate today approved a tax bill that will raise $27 billion to finance aid to blighted urban areas and expand Individual Retirement Accounts. 
The 67-22 vote sent the bill to President Bush. Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas predicted it would be vetoed because it contained three dozen minor tax increases. 
"It takes an important step toward making life better for millions of American families, businesses and futures," said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. "It deserves to be passed and signed." 
The legislation grew in part out of the April riots in Los An­

West Indian poet Derek Walcott wins Nobel Prize for literature 
~----~-----,r~-­

• r , 'II , •• ,,-, 1 '
.J 


STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) ­Derek Walcott, whose melodi­ous poems celebrate the rich cultural diversity of his native West Indies but also evoke the darkness of colonialism, slavery and exile, won the 1992 Nobel Prize for literature on Thursday. 
"In him, West Indian culture has found its great poet," said the Swedish academy in award­ing the $1.2 million prize to Walcott, 62. 
A native of the former British colony of St. Lucia, Walcott teaches writing and literature at Boston University. When he got the early-morning call from the academy, he was working on a poem. 
''I'm still in a slight state of shock," he told The Associated Press. "When you say Nobel laureate, that's what I am. I suppose I'll get used to it." 
In selecting Walcott, the academy cited the "great lumi­nosity" of his writings, including the 1990 "Omeros," a 64­chapter Caribbean epic it praised as "majestic." 
"In his literary works, Walcott has laid a course for his own cultural environment, but through them he speaks to each and every one of us," the academy said. 
The selection comes just four days before the quincentennial of Columbus' arrival in the Caribbean. Commemorations of the anniversary have prompted debate over Columbus' dual role as explorer and subjugator. 
Walcott, who is of African, Dutch and English ancestry, said his work reflects the "very rich and complicated experi­ence" of life in the Caribbean. 
The child of teachers, Walcott was born in 1930 in the town of Castries on St. Lucia, an iso­lated volcanic island in the Lesser Antilles. Both his grandmothers were said to have been descendants of slaves, and slavery's bitter le­gacy is a theme of some of his poems. 
In his 1979 work about Ja­maica, "The Star-Apple King­dom," he wrote of the "groom, the cattleboy, the housemaid ... the good Negroes down in the village, their mouths in the locked jaw of a silent scream." 
Walcott divides his time be­tween the United States and Trinidad, and the exile of mil­lions of Caribbeans who have left the region in search of a better life is another frequent theme in his works. 
In the poem "Tomorrow, Tomorrow" he wrote: "A world's outside the door, but how upsetting/ to stand by your bags on a cold step as dawn/ roses the brickwork and before you start regretting ... " 
British writer Robert Graves said in 1984 that Walcott "handles English with a closer understanding of its inner magic than most -if not any ­of his English-born contempo­raries." 
Walcott's father died when he and his twin brother, Roderick, were infants. In interviews, he has recalled the book-filled home of his mother, who recited Shakespeare to him as a child. 
Mexican conservation commended 
Salinas is recognized by environmental group 
NEW YORK (AP) ­Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari was recognized by an American environmental group Thursday for including the protection of threatened species in his economic development plan. 
"He was the first head of state to recognize the global importance of biodiversity," said Peter Seligmann, chairman of Conservation International of Washington, D.C., which gave Salinas its first World Conservation Leadership Award. 
Some environmentalists have criticized Mexico for not enforcing its environmental laws rigorously enough. They also have expressed concern that the recently negotiated free-trade pact between Mexico and the United States could allow 
U.S. companies to seek refuge in Mexico and avoid tougher U.S. environmental regulations. 
Such criticisms overlook what Salinas has done to ensure the protection of his country's enormous wealth of biological diversity, said Russell Mittermeier of Conservation International. 
"The interesting thing is here you have a president of a significant country taking a great interest in conservation of biological diversity," said Mittermeier.

In February, Mittermeier said, he and 35 other biologists were invited to Mexico to brief Salinas on the importance of conservation of the nation's biological riches. 
"It is a biologically super­rich nation," Mittermeier said. He said Mexico contains more species of reptiles and cacti than any other country, and its coastal waters contain more species of whales and dolphins than anywhere else.

"We are paying a high price today for having neglected the environment in the past," Salinas said in accepting the award. He said protection of the environment was a corner­stone of the economic program he has launched to curb Mexico's foreign debt and create new jobs. 
He noted that Mexico is investing $4 billion to improve air quality in Mexico City, which has one of the worst air pollution problems in the world.

Israel says it will accept Palestinians in peace talks 

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -In a major policy switch, Israel said Thursday that it will accept participation of Palestinians from outside the occupied terri­tories in the regional Mideast peace talks. 
The announcement by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres followed meetings by Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa with Israeli leaders. It was seen as a step forward in stymied Arab­Israeli peace negotiations. 
But Peres said that those Palestinians taking part in the regional talks could still not be-

Israel still opposes the inclu­sion in the main peace talks in Washington of Palestinians from outside the Israeli-occu­pied territories. 
Israel had refused to attend multilateral talks on refugee problems and economic devel­opment because exiled Pales­tinians had planned to take part. It had agreed to attend three other sessions on regional issues. 
"The agreement is that the Palestinians who participate in all the five committees can be from outside the territories," Peres said. 
Israel objected to attendance at the multilateral sessions by outside Palestinians because it feared this could revive de­mands by those exiled with the founding of Israel in 1948 to return to their former homes. 
The participation of so-called diaspora Palestinians also hints at involvement by the Palestine Liberation Organization, but the limits placed by Israel seemed

Jerusalem because Israel an­nexed the land after seizing it from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war. 
Thursday's decision did not affect Israel's refusal to accept diaspora Palestinians in the main bilateral peace talks Israel is holding with Syria, Lebanon and a joint delegation of Jorda­nians and Arab residents of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
But Moussa said the important aspect of the decision was wider Palestinian participation in the multilateral peace talks. 

Environmental problems plague Russia, report says 
MOSCOW (AP) -Russia is suffering from serious land, water and air pollution, and its national health is worsening, according to reports that Presi­dent Boris Yeltsin says are the first truthful government assessment in 70 years. 
The reports on the environ­ment and public health, issued this week by Yeltsin, paint a grim picture of decades of ne­glect under the Soviet regime and says the situation is wors­ening as cash-strapped busi­nesses shun pollution controls. 
According to the environmen­tal report, a copy of which was published in Wednesday's Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspa­per, nearly a sixth of Russia is polluted, almost three-fourths of its people breathe dirty air, and nearly half its tap water doesn't meet hygiene stan­dards. · 
The public health report said life expectancy had fallen from 64 years for men and 74.4 years for women in 1991 to 63 years for men and 69 years for women in 1992. 
Among the more startling health statistics cited: 98 per­cent of the population suffered from dental or mouth diseases. The report also said 42 percent of Russia's hospitals lack hot water, while 12 percent have no central water supplies. 
At least 2.3 million people in Russia alone still live on terri­tory contaminated by the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident, the report said. 
Yeltsin, who ordered the re­ports a year ago, distributed them to the legislature Tuesday and said they told "the bitter truth." 
"Perhaps it is for the first time 

Fri & Sat

in many decades -in fact for 
the last 70 years -that we 
have heard the truth," Yeltsin 
said. "We are openly advising 
everybody about the scale of 
ecological disaster inherited 
from the past, and also about 
the real state of health of 
people in Russia." 
Yeltsin offered no solutions, and with a huge budget deficit the government lacks the power to clean up the country. But the reports were seen as a step toward generating support for an environmental policy. 
The report cautioned that some of its information, espe­cially that on industrial waste, "cannot be seen as reliable" because there is no statistical data available. 
In the Soviet era, reliable in­formation on the environment and many other social subjects was suppressed until policies of openness were introduced by former President Mikhail Gor­bachev. 
Russia faces "a very grave environmental situation," said Yevgeny Belayev of the State Committee for Sanitation Su­pervision. 
Fifteen percent of Russia's 6.8 million square miles of territory has "unfavorable ecological conditions," the report said. 
Of its 148 million people, 110 million live in areas where the air contains more than five times the maximum allowable amount of pollutants, the report said. In 84 cities and towns-including Moscow­that amount is 10 times the maximum, it said. 
Only 15 percent of city dwellers Jive in areas with an acceptable level of air quality, according to the report.

Lugar honored by USAir strikers reach tentative agreement 
small business advocacy group 
Special to The Observer 
The National Federation of Independent Busi­ness (NFIB) has recognized U. S. Senator Richard Lugar for his outstanding acheivment towards small business. 
The non-partisan group cited Lugar as a "Guardian of Small Business" for voting favorably on issues affecting small business during the two years of the 102nd Congress. 
"The health and viability of small business is critical to our economy", said Lugar. "The federal government should support small businesses by reducing the budget deficit with spending re­straints and streamlining of wasteful bureau­cracy." 
NFIB, the nation's largest small business advo­cacy group represents nearly 600,00 small and independent firms in all 50 states including over 17,000 in Indiana. 
BUSINESS BRIEFS 
GM delays Epcot commitment 
•LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. -Poor car sales kept General Motors Corp. from making a long-term commitment to Disney Corp. as a corporate sponsor at Epcot Center, a spokesman for the automaker said. GM's exhibit at the World of Motion pavilion attracts millions .of visitors a year, but the automaker opted for a one-year extension on its sponsorship rather than renewing a 10-year contract. The carmaker will consider a longer commitment next year, said John Krug, director of special events for GM's corporate communications department. GM was Epcot's first corporate sponsor, signing on in 1977 for the 1982 opening. 
USDA plans ethanol research 
•WASHINGTON -The Agriculture Depart­ment plans to spend $100 million over five years on research to cut the cost of producing ethanol by at least 25 percent. Agriculture Secretary Edward Madigan said nearly $10 million would be spent this fiscal year, which began Oct. 1. USDA will seek the balance over the next four years from Congress. "If agriculturally based fuels such as ethanol can be made cheaply enough, a vast market awaits," Madigan said in remarks prepared for delivery Thursday. "If we can cut production costs, it will mean a more secure energy supply, cleaner air, expanded markets for corn and a real economic boost for rural America." 
Women buying more new cars 
•DETROIT -Women bought 49 percent of all new cars sold in the United States last year, compared with 36 percent a decade ago, ac­cording to figures compiled by Ford Motor Co. and supported by industry analysts. 
Auto experts say that upward trend likely will continue, extending to higher sales of trucks and luxury cars, where women still only account for about a third of the market. 
"There's only one way the numbers are going -and that's up," said Mimi Vandermolen, Ford Motor Co.'s first female designer. 
GM signs up millionth customer 
•DETROIT -General Motors Corp. said Thursday it has signed up its 1 millionth cus­tomer for its new GM MasterCard, less than a month after launching the program that lets consumers spend their way to an auto rebate. Ronald Zebeck, managing director of GM's credit card operations, said the 1 millionth card was issued sooner than any other credit card in history "and during an unbelievable time of competition within the industry." The GM MasterCard applies 5 cents of every dollar spent toward arebate on the purchase or lease of a new car or truck from one of GM's five car divisions or GMC Truck. GM's small-car subsidiary, Saturn, is not included in the 
program. 
borrow quickly, said Standard & Poor's Corp. airline analyst Betsy Snyder. Since then. massive fare cutting and expected losses from late summer have probably dwindled that amount, but it was unclear how long the bankroll would last. 
USAir was paying pilots their regular salary, even if their flights were canceled by the strike, the Air Line Pilots Association said. The airline was also reimbursing rival airlines for accepting tickets from stranded USAir passengers. 
Flight attendants had been due to seek court permission today to join the 8,300 Machinists in a sympathy strike, but delayed seeking a hearing until Oct. 19. 
The flight attendants' union had called for a sympathy strike Monday, shortly after the Machinists walked out. At some airports about half the flight attendants stayed off the job and at others about 80 percent to 90 percent stayed away before they were ordered back Monday night, said David Melancon, spokesman for the Association of Flight Attendants. 
USAir spokeswoman Nancy Vaughn said a "handful" of Machinists members had returned to work Tuesday and Wednesday, but did not know how many or at which airports. Jim Conley, a union spokesman, denied Machinists were crossing picket lines.

WASHINGTON (AP) -USAir reached a tentative agreement today with a machinists union that went on strike Monday, causing the cancellations of hundreds of flights around the country. 
The agreement is subject to ratification by the 8,300 members of the International Association of Machinists. 
National Mediation Board Chairman Kimberley Madigan said the tentative agreement between USAir and the Machinists was reached at 11:30 a.m. after a 22-hour negotiating session. 
The union was not immediately available for comment, but USAir said in a statement that the Machinists leadership "has indicated that it will recommend ratification." 
The airline said that if the new contract is ratified, union leaders expect their members to return to work on Sunday. 
Seth Schofield, USAir's chief executive officer, described the tentative agreement as "fair and equitable." 
"We achieved our goal of reducing costs for both the near and long term," Schofield said. 
"USAir will be at full pre-strike service levels at all of the 124 airports on our domestic and international route network on Monday·morning," Schofield said. 
Details of the agreement were not

immediately released. 
The two sides started meeting separately with mediators at about noon Wednesday. 
USAir has been flying 60 percent of its normal service, not counting its Northeastern shuttle and regional commuter line, which were not affected by the strike. The airline added about 120 flights Tuesday and said it plans to add more flights soon. 
USAir, trying to deal with hundreds of millions of dollars in recent losses, asked its employees late last year to accept a package of wage and benefit reductions that it said could save a total $400 million in 1992. 
The Airline Pilots Association, representing Usair's pilots, agreed to accept such a package in June and the pilots crossed the picket lines to keep about 60 percent of USAir normal schedule in operation. 
But the Machinists, representing the airline's mechanics and ground crew workers, said they were being asked to accept deeper cuts than other categories of employees. 
They said the airline was attempting to replace some union members with less skilled non-union help for certain tasks such as aircraft de-icing. 
Industry analysts had wondered how long USAir could hold out. 
As of June 30, the airline had $216 million in cash on hand and an additional $686 million it could 
WASHINGTON (AP) -In a last­minute attempt to persuade President Bush to sign a $27 billion tax bill, Democrats in Congress are pointing out that a veto would raise taxes on many businesses and individuals. 
"If this bill dies, businesses will face higher taxes on money they spend for research," a Democratic strategist said Wednesday. "The self-employed will lose their tax deduction for health insurance." 
Added another Senate aide: "It would be ironic for the president to oppose tax increases for the rich and then allow taxes to rise on small busi­ness." 
Without the bill, several targeted tax benefits that expired June 30 will stay dead with no chance of being revived until next year. 
Bush, presumably, is aware of those facts. But there is no indication that he has changed his mind. Leaders of both parties predict that if the Senate passes the bill, he will veto it because of the three dozen minor tax increases it includes. 
The bill is scheduled for final action Thursday, on what should be the last day of the 102nd Congress. With a little support from Democrats, Re­publicans could block passage of the bill, but that is unlikely. 
The tax bill is not the only piece of legislation going nowhere as this Congress heads into history. 
Democrats, who control both houses of Congress, insist they are continuing to push the doomed tax bill because they think it would be good for the country. They deny it is an effort to embarrass Bush. 
A veto would allow Democrats to point out that the president blocked expanded Individual Retirement Accounts for millions of Americans; relief from luxury taxes on expensive yachts. furs, jewels and planes; relaxed rules designed to stimulate real estate, and the incentives the president sought for job creation in inner-city "enterprise zones." 
Lower interest rates promote ten year mortgages 
NEW YORK (AP) -When it comes to home mortgages, the loans of the future may be more reminiscent of the simpler past. 
Shorter-term borrowing -the mainstay in residential real estate prior to the early 1960s -is in vogue again as a result of lower interest rates. stable housing prices and a growing trend toward reducing debt. 
Nothing is more telling than the recent emergence of the 10-year fixed-rate mortgage. 
"It's a relatively new phe­nomenon ... unheard of back in the last decade," said Noel Fahey, managing director for Financial Research Institute, a Washington-based consulting concern. 
Fahey said 10 years ago few predicted the 15-year mortgage would be as common as it is today. He said the same eventually could happen with the 10-year loan given the changing demographics and provided that interest rates remain low. Rates are now at 20-year lows. 
Right now, at least a dozen financial institutions actively promote the 10­year mortgage, which usually carries rates around a percentage point be­low a conventional 30-year loan, says HSH Associates, a Butler, N.J.-based mortgage research firm. Many more larger banks, though, can customize such loans for those who qualify, HSH says. 
The obvious draw of the 10-year mortgage is the speed with which the loan is paid off and equity is built up, and the subsequent savings in interest payments.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Oh Lord, please let it just be some bad dream 
Dear Editor: 
By way of introduction, yours truly was a student here, from September 1968 to June 1972. Hesburgh, Burtchaell, Evans, Jemieltity, O'Malley, Duffy, Sniegowski, Krause, Parsegian, et al. 
I majored in English Lit., married and earned a degree. I schooled elsewhere for a few years and returned home, to Ohio, to earn a living and raise a family, trying never to lose sight of or touch with virtue, values, and vision (in large part learned here). 
Fast forward to the evening of Sept. 26, 1992, Residence Inn-Marriott, South Bend. Over a score later, and older. And Purdue. After kids' demands, and rain; tailgating, and rain; and just two quarters, dinner, merriment, and rain; retirement by 9:00 p.m. Then, a nightmare: 
1) En route to the Convo Rally on Friday, the game's eve, the family is besieged by those akin to the Money Changers stationed at the Temple's gate; 
2) At the Rally, a quarter­back's coach, presumably rep­resenting the Coach, and vicar­iously, his University's adminis­tration, denigrates the truth that, "It's not whether you win or lose, but how you play the game," in favor of "Winning isn't everything. It's the only thing;" 
3) And at that Rally, amid caring and conciliating cries for "Lou" to speak, a leprechaun master of ceremonies curtly cuts to the usually pacifying Alma Mater for relief-and this Lou does not speak; 
4) On Game Day, the "first string" remains on the field, although five touchdowns ahead in the third quarter; and 
5) While six touchdowns ahead in the fourth quarter, the first-team defense is recalled to the field to successfully thwart the final scoring attempt of a hurting, hapless and embar­rassed regiment reaching for a parcel of dignity. 
At 4:00 a.m., this awful dream was discounted and dis­pelled. Its harborer awoke and thanked God it was only a dream; and thanked Him that such could never happen here, at Notre Dame, where virtue, values, and visions are, in large part, learned.

Why blame NBC for singer's inferno? 
Dear Editor: 
I am just writing to say that I think that it was very unfair of the Student Senate to blame NBC for Sinead O'Connor's be­havior on the previous episode of "Saturday Night Live." "Saturday Night Live" is well known for its live and uncen­sored entertainment, which is what gives it the controversial and satirical nature for which the show has become famous and loved. 
The policy of the show's being live not only made it difficult for the producers to stop Sinead or cover up her action, even if they knew and asked her not to rip up the picture beforehand, but also to condemn her practice of free speech and expression. 
To do so would have meant going against the very essence of the show's being, and would have been somewhat hypocritical of "Saturday Night Live," given its own history of daring and brash performances. 
The very first host of the show when it started in 1975, George Carlin, was doing a routine making fun of Jesus and religion, and yet he was not banned or dismissed from the show. He is one of many controversial acts the show has displayed. 
That is not to say that I think Sinead O'Connor is right in what she did. I don't. I thought her act was futile and unlikely to bring any solutions to any problems that she has with the world. 
Nevertheless, I think it is wrong to deny her an outlet to express her own personal frustration with religion and politics, especially because she comes from a country where religion and politics bring nothing but anger and misery. 
Her using the show to express her views is no different than the writers and producers of "Saturday Night Live," as well as the audience and viewers themselves, using skits and mock commercials to express annoyance and frustration with the Bush administration and American society in general. 
Just because the skits are more fun to watch than Sinead O'Connor ripping up a picture of the Pope doesn't change the fact that they, like the picture, are making socio-political statements. 
Yes, I agree with the Student Senate in saying that the action showed no tolerance or respect. But I don't blame NBC for the chip on Sinead's shoulder or her experience with religion and politics in northern Ireland. 
Why make NBC apologize for its policies of free expression, when all Sinead will do is use her fame elsewhere to make similar statements in the future? Why ask "Saturday Night Live" to change its ways for nothing? 
Accept the fact that angry, frustrated, famous people will always find a soapbox to stand on. And be glad that ripping up a picture is the worst she can do, while people in her homeland are throwing Molotov cocktails and shooting guns.

I 
Dear Editor: 
Did anyone else find the ridiculously sarcastic tone and far-from-clever rhetoric that represented the bulk of Profes­sor Glenn G. Fogarty's letter responding to Professor Stephen Fallon (The Observer, Oct. 2) embarrassing? 
I certainly understand that the editorial page must stand as a forum for every ideological and emotional voice, but if we must be periodically reminded of the sadly reactionary state of our University's Law School (by way of Professors Rice, Fogarty, and their ilk), is it too much to ask that these letters please lose their hysterical tone, take a deep breath, and present their arguments with some sem­blance of maturity? 
In any decent courtroom Fogarty's polemic would surely have met the judge's firm inter­jection, "Please arrive at the point, Counselor." 
We are here to be educated, both through instruction and example. If our faculty is incapable of confronting important issues in a focused, effective manner, then what is to be expected of their students?

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

The few, the proud, the 'contemptibly chauvinist' 
Dear E~ditor: 
As a former NROTC mid­shipman and a member of the Semper Fidelis Sodety, I am outraged by the•Marine Corps' advertisement printed in The Observer on Oct. 5. It stated that "Maybe you're the kind of man we're looking for." 
Having participated in Marine ROTC and being a female, I take personal offense in the implication that women are not as capable as men to be good marines. 
Obviously, most women do not have the physical strength to be a "grunt" in the trenches, but they certainly do have the intellectual and physical capacity to serve in the Marine Corps' aviation, intelligence, logi1!fcs, law, communications, an~ administrative collllfttlnities. 
As we have all witnessed in the Persian Gulf War, Support and Combat Arms are equally important to the success of the Marine Corps. It is appalling to me, in light of the recent Tailhook scandal, that the Marine Corps would be so callous as to blatantly 
· discriminate against women. 
The Marines may be few and they may be proud, but that does not excuse such con­temptible chauvinism. 
Erin King Howard Hall Oct. 6,1992 

News headline showed disrespect 
Dear Editor: 
Please reassure me that the headline to Theresa Aleman's news article on "Respect Life Week" resulted simply from careless journalism. 
The polarized abortion debate needs no help from journalists who, writing under the guise of objective reporting, sacrifice in­tegrity to advance their per­sonal beliefs. 
Somehow, someone on The Observer staff forgot that the "horrors of abortion" was Claire Johnson's opinion of the effect of legalized abortion in the United States. 
In fact, Johnson's quoted opinion differed from the headline itself, rendering inappropriate the use of quotations around "horrors of abortion." 
For me, the tragic deaths of 10,000 women in Romania from illegal abortion (described in the article beneath Aleman's) constitute the true "horrors" of abortion. 
This particular article, however, received a factual headline, not one loaded with pro-choice sentiment. 
The Observer's actions were not tantamount to fascism or insidious thought-control. But they did show disrespect for certain members of Saint Mary's and Notre Dame by asserting as truth in the head­line of a news article an opinion about abortion. 
Not everyone subscribes to the "pro-life" position. Indeed, in light of the report on Romania, supporters of abortion rights may have a different understanding of "Respect Life Week."

By JULIE WILKENS Assistant Accent Editor 
I 
t's roadtrip time! There's no wonder it's known as "Fun City". 
It's the site of one of the 
hottest team's in baseball. a 3,000 
foot roller coaster. and a new airport 
on the cutting edge of architectural 
design and technology. As if that 
weren't enough. Pittsburgh is the 
home of public television's favorite 
children's show, Mister Rogers' 
Neighborhood. 
For those adventurous Notre Dame 
fans who are pilgrimaging to the 
game this week-end, following are 
just a few ofthe hot spots to hit. 
EATING AND ENTERTAINMENT 
AROUND THE CAMPUS: 
The place to be is Oakland. Pitt is 
Oakland, Oakland is Pitt. The 
University of Pittsburgh itself is in 
Oakland, but when asking for 
directions, most people will direct you 
to an area of about four square 
blocks between Forbes and 5th 
Avenue. Most of the action in 
Pittsburgh is on Forbes, which is only 
ten minutes from downtown. 
•Blue Lou's Bar and Grill (phone: 381-PORK) "White-collar ribs for the masses," 
says the Pittsburgh publication City Lights. Juke box and food 'till midnight, open until 2 a.m. 
•Calico's 
Just down Forbes Avenue from the 
Original Hot Dog Place(The "0") and 
away from the stadium, Calico's has 
live entertainment on occasion. Your 
typical 'Backer/Commons haunt, the 
place is basically nondescript. Like 
many of South Bend's watering holes, 
it is the people who make make the 
place worth visiting. 
•Carnegie Mellon University 
Because the nightspots are all for those 21 and over, many Pitt students hit the frat houses around campus. Carnegie Mellon University borders Pitt and their frat parties practice more of an open-door policy than Pitt. 
While the seemingly universal rule of girls having an easier time than guys getting in the door applies here, all students should carry their college IDs. ND has SUDS, and Pitt has the LCB (or Liquor Control Board)­-anyone working the door of a party will card you to make sure you are not undercover. 
•C.J. Barney's 
Also on Forbes, C.J. Barney's has two bars (upstairs and downstairs) and is known for its selection of 12 different burgers, including a Spinach and Swiss ensemble. Open for 23 years, they claim access to the best 
D.J. in Oakland. 
•Confetti's Another Forbes Avenue hang-out, Confetti's sometimes has live bands. 
•Dave & Andy's Ice Cream 
A possible Ben & Jerry's spin-off, the cookie dough ice cream comes highly recommended. 
•The Decade Know for its live entertainment. 


•Mario's South Side Saloon 1514 E. Carson St. 381-5610 Homemade linguine, seafood. The 
Pittsburgh visitors dining guide said, "You haven't been to Pittsburgh till you've been to Mario's." Famous for "the giant yard of beer". Described as casual, crowded and colorful. Check it out. 
•The Original Hot Dog Place 
Known more commonly as the "0", this is THE landmark of Oakland. The bar upstairs has a television (if you can't get tickets to the game); downstairs has "0" fries. They are filled with grease and rumored to be incredible. What's more, a small order will feed at least three people. This goes for their pizza as well; their 16-piece costs only three dollars. 
If you can only do one thing at Pitt, get some fries. 
•Pirmanti Brother's 

Pirmanti Brother's is home to the original Pittsburgh sandwich. Like at many sandwich shops, you'll get coteslaw and french fries with your order. But forget any "on the side" business; that 'slaw and fries is going right between the bread. 
•The Spaghetti Warehouse 2610 Smallman St. 261-6511 For those who long for the familiar 
establishments of South Bend, try Pittsburgh's version of this perennial favorite. Casual dining, large groups welcome. Reservations are taken. 
PLAYING TOURIST 

. For those roadtrippers who can't get enough of America's favorite sport, rumor has it that tickets to the Pirates/Braves game are still available. If, however, baseball is not your idea of quality entertainment check out these tempting Pittsburgh landmarks. 
•The Carnegie 

An overvie·w of what to do in Pittsburgh is incomplete without a mention of The Carnegie, the realization of Andrew Carnegie's dream of combining art, science, music, and literature. This Oakland facility includes one of the country's largest dinosaur collections, a Museum of Art featuring works from the Renaissance to the 20th century, a 2000 seat music auditorium, and the most comprehensive library in the area. Perhaps something to do instead of tailgating? 
•The Cathedral of Learning 
As ND has the Dome, Pitt has the Cathedral. The Cathedral of Learning is a large Gothic building that can be seen from downtown Pittsburgh. An interesting area to visit might be the first floor, where the International Classrooms are housed. Each classroom is decorated authentically to a corresponding «;ountry. Sweden, Ireland, Switzerland, and other countries donated all materials to lend a realistic look to the exhibit. And for those on a tight budget-it's free. 
•Mister Roger's Neighborhood 
This childhood institution, as well as the infamous Sesame Street, was filmed in Oakland on 5th Avenue next to Central Cathedral High School. Go

Maybe the Pope is not the real enemy 
Father Robert Griffin 
letters to a Lonely God 
On Wednesday this week, I was 67, which could mean either that I may be courting senility, or else that I am no longer wet behi_nd the ears. 
At a time when others all around me are losing their heads, shouldn't I be smart enough to stay out of the line of fire? As an irascible Irishman in love with his Church and his country, I keep riding off wildly in all directions, wanting to kick Catholic ass whenever it starts putting on airs as an angel of light. 
I could almost laugh at the spectacle of Sinead O'Connor, trashing the Pope on television. Is John Paul II really the en­emy? It sounds like a left­handed compliment which proves he's not an out-of-touch wimp -"the world forgetting, by the world forgot"-who should be remembered mostly as a joke, which is the way the liberal Catholic press seems to treat him. 
Tearing up his picture was fairly tepid as an expression of hate. Years ago, a Hollywood writer said of Jesus: "They should have fed Him to the lions. You can't make a reli­gious symbol out of mincemeat. 
Hearing this, you're left stunned by the bitterness un­derlying the mockery. Sinead, I suspect, was looking for public­ity that would make her a household name, like Murphy Brown, on the opposite end of the spectrum from Dan Quayle. 
Sinead, on the opposite end of the spectrum from the Holy Fa­ther, brings to mind a see-saw where all the weight is on one end. Abusing the Pontiff was a cheap shot which draw no blood. 

I'm sure that for the sake of the shock value, the young lady would have abused the crucifix, if she had dared. Would her tearing up Mother Teresa's picture have seemed so m·uch like striking a blow for women's lib; or did she feel driven to vent her spleen at the world's most exalted male chauvinist? How much more fulfilling it would have been for her if the Pope were running for office on the Republican ticket. 
I hope that American prelates will not start running amok over the incident, wringing their hands as though a sacri­lege had been committed. For the NBC network, however, it should be a time for soul­searching. 
Many Catholics have their own soul-searching to do. In the eyes of the world, the reigning Pope, whoever he is, has been the spoilsport sent from God, to get in the way of the sexual revolution like a roadblock. 
Even in the shadow of big rock-candy mountain which is the Church, the recent Popes have been denounced as the enemy of Catholics demanding to be sexually liberated From the heart of the cesspool of lust which has left our cities sick­ened, accusing voices raise their cries from the heart, "Why must the Catholic religion be so hung up on sex?" 
Humanae vitae, the 1968 en­cyclical opposing artificial birth control, seems to mark the Church's great fall from grace which lost our religion its cred­ibility; and the shame of it all seems to hang over the Popes, as though this were their origi­nal sin in the modern age. 
Birth control is not a matter on which I can endlessly advise you; however, only yesterday, I read of an eleven-year-old who told her parents that she had just learned in school how to stretch condoms over a bunch of bananas. 
Many of you should be able to learn about "safe sex" from the eleven-year-olds in your family or neighborhood; and this un­doubtedly is one of the happy fall-outs from the sexual revo­lution for which repressed Catholics have been clamoring. 
What I do remember is that back in the 30s, George Bernard Shaw used to describe birth control as "mutual mas­turbation." The Pope's point of view in Humanae vitae was that when God created man and woman to be two in one flesh, mutual masturbation wasn't what He had in mind. 
Obviously, I'm not a husband flirting with fatherhood, and I don't play the game; and nei­ther does the Pope who wants to call the plays. The thing he's chiefly blamed for is for holding out for something better than the mere neutering of human sexuality in a way which divides the tie which should bind. 
The Pope could be a hero long after Dr. Ruth is in disgrace as a false prophet, once doctors, heeding the papal indistence, can show women how to control their fertility by natural means, instead of with strong drugs that could sicken them, or surgery that could leave them scarred. 
In the meanwhile, we're suf­fering the after-shocks of a sexual revolution-do I need to catalogue the horrors?-which wasn't of the Pope's making. Why call him the enemy? 
The enemy we should fear most has turned out to be us, once we turned a responsible human act into a joyride; for the joyride has become an in­dustry which has left our morality in ruins. Sex clubs and porno shops can scare you with the feeling you're falling down a bottomless well. 
In all the great westerns, the showdown comes at high noon. For America, it could be later than we think; but where is the sheriff? . Dan Quayle may be in the mood for a shootout, but he ain't the Duke, walking tall and casting a long shadow. Dan has too much of a puppy look, to lead us in from the cold. 
But who among us would be churlish enough to tell Pope­bashing Catholics that they should start listening to Rome? The Pope cannot be the enemy of the people of God; but some of his friends can, whenever they claim to speak the Pope's mind for him. 
If there are papists among us who believe that Rome wants to get its oar into the American elections this year by pressur­ing Catholics into believing .that it would be sinful to favor Clin­ton over Mr. President, because the Democrats favor pro-choice, I wish those papists would have enough courage to say so, instead of beating about the Bush. Then all of us could take a look to see if the Pope is really an enemy of the rights we haVIe as Americans to freely elect our leaders. , 
Our most trusted bishops aJ~ 
sure us that in this down-at the-heels country of ours, w are faced with many crises, i addition to abortion, whic must be conscientiously consid ered. 
But of course the zealots, keeping their anonymity whenever they're sailing something outrageous past us in The Observer, insist that as Catholics, we're limited to vot­ing for candidates favoring pro­life-but is the pro-life candidate always the lesser of two evils, simply because he's pro-life. 
As a Catholic, I'm not com­fortable in believing this is true. To be loyal to my Church, must I put my trust in Quayle and Bush? As Christians, maybe we're doomed to live with guilt. But why does so much of it have to come from narrow-minded Catholics trying to manipulate us into doing things their way? 
As Cardinal Newman said, when he was invited to join in a toast to the Pope! "Yes, indeed, to the Pope. But first, to con­science!" 
God has put the thought in my mind as a birthday consolation, that John Paul would have applauded Newman on that occasion putting his conscience first.

GAME NOTES 

One Good Pick 
Tom Carter anchors the Irish secondary 

By JENNY MARTEN 
Associate Sports Editor 
"Picks for everyone." 

So prophesied former Irish cornerback Todd Lyght in his senior season at Notre Dame to then-freshman cornerback Tom Carter and the rest of the newcomers to the Irish secondary. 
Carter, a junior who is in his second year as a starter, has gotten his share of "picks." Already this season, he has in­tercepted two passes from the Irish opponents bringing his Notre Dame career total to seven. He led the team in interceptions last year with five. 
Blessed with speed and athletic ability, Carter is well suited for stealing passes from would-be receivers. Irish secondary coach Ron Cooper has been impressed with the way Carter reacts on the field and plays the ball in the air. 
"He's very aware of what's going on. He has a good feel for the game," said Cooper. "He's sure about everything he does. He takes chances, but they are good chances." 
From his electric smile, it is obvious that Carter really enjoys playing football and more specifically, cornerback. Carter himself confessed that Saturday is his favorite day of the week. 
"It's a challenge when you're playing the top teams in the nation every week. I get psyched up every week. I love to play the passing teams. 
"You visualize it every Friday before a game. You think about all the routes that they run and that you've seen in practice and you see yourself trying to make the big play," said Carter with a grin. 
Carter's feel for the game has come from a significant amount of experience on the field over the last three years. He came to Notre Dame as one of the top incoming freshmen in the country and quickly found a niche in the Irish sec­ondary. . 
After starting six games at free safety in his freshman campaign, he moved into a more permanent role as one of the starting Irish cornerbacks last year and played more minutes than anyone else on the team. 
Carter himself admits that playing the nation's top teams for the last two years have given him an edge. 
"The playing experience was invaluable. I got the chance to go in and start six games (freshman year) so sophomore year I could go out and play, said Carter. 
"Two or three years at this level helps out a lot in being experienced and knowing how to read quarterbacks." 
His extensive playing time doesn't mean that Carter can forget about the little things that help make him one of the top defensive contributors on the team. 
"I have to work on the small things. Sometimes when you get old you forget about the little things like footwork, ag­gressiveness and catching the ball. You get lackadaisical because catching is not your job, but you have to know how to catch just as well as the receivers do and practice just as hard," said Carter. 
Cooper agrees that the experience has helped Carter feel at ease on the field and that he is a complete player with strong fundamentals and commitment. 
Some of the commitment was inspired by the example set by Lyght. 
"I saw him 'do things that I thought he'd never do like working in the weight room on his own. He taught me that all you do is self-motivated. What you accomplish is eighty percent you and only twenty percent the coaches," said Carter. 
Although the junior tends to be quiet off the field, Carter talks trash on the field usually starting with the very first play of the game. Although the amount of talking Carter does depends on the receiver, he confesses to enjoying the cocky banter. 
"It's a mind game. You're trying to intimidate the guy as long as you can concentrate on what you are doing. It's part of the Florida nature. I grew up playing like that. Guys just talk," said Carter. "It's a release for most of the guys." 
The Saint Petersburg native was recruited at several different positions coming out of high school. Clemson, Ne­braska and Kansas wanted him as a quarterback. Miami felt Carter had potential as a receiver. While Notre Dame and Florida State also saw that potential, both schools felt it would be more helpful on the defensive side of the field. 
Although he could have still chosen to play offense at Notre Dame, Carter felt that his skills would be best utilized on defense and chose the secondary as the best position for him. 
While he will continue to excel as he continues to play cornerback for the Irish, Carter's thoughts on the remainder 
The Observer/Kyle Kusek Tom Carter leads the Irish in interceptions. 

of the season are simple. 
"We all came together after this weekend (Stanford). We're just going to go out and have fun and play hard. I'd rather have the type of season we had last year than go undefeated and lose in a bowl." 

Irish cornerback Tom Carter lays a hit on Michigan State wide receiver Mill Coleman.

The Big East has more than hoops 


The Lambert Trophy, which is awarded annually to the top team in the East, used to be the goal of every college football team east of the Big Ten and north of the Southeastern Conference. 
This, however, was before Penn State's jump to the Big Ten and the formation of the Big East Football Conference. 
Though these changes were put in writing two years ago, their effects will not really be felt until next season, when Penn State begins Big Ten play and the Big East begins full conference play. 
The Big East, which is made up of eight, not ten schools like its basketball counterpart, was originally looked at as Miami and seven other teams. 
A lot of people complained that the Hurricanes schedule would be a cake walk each year. 
But now as the conference, which also includes Pittsburgh, Boston College, Syracuse and Rutgers, as well as Temple, West Virginia an!f Virginia Tech, readies to begin conference play, a lot of people are being

forced to reevaluate it. 
This week's Associated Press Top 25 includes three Big East teams-number-two Miami, 15th-ranked Syracuse and 21st­rated Boston College. And West Virginia is knocking on the door of the Top 25; at 3-0-2 the Mountaineers are the top team in the also receiving votes category. 
Though the other teams in the conference are not amongst the nation's elite, they almost all have solid programs in place. Pittsburgh has one of the nation's top offenses, and a tradition that includes names like Tony Dorsett, Dan Marino and Craig "Ironhead" Heyward. Virginia Tech is one of those teams which seems to pull off an upset on the national level almost every year. Most recently, the Hoakies topped Virginia in 1990, the year the Cavaliers spent some time on top of the polls.

QB still happy at Notre Dame 

By RICH KURZ 
Associate Sports Editor 
Last January, Irish quarter­back Rick Mirer held a press conference to announce that he would return to Notre Dame for his senior season, holding off the NFL to try for a national championship and go for the Heisman. 
After a sub-par performance last week in the 33-16 loss last week to Stanford, in which Mirer was only 13 for 38 pass­ing and missed some open re­ceivers, both of those goals ap­pear to be out of reach. But ac­cording to Mirer, he's still glad he came back for his final year of college. 
''I'm happy here," said Mirer. "I'm going to graduate this semester, work in the spring on getting better and doing things I need to do to for the next league. But right now I just want to win games, and I enjoy my time here, it's pretty much home to me. 
"I think there's a lot of good things we can do yet before this season's over, and we have seven more games, and it'll be interesting to see what happens. 
"The problem now is that ev­erybody's going to second guess (me), everybody thinks that I'm not happy now, that I feel like I've wasted my time. That's not the case. There's a lot of things that need to be done yet." 
At his press conference on Tuesday, Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz emphasized that the Irish planned to get back to basics, by which he meant running the ball. 
"When we throw the ball 28 to 30 times a game, that is not us," Holtz said. 
To a quarterback who is rated as a sure-fire first-round NFL pick, with a rocket arm, those words may not sound too reas­suring, especially if he wants to increase his status in the eyes of pro scouts. Despite the fact that the national championship, and probably the Heisman, are out of reach, Mirer is still concerned with winning games, not padding his statistics. 
"What ever works best is what we're going to go with," he said. "Twenty to twenty-five times (passing) is enough for him (Holtz). It's enough to win. That's great." 
In the past few years the Irish have had problems holding on to leads at home, and last Sat­urday's game was no different. Once again a team played catch-up and won. 
"It's a strange situation. We were at the point we were ready to go ahead 23-0, and it didn't work out, and we wind up not scoring again. It's frustrating 

The Observer/John Bingham

when that happens, but I think every team we've played and had that problem with has al­ways been a good team. We can't take anything away from what they did, they played great defense and scored when they needed to. 
"(Holtz) called me in after the game and he was disappointed and I was disappointed, but he just wanted to let me know that there's still a lot of things we can do, a lot of good things. People have days like the one I had and like the one our whole team had, and it's just part of life and you just have to put it behind you as fast as you can and go on to the next thing. 
"I don't know if he felt that I needed somebody to give me a little confidence, or what, but he reassured me that he's be­hind me regardless of what happened Saturday, and that there's things we need to do to improve our team on both sides of the ball, and we still have some big games left." 
Besides, as the old saying goes, every gray cloud has a silver lining, and maybe even a loss that drops the Irish out of national championship contention has some kind of benefit, one which should allow the team to perform even better. 
"I have a great time playing the game, and I think now maybe some of the pressure's off Notre Dame. I think we did get wrapped up in a lot of the hype for a few games, and now we'll just go out and play foot­ball and have fun doing it." 
But Notre Dame can't afford to hang its head too long, because they still have a number of games left to play, including one this weekend at Pittsburgh, a historically tough opponent for the Irish. 
"We need to regain our confi­dence, go out and play a good team and beat them," said Mirer. " We have a chance to do that this week. Our defense plays great when they need to, and hopefully this week our of­fense can help them. Last week we didn't do our job on offense." 
The Pitt Panthers have a po­tent offense, but their defense is simply horrible, ranked last in the Big East and in the bottom 15 nationally. However, the Irish have to worry about themselves first, said Mirer. 
"We're trying to get ourselves straight and then worry about their personnel. I know they've done a lot of different things on defense this year, trying to find one thing to go with, but they're always tough. 
"I think there's things they need to improve on, but the statistics don't always tell the story. It's a tough place to play and the environment's not great, and they'll fly around and hit you, I know that." 
The last time the Irish played in Pittsburgh, they toughed out a 31-22 win over the Panthers, sparked by Raghib Ismail's 116 rushing yards, including a 76­yard TD run. 
Mirer himself was only 5 of 16 passing, for 85 yards, with one interception, the first sub-par performance of his Irish career, although Coach Holtz was im­pressed with his grit in the game. But the now-senior quarterback isn't going to think back to that game. 
"What happened two years ago has nothing to do with what's going to happen Satur­day. There's different guys on the field, and I'm a different player now, I think. 
"My confidence isn't hurting, I think our pride may have been damaged a little bit, but we have confidence in ourselves. I expect we'll play good ball the upcoming games, play within ourselves, work together, and win games." 
After two tough losses in a row last season, at least the Irish have experience in how to handle the disappointment that comes from such a loss. They also know how to go on from this point, said Mirer. 
" Last year there were some down moments, but we finished up probably as happy as we could have, from the situation we were already in, and I think that can happen this year once again."

Olajuwon, Rockets owner trade bitter verbal blows 
HOUSTON (AP) -Hakeem Olajuwon and Houston Rockets owner Charlie Thomas shook hands Thursday and then traded verbal blows with Ola­juwon calling Thomas a coward and Thomas saying he wasn't trying to build a personal rela­tionship with his unhappy cen­ter. 
The feud has been simmering since last March when Olaju­won demanded an apology and a trade after he was suspended by general manager Steve Patterson for refusing to suit up after being given doctor's clearance to play. Olajuwon said he had a hamstring injury. 
"I don't expect any apology because you are not dealing with classy people here," Ola­juwon told a media day gather­ing. "Charlie has been a coward standing behind the orga­nization. So Steve Patterson is not even worth talking about." 
Olajuwon said he would report for workouts on Friday and play the best he could despite his unhappiness with the or­ganization. He at first sidestepped questions about his impasse with the Rockets. 
"There is an old saying in my country (Nigeria), 'Silence is the best answer for a fool,"' Olajuwon said. "I don't want to get down in the mud with this organization. Everything will come out." 
Thomas and Olajuwon shook hands when Olajuwon came onto The Summit floor to begin the interview sessions. Then they broke up into different in­terview groups and the fire­works started. 
"I'm not trying to build a per­sonal relationship here," Thomas said. "If he wants a personal relationship then it's up to him to come to me. You know who makes people happy? Themselves, people make themselves happy." 
The Rockets were involved in intensive offseason efforts to trade Olajuwon but all their deals fell through. Olajuwon was surprised that as a three­time All-NBA center, a deal couldn't be made. 
"They have been known for giving little and asking for too much," Olajuwon said. "If you are a businessman, can you believe there could not be a deal made for me?" 
Thomas said the Rockets made their best effort to trade Olajuwon and failed. Now it's up to each party to fulfill his contract. 
"He doesn't have to like Steve Patterson, that's really not im­portant," Thomas said. "We tried to trade him and couldn't. Now he has an obligation to fulfill his contract and we have an obligation to pay him." 
Olajuwon said last March he was angered because Patterson accused him of faking an injury as a ploy in his attempts to renegotiate his contract. Olaju­won denies the allegation. 
Thomas snapped at a reporter when asked about Patterson's statement. 
"I've looked everywhere and Steve did not say that Hakeem faked an injury, that's been in­ferred by others," Thomas said. "He merely reported what the doctors said." 

Rockets guard Kenny Smith season," Smith said. "I don't said Olajuwon's situation would think about it too much at this not be a problem during the stage." preseason. Coach Rudy Tomjanovich said 
"It's kind of a selfish time he was just happy to have Ola­when you are concentrating on juwon in a Roc~ets uniform. getting yourself ready for the "I had a talk with Hakeem during the summer and I have no doubt that when he gets on the court he will play his heart out," Tomjanovich said. "I told him I expected him to be a competitor and I don't expect any problems with that. 


EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -Several of Lawrence Taylor's teammates said Thursday they were taking lightly the 10-time Pro Bowl linebacker's announcement that he was retiring at the end of the season. 
"There comes a time when you have to say enough is enough," Taylor, 33, said Thursday after the New York Giants (1-3) finished practice for Sunday's game with the Phoenix Cardinals (1-3). "This is that time. I've had enough." 
As Taylor addressed a swarm of reporters near his locker, teammate Carl Banks went into the trainer's room and got on the loudspeaker. 
"Lawrence, this is your con­science talking," Banks said. "You're making a mistake. 
Don't let your mouth get you in trouble again. You've been so great for so long, don't leave. 
"With free agency you can get a two-year contract worth one­point-something million," Banks added. 
While the disclosure of his re­tirement plan was somewhat surprising, Taylor has talked about quitting for several years. Entering this season, the NFL's most dominant linebacker in history said he was 95 percent sure this would be his final year . 
"I've known for a long time," Taylor said. "I just didn't want to make an announcement. I've known since the season began, training camp began." 
Giants coach Ray Handley said he also felt this would be Taylor's last season and didn't try to talk him out of retiring. 
''I'm just sorry I knocked it off the back page," said Handley, whose run-in with a photogra­pher and the media on Wednesday was splashed on most of the area newspapers. 
However, some teammates wonder whether Taylor can live without football and the more than $1 million he earns from it annually. 
Ottis Anderson, who at 35 is the oldest running back in the NFL, said he didn't want to eu­logize Taylor too early. 
"If that's what he chooses to do," Anderson said. "But who's to say that he's going to do it? How many times has George Foreman said he's going to give it up. No, not George, not Larry Holmes. You never know." 
Banks also reserved comment until the end of the season. 
"Lawrence has good inten­tions but you can never tell," Banks said. "After the final game of the season, I'll have my farewells to him. Right now we have some games to win." 
Taylor said that physically he could play in 1993. But he said the Giants have changed so much that he feels like he is playing on a different team. 
"I'm not going to say I'm frustrated," Taylor said. "It's not a big deal. I've been frus­trated before. I was frustrated last year. I was frustrated when I was young. I was frustrated when we won the Super Bowl. This is not a big deal because 
L.T. is frustrated. We'll have to do the best we can, play to­gether and make it work out." 
Taylor is the NFL career leader in sacks with 123 1/2, but had a career-low seven last season. He has two sacks and 23 tackles this season. 
"I hear people talking about how Lawrence Taylor is losing a step," Cardinals coach Joe Bugel said Wednesday. "He looks faster now than he has ever looked." 
Defensive end Leonard Mar­shall, who has played in front of Taylor for the past 10 years, refused to second-guess Taylor. 
"Once you make up your mind it's time, it's time," Marshall said. "Obviously he has made up his mind that it's time to go." 
PITTSBURGH (AP) -Mario Lemieux scored twice in the third period and his 24th career five-point game helped the Pittsburgh Penguins to their first victory of the season Thursday night, 7-3 over the New York Islanders. 
The Penguins, who started the evening with a ceremony raising last season's Stanley Cup championship banner, were tied 3-3 after two periods. 
Jarornir Jagr broke the tie at 2:20, slipping behind defense­men Darius Kasparaitis and Torn Kurvers and beating Mark Fitzpatrick. 
Lemieux got his first at 8:38, picking up a loose puck behind the net, circling and scoring on a wraparound. Lemieux scored again at 11:44, using Kevin Stevens as a decoy on a 2-on-1 break and shooting the puck over Fitzpatrick's glove. 
Lemieux has three goals and seven points this season. 
Nordiques 5, Sabres 4 
BUFFALO, N.Y. -Mike Ricci, obtained in the trade with Philadelphia for Eric Lindros, snapped a 4-4 tie in the third period. Ricci, who had 20 goals last year with the Flyers, was left alone in front and took a pass from Bill Lindsay before beating goalie Dominik Hasek at 11:19. 
Alexander Mogilny's third goal of the night, on a power play, had tied it for the Sabres. It was Mogilny's third career hat trick. 
Joe Sakic had two goals for Quebec, and the Nordiques got single goals from Mats Sundin and Steve Duchesne, another of the six players the Nordiques received for Lindros. 
Pat LaFontaine got Buffalo's other goal and assisted on all three of Mogilny's goals. Dave Andreychuk also had three as­sists for the Sabres. 
Bruins 3, Whalers 2 (OT) 

BOSTON -Joe Juneau scored midway through overtime, wiping out a magnificent per­formance by Hartford goalie Sean Burke. 
Juneau flicked a shot over the left glove of Burke, who ap­peared to have been partially screened by Dmitri Kvartalnov. 
Murray Craven scored two power-play goals in the third period and Burke made several spectacular saves as the Whalers rallied to tie it in Boston's season opener. Hart­ford lost to Montreal on Tues­day. 
Senators 5, Canadiens 3 

OTTAWA -The Ottawa Sena­tors made it 2-for-2 for the NHL's expansion teams. 
Doug Smail scored a pair of goals, the last into an empty net, as the Senators rocked the Montreal Canadiens in Ottawa's first regular-season NHL game in 58 years. 
The draining marathon that took over three hours continued a new era of expansion for the NHL. The Senators' expansion brethren, the Tampa Bay Lightning, entered the league on a winning note, beating Chicago 7-3 on Wednesday night. 
AP File Photo Kevin Stevens, celebrating after a goal last night, supported Mario Lemieux in Pittsburgh's 7-3 win. 
The Civic Centre shook like it was a Stanley Cup victory as the final seconds ticked down with Ottawa clinging to a 4-3 lead. Smail, who scored Ottawa's second goal of the evening, put the issue to rest with an ernpty­netter with just 15 seconds remaining. 
Neil Brady, Ken Hammond and Sylvain Turgeon also scored for Ottawa, while Mike Keane, Vincent Darnphousse and Brian Bellows replied for the Canadiens. 
White looks to convince Heisman voters 
SEATTLE (AP) -California tailback Russell White hopes to make Reisman Trophy voters reach for their erasers if they already have Marshall Faulk's name penciled in on their ballots. 
White believes all he needs is an outstanding effort in a Cal victory over the top-ranked Washington Huskies Saturday. 
"I don't want to take any cheap shots at Marshall Faulk because he is an exceptional player," White said. "But, basically, it boils down to who you're playing against." 
White and the No. 24 Golden Bears are 12-point underdogs one of the nation's premier defenses. Washington's defense intercepted three passes and recovered two fumbles in a 17­10 victory over No. 20 Southern California last Saturday. 
"If you play well against the No. 1 team in the country, it has to say something," White said. "But if you do bad, it says something, too." 
There was speculation that White, a senior, might jump to the NFL after his junior season, but he elected to stay in college and get his bachelor's degree in social welfare. 
"The money is going to be 

there," he said. "Nothing is going to happen to the NFL. It'll still be there." 
After four games, White ranks second in the Pac-1 0 in rushing to Mario Bates of Arizona State with an average of 130.8 yards per game. 
Faulk is averaging 209 yards per game. 
White's uncle, Charles, won his Reisman at Southern California. White has developed an affinity for the trophy. 
"I've touched it, I've rubbed it, I've taken pictures with it," he said. "I've done everything with it. But it wasn't mine." 
North Stars 5, Blues 2 
BLOOMINGTON, Minn.-Russ Courtnall and Gaetan Duchesne scored short-handed goals 17 seconds apart in the second period. 
Jon Casey made 31 saves as the Stars held Brett Hull, who had scored nine goals in his last nine games against them, scoreless on four shots. Tommy Sjodin, Mike Craig and Mike Modano also scored for the Stars. 
The loss snapped the Blues' five-game unbeaten streak against the Stars, who scored nine short-handed goals all of last season. St. Louis, which beat Minnesota 6-4 in the sea­son opener Tuesday night in St. Louis, got goals from Nelson Emerson and Jeff Brown.

Jordan appears at·Bulls' camp 

DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -The anxietey is over. Michael Jordan is back. 
Jordan, who had given indica­tions that he might not report for the start of the Chicago Bulls' training camp, was on hand Thursday night. 
Jordan said he will participate in training camp on a limited basis. 
Jordan took the blame for the rumor that he might not report on time for camp as the Bulls aim for a third-straight NBA ti­tle. 
"When I was in Barcelona, I ran into some guys and told them I didn't know if I was go­ing to be here," said Jordan, who along with teammate Scottie Pippen played on the 
U.S. Olympic gold medal team. 
But Jordan said he and coach Phil Jackson met and came to a compromise on the training camp procedure. 
"Phil understood me from the 
Hornets not close to signing Mourning 
CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) ­Negotiations between the Charlotte Hornets and the agent for Alonzo Mourning have soured over what officials say is improper interference in the team's affairs. 
Although the sides are re­portedly about $200,000 apart, team owner George Shinn and president Spencer Stolpen made it clear Thursday that
• 
David Falk, Mourning's repre­sentative, had tried to dictate personnel moves to help get more money for his client. 
Specifically, team officials claimed Falk had suggested trading some players for draft picks as a means of giving the Hornets more money under the NBA salary cap. 
"Obviously, he feels that his opinion on how we develop our franchise is more important than the people we pay to de­velop our franchise," Stolpen said. "We have a fair offer on the table, and we're not going to change our plans of develop­ing our team to play a game with him. It's as simple as that." 
That current offer is $2.1 mil­lion in the initial year, accord­ing to the team. However, that figure may be altered following the signing of No. 2 draft choice, guard Tony Bennett of Wisconsin-Green Bay. Although the team would not discuss terms of the deal, it's expected that Bennett's contract would take money away from Mourning's offer, possibly dropping the new offer to $1.9 million. Bennett was expected to sign his contract in time to attend Thursday night's team meeting. 
Stolpen also said that Falk had characterized the current offer to the former Georgetown center as fair but unacceptable. 
Falk was not immediately available for comment Thursday afternoon. 
For the second straight sea­son, the Hornets are in a dis­pute over their No. 1 draft pick. Last season, Larry Johnson didn't come to terms until opening day, and played that night against the Boston Celtics. 
In attempting to sign Mourning, a shot blocker and rebounder that the Hornets have been looking for since they entered the league, four current team members had their contracts readjusted to release more money. Mike Gminski, Muggsy Bogues, Dell Curry and 
J.R. Reid each are having money deferred in order to ~elp_ the club bring Mourning to terms. 
Stolpen said he is aware of the risk involved with failing to sign Mourning, the second player chosen in the NBA draft last June. He is considered the final ingredient necessary for the Hornets to make the playoffs as they embark on their fifth sea­son. 
"We don't have deadlines. We understand our options, and we will exercise our options, and we will exercise the options that we deem appropriate at the appropriate time," Stolpen said. 
He also said his offer to Mourning would not be altered regardless of what the Minnesota Timberwolves do to sign No. 3 pick Christian Laettner of Duke. 
Johnson said if Mourning comes in late, he will get the benefit of players who would be ready to teach him coach Allan Bristow's system. Last season, the entire team had to get used to the system. 
"I think he'll adjust better and more quickly .than I did," Johnson said. "Now, everybody knows how to talk to Alonzo and knows what to tell Alonzo what to expect."

mental standpoint," said Jordan. 
Jackson said there would be several players that will partici­pate on a limited basis during the opening week of practice. That includes Jordan and Pippen because of participation in the Olympics and John Paxson and Bill Cartwright be­cause both had knee surgery. 
"Michael and I met and we agreed that due to his extenuat­ing time committments there are some obligations he needs to fulfill," said Jackson. "He will be fulfilling the obligations next week and then will rejoin the team. Barring any unforseen circumstances, we expect that all of our players will play in exhibition games." 
Jordan said he would return to the team Oct. 15 and that he would play in the exhibition games. 
Jordan said he has had some time to relax but "not as much as I'd like. The next couple of days will be crucial for me mentally." 
Jordan said the Bulls would have no problem being fired up for a third title. 
"It won't be hard; we'll be ready to challenge," said Jordan. "We shouldn't take the attitude that we will defend our championship. We have to be aggressive to win a third. It hasn't been done in 26 years, so that's enough to drive you." 
Pippen said he welcomed the timetable programmed by Jackson. 
"I feel great about it. Phil is very understanding," said Pippen. "It's been a tough summer. I feel fine but mentally I'm not sure if my body will give out. Yes, we want to win a third championship."

Toronto takes game two, 3-1 
Series moves to Oakland deadlocked at one 
TORONTO (AP) -Now everyone knows why the Toronto Blue Jays wanted David Cone so much this season, and why everybody else will want him even more next year. 
Cone, acquired cheaply from the New York Mets in late August, paid off in a big way Thursday night. He shut down Oakland for eight innings, and pitched the Blue Jays to a 3-1 victory that evened the AL playoffs at one game each. 
Cone put aside thoughts about filing for free agency after the World Series, and instead put the Blue Jays one game closer to making it that far. 
"Naturally, you think about being_ called a hired gun, and where you're going to be next year," he said, "but you try to throw all of that out of your mind. 
"Free agency will take care of itself. Right now, I have a chance to be on a team that will go all the way," he said. "There were a lot of free agents on both sides of the field tonight. There's really a 'live for now attitude.' That makes it easier for all of us." 
Kelly Gruber's two-run homer off Mike Moore in the fifth inning broke open a scoreless game. It also provided the latest bang in a series of bruising blows -all but three of the 11 runs so far have scored on homers. 
Cone stopped Oakland's

seven-game winning streak in the playoffs and also ended a slump of six straight playoff losses at the SkyDome for Toronto. 
"We saw a lot of funny-looking swings from our guys that you don't normally see," A's manager Tony La Russa said. "He was outstanding." 
The series now shifts to Oakland, where Juan Guzman will start for Toronto against another ex-Met, Ron Darling, on Saturday afternoon. 
Cone was coveted by nearly every contender in the stretch The Mets, however, said they would not trade him. But when Toronto offered Jeff Kent and minor leaguer Ryan Thompson, two players the Mets really wanted, they said yes on Aug. 27. 
The next day, A's general manager Sandy Alderson expressed anger, saying he would have avidly pursued Cone if he had known he was available. 
Only once had Cone ever faced the A's, back in 1986 when he was an up-and-coming reliever with Kansas City, and that was only for five batters. Cone clearly benefited from Oakland's lack of familiarity, and befuddled its hitters. 
"It works both ways. They haven't seen me and I haven't seen them," Cone said. "I think it was kind of a wash." 
Rickey Henderson, Carney Lansford and Ruben Sierra, the top three batters in Oakland's lineup, were a combined 0 for 10 until Sierra tripled to start the ninth. The same three hitters also went 0 for 10 on Wednesday night against Jack 
Morris. 

Sierra's triple finished Cone, who appeared upset at being relieved. Harold Baines, who won the opener with a ninth­inning homer, singled off reliever Tom Henke. 
Mark McGwire, another home ruri hero in Game 1, followed with a long fly ball that curved foul in left and silenced the crowd for just a minute. Henke got the last two batters for the save, and Cone led the Blue Jays' rush onto the field to congratulate him. 
"I knew he didn't hit it that well," Henke said of McGwire. "He didn't get the big part of the bat on the ball. I knew if it didn't go foul it would be caught." 
Henderson, the MVP of the 1989 playoffs, was especially confused. He ducked away from a curve for a called strike on the first pitch of the game, swung and missed at the second pitch and then struck out with a weak, half-swing on a nasty outside slider.

Braves prepare for game three 
Wakefield's knuckler gets special attention 
PITTSBURGH (AP) --With a 2-0 lead in the NL playoffs, the Atlanta Braves aren't worried about butterflies in their stom­achs. Instead, they're con­cerned with the pitch that flut­ters. 
Tim Wakefield, Pittsburgh's rookie knuckleballer, was scheduled to pitch against Tom Glavine on Friday night in Game 3, and the knuckler seemed to be on everyone's minds as the Braves worked out in Three Rivers Stadium late Thursday. 
"If his knuckleball is on, it will be tough for us to do anything," David Justice said. "You just hope he doesn't have his best knuckleball." 
To help the Braves adjust, At­lanta general manager John Schuerholz summoned 50-year­old Bruce Dal Canton to throw batting practice. Dal Canton, the pitching coach for the Braves' Richmond farm team, threw the knuckler for the final four seasons of his 11-year ca­reer, which ended in 1977. He was 51-49 overall, 13-26 with the knuckler. 
"I just threw it to the catcher's face mask," Dal Canton said. "I didn't know if it would go down and in, down and out." 
Atlanta's players found batting practice with Dal Canton an uplifting -and occasionally bruising-experience. 
"Whoa! That almost hit me!" yelled Terry Pendleton, sixth in the NL with a .311 average. He swung at a pitch he thought would be over the plate, but the ball curled inside. 
"That's nasty!" Justice screamed to Dal Canton. "We got a uniform for you!" 
Atlanta players were uniform in telling themselves to relax against Wakefield. The rookie pitched against Atlanta on Aug. 16, scattering seven hits in a 4­2 complete-game victory. Otis Nixon and Pendleton had two hits each. 
"The thing about his knuck­leball is it throws the timing off," Ron Gant said. "We're going to have to make a little adjustment, wait longer on his pitches." 
Dal Canton was home in Carnegie, Pa., when Schuerholz called him earlier this week. 
"I said, 'Sure. It should be fun,"' Dal Canton recalled. "I live only about 15 mi.nutes from here. I was surprised they asked me. This is a first for me, throwing just knuckleballs in batting practice. I've never had this much publicity." 
With Wakefield (8-1, 2.15 ERA) pitching, Braves batters don't have to worry about him guessing their weaknesses. With knuckballers, there is no conventional wisdom. 
"The advance scouts say the knuckleballer is pure delight, because they don't have to work all night," Pirates man­ager Jim Leyland said. 
While players on both teams joked, Justice said the Braves were serious about maintaining their intensity against Pitts­burgh. 
"They're a good team. They showed it all year long," he said. ''I'm sure they'll be ready. They'll have their fans behind them the way we had our fans in Atlanta." 
The Pirates feel pressure to win. The Braves just want to get back to where they were last season: one run from win­ning the World Series. 
"Last year it was the first time for everyone," Justice said. "With each step, everything was something new, something good. No one expected us to win the World Series. We're happy with winning the West­ern Division. We'll be happier winning the NL Championship Series. But our goal, like every team's goal in spring training, was winning the World Series." 
Reunion of 1980 national team enabled by Golden Dome Invitational tourney 
By DANIEL PIER Sports Writer 
A reunion of sorts will take place at Notre Dame's Joyce ACC this weekend. Debbie Brown, Debbie Green, and Sue Woodstra, all members of the 1980 United States national volleyball team, will convene for the Golden Dome Invita­tional. This time, though, the former standouts will pace the sidelines while quite a lot of current standouts show their wares on the court. 
Brown is the head coach of 25th-ranked Notre Dame. while Green assists for number three Long Beach State and Woodstra pulls the strings for Pittsburgh. Florida State will round out the 
-field in the toughest
.. 
tournament Notre Dame has entered this year. 
The fact that the three coaches have remained friends over the years won't make the competition any less fierce. Brown looks forward to several exciting matches. 
"The (national) team was close, and we've kept in touch," Brown says of her former teammates. "It will be neat to have a chance to compete against them, especially since this will be a very competitive tournament. Pittsburgh and Florida State have strong teams, and it's obviously a great opportunity to play against number three." 
Notre Dame faces Florida State (11-3) at 8:00 p.m. Friday night. Pittsburgh (7-6) awaits at 
1:00 p.m. Saturday, followed by Long Beach State (9-1) at 8:00 p.m. 
Florida State is off to a strong start, led by outside hitter and kill leader Luiza Ramos. The Seminoles, though not ranked, received votes in the national coaches' poll and are ranked in the NCAA South region. 
Pittsburgh is ranked thir­teenth in the NCAA Midwest region poll, where Notre Dame holds down the fourth spot. The

Panthers' outstanding player is outside hitter Ann Marie Lucanie, from Ontario, who could play on the Canadian National team in 1996. 
Long Beach State rolls in from the West coast with a nine­game winning streak after losing their first match to then fourth-ranked Stanford. The 49ers' roster features two 1991 All-Americans, setter' Sabrina Hernandez and middle blocker Danielle Scott. Brown believes Scott has an excellent chance to play for the 1996 U.S. national team. It seems the Irish have their work cut out for them, but Brown relishes the opportunity. 
"We're in a no-lose situation," Brown said. "Realistically, we're not expecting to beat Long Beach, but it can happen. We are certainly capable of it." 
Tammy Liley, a veteran of the 1988 and 1992 Olympics, adds another name to the list of former and possible future na­tional team players to take part in this weekend's festivities. Liley will hold a clinic in the JACC Pit at 6:00 Friday night.

Match Point 
What you should know about the world of sports 
In the confusing world of sports, there are still some things you just know. 
•The 
Pittsburgh Pirates should work out a deal that would allow Barry Bonds to play only from April through September, because he is more of a li­ability than an asset in October. After going 1 for 6 in the first two games of the National League Championship Series, his career postseason batting average is hovering around the anemic . 150 mark. While his play during the regular season has positioned him among the best in the game, he has done little worthy of praise in three postseason appearances. For Bonds, MVP stands for Most Variable Player. 

•Because 
of the pointless Bowl Coali­tion, Notre Dame has to win only seven games to qualify for a major bowl game. Regardless of their final record, however, membership in the Coalition restricts the Irish from playing in any post-season games other than the Fi­esta Bowl, the Orange Bowl, the Cotton Bowl or the Sugar Bowl. And I was really looking forward to a trip to Memphis for the Liberty Bowl. 

•How 
pointless is the Bowl Coalition? The only two major conferences not in­volved are the Big Ten and the Pac-10, which send their champions to the Rose Bowl. Washington will likely stroll through their Pac-10 schedule, as will Michigan in the Big Ten, setting up a national championship matchup in Pasadena, many miles from the Bowl Coalition. Kind of ironic. 

•Something 
tells me Mike Ditka's son is never late for his curfew. 

•With 
baseball's regular season fi­nally over, we can rest easily knowing that we no longer have to watch SportsCenter clips of a Los Angeles Dodgers' infielder throwing the ball into the upper deck. The result of L.A.'s astronomical number of miscues was a last-place finish in the National League West. The last time the Dodgers finished last anywhere was in 1904. Wasn't that Tommy Lasorda's first season as manager? 

•After 
leading the Chicago Bulls to two consecutive NBA titles and the U.S. Olympic team to the gold medal, Michael Jordan has indicated that he will sit out training camp and the exhi­bition season to rest his weary bones before the regular season begins next month. The Bulls don't need that kind of aggravation; they should just trade him. Kiki Vandeweghe is available. 

•
Penn State 20, Miami 17. The Hur­ricanes will blow a last-second field goal for a change. 

•
Because of infractions that Syracuse University needed 1700 pages to ex­plain, the NCAA put the Orangemen basketball program on probation for two years, including a ban from post­season play this year. As if recruiting wasn't tough enough before, think how much it will cost boosters to "urge" the top high school products to choose Syracuse now.

The Notre Dame men's soccer team will face another tough challenge when it travels to Evansville on Sunday. 
The Aces are perennially one of the nation's best teams, and this year is no exception. 
Featuring an explosive offense and one of the best goalkeepers in the nation in Dave Herrington, Evansville will pose one of the toughest tests of the season for the young Irish. 
"They have the same type of team they've had in the past," Notre Dame coach Mike Berticelli said. "They are a little less experienced than they have been in recent years, but they are still a very good team." 
Notre Dame can relate to inexperience. 
Six sophomores and three freshmen start for the Irish, now 6-4-1 overall and 3-1 in the Midwestern Collegiate Conference . 
Freshman Bill Lanza leads the team with five goals this season, including a hat trick last week against Dayton. 
Some problems came along with that youth early in the season, but things are beginning to change for the Irish. 
"We've been working hard, and things are staring to come together," Berticelli said. ''I'm pleased with the improvements we have made." 
They still have some strides to make, however, and Sunday's game will provide a good measuring stick. 
One problem the Irish have had this season is converting their scoring opportunities and that will become especially important this weekend. 
"We have to work hard at converting our chances," Berticelli said. "We won't get as many opportunities as we have in some other games, so we will have to take advantage of the ones we get." 
Defensively, the Irish will have to contain a group of young, but talented Evansville players. 
"They have some very crafty, dangerous young players," Berticelli said. "We will have to defend well to have a chance to win the game." 
Wins and losses aren't Berticelli's main

concern at this point in the season, however. He is concerned with the im­provement of the Irish has they prepare for the MCC tournament. 
Notre Dame's Alicia Turner (lett) and Nicole Coates look to dig against Ball State. The Irish host the Golden Dome Invitational this weekend. See story page 26. 
"My main concern is that we will peak at the end of the season," Berticelli said, "and I think were working well toward that." 
Bearcats attack Irish at Alumni 
By GEORGE DOHRMANN 
Sports Writer 

A streaking Cincinnati squad visits Alumni Field tonight to take on the 15th-ranked Notre Dame women's soccer team. 
The Irish are coming off a easy win over Loyola last Wednesday which raised their record to 6-4-1. Seven different players scored and the Ramblers were held to only one shot on goal. All but one of the players on the Notre Dame roster got playing time, giving the starters a much needed rest. 
Notre Dame will need to be rested to top the 22nd-ranked Bearcats. The Irish cruised to a 4-0 win in 1991, but Cincinnati has proven it is vastly improved from last year. 
"Cincinnati is a hot team right now," said Irish coach Chris Petrucelli. "They played well against Duke and have won some big games as of late." 
Against the Blue Devils, Cincinnati played right with the nation's 14th­ranked team but fell 2-1, an identical score that the Irish fell by on September 25. 
The Bearcats are not known for their offensive output, but play solid defensively. The only potent offensive threat for Cincinnati is junior Jessica Andrews. The forward scored three goals in 1991, the most by a returning player. 
Defensively, the Bearcats will look to play a more physical game to counter Notre Dame's speed on the front line and in the midfield. 
The Irish will hope to repeat last
