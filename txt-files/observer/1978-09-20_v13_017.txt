McKenna announces plan at HPC to extend student voice on policy 
by Kevin Ricbanlson Staff Reporter 
Student Body President Andy McKenna announced his "plan for action" regarding increased stu­dent voice in University policv at the Hall Presidents Council (HPC) meeting held last night in Walsh Hall. 
"We want to enhance student input in the· formulation and execu­tion of regulations which govern our lives by strengthening the power~ of the Campus Life Council (CLC)," he stated. 
McKenna's plan calls .for a strengthening of the CLC, which, according to the plan, "shall have, at the absolute minimum, the powers to pass proposals which review, amend and rescind all University regulations, particularly those concerning hall life, and initiate and review actions in all areas of Student Affairs." 
The plan states that the Vice-President for Student Affairs must act upon such proposals or veto them. In the event of a veto, he must return to the CLC stating the reasons for his decision. This decision may then be appealed to the Provost and, if necessary, to the President of the University. 
"This plan consists of reasonable and constructive actions which are geared to achieve maximum stu­dent support on Oct. 13, the day of the Board of Trustee meeting," McKenna said. 
There are four main events which will be held to garner support for the plan, according to McKenna. The first of these will be a series of articles and columns geared at educating students and stimulating their interest in the history and current status of stu­dent rights and alcohol regulations. 
"We will also conduct a hall-to­hall campaign where the Student Body Vice-President, Judicial Coo­dinator and I will go door to door in each of the dorms with the respec­tive hall president to discuss with students our solution to the current problems and the ways in which they can help," McKenna said. 

A Student Rights Forum will be held on ·Sept. 28 in Washington Hall with students, Fr. John Van Wolvlear, vice-president for Stu­dent Affairs, Dean of Students James Roemer, and University General Counsel Philip Faccenda. 
"This event wiij. give students a unique opportunity to have direct communication with administrators on the topics of student rights and alcohol regulation," McKenna said. 
"Our last activity will be to set the proposal in petition form and solicit 5,000 student signatures through and HPC petition drive,' McKenna stated. 
McKenna hopes the combination of the four events will maintain student enthusiasm for the plan. "We have a well-thought out plan designed to keep us from peaking too early," he said.

Nicaraguan troops besiege Esteli to dislodge rebels 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua [AP] ­Rebels barricaded streets in Esteli yesterday as government troops circled the city in an attempt to smash the last guerrilla stronghold in the violent uprising against President Anastasio Somoza. 
The rebels, reinforced by com­panions from the government­captured towns of Leon and Chinandenga, were reported in 1..'ontrol of Esteli, but their froce was not known. ~ 
Residents and reporters leaving town said sandbag and cobblestone barricades chest high stretched across many streets. 
The Sandinista guerrillas appeared to be better organized than those in any of the other cities. 
The national guard, Nicaragua's 7,500-man army, straddled the Pan American highway leading into the city, strafed rebel positions from the air and appeared ready to send in ground forces. Troops were airlifted to the north of the city, 

. . trying to tighten the noose around 
the city. The guerrillas, estimated to number anywhere from 400 to 2,000. were joined by hundreds of sympathizers and got control of the major cities of Matagalpa, Masaya, Leon and Chinandenga, but the rebels were outgunned and forced to flee. The Red Cross has estimated that 300 were killed and 3,000 wounded in Leon and 200 killed in Masaya. There has been no reliable report or estimate of guard casualties. 
Southern Nicaragua is in gov­ernment hands and Managua re­mains guarded while Somoza's troops search all vehicles entering or leaving the city. A strict curfew from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. is in effect with the guard ordered to shoot on sight. 
Even though Esteli appears to be the last rebel stronghold, sources in Managua warned against con­sidering the rebellion over.

Soma and McTaggart outline United Way campaign at HPC 
by Dan Letcher 

At the Hall President's Council "(HPC) meeting last night in Walsh 
Hall, United Way chairman Tom 
Soma announced that this year's 
drive would take place from Oct. 1 
through Oct. 5. Soma and Brother 
Joe McTaggert outlined the cam­
paign and asked the HPC for their 
support and assistance in the 
annual drive. 
Pointing to last year's drive as a 
''framework for responsibility,' 
McTaggert would like to see last 
year's drive emulated in many 
ways. One example of this would 
be to again approach every student 
one on one. 
"We,speak of being the number 
one student body and through this 
drive we can show that that 
accolade extends beyond athletics 
by responding to the poor and 
disenfranchised of South Bend," 
McTaggert said. 
Soma then addressed the presi­
dents, outlining this year's 
approach. Hall vice presidents will 
direct each dorm's drive. The goal 
for Notre Dame is a contribution of 
one dollar per student. 
"Last year the drive had a 
participation rate of nearly 70 per 
cent. This year we would like to 
reach our goal of 100 per cent 
participation,'' Soma stated, add­
ing that all monies collected are 
used locally. He concluded that he 
hoped this year's drive will be the 
most successful ever. 
Student Body President Andy 
McKenna spoke to the HPC con­
cerning the student rights. proposal 
which is to be presented before the 
Board of Trustees on October 13. 
McKenna presented a detailed 
plan of action which would be 
followed in the upcoming weeks. _ 
Joe Guckert, Homecoming chair­
man, announced that this year a 
homecoming king and queen would 
be chosen. Each hall will elect a 
candidate for the final contest and 
judges will pick the winners accord­
ing to criteria to be released later in the week. 
Homecoming activities will take place the week of Oct. 14. The theme of this year's hall decorating contest is "Jungle Safari." 
In other business, the HPC selected members for the Budget Committee, which votes on hall money allocations. Members were also elected to the Standard Review Board which evaluates and advises the HPC and to the Round Table Committee which ser\'es as a forum for section leaders 
HPC chairman Chuck DelGrande announced that Dean Roemer would speak to the HPC next Tuesday night at 6:45p.m. in Zahm hall. Topics to be discussed are social space, party policies, "In Loco Parentis" and common rooms.

Begin's party support low\ 
JERUSALEM -Prime Minister Menachem Begin appears to have solid support in Parliament for the agreements he signed with President Anwar Sadat of Egypt but reportedly he is in so much trouble with his own party that he could be forced to resign. Two of Begin's 18 Cabinet ministers are likelytto quit if the two documents negotiated at the Camp David Middle East summit are ratified by the Knesset, or parliament. However, even if Begin were to quit as head of the right-of-center Herut Party, the arithmetic of annnounced support by other parties virtually assures backing of the accords by the 120-member chamber.

Smith's entry questionable , 
WASHINGTON -The State Department said yesterday it has not decided whether to allow Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith to visit the United States on a private mission to promote his government's cause. Officials said they understood Smith and three associates have accepted an invitation from Sen. S. I. Hayakawa, R-Calif., to meet with U.S. political leaders and supporters. But department spokesman Hodding Carter said not decision on granting entry to the four will be made until after their application is received. 
Gas compromise still alive 
WASHINGTON -The Senate today refused to kill a natural gas pricing compromise supported by President Jimmy Carter as a critical section of his energy plan. But opponents said the fight was far from over. By a vote of 59-39, the Senate declined to send the multi-billion dollar compromise back to a House-Senate conference committee for redrafting, a move that supporters said would kill it.

Professor Mahajlo Mihajlov, a Yugoslav dissident, spoke to an 
udience of over 100 people in the ibrary Auditorium last night con­erning his struggle for human "ghtsin Yugoslavia. Mihajlov also iscusscd his attempts to achieve eedom of press, a freedom he seeks in order "to speak out fully, 
o tell the Yugoslav people about his spiritual experiences and thoughts." 
Mihajlov stated that even though Yugoslavia is "the most liberal country in the Communist world," its one-party political system prevents any human rights. "Laws in a one-party system are meaningless," he told the audi­ence. 
Most of the controversy sur­rounding Mihajlov stems not from what he wishes to print, but from his refusal to submit to government censorship. Mihajlov was imprisoned in 1966 for attempting to organize· an independent newspaper, which the government considered a "subver­sive underground organization.'' 
He has since been tried and 
convicted for writing articles which 
appeared in foreign papers. 
Mihajlov spoke at length con­cerning his concept of a "religious renaissance." He does not think that all the problems of his country can be solved by military triumph over Communism. But, he added, individual struggle and victory are possible throught the "safeguard­ing of spiritual freedom." 
The "mighty totalitarian pres­
sure of the external world" controls 
some people, but Mihajlov believes 
that ·if one renounces everything

by Neal Patterson he feels "a joy ... God." 

He also emphasized that a "concept of social awareness" is important both for the individual andl a government. Mihajlov suggested that the "laws of the cosmos do not depend on us, but we must acknowledge them." If we do not, he explained, we feel loneliness, and impose it on others. Mihajlov stated that govern­that of the United 
States, should realize that a coun­try's independence does not insu freedom for the citizens. Yugosla­via is an independent country, Mihajlov noted, but freedom i impaired by the Yugoslav govern­
ment. 
. The lecture was co-sponsored by the Student Union Academic Commission, the Center for Civil Rights, and the Institute of Interna­tional Studies.

Saint Mary's ·to issue fines for rule violations 
by Anne Hesslau 

Saint Mary's policy of issuing fines for violations of housing, safety, or security rules is being strictly and consistently enforced this year, according to Sr. Karol Jackowski, director of Residence Life. 
Fines imposed on students for violations range from $5 for a lost key to $50 for painting a room without a permit. 
"The monetary sanction is the most effective and sens-ible way of dealing with such violations," Jackowski stated. 
An offending student is issued a housing/safety ticket signed by her residence director stating the viola­tion and the amount of the fine. The fine is paid to the Business Office which transfers the money to either finance the repairs of the damages or to a special fund. 
The Hall Improvement Fund takes suggestions from students and R.A. 'sand with a five member senior board decides how the money will be spent. Ideas

Two safety violations punishable by $25 fines this year include sunbathing and/or walking on roofs, as well as not vacating a building during a fire drill. Jackowski noted that some students were fined for being on dormitory roofs during the recent panty raid. 
Jackowski stressed the import­ance of adhering to regulations regarding fire drill procedure ina accordance with the College's insurance policy. 
"We have to be able to assure the fire department that we've done as much as we can," Jackowski added, "That way, in the event of a real fire we can account for all of the students." 
Violations are not kept on the student's permanent record but the Business Office does maintain a file on payments. Repeated violations may result in the student losing her campus housing. 

Due to the recent unseasonally high temperatures, these students moved outdoors in the shade, finding temporary relief from the sweltering heat of O'Shaughnessy Hall. [Photo by Mark Muench]

Film fest urges awareneSs 
by Ruth Kolcun 
The Third World Film Festival opened Monday night with "Black and White In Color," the first of a 
series of ftlms on Africa. The festival, which will continue through November with showings . Am . and 
of fil ms on Latin encan 
· m· · be" ponsored
Astan coun es, ts mg s 
by the Notre Dame student govern­ment and the Center for Experien­tial Learning. 
According to Tom Ludlow, pro­motional director for the film series, the festival was undertaken to create a better understanding of international human relations. Another aim of the series is to help participants gain empathy for these developing countries through knowledge of their situations. 
"The third world countries are the poorer countries of the world which suffer intense population pressures and have not yet indus­trialized," Peter Walshe, associate professor of government and inter­national studies, commented. 
First world countries are the United States, Japan and the nations of Europe. Second world countries are the industrialized Communist countries. 

"This year we have collaborated with student government in an awareness of the third world pro­
blems," Fr. Don McNeill, director 
& •
of the Center .or Expenmenta1 Learning, stated. "The films lead into next semes­ter talks between student govern­ment and campus leaders," Lud­low explained. Other year-long activities related to the third world festival include workshops, hall projects, and a conference in March with student government cabinet members, hall officers, class officers, faculty and administration. There will also be a mass celebrated by Fr. Theodore Hesburge, University president. Hesburgh made a personal con­tributrion to the Third World Festival, according to literature promoting the films. In addition, financial support was also provided by the College of Business Admini­
stration, the physics department, the theology department, and the priests and brothers of Corby Hall. 
"Because the films are free, shown at various times, and pre­sent a variety of perspectives, students are encouraged to attend and raise questions,'' McNeill said. 
"Black and White In Color" won the Oscar for "Best Foreign Film of 1977." Two documentaries on Africa; "Nuer" and "The Last Grave ag Dimbaza," will be shown Sunday and Monday in the Engi­neering Auditorium.

Sailin·g Club runs second in regatta
by Mark Perry Sporta Writer 
Consistently strong perfor­mances helped lead the Notre Dame-St. Mary's sailing club to a second place finish at the Notre . Dame Intersectional held last Saturday and Sunday at Eagle Lake in Edwardsburg, Michigan. 
Eleven s'chools competed at the meet, as Michigan State placed first, followed by the Irish and Michigan. 
In the twelve races held over the weekend in two divisions, the Irish placed no lower than fourth. Four races were held on Saturday, as Notre Dame pulled into second place and held that position through the eight races held on Sunday. 
Phil Reynolds was the skipper for Notre Dame in Division A, aided by linda Hoyt (SMC) on Saturday and Sue Smiggen (SMC) on Sunday. Don Condit headed the Division B 

crew, with Carol Silva (NO) sailing 
on Saturday and Jane Brown (NO) 
on Sunday. 

This was the second big meet for 
the Irish this season, who were 
ranted 20th in the nation last year 
and hope to hold or improve that 
rating this year. 

The Irish have several big meets upcoming as they will be traveling nearly every weekend this fall. This Saturday and Sunday they travel to the University of Michigan to compete in the Cary Price Invitational. 
The ND-SMC team is also planning two big meets over the upcoming fall breaks. Over the October break they will travel to Long Beach, California 4o compete in the Collegiate Match Races, the national championships equivalent for sailing. 
Over Thanksgiving break the team will be competing in the ·Timme Angsten Invitational at the 
Belmont Yacht Club in Chicago.

"It was a fun tournament and a chance for the golf team and the other students to compete together." These were the simple, but appropriate words used by Irish Golf Captain Tim Saurs to char­acterize the events of the 1978 'loire Dame. Open held on the ol•1rkt· Memorial Golf course. 
I he tournament, directed by Jn-.h Golf mentor Noel O'Sullivan, is an annual 64-hole affair encom­passing two consecutive weekends. 
It lends an opportunity to all Notre Dame students to exhibit their golfing prowess, as well as, enjoy the pleasantries of a fall afternoon. 
John Lundgren, this year's victor, fires rounds of 70-75-69-70 on his way to a phenomenal 64-hole total of 284. Tim Saurs, team captain and second place finisher for the past two years, grabbed second once more with scores of 71-71-73~71 for a total of 286, only two shots behind Lundgren. Biv Wadden rounded out the top three with a respectable four round total of 289. 
'~It was an honor to win this tournament," said Lundgren. "There are so many good golfers 

on this campus and all do have a 
chance to win." 

Coach O'Sullivan was thrilled 
with the tournament's success and 
results. All five returning letter­
men (Saurs, McCarthy, Lundgren, 
Knee, and Sacheck) finished within 
the top ten positions. 

"This is an example of the kind of spirit that the golf team has this year," said a jubilant Coach O'Sullivan. "Golf is a highly individualistic sport, but the entire team was pleased with John Lundgren's winning performance. 
"I dig team spirit! It breeds success and is a quality that just can not miss." 
• The team will soon have the opportunity to put this spirit to use as it prepares for the Tri-State match to be held this Friday in Angola, Indiana. 
On Sunday, the team travels to Lebanon, Indiana for the Indiana State Intercollegiate Champion­ship. This is a crucial 36-hole tournament drawing Indiana's top golfing powers. The team closes its fall season with the Notre Dame Invitational. Fourteen fine teams have accepted the invitation. Coach O'Sullivan forsees a very "prosperous golf campaign." 
Michigan vs. N·D·: 
''Titanic battle'' slated for Irish on Saturday 
CIDCAGO [ap] -What are the advantages or disadvantages of having an extra week off following a loss in preparing for one of the bigger games of the season? 
Bo Schembechler of Michigan said "I don't know, I've never been in that position." 
Dan Devine of Notre Dame is in that position since his Irish lost 3-0 to Missouri and have had an extra week to prepare for Michigan. But Devine isn't sure what it means. 
Both coaches talked to The Chicago Football Writers in tele­phone interviews Tuesday prior to what could turn out to be a titanic battle in South Bend Saturday. 

''Anytime you lose you like to go out and play an hour later and get the loss out of your system," said Devine. "The advantages that we are now a better team than we were two weeks ago. We might have been too vocally confident before the Missouri game." 
In making his remarks, Devine insisted he was not detracting from a great victory by Missouri. 
"They've had an extra week to prepare for us," said Schembechler. "Of course, their big advantage is playing in their stadium." 
It's the first meeting between the two Midwestern powers in 35 years. Michigan holds a 9-2 edge in the series, but the last time they met was in 1943 with Notre Dame winning 35-12. 
"This is the type of game that probably should be played," said Schedbechler. "between two Mid­western teams who have been strong down through the years." 
Schembechler wasn't too pleased with Michigan's 31-0 opening vic­tory against Illinois except for the fact that "it was a shutout and the kicking game was encouraging. 
"It was a typical opening game," said Schembechler who insisted the Wolverines weren't looking ahead to Notre Dame.
