FBI nabs Mafia boss, uncovers initiation rite 
BOSTON 1/\Pl -/\n FBI swnl'p through thrcn states on Monday nettPd New England's top organiwd crime boss, cul­minating a five-year probe in which invnstigators taped the Mafia's solemn blood initiation ritn,authoritins said. 
Tlw 113-count indictments naming 21 alleged mobsters wPrn especially significant for tlwir extnnsivl' description of the induction cPwmony, said 
U.S. Attornny General Dick Thornburgh. 
"It should lay to n~st once and for all any doubts that the Cosa Nostra is a figment of law Pnforcemnnt's imagination," Thornburgh told reporters. 
"It establishes beyond doubt thn nxistence of a secret, dan­destine opPration that takes it­snlf very seriously." 
FBI agents fanned out Mon­day ovnr Massachusetts. Hhode Island and Connecticut to ar­rest the alleged criminals on a range of charges including murder, racketeering, kidnap­ping, drug trafficking, gam­bling, obstruction of justice and witness intimidation. Fifteen of the 21 wen~ in custody Monday afternoon. 
"These thme indictments rep­resent an unprecedented as­sault on New England orga­nized crime activity," said Thornburgh, who was joined in Boston by the FBI Director William Sessions and U.S. at­torneys for the three New Eng­land states. 
Sessions said the dragnet and court-approved tapes of an in­duction ceremony in Medford in October shows the bureau's "ability to invade the inner sanctums ... with the intention to destroy them."

University meets needs of disabled students on individual, special basis 
By SANDRA WIEGAND 
Assistant News Editor 
March has been designated Disabilitins /\wanmess Month by the Govnrnor's Planning Council for Pnople with Disabil­ities. 
There are 30 to 40 students with disabilities on the Notre Damn campus now, according to Eileen Kolman, associate provost and coordinator for disabled students. Because of the small number of disabled students, their problems are dealt with individually, and no ovr.rall policy is necessary, she said. 
Kolman said that although 
many of the older buildings on campus are not fully equipped for students with mobility-re­lated disabilities, "there are several halls that can accom­modate them." 
She said she knew of no un­dergraduates in wheelchairs, 


but knew of a few graduate students in wheelchairs who As renovations on the old live in Grace-O'Hara. halls occur, Heinebold said, the

Divorce, incomes change families 

By MICHAEL OWEN 
News Writer 
Exterrutl prPssurns. such as povnrty, divorce. and teen pregnancy, have caused serious changes in the structure and function of the /\mnriean fam­ily, according to Harriette Mc/\doo. professor of social work at Howard University. 
Her lecture titled, "Marriage: What's tlw Future?" focussed on the history, consequences and future of the two-parent Amf\rican family facing external pressures. 
McAdoo explained one of these pressures as, "increases in innation and fear of over­coming poverty." Husbands and wives must both work now, ac­cording to Mc/\doo. 
Only 18 percent of families today have mothers who stay at home with their children, she said. 
The demographic changes' within the American family have caused some serious per­sonal and public consequences. Time spent with the family has decreased sharply. 
McAdoo cited a Newsweek 
study that showed Americans 
spend one year of their lives 
searching through clutter on 



Harriette McAdoo 
their desks, seven years in the bathroom, and only seven min­utes a day with their children. 
Businesses suffer from this shift in families, also. There is evidence of "higher absences, more stress and an increase in health insurance costs," ac­cording to McAdoo. 
The shift to a dual income family has also caused dispari­ties between husbands and wives. Men are allowed to spend more time with their chHdren since they do not par­ticipate equally in household chores, she said. 
"In addition to their work days, women perform an aver­age of 22.6 hours of household chores per week as compared to seven hours performed by men," said McAdoo. 

Other pressures include di­
vorce and teenage pregnancy. McAdoo called divorce for women today "the feminization of poverty." This is supported by the fact that women's in­comes decrease and stay lower after a divorce in contrast to mens' incomes that decrease and quickly continue to in­crease. 
McAdoo stated that teenage pregnancy causes approxi­mately one third of single par­ent families. This figure is not as high as most people would believe, according to McAdoo. 
Results of various studies have showed that families "are retaining the same family val­ues," she concluded. Problems experienced by the modern family can be helped by an in­creasing number of government and local programs designed to help families cope with new pressures. 
McAdoo's lecture yesterday was the first in a series of lec­tures to be sponsored by the Program of Gender Studies at Notre Dame. 
here now." 
Kolman said that the Grounds/Maintenance depart­ment stays in touch with her of­fice and a special effort is made to clear the snow on the paths disabled students use to get to class. 
She also pointed out that a cart service is available both to students with disabilities and to students with temporary in­juries. 
Although there is no policy by which students with disabilities are given special excuses when they are unable to get to class, professors are generally very understanding, she said. 
"My experience is that all of the teachers...are quite accom­modating to it," she said. 
Students with disabilities such as blindness and deafness are also given special attention, Kolman said. For example, a deaf student in the Notre Dame Law School has an interpreter who signs the professors' lec­tures in his classes. The inter­preter was arranged through William McLean, assistant dean of law, and a local organiza­tion, Kolman said, and had to be brought in from Kankakee. 
Kolman spoke of a bill that is before Congress now, which, if passed, would require that

Where have Notre Dame's goofs gone? 
My brother Rich was a thief. Well, not really. My Dad thinks he allowed Hich too much license during those odd years in the seventies, and that Hich stole his way John Cronin through Notre Dame­-he was a drama rna-Asst. Viewpoint Editor jor, or an art major---------­even he's not clear and he never went to a football game. Grand larceny! Imagine getting an educa­tion from ND without investing in it's tradi­tions-without so much as a blue and gold sweatshirt. 
Anyway. there were guys here in those days who seemed so eccentric. Okay, okay, I won't jive you with any reminiscences about the past-a golden past-after all, our Dome's as gold as there's was. right? Still, what about the guy who thought he was Patton. 
This bnllbottomed buck had an affinity for a recording of the movie "Patton." Every weekend, in the wee hours of the night, this student became General George S. Patton in full military attire. He had the soundtrack. the speakers, the microphone and he did a damn good impersonation. Blaring from some window in Alumni, he would bark out Patton's monologue to a "sleeping" campus. 
He went so far with the bit that he found a beat-up Army jeep-the ones you can order from the back a Holling Stone for $44-and was driven around the quads on AnTostal Wflekend. complete with a helmet, riding pants, a horsewhip, and of course a megaphone. This guy was for real. 
But wait a minute, the nuts back in those days don't stop there. There was a cool cat claiming to lead campus as their King. The guy who ran last year as King paled in comparison to his predecessor. King Kahuna was his name and in 1975 he took ND by storm. lie was a real hippie-long stringy hair, a Fu Manchu moustache, and a shell neeklaee. But of all his antics, none was as memo­rable as the rally at the Grotto. The King was carried in by his henchmen on his throne through a packed audience. As he stepped upon the altar and raised his arms two gasoline-lilled garbage cans on either side of the altar wer~ ignited and the names leapt up beside the King as he delivered his address. Needless to say, the king won the election by a landslide. So where are all these type of people at today's ND? I realize that that was then and this is now-a very conservative now, but I'm afraid that students here are going to realize only too late that it's not the evenings at Bridget's or some party at Campus View that are remembered in twenty years-it's being an individual. get­ting involved and not being afraid to do something that might be a little crazy.

The Bureau of the Census doesn't ex­pect a cat to lill out a census form. However, the form intended for a Johnson County couple was addressed to their pet cat. Banjo. the 5-year-old cat that belongs to Steve and Carole Shanks, is listed on the mailbox, along with his owners' names. Census oflicials explain that in 1988, workers went door-to-door to identify rural route addresses such as the Shanks, and that may be how Banjo's name was placed on the form.

Job interviews require salesmanship, gusto 
By COLLEEN GANNON 
News Writer 

The importance of selling yourself in the job interview was stressed yesterday by Meg Nigro, a manpower develop­ment manager from the Ameri­can Sales Association (ASA). 
"You are selling yourself in the job interview. That is probably the most difficult sale you will ever have to make," Nigro said in her lecture titled "Sales: How to Enter the Field and be Successful." 
Nigro claimed that the ASA can help students "maximize thPir opportunities for getting 
iobs possible." They

more than a piece of paper that we call a resume?" ASA helps the student answer this by go­ing through the interview pro­cess with the student. 
One tip Nigro gave for a suc­cessful interview was to provide tangible evidence with one's an­swers. She said, "You need to give the company evidence that 
you are the type of person they 
are looking for, and also to 
give them evidence that you are 
unique." 

She pointed out that the most common complaint of compa­nies comes from the students failure to follow up their inter­views. She said she believes this call can make the differ­ence between an offer or a re­jection letter. 
In her experience as an inter­viewer, Nigro rarely found any­one who asked her for a second interview. She recommended that students should show this type of initiative. "You need to show a degree of initiative no matter what job you are after," she said. 
When interviewing, Nigro did not rely heavily on a student's GPA. On the other hand, she sees a high activity level as cru­cial for success in obtaining employment in sales. 
The ASA came into existence 
eight months ago with the pur­
pose of filling the gap going 
from an undergraduate degree 
to employment in sales. The 
ASA gives people the opportu­
nity to get experience in sales 
and to distinguish themselves 
from other entry level appli­
cants. 
On May 22nd, the ASA will co­sponsor The "B.E.S.T." Oppor­tunity Job Fair at the Mc­Cormick Hotel in Chicago. One­hundred to 150 companies will be represented at the fair. 
There will not be a charge to attend the fair for those stu­dents who register through ca­reer placement or the market­ing club. During the fair, a student can interview with companies, attend career semi­nars, and attend an interview­ing skills seminar. 
The Notre Dame Marketing Club sponsored Nigro's lecture. 

Senate announces Irish Clover awards 
By SANDRA WIEGAND 
Assistant News Editor 
The Irish Clover Award, given by the Student Senate for out­standing contribution to the Notre Dame community, will be presented to students Guy Weismantel and Melissa Smith and faculty members Victor Krebs and Peter Lombardo. 
Weismantel is presently stu­dent body treasurer, Smith is executive advisor to Student Government. Krebs is rector of Grace Hall, and Lombardo is associate professional special­ist and associate director of the Center for Continuing Educa­tion. 
In other Senate news, the new Student Union Board Executive Council for 1990-91 was an­nounced at the Student Senate meeting Monday. 
Erin Laurelle was named board manager, Scott Harris director of programming, Tri­one Byrne director of market­ing, Beth Wittman, director of relations, and Dan Orie con­troller. 
Jim Hanley was named new Student Body Treasurer, and chose John Coffey as his assis­
tant. A member of the Multicul­tural Executive Council will sit in on Student Senate meetings next year if the Hall Presidents Council approves the proposal tomorrow. The Student Senate unanimously approved the pro­posal Monday. 
A bylaw to the Student Gov­ernment Constitution was added at the meeting, stating that when one candidate or ticket runs for election unop­posed and the time period al­lowed for the formation of write-in tickets has expired, the election committee may suspend the election and the candi­date/ticket will be declared the winner.

The Democratic Forum and the Free Democrats have said they do not want to govern to­gether, so the Smallholders may be the key to forming a coalition.

Tandy, 'Daisy' gain Oscar honors 
LOS ANGELES (AP) "Driving Miss Daisy," the heartwarming story of a crotchety Jewish widow and her friendship with a patient black chauffeur, won the -Oscar as best picture Monday and cap­tured the top acting prize for Jessica Tandy. Its total of four awards made it the year's most-honored film. 
Daniel Day-Lewis was named 
best actor for his role in "My 
Left Foot" as Christy Brown, 
who battled cerebral palsy to 
become an acclaimed artist. 
Brenda Fricker, who played his 
devoted mother, won the best 
supporting actress award. 
Oliver Stone was honored at 
the 62nd annual Academy 
Awards as best director for 
"Born on the Fourth of July," 
the story of a Vietnam soldier's 
transformation from bitter paraplegic to anti-war activist. It was the second such prize in three years for Stone, who also won for the 1986 anti-Vietnam epic "Platoon." 
"My deepest thanks for your acknowledgment that Vietnam is not over, though some people say it is," said Stone. 
For the first time since 1981, the directing award did not go for the year's best picture. Bruce Beresford, who directed "Miss Daisy," was not even nominated, an omission that was commented on frequently during the presentations. 
"We're up here for one simple 
reason," said Richard Zanuck, 
who produced "Miss Daisy" 
with his wife, Lili. "And that's 
the fact that Bruce Beresford is 
a brilliant director."

Denzel Washington, the run­awav slave turned soldier in :'Glory," won the best support­mg actor award. 
"My son said he was going to make one of these out of clay for me, now I've got a model for hi~," an exultant Washing­ton satd as he held up his gold statuette, first award of the evening. 
"I never expected in a million years that I would be in this position. It's a miracle!" said Miss Tandy, who at 80 becomes the oldest performer to win an Oscar. The slender, white­haired actress received a standing ovation from the crowd that packed the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Los Angeles Music Center. 
Day-Lewis had to overcome tough competition from "Miss Daisy's" Morgan Freeman and "Fourth of July's" Tom Cruise to win his Oscar. 
"For everyone involved in the film, all our desire to make the film, all the strength that we needed, all the pleasure that we 
took in making the film  came  
from  Christy  Brown,"  Day­ 
Lewis said.  

"1 don't believe this!" ex­claimed the Dublin-born Miss Fricker as she came on stage. 
She added her thanks to "Christy Brown, just for being alive, and to his mother, Mrs. Brown. Anybody who gives birth 22 times deserves one " she said, referring to the Osc~r. 
T~e awards were spread ir unusually even fashion during the 3-hour, 34-minute show that was televised live on ABC­TV and reached a worldwide audience estimated in advance at 1 billion. 
"Miss Daisy" also won for screenplay adaptation and makeup, making it the night's leader. 
Clergy are 'part of a team' in struggle to cope with death 
~y L. PETER YOB News Writer 
Communication and team­work between the terminally ill and professionals trying to help them make the approach of death easier for everyone in­volved, according to a panel that met yesterday. 
The discussion was initiated as part of Notre Dame's Year of the Family Program. It was designed to allow panelists to share their views with people who are now facing a death in the family. 
Father Gregory Green, staff chaplain and a panelist at the discussion, said that it is very important to remember that the "priest is very much in­volved in health care." He said that, "a clergyman is part of a team, not someone called to schedule a funeral." 
"The relationship built by a 

priest during sickness can help 
the family of the dying patient 
plan for the future," said 
Green. He also said that he 
hopes people will turn to a pas­

tor when faced with death or a 
dying family member. 
Another panelist, Marta 
Makielski of the IUSB school of 
nursing, said that she has 
worked in critical care nursing 
for 12 years. She said that 
many in critical care are on the 
fence between life and death 
and that she has personally 
"seen a lot of death." 
"People are often unprepared 
about death," said Makielski, 
and "many don't realize until 
they are in intensive care ef­
forts to keep them alive, that 
this is not what they wanted." 
While Makielski said that 
communication is a problem because most patients are in­timidated by doctors, another panelist, Professor Thomas Shaffer of the Notre Dame Law School said that where medical technology is involved, doctors are intimidated by judges. 

"Doctors are afraid of being sued," said Shaffer. According to Shaffer, the Jaw is protective and "concerned with ""P.ing that the process of dying is not hastened." 
When deciding whether so­phisticated medical care should be withheld, the law usually looks for an indication of what the patient would desire to be provided or withheld. This in­tention is sometimes reflected in a document, called a living will, said Shaffer. 
Another panelist,Tom Burzynski, the director of hos­pice of St. Joseph County, said that "we are in a death denying society." Hospice looks at death as a normal process, ac­cording to Burzynski. 
Burzynski said that Hospice 

uses the team approach to help 
people deal with quality of life 
issues while they are dying. 
Hospice provides home care, 
said Burzynski, because when 
people are among family and 
possessions, they feel comfort­
able dying in that kind of situa­
tion. 
"Doctors are trained to cure," .said Burzynski, "but there comes a time when curing is no longer possible but caring is." 
"Perhaps we need to remind ourselves from time to time that patients are not just dy­ing" he said, "they are also liv­ing."

EAT YOUR VEGETABLES. CHILDREN IN INDIANA ARE STARVING.  

"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for justice's sake. They shall be satisfied." 
"I was hungry. You fed me." 

Hunger and starvation are a way of life for 500 million persons. None of them go to Notre Dame. 
That people are hungry is seldom debated. Why they are hungry often (though not often enough) is. It has been suggested that every country in the world has all of the resources necessary to free its people from their hunger, but economic and distribution policies prevent this from happening. 
According to the Institute for Food and Development Policy, there is more than enough food available to feed the entire world. Enough grain is produced to allow everyone on the planet ample protein and 3000 calories each day. Even in those countries where so many are forced to go hungry, there is ample supply. In India, soldiers patrol the country's 16 million tons of surplus grain. In Mexico, where 80% of the children in rural areas are undernourished, the cattle (mostly intended to U.S. export) consume more grain than does the country's entire rural population. In Bangladesh, enough resources are available to provide each person with 2600 calories per day, yet most consume fewer than 150\. calories per day. 
From the Institute: "Following the 1974 floods (in Bangladesh) millions in Bangladesh perished. But they did not die because of scarcity. One Bangladeshi describes what happened in her village: "A lot of people died of starvation here. The rich farmers were holding rice and not letting any of the poor see..." Asked whether there was enough food in the village, she replied, "There may not have been a Jot of food, but if it had been shared, no one would have died." 
The problem, this suggests, is not one of resources. The problem is one of justice. Of sharing. Of community. 500 million people are underfed. There is plenty of food. Some are not getting their share, others are getting too much. 
If you're reading this while eating, don't feel too indisposed. World hunger's not our fault, necessarily, but part of the solution does lie in our hands (or our mouths). 
Did you know that whatever you don't eat is given away to the poor? Through such University sponsored programs as FoodShare, food left over from dining hall meals are taken to a few agencies in South Bend -mostly Hope Rescue Mission and the Center for the Homeless -to feed those they 
serve. 

That means, very literally, that if any of us take vegetables, for example, and don't eat them, someone goes without. If we waste any food in any way (eg: food fights, taking more than we'll eat,etc.) it is literally taken away from someone who has nothing to eat that doesn't come from us. It is of value to reflect on this when we eat. What we eat nourishes us. What we don't eat will nourish someone else, if we act responsibly towards what we don't eat. 
Our eating habits, thus, become a great, practical and immediate way to increase our consciousness about being a global community. Imagine that a direct relationship between our eating habits and world hunger-at least on a local scale. A direct relationship between our selfishness or lack thereof and someone else's survival. 
So do our study habits become a way to increase our consciousness about the problems and potential solutions. Economics, earth sciences, biology, chemistry, business ethics, history, international relations, philosophy, theology, Freshmen Seminar, PLS, almost anything we study can be seen as a way to learn enough about the interrelatedness of all the earth and the issues that determine policies and practices affecting the world hunger situation. 
How we worship can also play a role in expanding our consciousness. In the Eucharist, for example, look at the bread that becomes for us and makes us the body of Christ. Not much to it, usually. Hardly nourishing in and of itself. But through our faith, we take it and eat of it and become what it represents. We become the body and blood and hands and minds and wills and policies and procedures that will be the current enactment of the gospel. We become the good news to those who need it. Or, we don't. 
An old yet effective story: An artist was asked to paint a picture of hell. She drew a great banquet with plenty of food, all types, great substance. She had a bunch of people sitting at the tables of the banquet, all told that they could only eat using the forks provided. Each fork was ten feet long -too long to reach anyone's own mouth. So everyone was starving to death, because they couldn't eat. 
The same artist was then asked to paint a portrait of heaven. She painted the same exact picture: great banquet, sumptuous food, people sitting at tables with ten foot forks that they had to use in order to eat. 
But in this picture, no one was starving to death. Everyone was well nourished. They used the forks to feed each other. 
So might we, so others might eat, too. 
This fourth week of Lent, the Office of Campus Ministry and the Center for Social Concerns suggest we focus on the issue of hunger. Collections taken at last Sunday's Masses and contributions made during the week at either the Center for Social Concerns or the Office of Campus Ministry (Ubrary of Badin Hall) will be contributed to local agencies helping to feed the hungry in the local area. 
If you are interested in volunteering to help further in this issue, you might want to consider joining FoodShare. Volunteers take leftovers from our dining halls to local agencies, as mentioned above. It takes about one hour per day to do a FoodShare delivery. For more information, contact the CSC.

Soviet occupation is not a threat to June summit plans 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The Bush administration on Monday opposed Soviet military occu­pation of three buildings in the capital of Lithuania but said Moscow's actions so far don't threaten June's U.S.-Soviet summit. 
The occupation of Communist Party buildings in Vilnius is "a kind of force and we're op­posed to any kind of use of force," said presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. 
He said that tensions in the secessionist republic "seem to have escalated on a daily ba­sis ... Building occupation is a significant event in this sense." 
Nonetheless, Fitzwater said, "The Soviets themselves have publicly and privately assured us that they have no intentions of using military force to re­solve the issue." 
Addressing the summit planned in June between Presi­dent Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, Fitzwater said: 
"We're prepared to have the summit at (that) time. We're still hopeful this can be re­solved." 
On the subject of recent Soviet no-force assurances, Fitzwater said that Moscow's promises were reiterated on Friday dur­ing a State Department meeting between Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger and Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin. 
Dubinin earlier in the week had offered similar assurances to National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, the White House said. 
State Department spokeswoman Margaret 
Tutwiler said Secretary of State 
James Baker sent a private 
message to Soviet Foreign Min­
ister Eduard Shevardnadze 
over the weekend regarding the 
situation in Lithuania. 
Tutwiler said a m·eeting on 

tap next week between Baker 
and Shevardnadze was still 
planned. 
Sen. Edward Kennedy, the 

Massachusetts Democrat visit­
ing the Soviet Union, said Mon­
day that Gorbachev had told 
him there are no plans to use 
force to bring Lithuania back 
into the Soviet fold. 
AftPr meeting with Gorbaehev 

for 1 1/2 hours, Kennndy said 
the Soviet leadnr "indicated to 
me that the position of the So­
viet Union was that thern would 
be no use of force unless the 
lives of others were threatened, 
and that he was committed to a 
peaceful resolution." 
In an interview with National 

Public Hadio, Lithuanian Presi­
dent Vytautas Landsbnrgis said 
the situation had become "very 
dangerous" in the light of Gor­
bachev's reported remarks to 
Kennedy. 
"Before he always said that 

he would not use force in 
Lithuania, but now we have a 
situation where he's qualifying 
that statement and setting a 
condition under which he could 
use force. 
"The only danger to the lives 

and health of the residents of 
Lithuania is the presence of So­
viet army troops themselves," 
Landsbergis said. 
Soviet soldiers took over two schools in Vilnius on Sunday, the Higher Party School and the Institute of Marxism-Leninism.

Saint Mary's needs new room selection policy 
Saint Mary's students completed the room selection 
process last week. Unfortunately, not all students are 
happy with the room and dorm they will be living in 
next year. 

BPcause each hall allots a certain number of spaces 
for each class, with the exception of seniors, many 
students arc forced to live in dorms where they would 
rather not reside. Many students are separated from 
friends with better room picks. 
The Saint Mary's housing selection process needs to 
be reorganized. First of all. the quota system should 
be abolished. Without the quota system, students will 
have a better chance of living in the dorm of their 
choice at least once in their four years at Saint 
Mary's. 

Additionally, Regina Hall should be reserved solely 
for freshmen. As the dorm is comprised of singles and 
is typically considered a freshman dorm, upperclass­
men should not be forced to live there simply to fill 
quotas. Upperclassmen should not have to live in a 
dorm where the rooms are considerably smaller than 
others on campus. Next year, 18 seniors are going to 
live in Regina Hall. 

After Regina is full, the remaining freshmen should 
be placed in McCandless Hall. McCandless would then 
primarily be a freshman and sophomore dorm. 
Seniors should choose their rooms first; once singles 
are filled in LeMans, Holy Cross and McCandless, the 
seniors would then be able to reevaluate their housing 
plans rather than live in singles in Regina. 
Juniors should choose rooms, next, and then sopho­
mores. This practice would increase students' chances 
of living in the same dorm or section with their 
friends. 

Another problem with the Saint Mary's housing pol­
icy is that student government leaders are given pref­
erence for housing selections because of the require­
ment that these students live on campus during the 
school year. 

There is no reason that student leaders, other than 
resident advisors, should chose their rooms prior to 
the regular lottery. Serving the Saint Mary's student 
body should be considered enough of a privilege for 
these leaders. Hall leaders should be elected after 
room picks. 

It's ridiculous that this housing system has been in 
use since 1984. It's definitely time for a change.

Rights debates affect student life 
Dear Editor: 
Student Government is often criticized as a bunch of poster­happy bureaucrat-wanna-be's , who debate at "Top Secret Emergency" meetings over the mysteries of Notre Dame life, from table tents during elec­tions to Styrofoam bans. 
Well, politics and table tents aside, Student Government. more specifically the Campus Life Council, is in the midst of an important, if not controver­sial series of discussions which could affect many aspects of everyday student life. The topic in question is the proposed Bill of University and Student Rela­tions, a list of seven student rights. This bill could have far­reaching effects, from the con­tents and ads found in The Ob­server to the consequences of sending a snowball in the gen­eral direction of Dillon Hall. But most importantly, this pro­posal could usher in a more mature and responsible rela­tionship between the adminis­tration and students. 
Specifically, the bill calls for the rights of Notre Dame students to due process, to be judged in part by one's peers in administrative hearings, to open hearings, to by informed of all administrative hearings, to not be collectively punished unless self-imposed, to a free and uncensored press, and finally, to carry on individual and organized activity expressing any opinion regarding the University and/or society. The bill is a statement of trust between students and the administration. 
At this time, the bill has passed unanimously through the Student Senate, and is un­der consideration by the Cam­pus Life Council. This Council ( composed of students, faculty, rectors and Dr. Goldrick) is the most important body, of which students are members, which can suggest policy changes to the administration. Unlike the Student Senate, resolutions passed by the Campus Life Council must be commented upon by Father Tyson, in form of a veto, selective implementa­tion, or approval. 
The bill is the result of months of hard work and re­search by the Legal Department of Student Government, specifi­cally by Megan Hines and Greg Volan. This resolution is at a difficult crossroads, with 'lame duck' student leaders, graduat­ing seniors, the new elections and the perpetual threat of eternal tabling by the CLC due to the end of the academic year. Therefore, it is imperative for quick and decisive action, ac­companied by student support. to address these basic rights. 

While the Student Senate meetings are always open, the Campus Life Council is only open upon approval of its members. On Wednesday, March 28 at 3:30 pm in the Notre Dame Room (Second Floor LaFortune), the CLC will continue its consideration of this bill. All members of the Notre Dame community may attend this important meeting to add insight to this crucial discussion. This meeting is just one example of how. student government, in cooperation with faculty, hall staff and administration officials, can truly be effective. Please attend to voice your sincere approval or concerns about this bill.

Students call for open discussion of rights bill 
Dear Editor: 

Based on the interest sparked at last Thursday's Campus Life Council Meeting, the group will meet again this Wednesday, March 28, at 3:30 p.m. in the Notre Dame Room of LaFor­tune to discuss the Bill of Uni­versity and Student Relations. I implore students to co:ne and make their presence felt at this meeting, as it is the first "open" Campus Life Council Meeting to to be held thus far. 
Through the decision to open the meeting, we can observe the bill's effectiveness to a small degree. Such an effect can only become magnified through stu­dent interest and participation. 
At the last meeting, there was no representative of Student Affairs present and, conse­quently, the bill was not al­lowed to be adequately dis­cussed nor were specific sec­tions able to be voted upon. I trust that there will be a repre­sentative from this office pre­sent Wednesday. And I trust that there will be mass student representation as well.

SWAP, Sharing With Ap­palachian Pnopln, is a Mennon­ite program based in Harlan, 
Kentucky. Denis and Jen Travnrs run the program which is aimed at helping to repair homes, as well as building lasting relationships with the people of Appalachia. The students who took part in SWAP were well aware of the first objective of the program, but I do not think they realized how dose they would grow to the families that were helped. 
The Garrntts are parents of l'ight and grandparents of ten. Stu Ilnaly, Pat Lanigan, Dan Skendzel and I had the job of replacing the roof on Wilma's homn that allowed water to pour inside the house. After removing and burning the old roof'. tlw process of placing the nPw roof was frustrating. But as wP managed to get each new strip of roofing placed, we felt a gn~at sense of accomplishment. A heavy rainfall Thursday night proved our hard work worthy. Not onP drop of rain found its way inside the five room bungalow. Despite continued rain and urm~rtainty on Friday, we managed to finish the job by re-roofing an addition to the house. 
As the only girl at the site, I grew close to Wilma. Each day I learned more about her life, and my admiration and respect for her grew. With her live two grandchildren she adopted after their mother, Wilma's daughter Nancy, was murdered three years ago. The sentencing of the man who murdered the daughter took place during the time we were working on the house. It was heartbreaking to listen to Dan and Wilma, and other family members talk about Nancy. An intense love and duty to protect exists between family members in the Appalachian region. The Garrelts, as well as the other families the group helped, believe in "an eye for an eye." At the trial, another of Wilma's daughters tried to bring a .38 into the courtroom, possibly to seek revenge on her sister's 

murderer. 
Dan, Stu, Pat and I grew close to the Garretts. As the week went on, we met other members of the family. We saw friends bring food, clothing, and furniture to Wilma. She had so many friends. "I would rather have good friends than money" became a comment of Wilma's that struck our hearts. 
The people of Appalachia have so much to offer. They may be poor, extremely poor, but they are so rich in life. They are happy 
'We had put a roof over their heads, and in turn, they had given the four of us a new understanding of happiness, love, and family...we had found new friends, the greatest of all riches.' 

despite what we see as miserable circumstances. They do not have material wealth; rather, they have human and spiritual wealth. Their lives are filled with hard work and many difficulties, but they have grown accustomed to hardship. They are survivors, deciding their own destiny, laws, and way of life in their little hollers in Southeastern Kentucky. 
Five families were designated to receive assistance from our group. Fourteen of us split up

If you're sick of seeing little Louie and dozens of other major league outfielders capture line drives with monstrous mitts, take heart. This year the Major Leagues plan to enforce the rule which states that gloves must be no more than 12 inchns from the top of the web to the palm. 
Last year, in similar fashion, the Major Leagues announced a decision to enforce balks strictly. The result was a gigantie increase in the number of balks called by umpires.

All four competing Notre Dame wrestlers ran out of luck in the second round of the NCAA championships at College Park, Maryland this past Friday. 
Senior Pat Boyd, sophomore Marcus Gowens, junior Mark Gerardi and freshman Steve King all lost their second matches in the tournament after advancing with wins in the first round. Oklahoma State won the NCAA title by scoring 
117.75 points. 

Boyd was expected to chal­lenge for the title at 142 pounds, as he was ranked third in the nation in that weight class, but Jeff Lyons of Indiana had other plans. Lyons deci­sioned Boyd with a 5-1 overtime victory in which the referee was overruled when he awarded Boyd a two-point takedown early in the match. 
"Pat was not himself. he was just not right mentally," Irish coach Fran McCann said. "Ability-wise, he's a potential finalist. but something was missing." 
Joe Reynolds of Oklahoma went on to win the 142-pound bracket, while Boyd lost 4-3 in his first match in the "wrestle backs" bracket to finish the season with five losses against 28 wins and a draw. 
Gowens was pinned by Kendall Cross of Oklahoma State at 126 pounds. Cross, the defending national champion, was ranked third in the 126­pound division but did not reach the finals. In the wrestle backs, Gowens lost to Tom Toth of American University 7­6 when he gave up a takedown late in the final stanza. 
At 16 7 pounds, Gerardi lost a 6-2 decision to Tom Marchette of Bucknell in the second round. Gerardi fought back in the wrestle backs with an 8-4 decision over a wrestler from Franklin and Marshall before he was eliminated from the tournament by Casey Graham of Indiana by a 6-2 score. 
King lost a tight (5-3) second round match against Brooks Simpson of Iowa. Simpson went on to the finals where he lost to Matt Huppel of Lehigh by a score of 6-5. King won his first match of the wrestle backs be­

fore being knocked out of the tournament by Jim Nelson of Iowa State in a 6-4 decision. 
"I thought Gerardi wrestled a good tournament," McCann said. "I thought for a freshman, Steve King was outstanding. lie showed a lot of heart. I was really pleased with those two (Gerardi and King). Everybody there (at the NCAAs) is talented, but it just comes down to who wants it the most." 
Senior Andy Hadenbaugh, de­spite qualifying, failed to make weight at 118 pounds and was unable to compete in the tour­nament. 
"We were extremely disap­pointed that Badenbaugh did not make weight. That put a damper on things right at the beginning. It was really not a good thing," McCann said. 
McCann was not surprised that Oklahoma State won the tournament outright. 
"I thought Oklahoma had the best shot going in," he said. "They had eight really solid guys; they just had too many horses for the rest of the field. Arizona State wrestled a great tournament as well. It was a great tournament; it came right down to the end." 
The Sun Devils placed second in the tourney with 104.75 points, while Iowa finished third with 102.75. 
The disappointment in the NCAA tournament closed out a season which opened with gmat expectations for the Irish, who looked very strong from top to bottom. Notre Dame began the season with a first place finish among eight teams in the Michigan State Invitational, but soon hit the skids on a trip to 
the west coast ovN Christmas Brnak. 
After finishing first in the Southern California Invitational, the Irish lost dual meets at Cal-Poly-San Luis Obispo and Fresno State. Although a win over Ohio State. which was ranked 1Oth in the country at the time, was cause for excitement, Notre Dame had trouble against some of the other Big 10 teams, losing dual meets to Michigan State, Iowa and Indiana. 
"Maybe we were a little too optimistic," McCann said. "Everything was in our favor, but (sophomore) Tim Anderson quit during the first semester, leaving a big hole at 134 (poundsl, and Andy's (Hadenbaugh's) weight problem hurt us as well." 
Hadenbaugh missed several meets during the season be­cause he couldn't make wnight. 
"That's what hurts," McCann concluded. "You know you havn the peopll'. but they can't play. That was really disappointing."

Dumars to miss four weeks 
DETROIT (AP)-Detroit Pistons starting guard Joe Dumars will miss at least four weeks after breaking the same hand he broke last year, the team said Monday. 
Dumars, averaging a ca­reer-best 18.4 points per game, suffered a rracture of the third metacarpal bone on his left hand when he tried to break a fall during Saturday's 105-98 loss at San Antonio. 
"When it first happened. I thought, 'Oh my God!' It was the same area of the hand that I hurt last year." Dumars said. "I can't even hold this piece of paper in this hand-it's too heavy." 
Dumars. 26, is in his fifth year in the league. lie was a member of the NBA Eastern Conferenee All-Star team last month and was the MVP of last year's NBA Finals, which the Pistons won in a four-gamn sweep over the Los Angclns Lakers.

Men foilists falter, finish fifth in NCAA 
By CHRIS FILLIO Sports Writer 

Despite finishing thn third clay of this 
year's NCAA tournament tied for first place, 
the Notre Dame fencing tnam 's hopes for a 
national title have greatly diminished. 
A new NCAA format this year awards an 
ovnrall titiP for all weapons in both the men's 
and women's divisions. Two second-place fin­
ishes in men's sabre and women's foil had 
the Irish hot in pursuit of the championship. 
However. a surprising lifth-plaee finish for 
the normally strong men's foil team has left 
the Irish battling for evt~n a top four finish. 
"Wt~ lost only one foil match all clay," said 
Irish assistant coach Mike Marx, "But that 
They were all dose bouts" 
While tlw foil squad eruised through their 
other matclws, the loss to Penn put them on 
the dPfnnsiw as they then had to battle to 
11nish 11fth. 

Columbia took tlw men's foil competition, 
with I'Pnn State second. Yale third. and Pnnn 
taking fourth. 

So what hope is IPI't for the Irish now? 
"WP did exactly what we didn't want to 
clo-IPaVP it up to our epee Warn on the last 
day," said ft-ndng manager Mark Byrrw. "On 
TLH~sday our npee is up against Penn and 
Penn Statf' in the sanw braekct. Wn haw to 
hope that sonwonc like Princ£~ton gets hot an 
knorks ofT Columbia." 

Ovf'r tlw ('oursn of thn season, the Irish 
ep!'P tnam remained the biggest question

Time to work on the fundamentals 
NO defensive line learning defensive tactics of Bumpas 
By FRANK PASTOR Associate Sports Editor 
Everymw starts on an nq ual basis. 
In new Notre Danw d!'fPnsive line coaeh Dick Bumpas's scheme of things, the 11rst snv­eral clays of spring football practice arc primarily tnaching days. Tlwre will bP plenty of time to nvaluatl~ person1wl later. 
"Hight now is not so much an nvaluation time as it is a tnach­ing time," Bumpas said. "Everyonn is an NJual playPr with an equal amount of mps. If they get equal teaching time, then whnn thn timn conws for thmn to show what they ean do. they'll bn preparncl and tlwn we'll makn an evaluation." 
Ileac! eoaeh Lou lloltz bnlievns tlw 11rst six to ten days of' tlw spring season should be spent teaehing players the fun­clamentals. After a short bn~ak. the majority of' the rmnaining spring dates will be devoted to scrimmaging. 
"We do a lot first and then we break," Holtz said, "and then 
-ll'll!lliii"'.._IIJJI..

As the NCAA championships went into its fourth day, the men's fencing team hurt its chances of winning by finishing fifth in men's foil. 
Baseball takes two in spite of weather 
By SCOTT BRUTOCAO Assistant Sports Editor 
Appan~ntly torrents of' rain and snow don't 
occur only in South Bend. 
The Notre Dame nwn's basf'hall lf'am. 
sehecluled for a full four ganws ovt'r tlw 
weeknnd. completed only two, the otlwr pair 
being snowed out against Indiana. 
The Irish, now 12-4. made tlw most of tlwir 
ecological situation by taking both games of 
a doublehnacler on Sunday versus Butler 
after being dPnif~d tlw opportunity to do 
likewise against tlw Hoosiers of Indiana. 
In cold and windy weather conditions thn Irish managed to clnfnat MidwnstPrn Collegiate Confernnee rival Butler by scores of 3-1 and 4-2. This fnat was dorw largPJy by eompetnnt pitching sincf' tlw 40-degmn tem­pnraturn and tlw 10-15-m.p.h. winds blowing m wem not conducive to high seoring. 
"Butlt~r is a much improwd basPIJall team," said Irish head coach Pat Murphy. "Butler is going to raust~ havoc in our ronfenHH:P bf'­fore it's over. With thn wnatlwr conditions cold and windy. I'm proud of tlw tf'am com­ing through wit.h two wins, not panicking, and roming through in tlw dutch at the f'JHI of tlw games." 
In tlw first contest. stmior righthandf'r Brian l'iotrowicz pitdwd thn first romplntf' game of the season for tlw Irish. lie allowf'd six hits, no walks and o1w unearnf'd run in seven innings. Tlw only senior starter on tlw team, he lowered his eanwcl run average to 
2.43 and raised his record to :~-2. see BUTLER I page 13 
wn scrimmagn a lot tlw last 
half. That way WI' haw mPnting 
tinw and nvPrybody's tlwrP for 
installation." 

As thn Irish mowd into thnir fourth of 20 spring practicP sessions inside tlw Loftus Cnnter, tlw clefPnsive linenwn opnnecl with agility drills. prac­ticPd fPncling ofT blockers and mixPcl it up with tlwir ofTensiw count<~rparts in livn seven-on­snvnn drills. 
Bumpas's tnaching focusl's on smart. aggrPssivn defpnsivP play-sonwthing which should fit the dPI'nnsiw linenwn on tlw Irish rostPr wlwn that crucial nvaluation period arrivns. 
"What I look for is if a guy is aggrPssivP," Bumpas said, "if he will chase tlw football and try to make big hits. 
"The thing l'vP btHm most pleased with has lwnn tlw atti­tudP and niTort of tlw playPrs. All of tlwm haw worked hard 
and worked well." 

Senior quad-captain Chris Zorich. who bench pressed 4(>0 pounds at the team's winter conditioning program, returns at nose tackle. Zorieh was rep­
rimanded by lloltz for !wing too aggressive in his wal to punish tlw Irish ballcarriers at Monday's practice. 
Senior tackle (iPorge Williams, hark from a yt>ar of academic inPiigihility. hopes to rt-turn to tht' form lw displayPd as a startPr on Notrf' l>anw's l!JSS championship tf'am. liP Wf'ighed in at :w2 pounds this 
winter.  somPthing  that  ron­ 
l'erns lloltz.  
'"Boo'  (Williams)  nf'eds  to  

lose a little weight. hut lw is a forrt~." Holtz said. "liP is what you rPI'Pr to as an anrhor. IIf' is tlw first guy I would pick in a tug-of-war." 
Both sf'nior Bob Dahl and ju­nior Troy Hidgley would make l'apahle starters at dt>fPnsive tackle. Dahl startf'd all 12 rt>gular-season ganws for tlw Irish .last Sf'ason hut did not make tlw trip to thf' Orangf' Bowl. Hidglny, who harkf'd up Zorich at nose tackle last season, playt~d impressivPiy in Dahl's absence at tlw Orangf' Bowl. 
see LINE I page 12 
By now almost evnrybocly in thn nation has heard of Damon Bailey. the talented guard who led Bedford North Lawrence to an Indiana Stat!' lligh School basketball championship. The story of how Indiana University coach Bob Knight has benn drooling ovm BailPy since hn was in eighth grade has littcn~d an alarming amount of copy in sports pages across the country. 
In short. Bailey was the consummate high school basketball player. lie was a team playnr, a 32-point­per-ganw scorer, and now he is a sta!P champion. 
lie  has  nourished  despite  the  constant  media  
attention gnnnratnd by Knight's  almost fanatical  
obsession with him as a player.  

Bailey's success is bound to end next year when he becomes a freshman at Indiana. lie will be hard-


pressed to break into an Indiana lineup featuring such talented young players as Pat Graham, Calbert Cheaney and Greg Graham. 
Too much will be expected of Bailey, a 6-3 guard who has made his living by driving to the basket in high school. While Bailey's press clippings would 1111 volumes, his outside jump shots do not 1111 baskets frequently enough to be11t a quality shooting guard. 
The favorite son of Ileltonville, Ind. will not be able to take it to the hole against the best guards in the Big 10. lie will be forced to refine his game and usc his outside shot to set up his drives rather than vice versa. 
Bailey is a smart play<Jr who eventually will make the necessary adjustments to be a collegiate success (but never an All-American). llis freshman year, however, may be long and frustrating. 
The Stanley Cup Playoffs arc approaching, but nobody seems to care. Although the National Hockey League has a great product to offer, Commissioner John Ziegler and his associates have 
done a lousy job of marketing the NIIL in tlw UnitPd 
States. 

The fnw U.S. eitizens whose local cable TV 
companies pick up the Sports Channel will have tlw 
opportunity to see futum stars like St. Louis's Brett 
I lull, Buffalo's Pit~rrP Turgeon and Lue Bobitaille of 
Los Angeles battle for NIIL suprem;u:y. Tlw rest of 
us will remain in tlw clark until tlw NIIL nngotiates a 
legitimate network TV eontraet. 
Prof'pssional hockey will remain a sncond-ratP sport in the eyes of Anwrican sports fans until Ziegler ean put tog(;ther such a eontract. David Stern brought the NBA out of its dark ages through effective television marketing; it's about time that Zingler n~cogniznd that lw eould do thn samP. 
Do you think you have seen tlw last alternatitve to the NFL now that the USFL is dead and gmw'? Think again.
