Two students die in unrelated cases 
University releases little information; rectors inform halls during Sunday Masses 
By KAREN LANGLEY and 
MARY KATE MALONE 
News Writers 
Two Notre Dame students died this weekend in separate and unrelated incidents, University officials said Sunday evening. 
One of the students, Connor McGrath, was a sophomore who moved to Siegfried Hall in January. He died Sunday morning or early afternoon, Siegfried rector Father John Conley told students gathered at the dorm's Mass Sunday night. 
McGrath's death did not take place in Siegfried, Conley said. His address was the first offi­cial notice to Siegfried resi­dents of McGrath's death. 
Local news outlets reported that a student died in Dillon Hall Sunday. This was uncon­firmed Sunday night by University officials, who also had not released McGrath's name. 
A call reporting an unre­sponsive male at Dillon was placed to the South Bend Fire Department at 1:39 p.m. Sunday, a fire department spokeswoman said. The ambu­lance arrived at Dillon at 1:53 p.m. and did not make a trans­port, she said. 
No name has been released in the second death, but a number of dorm rectors said the student was not an under­graduate. 
University President Father John Jenkins expressed condo­lences to the families of the two students through a state­ment Sunday night. 
"On behalf of the entire University, my deepest condo­lences go out to the families and friends of these two mem­bers of the Notre Dame fami­ly," Jenkins said. "Our prayers are with them during this diffi­cult time." 

The University will release further information once the immediate families of the two students have contacted other family members, University spokesman Dennis Brown said. 
Local news outlets reported that Notre Dame Security/Police responded to the scene Sunday, but The Observer was unable to reach the NDSP spokesman Sunday night.

Policybans profs from teaching relatives 
Provost hopes to avoid 'perception of bias' in the classroom; new rule to be enacted this fall 
By DAVIS RHORER, JR. 
News Writer 
Besides major and class restrictions, students register­ing for classes this fall will also have to consider blood ties to the instructor, as a new policy prohibits students and profes­sors who are related from being in the same classroom. 
In a letter to University fac­ulty and staff members, the Office of the Provost announced last month a policy that will go into effect begin­ning with the 2008-09 aca­demic year prohibiting profes­sors from teaching relatives. 
"We think its better not to put faculty in that position," Vice President and Associate Provost Donald Pope-Davis said last week. 
Pope-Davis referred to the "perception of bias" that might come up among students in a classroom if they knew their professor was teaching a direct relative. 
The new policy is part of the complete re-evaluation of aca­demic policies the University's Academic Council conducts every 10 years. Pope-Davis referred to the review as a chance to "update with the times." 
While he said no particular incident triggered the new pol­icy, Pope-Davis referred to the change as "proactive," com­mon among other universities and the product of a council of Notre Dame faculty members. 
The new policy will affect several students. In one case in the fall 2007 semester, entrepreneurship professor Gerald Frieling had his grand­son, senior Grant Frieling, as a student in one of his classes. 
"It was obviously different than a normal class," Grant Frieling said. 
As an entrepreneurship major, Frieling was required to take his grandfather's course to get the degree. He said that before the semester began, he and his grandfather decided to keep a strictly professor-stu­dent rapport in class. 
"I was more attentive," Grant Frieling said. "I didn't want to go through the motions." 
Professor Martine DeRidder, who teaches an introductory public policy course, had to handle her relationship with her daughter, who is currently taking her class. 

On the first day of school, DeRidder introduced her daughter to the rest of the class to avoid any misunder­standings. 
"I thought that was impor­tant. I didn't want people to think I was playing favorites," DeRidder said. 
She said that when she start­ed working at Notre Dame, she asked about the University's policy regarding professors teaching their own children ­a policy she said is good to have to avoid problems. 
But it is also important schools remain flexible in cer­tain cases, she said.

ND Inoves forward with green projects 
Sustainability office looks into energy efficiency 
By EMMA DRISCOLL News Writer 
Notre Dame is giving its affinity for the color green a new meaning with plans for various sustainability and conservation efforts across campus. 
The University recently. established the Office of Sustainability and a $2 mil­lion green loan fund, and "is evaluating plans for numer­ous projects and initiatives" for these new developments, Amy Coughlin, project man­agement director, said in an e-mail. 
Paul Kempf, director of utilities for the University 
and part of the Energy and Environmental Issues com­mittee, said some of these projects will focus on waste disposal, recycling; environ­mentally friendly landscap­ing and buildings and water and energy conservation. 
He said about 25 buildings -or 40 percent of the gross square footage of campus ­are currently being audited to identify potential conser­vation projects for the future, Kempf said. Some buildings being evaluated are the library tower, Flanner Hall, Notre Dame Stadium, the Snite Museum and the Hesburgh Center for

INSIDE COLUMN 



What's ina natne? 

"When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of' Iogie," writes Dale Carnegi11 in one of' the first best-sell­ing self help books, "llow 
Joey King 
to Win 
Friends and 
lnlluenee Viewpoint Editor 
People." 
"We are 
dealing with 

creatures of emotion, creatures bris­
tling with prejudices and motivated 
by pride and vanity." 

The book explores various conse­
quences of that principle, one of 
which is the importance of calling 
people by their first names. Only 
Carnegie puts it in grander terms, 

writing, "Hemember that a person's 
name is to that person the sweetest 
and most important sound in any 
language." 

He gives plenty of examples. Most 
notably he chronicles how another 
Carnegie-Andrew, Steel King­
applied the principal. When he 
wanted to sell rails to the 
Pnnnsylvania railroad, he built a 

steel mill in Pittsburgh called "Edgar 
Thompson Stnel Works." The presi­
dnnt of' the Pennsylvania Railroad at 
the time was J. Edgar Thompson. 
Let's just say that when J. Edgar 
Thompson needed to buy rails, he 
didn't go to Bob's llousP.-0-Steel. 
Dale Carnegie lived out his les­

sons, having changed the spelling of 
his name from "Carnegey" at a time 
when unrelated Andrew Carnegie 

was a widely revered and recognized 
name. 

One doesn't have to look far to see 
the principle in action today. 

DeBartolo, Jordan, Guglielmino, and 
others are recognized f'or linaneial 
donations. But Notre Dame also rec­
ognizes non-financial contributions. 
Examples inelude The Bockne 
Memorial Gymnasium, The 
llesburgh Library, and even the 
name of' the University itself. 

I want to highlight this whole nam­
ing business because, elsewhere, the 
linaneial contribution is beginning to 
bfl a driver. I'm referring specifically 
to the James Webb Space Telescope 
(JWSTI. scheduled for launch no 
flarlier than June 2013. 
It's not that I have anything 

against James E. Webb, NASA's sec­
ond administrator. It's just that, pre­
viously, such projects were named 

for scientists-like its predecessor, 
the Hubble Telescope (named for 

astronomer Edwin Hubble). But now 
funding the sciences in general is 

becoming less and less of a priority 
in America (we're not competing 

with Iraq the way we competed with 
the USSHI. Extra steps need to be 

taken. And naming an expensive tel­
escope after an administrator makes 
it much easier for current adminis­
trators to sign the necessary checks. 
The JWST is one of the most 

sophisticated machines our society 
has produced that wasn't designed 

to kill people, and this sort of nam­
ing nicety shouldn't have been nec­
essary.

NOAA appeals to seniors 
Class of2008 can start establishing connections to alumni clubs online 
By GENE NOONE News Writer 
As graduation nears, sen­iors can begin to take advantage of opportunities offered by the Notre Dame Alumni Association (NOAA), smoothing their transition into life after college. 
Seniors can use the Alumni Association's online network. Irish Online, to begin establishing connec­tions to Notre Dame alumni around the world. 
"We would really like to encourage the Class of 2008 to register and login to Irish Online before they gradu­ate," said Meeghan Mousaw, assistant director of Early Alumni Services. "It only takes a few minutes to reg­ister and after logging in they will be able to see all the things available." 
Through Irish Online, sen­iors can look for an alumni m1mtor, search for a job, find a former classmate or alumnus, update their con­tact information and create a personal Web page. 
Irish Online also allows snniors to sign up for e-mail forwarding. 
"After you leave Notre 
Dame, your nd.edu address will only be good until early July," Mousaw said. "E-mail forwarding is a free service available to all Notre Dame alumni that only requires users to obtain an e-mail address in the form, your­name@alumni.nd.edu." 
Any e-mails sent to the student e-mail will automat­ically be forwarded to the user's new address. Mousaw said this is an important -and easy ­way of staying connected to the University and other graduates. 
Mousaw also said the Alumni Association will be giving out free gifts to all seniors who register with Irish Online and select their future alumni club. Students who do not know where they will be living next fall can select up to four clubs, in case they at least have a few possible locations in mind. 
But no matter where stu­dents go after graduation, the Alumni Association is hoping to welcome them there -especially in larger cities -as clubs host "Young Alum Orientations" in August and September, Mousaw said. 
The Notre Dame Club of 
Chicago, for example, will be hosting an event called "Chicag-O" -spun off from "Frosh-0" -"so that the newest alums can be wel­comed to their new city," Mousaw said. 
Seniors who wish to par­ticipate in these events across the country must provide Irish Online with their personal information, Mousaw said, so they can be contacted by their respec­tive alumni club, she said. 
Seniors will receive in March a copy of "Onward to Victory," a newsletter that details each of these oppor­tunities. 
Also in March, voting will conclude for the 2008 Alumni Board of Directors elections, she said. Each member on the board serves a three-year term and rep­resents all graduates on alumni issues. Seniors have until March 12 to cast their ballots. 
The Alumni Association will be holding a Senior Open House on April 3 at the Eck Center where stu­dents can learn more about these opportunities.

ND astrono111er helps discover new planets 
Special to The Observer 
The simultaneous discovery of two exoplanets slightly smaller than Jupiter and Saturn by an international team of astronomers that includes David Bennett from Notre Dame gives astrophysicists an important clue that solar systems like ours might be quite common. 
The report, to be published in the Feb. 15 issue of the journal Science, describes the series of observations that began March 28, 2006, when a collaboration known as Optical Gravitational Microlensing Equipment (OGLE) detected a signal, possibly due to a planet in microlensing event OGLE-2006-BLG-109, that the researchers had discovered and announced two days earlier. 
After the OGLE group announced this possible detection of a planetary system via e-mail, other astronomers from the Microlensing Follow-Up Network (MicroFUN). Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics (MOA) and Probing Lensing Anomalies NETwork (PLANET) collaborations also began inten­sive, round-the-clock observa­tions of this event. The combined data from these four groups revealed a series of brightness variations over the ensuing 11 days that indicated that two plan­ets orbit a star half the mass of the sun located 5,000 light years from Earth. This star, called OGLE-2006-BLG-1 09L, and its planets were discovered using a technique known as gravitational micro lensing. 
Early calculations by the report's lead author, Scott Gaudi of Ohio State University, and the MicroFUN group indicated that most of the telltale brightness variations were due to a planet with a mass similar to that of Saturn, but that there was a brief additional brightening observed from Israel and Chile that could only be explained by an addition­al planet with nearly the mass of Jupiter. However, Gaudi's calcula­tions did not provide a perfect fit to the data and involved several approximations. 
Subsequently, Bennett per­formed more sophisticated calcu­lations in his office at Notre Dame using his own advanced computer program that included an important additional feature: the orbital motion of the Saturn­mass planet. 
"Even though we observed the micolensing eiTect of the Saturn for less than 0.3 percent of its orbit, the observations simply could not be explained without accounting for the orbit," said Bennett, a research associate professor of astrophysics.

She said minority enroll­ment at colleges is up -but that despitn this significant gain, "students of color" still lag behind. 

"There is absolutely no contradiction between excel­lence and diversity," Cole said. "But more black men are entangled in the criminal justice system than in the dormitories of our class­rooms." 
Even with decades of af'fir­mative action programs in place, colleges across the country remain predominant­ly white. And monumental changes in minority faculty representation arn necessary to eorr·ect that, she said.

Spelman College has a stu­dent body of about 3,000, while Bennett serves fewer than 650 undergraduates. 
Cole drew parallels between businesses that ben­ef'it by promoting diversity and roaching out to diverse customers, and colleges embracing students and pro­fessors from other races and backgrounds to improve the quality of education. 
Without a diverse student body and fac.ulty and an inclusive atmosphere, educa­tion will fall short, Cole said. 
To improve that feeling of rounded inclusiveness at Saint Mary's, Cole said, the Office of Multicultural Affairs needs more support. In addi­tion, she proposed visiting professorships and mini-resi­dencies at the College. 
Cole also spoke of the financial discrepancies at premier institutions that hin­der diversity and inclusive­ness. 
She talked about the schools' moral obligation to address issues of racism and socioeconomic barriers.

taskforces. Mulholland, along with several other students, is heading one of these task forces in Lewis Ilall, where a test case is currently under­way to determine "how much of a financial savings (Lewis) would have by switching to these bulbs," she said. 
Mulholland worked with other students to inventory all the light bulbs in Lewis, and is in the process of preparing a report for the dorm. 
Mulholland and Pearce are in the semifinals of the com­petition, along with 14 other teams, and submitted a full business plan on Friday, she said. Six teams will move on to the final round in April. 
Kempf said he is interested in seeing the report of the Lewis test ease and in helping make lighting changes to other buildings on campus if the report shows that compact fluorescent lighting can make an impact in the dorm. 
"Bather than make the hall take care of it, we'd find a way to take care of it for them," Kempf said. 
If Lewis does decide to use compact fluorescent lights, it may be a model of conserva­tion for other buildings on campus. 
"The test case in Lewis Hall provides an excellent means for illustrating how a change as simple as that of a light bulb can result in energy sav­ings and contribute to our campus conservation efforts," Coughlin said. 
Inefficient lighting is not 
only  a  concern  for  Notre  
Dame,  but  has  become  a  
national  issue  as  well.  

Congress' Clean Energy Act of 
2007 includes an item to "to 
.prohibit the sale of certain ineff'icient light bulbs, and require the development of a plan for increasing the use of more efficient light bulbs by consumers and businesses." 
Compact fluorescent light 
h ----~1- ~ ., . 

bulbs can last up to 10,000 hours, while the average incandescent bulb lasts about 750 hours, according to Kempf. The extended lifespan of compact fluorescent light bulbs cuts down on how many times the bulbs must be replaced, and thus on labor costs for replacing bulbs. 
"I think what's exciting and interesting is that we'II start to not look at things purely on a financial basis.... We now have the benefit of trying to factor in the benefits of other things: emission reductions, energy savings," Kern pf said. 
Kempf said he expects these energy conservation projects to move forward rnore once the director of the Office of Sustainability is selected. 
Trustees recently approved different positions for the Office of Sustainability, he said. The director "will build institutional learning capaci­ties to support continuous improvement in building design and operations, land­scaping, procurement, energy and water conservation, waste disposal and recycling and service provision," according to the summary report pre­pared for the Alumni Association. 
The report also explains that the purpose of the green loan fund is "to provide capi­tal for environmental improvements in both campus buildings and operations, illustrating a long-term com­mitment to sustainability efforts." 
Kempf said any environmen­tally friendly projects can apply to rec.eive money from the loan fund, and benefits and funds earned by those projects can be put back into the fund to make sure future initiatives can also be financed.

"The policy shouldn't be you can't (teach relatives!." she said. "You should do it only if there is no other way." 
While Pope-Davis empha­sized thn practice of rotating professors in and out of cours­es -in such a way that it wouldn't be difficult to maneu­ver around a relative-he said that under "extraordinary cir­cumstances" a student could apply for an exception to the rule.

China concerned about spy satellite 
BEIJING -China said Sunday it was con­cerned about U.S. military plans to shoot down a damaged spy satellite that is hurtling toward Earth with 1 ,000 pounds of toxic fuel. 
The U.S. military has said it hopes to smash the satellite as soon as next week -just before it enters Earth's atmosphere -with a single missile tin')d from a Navy cruiser in the northern Pacific Ocean. 
The official Xinhua News Agency quoted Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu .lianchao as saying the Chinese government was monitoring the situation and has urged the U.S. to avoid causing damages to security in outer space and in other countries. 
"Relevant departments of China are closely watching the situation and working .out preven­tive measures;" Liu said. Xinhua did not elabo­rate.

Georgia refinery explosion kills 9 
SAVANNAH -Dust that collected in a piece of safety equipment caused a small explosion at a sugar refinery weeks before the deadly blast that killed nine workers, a federal inves­tigator said Sunday. 
Stephen Selk, investigations manager for the 
U.S. Chemical Safety Board, had few details about the previous explosion at the Imperial Sugar refinery in Port Wentworth. He could not say whether the earlier blast contributed to the massive explosion Feb. 7. 
"It is far too early to reach conclusions about the relationship between that event and this one," Selk said. 
No one was injured in the earlier explosion, Selk said. He did not know the exact date, but said it happened "weeks ago." 
The Chemical Safety Board investigates industrial accidents for the federal govern­ment and makes safety recommendations to industry and trade groups as well as federal regulators.

Clergy adds marriage prerequisites 
FORT WAYNE -Getting married just got more complicated for couples in the Fort Wayne area. 
Clergy from 37 churches in the region signed an agreement Friday to require cou­ples to undergo counseling and take other steps aimed at increasing the chances of life­long marriages and stable families. The pact was developed by llealthy Marriages of Allen County. 
I Iealthy Marriages of Allen County is part of the Indianapolis-based Indiana Healthy Marriage and Family Coalition Inc., which last year obtained a five-year, $540,000 demon­stration project grant from President Bush's faith-based marriage promotion initiative. 

Thousands mourn NIU victims

D A orders frozen beef recall 
California slaughterhouse subject of animal abuse investigation 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -The U.S. 
Department of Agriculture on 
Sunday ordered the recall of 
143 million pounds of frozen 
beef from a California slaugh­
terhouse, the subject of an 
animal-abuse investigation, 
that provided meat to school 
lunch programs. 
Officials said it was the largest beef reeall in the United States, surpassing a 1999 ban of 35 million pounds of ready-to-eat meats. No illnesses have been linked to the newly recalled meat, and officials said the health threat was likely small. 
The recall will affect beef products dating to Feb. 1, 2006, that came from Chino­based Westland/Hallmark Meat Co., the federal agency said. 
Secretary of Agriculture Ed Schafer said his department has evidence that Westland did not routinely contact its veterinarian when cattle became non-ambulatory after passing inspection, violating health regulations. 
"Because the cattle did not receive complete and proper inspection, Food Safety and Inspection Service has deter­mined them to be unfit for human food and the company is conducting a recall," Schafer said in a statement. 
A phone message left for Westland president Steve Mendell was not immediately returned. 
Federal officials suspended operations at Westland/Hallmark after an undercover video from the 
Humane Society of the United States surfaced showing crip­pled and sick animals being shoved with forklifts. 
Two former employees were charged Friday. Five felony counts of animal cruelty and three misdemeanors were filed against a pen manager. Three misdemeanor counts ­illegal movement of a non­ambulatory animal -were filed against an employee who worked under that man­ager. Both were fired. 

Authorities said the video showed workers kicking, shocking and otherwise abus­ing "downer" animals that . were apparently too sick or injured to walk into the slaughterhouse. Some ani­mals had water forced down their throats, San Bernardino County prosecutor Michael Ramos said. 
No charges have been filed against Westland, but an investigation by federal authorities continues. 
Officials estimate that about 37 million pounds of the recalled beef went to school programs, but they believe most of the meat probably has already been eaten. 
"We don't know how much product is out there right now. We don't think there is a health hazard, but we do have to take this action," said 

Dr.  Dick  Raymond,  USDA  
Undersecretary  for  Food  
Safety.  

Most of the beef was sent to distribution centers in bulk packages. The USDA said it will work with distributors to determine how much meat remains. 

Federal regulations call for keeping downed cattle out of the food supply because they may pose a higher risk of contamination from E. eoli, salmonella or mad cow dis­ease because they typically wallow in feces and their immune systems are often weak. 
About 150 school districts around the nation have stopped using ground beef from Hallmark Meat Packing Co., which is associated with Westland. Two fast-food chains, Jack-In-the-Box and In-N-Out, said they would not 
use  beef  from  
Westland/H allmark.  
Jack  in  the  Box,  a San  

Diego-based company with restaurants in 18 states, told its meat suppliers not to use Hallmark until further notice, but it was unclear whether it had used any Hallmark meat. In-N -Out, an Irvine-based chain, also halted use of the Westland/Hallmark beef. Other chains such as McDonald's and Burger King said they do not buy beef from Westland. 
Raymond eountered a claim leveled by Humane Society President and CEO Wayne Pacelle, who said a USDA inspector was at the Westland plant for about two hours each day. USDA inspectors are there at slaughterhouses "continuously," Raymond said. 
Federal lawmakers on Thursday had called for the Government Accountability Office to investigate the safety of meat in the National School Lunch Program. 

Wildfire victims still a-waiting FEMA homes 
Associated Press 
HAMONA, Calif. -Patty Hoedy is still waiting for some­one at the Federal Emergency Management Agency to send her the mobile home she was promised before Christmas. 
In December, agency inspec­tors said she wouldn't get a government house to replaee the one she lost during last year's wildf"ires beeause it would be too difficult to haul the 60-foot, three-bedroom pre­fabrieated home up a winding road to her remote mountain­top property. 

Heedy isn't alone. FEMA brought dozens of mobile homes to Southern California after the fires, only to find their own guidelines prevented them from putting them on many properties in rough terrain. San Diego County officials say dozens of applicants were denied homes because their properties were inaccessible to trucks, didn't have conneetions into the eleetrieal grid or were on hillsides deemed at mudslide risk. 
"They don't have any famil­iarity with these areas so they can't eonceive of the needs being dil"l"erent," said Deena Haver, a contractor who was hired by San Diego County to help lirn victims. "You're talk­ing about one area with sewage and water and other places that are very rural." 
The mobile home delay is another blemish on a belea­guered agency. 
When the fires broke out in live Southern California coun­ties, forcing half a million peo­ple to flee, many thought FEMA -still bruised from its per­formance after Hurrieane Katrina -had a golden oppor­tunity to repair its image. 
But the fires blaekened about 800 square miles and destroyed nearly 2,200 homes, a fraetion of the 90,000 square miles and roughly 500,000 homes rav­aged by the hurricane, and left roads, power lines and sewage systems largely intact. 
"FEMA wasn't really tested here," said Paul Light, a profes­sor of public service at New York University. "It really was­n't a dry run for sustained response and reeovery." 
FEMA spokesman James Melntyre said the agency applied lessons it learned in Katrina to streamline its opera­tions in Southern California ­like the need to respond quick­ly. Two days before President Bush declared a federal disas­ter, FEMA crews were moving into lire-stricken zones and set­ting up at San Diego's Qualeomm Stadium.

IN BRIEF Oprah offers free e-book download 
NEW YORK -The Oprah touch doesn't just work for traditional books. 
More than 1 million copies of Suze Orman's "Women & Money" were downloaded after the announcement last week on Winfrey's televi­sion show that the e-book edition would be available for free on her Web site, www.oprah.com, for a period of 33 hours. 
"I believe 'Women & Money' is the most important book I've ever written," Orman said in a statement released Saturday by Winfrey. "So this was not about getting people to buy the book, but getting them to read it, and that was the intention behind this offer." 
The download offer "has built excitement for Suze's book across all formats," Julie Grau, the book's publisher, said in a statement. 
According to Saturday's statement from Winfrey, more than 1.1 million copies of Orman's financial advice book were down­loaded in English, and another 19,000 in Spanish. The demand compares to such free online sensations as "The 9-11 Commission Report," which the federal government made available for downloads, and Stephen King's e­novella, "Riding the Bullet." 
EPA refuses to reduce mercury 
WASHINGTON -While arguing in court that states are free to enact tougher mercury con­trols from power plants, the Bush administra­tion pressured dozens of states to accept a scheme that would let some plants evade clean­ing up their pollution, government documents show. 
A week ago, a federal appeals court struck down that industry-friendly approach for mer­cury reduction. It allowed plants with excessive smokestack emissions to buy pollution rights from other plants that foul the air less. 
Internal Environmental Protection Agency documents and e-mails, obtained by the advoca­cy group Environmental Defense, show attempts over the past two years to blunt state efforts to make their plants drastically reduce mercury pollution instead of trading for credits that would let them continue it. 
An EPA official said the agency's job "is not to pressure states." 
Economic confidence declines 
Fears of recession, high prices of gas weigh over American consumers 
FTSE 100 (London) 5:787.60 -91.70 

Associated Press  
Even when experts were  
declaring the economy  
healthy, many Americans  
voiced a vague, but persist­ 
ent dissatisfaction.  
True, jobs were relatively  
plentiful over the last few  
years. It was easy to borrow  
and very cheap. The sharp  
rise in the value of homes  
and plentiful credit cards  
encouraged a nation of con­ 
sumers to get out and buy.  
But to many people, some­ 
thing didn't feel right, even if  
they couldn't quite explain  
why.  
Now the economic tide is  
receding, and the undertow  
that was there all along is  
getting stronger.  
Take away the easy credit  
and consumers are left with  
paychecks that, for most,  
haven't nearly kept pace  
with their need and propen­ 
sity to spend.  
The frustration of $3 gas  
and $4 milk, the worries  
about health care costs that  
have risen four times the'  
rate of pay, become much  
more real. The retirement

I am certain that the majority, if not all of the people at Notre Dame, believe that violence against women is wrong, but pnrhaps disagree about the methods that can be used to stop it. My personal experience with the "Vagina Monologues" has been a very important one in the shaping of my college years, and the person who I have become. 
My freshman year, I was raped. For a number of months, I denied that it had happened and placed it out of my mind. A few months later, I joined the cast of the "Vagina Monologues," something that would come to have a monumental impact on my life. It was only then that I began down the long road of recovery and healing. I cannot stress enough how important my friends, my family and other support systems were at that time. But the "Vagina Monologues" was a dill'erent and very powerful kind of support. As a cast member, I was sur­rounded every day by these issues, and was forced to face my own healing. It was comforting to know that I was not alone, that many women all over the world had experienced violence and were living through it. It was important for me to be a part of something that gave such support to those women and to have a support system myself in the women of the 2005 cast and crew. They taught me that when I was ready, I could share my story, but that it was mine and my healing was a process that could go at my own pace. They gave me back the power and dignity that the rape had taken away. Those women, and that experience, turned my life around and brought an entirely new perspective to my then broken spirit. I can say with all certainty, that without that experience, without that support. I would not still be at this uni­versity. 
This is my experience with healing, and it's not over. Of course. for every person, this healing process is differ­ent. For many people, the "Vagina Monologues" does aid in the healing process after sexual trauma. For some people it doesn't. And for those people, I sincerely hope that they lind their own partieular path to healing. But for those pnople that it does help to heal, I hope it always finds a home here. In my experience, it was what ultimately got me through. To be in a community of women, who were working to end vio­lence against women, and who were supportive of me, whether or not they had experienced similar violence, was incredibly empowering and healing. 
The most important aspect of.all this is the discussion. This is the very rea­son the organizers wanted to. bring the play back to campus. We believe that everyone is entitled to their position on the issue of the "Vagina Monologues." 
To quote Evelyn BBatrice I I all, para­
phrasing the attitudes of Voltaire, "I 
may disagree with what you say, but I 
will defend to the death your right to 
say it." Promoting this discussion in an 
academic setting and in the context of 
the University's Catholic character, and 
studying the play in social, anthropo­
logical and psychological contexts is 
extremely important. It gnts to the core 
of what being a university is about. 
Each pnrson 's expnrience and opinion 
is different, but all should be welcomed 
in the discussion of the signilieanee or 
the Vagina Monologuns and thn issues 
surrounding it. 
This is simply my experience with healing and my opinion on the issues. My hop1~ is that in sening thn "Vagina Monologuns," if you choose to do so, you will listen. form your own opinions and share them. This diseussion only further raisns awarnnnss about vio­lencn against womnn and tnaehes us all invaluable lnssons about rnspncting other people's opinions and discussing works of art or litm·ature in an aea­demie setting. 
So thank you for your discussion and debate; this is the very rnason why this play is so important. And thank you to all thosn bravo women and men who are survivors and supporters; to those who are struggling or have struggled. You have given mn courage and a voice.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Yatarola should check fascism facts 
Most of the time, I am more than happy to be taking on the loans that are paying for my Notre Dame tuition. Sometimes, though, I wish I had settled for "two-fifty in late fees" at the local library. Reading Greg Yatarola's Feb. 12 column ("Are you fascist?") provoked such a response in me. 
To be clear, I am not writing to defend liberal values or criticize conservative ones, but rather to decry the fact that a 30-year-old man and graduate of Notre Dame could pen a piece so stunningly devoid of critical thinking. Yatarola's col­umn was tlawed from the start. One of the keys to good argument is credible sources and his choice of Jonah Goldberg and George Will -two hyper-conservative parti­sans-to asperse modern liberalism leaves much to be desired. This bias clearly affects the editorial when, like a child mimicking the arguments he heard his parents make, Yatarola unquestioningly accepts Will's "ferocity gap" claim that liberals are "meaner" than conservatives. Yet aren't lib­erals the ones branded as "hating our troops" and "baby­killers"? And was it not Ann Coulter who labeled a Democratic Presidential candidate a "faggot"? Liberals are not much, if any, better, but to claim there is some sort of large discrepancy between the groups is ignorance, whether willed or inadvertent. (Neither would surprise me.) 
Also, in making his argument, Yatarola does not examine modern conservatism very closely and dismisses any con­nection to fascism out of hand -showing his lack of under­standing of the "conservatives as fascist" argument. He argues that since conservatism was based on small govern­ment ideals, it cannot be akin to fascism. Yet, liberals do not make the fascism claim when talking about Barry Goldwater and Ron Paul, but rather the current president and somB of his congressional supporters who clearly do not base their philosophy on small government. Right or wrong, these con­servatives want to determine who people can marry and what they can put in their bodies. They want a government' so limited, in fact, that they wanted to pass legislation to tell a man he could not take his wife ofT a ventilator. Further, the PATRIOT act and its propagandist naming has caused even Republican Presidential candidate Bon Paul to use the label "totalitarianism" and draw similarities to Orwell's "1984." 
Lastly, Yatarola also forgets two tenets of fascism -a strong nationalism and a thirst for military glory. Yet, liber­als often derided for "hating" America are labeled as "peaceniks" for their opposition to war while conservatives tend to display a gung-ho version of patriotism and display a glorified "bring it on" (as President Bush saidl approach to military encounters. I have touched on a lot of issues. but my argument is not that conservatives are wrong or liberals are right on any of these subjects. I simply wished to point out that Yatarola's column. which amusingly laments "gross misunderstanding," displays an ignorance of faet and, more importantly, a lack of' comprehension of fascism and how liberals apply it to conservatives (ironically, the very thing against which he is purportedly arguing).

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Since when is exercise bad? 
Respect bishops' wishes, move 'Monologues' 
In the Feb. 14 Inside Column, Mary Kate Malone ("Be your valentine") encour­aged everyone to love their bodies by not working out. It's obviously important to love who you are whether we're talking about body image or who you are as a per­son. but that doesn't mean its impossible to love yourself and still strive to be better. I hope that no one who wanted to go for a run but then read Malone's article decid­ed that it would be wrong for them to workout. Working out is great for you as long as it's done for the right reasons. 
Everyone knows that exercise gives you endorphins and endorphins make you happy. If someone wants to lose a couple of pounds because it will make them feel better about themselves or because they get winded playing Wii Tennis, then there is nothing wrong with going for a jog or not having frozen yogurt after every meal. Along those same lines, if someone who loves their desserts is happy with their body image, then they shouldn't feel pressured into working out just because of what others think. 
My main message here is that everyone, including most of us at Notre Dame, needs to stop worrying so much about what others think. Whether you spend all 
Something is wrong here. The University is plan­ning on hosting the "Vagina Monologues" on cam­pus at the expense of a visit from our esteemed Catholic bishops. Last year our own Bishop John D'Arcy said no to the "Monologues" and the recent actions of the U.S. Catholic Conference of Bishops (USCCB) to move their theological seminar off cam­pus reiterate what our Church has been telling us all along. The "Monologues," despite its good inten­tions, "violates the truth about women, the truth about sexuality, the truth about male and female and the truth about the human body" (D' Arcy, 2005). 
We hear a lot about "discussion," but do we even stop to consider the statements of our own bishop or the actions of the USCCB? By avoiding the mis­conceptions and vulgarities contained in the "Monologues," our bishops are not trying to censor 

Yatarola oversimplifies complex political ideas 
In his column "Are you a fascist?" (Feb 12), Greg Yatarola claims that liberals are more similar to fascists than con­servatives are. Not only is this a gross oversimplification of a complex set of ideas into a single, number-line-style con­cept, but it also represents a fundamental misunderstand­ing of what that spectrum represents. 
Yatarola clearly takes offense at the fact that conser­vatism is placed closer to the fascist end of the scale of ide­ologies. This scale, however, is not meant to condemm con­servatism as fascism; there is nothing wrong with conser­vatism being "two steps away from fascism" so long as it does not cross the line. Likewise, there is no problem with liberalism sitting close to socialism on the scale. The two extreemes are both bad. Positions with some of their attrib­utes are not. Yatarola uses only one issue -gun control ­as an example of "liberal fascism." He fails to realize that, on many issues, both parties advocate regulating and not regulating things. For example, liberals tend to desire regu­lation of guns, various industries and actions that involve environmental harm, while conservatives tend to desire more regulation on issues such as flag burning, abortion and marrige. The regulation of things such as these may be seen as important, unimportant, stupid or brilliant to dif­ferent people, but none of these regulations make one group inherently "fascist." If they did, then this country would certainly be run by a fascist government no matter which party was in charge. 
Before trying to turn generally accepted political concepts upside down, Yatarola should carefully check his facts and make sure that he truly understands the issue he is trying to deal with.

but lead us into an authentic search for truth. Sam Cahill said it best in his Feb. 13 Letter to the Editor ("'Monologues' promote discussion"): "We are at Notre Dame to find the truth: Let's seek it with courage and charity, trusting that God will not mis­lead us." I, for one, wholeheartedly trust that God will not mislead us. Therefore, we must put our search for truth on the shoulders of God's Word, not Eve Ensler's "Monologues." As such, we must find a uniquely Catholic way to end violence against women and empower men and women to live in the fullness of their sexuality. For example, the Edith Stein Project is one way that the Notre Dame com­munity already discusses issues of human sexuality in a respectful and fruitful way. Saying no to the "Monologues" does not imply that we are saying no to women's issues. Instead, we respect the dignity of women so much that we must deny any material 

Climate change a 'very real' problem 
I was disappointed -but not surprised -­to read Matt Gore's Letter to the Editor ("Stop the climate change propaganda," Feb. 7). Like many in the dwindling group of people who continue to resist mounting evidence of the negative global impacts of climate change, he has chosen to downplay the severity of a very real problem. 
As any discerning reader should, Gore ques­tions the validity of the claim that climate change could cause mass extinction. He men­tions a study by Chris D. Thomas that found that only the Costa Rican Golden Toad has gone extinct due to "global climatic shifts." Being the climate change believer that I am, I double­checked this citation. To my surprise, however, in the first line of Thomas's report "Extinction Risk from Climate Change" (Nature, 2004, Vol. 427, p. 145), the author concedes that indeed, climate change has caused the extinction of only one species over the last three decades. But alas! All is not well for Gore, for later on the same page of the same report, Thomas states that even in the minimum expected cli­mate change scenarios (read: inevitable), between nine and 31 percent of species are predicted to go extinct, depending on their dis­persal abilities. While I grant that nine to 31 percent of species is not most or all of the glob­al species community, the climate change­induced extinction of such a significant portion of global biodiversity would be a large blood stain on the hands of humanity. 
Gore also argues against the claim that cli­mate change will threaten the existence of life on Earth. He is right to point out that species have persisted through more intense climate changes than are expected in the next few cen­turies. I agree -just look at cockroaches. The larger point at hand, however, is not how life in general will fare, but individuals. Although the majority of species, including Homo sapiens, could likely persist through expected climate change scenarios, individuals of those species night in the library because of some quiz that is only worth five percent of your grade, you climb the StairMaster for four straight hours at Rolfs trying to look like a model so that other people will think you're hot or if you get super upset because you get called out on the fact that your liberal views are borderline fascist, every­one needs to stop taking every little detail so seriously. Ronald Reagan didn't save America from communism for everyone to live their lives in fear of being judged for being themselves. Reagan fought to sustain a nation where people are free to be unique and to only care about how they look if they want to care about how they look. I think Peter La Fleur summed it up pretty well when he said: "You're perfect just the way you are. But if you feel like losing a few pounds, getting healthier and making some good friends in the process, then Joe's is the place for you."

that attempts to empower women through sin. 
This is a wake up call, Notre Dame. If our own Church officials refuse to even step foot on our campus, something has got to be wrong. Our bish­ops sincerely said no to the "Monologues" because they see something that no one else apparently sees: encouraging promiscuity is not the way to end violence against women. The "Monologues" should be moved back off campus so there is no confusion on where we stand. Let's come to our senses, listen to our bishops and help end violence against women through embracing our Catholicity. not shunning it. 
Craig Borchard senior Morrissey Manor Feb. 14 

may not emerge unscathed. As Professor Darcia Narvaez hinted in her Feb. 5 letter ("A call to conserve"), there is widespread accept­ance among the scientific community that cli­mate change will severely and adversely affect many human communities. 
Admittedly, most reports acknowledge that certain areas of the world could benefit: Some economies may boom as agriculture yields increase with warmer weather and reduced precipitation in some areas may limit transmis­sion of diseases like malaria. The cost for other communities, however, will be profound. As we all have heard from various media sources, people around the world are at risk for reduced water supply in already water-stressed areas, loss of arable land due to increased tempera­tures, and massive flooding due to sea-level rise. (For a detailed summary, read the execu­tive summaries of reports by the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.) The potential consequences of climate change, even if only potential, are not to be taken lightly. While I appreciate Gore's ultimate agreement that we should take steps to con­serve energy, I worry that his resistance to the potential consequences of climate change is indicative of a mindset that denies sans reason the gravity of our situation. By labeling people who voice concern as "fear mongerers" and by exaggerating their claims, naysayers in the dis­cussion prevent others from working to curb human-induced climate change. If we are going to make a positive difference, however, we all must work together. It is true that no one knows the future and the exact impacts of cli­mate change, or how severe they will be. Personally, however, I choose to err on the side of caution.

CONCERT BRINGS CHILDHOOD NOSTALGIA BACK TO FANS 
On Friday night my fifth grade dreams came true at the Spice Girl<; concert in Chicago. When I found out that my favorite girl group of the 90s was reuniting for a world tour, I was desperate to get tickets. I missed the boat tl1n first time around and I wasn't

Scene & Heard

Judging from the sold-out concort, I was­n't the only one who refused to let this opportunity pass by. I have an odd l~)eling that this is the last and only Spiee Girls rew1ion tour we're going to see. For some reason I can't picture Scary, Sporty, Ginger, Posh and Baby wailing "Wannabe" and rocking about "girl power" at ages 45 or 50. 
The crowd was overwhelmingly lacking children and boys. Ten years ago, the United Center would have been packed with junior high girls wearing plattbrm shoes and glitter. All those tweens were now grown up and buying beer at the concession stands. (Interesting side note: A 20-year-old offered me $20 to buy her an $8 beer before the con­eert began. I refused not only because I didn't feel like breaking the law that night, but more importantly, I wanted to teach her a lesson not to buy $8 beers). 
But let's not forget to mention the merchan­dise frenzy. People were dropping $50 for concert T-shirts like it was nobody's business. I ended up with an adorable mug, a program and a poster I was suckered into buying after the coneert was over (it was only $10). I won­der how many of those people buying T-shirts are actually going to wear them in public. As proud as I am to be a Spice Girls fan. I don't think I would ever dare to go that far to show my support. 
The concert started about 30 minutes late, but that's to be expected. The anticipation was almost too much for me: I had been waiting 11 years to see my girls on stage and I was getting a little emotional and was scaring my friend. Judging by my reaction to when the Spiee Girls finally appeared, there's no way that I'll flver be able to go to a Mariah Carey concert and come out completely healthy. 
The girls started with "Spice Up Your life" and fi>llowed that with "Stop." It was comfort­ing being in an arena full of people who knew as many of the words to the songs as I did. We were sitting in the 300 level, which gave us a bird's eye view of the stage and the opportuni­ty to look out pver the entire crowd and see how much fun (woryonn wa'i having. Some

slideshow in thn ba(:kf,rround. It wa'i a tendnr 
moment, but I wa'i morn eoneerned with the 
fact that I just saw Eddie Murphy's baby and 
the Beekham boys. 
I appreciated that they never trind to gloss ovrw a pivotal pmi ol' their hi'itory: Ginger's early departurn from the group. At tl1e end of "Viva Forever," Ginger (who evnn dawned her Union Jack sparkling lnotard at one point in ilic evnning), descended through a trap door, leaving Scary, Sporty, Posh and Baby -the four who worked on a third album togetl1er­to perform "Make You.Hollr.r," a single from that album. 
Ginger (Geri Halliwell) wasn't gone for long, though. She emerged solo in the next number to sing her remake of"lt's Haining Men" from her second solo album, which appeared on the "Bridget Jones's Diary" soundtrack. Sporty (Mel C) came out next and perfi>rmed two of her solo hits befhre the Jive Spiee Girl<; reunit­ed on tho stage once again. The Spice Girls were smart. to recognize their solo careers and to not ignore tlmir, at times, tumultuous hi'>tory. 
Of course the song everyone was waiting to hear-"Wannabe"-did not eome until tl1e encore, but once it did come, I wa'> completely taken back to my childhood. I found myself thinking of all the times I had listened to that first CD as a child. I remembered getting the CD fhr my birthday to go wiili my new boom box. I remembered sitting in my room and lis­tening to tl1e songs over and over again so I could learn the lyrics. I remembered taking pati in that Spiec Girl<;-ba<;hing pha<;e, but then I remembernd linally embracing my love and fandom lor them. Admitting that I was a fan finally led me to their concert Friday.

RISQUE SHOW 'SPICES' UP UNITED CENTER 
Walking into Chicago's United Center for the Spice Girls concert Friday night was, I can only imagine, very similar to going to a Cher concert. There were almost as many men in teeny-tiny out­f"its and heels as there were women

drag queens in attendance were four dressed as the Spice Girls, something I expected of the girls in attendance, not the boys. There was also a man dressed up as Wonder Woman, which may or may not have been a tribute to "Spice World" the movie, in which one of the girls dresses up as Wonder Woman for a photo shoot. 
Not every male in attendance was dressed in drag; there were, surprising­ly, several groups of guys scattered throughout the arena dressed perfectly normally. These were definitely the minority, though. 
By the time the five Spice Girls rose to the stage and began the concert with "Spice Up Your Life," I had already seen more sequins, leop­ard print, pigtails, and crimped hair, on girls and guys, than I ever wanted to. 
For their part, the Spice Girls them­selves seemed more than aware that their fan base had grown up. The show featured quite a bit more risque impli­cations than would've been expected of the girls when they were catering to the 12-year-old audience of the 1990s. 
Though not every act featured it, the girls demonstrated the sexual nature of their songs. During "Two Become One," the girls danced on platforms with candy-striped stripper poles while dancers used feathered wings for accompaniment. 
In Scary Spice Melanie Brown's solo act, an unsuspecting man was strapped to her "machine," a giant metallic "A" shaped stand. "He has no idea what I'm going to do," she said while she danced around the stage in her signature leop­ard print with a whip singing "Are You

Gonna Go My Way" by Lenny Kravitz. The song concluded with Brown run­ning up to her prisoner and mimicking oral sex before the lights went down. 
During the song "Holla" which was released after Ginger Spice (Geri Halliwell) left the group, the four Spice Girls got extremely touchy-feely with the dancers. At one point they walked down the "catwalk" portion of the stage with the four male dancers crawling in front of them on leashes. 
Despite being in their 30s, all five sported the same type of skimpy outfits they wore during the 90s. In the open­ing few songs, the girls all wore metal­lic-inspired outfits that mimicked their signature styles. 
For "Lady is a Vamp," the Spice Girls sported 1940s lounge inspired outfits · which included Halliwell wearing what 
appeared to be a man's dress coat. They also sport­ed classic outfits. such as Posh Spice (Victoria Beckham) wearing her usual tight little dresses and Halliwell wearing her well­known Union Jack dress.

NASCAR 

Associated Press 
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -Ryan Newman snapped an 81-race winless streak Sunday, using a huge push from teammate Kurt Busch to give car owner Roger Penske his first Daytona 500 victory. 
Penske, the most suc­cessful owner in open­wheel history with 14 wins in the prestigious Indianapolis 500, now has a victory in NASCAR's showcase event. 
It only took him 23 years to get it. 
It came in the historic 50th running of The Great American Race, and it came in thrilling fashion. 
"We did something very special for the Captain tonight," runner-up Kurt Busch said. 
The Penske cars were quiet for 199 of the 200 laps, letting Joe Gibbs Racing stars Tony Stewart and Kyle Busch race each other in a battle of Toyotas. With one lap to go, it appeared Stewart finally would get a Daytona 500 win in his 10th try. 
Running out front in the high line, he held off the two Penske cars as they circled the famed speed­way. With a pair of team· mates closing in on him, Stewart didn't feel safe running out alone with no allies. 
So at the last second, he dropped low on the track to line up in front of Kyle Busch. The JGR teams had talked about using team­work all week, and Stewart thought he'd need Busch to make it to the checkered flag. 
But the decision back­fired when the two Penske cars flew past him on the top, and Newman pulled away for his first win since New Hampshire in September 2005. 
"I just made the wrong decision on the back­stretch," a dejected Stewart said. "My inten· tion was to get in front of Kyle and pull Kyle along with us. It's hard to explain. It's probably one of the most disappointing moments in my racing career." 
And for Joe Gibbs Racing and the entire Toyota camp. 
Toyota seemed destined to win its first points race in NASCAR's top series behind the strength of JGR, which joined the manufacturer this season and gave it instant credi­bility. After a strong month of testing and a Denny Hamlin win in one of. Thursday's qualifying races, the JGR cars seemed poised to battle mighty Hendrick Motorsports for the win.

But, now, entl~ring tim final year of that infitmous eight-year, $121 million deal he signed with Colorado in 200 I, the 35-ynar-old !Iampton is back on the mound, trying til show in the early days of spring training that he's still got a little something left in that scarred­up pitl:hing arm.

A cynic might lind it hard to muster a whole lot of sympathy for li<unpton. After all, those big pay­chocks kept on coming, and he's duo to make $15 million this sea­son, no matter how much he pitch­es (or doesn't pitch). 
Then again, it wasn't his fault that Colorado doled out such a foolish contract, or that I Iampton's sinker-heavy repertoire just wasn't cut out filr the Mile High City. He can even laugh about his experi­ence with the Rockies.

''I'm sure he'll be rusty a little bit," Cox said. "But we're not look­ing for that. We're looking for health." 
Actually, the aborted stint in Mexico boosted Hampton's confi­dence. His arm didn't hurt, and when he watched a video of the inning that popped up on YouTube, he was relieved to see that his mechanics looked basically the same as they did before all the injuries. 
"It's like Smoltz told me, 'Dude, you don't forget how to pitch,"' !Iampton said. "It's like a bieyde. You don't forget how. You might need a refresher course, but you don't forget how. When I saw that video, I was like, 'Dude, you look just like you did before.' I'm fine."

Belles svvitn to fifth in MIAA Championships 
Calvin takes top spot, Hope earns second 
By PETE REISENAUER 
SportS Writer 

Saint Mary's ended its season with a disappointing fifth-place finish in the MIAA Championships this weekend in Holland, Mich. 
Calvin won the meet with a score of 660. Hope was the only close challenger at 556. Saint Mary's finished with a score of 182. 
Going into the weekend, the Belles had high hopes after posting top times in many events during the season. They felt that they were primed to make a push toward the top of the pack. 
The Belles had finished the year with a four-meet losing streak but believed that the two weeks between their last meet and the championship would provide them vital time to rest and prepare for the event this weekend. They were not able to put in a strong enough effort to capture the crown. 
Despite the loss, Melissa Gerbeth defended her 1,650­yard freestyle crown with a

time of 17:47.50, beating her closest competitor by more than 10 seconds. She also reached the final in the 500 freestyln -whore she eventu­ally finished sixth -and the 400 freestyle, whern she fin­ished fourth. 
Maggie Williams also helped her team with a fifth-place fin­ish in the 100 backstroke. She also finished 1Oth in the 200 backstroke. 
Meanwhile, freshman Caroline Arness had her best showing in the 200 backstroke with a time of 2:18.62, and fel­low freshman Casey NiezPr clocked in at 2:13.77 for a sixth place finish. Niezer also fin­ished in 11th in the 100 back­stroke. 
Sophomore Lindsey Nelis put up a strong showing in the 1,650 freestyle with a time of 18:38.40. 
The strongest relay for the Belles was the 400 freestyle team, whieh finished third, only one-tenth of a second behind Kalamazoo for second.

Saint Mary's blasts Kala111azoo 
Kessler scores 22 as Belles ride 34-8 run to blowout victory 
By GRIFFIN DASSATTI Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's was actually down four to Kalamazoo at one point in its 71-39 win Saturday. 
Then, five and a half min­utes into the game, the Belles (10-12, 6-8 MIAA) decided it was time to start playing. 
With 14:37 left in the first half and the score tied at 8­8, Saint Mary's senior guard Alison Kessler scored two of her game-high 22 on a layup. It was the last time Kalamazoo (4-18, 1-13 MIAA) sniffed the lead. 
That's because Kessler's layup began a 34-8 Saint Mary's run that sent the Belles into the locker room with a 42-15 lead. 
Sophomore forward Anna 


Kammrath, who pulled down a game-high 12 rebounds to go along with her six points, said the Belles' success in the first half was a result of the team's laid-back style. 
"We were definitely more relaxed [than in previous games]. which is easier to do when everyone was clicking," Kammrath said. 
In the second half, the Belles continued their dom­inance. The Hornets never got within 26 points, and many of Saint Mary's reserves saw the court for the latter portion of the game. 
The blowout victory was a big change for the Belles, who have an average mar­gin of victory of 6.6 points in their MIAA wins this season. 
Belles junior guard Katie 
Rashid finished with 13 points, and classmate Erin Newsom netted 11 to go along with seven rebounds. The Belles also got a solid performance from fresh­man guard Liz Wade, who scored seven points, grabbed seven rebounds and had seven assists off the bench. 
Kammrath said after the game that the win was a big one for the Belles, especially with the end of the MIAA season coming closer. 
"[Getting this win] means we are for sure playing on Tuesday once [the] confer­ence [tournament] starts next week," Kammrath said. "It also helps team morale, a win like this."

(7-1) to snag a 6-2 win in the opener on Friday. 

"It was important to get our feet wet," Gumpf said. "It was a good chance to see where our problems are in a real game situation." 
Junior Brittney Bargar got the win, allowing three hits and two earned runs in seven innings. Bargar fanned six and surrendered two solo homeruns for Utah's only scores of the game. 
The offense slugged 10 hits off the Utes and opened the game with a four-run first inning. Freshman Brianna Jorgensborg ripped a three­run double down the right­field line in the first at-bat of her college career. Fellow freshman Sadie Pitzenberger went 3-for-5 and stole three bases. 
Western Kentucky beat Notre Dame 6-5 and scored the final run after an Irish throwing error in the seventh inning. 
"We lost due to some things that are really controllable," Gumpf said. "We have some growing pains that we need to work on." 
The Irish jumped out to a 3-1 lead off a Pitzenberger double and a sophomore Christine Lux sacrifice fly, but the lead would not stand. 
Western Kentucky's Rebecca Horesky hit a grand slam off of freshman Jody Valdivia to give the Hilltoppers a 5-3 advantage. 
Sophomore Heather Johnson tied the game at 5-5 in the seventh with a two-run homer, but the Hilltoppers responded for the win. 
The Irish lost 4-1 to the fearsome Aggies. 
Bargar kept Texas A&M scoreless through four innings, before allowing three earned runs in the final three frames. Bargar also struck-out nine. 
"Brittney really gave us a chance to win both games," Gumpf said. "It was just three or four pitches that went wrong for her." 

The final game on Sunday against Cal was a chance for the Irish to make up for the previous day's mistakes, and they took full advantage. Senior second baseman Katie Laing went 2-for-4 and had RBis, including a two-run homer in the third inning to propel the Irish to a 4-3 comeback win. 
In the bottom of the sev­enth, Laing showed her poise in the clutch, knocking the first pitch she saw into right­center field to plate freshman Katie Fleury. 
"Katie really led this team all weekend," Gumpf said. "She single-handedly scored three runs for us in the last game and led the team to vic­tory." 

The Irish will spend the week working on the little things before traveling to Gainesville, Fla., next week­end to participate in the Aquafina Invitational.

Irish earn two-game sweep 
Wins over Wisconsin, South Florida put ND back on track 
By LORENZO REYES and DAN MASTERTON Sports Writers 
For now. at least, No. 14 Notre Dame is back on track. 
After struggUng to a pair of loss­es last week, the Irish swept Wisconsin and No. 31 South Florida at home .this weekend. With the defeat of its Big East rival, Notre Dame (6-4) is now rid­ing a three-game winning streak. 
Irish head coach Jay Louderback thinks his team is swinging on all cylinders. 
"I feel like we've gotten better every match," he said. "We've become tougher and tougher as the matches go on. We played some soUd competition this week­end and we'rn looking to build on our momentum." 
Notre Dame 7, Wisconsin 0 
Despite playing without senior captain Brook Buck, the Irish cruisnd to victory Friday, sweeping No. 74 Wisconsin, 7-0. 
With Buck injured, the Irish lineup shifted around and ofTered opportunities for the players to contribute in dillimmt slol'i. 
Sophomore Kali Krisik moved up to No. 1 doubles with junior Keley Tefl't, and the pair started the Irish dominance with an 8-3 victory. Sophomore pair Cosmina Ciobanu and Colleen Hielley moved up to No. 2 doubles and secured the doubles point with a swift 8-2 win. 
The Notre Dame singles attack won each match handily. Despite the lineup changes, the Irish won all six matches in straight sets with no Wisconsin player winning more than three games in a set. 

Junior Katie Potts started sin­gles play with a 6-2, 6-0 vietory, and Ciobanu and Rielley followed suit with convincing wins to dinch the match for Nolre Dame. 
Having won the match, there was no pressure as freshman Kristin Hafael, who primarily plays No. 2 or 3 doubles, made her singles debut in the No. 6 slot. Rafael took advantage of the opportunity and easily disposed or her opponent 6-1, 6-2. 
The sncond half of singles play also included wins from Krisik and Tefl't. 
TefTt played No. 1 singles fiJr the second straight day and is now 2­0 from that slot for the dual sea­son and a perfect 9-0 in singles overall. ller 6-3, 6-0 win finished the 7-0 sweep for the Irish. and five loyal fans celebrated the win for Tef'!l and the Irish with tradi­tional student seetion push-ups. 
It was Notre Dame's second straight 7-0 victory over Wisconsin. The Irish improved to 3-0 at home and broke the .500 mark for the first time since a sea­son-opening win over Louisville. 
Notre Dame 6, South Rorida 1 

Looking to complete the week­end sweep, the only thing left for the Irish to take care of wa'i South Florida. 
With a victory against the Bulls, the Irish remained undcfeatnd in Big East play, and improved their overall record to 6-4. 
Louderback said doubles play was key in the victory. 
"We're feeling really good about our doubles play," Louderback said. "We played really well. We won all but one match all week­end. I'm especially impressed with our No. 2 and 3 spots really stepped it up. Brook and Kelcy have been playing well all year, so it wa'i good to sec our other pairs playing well." 
Buck returned to action and paired up with Tefl't to eomprise the No. 3 team in the nation, defeating sophomore pair Allyn Mueller and Jessiea Zok 8-0. 
Krisik and Hafael sealed the doublns point with an 8-2 win over Janette Bnjkova and Natalia Guevara. 
''I'm impressed with the play of our f'rnshman, Kristen Hafael," Louderback said. "She played real well all wnnkend. I think she gained a little confidence winning her singles match against Wisconsin, and that carried over into the rest of the wonk." 
Ciobanu and Hinllny upnnded junior lcri Hai and snnior Liz Cruz X-5 in the final doubles match. 
No. 62 Ciobanu beat Mueller 6­1, 6-2, and No. 64 Buck dropped the lirst two games of tlw lirst set but turned her play around against Zok for a 6-2, 6-0 victory. 
No. X2 Potts secured the third win of the wnekend with lwr 6-3, 6-3 dnfnat of Hai. 
Notre Damn will travnl to Durham, N.C. to face a surging Duke tnam Thursday. The Blue Devils topped No. 6 Florida earlier in the week, and Louderback is not taking them Ughtly. 
"Duke is going to be a tough, tough match up," he said. " ... They're really under ranked. With their talent, they arn definitely a top live team, so we have a tough test ahead of ourselves."

Associated Press 
NEW ORLEANS -In a proud city still restoring its unique beauty, the Eastern Conference repaired its own image. 
Ray Allen scored 28 points, making three straight 3-point­ers in the final 3:15, and LeBron James added 27 as the East, widely considered the NBA's weaker half, beat the Western Conference 134-128 in Sunday night's All-Star Game. 
Last year, the West humiliat­ed the East in a 153-132 rout in Las Vegas when Kobe Bryant and Co. rewrote the event's record books. However, this time led by Allen's 14 fourth-quarter points and a stunning dunk by James with 55 seconds left, the East sal­vaged some pride and can return to the season's second half with bragging rights. 
James, who added nine assists and eight rebounds, was the MVP for the second time in three years. He also won the honor in 2006. 
"We didn't want to come out here and get beat up on again," James said. 
Amare Stoudemire, Brandon Roy and Carmelo Anthony scored 18 points apiece to lead the West, which trailed by 13 entering the fourth quarter and rallied behind New Orleans' Chris Paul. The guard's seventh assist of the final period set up Roy's layup to give the West a 122-119 lead. 
But Boston's Allen, the final player added to either roster, knocked down his second 3­pointer in 48 seconds to tie it before Paul answered with a 3 
of his own. sending the home­town crowd into a frenzy.  
Allen finally missed and James poked away the ball, and then came up with the night's most stirring moment. Slashing through the lane, Cleveland's megastar rose and  
dunked over several West defenders, much like he did in  
Game 5 of last year's Eastern Conference finals in Detroit when he scored the Cavaliers'  
final 25 points.  
Paul was called for an offen­sive foul on the West's next trip. Dwyane Wade hit a layup  
and Allen scored to make it 131-125. Roy's 3-pointer with  
8. 7 seconds brought the West within three, but Allen made  
three free throws to close it  
out.  
The weekend in New Orleans was about much more than spectacular dunks, a, game  
featuring marginal defense or collecting strings of beads  
while strolling down boozy Bourbon Street. The NBA came to the Big Easy hoping to help this special city continue  
its comeback from Hurricane Katrina, the effects of wnich  
are still being felt 2? years since she blasted through.  
On  Friday,  the  world's  
biggest basketball names as well as hundreds of volunteers  
fanned out to all sides of the city to help refurbish play­ 
grounds, paint houses and  
lend a hand with whatever they could on a day devoted to community service.  
Many of the players were moved by the experience and  
came  away with  a  greater  
sense of what the area has gone through and the monu­mental work that lies ahead in the Gulf Coast Region.

While Notre Dame was busy shooting, the Nanooks were busy scoring in the first period Saturday. After an apparent Adam Lee goal at 6:22 of the period was wiped off due to interference on Pearce, Alaska made its next chance count.

"That was critical." McGraw said. "We really needed that, especially at tlw Pnd after being ti1~d. we had a couple of grnat stops. We did some nicn things on the boards." 

Charel Allen led the Irish with 22 points and 12 rPbounds. It was the lirst time an Irish player had had at least 20 points and 10 rebounds since Allen did it last season, on Feb. 11 against DePaul. 
"This was the best game of hPr Big East season," McGraw said. "She was aggressive, she was looking for her shot. and she took care of the ball. She was wire to wire the best play­er on the floor."

Notre Dame had previously used a box-and-one against Marquette to shut down Golden Eagles guard Krystal Ellis. 
Notre Dame led 58-51 with
