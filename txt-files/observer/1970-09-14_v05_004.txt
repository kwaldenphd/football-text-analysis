PHNOM PENH (UPI) A 4,000 man Cambodian task force carrying out CamboJia 's largest military operation of the war fought its way into the southern portion of Tang J.;:auk yesterday in daylong battle a­gainst Viet Cong troops. 
The Communists continued to hold the center of the city, 52 miles north of Phnom Penh, at nightfall. A Cambodian officer said some of them were in a pagoda that was spared from bombardment because it was sacred ground. 
American C 119 Shadow gun­ships firing machine guns sup­ported the Cambodian attack. 
In Saigon, military sources said heavy fighting had broken out around the besieged South Vietnamese firebase O;Reilly' 390 miles nort~ of Saigon. 
The sources said North Viet­namese gunners sh,elled the fire­base with at least )50 rounds of 82 mm and 120mm mortar fire Saturday and continued the bombardment at a slower rate yesterday. 
A battalion of South Viet­

namese brought in by helicopter clashed with a battalion sized unit of North Vietnamese south ut O'Reilly and reported killing I 0 of the Communists, the sources said. They said the gov­ernment unit suffered "light" losses. 
O'Reilly has been under seige 

since July 1, and some sources 
say government forces may 
abandon it. 
The battle at Tang Kauk was 

the first heavy engagement for 
the Cambodian task force that 
set out six days earlier from 
Skoun, 17 miles to the south, to 
drice through the heart of Viet 
Cong bases and bivouac areas. 
Brig. Gen. Neak Sam, com­

manding the operation, said five 
Cambodians were killed in the 
fithting and at least 25 wound­ed. Military officers said seven dead Viet Cong were found and many other dead and wounded were carried off. 
The Cambodians pinned down in an open rice paddy by heavy Viet Cong fire as they entered the city said the Viet Cong force was estimated to be 600, equi­valent to a reinforced battalion. 
The initial Cambodian assault was stopped just inside the city limits, but in the late afternoon following strong aircraft b<'mb­ardments the Cambodia1:s drove to with in 700 yards of the city center. 
The Viet Cong were in well prepared positions with over head cover of sheet metal roof­ing, concrete blocks and mud for protection against air strikes. 
For the first time, Cambodia used its own helicopters, on loan from the United States, to evacuate casualties~---­
The task force was without artillery support when it began the assault, but late in the day the Cambodians brought 122mm Russian-made howitzers to the front.

law and order and would protect 
the rights of an individual no 
matter what the effect on so­
ciety." 
Stevenson, asked how he would label himself within the Democratic party, said: "I reject labels. They are misleading. It makes more sense for candidates 

for public office to talk about 
what they stand for. If I had to 
label myself, I think it would be 
as a progressive." 

At another point, Stevenson 
was asked about extremists in 
the party and said, "I have no 
relationship with any extremists 
in the Democratic party. I don't 
think that there are any extreo­
mists in the Democratic party, 
not in my stat-e of Illinois. We 
are making progress toward open 
ing the doors of the party but 
not to extremists.' 

Asked directly what wa~ his 
stand on busing, Stevenson said, 
"I don't think force busi.tg is 
foing to solve any problems and 
in some instances is counter pro­
ductive to good relations be­
tween the races. We ought o 
address ourselves to the central 
question of the quality of our 
schools." 

On campus unrest, Smith said, 
"The great majority of students 
go to college to learn. I have 
advocated getting those who are 
there to bum rather than learn 
off the campuses and leaving the 
other 95 per cent . 

Smith, asked whether he ex­
pects President Ni l{On to cam­
paign for him in person, said 
"Oh, I expect he will." 

Stevenson, asked whether he h-td the whole-hearted support ..,[ Chicago Mayor Richard J. Oaley, said "I certainly hope so." He said he has the support of all level Democrats in Illinois but most importantly "Demo­crats at the grass roots level." 
He described Daley as a major asset in his campaign.

Registration confusion 
Praisers of St. Mary's College are often fond of enumerating the many advantages associated with having a small college with a relatively small enrollment. In a small community it is supposed to be easier to get something accomplished rather than in a large community wher e peop 1 e are referred to as 934567890. 
Last week's confusion at Registration is unbelievable when one considers how large universities carry on the same procedures much more efficiently and far more quickly. The most unfortunate aspect of registration occurred when the freshmen attempted to register and it is surprising that many of them didn't pack up and go home after that experience. 
Perhaps the mistake on many of the freshmen's schedules, giving them less than fifteen credit hours, can be dismissed as a unique computer joke which will never happen again. But there still remains much of the registration process which could be constructively criticized. 
The most obvious problem occurs in September when all of the freshmen, with all of their questions and troubles, are chanelled into only one office, the Academic Dean's. Freshmen advisers should be assigned before the freshmen come in September, and tbe advisers, preferably from the faculty, should be authorized to make changes in the freshmen schedules. This would make the add and drop procedure much easier and would leave the important and immediate problems, ·such as transfer students with no schedules, to the Academic Dean. 
The freshmen also suffer from lack of academic advice concerning what courses they should take, especially if they already know what area they will major in. Perhaps this suggested advisor, who would again be available to them before classes begin, would also avert this problem 
The ease with which the upperclassmen register and make changes in their schedules is primarily due to the fact that they can go to their respective department chairman and have him authorize their changes instead of the Academic Dean. As the freshmen class continually gets larger a more efficient method of registration should be developed. 
Finally, the fee to add and drop courses during registration is archaic and if ND can get by without charging students for this service, why cannot SMC.

High Country Soliloquy 
by T. C. Treanor 

Once upon a time, the prince of the High Country decided to visit his cousins on the lowlands. He had never visited the lowlands, and he was anxious to find how they differed from the People of His Kingdom. 
But when he got there, he was struck and saddened by the amount of war, sickness, and strife prevalent. 
This was very bad stuff indeed, he decided, and he went back to the High Country, badly beset. 
For three days he prayed and meditated; then, he made his decision. He went to the Wisest Man In the Whole City, and beseeched him, in earnest tones, to tell him how to bring peace to the world. 

A cymcal Jeer began to touch the face of the Wisest Man In the Whole City as the prince began to explain his early hopefulness, and the leer tolk progressively greater control as the Prince expressed his shock and horror with what he saw; but with a massive effort the Wisest Man In the Whole City composed his features as the Prince came to the -nd of his tale and asked his question: "How may I bring peace to the world?" 
"Well, the first thing you do, sweetheart," The Wisest Man In the Whole City said, pondering the question, "is divest yourself of your royal rainments. Wear these clothes, as I do, instead." He handed the Prince a pair of old jeans and a "Spiro Agnew is Mickey Mouse" sweatshirt. 
"Don't shave, cut your hair, or take a bath. Look as bizzare as you possibly can,"he continued. "Get a whole bunch of young people to go around with you; looking like you and acting like you. Be sure there's plenty of fornication in the group; that's good stuff and it'll blow all the warmaking minds. I want you to get everybody to smoke grass in public, too; that also will have quite an impact." 
"And will that bring peace to the world?" the Prince asked hopefully. 
"And that will bring peace to the world." The Wisest Man In the Whole City· sollemly assured him. Then he hesitated. "Oh-take this, too." He handed him a guitar. 
"But I don't know how to play a guitar" the Prince protested. "Loudly,"the Wisest Man In the Whole City assured him. So the Prince went down to the lowlands, 


~:----~--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~------------------~~--------------------------~----~--~--~ 
gathered a band of other young people around 
him, and sang, fornicated, and got high in an 
atmosphere of festive joviality. Unfortunately, the 
people that were involved in all this war weren't 
paying any attention to the Prince at all, except in 
a most derogatory sense. All his publicity was 
adverse. People inGovernment and business were 
avoiding him like the plague. The were exchanging 
snide comments behind his back. 
After three years in the lowlands, the Prince 
returned to the High Country for another 
conference with the Wisest Man In the Whole City. 
"I don't understand it," the Wisest Man said, "we 
had music, drugs, and sex. What went wrong?" 
The Wisest Man pondered this for some time, 
and then finally said,-"Violence! You have to get 
those kids to defy their parents-something they've 
wanted to do for a long time!" 
"You mean like,'Y ou must leave your father 
and your mother and follow me?' " 
"No, more like, 'If you want to be part of the revolution, you must be ready to kill your parents.' " 
So the Prince went down to the lowlands, and he and his group once again gathered together. The Prince told his friends what the Wisest Man In the Whole City said, and they all agreed that that was a r.ood Course Of Action. 
So they all went among the people of the lowlands, singing and smoking and fornicating like before, but this time saying, "If you want to be part of the revolution, you must be ready to kill your parents." 
And lo! The people in the lowlands became very nervous, and one day the Prince and all his friends had their heads busted and were sent. to jail for seven years. 
A few days later, a courier ran up to tht High Country and spoke to the Wisest Man In the Whole City. "They have captured the Prince," he breathed, "and they are coming to invade the City!" 
The Wisest man did not have to think twice to know who "they" were. He prepared for the Gotterdammerung. 
"I wonder how he could blow it?" he asked himself, though, as plants he owned began production of peace medallions, guitars, and posters captioned-"The Prince-He Lives!"· 


Guy De Sapio------­
The Hijackings 
The Palestinian guerrillas have a hell of a lot of nerve. And that 
seems to be all that you need these days if you want to stop the 
world and make everyone feel that they want to get off. 
If you've got something you want and you don't have any 
scruples about the means you use to obtain it you can buy yourself a 
shotgun, a hand grenade, and a holster, and pick up some innocent 
bystander who doesn't have anything to do with your problem and 
threaten to kill or maim him. After all, if the world is treating you 
inhumanly, you might as well act like an animal to prove that 
everyone was right in the first place. 
So far the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine has 
succeeded in making living n·,iserable for close to 300 men, women 
and children whom they held as hostages and for countless numbers 
of relatives waiting for news of their condition. They've bullied the 
governments of Switzerland, England and the United States. Toyed 
with the International Red Cross and almost destroyed the Middle 
East peace talks which is their immediate goal; second only to their 
ultimate goal of throwing the lsrae!is out of Palestine. 
Saturday they blew up a 707, a DC-8, and VC-10 feeding the ulcers of the members of Lloyd's of London and the Chairmen of the Boards of Swiss Air, Trans World and BOAC. Pan Am had already sat amazingly watching newsreel films of their shiny new 747 crumble after explosives blew holes in her side. To one who isn't sympathetic to the financial giants of the world the loss of the planes might be taken in stride. But add to the destruction the fact that passengers on the 747 were only given minutes to run from the plane. Threats of blowing up the remaining planes with passengers aboard were almost kept as forty hostages were left on the three jets until I 5 minutes before the explosives went off. The word insane 
becomes too kind to apply ·to the guerillas. 
Wars have been started for a lot less than the actions that have 
surrounded the air piracy of the past week. An assasination ignited 
World War I; the sinking of a ship, the Spanish-American War. Of 
course, other conditions were just right too, but if the stage is set 
anywhere it is set in the Middle East. 
A 90-day cease-fire and the opening of peace talks using a U.S. plan for guidelines raised hopes that the situation could be rectified peacefully. Alleged Egyptian violations of the cease-fire and stand­still dimmed hopes a little but not enough to make the situation extremely tense once again. Things were going too well for the PFLP which will stand for no political settlement which would allow Israel to continue to exist. 
And so the plane hijackings, sporadic raids on Israel, and the instigation of a Civil War in Jordan. The hijackings are designed to prod the U.S. into getting actively involved militarily in the situation. One guerrilla leader stated that the PFLP hoped the U.S. would get involved so that they could take care of us like the Viet Cong are in Viet Nam. Only thing this time they won't be jumping out from behind bushes or down out of the trees, they will be lurking in every airport in the world and committing selective acts of terrorism here in America as well as abroad. 
Sporadic guerrilla raids in Israel are aimed in part at getting the 
lsmelis to retaliate against Arab countries where the guerrillas hang 
out. Such action forces the heads of Arab states to side mort' and 
more with the guerrillas. Moderate Arab leaders like King Hussein of 
Jordan who are willing to attempt to settle the crisis without a war 
are faced with guerrilla insurrections. At least three attempts have 
been made to assasinate Hussein by the guerrillas who want Jordan 
and the other Arab states to move against Israel. 
The only hope for the Middle East is for the major powers involved to remain calm and to try to keep their people from getting too wrapped up in the military emotionalism that situations like these engender. It is time too tor the Arab states to repudiate the guemuas and their tactics and for the International community to put pressure on the Arab countries which are reluctant to do so. Acts of terrorism and threats against civilians have to be stopped. 
The average person can only hope that someday the leaders of this 
world come to their senses. At least until then if they want to play 
war they can do it like human beings.

The Blues Festival 



SO MANY ROADS 
"I can't treat your woman's hair. 
God knows, but I can treat her head" 
The blues fell at Notre Dame this weekend. Like some of the few guarenteed good things left these days (an album by the Band or Bullwinkle on the tube) the Chicago bluesmen put it down for all to dig. Playing for themselves more than anyone else the bluesman makes his instrument an extension of himself and what would be called music if someone else played it, is by the bluesman an expression of feeling, a means of release for the blues. The blues ain't music. The blues are a feeling. And because of that they're hard to write about or talk about. The best thing to do to dig the blues is to listen. Open up and g{"oove. _ 
'.; Of the two nights of blues Notre Dame had, Friday was the best. It started late and stayed loose. The men were playing for themselves and the crowd kept them cooking. And of course Fred McDowell. God, what can you say about Fred? Chronologically Friday's blues were cyclical, beginning and ending with Fred. Otis Rush was out of place in this scheme since h1s blues are tnose or a generation after. J. B. Hutto. Many people left Friday after hearing Otis not being able. to appreciate J. B.; Otis being close enough to the fake crap that white pseudo-blues players, not blues feelers, try to play (Led Zeppelin, Grand Funk, 
John Mayall, Eric Clapton, Johnny Winter, etc.). White blues players, like brown shoes, don't make it. Blues is black, black is blues. It's as simple as that. Sure, we can groove with the music, but how many of us can really feel it like the trumpet player for Otis Rush pushing hi!; horn and himself, trying to blow his guts out? How can you even begin to understand the closeness of man and instrument that allow Houndog's bass player to hold his axe out, hanging there, crying for him, while he shows us the oneness of the two of them saying: Look at me, look at me and my blues? 
Saturday night began close enough to eight to be considered on time and began with, who else, Fred McDowell. After having his mikes cut off by the management the night before-but still boppin' to a close with a bottleneck instrumental of When the Saints Go Marchin' In-he opened up Saturday with some delta blues at its best-not to mention the guest spots he was later to do with Houndog Taylor-a Ia night before with J. B. Hutto, and his ill-fated attempt at a duet with Lightnin' who wasn't going to let anyone steal his (excuse me) thunder. Not only did the announced bluesmen lay it down during the festival but also their sidemen were really working. (By working here we mean not putting on a show, doing a job, as B.S. & T. drily did, cranking out their sound and patter in return for not a few coin; we mean working out an emotion, trying to articulate, as best as a man can do, the blues.) Houndog's· bassman, Hutto's rhythm guitarist, Otis' sax and trumpet, they all put out. (Sammy Lay is not Rush's regular drummer. He was playing with him because things are tight in Chicago right now with a lot of places shut down. Unlike Houndog, who can get gigs any time he wants--he plays five nights out of the week-he could play seven-Sam Lay and the young bluesmen have a hard time finding jobs. So we got an extra bit of joy in hearing Sammy do 
McKinley Morganfield's "Mojo" and Williw Dixon's "Hoochie Coochie Man.") But, you can't talk about the blues, you gotta listen to it and feel it. That's why all that I've said doesn't say too much. 
And if you were there this past weekend I think you can dig that. So instead of jivin' anymore about these bluesmen I'm going to put down a list of records to hear and places to go (the better of the two) to groove with the blues. 
As far as discographies are concerned 

let's not even go into the recordings of 
the prolific Lightnin' Hopkins who, as we 
have already been informed, in that 
"I went into my room, bow down to pray, ... 



... I said the blues, now gimme your right hand. " 
astute article on world records, has been than Lightnin', Bull! on some umpteen thousand labels. Wowie Next in line, using album production as Zowie! It would be great if we really out norm, (our meager humble homage to could rate bluesmen by the number of the experts) is my main man and yours, their records; but things just don't work Fred McDowell. Like his appearances that way. Some of the best performers at everywhere in the festival, Fred has got at the festival, Houndog Taylor for example, least one cut on some twenty-odd have only one cut on one obscure album albums. It's not too much a stretch of the (American's Folk Blues Festival 1967, imagination to see him sidling into an fontana label). Ergo, as some would have album session or festival performance and us believe, Houndog is less of a bluesman . going into his thing. Representative 
byPerry W. Aberli 
albums for Fred are:Fred McDowell Vol II (Arhoolie Fl027):I Do Not Play No Rock And Roll (Capitol St 409); and My Home Is In The Delta (Testament T2208). Fed is undoubtedly the best bottleneck guitarist about and the hippest sextogenarian around, except maybe your grandfather. 
To the best of my knowledge J.B. Hutto and the Hawks have only a few cuts on a Vanguard series call Chicago/The Blues/Today. Jimmy Dawkins has one album on the Delmark label, a Chicago blues label. It's called Jimmy "Fast Fingers" Dawkins (Delmark DS-625). 
Dawkins is a typical example of the true bluesman-there tsn·t any trenzted gmtar playing and jumping about or throaty rasping vocals. Rather he just takes root on a spot on the stage and stares you down as he grinds away. Like most bluesmen, too, Jimmy was born in Mississippi (Tchula to be precise) and came to Chicago in 195 5. There he fell in with a group of bluesment including Magic Sam and Otis Rish. Only 34 we can hope to be hearing a lot more from "Fast Fingers." Incidentally, a new Delmark album is slated to be released by Jimmy in the near future. 
Otis Rush, two years older than Jimmy Dawkins, was born in Philadelphia (Mississippi, that is). He built his musical style by listening to Muddy Water, 
T-Bone Walker, Lightnin' Hopkins, and John Lee Hooker. Moving to Chicago when he was fourteen Otis went to work in the stockyards. In 195 3 Otis formed his first band and a few years later recorded his best song ever, "So Many Roads" for Chess. An interesting point about Otis is that he plays left-handed holding the guitar backwards and upside down, not reversing the strings to "correct" this. Unlike Albert King, who also plays this way, Otis hits the treble strings first, rather than the bass, giving his blues a unique quality not heard elsewhere. Otis appears on the Vanguard blues series already mentioned and also the following: Mourning In The Morning (Cotillion SD9006); Otis Rush (Python); Otis Rush (Blue Horizon (S) 7-63222); and Door To Door (Chess 1538). On this 
last album Otis has six cuts, including So Many Roads, while the ramainder are vintage Albert King. This album is a must! 
Sammy Lay, who played drums for Otis, has only one album of his own, which he considers "shitty", entitled Same Lay In Blues/and (Blue Thumb BTS-14 ). The only song on it Sammy likes is Mojo. The album was made with Mike Bloomfield's band and Sammy doesn't get much of an opportunity to work on it at all. A better album to hear Sam on and to dig some great bluesmen in general is the Chess double alhnm called Fathers and Sons (Chess LPS 12~) One of the discs is a studio job, and the other is a live gig at the Super Joy-Scout Jamboree. Playing on the album are Muddy Waters, Sam Lay, Donald "Duck" Dunn, Mike Bloomfield, Paul Butterfield, Buddy Miles, and that great man, Otis Spann. The superiority of Sam Lay as a drummer becomes blatantly obvious when he is replaced by Buddy Miles in the latter part of the nine minute version of Mojo. Buddy does his best to screw the song up. I'd like to write some more news and tales about the blues, but I've already wandered enough. (Like telling you about the new thl,rty album series by Chess of the vintage blues.) But really, unless the man is dead and gone like Otis Spann or Magic Sam the best thing to do is to make to Chicago and dig these guys in the natural habitat. Almost all of the men here can be seen any weekend in Chicago. Otis Rush can be seen at the Alex Club, Luther Allixon at the L. & A. Lounge, J. 
B. Hutto at Rose & Kelly's and Jimmy Dawkins at Duke's Place. Most of these places require good I.D.'s and you must be 21. The blues live! 
"An' I said: "Well I don't know, Honey, I ain't never hear you play the blues.""
