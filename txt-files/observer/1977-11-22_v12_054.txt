Hesburgh speaks on birth control 
by Mark Rust 

University President Fr. Theo-. dore Hesburgh told a group of over 300 biology students yesterday that without "hope and ·development of other countries, there is no answer to the population prob­lem." 
Hesburgh received a standing ovation from the crowd after his talk, which focused on the prob­lems of the poplulation explosion and birth control. 
"I'm a Catholic and I'm a priest, but I'm not against birth control," he remarked. "I don't see how anyone could be against it in one form or another." 
Hesburgh used the "spaceship earth" metaphor to explain the delicate problems of a booming population. He compared the situation on earth today to a spaceship with a limited amount of water, air and food, with those resource unevenly distributed and rapidly running out. "There is a limit to how many people we can have because there is a limit to certain supplies, like coal and oil," he said. 
Hesburgh stressed that with the depletion of resources, there is a need to limit the number of people we have on earth. "During the sixties there were 700 million people added in one decade. If that were to continue, in 2077 we would be netting an additional one-billion per year." According to Hesburgh that is something that "even God wouldn't intend." 
"But," he added, "I don't think there is any group in the world that can realistically say that four billion is the ideal number of people we can have on the earth." 
He called the population problem a moral dilemma, which is confused by many misconceptions. "It has come upon us suddenly, and there are many important people in the church that don't understand it yet," he said. 
During the speech, Hesburgh

repeatedly drew from his experi­ence in government and his posi­tion on the Overseas Council to back up his premise that there is "no way of controlliing a country's population unless that country is developed." He pointed out that all of the population increases of the past year came from poorer countries. He characterized the four countries that contributed most to this increase--China, India, Pakistan, and Indonesia--as "all underdeveloped with enormous health problems." 
Culture and religion, Hesburgh said, are not the main factors in population control. The lowest common denominator is the devel­opment of the country. "Every developed country in the world controls its population: every undeveloped one does not. You cannot solve the population prob­lem unless you get at the develop­ment problem," he concluded. 
FoUow your own conscience 

"We should have more moral means than we have today for controlling populations,'' Res­burgh stated, turning his attention to birth control. He called the various types of contraception, "a very difficult problem of conflicting judgments.'' 
While stressing his "abhor­rence" to sterilization and abor­tion, Hesburgh left the listeners free to decide what their position should be on other methods. "It's a question in my mind of following your own conscience in this mat­ter," he said. 
Hesburgh cited numerous exam­ples of attempts by governments that failed to control populations. In 1965, he said, AID (Aid for International Development) institu­ted a free distribution program of contraceptives for underdeveloped countries.

Argentine jetliner crashes 
BAKILOCHE, Argentina [API  A chart,red Argentine jetliner carrying honeymooning couples and otlller vacationers to this lake and ski resort crashed dlllring foul weather early yesterday. Austral Airline officials said thc~ll'e were some survivors among the 79 persons aboard. 
The national Noticias At~gentinas and Telam news agencies reported there were at least 40 :mrvivors among the 74 passengers and five crew members. Rescu~~ teams reached the crash scene about 20 miles from here. 
As news of the crash was broadcast on radio and teJe,vision in Buenos Aires, a crowd gathered at the' city airport pleading for infor­mation about relatives aboard., 
"Oh, Go4, please let there be survivors," wept Ana Bergman, whose 23-year-old sister, Paula, was on the airplane with her new husband Saul W eisinge'r. The W eisingers were married on Satur­day and were planning a honey­moon elsewhere.

Three Irish poets will participate in a symposium on contemporary Irish literature on Monday, Nov. 28, on the Notre Dame campus. 
Thomas Kinsella, Richa:rd Mur­phy, and Seamus Deane will partic­ipate in a panel discussion mod­erated by Sean Golden, assistant professor of English, at 4:30 p.m. in the Galvin Life Science auditor· ium. Kinsella and Murphy will follow this discussion with poetry readings at 7:30 p.m. in the Rare Book Room of the Memorial Lib­rary. 

All three poets are currently teaching in American unive:rsities: Kinsella at Temple, Murphy at Syracuse, and Deane, a visiting professor at Notre Dame. Golden has just completed editing an anthology of contemporary Irish literature. 
"Each of the poets involved has responded to current social and political events in Ireland in one way or another in his poetry," Deane noted. "Discussion of such issues will inevitable be an element in their discussion of contemporary Irish literature." 
The symposium will be spon­sored by the ND English Depart­ment, in cooperation with the Studen Union and the Celtic Societv.

'No more war' 




Sadat returns to hero's welcome 

CAIRO [AP] -Egypt's president Anwar Sadat returned horne to a hero's welcome yesterday after opening a new chapter in Middle East history by delivering his message of "no more war" to the Israeli people in their own capital. 
"We've had enough--four wars in 30 years," Sadat told the Israelis at the conclusion of a 44-hour, 16-minute visit on which he had gambled Arab unity, his political future and even his life. 
Hundreds of thousands of Egyptians, many bussed to Cairo airportespecially for the occasion, greeted their returning president with banners reading "Welcome hero of peace," "Long live the

leadership of Egypt," and "God bless your moves for peace." _ 
Hastily erected arches lined the motorcade route with signs like "God is with you" and "The people rally behind Sadat." In Cairo, sirens wailed and cars honked their horns as crowds packed ten-deep behind barricades chanted "Live, Live 0 Sadat!" 
Sadat's Center Party made every effort to assure a triumphant return, apparently to demonstrate to other Arabs that his people were still behind their president. 
But the crowds fell short of the three million forecast by officials, and apart from the noise the people appeared relatively subdued. Some may have been disappointed that Sadat's mission had not produced a tangible breakthrough in peace negotiations. 
Among Arab leftists Sadat's visit' to the capital of the Israeli enemy, his recognition of the Jewish state and his call for peace, unleashed a murderous wrath. climaxing in a call for Sadat's assassination by the Syrian controlled Saiqa guerilla group. 
But to millions of viewers who watched the visit on television around the world the visit was a breathtaking coup. Belgian Foreign Minister Henri Simonet called it a "brilliant victory" for Israel. 
In Washington, a State Depart­rnent spokesman called Sadat' s journey "a positive and good step: We think this has contributed to the search for peace and we are hopeful of the results." 

In his final statement to Israel's cabinet members in Jerusalem, Sadat said: "Let us raise two slogans --no war, and security. 
"No war, let every girl, every

woman, every mother, here and in my country, know that we shall solve all our problems through negotiations around the table rather than start wars," he said. 
Israel's Prime Minister Mena­hern Begin echoed the theme at the farewell ceremony at Ben-Gurion Airport:

by Maria Frigyesi . 

' The St. Mary's Student Assem­bly met last night to discuss the allocation of funds for the Law Society. The organization has been previously allocated $20, but a reconsideration was requested to meet their financial needs. Mary Pat Butler, president of the Law Society, presented the case by emphasizing that the main purpose of the group is to bring speakers to the campus to provide information 
Israel for 29 years,'' said a Beirut 
radio station that speaks for 
guerrillas and their Lebanese leftist 
allies. 

''This defection from Arab ranks 
is not only treason but also makes 
Sadat as much an arch-enemy of 
the Arabs as Israel, if not worse," 
said the broadcast. 
Meanwhile, the conservative rulers of the oil-rich Persian Gulf states, marking the four-day Mos­lem holiday of sacrifice, main­tained their silence about the Sadat trip. This spotlighted a growing  gulf between them and the angry leftist regimes that denounce Sadat as a traitor. 
Dr. Georg Habash's Popular Front for the Liberation of Pales­tine, the most extreme guerilla group voted to sabotage Sadat's no-war agreement with Israeli

unilateral termination of the state 
He  told  the  Associated  Press,  
"We  now  classify  Sadat  in  the  
same  bracket  as  Begin.  Sadat's  

of war with Israel cannot be 
tolerated.'' 
The statements were issued after Sadat's departure for horne at the end of a two-day visit to Israel, the first by an Arab head of state since the Jewish state's creation in 1948. 
In Moscow, a group of 44 Egyptian students studying in the Soviet Union announced it had sent a telegram to Sadat calling his trip "an unforgivable sin before his­tory." 
Guerrilla leader Y asir Arafat formed a special committee to meet Syrian President Hafez Assad and Libyan Premier Abdul Salam Jalloud to discuss Sadat's trip. 
"Mapping out a new confronta­tion strategy against Israel will be the main topic of discussion after Sadat's defection," said a spokes­man for Arafat's high command in Beirut. 
The move underscored efforts to form a new hardline front, headed by Syria, to continue the confronta­tion with Israel. 
Syria has not yet announced it is 
abandoning its pledge to seek a 1 peaceful settlement of the Mideast l conflict, despite its bitter denuncia­ition of Sadat's unilateral 
for the students. 'Fund raising is secondary to the orl!anization's purpose," she stated. 
According to Butler, the Society is different from other groups in that it is not connected to any specific major or department. "The society offers pre-profession­
al advice  to  students.  No other  
organization  does  this,"  Butler  
remarked.  

Past achievements of the Law Society cited by Butler included additions to the Career Develop­ment Center, the organization of law panels, the sponsoring of an American Scene speaker, and the coordination of Law Day. 
The proposal_ was supported by a letter from Dr. Deann Sokolowski, faculty advisor for the Law Society. In the letter, read by Student Body President, Mary Rukavina, to the assembly members, Sokolowski described the group as a service organization responding to the campus need for information on law as a possible career. She concluded by stating that the society cannot continue to operate without Student Government sup­port.

of Israel and Egypt, we have reached understanding that there will be no more wars between our nations.'' 
"We shall make peace,"' he .added as Sadat's Egyptian jetliner lifted off Israeli soil. "I am sure, I am sure." 
At a joint news conference earlier yesterday, Begin pro­claimed the visit "a real success." He said the chief achievement was the start of "serious direct dialogue ...not only between Israel and Egypt but with all other states." 
In TV interviews both leaders 

voiced optimism that the Geneva 
Mideast peace conference could be 
reconvened before the end of t,.e 
year. 
In a discussion that followed, a proposal was made by an assembly member to co-sponsor speakers, whose fees constitute the bulk of the society's expenses, with Stu­dent Government. Butler rejected this on tl)e grounds that it would defeat the purpose of the society as an autonomous organization, and that the status of the society as a pre-professional organization would be in question. "We need money now to plan for second semester speakers,'' Butler said. 
Deliberations by the assembly led to a proposal to re-allocate $100 earmarked for the Law Day speak­er. 
Student Government Treasurer, Mary Beth Leisle reported that the . $339 ticket revenue collected for the appearance of Cicely Tyson would not approach the perform­er's $3525 fee, plus her expenses of $250 . As a result, a monetary loss of Student Government funds was reported. 
Plans to sell police whistles at the Student Government bazaar booth were also discussed. A nominal fee will be charged to promote sales. Rukavina stated students will be encouraged to wear them at night for security reasons. 
Discussion of the parietals pro·

Use Your Head 
Dear Editor: 
As a member of Farley's hall council, I've been asked repeatedly to advise the girls to be cautious -­call security if you see anyone suspicious in the dorms or on campus; don't walk alone at night; don"t jog around the lakes alone; ask to see someone's ID when you open the door for him; or ask who they're going to visit; use the escort service, (use your head); and now --lock your doon at 1111 times. 
Since a male entered a girl's fourth-floor room in the middle of the night last Friday, Farley wo­men are scared. It's nice to think that if we live on the fourth floor, we're safe, but the fact is, we don't know where we're safe. Like it or not, we have been forced by the incompetency of others to fear for our safety. 
Since the number of women on this campus has increased, so have the incidents increased. In most instances, however, women stud­ents do not deserve the blame. The blame lies in those who don't take these instances seriously. It lies with those who gave the peculiar glow to the golden dome instead of lighting the walks beneath it. Blame also lies in failing to install operative phones in every building on campus, and not installing security hotlines for fear someone will tear them out. Most of all, the fault is in all of us for being so complacent and allowing Notre Dame to be so victimized. 
I would hate to see Notre Dame change from a tranquil campus to a police state, but this has gone far en<'ugh. I'm furious! Maybe if we had coed dorms instead of elderly security guards, we'd be safer. 
Security should not be an area for study, it shouldn't even be given a' priority; it should be given.

. mazing considering the frequency of minor violations of the law, such as rape and theft in the Notre Dame Community. Women of the Notre Dame Community rest assured, when walking alone at night, that no one is being corrupted at an off-campus keg party, although you may well be assaulted. · Michael Goodwin Tom Lange 

Thanks to Students 
Dear EdJtor: This is an open letter to the ND-SMC community: 
This past Saturday at the Air Force game, some of you may have noticed a group of over 200 people or so singing and cheering in the stands. Our group was from Logan, and without the help of the Notre Dame-St. Mary's community, we would never have been there. We have many people to thank for it. 
First of all, thank-you to all the students who donated their tickets to us in the dining halls and at the Student Activities. Without your tickets we couldn't have gotten into the game, so thanks so much! 
We would also like to thank the ushers at the stadium, especially those that stood in our section. Your understanding and patience just was so great! The kids had a terrific time because of all your help! 
Also, thank-you to the people whose seats we were in. It was important that we stayed in a group, so no one would get lost. You were all really understanding ·

Thanksgiving 
as Usual 


jim bowler 
Over the river and through the woods, To Grandmother's house we go... 
Now let's see mused Grandma, have we prepared everything? We have the com, peas, string beans, wax beans, beets, cauliflower, candied yams, spinach, cucumbers, tomatoes, apple cider, fruit cups, shrimp cocktails, soups, apples, pears, oranges, pumpkin pie, cherry pie, sweet potatoes, mashed potatoes, baked potatoes, stuffing, goose, roast duck, and, of course, the turkey. Yes, she decided, all seemed in order. 
By this time, the family had assembled in the dining room and was waiting impatiently around the large table. As the food slowly arrived in front of the drooling onlookers, their knives and forks immediately began the onslaught. When Grandma finally entered with the last dish of the feast, Father began to say grace. With a gesture that resembled the swatting of flies, he blessed himself and mumbled the forgotten prayer that was barely heard above the bickering of the children vying for the largest leg of turkey. Father, annoyed at their quarreling stopped the prayer in mid-sentence and settled the argument by giving each a slice of turkey, keeping the prized leg for himself. 
 Without further interruption, they proceeded to devour, swallow, gulp, gormandize, chew, masticate, nibble, bite, gnaw, graze on, lap, guzzle, imbibe, crunch, munch and engulf their food. And after they had devoured, swallowed, gulped, gormandized, chewed, masticated, nibbled, bit, gnawed, grazed on, lapped, guzzled, imbibed, crunched, munched, and engulfed their food, they sat back and viewed the results of their gluttony, which had left the table looking like the victim of a brutal Indian attack. 
After Father had gained his balance, he opened a can of beer and journeyed to the living room to watch the afternoon football game. Sitting in his reclining chair, stomach sprawled well over his belly, he unleashed a loud burp that echoed through the room. And it was here, somewhere between the third and fourth quarters, that Father offered his lone psalm of gratitude that day: "Thank God for the Alka Seltzer."

Letters to a Lonely God 
Thanksgiving is the Cruellest Feast 
Reverend Robert Griffin 

New England ladies, it is said, have their hats, and New England families have their homes. The hats have their histories, and look, each one of them, as though it could have made it on its own, not needing a Cabot or Lowell to wear it, showing up for meetings at the Boston Athenaeum, celebrating Emerson's birthday, checking Thoreau's essays out of the Boston Public Library. Boston hats, dowager or spinster, are local institutions: snobbish, fishy-eyed, uncompromising, needing to please nobody. You wouldn't dare to contradict a Boston hat; and if you tried to, you'd wish that, instead of being so impertinent, you'd merely been landed on by Plymouth Rock. 
New England homes, like New England hats, are passed down from generation to generation. You don't own the homes; the homes let you use them for a little while. You are born there; you grow up there; you live there, and you may die there, or you move off to jobs in Poughkeepsie. Whatever you do, the house remains, cherishing its history, storing up its memories, secreting its ghosts, enduring births, resisting change. Generations come and go; but a New England home, like the earth itself, endures forever. 
I did not do all my growing up in my grandfather's New England house on the coast of Maine, the house that had no history but my family's history; but when I grew old enough, we moved there, my grandparents having finished with their need of the place. Inherited with the place were the portraits of my great grandparents, the furniture, the dishes and silver, the family Bibles, the apple trees, and the flagpole (four or five times replaced) in the yard, that implied we belonged to a tradition of being old New England, so that only the Indians had a right to regard as parvenus. On the islands off that Maine coast were even older houses, where my great grandparents had played as children remembering their own grandparents at home on ancestral acres. The family was never more than local gentry, having its share of doctors and lawyer, mayors and preachers, as well as fishermen; but we were Yankees, by God! Growing up in New England, being Yankee was enough, even if you didn't make it as a Saltonstall. 
New England homes, like New England hats, were instituted (as the sacraments were) as external signs of an internal grace, thoroughly Protestant, grimly Yankee. Thanksgiving, for a Yankee, is like the Easter communion of Catholics: it reminds you of how faithfully you have kept the tradition. For one day of the year, at least, you hate yourself for the neglect of an ancient duty. 
Thanksgiving Day, as you grow older, becomes a window through which you view the landscape of the past. The day has its uses as a harvest festival, but birthdays seem more appropriate for celebrating one's survival and prosperity. As you grow older, Thanksgiving is memories of the past clutching at the heart. It is recaptured innocence belonging to a time before you discovered that death was more powerful than your father and grandfather, who you hoped were immortal. Thanksgiving is a child, sitting with other children at a table, and somebody says: "Nanna made the Indian pudding;" and you struggle to eat the mincemeat pie your mother made, as well as the pudding, so mother. and grandmother will know you are equally pleased with both of their bakings. Thanksgiving is grownups saying a blessing for births bringing young, new laughter to the house, and a thank you for deaths and sickness sparing the family for another year so that different generations can have the enjoyment of knowing one another. Thanksgiving is sadness never mentioned before the children, as adults grieve wordlessly for guests who can never come again to places set at the family feast. Thanksgiving is a little boy, eating too much, with nobody saying "Don't," as they might do at other times as a check to the little guy's chubbiness; in the midst of gluttony, the boy can sense a wistful note to the hilarity warning him that remembrances are being clutched at in this gathering, to be used as souvenirs on a darker day. Thanksgiving is remembering, as you know your mother is remembering on this day, and your brother and sister are remembering; and thinking that short of a miracle, the four of you will never do your remembering together, in the same place, again. 
The old New England home is gone now, belonging to strangers you suspect incapable of cheris.hing an apple tree. I have no need of a house that requires passing down to children and grandchildren. The mother and the brother and the sister live in places where the sick are cared for. Sometimes, while in Maine, I drive past the house, never daring to stop, having no rights over the home and room where my father died. My grandparents intended that I should live in the house as its owner; my grandmother spoke about my having the house the week before she died. I made other choices, and maybe that New England home felt betrayed by the choice I made. Maybe I'm afraid ofthe house; maybe that's why I never stop, fearful of the way the wind can sob against the eaves where birds pass on their nests from generation to generation. If Boston hats can be formidable, New England houses can positively carry on a grudge, cursing an offspring with restlessness until he comes home again to inherit his patrimony. 

It is almost Thanksgiving Day; and in middle age, you know you can never go home again. Thanksgiving is the cruellest feast. At Christmas, though there are memories, yet in that season, Christ is always being born; at Easter, earth and flesh itself celebrate a feast of survival. In late November, as you grow older, the ode to joy is sung with muted .notes, in a minor key. The thanks rise to God for the blessings that are,and for the blessings that have already been. I hope it is not ungrateful 'to heaven to neeil, in middle age, Hie blessin.ti's of home-and familv; not as a 
child might need them, but as -a man remembers them to be. ~ 
Whether from New England, or not, hold on to your hats. Whether Yankee, or not, be grateful for home and family. Hats cannot last until. time immemorial, though when you see them on ladies in Boston, forever is they way they look. Home and family are even more perishable, try as· hard as you can to pass them down from generation to .zeneration.

Backstage Ot the MBF 
----by Frank Laurino 

[This is the second of a three part series on the 
Midwest Blues festival. Part Three will be printed 
after Thanksgiving break. 

Saturday night's show had been over for half an 
hour, and all but the few remaining concertgoers 
had filed out the door of Stepan Center. The light 
trees were being lowered, the P A cable rolled, 
and the stage cleared of the last mike stand and 
snare drum. 

All that could be seen through the hazy light was 
a sea of bottles and cans. Like an army of 
bulldozers, the Midwest Blues Festival staffers 
were sweeping up the debris. 

Over by the stage, Big Joe Duskin could be heard 
above the clink of bottles. He was laughing at a 
joke as he loaded up his old Cadillac with 
equipment. 

From backstage walked Bob Kissell, slowly, 
with an exhausted but satisfied expression. He 
looked like he'd been awake for 48 hours. Well, 
almost. Bob, the director of the 1977 Midwest 
Blues Festival, knows that putting on a two-night 
six-act show isn't the easiest thing to do. · 
To trace the 24-year-old Notre Dame grad 
student's involvement in the MBF, one has to go 
back to 1971. That was Bob's freshman year at 
ND; it was also the year of the first blues festival 
held at Stepan. At that time, Bob had only a 
limited exposure to the blues. 

''I went to some of the shows, and I really liked 
it," Bob remembered. "The music was so good! I 
was hooked." 

Skip back to 1973, when Bob found himself in 
the collegiate seminar class of grad student Perry 
Aberli, l:Jte existing director of the MBF. Bob 
expressed a desire to work at the next festival; 
Perry agreed. 

That festival in 1974 featured Fenton Robinson, 
Big Walter Horton and the Bossman, Muddy 
Waters. Bob was given charge of the artists' 
requirements backstage (e.g., food and drink). "I 
was totally amazed when Muddy walked in," 
recalled Bob. 

1975 was the same: Perry at the helm, Bob 
assisting. However, Bob now had the job of lining 
up the main attraction, Albert King. He was also 
in charge of all backstage operations, including the 
artist's payments--"the deals" which were usually 
in $20 bills and, occasionally, a bottle or two of fine 
liquor. 

Although Perry found his five-year role as 
director satisfying, he had also found it increasing­
ly difficult to enjoy the show. ''There was too 
much running around," explained Bob. "Itgets to 
be a lot--the hassles, the worries." · 
tThe best way to run the show is to immerse yourself in the music,' 
...,....,................. .........,..................~..
~~~~~~·~ 

By this time, Bob was on his way to being a 
double-domer and was very heavily into the blues. 
Perry decided it was time for a change, so he asked 
Bob, "Wanna take over the show?" The answer, 
of course, was yes. 

Bob admits he was "extremely naive" as far as 
directing a festival was concerned. "I leaned 
heavily on Perry for help with bookings, finances, 
and ads. He told me: 'The best way to run the 
show is to immerse yourself in the music.'' 
The new MBF director took the advice. When at 
his home in Chicago, Bob would compulsively buy 
blues records and books about blues artists. Night 
after night, he would stay awake in bars, listening 
to little :>r unknown performers. 

"I soon realized that my main problem was how 
to provide a well-balanced program," said Bob. "I 
also wanted to make use of the Bicentennial 
theme. I think the blues is one of the fundamental 
forms of American music.' I wanted to show how 
the blues had changed, how it had formed its 
different styles." 

Bob classifies the blues into three basic styles. 
The oldest and perhaps the purest style is the 
acoustic/country blues, performed by such artists 
as Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee. Out of this 
style came a transitional period (from the late '40s 
to the late '60s) called jump/swing blues. Muddy 
Waters is a representative artist of this period. 
The most recent trend in blues--one brought about 
by the electronic rock medium--is the city/electric 
style, which includes artists like Son Seals and · Albert King. Albert King's style of music tends to be very popular with young blues enthusiasts, so Bob ·decided he wanted the big guitarist to headline the 
1976 Saturday session. "Albert told me after the 
'75 festival, 'I haven't had this much fun in a long 
time. Any time your want me to come back here, 
I'll come.' So I got him." 

Festival time soon rolled around, Bob was 
pleased with the lineup--especially with Albert. 
He remembered looking on as the legendary 
bluesman wailed on guitar when out of the crowd 
came a beer can. It hit Albert above the rim of his 
glasses; he left the stage. 

"I was completely crushed," said Bob. "Albert 
was exceedinJidv angered--not J!t me, the staff, or 
the crowd-but at that individual who had ruined 
three months of hard work.'' 
"It was hard for me to handle the incident," 
continued Bob. "But it made me more derermined 
to put on the next show ... a good blues show with a 
relaxed atmosphere, where everything could go 
smoothly.'' 
....................~.... .....
-~~ 

tl decided... I·wanted Muddy Waters. I wouldn't haue to worry about a strong posing show with the Bossman.' 
Thus Bob Kissell's MBF '77. He started 
working in May. Student union Director Thomas 
Gryp allowed Bob to sign contract before the S.U. 
budget meetings, and the Cultural Arts Commis­
sion granted a $3500 budget. Bob estimated the 
cost of the festival to be $10,000, which meant he 
needed $6500 in ticket sales to break even. 
Therefore, a big headliner was the most important 
concern. 
"I decided right away that I wanted Mudd¥ 
Waters," said Bob. "I wouldn't have to worry 
about a strong closing show with the Bossman." 
Muddy was signed along with Mighty Joe Young 
in a package deal; both would perform Saturday 
night. "I would never have been able to get 
Muddy if I had to wait until September to sign 
acts," Bob explained. "These people ·are 
professionals; you have to book them like people 
who play the A.C.C. Tom Gryp knew this, and he 
allowed me to go ahead with the contracts." 
Bob's next problem was how to round off the 
shows with quality acts and still remain within his 
budget. Son Seals was chosen to headline Friday's 
performance. 
"I had seen Son many times,"said Bob. "Every 
time he got better and better. Son also had a big 
following in South Bend, so he would be a big 
draw.'' 
Bob then met with Perry to toss around some 
other names. Surprisingly, the past festivals 
featured artists that Perry had wanted to see. As 
Bob explained, "Perry once wanted to see Albert 
King. So we got him to come to the festival.'' 
In the same manner, Bob and Perry decided on 
Big Joe Duskin for the opening slot on Saturday. 
The two had never heard of the Cincinnati piano 
player because he had never cut a record. But Son 
Seals' manager, Bruce Iglauer (called "Alligator 
Bruce" because of his company, Alligator Re­
cords), ·sent Perry a demo tape of Big Joe. Bob 
immediately fell in love with the music. "I knew I ·wanted him as soon as I heard the first song." 
Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee were to be in 
Chicago at the time of the festival, so they were 
quickly signed for friday night. Everything was 
now set, except for the festival's opening act. 
Edith Wilson and Little Brother Montgomery 
had cut a record in late 1976. Perry bought it. Bob 
listened. Both liked. Then, they had a visitor. 
"A girl from a music course at Notre Dame had 
gone to Chicago to interview Edith for a term 
paper," said Bob. "She was very impressed with 
Edith's personality--as much as we were with her 
music. So we signed her." 
The concert lineup was set by July 15--a new 
MBF record. "I rewarded myself with a two-week 
vacation in Oregon," said Bob. "But the work 
wasn't over." 
Bob decided a new approach was needed for . festival advertising. He doubled his radio spots on WRBR, W AOR, and WSND-FM. He and Perry ·worked extensively through the River City Review, selling the show in South Bend through articles 
and ads. 
Bob then went one better. He took out an ad in 
Uving Blues, a national publication for blues 
enthusiasts. . 
"There are no blues festivals which bring in acts from all over the country that has existed for as long as ours," explained Bob. "I thought it was time to promote the festival on a national basis. I had very strong sets, and the prices, as usual, were extremely low. People who get into blues would be willing to travel to South Bend for the festival.'' 
The ad paid off. Bob received calls from Oeveland, Pittsburgh, Newcastle, Pa., Grand Rapids, Minn., New York City, and Toronto, Canada. All expressed a desire to attend the festival. 
The other necessary preparations seemed incidental. Stepan Center was reserved for a non-home-football weekend in November. Lights, sound equipment, and technical personnel were contracted through Mike Whelan, who had worked the lights at the past blues festivals. 
Bob arrived at Stepan seven hours before the show started to allow the light and sound crews time to set up their equipment. Tom Modic, MBF Stage Manager, and the entire staff were there to set up chairs and assist the technical personnel. 
Bob was a bundle of nerves. ~~Most of the

[Continued from page II "I dido 't think much of their approach," he said. "it was the Sears-Roebuck huckster style. They thought they could run a­-ound the world passing out con­doms and IUD's and that people would use them. ~ell, if they're not motivated to use them, they won't" he said. Hesburgh said the issue of population control called for a "GiobalSolution.'' He pointed out that the richer nations have the prim1ry responsibility, since they account for only 20 percent of the world's population, but use 80 percent of its resources. Hesburgh reminded the class that "we are all members of the '<>paceship earth,' and the uneven distribution of resources is simply not just. You'll never have peace in the world unless you do something about it."

Backstage at the MBF 
[continued &om page 4] afternoon, I was worrying that the show wouldn't go smoothly. It was snowing, and I worried about the artists getting to Stepan on time. I also wondered if the weather would seriously cut my gate sales." Immediately, Bob had a technical problem. The main spotlight, rented from an Indianapolis company, wouldn't work. Efforts to rent another from a South Bend company were fruitless. "I was not very pleased at all," said Bob. "But it was almpstishowtime,and there was nothing we could do.'.' All evening, Bob looked like a machine stuck in high gear. One minute he was backstage checking on ,the artists, only to have to rush onstage and introduce the next act. He constantly talked with the s<)undand lightcrews to make sure everything was in proper order. He assisted his own crew with ltheir jobs. Occasionally he'd crawl over cable's and partitions in front of the stage so he could snap a picture or two. There was even a time when he sat still for a few minutes and listened to the music. The gremlins were out that night, as always. Son Seals' vocal mike mysteriously died during one song. Once, a clumsy photographer tripped over the PA lines, temporarily cutting sound to some of· the high-frequency horns. Fortunately, there were no incidents like the Albert King escapade. "If something like that had happened again, the future of the blues festival would have been in doubt," said Bob. However, something terrible nearly happened. Someone in the front stage area rested against a guideline which supported a light tree. One of the booms fell about eight feet. "Those trees are very heavy and carry a lot of power," Bob explained. "Besides the obvious damage to the equipment, the safety of the artists and fans was threatened. We were vety lucky." Friday night's show ended without further problems. "I knew that if I could 2et throu2h the 
first show, th~ rest would be easy,'' said Bob. 
_Saturday mg~t, except for a few microphone 
failu~es, was a btt s~oother. Whalen had rigged a 
~potltght platform wtth so!De stage lights, provid­
tn~ more-than-adequate vtsual effects. 
Bob got a scare when Mighty Joe Young showed up late. "He's usually very reliable, so I was worried," said Bob. "But he just got caughUn the snow.''
.......................................~ ...............~...-.~........... 
'If I can get people 
to go to the festiual, 
I can hook'em on the blues.' 
The 1977 Midwest Blues Festival ·turned out to be a success, expecially at the gate. According to Bob, the shows drew $7500 to $8000--well over the estimated returns. Bob plans to use the extra money for a one-act mini-concert in Washington Hall this spring. 
The festival was a musical successs as well. "I felt I educated some people,"· Bob said. "If I can get people to go to the festival, I can hook 'em on the blues. You don't have to have alot of knowledge about the blues to enjoy it. All you have to do is let yourself be taken in by the music." 
Bob is presently working towards a graduate degree in psychology, S\)ecializing in mental retardation. He's also trymg to arrange for his studies to continue in the South Bend area. Why? He already has dreams of the 1978 Midwest Blues Festival--with an eye on B.B. King as headliner. 
"If I'm here next year, I'll definitely do the show," Bob said confidently. "Anf if there's a chance of getting B.B. King, I'm going for it. I love this music a whole lot."

A capacity crowd turned out at the ACC last Friday night to see what the 
Notre Dame basketball team was really made of. It turned out to be more 
than just another preseason or exhibition match. The 101-80 triumph over 
the Russian national team was a showcase of a college basketball tewam 
that actually wore down their somewhat bigger and stronger Russian 
opposition. The many fans leaving the arean had to be impressed with the . 
Irish's great depth, speed and ball control which saw Notre Dame turn the 
ball over but 11 times. Besides, it was a feeling of satisfaction that 
transcended the crowd as they saw the almighty Russian national team go 
down to defeat at the hands of an American collegiate pwer that is ranked 
fourth by the AP in its preseason poll. 
It was a late summer day in 1972 when I sat back in front of my home 
television to watch my daily dose of Summer Olympic action with the 
games being held in Munich. I knew that ABC was going to be showing 
most of the basketball championship between the United States and the 
USSR for the gold medal. and they did, final score USSR 51, United 
States SO. Sure the United States was playing without its best players (Bill 
Walton and David Thompson), but to lost by one point when the opposing 
team gets to score the winning bucket with 3 seconds to play was a little 
too much to take. But one thing could not be denied. The Russian 
basketball team had actually beaten the United States national team for 
the gold medal, something that no nation had ever done in Olympic 
basketball history. International basketball competition·was never to be 
the same: that is, dominated by the U.S.A. 
The United States did come back to regain the medal in Montreal but 
sweet revenge was no to be their's as the Russian team had already been 
knocked out in the semifinals by Yugoslavia. It would have been a close 

game as the Russians have now built up their basketball program to a 
level that is rapidly drawing alongside that of the United States. 

Following Friday night's game, Russian Coach Aleksandr Gomelsky spoke of his team as a tired unit that was still having trouble getting acclimated to American collegiate basketball rules during its tour of the United States. He did admit that the Russian team is a·young team, but. one that will be prepared by the time the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow. The Soviet Union does have a great advantage though. Their national team is supported by th~ government and the players have no need to be . self-supportive. Furthermore, the Russian national team is comprised of the best basketball talent in the country and they have· three years to play 
' 
that a lot of other people deserved. 
"I'm not an 'I' guy but I decided it would be best to malk::e this decision at this time because people keep asking me." 
Bryant told the club that pro­spe(:tive signees are asking him if he will be around to coach them if they decide to play for Alabama. 
Bryant said he had talked with the university president, Dr. David Matthews, and to Mrs. Bryant and added, "The good Lord willintg, I'm going to try it four more years." 
Fans have speculated for several years whether Bryant would go for Stagg's mark but he had declined to say anything about it. 
Including Alabama's 9-1 mark this season, Bryant has averaged more than 8.2 victories a season in his 33 years as a coach. Over the past seven seasons his team:> have averaged almost 10.5 wins a yea~. 
Stagg compiled his 314 over 57 years, giving hims an average of 
5.5 victories a season. 
Next in line is Glenn "Pop" Warner, whose 313 in 44 years averages 7.1. · 
The only active coach anywhere close to Bryant is Grambling's Eddie Robinson who has 262 victories. Bryant's Sugar lBowl opponent Jan. 2, Wood_v Hayes of Ohio State has 238 victories through this season, his 31st. 
After Hayes come Jess Neely 207, Warren Wodson 203, Eddie Anderson 201, Dana X. Bible 198, Dan McGugin 197 and Fielding H. Yost 196. 
Bryant has compiled 180 of his victories ih his 20 seasons at Alabama and got the othet"s at Maryland, Kentucky and Texas A&M. 

together as a team against some of the best competition in the world to get ready. You can bet that the USSR will be back in the Olympic finals in 1980. Gomelsky added that he has the material with which to mold a team of gold medal caliber. 
But getting back to the NotreDame basketball team, Gomelsky had ample praise for he Fighting Irish. Not only did he term Notre Dame a much more powerful team than Indiana, Gomelsky also rated the Irish right with Kentucky as being two of the top teams in the country and he refused to pick a winner of the New Year's Eve game between the two powers. Of course, the Russian co1ch hasn't yet seen North Carolina, UCLA, San Francisco or Cindnnati but we all know how strong the Kentucky Wildcats are going to be :his year. 
As for the Notre Dame depth, it was most evident Friday night as 11 Irish players played more than ten minutes apiece. And as Gomelsky emphasized during the post game press conference, Notre Date doesn't have any single superstar but is a classy team that works very well together as a unit. All five starters for Notre Dame hit double figures in scoring with Dave Batton pacing the attack with 18. It was also a time for the Notre Dame freshmen. 
Everyone and his brother knew thc>t Coach Digger Phelps had had an outstanding recruiting year for Not:·e Jame and that was quite evident on Friday night. Kelly Tripucka notched eight points anc Gilbert Salinas six, but for crowd-pleasing performances one had to point a finger at both Orlando Woolridge and Stan Wilen . Not only did the little "0" (actually he's 6-9) block three shots during' .s ten minutes on the floor, he kept the ball in play each time. And he's 10t even 18 year~ old yet. 
Meanwhile, Mr. Wilcox was teaming with senior Jeff Carpenter to form a hard pressing backcourt duo. that should be seeing a lot of action this year. Not only is Wilcox the deft ball handler, he is quite the defensive guard. His three rebounds and. three steals will that. And did you see who was screening out 7-4 Vladimir Tkachenko when Carpie drove the middle for a layup? It was 6-3 Stan Wilcox, of course. 
Friday's night game between Notre Dame and the USSR was an ideal basketball attraction, the type of attraction that is not usually seen unless a UCLA or Maryland visits the ACC in mid-winter. Not only was it a. showcase of outstanding basketball, it was a friendly form of diplomacy. By the way Digger, how did Sergei Belov enjoy your stamp collection? 
. Have a pleasant Thanksgiving.

Payton breaks record 
CIDCAGO [AP]-Durable Walter Payton, having smashed O.J. Simpson's single-game rushing re­cord, is squeezing The Juice again. 
The 23-year-old Chicago Bear superstar didn't allow O.J.'s sin­gle-game record of 273 yards, set 

-last Thanksgiving Day, to stand for even a full year. Payton went two yards better Sunday, hammering

the Minnesota Vikings 40 times for 275 yards in a 10-7 victory. 
Now Payton is zeroing in on 0. J.'s season record of 2,003 yards, set in 1973_, With four games left Payton nedds an average of 150 yards a game to accomplish the feat. Payton has averaged 140.4 yards and 23.9 carries a game. projected that would give him 1, 966 yards for 14 games. But in his last two games he has averaged 36.5 carries and 233.5 yards a game. 
When Payton carried 33 times for 192 yards against Kansas City the previous Sunday, Chicago quarterback Bob Avellini was asked if such strategy is advisable. 
"When you have a Walter Payton around, you'd better give him the ball 30 times a game," said Avellini. 
Bettering his word, Avellini at­tempted but one pass in the first half of the Minnesota game and gave the ball to Payton 26 times. 
So far, in this his third year in the NFL, the former Jackson State star has proven to be more than durable. Instead of being punished by defensemen as is the usual case, Payton does the punishing. 
Opposing linemen and lineback· ers insist that Payton hits them harder than he gets hit because of his ability to twist and squirm. 
Payton maintains a facade of modesty, always insisting that the credit should go to his line. 
His offensive line has to be one of the youngest in the league with an averge age of 24. They are center Dan Peiffer, 26; Noah Jackson 26; Revie Sorie, 24; Dennis Lick 23; and Ted Albrecht, 23. Peiffer, Jackson and Sorey are third-year men, Lick is in his second year and Albrecht a rookie. 
One of the reasons they love blocking for Payton is they don't have to stand up and pass block which is an offensive lineman's toughest assignment. 1 Instead of getting hn oy oetensive linemen, they in turn do the hitting. 
"They open the holes and all I do is run," said Payton .
