Irish had the most success in the West 
By KATIE MURPHY 
News Writer 
Conventional wisdom on the Irish in the American West is incomplete, according to Uni­versity of Montana professor David Emmons. 
Author of several books on the subject, including "The Butte Irish: Class and Ethnicity in a Mining Town," Emmons explained Thursday that the first influx of Irish immigrants into the United States was a re­sult of the famine in Ireland in the 1840s and 1850s. 
"The nation allowed them in with some reluctance," he said. "However, the West needed workers and the Irish answered the 'help wanted' signs." 
The farther west the Irish immigrants traveled, the more they improved their social, po­litical, and economic situation, he said. This first generation was successful, according to Emmons, because there was not an established society or elite which resented their pres­ence in the West. 
"There is considerable evi­dence that the early arriving Irish did better in the West than in the East. The Irish who got to a place first or second were limited only by their abilities," he said. 
An important aspect of the relative success of these Irish immigrants in the West is re­lated to the emphasis on hospi­tality in their society, according to Emmons. 
"Irish hospitality is not a question of good manners. It is literally and fundamentally a question of being Irish. The early arrivals were able to se­cure jobs and a future for those who came later," he said. 
But industrial changes in the United States and differences in the types of Irish people coming into the nation caused divisions among fellow immigrants near

Distribution of wealth causes Peru's pain 
By CHRIS HANIFIN 
News Writer 
There is a close connection between the social problems plaguing Peru and the present distribution of wealth in that country, a South American professor said Thursday. 
"Peru is a very interesting country for study. The only problem is that it is my coun­try," said Adolfo Figuerola, of the Catholic University of Peru in Lima. In a troubled Peru, he continued, "rules of production and distribution no longer ex­ist. Rules of property rights no longer apply." 
One problem evident in Peru is the lack of a stable govern­ment, Figuerola said. The pro­fessor's goal is to connect changes in government to eco­nomic changes, he said. 
"We have shifts in democra­cies and dictatorships. We must ask 'Is there any relationship between these quantitative changes and the qualitative [economic] changes?"' 
Peru has been troubled further by the simultaneous decline of investment and of wages in recent years, accord­ing to Figuerola. 
"We have had in Peru forty economic policies in fifteen years. This (decline) is the re­sult of these policy changes. This decline is a real paradox," he said. 
Typically, a decline in real wages will stimulate investment as an attempt is made to

Iraq playing hide-and-seek with missiles; one to two hundred may be stashed 
AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -Sad­dam Hussein is moving scores of Scud missiles around Iraq on camouflaged trucks so U.N. weapons inspectors can't find them and has buried an un­known number of rocket boosters, Western officials and other sources say. 
One intelligence operative de­scribed it as a "real game" of hide-and-seek. 
U.N. weapons inspection teams over the past 18 months have tracked down and dis­mantled much of Iraq's nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs as well as its surface-to-surface missiles with a range of 90 miles or more under terms of the 1991 Gulf War cease-fire agreement. 
But American and U.N. offi­cials suspect that Saddam has stashed away some of the 819 Scud-B missiles he acquired from the former Soviet Union during the 1980-88 war with Iran, or longer-range al-Hus­sein and al-Abbas variants Iraq developed. 
Tim Trevan, spokesman for t~e U.N. Special Commission charged with dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, said 151 ballistic missiles have been destroyed by the inspectors or the Iraqis, or are awaiting destruction. 
But, since the Iraqis have still not come clean on what they have, U.N. officials believe Sad­dam still has around 100 mis­siles hidden away. The CIA be­lieves the figure is closer to 200. 
In March 1991, Iraq admitted it had 52 ballistic missiles. But under intense diplomatic pres­sure, Baghdad later confessed it had another 92. 
U.N. inspectors believe at least 487 of the Soviet Scuds were fired during the Iran-Iraq War or in tests. 
It's not known how many Scuds were provided by Syria, Libya or North Korea, or how many were cannibalized to produce the al-Hussein and a)­Abbas variants. 
Ninetv-three missiles were fired at ·Israel and Saudi Arabia during last year's Gulf War. 
The Pentagon concedes that no missiles were destroyed in allied air strikes.

Clinton will bring about sexual equality 
For most male Notre Dame students ERA means earned run average and NOW means at this moment. But following the election of Bill Clinton to the 

presidency  and  the  Stephen  
equally  significant  Zavestoski  
election  of  four  new  Associate News Editor  
female senators, we may -------­ 

be hearing a lot more about these acronyms-as well we should. · 
Unfortunately, most men associate feminism with everything they fear about the movement: women obtaining power, the debunking of our patriarchal society, and the end of complete male domination. But whether these are legitimate concerns or not is of little significance. 
Men ought to realize that equality between men and women does not mean a man has to be any less of a person. In fact, Bill Clinton has said "Building up women does not diminish men." 
The primary problem that women face in regaining some sense of themselves is that most men refuse to recognize that there is a problem. Not unlike the Administration refusing to recognize homosexuals on this campus, men refuse to recognize their inherited dominant position over women. 
Men must come to understand how our values and the social structures in which they exist have failed to create an environment conducive to equality. Hillary Clinton may have likened marriage to slavery, but she was probably not too far from the truth. Actually, women are slightly better off than the slave. For her services, for being an object of the man's desire, she usually receives some sort of financial support. Until recently, however, she may have been subject to the same legal beatings, rapings and abuses to which a slave was subject under the institution of slavery. 
Every morning Orthodox Jews say a prayer thanking God they were not made a woman. Do not exclude your own patriarchal religion from such oppression of women. Ephesians 5:22-24 states "Wives, be subject to your husbands as you are to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife just as Christ is the head of the church." 
Ukewise, our political institutions continue to denigrate women. When the Republicans proclaimed a campaign of family values, they meant the patriarchal family in which the man has "legally and socially upheld prerogatives over the bodies and actions of his wife and children," according to feminist Naomi Wolf. 
The Democratic Party represents a "democratic family" in which all family members have equal say. Compare the Quayle's who would force their daughter to carry a child to term if she were pregnant, and the Clinton's who both have careers and have a raised a daughter who can think and make decisions for herself. 
_In t~e end, wha~ we have chosen in electing Bill Chnton to president of the United States, is a step toward equality not only in terms o economics, race or on other fronts, but on the gender front as well.

NATIONAL Principal's alleged killer dies 
PORTLAND, Ore. -A teacher who allegedly confessed to fatally stabbing his principal over a critical job appraisal died Thursday, more than three weeks after police shot him as he tried to flee. Steven Clark Foster 41, died shortly before noon, said Susan Klein, ~ spokeswoman for Emanuel Hospital. The cause of death was under investigation. Foster was indicted Oct. 16 on charges of murder and aggravated murder in the death of Allan Dean Gallagher, principal of Eastham Elementary School. Court documents said Foster told C!ackamas County sheriff's detective Lancer Meharry the mght.of Oct. 12 that he had murdered the principal after learmng that he was would be required to improve his performance as a special education teacher at the school. 
Town sues woman over pig 
GUILFORD, Conn. -Dolly may be down on the farm, but the owner of the 750-pound swine is in trouble. The town is suing Deborah Gallagher, seeking $90,000 in damages for allegedly violating an order instructing her to get the porker out of her backyard. Gallagher was arrested in June on three counts of violating the public health code by keeping the pig on her property from June 1991 to July 1992, but the state dropped the criminal charges after Gallagher took Dolly to a farm July 23 
Condor dies from drinking antifreeze 
LOS ANGELES -A rare California condor that died in the ~ld last month suffered kidney failure after drinking antifreeze. the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said Thursday. Officials said the bird, named Chocuyens, app~rently came acr?ss a puddle of antifreeze left by a vehicle at the Pyramid Lake recreation area. Chocuyens was f?und dead Oct. 8 on a rocky ledge near the lake's dam m Southern California's Angeles National Forest. Officials said the bird was probably attracted by the sw~et flavor ~f et~ylene glycol, one of the ingredients of antifreeze. B10logtsts had set the bird and a companion free Jan. 14 as part of a plan to reintroduce California condors to the wild. Only 63 California condors exist all but one in zoos. Six more are to be released into the ~ld in December.

Snipers shooting at Florida drivers 
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) ­
Debra Lewis has a bullet lodged 
in her jaw and can't hear out of 
her left ear, the effects of a 
sniper attack on Interstate 295. 
"When you go on 295 right now ... it's playing Russian roulette," she said Thursday. 
Such attacks and a fatal as­sault by rock-throwers prompted the American Auto­mobile Association to warn motorists away from the road ringing the south and west sides of Jacksonville. 
State officials and some busi­ness owners are concerned the unusual warning will harm Florida's image on the eve of winter tourist season, though the state's own visitors' center is advising motorists to avoid the road. 
About 19 confirmed violent incidents have been reported 

since June and 100 other re­ports are unconfirmed by po­lice. One motorist died July 4 when he was hit in the head with a piece of concrete and lost control of his car. There have been no arrests. 
Sheriff Jim McMillan said he is asking the Florida National Guard for help in providing night-vision equipment and possibly troops to patrol the highway. 
"This is not vandalism or a malicious act. This is attempted murder," he said. · 
Police suspect several people have been -involved, including copy cats. 
Lewis, 38, said she is in favor of whatever can be done to stop the violence. 
"I just hope they catch who­ever it is," she said.

CONSIDERATIONS ... ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE 
, 
t 
~ 
I 
I 
I 
I ) 
I., 
Recent Observer reports and commentaries appear to be sending confusing signals relative to the evil inherent in homosexual activity. 
In his book, Homosexuality And The Christian Way of Life, Father Edward A. Malloy, President of the University of Notre Dame, observes (p. 132--133) that homosexual activism did not emerge in this country until the 1950s and '60s. That explains, in part, why, among pre 1960 adults, there is outrage directed at the growing acceptability of this sexual deviation. 
Moreover, he shares the opinion of numerous scientists that the "evidence against the genes as the cause of homosexuality is strong" ( p. 65). 
The Church has long held that there are four sins which "cry to heaven for vengeance": willful murder; THE SIN OF SODOM; oppression of the poor, widows and orphans; and defrauding laborers of their wages. 
Further, the Church has consistently taught that there are nine ways of being accessory to another's sin: by counsel; by command; by consent; by provocation; by praise or flattery; by concealment; by partaking; by silence; and by defense of the ill done. 
THE CRIME OF SODOMY IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 
The crime of sodomy takes its name from the town of Sodom. It involves men having carnal relations with other men (GENESIS 19:5 ). Because of that crime the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed by "fire and brimstone." (GENESIS 19:23,24). 
Speaking to Moses, Yahweh commanded that the sons of Israel "must not lie with man as with a woman, and characterized this unnatural act as "a hateful thing." (LEVITICUS 18:22). 
Also, Yahweh disclosed to Moses that this crime, and other unnatural sexual practices, prompted God to "vomit out" inhabitants of Canaan from their land and give it to the Israelites. Any person who performs such a hateful thing "must be cut off from his people. " (LEVITICUS 18:25, 29). 
Yahweh added: "The man who lies with a man in the same way as with a woman: they have done a hateful thing together; they must die, their blood shall be on their own hands." (LEVITICUS 20:13). 
EZEKIEL instructs us that the Israelites were worse than the inhabitants of Sodom. The latter, we are told, were steeped in the crimes of "pride, gluttony, arrogance, complacency .. and they never helped the poor and needy." Also, they "engaged in filthy practices" in front of God, and that is why He "swept them away as you have seen." (EZEKIEL 16:47..51). 
The Old Testament frequently recalls the awesome destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, which was brought on by the unnatural crime of the inhabitants of those cities. See, for example: PSALMS 9:5..6, 11..6; WISDOM 10:6..8; ISAIAH 1:9, 3:9, 13:19; and JEREMIAS 49:18. 
THE NEW TESTAMENT AND SODOMY 
In ROMANS 1: 19 ...32. St Paul echoes the words of the BOOK OF WISDOM (1:3...6; 13:1.. 19; 14:12..27). He says some men, refused to recognize the handwork of God evidenced in the natural world, and began adoring strange gods. As a result, God "delivered these people up to shameful affections. For their women have changed the natural use into that use which is against nature. And, in like manner the men, also leaving the natural use of the women, have burned in their lusts one towards another, men with men, working that which is filthy, and receiving in themselves the recompense which was due to their error... 
"Being filled with all iniquity, malice, fornication, avarice, wickedness, full of envy, murder, contention, deceit, malignity, whisperers, detractors, hateful to God, contumelious, proud, haughty, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents ..., who, having known the justice of God, did not und~rstand that they who do such things are worthy ofdeath-and, not only they that do them, but they also that consent to them that do them." 
In 1 CORINTHIANS 6:9.. 10, Paul says: "You know perfectly well that people who do wrong will not inherit the kingdom of God: people of immoral lives, idolaters, adulterers, catamites, sodomites, thieves, usurers, drunkards, slanderers and swindlers will never inherit the kingdom of God. These are the sort of people some of you were once, but now you have been washed clean, and sanctified, and justified through the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and through the Spirit of our God." 
Again, in 1 TIMOTHY 1: 9 .. 10, the Apostle to the Gentiles observes that the Law of Moses was never intended for good people, but "for criminals and revolutionaries, for the irreligious and the wicked, for the sacrilegious and the irreverent; for people who kill their fathers or mothers, and for murderers, for those who are immoral with women or with boys or with men, for liars and for perjurers, and for everything else that is contrary to sound teaching that goes with the Good News of the gospel that was entrusted to me." 
The LETTER OF JUDE instructs: "The fornication of Sodom and Gomorrah and the other nearby towns was equally unnatural, and it is a warning to us that they are paying for their crimes in eternal fire. " 
ST. JOHN, "the Apostle of Love," wrote in his Second Epistle: 
"Whoever revolts, and continues not in the 
doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that 
....------------------.._------~ 
Friday, November 6, 1992 The Observer pageS 
continues in the doctrine has both the Father and the Son. "If any man comes to you, and brings not this doctrine, receive him not into the house, nor say to him: 'God speed you.' For to so greet him communicates with wicked works." 
HISTORICALLY    
As Father Malloy rightly observes: "The evidence against the genes as the cause of homosexuality is strong" (p. 65 ). And he further points out: "We are fairly sure that homosexuality is learned by some combination of influences at a time after birth. It is unlikely that a homosexuality identity is firmly fixed until the age of civic majority. But the more immersed an individual is in active homosexual experience, especially in the context of the public gay subculture, the harder it is to change. 
(p. 98, emphasis added). 
Every culture in history, Fr. Malloy notes (p. 3-), has "declined to accept homosexuality as a normal or desirable behavior pattern . [and] there is no major religious tradition which gives its official approbation to homosexual conduct." 
CONFUSING THE TROOPS 
We know that the confusion rampant among many today. Some of this bewilderment is caused by an excessive sense of Christian charity, and some is precipitated by "false teachers," of whom St. Peter, in his Second Letter, says: 
"As there were false prophets in the past history 
of our people, so you, too, will have your false 
teachers, who will insinuate their own disruptive 
views and disown the Master who purchased thefr 
freedom.... there will be many who copy their 
shameful behavior and the Way of Truth will be 
brought into disrepute on their account... " 
A confusing signal was sent by Campus Ministry in the October 1 edition of The Observer, when it offered gay and lesbians of the campus community a "nonjudgemental" friendly and compassionate welcome, and proffered, "if appropriate," to bring them into contact with others similarly situated. 
Confusing, too, are issues which Campus Ministry finds "unacceptable." On the one hand it holds that "harassment of gays and lesbians, or anyone else, whether intentional or thoughtless, whether through cruel jokes or in idle conversation, is simply unacceptable." On the other hand, the Ministry-on this campus dedicated to the Mother of God, -was strangely silent about the acceptability of the ridicule of her son, God Himself, when "The Last Temptation of Christ" played on campus, and when Notre Dame Magazine, not too long ago, questioned the reality of Jesus Christ and His Divinity in an article titled, "Who Do They Say I Am." 
RESOLVING THE CONFUSION 
To resolve any confusion, Catholics have always been taught to follow the Magisterial teachings of the 
Church. 
Fr. Malloy does that in his book (pp. 218..219), by noting the natural law teaching of the Church which holds that homosexuality is inherently wrong because: it is contrary to the procreative purposes of sexual intercourse; it is an attack on the basic unit of society, the family; it is deficient in the potential for complementarity between partners; and it is a deliberate pursuit of sexual pleasure in the absence of a stable framework for mutual growth and sharing. 
Moreover, Fr. Malloy makes a statement in his book which is strongly at variance with Campus Ministry's '"nonjudgemental' friendly and compassionate welcome" to homosexuals. when he observes (p. 106): "What has been happening during our period of history is that the greater tolerance of gay life, both in theory and in practice, has created conditions which are conducive to more explicit organization of the personal, social, economic and political lives of different types of homosexuals." 
He also declares (p. 341 ): "Since I find the homosexual way of life, including the most positive expression of it (namely, stable couples) to involve the pursuit of a disvalue, I do not see how the Church can pretend to give approbation to its continuance. Even para..liturgical rites [i.e., "Gay Masses," etc.] are an overt manifestation of support and encouragement. Otherwise, why go to all that bother. It is for this reason that what may seem like a small, insignificant accommodation of the tradition to pastoral necessity may create a climate of gradual acceptance. This is surely part of the motivation of the Christian theologians who propose it." 
WHY THIS MESSAGE? 
BECAUSE I share Fr. Malloy's conviction (p. 328) that the homosexual way of life   is irreconcilable with the Christian way of life." 
BECAUSE I also believe his prophecy (p. 328) has come true. That is, the the homosexual community has succeeded in contending, through a sympathetic media, that monogamous heterosexual marriage (and family life) is a sexist and oppressive institution and [must be] replaced by some up to now untried forms of sexual institutionalization. 
BECAUSE I have waited and waited for some other reader of The Observer, or for a scholar in this free exchange environment, to speak out in support of the Church's teaching on this issue. So far, one has done so. 
BECAUSE these following words of Pope Felix III, cited by Pope Leo XIII, in his Encyclical Letter, Inimica Vis ( 1892), moved me to write this commentary: 
"An error which is not resisted is approved; 
a truth which is not defended is suppressed, 
[and] . he who does not oppose an evident 
crime is open to the suspicion of secret 
complicity."

Special Mass recalls Sacred Heart is basilica SECURITY BEAT 
MON., NOV. 2 
Special to the Observer 
The Vatican decree designat­ing the University of Notre Dame's Sacred Heart Church a minor basilica will be read at a special mass in the basilica Sunday at 10 a.m. 
Bishop John D'Arcy of the Fort Wayne/South Bend diocese will be the presiding celebrant and homilist. 
An English translation of the Latin decree describes Sacred Heart as "a well known temple which traces its foundation even to the 17th century" and as "an outstanding testimony to the widespread labor of mis­sionaries as well as to their re­sourcefulness." The decree was authorized by Pope John Paul II last year on Nov. 23. 
The designation of a minor basilica is an honor which the Vatican extends to historically important churches or signifi­cant centers of worship and devotion. 
Mass was first celebrated in the present Sacred Heart in 1875, and it was officially con­secrated by· Bishop Joseph Dwenger of Fort Wayne on Aug. 15, 1888. 
The Basilica of the Sacred Heart is served by priests. brothers and sisters of the Congregation of the Holy Cross and is the main church for the University and the Sacred Heart parish. 
A history of the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, titled "A Spire of Faith," by Thomas Schlereth, professor of American Studies at Notre Dame. was recently published by the University of Notre Dame's Alumni Associa­tion as part of the University's Sesquicentennial celebration. 
5:47 p.m. Notre Dame Security/Police and Notre Dame Fire assisted a Pangborn resident who had accidentally cut herself with a knife at the South Dining Hall. She was transported to St. Joseph Medical Center tor further treatment. 
TUES., NOV. 3 
4:06 a.m. A Notre Dame Security/Police officer cited a South Bend resident for speeding on Edison Rd. The suspect was taken to the county jail on an outstanding warrant.

Judge: USX steelworkers should receive pensions 
SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -A judge has sided with 1,900 steelworkers who accused USX Corp. of deliberately closing a mill in 1986 to cheat them out of millions of dollars in pension benefits. 
Attorney Gerry Spence, declaring a "victory of mam­moth proportions," said the workers could collect in excess of $100 million in lost wages and pensions. 
But USX said damages would be between $5 million and $10 million. The company denied wrongdoing and said it might appeal. 
U.S. District Judge Bruce Jenkins. who awarded the damages, said the exact amount would be determined at future hearings. The ruling, signed Tuesday, came 17 months after an eight-week trial. 
Jenkins ruled that USX closed the profitable steel-making plant simply to save on pension costs. He also said the company illegally changed its pension plans several times in the months leading up to the plant closure. 
The Orem mill was closed in 1986 and sold in 1987 to Basic Manufacturing & Technology of Utah, which became Geneva Steel of Utah. Spence said USX's plan was for its workers to lose all or part of their pension benefits by going to work for the new company, which also paid lower wages.

Some out of race for Cabinet seats 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Within 48 hours of Bill Clinton's elec­tion, three potential candidates had already removed them­selves from the running for top administration jobs -Okla­homa Sen. David Boren, and retired Admirals William Crowe and Bobby Inman. 
Speculation had all three as possible CIA directors in a Clin­ton administration. 
Crowe "is not interested," said aide Jay Coupe. A former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President Reagan, Crowe endorsed Clinton and gave him the imprimatur of the defense establishment when the presidential candidate was under fire for avoiding service in Vietnam. 
Crowe has not had any dis­cussions with Clinton about the CIA job or about becoming sec­retary of defense -another position for which he has been prominently mentioned, said Coupe. "Forty-seven years in service is enough," he said. 
Inman, a former deputy CIA Director, said in an interview 

TAl!.bATE PICNIC. so YOU CAN ENJOy THE GAtvlE! 
GRAPE. 'CLEVELAND 272·1922 
that he was not interested in a 
fulltime Washington job. 
Boren, outgoing chairman of the Senate Intelligence Com­mittee, has told Clinton he is not interested in the job and would rather focus on other policy areas such as taxes and campaign finance reform, said an informed source who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Boren's counterpart on the House side, Rep. Dave McCurdy, also an Oklahoma Democrat, appears still in the running for the job. 
Current CIA Director Robert Gates may be asked to remain for several months after Clinton takes office in January to ensure a smooth transition, said informed sources who also asked not to be identified. 
Clinton probably won't make any announcements of top jobs until next week. 
But as the guessing game picks up steam, these names are emerging as possible con­tenders for other positions: 
Secretary of Defense: Rep. Les Aspin of Wisconsin, Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia. 
Secretary of State: Rep. Lee Hamilton of Indiana, Los Ange­les lawyer Warren Christopher, Nunn. 
Secretary of Commerce: John Scully of Apple Computer Inc., Mike Walsh of Tenneco Inc., John Young of Hewlett-Packard Co., Robert Rubin of Goldman Sachs & Co.

Clinton to change health care 
Sweeping reform plan to be released 
NEW YORK (AP) -For the nation's $800 billion health care system, it'll be further evo­lution, not revolution, under Bill Clinton. 
The shift toward managed care and limiting drug-price in­creases will be accelerated un­der the Democratic president­elect, who has promised to un­veil a sweeping reform plan within 100 days of taking office. 
But those trends had been taking shape long before Americans elected the Arkansas governor president. Even with a cooperative Congress, substantial changes aren't likely much before 1995.

Clinton is taking on the 
enormous task of trying to ra­
tionalize a baffling system of 
impressive technology, miracle 
treatments and runaway costs. 
The system has become a significant cause of government deficits that are undermining the economy. It affords the world's highest quality health care, but only to those who can pay. 
"These are extremely com­plex problems and you need to recognize there is no single so­lution," said James Buckley, a principal at the accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick. 
A cornerstone of Clinton's plan is to embrace the esti­mated 35 million Americans without health insurance. While that will create a surge in the demand for care and drugs, some experts fear their mass influx into the system might prove difficult to handle, even if phased in over several years. 
Because many of these people live below the poverty line and have gone without care for so long, they are likely to be, on average, less healthy than the rest of the population. 
Caring for them -along with 25 million others considered "underinsured" -will require close cost monitoring and a stress on preventive treatments like inoculations to avoid higher than expected medical costs, said Sheryl Skolnick, a vice 
president with Advest Inc. in 
Washington. 
Managed care networks, 
which limit a patient's choice of 
doctor and hospital and closely 
scrutinize treatment to restrain 
costs, will probably shape up to 
be the biggest beneficiaries of 
Clinton's reforms. 
Businesses already have learned they can save about 15 percent by having health main­tenance organizations provide their employees medical care as opposed to buying traditional health insurance, which costs about $3,575 per worker~ each year for a large company. 
This year for the first time, a majority of workers in mid-to large-size companies are en­rolled in managed care plans, according to a Peat Marwick survey. 
For drug companies, already under fire for hiking prices at three times the inflation rate in recent years, a Clinton admin­istration promises harsher scrutiny. Clinton has proposed cutting special tax breaks for drug makers that raise prices faster than average incomes. 
"It seems very likely that we would see some move on the part of Congress early on to take a stab at regulating drug prices because it's one of the easiest and most politically palatable targets," said Skolnick.

monitoring Bosnian airfields on Friday to ensure compliance with a military flight ban, Gen. John Wilson, U.N. chief military observer, told a news confer­ence in Zagreb. 
He said 44 observers would be deployed initially to 16 air­fields in Bosnia, Croatia and what remains of Yugoslavia. The U.N. expected to increase the number of monitors to 76 by mid-December, he said. 
The flight ban agreement was signed this week by Bosnia's Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, and Bosnia's Muslim foreign minister, Haris Silajdzic, as well as by leaders of Croatia and Yugoslavia. 
The no-fly zone was estab­lished to stop air raids by Serb forces who have about 40 jets and helicopters left behind by the Yugoslav army when it withdrew from Bosnia last summer.

Officials of some interna tional charities say friendly Somalis have warned them their agencies could become targets. 
Violent events occur daily. 
On Thursday. gunmen made off with a white United Nations van in Mogadishu. 
The day before, two Somali workers were shot at the port when they refused demands to hand over two sacks of grain headed for the starving.

Irish two-party coalition government collapses 
DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -The unhappy two-party coalition that has governed Ireland since 1989 collapsed Thursday in a complex dispute that was set off by a controversy over sales of Irish beef to Iraq. 
The government lost a vote of confidence 88-77, opening the way for Ireland to elect a new government on Nov. 25. 
With unemployment exceed­ing 20 percent, the economy looms as the main election is­sue. The ballot also will include proposals to change Ireland's abortion law to allow travel abroad for an abortion, distri­bution of information about abortion abroad, and the right to abortion in Ireland to save the life of the mother. 
Speaking to legislators in the Dail, or Parliament, after Thursday's vote, Prime Minister Albert Reynolds said: "I deeply regret the decision by our partners to create instability and effectively undermine my government under a poorly disguised pretext of self-righ­teous moral indignation." 
Reynolds, 60, who replaced Charles Haughey as prime min-
killed in the process of trying to feed them," said Rhodri Wynn·Pope, team leader in Somalia for CARE lnterna" tional. 
The U.N. military commander in Somalia. Pakistani Brig. Gen. lmtiaz Shaheen, this week urged relief agencies to take extra precautions. 
Ian MacLeod, spokesman for the U.N. Children's Fund. said all aid workers were warned to avoid unnecessary move­ment and not to travel at night." 
The United Nations and pri­vate agencies have about 200 people working in Somalia and hope to more than double that number before Jan. 1. Their mission is to get food, medieine and other aid to 2 million people at risk of starvation. 
ister and leader of the Fianna Fail party in February, has made no secret of his distaste for the coalition with the small Progressive Democrat Party. 
Fianna Fail won 77 seats in the 166-member Dail in June 1989, and the six Progressive Democrats provided a bare ma­jority. 
But the partnership was ac­rimonious from the start. 
In January, the Progressive Democrats -founded by Desmond O'Malley after he was expelled from Fianna Fail in 1984 -threatened to force an election unless Fianna Fail dumped Haughey. The party turned to Reynolds, making him prime minister in February. 
The issue that led to Thurs­day's no-confidence vote was a judicial investigation of the gov­ernment's support for huge exports of Irish beef to Iraq in the late 1980s. 
Iraq refused to pay more than $200 million owed to Irish cattle baron Larry Goodman, leaving Irish taxpayers to ab­sorb the loss and politicians pointing fingers.

Major's fortunes plummet, but treaty vote is in his favor 
LONDON (AP) -Six months before U.S. voters swept Bill Clinton into the White House, it was John Major who was being hailed as the new generation's victorious candidate. 
But the fortunes of 49-year­old Major have since plum­meted. 
Even his wafer-thin victory Wednesday night over rebels in his Conservative Party who op­pose the Maastricht treaty on European union appeared more of a reprieve than a turnaround. 
He has a 21-vote majority over all the other parties com­bined in the 651-member House of Commons. But the vote defeating a Labor motion calling for a delay in ratifying the union treaty was just 319­313. 
The vote was largely sym­bolic, since the treaty still faces committee hearings, but it be­came a crucial test for a gov­ernment struggling with a pro­longed recession, embarrassing U-turns in monetary policy and a hastily abandoned plan to close most of the nation's coal mines. 
A defeat would have gravely undermined Major's authority and thrown new doubts over the future of Maastricht, which already has been rejected in a Danish referendum. 
The Maastricht accord, forged by European Community leaders in the Dutch town last December, calls for closer political and economic coopera­tion among EC nations by the end of the century, including a common currency and a united foreign policy. 
Some opponents in Britain fear it would mean giving up national sovereignty. Major ar­gues that Britain's influence in Europe hangs on ratifying the treaty. 
Major's popularity ratings have hit a record low for any British leader since polling be­gan in the 1940s; his charm and his unpretentious manner are now read by his critics as weakness and dithering. 
Major, a protege of Margaret Thatcher, succeeded her in November 1990 to become Britain's youngest prime minis­ter this century. 
"I saw a continuation of Mar­garet Thatcher's policies," Conservative Party campaign fund-raiser Lord McAlpine re­marked in a recent television interview. "Looking back, of course we hardly knew him. But he seemed to be a very de­cent, sensible sort of chap."

The hit parade of neo-fascist groups includes Hungary's Dwarf Minority and Healthy Head Skin, France's Legion 84, Germany's Storm Troop, Bri­tain's No Remorse -a refer­
ence to the Holocaust  - and  
dozens of others.  
Czechoslovakia's  white  

supremacist Orlik, which split up after it was banned, sold 100,000 records last year, an amazing number in a small nation. 
Although the phenomenon is not new, the numbers of such groups -and their appeal ­are rising in relation to an in­crease in xenophobia and rightist violence, particularly in Germany. 
Under fire for their plodding response to neo-Nazi attacks on foreigners, German officials only recently began listening to the movement's musical mes­sengers and probing a company in Cologne that records and sells music by Europe's biggest neo-fascist bands, including to 
U.S. markets. 
In Britain, authorities are prosecuting a record distributor with a paraphernalia product list that includes Ku Klux Klan T-shirts. 
But another blatantly neo­fascist distribution company in France, Rebel European in Brest, has operated interna­tionally for six years. In Hun­gary, slick fan magazines openly cater to followers of skinhead music. 
Although people who study the skinhead scene differ on the degree such music works as a recruiting tool, they agree it provides a universal bond and common currency to white right-wing rings. 
It gives them an identity. Kids in Poland, Germany, France all wear the same T-shirt," Robson said. 
The bands themselves fre­quently team up for impromptu concerts, usually in white work­ing-class districts.

In Oct., less claim to be newly jobless 
WASHINGTON (AP} -New unemployment claims in late October fell to 360,000, the lowest in more than two years, the government said today. 
The Labor Department report, considered a sign of hope amid other more dismal economic news, said claims fell by 16,000 from 376,000 the week before. 
In advance, economists had been looking for an increase of 5,000 to 10,000. It was the lowest number of weekly claims since the week ending Aug. 4, 1990, near the start of the recession, when 354,000 Americans filed for jobless benefits. 
In another report, the de­partment said the productivity of American workers increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.6 percent during the July-September quarter, the best showing in six months. 
The department also reported that labor costs, a measure of inflationary pressures, rose slightly but remained at the lowest level in a year. 
Meanwhile, a moving four­week average of unemployment claims, considered a more reliable indicator of labor market trends than the usually volatile weekly numbers, also hit a new low. The average was 371,500, the lowest since the four-week period ending Aug. 2 5, 1990, when the average was 371,000. 
Economists cautioned that the number may look more favor­able than actual labor market conditions. Since the start of August, some unemployed people have been eligible for benefits under a special emer­gency program passed by Congress last summer. 
Had those claimants been in­cluded, the latest weekly num­ber would have been 22,456 higher. The moving four-week average would have been 22,745 higher. 
However, even factoring in the emergency claims, the trend is still positive.

Administration won't defend new cable law 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The 
Justice Department said 
Thursday it would not defend a 
provision of the new cable 
television law that requires ca­
ble operators to reserve up to 
one-third of their channels for 
relaying the signals of local 
broadcasters. 
But the department will battle the cable industry's First Amendment challenge to an­other part of the law that forces operators to negotiate with the local broadcasters over the terms, including possible payments, for relaying their programs. 
In a letter to the Senate, the Justice Department noted that President Bush himself felt that the "must-carry" channel­reservation provision was un­constitutional and said so when he vetoed the cable TV act. His veto was overridden. 
The letter, by Assistant At­torney General Stuart Gerson, said that "The department would not substantively and could not ethically take a different position at this time," from the president. 
That triggered protests by the National Association of Broadcasters and a consumer group, both of which lobbied for the law. 
Bush administration says drug war works 
WASHINGTON (AP)-The Bush administration claimed Thursday it has fresh evidence its war on drugs has been working-a study showing de­clining cocaine use when sup­plies dwindled and prices rose. 
The study was released just two weeks after the govern­ment reported that cocaine-re­lated visits to hospital emer­gency rooms during the first three months of 1992 hit a record 30,103, wiping out ear­lier gains and exceeding the record set in the fall of 1989. 
The study was based on data between 1986 and 1991. Re­leased by the Office of National Drug Control Policy and paid for by the Bush administration, the study by Abt Associates of Cambridge, Mass., that said co­caine use fluctuated in that pe­riod depending on its price and availability. 
"Supply reduction efforts are an indispensable ally of demand reduction programs," said White House drug czar Bob Martinez. "By making drugs more expensive and difficult to obtain, they help reduce drug use."

sor at Columbia University Medical School, said a basic flaw in the study was that it as­sumed drug supplies can be reduced or halted with more law enforcement. 
Cocaine "is too easy to smuggle in and it's too easy to grow. It's much more cost-ef­fective to treat addiction," said Kleber, who was an assistant director of the drug control policy office during the first half of the Bush administration. 
He said the fluctuations in drug use cited in Thursday's study may very well be accurate because they coincide with disruptions in Colombia cocaine cartels. "But the point is that it was temporary," said Kleber. "If you wiped out all the co.caine" in the world, it would soon be replaced by other growers and smugglers. 
The findings also were chal­lenged by the Drug Policy Foundation, a frequent critic of the administration's drug war. 
"Cutting supplies is the age­old theory behind prohibition," said foundation spokesman Kennington Wall. "But it doesn't really work." 
Wall also questioned the ac­curacy of the Abt study's premise. "More drugs have been coming in" to the country since the mid-1980s, he said, despite law enforcement efforts to catch smugglers and dealers. 
The Abt study said it gauged cocaine use by reported emer­gency room hospital visits, deaths from cocaine use and cocaine use among people ar­rested by police.

Judge appoints a new governor for Arkansas 


LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -Lt. Gov. Jim Guy Tucker should take on the duties of the governor and hold both offices for the remaining two years of President-elect Clinton's term, a judge ruled yesterday. 
However, the state Republican Party and the attorney general's office both said they would consider an appeal once a written order is issued. 
In a ruling from the bench, Circuit Judge John Plegge said the constitutional amendment that created Tucker's office and automatically replaces the governor with the lieutenant governor should apply. 
He rejected two other pro­visions that suggest a special

KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) -George Bush's neigh­bors are looking forward to a kinder, gentler way of life -for him and for them -now that this resort town will no longer be a presidential retreat. 
"He'll be able to walk the streets, talk to people," Karen Arel, executive director of the Kennebunk-Kennebunkport Chamber of Commerce, said Wednesday. 
"I'll be glad to see the 'KenneBushport' and all that Mickey Mouse stuff go by the boards," said Brian MacGillivray at Allison's restau­rant. 
Sure, merchants might get stuck with loads of presidential souvenirs: the "Summer White House" mugs, Bush Christmas tree ornaments and George and Barbara house slippers. 
But they'll be free of inconve­niences such as last year's protest by AIDS activists that virtually closed downtown over Labor Day. Or the march down Ocean Avenue by dozens of fisherman last spring. 
Gone too will be the hordes of reporters and Secret Service agents who follow the presi­dent. 
When Bush met with French President Fran~ois Mitterrand at Kennebunkport in May 1989, nearly 500 reporters overwhelmed this seaside community of 4,500 on the southern coast of Maine. 
Bush has vacationed in Ken­nebunkport every summer since he was a child, except when he was serving as a pilot during World War II. He and his wife own a nine-bedroom home on rockbound Walker's Point, a peninsula that juts into the Atlantic. 
But after becoming president, Bush seldom ventured into town except to drive to the golf course.

Tucker, a former con­gressman, had filed to run for governor in 1990, but withdrew after Clinton made clear he would seek a fifth term. Tucker ran for lieutenant governor instead. 
Under Arkansas' constitution, Tucker serves as governor when Clinton is out of state. The provision put Tucker in the governor's shoes for most of this year. 
Under the watchful eye of Clinton's chief of staff, former banker Bill Bowen, Tucker kept a lid on the state's troubled Medicaid program and won the admiration of many legislators and state officials. 
Republicans are pushing for a special election. Sheffield Nelson, head of the state GOP and Clinton's 1990 foe, has said he would run. 
Attorney General Winston Bryant has said a court could find merit in any of the three constitutional provisions. Bryant, a Democrat, has not taken sides publicly.

Allen stresses need for stable US, South Korean relationship 
By JASON WILLIAMS 
News Writer 
Ronald Reagan's former National Security Advisor told students and faculty that maintaining stable economic and security relations with South Korea is essential if the United States wishes to retain an ally in the Pacific rim. 
Richard Allen, Regan's top security aide and a Notre Dame graduate. focused on past and current US­Korea relations in an address given yesterday. 
"Basic trends in Korea have been exceptionally healthy for both them and the United States," Allen said. "Success is the intent-the objective of US policy, and our policy with Ko­rea can be qualified as a resounding success." 
He sighted increasing GNP. steady military presence (albiet funded by the United States) and increasing economic influence as evidence for South Korea's emergence as a stable entity in the Far East. 
"Korea's GNP and economy are growing very rapidly." Allen said. "Because of this. Korea has become a major player in both regional and global terms." Allen also said the 1988 Summer Olympic Games helped the rest of the world become aware of Korea's potential for influence. 
"The Summer Olympics of '88 opened up Korea to the world." he said. "It was unbelieveable to watch a nation open up it's shell-it will never be the same again." 
Allen's personal following of Korea dates 20 years prior to the '88 Games. His initial experience with the nation was during a visit as an advisor to President Nixon in 1968. 
"I sensed deep, fundamental trouble when I was there in '68." he said. ''I've watched Korea carefully for over 20 years now, and have seen the advances they've made." 
The Republic of Korea has approximately 42 million citizens, with over 10 million of those persons living in Seoul. Their GNP exceeds $270 billion while the per capita income averages $6,500, a number Allen says is relatively high compared with other Asian countries. Allen said South Korea would expand even more if it would change some of their internal policy. 
"They have had a persistent refusal to open all their markets," he said. "To make an investment in Korea can be a nightmare. Korean bureau­cracy is huge and always working." 
Allen feels elimination of this red tape would lure more US investors into Korea, benefiting both countries. 
"Korea remains to be a very good bet for US investors," he said. "Our special relationship is worth cultivating. We won't find better partners to do business with in Asia than with the Republic of Korea." 
Allen is currently chairman the Richard Allen Company, an international consulting firm and chairman of Federal Bank. 
Allen's visit was made in part of a Korean-US Prospectus sponsored by the Notre Dame Council on International Business Development.

Administration to impose punitive tariffs on Europe 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The Bush administration today announced its intention to impose punitive tariffs on $300 million worth of European imports that would effectively triple the wholesale price of white wine coming into the United States. 
The trade sanctions were announced by U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills. She said the administration had no choice but to impose the 200 percent tariffs, although she said she hoped the bitter trade dispute could be settled before the higher duties actually took effect. 
She said the duties would not go into effect for 30 days to allow white wine shipments already in the pipeline to reach U.S. shores. 
President Bush said the action would not lead to a trade war. President-elect Clinton said. "I don't want to comment on it." 
The United States had been threatening to slap punitive tariffs on European products because of the subsidies European countries provide to farmers who grow soybeans and other oil seed products. 
Currently, the United States imposes a tariff of about seven cents per bottle on wine imports. However, if the new punitive tariffs goes into effect on Dec. 5, the duty will jump to 200 percent of the import price of the wine. Thus, wine costing $10 at the wholesale level would face $20 in U.S. tariffs, pushing the price to $30. 
The administration's target list includes all white wine shipments from 
Europe. The United States primarily gets 
European white wine from France, with 
smaller amounts also coming from Italy 
and Germany. 
Officials said the list does not include red wine imports from Europe or so­called sparkling wine, such as cham­pagne. However. Hills issued a second list of some $1.7 billion worth of European products, and said unless the Europeans successfully resolve the trade dispute within the coming weeks, she would pick additional items from that list to slap higher tariffs on. 
The new list includes not only farm products but also industrial goods as the administration attempted to spread the economic pain in an effort to bring pressure on European negotiators to settle the dispute. 
Officials said that 90 percent of the $300 million worth of products targeted represented white wine imports. The other 10 percent will cover wheat gluten, which is primarily used as a binder in pet food. and rapeseed oil, which is used in cooking oil. Germany is the primary source of both of those items. 
Officials of the 12-nation European Community have already threatened to retaliate by hiking tariffs on American products. but Hills said the administration would not be dissuaded by such threats. 
"For five years. the EC has refused to provide the United States what it is clearly owed under international trading rules," Hills told a news conference. 
Lawyer: Keating's transactions were legitimate 
LOS ANGELES (AP) Transactions that Charles Keat­ing Jr. allegedly made to swin­dle investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars were legiti­mate business dealings, his at­torney told a federal jury. 
The former Lincoln Savings chief and his son are being judged on hindsight for deci­sions made during the real es­tate boom of the mid-1980s -a boom that went bust, Stephen Neal said Tuesday during his opening argument. 
"Now we're looking back and saying -'Oooh, why did they make that deal?"' Neal said. 
Keating's fraud and racke­
teering trial was to continue to­day in U.S. District Court. 
Prosecutor Alice Hill said that phony land deals in Arizona and other fake transactions created false profits that wound up on the books of Keating's American Continental Corp. parent of Irvine. Calif.-based Lincoln Savings. 
Those transactions allowed Keating to sell investors bonds that turned out to be worthless, Hill said. 
Thousands of investors lost a collective $250 million. Many were retirees who lost their life savings. 
The collapse of Lincoln Sav­ings in 1989, when federal au­thorities seized it, cost taxpay­ers $2.6 billion. 
The federal case against the 68-year-old Keating charges him with 7 3 counts of conspir­acy. racketeering and fraud in an alleged scheme to dupe in­vestors in junk bonds issued by American Continental. 
Keating is accused of devising a fraud that bankrolled huge salaries and jet-set perks for his family and business associates while bilking buyers of worthless seturities. 
He faces a sentence of up to 525 years in prison if convicted of all charges. His son, who is charged with 64 counts, could be sentenced to 4 7 5 years. The two also could be ordered to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in damages to pur­chasers of now-worthless bonds. 
Ms. Hill said the phony deals began in 1986, when the elder Keating earned more than $2 million in salary and other compensation. His son earned $900,000 that year. 
Robert Wurzelbacher, a Keating son-in-law who is one of eight former associates who have struck plea bargains with the government. made $950,000 in 1986. 
Reactions to Clinton mixed 
(AP) -World financial 
markets were restrained 
today. with stocks and the 
dollar mixed after Bill 
Clinton's much-anticipated 
victory over George Bush. 
"The way the financial mar­
kets are reacting, it's a little 
bit of anticlimax," said David 
Brown. an economist with 
Swiss Bank Corp. in London. 
The dollar was mixed in 
oversea.c;; dealings and contin­
ued that trend when trading 
opened in New York. It fell 
against the British pound. 
quoted at $1.5600, down a 
penny from Tuesday's closing. 
The dollar fell slightly against 
the German mark to 1.5604 
marks from 1.5675 Tuesday, 
while it rose to 122.575 
Japanese yen, up from 
122.40. 
The dollar's mixed perfor­
mance overseas came amid 
speculation that Clinton's eco­
nomic plan would help the 
greenback. European 
currency traders said at 
midday they were holding off 
on further selling of the dollar 
until trends became clear in 
the New York market. 
The London stock market. slightly lower in midday trad­ing, took the election in stride despite Clinton's campaign pledge to enforce taxes on for­eign companies operating in the United States. Dealers said traders were more influenced by Clinton's promise to galvanize the U.S. economy, which they believe will outweigh the higher tax threat. 
The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was down 3.4 points at 2,702.2. 
In Hong Kong, stock prices closed sharply higher as con­firmation of Clinton's victory triggered a wave of bargain­hunting, which not only erased early morning declines but sent share prices surging in the afternoon session.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Avoiding service was wrong 
Dear Editor: 
I write this letter in response to Professor Phelps's moving letter about her father. Not hav­ing come of age during the Vietnam War I cannot speak to the emotional battle that was being fought in the American psyche. However, perhaps I can speak of its aftermath, for it is during this time that I came of age. 
President Elect Clinton's de­cision not to serve during the Vietnam Conflict was not what disturbed me most. After all the posturing back and forth over his position, I was left with the feeling that the issue was unfo­cused. 
Many Americans (who today are patriotic participants) did what they could to avoid the draft. But President Elect Clin­ton seemed to go one step fur­ther. He could have joined the National Guard or Reserves and served with honor, but he didn't. He could have served his community in the Public Health Service, but he didn't. He could have served a greater constituency in the Peace Corps, but he didn't. 
He just didn't serve. When the smoke cleared this is what struck me most. Not his position on the war, not his avoidance of the draft, but his avoidance of service. 
The aftermath of Vietnam is not the war itself but the dam­age it did to the idea of service to one's country. I can remem­ber in the mid-1980's being called a baby-killer by some be­cause I was on a Naval ROTC scholarship. 
When I tried to explain to

people that I was joining the service solely to serve my country I was trying to explain what had become a foreign idea. I was talking WW II values but people were listening with Vietnam era prejudices. The aftermath of Vietnam resulted in contempt for the traditional values of Duty, Honor, and Country. 
To some those words are a catch phrase for conservative dogma, they are to be sneered at and belittled as a dinosaur from an era long since gone. 
But what Professor Phelps's letter points out is that era cre­ated heroes and leaders. It created people who were not afraid to speak out or strive to do something to make this world a better place. 
It created a generation of doers who led this country with single-minded determination. We shou1d not forget that this era gave us President Kennedy who called for us to serve, and in answering his challenge we looked to him as an example. 
The Vietnam era has given us the cynics who say that honor is dead. It has given us a shaken faith in ourselves and this country. It has damaged our confidence and tarnished· our honor. 
This is why I took exception to President Elect Clinton's avoidance of the draft. He will call upon all of us to serve, but we cannot look to him as an example. He will ask the best of us, but he may not have given the best of himself to this country. I see this as a fundamental tragedy. 
The election is over and a time for healing is upon us. I

did not vote for the new Presi­dent but I wish him well. My first priority is the nation and that far outweighs the pettiness of politics. 
I hope the new President will grow, and that he will seek to govern all of America. I hope that he will elicit the best from us, as we elicit the best from him. He is my Commander in Chief and he has my loyalty. 
I do not believe that the val­ues of my Father and Professor Phelps's father are forever lost. I believe that they beat in the heart of all of us. I believe that as a nation we will discover them after neglecting them for too long. 
I know a woman who served in the Persian Gulf during the war. She and her husband of two weeks volunteered to go because they heard their country's call. In the end she was sent but he was not. 
She met many of the troops and marveled at their bravery and sense of duty. She came home to parades and a renewed respect for those who serve in uniform. She was proud because she had lived up to the creed of Duty, Honor, Country. 
Today she hopes that this country will not be afraid to once again embrace those ide­als. You see, the woman I write about is me. I hope you won't be afraid to embrace these ideals. I hope that we can unite behind them and forge a better nation, a better tomorrow, a better faith.

A word from the Viewpoint Editor.   
Every semester, well-intentioned readers seem to forget the purpose of an opinion page such as View~oint.. . 
People forget that there are a lot of offensrye views m this world no matter where you stand on the Issues. And people ten'd to forget that the purpose of an opinion page is to bring views, all views, out into the open where they can be examined, responded to, and e':en con<;femned .. 
So if you're, not offended ~n occa~wn while readmg Viewpoint, we re really not domg our JOb. 
Another misconception readers have is that because Viewpoint prints something, we mus~ then:fore agree with it. That would mean that we at VIewpomt are pro­life and pro-choice, we must have voted f~Jr Bus~. Buchanan, Clinton and Brown, and we must thmk sex IS right and wrong before marriage. 
Others think that because we're the most widely read debate forum in the Notre Dame community that we should censor what is not politically correct, in the status quo or sometimes what is not even sane. 
Some say it would be better if we rejected some of the more outlandish editorials we receive. But we're not in the business of sweeping opinions under the rug, no matter how extreme. 
After all. what better way to deal with an extreme point of view than to print it in a public forum and allow the readers to respond? The best cure for darkness is to bring it out into the light of public inspection. 
And we allow readers to bring a lot of issues into the light through letters, columns, cartoons, and more re­centiy. quotes 3:nd poetry. We've print~d letters from convicts to presidents and everywhere m between: We don't discriminate and we don't compromise. 
Ironically, some of the most hateful responses. to material we run come from readers who perceive themselves as liberals. But how liberal is a person who wants to silence another because their views differ, even if the difference is astronomical? 
But we do have limits. They are the following: We won't print personal slander, libel or redundant material. But being liberal in the full sense is often frightening, because it means allowing anyone to say anything. 
Most recently, people are upset about an obscure col­umn we printed that was sent to us from a resident of New Mexico. And the response from readers has been terrific. Readers are speaking out against the injustices of the column in a way only anger could inspire; 
So stay tuned. Monday we'll have a whole load of re­sponses from people who may have never taken the op­portunity to write, educating people on a subject with some obvious misconceptions.

Bush failed to deal with domestic predicament 
Bong Miquiabas · Guest Columnist 
In what may appear to be a brazen disservice to a freshly booted president, I plead for calm. We can finally repose from the campaign frenzy and consider the import of our re­cent presidential election. 
Less than two years ago, Ge­orge Bush "Galluped" high in the political saddle amid effu­sive public opinion. Today, the leader of the awesome multi­national effort that quashed the world's fourth largest army ac­quaints himself with the idea of retirement. (Perhaps he will play horseshoes somewhere in Maine.) 
Foreigners may stand aghast, "What kind of democracy could and would let this happen?" Americans query more pertinently, "What did George Bush do to orchestrate his own demise?" 
Clinton's chief strategist, the wily James Carville, put it best, "The economy, stupid!" When the giddiness of our Desert Storm homecomings waned, a sickly economy knocked persis­tently at America's, and even­tually, the White House's door. 
Equipped with no economic initiatives of his own, Bush dithered between conflicting advice: either deny that the sit­uation was as bad as it seemed 
or insist that the crestfallen 
economy would cure itself. 
Regrettably, Bush embraced 
intermittently both pieces of 
counsel, and doing so proved 
pathetically insufficient for his 
candidacy. 
Here we detected the Presi­
dent's first real chink in his 
erstwhile impenetrable coat of 
statesman's armor-an inabil­
ity to grapple with a troubling 
domestic predicament. (See L.A. 
riots also.) 
What is more, the economy enfeebled Bush unnecessarily. Any sensible leader would have examined the economic malaise in exhaustive detail, carefully pointing out the symptoms of the 'illness' and diagnosing the best, even if painful, "medicine" for recovery. While some may brand this clinical conclusion as politically naive, we should recall the scenario. 
Bush convinced the world that "naked aggression" in Kuwait would not stand, and in large measure, he delivered on his word by decimating Iraqi forces. 
If our commander-in-chief could inspire nations to join him, we rightfully asked our­selves why could he not bring similar determination and suc­cess to the economically battle­weary American? 
Politically speaking, for Bush accrued political capital, namely the bipartisan good feelings shared after the war, was foolish. 

One can only hypothesize that Bush did not foresee the sickly economy crippling him as badly as it did. And what of the impending election season? God forbid that Bush hasten to allay the primary concerns of voters! 
What emerges in the imme­diate analysis is a president who was strangely unrespon­sive to the extent of people's woes, the worst of which were wrought by a struggling econ­omy. 
This attitude, in fact, served the president his coup de grace Bush enjoyed at least ten months, an eternity in cam­paign seasons, to present a guiding economic plan. Nobody even expected panacea. 
Sadly for his backers, the President neglected to produce anything close to visionary. A more meaningful message prevails, however, over this dramatic political collapse, and it eclipses the presidency and citizenry alike. 
There is but one answer to the first question, "What kind of democracy could and would let this happen?" Answer: an effective one. One of democ­racy's most becoming beauties lies in this verity: leaders must 
the populace because accountability awaits them. 
Fearful Republicans may la­ment, and understandably, a two-thirds Democratic majority in the federal government. But democracy promises that, should these leaders fail us, we can peacefully show them the door. 
It is a truth whose implica­tions simply escaped Mr. Bush. For the sake of our country, let us all learn from history, once again.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Urban Plunge provides opportunity, experience 
Dear Editor: 
Perhaps you have glanced at the flyers that describe what the Urban Plunge is all about --forty-eight hour immersion into inner city life, opportuni­ties to experience conditions of poverty, injustice, and apathy existing in our cities, and the privilege of meeting with peo­ple who work to improve social justice in the inner city. The Urban Plunge is all of these things and more. 
The Urban Plunge allows the participants to meet the people who experience poverty, homelessness, and social jus­tice daily. Being able to talk with people who wrestle to live everyday puts a human face to ideas like poverty and home­lessness that may seem ab­stract to those who have had little or no contact with the in­ner city. 
Urban Plunge provides the opportunity for Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students to discover the individuality and the diversity of our brothers and sisters who struggle day to day to survive; brothers and sisters who are often portrayed as a monolithic people. 

When I participated in the Urban Plunge two years ago, I did not know what to expect, and I did not expect to meet some of the most interesting people in my life. My Urban Plunge experience changed the way I viewed social injustice and the people who I encoun­tered during my Plunge. 
I knew then and I know now that I alone cannot change the world, but my Urban Plunge opened the door and showed me that I have a responsibility to serve my community in my own way. 
The Urban Plunge will not be the same for everybody and not all people will be affected the same way, but each Urban Plunge experience is well worth the adventure.

Letter author clarifies statements 
Dear Editor: 
l am writing in response to Annie Linehan's letter (The Observer, Oct. 30, 1992) in which she seemed outraged over a statement I made in a prm.ious letter. 
I would like to take this opportunity to clear up any misconceptions over that statement and to publicly reply to her assailments on me. 
First of all, she quoted me extremely out of context. She used the quote "abortion is even worse of an evil than rape or slavery." She mistakenly left out the words "I feel." She made it seem like I was making a statement of fact rather than opinion. That quote is how "I feel," so by no means was I im­plying it to be a fact of life for everybody. 
If one objectively read the en­tire paragraph in which that quote is take, he or she would see that I was trying to reveal the horror of abortion by comparing it to other evils such as rape and slavery. By no means was I trying to lessen the evilness of human bondage or of a sexual assault. 
The severity of different evils depends on the individual who is merely voicing my opinion. Linehan's letter was based on an edited quote of mine, and I feel it was unfairly publicly slandered. 
She asked me "Have you ever been raped, enslaved, or preg­nant?" I ask if she has ever had her skull crushed and her limbs torn from her body? 
Has she ever been·scorched to death by hot saline solution? Has she ever been vacuumed into a machine that sliced her up into many pieces? She doubts that I have ever been enslaved or raped. and I doubt if she has ever been aborted. 
"Have you ever been raped, enslaved, or pregnant?" What has society come to when pregnancy is considered as bad as rape or slavery? Society has become wicked, very wicked if that is the case. 
Linehan feels that I have no busine;:,s speaking about rape, slavery, or abortion, since she assumes that I have never been personally associated with any of those. 
First of all, I feel she has no right in making assumptions about me when she does not know me as a person. 
Second, do people have to go through an experience to have the right to talk or form opin­ions about it? There are many things that we know and un­derstand about life although we never personally experience them. 
Take gynecology, for example. Many gynecologists are men, so naturally they can never un­dergo a gynecological exam. Does this mean that men c(\n­not be experts on the female reproductive system and there­fore should not be gynecolo­gists? 
Then she says, "I do not un­derstand where you came up with the audacity to share that statement with the Notre Dame community." As an American, I have the right to voice my opinion on any topic matter wherever and whenever I feel it necessary. 
It is called freedom of speech, and I thank God that I have that right. Otherwise. I would be silenced by those who do not want others to speak publicly about controversial issues. 
She goes on to ask, "Would you side with the rapist in forcing the woman to raise that child due to your belief that abortion is a far worse evil?" I would not "side with the rapist" on any account, and in regardsto forcing the woman to raise the child, as a society we must never forget (although we already have) that adoption is the life-giving answer to "unwanted" babies. 
Finally, in her last statement, Linehan called me coldhearted and ignorant. Naturally I took offense to that, especially since she does not personally know me. In regard to being cold­hearted, please read my entire letter from Oct. 8. 
If Linehan or anyone else feels that I am heartless and incompassionate after reading my Oct. 8 letter, then I am re­ally living in a lurid and crazed society if protectors of life are construed as coldhearted and ignorant, and those who pro­mote abortion are thought to be warmhearted and educated people.

Snite Museum exposes 
students to culture with a 
By KEVIN DOLAN Accent Writer 
H 
ow many students have visited the Snite Museum of Art recently? 
According to museum direc­tor Dean Porter, very few. 
The Snite is as good as they come, in terms of university museums, he explained. 
"This is your museum," said Porter. "Everything we do is done with students in mind-no admission, plenty of exhibi­tions and movies, formal tours. We have a lot to offer." 
The museum, located next to O'Shaughnessy on the southeast side of campus, has hosted exhibits by such art giants as Renoir, Calder, Picasso, and currently, Rodin. The Snite rotates its collection every three years, and runs approximately 12 to 14 shows annually. 
One of the most controversial exhibits hosted by the Snite featured works by Christo, who is famous for surrounding several small Florida islands with bright pink fabric that actually floated in the water, sparking protests from ecologists. 
"That was our best publicized opening," said Porter. "We had 1,100 people line up on a Sunday to see the 
opening of the show and the auditorium was filled to hear Christo speak." Exhibitions are the best way to tie art into education, according to Porter. 
"We try to get everybody involved," he said. "The best example was in 1986, when we .did 'The Age of Visari.' Theol­ogy, history and art were all tied in to one exhibit: that's the paradigm of what

ust who are Michelangelo, Donatello, Leonardo, and Rafael? If the first inclination 
is to say the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles than it's time for some cultural awareness. 
Various works of art are now on exhibit at The Snite. The numerous pieces include prominent sculptures by French sculptor Auguste Rodin, pho­tographs by accomplished photojournalist Elliott Erwitt, and sculptures by Frederick Beckman and Father Anthony Lauck. 
Rodin's bronze sculptures are on loan from the B. Gerald Cantor Collections. More than seven hundred pieces constitute the large, comprehensive private holding. 
Three of Rodin's greatest public com­missions-"The Gates of Hell," "The Burghers of Calais," and "The Monument to Balzac" are prime examples of single figures, portraits, and figural fragments. 
"The B. Gerald Cantor collections have brought this exhibition of sculptures by the world's most important French impressionist sculptor, Auguste Rodin, to communities of all sizes across America," said Dean Porter, director of the Snite Museum. 
"We are truly fortunate to have this collection in Michiana.," he added. 
Rodin was inspired by Michelangelo and Donatello, as well as the great French writers of the period, according to Stephen Spiro, chief curator at the Snite. 
"Rodin revolutionized sculpture by speaking the unspeakable in theme and form," said Spiro. 
The photographs by Erwitt include his famous series on dogs, entitled "Son of Bitch." 
The commercial photographer works as a free lance photographer and has done work in such noted magazines as Collier's, Look, Life, and Holiday.

As the catcher in the rye, Holden Caufield anguishes over the "perverts" who write "F-k you" on the museum walls where the little kids can see it. After the rest of us are dead, says Holden, the graffiti artists will still be in business, writing obscenities on our tombstones. 
On Tuesday, The Observer ran a letter to the editor which promoted recreational promis­cuity as a way of making friends: "Enjoy life, and do not to forget to have sex for the sake of having sex." The ideas were banal: nevertheless. they gained your attention, like the "F-k you's" that were an eyesore to Holden, because the message belonged in an outhouse, not a newspaper. 
Was the lad who wrote it pulling our leg, since he must know that intercourse so mindless could ruin the neighborhood? If he's sincere, he must be an artful dodger in need of neutering, like the dogs of which they speak when they call a spayed a spayed. 
It's the morning after Clin­ton's election, and I voted for the pro-choice candidate be­cause I believed the election needed to be decided on more than one issue. This doesn't mean that I intend to wring my hands and weep piteously as abortions continue at their ac­customed pace. 
Voting for the pro-life candidates Reagan and Bush didn't change anything, Maybe as Christians, we should not have expected it to. 
For centuries, churches have . been shooting themselves in the 
Father Robert Griffin 
heifers loa Bonefy 9ocf 

Christian community. 
It would tickle me to death if the Center of Social Concerns would set up meetings .with representatives from Planned Parenthood, to see if thoughtful people could agree on guide­lines that would eliminate the totally irresponsible abortions. 
For example, when a couple wanting a boy find out the the child they are expecting is a girl, or when fetuses are de­stroyed though the woman is seven or eight months along. 
If abortions now number a million and a half a year, could we prevent 100,000; 200,000; or 500,000 abortions annually by outlawing the sheer butchery of viable life? Isn't reasoning together to reduce gridlock the kind of thing Ross Perot would call for? 
Could we hold town hall-style meetings at Notre Dame, where doctors, lawyers, nurses, social workers, parents, clergymen, et cetera would meet to discuss how the number of abortions can be reduced? And if it worked here, why couldn't it work in other communities? 
To do this, we would first have to believe that pro-choice partisans are honest when they tell us no woman really wants an abortion. As pro-lifers, we would have to commit ourselves to being civil to them, come hell and high water. 
If some of them happened to be Catholic, we would be wise not to tell them about the Church's bell. book and candle which could leave them excommunicated. We should remember it is not our partisan differences that we should be concerned . about, but the women whose circumstances make childbearing seem like an overwhelming, unbearable tragedy. 
Notre Dame students are en­gaged in a successful project called Dismas House, which is run as a half-way hospice for offenders who have served jail terms. Could the Center for Social Concerns set up houses in which students, live-in or otherwise, could care for preg­nant women in some loving way, even if it's only looking after the siblings of the unborn, while their mothers work? 
One thing which should give a woman hope, if she's in trouble, is to know that caring love is available from a community of caring students who want her to have her baby, free of fear. Who in the world could be more loving and non-judgmental than students? 
I'm no Ross Perot. If I were, I would try to organize meetings and set up shelters myself. I do believe it is better to light one candle by trying to inspire others than it would have been to vote for four more years of voodoo economics. 
Ross Perot kept telling us: "They told me these things couldn't be done, and so I did it to show th_em how. But as long as we're in gridlock, we can't go anywhere." 
Must Christians remain para­lyzed by gridlock over abor­tions? Must pro-lifers and pro­choicers stand eyeball to eye­ball, waiting for the other fel­lows to blink? 
foot by the way they have looked at babies born, as the old phrase used to have it, on the wrong side of the blanket. I will not mention how quick church members have been to cast stones, or their willingness to give Hester Prynne her scarlet letter. 
If the churches hadn't been so quick to punish the unmarried mother and the child she bore, then latter-day Christians would be believed now when they claim to be heirs to a tradition which welcomes each chHd as though that child were the Messiah. 
Ross Perot has become an American folk hero because of the way he helped us keep our eye on the ball during the de­bates. "We have a four trillion dollar deficit," he kept saying, "on which we are paying a bil­lion dollars' interest every day. If we keep this up, what will be left for our children and grand­children of the American Dream?" 
The Catholic Church needs a prophet as clear-eyed as Perot to rescue the Church and the country which are bankrupting themselves spiritually because the country is so wasteful with unborn life. The abortion crisis is our equivalent of the four trillion dollar deficit. 
As Christians and Americans. 
we are grid-locked as pro­
choicers and pro-lifers. All we 
can know for sure about human 
sexuality is that we have 
poisoned the well. 
I want to believe that a 
woman has a right to control 
her own body. Then I hear of 
school-girls using abortion as a 
primary means of contracep­
tion, and I wonder who is talk­
ing to them. The fear is that 
these girls have become cannon 
fodder in a battle allegedly for 
human rights that the feminists .are waging. 
I hate to hear women who 
seek abortions called 
murderers. I hate the 
harassment they receive from 
the right-to-life zealots. 
Whether Wade vs. Roe prevails 
or is struck down, I fear the 
ugliness which is dividing the 
country the way slavery did. 
Where is the Ross Perot who 
can tell Catholics not only 
where the ball is, but also what 
it looks like? Somewhere along 
the line, we need to find out 
who we are as American 
Catholics. 
The lad is entitled to believe 
what he wants to believe. He's 
not entitled to think that 
promiscuity as a lifestyle 
deserves any respect in a

Camacho arrested on drug charges 

MIAMI (AP) -Yelling "I'm the Macho Man!" in a hotel lobby, three-time world champion boxer Hector Camacho was arrested early Thursday for allegedly fighting with two police officers who tried to quiet him. 
The former WBC super feath­erweight and lightweight champion appeared intoxicated and was carrying a small bag of what appeared to be mari­juana, police said. 
The incident occurred at the Miami International Airport Hilton Hotel. When police ap­proached Camacho, he ran out of the lobby into a parking area. 
"If you want what's in my hand, you're going to have to catch me," police quoted Ca­macho as telling the officers. 
Wearing a T-shirt bearing his nickname, "Macho," Camacho allegedly fought with the offi­
,.... 
cers as they subdued him. Later he kicked one of the officers while being booked into the Dade County Jail, according to police. 
One of the officers suffered a knee injury that required a soft cast, and the other was treated for cuts and bruises. 
The 140-pound fighter was arrested for marijuana posses­sion, disorderly intoxication and three counts of battery on a police officer. The substance he was carrying will be tested to determine whether it was mari­juana. 
Camacho, 30, was released on $16,000 bond. His Miami at­torney, Bill Tunkey, said the in­cident stemmed from "mistaken impressions." 
"Mr. Camacho is an excitable person who has a demonstra­tive personality," Tunkey said. "If you don't know him, I sus­
.., 
pect you may take from his ges­
tures and movements the idea 
that there is some threat in it, 
when in fact there is none at 
all. I think he was maybe in a 
boisterous mood and may have 
offended the sensibilities of 
some police officers." 
At one time Camacho held the WBC super featherweight and lightweight titles, as well as the WBO junior welterweight championship. In September, he lost a unanimous decision to WBC super welterweight champion Julio Cesar Chavez. Now 40-2 with 18 knockouts, he has no fights scheduled. 
Camacho has had at least two other brushes with the law in Florida. In 1988, he was ar­rested on cocaine and assault charges at Clewistown High School after allegedly pulling a gun on a juvenile. He received three years' probation and was fined $1,500 after pleading no contest to cocaine possession. 
Camacho was arrested a year ago on a charge of driving with a suspended license after being stopped for driving too slowly on an interstate highway near Fort Myers. A state trooper said Camacho had a woman on his lap and was trying to do "the wild thing."

ATLANTA (AP) -It was just over a year ago that Georgia's Garrison Hearst first found himself in "the zone." 
He's been in it so often this season that he's become one of the leading contenders for the 1992 Heisman Trophy. 
It started against Kentucky in 1991 when he raced 32 yards to score one of his two touch­downs in a 158-yard perfor­mance. 
"Mter that run I just got this feeling," he said. "It was really different. Weird. Something I'd never felt before. After that I started getting the same feeling a lot." 
He was in a groove, some­thing he decided to label the zone. 
"When I'm in the zone, I just feel really confident," he said. "Unstoppable. Like there's no hole I can't get through." 
He isn't the only one to have noticed. 
"Garrison Hearst gets through holes 99 percent of the guys in the country wouldn't think of getting through," said Dick Vermeil, the television analyst who coached the Philadelphia Eagles and UCLA. 
Hearst has spent most of the season ahead of the rushing pace set by former Bulldog Herschel Walker when he won the Heisman a decade ago. 
The current Bulldog star fell behind that pace last Saturday when he gained only 41 yards on 14 carries in Florida's 26-24 upset of Georgia. 
Through his first nine games, j/ Hearst has gained 1,273 yards

on 166 carries, a 7.7 average. At the same stage of the 1982 season, Walker had 1,413 yards on 277 attempts, a 5.1 average. 
It wasn't surprising that Walker went ahead in the Florida game. He destroyed the Gators throughout his three­year career, averaging 216.3 yards and scoring eight touch­downs. 
Hearst still has more all-pur­pose yards than Walker had, 1,552 to 1,498. His 8.3 per play average is three yards better than Walker's at the same stage of the season. 
"He's one heck of a ballplayer," said Paul Hornung, one of Notre Dame's former Heisman winners. "He's capable of breaking away and scoring on every play, and because of that he's not only an incredible running back, but he's also a very exciting player, a very dangerous player. 
"The fact that he has come on so strong and was so unex­pected adds something to the excitement that surrounds this player." 
It's more than excitement for Georgia coach Ray Goff. 
"He may be the most com­plete back we've had since I've been associated with Georgia," Goff said. 
A former Georgia quarter­back, Goff was on the coaching staff in the 1980s when the Bulldogs had such backs as Walker, Rodney Hampton, Tim Worley, Lars Tate and Keith Henderson. 
"As a blocker, he will physi­cally molest you," said Willie McClendon, the Bulldog running backs coach.

For the Miami ~j!· Heat, however, it's a chance to ·llj" ·put on a good show on the road. .il The Heat in four years of exis­~-~ tence has never won in Chicago, 'i ~ New York, Boston, Atlanta, '·' Cleveland, Detroit, Oakland,

draft. 
"The guy is awesome," Or­
lando point guard Scott Skiles 
said. "He's as good right now as 
any big guy in the league. He's 
going to be unreal." 
In other openers Friday night. 
it will be Minnesota at Boston, 
New Jersey at Philadelphia, 
New York at Atlanta, the Los 
Angeles Lakers at the Los 
Angeles Clippers, Washington at 
Charlotte, Chicago at Cleveland, 
Milwaukee at Detroit, Golden 
State at Utah, San Antonio at 
Sacramento, and Seattle vs. 
Houston at Tokyo. 
The Knicks, who won 51 games last season and took the Chicago Bulls to seven games in the Eastern Conference semifinals, have a revamped lineup with newcomers Rolando Blackman, Doc Rivers, rookie Hubert Davis, Charles Smith and Tony Campbell. 
But the go-to man for coach Pat Riley again will be the team's leading scorer in each of the last seven seasons, Patrick Ewing. 
"I don't see much of a change in my role," Ewing, 30, said. 




''I'm still here to block shots, 
score and rebound. There's 
definitely more balance, a lot of 
great players here and that 
should prove to be helpful in 
the long run. 
"Everyone is committed to 
working hard, making contri­
butions wherever they can. But 
that doesn't necesssarily mean 
that I'll be playing any differ­
ently." 
But with all the additional 
proven players at Riley's dis­
posal, perhaps Ewing will no 
longer have to be a dominant 
player for the Knicks to win. 
"With this group, it should take some of the burden from him," Riley said. "We'd like to get more balance, in that the opposition wouldn't know where the ball was going." 
But Riley still expects the Knicks' style to be getting the ball inside, especially to Ewing. 
"We're going to stay with it because it's a strength for us," Riley said. "The perimeter players are going to have to work ofT that."

No-D Bengals face Bears 
CINCINNATI (AP) -The Cincinnati Bengals carry a fa­miliar burden as they prepare for Sunday night's game in Chicago; they are last in the NFL in pass defense. 
The Bengals are allowing 264 yards per game in the air. They are on pace to give up 4,224 yards for the season, just 165 yards short of the NFL record. 
The New York Jets allowed the league-worst total of 4,389 yards in 1986. But the Jets still managed to finish 10-6 and make the playoffs that year. 
Making the playoffs is a tall order for the Bengals this year. They are last in the AFC Cen.. tral Division with a 3-5 record and are 1-3 in the division. Their 30-10 victory Sunday over Cleveland ended a five­game losing streak. 
All-Pro offensive tackle An­thony Munoz is still on the in­jured reserve list, suffering with strains of both shoulders. He is ineligible to play Sunday night against the Bears. But Munoz said he is feeling better and will lobby the Bengals to reactivate him when he is eligible to come off injured reserve the following week. 
"Its their decision whether to activate me, but rm going to tell them ru be ready to play." Munoz said. "I've had three weeks' rest now, and I think the key was not doing anything the first two weeks. 
"I gave the shoulders com­plete rest. and now I can lift weights much more effectively. I know I'm stronger. And heck, I'm just sleeping better at night because I don't have the pain... ' 
The Bengals and the Bears have played each other four times. with each team winning 
twice.

Chiefs weary of revived San Diego 
KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -A month ago, how tempting the Nov. 8 date with then-winless San Diego must have looked in Kansas City. 
The Chargers, 24-10 victims at home to the Chiefs in the season opener, were 0-4 under first-year coach Bobby Ross and their starting quarterback was out for the year. 
The Chiefs were rolling along at 3-1, and new quarterback Dave Krieg was playing as if he'd been reincarnated as a young Sammy Baugh. Making the playoffs wasn't their major worry, securing home field ad­vantage was. 
Now, however, the Chargers have found new life with quar­terback Stan Humphries and have won their last four games, as hot as any team in the league. The Chiefs, encounter­ing any number of problems, glitches and quarterback set­backs, are 1-3. 
All of which leaves the two AFC West rivals deadlocked at 4-4 and proves once more a team's opinion of itself is de­termined not so much by its record, but how that record came to be. 
The Chargers are 4-4 and trying not to feel overconfident. The Chiefs are 4-4 and wonder­ing, "Why us?" 
"The wins have helped us," agreed Ross, a Chiefs assistant under Marv Levy 12 years ago. "They've given us some confi­dence. But it doesn't do a thing for us when it comes time to play in the ballgame Sunday afternoon in Kansas City. 
"If there's one lesson I've

ers know this -you've got to

The Chiefs, who had last week off, are 6-point favorites against the Chargers, who beat Indianapolis 27-0 last week in their first shutout since 1986. 
Humphries, the AFC player of the month for October, was thrown into battle when John Friesz suffered a knee injury in the preseason. The one-time Redskins backup is hitting al­most 60 percent of his passes for 1,679 yards with seven TDs and 12 interceptions. 
The Chargers, whose defense ranks second in the NFL behind Dallas, have outscored their opposition the past four weeks 101-41. 
After a 27-3 loss at home to Pittsburgh, their sorriest per­formance in Marty Schotten­heimer's five years as coach, the Chiefs were glad to have their bye week. Judging from coaches' steely countenances all week, it's safe to say the players didn't fritter away their time. 
But does Schottenheimer feel better about his team? 
"Yes," he said. "The disap­pointment of our performance against Pittsburgh ... we're not going to forget that. But what's happened is we've had a chance to evaluate and analyze the things that have gone on, and where we need to improve. The players have worked their tails off. I think we're all going to benefit." 
A victory gives the Chargers their first five-game win streak since 1987, when Al Saunders, the Chiefs' receivers coach, was their head man.

Looking for an extraordinary gift from Notre Dame? Well, there's probably someone back home who would love to meet one of your great professors. To make that possible, the Alumni Association has just published the first four programs in the Notre Dame Great Teachers Series. Why? Because the university can offer something exciting for people whose college days are behind them but who haven't forgotten what a difference great teachers made in their lives. So we asked four of NO's outstanding professors to help us throw open a window for the mind and spirit. They responded with specially prepared lectures on classic works --works they have spent their careers studying and teaching. The result is an affordable, accessible, high-quality series of videotape or audiotape programs that each come with the appropriate books and suggested readings. 
Now the folks at home don't have to wonder what you've been up to. You can show them. They may not have told you this, but they would give their right arms to have the freedom and the time that you have to explore what Notre Dame can offer. So give a great gift to someone who's house-bound, career-bound or family-bound. Send them on an adventure this Christmas with a great teacher. 

Images of Man in Shakespeare's Tragedies Professor Paul Rathburn 
Shakespeare has never failed to move anyone who came to him and listened. In his major tragedies -Hamlet, Othello, Macbeth and King Lear-the greatest dramatist and poet in our language holds up a mirror to what is mysterious and uncontrollable in our lives. Paul Rathburn will help you see into that mirror-into Shakespeare's unforgettable and progressive visions of youth, passion, ambition and old age. Some have thought that these disturbing visions simply end in darkness and lack of meaning. Paul proposes that Shakespeare is never that simple, that he wrestled 
to the end with issues of fate and tlawed humanity. 
Professor Rathburn holds degrees in both Theology and English and has taught drama at Notre Dame since 1966. He is a Sheedy Award winner for outstanding teaching in Arts and Letters, and our students cannot find enough places in his courses. An expert on filmed versions of Shakespeare's plays, he offers invaluable advice on the films you will want to track down and. watch to experience the Bard at his most powerful. (Four lectures on videotape plus a text of the four plays.) 

The American Constitution and the People Who Made It Professor Walter F. "Jack" Pratt, Jr. 
In the summer of 1787, a remarkable collection of statesmen gathered to launch the greatest free deliberation about self-government in history. Out of it came the Constitution ofthe United States . The delegates faced an almost impossible task: forging consensus on a dramatically new form of government for the fragmented former colonies. Jack Pratt invites you to look in on their deliberations, recalling who these men were, what initially divided them and what ultimately brought them together. Then he explores the five Supreme Court decisions that have most influenced our interpretation of their work. What was at stake in each constitutional crisis, and why did the justices rule as they did? Not only will you meet great Amerians here, you will come to grips with the essence of our political experience. (Ten lectures on audiotape, plus text of The Federalist Papers and the Constitution.) 
A legal historian, Jack Pratt is Associate Dean of Notre Dame's Law School, and holds his D.Phil in Politics from Oxford and his J.D. from Yale. In 1978-79, he was Law Clerk to Chief Justice Warren E. Burger. His talks on the Constitution have drawn some of the highest ratings at the last two summer Elderhostel series on Notre Dame's campus.

Pascal's Pensees 
Federalist Papers & The Constitution 
The Divine Comedy 
Dante and Aquinas: The Road to Paradise 
Professor Ralph Mcinerny 
What did the cosmos look like to the two greatest geniuses of the Middle Ages? St. Thomas Aquinas, a Catholic theologian, took on the daunting and controversial task of relating twelve centuries of Christian thought and retlection to the rediscovered works of ancient Greek philosophers. Dante Alighieri, a poet inspired and informed by Aquinas, shaped one of history's most powerful visions of the human condition in The Divine Comedy, a journey through Heaven, Hell and Purgatory. Walk with Ralph Mcinerny as he explores the medieval world, the ideas of Aquinas and the incomparable poetry of Dante. You will come back from Paradise a different person. 

Ralph Mcinerny is the Michael P. Grace Professor of Medieval Philosophy, Director of the Jacques Maritain Center, and former Director of the Medieval Institute. At Notre Dame since 1955, he is perhaps as well known for his "Father Dowling" mysteries as for his prolific scholarship and sparkling teaching. He has delighted audiences as a guest lecturer at over 50 other colleges and universities. (Ten lectures on audiotape plus the text of Dante's Divine Comedy.) 
Pascal and the Meaning of Life 
Professor Thomas Morris 
Ever wish you had an inside track on the meaning of life? So did Blaise Pascal. A superb scientist and mathematician, Pascal gave us the first calculating machine, the first theory of probability and the first system of public transportation. Then at age 31, famous throughout Europe, he experienced a sudden, startling and thorough conversion of life. For the next eight years until his death, he thought and wrote intensely on the alternatives human beings face as they try to answer (or avoid!) ultimate questions. Tom Morris will introduce you to Pascal's famous Pensees-provocative, eloquent, urgent, deeply personal. Why should anyone wager that there is a God? How far is thinking about God going to get you? What is it that really drives the human heart? How can you know? Get some unexpected and extremely intriguing answers here. (Four lectures on video plus the text of Pascal's Pensees. 

Tom Morris has electrified student audiences ever since he took his Ph.D from Yale and started lecturing at Notre Dame in 1981. Winner of numerous teaching awards, Tom has been featured on The Learning Channel and speaks to rave reviews from adult audiences across the country. He is one of Notre Dame's most popular teachers with both students and alumni groups.

Auburn notified of NCAA violation inquiry 
AUBURN, Ala. (AP)-The NCAA sent Auburn an official letter of inquiry today charging exactly what former football player Eric Ramsey had claimed about illegal payments from coaches and boosters. 
The letter includes allegations that football coach Pat Dye knew about problems and didn't act on them. 
At a news conference, President William Muse said the letter contained nine allegations of rules violations, which he described as "major." 
They include: 
-A representative of university athletic interests provided cash and merchandise to a student athlete. 
-An assistant coach provided cash to a student athlete. 
-An athletic staff member provided cash on many occa­sions to a student athlete. 
-An assistant coach provided cash on one occasion to a student athlete. 
-A student athlete obtained a loan in violation of NCAA rules. 
-The university violated the principle of institutional control. 
-Two then-assistant coaches and a staff member acted contrary to the principles of ethical conduct. 
Michigan could clinch Big Ten title tie 
Wolverines to face Northwestern 
EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) ­Michigan's fourth-ranked Wolverines should clinch at least a tie for the Big Ten foot­ball championship Saturday when they invade Dyche Stadium to take on Northwestern. 
The Wolverines (7-0-1, 5-0) are bearing down on a fifth straight title and figure to ex­tend their record conference· winning streak to 19 games. 
But Northwestern (2-6, 2-3} could make it interesting if quarterback Lenny Williams can get his offense clicking. 
Both teams are somewhat miffed over last week's results. Michigan had to come from behind to defeat Purdue 24-17 after trailing 1 7-7 at the half. 
Northwestern fell to Michigan State 27-26 when Brian Leahy's last-play field goal was ruled no good. It was so close that some observers thought it could have been called either way. 
Williams passed for a career­high 365 yards against Michigan State. Lee Gissendaner is his main re­ceiver. Gissendaner has caught 45 passes for 521 yards but is a threat in other areas. 
Gissendaner leads the nation in punt returns with a 25.9 av­erage and last week he re­turned a kickoff 90 yards for a touchdown. 
"If we kick the ball like we have the last couple of weeks, this guy will kill us," Michigan coach Gary Moeller said. "He's a threat and we've got to do scored four different ways. Once on a punt return, once on a kickoff return, four times on passes caught and once rushing on a reverse against Notre Dame. 
better. The  problem is  our  
tackling."  
Gissendaner  already  has  

But against the Wolverines he will face a defense that is tops in the Big Ten in almost every category. 
"They're a much better team than they've been in the past," Moeller said. "Northwestern has not lost its enthusiasm. They're playing hard even though they haven't been winning. When they see Michigan walk on their field, they'll be fired up." 
Northwestern coach Gary Barnett started firing things up earlier in the week by saying "Michigan doesn't play fair" by using 12 men during substitu­tions. 
"It's illegal to run a guy into a huddle and then have the same guy run back off," said Barnett. 
Purdue coach Jim Colletto questioned the officials about the practice last week and Barnett picked up on it. 
Moeller said the incident at Purdue was late communication and "not us trying to take advantage of anything." No need. 
Elvis Grbac leads the Big Ten and ranks No. 2 in the nation in passing efficiency.

Lind ends Sandberg's Gold streak 
NEW YORK (AP) -For all the line drives and popups that Jose Lind caught this year with his Gold Glove, they'll never make up for the grounder that got away. 
Lind's error on a bouncer by David Justice was just the break the Atlanta Braves needed in the playoffs last month, and they turned the mistake into a three-run rally in the ninth inning to beat Pittsburgh 3-2 in Game 7. 
On Thursday, Lind was pre­sented with his first-ever Rawlings Gold Glove, ending a streak of nine straight wins by Ryne Sandberg of the Chicago Cubs as the NL's best-fielding second baseman. As happy as Lind was, the award could not compensate for the one error that could have cost the Pirates a chance to reach the World Series. 
"No, not at all," Lind said. "I just tried to catch that ball and I didn't. There's nothing you can do about it now." 
Lind led NL second basemen with a .992 fielding percentage this season, making only six errors in 745 chances. But he made two errors in the playoffs, including the big one in the final game. 
"It's awfully easy to pick out one guy, like Bill Buckner," said Andy Van Slyke, Lind's teammate and a fellow Gold Glove winner. "But we win and lose as a unit. We could've had a 4-0 lead and it wouldn't have made a difference." 
Van Slyke won his fifth straight Glove and was joined in

the outfield by Pittsburgh's 
Barry Bonds, who won his 
third. 
Other NL winners were Cubs 
first baseman Mark Grace, St. 
Louis shortstop Ozzie Smith, At­
lanta third baseman Terry 
Pendleton, Montreal outfielder 
Larry Walker, St. Louis catcher 
Tom Pagnozzi and Cubs pitcher 
Greg Maddux. 
The AL winners were Yankees first baseman Don Mattingly, Toronto second baseman Roberto Alomar, Baltimore shortstop Cal Ripken, Chicago third baseman Robin Ventura, Texas catcher Ivan Rodriguez, California pitcher Mark Langston and outfielders Ken Griffey Jr. of Seattle, Kirby Puckett of Minnesota and Devon White of Toronto. 
Smith's award was announced last month before he joined a Japanese tour by major league all-stars. Smith has won 13 straight Gold Gloves, the most in NL history; Brooks Robinson and Jim Kaat have won 16 each. 
Mattingly won his seventh Gold Glove and Puckett earned his sixth. White, whose catch against the center-field fence started a near-triple play in the World Series, won his fourth. Pendleton's award was the first for an Atlanta player since Dale Murphy in 1985. 
Rodriguez, at age 20, won in his first full season in the ma­jors. He is the second-youngest winner ever, only a week older than when Cincinnati catcher Johnny Bench won in 1968. 
Rodriguez threw out 48.6 per­cent of opposing basestealers, far better than the major league average of 33 percent. Rodriguez did it despite han­dling a staff of pitchers that is wild. 
"I don't mind blocking balls in the dirt," he said. "That's when I usually can make pickoff throws to first base." 
The Gold Gloves are awarded after a vote by opposing man­agers and coaches after the regular season. Though they are supposed to be given solely for fielding excellence, some believe that more than defen­sive statistics are considered. 
"This year, I thought I had no chance," said Lind, who batted .235. "I didn't hit that well, and maybe that has something to do with it." 
Lind won for his fielding, and did it despite using the same, small glove he has used since he was 13. The 28-year-old Lind said the mitt now has a two-inch hole in the heel, and that he gets a lot of balls against bare skin because he prefers not to catch them in the pocket. 
"I've got a ton of other gloves, but I don't use them," he said. "Now that I've won the Gold Glove, I'm going to keep using my old one." 
The awards to Smith and Pagnozzi gave the Cardinals a record 54 Gold Gloves since they were first presented in 1957. Ripken's second straight award gave Baltimore an AL­high 49. 
NEW YORK (AP) -Tony La Russa, voted American League Manager of the Year last week by the baseball writers, was named as Major League Man­ager of the Year by The Asso­ciated Press on Thursday. 
La Russa, who led the Oakland Athletics to their fourth AL West title in five years, received 7 5 votes in nationwide balloting by AP member writers and broadcasters. 
Phil Garner of the Milwaukee Brewers and Jim Leyland of the Pittsburgh Pirates tied for second with 50 votes, followed by Felipe Alou of the Montreal Expos with 40 votes. 
John Oates of the Baltimore Orioles got five votes, and Cito Gaston of the World Series champion Toronto Blue Jays got four. Bobby Cox of the National League champion Atlanta Braves and Art Howe of the Houston Astros received three 
LaRussa named AP Manager of the Year 
votes each. 
It was the second AP award 
for La Russa, named AL Man­
ager of the year by the news 
cooperative in 1983. The AP 
began selecting a Major League 
Manager of the Year the follow­
ing season. 
La Russa received a lot of 
credit for the A's success this 
seasons, juggling a shifting 
roster that saw 16 players dis­
abled for a club record 22 
times. 
"In the end, because it was so tough, it also was one of the most rewarding," La Russa said last week when he received the AL award. "No matter what the adversity, and it was piling on and on, this club just never gave in to it, and for that I'll never forget them." 
Oakland took over first place in the AL West for good on Aug. 4 during an eight-game winning streak, then used a 10-game winning streak to extend the lead over Minnesota to 8 1/2 
' 
games by Sept. 18. The A's won ·' the division by six games over the Twins. 
La Russa's task next season will be to reshape a changed team. Thirteen A's have filed for free agency, and general manager Sandy Alderson has said he wants to reduce the team's $47.5 million payroll.

Dallas 'D' seeks revenge from Lions 
IRVING, Texas {AP) -A Sil­verdome redemption is at hand for the Dallas Cowboys' defense, currently rated as the best in the NFL. 
It was the NFL's worst last season in the Cowboys' two ap­pearances in the Silverdome. Now, Dallas has passed Philadelphia as the stingiest defender in the league in a 7-1 run. 
Detroit's 1991 run-and-shoot offense shot defensive coordi­nator Dave Wannstedt's cre­ation to shreds. It wasn't so bad in a 34-10 loss during the regu­lar season because the defense gave up only two touchdowns. But the 38-6 playoff loss to the Lions was a disaster. The de­fense gave up 421 yards and five touchdowns. 
"They embarrassed us, beat us bad," recalled defensive 
SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP)­San Francisco 49ers quarter­back Joe Montana is throwing the ball again -without pain. 
Montana's agent, Peter John­son, said the quarterback threw 7 5 passes in an informal workout with teammates Wes­ley Walls and John Taylor on Tuesday and "felt great" afterward. 
"He's got no soreness, no pain, no inflammation, no fluid, so he's keeping his fingers crossed," Johnson said Wednesday. 
It was not known if Montana, who was placed on the injured reserve at the start of the sea­son, threw again on Wednesday. Montana reportedly was

MCC champion, and its players are focused on reaching the NCAA tournament, which the Irish narrowly missed last year. However, don't expect the team to look past these crucial tackle Russell Maryland. "We have something to prove against Detroit. We have to prove we can play well in the Silverdome and we have to prove we can handle the run­and-shoot. 
"People keep harping on it. We're ready to show what we can do." 
What Dallas coach Jimmy Johnson did after the playoff game was vow to upgrade his secondary. 
He drafted defensive backs Kevin Smith, Darren Woodson and Clayton Holmes, and ob­tained Thomas Everett from the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
"We wanted to upgrade the entire team talentwise but the last area we upgraded was the defensive backfield." Johnson said. "We knew we had to do it. 
"We didn't have trouble just with Detroit. We had problems with Atlanta and Houston dur­ing the regular season. We knew we had to make some changes. We feel we've done it." 
The Cowboys worked long and hard against the run-and­shoot in training camp in sev­eral scrimmages with the Oil­ers. They also played Houston twice in preseason. 
The Dallas "nickel" or pass defense package has improved to the point where the Cowboys are first in the NFL in third­down defense. 
"I predicted in training camp that our biggest improvement this year would be on defense," Johnson said. "Now we've got the talent, an outstanding scheme and an outstanding coach (Wannstedt). The biggest improvement on this team is the defense."

"I believe he threw today, but I really can't comment on it," 49ers coach George Seifert said Wednesday. "I haven't received any report on his throwing." 
The coach also downplayed Montana's return. 
"It's certainly not this week, and we'll just have to wait and see," Seifert said. "The doctors haven't told me that I should expect that (Montana's return) right now."

Seifert denied that it would create a problem to add Mon­tana to the practice team roster, which would allow the 36-year­old quarterback to formally practice with the team. 
"I don't particularly see that as being difficult, but it's noth­ing that I'm dealing with right now," Seifert said. "I don't think it's an issue."

Women host Bowling Green 

Tanya Williams 
By HALEY SCOTT Sports Writer 
The women's swim team takes on Bowling Green University tonight at 6 p.m. at Rolfs Aquatic Center. 
Last December Notre Dame had one of their toughest dual meets at Bowling Green, pulling out a 124-119 victory over the Falcons. This year the Irish will have the advantage of racing at home. 
Assistant Coach Randy Julian says that the women's team will have to focus on the middle distance and distance freestyle events. "Bowling Green is real strong in the longer freestyle events, they have an excellent breaststroker, and a freshman backstroker who will be a challenge." 
"They have a very strong breaststroker, and they are very competitive. It should be a really good meet," said senior captain Tanya Williams. 
Bowling Green's breaststro­ker Josie McCollough, who was a top eight finisher at the NCAA championship meet last year, will be a strong force to reckon with, according to Julian. In the freestyle events, Laura Yenglin will be out to continue her winning steak against the Irish. 
In order to win tonight, the women's team will have to race well and rely on the depth of the team. Sprinting will play an important role in the Irish victory; in the individual events and in the relays. At the same time, it will be key to place well in the distance and stroke events.

A Tough Transition 
Mike Miller still settling into Irish offense 

By ROLANDO DE AGUIAR 
Associate Sports Editor 
Raw talent can get an athlete a long 
way. 
Mike Miller knows this better than anyone. The sophomore was a track star in high school, a wide receiver rated as a first-team All-American by several scouting publications. According to the Athletics Congress, Miller's times in the 100 and 200 meters ranked third among American high school students. 
But genetically-determined abilities don't do it all for Miller anymore. As a receiver in Notre Dame's ground­oriented offense, the 5-7, 155-pounder has had to develop new skills in order to succeed. 
"I have needed to stop counting on my speed," said Miller, who has caught 10 passes this season. "I have had a lot to learn, and I realize that right now I am still not as sharp as I should be." 
Miller used to rely on speed alone to get open for passes. His 4.35 time in the 40 gave him the ability to dust defensive backs ofT of the line of scrimmage. Miller showed a flash of his speed when Rick Mirer connected with the sophomore on a 70-yard touchdown pass in the season opener against Northwestern. 
But at other times, Miller has been disappointing. He has dropped several passes and seemed confused on the field at times, prompting criticism by fans and press alike. But Miller contends that he is still learning the Notre Dame system. 
"Ray Griggs has been here for four years. Adrian Jarrell also knows a whole lot about our ofl'ense," Miller said. "If you asked them to name 100 plays that we run, they could probably name 98 or 99 right off the top of their heads. But right now, I can only name 40. 
''I'm not comfortable going out there and having to know exactly what to do. 
The Observer/ Macy Hueckel Wide receiver Mike Miller alludes the BYU defense in the Irish's 42-16 win two weeks ago. Though the sophomore has shown flashes of brillance, he has still not become a consistent contributor to the Notre Dame offense. 
The older receivers can read defenses and find holes immediately. But I haven't been able to do that well yet." 
Since Miller first arrived at Notre Dame in August of 1991, he has been on an emotional and physical rollercoaster. 
A hamstring injury during his first week of freshman practice slowed the heir apparent to Raghib "Rocket" Ismail to a crawl. Miller had not recovered from the injury when he was put in as Notre Dame's punt and kick returner during the early-season matchup be­tween the seventh-ranked Irish and number three Michigan. 
In that nationally-televised game, Miller was swamped by the Wolverines' coverage units, netting only 24 yards on four returns. The disappointing performance, combined with general homesickness and confusion about his place at Notre Dame, prompted the freshman to return home to Missouri City, Tex. 
After much time spent soul searching and completing part-time classes at the University of Houston, Miller decided to return to Notre Dame for the spring 1992 semester. 
"I was here last spring, and that allowed me to adapt to life here," said Miller. "This season, I have a whole semester under my belt." 
But even after his return, doubts lingered about Miller's commitment and his ability to succeed at Notre Dame. But Miller insists that any questions about his dedication to the Irish football team are 
· unfounded. 
"People have a tendency to feel sorry for me because of what happened last year," said Miller. "But I look forward to being out on the fieltl, and I always give 100 percent. I want to be able to help in any way possible." 
Miller helps the Irish in several ways. His most visible position is that of kickoff and punt returner. His punt return aver­age has hovered at about nine yards all season, but in a high risk situation, which can pay ofT with big gains, he has been one broken tackle away from sev­eral touchdown runbacks. And though Miller has returned only six kickofl's this 
season, his average holds at 33 yards per 
return. 
"I've probably had four or five opportunities to break touchdowns," said Miller. "I just try to go back and watch for things to happen in front of me." 
Not too much has been happening in front of Miller as a wide receiver. With Holtz's return to smash-mouth football in recent weeks, the Notre Dame wideouts have had to change their outlook. 
Now, instead of being the staple of the Irish offense, they are a device to help Reggie Brooks and Jerome Bettis burst through the offensive line. 
"I don't regret the return to the run," said Miller. "We as wide receivers have the opportunity to open up the offense. When things aren't going right, we have the chance to change that." 
At this point in the season, things seem 
"The older receivers can read defenses and find holes immediately. But I havent been able to do that yet." 
-Mike Miller 
to be going right for the Irish. Riding a three-game winning streak, the Irish have three tough games ahead of them on the road to a New Year's Day bowl game. 
But the first barrier is a Boston College team which is fired up to play the only other Catholic school in Division 1-A football. 
"Everybody is going to be up to play Notre Dame.,. said Miller. "If they could come in here and beat us that would make their whole season. 
"But Notre Dame is expected to win every week and win the national championship. That was one of the reasons I decided to come here. I want to win a national championship."

Eagles' all-around talent to test Irish 
By JENNY MARTEN Associate Sports Editor 
The ninth-ranked Eagles of Boston College (7-0-1) are land­ing in Notre Dame Stadium this Saturday for a battle with the eighth-ranked Fighting Irish (6­1-1). 
BC comes into the game rid­ing an emotional wave after upsetting Penn State in October and flying to its best record and highest ranking since the days of Doug Flutie. 
In addition, both schools bring potent offenses into the game with Notre Dame sporting the second most productive offense in the country into the game and Boston College boasting the sixth-ranked offense. 
"The biggest problem they pose is that they can both run and throw. You've got to find a way to stop (tailback Chuckie) Dukes, find a way to stop (quarterback Glenn) Foley, and then you've got to figure out a way to move the football against a defense that's one of the top 10 in the country," said Holtz about the Eagle football team. 
The Boston College offense presents a much different challenge then the top-rated Brigham Young offense which the Irish shut down two weeks ago because the Eagle attack features a deadly passing game which has tended to move the ball well in the air as well as a aggressive rushing corps. Three times this season, BC has racked up over 500 yards of total offense. 
The Eagles are led by junior quarter­back Glenn Foley who is rated third in the nation. Foley has completed 95 out of 167 passes for 1,524 yards in eight games for eleven touchdowns. The BC quarterback had a banner day in the upset against Penn tailback Chuckie Dukes heads the crew with 1,024 total rushing yards already this year. 
"He runs the ball a lot bigger then what he is," said Holtz of Dukes. "He has tremendous peripheral vision and does a tremendous job of finding the gaps and not many backs can do that. With his overall speed and quickness, he can find the hole and run through it." 
Fullback Darnell Campbell is still recovering from a knee injury, but was able to post a 100-plus yard game against Tu­lane. Fellow fullback Dwight Shirley is also building up some impressive numbers in the Ea­gle backfield. 
The Irish defense which con­tinues to improve will try and prevent an air raid of the Sta­dium with a secondary which has shot down some of the bet­ter pass offenses in the country in the last few weeks. Notre Dame also possesses a strong rush defense. 
The Boston College defense would like to register its fourth shutout of the year against an Irish offense which has moved the ball well recently. The Eagles' defense is currently ranked seventh nationally, giving up an average of 11 points per game and have given up less then 100 total points so far 
this season. 
Holtz ex­
pressed con­
cern over the 
Eagle defense. 
"I'm concerned 
about how we're 
going to move the 
ball offensively. 
They don't give up 
the big play and 
they tackle well," 
said Holtz. 
Leading the defense 
will be All-American candidate and inside linebacker Tom ~cManus and fellow linebacker Stephen Boyd. McManus 
has been named the Big East Defensive 
Player of the ~==-.,...,....,....---~,._..,.--' 
Week twice 
State running a "two­Eagles' QB Glenn Foley this year for 
minute offense" that produced two touchdowns in 57 seconds going into halftime. 
"I don't compare quarter­backs," said Holtz when asked to compare Foley and Rick ~irer. "Foley is an outstanding quarterback. Both are very tal­ented. Both are very unselfish and both play in football orga­nizations that are predicated on the run. Rick Mirer has more pressure because he is called upon to run the option." 
Foley's prime receivers in­clude split end Clarence Can­non, flanker Keith Miller and tight end Pete Mitchell. Mitchell leads the team with 28 recep­tions for 441 yards while Can­non has racked up 279 yards on 1 7 catches and Miller with 214 yards on 13. 
The key to the Eagle offensive attack could be the running game. Boston College enters the game with four games in which two of its backs rushed for over 100 yards apiece. Senior 
the Temple game and the Rutgers game. Boyd has 86 total tackles this year including four sacks. 
The BC secondary hopes to be equal to the task of keeping the ball out of the hands of Mirer's receivers. 
Free safety Charlie Brennan and cornerback Joe Kamara are looking to pick the pockets of the Irish as they have five and three interceptions respectively. Also in the defensive backfield will be strong safety Eric Shorter and cornerback Michael Reed. 
The defensive line is a com­bination of experience and freshness with two seniors, John Stolberg and Mike Mari­naro, and a redshirt freshmen, Chris Sullivan. The outside linebackers, Dan Kerr and Ja­son Pohopek, have combined for seven sacks for 4 7 yards. 
Two excellent defenses and two excellent offenses. Brace yourself.
