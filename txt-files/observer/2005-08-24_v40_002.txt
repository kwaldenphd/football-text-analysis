Jenkins aillls to symbolize ND values in ne-w presidency 

By MAD DIE HANNA Associare News Edimr 
Since taking office on July 1, University President Father John Jenkins has assumed more than a new title -he has become the human embodiment of Notre Dame. 
"The president has a symbolic role for the whole University," Jenkins said Tuesday. "You do things that are func­tional, you have meetings, you make decisions, and that's all important, but the whole dimension of playing that symbolic role ... even to the nation at large, the world at large, I think that is the thing that may be the most surpris­ing and has been the biggest adjustment."

Edward "Monk" Malloy for skillfully setting the tone for the University, Jenkins too has been set­ting his own tone. 

"I've spoken with the deans and chairs, I've spoken with various divi­sions in tho University and really I've tried to articulate what I think is impor­tant at Notrn Dame," Jenkins said. 
For the new president, that means focusing on several ideas. 
"We act with integrity. There's a sens1~ of teamwork here," he said. "Notre Dame has a spedal mission, and every­body has a leadership role and has to understand that, and in a way that reflects that leadership and excellence.

Frosh-0 gender tensions tackled 
Staffers, student government officials work to foster healthier environment between sexes

While Kyle Hocca enjoyed Freshman Orientation Weekend, something struck tho Walsh llall freshman as strange. 
Depending on whether Walsh was socializing with a men's dorm or women's dorm. she said, the mixer 1wents took on a deddndly difforent tone. 
"Any timo that we were with a girls' dorm was in a sit-down activity. With thn guys' dorms, it's always a physkal, touching activity," Hocca said Sunday, pointing to the intertwined limbs of Walsh and Alumni Hall freshmen doing the "liuman knot." 
"With girls it is not onn-on­onn, but with boys it's like, 'lh1rn's your datn,"' Hoeca said. "I've had fun, but it's awkward. It's not normal social function­ing." 
Hocea's obsnrvations spell out the feelings of many Notre liame students about Freshman Orientation weekend, the University's annual activity­packnd crash course in dorm life. Designed to allow new stu­dents to meet as many of their peers as possible while dis­tracting them from homesick­ness, Frosh-0 instead often becomes a source of lasting tension between the sexns at Notre Dame, students and University ortkials said. 
"Frosh-0 is the time during which initial impressions of campus culture and gender norms at the University are established in the minds of freshmen," said Ali Wishon, ehairpnrson of the Student Senate Gender Issues Committee. "By encouraging events that rninforce typical gender stereotypes and the col­lege 'hook-up' culture, we are setting a dangerous precedent for freshmen to uphold." 
Creating unhealthy relation­ships between the sexes is not the University's intended out­eomn for orientation weekend, said Ann Firth, Associate Vice President for Student Affairs. 
"Freshman Orinntation is simply how we welcome the

QUESTION OF THE DAY: How EFFECTIVE DO YOU THINK FROSH-0 IS FOR NO AND SMC FRESHMEN?
INSIDE COLUMN 

Sun1n1er lessons 
Another summer has come and gone, and so has the annual family trip up north to little Glen Arbor in northern Michigan. Although the idea of "family time" usually makes me cringe, this summer's trip caused me to see Maddie Hanna things a little dif­ferently. 
When I was little, Associate as our minivan News Editor crawled onto the freeway out of Milwaukee, the general mood was one of anticipation. But that youthful happi­ness always disintegrated quickly. My brother, two years my junior, was quite tenacious in our backseat battles. Still, he couldn't compete when I dug my fin­gernails into his skin. Thatmove was a winner. 
Once I turned 16, however, we start­ed taking two cars. By then, I'm posi­tive that if all four of us had driven together, someone would have died. Homicide kind of puts a damper on a vacation. The problem with two cars was that I often got stuck riding with my mom. Age 16 seems to be when mother-daughter tensions peak, and when you factor in my mom's need to stop every 20 minutes to use a rest­room, the journey was basically miser­able. 
This year, however, marked a new milestone for our family. My brother and I drove together. It seemed like a better option than slowly going insane with my mother. 
But this grand plan began to go downhill. Once we hit torrential rains in Chicago that forced many drivers to put on their hazards and pull over, my bro was fast asleep, leaving me to fend {(Jr myself. Almost immediately after opening his eyes, he insisted I drive faster. Given my sub-par driving record -an incident where I rear-ended a car last summer prompted my parents to say, "You might want to lay low for a while" -I like to cruise at a safe nine over. So I suggested he drive. 
This turned out to be a bad call on my part. I sat stiflly upright the whole time, mostly due to comments like "Oops, I didn't know we were going 100." There was also his road rage; apparently, anyone who passes my brother is a trashy (insert obscenity of your choice) here. Furthermore, I had to shell pistachios for him, since he decided to purchase the most incon­venient driving food possible from the gas station. 
It should also be noted that the car reeked of Slim Jims and feet. I don't even want to go into that one. 
Throughout the 10 hours of hell, I realized I have a soft spot for the kid, horrendous odors and all. He follows me around, trying to tell me stories to make me laugh. Sometimes he surpris­es me with insightful remarks that I never expected him to share with me. 
I've been gone a year now. I'm the token college girl that comes home and clashes with my parent<> over rules -. seriously, one time my mom tried to tell me I had parietals. But despite our dif­ferences, my family is still there for me. 
Even better is that my Notre Dame family was waiting for me when I got back.

N.Y. man in record book for eyebrow hair

Opening Mass marks ne-w acadetnic year 
By KATIE PERRY News Writer 
Thousands of Notm Damn fac­ulty, staff and studnnts flooded tlw Joycn Cnntnr Tunsday nV<ming to cnlnhratn tho hnginning of anothnr sdwol ynar at the Votive Mass lnd by Univnrsity Prnsident Fathnr John Jnnkins. 
Jnnkins, who snrvnd as homilist for the event. called on students to senk inspiration for "fresh insight, creative nndnavors and moral and spiritual growth." 
Citing the seven gilb of the lloly Spirit -wisdom. understanding, council, fortitude, knowledge, pinty and filar of thn Lord -the lirst-year prnsidcnt ealled for stu­dnnts to bn morn open to the iiwvitablo difTiculties that lie alwad in tho coming school ynar. 
"To rncnive these gilt<> we must lmconw morn rnc~eptive ... and aware of our own nnndinnss," Jenkins said. "Wn may havn to disrnantiP prnsent understand­ings and comfiJrtabh~ charities." 
()unstioning a career path, nxpnrinnr.ing tlw unc~asinnss of lirst arriving at NotrP DamQ and facing ac:adPmie dif'fic:ultios can all load to frnsh pnrspnctivns and innovatiw approadws to nvnry­day struggles, Jmkins said. 
"(;od's gilt<> somntinws eomn in strangn forms," Jnnkins said, dt­ing confusion, loneliness and strife as sonw unnxpm:ted fenl­ings in whirh onn c:an find those gifts. "It is nngativn rnomnnts like these that can load to new and positive insight." 
At the conclusion of his first homily as Notre Dame president, Jnnkins romindod students to have open minds and hearts to hardships along tho way which may later reap greater, more pos­itivn rewards. 
Many students were excited about opening Mass, not only bneause it marks tho beginning of another school year, but beeause of' the tradition of the annual event. 
"I love going to opcming Mass. It brings me back to the first Mass I went to as a freshman, which always rnminds me of how lueky I am to go to Notre Dame," said junior Claire McArdle. "You look around the JACC and see stu­dents sitting together, represent­ing fWery dorm. I love that there is sehool unity and that faith is yot another factor that unitos the student body. It is an inspiring way to start the school year." 
Following Mass, Basilica Hector Father Peter Hocca urged stu­dnnts to partieipato in Jenkins' presidential inauguration from Sept. 22-23, calling it a "historic IWOnt." 
As part of the eelc~bration hon­oring Notre Dame's third presi­dnnt in 53 years, he invited stu­dnnts to attend an academic eon­vocation as well as the actual inauguration eeromony and ball.

Fair caters to off-ca111pus students 
By MARY KATE MALONE 
News Writer 
Students living off-campus trickled into Notre Dame Stadium Monday afternoon to pick up football tickets and meal plans at the first ever ofl'-cam­pus fair -the brainchild of the new student government admin­istration of Dave Baron and Uzzi Shappell. 
Designed to inform the stu­dent body and provide them with oll'-eampus living and safe­ty tips, the fair also morphed into an event for loeal vendors to advertise their products, Baron said. 
"This event came out of last year's fall Board of Trustees report on off-eampus safety," he said. 
The fair was not mandatory but was the only means for stu­dents living oil' eampus to pick up their football tickets. 
For senior Dan Tudesco, the lair and the tieket pick-up was not worth the 45 minutes he spent driving to the stadium and waiting in line. 
"I think this !the fair! just makes everything a lot more complicated," Tudesco said. "It's ridiculous. There are wity too many steps in the tieket pur­chase process." 
Seniors had to piek up their ticket applieations at the fair, wait in line later to receive their lottery numbers and then return Tuesday to purehase their tick­ets. 
In recent years students living off campus have voiced eon­cerns that it is not convenient to drive to campus multiple times in order to receive their tickel<>. 

But Baron believes the fair and the tieket proeess make it easier for students ofl' eampus to sign up for services they need. 
"We like to make it as eonven­ient as possible," Baron said. "It's a good idea to hold an information fair for students bncausn for many of them this is their first time living alone." 
For many students. the free samples were tasty perks. 
Senior Pnter Kralovee enjoyed a slice of Papa John's pizza while making his way to the Notre Dame food services table. 
"I eame to get football tiekets, a meal plan and pizza," Kralovec said. 
Safety was already an issue discussed in his house on Napoleon Street, Kralovee said. 

"Security and safety is a prior­
ity," Kralovec said. "Plus, this ·rair is an opportunity to have a mini-orientation and to rneon­neet with. who is and isn't living 
oll'eampus." 
At tho South Bnnd Police 
Department table, Oflieer Aaron 
Cassel chatted with Officer 
Patrick llnchlinski bnhind stac~ks 
of safety pamphlnts.

SMC tops ranking list again 
College named No. 1 in its category 
By JEN MALL 
News Writer 
Saint Mary's has been named the No. 1 Midwest comprehen-sive college for the 11th time in the past 12 years, according to the U.S. News and World Report's 2006 edition of "America's Best Colleges." 
In the rankings released this week, Saint Mary's reigned above the other 107 colleges in its category, including Calvin College and Marietta College, achieving a perfect score of 100. Saint Mary's ranked at the top in all categories, which included student selectivity, graduation rates, retention rates and commitment to instruction. 
Saint Mary's President Carol Ann Mooney said the ranking did not surprise her. 
"Saint Mary's educates women uncommonly well, and it's good to have our enduring quality reflected in these annual rankings," Mooney said in a press release. "But what the rank­ings don't show is that, after four years at Saint Mary's, our students become women who excel in business, the arts, medicine and academia. Our success as an institution can best be measured by our graduates who are powerful forces for good in their work­places, homes, communities, and parishes." 
Saint Mary's spokeswoman Melanie McDonald said that having a consistent No. 1 ranking associated with the institution is valuable. 
"Those who pay attention to the rankings know that the College has been No. 1 for a very long time, leaving with them an impression of endur­ing excellence," she said. "Our recognition as a first­rate institution comes from so much more than these rank­ings." 
Students also expressed excitement about the College's top ranking. 
"It's awesome that Saint Mary's is No. 1," said senior Stephanie Mason. "I definitely think this is an added bonus for me in the future as I pre­pare to enter the job market." 
The College's commitment to instruction is seen primari­ly in the small class sizes at Saint Mary's, Mooney said. 
"The rank reflects the qual­ity of student we enroll," Mooney said.

Student reports attetnpted burglary in dorm 
By LISA SCHULTZ 
News Writer 
An Alumni Hall resident reported an attempted bur­glary last week, Assistant Director of the Notre Dame Security/Police Phillip Johnson said. 
A man entered the men's dormitory and at approxi­mately 9:40a.m. Aug. 16 con­versed briefly with the stu­dent, who, while walking to a neighboring room, became worried that he did not lock his door, Johnson said. When he returned to his own room, the student discovered the man taking DVDs and putting them into a bag. 
Once the man was confront­ed, he fled without taking anything from the room. NDSP searched the area but did not find the suspect, Johnson said. 
Though the suspect was not found, Johnson said a crime was still prevented because the student followed his instincts, a response Johnson said is necessary to maintain a safe campus environ~ent. 
This type of crime -an 
unforced attempted burglary -is the most common on campus, Johnson said. Despite their frequency, such incidents are easily preventa­ble, he said. 
"We could virtually elimi­nate crime on campus if peo­ple [would] lock their· doors," Johnson said. "NDSP can't be in every dorm all the time." 
Johnson also recommended that students program NDSP's phone number into their cel­lular phones as a speed dial number to report suspicious activity on or around campus. 
Such an incident highlights the importance of people being responsible for others' safety when in a residence hall community, Johnson said. 
He also added that propping open doors and not locking dorm room doors are danger­ous to campus security. 
"You do [lock-your doors] everywhere else in the world, why not here?" Johnson said. "If people say NO is a safe campus, it is because people look out for each other."

Bush says mother's views misrepresent

President Bush will spend

Bush said Tuesday he understood the anguish of the California woman whose son was killed in Iraq last year and who has main­tained a stubborn vigil near his Texas ranch.

The shirt in emphasis came as thn White "House sought to deal with growing recognition of Sheehan as the face of a new anti-war movement. 
"I think those who advo­cate immediate withdrawal from not only Iraq but the Middle East are advocating a policy that would weaken the United States," Bush said.

Country condemns Robertson's assassination call 
Associated Press 
CAHACAS -Pat Hobertson's call for Amnriean agents to assassinate President Ilugo Chavez is a "terror­ist" staternont that needs to be investigated by U.S. authorities, Venezuola said Tuesday. The Bush administration quickly distanced itself from the religious broadcaster. 
Hobertson's suggestion Monday that the United States "take out" Chavez to stop Venezuela from becoming a "launching pad for com­munist inl"luence and Muslim extremism" appeared likely to aggravate tensions between the United States and the world's fifth­largest oil exporting eountry. 
Chavez, who was demoeratieally elected, has emerged as one of the 
most outspoken critics of President Bush, accusing the United States of eonspiring to topple his government and possibly backing plots to assas­sinate him. The United States is the top buyer of Vnnezuelan oil, but Chavez has made it clear he wants to decrease the country's depend­ence on the U.S. market by finding other buyers. 
Winding up a visit to Cuba, Chavez said in response to questions from reporters at Havana's airport that he did not have inl'ormation about Hobertson's comments. 
"I haven't read anything. We haven't heard anything about him," Chavez said. "I don't even know who that person is." 
But Viee President Jose Vicentn Rangel said the U.S. response to 
Robertson would bn a test of its anti-terrorist policy and that Venezuela was studying its legal options. 
"The ball is in the U.S. court, at't11r this criminal statomont by a eitizen of that country," Hangnl said. "It's a huge hypocrisy to maintain this dis­eourse against terrorism and at tho same time, in the heart or that country, there are ontirely torrorist statements like those." 
Hangel called Hobertson "a man who seems to have quito a bit or inlluence in that country," adding sarcastieally that his words were "very Christian." lie said the com­ments "reveal that religious funda­mentalism is one or the great prob­lems facing humanity in these times."

Terri Bays said. The 128 par­ticipants left for London Aug. 17. 
Bays did receive a number of phone calls from parents in the days after the attacks, but most were "overwhelmingly supportive" of the program continuing, Bays said. 
"We waited a few days [after the attack], and then we sent out a note via e-mail to the parents of the fall students reassuring them that we were continuing the program," Bays said. 'There would have to be some information that there was a significant growing dan­ger to the students such as the outbreak of war or specific terrorist attacks for the pro­gram to be canceled." 
Notre Dame students partici­pating in the summer engi­neering program were in London when the attacks occurred, but all were already in class the morning of July 7. 
Robert Dunn, director of the London engineering program, went to the classrooms to inform the students of the inci­dents. 
"We asked the students to stay in the Notre Dame build­ing until things quieted down," Dunn said. 
Many students intended to spend the three-day weekend traveling, but since the attacks took place on a Thursday, some students ran into difficul­closed down and all the cabs were really busy," Dunn said. 

The students responded "remarkably well" and kept in close contact with program directors for the duration of the summer, Dunn said. 
The city had largely returned to normal within a few da~, he said. · 
News of the attacks "deeply saddened" junior and fall pro­gram participant Meghan Wons, and it crossed her mind her semester abroad might be canceled. 
"Unfortunately, something like the July 7 attacks can hap­pen at any time and any­where," Wons said. "I didn't consider pulling out of the pro­gram but the July 7 attacks did make me warier of riding the Tube." 
Wons' mother Karen did consider asking her daughter not to go to London and has been watching the news very closely. 
"[Terrorism] certainly is a concern," Karen Woos said. "At the same time, I think it is just an incredible opportunity to do the study abroad experi­ence." 
Her elder daughter partici­pated in the London programs three years ago, and Karen Wons and her husband still plan on visiting their daughter for Thanksgiving. 
"I do have faith in the Notre Dame program that if they felt the situation was worsening ter Kathleen O'Brien is study­ing in London this semester, said while he was concerned about the attacks, he did not ask his daughter not to go. 
"We had some trepidation but we figured its part of life these days," O'Brien said. "The upside outweighs the risk." . 
Meghan Wons admitted that going to school in London after the July 7 attacks would be very different than living on campus in South Bend, and said she had received lots of advice from students who had gone in past semesters. 
"I think I will try to travel in groups and avoid taking the Tube as much as possible," Meghan Wons said. "I know a lot of my flatmates and friends here said that their parents did not want them taking the tube either, so we will all be doing a lot of walking togeth­er." 
Due to exterior threats, such as those from the Irish Republican Army, the under­graduate London program has had security measures in place since the late 1980s, Bays said. Guests are not allowed to stay overnight in Notre Dame hous­ing, and no one can enter the classroom building without an identification card. Students are also given a full security detail upon arriving in the city, Bays said.

Dish provider offers free service 
Associated Press 
DENVER -The nation's No. 2 satellite television provider wants to dish out free service to any town will­ing to rename itself "Dish." 
EchoStar Communications Corp., which operates the Dish Network, said Tuesday it will provide 10 years' worth of free satellite televi­sion service for every house­hold in a U.S. town that legally makes the change. 
The service will include a receiver, standard installa­tion and a programming 

package for every household. In exchange, the municipali­ty must change its name per­manently, including on build­ings and signs. 
The service would cost about $4 million for 1,000 households, the nation's No. 2 satellite television provider estimated. Interested cities have until Nov. 1 to submit a proposal. 
"It's an exciting concept and we hope it will become a buzz of any town," EchoStar spokesman Mark Cicero said. 
The promotion comes on the heels of EchoStar's 
newest advertising campaign and a contest that will allow the winner to name EchoStar's next satellite.

Along with establishing a par­ticular mindset, Jenkins has been developing specific goals for his term. Although he said his Sept. 23 inaugural address and Oct. 11 faculty address would further articulate his plans, he said his general thoughts on the future of the University under his leadership should not be terribly surpris­ing. 
"I don't think Notre Dame needs a radically new direc­tion," Jenkins said. "I think it needs an understanding it has a distinctive role to play in American education, and it's got to realize that and play it in the best possible way."

"We're the major university in this country that has a religious character that is among the top 20 universities or so," Jenkins said. "And we can take that on." 
For now, however, the new president often finds himself tied up in meetings, citing time management as his biggest challenge. 
"It's been very busy," Jenkins said. "With the start of the school year there's an enor­mous number of meetings to go to, groups to meet."

IN BRIEF 
Oil firm to acquire major producer 
BI~I.IINC-China's biggest state-owned oil firm has rnached an agreement to buy a major oil producer in nnighboring Kazakhstan for $4.2 billion -avictory in Beijing's campaign to secure foreign energy supplies for its booming economy. 
Tlw acquisition of PetroKazakhstan Inc., a Canada-based company, by a unit of China National Petroleum Corp., comes just three Wlleks after Hong Kong-based CNOOC Ltd. dropped its bid for Unocal Corp. following opposition from U.S. politicians. 
Thn deal. which still requires the approval of' PetroKazakhstan's shareholders, would be tlw biggnst acquisition ynt in a string of Chinnsn corporate takeovers overseas. 
CNPC International Ltd. agreed to pay $55 per share -a 21 percent premium over PntroKazakhstan's closing stock price on Friday. Shares of PetroKazakhstan climbed $X.35, or 1X percent, to close at $53.75 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. Tho stock's strongest level of the day was $54.52, well above its previous 52-week high of $46.92. 

Stocks fall as traders wait for data 
NEW YOHK -Stocks fell Tuesday as tradors waited for data on existing home sales and oil prices rose again. 
Wall Street has been closely watching homo sales, worried that the housing boom is nearing its end. The National Association of Hnaltors was expected to report later in the session that July existing home sales fell slightly compared to June. Jobs in the con­struction and at home improvement retailers would be affected by a contraction and con­surnnr spending could take a hit if home prices decline, since a raft of home equity loans have put cash in eonsumers' pockets. 
Traders also worried as oil prices rose slightly, feeding concern that higher gasoline pricos are eurbing consumer spending. On Saturday, Wai-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest retailers, said its third-quarter results would miss analysts' expectations duo to rising oil prices.

Government proposes new fuel standards 
Rules would coerce manufacturers to produce more vehicles with better gas rnileage 
Associated Press 
WASIIJN(;'J'ON -With gas priees continuing to rise, the Bush administra­tion on Tuesday proposed new rules to compel auto manufacturors to make pickup trucks, minivans and some sport utility vehicles morn fuel effi­eient. l~nvironmentalists said the plan would do lit­tle to wean the nation from its dnpendenco on foreign oil. 
The proposal would require the auto industry to raise standards for most vehicles other than ears beginning in 2008. All automakers would have to comply with the new system by 2011. 
"This is a plan that will save gas and result in less pain at tlw pump for motorists without saerifie­ing safety," Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta said. 

Mineta, speaking at news conferences in Atlanta and Los Angeles, said the program was expected to save about 10 billion gallons of gasoline over the life of vehicles built from 2008 through 2011.

Changing the tone 
After a series of focus groups held last spring, student gov­ernment officials found some orientation events to be so damaging to campus gender relations that it labeled them "juvenile and hypersexualized" in its April report to the University's Board of Trustees. 
Student body president Dave Baron, former president Adam Istvan and former vice presi­dent Karla Bell told the trustees that activities requiring male and female freshmen to pair off should be eliminated and replaced with events between many students of the same sex. 
"I received a lot of feedback [from the focus groups] that students felt uncomfortable with what they labeled as 'cou­pling' that happened during freshman orientation week­end," said student body vice president Lizzi Shappell. 
Over the summer, Baron said, Freshman Orientation commis­sioners worked with adminis­trators and members of student government to create activities promoting healthier gender relations, which some dorms implemented last weekend. 
In addition to increasing same-sex interhall events, some dorms incorporated icebreakers that paired freshmen by birth­days and hometowns to reduce awkwardness. Side activities, like inflatable games, were also set up to distract those who felt uncomfortable 1 with forced interaction. 
"At the end of my Frosh-0, I felt like I had met all the girls in the world. but didn't know any guys in my own dorm," said Jonathon Floyd, a sophomore Alumni Orientation Commissioner.

upon his freshmen that regard­

"It's possible that a guy has

Gaughan said. "It is most

when people are forced or pres­

·seeing through the gender lens' 
Notre Dame recognizes that 
setting a positive gender rela­
tions tone does not stop with 
Frosh-0, said Heather Rakoczy, 
director of the University's 
Gender Relations Center (GRC). 
Though a Women's Resource 
Center has been present on 
campus since 1993, the cre­
ation of the GRC was 
announced March 1, 2004. 
Founded to create a healthier 
climate for women and men at 
the University, the center is 
striving to take on a more 
active role in improving how 
gender functions at Notre 
Dame, Rakoczy said. 
"When a gender lens is miss­
ing from the conversation, gen­
der relations and gender issues begin collaborating with other University departments to pro­vide that gender lens. 
"If that happens, we might begin addressing how gender relations operates within [Freshman Orientation] and in so many other contexts on cam­pus wherein it may have gone unaddressed in explicit ways as well." 
Etheridge agreed Frosh-0 is not the only culprit for negative gender relations at Notre Dame. 
"I think it's funny to see kids packed into a dorm room with the lights off in a haze of alco­hol and then to hear them com­plain about how bad gender relations are," she said, adding students might form better relationships once the school year starts if they try to m·eet people through clubs and activ­ities instead. 
Still, student government offi­cials are confident the changes to Freshman Orientation will have a positive effect on overall gender relations at Notre Dame. 
"I cannot speak for the University as a whole, but I feel that setting the foundation for long-lasting healthy relation­ships between and within the genders is paramount during Frosh-0," Wishon said. 
Firth praised students for tak­ing on a leading role in bringing about this year's changes. 
"These were positive first steps and certainly steps for­ward," she said. "I think our goals are to welcome people; and to welcome them into a community that is comfortable with dialogue and welcomes all equally and has healthy atti­tudes about gender."

"I am looking forward to working with Dr. Burish," said Assistant Provost Joy Vann­llamilton. "In my brief interac­tions with him, I have found him easy to engage and to have a wonderful sense of humor, whieh is vital.

Gagnon said that though freshmen, graduate students, law students and MBA stu­dents are new to the system, they generally have the advantage of reading the information more closely and ehecking the Web site. 
"Freshmen  are  a  little  
more  obedient,"  Gagnon  
said.

thet·e were often incidents in which students wanting to sit together, in confusion, got lottery num­bers that were not in sequen­tial order. In such a circum­stance, Gagnon would aver­age their numbers, though he said sueh an exeoption did not happen Tuesday. 
Some students deeided to bypass the wait altogether. 
"Wo came late !two and a half hours af'ter the start time] because we figured there'd be long lines earlier." said senior Mariela Suarez. "It went pretty smoothly. The whole thing took about 10 minutes."

"Time strueture has worked to their advantage

"There  are  all  kinds  of

"Someone might say that a disadvantago would be the friends you have in May are not the friends you have in September, if you were to break up with your boyfriend over the summer or get a new roommate in the fall."

Tho county gflts a tangible benel'it from its investment, beyond the boost of having more people around to shop. Each child who enters a local school attracts $6,000 a year in statn aid. Tho 25 kids who have enrolled from the new families bring $150,000 annually to the education system, enough to pay for several teachers.

Apart from the Pizza llut and Dairy Queen, this one-stoplight town is untouched by the big shopping and restaurant chains.

On the other hand, Ellsworth otTers some brick streets, a cap­puccino bar in one of the antique stores, a nine-hole golf course, recreation center, a new medical center, a 24-hour gas station and convenience store, and an outdoor swimming pool with a slide.

Some scientists say younger fetuses show pain by moving away from a stimulus, but that lik~~ly is a reflex action and not an indication that they are actually feeling pain. said UCSF obstetric anesthe­siologist Dr. Mark Hoson, the study's senior author. 
Offering fetal pain relief in the lifth or sixth month, when brains are too immature to feel pain, is misguided and might result in unacceptable health risks to women, the authors said.

Associated Press 
CIIICAGO -Doctors should not be required to discuss fetal pain with women seek­ing abortions because fetuses likely can't feel pain until late in pregnancy, according to a review critics say hardly set­tles the contentious topic. 
Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco reviewed dozens of studies and medical reports and said the data indicate that fetuses likely are inca­pable of feeling pain until around the seventh month of pregnancy, when they are about 28 weeks old. 
Based on the evidence, dis­cussions of fetal pain for abortions performed before the end of' the second trimester should not be mandato­ry, according to

Hosen said thosn risks arn medically acceptable when the goal is to sav11 the fetus but there is not enough evi­dence to show any benp,fit from fetus-directed anesthe­sia during an abortion.

Proposed federal legislation would require doctors to pro­vide fetal pain information to women seeking abortions when fetuses are at least 20

TODAY'S STAFF 

So what exactly do libertarians believe? 
I've heard this question too many times. I'm going to ignore the inanity of it, in deference to.the truly curious, and attempt to answer it briefly because there is no other 
way -that is, short of writing several volumes of political philosophy, which is something I am not planning on doing. 
Maybe you have heard of libertarian­ism, or maybe you 


have not. It is a Scott Wagner political philosophy that is not new, and has its roots in the Live and Let earliest forms of Live or Die capitalism. The Libertarian Party was only founded with­in the last 35 years, but boasts more members elected to public office than any other third party. 
So ... what exactly do libertarians believe? 
The core principle of libertarianism is simple, and if one wishes to join the Libertarian Party one must sign a pledge to uphold it: the principle of non-aggres­sion. Therein lies the most striking differ­ence between libertarianism and the other political philosophies currently wrestling for power in the United States. 
Non-aggression simply states that your freedom to engage in violence ends where another human being begins, except in cases of self-defense, Thus, your inherent authority extends only to your own borders -the property you own, or your own body -and nowhere else. Authority is an artificial construct that is morally valid if and only if the con­sent of the subordinated is clearly estab­lished. This rule applies to all individuals, corporations and yes -even govern­ments. 
'-It is from this foundation that allliber­tarian positions derive. The government, at any level, is an exercise in authority that is not necessarily intrinsic to its exis­tence. As Murray Rothbard, one of the greatest political thinkers you've never heard of, said, "If you wish to know how libertarians regard the State and any of its acts, simply think of the State as a criminal band, and all of the libertarian attitudes will logically fall into place." 
Unlike Rothbard, however, most liber­tarians are not anarchists. Most are disil­lusioned Republicans or Democrats who have seen the national debt grow, who have watched civil liberties be curtailed, who have seen the machinery of state aggression, who have recognized that the root of oppression is the usurpation of authority and who have had enough. 
Libertarians reject authority that does not rest on the explicit consent of the governed. We believe that neither you nor any politician has a right to our money. We believe that no one has the right to interfere in our private lives, We believe that self-defense is inalienable but that all forms of aggression are immoral. We believe that drug laws, just like immigration laws, have been enacted to create criminals out of peaceful citi­zens. The government's role is not to enforce charity and morality, and we believe that the best way to a better soci­ety is not through more laws, but through fewer. As Tacitus once wrote, "The more corrupt the state, the more numerous the laws." It is true. 
Hence the difficulty in classifying liber­tarians on the left-/right-wing scale. Like the left, we believe that the state has no right to interfere in the personal lives of people. Like the right, we believe that the state has no right to steal from its citi­zens. Libertarians are thus both simulta­neously left and right, and most will say they are neither. 
The bumper sticker on the back of my car states it clearly enough: libertarians are "pro-choice on everything." 
Translated into a contemporary media buzzword, libertarianism is, basically, "tolerance." 
Unfortunately, the left has comman­deered the word "tolerance" and now throws it around carelessly. Tolerance is not about acceptance. It is, simply, toler­ance. You may not like my opinions. You may not like the Vagina Monologues; you may complain and whine and ignore all of these things, but you're going to toler­ate all of them because you have no right to do anything otherwise. You are not freer to decide what is best than anyone else is. 
That is libertarianism, It is based entirely on negative rights, in that people are free from coercion. In opposition are today's big-government socialists and neoconservatives who believe in positive rights: that is, you have the right to a government-funded retirement, the right to a pornography-free society, or any other "right to" that can be invented. Libertarianism is not about what you have a "right to." It is about what you have the right to be "free from." Fundamentally, you do not have the right to coerce anyone, just as you have the right to be free from coercion. 
If ye harm none, do as ye will. 
Hopefully this column will serve as a forum in which I can detail out some lib­ertarian solutions to government-created problems. If you find that the idea of fewer laws, smaller government and freedom of speech, religion and the press appeals to you, keep reading and investi­gate the matter further. It's going to be an interesting year.

Hypocrisy rampant in Gaza Strip policies 
Several wonks ago, Iraqi Prime Minster Ibrahim ai­Jaal'ari 1~alled li>r the United States to begin withdrawing Anwriean fim:e!> from Iraq by as early as 2006. President Bush eorrnetly delleetod the Prime Minister's statement by refusing to set a time table for the American disengage­ment from tim war-torn land as such an action would givn the terrorist<> a David clear eut date to plan an organized Day ollimsivn whnn American presence would be at its weakest. Other more extreme voiens in America and abroad Dartmouth havn ealled for the immndiate removal University of U.S. troops, using words such as The Dartmouth "oeeupiers," "crusaders," "infidels," ete. 
Hegardless of what one might think of thn masons (and mistakes) that brought our nation into Iraq, the fad of the matter is that at this juncture we are the righteous party in this eonflict. This is a much-over­looked fad. The terrorists are ruthless murderers who do not simply attack American and Iraqi military targets, but also haw targdnd crowded markets and shopping eentms without an "occupier" in the vicinity. 
President Bush stands firm with the understanding that Abu Musab ai-Zarqawi and a! Qaeda in Iraq cannot be allownd to dietate the tnrms of American withdrawal and risk the fledgling Iraqi govnrnment falling into their daws. An Amerkan rntnmt from tPrrorism half a world away would givn tlwir ideolO!,'}' a massivn jumpstart and would leave us vulnnrable to tnrrorism in our own backyard. 
Tho President's hard-linfl ideological stance against ter­ror is widely seen as eonsistent towards all terrorist organizations around the globe and is exemplified in his rnsolve to stay the course in Iraq. However, most have overlooked (or turned a blind eye to) the similarities between the American "Global War on Terror" and Israel's own struggle against terrorism. The President's hypothetical resolve to fight terrorism wherever it exists is lost in contradiction and hypocrisy when placed next to · his support of the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza in the wake of years of bombings and Intifada. 
The main issue that President Bush fails to address as he walks his diplomatic tightrope over Israel is that ter­rorist organizations exist in Gaza in an organized infra­structure integrated to a greater extent than the terrorists in Iraq, are maintained within the mainstream of Palestinian society and have legitimate political iri.fluence. Hamas enjoys enormous popularity in Gaza and is threat­ening to overthrow Palestinian Authority control in Gaza once the disengagement is over. 
Already, the organization's members have dashed with Palestinian police only a month ago, shooting a top Palestinian ollicial and overturning and burning Palestinian Authority police ears in Northern Gaza. Why? Because the Palestinian police stopped an attempt to lob Kassam rockets at Israeli settlements in the region. 
This tactic of intimidation could become extremely suc­cessful against Mahmoud Abbas' hold on power in the Gaza Strip as he has tried to corral and cajole I lamas without confronting or disarming it. 
A<> Mr. Abbas is showing weakness; Ham as is showing strength independent of the centralized PA government. Their leaders have been holding their own news confer­ences before the Israeli withdrawal, claiming victory in ending the occupation in Gaza and promising to continue the armed struggle against the Israelis. 
What is the l-lamas definition of this armed struggle against the Israelis? Unfortunately, the organization has historically attacked the vulnerable and innocent, murder­ing in cold blood without regard for human life. 
The worst and most frightening prospect is that Hamas is threatening to secure a victory to control Gaza legiti­mately through elections and illegitimatnly, if necessary, 
through intimidation and violence. 

With the settlements and military outposts rmnoved from Gaza and the possibility of a Gaza seaport, Gaza could be the major center of operation fi)r llamas and other terror organizations in all of thn Palnstinian territo­ries. 
Aller all, it appears that its brand of violence has caused the Israelis to give up a major bloc of territory worth its weight in gold, which the terrorists arn claiming as justili­cation for suidde bombings and their other methods of murder. 
The Iraq War's parallel to the Israeli Gaza withdrawal would be what President Bush has bonn preaching against all along: no withdrawal until the Iraqi government can control the terrorist situation. 
The Palnstinian government cannot yet hamlin il.., own extremists, and many terrorists are aetually in thn govern­ment itself. The Gaza Strip is being given to thn Palestinians as a prize for the Second Intifada lin· nothing in return, when it eould have benn used in futuro negotia­tions as a bargaining ehip for tho disarming of terror groups and the future security of Israel.

Summer movie roundup: A recap of the season' 
The summer is traditionally known as the blockbuster season for studios and audiences, as glossy special effects and movie stars drive box office receipts. The latest summer season. however. was alarmingly indistinct and lacking in many truly worthwhile films. Sequels and remakes seemed to be the trend, even for high-pro­111e directors like Tim Burton and Steven Spielberg and their equally big-name stars, Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise. 
Despite the potential of several summer films, most were disappointing, which was the general climate of the entire season. The relative failures ("Cinderella Man," whir.h fell short of recouping its more than $80 million budget) and smaller films ("Crash," written and directed by "Million Dollar Baby" scribe Paul Haggis) ended up being the best and most interesting in a summer largely devoid of origi­nality. 
Aside from these brighter blips, there were far more disasters than usual. Stars and directors alike stumbled. resulting in !11ms that were either wildly disappoint­ing ("Fantastic Four") or should never have been made in the first place ("Deucfl Bigalow: European Gigolo"). These films were over-saturated by their ad campaigns --money that would've been better spent ensuring the quality of the finished prod­uct. 
With a few exceptions, the best films of the summer seemed released in the wrong month, as they would've been better suited to Oscar season. This is a disappointing trend. as summer blockbusters have their own place and tend to be the most enjoy­able pictures of the year. That tradition was certainly was not the case this season. 

Batman Begins 
The gauntlet had been thrown down by Marvel Comics. Each of the last four sum­mers. the "X-Men" and "Spider-Man" sequels alternatively wowed critics and mass audiences, garnering high praise and even higher profits while raising the bar for intelligent, entertaining comic book films. This June, DC Comics finally awoke and struck back with "Batman Begins," dusting off a cobwebbed fran­chise and restoring it with vigor. 
Employing a similar recipe to the one used by Fox Studios and Sony Pictures for "X-Men" and "Spider-Man," respectively, Warner Bros. hired director Christopher Nolan ("Memento," "Insomnia") to reen­ergize a character that had fallen into despair under the campy fluorescent lights of "Batman Forever" and "Batman and Robin." Nolan, whose previous films had been low-budget independent films with a focus on strong characterization and a skillful directing style, focused the spotlight of "Batman Begins" firmly on Bruce Wayne, a tortured soul torn between revenge and justice. 
Unlike the previous films, where villains like Jack Nicholson's Joker frequently stole the show, Batman is no longer thrown to the wayside. The talented Christian Bale inhabits the dual role of Wayne and his alter ego, bringing a fierce intensity to the role that dismisses the previous interpretations of actors Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer and the clumsy George Clooney. Bale got so into the role that even the name on his trailer door was labeled "Bruce Wayne." 
Surrounding Bale is a veteran cast, studded with perennial Oscar-contenders Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman andLiam Neeson. The solid script and impressive cast helped the film paint an original, captivating story in a summer where originality was as hard to capture as Batman himself. 

Cinderella Man 
Ron Howard's "Cinderella Man" failed to become the blockbuster that the studio expected, though it's difficult to see why. Perhaps its summer release hindered its potential, as many audiences would reject a serious (albeit uplifting) film about a boxer in the midst of the Great Depression. Wariness over the real-life antics of star Russell Crowe may have also contributed to the film's failure to find a mass audience. But despite being a relative commercial failure, "Cinderella Man" wound up as one of the best films of the summer season. 
Good filmmakers know that the secret of boxing pictures is that they aren't real­ly about boxing at all. Instead, they focus on character, which helps underscore the brutal nature of the sport itself. In that regard, "Cinderella Man" is at once a biopic of real-life Heavyweight Champion James Braddock and a spot-on depiction of Depression difficulties. 
Great acting and directing carries "Cinderella Man." Russell Crowe is reli­able as ever, playing one of the genuinely nicest protagonists in recent memory. The rest of the cast is equally consistent, from Renee Zellweger's concerned wife to Paul Giamatti's fast-talking agent. The film is well-shot, especially in the boxing sequences, which are stylized and brutal, more "Raging Bull" than "Rocky." This allows the fights to carry a surprisingly efl'ective emotional weight. 
In his review of the film, critic Roger Ebert pointed out that "there's no great need for another [terrific boxing movie]." but he shouldn't complain. As long as they're being made, they should all be as terrific and inspiring as "Cinderella Man." 

Crash 
"Crash" is an intelligent, well-crafted film and a distinct departure from the recurring trend of sequels, remakes and fundamentally bad films that were released this summer. The movie deals with the difficult topic of race relations in Los Angeles, but writer/director Paul Haggis, who also wrote the critical favorite "Million Dollar Baby," creates multifaceted characters and intertwining stories that simultaneously evoke thought, anger and hope. 
While the topic of race is difficult to deal with, "Crash" portrays a wide range of racial issues both sensitively and criti­cally while still managing to be a highly entertaining film. The ensemble cast is brilliant, and includes a somewhat unusu­al group of actors, such as Sandra Bullock, Brendan Fraser, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Ryan Phillipe and rapper Ludacris. Some of the most notable per­formances include Sandra Bullock with her work as a depressed socialite, proving that she can do more than just romantic comedies, and Ludacris, playing a car­jacker who simultaneously complains about and embodies stereotypes about young black men, revealing that the rap­per just might have a future in acting. 
While each of the characters spends only a small percentage of the film on screen, "Crash" manages to give each of them depth and makes them seem like real people. While the film is alternately uncomfortable and inspiring to watch, it is one of the f!JW films in the last few years that offered such a genuinely inter­esting and insightful critique of human relationships.­
STORIES BY RAMA BRIAN DOXTADER A 

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory 
This summer seemed to be the season of remakes, few as high-profile as Tim Burton's second adaptation of Roald Dahl's "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory." 
Burton's direction and style are as evident as ever, resulting in a jagged look to Charlie's hometown and a Chocolate Factory that's more of a sensory overload than a confectioner's headquarters. To the filmmakers' credit, the movie looks and sounds very good, buoyed by the art direction and a truly bizarre musical score by Danny Elfman. 
However, there are two major problems with "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory." The first is the addition of a gratuitous backstory that de-emphasizes Charlie and concentrates instead on Willy Wonka and his candy­hating dentist father (though the casting of Christopher Lee in this role is a stroke of brilliance). 
The second is with Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka. Depp and Burton have teamed up before, often to glorious results ("Edward Scissorhands" and espe­cially "Ed Wood"). But in "Charlie," his bizarre manner­isms and child-like tendencies are far creepier and less effective than his performances in either of those other two films. For an actor of Depp's caliber, this is dis­heartening, though it does demonstrate just how good Gene Wilder's performance as Wonka was in the origi­nal. 

Comparisons to the pseudo-psychedelic 1971 original are inevitable, and while the 2005 version is far more stylized and visually arresting, it's not nearly as effec­tive as the original. What's strangest is that the title of this version is "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" while the original was entitled "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory." Yet the removal of the Everlasting Gobstopper subplot and addition of Wonka's backstory actually de-emphasizes Charlie and focuses on Wonka himself.

loys a revolving door for ung those genrns has been r-presnnt as summer itself. \tween Marvnl and DC, the 
giants, "Fantastic Four" 3ngins." 
tho directing and writing team would be wise to invest some heart into their lead characters, instead of string­ing audiences along from one mindless action sequence after another. 
War of the Worlds 
"War ol' the Worlds," whilo not an awful film, doesn't l'ullill the expnctations that most moviegoers had for the pairing of director Steven Spielberg and star Tom Cruise. 
Spielberg has directed two other hugely successful alien films, "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" and "E.T.," and Cruise has starred in a string of successful summer films, including "Mission: Impossible." The combination of Spielberg, Cruise and H.G. Wells' classic science fiction story led to huge expectations for the film, whieh it unfortunately failed to meet, despite mak­ing a large amount of money at the box offiee. 
The action in the !ilm is well directed and keeps view­ers' attnntion, but the lilm stumbles when it puts too much focus on Cruise, who plays a irresponsible, divorced father, and his children, particularly Dakota Fanning. Tim Hobbins does some great work in the film as a creepy survivalist, but none of the other actors put forth any notable performances. 
The end of the movie is incredibly disappointing and !'ails to match the suspenseful build-up. By that time, the audience has seen Tom Cruise narrowly escape death so many times that it simply stops being believ­able. 
The film is entertaining while it is being viewed, but looked at logically, the plot of the entire movie falls apart and becomes inereasingly unsatisfying. 
"War of the Worlds" is by no means an awfullilm, but considering the amount of talent and money that was poured into it, it fails to meet any of the expectations that were held out for it. 
TOTAL. GRoss 
Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo 
Some lilms are made to have sequels. such as "The Lord of tlw Hings," while others are bad but aren't awful, like "Miss Congeniality 2." Finally, thnre are the sequels that simply make you <Tinge, like "Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo." 
The original film, "Deueo Bigalow: Male Gigolo," was bad to say the least, but it had a few inappropriately funny moments that made it possible to sit through. The first film was really nothing more than a one-joke movie, and attempting to stn~tch the already weak eoneept to fill another movie makes the sequel dull and tedious to watch. The sequel's plot centers around Deuce's return to work as a malo prostitute while his fellow workers are being mysteriously murdered. 
All of the tasteless jokes that you would expect are included, and moving the action to Europe doesn't really change much except that stale jokns about differ­ent nationalities can be exchanged to lit the new continent. 
Hob Schneider and Eddie Griffin could potentially be funny as a tnam with the right material, but the thin premise of this movie gives them nothing substantial to work with. This lilm is truly a testa­ment to the lack of original ideas and taste in llollywood. 
Dukes of Hazzard 
Movies based on defunct television shows are rarely any good, but "The Dukes of Hazzard" manages to sink to a new low. This film is nothing more than a lame excuse to blow things up, have car chases and bring Jessica Simpson out in a bikini. 
While the television show was not any­thing dose to critically acclaimed, it was still popular and possessed some sort of charm and energy that made it a success­ful show with a devoted legion of fans. The film version merely appropriates the show's name and characters and repack­ages them for a younger generation, an odd strategy because it ignores the fans of' the show and aims for those who never watched the original. 
The casting is squarely aimed at attracting a younger audience, with Sean William Scott ("American Pie") and Johnny Knoxville ("Jackass") filling in as Bo and Luke Duke. Scott and Knoxville are normally entertaining regardless of how bad the film is, but even they get bogged down in the dull and meandering plot. Jessica Simpson relies entirely on her ability to wear a bikini, which is prob­ably for the best because her acting skills are nonexistent. She is completely ovnr­whelmed by what is going on· around lwr. 

The presence of notable casting choicns like Burt Heynolds. Willie Nelson and Linda Carter (TV's "Wonder Woman") isn't enough to savn this lilrn and it raisns q unstions as to why they are there in tlw lirst plaee. 
"The Dukes of llazzard" is simply had. boring and nearly unwatchable. 
Stealth 

There is an odd t n~ n d or r n cent. Academy Award winners going on to make subpar f'ilms, from DnnzPl Washington making "Man On Fin~" to llalle Berry making "Catwoman" to Gwynth Paltrow making "Shallow llal." Jamie Foxx joins that llall of Shame with his latest, "Stealth." 
What's sad is that Foxx's perf'ormanen isn't terrible at all, but it seems tnrribiP bncausn the dialogue and plot arn so poor·. "Stealth" might qualify as a popcorn pic­ture, except that a popcorn pieturn is designed to be enjoyable. The Iogie of the lilm is questionable at host and egregious at worst, and the pacing is much slowiH' than might be expected. The cast ranges in quality, from extrl'mely good (Sam Shepard, whoso echoes of "Tho Hight Stulr' is morn depressing than thrilling) to extn1mely poor (Jessica Biel, who is straddled with sueh bad dialogue that one is almost tempted to forgive her). There are actually a surprising amount of quali­ty actors on display here, which is ulti­mately a shame since they are stuck in a movie with such poor dialogue and plot­ting. 
The special effects and charisma of its lead star help carry "Stealth," but not by much. Director Hob Cohen, whose previ­ous credits include "The Fast and the Furious" and "XXX," is often regarded as a subpar popcorn moviemaker, but at least those films were enjoyable in a mindless sort of way. "Stealth" donsn't even grant that guilty pleasure. 
The Jilm didn't do well at the box ollien dospite a monstrous marknting campaign, which bodes well as it demonstrates that audiences expect a lot more than special eiTects and star power to carry a picture. It's something that Jamie Foxx oHght to remember as he chooses roles, especially since it served him so wnll in "Collateral" and "Hay."

CONCERT PREVIEW 
Anticipation builds for The Show 2005 
Rock quartet Cake and R&B artist Akon headline year's biggest concert 
By BOB COSTA 
Scene Wrirer 
Deciding which performers to bring to The Show, Notre Dame's largest on­campus concert, can be a daunting task. 
This year, numerous acts were con­sicered as possible performers, from jam-bands to rap impresarios. After much deliberation, The Show 2005 committee, which consists of 17 mem­bers of the student body, settled on a bill coupling Sacramento rock quartet Cake with the politically conscious crossover R&B artist Akon. Notre Dame student and freestyle artist Da Natural also will open and perform briefly between sets. 
The Show 2005, which is in its fourth year, is expected to draw about 4,000 students, event advisor Aaron Perri said.

both freshmen and the upper­classmen who in the past haven't always come to the event," said Anja Smitz, the student chairperson of The Show 2005 committee. 
Cake, which recently played at Lollapalooza 2005 and at a sold-out concert in Brazil, has been around the music world since the band debuted on college radio with its infectious single "Rock N' Roll Lifestyle" in 1995 off their album "Motorcade of Generosity." 
Cake went multi-platinum a few years later when its singles "Never There" and "The Distance," which is often played at major sporting events, hit the Top 40. 
"In terms of where American music, and especially radio is at the moment, music seems to only be popular if it is a bulbous, oversized, muscular, striving rock and roll," John McCrea, Cake's lead singer and guitarist, said. 
"For Cake, we are more about turning the volume down a bit, and not being entirely overt about emotion. Every song shouldn't be a soap opera, straight drama, or sadness, or humor," McCrea said. "Doing that is simplistic, and the songs become distillates of real life. Our music has humor and sadness existing side by side, sitting on a couch, drink­ing a beer with one another." 
McCrea and his bandmates released their most recent album "Pressure Chief' in September 2004, an amorous play of subtle melodies and multi-lay­ered songwriting that contrasted nicely with the previously wide-held percep­tion of Cake as a deadpan rock band that consistently delivered three-minute indie rock riffs on life and loathing. 
"Our paradigm is contradiction," McCrea said, "That is true rebellion. It is more rock and roll to not wear a leather jacket than to wear one." 
Akon, who hails from Senegal, is 
respected by both 
critics and fans as 
I'm Back" is being 
played often on rap radio, and Notre Dame students may remember him from his hilarious appearance on MTV's "Punk'd" -or could have seen him on MTV2, where he has become popular through heavy promotion of his hits "Bananza (Belly Dancer)" and "Lonely." 
Akon was recently nominated for an MTV2 Music Video Award at the 2005 VMAs -which will incidentally be held two days after The Show -and has become known for a signature style that combines his unique West African vocals with hip-hop rhythms that pon­der the ways of the street instead of indulging in male rap fantasies. 
For Da Natural, whose real name is Jeff Stephens, The Show 2005 will be a huge watermark in his burgeoning career. As emcee and performer, Da Natural, a junior, will deliver his already popular original tracks like "Dedication" and "I Have A Dream" in an arena setting for the first time. 
Past performers at The Show, which started as Flipstock in 2001, have included Jason Mraz, Guster, Black Eyed Peas, Better Than Ezra, George Clinton, and They Might Be Giants. 

The Joyce Center Fieldhouse doors open at 7 p.m. Friday and the concert begins at 8. The Show, which is open only to Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and Holy Cross students, is selling tickets for $10 at the LaFortune Box Office.

Perform.ing Arts Center strengthens sophom.ore schedule 
By LIZ BYRUM 
Assisranr Scene Edi ror 
More than 10,000 people walked through the doors of .the DeBartolo Center for the Performing Arts (DPAC) during its open house weekend last September. And while the DPAC is only in its second year, its inaugural success has raised hopes and expectations for the coming semester. 
"The Performing Arts Center is still defining what its greatest strengths are," said Laura Moran, director of marketing at the DPAC. 
Already some of those strengths are becoming clear, even as the venue is in transition. 
The top three focuses for entertain­ment shows continue to be classical, world and jazz performances. Notre Dame will also feature groups focused on modern dance, touring theatre, blue grass and popular music over the next few months. 
On Sept. 2, the season will open with a unique one-night performance by the Las Vegas act, Toxic Audio. They are currently performing a long-standing show at the Luxor Las Vegas Hotel and have been described as the "vocal equivalent of STOMP." As winner of New York's 2004 Drama Desk Award, Toxic Audio is beginning to reach the level of fame that Blue Man Group enjoyed five years ago. 
In the coming year, Notre Dame will welcome several of the great modern dance companies in the United States, including Merce Cunningham Dance Company. 
"Merce Cunningham Dance Company has performed to [musical composi­tions] scored specifically for them by Radiohead and John Cage," Moran said. 
Notre Dame also extends its Irish tra­dition to the performing arts again this year with a returning performance by The Chieftains next March and the leg­endary Irish musician Tommy Makem and his sons, the Makem Brothers, in late September. 
In the field of cinema, DPAC is "doing a great job at showing films that relate to who we are as a school and a com­munity," Moran said. 
This year, Browning Cinema will fea­ture several films making their pre­mieres in Northern Indiana, including "Murderball" on Sept. 2 and Sept. 3, as well as "Rize" and "Last Days" later in September. 
The PAC Classic 100 film series, a collection of films deemed essential and noteworthy over the course of the medium's existence, will also continue into the fall. 
The performing arts center has also made it a mission to help build strong connections between the university and the surrounding South Bend communi­ty. 
"Notre Dame is trying to partner with different organizations that will help us develop the relationship with the South Bend community," Moran said. 
University President Father John Jenkins has been instrumental to this cause through his personal involve­ment with the South Bend Symphony Orchestra, Moran said. The orchestra will be presenting the June H. Edwards Chamber Series within DPAC, with the hope that it will create more personal ties between the university and the surrounding areas, Moran said. 

Hoping to connect to the community 
outside Notre Dame, the DPAC has 
been undergoing changes to its physi­
cal location, including construction to 
the surrounding area and the newly 
constructed south entrance to Notre 
Dame Avenue. Moran believes that the 
new walking paths and a possible out­
door amphitheatre will serve as "a 
space students will enjoy spending time 
in and a great meeting place with peo­
ple in the community." 
Another welcomed improvement 
DPAC has made for this season is the 
addition of a brand new Web site and 
the ability to purchase tickets online 
for many of the upcoming shows. With 
the convenience of a click of a button 
and a short walk, there are more rea­
sons than ever for students to attend 
the performing arts center in its second 
season, Moran said. 
"We would like to get to the point 
where arts are an inescapable part of a 
Notre Dame student's experience at · school," she said.

Yankees and Indians stay tied in race for AL w-ild card 
Jacque Jones' homer ends no-hit bid and wins game for Minnesota 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK-Felix Escalona's bases-loaded single with two outs in the ninth inning gave the New York Yankees a 5-4 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays on Tuesday night and sole posses­sion of the AL wild-card lead. 
Hideki Matsui hit a tying homer in the ninth, and Derek Jeter had two hits in his return to the lineup for the Yankees (69-55), who scored in each of the final four innings to win for the ninth time in 12 games and reach 14 games over .500 for the first time this season. 
New York, which didn't lead until the final hit, had been tied for the wild-card lead with Oakland, which lost at Detroit. 
Vernon Wells had three hits, including a homer, as the Blue Jays wasted a strong start by Josh Towers and matched a sea­son high with their fifth straight loss. 
Toronto took a 4-3 lead off Mariano Rivera (6-3) in the ninth, but Matsui led off the bot­tom half with his 20th homer, a drive off Miguel Batista (5-5). .Jorge Posada walked with one out, and Robinson Cano walked with two outs. Batista then intentionally walked Jeter to load the bases for Escalona, who singled to center on an 0-2 pitch. 
After New York tied it in the eighth, Orlando Hudson singled off Rivera with one out in the ninth when Escalona came off first base to grab Jeter's throw. Hudson took second on an infield out and scored on Reed Johnson's single, beating Matsui's throw from left. 
AI Leiter allowed three runs and six hits with one walk and five strikeouts in seven-plus innings. The left-hander threw 121 pitches-50 more than Towers needed to get the same amount of outs. Towers gave up two runs and six hits. 
Leiter had retired eight in a row before Wells hit his 23rd homer with one out in the fourth. Gregg Zaun bounced an HBI single up the middle for a 2­0 lead later in the inning. 
Twins 1, White Sox 0 
MINNEAPOLIS -Jacque .Jones ended Freddy Garcia's no­hit bid with a home run to lead off the eighth inning, and Johan Santana and the Minnesota Twins beat the Chicago White Sox on Tuesday night. 
Santana (13-6) gave up three hits and walked one in eight innings, striking out seven to beat Garcia in a battle of per­haps Venezuela's two best pitch­ers. Santana, last year's AL Cy Young Award winner, improved to 6-1 after the All-Star break. 
Garcia (11-6) walked two and struck out three in eight innings. Jones' homer to right-center was his 18th of the season and the only hit Minnesota managed. 
The Twins moved within 9 1/2 games of first-place Chicago in the AL Central -with Cleveland in second, seven games out. Minnesota and Chicago play nine more times this season. 
Joe Nathan pitched the ninth for his 32nd save and extended his scoreless innings streak to 15. 
Santana and Garcia made this look like a pennant race classic, matching each other inning for inning. 
Pablo Ozuna stroked a single off Santana's first pitch and dou­bled down the left-field line in the third,·but that was it until Geoff Blum singled with two outs in the seventh. Ozuna followed with a drive to deep center, but Lew Ford -named the AL's Player of the Week the day before -caught it on the run before he crashed into the wall. 
Joe Mauer, who walked twice, was erased in the fourth when Justin Morneau hit a come­backer to the mound that Garcia quickly turned into a double play. To no avail, Twins manager Ron Gardenhire argued that shortstop Juan Uribe missed the base on the pivot. 
Michael Cuddyer reached sec­ond to start the sixth when Ozuna tried to backhand a grounder to third and let it roll under his glove. He moved to third on a groundout, but Garcia stranded him there _ finishing the inning when Jermaine Dye jumped to catch Nick Punto's fly­ball and hit his left arm hard against the right-field wall. 


Red Sox 5, Royals 2 
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -David Wells and the Boston Red Sox maintained their mastery of Kansas City with a victory Tuesday night, snapping the Royals' two-game winning streak that followed a team­record 19 straight losses. 
Edgar Renteria had three hits and Jason Varitek hit a towering home run for Boston, which handed the Royals their team­record ninth straight loss at home. 
Wells (10-6) allowed five hits in five shutout innings for his 11th straight win over the Royals, raising his lifetime record against Kansas City to 16-3. 

Jeremi Gonzalez pitched three hitless innings and Mike Timlin worked the ninth, giving up two runs on Donnie Murphy's single with the bases loaded. 
The Royals snapped the 19­game losing streak on Saturday night at Oakland and beat the Athletics again on Sunday. 
Wells worked out of jams in the first and second and issued two walks for only the third time this season. The left-hander has not lost to Kansas City since May 5, 1993, while with Detroit. 
Zack Greinke (3-15) became the first major league pitcher with 15 losses as the Red Sox beat the Royals for the fourth time in as many games this sea­son. Since 2001, the Red Sox are 20-8 against Kansas City and have guaranteed themselves of winning the season series for the fifth straight year. 
Greinke, in his first appear­ance against the Red Sox, gave up five runs and nine hits, with two walks and three strikeouts. His ERA climbed to 6.04. 
Renteria had an RBI single in a three-run third. After Bill Mueller doubled and scored on a two-out double by Johnny Damon, Renteria's first hit scored Damon to make it 2-0. Then David Ortiz doubled for a 3-0 lead. 

Cubs 10, Braves 1 
CHICAGO -Jerome Williams took a no-hit bid into the fifth inning and had the first multihit game of his career, and .Jeromy Burnitz backed him with a grand slam to lead the Chicago Cubs over the Atlanta Braves Monday night. 
Williams (4-6) allowed one run and three hits in 7 2-3 innings, his longest outing this season. After walking Rafael Furcal leading ofT the game, he retired 11 in a row before Andruw Jones led off the firth with his 40th homer. 
At the plate, Williams was 2­for-4 with a single, double and a run. 
Burnitz, in an 15-for-71 slide coming in, hit his eighth career slam, his first since May 2003, for an 8-0 lead in the fourth against reliever Joey Devine. Burnitz has 19 homers this sea­son. 
Braves starter John Thomson (3-4) lasted just 3 2-3 innings for his second straight start, allow­ing five runs and seven hits. He gave up seven runs and eight hits in a loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers on Thursday. 

Williams, 1-for-17 this year coming in, hit a leadoff double in the third. Todd Walker hit an RBI grounder, Burnitz walked with the bases loaded and Neiii Perez blooped a two-run single to center. 
After going 0-3 in his previous four starts, Williams threw 112 pitches_ 68 for strikes. He left to a loud ovation after allowing a single by Johnny Estrada and walking Peter Orr. Heliever Roberto Novoa retired Marcus Giles on a groundout to end the eighth. 
Michael Barrett hit a two-run double in the bottom half for the Cubs. 


Pirates 10, Cardinals 0 
PITTSBUHGH -Unbeaten rookie Zach Duke pitched two shutout innings before leaving with a sprained left ankle and the Pittsburgh Pirates got big nights from three other first­year players to beat St. Louis on Tuesday night. 
Nate McLouth, one of four rookies in Pittsburgh's increas­ingly young lineup, hit his first career homer -a two-run drive off the slumping Jason Marquis -and Ty Wigginton had a three-run triple in his first Pirates' at-bat in 2 1/2 months. Chris Duffy and Hyan Doumit, the other two rookies, each reached base three times and scored a combined five runs. 

Pirates second baseman Jose Castillo was lost for the rest of the season Monday when he sprained a ligament in his ldt knee turning a double play. 
While the Pirates finally did something right against the divi­sion-leading Cardinals, who had won 15 of I 7 against them, Duke's injury was a disconcert­ing note on an otherwise prom­ising night for a team headed for its 13th consecu~ive losing sea­son. 
With the Pirates up 4-0, Duke (6-0, 1.81 EHA) singled to start the second inning for his second career hit and advanced on Duffy's single. But Duke was trapped off second on McLouth's line drive that shortstop David Eckstein intentionally dropped and, trying to decide whether to head for third or go back to sec­ond, was tagged out scrambling back to the bag.

ATLANTA -The Atlanta Thrashers traded former NIIL rookie of the year Dany Heatley· to the Ottawa Senators for Marian Ilossa on Tuesday, a blockbuster deal requested by lloatley loss than two years after he was blamed for a wreck that killed a teammate. 
The teams swapped high-scoring right wingors on the same day Hossa agreed to a thrllo-year, $18 million contract with the Senators, avoiding salary arbitration. 
The 24-year-old Heatley combined with llya Kovalchuk to give the Thrashers two of the NHCs most prized young players. Bossa led the Senators with 36 goals and 46 assists in 2003-04, the last season before the lockout. 
The Thrashers also received defenseman Greg de Vries.

Gates inks contract with San 
Diego 

SAN DIEGO -The Antonio Gatos saga took another surprising turn Tuesday when the All-Pro tight end agreed to a six-year eontraet with the San Diego Chargers. 
Despite getting the long-term deal he wanted. Gates still has to sit out the final two exhibition games and the season-opener against Dallas on Sept. 
11. his punishment f'or missing a team-imposed deadline for reporting to training camp. 
Financial details weren't immedi­ately available, but it appeared that Gatos' side had to mako concessions. Gates wanted to be paid among the top tight ends in the league and was seeking a deal worth between $4 mil­lion and $5 million a season. 
At one point, his agent reportedly was seeking a three-year deal, which would have allowed him to become an unrestricted free agent quicker. The Chargers balked at giving him the chance to do so. 
Heatley went to thn Thrashers a couple of weeks ago and requested tho trade. 
"Over the course of time, we experienced some unfortunate incidents and encountered some chal­lenging issues," his agent, Stacey McAlpine. said in a telephone interview from Calgary. "I think it was a combination of several things that slowly. over time, led us to the decision that it might be in every­body's best interests to work together to try to lind a new opportunity. a new homo, a new place to play." 
Thrashers general man­
ager Don Waddell said lw could undnrstand lleatley's desire to play in anothnr city. 
"Tlw emotions that went with the accident ... driv­ing by the place wlwre the accidnnt happened and being rernindnd of it," Waddell said. "Obviously we have 37. Dan Snyc!Pr's number, in our building. All of that led to Dany believing hn needed a fresh start."

SAN FHANCISCO -Alex Smith will begin his first NFL season on the San Francisco bench. 
After struggling in both of his pre­season starts, Smith was told Tuesday by coach Mike Nolan that Tim Rattay will open the season at quarterback against St. Louis. 
"I know how this works," said Smith, the top overall pick in this year's draft. 
"This is a team game. This isn't all about me. 
"I think the team wants to win now. Wn expect to win now, and as of right now, this looks like tho right decision. 
"Hopefully, I keep getting better and keep pushing it. Who knows what happens in the future, but right now. I understand it." 
While Smith looked befuddled in going 5-for-16 for 43 yards without a touchdown pass in the first two games, Hattay was 13-of-19 for 194 yards and three TDs.

Holtz and Bradshaw­headline Harris voters 
Former Irish coach among 114 members of BCS ranking poll 
Associated Press 
Terry Bradshaw, Lou lloltz, Stove Largent and Anthony Munoz are among the 114 pan­elists voting in a new poll the Bowl Championship Series will use this season to determine which teams play in college foot­ball's four major bowls, includ­ing the national title game. 
The Harris Interactive College Football Poll panel is comprised of former college football play­ers, coaches and administrators, plus some media members. The names of its voters were released Monday. 
"Harris Interactive has been diligent in creating a voting panel that is balanced, statisti­cally valid, and representative of all 1-A conferences and inde­pendents," BCS coordinator and Big 12 Conferenee eommissioner Kevin Weiberg said in a state­ment. 
Tho Harris Poll replaces The Associated Press Top 25 media poll as one of three components in the BCS standings. The USA Today eoaehes' poll and a com­pilation of six computer rank­ings make up the other two­thirds of a team's BCS grade. 
The AP poll had been used by the BCS since its inception in 1998, but after last season the AP asked BCS offieials to stop using its rankings in their for­mula. 
ESPN pulled its afliliation to the eoaehes poll after last sea­son. 
The Harris panel has numer­ous big names on it, inducting NFL Hall of Famers Bradshaw, Largent and Munoz. 
Bradshaw played at Louisiana Tech. Munoz was an All­American tackle at USC. Largent played for Tulsa. 
lloltz retired from coaching last season, leaving South Carolina. He also made success­ful stops at Arkansas, Minnesota and Notre Dame. 
Among the other former play­ers voting in the Harris Poll are Hocket Ismail, Boomer Esiason, Don Maynard, Lee Hoy Selmon and Craig Morton. 
Spike Dykes, Gerry DiNardo and Foge Fazio are among the former eoaches taking part in the poll. 
Former Southeastern Conference commissioner Hoy Kramer, whose effort was piv­otal in forming the BCS, will also be a Harris poll voter. 
The 114-member panel was selected by Harris Interactive Inc., a marketing firm hired by the BCS, out of a group of more than 300 nominations supplied by the Division 1-A eonferences and Notre Dame. 
The voters were ehosen to give equal representation to all 11 conferences. 
The first Harris poll will be released Sept. 25, four weeks into the college football regular season. Barris poll voters will not be required to make their ballots public until the final poll Dec. 5. 
Voters in the coaches' poll agreed for the first time to release their final ballots this season.

Three vvalk-ons earn scholarships 
By MIKE GILLOON Sports Editor 
Senior cornerback Brandon Harris, senior wide receiver Hob Woods and junior defensive lineman Casey Cullen have been awarded scholarships for this school year, Irish coach Charlie Weis announced Monday. 
Weis rewarded the trio ­who all came to Notre Dame as walk-ons -for representing "everything Notre Dame stands for on and ofJthe field." 
"I went and researched grade point average, looked at char­acter, saw if they were ever in any trouble with the University," Weis said. "What I didn't want to do was give away a $40,000 or $50,000 scholar­ship to someone who has been in a bunch of trouble." 
Weis was impressed by their effort, noting that they are all strong students. Woods holds a 3.95 GPA in Ae rosp ace/Mechanical Engineering and played in three games last year. 
"He might not be the greatest athlete in this world," Weis said of Woods. "But you get a bunch of guys on your team with that type of heart and intelligence and work ethic that play them­selves into the mix because they're overachievers, not underachievers -that's the type of guy you want on your team." 
Weis also raved about Harris, who came to Notn~ Dame on a partial music scholarship and participates in the Notre Dame Symphony Orchestra. 
"I told [Harris] he can take that partial music scholarship and throw that baby away because I'm picking up the tab this year," Weis said. "I thought he would be the right type of guy, the Notre Dame type of guy that earns his way to a scholar­ship." 
Cullen has never played in a game going into his third year on the team. However, Weis noted his desire and work ethic has helped him become a 'core' player on the Irish special teams. 
"U-Ie's a] guy that day-in and day-out has been impossible for anyone to block or to stop," Weis said.

Huggins given 24 hours to quit

CINCINNATI -Bob Huggins was ordered Tuesday to resign as Cincinnati's basketball coach or he'll be tired, the culmination of a power struggle with the school president.

by the university, Huggins was given 24 hours to resign and accept a financial compensation package worth almost $3 mil­lion. If he doesn't respond by 2 
p.m. Wednesday, he will be flred, the letter said. 
The 51-year-old coach was traveling and had not seen the letter, lawyer Richard Katz said. 
Athletic director Bob Goin, one of Huggins' most loyal sup­porters over the years, said he backed the decision. 
"It's time for the university to move on," Goin said. "We've reached an impasse." 
Huggins has won more games than any other coach at Cincinnati, but his tenure also has been marked by player arrests, poor graduation rates and NCAA rules violations that landed the school on probation. 
His arrest for drunken driving last year upset new sehool pres­ident Naney Zimpher. Huggins was plaeed on unpaid leave over the summer, but returned and coached last season.

Seminoles axed from NCAA banned list 
FS U wins its appeal to new guidelines on Indian nicknames 
Associated Press 
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -The NCAA will allow Florida State to use its Seminoles nickname in postseason play, removing the school from a list of col­leges with American Indian nicknames that were restrict­ed by an NCAA decision earlier this month. 
The NCAA said it was recog­nizing the relationship Florida State has lorig enjoyed with the Seminole Tribe of Florida, which assists the university with its pageantry and cele­bration of its culture and sup­ports the school's usc of its name. 
"The staff review committee noted the unique relationship between the university and the Seminole Trib~;J of 
alumni and friends of the NCAA decision. 
"I don't think anything has brought them together quite as much as this," said Wetherell. "Whether you're a Gator, Hurricane or Bulldog, those entities believe it's a Florida decision." 
Gov. Jeb Bush also applaud­ed the NCAA's reversal. 
"When you make a mistake it's important to realize it and move on," Bush said. "They came to the right conclusion ... the Seminole mascot and the tradition at Florida State is not offensive to anyone." 
The NCAA said it would han­dle reviews from other schools on a case-by-case basis. The Illinois Fighting Illini, Utah Utes and North Dakota Fighting Sioux are among other prominent school nick­names that remain affected by the edict. 
Utah athletic director Chris Hill said the school is expect­ing a similar rul­

regarding when and how its name and imagery can be used, must be respected even when others may not agree." 
Florida State president T.K. Wetherell had threatened to sue the NCAA immediately after its Aug. 5 announcement that the school's highly visible nickname, "Seminoles," was defined as "hostile and abu­sive" by a committee. 
"The two things we request­ed in our appeal were grant­ed," Wetherell said. ''I'm ready to play football, start school and have classes begin and all that kind of stuff." 
Lee Hinkle, vice president for university relations, said the school e-mailed 250,000 to do everything 
thorough," Hill said. "We felt all along that we would get a favorable ruling." 
Under the NCAA restrictions, teams with American Indian nicknames would not be able to display them on uniforms or have their mascots perform in postseason tournaments. 
"The NCAA remains commit­ted to ensuring an atmosphere of respect and sensitivity for all who participate in and attend our championships," Franklin said in the statement. 
Wetherell said he has had some contact with the other schools. 
"I think they [NCAA] under­stand, there will be other requests," Wetherell said.

French paper accuses Armstong of using EPO 
American cyclist vehemently denies report, calling it a 'witch hunt' 
Associated Press 
1'/\HIS -Faced with ynt anotlwr rnport that ho dwatnd his way to a Tour de France victory, Lance Armstrong rnspondnd Tuesday tlw same way lw has since the doping whispers bngan during the lirst of his snvnn straight wins: 'T nPvnr took pnrl'ormance Pnhaneing drugs." 
In a four-page article head­linnd "Thn Armstrong I.in," the French sports daily L'Equipe printed copies of documents suggesting six urinn samples lw providnd during his first championship in l 999 tested positivn for the red blood cell­booster erythropoiotin, or EPO. 
The drug was on tho list of' banned substances at the timo hut thorn was no effective test to detect it. 
Tour de France director 
Jean-Marie Leblanc said the report published Tuesday appPared "credible" and metic­ulously researched, adding that Armstrong must have a chance to rebut the claims. 
"We are very shocked, very troubled by the revelations we read this morning," Leblanc told HTL radio. 
Armstrong, a frequent target of' L'Equipe, vehemently denied the allngations. 
"Unfortunately, the witch hunt continuos and tomorrow's article is nothing short of' tabloid journalism," Armstrong wrote on his Web site. "I will simply restate what I have said many times: I have never taken performance-enhancing drugs." 
The allegations surfaced seven years later because EPO tests on the 1999 samples were carried out only last year when

scientists at a lab outside Paris used them for research to per-. feet EPO testing. The national anti-doping laboratory in Chatenay-Malabry said it promised to hand its linding to the World 1\nti-Doping 1\gency, provided they were nover used to penalize riders. 
L'Equipe's investigation was based on urine B samples ­the second of two samples used in doping tests. The A batch was used in 1999 for analysis at the time. Without those sam­ples, any disciplinary action against Armstrong would be impossible, French Sports Minister Jean-Francois Lamour said. 
The governing body of world cycling did not begin using a urine test for EPO until 2001, though it was banned in 1990. For years, it had been impossi­ble to detect the drug, which builds endurance by boosting the production of oxygen-rich red blood cells. 
Jacques de Ceaurriz, the head of France's anti-doping laboratory, which developed the EPO urine test, told Europe-1 radio that at least 15 urine samples from the 1999 Tour had tested positive for EPO. 
Separately, the lab said it could not confirm that the pos­itive results were Armstrong's. It noted that the samples were anonymous, bearing only a six­digit number to identify the rider, and could not be matched with the name of any one cyclist. 
However, L'Equipe said it was able to make the match. 
on· one side of the page, it showed what it claimed were the results of EPO tests from anonymous riders used for lab research. On the other, it showed Armstrong's medical certificates, signed by doctors and riders after doping tests ­and bearing the same identify­ing number printed on the results. 
"lt will be very interesting to see what UCI does and what the U.S. Cycling Federation does and what Lance Armstrong has to say," WADA chairman Dick Pound said. "If' the evidence is seen as credible then, yes, he has an obligation to come forward and specifi­cally give his comments, espe­cially after his previous com­ments that he has never used drugs. 
"If anything were found, Wfl couldn't do anything because we didn't even exist in 1999. But it's important that the truth must always be made clear," Pound added. 
Representatives for Armstrong said he was in Austin, Texas, where he lives and did not wish to comment beyond the statement on his Web site. 
A year before Armstrong won his first Tour title, the race faced its worst doping scandal after police caught a Festina team employee with a stash of drugs. Hiders were ejeeted and others quit, almost foreing the Tour to collapse. 
Armstrong ha·s been dogged by questions in the French media about how somnone whose testicular cancer had spread to his lungs and brain could rise to the top of one of the most grueling sporting events in the world. 
Armstrong angrily appeared at a news conference ·that year to explain that trace amounts of cortisone found in his sys­tem were from a prescription skin cream to treat saddle sores. 



The following year, /\rmstrong and his U.S. Postal Service team became the sub­ject of a French investigation into whether tlwy used banned substances during the 2000 race. The probe was closed in 2002 for laek of evidence. 
L'Equipn, whose parent com­pany is elosely linked to the Tour, often questioned Armstrong's clean record and frequently took jabs at him ­portraying him as to.o arro­gant, too corporate and too good to be for real. 
"Never to such an extent, probably, has the depart~Jre of a champion been welcomed with sueh widespread relief'," the paper gripnd the day al'ter Armstrong's rncord sevnnth straight win. 
;\ f'ormnr L'Equipe journalist, Pierre Ballester, was co-author of' a book published last year that contained doping allega­tions against Armstrong. lie wrote "L./\. Confidential, thn Secrets of' Lance Armstrong" with Tlw Sunday Times sports­writer David Walsh. 
In tho book, one of Armstrong's former assistants eIa i m 11(1 t h at t h n A m e r ic. a n onen asked lwr to dispose of \!sed syringes and givn him m a kn u p to eo n eo a I IHHHI I n marks on his arms. 
Armstrong has taknn lilwl action against The Sunday Times after the British news­paper reprinted allegations in a revinw of tho book in .Juno 2004. Tho ease is to go to trial in London's lligh Court in Nov1Hnber. 
Vietor llugo l'ena, Armstrong's former U.S. Postal Serviee teammate, said the French wore bad losers who could rHWIH aeeept his supremaey on the Tour.

NO ATHLETICS 

~Gug' gives Notre D'ame new look 
Irish sports facility brings fresh luxuries to football team, coaching staff 
By PAT LEONARD Sports Writer 
It's pronounced "Goog," it's spelled "Gug" and it's short for the largest upgrade of ath­letic facilities at Notre Dame in years. 
The Don F. and Flora Guglielmino Athletics Complex, a $21.25 million project, is receiving its finish­ing touches as the 2005 foot­ball season approaches. The football team recently moved in to the new 95,840-square­foot facility that features state-of-the-art locker rooms, training equipment, greeting and meeting rooms and coaches' offices. 
And head coach Charlie Weis already feels at home. 
"Absolutely,"· Weis said after Tuesday's practice. "Ride by. I'll wave to you from my patio." 
Weis' second-floor office opens onto .a balcony that overlooks Cartier Field, where the team practices. Add that to the long list of amenities and upgrades that are making the "Gug" the talk of all Notre Dame sports, not just football. 
"You could see how moving into a facility like this ... is a really big plus for the University of Notre Dame," Weis said on the team's media day Aug. 8. "It's a big plus for the whole athletic depart­ment." 
Located behind the Rolfs Sports Recreation Center and connected in the back to the Loftus Sports Center, the Guglielmino Complex will serve as the new official loca­tion of the football offices ­moving to the east of campus from their previous location in the Joyce Center.

Aggressive play benefits Irish 
Notre Dame ties New Mexico 1-1 after a challenging first half 
By KEVIN BRENNAN 
Sports Writer 
What a difference a half makes. 
In the opening exhibition game of the year, the Notre Dame men's soccer team fell behind 1-0 in a first half controlled by visiting New Mexico on Monday. The second half, however, proved to be quite a different story. 
The Irish came out of the break much more aggressively and confi­dently and stole the momentum from the Lobos. Notre Dame tied the score in the 56th minute of play on a goal from junior defender Ryan Miller. The two teams fought to a standstill for thP rest of regula­tion and two overtime periods, and the game ended in a 1-1 tie. 
Coach Bobby Oark was pleased with his team's play. 


"They all played a phenomenal 19:33 left to play in the first half, second half," Clark said. "We New Mexico's speedy striker looked as well as any team can." Brandon Moss got behind the Irish

ND WOMEN'S SOCCER 
Bock aids Irish for two vvins 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Writer 
New season, same result<>. 

That's been the story of the top­ranked and defending national champion Notre Dame women's soccer team in the last 10 days, as freshmen Brittany Bock and Kerri Hanks and senior Katie Thorlakson propelled the Irish to two wins in exhibition matchups. 
Though Hanks said the team was a little out of sync, the Irish toppPd Butler and Virginia in the team's two pre-season games. 
"It all came down team effort," she said. "And the coaches pre­pamd us very well." 
Notre Dame 8, Butler 1 

In the first contest, Notre Dame routed the Bulldogs in Indianapolis, 8-1, scoring eight goals on 26 shots. Bock made a tremendous first impression, scoring two goals and adding an assist. 
Senior forward Katie Thorlakson started the Irish on the right foot, netting her goal just 90 seconds after kickoff. Junior defender Kim Lorenzen

Jones, Webb top list of· ND recruits 
Weis, Irish ink six star players over the summer season 
By MIKE GILLOON Sports Editor 

This summer was a busy one for Charlie Weis and his Notre Dame coaching staff as six recruits gave their verbal com­mitment to the Irish, upping the total number of recruits who intend to sign with Notre Dame this year to 12. 
The six verbal commitments received since May 27 are cor­nerback Raeshon McNeil, offen­sive lineman Bartley Webb, running back Luke Schmidt, wide receiver Rob Parris, defen­sive end John Ryan and quar­terback Demetrius Jones. 
Hecruits are not allowed to sign their official letters of intent until February. McNeil is the most recent verbal commit­ment, having made his announcement on Aug. 15. He and Webb are two of the more important commitments given the lack of depth on the team in the defensive secondary and offensive line. 
McNeil is the first secondary commitment in this class, and is believed by many experts to be the most promising Irish cor­nerback prospect in the past 10 years. 
"Lately Notre D'ame had seemed to miss out on their very top cornerback prospects," said Mike Frank of Irisheyes.com. "But they got [McNeil] and will probably try to sign at least two and probably
