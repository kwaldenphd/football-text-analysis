Hesburgh looks back on 34 years 
Five still in running for ND_ president 
Ass~ated Press 
Each of five potential succes­sors to Notre Dame President Fa­ther Theodore Hesburgh remains in the running during the final month of the presiden­tial search, trustee Andrew McKenna says. 
Hesburgh, 69, has announced he plans to retire at the close of the current academic year after 35 years as president. 
Notre Dame's 16th president will likely be chosen from among five candidates promoted to key posts by Hesburgh after he agreed in 198:.: to serve five years beyond his original retire­ment date. 
"The search process Is very genuine and all these players are in the game," McKenna said In the autumn issoe of Notre Dame Magazine made available Thursday. 
Although control of the univer­sity passed to a lay board from the Holy Cross priests In 1967, the school's bylaws still require the president be a member of the Holy Cross order. 
The search committee will select a candidate and present his name at a scheduled Nov. 14 meeting of the full board of trus­tees. "Only the trustees have the vote, so I cannot be certain that the election will take place that day," McKenna said. 
University officials say board approval is almost a certainty. 
Donald Keough, chief execu­tive officer for Coca-Cola Co. Inc. and chairman of the Notre Dame trustees, said the candidates are a "remarkable group of qualified members of the Congregation of Holy Cross." 
Notre Dame Magazine identi­fied the candidates as: Ernest Bartell, director of the Helen Kel­logg Institute for International Studies; William Beauchamp, ex-

In the waiting room of his of­flee hang photos of him shaking hands with popes and presi­dents. Across the room is a cabinet, its shelves lined with awards. 
Inside the office, University President Father Theodore Hes­burgh settles back in his chair, surrounded by relics he's col­lected from some of the approx­imately 130 countries he's visited. 
In 1982 Hesburgh announced he would retire after five more years, making May 17, 1987, the final day of the longest presidency in Notre Dame's his­tory. 
No real disappointments 
Looking back over his 34 years as president, Hesburgh says he hasn't any "perceptible disap­pointments here." 
"One always figures that one might have done better or do better given different circum­stances," says Hesburgh, now 
69. "But by and large I'm rather happy about what's happened." 
What's happened In those 34 years Is that Notre Dame's en­dowment has skyrocketed from $9 million to more than $350 million; its annual operating budget from $9.7 million to $176.6 million; and its research funding from $735,000 to $15 million. 
Enrollment has risen from 4, 979 to 9, 600, faculty from 389 to 950 and degrees awarded from 1,212 to 2,500. 
"With the help of a lot of very dedicated and talented people, I think we've emerged as one of the really great Catholic univer­sities of the world," says Hes­burgh, whose tenure is the longest among active presidents of American universities. 
"I think the place gets better every year," he adds. "One way to look at It would be physically.

Institute for Peace Studies to focus on education 
By ROB HENNIG Senior Staff Reporter 
Foreign fellowships and un­
dergraduate courses will be the 
focus of the recently established 
University of Notre Dame In­
stitute for International Peace 
Studies according to an advisory 
council which met yesterday at 
the Center for Continuing Edu­
cation. 
Yesterday's meeting of the ad­
visory council presented and dis­
cussed the specific programs the 
Peace Institute Intends to ad­
vance, according to Michael 
Gray, assistant director of public 
Information. 
The council heard presenta­
tions from George Lopez, asso­
ciate professor of government 
and International studies on the 
proposed undergraduate pro­
grams; the Honorable John Gil­
ligan, Institute director, on the 
Faculty Peace Studies Forum; 
and Robert Johansen, professor 
of government and International 
studies and senior fellow of the 
Institute, on the graduate pro­
grams and Visiting Fellows. 
Advisory Council members 
emphasized the Importance of 
the foreign fellowships. Univer­
sity President Father Theodore 
Hesburgh proposed that three 
students from the Soviet Union, 
People's Republic of China, the 
United States, Western Europe 
and Japaq come to Notre Dame 
for a year program. The purpose 
Is to "put them together and see 
If they could come up with a 
document," said Hesburgh. 
"If this group can't get along, 
there's no hope for the world," 
Hesburgh added. 
"I think that having Chinese 
and Soviet students here Is the 
key to making It (the Peace In­
stitute) unique," said Dr. James 
Muller, co-founder of the

Memorial's,dedication draws fire 
By JIM RILEY Assistant News Editor 
A peace group will stand by In 
prayerful silence during a mass 
dedicating the Clarke Memorial 
Fountain this afternoon. 
The group objects to the wor­
ding on the memorial and the 
"militaristic nature" of the 
dedication, according to Joe 
Ross, a member of Pax Christi, 
an International Catholic peace 
organization. 
Members of the groups Pax 
Christi and Women United for ·Justice and Peace will attend the dedication ceremonies holding 
banners, according to Ross. 
Ross said, "We will stand along 
the assembly In silence with ban­
ners that say 'The God of Peace 
Is never glorlfled by human vio­
lence' and 'Pax Christi'." The 
former Is a quote from Thomas Merton, according to Ross. 
Contingents from each of the three Reserve Officers' Training Corps units will attend In dress uniforms, and the colors will be presented before mass, accor­ding to Richard Conklin, director of public relations and Informa­tion. About 150 ROTC members will attend the ceremonies, ac­cording to ROTC members. 
There will also be an Air Force A· 7 jet fighter "fly-over" east to west before the liturgy begins at 4 p.m., weather permitting, ac­cording to Conklin. 
"We are not objecting to remembering war dead," said Ross. Rather, Ross said the group objects to some of the wording on the memorial and to the nature of the dedication. · 
The wording on one side ofthe memorial reads "Pro patrla et pace," for fatherland and for peace. "It is precisely this mis­taken dedication to fatherland­nationalism, that often en­courages and rebukes peace," said a Pax Christi statement. 
The group also objects to the large presence of the military among the speakers, the guests, and In the fly-over, according to Ross. ''To work for peace does not mean celebrating mass In the midst of warplanes," Ross said. 
''Those are not the trappings of peace. Those are the trap­pings of war," .said Ross. 
Ross said he'd like to have the group's actions considered a prayerful silence rather than a protest. "We will not disrupt or be disrespectful," he said. 
Assistant Director of Security Phil Johnson said Security had no Indications of disruptive ac-

University President Father Theodore Hesburgh was not involved. ·Because of time constraints in rehersal, "Louie, Louie" will not be played during this week's show but will be back after break, according to band members.

Saying goodbye to parents no longer child's play 
When I began my stay at Notre Dame in the fall 
of 198.3, I remember thinking that my transition 
to college symbolized my passage Into Indepen­
dent adulthood. I wasn't quite sure what this pas­
sage Involved --I wasn't even sure I wanted to 
make It --but I recall holding one certainty about 
the event: It would mark a true movement away 
from my parents. 
I remember saying a quick goodbye to my par­
ents by their car after first surreptitiously scanning 
the surrounding parking lot to make sure no one 
was watching. After ali, even If I did feel that my 
entire sense of security was driving away In my 
c;tad's Plymouth, I certainly couldn't let anyone 
else see how childish I was being. Things would 
have to change. 
Three years and a lot of growing up later, I can acknowledge the partial truth of my belief; my relationship with my parents has changed. The change was not the distancing I had imagined, however; I have instead come to a deeper ap­preciation of my parents and an understanding of how Important they are in my life. 
I'm sure my realizations are not unique --they are merely reflective of a pattern that countless parents and children have gone through and countless more will experience. 
I, of course, didn't know this as I tried to non­chalantly wave goodbye that fall. but my parents with the infinite and often maddening wisdom that seems to descend on ordinary mortals the mo­ment they have a child --did. I can imagine the wise smiles on their faces as they drove down Notre Dame Avenue. 
Ail parents must realize that their child's appar­ent disinterest in them is only a phase, a phase which doesn't begin with the advent of freshman year but with the onset of adolescence. How else could they put up with that long and exasperating stage of being treated as if they were imbeciles? 
During my high-school years my parents heard all the patented "Stop-treating-me-like-a-child" arguments, usually asserted by me when I was acting particularly childishly. Convincing my mom that I didn't need a hat in 20-degree-below-zero weather seemed of global importance to me; making my dad realize that ali the kids my age stayed out past 1 2 consumed my conversations with him. Everybody else's parents were inflnitely more understanding and modern; mine were old­fashioned and narrow-minded. 
It seems a universal irony ofadolescent thought that growing up means growing away. By the time I reach,ed college, I had created such a veneer of maturity and Independence --I had "won" enough of those high-school battles --that I thought leaving home and parents behind would be easy. 
My enlightenment came quickly. 
It is said that familiarity breeds contempt and absence makes the heart grow fonder, a phrase perhaps most aptly applied to one's discoveries 
Mary Heilmann 
Assistant News Editor 


during freshman year. Ail it took was one bout with the flu --minus mom's constant care --and one less-than-desirable grade on a calculus test for me to realize how much I needed my parents. After all my adolescent efforts to grow up by chal­lenging my parents' role in my life, I finally was forced to move toward real maturity by ack­nowledging their importance. 
My perceptions of my relationship with my par­ents inevitably continued to change as I became more capabl,e of handling my own affairs. Even­tually I didn't need to receive frequent letters -­an occasional phone call would suffice. My parents were no longer the god-like providers of my child­hood or the adversaries of my teen-age years. They became simply real people whom I respect and admire. 
There have been many good-byes since that first awkward one outside my new home. Perhaps the most significant of these occurred when I said good-bye to my mom and dad after last year's Junior Parents' Weekend. Having spent a wonder­ful weekend sharing my college home and life with them, it was hard to see it end. This time, though, I hugged and kissed them good-bye next to the car --not caring who noticed --and watched until their car was out of sight. 
And I'm sure the same wise smiles were on their faces as they drove down Notre Dame Avenue.

Hesburgh 
continuedfrom page 1 
More than half of the facilities you see here just weren't here then. 
"I mean It's hard to think of the place without an ACC, with­out a Nleuwland Science, without a Liberal Arts building, without a library, without half the residence halls we have, etc., etc. 
"But that's an easy perception. That's just the physical percep­tion. The more Important Is the qualitative perception --the fact that the faculty Is better, the stu­dents are better, and we're now co-educational, thank God. We just have a better community than we had back then." 
Admission of women 
Besides the transfer of gover­nance from the Congregation of Holy Cross to a mostly lay Board of Trustees in 1967, the biggest change during Hesburgh's ten­ure Is probably the admission of women to the undergraduate program In 1972. 
That change has made Notre Dame "much more like a family," says Hesburgh. "Women bring many talents that men don't have to the University community." 
In addition, he says, "there's a much easier-going attitude be­tween men and women on this campus than there was when It was all men, and when a woman walked on this campus it was like feeding time at the monkey cage. 
"Now everybody's rather relaxed and I think the whole spirit of the place is better." 
130 countries visited 
Since becoming president 34 years ago, Hesburgh's travels have become almost legendary among the student body. The Notre Dame president estimates he's covered more than two mil­lion miles and seen about 130 countries. 
What does he say to critics who contend he hasn't spent enough time on campus? 
"I think I've spent enough time here to do what had to be done," says Hesburgh. "And a few things besides. 
"''ve been to New York prob­ably 500 times and seen one play. So I wasn't there to amuse myself," he adds. "I think on bal­ance I probably could say I spent more than 60 percent ofmy time on the campus and worked a double shift when I was here and never missed a day. 
"However, I've got to say that once a myth gets started there's no putting it down, and it makes for amusement and good stories." 
Popes and presidents 
Much of the reason for Hes­burgh's travels stems from his work outside the University. He has served four popes, three as permanent Vatican City repre­sentative to the International Atomic Energy Agency for 14 years. 
He has had 14 presidential ap­pointments, one ofwhich was as a charter member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights In 1957. 
Another was as ambassador to the 1979 U.N. Conference on Sci­ence and Technology for Devel­opment. which made him the 
first Catholic priest to serve in a formal diplomatic role for the 
U.S. government. Hesburgh was also the first priest to serve as a director of the Chase Manhattan Bank and a trustee of the Rock­efeller Foundation. 
All told, Hesburgh has been or now Is a member of about 75 boards, committees and organi­zations. 
"You learn a lot by being on these different groups," he says. "I went on the National Science Board and I never had had a class In physics. But !learned an awful lot of physics and became some­what of an expert in the field of nuclear energy, and Its possibil­Ities and Its peaceful uses. 
"And I think now I understand what the warlike uses are and how to avoid them." 
Turned down 'interesting jobs' 
Looking back on his career, Hesburgh says there's nothing else In public service he wishes he'd done. He adds, however, "I turned down some Interesting 

jobs because I didn't think they were compatible with being a priest or head of a Catholic uni­versity." 
For example, says Hesburgh, "I turned down being the director of NASA at one point, which I would have enjoyed doing. That was at the time we were getting ready to go to the moon with the Apollo program." 
Had he not become a priest and Notre Dame president, what would he have done? "It's diffi­cult to answer that because I never wanted to be anything but a priest, " he says. 
"I don't want to be anything but a priest today, and I'm delighted I became a priest. I only hope I die a priest. So I never speculated about doing something else." 
2 112 pages of awards 
The success Hesburgh's had In public service Is borne out by the honors and awards he's received, which take 2 112 pages to list. 

They include the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest ci­vilian award; as well as the. Meik­lejohn Award ofthe American As­sociation of University Professors, given to Hesburgh in 1970 for his help in warding off the Nixon administration's at­tempt to use federal troops to squelch nationwide campus un­rest In 1969. 
Hesburgh, however, may be most noted for his honorary degrees, the first of which Le Moyne College awarded him in in 1954. Four years ago he en­tered the "Guinness Book of World Records" after breaking the old record of 89 honorary doctorates, and now holds 11 0 of such degrees. 
After his retirement 

Once he retires in May, Hes­burgh says the first thing he wants to do, "and the only thing that I'm set on at this moment, Is to get away from here for a year so that the new people will have elbow room ...." 
After that, Hesburgh says he hopes to return to Notre Dame with Executive Vice President Fa­ther Edmund Joyce, who is retir­Ing at the same time as himself. "I hope to come back and have an office with Father Ed In the library and do whatever I can to

'Mikey' to eat Life cereal again 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -After 15 years, "Mikey," the finicky toddler who wouldn't eat anything, is back touting Life cereal. 
Mikey, a.k.a. John Gilchrist, 18, was the star of a 1971 TV commercial in which he was the silent guinea pig for two older brothers who wouldn't take a chance on Life, a cereal that was supposed to be good for them. 
They were pretty sure Mikey wouldn't like it, but Mlkey dug 
in,  and  the  brothers  ex­ 
claimed,  "He  likes  HI  Hey,  
Mikeyl  


In the new commercial, Gilchrist has some lines, to show he has since learned to talk, he said. 
The older brothers in the commercial were Gilchrist's real-life brothers Michael, now 21, and Tommy, 2.3. The com­mmercial is one of hundreds which he and his six brothers and sisters have filmed in the past 16 years, Gilchrist said. 
"You don't have to be talented" to make commer­cials, Gilchrist said, but "it can 
be tough.  With  a  little hard  
work  it  can  be  done  by  
anyone."  

Gilchrist attributed the fam­ily's early success to their "chubby cheeks, all-American look." 
He doesn't know how much money he makes. "My parents handle all the financial part." · 
The earnings of all the siblings, ages 8 to 24, are evenly divided and used to finance their college educa­tions, he said. 
In the new commercial, Gilchrist, who said people sometimes stop him and say "Aren't you ...?" is rejected by a girl who refuses to believe he is the original Mikey.

Pornography opponents go too far in new law 
The University of North Carolina, Greensboro. Located near beautiful mountains and gorgeous beaches, with one of the more appealing climates in the country and boasting one of the more beautiful campuses in the nation. Sounds like a great place to spend four years of college, right? Who could ask for more? An idyllic atmosphere in which to learn and experience through the free flow of Ideas and ... 
Michael Froning 
in the minority 
Hold on a second. I forgot. Thanks to a small group of fundamentalist in­tolerants, supported, unsurprisingly, by Jerry Falwell, North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms and the Reagan White House, North Carolina has passed a new obscenity law. Under the pretext of fight­ing hard-core pornography, this new law has reached unprecedented heights in le~ally attacking the first ammendment. 
Some of the hard-core pornography eliminated by the new law? Just try to find The New York Times, The Washing­ton Post, the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue or American Photographer in Greensboro since the city's leading newsstand closed down. Why? Newsstand owners are afraid of disseminating obscenity to a minor. 
Video stores have also taken the hint. Movies like Animal House, Splash, and Risky Business are difficult if not impossible to find. Why? Again, because of the fear of being charged with a felony. 
The library at the University of North Carolina-Greensboro has also been af­fected. "Dangerous" books are disap­pearing from the shelves. The titles of these hard-core pornographic publica­tions? "Human Reproduction" and "Where Did I Come From?": basic sex edu­cation books designed for young children and teenagers. 
Ridiculous, you say? Unenforceable? That's what my friends back east say when I tell them about parietals. Think again. The "test case" for North Carolina's new law was met with astounding success. Convicted by a jury for selling two magazines -which another jury deemed to be obscene -to an undercover police officer at the bookstore where she worked, twenty-one year old Sherr! An­derson was the beneficiary of two three­year jail sentences (suspended to six months) and a fine of $10,000 in addition to court costs. The law seems to be working alarmingly well. 
Why would anyone embark on such a crusade, such an obvious assault on the first ammendment? According to religi­ous crusaders, it is mostly because the atheistic ideology being perpetuated by 
secular  humanists  must  be  checked.  
These  typical  anti-Christians  espouse  
such  outragous  ideals  as  a  belief  in  

feminism, the abolishment of corporal punishment in day-care centers, and more radical sex education (as if we have any to begin with --less than 1 0 percent of all secondary schools in the United States have any form of sex education 
whatsm~ver.) 
The chief disseminators of this anti­Christian propaganda? Why, Hugh Hef­ner, Bob Guccione, Dr. Ruth and the three m~or T.V. networks, of course. 
ABC, CBS and NBC? Atheistic, secular humanist anti-Christians? Sure. Accor­ding to National Federation for Decency executive director Don Wildman, "Of the people who control television, who tell us what we can watch on the networks, fifty­nine percent were raised in Jewish homes." Nothing quite like a scapegoat, is there now, Wildman? 
A National Federation for Decency? Let's be serious. How about the National Federation for Racism, Sexism, Ignor­ance and General Intolerance! 
The religious right is no more than a neo-McCarthyist group of fundamen­talists who equate differences in opinion or belief with "sin" and a direct attack on the correct "morality." These people hav decided that the only way to reconcile these differences of "morality'' is to elim­inate them by deciding for everyone what should be seen and heard. 

Wake up and smell the coffee. Pornog­raphy is wrong, and must be dealt with, but that does not justify restricting one's freedom of choice through totalitarian laws or promoting intolerance through the use of scapegoats. There is no "final solution." Hiding under the guise of fight­ing pornography to legislate discrimina­tion and persecution of people of differ­ent beliefs is not permissible in this country. 
Our job as citizens of the United States is to protect the laws and ideals that even allow intolerants such as these religious crusaders to attain power. However, we can not allow these people to decimate the laws that protect our freedom to be different. Take a closer look at some of the groups espousing "decency." Are they really just fighting pornography, or are they trying to impose their own beliefs on society by eliminating ours?

P.O.BoxQ 

Reagan's personal goal interfered in Iceland 
Dear Editor: 
Well, the chill of Iceland has now spread over the entire globe. The Soviets went Into the talks looking to make a deal. And Ronald Reagan killed the entire summit over a single issue. 
Reagan was the first U.S. president to be offered major concessions by the Soviets. 
Reagan could have made incredible arms control agreements which would have vastly reduced the gross overabun­dance of nuclear weapons. 
Reagan could have made history as one who wanted peace and an end to the arms race. 
Reagan could have done a lot of things... but he didn't. 
Why? Because he would have had to limit his personal golden calf -SDI: Star Wars. It was the only condition that the Soviets required. Reagan could have had incredible concession from the Soviets if he had agreed to keep testing "in the lab" for ten years. Reagan refused the offers in the name of the "free world." If the Soviets had offered Reagan the opportu­nity to take over Russia, he would have refused if Star Wars was at stake. 
Is Reagan ignorant or just plain arro­gant? Only his proctologist knows from where his thoughts emanate. How could anyone have passed up such a conces­sion over a single issue of personal pride . . . and then blame the other guys for the negotiations breakdown? There 
Doonesbury 
should be no doubt in anyone's mind after this -Ronald Reagan doesn't want arms control. But the American people? the Congress? Such high level negotia­tions should not have been left to Ronald Reagan to befuddle according to his own private goals. 
I am disgusted and disheartened by Reagan's latest display of ignorance. His refusal to make a notable concession has made America lose a lot of her interna­tional prestige. I only pray that the Soviets are patient and will return someday to the bargaining table. 
Andrew Saal Dillon Hall 
True peace cannot be based on fear of war 
Dear Editor: 
Over the past year I have watched the construction of the new Clark Memorial with interest. Initially, I wondered what It was going to look like. Now, I wonder what it means. It seems clear that In the design of the Memorial is embodied a definite view about the place of war in our world. 
One reasonable analysis of the design of the Memorial, It seems, would be as follows. The ball in the center seems to symbolize peace. Its central location sug­gests that the Memorial has at its core a concern about peace. However, it seems clear that the four sets of columns sym­bolize war. They are imposing, fortress­like structures and the names of the three wars commemorated are written on three of them. It does not take much Imagina­tion to deduce the meaning of the Memorial if these two symbols are ac­curately described. 
The Memorial seems to represent the belief that peace must be founded on the possibility of war. The columns are ori­ented in a defensive configuration. War, then, is a defensive mechanism to Insure peace. The Monument says that a willing­ness to go to war is an essential compo­nent of peace. But, one must ask, does this make sense? Any "peace" that is founded on the potential for war is not truly peace. Rather, such a "peace" would be more accurately described as a bal­ance ofterror. True peace, it would seem, must be built on something other than fear ofwar, something like a commitment to treat one's fellow man with both love and justice. 
The Memorial, then, makes an impor­tant statement of the predicament of the modern world. We live In a world which is not at peace, but is rather in a condition of fear. Today's "peace" is built on the balance of nuclear weapons between the superpowers. Much like the four sets of columns In the Memorial, nuclear mis­siles stand to Insure that the balance of terror continues, that "peace" is preserved. 
In deciding whether to call the Clark Memorial a War Memorial or a Peace Memorial, I have a hard time. It would not be accurate to call it a Peace Memorial for reasons which should be clear from above. At the same time, the Memorial is committed to a condition which, although 
Garry Trudeau 

it is not true peace, is not war either. It 
seems to be committed to a condition of 
non-war. Thus, It would not be accurate 
to call It the War Memorial. Over and above all the symbolism about the place of war in our world is the Memorial to the Notre Dame men who gave their lives in America's last three wars. Perhaps for this reason it would be preferable to just call the monument a Memorial. 
Joe Merchant Grace Hall 

Thought behind policy is needed for change 
Dear Editor: 
Eric Wierchart's "P.O. Box Q" letter was 
one of those which does my heart a lot 
of good. 'Good' In the sense that it proves 
that letters-to-the-editor are worth 
reading because every once in a while, 
one contains a pretty important message. 
Wlechart's letter shows that we should not 
be concerned with just the alcohol policy, 
but also with the philosophy which per­
petuates it. 
I ask that you reprint Wednesday's 'P.O. 
Box Q' for the students, Goldrick and 
Tyson, who would have otherwise over­
looked it. Maybe then some of these 
people will concentrate less on legislation 
and a little more on "education, discus­
sion and communication." That would be 
a positive change, one which would really 
do my heart some good.

The Irish Guard Is an instantly recognizable symbol of Notre Dame. 
The Irish Guard, ND's colorful football tradition 
By ANDREA LaFRENIERE Saint Mary's Sports Editor 
An aura of mystery surrounds the tower­ing ten who lead the way to the stadium on football Saturdays. 
Onlookers stand in awe of the shako­topped marchers shielding the Notre Dame Marching Band. 
Though they are ordinary students during the week, on football Saturdays the mem­bers of the Irish Guard become symbols of the University. 
From the moment they don their finery, these men embody the Notre Dame spirit, and their serious expressions suggest the attitude with which they undertake their duties. 
"Being a member of the Guard is a very serious thing when it comes to game dates," remarks Pat Kruczek. one of four rookies named to this year's Guard. 
"Once we put on our shakos, we're not 
see GUARD, page 2 


Kleine focuses on 'the little things' 
By PETE GEGEN Sports Writer 

One of the more recognizable figures on the Irish football squad this season is senior defensive tackle Wally Kleine. 
He Is easily spotted on the field In his 6-9 frame, towering above offensive linemen as well as his own teammates. 
He also Is a very quotable player off the field, deliver­ing lines in his Texas drawl which make for prime feature-story material. 
Kleine Is a definite pro prospect because of his size and strength, as also his instruction by respected coaches such as Joe Yonto, Foge Fazio and, of course, Lou Holtz. 
All of this makes good press for Kleine and the team. But the real value of Kleine is not one of his more recognizable traits. It is his leadership both on and off the field which he prefers to keep low-key. 
"My style of play is to lead by example," says Kleine. "It is not nescessarllyjumpin', hootin' and a holierln', and ali that stuff. We have guys who do that, and that's fine -we need guys who do that. But I'm not one of those." 
Kleine has controlled the defensive line, recording .32 tackles (17 solo) and sacking the quarterback three time for 2.3 yards In losses. He ranks behind only captain Mike Kovaleski in tackles. 
But his leadership on the field does not end after the game. Realizing that the "little things" have been hurting the Irish recently, Kleine has tried to set the example of working hard on the basics In practice. 

"I try to focus on the little things," he says. "Coach (Joe) Yonto helps me emphasize and put into action things like staying low, keep my shoulders out, keep charging forward. 
"Being 6-9, you're at a disadvantage being so tall. While at the same time you have a definite advantage, the little guys, like the ones from Air Force, come so low, and I'm a foot taller than some of those guys." 
Kleine believes In working on the little things, and feels that the entire team must continue to do so. 
"We want to win," he says. "We have to master the little things -I hate to keep on saying It, but that's what it is. All it takes is one or two of them to beat you."

allowed to smile. This puts us In the proper frame of mind." 
Kruczek, a senior from Alexandria, Ind., explains what he and fellow Guard mem­bers symbolize. 
"One of our primary duties is simply to be representatives of Notre Dame," he says. "The Guard· is a big thing with alumni who look to us to uphold the Uni­versity traditions and embellish the things Notre Dame stands for." 
In addition to assuming solemn expres­sions, part of the Irish Guard's game day ritual includes dressing in traditional at­tire. Donning the Guardsman's outfit, in­cluding kilt, doublet. spats and shoes, often takes the members one and a half hours. Once attired, the Guard is in­spected by former Guardsmen who have returned to the University for the weekend. 
"It's a great honor to wear the uniform," comments John Kennedy, a senior and fourth-year Guardsman from Olen Mills, Penn., who says there Is a certain thrill that comes wlth being a part of the Guard. 
"There are a lot of good things about being a member, but game day Is definitely the best thing." he said. "It's great to wear the uniform, march In front ofthe band and represent the University." 
Kennedy, this year's Irish Guard Captain, had an Input In the selection of the Guardsmen earlier this fall. 
Along with James Phillips. director of the Marching Band, and Fr. George Wlskir­chen, C.S.C., director of the Notre Dame Jazz Band, Kennedy chose the Guardsmen on the basis ofmarching abil­Ity, enthusiasm and appearance. 
In addition to Kruczek. Tom Desmond, a junior from Troy, Mich., Brian McDonald, a sophomore from Southport. Conn., and John McGlinn, a freshman from Sinking Spring. Penn., were named as first-year Guardsmen.

Third-year veterans include senior Dan O'Brien, ofGlenview, Ill., andjunlors Mlck Connors, of Leesburg. Va., and Sean Munster, of Chicago, Ill. 
All ten members share a camaraderie that comes from working hard together and playing hard together.

The time the Guard spends socializing together has created a bondedness among Its members that probably cannot be found In any other group on campus, according to Kruczek. 
"The Irish Guard Is probably the closest thing there Is to a fraternity on campus," he said. "We share a real closeness." 
Kennedy also notes the fellowship among the Guardsmen. 
"We're serious, but we're also social," he said. "The Guard Is a great bunch of guys." 
That the members of the Irish Guard cap­ture the true Notre Dame spirit is apparent from the moment they step off on game days, marching past Washington Hall all the way to the stadium, putting on a pre­game performance that delights all.

Tailgaters 
Pratibha Tripathi

Chanting "Go Irish," alumni and fans magicly appear over­night at Green Field to celebrate such an auspiscious occasion as Notre Dame foot­ball with pre-game festivities -the tailgaters. 
"You can't beat this kind of stuff on a Saturday after­noon," agreed Lenny Zappia, class of 198.3. 
"I never got to tailgate be­cause I was an Irish Guard. I enjoy it because I like seeing friends who graduated with me," said Dave Delahaney '8.3. 
"A lot more women!" ex­claimed Patrick Kerrigan, a lawyer and a 1971 graduate. "When we went here the adults tailgated. We did not have access to cars so we did our partying In the dorms." 
"It's good that the under­graduate students have a place where they can vent their energy without worrying about being harassed by the South Bend Pollee," stated Scott Zwingley, a · 198.3 graduate and an MBA student. 
Despite all Its traditions, ex­citement and the various opinions the alumni hold, tall­gaters have become a con­cern to the University and the neighboring community. 
While the students are con­
cerned with the strict rules 
and penalties, Notre Dame Se­
curity Is busy carrying out new plans to minimize the usual and the unusual incidents that arise during every home foot­ball weekend. 
"If you can't tailgate then you lose much of the com­raderie of the ball game. Tail­gaters are one of the places the alumni get to mix with the students," said Mike Kelly, class of 198.3. 
"The event is more than a football game. It is supposed to be a relaxed, enjoyable at­mosphere," agreed Director of Security, Rex J. Rakow. "It is, however, the responsibility of the fans that they don't in­fringe on rights of others." 
Rakow emphasized the im­portance ofgoodjudgment as well as the observance of the Parking Lot Rules. Rule no. 4 of the seven rules is targeted especially towards those who plan to tailgate and drink. said Rakow. "Abuse of the rights ofothers as a result of the use of Intoxicating beverages will not be tolerated in the parking lots or on any University grounds." 
"We have .30 extra people to deal with such problems and safety and security of the pa­trons," said Rakow. "The dif­ferent approach this year Is that the security is working in pairs this year. It gives extra pairs of eyes and ears in the parking lots."

Chris Bearman Droke her leg and sued the University for liability, thus spurring some of the p'recautions and rules. According to Rakow the court In this case demanded the provision of more security. 
"Over one-third the persons attending the game tailgate," said Rakow. The large number presents other situations at the tailgaters. Rakow recalled an incident when an alumnus insisted on a car being towed because it was parked In his usual parking space. 
A more usual problem is the disregard for the rule that prohibits kegs in the parking lots. According to Rakow the security confiscated five kegs during the Purdue vs. Notre Dame game. 
"The alcohol policy is very specific about tailgates. So we have to deal with them accord­ingly," said Rakow. "If there's a feeling of stopping tail­gaters, it is because of the in­creased number of security (officers)," said Rakow. 
"The bottom line is that people ought to realize when their behavior is infringing on the rights of others. If that is used as a guideline then there won't be a problem."

MICHELLE WITT features writer 

Some of the finest music being composed today lies hiaden and unnoticed behind the enigmatic mask of modern minimalism. Philip Glass stands at the forefront ofthis new movement by chal­lenging previous harmonic and rhythmic approaches to musical structure. The opera "Einstein On The Beach," ( 1975) music by Glass, staging by Robert Wilson, il­lustrates a certain obssession which Glass has for hypnotic and complex rhythmic tex­tures -the hallmark of his works. 
His work creates an effect distinctly its own. He com­bines many elements includ­
ing  choirs,  electronic  syn­ 
thesizers,  conventional  
instruments  and  spoken  

words to get his special sound. 
Glass' ideas concerning mu­sical space and time are largely new to post-13th cen­tury western music, the sys­tem upon which pop, jazz and rock are all based. Glass is at­tempting to evoke fresh expe­riences by questioning this tradition. 
All music creates a certain space in which to play out the expression if its ideas. The use of rhythm as a primary means of expressing and ex­ploring musical space is the essential characteristic which sets Glass's work apart from popular music in general. 
depends on a consistent spa­tialttemporal structure. This regular framework serves as a foundation for the linear progression of the melody, usually the dominant elememt in western music. The melody builds up tension until the climax releases the energy and settles into resolu­tion. The contrast against the steady beat allows one to best perceive the melodic varia­tions which are responsible for creating the feeling. 
Glass, on the other hand, 
rectly to rhythmic structure, allowing rhythm to dominate and guide the overall shape of the piece. Rhythm is the main variable, not melody. In his music for the opera Einstien on The Beach, Glass uses this idea of rhythm over melody to create a hypnotiz­ing, intricate musical landscape. 
These compositional in­novations stem from quite a formidable background of classical training. Beginning his studi~s at The Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, MD, Glass entered the Univer­sity of Chicago at the age of 15. 
Between 195 7 and 196 1 he was a composition student at Julliard, and after graduation received a grant from The Ford Foundation to be a composer-in-residence with the Pittsburg Public School System. In 1964, Glass was awarded a Fullbright grant for study in Paris. 
One of his earliest compo­sitions, a rhythmic piece called One Plus One ( 1968) il­lustrates the essence of all his musical compositions. The idea behind the piece is that Glass begins with two simple rhythmic units which lend themselves to all manner of combination. This idea of ad­
ditive  rhythm  provides  the  
basis  for  the  music  of  
"Einstein."  

The title itself refers to a novel by Nevil Shute about the people of Australia left un­touched by World War Ill but ultimately doomed by the ra­dioactive fallout. By placing Einstien himselfon the beach, waiting with the Austrailians for the wind to bring the end, Glass gives us a clear image of a man facing the results of his actions. 
The opera itself consists of four main scenes, each of which has corresponding thematic music. Trains are symbolic in the first scene of the toy trains Einstein played with as a child and later used to illustrate his theory of relativity. Next, a trial scene seems to suggest Einstein as a self-proclaimed criminal, re­ferring to the distructive powers which he and modern science have helped to un­leash. A spaceship in the third scene seems to extend his theories towards a future of time transcendence. 

Einstein was quite an ac­complished violinist and often played for relaxation. He is placed strategically through­out the work quietly watching 
the  action, and  playing  his  
fiddle.  
In  Glass'  music  as  in  

Einstein's world, the impor­tance of any one element depends upon the point of view of the observer. The feeling ofGlass' work changes as the listener focuses atten­tion on one or another of its aspects. In this way Glass in­cludes that observer in the creative process. Within the limits that Glass has deter­mined for us, we are free to interpret, to wander within a new world of sound. 
By far, the best way to un­derstand the ideas of Glass is by listening to his music. Einstein On The Beach is available at the audio re­sources center on the second floor of Memorial Library. The hours for the center are 8 a.m. to I0:45 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and I p.m. to 10:45 p.m. The unique experience of Philip Glass is one which will expand any music lover's appreciation of the art.

She first gained acclaim for her spec­tatcular one-woman show on Broadway. Then, seemingly from nowhere, she wowed audiences as Celie, the abused and tortured wife in Stephen Spielberg's adaptation of "The Color Purple." Now she's back on the big screen with "Jum­pin' Jack Flash" attempting to combine her strong dramatic skills with her comic antics. In this vehicle, however, the two ingredients do not always mix well.

It goes like this. G(')ldberg plays Terri Doolittle, a computer operator in the monetary transaction department ofa na­tional bank. She is not exactly normal though. Whereas all the other operators In her area keep their desks relatively clean of any mementoes of the outside world, Doolittle likes to keep small toys on top of her terminal, including a rubber Pokey with which she often plays. tfer apartment is also indicative of her char­acter. Spy novels litter the floor as well as wierd, eccentric novelties like the six­foot long toothbrush she uses to scare a visitor. 
In her endeavor to keep her job from getting too mundane, Doolittle resorts to holding conversations, through her com­puter, with operators in other parts of the world. One day a message comes through on her terminal from a person named Jumpin' Jack Flash. Jack, as she calls him, is a CIA agent who enlists her to help him escape from an Eastern Block country. 
Ever the investigative, curious type, Doolittle takes the assignment because she does not want to see Jack die. In her attempt to obtain vital information she is forced to take a swim in one of New York City's polluted rivers and watch agents die. She also has a dangerous fight with a paper shredder and is dragged through the streets of the city in a phonebooth by a towtruck. 
Goldberg is not bad here. She was fan­tastic in "The Color Purple." That movie, however, contained an unparallelled script. "Jumpin' Jack Flash" tries to mix two totally different genres, a suspense­thriller and a comedy, into a believable, yet funny movie. This does not work. For one thing, Goldberg does not know when she is supposed to be funny and, as such, certain lines which might draw great laughs in other situations, fall flat. There is also a use of jokes which only certain groups can understand. It is impossible to take Goldberg seriously when she Is uttering jokes directed at a British audi­ence and the fllm is made and produced for markets in the United States. 
Nonetheless, when she is given the chance to truly act In her best comedic style, she comes through with a presence that one can't help but laugh and want more. tfer emotional scenes are also quite good at times, though she is once agairi fighting the script. 
Backing Goldberg up is a strong cast of comedians and actors including Step­hen Collins, who you may remeber as Commander Decker in "Star Trek: The Movie," James Belushi, Annie Potts and John (Yeah, that's the ticket) Lovitz of "Saturday Night Live." They all play bit parts to Goldberg's lead, but each mem­ber of the cast adds a flavor to the movie which helps it stay alive. 
Probably the biggest problem with this film is it's title. "Jumpin' Jack Flash" the song is used but once to setup the prem­ise. After that it disappears and is never seen again, prompting the viewer to wonder if the name of the movie was cho­sen solely because the Rolling stones have such strong drawing power. In any case, just the fact that this question arises is a disappointment. 
Penny Marshall of"Laverne and Shirley" fame makes her big screen directorial debut here and shows some promise. She 
Scene-page 3 

directed a few episodes for her now synd­icated sitcom and is now aspiring to greater heights. She has created a likable, 
although highly implausible, movie mostly through Goldberg's ability to make even a questionable script a suc­cess. 
In the end, "Jumpin' Jack Flash" leaves 
the viewer with a somewhat empty feeling. Any lasting impressions are due to the competence of Goldberg and her supporting cast. "Jumpin' Jack Flash" could have gone a long way with a 

stronger script. As it now stands the movie isn't a gas, gas, gas at all. 
"Jumpln' Jack Flash" Is now show· lng at the Town and Country Theater.

it may even be life-giving. If ·nobody cared about truth, love would grow confused; integrity would lose its bearings; poetry would die. That state ofour souls 
would be pitiable. 

Human beings become highly 
self righteous in snarling, or in 
appearing grieved, at each other 
as defenders of the truth. What 
is truth? Is it the same as preju­

The world would be healthier 
if most of us sent our ideas of 
truth back to the drawing board, 
and started the design from

rience. Universal truth begins 
with universal experience. 

What we have seen with our 
own eyes is that man is a traveller 
on a planet which only half 
tolerates him. He once was dust, 
and will be dust again; he starts 
struggling with death at the mo­
ment he was conceived. The 
cards were stacked against him, 
and he will lose the battle; even 
is he has the strength of a giant, 
he will be defeated. In the long, 
long sleep, he will share a bed 
under the starry sky with the 
beasts of the field and the birds 
of the air. 

You may have the faith that 
moves mountains, but nothing 
can save you from feeling sick at 
the faces of the defeated seen 
on television: the starving 
Africans, the napalmed Asians, 
the prisoners In the war camps, 
the street people In American 
cities, the victims and refugees 
with the light gone from their 
eyes. But for the grace of God, 
you could be numbered among 
the walking dead.

stories of the human condition.

A cynic remarked, "If there 
were not a God, we would have 
to Invent Him." Quite a number 
of people don't have God; or 
having Him, they give Him up 
when they see the suffering 
which the universe tolerates. 
We write the theology, hymns 
and creeds in praise of the Father

we're sure of keeping our heads

noticed, use formulas, "St. 
Bridget and St. Patrick, defend

to ward off the lightning and 
keep the roof from caving in.

making plans, to show God we 
didn't take our tomorrows for 
granted. She was constantly as­

Nothing is more visible than the evidence for the existence of an Enemy who makes a project of plotting holocausts: in Biafra, Ethiopia, Cambodia, Vietnam, Nicaragua; and in the sick rooms of hospitals where children die of cancer. 
Need the weight of human suf­fering discourage us? Only on bad <jays, when faith is weak. A strong Christian faith trusts the Cross to which Love was nailed as our bridge over troubled waters. Isaiah, writing of Christ before His birth, told us He would be a suffering servant. 
The Church began when water and blood flowed from the side of the wounded Lamb of God. Easter promised us a victory in which the flesh will share when the sad, suffering rags of the human condition are trans­formed into vestments of light.

also provides the Falcons with strength and quickness on the line. All four linebackers for Air Force -Brady Glick. Makl, Jeff Weathers, and E.J. Jones-are seniors. As a unit, the Falcons hold op­ponents to 77.7 yards per game rushihg, and less than 2.5 yards per carry. Last week. they held Navy's Chuck Smith, who came into the Air Force game the nation's top rusher averaging 150 yards a game, to only 40 yards in 1 7 carries. 
If there is a weakness, it lies in the Air Force secondary. But even that is decep­tive. While the Falcons have given up 
245.2 yards per game through the air, that statistic has to be put In the context of the pass-happy Westen Athletic Con­ference. 
The secondary and pass-rush are solid. Senior cornerbacks Tom Rotella and Mike Toliver anchor a defensive backfield that has intercepted 11 passes so far this season. Rotella, who is the all-time inter­ception leader at Air Force, has five of that total, and has also broken up five more. 
"People just aren't going to sit there and pick them apart throwing the ball nor are you going to be able to maintain the ball on a consistent basis running because they run an awful lot of different defenses," says Holtz. 
"They never make a mental error. Defen­sively they aren't going to give up a lot of points, and they haven't." 
Look for some changes offensively for the Irish, mainly caused by injuries. Soph­omore starting tailback Mark Green, who suffered a severe thigh bruise against Pitt, will be replaced by 6-1, 220-pound fresh­man Anthony Johnson. Braxston Banks (6-2, 208), yet another freshman, should see more time at fullback behind starter Pernell Taylor. It is doubtful whether

Green, who leads the Irish with 186 yards rushing, will see any action Saturday. 
The big issue, as always, will be at quar­terback. Steve Beuerlein will get the start­ing nod for Notre Dame against Air Force, his concussion against Alabama keeping him out ofonly three offensive series last week against Pitt. 
"At the present time, Steve Beuerlein gets us the best plays in the most opportune times and is the most consistent doing that," says Holtz.

By TERRY LYNCH 
Sports Writer 

Notre Dame vs. Air Force. It sure conjures up some great memories In Irish football history, doesn't It? 
Maybe you remember last year, when the Falcons' Terry Maki broke through the Irish line late in the fourth quarter to block a John Carney field goal attempt, and Maki's teammate, A.J. Scott, picked up the ball and running 77 yards for the win­ning touchdown. Maybe you remember all 13 penalties against the Irish, most of which aiding the Falcons In repelling the Irish offense from their end zone. 
If you have a really good memory, you might recall the record crowd at Falcon Stadium (aided by portable stands) and that the game was on national television, providing the Falcons with exposure never seen before In their history. 
However, and rather sadly, It is only the Irish football master who can remember the last time Notre Dame came away from the Air Force game with a win. With last year's victory over the Irish, the Falcons are on the verge of joining the ranks of only two other teams who have managed to beat the Irish five years in a row. Mic­higan State (1959-63) and Southern Cal (1978-82) are the only other Irish oppo­nents to have accomplished that feat. 
If your memory is kind, you might re­member the good old days when Air Force was an annual patsy on Notre Dame's schedule and would quietly slip away to defeat. That happened the first I I times Notre Dame and Air Force played. 
No one team contrasts the recent Irish misfortunes on the football field than does Air Force. Where Notre Dame is slow, Air Force is quick. Where Notre Dame self­destructs, Air Force executes flawlessly. When Notre Dame fails to take advantage of its opponents' mistakes, Air Force is exceptionally opportunistic. 
Lou Holtz is familiar with Irish problems in his first matchup with the Falcons. 
"Looking ahead to Air Force is never a very pleasant thing," says Holtz. "The Air Force football team does all the little things the right way, is talented, and also plays with exceptional poise. (It) really does the things you have to do to win." 
Will the fact that the Irish haven't beaten the Falcons in four years be a motivating factor this Saturday? 

"I don't think I have to say an awful lot about that," answers Holtz. "The main thing we want to do is we just want to win. I'm tired of it. I know the players are tired of it. It's unbelieveable the way the players have hung in there over this thing. 
"We have a lot of respect for the Air Force team and they've beaten us the last four years, but they've also beaten us basically with the same things that have caused us to experience some failures this year. 
"Our players don't need to be reminded we've lost." 
Pat Evans. 
Air Force's offense vs. 
Notre Dame's defense 
Since Air Force has risen to national prominence, it's stuck to one style of of­fense -the wishbone. Air Force head coach Fisher DeBerry prefers to keep the ball on the ground, where the 5-1 Falcons have averaged 232 yards per game rush­ing compared to only 92.5 passing. The Falcons have piled up 28.8 points per game and are coming offofan Impressive 40-6 thumping of Navy. 
Directing the ground attack for Air Force will be junior quarterback Jim Totnallo (17-of-36 passing for 346 yards, two TDs, 
and three INTs). The 5-11, 176-pound Tomallo, who stepped in at quarterback after the lone Air Force loss against Wyoming, was inserted mainly for his ability to execute the option consistently. He has guided the Falcons to three straight wins. 
When Tomallo hands off, the ball will go to a host ofAir Force backs from the same "slow-but-gritty'' cookie cutter that has haunted the Irish In the last four meetings. Seniors Pat Evans (114 carries for 458 yds., five TDs) at fullback and Mark Munafo (72 for 348 yds., five TDs)

at left halfback lead the Falcon running game, but by no means can they be keyed on to stop the varied Falcon attack. Senior right halfbackJohnny Smith and his back­. up, sophomore Albert Booker, join Evans and Munafo in averaging over four yards 
per carry. 
Senior wide receiver Tyrone Jeffcoat (11 
catches for 211 yds., one TO) leads Fal­
con receiving corps, but look for Munafo 
(eight for I22 yds.) and Smith (six for 88 
yds.) to come out of the backfield In third 
down passing situations. 
On defense, the Irish will try to bounce back after allowing the Pitt offense to roll up 3I0 yards passing, I 00 yards over the Irish defense's average. However, they held Pitt to only 2.3 yards rushing and that should figure to be more important against the wishbone. 

"One of the problems you have with the wishbone is the more you know about it, the less chance you have to defend it, maybe," says Holtz, who has been known to use the wishbone on some of his op­ponents in the past. 
"You cannot defend the wishbone on the blackboard. You can only defend it with execution and your people whipping some people's blocks." 
Brandy Wells has joined Mike Haywood on the sidelines for the rest of the season, depleting the already-thin Irish defense. Defensive tackle JeffKunz suffered a con­cussion against Pitt and will probably not play much this week. Robert Banks, recovering from a hamstring pull he suf­fered against Alabama, should return to the line. 
That means the depth chart will come out to play for the Irish. Freshman Jeff Aim will be backing up Banks this week. joined by classmates Stan Smagala and PatTer­rell in the secondary. 
Notre Dame's offense vs. Air Force's defense 
When the gun sounded after last year's game against the Falcons, the verdict was that the Irish offense was the Falcon defense's star player. Certainly the self­destruct button was worn out by Notre Dame last year, but Air Force may have more than Notre Dame's bad luck on its side. It also has some good football players. 
Senior linebacker Terry Maki did it all last year, collecting 30 tackles (I9 of them solo) and blocking a field goal that turned into Air Force's winning touchdown. For his efforts, Sports Illustrated named the 6-3, 235-pound Maki defensive player of the week. 
"Maki is a young man that finds the foot­ball," says Holtz. "I think he's as good a linebacker as yu're going to find. 
"He givs them tremendous underneath coverage. It's very difficult to throw the football inside as well as Maki plays the football."

Other campus groups join in RASTA's cause 
Dear Editor: 
This is written in response to the Oct. 14 article on RASTA. 
The goals of RASTA are highly com­mendable: providing aid to starving people and promoting African culture. What is unfortunate is that former RASTA member Rafael Benavente doubts that other groups share these goals. Imagine that! Nonetheless, rumor has It that there is a group, on this very campus, with remarkably similar aims. The distin­guished organization of which I speak is none other than the Black Cultural Arts Council. If, after learning of this, Mr. Benavente still insists that the goals of other organizations can't possibly match "what we (RASTA) were after", then my question to him is: Just what were you after? 
May I ask a few more questions? When Sean Evers, also a former RASTA mem­ber, said that one of RASTA's goals was promoting African culture, was his use of the word "African" synonymous with or in any obscure way related to the wor.d "Black"? I thought sol I also think that It doesn't take a genius to figure out what the "B" in "B.C.A.C." stands for. 
RASTA's goal of aiding starving people has generated yet another rumor: Man does not live by bread alone. I, for one, wish that communication, understand­Ing. Integration and love for our fellow man were on the menu. I hunger for these "foods". And, So-and-so said that other students have similar craving. Will you look at all these rumors? 
If it is possible to feed my brothers and 
sisters who are thousands of miles away 
across ever-so-distant water, then surely 
It Is possible to "feed" those of us who 
are only a quad away! Enough said. 
Vivian Croswell President Black Cultural Arts Council 

Vatican was justified in carrying out threats 
Dear Editor: 
I have followed with interest all of the 
debate which has ensued after the 
Vatican's decision to strip Fr. Curran of 
his authority to teach theology. I under­
stand the basic point of conflict to center 
on Curran's denial of objectively immoral 
behavior. Instead, he opts for immanence 
of Intention in determining morality. This 
leads directly to situational morality, an 
Insidious and rationally bankrupt method 
to decide one's actions. 
While much of the debate concerning 
the dismissal of Fr. Curran has dealt with 
a university's right to academic integrity, 
this focus seems to completely Ignore the 
reason for the Vatican's actions. The 
Church had repeatedly warned Fr. Curran 
to suppress his own opinion when teach­
Ing with the authority of a catholic theo­
logian. He did not. He was silenced. 
People were outraged by the aut­
horitarianism exercised by the Vatican. I 
applaud it. Fr. Curran's views are ex­
tremely appealing. especially to someone 
such as myself who is constantly falling 
short of what could be considered Chris­
tian behavior (a fact to which people who 
know me will readily attest). The Church 
has the duty to define proper moral be­
havior in order to provide an option to 
behavior endorsed by a society which en­courages intellectual pride and selfish­ness. The Church provides standards of behavior which lead us to fulfillment of God's intended plan for every individual. Given the enormity of this responsibility it comes as no suprise that the Church will be forced to censure proponents of evil behavior.

ROTC trains to defend freedom and religion 
Dear Editor: 
The letter by Jay Dolan on Oct. 16 reveals a lack of understanding which seems to be common at Notre Dame. Dolan feels that the presence of a War Memorial and ROTC here is incongruous with our catholicism. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
Those men to whom the War Memorial 
Is dedicated gave their lives for our cat­
holicism. Unfortunately, others had to be 
killed in order to defend our faith and 
freedom of faith. 
As for ROTC, we should be proud that Notre Dame supports one of the largest programs in the country. These men and women are training to dedicate their lives to the preservation of freedom and cat­holicism. If not for these "catholic war­riors", the United States would probably be an atheistic, communistic country. 
It Is most unfortunate that men like 
Dolan are doomed to be kept free by bet­
ter men than themselves. 
David COndron Sophomore Air Force ROTC cadet 

Ordination of women may not be the answer 
Dear Editor: 
Chris Julka must do a little more homework before he wades into such emotional. controversial waters. It is true, there are no theological reasons prevent­ing the ordination of women to pries­thood, though the Vatican document In­ter insigniores (1976) hedges a bit on this point. drawing Its conclusions from the fact of unbroken tradition (a point which could be questioned in its own right) to the will of God for the Church. 
However, the document does draw at­
tention, albeit unintentionally, to the real 
issue at stake in this emotional debate. 
Simply admitting women to the mini­
sterial priesthood as it exists today would 
be an Impossibility, since the framework 
of meaning. mediated by symbol, on 
which the ministerial priesthood rests is 
overwhelmingly patriarchal. The Church 
is, unfortunately, a "man's Church" as 
Julka points out. but in ways far deeper 
than he realizes. And simply laying hands 
on women and calling them "priests" will 
not solve this problem, but will rather 
compound it. 
No, what Is truly called for is a re­examination of the very symbolic basis of Church and Order, something which is already underway In the work of people like Rosemary Ruether and other fine theologians. They realize, unlike those who would take a mere affective stance, what is really at stake here. Granted, this is a tough, uphill battle, especially since the current Roman regime believes that the issue is closed. But it is a battle worth fighting. for the end result will be a new understanding and new Church that will resemble even more closely the Kingdom of God.

Group must appreciate 
the culture it promotes 
I am writing in response to the "Banned Group Looking at Options" article that appeared in the Tuesday, October 14, 1986 issue ofThe Observer. In the article, former co-leader Sean Evers defined two goals of the organization. 
Esther Ivory 
guest column 
The first goal. to "aid starving people" is by far the most publicized goal of the organization. This purpose is even reflected in the name of the group, Rally Against Starvation (RASTA). The group is to be commended for undertaking this task. 
However, I have a problem with the second goal Evers mentioned: "promote the culture ofAfrica". Since when did this become a goal of Rally Against Star va­tion? Perhaps I may be mistaken, but this Is not what the group was known for, nor was It what Rally Against Starvation ac­tively promoted. 
To "aid starving people" Is a monumen­tal task In Itself. But It seems that Evers Is stretching the capabilities of Rally Against Starvation when he asserts that one of the goals Is also to "promote the culture of Africa". Don't misunderstand, I am not :saying that the two goals can't be achieved by an organization. But I am strongly opposed to the group's meth­ods, approach and perspective on the goal to "promote the culture of Africa". 
(Yes I am aware of the African Art Show which was sponsored by Rally Against Starvation last year. But the concept be­hind the Art Show seems unrelated to the other activities, which consisted mainly of fund raising.) 
Before I go any further, a clariflcation is necessary. What does It mean to "promote the culture of Africa"? As I in­terpret this, It means promoting the cul­ture of a grouptace of peple In Africa-­specifically Black Aflcan Culture. This is directly related to 2.35 students on campus who have Black African roots (myself included). Since the ancestors of these students assimilated into America, they are referred to in the United States as African-American, Afro-American or Black American. For simplicity's sake, to "promote the culture of Africa" is to promote Black American Culture. The two are so closely linked by ancestoral bonds, that they can not be separated. 
According to the article, "Evers said possible options include working through an existing campus group with compati­ble goals ... But former RASTA member Rafael Benavente said he doubted other groups could achieve the banned group's goals." Benavente was quoted as saying. "I don't think the goals of other groups could match what we were after." Are you sure about this? 

The article mentioned the Overseas De­velopment Network. I seems that their goals would be compatible with Rally Against Starvation's goal to "aid starving people". 
But what about the other goal, to "promote the culture of Africa". Though they were not mentioned In the article, there are established groups on campus with the same goal, namely, the Black Cultural Arts Council, Black Cultural Arts Festival and the Notre Dame Chapter of the National Association for the Advance­ment of Colored People (NAACP). To my knowledge, the members and leaders of these organizations are unaware that Rally Against Starvation has also decided to "promote the culture of Africa". 
I am not opposed to Rally Against Starvation asserting this as a goal. But do to the nature and composition of Rally Against Starvation , it seems essential for the group to have some communication, association andlor cooperation with the established groups on campus who promote black culture. 
The bottom line is this: no one knows 
more about African culture than one of African heritage. If I am not mistaken, Rally Against Starvation has no members who tit this description. This concerns me because Rally Against Starvation is at­tempting to promote a culture which its member do not truly understand. How can the group present an accurate view of African culture without some knowl­edge of what it is promoting? 
Thus, the vital question: Is Rally Against Starvation promoting "the culture of Africa" or is It promoting what it THINKS is "the culture of Africa". 
Do not misinterpret this as a black and white racial question. That is not the issue. I merely want to call attention to the Rally Against Starvation's perspective, methods and approach to the proclaimed goal to "promote the culture of Africa". 1 urge the members to carefully consider the implications of the group's assertion. 
Esther Ivory is a senior Oovemmen&CAPP mqjor and Chairperson of the Black Cul­tural Arts Festival

Notre Dame powers past Tri-State behind the 'smorgasbord lineup' 
By STEVE MEGARGEE 
Sports Writer 
Playing its first game in almost two weeks after three ralnouts, the Notre Dame baseball team defeated Tri-State, 9-5, Friday to raise Its fall record to 4-1. 
The Irish spotted Tri-State an early lead on a three-run homer offstarterJohn Dimpet then tied the score In the home half of the first inning behind Chris Flynn's home run. Flynn's blast scored Pat Pesavento and Scott Rogers. 
"I think the guys may have been taking Tri-State a little light­ly, but after they hit the three-run homer, our guys realized they couldn't just throw their gloves out there to. win," said Head Coach Larry Gallo. 

Dimpel settled down and al­lowed no more runs in the next two Innings. He was relieved by the two freshman phenoms, Brian Piotrowlcz and Mike Coffey. Piotrowicz allowed one earned run over four innings to record the win, and Coffey gave up one unearned run In three Innings. 
Notre Dame took the lead for good In the second Inning with an RBI double by Pesavento and an RBI single by Rogers to make the score 5-3. 
The Irish broke open a close 5-4 game in the seventh Inning. Notre Dame scored four runs be· hind stolen bases by catchers Pat O'Brien and Craig Pavlina, and run-scoring hits by Gary Leonard, Jerry Reddy, and Casey Moore. 
Because Notre Dame had not played for so long. the game went ten Innings .to get more players in the game. Over 20 players saw action for the Irish. 
"We played so many people it was like a scrimmage," said Oal­lo. "We got to use a lotofyounger players and a lot of different combinations. We used a smor­gasbord lineup." 
Notre Dame continues its fall season with a Blue-Gold in­trasquad game at 3 p.m. Friday at Jake Kline Field.

performances have been, as Gar­rett puts It, "up to par". 
Co-captain Rick Mulvey says of Dan, "He has made a remarkable comeback from his Injury and Is Improving every week. In prac­tice, Dan sets the pace for the group and we follow." 
This confident team attitude will be needed today against In­diana University, one of the top teams In the division. A win today for the Irish could bejust the con­fidence booster needed for next week's meet with Houston and Rice. 
"Indiana University has a good team," said Plane, "and It would be great to place three men in the top ten. Of the six conslstant runners, the top three will prob­ably be Dan, Mike and Ron. Colds and 111Juries are taking their toll. Only now is the team getting healthy." 

Plane also believes that the team will have their hands full next week against Rice. Along with Rice, ranked in the top five In the nation, the Irish will be running against a strong Hous­ton squad. 
"The boys like to compete," said Plane. "All they need to do Is learn to run well as a team and this needs to start today."

Open 8-8 Mon-Fri 8·4 Saturday 
By KEVIN McCORMACK Sports Writer 
The Interhall football regular season wound down to Its con­clusion the past two days at Car­tier Field, with several teams up­setting and spoiling the playoff hopes of others. 
In the Leahy division, the game of the week was Zahm against Holy Cross because the winner would be in the playoffs. After It was all said and done, the Zahmbles defeated the Hogs In a thriller 10-6. 
The Hogs had the ball first. but were stopped by a hungry Zahm defense. As soon as Zahm got the ball, they drove down the field with a mixed selection of 




Academies 
continuedfrom page 16 
So while they might not be as 
dominant as they once were, the 
Academies are at least competi­
tive. And, they have gotten back 
to that level intelligently. 
Realizing that they can't com­
pete against the behemoths at 
most schools, Air Force and 
Army went to the wishbone. In-play calling. culminating in a .35­yard run After Zahm scored on its first possession, the rest of the first half was a defensive struggle and ended In a 7-0 Zahmbie lead. 
The Hogs came out firing and drove down to Zahm's five to begirt the second half, until a fumble ended the Holy Cross threat. 
Holy Cross pulled to within one, late In the third quarter on a 1 0-yard around the end play for a touchdown, but missed the extra point. 
A 42-yard field goal by Andy Richardson set the stage for Holy Cross' last opportunity to win. 
The Hogs drove down the field 
stead of having its linemen utilize straight-ahead blocking 
schemes,  the  wishbone's  
linemen  merely  help  the  
defender  go  the direction  he  

wants to go. Then the quarter­back adjusts accordingly. It's a system that's worked quite well for the undersized academies, as the Irish can attest. 
But what about Navy? They don't use the wishbone. No, they use the I. Of course, the Midship­men had Napoleon McCallum, one of the premier runners in college football history. He was good enough to set the NCAA record for most all-purpose yards without the trickery of the 'bone. 
Which brings up another point. 

again, but were constantly being pressured by the Zahm defense which got a key sack on the drive. Time then ran out with the Hogs on the Zahm 5-yard line, ending In heartbreak for Holy Cross and jubilation for the Zahmbies. 
In other Leahy action, Pangborn beat Cavanaugh 14-0 and Stanford crushed hapless Alumni, 17-0. 
In the Rockne division, Sarin was surprised by Carroll in a 0-0 tie by the Vermin, while Fisher defeated St. Ed's 12-0. 
In the Parseghian division, Grace tied Off-Campus 0-0 while the Manorltes of Morrissey handed Flanner Its second loss of the season 1.'3-0. 
The Navy relaxed its rules on ob­ligation In McCallum's case, al­lowing him to play for the Los Angeles Raiders, where he's now tilling In for the Injured Marcus Allen. If the other services follow the Navy's lead, look for a few more of the so-called "blue­chippers" to head for West Point, Annapolis or Colorado Springs. That's If they can handle the 4 
a.m to 8:.30 p.m. daily schedule of McCallum. 
But In the meantime, the games for the Commander-In­Chief's trophy are now more than just a chance for military men to bet on and and earn bragging rights. They've actually become pretty good ball games.

Women's football playoffs are set 
By KATHY BERRY 
Sports Writer 

The final four in the Women's Interhall Football playoffs were decided Tuesday night as Breen­Phillips subdued Lyons, 26-6, and Pasquerllla East shut out Pasquerilla West, 14-0. This sets up a rematch of last year's over­time semi-final between eventual-champion Farley and Lyons. B.P. and P.E., both with records of 6-1, are pitted against each other In the other semi-final match. 
Flags were difficult to grab and passes fell short as temperatures dropped in the thirties Tuesday night. The run was quite effective and that's what B.P. used for three of its four touchdowns against Lyons. B. P:'s Margaret Johnson ran five yards for the first touchdown ofthe game. B. P. failed on the two point conver­sion and it was 6-0. 
Lyons was penalized byseveral tackling calls which stopped them in the first half. Right before the half Lyons quarter­back Mary Bohmer was knocked to the ground as she tried to get a pass off. It fell short and into the hands of Karen Marsh who ran it back for a sixty-five yard touchdown. Mary was out for the rest of the game and it was B. P. up by twelve. 
In the second half with Karen Lynch at quarterback for Lyons, tailback Robin McHugh ran forty yards for its first score. B. P. came back and clinched the win with a thirty-yard touchdown run by caroline Burke and a scoring pass play to Amy Tweder. B.P. made one two-point conversion to win by the score of 26-6. 
"I think that was their most well-played game so far," said Danny Deboer, B.P.'s coach. "I think we're peaking now and we're ready for the playoffs." 
In the war of the Pasquerillas, P.E.'s Packers scored on their first possession on a pass from Colleen Donnally to Colleen O'Conner. P. W's Kathy Moran broke up the conversion attempt to make it 6-0. P. W.'s "Plaid Wave" had two chances to score in the first half as It drove down to the fifteen and the twenty, but it couldn't put anything Into the endzone.. 
In the second hair. P. E.'s Annie Shrenk intercepted P.W. 's pass to put them on the forty-yard line. On fourth down and twelve, Col­leen Donnally connected with Mia Faust for a thirty-yard touch­down. With the two-point conver­sion, P.E. crushed P.W.'s hopes for a playoff berth. 
''I'm happy with the way they've played this season," P. E.'s coach Jeff Morgan said about his players. "I think they showed a lot of poise in their games 
against Farley  and  Lewis.  I'm  
looking  forward  to  good  
playoffs."

ND soccer has a tough task ahead 
By PETE GEGEN Assistant Sports Editor 

The Notre Dame soccer team leaves today on what Is perhaps Its most critical series of games In Its history. 
Sunday, the Irish will face Con­necticut at Storrs, Conn. Though the Huskies have just recently fal­len out of the Top-20, they are always tough In their home stadium. 
Next Friday the team will face Penn State at Unlverslty1'ark. Pa. A noted "tournament team," the Nittany Lions also have just fallen from the Top-20, largely because of their 1-0 loss to Akron. 
These two games will be an excellent test for the 9-5-1 Irish, who have not played a game since last week's tie against Ak­ron. Head Coach Dennis Grace believes the rest has made his team hungry to play. 
"The people came back (from a three-day break) ready to play," says Grace. "I liken It to pre­season -they are In that kind of shape." 
Even more Importantly, the fu­ture of the program could be af­fected by the team's play next week. five recruits plan to attend these games, and a strong showing by Notre Dame would give Grace more leverage in recruiting. 
Notre Dame needs continued offensive production from Bruce McCourt (13 goals, 6 assists), Randy Morris (5 goals, 8 assists), and Joe Sternberg (8 goals, 3 assists). The defense may experi­ment with a double-stopper alignment, recently installed to allow both John Guignon and Pat 
McClanahan a chance to play in the middle. 
Even with victories, the Irish chances of post-season play are just about nil because of four losses In their own region. 
"I wish It could have been this year," says Morris. ''But nowwere playing for next year and the year after that." 
IRISH ITEMS -Co-captain Steve Lowney is expected to play after suffering a strained knee In the Akron contest ... Also returning from Injuries are co-captain Jim flynn and keeper Kevin

Irish continue difficult road trip 
By RICK RIETBROCK Sports Writer 

October break will not feature much of a respite for the Notre Dame volleyball team as It takes on some tough opposition on the road. 
The team Is off to its best start in history, 14-5, and already has started the road trip with two wins in three tries. 
Head Coach Art Lambert says he is hoping this trip will be a step toward Improving Notre Dame's reputation. 
"The Ohio State game is pivo­tal for us to gain credibility," he says. "They are ranked in the top 10 in our region." 
After Ohio State, the Irish will take on Georgetown, Duke, North Carolina State and Vir­ginia. 

The Irish coach says he would have been happy to know he would be 14-5 at this stage If asked at the beginning of the year, but he thinks the record could have been even better. 
"I had hoped to be where we are," he says. "But we could be even better. We've made some critical mistakes at crucial times, or we'd be better. 
"This team Is starting to realize just how good they can be. 
"I feel good about the team because of the effort," he con­tinues. "It's a far different, far better team than last year." 
Lambert emphasizes that the second half of the schedule is tougher than the first, but he remains optimistic. 
"This Js a very difficult road swing, but we are capable of beating every team. This Is the kind of trip where a team develops, with back-to-back games against hard-nosed op­ponents."

The path of football at the Academies 
The Air force Is coming, the Air force Is coming. for the Irish, that really does mean war. By now, no one 
needs to be reminded of four year's worth of the Irish follies 
against Air force, four years of being beaten by by a flock 
of falcons that refuses to fly. 
But Air force's success of late is part of a larger picture, 
the rebirth of Academy football. 
In days gone by, the service academies, especially Army 
and Navy, were football powers. In 1913, for example, Notre 
Dame was a small unknown which went east to play mighty 
Army. Instead, the Irish, led by the passing combination of 
Gus Dorlas to Knute Rockne, whipped the Cadets, 35-13. And 
no one forgets the now famous 0-0 tie In 1946. 
Dennis Corrigan 
Sports Editor 


Army continued to be a power until into the 1950's, winning back-to-back national titles In 1944 and 1945. In 1945, Mr. Inside, felix "Doc" Blanchard won the Helsmann Trophy, and Mr. Outside, Glenn Davis won It the following year. 
But after 1958, the year Pete Dawkins won the Helsmann, Army retreated from the national scene. 
The Naval Academy story Is much the same. While never as strong as Army, the Midshipmen did finish second to the Cadets In 1945 and in, the year a soon-to-be ensign named Roger Staubach walked away with the Helsmann, Navy lost to Texas, 28-6, In the Cotton Bowl, thereby finishing second In the race for the national championship. But then Navy sunk from the polls and national prominence. 
The Air force Academy has a slightly different story. The falcons didn't take wing until the 1956 season but just two years later, they were 9-0-2 and In the Cotton Bowl earning a 0-0 tie with TCU and a number-six ranking. The falcons appeared In the Gator Bowl In 1963 and the Sugar Bowl In 1970. But then Air force dove from prominence. 
The Academies lay dormant for most of the Seventies. Vietnam and the the anti-military sentiment which followed contributed to this as well as the recruiting difficulties that are unique to the Academies. It's hard to sell the average high school all-American to come to one of the academies, play ball and then spend four years in the service when a lot of high school athletes are thinking college then pros. 
But starting In 1978, something happened. The service academies became competitive again. That year, George Welsh and his Midshipmen finished 8-3 and beat BYU In the Holiday Bo"-'1. Navy went to two more bowls in 1980 and 1981, losing both. The Middies had a top-quality running back in Eddie Meyers and now haye Chuck Smith, one of the leading rushers in the nation this season. But since that 1981 season, the Naval Academy hasn't been too successful but In 1982, the Air force landed. 
That year, the falcons made their first of four appearances in post-season play, beating Vanderbilt in the Hall of fame Bowl, 36-28. The falcons next made consecutive successful appearances in the Independence Bowl before beating Texas in last year's Bluebonnet Bowl. Those four wins made them only the second team to win four consecutive bowl games (UCLA is the other). 
Playing Air force with its "flexbone" is no longer the breat­her on anyone's season. 
Army, too, has a post-season winning streak of its own. After years oflosing, the Cadets made It to the nowdecertified Cherry Bowl, where they edged Michigan State, 10-6. It was the first bowl game In Army's long history. Last season, Army finished second In the nation In rushing with its own version of the wishbone and-again going top a bowl. This time, the Cadets downed Illinois, 31.·29, In the Peach Bowl.
