Cotntnittee discusses ideal qualities for new-provost 

By TERESA FRALISH News Writer 

Provost search eommittee members heard comments and .suggestions from professors about the kind of administra­tor needed to replace outgoing Provost Nathan llateh as Notre Dame's chief academic officer at Faculty Senate's Tuesday meeting. 
Search committee chair and University President-elect Father John Jenkins told sena­tors he had begun eollecting names of potential candidates and would share them with the full search committee soon. The search for a new provost was prompted by Hatch's deci­
sion to depart Notre Dame .July 1 to assume the position of president at Wake Forest. 
Student affairs committee chair Jay Brandenberger sug­gested the University might strongly consider female can­didates, becauso much of the University's aeademic leador­ship is male, he said. 
"Most of the deans are male and the president is male ­maybe there's a bit of extra energy to look for a female candidate," he said. 
Faculty comnwnts on a new provost varied widely from remarks on candidates' aea­demic backgrounds to mana­gerial qualities, with several senators suggesting that the new provost possess a back-

Priests, faculty debate whether Pope should resign franz position

As l'opn .John Paul II reeovnrs from mnnrgency surgery in a hospital in Home, tho world is wondering how much longer his 27-year papacy will last. At Notre Damn, prit~sts have nxprnsst~d conr.Prn for the popn and a nmssuring faith that God will provide. 
Fatlwr Paul Doyle, rnctor of Dillon lfall. admitted that the pope's situation is eomplicatml, and that hoth sides -those that lwlinve the S4-year-old pontiff should step down, and those convinced he should serve until his death -are legitimate. 

In a nation where the eldorly arn ol'tnn separatnd from socie­ty in nursing homes and assist­ed living facilities, Doyle notnd the importance of allowing an aged pope to eontinue in his position and remain leader of the Church. 
"When someone like the popi1 is allowed to remain at eentPr stagt'l for so long, it is a commentary on how quickly tho rest of us shun the elderly to tho margins," Doyle said. 
Still, he noted, if age croatos a snvore hindrance on tho popn's ability to fullill his role, tlwn resignation should be con­sidered. 
"I tnnd to think it might be good at some point for a pope to bneome emnritus, so to speak, so someone morn vigor­ous health-wise can lead tho llock," Doyle said.

INSIDE COLUMN 


Secret lovers 

So while sitting down to write this column, a strange song began to play on my playlist. I started jamming to Atlantic Starr's "Secret Lovers." I listened to the lyrics and wondered about secret Lukas Mendoza 
lovers. 
What does it really mean? photographer And I don't want to get into that dirty connotation that secret lovers mean someone is cheating on someone else. No no, that's not what I'm going for. No one is cheating on anyone. Well, at least we hope not. Right? 
Anyway, secret lovers are those who don't want anyone to know 
what is going on. Sure there are a few people who have to know some things. 
People like your roommates. Its hard to sneak around without them finding out. You live with them, they pretty much have to know everything about you. 
So besides roommates, no one knows what is going on with two people. Maybe your parents, because they like to know that kind of stuff too. But they are a good leak, no one will know. We 
can only hope. 
So why be secret lovers? You don't want people to know because you might face opposition from dif­ferent forces. Friends of your 
secret love may not like you and wouldn't approve. The ex-es may find out and come looking for you, and it won't be to congratulate you. 
Others may feel only they are good enough for your secret love, so if they find out anything you hurt that friendship. Many factors go into it. 
The positives of it: people won't know and you won't lose friends. In the long run, people can become accustomed to your relationship and then you can spring it on them. 
The exchange: Yeah, we are dat­ing. What? How long? Oh, for about 5 months now. No way! See, it becomes easy. You also don't have to worry about what other people will say. Besides, who really wants to hear what this person should or should not be doing. Hight? Their business is 
just that, their business. 
A few negatives too: certain situ­ations can arose suspicions. Parties, outings or anything that involves beverages and the two secret lovers together. Not a good mix, and it may be necessary to come with a chaperone. Someone who knows something but not the whole thing to make sure nothing happens between the two lovers. 
So secret lovers may be good or not, but it is up to you to decide if you want it or not.

N!Htrly all of tlw Notre Dame sophomores recnntly accepted to orw of the numerous study abroad programs ofl'en~d by the Univnrsity sdzed their opportuni­ty and confirrnnd they will enroll to study intnrnationally next year.

Sophomore Miehanl Freneh is currently is such a situation. Freneh applied for the Notre Dame pro~-,rram in Toledo, Spain, but was dnnind. lie is now trying to find other ways to get to Spain, but is having trouble with the technkalitios. 
"To go through another univer­sity's program you need a leave of absence, and they only have 16 loaves for the whole school," Freneh said. "Plus, if someone wants to go for a full year, that takes up two lr.aves of absence. Tlwre just arnn 't nnough." 
llnalso said that he was trying to aequirn a leave of absence as opposed to going through Saint Mary's because he would rather go to Tolodo than to Seville, where the womnn's eollegc main­tains its program. If he eannot get a lr.avo of absnncc, however, he 
Bogenschild had further advice for those studenl'i who arcn't so specific on where they wish to study. 
"There are slots still in Tokyo; you don't even have to speak Japanese and you can spend a semester in Tokyo," Bogenschild said. 
But Tokyo is just one exampln. Many programs have extended their applieation deadlines lor the 2006 spring semester abroad to May 1. These include Athens, Beijing, Berlin, Cairo, Monterrey and Puebla, Mexico, Hio de Janeiro, Santiago, Chile and Shanghai. 
Bogensehild said the extension was not at all unusual.

First socialist leader sworn in 
President-elect Vazquez promises to help the poor rebound from 2002 depression 
Associated Press 
MONTEVIDEO -A doe­tor took oflicn as Uruguay's first socialist president Tuesday, joining tho ranks of left-loaning leaders in Latin America, now six in all. governing a lll<\jority of the region's people with a cautious approach to U.S.­backed free-market poli­cies. 
In one of his first ollieial aets, Tabare Vazquez n~storcd full diplomatic tins with communist Cuba, mor~ than two years aller a diplomatic row divided the countries. 
Thousands of Urugu­ayans, many waving flags and chanting "Ur-u-guay!" filled Montevideo's streets for the inauguration of Vazquez, a 65-ynar-old can­cor specialist whoso swear­ing-in ended more than 170 years of power by two mod­erate parties. 
Vazquez, elected Oct. 31 to replace Jorge Batlle, is part of a reinvorgorated, but far less ideological, left­ist movement in Latin America whoso leaders have come to power amid economie turmoil. lin took the oath of office for his five-year term with many of' South America's new gen­eration of leftists leaders looking on. 
"I have not come alone," Vazquez said at the packed ceremony at Congress. "I take office as president of' the republic with the sup­port of hundreds of thou­sands of compatriots who expressed their democratic wishes last Oct. 31 for a better country for all Uruguayans." 
Brazil's Luiz lnaeio Lula da Silva, Argentina's Nestor Kirchner and Chile's Hicardo Lagos all looked on as the crowd cheered. 
Vazquez climbed into an antique ear to leave thn eeremony, then jumped onto the bark of a pickup truck, blowing kisses to a erowd of' thousands who turned out for a strnnt lies­ta. 

AP Celebration in the streets of Montevideo, Uruguay, Tuesday was In honor of Tabare Vazquez's inauguration. Vazquez is the country's first socialist leader. 
Confetti flew and occa­sional fireworks boomed overhead as his motorcade slowly made its way to the presidential offices. 
Blue-and-white Uru­guayan flags emblazoned with their signature sun in the upper left corner hung from the balconies of' many apartment buildings, where people craned to get a glimpsn of their nnw leader. 
Carpenter llugo Folena, 40, waved the red-white­and-blue flag of Vazquez's Broad Front coalition and smiled as he talked of his hopes for tlw new presi­dent. 
''I'm praying this means we will nventually have a better Uruguay," he said. "One whnre thorn is better public health, better public education and work oppor­tunities fi>r everyone." 
Uruguay, long one of Latin America's most stable economies, is dirnbing out of a 2002 depression in which the economy shrank by 11 percent. 
The upheaval loft ono of every three Uruguayans below the poverty line _ a blow to a country where generous soeial benefits had for years assured one of the region's highest living standards. 
Vazquez's victory brokn a long-running hold on power by the Colorado and National parties, which alternately controlled tho prnsidm1ey for morn than 170 years. Their dominanee was interrupted occasional­ly by military rule, most recently during tlw coun­try's 1973-M dietatorship. 
During tho campaign, Vazquez pledged to lwlp tlw poor, and his message rns­onatod with voters incrnas­ingly skeptical of frnn-mar­knt policies being touted by Washington as tlw renwdy for the region's nconom ie ills. 
While Vazquez has vowed to pursue modoratn poli­eies, he has promised to strcmgthnn the country's tins with neighbors Argentina and Brazil. 
Over tlw last dnradn, many South Anw rican c~ountrins adopted fren­marknt reforms, opening their nconomies and priva­tizing state~ industl'ins, only to sen their economies slow to a grind. 



Identity theft investigations costly

SACHAMENTO. Calif. -Law enforcenwnt officials attnnding tlw state's first summit on idnntity tlwft asked Monday for morn money to combat the erime in California, the only statn believed to have more than 
I million vktims last ynar. 

Authoritins sought assistanen from politicians, businesses and consumer advocates in their qunst to prevent identity tlwl't and crack down on thieves. 
"Thern's no way we in law nnforce­mnnt ean do it alone," said Jan Scully, Sacramento County distric:t attornny. 
ShnrifTs, legislators, postal workers and eonsumer watchdogs want to inernase funding for prosncutors and for five siatn task l'orcns dedicated to idnntity theft. Current funding is about $12.4 million per year. 
Only about 11 percent of eases statnwide are solved, Scully said. 
For example, the Los Angnlns County Shcwil'f Departmnnt had more than 20.000 identity theft eases last year. said .Jonathan Fairtlough, a c~ounty prosneutor. Tlw county prose­cuted only about 220 casos. hn said.

Serial killer charged with murdering ten 
Former scout leader attends hearing via video 
Associated Press 
WICIIITA, Kan. -Dennis Rader, the churchgoing family man and Cub Scout leader accused of leading a double life as the BTK serial killer, was charged Tuesday with 1 0 counts of first-degme murder. 
Hader made his first court appearance by videoconference from his jail cell. During the brief hearing, Hader stood behind a podium, his hands folded at times, at others leafing through a copy of the charges against him. He told the judge he is married and was employed with the city of Park City, and said "Thank you, sir" at the end of the hearing. 
About a dozen family mem­bers of victims were in the courtroom, but they did not speak to reporters. Rader was accompanied by a temporary attorney, and the judge appoint­ed the state's public defender office to represent him. 
The BTK killer, whose nick­name stands for "Bind, Torture, Kill," was suspected of eight deaths beginning in 197 4, but authorities said they had linked two additional victims to the serial killer. 
It appears unlikely Rader will face the death penalty. He has yet to be charged with a slaying that occurred after 1994, when Kansas passed its capital pun­ishment law. Additionally, the Kansas Supreme Court ruled that law unconstitutional in December over a provision on how juries weigh evidence for and against execution. 
Authorities have declined to say what led them to the 59­year-old Rader, a married father of two, scout leader and active member of a Lutheran church. 
However, there were indica­tions a computer disk BTK sent to the television station KSAS provided a key piece of evi­dence that led police to Rader. 
Scott Hobertson. an assign­ment editor for the station that produces KSAS' news broad­cast, told The Associated Press a package the station received Feb. 16 contained the disk as well jewelry that may have been from one of the victims. 

Pastor Michael Clark of Christ Lutheran Church -Rader's church -also said police asked him for a list of people who had access to the church computer. On Friday, he provided 10 or 15 names, including Hader's, he said. 
Rader has asked for Clark to visit him in jail, but he hasn't been able to arrange a meeting, the pastor said. 
Meanwhile, investigators with the Sedgwick County Sheriff's Office spent another day using metal detectors along a road in Park City. Sheriff Gary Steed said they are looking for evi­dence connected to new infor­mation developed by the task force investigating the BTK killings. He declined to specify the information. 
New details of the investiga­tion also emerged from Michigan. The Wichita Eagle and The Daily Oakland Press of Pontiac, Mich., reported Tuesday that FBI agents had visited the Farmington, Mich., home of Rader's 26-year-old daughter, Kerri, on Friday to get a DNA sample. 
The timing indicated she was not visited until after her father had been arrested that same day in Kansas, the Eagle said, suggesting her DNA helped con­firm his identity but was not the original break in the case as some initial reports had sug­gested. 
Charles Nebus, police chief in Farmington, said the FBI told him they were conducting an interview Friday in the city in connection with the BTK case. Nebus told The Associated Press that he didn't tell the newspapers a DNA test was being conducted. 
Jeff Hader told The Wichita Eagle that no one in the family believes his older brother is the BTK serial killer.

HAITI 

Police pressured to regain trust 
Haitians fed up with brutality, fear violence of local authorities 
Associated Press 
PORT-AU-PHINCE -Out­gunned, undermanned and blamed for some of the coun­try's violence, Haitian police are under pressure to mend decades of mistrust before elections next fall that many people fear are destined for bloodshed. 
The United States and United Nations have repeat­edly tried and failed to build an evenhanded police force over the years, and offered help again last year after rebels ousted President Jean­Bertrand Aristide during a three-week revolt. 
But Haitians, who have seen a string of governments use the police as brutal enforcers, say officers still operate above the law, tar­geting opponents and using trigger-happy tactics. Violence has come in waves since September, with some 400 civilians and 25 police slain, according to the National Coalition for Haitian Rights and an Associated Press count. 
On Monday, five officers trying to block unarmed pro­testers escorted by U.N. peacekeepers fired tear gas, then bullets, into a crowd of hundreds. When the shooting ended, two men lay dead in the street. "Police could have hit us by shooting that way," a Brazilian peacekeeper com­plained. 
This time the victims were Aristide supporters marking the first anniversary of his flight .from Haiti with demands that he return from exile in South Africa. 
A little more than a year ago, police were shooting at demonstrators calling for Aristide's downfall. Former soldiers responded by lead­ing a revolt that ousted Aristide and left dozens of policemen dead or mutilated. Many officers abandoned 37,000 officers. 

Haitian police are also out­gunned. The officers, armed with new M-16 rifles, sawed­off shotguns and pistols, must patrol slums filled with Aristide supporters who often have better weapons that were looted during the upris­ing. 
Despite numerous tele­phone calls and a visit to the police headquarters over more than a week, The Associated

The U.S.-backed interim government fired 200 corrupt or inexperienced officers. But the annual U.S. human rights report released Tuesday said some of the remaining Haitian officers "were impli­cated in corruption, kidnap­ping and narcotics traffick­ing" and "committed human rights abuses" in 2004. 
Dan Moskaluk, a spokesman for the U.N. train­ing and support mission run by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, said there are only 2,000 to 3,000 offi­cers in Haiti, an impover­ished nation of 8 million peo­ple plagued by lawlessness. By contrast, New York, a city with a similar population but with far less crime, has about

Lt. Gen.

Hesidents said police fired indiscriminately while peace­keepers stood by. Ileleno said no U.N. forces were involved in the raid.

One of my favorite poems, "Incident" by Countee Cullen, charac­terizes the personal pains of racism for receivers of oppression. In the piece, the protagonist-a small eight-year-old black Kamaria bo~ -encounte~s ~ Porter 
white youth of simi­lar age on a Love in the Baltimore street. The Ruins white youth calls our protagonist the most pejorative term used against blacks without provoca­tion or discernable reason. Most potently, this brief poem ends with the speaker reflecting on the interaction: "I saw the whole of Baltimore, from May to December, of all the things that happened there, that's all that I remember." As Cullen expresses in verse, a single incident of racial oppression has the ability to over­shadow a person's perception of the world and of himself. 
The powerlessness felt by targets of any type of prejudice is debilitating and staggering. Language is crucial in this discussion. Our tone, manner and voice all communicate stereotypes and prejudice. Further, certain words -like the pejorative "n-word" from Cullen's poem -carry centuries of oppressive, violent and destructive baggage. I would like to consider the effect of these words on people of the oppressed groups. People who utter these discriminatory words have vari­ous motives, yet their use, whether maliciously or inadvertently, often results in degradation of the oppressed group. We lack, in the broader discourse of prejudice, a way to deconstruct systems of oppression through language, as well as a process of addressing the real feelings of dehumanization. The private pain of the oppressed is sacrificed and silenced as society endeavors to make racism, sexism and heterosexism unimportant and invisible through political correctness or ignorance. 
I have heard many stories of Notre Dame students suffering this private pain of prejudice. While some would have us believe we are beyond the days of racial subjugation, people still find themselves in isolated situations due to derogatory words. In my expe­rience, two of my worst days here have been a result of such language usc. As a sophomore, someone from my residence staff flippantly insinuat­ed I thought myself light enough to "pass" for white. As a light-skinned black person, passing and racial iden­tity have played big parts in my devel­opment. During that incident in my dorm, I felt betrayed by Notre Dame's promises of family and isolated in my feelings of outrage. 
The second time was in a classroom this sehool year. A fellow student used a racially pejorative word to illustrate her point. While the student's inten­tions were not malicious, the effect of hearing the word in class outside of the context of an explicitly race-relat­ed conversation was jarring. My peer's unwitting utterance of the "n­word" illuminated the feelings of exclusion and discrimination I and other minorities feel in small doses sometimes daily. Being the only black, Latino or Asian in a class, being expected to speak or represent your race during class leetures, never see­ing religious icons reflecting your eth­nic heritage and being assumed to be an athlete based on skin color all weigh on the hearts and minds of minorities. 
We must not underestimate the abii­ity of language to exert the forces of domination and hate on others. As reflected in the "Laramie Project," whenever someone calls another a derogatory name, that is a violent act. That comment, in the context of a play about the murder of a young gay man, gives us pause. When we recog­nize language as a tool to exert pain on others, we have a frame through which to evaluate our actions and their consequences. Seeking reconcili­ation when we harm others with words repairs a relationship and opens a place for discussion and growth. To further ignore our mishaps in speech adds to the violence of our words. 
We look to a day, as a goal, when these words and their speakers no longer have the power to disrupt peo­ple's lives. Until then, what can we do to have constructive discussions of modern prejudice with the words of hate'? Perhaps discussing the origins and uses of' these words to. under­stand their eontinued effect, agreeing on parameters for discussion that uphold everyone's dignity while still encouraging controversial ideas and responding to insecurity as the discus­sion progresses may be helpful foun­dational rules. We can create in our communities and in ourselves spaces in which matters of race, sex or sexu­al orientation can be discussed con­structively and non-violently. I charge all of us, as our student leaders look for systemic answers to group divides, to be proactive vessels of the change we need at Notre Dame. Through our deeds and our words we either do the work of love and inclusion, or of hate and violence towards others.

Calling all pilgrims 
Think ahead, if you can, to tlw summer. What. an~ you planning to do with your­sell'! 
It's hard to pieturn .July right now in a place like South Bond, wlwrn March comes in like a lion. and gons out like a f'prorious lio.n that spits Greg snow and wmd at you Ruehlmann and trios to ~~at you. But tlw truth is, sum-FailhPoint nwr is rwaring, and now is tlw time to start making dwiees about how to spend it. 
hn· seniors. surnJJHH' likPiy holds the last gasp or rn~ndom. tho start of a nnw job, tlw hunt for a nnw job or a combina­tion thPrnof'. But what about you under­r.lassnwn'! Some pnopln takn tho nasy road-tlwy find a SLJJnnwr job and try to earn some ntsh belim~ sdwol starts up again, tlwy·ovnrdosn on Halo 2, they "take it easy." 
I'm not trying to suggnst taking it easy is wrong. We call it sumnwr vacation for a n~ason. But vacation donsn't entail for­getting our obligations. For Catholks, this moans we don't implement a seloe­tivn Mass attf'ndance policy. Wn don't susp1md our eommitnwnt to snrviee. In other words. thorn is a dill'ernnce bntwenn "taking it easy"-a natural dnsirn whnn we don't havn homnwork­and "taking the summer oil'." Taking the summnr oil' is exactly what we shouldn't do. 
lnstnad, we arc called to take our faith seriously while we take it easy. Countless people at Notre Dame answnr this call brilliantly. They do summer servieP proj­ects through the Center for Social Concerns domestically and abroad. They work in programs like Camp Kcsem, Notrn Dame Vision and National Youth Sports Program. And many others, evon as they opt for jobs and llalo 2, incorpo­rate rngular servico work and worship as well. 
I encourage ovnryonc to follow suit. MakP a visit to tho Center for Soda) Concerns and find out what you can do. Seek out a parish. Talk to people who serve in the places you'lllive while school's out. There are so many opportu­nities to live out tho gospel during tho months of' summer. And I'd like to sug­gest one more. 
I low about being pilgrims? 
"Pilgrims?" you ask. "We haven't boon pilgrims sincP the second grade Thanksgiving pageant at Our Lady of the Jloly, lloly, lloly, lloly Hosary! And those pilgrim hats don't lit anymore." 
Tho pilgrims I'm talking about don't np,cd big paper hats ... although that would be pretty enol if you wore them anyways. For most Americans, pilgrims merely call to mind turkeys and cos­tumes. But our faith has a rich and won­drous tradition of pilgrimage. Believers throughout the ages have traveled to holy places to pay their respects­Canterbury, Santiago de Compostella, Lourdes, Horne and Jerusalem. They journey to sil<~s of signilicance, whero saints have lived and martyrs have fall­en, where God appearnd and Jesus walked·. 
The journey occurs on two love Is. On the extnrior, pilgrims physically move togetlwr towards their destination. But tho interior pilgrimage is more impor­tant. In it, the pilgrims sojourn through relloction; they explore themselves beforo moving outside to Pncountor together the Lord who croatns and con­trols their destiny. When the pilgrims return, even though they eome back to thn same place they left. they arc, in fad, transformed by the interior and ext<~rior pilgrimage into stronger believers and b<1tter leaders. 
Fortunately this tradition continuos in Catholicism. This summer it will be alivo and well in the eity of Cologne, Germany. Cologne is the site of World Youth Day 2005 on Aug. 21. On that day, the pope will say Mass with a million pilgrims or morn who've traveled from all over tho world to celebrate the faith in communi­ty. These pilgrims will enjoy a week of festivities beforehand: praying, listening to speakers and sharing their expori­ences with Catholics from around the world. 
I attended the last World Youth Day in Toronto in 2002 as a studnnt. Through the pilgrimage I gained snveral new friends from Notrn Danw and els1~wlwre. And. by voyaging to the place. by partici­pating in the Mass with our incredihln pope, we all felt a new sonse of lif'n and a chalhmgn to <:arry it bark with us. Tlw peopln I wont with n~turned to eampus and bncaqw some of' its greatest lnadnrs. The pilgrimago's inlluenee was rmnark­ablo. 
Cologne is calling, and this pilgrimaJ.W makes the same promise. Campus Ministry is organizing a contingent to go onen more. Parishes, diocnsns and groups all over the eountry aro gearing up for the journny. I eneourage you to consider joining all of us as pilgrims. Cheek with your diocosn bar.k honw. Pick up an application to be part of Campus Ministry's group at our website wyd.nd.ndu. You'd be back in timn for dassos to start, and you'd bn a bettor pnrson for it. 
Like I said, summer's eoming and it's lime to start making choices. So what are you planning to do with yoursnll'?

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Obstacles to freedon1s on can1pus are unnecessary 
Given President Bush's liJrtheoming visit to earn­pus this Friday, and coupled with the recent contro­versy in our post-Sept. 11 world mnenrning free­doms and civil liberties, it is striking to me that we, as a University, still maintain polides which seem to be unnoeessary and quite regressive with respects to student right<; to eondud demonstrations, to dreu­lal.l~ questionnain~s and surveys and to hang-up and/or di<.;tribul.l~ advertisement<;, posters or other lhrms ofannouncement<;. As individuals studying to better both the good of the world and ofour immcdi­al.ll eomrnunity here at Notre Dame, we need to ask ourselves enrtain questions. Do these policies repress Lhn exchange of information <md ideas or do they further them'! Do they allow lor appropriate and uninhibil.l~d llow of thought<; amongst students, or do they hinder such llows? Do they allow for <md eneourage a true liberal-arts nducational experi­ence, or do they send mixed-messages about what our goal i<.; !L<.; <m elite, Catholic educational institu­tion? 
It i<.; my personal opinion, and the opinion of many in our community whom I have spoken with, that the polides outlined in DuLac do in faet suppress certain fmedoms 1md liberties that we should all have as students ofa university. 
Flip to page 125 ofyour always-handy 2004-2005 edition of DuLac, mad the entire section entitled "Student Activities Polieies" (it i<.; only 12 pages in length) and see for yourself just what I and many others are eoncerned <Uld perplexed about. For instance, aceording to the rules put ((Jrth here, "All student<;, groups ofstudenl<.; or student organizations wi..,hing to distribul.ll a questionnaire or initiate a survey are mquirnd to request permi<.;sion from the Vice Presidnnt for Student Affairs" by submitting a mpy ofthe questionnaire or survey with a written explanation of the project's purpose. Why? Why i'> it necessary l.ll gp,t penni<>sion from a University offidal for something so basic 1md unobtrusive in nature? 
Thnre's more. According to the regulations out­lined in DuLae, student<; must rehrister all "demon­stration'>" on campLL'> with the A'>.'iOCiate Vice l'residnnt for Residence Ufe. Why? Since the term "demon">tration" is not defined, i'> any type ofa.'>.'>em­bly at all to be considered a "demonstration?" For example, bec.ause of thi'> regulation, students wish­ing to protest Bush's visit to campus here this Friday l.l1chnically must regi">ter with the Associate Vice President of Resllie. Or, students wishing to show solidarity against the VDay festivities, no matter how small their assembly, must technically register as well. Why L<.; that necessary? If a "demonstration" is conducted in a peaceful and orderly manner, why, at a university, a center ofinformation exchange and academic intrigue, must such an a.'>sembly ofequal­ly-minded individuals be registered with university offidals? It Sflerns to me that in this ease, a.'> in many of these eases, we a.'> a community are acting prior to anything controversial actually taking place-in a way, we are attempting to keep controversy from occurring. Thi'> seems like a dangerous thing to do in a setting where we should be encoura.ging, not ham­pering, the free flow ofidea.'> across all lines in our eommunity. 
There arc other elemenl'> ofthis section in DuLac which stick out in a similar manner-for example, the section on "Advertising, Posters and Announcement'> ofActivities," which requires all posters hung-up on campus to be approved by Student Activities. As a compromise, what ifwe had "free speech" areas on campus, policed by students, and allowing for the free advertisement ofideas, announcements, postings by unrecognized or newly­forming groups, etc.? 
All ofthis may seem unimportant to you, it may not seem like a problem to you, maybe you just do not think that the regulations can actually be changed or maybe you just do not care that you "may be sent to the Offiee ofReslife for violating these regulations" (Pg. 125, DuLac). However, to many, and hopefully to many others whom I do not yet know of here at Notre Dame, there is something greater at work here. Even at a private institution such as Notre Dame, individuals should still be guar­anteed reasonable rights and freedoms. This may sound lofty, but why shouldn't we be? After all, ifwe are going to be one ofthe nation's premiere academ­ic institutions and concurrently one of'the world's most elite Catholic centers oflearning, then how can we pos..'>ibly maintain such polides as the ones out­lined above? To me it seems impossible, and I am interested to know -what do you think?

Let's act with class 

With just two critical home games remaining on tho schedule, the men's ba.<.;ketball team needs the fans' support more than over to make a run at the NCAA Tournament. ThP Leprechaun l.ehrion hopes to pro­vide as much ofthat support a.'> possible. However, a problem IHL<.; been brought to our attention that must be addressed. 
At the Boston College game, the Big East commissoner complained about students yelling the word "sucks" aftllr each opposing player's introduction. This has been a long-standing tradition at Notre Dame, but one that does not sit well with some fans and administrators. 
After the complaints, the athletic dPpartment a.">knd the Legion to help end this chanting. If it does not stop, we were told that they will take away giveaways and pizza before the games, and will stop aknowl­edging the student section during Notre Dame player introductions. 
We obviously do not want thi<.; to happen. With that in mind, we are asking the students at the Hutgers game to sit in their seal<; and road the newspapers provided, completely ignoring tho Scarlet Knighl'>. If we refrain from yelling "sueks," then students will avoid a negative out­come. 
We understand this jeer is something that has taken plaeo for many years and it is a difficult task to eurb it so quickly. Despite this, it will benefit everyone more ifwe, as a studPnt body, ean change this trend. Let's start Wednesday with player introductions, then watch the Irish take down Rutgers. 
Since thL'> game will likely be the last of the sca.">on for most studenl'>, give our seniors a loud round ofapplause for their countless contribu­tions to the program during their careers. Notre Dame ba.<.;ketball is back on the map and each ofthese players ha.'> helped greatly along the way. Thanks for all your support of the team and Go Irish!

Unique performances come to ND 
From acrobats to singers to pianists to performers of traditional African music, Notre Dame offers special entertainment throughout the spring semester 



The National Acrobats of Taiwan, ROC is world-renowned for the ability of its acrobats and entertaining spectacle showcased throughout every show. 
By MARIA SMITH Scene Editor 
Spring break might be the top event on most people's minds right now, but the week following the break offers a great deal for fine arts aficionados upon their return. 
The experiences offered in March are truly unique and tick­ets for more popular shows may disappear quickly, so take a look before heading out for the week. The National Acrobats of Taiwan, ROC 
This troupe of acrobats from the Fu Hsing Academy has traveled around the nation performing spectacular feats. 
The acrobats are famous for using household items like tables and chairs in their performances. In the past, they have been known to balance on stools 30 feet high, spin numerous plates on sticks simultaneously and balance 12 acrobats on a single bicyde. 
The average acrobat trains for eight years before performing in the show. Their director, Lo Jib­Hung, was also co-director of the Golden Dragon Acrobats during the 1980s. 
The National Acrobats of Taiwan, ROC will perform March 14 at 8 p.m. The show is part of ND Presents, a series of interna­tional shows brought to the Morris Performing Arts Center by Notre Dame. Tickets are available from the center and range from $20-45. 
Ronan Tynan 
This former member of the Irish Tenors is famous for more than his voice. 
Tynan has sung for some of the most famous people in the world -including at the wedding of New York Mayor Rudy Guilliani, during the seventh inning at many New York Yankees games and at the funeral of Ronald Reagan. 
But this remarkable singer only began voice lessons at the age of 
33. Tynan had both legs amputat­ed below the knee after a car accident at the age of 20, and before beginning his career as a musician worked as a certified medical doctor in the field of orthopedic sports injuries. Tynan also won 18 gold medals and 14 

world records as a multitalented athlete in the Paralympics between 1981 and 1984. 
Now the singer is famous for his diverse performances ranging from Verdi's "Requiem" to the hymn "How Great Thou Art" to the pop classic "From a Distance." No matter what he is performing Tynan's voice remains one of the clearest and most beautiful in the world. 
Ronan Tynan will perform in the Leighton Concert Hall Thursday, March 17 at 8 p.m. Tickets cost $20 for students, $37 for seniors, $40 for faculty and staff and $50 for the general public. Emmanuel Ax and Yefim Bronfman 
Classical pianists and Grammy winners Ax and Bronfman are proof that there are few lan­guages as international as classi­cal music. 
Ax was born in Lvov, Poland. At the age of six he began to study piano in Warsaw. After his family moved to North America in 1961, Ax began his studies at the Julliard School of Music. 
Bronfman was born in Tashkent, the current capital of Uzbekistan, which was at that time part of the Soviet Union. Bronfman immigrated to Israel in 1973 and auditioned for the Israel Philharmonic at the age of 15. 
Both artists have performed around the world. Bronfman, who performed Shastakovich's Piano Concerto No. 2 in Fantasia/2000, performed the piece in New York, London, Paris, Tokyo and Los Angeles for the gala screenings of the film. Ax has performed with the London Symphony Orchestra, Orchestre National de France, Suisse Romande and DSO Berlin, and is sought for performances around the United States. 
Ax was awarded a Grammy for his performance of the Haydn Piano Sonatas. Bronfman was also given the award in 1997 for his performances of Bartok's Three Piano Concertos with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. 
The two pianists produced their first famous duet collaboration in 2002 with the release of the rarely recorded Rachmaninoff pieces for four hands. Their cur­rent tour includes pieces for four hands by Debussy, Havel and Stravinsky. 
Emmanuel Ax and Yefim Bronfman will perform March 18 at 8 p.m. in the Leighton Concert Hall. Tickets cost $15 for stu­dents, $36 for seniors, $38 for faculty and staff and $48 for the general public. 
Ladysmith Black Mambazo 

The sound of Ladysmith Black Mambazo is unmistakable and very distinguished. 
Over the past 15 years, these singers of traditional South African music have become cul­tural ambassadors around the world. The group sings a style called lsicathamiya, which was first sung by black South African mine workers. The music was for­bidden under apartheid and Mambazo has since become a national treasure as it has been brought back to worldwide atten­tion. Mambazo accompanied the South African President F. W. deKlerk to the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Olso, Norway in 1993 and performed at Nelson Mandela's inauguration in 1994. 
The full, rich and rhythmic a capella sound of Mambazo is per­haps most famous for its appear­ance on Paul Simon's 1997 release "Graceland." The album was one of the most influential works in a burst of world music that entered popular culture and was certainly instrumental to Mambazo's fame. 
"Shaka Zulu," the group's first 
U.S. release. won a Grammy for Best Traditional Folk Album. Since then the group has been nominated for six additional Grammys. Mambazo has also per­formed with George Clinton, Stevie Wonder, Dolly Parton and Ben Harper. Their performance on Sesame Street with Paul Simon is also one of the top three most requested segments of the show's history. 
Groups with the talent and political po\Yer of Mambazo are truly few and far between. 
Ladysmith Black Mambazo will perform Sunday, March 20 at 8 
p.m. at the Leighton Concert Hall. Tickets are $15 for students, $28 for faculty and staff and $35 for the general public.

By BECCA SAUNDERS Assistant Scene Ediror 
As South Bend winter continues into March, Notre Dame students will not need to look far to lind an entertaining and eul­turally expanding activity. In fact, one only needs to look as far as the Browning Cinema in the DeBartolo Center for the Performing Arts to discover a world of cinema waiting to be viewed. 
The Browning Cinema shows lilms of various genres throughout the year, but many of the Thursday night slots of this snmestor arn dndicatod to showing films that are part of the 2004-2005 Nanovie Institute series of contemporary film called "European Cinemas, European llistorios." Prior to their 7 p.m. showings, the films are generally introduend by a person with some sort of rnlationship to tho subject of the film or to the film itself. Shown as part of Nl> Cinema, the films of various languages and genres provide a glimpso into tho world boyond snowy South Bend and the United States. 
Two l"ilms that were part of the "1\uropean Cinemas. 1\uropean llistories" have alrnady como and gone. The Fronch ''L'Auberge espagnole" (2002) and the Irish "Bloody Sunday" (2002) worn shown narlinr this senwstnr, but tho majority of the program has ynt to be shown. 
Tlw next film will be shown Thursday at 7 and I 0 p.m. The Spanish lilm is called "l.a Mala edLH:aeion!Bad Education" (2004) and was dirednd by Pmlro Almodovar. The 7 p.m. showing will be introdu1:ed by Professor Marvin J)'J.ugo from Clark University. The plot of the movie revolves ,

for the most part around two boys. lgnaeio and 1\nriquo, in the early 19(J0s. A1:cording to tho lntnrnational Movie Databaso Web Site synopsis, they "discover love, movios and fear in a Christian school. Father Manolo, the school principal and litnraturn teaehnr, both witnesses and takes part in these diseoverios." Tho film continuos based around the same three men as they again cross each other's paths in the latn 1970s and in 1 980, changing "the life and death of some of thorn." A promising lilm from a world rnnowned director, "La Mala educaeion/Bad Edueation" is a must-sen film according to many lilrn critics. 
"Hoscnstrasse" (Germany 2003) is the next lilm showing in the Nanovie Institute series on March 17 at 7 and 10 p.m. Directed by Margarethe von Trotta, "Hosnnstrasse" will be introduced by Nathan Stoltzfus from Florida State Univorsity at the 7 p.m. showing. In a review of "Hosenstrasse," Jeremy Fox of pajiba.com describes early 1943 Berlin, when "the German government seized thousands of Berlin Jews who previously had been allowed their freedom because th1~y were married to G1mtilns. The Nazis held them in the former office of the Authority for the Welfare of the Jewish Community at 2-4 Hosenstrasse, planning to deport them to coneentration camps. Their families began to assemble in thn street in front of the building, more eaeh day, and after months of peaceful but increasingly verbal protest, those held inside were set free." The story is based around the story of protestor Lena Fischer and is primarily told through her flash­backs to the successful protesting of 1943. 
On March 31 the Nanovie Institute will show "Captains of April" (Portugal 2000), whid1 was dirndnd by Maria dn Mnd1~iros. Hobert Fishman from tlw departnwnt of sodolo).,ry will introduc1~ tlw 7 p.m. SITnnn­ing. Tho Nanovic lnstituto Wnh sitn explains tho film "isn't a docunwntary about tho 197 4 nwolution in Portugal. But it giws us an idl'a of how it was likl'. Tlw heroie actions of Captain Salguniro Maja arnn't oxaggnrations and tlw lilm is also a tributn [(n· his donds."

PGA 

Top competitors to take the green at Doral 
Monetary incentive entices players to make appearance at Ford Championship 
Associated Press 
MIAMI -The stars are aligned in Miami, and some believe it's no accident. 
The Ford Championship at Dora! begins on Thursday with one of the strongest fields on the PGA Tour this year. The only player missing from the top 12 in the world ranking is No. 3 Ernie Els, who has played the Dubai Desert Classic every year since winning Dora! in 2002. 
A small part of the tourna­ment began Monday. 

Across town at Indian Creek Country Club, Ford Motor Co. had a corporate outing involv­ing Vijay Singh (No. 1), Retief Goosen (No. 5), Sergio Garcia (No. 6) and Padraig Harrington (No. 8). 
And they didn't show up out of the goodness of their heart. The Sun-Sentinel cited a tour­nament source as saying the fee was as high as $150,000. 
Appearance money? 
"It's a corporate outing early in the tournament week," said Duke Butler, vice president of tournament business affairs at the PGA Tour. "It's not unlike a number of things that have gone on for years. None of those stipulate that you must play in the tournament." 
Ford did not need to invite Phil Mickelson (No. 4) to the outing, because it already has an endorsement deal with the Masters champion. Lefty played with select Ford dealers on a different golf course Tuesday. 
What gives the Doral field some serious pop is Tiger Woods, the top draw anywhere in the world. Woods wasn't included in the outing for obvi­ous reasons -he is sponsored by Buick, and $150,000 is chump change for a guy who commands $3 million when he goes overseas. 
Still, the corporate day with four players -all of them IMG clients -has become such an issue that it will be on the agenda when tournament spon­sors gather for their annual meeting later this month at The Players Championship. 
"Those players already told us last year they were going to play Dora!," PGA Tour commis­sioner Tim Finchem said. "Perception-wise, I understand the concern. We have to deal with the perception." 
In some respects, it is simply smart business, and Ford is not alone. 
Ford became title sponsor at Dora! about the time it signed up Mickelson to wear its logo on his shirt and make "What will Phil do next" commercials. That all but assures Lefty will be at Doral every year, although he skipped the first year when his wife was preg­nant with their third child. · 
That's no different than the deal between Buick and Woods. 
Woods is not contractually obligated to play any of the four Buick tournaments, although he has played at least two of them each year since he­became part of the Buick golf team. 
And don't forget 84 Lumber~ 
The Pennsylvania company 

signed an endorsement deal with Singh and John Daly, another big draw. And speaking of appearance money, 84 Lumber attracted a stronger­than-usual field last year by offering every eligible player at its tournament six first-class seats on a charter to Ireland for the World Golf Championship.

Miller's free throws lead Grizzlies past Warriors 99-97

MEMPIIIS, Tenn. -The Memphis Grizzlies finally found their shooting touch. 
Mike Miller stole a pass by Jason Hichardson, then hit two free throws with 10.4 seconds left, and the Grizzlies held ofl' the Golden State Warriors 99-97 Tuesday. 
The Grizzlies won their second straight game by snapping out of a franchise-wmst shooting slump that had seen thnm rail to shoot 40 percent in the past six games by hitting 49.:~ percent (36-ol'­73). It was Uwir best. perform­ance since shooting 50 percnnt on Feb. 8 against Minnesota. 
"I think it was just a matter of knocking down open shots," Grizzlies forward Brian Cardinal said. "If you go back and look at tho games we'vn struggled shooting, we've struggled because we weron't hitting the opnn shots." 
Memphis coach Mike Fratnll<~. now just one victory from becoming the 19th NBA eoach with 600 career victories, agreed. lie pointed out tho Grizzlies shot 9-of-20 from 3­point rangn after hitting a sea­son-low three 3s in Saturday night's victory at San Antonio. 
"We finally came alive from the 3-point line, which has boon missing for a while," Fratello said. 
Shane Battier seornd a season­high 2!i points and grabbed I 0 rebounds, Cardinal added 20 and Miller finished with 19 for Memphis. The Grizzlies also took the season series from Golden State 3-1. 
"This was a game we had to win," Battier said. "Wo'vo got to take care of tho teams that are below us in the standings. It. was a nice win on a day that was a little irregular." 
This isn't the start tlw Warriors wanted for an night­game road trip. Biehardson fin­ished with 29 points, Mickaol Pietrus added 17. Mike Dunleavy 16 and Baron Davis I 0.

Associated Press 
KISSIMMEE, Fla. -Tim Hudson probably would have gotten more money by becoming a free agent. He had other things on his mind, like playing close to home for the team he rooted for as a kid. 
Hudson completed a $47-million, four-year contract extension with the Atlanta Braves on Tuesday, giving up the chance to go through free agency at the end of the season. 
"I knew all along this was the place I wanted to be," said Hudson, a for­mer 20-game winner. "It was just a matter of getting together with a fair· enough contract." 
Hudson will make $6.75 million this year. His new deal calls for a $10 million signing bonus, payable when the contract is approved by the com-
IN BRIEF 
Redskins give Samuels team-record signing bonus 
ASHBURN, Va. -This year's big signing for the Washington Redskins at the start of free agency is one of their own: tackle Chris Samuels, who received the largest signing bonus in team history. 
Samuels and the team reached agreement Tuesday night for a multi­year deal that includes a signing bonus of $15.75 million, according to an official in the league who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Further details were not immedi­ately available, but the deal solves a pressing need just before the start of free agency at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday. Samuels' contract was scheduled to count a whopping $9.5 million against the salary cap this year, constraining the team's ability to re-sign players and acquire new ones. 
Samuels' bonus exceeds the club­missioner's office, and salaries of $4 million in 2006, $6 million in 2007 and $13 million each in 2008 and 2009. 

Hudson's extension contains a $12 million mutual option for 2010 with a $1 million buyout. If the option is exer­cised, the deal would be worth $58 million over five years. 
"We look forward to Tim being the cornerstone for us going into a new era of excellent Braves pitching," gen­eral manager John Schuerholz said. 
Hudson was traded from Oakland to Atlanta in December. Hudson went 12­6 with a 3.53 ERA in 27 starts, but spent a month on the disabled list with an injury to his left side. 
He figures he would have command­ed at least $15 million a year as a free agent, but was willing to settle for less to play for the Braves. 
The 29-year-old right-hander was a 
record $15.5 million linebacker LaVar Arrington received in his nine­year, $68 million contract signed in December 2003. 
Jury investigates slush fund at Colorado 
DENVER -The grand jury that investigated Colorado's football pro­gram said two female trainers alleged they were sexually assaulted by an assistant coach, and a slush fund was created with money from coach Gary Barnett's football camp, according to a report leaked to the media. 
Money was kept in 16 or 17 cash boxes, each managed by a different person with little oversight, accord­ing to the grand jury's findings, which were obtained by KUSA-TV and shared with The Denver Post. 
A source who has seen the grand jury report confirmed the accuracy of tho news reports on Tuesday. The source spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Braves fan growing up near Columbus, Ga. He attended Auburn University and is planning to build a home in that Alabama town, about a two-hour drive from Atlanta and already home to his parents. 
With two young daughters and another child on the way-Hudson's wife is due in April -the pitcher was willing to sacrifice a few million dollars to get a deal done with the Braves. 
"It's not like $11.5 million (a year) is peanuts," he said. "Obviously, it's below market value for me. That's fme." 
Once the two sides began serious negotiations, things went smoothly. The main points were agreed on sev­eral days ago, leaving plenty of time to finalize the deal before Hudson's self­imposed Tuesday deadline to reach an extension. 
Hornets waive veteran Davis 

NEW ORLEANS-The New Orleans Hornets waived Dale Davis on Tuesday, clearing the way for him to join a team -perhaps the Indiana Pacers -that is seeking a veteran forward for the playoffs. 
The Detroit Pistons have also expressed interest in acquiring the 35-year-old forward, who has aver­aged 8.5 points and 8.2 rebounds dur­ing his 15-year career. 
Davis came to the Hornets along with Speedy Claxton shortly before last week's trading deadline in a deal that sent point guard Baron Davis to Golden State. 
But the Hornets never expected Dale Davis, whose contract expires after paying him $10.1 million this season, to report to New Orleans. 
Davis played for the Pacers for his first nine seasons before being traded in 2000 to the Portland Trailblazers for All-Star forward Jermaine O'Neal.

Walker happy with his return 
Forward looks to make impact against the Lakers Wednesday 
Associated Press WAlTHAM, Mass. -Antoine Walker was back at the Boston Celtics' suburban workout facil­ity, back in the familiar green, back on the practice parquet. The only visible difference was the No. 51 on the spare warmup jersey he grabbed, and the smile on his face. Chucking up 3-pointers ­relax, Celties fans, it's only practice -Walker was happy to be back in Boston after his exile on the Dallas beneh and NBA purgatory with the bot­tom-dwelling Atlanta Hawks. So happy that he's willing to put his problems with Celtics bas­ketball boss Danny Ainge, whom he once called a snake, in the past. "I give Danny a lot of credit for bringing me back. That takes a lot for anyone to do," Walker said Tuesday as he pre­pared for his first game back in Boston with the Celtics. "I said things I dido 't really mean, and I'm sure he said things he prob­ably didn't mean." Walker called himself a more mature player than the one that left Boston 1 1/2 years ago when Ainge sent him to Dallas -as much to break his stran­glehold in the locker room as on the court. The Mavericks sent him to Atlanta last summer, and the Hawks bailed out on him last week to get a future first­round draft pick. "It lifted my spirits up to come back to a team that can win," Walker said as he looked toward Wednesday night's game against the Los Angeles l.akers. "It's going to be very exciting for me." A No. 1 draft pick in 1996, Walker played seven years in Boston and became the face of the franchise. He made three all-star teams, carried the

Celtics to the 2002 Eastern Conference finals and, with Paul Pierce, accounted for a bigger portion of the team's points than any duo in the league but Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. 
But soon after Ainge took over the Celtics' basketball operations, he determined that he wouldn't pay the maximum price Walker wanted in an extension. The concern that Walker wouldn't be happy after the snub apparently prompted Ainge to ship him to Dallas. 
Walker lashed out. 
That was then. 
''I'm just happy to be back in the place where I started my career, and I've had success," he said. 
But more has changed than stayed the same for the Celtics since Walker's departure. Jim O'Brien is no longer the coach, and with him went the pBrpetu­al 3-point shooting that had Walker stationed at the perime­ter instead of banging under the basket. 
"Philosophies changed. We just haven't shot the 3 a whole lot," coach Doc Hivers said. "He's been fine with it." 
Hivers, who was the coach of the Orlando Magic for part of that time, said Walker let oppo­nents off the hook when he strayed from the basket. 
"I thought he was easier to guard then than he is now," Hivers said. "All we knew was, we didn't want him in the box. If he made 3s and beat us, we felt, 'We'II live with that.' When he beat us down low, it killed 
us."

Agreement reached with Bryant accuser 
Associated Press 
DENVER -Experts believe a settlement between Kobe Bryant and the woman who has accused him of rape makes the most sense for both sides because it allows them to avoid a potentially embarrass­ing trial that would bring out intimate details of their lives. 
ABC News Hadio reported Tuesday that the NBA star and his 20-year-old accuser have reached an agreement in prin­ciple, with a settlement possi­ble as early as this week. 
Attorneys for Bryant did not return ealls, and the woman's attorneys declined to end to courtrooms, an end to mfletings with lawyers," Denver attornBy Larry Poznflr said. "And what you give back is money, and what Kobe Bryant has a lot of is money." 
The woman filed her lawsuit in Denver federal court in August, three weeks before the criminal case against the Los Angeles Lakers star collapsed when she deeided she could not participate in the trial. 
Allegations in the lawsuit echoed those of the criminal ease: The woman said Bryant flirted with her during a tour of the Vail-anm resort where she worked in June 2003. 
After the two

session with  consultant  from bBhind.  

Bryant on Friday, but it was scratched, prompting speculation a settlement was close. 
Denver attorney Bill Keating said a settlement always seemed the only logical end for the high-proiile lawsuit. 
Bryant and many observers "recognize this is a ease likely to be very time-consuming, very expensive and a case that delves into intensely personal issues on both sides," Keating said. 
"It's really the perfect case to be settled because there are lots of areas of compensation other than money that come along with getting the case set­tled: not having to be involved in this public issue any more," he said. 
A settlement would offer Bryant "an end to litigation, an

Bryant, a married father of one, issued an apology to the woman but maintained the sex was consensual. 
Bryant, 27, has to bring an end to the civil case if he hopes to regain a semblance of the rising-star image that brought him lucrative product endorse­ments before he was charged with sexual assault, said David Carter, a sports marketing consultant with the Los Angeles-based Sports Business Group.. 
"There's going to be some real short-term pain attached, but absent this, he'll never be able to move on to any kind of marketing career," Carter said. 
Wallace leads Bobcats to a 94-87 win over Kings 
Associated Press 

CHARLOTTE, N.C. -Gerald Wallace expected to be fired up to play against the Sacramento Kings. Instead, he felt an over­whelming letdown when the group that took the floor looked nothing like his former team. 
Still. Wallace had one of his best all-around games of the season in leading the Charlotte Bobcats to a 94-87 victory over the Kings on Tuesday night. 
lie finished with 16 points, seven rebounds and five steals against the team that drafted him. l-Ie spent three seasons with the Kings before they left him unprotected in the expan­sion draft. 
"A lot of thn excitement was down because a lot of the guys I played with are gone or didn't play," Wallace said.· "The feel­ing wasn't there that I thought would be there. It didn't feel
-
the same. It didn't feel like the same team." 
The Kings arc still juggling a new lineup created after trad­ing Chris Webber to Philadelphia for Corliss Williamson, Brian Skinnnr and Kenny Thomas. 
Plus, starters Brad Miller (calf ·contusion) and Peja Stojakovic (strained hamstring) were in street clothes, as was reserve Darius Songaila (strained foot). 
"We got a win," Wallace said. "Whether its them or some other team, we came out with the win." 
Wallace shot 7 -of-12 from the floor -pretty good considering he sat out Charlotte's last game with a sprained wrist -and had a huge defensive rebound with the Bobcats leading 90-82 with 1:19 to play. 
Sacramento's Mike Bibby missed a jumper and Wallace grabbed the rebound and pushed the ball up the court. Brevin Knight converted with a jumper that made it 92-82 with 58 seconds left. 
Primoz Brezec led the Bobcats with 19 points, Knight had 17 points and 10 assists and Emeka Okafor had 11 points and 13 rebounds. Melvin Ely came off the bench to score 11. 
Bobcats coach Bernie Bickerstaff wasn't all that 
pleased with the victory, point­ing to Sacramento's 48-40 rebounding advantage and Charlotte's 18 turnovers. 
"We got a victory and we needed one," he said. "But you can't be satisfied with that unless you say 'On a bad night, we got it done."' 
Williamson, acquired last week in the trade for Chris Webber, led Sacramento with 18 points and all three players acquired from Philadelphia for Webber had decent games: Skinner had 15 points and 16 rebounds and Kenny Thomas had 13 points and 12 rebounds. 
But Mobley (17 points) and Bibby (14) were off, combining to shoot 12-of-29 with 14 turnovers. 
"The three guys who we got played hard, but our two guards really had a tough night," Kings coach Hick Adelman said. "You are not going to go very far, especially with guys out and being short­handed, if Cuttino and Mike have games like that." 
All of Sacramento's problems helped Charlotte build a 55-45 lead at halrtime.

needs to be," Chris Quinn 
said. "These past couple of 
days we been more focused, 
and we're ready to get back 
on the court." 
The Irish (Hl-9, 8-6 Big East) return to the court tonight hosting Hutgers (9-16, 
2-12) at the Joyce Center. Home-court advantage has played a major role in this series, with the host team winning the past live games between these two teams. 
The key for the Irish tonight will be reestablishing themselves on the defensive end. 
Hutgers has the second­worst defense in the confer­ence, allowing 69.4 points per game, so the Irish aren't coneerned about being able to score points against the Scarlet Knights. 
"Offensively we'll be all righJ., " Qu i n n s a i d . "Defensively, this year, it's something we've b1~en able to rely on. holding teams in tlw 50s and 60s-and these past couple of games, it's not the tnam we've been all year." 
Hutgers hasn't won a road game since Dne. 28 or a con­ference road game since Jan. 28, 2004 -a stretch of I I Big East games. 
This is the type ol' the ganw the Irish should win. 
In m a ki n g a r u n at t lw NCAA tournamnnt, that's what tho snln<:tion eommitten is looking at -arn thoscl teams close to the lield of 65 winning the games thoy'rn supposed to. 
That's all the Irish need to be coneerned about, espocial­ly since they control their own destiny. 
"I think at this time of the season, a lot of players gnt caught up in HPJ, standings and rankings, but it's just numbers," Chris Thomas said. "At the end of the day, if you put together your best resume and play each gamn like it's a tournament-type game, you'll bn finn. 
"That's something I've reit­erated day in and day out." 
For Notrn Dame's resume, a win tonight gets them a winning record in tho ruggPCI Big East. 
It also puts them in position to win 10 conferenee games for the fourth time in Mike Brey's five snasons in South Bend, whieh all but guaran­teos thnrn a spot in the NCAA tournamnnt. 

But right now, all the Irish ean do is not put too mueh prnssurn on thnmsPivns and take earn of businnss against the Searlet Knights. 
"We can almost tast.o it. It's something we want so badly," Thomas said. "You ean almost s11P it in our body lan­guage and our l'aeP. It's not so much that we'rn tight or we're nnrvous-just t.hat we want it so badly, nspneially l'or nw, bnr.ause I want it so bad l'or thn team."

was able to pin him against the ropes a total of three times, landing a devastating series of rights and lefts to solidify his win. 
Patrick "No Tomorrow" McMorrow, a senior from O'Neill, fought in the next bout with a sense of urgency and quickly disposed of Siegfried sophomore Nate Dyer. 
.Just 1:15 into the fight, McMorrow landed a punish­ing right hook that drew blood from Dyer. 
After a 10-count. the refer­ee stopped the contest, known as an HSC, and declared McMorrow the win­ner. 
The third match of the 165-pound weight class pit­ted Damon Semmens against off-campus senior Chase "You around the ring" Heaton. 
After a slow start, Heaton began pounding away at Semmens and eventually won by unanimous decision. 
He knocked the law stu­dent to the canvas in the sec­ond and offered several strong jabs to the head in the third. 
Following the Heaton­Semmens contests, Jeff "Million" Robinson and Chris "The Count of Monte Fisto" Million gave the fans a dis­play of power jabs hooks. 
Robinson got off to a good start, connecting on several combinations, but Million came back with a strong sec­ond round. 
Million won by RSC 40 sec­onds into the third round with a tremendous left-hand­ed coup de grace. · Headshots and combina­tions exemplified the fifth and final 165-pound match­up of the night. Jeff "The Spuz Stud" Schaal won a unanimous decision over

Apparently, the trainers forgot to tell the first two sets of competitors in the 1 70-pound weight class about the prohibition of wrestling-style takedowns. 
And, apparently, the judges seemed to be fine with that. 
To begin the 170-pound contests, Alumni freshman .Jon "The Sanitizer" Floyd battled against Tom "Loves the Nugget" Digan. 
The match was full of fast­paced shots and returns, and it ended on exactly that note. 
With just seconds remain­ing in the third, Digan acci­dentally face-planted Floyd after a bear hug ended a heavy exchange. 
Digan was not punished, however, winning the bout in a split decision. 
In the second match of the class, Brad "Ba Ba Black Sheep" Wanchulak became the second boxer to win after illegally taking down his opponent. 
After dominating Adam "Alpha Fox" Frisch for two­plus rounds, Wanchulak appeared to lose his balance during a hug, in the process accomplishing a powerful full-body takedown Frisch. 
When the match resumed, "Ba Ba Black Sheep" contin­ued his dominance and won with a unanimous decision. 
Matt "Touch Me and I'll Sue" Smith followed that performance with a take­down of his own. 
He defeated Tripp "Dirty Jersey" Matteo in a RSC 1:15 into the match after a series of headshots disoriented Matteo. 
Although that contest was quick, the next match took even less time to complete. 
Andrew ''Down Goes Frazier" Breslin knocked down and defeated Mike "The Irish Curse" Sullivan just 60 seconds after the starting bell rang. 
Two freshmen then ended the streak of quick fights, battling in a long bout, stopped several times due to blood. 
Fisher Hall's Ben O'Brien drew first blood at the end of the opening round, landing a right to the face of Chris "That Guy" Ilippleheuser at the end of the period. 
Hippleheuser returned the favor several times over in the second, drilling O'Brien in the nose so many times that the referee had to sus­pend the match three times in the round. 
In the delayed third round, O'Brien found new life late, connecting with several right-left combinations and nearly knocking Hippleheuser to the floor. 
However, Hippleheuser's dominance in the first two rounds earned him a unani­mous win. 
In the sixth 170-pound bout, Dan "Pound Town" Ward landed eight right-left combinations in the second and defeated Brian "Slacks" Murphy by RSC with a left to the face 52 seconds into the third. 
The 170-pound matches ended with off-campus sen­ior Craig Thompson beating law student Eric Silva by unanimous decision. 
Silva landed several punches in the second, but Thompson's attack of speed and power overwhelmed him.

Upsets occur in 180-pound class 
By KEN FOWLER AND 
CHRIS KHOREY 
Sporrs Writers 

Leading ofl' the late session of Bengal Bouts preliminaries Tuesday night at the Joyce Center Fieldhouse, freshman Mike Heilly of Fisher took on Eric "The Hed Menace" Hetter, a sophomore from Stanford, in the 180-pound division. The Red Menace knocked Reilly down in the first round, but the freshman used an aggressive strategy in the second and third rounds to come back and win by split decision. 
In the next bout, also in the 180-pound division, senior Dana Collins defeated graduate student .Jason "The Amarilla Killa" Miller in a unanimous decision. Collins was bloodied twice -once in the first round and once in the sec­ond -but recovered and landed several shots to Miller's head, including one that drew a gasp from the crowd as the final bell sounded. 
Next up in the division was Ed "Optimus Prime Rib" Hattrup and Doug "Six Months in the Hospital or Sudden Death" Bartels. Bartels attacked Hattrup early and often, dazing him and beating him into three standing eight counts by the middle of the second round. The referee stopped the fight 40 seconds into the second frame and declared Bartels the winner by technical knockout. 
Michael Siefring and Stu "Beans" Stypula started their 180-pound division fight tenta­tively, dancing their way through an uneventful first round. Stypula finally took the initiative in the second round, backing Siefring into the ropes. In the third round, Beans forced his opponent back into a neutral corner, and, despite valiant counterpunching by Siefring, won by unanimous deci­sion

Phipps looked like a title con­tender with his effective use of aggressive hooks and skillful jabs. The referee counted off a stand­ing eight for Nanovic only 10 sec­onds into the fight and then again in the second round. The Institute made a valiant attempt at a comeback in the third round but a Phipps counterpunch knocked him down and earned No Name the win by unanimous decision. 
In the last fight of the night, heavyweights Tony "Tiny Bubbles" Cunningham and Michael Milligan squared off. Cunningham landed several hard shots to Milligan's head early, using his superior size to great advantage. 
Late in the first round, a hard Tiny Bubbles cross knocked Milligan through the ropes. In the second round, Milligan tried to use his quickness, but Cunningham landed several hard blows and knoeked him down. In the third round, Milligan regained his confidence and briefly gained the upper hand, but it was too little too late as Cunningham recorded a win by unanimous decision. 
After getting knocked down less than 20 se·conds into the match, Chase "The Gunner" Gund nearly pulled off an amaz­ing comeback in the first 180­pound match-up of the night. Michael "Tepic Carl" Schmeid drew blood from the O'Neill soph­omore early and dominated the early portions of the bouts. However, Gund turned the tide late in the second and dominated the third with powerful jabs. It was not enough, though, as Schmeid won in a split decision. 
Nicholas "Goulet" Klein and Scott "Cheese Whiz" Kustes bat­tled in the next fight, going back and forth in a very even bout. After starting slowly, Klein landed enough headshots in the second and third rounds to win a split decision and advance to the next round. 
The third fight of the class pit­ted Hobert "The A.L.T.ien" Lochridge against Jefl' Gola. 
The more powerful Gola domi­nated the match, connecting on many more combinations and jabs than the junior from Knott. Thanks to Cola's headshots and power, the judges gave him a unanimous win.

Men have two Big East tests remaining 
By MATT LOZAR Sports Writer
