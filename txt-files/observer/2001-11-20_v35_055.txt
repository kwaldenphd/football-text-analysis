Giving thanks 
What does it mean to give thanks? Why do we even celebrate the holiday of Thanksgiving? It's a national holiday ... but that doesn't tell us much about thanks. We talk 
about how the pilgrims cel­ebrated the first Thanksgiving to give thanks for surviving a rough harsh year. We depict it as them reaping bountiful harvests, with cornucopia overflowing after a year of toil. 
That first Thanksgiving 


though, they gave thanks more for friendship and  Angela Campos  
help they received from the  
American Indians in the  
area. They gave the pil­grirns food and helped them  Lab Tech  
survive the harsh East coast  
winter. They helped bring  

and make the feast that we now consider Thanksgiving. 
So, as we go begin this holiday season take time to look at the things you do, the places you've been and the people you know. 
Don't just give thanks for the things that you were able to do or the places you were able to be. Give thanks for those people who have helped you get through your tough times, give thanks for those people who have helped you celebrate your glad times. Give thanks for those who made you smile or laugh, for those people who challenged you to be a better per­son. Give thanks for all the people who love you. 
Give thanks for your family, for your friends, and for getting home and returning to campus safely. Give thanks for the opportunity to live and study at Notre Dame. Give thanks for the people who work day in and day out so that we can learn. Give thanks for the next person who says hi to you. 
There are many places I've been, many peo­ple that I know, and many things that I've done. I'm thankful for all of them, because they have helped me grow into a better person. They have helped me to understand myself bet­ter. 
There are a lot of people I'd to whom I'd like to say thank you. Thank you to everyone who stood by me when I was going through hard times, thank you for making the time to listen, console me and love me. Your support has been awesome. 
Thank you to the Basilica staff for giving me the opportunity to serve God while at church. Thank you to the Knights of Columbus for won­derful camaraderie during steak sales and other events over the last four years. Thank you to Student Government for giving me the opportunity to serve the students here at Notre Dame. Thank you to the Keough Tabernacle Choir for creating a wonderful community of praise at Mass. 
Thank you to the class of 2002, for being there, challenging, striving, dreaming over the last four years. Thank you for your enthusiasm, your ideas and your solidarity. 
Thank you, Notre Dame for giving me the opportunity to learn and grow in faith, scholar­ship and community. 
I have much to be thankful for. I am truly blessed. Have a safe and blessed Thanksgiving.

Brown allows grad students to become unionized 
PROVIDENCE, R.I. 

In an historic decision, the National Labor Relations Board ruled Friday that Brown University's graduate student workers are employees entitled to unionization privileges. 
NLRB regulations require a secret ballot election be held within 30 days to allow graduate students to vote on unionization. The date of the election will be established within the next week by officials from the NLRB, United Auto Workers and the University, according to the ruling of Rosemary Pye, NLRB region one director. 
Brown will be the first Ivy League institution and the second private university in the United States, to hold a unionization election for grad-
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 
University looks for fair admissions test 
University of California is looking for a fairer test to use in admissions, because less wealthy and underrep­resented students receive lower standardized test scores on average than their wealthier and nonminori­ty counterparts. The College Board and ACT Inc., the two largest standardized testing companies in the nation, announced Friday at a meeting of academic and state officials at UC-Santa Barbara that they would work with the UC in addressing this issue, though they did not mention spec.ific actions. "This is all to open up the university to people who do not have all of the advantages that our society has to offer," UC President Richard Atkinson said at the meeting. "My arguments against the SAT I were not based on pre­dictive validity but on pedagogical and philosophical convictions about achievement, merit and opportunity in a democratic society." Gaston Caperton, president of the College Board and former governor of West Virginia from 1988-96, defended the SAT as being a valid -but not perfect -test.

Woman looking for student sperm doner 
"Stanford student wanted for sperm donor. $15k offered. Intelligent, good looking, over 6 ft. tall. No histo­ry of self or family addictions." This is not the sort of advertisement that readers usually expect to find in the Palo Alto Daily News classified section. Yet just such an ad has appeared there for the past two weeks, placed by a Burlingame woman who hopes to find a sperm donor in order to have a child. The 33-year-old woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, explained that she specifi­cally wants a Stanford University student because she assumes that the donor will have a high level of intelli­gence. As for her other requirements, she said she will decide when she meets the donor. "Intellect is a given if they go to Stanford," she said. "And if I meet them and I like them, I'll choose them." The woman said her uncon­ventional approach to having a child stems from her frustration with the dating scene. 'Tm planning on wait­ing another year until my 34th birthday, and if my dating situation doesn't get any better, then I will go the artifi­cial insemination route," she said.

Family Dining llall and Angela Athletic Facility along with the construction of a new academic building to replace Madeleva Hall, explained Eldred. 
"We hope to have ground breaking for the dining hall in the spring," Eldred said. 
However, plans are moving at a slow rate due to insufficient funds. Eldred stressed that there has been a decline in fundraising and donations due to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. When members of BOG asked what initiatives student govern­ment could take to help in the process, Eldred assured the body that the only thing it could 
do to help the implementation 
was to talk about fundraising. 
According to Eldred. by increasing the amount of money generated by donations, Saint Mary's would not only be able to break ground on planned projects but also promote inter­est in further development of the College by raising money for scholarships. 
"It is exciting to see the change on campus. It creates a real positive feeling throughout the school," student body vice president, Kristen Matha, said in response to Eldred's remarks. 


In other BOG news: 
Matha updated the Board on the progress of the proposed study day. This past month it was low on the faculty meeting agenda so there was not much discussion. However. it will be further up on the agenda in the December meeting. 
"The faculty will take into consideration student's opin­ions when considering the pos­sibility of implementing the study day proposal." said Matha.

FBI connects two anthrax letters 
Asociated Press 
WASHINGTON 

The FBI announced Monday it believes a letter to Sen. Patrick Leahy, belatedly found last week, was written by the same person who sent an anthrax­laced letter to Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle last month. 
Investigators are looking into the possibility that the letter to Leahy, D-Vt., was misdirected, which could have been the source of anthrax contamina­tion at a State Department mail facility that sickened one work­er. 
Two buildings on Capitol Hill struck by the anthrax scare reopened, and U.S. health experts provided assistance to authorities in Chile who found a new letter that may contain anthrax. 
Torn Skinner, spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, said the agency was planning to test a substance found in a letter that the Chilean government said was tainted with anthrax. The government of Chile said the letter came from Switzerland. 
Regarding the Leahy letter, 

U.S. Postal inspector Dan Mihalko said it contains a hand­written Zip code of 20510 that also can be read as 20520 by optical character reader machines at the postal service. 
"That's the exact change needed to forward something to the State Department," said Mihalko. 
"It raises an interesting possi­bility that the letter to Leahy could have been misdirected through the State Department mail system, which might explain how that system got contaminated," said Mihc!Jko. 
The Leahy letter was found Friday by the FBI and haz­ardous materials personnel from the Environmental Protection Agency in one of 280 barrels of unopened mail sent to Capitol Hill and held since discovery of the letter to Daschle. 
The outside of the Leahy let­ter appears virtually identical to the Daschle letter and bears the same fictitious "Greendale School" return address, all-cap­ital block letters and other characteristics. 
Investigators are convinced the two letters were "sent by the same person," the FBI said. Both the Daschle and Leahy let­ters also had block printing with a slight slant to the right and a postmark from Trenton, 
N.J. 
Two of three Senate office buildings reopened Monday after being swept for anthrax contamination. The Hart Senate office building remained closed. 
Environmental Protection Agency officials have said it will take three to four weeks to decontaminate the offices of 10 senators in the Hart building in which traces of anthrax have been found, a Senate aide speaking on condition of anonymity said. Those cleanups have not yet started. 
Two other offices where bac­teria were found -Daschle's and the next-door suite of Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis. -will be sealed and cleaned with chlorine dioxide gas.

Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
The government began taking charge of airport security Monday at the start of the holiday travel season. President George 
W. Bush signed legislation that will have more screeners peering in pas­sengers' bags and more sky marshals flying on planes. 
"Today we take perma-· nent and aggressive steps to improve the security of our airways," Bush said at a ceremony at Reagan National Airport. The new law will put airport screening in the hands of 28,000 federal workers and require inspections of all checked baggage. 
The signing of the most comprehensive air security bill ·in the nation's history came three days after pas­sage by Congress and three days before Thanksgiving. Lawmakers and the administration were determined to act before the holidays in an effort to convince travelers that it was safe to get back on airplanes 10 weeks after the hijacker attacks on. New York and Washington. 
Fewer Americans were planning to travel by air this Thanksgiving, accord­ing to the AAA. The group, formerly known as the American Automobile Association, forecast 4.6 million people traveling by air, a 27 percent decline from last year's 6.3 mil­lion. 
The new law, said Bush, "should give all Americans greater confidence when they fly." 
For many air travelers, already seeing longer waits on the ground and more restrictions in the air, some of the effects of the law won't be readily apparent. 
"It's not going to be a dramatic change immedi­ately," said Transportation Department spokesman Chet Lunner. "There are thousands of posts to be filled ... and dozens of mandates and milestones." 
Federal managers will be moving into position at screening stations, although it -will take a while, probably three months, before travelers see uniformed federal workers doing the screen­ing, said Rep. James Oberstar of Minnesota, ranking Democrat on the House Transportation Committee. 
The law calls for all screening operations to be under federal control with­in a year. 
AFGHANISTAN 
Alliance warlords show divisions 
Associated Press 
KABUL 
Less than a week after the Taliban were driven from Kabul, 3,000 Shiite Muslim fighters are poised outside, demanding a share of power. Major cities are now warlords' fiefdoms, and the idea ofa broad-based government is being challenged by hastily multi­plying posters of factional leaders. 
While the United Nations is trying to organize a power-sharing conference, it must move quickly or Afghanistan could suffer the same anarchy and division that paved the way for the Taliban's rise in the last decade. 
The sudden collapse of the Taliban throughout much of the country has left a power vacuum which the arrival of the northern alliance into Kabul last week only partially filled. 
The alliance is a coalition of five groups -mostly representing ethnic minorities -which were driven from power by the Taliban in -1996 and whic-h rallied together because of their common hatred for the Islamic militia. 
In areas vacated by the Taliban, former warlords such as Ismail Khan in the western city of Herat and 
. Rashid Dostum in the north's Mazar­e-Sharif simply took back control of their old fiefdoms.

There aren't any statistics to prove that more people have been getting engaged since the attacks -but there is plenty of anecdotal evi­dence.

Wedding World Inc .. a 19­store bridal chain based in Altoona, Pa., so far has a 22 percent gain in sales in November at stores open at least a year. 
"The Sept. 11 event is giving the business more momen­tum," company owner David Kaufman said, adding that business got a boost from people in the military who wanted to get married before being sent overseas. 
The wedding industry typi­cally is one of the few sectors that holds up in a recession, though couples tend to scale back on expenses. There are more than 2 .2 million U.S. marriages annually. 
The post-Sept. 11 rise in bridal business surprised David Liu, chief executive of The Knot.com, a leading wed­ding resource. The Knot.com compared its online traffic during the first week of September with traffic during the first week of October, expecting a negative impact. 
Instead, Liu found a 10 per­cent increase in bridal reg­istries. The site also had a 17 percent gain in traffic to its marriage license finder, and has gained advertising from tuxedo retailers and photog­raphers. 
"Bridal is one of the very few businesses that is doing well, and totally defies eco­nomic recession and terror­ism concerns," said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report in Upper Montclair, N.J. "In fact. the greater the uncer­tainties of the time, the greater apparently the eager­ness to get married and form a family." 
Millie Martini Bratten, edi­tor-in-chief of Bride's maga­zine, agreed but said it's not known if the uncertain times have inade couples choose more intimate weddings or bigger affairs. 
Patty Walsh, of Waterbury, Conn., was inspired to spend $6,000 more on her wedding, padding an initial budget of $14,000. 
"I realized that what's money at this point. I wanted my wedding to be the best it could possibly be," Walsh said.

Al-Draibi was arrested about 13 hours after the attacks when he aroused sus­picion by driving away from Dulles International Airport in a car with a flat tire. 
After he was stopped, police found driver's licenses from eight states and flight manu­als for small aircraft, prosecu­tors said. 
But al-Draibi passed two lie detector tests that showed he wasn't involved in the attacks. his attorney, Drewery Hutcheson Jr., said. 
U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III asked prosecutors Monday if the government was satis­fied al-Draibi had nothing to do with Sept. 11. "That's cor­rect," Assistant U.S. Attorney John Morton answered. 
Al-Draibi faces up to 10 years in prison and $250,000 fine when he is sentenced Jan. 18 on the visa fraud charge. 
In his guilty plea, Lopez­flores admitted he falsely cer­tified on Aug. 2 that Ahmed Alghamdi lived at his Alexandria, Va., address. 
Alghamdi, who was aboard one of the hijacked airliners that crashed into the World Trade Center, used the resi­dency certification to obtain an ID card from the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles a month before the Sept. 11 attacks. 
Prosecutors said Alghamdi paid Lopez-Flores $100 for his help. Lopez-Flores, who was deported in 1993 after a crim­inal conviction, acknowledged that he helped at least 20 peo­ple obtain false Virginia IDs since last May. 
Lopez-Flores was the second person to plead guilty in northern Virginia to charges arising from· the investigation into false ID cards obtained by the hijackers.

Faculty! HELP US IDENTIFY COURSES FOR STUDENTS WHO HAVE GONE ON THE URBAN PLUNGE!!! 
In January, 200 students will be traveling to every major urban center in the U.S. to take part in a 48-hour investigation of urban social issues, with agencies, parishes, and others working on problems of poor children, un­employment, homelessness, racism, and many more. After such experi­ences, our students are excited to pursue new academic questions. What policies should be used to address the poverty in our cities? What does my faith tell me about the social problems I have witnessed? What is the "living wage"? If you will be offering a course, either this coming spring or next fall, in which students could explore these types of questions, please contact Mar Beckman at the CSC.

Nazr Mohammed shaved his beard today. He did it in solidarity with his fellow Afghanis, liberated from Taliban rule. "My home of Mazar-e Sharif was freed," he told me recently. "I can go home now and 
take care of my Scott Fllpse mother and sis­ter." 
Nazr Mohammed Pro Bono owns a sandwich stand in down­town Washington, D.C. He is a big man, always smiling while serving up a con­stant stream of small talk and delicious soulvaki. He was a teacher in Afghanistan. He was wounded fighting the Soviets and came to the United States for surgery. He stayed because the Taliban murdered his father. A devout Muslim, Nazr prays several times each day in the back room of a nearby Persian rug dealer. "I pray often," he told me with a smile, "but I'm no Taliban. They are not true Muslims." 
When I asked him whether the fall of the Taliban and the capture of Osama bin Laden would make any difference in the war against terrorism, Nazr's face darkened as he shook his head. "There will be more Osamas," he said. "America helped create him and we Muslims must now deal with his fol­lowers." 
I thought his words were insightful and go directly to the dilemma faced by those nations fighting in Afghanistan. Is there anything that can address the root cause of international terrorism? 
In a recent Newsweek article Fareed Zakaria posited two sources of Muslim rage: U.S. support of Israel and the alliances made between secular authoritarian regimes and the United States. Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Bahrain, Egypt and Kuwait are exam­ples of regimes that have repressed popular political opposition. In this atmosphere Islam is the only way for the "street" to express its anger over dictatorship, changing social mores and poverty. The mosque is the only way to gather freely. Mullahs are the only ones able to speak freely -as long as they blame the nation's prob­lems on nonbelievers, America and Israel. This message is institutionalized by their near monopoly on education. 
But what can the United States do to address this situation? 
For one thing, U.S. support for Israel's existence should not change. The conflict will remain as long as there are those who refuse to recog­nize a Jewish state. President Clinton's recent mediation of a peace agreement generally gave Yassar Arafat every­thing but total control of Jerusalem. That this was rejected should be evi­dence that a resolution might have to wait until the warrior generation exits. Until then, we should try to help the two sides reach an interim, and largely peaceful, way to live. 
On the other problem, I generally agree with those who assert that the United States should insist that its allies stop repression of truly democra­tic opposition if they want U.S. aid. Of course, even here we walk a fine line, for at this p·oint in time we cannot ask our friends to commit political suicide. Yet, there has to be a price paid to stop terrorism. We should ask Saudi Arabia and Egypt to stop the vehement anti­Americanism being taught in their schools and trumpeted in their official press and media. This should be cou­pled with support for democratic edu­cation and alternatives, particularly those outside the control of the most conservative religious authorities. Giving the "street" alternatives to the anti-modern message of Islamic funda­mentalism should be the focus of U.S. foreign policy in the region. 
Yet, even as I write this, I can only think how extraordinarily difficult this will be. There will be no quick solu­tions. We might have to recognize that we have limited ability to address the root causes of the conflict. It is a reli­gious war that can only be won when Muslims stand up and fight it them­selves. 
This is the position taken by Adrian College professor Muqtedar Khan. In a blunt and courageous "Memo to American Muslims," Khan finds those who defend terrorism a scandal against Islam. We cry out about Israel's injustices, writes Khan, but "are silent about Muslim injustices against other Muslims." We cannot reconcile the "vast distance between Islamic values and Muslim practice by pointing out that other nations" have committed injustices against us, argues Khan. We have become so focused on "the other ... that we have completely forgotten our duty to Allah," writes Khan. "In pursuit of this inferior jihad, we have sacrificed the superior jihad -to build a just, merciful, peaceful and moral society."· 
We have been told that this war is not a religious war. Yet, the words of Osama bin Laden are saturated with religious argument and theological language. His battle is not simply one of Islam vs. Christianity and Judaism, but of his brand of Islam against all others -including moderate Muslims. 
With this point Khan agrees. "Biff Laden is a cancer ... that undermines spiritual health and morality," he con­cludes. We must "police our world ... to prevent people from abusing Islam and to make sure that what happened on Sept. 11 never happens again." 
From the outside, it seems like such a daunting task. But I do have hope because Nazr Mohammad is returning to Afghanistan. The faith, values and work ethic he represents will win this fight in the end. I will, however, miss his soulvaki.

Since the subject of fake IDs appeared in a news story and the Inside Column in The Observer on Nov. 19, of course I have taken it upon myself to comment on the matter and the way the University has been han­dling these situations, being yet another opinionated Notre Dame student. 
I'll start by saying that it is true, part of the social life at Notre Dame does involve finding an ID with a photo that remotely resembles oneself in order to get into any particular bar (I think we all know which bars I'm talking about). Of course there are people who chose not to partake in the bar scene, which is fine. whatever gives you kicks. However, there's quite a large num­ber of people enjoying themselves ("Oh no!" cries Rcslife) from time to time with the aid of a fake ID. So that makes a group of peo­ple who have the potential to be caught in a bar raid on a random Thursday night, which is always the talk of the under-agers during the day on Thursday -"I heard that place is gonna get busted!" So the risk is taken, and people get lucky with a legally uneventfol night at whatever bar they hap­pen to choose. 
Recently, however, a "half a dozen" indi­viduals were punished by Reslife for pos­session or soliciting of fake IDs. Here's the kicker: neither Reslife nor the Notre Dame police had ever seen these fake IDs or had any proof that these "invisible" IDs were used, The individuals were punished due to the word of mouth from one other student. 
So yes, Student A says, "Student B has used/made/looked at/breathed on a fake ID." So Student Bis intimidated, threatened and badgered by the Notre Dame police into saying it is true. Student B is punished (rather extremely considering the "proof' came from student A's mouth) and there­fore becomes just a little frustrated because he or she can no longer go abroad, is t>anned from the dorm, must find a place to live for next semester and has a whopping fine on top of it all. Not to mention that per­son probably will not go out ever again until their 21st birthday for fear of Reslife's wrath again in a similar situation (a "tattle­tale" situation, if you will ... oh, and are tat­tletales always telling the truth? Yet anoth­er issue I suppose,) . 
We're not talking about sexual assault here, we're talking about fake IDs, where the results of one's fake ID actions (having it, specifically) do not affect others. So I guess there are a few problems: The Notre Dame police members who feel it is neces­sary to use their power to bully others and have a lovely ego trip, and Reslife. It seems that Reslife may have run out of excitement and needs a few more lawsuits to liven things up. Any other ideas?

There have been a lot of things that have happened in the last few months that have been truly damaging to a lot of people in this country, and things have almost completely gotten back to normal aroUlld here. And that's what's supposed to happen. But it's especially important that we make sure we don't forget what's really important. 
Thanksgiving is this Thursday, and this year, just like every year, people on cam­pus should be thankful for the things we have in the grand scheme of things. I repeat, we are really lucky to have the things we have here. Sometimes getting the best grades on a paper and being around for the mozzarella sticks get in the way of remembering that. As important as those things are, there are other things that are much more important. And it is essential that we know that and be thank­ful for it.

Every generation has its own set of issues that it deals with. In one gen­eration it is the ending of slavery, in another it is women's suffrage. One of the marks of the present generation is that our society is coming to terms with homosexuality. Perhaps it is not so obvious to someone in their late teens and early 20s just how fast society is changing in its acceptance of people who are gay. Just 15 years ago gay charac­

Solidarity Sunday has been a great success across . campus. Network training is available to RAs and University staff and fac­ulty as well as students who take an interest in gay and lesbian issues on campus. The University will continue piloting a program on this issue for first year students this spring semester. Campus Ministry is dedicated to providing a safe, confidential place for gay, lesbian and bisexual students to support one another in a positive and affirming environment. This weekly group is led by a excellent group of undergraduate students and myself. 
Unfortunately, the great majority of undergraduate students at Notre Dame who are gay or lesbian keep their questions, their struggles and their fears to themselves. Most suffer in silence. Most suffer from their silence. They suffer from feeiings of being different, unaccepted. They live in fear of rejection by their family, friends, their roommates and others in their sections. Most do all they can to fit in, all the while fearing the worst if they were to be found out. 
As Catholics and Christians we believe that all people are made in God's image and likeness. God has personally created each one of us and will always love us. For someone who is gay to encounter the very real love of God for them personally is a completely transforming experience. It is this powerful experience that we in Campus Ministry pray for all of our stu­dents and especially for those among us who are gay or lesbian. 
This Nov. 30 Campus Ministry will have the Sixth Annual Gay and Lesbian Retreat, "All Made in God's Image." This retreat is open to all Notre Dame students who are gay, lesbian, bisexual or who wish to sup­port someone who is. If you are interested in participating in the retreat, you may pick up an application in the Retreats Office of Campus Ministry, 114 Coleman-Morse Center. You may also contact me at 1-8144 or Tami Schmitz at 1-3016. The deadline is Wednesday, Nov. 28. Put aside your fears and join us. It may be the best thing you have ever done.

The Unitod Kingdom has always sent some of its best music across the Atlantic. \Vhen one British style becomes popular in /\merica, a wavP of' similar bands floods our airwaves. 
The most recent style to emerge has been that or acoustic Brit folk/rock. Bands like Travis and Coldplay have bad huge success in America. Starsailor is the next to emerge out of this genre. 
Led by singer/guitarist James Walsh, Starsailor's debut album Love Is H+ire is a mellow, mostlv acoustic set of songs that-has enjoyed great buzz since its British release last month. When the album hits U.S. record stores in January. the band will likely see a fair amount of success. 
Backing up Walsh are bassist James Stelfox, drummer Bim Hyrnc and keyboardist Barry Westhead. ThA band has a sound that is comfortabJp, and familiar, but not over-. ly impressive. Love Is Here shows tlrn band's talent and potential, but they have a long way to go before their 
sound matures.

smooth and mesnmr­izing rhythm that holds your attention. "Alcoholic" is a powerful and deeply person­al tune as Walsh's vocals llood with emo­tion. 
"Lu1laby" is a fun and original track that is one of' the better songs on the album. The cool melody and slowish pace always seem like they want to speed up, but the song stays calm and controlled. 
The theme of' the album, and obviously of' most of' the songs, is explorations of love. The title track. "Love Is I lern," is a slow and sad ballad with dnprnssing lyrics and a heartfelt piano solo. "If' you could sen the lover in mn/ And we could join our hands together/ You could see how good it could be/ We'll sing these stupid songs fornver." 
Coming from Britain, many ,bands have to face up to tlw fact that they will never be able to top some of the greatest British bands that have come beforn them. The Beatles. The Holling Stones, Pink Floyd and Radiohead seem to have set the benchmarks for British rock music. and it would take something extraordinary to find yourself counted among them. 
Though Starsailor is rnwcr going to be as big as these bands. they are trying to carve out their own niche in the world. So far. they hav11 only made a small dent. but for a debut album. it is a good start.

MLB 
OLYMPICS 
Bonds wins 4th MVP 
Associated P rcss 
Barry Bonds is looking for affection, not money or tro­phies. 
He's likely to wind up with all three. 
"I just want to be wanted," he said Monday after becom-· ing the first player to win four Most Valuable Player Awards·. 
Bonds won the National League MVP in a landslide to cap a record-breaking sea­son in which his 73 home runs broke baseball's biggest season record. He received 30 of 32 first-place ballots and 438 points in voting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. 
"Once you've won it a few times, the standards for you are very high," Bonds said. "It's very difficult to achieve it again." 
The 37-year-old outfielder hit .328 with 137 RBIs for the San Francisco Giants. Chicago Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa got the other two first-place votes and fin­ished second with 278 points. 
On Tuesday, Bonds can start translating his statistics into cash. That's the first day free agents can negotiate salaries with all teams. 
"The most important thing for me is winning," Bonds said. "I really want to have an opportunity to win. I've played a long time." 
His new agent, Scott Boras, quickly modified his client's remarks. 
"ls this about money? Of course it is. This is a busi­ness," Boras said. 
Bonds is coming off a $30.7 million, three-year contract and Boras is seeking a con­tract of up to five years. Since the end of the season, Boras and the Giants have talked just once, a session last Friday dealing with gen­eralities. 
While Giants' teammates have been cool to Bonds, he feels appreciated by the Bay area fans. He has bristled at his image -a detached and sometimes selfish star. 
"I learned that there's a lot of people here in · San Francisco that do like me," Bonds said. "Sure, my pref­erence is to stay. My prefer­ence is to play baseball, but I have to do what is best for me. and I know the organiza­tion has to do what's best for them." 
Bonds also won the MVP award for Pittsburgh in 1990 and 1992 and for the Giants in 1993. He finished second to Atlanta's Terry Pendleton in 1991 and to San Francisco's Jeff Kent last year. 
"I don't have a home big enough to put trophies in my house," said Bonds, who has earned in excess of $ 75 mil­lion in nine seasons with the Giants. 
Boras, using Bonds' aver­age of 47 homers in the last five seasons, projects his client will have 802 homers by the end of the 2006, 47 more than Hank Aarons career record. 
Bonds will be 42 by then. 
"There's a lot of statistics I can do if I stay at the same pace and stay in the same shape," he said. 
Before Bonds, the only three-time MVPs were Roy Campanella, Stan Musial and Mike Schmidt in the NL, and Jimmie Foxx, Joe DiMaggio, Yogi Berra and Mickey Mantle in the American League. 
"I don't think you could ever dream of surpassing players of that stature. There are no words for it," Bonds said. ''I'm just grateful." 
Bonds broke two of Babe Ruth's records last season, walking 177 times -seven more than Ruth's total in 1923 -and finishing with an .863 slugging percentage, 16 points higher than Ruth's percentage in 1920. Bonds has 567 career homers, sev­enth on the career list. 
He also broke the season home run of 70 set three 
years ago by Mark McGwire. 
It is not yet clear how much of an effort the Giants will make to retain Bonds, who has failed to lead them to the World Series. The last reigning MVP to change teams was Bonds, who left Pittsburgh in 1992 to sign with San rrancisco. 
Both Bonds and the Giants were pleased with Friday's meeting. 
"In layman's terms, it was a sharing-and-caring ses­sion. We were listening to their concerns," Giants gen­eral manager Brian Sabean said. 
Because of Bonds' age and failure to win, it's unclear how many teams are both interested and have enough money to sign Bonds. The Giants are not among base­ball's top spenders. 
"Can I compete with the Yankees' payroll? The an~wer is no," Sabean said. "But can I compete to sign Barry? Yes." 
Sosa, who hit .328 last sea­son with 64 homers and a major league-leading 160 RBIs, got the first-place votes of Teddy Greenstein of the Chicago Tribune and Mike Kiley of the Chicago Sun­Times. 
He was followed in the vot­ing bu by Arizona outfielder Luis Gonzalez (261 points) and St. Louis infielder-out­fielder Albert Pujols (222), who became the first NL rookie to finish as high as fourth since pitcher Joe Black was third in 1952. 
Pujols had the high est fin­ish by a rookie in either league since 1975, when Fred Lynn was voted the AL MVP and Boston teammate Jim Rice finished third. The only other rookie to finish higher than Pujols was Boston Braves shortstop Alvin Dark, third in 1948. 
Bonds gets a $100,000 bonus for winning the award, while Sosa gets $100,000 for finishing second. 
The American League MVP is announced today. 
Olympic flame 
begins journey 
Associated Press 
The Olympic flame began its journey to Salt Lake City on Monday, carrying hopes that the Winter Games can bring solace to a nation in mourning and at war. 
The flame was displayed in a traditional ceremony among the ruins of the ancient birth­place of the Olympics. 
But clouds and rain prevent­ed the ritual lighting of the flame using the sun's rays on a concave mirror. A flame ignit­ed in the mirror during an ear lier practice session was used instead. The name had been kept burning in lamps. 
It was the third consecutive time -dating to the 1998 Nagano Games -that the torch was not lighted during the official ceremony because of bad weather in Ancient Olympia, about 135 miles southwest ofAthens. 
"The forebears of Olympians, of civilization, of humanity looked beyond them­selves to find the source of greatness and of light. May we look to the eternal source to guide our world today,"said Mitt Romney, head ofSalt Lake City organizing committee. 
Greek actress Thalia Prokopiou, in her role as high priestess during the ceremony, used the flame to light the Salt Lake City torch at a grove of cypress trees dedicated to Pierre de Coubertin, the French baron who revived the Olympics more than a century ago. 
The first leg of the torch relay was run by Lefteris Fafalis, a Greek cross-country skier. 
Greek runners will carry the torch to a ski center near the ancient ruins of Delphi. It is scheduled to arrive in Athens on Tuesday and burn in the all-marble Panathenian stadi­um, site of the first modern Olympics in 1896. 
The torch then heads by plane to Atlanta on Dec. 3. The 65-day relay across the United States ends at the opening cer­emony in Salt Lake City on Feb. 8. The route passes through all the U.S. states except Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Hawaii. 
Police will also accompany the flama in a sign of the heightened worries following Sept. 11, Romney said. 
"The torch is an important symbol which we wish to pro­tect,"said Romney, who was accompanied by Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt and U.S. Olympic Committee president Sandy Baldwin. 
Ancient Olympia Mayor Giorgos Aidonis hoped the torch relay will "warm the hearts of people." 
The Olympics were held in Ancient Olympia from 776 B.C. to 394, when the Roman Emperor Theodosius abolished them after Christianity took root and he deemed the games pagan. 
The president of the Greek Olympic Committee, Lambis Nikolaou, said the flame's long journey could convey a spirit of unity "at a time when humanity is shaken by tragic events." 
He also announced that 17 foreign ministers, including those of Israel and the Palestinian Authority, had signed a declaration in support of an Olympic Truce during the Salt Lake City Games. 
The effort -spearheaded by Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou -seeks to revive the ancient tradition of sus­pending conflicts during the Olympics. 
"Because of the tragic events of Sept. 11, we see this as the first time that the world has come together to heal, ... that fate has fallen upon Salt Lake City to be the place and we will be ready," Leavitt said.

It's tlw only way I know to say thank you.

My last hmm game in Notre Damn Stadium, against a team not-so-good. 
No, I'm not a player. just a know-it-all obnoxious fan. But attachment comes with the territory When you love the most sto­ried team in the land. 
Like 1900 in my class. I start­ed school hen just over three years ago, 
With dreams of classruom

The defending national champs, the Michigan . Wolverines rolled in for game one, 
A 36-20 Irish win, and we all 
stormed the field 
Thinking waking up echoes 
would always be so much fun. 
But there were some bad 
losses along the \vay (try the 
next week at MSU), 
Although most have come on 
the road. it seems. away from 
the !louse of Knute. 
Yet there was a day in 
September of 2000, when num­
ber one Nebraska rolled into 
town. 
Most thought Notre Dame had no shot. evidenced by all the Husker fans 
And the abundance of tickets that they found. 
The Irish trailed 21-7 in the third and the skeptics stated their points, 
"It's simple, Notre Dame just can't rompetn, not with what this schedule appoints." 
But along came a man named Jones. follow1!d by a guy c,1Ued "Joey G," 
Ami of all of a sudden the game was tied, The air overf1owing with chants o(' "We arc ND." 
Of course that game went to overtime. and tlrn Irish took a three point lead,

But whether 3-5 or 8-0, I 
knew my last game at home might br a little hard. 

So l showed up an hour early, flashing an usher my soon-to­expirn ID card. 
I tried to explain to my junior roommate just how strange it felt to be at the end, 
Sitting on a wooden bench and talking about a brick stadi­um, 
Knowing I was saying good­bye to a friend. 
My words trailed off a lot. building emotions coming close to turning to water, 
They were just doing drills on the field, how would I get through the Alma Mater? 
But then the game started, and despite the less than rivet­
ing drama that would ensue, 
I was more thankful than ever that this was the school, and the team. 
That I did so long ago choose. And just an aside, a small postscript to my thanks: When the game ended, to my surprise, 
I did not shed a tear. 
I think those tears are on hold, my friends, Waiting to see if Davie will be our coach next year.

MEN'S BASKETBALL 
Macura steps up at as ND tops Cornell, 78-48 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Associate Spores Editor 
Confidence is key !'or Jeri' Macura. 
Last season, tbe forward spPn t most of the time on tlw bPnch while Troy Murphy. Ryan Ilumphrey and Harold Swanagan got most of thP playing timP. !IP didn't get in tlw game much, and whPn hP did, he \Vasn't vPry produc­tive. 
But with Humphrey serving the final game of' his suspen­sion and Swanagan hampered by a knee injury, Macura was the dominant inside force Monday night. He scored 16 points as Notre Dame rolled to a 78-48 win over Cornell. 
"I think his attitude is great brcause he's playing. Kids need to play," Notre Dame head coach Mike Brey said. "It was tough last year to get him into the mix. It was tough to get him in there as a fourth big man... this year, we need him to give us some minutes." 
Macura scored nine points during a 15-0 Irish run _in the first half that blew the game wide open. including a three­pointer from the top of the key and a thunderous dunk that drew a foul. He finished the game 7-of-9 from the field and recorded eight rebounds. 
'Tm more confident. Way more." he said. "Coach has more confidence in me. and I've got more confidence in myself." 
Although Swanagan didn't practice Sunday after his kneecap slipped out of place during Friday night's game, he entPred the game just three and a half minutes into the first half. Ile recorded ni1H! points and Pight rnbounds in 23 minutes of action. 
Jordan Cornette started in Swanagan·s place and played 29 minutes in just his second college game. 
"I felt good !Sunday] and last night, and today felt pret­ty good," Swanagan said. "They just wanted to know what I felt before the let me go out and play." 
Notre Dame didn't have much trouble against an undersized and inexperienced Big Red squad. The Irish defense, which forced 22 Cornell turnovers, kept the Big Red out of sync all night long. Each time Cornell seemed to gain any offensive momentum. the Irish switched from their traditional rnan-to­man defense into a 2-3 zone. 
"l thought there were times where we got in a rhythm, and then Mike went right to the zone and said, 'We're not going to mess around with this, chasing those guys around,' " Cornell head coach Steve Donahue said. "It was a great call. We didn't feel com­fortable against it, and we hadn't really practiced against it." 
"Our defense in the first half 
was real solid, especially 
when we went tu the zone," 
Notre Dame's Chris Thomas 
said. "We were able to rest a 
little bit but at the same time 
get out in the passing lane 
and disrupt their flow of the 
game and their style of' play." 
Donahul1 was impressed 
with the play of Thomas, Matt 
Carroll and David Graves. J\ 
game after rcicording Notre Dame's first-ever triple-dou­ble. Thomas f'inislrnd with a game-high 22 points, six assists and six rebounds. II!i shut 7-of-14 from the field, including 6-ol'-7 from thnw­point range. Carroll bounr:Pd back from a poor shooting pPrformance against New l lampshirn to l'inish with 13 points. Graves had trouble finding tlrn basket Monday, hitting on only 3-of-11 finld goals. but he still picked up 10 points. 
"I was just real impressed with tlw three perinrnter guys," Donahue said. "They 
have  as  good  as  perimeter  
players a·s  you 'II  see  in  the  
country."  

Both· tPams stayed relatively close throughout the early part of the first half until Notre Dame took control with a 22-3 run that spanned 
11 :23. The Irish entered the locker room with a 39-21 lead at the half. 
Cody Topport -one of' seven freshmen on Cornell's roster -led the Big Red in scoring with 1(, points. Chris Vandenburg and Ka'Ron Barnes added eight points apiece. 
Notre Dame next heads to Hawaii to compete in thn Hawaii Pacific UnivPrsity Thanksgiving Classic. Their first round opponent is Hawaii Pacific. The Irish could poten­tially meet Hampton. who qtrnlified for lho l\CJ\J\ tour­nament last season and upset No. 20 North Carolina 77-69 Friday night, in tlrn third and final round. 
'Tm excited lo get going," Brey said. "I think our guys am excited, and it's a grpat trip for our seniors ... I'm happy we can do something like this, especially f'or Graves and Swanagan."

MEN'S CROSS COUNTRY 
Irish finish sixth at Nationals 
By KATIE HUGHES Sports W ricer 
GREENVILLE, S.C. 
Thev ended their most suc­cessfu·I season in recent history the sam(' way they began: as a team committed to each other and to a common goal.
 Their goal going in had been a National Championship, hut as the race unfolded it became clear that the best team the Irish had evrr had would come away from tlrn strongest field the NCAA had ever had without a national title. but still !Paving thf'ir indf'lible mark on college cross country, placing sixth at Mondav's national meet. Seni~r Luke Watson finished fifth in 29:19 right ahead of senior Rvan Shay, who finished sixth in 29:23. Sophomore Todd Mobley finished 38th in 30:09. "Having two finishers in the top 10 is an accomplishment for any team." said Watson. who 11 as seventh in last year's \CA\ meet. The Irish have become a team that has come to expect nothing less from itself than flawless performances. A Big East Championship. A Great Lakes Regional Championship. Second in the Pre-National meet. 
Ranked No. 4 going into the 
meet, the Irish had hoped Lim return of Shay, who had been suffering from an injured Achilles. and senior I'at Conway, who had heen battling a chest cold, would be enough to upset Colorado and Stanford. 
Colorado won the team race with 90 points, followed by Stanford with 91 points. 
Though Notre Dame had fin­ished serond to Colorado in the Pre-National nrnet, the Buffaloes boasted three run­ners in the top 15 and a fifth man who finished 47th. Arkansas was third with 118 points, whiln Northern Arizona was fourth with 193. regional rival Wisconsin was fifth with 245 points and Notre Damn had 248 points. 
"As a team we're probably a little disappointed," said Shay. "I don't think we did as well as we wanted to. Our fifth man wasn't whnre he should have been. Pat Conway had been really sick. and that's obviously going to have an eITect." 
Far from disappointing, though, was the support the team got from the loudest cheering section at the meet. Seven carloads of teammates and friends, painted blue and gold, ran madly between van­tage points on the course to

WOMEN'S CROSS COUNTRY 
King leads Irish to 19th 
By KATIE McVOY As~ociate Sports Editor 
GREENVILLE. S.C. 
At the beginning of this season. the expectations for the Irish were not vnry high. But a successful season raised those expectations and left the team proud of how far it had come, but slightly disappointed with its finish in the NCAA National Cross Country Championship. 
"We didn't run as well as we wanted to coming in hf're," head coach Tim Connelly said of his team's 19th place l1nish Monday. "I was hoping we'd be in the top 15. I thought we'd run better than we did." 
The runners agreed. 
"[The race] was not nearly as good as we could have placed." junior Jen Handley said. "We had a lot of people who just h 0 ~d mediocre per­formances. 
But all the talk was not talk of disappointment. Last sea­son, the Irish didn't make it to the national m1rnt and, coming into this season, \/otre Dame was rated low in tho region and was unranked in the nation. The 19th place finish left the Irish in a good position to start off next sea­son. 
"That's great. I mean, I told our kids before the regionals, I think a year from now we've got the makings of a great team, you know. a top 10 place team," Connelly said. "So we've got to get to the meet and experience it and that's what we did today."' 
"It was a pretty solid show­ing." first-year runner Lauren King said. "We're a young team and we now have somewhere to work up from." 
King went home an All­American. The freshman fin­ished first for the Irish. her 21:17 time earning her 23rd place overall. 
"I take it one race at a time," King said. "Each day you can only run as best you can on that day. Today I was fortunate enough in this race to make All-American." 
King was the only Irish runner to finish in the top 100 runners. 
Junior Jen Handley fin­ished in 22:24. crossing the finish line in 101st place. 
Like many of the runners. she knew that racing at this level requires experience. 
"I was so happy to be here, just ready to go," she said. "At the end of the season, my body's just tired. A lot or it is I have to learn to race at this level." 
Handley wasn't the only runner who was feeling a lit­tle tired at the· end of the season. Following last week­end's regional meot, the Irish

Irish earn NCAA bid at Maryland 
By CHRIS FEDERICO Sports Writer 
The men's soccer team heard the news at about 3 p.m. Monday -Notrn Dame earned a berth in the NCAA College Cup for the first time since 1996. 
After an impressive regular sea­son in which the I r i s h worked to a 12-5 record and a sec­ond place finish in th11 Big East conf'erence. the Irish players were confidente they had done enough to receive the invitation, and Monday con­firmed their hopes. 
"I think we're good, and I 

think tlw team is very excited about being in the tourna­ment," head coach Bobby Clark. "Also we'll be playing two teams that we hav11n't played. I think that's also excit­ing." · 
The Irish will travel to Maryland Friday to take on the Terrapins on their home field. The winner of that match will face MAAC Champion Loyola. who earned a first-round bye with their 16-1-2 record during the regular season. 
Taking to the road for the first-round contest should not be too overwhelming for the Irish, who have played 10 of their 18 games on the road already this year. 
"The way our schedule has been this year, we seem to have been on the road pretty often," Clark said. "We're a well-trav­
