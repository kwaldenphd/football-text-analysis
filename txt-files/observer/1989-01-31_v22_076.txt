Sports Illustrated sinks with swimsuit issue 
Hey guys, it's just one week away. 
You've been waiting for it since last February; it's the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. 
Now you can get your cheap thrills under the auspices of a legitimate "sports" magazine. 
Forget the humiliation of having to walk into a store and face the cashier who looks like the babysitter you had when you were seven and actually buy your soft-core pornography. Or take the ribbing from your dorm mail person for your monthly black wrapped arrival. Mter all, imagine your mother's disappointment if by some accident your Playboy or Penthouse subscription were to find its way to your horne during the summer. 
But what could be safer than Sports Il­lustrated? Your mother probably gave you your subscription for your thirteenth birthday. Maybe she renews it every year for Christmas. 
In keeping with the tradition of the past twenty-five years, America's most popular publication devoted to sports will abandon shots of muddy football players grinding one another into the dirt and sweaty basketball players get­ting elbowed and will for one week instead deluge its readers, lucky women inclusive, with photos of bodacious females wrapped in, well, almost nothing. 
Harmless, you say. Hardly, I say. 
Two prevailing sentiments can be found at Notre Dame. There are men with bad attitudes about women and women with bad attitudes about themselves. The swimsuit issue propagates both. 
Men have a host of excuses for why exactly they "read" this issue. Simple aesthetic ap­preciation of beautiful women, for example. The high caliber of the photographs, for an­other. Or maybe it's a chance to see the exotic locations. Maybe it's art. The legally minded claim freedom of the press. 
The swimsuit issue has nothing to do with swimsuits and nothing to do with photography. The issue at hand is not the issue itself, but rather what it stands for and what it leads to. 
The swimsuit issue is plainly and simply a representation of women as sexual objects and playthings. 
Moreover, it leads the reader to a false ex­pectation of what women really are like. It seems the fitness craze has made very little progress in reforming the ideas of what a wo­man's body should look like from the Twiggy look of the Sixties. The ideal Barbie-like figure seems to prevail, although now women are sup­posed to have muscles too and look good in Spandex. 
The swimsuit issue is an opportunity for Notre Dame men to compare women at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's to the women in the photos. Look around you. Think about the most beau-

tiful woman you know. I mean personally. Or 
that cute girl in your 1: 15 class. 
But compare her to the goddesses in SI and 
she probably looks pretty homely. And she 
surely looks pretty fat. 
Now look at the guys in your classes. Are 
they trim, athletic deities? In some cases, per­
haps. · 
Do women on campus really eat more ice 
cream than men? Do they wear sweats more 
often? What if by general female decree we 
made it socially unacceptable to, say, wear ,baseball caps to brunch on the weekends? 
It's true that women criticize men, physically 
and otherwise, but in no such conspiritive way. 
There is no national campaign in which women 
devote a week to gazing at photos and wishing 
their husbands and boyfriends looked like Greg 
Louganis or Torn Selleck. Most women would 
be too busy to do that anyway. 
Women on this campus are an easy target. 
Boys will be boys, it can be argued, but boys 
grow into men who become fathers and leaders 
and influencers. The damage done through 
subtle subjugation of women like the swimsuit 
issue is not negligible. 
Men on this campus spend a lot of time com­plaining about the women here and very little time doing anything about it. The same guys who will spend half of next week drooling over SI (their roommates will have their copies the other half) will most likely spend next weekend sitting around a dorm room, drinking beer and talking about how ugly and boring the women here are. 
If you would try actually (gasp) asking one out or getting to know one, you might actually discover, despite the normal proportions and looks, she could be a genuinely interesting per­son.

parking lot was created to 
reduce crowding in D-2, the stu­
dent parking lot for most North 
Quad dorms, Johnson said. 
"D-2 was crowded, and there 
was a reluctance to park near 
the back. C-5 should substan­
tially reduce the crowding in 
D-2 and be more convenient for 
the residents of Breen-Phillips, 
Farley, Siegfried and Knott 
Halls," he said. 

Security has sent letters to the four halls' residents whose cars are currently registered in D-2, Johnson said. "Residents of these dorms may trade in their D-2 decals for C-5 decals at no expense," he added. 
The new lot, designed to ac­commodate a maximum 170 of cars, "cost about $85,000, which included fencing and lighting."

The bottom line of public ser­vice is "You can change the world," according to Father Theodore Hesburgh, who spoke in a lecture Monday for the Hesburgh Program in Public Service. 
"I have to confess from the onset, I never in my life had a class in public policy," ad­mitted Hesburgh. He claimed that all of his knowledge in the public policy area came from practical experience, starting in 1954 with an appointment to the board of the National Sci­ence Foundation by President Eisenhower, and continuing even today. 
There are two kinds of public service, according to Res­burgh. The first is in the gov­ernment area, and the second in the private sector.

In the public sector, Res­burgh said he has served on such commissions as the Na­tional Commission on Civil Rights, the State Department Commission on Education and Cultural Mfairs and as an am­bassador to the United Nations. 
In the private sector, Res­burgh has served the Rockefel­ler Foundation to alleviate such problems as world hunger. 
Although he played many roles in the shaping of public policy in past administrations, Hesburgh said all he did under President Reagan was get "shot at in El Salvador." He was sent down to the country to check the running of the na­tional elections there. 
Having once declined a posi­tion as Director of NASA, Res­burgh explained that he tried to take only those jobs that per­tained to either Notre Dame or his priestly service. Hesburgh added, "I try not to attach myself to a political party-I'm an independent." 


Being involved in so many projects at once takes a lot of time, even if is a part-time job, said Hesburgh, but "It's a sat­isfying thing if you can get something done." He added, "Wherever you go, in the world, you meet interesting people," which is an added benefit to working in the area of public service. 
"I was pretty square," ad­mitted Hesburgh, who said he had to give up golf, bridge and all remnants of a social life in order to keep up with his work schedule. 
One of the greatest rewards of public service is that "You can face God at the end of life and say, 'I tried to love my neighbor,"' said Hesburgh.

"The Lilly Endowment grant will be used not only to es­tablish the position of the MINT director, but also to institute programs  that increase minority enrollment by meeting the academic and so­cial needs of these students," he said. 
Saint Mary's is also taking further steps to inform stu­dents about the plight of minority students by bringing in several speakers, such as the poet Gwendolyn Brooks and Jacob Holdt, renowned lecturer and author of "American Pic­tures." 
In the 1970's, Holdt traveled throughout the U.S. and re­corded his observations of the poverty-stricken he encoun­tered. In his book, he says he believes many people in the United States are unaware of the plight of the under­privileged. 
"Holdt saw and experienced much of the human deprivation that many of us are not even aware of," said Joseph Incan­dela, assistant professor of re­ligious studies at Saint Mary's. 
Holdt has lectured at several universities, including Har­vard, Yale and the University of California at Berkley. His presentation will take place

New national health care system is proposed 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON--A commis­sion including three former presidents proposed a national health care system Mondaay that would ensure access to basic. medical services for all Americans with financing by all but the poorest. 
The system is designed to ex­tend health care to the esti­mated 37 million Americans who are uninsured, to curtail soaring health costs and to im­prove the quality of medical care nationwide, said the Na­tional Leadership Commission on Health Care. 
The proposed "strategy of providing access by asking every American to take respon­sibility for his or her own care and to assume a very small share of the cost of those who cannot assume that responsi­bility is eminently fair," the commission said in its report. 
Without change in the na­tion's health care system, costs are expected to grow from the current $550 billion a year to $1.5 trillion by the year 2000, said Paul Rogers, a former Democratic congressman from Florida who co-chaired the commission with former Iowa Gov. Robert Ray, a Republi­can. 
The commission-supported by 38 corporations, unions and foundations-spent two-and-a­half years preparing . the 

report.  Three  former  
presidents- Richard  Nixon,  
Gerald  Ford  and  Jimmy  

Carter-served as honorary co­chairmen. 
The proposed system would continue a major role for private insurance coverage and would encourage employers to extend such coverage to more employees. 
All Americans would be cov­ered by a basic package of medical services, which would be the minimum coverage for all private health insurance plans and for a publicly funded benefits pool. 
Many workers would con­tinue to get privately financed coverage as an employment benefit, with the employer paying most or all of the premium, and they could add to that coverage ifthey wanted. Also the federal Medicare in­surance program for older and disabled Americans would con­tinue. 
Everyone else would be cov­ered by the pool called the Uni­versal Access program. Medicaid, the federal health in­surance program for the poor, would be abolished and its recipients would be covered by the new program. 


The Universal Access pool would be financed by all employers and by all individ­uals not covered by Medicare who have incomes above 150 percent of the poverty level. The schedule of fees would be designed to encourage employers to offer coverage to employees and improve coverage under some existing plans. 
"There is strong incentive to keep the pool of people falling into the public sytsem as small as it can be," said Uwe Rein­hardt, a Princeton University professor of economics and member of the commission.

Chaos reigns in ticket line

guest column 

All hell broke loose as one over­zealous student made a break for the Gate 10 entrance at the Joyce ACC on Friday. And to think I took that class, Psychology of The Mob 101, just for kicks. Finally, a chance to put my class-· room knowledge to good use. So what did I do when the whole mob broke and ran for the entrance? Let me just say that while the will of a mob is a powerful thing, individual will is stronger. I walked, sacrificing a good place, but preserving my dignity. I did, however, beat the guy on crutches. It was rather easy after I kicked them from under his arms. There was a lesson to be learned from the witty repartee that took place too. 
When the mob finally silenced, and a student in the front said, "They're out of tickets," he was greeted with a cheery chorus of "Crucify him, crucify him!" And judging by the collective

Unfortunately, it was short people like myself who suffered. We were crushed, our hands were pinned, and we couldn't get any air. Now I was de­termined to get a ticket for myself and that special someone who would be my companion, but I would never resort to 
screaming, "I gotta puke, I gotta puke," just to get a better position. There had to be a better way. There was "Look, there goes Lou Holtz!" Then came the shock. 
Someone screamed, "Monk, Monk!" What a relief. Father Malloy could straighten out his "Notre Dame com­munity." But imagine my shock when I saw Monk try to bite someone. Worse yet, Monk was now down among the feet of the angry mob. In his defense, I think he was more scared than angry. I guess I should mention that Monk was someone's pet dog, but nevertheless, what kind of place was this for animals? Er, rather, what kind of place 
was  this  for  domesticated  animals?  
Surely  we  were  teaching  him  bad  
habits.  

But wait! The guy with the megap­hone came up with a better idea-­

"Please form two lines." I had to ad­mit, it was twice as good as his first idea. I guess I should probably make an honest attempt at rectifying this all­too-frequent Notre Dame experience. Well, here goes. 
Giving credit where credit is due, I liked the idea of one of the students in front of me--selling the tickets. This would discourage those who really have little interest. But if they stood in 'line that long under those circumstances, surely they wanted the tickets? I assure you that many people would have preferred to leave when things started getting nasty, but there was no way to get out. We were literally sardines in a can. 
Another bonus, Keenan Hall could donate the admission fees to charity. What better way for the Notre Dame community to prove our commitment to improved relations with the local communities? Distribution might also work better if they formed lines by the first digit of our student ID's. I'll admit it, it was humorous at times, but it was also disgusting. 
All I'm saying is there must be a bet­ter way. And to that special person who will get the opportunity to accompany me, I say, "If you knew what I went through to get these tickets, you'd think of a better excuse than 'I have to wash my clothes that night.'"

P.O. Box Q 
Soviet promises remain empty 
Dear Editor: 
When, oh when, will we learn? How many times will the West be duped into accepting the empty promises of the new leadership of the Kremlin? Will the true nature of Mr. Gorbachev's "reform" movement ever be told? 
The latest atrocity in Afghanistan should come as no surprise to the West. The slaughter of civilians has become a way of life in the "Soviets' Vietnam" (a ludicrous analogy, yes, but one the media enjoys using). For the inventors of the toy bomb (an explosive shaped like dolls used to teach Afghan children the meaning of war), senseless killing has become commonplace, a blurb on the 6 p.m. news. The hundreds of inno­cent victims caught under Soviet ar­tillery bombardment last week were not so lucky. 
What should the West's response be, then, to the Soviet slaughter of civilians and the creation of tension so thick that our embassy had to be closed? Our out­rage should take the form of the only policy the Soviet Union has ever understood--that is, swift and deliberate action. Stinger missles, rifles, and bandages for the Mujahedeen are the answer, and ship­ment should begin immediately. Press conferences and Congressional denun-

ciations will not turn back the best equipped war machine the world has ever known. 
Let us judge Mr. Gorbachev by the same standard our own leaders must exist under. If Mikhail Gorbachev knew of this raid, he is a baby-killing monster who deserves only the enmity of the West. If he did not know he should have, and a re-examination of Mr. Gorbac­hev's role and power is in order. Whatever the case, murdering hundreds of civilians to protect escape routes is not the kind of policy we have come to expect from leaders committed to peace. 
Nothing of any importance has, changed in the Soviet Union. Commu­nist revolutions are still funded across the globe, vicious pass-laws continue to restrict travel and freedom, babies still die in what many have termed the most brutal war in all of history. Prove me wrong when I disagree that Mr. Gor­bachev renounces the ideology of per­sonal and economic slavery. Free thousands of Jews who yearn for freedom of worship. Tear the Berlin Wall down and open up your client states to free elections. Keep your word, and remove your occupying forces from every inch of Afghan soil. Until then, all the West has is a basket­ful of empty promises.

In becoming the third team this season to hold the No. 1 spot, the Sooners received 32 of the 66 first-place votes cast by the nationwide panel of sportswriters and broadcasters and finished with 1,273 points to edge IlliJlois in the balloting. 
When Illinoi~ lost Thursday night, it appeared Georgetown would move up one place to the top spot, but the Hoyas were upset by Louisiana State 82-80 on Saturday. 
Louisville was next in line for a chance at No. 1, but the Car­dinals lost at home to Ohio State 85-79 Sunday. 
To show the wide range of opinion on who deserved the top ranking, six teams received first-place votes. 
North Carolina, 18-3, jumped from seventh to third with four first-place votes and 1,074 points, 19 more than Arizona, 15-2, which improved two places and was named No. 1on one ballot. 
Missouri, 18-3, stayed fifth. The Tigers had three first­place votes and 1,048 points. 
Georgetown, which fell to 15­2 with the loss to Louisiana State, dropped from second to sixth with 1,019 points arid the final first-place vote. 
Louisville was seventh with 1,011 points after having its 14­game winning streak snapped and falling to 14-3. 
Florida State, 16-1, moved from 11th to eighth with 797 points and Iowa, 15-3, jumped from 12th to ninth with 651 points, 13 more than Seton Hall, 18-2, which rounded out the Top Ten after being ninth last week. 
Michigan dropped one spot to lead the Second Ten and was followed by Duke, North Carolina State, Syracuse, Ohio State, Nevada-Las Vegas, In­diana, West Virginia, Louisiana State and Stanford. 
always be there. But right now, Dayton is just looking for a good road win. They've got some confidence after winning three of their last four on the road, and we'd be a nice team for them to beat. 
"You have to be on guard against them because they can shoot (three-pointers) when they need to. But nothing changes with us. We want to keep playing a transition game when we can. This is a very talented basketball team that's just waiting to explode. I just hope it's not against us."
