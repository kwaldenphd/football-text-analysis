In the Campus Ufe Council's first meeting of the year, the council modified and passed the two resolu­tions passed by the Student Senate on Monday night. 
The on-campus resolution passed by the CLC eliminated all specific references to possible available loca­tions to house males who would ot­herwise be lotterled off campus. This means that any available loca­tion will be considered if It is deemed appropriate by the Univer­sity. 
The off-campus resolution recom­mended that Student Affairs authorize a committee to be ap­pointed by the CLC that would look into the various problems of the Nonheast Neighborhood. Fr. John Van Wolvlear subsequently aut­horized the committee. 
The CLC passed the on-campus resolution after it was agreed that all partlc:s were on "the same ground" as far as existing space was con­cerned. This space included the two Pa~qucrilla floors, Villa Angela, and Vincent flail. 
Fr. (ireg Green, assistant vice president ofstudent affairs, reported that Villa Angela may not be available to the Unlversuty next year. lla also stated that Vincent docs not belong to the University and that It may not be available for student housing next year. 
Fr. Van Wolvlear stated that some of the housing problem is being caused by the University's attempt to alleviate the crowded conditions 
in several mak dorms. He stated that these decisions would not be reversed. 
. 
Regarding the coed issue, Fr. Van Wolvlear stated that as long as Fr. Hesburgh Is president ofthe Univer­sity, there would be no coed dorms. He also reported that if the females do not want males living in their dorms, that going coed "will not happen." 
Frank Tighe suggested that it might be "worth it for the llnversity to forego the precedent of not having coed housing. The oppor­tunity cost to the University is 1282,400." Mark Kelley, off-campus commissioner, said that, in this case, the coed issue should be designated as having a temporary status. 
Kelley also suggested that the date ofthe lottery be moved up to April 1 or 2 so that the students that get lot­teried off-campus have more time to look for houses before Easter. Hep­pen told Student Body President Paul Riehle that a lottery would be held as soon a~ it is "logistically pos­sible."

cussed by the council were the

The fire depa.rtnlent'sconclusion that an electrical malfunction caused the MGM Grand Hotel fire in las Vegas reportedly is being challenged by hotel officials. The Las Vegas Sun said in a copyright story Tuesday that MGM hotels chairman Fred Benninger threatened to go to federal court in an effort to get copies o reports on the Nov. 21 fire, which killed 84 people. The Sun said Benninger wrote the Clark County Fire Department last week expressing reservations about "the soundness ofyour preliminary findings." Ben­ninger reportedly said the hotel's own investigators found no evidence that a short circuit was to blame. County Fire Chief Roy Parrish said the department would stand by its conclusion that the fire was electrical in nature. -AP. 
Fares on the South Shore Railroad could jump 
drasticallly on April 7 under a plan filed with three regulatory agencies. The fare increase is being considered by the Indiana Public Service Commission, the Illinois Commerce Commission and the In­terstate Commerce Commission, South Shore president A.W. Dudley said Tuesday. Although no hearing dates have been scheduled, public hearings are expected before April 9, authorities said. The railroad's last fare increase was granted in 1971. The increase already has received the blessing of the Northern Indiana Commuter Transpora­tion District and the lllinois Regional Transportation Authoritiy. Both oversee operations of the bi-state railroad. The largest increases would be levied against one-way tickets on South Shore's eastern end, including pick-up points in Michigan City and South Bend, Dudley said. Under the proposed rates, one-way tickets from South Bend to Chicago would increase from $3.10 to SS.SO; Michigan City to Chicago, 52.40 to S4; Gary to Chicago, $1.70 to S2.75; and Hammond to Chicago, Sl.SO to 52.25. -AP. 
Two menwho police said tripped an alarm and were caught redhanded with $100,000 worth of jewelry in a suburban lombard store have been charged with burglary. Police said Ronald Kilner, 20, who told them he was studying to become a lawyer at Northeastern Illinois University, also was charged with attempted bribery. He al­lt:gedly offered a lombard officer $10,000 to free him and his partner, Peter Pulice, 21, ofChicago. Investigators said the two men allegedly broke a skylight on the roofofthe Carson Pirie Scott & co. department store in a shopping plaza at 2 a.m. yesterday and dropped a rope down. After climbing down into the store, they stole a suitcase and filled it with jewelry, police said. But they tripped an alarm and within minutes police arrived. Authorities said they were arrested in the jewelry department with various types of jewelry in their possession.

Cross said his second album -tentatively titled "Deal 'Em Again" -is al­ready in the works, and that his backup vocalists will be "people you've heard of," including perhaps fellow Texan Don Henley of the rock group, the Eagles.

Some: final words    
As spring break approaches, a year inObserver time Is coming to a close. A new year will begin as a new editorial board takes over in a couple of weeks, and so we have decided to purge our notebook of some remaining notes and observations. Some final com­ments from a final Inside column.... 
President Reagan has completed his budget cuts, and they total up to over 548 billion. Overall, these cuts are highly laudable as Reagan works to pare down the federal deficit, but not everyone is happy, and not everyone is cooperating. Some are charging that the cuts are not substantial enough and not in the right places to really affect inflation. This may be true, but at least Reagan has installed immediate expectations of "less," and he is making a sincere effort to restrain the expansion ofthe g1uttonous federal bureaucrats. 
Liberals are not cooperating willingly, more as a mat­ter ofpride than anything. else apparently. All but one of the Senate committee chairmen requested sizable budget increases, even though we are all familiar with the widespread overbudgeting which occurs in the bureaucracy. Additionally, congressmen in both houses, ofboth parties, are taking an "everyone else but me" attitude toward specific budget cuts as they affect each person's constituency. 
A good example of this is Minority Leader Robert 
Byrd, who has been championing the cause of mine 
workers protesting in D.C. this week, because Reagan 
has targeted federal black lung assistance as a potential 
cut. logically, it should be the mine owners who are 
protesting, because the responsibility for this disability 
pension should be shifted to their shoulders. Perhaps 
Byrd should be directing his energies towards legisla­
tion in this area, rather than servicing the most vocal of 
his West Virginia constituents. 
The candidates who screamed for budget slashing (and those like Byrd, who promised to cooperate) are now having to respond to reductions in their own dis­trict/state's federal funds, transportation, even jobs. Voters can make these cuts politically injurious, and it will be interesting to see if the new conservatives will sacrifice their own well-being for the good of the program. It doesn't seem likely, but let's at least wait and give them a chance.... 
While we're on our favorite subject, Reagan, it should be noted that no small number ofseniors are expressing serious dismay over his selection as commencement speaker. The obvious ideological contradictions involv­ing Fr. Hesburgh, Notre Dame and Reagan (such as Reagan's Right to life stand and his determination to build enough warheads to disintegrate the Eurasian landmass) are reason enough to be upset. Add to that the pure publicity stunt ofbringing in Pat O'Brien, and a circus atmosphere is lent to a supposedly solemn occa­sion. A well-organized student protest would hold Fr. Hesburgh publicly accountable fo these apparent hypocrisies, and his response to the threat of an al­ternative graduation ceremony would be most interest­ingindeed.... 
locally, Paul Riehle was scheduled to convene the Campus Ufe Council for the first time last night. He will bring to it two proposals from the Student Senate regarding the housing lottery which Riehle obviously feels is already decided upon. One proposal calls for a faculty study of the Northeast Neighborhood, and should be passed immediately. The other proposal calls 


for coed living in the Pasquerilla dorms, and should be 
passed yesterday. It won't be. 
Although the top floors of each new dorm will go 
unoccupied next year, which Riehle estimates will cost 
the University $282,400, the Administration will no 
doubt reject the plan, if only because they have already 
established room pick procedures for next year. They 
will also argue that the proposal was hastily composed 
(which doesn't matter), and didn't take the time to gat­
her all the "input" (there's that word again) from the 
students. It doesn't matter ofcourse that at least three­
fourths ofthe students here favor coed living, and don't 
need to be asked again by their Senate representative. 
We hope we're wrong, but don't count on it.... 
The Chicago Tribune compiled an interesting Mid· west edition Tuesday morning. The exact same fol­lowup story and photo on the Steven Judy execution appeared on both page three and page six. A front-page story on El Salvador did not continue on page twelve, or anywhere for that matter. The page one feature on O'Hare Airport was continued, not on page three but the back page of the business section. And you thought The Observer was the only one that made mistakes.... 
The Inside column was a new concept this year, and it will be continued next year as well. The original idea was not that pompous news editors would spout off their ideological idiosyncrasies, but that we provide inside information or insights that we have gained by virtue ofbeing at the center ofcampus communication. We did provide interesting or confidential information at times throughout the year, and didn't have to worry about pressure from the Administration because they 
never read it. I had a good time writing it, and getting 
blasted regularly on the editorial page, though it is dif­
ficult to come up with something every week (witness 
this). This is my last one, and I hope my successors lm· 
prove on the basic standards we have tried to achieve 
thus far. Good luck....

Addresses Parliament 
Reagan ends Canadian visit 
01TAW A ( AP) President Reagan ended a two-day visit to Canada with a promise yesterday to revitalize the United States' economy, regain the respect of its allies and oppose "Soviet adven­
turism around the Earth." 
In a televised speech before the 
Canadian Parliament, the president 
confessed that "the United States in 
the last few years has not been as 
solid and stable an ally and trading 
partner as It should be." 
But he said his "near· 
revolutionary" economic program, 
submitted Tuesday to Congress, is 
intended not only to solve domestic 
problems but "to restore the con· 
fidence of our friends and allies in 
what we are doing." 
fie told Prime Minister Pierre El· 
liott Trudeau and his other Canadian 
hosts that a stimulated U.S. economy 
will produce millions of new jobs, 
many ofthem in Canada.

crime situation, the disturbances created by the students, relations between students and their neigh­bors, and University involvement in the situation. 
The committee, whose members will be appointed at the next CI.C meeting, will study and discuss these areas. The committee will con­sist of students, landlords, members of the Northeast Neighborhood Council, and University faculty nH'mhers. 
l'r. Van Wolvlear authorized the committee 10 give it validity. Riehle hoped that this might motivate com­mittee. members to realize that their work would have a "seriousness of purpose." 
Kdlcy stated that a faculty person "vitally Interested in the off-campus problem" would be ideal as chair­man and also serve to further legilimize the committee. 
Tht· relations between the stu­dents and their neighbors were con­sidered to he the most neglected issue. Dean Roemer reported tha he has already received three letters from neighborhood residents com­plaining about student disturbances. In a separate incident, students reportedly tore down the front porch ofa house. 
Fr. Mario Pedi, rector of St. Ed­ward's llall, said that an action such as the Senior Death March is detrimental to relations In the nelg­horhood. lit· expressed disappoint­ment about the lack ofreaction from the Student Government. 
Gene Bernstein, assistant profes­sor of English, suggested tha the council study other neighborhoods for possible student use. Sr. Patricia Dowd, Breen-Philips Hall rector, stated that the University would be criticized if it did not attempt social action in the Northeast Neighbor­hood. Kelley added that there would always be students living in the area because of the convenience and the number of students living off 
campus. 
plause, climaxed a visit in which both governments openly ack­nowledged their diJfcrences but expressed a common determination to find solutions. 
On his return to the White House yesterday afternoon, the president said, "It was a very fine meeting, real­ly. I think we established the basis for further working together. We were very pleased and I think they were, too. A very heart-warming ex­perience." 
Trudeau said that despite "deep disappointment" over U.S. withdrawal ofan East Coast fisheries treaty governing conservation and division offish stocks, the neighbor­ing nations had assured each other "there will be no fish war." 
The joint willingness to keep trying to reach some sort of agree­ment on the fishing issue, which has taken on national political sig­nificance in Canada, seemed sym­bolic of Reagan's brief visit to the Canadian capital. The problem 

wasn't solved, but both sides 
seemed pleased they could still talk 
about it. 
A variety ofother major disputes, involving environmental matters, energy policy and foreign affairs, came up during the visit, but no breakthroughs had been expected and none was announced. 
In his Parliament speech, Reagan stumbled over his text and inadver­tently dropped a reference to their problems, but the White House said he stood by the material he had skipped. 
"We have never hidden our disputes," he had intended to say, "but we have always found room for their resolution. The issues upon which we still seek agreement should therefore proceed down the same path of cooperation, negotia­tion and mutual understanding." 
Reagan aide Mike Deaver said Reagan stumbled over a portion of the text he had edited by hand and then could not read.

El Salvador rejects offer 

SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) 
The government yesterday rejected an offer by the Organiza­tion of American States to mediate a political settlement between El Sal­vador's civilian/military junta and the leftist-dominated opposition, Foreign Ministry sources said. 
In the capital and the countryside the guerrilla war continued. 
In Geneva, the United Nations Human Rights Commission called for the appointment ofa special rep­resentative to probe "grave viola­tions of human rights and fundamental freedoms reported in El Salvador." 
The Reagan administration has vowed to help prevent the spread of communist influence in Central America and has increased military aid to this nation of 4. 5 million people. Fifty U.S. advisers are here helping train Salvadoran troops.

SUMMER SESSION 1981. 
Washington has charged the Soviet Union, Cuba and Nicaragua with supporting Marxist insurrection here. 
One of the diplomatic sources here showed reporters an official message to the OAS that said "the revolutionary government of El Sal­vador does not desire the interven­tion ofthe Organization ofAmerican States in the search for a solution to the internal problems in El Sal­vador." 
T\)e message called OAS media­tion here "completely unacceptable." 
The 28-member organization offi­cially offered to mediate last week at the suggestion of Costa Rican Presi­dent Rodrigo Carazo. 
Junta President Jose Napoleon Du I rte has said he is willing to meet with members of Socialist Interna­tional to discuss a political solution, but the has been no indication where or when such a meeting would be held. 
The U.N. commission called for the apointment of a special repre­
sentative  by  a  29/I  vote.  Eleven  
countries,  including  the  United  
States, abstained.  

U.S. delegate Richard Shifter said 
the abstention was prompted by a reference in the adopted text to a 
U.N. General Assembly resolution last fall urging "governments to refrain from the supply of arms and other military assistance." He said the language was unclear; 
Fighting was reported yesterday in San Nicolas Lempa, 20 miles north of the capital, the army said, adding that a counter-insurgency operation began in the area four days ago. 
A military source said there were dead and wounded, but there were no details. 
Defense Minister Col. Jose Guil­lrmo Garcia said the army began a massive search and destoy operation Tuesday in Morazon, I00 miles east ofthe capital. 
Military sources said I,OOO troops were pressed into the operation. 
In Chalatenango, 30 miles north­east of here, I9 unidentified bodies were found along a highway outside oftown, the military said. 
Around the capital, three army convoys were ambushed, but no in­juries were reported, and shootouts between guerrillas and the military were reported in three suburbs during the morning hours. No casualities were reported. 

Pakistani hijackers announce deadline 
DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -The fathers oftwo ofthree hijackers hol­ding a Pakistani jet-liner with more than 100 hostages aboard flew here 
from  Pakistan  yesterday  to  plead  
with  the  youths  to  free  their  
captives, officials said.  

The hijackers meanwhile ex­tended to 11 a.m. EST today a deadline to blow up the plane and all aboard unless the Pakistani military government frees political prisoners. 
Syrian Foreign Minister Abdul Halim Khaddam said the hostages, who include three Americans and two U.S. resident aliens, were all "physically well but psychologically tired" from the I 0-day-old ordeal, history's second longest hijack drama. Palestinian guerrillas held I2 Israelis hostage for five weeks aboard an Israeli jetliner they hijacked to Algiers in 1968. 
Officials in Karachi, Pakistan, said the fathers ofSalamullah Khan Tippu and Abdul Nasir Khan flew to Damascus via Jidda, Saudi Arabia. Pakistani authorities were seeking the parents of the third hijacker, Ar­sad Butt. Tippu has been identified as the leader ofthe hijackers. 
One report said a brother of one of the hijackers also flew to Damascus. Another unconfirmed report was that two of the hijackers were brothers. 
The fathers flying to Damascus had been arrested after their sons went into hiding following a Feb. 26 clash at Kabrachi University in which a student was killed, Pakistani officials said. The hijackers are mem­bers ofa dissident group named after Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, former president who was hanged in 1979. 
Pakistani authorities said that 3C detainees whose names appeared on a Jist of 55 persons whose freedom was demanded by the hijacke~s were ready to fly to Damascus as soon as a settlement was reached for the release of the hostages. The number of hostages was estimated variously at 102-122. 
A Syrian government spokesman said the hijackers extended the blow-up deadline from 5 a.m., EST, Wednesday to 11 a.m. EST today at the insistance of negotiators headed by Brig. Gen. Mohammed Kholi, President Hafez Assad's top security aide. 
The Syrians then suspended the negotiations until the arrival late in the day of Pakistan's ambassador to Syria, Sarfaraz Khan from an inter­rupted vacation in Pakistan. Airport sources said he went to the control tower to talk to the hijackers by radio. 

The hijackers seized the Pakistan International Airline Boeing 720 on a domestic flight and flew to Kabul, Afghanstan, and then to Damascus. First they demanded that 92 politi­cal opponents of President Mohammed Zia u!Haq' authoritarian military rule be freed. But Pakistan offered to release only 15 political prisoners held for minor offenses in addition to five relatives of the sky­jackers. 
Angered by the offer, the hijackers last Friday picked a Pakistani diplomat from among the hostages, shot him and threw him out of the plane at Kabul airport, officials said. He died in an Afghan hospital later in the day.

The Observer Thursday, March 12, 1981 -page 5 Retirement program 
Experts suggest changes 

WASHINGTON (AP) The chairman ofthe Senate Budget Com­mittee and Congress' top economist suggested surgery yesterday on an­nual cost-of-living increases in Social Security benefits. 
Although President Reagan has not recommended such a move, Sen. Peter Domenici, R-N.M., said he doubted the president "could afford to be critical" if Congress voted changes in Social Security cost-of­living increases as part of a package ofspending cuts. 
Changes such as those suggested would affect I 0 million people or more a year and could cut spending by more than S3 billion in I982 alone. 
Domenici and Dr. Alice Rivlin, head of the Congressiona Budget Office, both suggested changes in the governmnt's basic retirement program as Democrats on the House Budget Committee sharply chal­lenged lcnged the administration's rosy forecasts of lower inflation and interest rates ad higher growth. 
This endless walkway behind O'Shaughnessy Hall mirrors the long duys ofMurch prior to spring break. (photo Uyjohn Macor) The administration says its 
package of spending and tax cuts will help lower inflation to about I I percent this year, slightly over 8 per­cent in 1982 and about 6 percent in 1983. It also predicts rapid decline ofinterest rates and sharp economic growth next year. 
"We are not going to put out a budget bas~d on mirrors and magic. We are not going to put out a budget based on a.~sumptions which six months or a year from now will be held up to ridicule," Rep. James 
Jones, D/Okla., the panel's chair­man, told Murray Weidenbaum, chairman of the president's Counil on Economic Advisers. 

Jones said Americans "will rise up in anger" if they discover they have been deceived by the president's rosy projections of economic revitalization. 
At a hearing one day after Reagan unveiled his revised 1982 budget of 1695.3 billion, including a deficit of $45 billion, Wcidenbaum said the budget "is as honest and accurate" as possible. 
But across the capital, Rivlin told Senate budget writers Congress should approve more than the 148.6 billion in spending cuts that Reagan is recomending so spending can be kept under control ifthe president's "optimistic" forecasts about infla­tion, interest rates and economic growth go unmet. 

The consequences of being wrong "are troubling," Rivlin said. 
"Higher inflation, higher interest rates and higher unemployment would all work to produce more federal spending and larger hudgt·t d<.·ficits." 
"To avoid thl' risk of heing wrong on the outlook for inflation, the committee might want to consider alternative spending cuts that would redu<-·e the sensitivity of the federal budget to inflation, or to cut more deeply than proposed by the ad­ministration." 
She said a "major omission" in te administration's proposal is a lack of change in the adjusting for inflation of Social Security and other federal retire"'lcnt plans. 
Sperm banks becoming more common 
By ASSOCIATED PRESS Sperm banks -not yet so common as the comer pharmacy -are starting to move from the medical laboratory to the storefront, buying sperm from outside donors and selllng it to infertile couples. The San Fernando Valley's first sperm bank has just opened, an Encino concern called Valley Cryobank. And a local physician who's been In the business of storing human sperm at ultra· cold temperaures for four years says business Is booming. "We're busier than ever, and I think that's partly due to ln­<.·reased social acceptance and in­creased social awareness," said Dr. Cappy Rothman, a Century City androloglst -a doctor who specializes in treating infertile men. Sperm banks hit the headlines recently when Robert Graham announced that his repository for Germinal Choice in Escondido was seeking sperm from Nobel Prize winners to impregnate women with high IQs and there­by produce offspring of superior Intelligence.

back toward economic sanity" Is the proposal for a three-year, 30 percent cut in tax rates. That plan is ques­tioned by many In Congress, Includ­Ing Republicans, and is the portion of the Reagan program given the least chance for approval. 
Cutting government spending Is a goal with almost universal support In Wa.o;hington. 
But for most Democrats and some Republicans, budget-cutting is an in­terim necessity dictated by economic conditions. They look ahead to a time when economic con­ditions will permit a restoration of the federal government's role in helping Individuals and com­munities deal with problems such as mass transit, housing or medical 
care.

In Poland 
Beatings raise new tension 
WARSAW, Poland (AP) -A reported beating offour high school students by an anti-union squad raised new tensions in Poland yes­terday. The Reagan administration said in Washington, meanwhile, that it was "quite concerned" about forthcoming Soviet bloc maneuvers in and around Poland although there was no sign of an imminent Soviet invasion or show offorce. 
A spokesman for the Solidarity union chapter in Radom, 50 miles south ofWarsaw and long a centerof labor agitation, said the four stu­dents were reportedly beaten by four men who were tearing down Solidarity posters. 
He said the students recognized one of the four a.~ a local policeman and added that the union had ap­pealed to the police to purge its ranks ofsuch members. He said 300 parents, pupils and teachers were expected to meet later ncar Radom, which has been on strike alert since Monday over broad union demands for an end to alleged "oppression" of members. 
In Washington, State Department spokesman William Dyess said the key to the Soviet bloc maneuvers later this month is the level oftroops [hat might participate. He said the United States is not yet In a position to judge how many that might be. The exercises were announced Tuesday by Moscow and Warsaw. 
The Soviet Union is committed under the Helsinki accords to give advance notice of all military maneuvers involving 25,000 troops

The double life ofDigger Phelps 
It is not enough thatyou follow form, and even follow the most excellent rules for conducting yourselfin the world; you must, also, know whe" to der,iate from them, and where lies the exception. 
--Grevtl/e 

l.lkewlse, It is not enough to say that Digger Phelps is different. Or to call him weird, crazy or even a pompous ass. In order to really see the person, you must first strip away the per­sona. To appreciate you must first understand. 
Eleanor Rigby . .. Wearing afat·e that she keeps in ajar by the door. Who is Itfor? --Paul McCartney 
Admittedly, It is difficult. Knowing Digger Phelps Is somewhat akin to knowing two dif­ferent people. The "public" Digger, adorned in luscious mink and plumed haberdashery, who struts his stuff, pc:rfectly timed to the music, (disco-with a beat-ifyou please) 
with unequaled aplomb. This Is the Digger 
that most people sec; basil.:ally because It is 
the only Dlggc:r he allows them to see. And 
that Is an Important consideration. 
"There Is definitely a difference between the publk person and the person I have come to know," reveals his wife, Terry. "I think it stems from the fact that when someone is in the public eye all the time, the things that per­son values become cheapened very quickly. The only really valuable things are what is private." 
Flao;hy cars and fancy sportscoats? These are nothing more than tangible extensions ofa 
very extraverted personality. 
"Who he Is In public is a very real part of him," Terry continues. "He is very outgoing and he dresses and acts the way he does be­cause he wants to. It's pan of the way he was brought up. His sisters are the same way. Very clothes-conscious; very personable people." 
Uowever, because ofthis, Digger Is often

criticized by fans and media-types who call 
him a showman, a phony, a sideshow char­
latan who, according to Billy Reed ofThe 
Louisville Courier -journal, "talks a better 
game than he coaches." And ofcourse Digger 
takes great pride in being able to laugh it off. 
Thick skin Is pan of the package, right? 
But It bothers him. It has to. 
We dance around in a ring and suppose, But the Secret sits in the middle and knows. --Robert Frost 
"I guess I just can't make it visible," smiles 
Digger when asked about his real personality. 
"It's a private pan of me that I don't w1nt to 
share with everyone. I think we're all hKe that; 
cautious about who we're friends with and 
who we get close to." 
Terry elaborates. 
"When we first came here, one ofthe things 
\\ e noticed was that some ofthe people we 
considered friends gauged our friendship by 
the success or, in those days, failure ofthe bas­
ketball team. It's something that hurt Dick and 
I very deeply and it may be pan ofthe reason 
that both of us have become very selective 
when it comes to close friends." 
Yet when It comes to coaching, Digger Is 
not at all selective about who sees his sharper 
edges. 
"I coach the way I played," he emphasizes. 
"I'm a fighter. I scream and yell and get in­
volved. I never want to lose a game because 
I'm not Into what's going on." 
His enthusiasm, he claims, is a direct result 
ofgetting a head coaching job at the tender 
age of29. Youthful enthusiasm. But he says 
he's matured. 
"I guess you're insecure when you're young." he sighs. "Back then I was on the defensive in every situatiort. In the last three or four years, I've definitely matured. Look at if this way; I've only had two technical fouls in the last five seasons. When I started here I used to get called for at least six or seven a year. I thought rderees would take advantage ofme and my team because I was a rookie. When you're young, you fight to survive." 
Once I spent my time playing tough-guy scenes, 
ButI was living in a world ofchildish dreams. 
Someday these childish dreams must end, 
To become a man and grow up to dream again. 
--Bruce Springsteen 
Now the irony ofthis whole thing is that Qigger Phelps is a much better basketball coach than most people give him credit for. Yet, his record against great coaches and great teams Is conveniently ignored by the people who find that other aspects ofhis personality make more coJgrful copy. But maybe his critics don't really ignore it. Maybe they just can't explain it. Anyway, why mess up a good story with facts? 
"I'm not really worried about it," he says, somewhat unconvincingly. "As long as you're In the public eye, people are gonna take sh<>ts at you. In fact, I hope every coach and player we go up against thinks I'm a rotten coach." 
Then he winks. He's kidding again. 
"I know exactly what I've accomplished 
here," he goes on. "And as long as I know, I'm 
satisfied. You just don't do what we've done by grabbing a bunch ofplayers, handing them a ball and saying 'Ok fellas, go play.' "IfI worried about what's written and said about me, that could affect me. No, I don't try to compare myselfto other coaches. I don't have the time for that. All I know is, you give me films ofa team and three days with no distrac­tions, and we'll play to the best ofour ability, with a purpose, and we'll get it done.'' 
No winks this time. 
But who shall so forecast the years 
Andfind in loss a gain to match? 
Or reach a band through time to catch 
The far-off interest oftears. 
--A~fred, Lord Tennyson 

Ofcourse his case would be greatly strengthened by a preny little finger-thing to add to his collection ofsilver and gold. The ambition to win a national championship used to be what drove Digger Phelps; what pushed him out ofbed In the morning and held him at his desk far into the night. At least he thought so. But now, as his pepper-black hair becomes as salty as his wit, perhaps he is coming to realize what he always suspected was true. 
Sure, all the winning hao; been fun -the "moments", as he affectionately refers to them, have always been worth a few streamers, a new sportscoat and a couple of cold ones when the clock says 0:00. But that is not what's kept him here. 
It's been the "doing" -the challenge of tomorrow's game, ofnext week's opponent. For, more than anything else, Digger Phelps is a basketball coach and he works his craft in empty practice gyms as well as in crowded arenas. 
Maybe better.

But if he wins it, in Philadelphia or wherever, the challenge may not be so great thereafter. In fact, it may be that getting there, not being there, is really all the fun after all. 
John Wooden, a man who knows a little something about winning it, privately advised Digger that, "you don't really want to win It, because once you do, they expect you to do it again. And again ..." 
But then again, once just may be more than enough for Digger. In fact, he may not even need that. 
"Ifit happens, it happens," he said recently. "Don't get me wrong. I want It to happen and I wlll give everything I have to making It hap­pen. But It isn't my whole life anymore. 
And he admits all this, perhaps painfully. But then it is always painful when you finally realize that, as Charlie Brown once moaned so eloquently: "The anticipation far exceeds the actual event." 
"I want him to look back on his career ao; a great one no matter what hap­pens,"empha'iizes his wife. "Because it hao; been. He's accomplished a lot that he can be proud of." 
And he knows that. And he knows thl' people that count know that. And, to Diggl·r Phelps, that's what really matters after all.

jealousy or competition between them or their younger brother Michael (now a senior un the Fairmont West High School basketball team in Dayton). I think we all agreed it was best for John to go to Notre Dame." 
Paxson recalls the criteria h<: set for th<: college he would attend and says that Notre Dam<: best fit the bill in all r<:spects. 
"I wanted 3: good academic school with a good basketball program," h<: begins. "I did want to go away, but it had to be close enough to home that my family could come and see me play. I just liked Notre Dame's at­mosphere and I really wanttd to play for

-

homesickness. 
"It was pretty bad for awhile," he remem­bers. "I really missed my family (which, besidts his two brothers, includes sisters Molly, 22, and Maggie, 5) and it was really tough adjusting to schoolwork and basket­hall besides." 
However, any fears that all ofthat would affect his performance on the court were quickly put to rest. On December I I, 1979, Paxson stepped to the free thow line wih five seconds showing on the clock and single-handedly defeated UCLA before a house packed with fans thatbad to recheck their programs to make sure he was really a freshman. 
There was more, ofcourse. Twelve points (four-of-five from the field) in his first col­lege game. Nineteen against Davidson when starter Rich Branning had injured an ankle, and Phelps told Paxson, "It's your ballgamc." 
And he came through -with flying colors. 
Then he was a sophomore and all ofa sud­den Branning and Bill Hanzlik (Notre Dame's other starting guard last season) had graduated. Paxson, now a starter, responded to the pressure with 21 points against UCLA in the season opener which Notre Dame lost, 94-81. 
"We could have been beaten much worse," Phelps said afterwards. "Tripucka and jackson did not have good games and Woolridge got in foul troubk early. We relied heavily on Paxson and he did every­thing he could for us." 
The following week against Indiana, Pax­son did a number on Hoosier star Isiah Thomas, scoring 18 pl)ints and prompting Bobby Knight to comment: 
"Paxson and Thomas arc two of the best guards in the country. But john might have had a better game tonight." 
A month later it was Paxson again. This time Notre Dame trailed San Francisco, 75­74, with six seconds remaining, when num­ber 23 canned a 20-footcr from th<: top of the key to ice an important victory ti.>r Phelps and Co. 
"I think that game was indicative ofthe way John has matured as a player," com­ments Phelps. "He handled the tremendous pressure very well and that is a credit to him. It will also help us as a team down the stretch." 
Offthe court, Paxson has made the adjust­ment from wide-eyed freshman to confident sophomore with similar case. Well into his second year ofstudies in the Collegt~ ofBusi­ness Administration, he believes that, in spite ofthose occasional bouts with homesickness, he made the right decision to come to Notre Dame. 
"It is a lot easier when you get used to the place and the people," he smiles."And you have to learn how to balance schoolwork with basketball. But I think Notre Dame is a great place to do all that because it is really the best ofboth worlds." 
Although graduation is still down the road a bit, the chance to follow his brother to the NBA is certainly a real possibility. 
"I'm not even thinking about that right now," he stresses. "The important things to me are getting a degree and helping Notre Dame win a national championship." 
But in the future, when i's time to st:ttle down and start raising a family, it's a safe bet he'll locate somewhere close to the Dayton area. Because, if you haven't realizt>d it by now,John Paxson's roots run deep and his family ties are very strong. 
And he wants to make sure that none of that changes.

John Paxson is not the first member ofhis family to do great things with a basketball. 
The fact is, Notre Dame's sophomore point guard comes from a long line of hardcourt thoro ughbreds, beginning with his fathtT,jim, who was an All-American at the University of Dayton in 1956. 
Once planted, the Paxson family tree began to frimly take root with eldest son, Jim, who made practically every All-America honor roll as a senior at Dayton where he was a four-year starter for coach Don "Mickey" Donoher's Flyers. A first-round 
pick in the 1979 NBA draft, jim is now a star­
ter for the Portland Trailblazers, averaging 
I 7 points per game. 

So obviously it was no surprise when second son john led Archbishop Alter High School to the Ohio AAA championship as a junior and claimed tournament MVP honors in the process. However, the surprise came when Paxson, an all-state standout, who averaged 23.4 points per game as a senior, did not follow family tradition and enroll at Dayton, which Is just a jump shot away from his Kettering, Ohio home. 
"I narrowed my choices down to North Carolina and Notre Dame," remembers Pax­son. He announced his decision to play for the Fighting Irish in January ofhis senior year because he wanted "forget about recruiting and just concentrate on basket­ball and school." He insists that his choice to pass up Dayton was in no way caused by fear of playing in his brother's shadow. 
"I don't think that was it at all," points out his motherjackie, "Jim had four great years at Dayton and during that time john was his biggest fan. .There has never been any

On October 3, 1938 the National Col­legiate Athletic Association officially ap­proved a recommendation by Ohio State ba.~ketball coach H.G. Olsen that a national tournament be cstabli~hcd. The following spring Olsen's Buckeyes were beaten in the first-ever NCAA championship game, 46-33, by the Ducks of Oregon. 
The ensuing eight years saw basic changes In the format and presentation ofthe tourna­ment, though the number of teams allowed to participate remained at eight until 1951. In 1940 the first all-tournament team was chosen with Marvin Huffman (no relation, thank you) being named the outstanding player. 
This period saw a number ofdifferent 

schools winning the title, some an indication 
oflhlngs to come, others, uniquely forget­
table. Indiana won the second title in 1940; 
Bobby Knight was still a twinkle in 
someone's eye. 
Wisconsin, Stanford, Wyoming, and Utah won national championships during this period and In 1945-46 the Aggics ofOk­lahoma A & M, led by Bob Kurland, became the first team to win back-to-hack titles. 
After Holy Cross became the first inde­pendent to win in 194 7 the age of Rupp erupted. Kentucky, ullder Adolph Rupp won three of the next four tournaments. The Wildcats were interrupted only by City Col­lege ofNew York in 1950 when that Nat Hol­man coached team became the first and last team to win both the NCAA and the NIT in the same year. 
The format was expanded to sixteen teams In 1951 and the following year Kansas (Wilt Chamberlain would not play there for six years) was the championship team. 
In 1953 the tournament was expanded to 22 teams and the Hoosiers won the second oftheir three tournaments. The Fighting Irish also made their first appearance in 19'53. After wins over Western KentuckY and Penn. Notre Dame was defeated by Louslana State 81-66. 
In 1954 the number ofteams qualifying was again increased, this time to 24. Lasalle won its lone: NCAA title in the expanded tourney. The Dons ofSan Francisco, led by the omnipotent Bill Russell, became the third team to win back-to-back ('55 and '56) titles. In doing so they were also the first champions to complete a season undefeated -their final slate read 29-0. 

After championships by North Carolina, Kentucky (theirfourth offive) and the Gold­en Bears ofCalifornia, Ohio became the cen­terpiece for college basketball. Ohio State won in 1960 followed by consecutive wins by Cincinnati (led by Oscar Robinson). Both Bearcat wins included final game victories over the Buckeyes. Cincinnati lost in its bid to become the first team ever to win three straight titlt:s when the Bearcats were defeated by Loyola ofChicago. 
In 1964 at Kansas City, Mo., a team from out west began a domination that is un­rivaled by any team in any sport. The Univer­sity ofCalifornia at Los Angeles was to win an incredible I 0 ofthe next 12 championships, including a string ofseven straight. 
Led by such stars as Lew Alcindor, Bill Walton, Sidney Wicks, and Richard Washing­ton, the Bruins compiled a record of51-4 in tournamc~nt play. The only gaps in the UCLA dominance occurred in 1966 when the Miners ofTexas Western (led by Togo Railcy)won and in 1974 when the Wolfpack of North Carolina State whipped AI McGuire's Marquette. 
The Bruins' last championship year was also the first year that the tournament con­tained 32 teams. Withjohn Wooden's retire­ment that year the championship returned to the Midwest where it has remained. In the last five years seven ofthe I 0 finalists and all ofthe champions have come from the Mid­west/Great Lakes region. 
In 1976 Indiana won the title and in 1977 Marquette won when the field was ex­panded to 40 teams. In 1978 Notre Dame made its only appearance in the Final Four, finishing fourth. That same year Kentucky won its t1fth title, second only to the Uclans' 10. 
In 1978 Notre Dame was bewitched in the regional final by eventual champion Michl­gan State and their star, Greg Keiser. 
Last year the field for the tournament was expanded to 48 teams, leading to cries that it was too easy to get in and that the quality of teams was being lower.ed. Both last year and this year there have been protests that all the best teams didn't get in because ofpost season tournaments and qualifying stan­dards provided for some ofthe lesser known leagues. The proponents ofthe conference champion qualifying method claim that some leagues don't get the media exposure neccesary to draw a bid. Then there is the normal jealousy between the big leagues ove'r numbers ofteams from their con­ference that have been invited. 
Both sides received a shot in the arm when Louisville, a seeded team and certainly one ofthe best in the nation, met UCLA, last picked and fourth in the Pac-1 0, in last year's final. The Cardinals were triumphant and the final four teams had the most losses ( 29) since 1954 when Bradley, Penn, Lasalle, and USC combined for 33. 
Which leads us to 1981. 
TOURNAMENT FACTS: Kentucky has made the most NCAA tournament ap­pearances with 25 followed by UCLA with 21 and Notre Dame with 17...The Bruins hold the record for most Final Four ap­pearances with 14, followed by Kentucky and Ohio State with eight apiece...Notre Dame's Austin Carr has the top two scoring averages in tournament history with a 57.7 mark in 1970 and 41.7 in 1971. Carr, who played in three tourney games both years he led the Irish, also holds the record for most points in a game with 61 ( vs. Ohio U., March 7, 1970). ..Notre Dame and Iowa hold the record for most points in a game by two teams with 227. The Hawkeyes won 121­106 on March 14, 1970...Notre Dame's record in the NCAA is 18-20 for a .473 per­centage...The Irish must win five straight games to take this year's crown...32 teams will participate in the opening round ofthe tourney while 16 more received byes and will wait for the second round. 
The majority of this data was taken from 
Ken Rappoport's, The Classic, a history of 
the NCAA tournament.

Doobie Brothers rest on laurels 
A
nother one ofthe various groups which have 
changed boats without changing the name ofthe 
boat is the Doobie Brothers. They began as a basic rock­
and-roll band In the early 70's; then, abruptly, in 1976 
began recording in a jazz-rock vein which eventually 
made them even more successful than they had been 
previously. 
The band first hit In 1972, with "Listen to the Music." They had only shonly before that gained a recording contract, in a way very few groups get one. They sent Warner Brothers a dt.mo tape before any scouts had dis­con·rcd them; someone actually heard It, was in­terested, saw them perform, and signed them on the spot. They didn't have to pay their dues for years to get "discovered." 
The dominating force in the group in the early days was TomJohnston. Be wrote most ofthe early Doobies hits, like "Long Train Runnin'," and sang lead on all the well-known records. Oddly, the group's first number one slnglt: was not a very rock-and-roll type song. It was the mort· mellow "Black Water," which hit numberone early in 197'5; it was at least the third single from the LP What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits. They followed that with a remake of"Takc Me In Your Arms," more reminiscent ofearlier recordings. Then came the abrupt change. 
TomJohnston left the Doobics in 197'5, as did several other members. Qohnston has since attempted a solo career, hitting with "Savannah Nights" early in 1980.) Coming in were two former members ofSteely Dan, from the days when that group was actually a band, and new lead singer Michael McDonald. The result was a radically different sound in comparison to past Doobie Brothers releases. The single "Takin' It to the Streets," and the album of the same name, are excellent ex­amples ofthis change from the rock which had earned them their money in the early days to the jazz-oriented rock which became the most copied sound ofthe late '70s except for disco. 
Since then, the Doobic Brothers have released records in the manner oftheir stylistic cousins, Steely Dan; sporadically, taking many months to record each one. The late-1978 release Minute by Minute, and the first single from the album, "What a Fool Believes," both hit number one. Two more singles from that album made the top 40. 
Since then, the Doobie Brothers have seemed con­tent to rest on their laurels. Both their material on the No Nukes compilation and that on their recent album One Step Closer seem half-baked in comparison to the early days -even in comparison to early jazz-oriented Doobie Brothers material. 

Thejam presses forward 
N
ot anotherJam album? Well, no, actually. There's never been "just anotherJam Album", and 'Sound Affects' is no exception. Like each successive release of their t.·arccr, this album takes the'band forward, just as 'Setting Sons' did from'Mod Cons' did from ·Modern World' did from 'In The City'. 'Sound Affects' isn't a per­fect Jam album, even if it is a great one, but above all it's a brave t.kparture and an earnest effort to bn:ak new ground. 'Sound Affects' is TheJam today, and that's what we need most ofall. 
Sidt.· one opens with 'Pretty Green', already an es­tablisht.·d feature in the live set. Built on a terse, insistent rhythm (inspired initially by Weller's liking for Michael Jat.·kson ), its lyrics describe an innocence that comes qukkly to grasp the cash nexus: luxury or necessity, 
"Ibis is society·· You can't do nothing, unless it's in the pocket". By way ofcomplete contrast comes 'Monday', a beautiful love song that t.·limbs status via some soarin~ Mellow, soothing harmonies underscore the chorus­title line, brutally thrown into an ironic light by the verses, which amount to a jarring litany ofsnapshot images seen through a young man's eyes in contem­porary England, some violent, some sordid, some ten­der. "A police car and a screaming siren ... Paint splattered walls and the cry ofa tomcat ...That's en­
tertainment". 

Side two starts with a couple of similarly excellent numbers, but overall it fails to maintain the standard of the t1rst. 'Dream Time' is harsh and abrasive, more tradi­tional Jam in style. 'Man In The Corner Shop', another gorgeously memorable tunc, returns to some gently 
sardonic reflections on the English class system: a'> al­ways, the viewpoint is a humane, personalistic one rat­her than political in the mass, didactic sense.

chorus harmonies, culminating in Weller's impassioned declaration:"/ will never be embarrassed about love again", pt.·rhaps the record's most significant line. 
Paul Weller's frank admiration for middle-period Bcatles is evident throughout 'Sound Affects', especially in the guitar work. 'Start' we already know about (included here in re-mixed form) and another driving 
love song 'But I'm Different Now' comes stuffed with 'Dr. Robert' riffing and 'I Fcell'inc' ripples. The crucial point, though, Is that these influences are incorporated only to enrich what's already there, and remain firmly subservient to Weller's own songwritinggifts and to the distlnt.'t, powerful identity ofTheJam. As with The Who 
touches In earlier work, whoever they look to for in­
spiration it's always The Jam themselves who come out 
on top. 'That's Entenainmcnt', which closes the first side must rate as one of Paul Weller's finest pieces to date. 
strangely out of place, almost like one of those jaunty 
mod anthems thatJam imitators were churning out all 
last year. The lyrics do work to undercut the self­
confidence ofthe chorus somewhat -buteven the ad­
dition of'Penny Lane' brass doesn't ;ift tje song much 
above average. 'Scrape Away', meanwhile, is disappoint­
ingly nnegative and vague. Like 'La'>t Couple', it gives an 
uncomfortable impression ofbeing rushed through to 
beat a deadline. 

Hut let's end on a positve note. Where 'Sound Affects' 
is good it's great, and where it's not so good it's still 
good. TheJam should go on being number one in our 
hearts and charts because they go on earning the right 
to be. I've got 'Sound Affects' and I'm chuffed with it and

Quiz XV: N arne changes 
H
ow do you spell relief? Most ofyou, at this point in the semester, would spell it B-R-E-A-K. And so do I. Hut this week's quiz will not be a break from routine, for another goodie is on th: way. 
Last week's was one ofthose which contained the obviously easy (I'm sure the vast majority ofyou knew who recorded the LP Wild Planet) and the impossibly hard (those wordsJohn Lennon mumbles during the intro of"Woman" are pretty obscure). You can find the answers to all last week's questions below this week's quiz. 
This column deals with those many, many performers who have changed their names upon becoming rock stars. These follow no pat­tern; some very "commercial" names have been changed to less com­mercial names, while (more commonly) the opposite has occurred. 
Robert Dupuis and Dominic lerace arc a couple ofexamples of performers who changed the spellingoftheir name for good rca'>on ­so that people could pronounce them easily. The aforementioned sin­gers arc Robby Dupree ("Steal Away," "Hot Rod Hearts") and Donnie Iris ("Ah! Leah!"), respectively. 
An obscure British singer named David Jones changed his name in the mid 1960s for another good reason -there was another not­quite-so-obscure British singer named DavidJones hanging around. That one was one ofthe Monkecs. This one became David Bowie. 
Other performers name themselves after other people whom they admire orotherwise respect enough to steal their names. Robert Zim­merman took the first name ofone ofhis favorite poets (Dylan 
Thomas) and used it as his la'>t; he became, obviously, Bob Dylan. Reginald Dwight "borrowed" the names oftwo ofhis British musician­friends, LongJohn Haldry and Elton Dean, and became Elton John. 
There are also those performers who were given their phony names. A young Philadelphian named Ernest Evans reminded Mrs. Dick Clark ofa "little Fats Domino, or a Chubby Checker," and that he became. Gerry Dorsey's manager, Gordon Mills, gave him the name of a 17th century classical composer, Engelbert Humperdinck. 
Finally, there arc those who seem like they usc pseudonyms but are using their real names. Many artists known by unusual first names were actually born with that name. Examples arc Dion (real name: Dion DiMucci), Fabian (real name: Fabiano Forte), and Melanic (real name: Melanie SaJka). Then there arc others, like Elvis Presley, Hilly Joel, andJohnny Cash, who use(d) their real name although they may sound fake. 
Some more people who changed their names are listed below. Your job, should you choose to accept it, i!> to identifY these pop and rock stars.

York. I would go ha1.·k there to visit my family and friends, hut I wouldn't want Corry (his two-and-a-half year old son) to have to grow up there." 
As Digger Phelps's right-hand man, and the recruiting co-ordinator for the Irish basketball progrjlm, McLaughlin spends quite a hit of time both in his offict· and on the road. For instance, two weeks ago, McLaughlin drove to Lincoln, Ill. on a Friday night to see a recruit, and made the four hour return trip on the same evening. 
On Saturday afternoon, Mclaugh­lin took to the bench, and along with Pete Gillen and Gary Brokaw, hdped Digger Phelps coach Notre Dame to a 13 point win over Dayton. On Sunday morning at 8:00, McLaughlin and Phelps took off for sunny California, to see a couple of recruits. They left the coast at I0:20 p.m., and arrived hack in South Bend at 4 a.m. 
"With the change in the NCAA rules, (the part-time assistant can no longer travel to recruit) I've gone out a little more this year," says McLaughlin. "Put that with getting the team ready, and it makes for long days and weeks. 
"It's very hard to get away," he continues. "When I can, I just like to go home and play with my son. I try to do that at least one night a week. During the summer, my wife and I always try to get away for a couple of weeks, hut it is very hard to get away." 
Life, now, for Tom McLaughlin is a road which he and the rest of the Irish coaching staff hope leads straight to Philadelphia. Perhaps beyond that, it will carry McLaugh­lin to a head coaching position somewhere, something he would like to attain while he stays in the husiness. 
It may even lead to life as a lawyer, or to the very relaxed life ofEurope. 
And whether the road he straight or humpy, Mt·Laughlin will stir up no trouhle. He'll just go on accept­ing and adjusting. That's the way he is.

Division II Tournament 
Tennis team aims for national championship 
The Observer Thursday, March 12, 1981 -page 13 
Don't let that sunshine and those warm breezes fool you. The Notre Dame women's tennis team will be all business when it ventures westward for five matches in seven days over Spring Break, March 16­22. 
The Irish, who captured the In­diana AlAW Division II championship this fall, arc pointing for the AlAW Region V Division II tournament, to be held May 14-16 in 
Spilman goes after starting spotwith Reds 
TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -Harry Spil­man takes htting practice with the "extra players. lie also takes infield with the "extra playt·rs." 
But Spilman, used primarily as a pinch-hitter the last two seasons by the Cincinnati Reds, feels it's time to lind out whether he can be a starter or whether's he's destined to be an "extra" the rt·st of his career. 
"After this year, something's got to happen," said Spilman, who can play first, third, outfield and also ~.·att·h. "Everybody in this game wants a chance to st·e what he can do." 
Signed by tht· Reds in 1974 through a tryout camp, Spilman ac­cepted his roll the last two years as a left-handed pinch-hitter and oc­casional first baseman. 
!lis I 0 runs halted in last season were the most hy a Cincinnati pinch­hitter since 1972. He also had four home runs and a .267 batting averagt·. 
But tht· Georgian turns 27 this summer, and he thinks time won't let him wait much longer for a chance to win a starting joh. 
"At times you just have to hold vourself on the bench, you want to get out there so badly.. .I enjoy being with the Reds but, hopefully, I'll get a chance to play somewhere some day." 
The Reds traditionally give their hackup players first chance at a regular opening. When Pete Rose left, Rlly Knight took over third base. 
When Joe Morgan departed, Junior Kennedy and Ron Oester competed for second base. 
Spilman sees little chance of a repeat situation, barring a trade or serious injury. 
"There's just no room for me to break into the lineup," he said. "Dan (Driessen) is one of the best first. basemen in the league. Ray (Knight) has had two solid years. I'm just in the position that I can't really do anything. I'm trying to stay in shape and prove to them when I get a chance that I can do it." 
Spilman, mentioned in off-seasoQ trade speculation, said he would welcome a trade if it meant a chance to play every day. 
"But if I'm going to sit the hench (in another city) I'd rather stay here. I'm on a pennant contender." 
The Reds signed free agent Larry Biittnerover the winter, giving them another left-handed hitting first baseman. Spilman thought the move would strengthen the hench, but he wasn't sure whether it would cut in­to his already slim playing time. 
"I know Larry plays first base a lot," he said"I'Il have to wait until the season starts to see how Mac (Manager John McNamara) uses him." 
Although Spilman's one-year con­tract expires after this season, he esn't have enough years of ex­perience to qualify as a free agent. 
"I'm r~ally in a position where I can't do that much," he said. 
Detroit. 
"We're not going to try to kid anybody -our goal this spring is to get to the national championships," says Notre Dame coach Sharon Petro, who guided the Irish to a 13-2 fall campaign. "If our players con­tinue to improve the way they did in the fall there's no reason we can't make it.'' 
To get there, the Irish will have to finish first or second in the regional. The Division II national champion­ship is scheduled for June 10-13 in Charleston, S.C. Notre Dame never has advanced to the national tourna­ment. 
Notre Dame will challenge Long Beach State's "B" team, Loyola Marymount, Whittier College, Gold­en West and Denver before return­ing home. The Irish then have a two-week layoff before a weekend jaunt to Michigan to take on Michi­gan, Wayne State and Michigan State April I 0-12. 

Petro will be extremely anxious to monitor the progress of her squad, especially senior Cindy Schuster (Des Moines, Iowa) and junior Mary Lcgeay (Evansville, Ind.). Both players suffered tendon damage in their wrist during the fall campaign. Schuster, who posted a 13-9 record at number one singles for the Irish, suffered the less severe of the two injuries, and should be ready to go. 
But Legeay, who boasted marks of 9-1 at fifth singles and 15-0 at num­ber two doubles, was unable to work out for much of the winter months after wearing a brace for the latter portion of the fall season. She's back 
Future looks bright for youthful U.S. figure skaters 
By BETSY KENEDY AssociatedPress Writer , 
HARTFORD, Conn. (AP)-In the words of figure skating coach Don Laws, "It was somewhat of a banner year" for the United States at the 1981 World Figure Skating Cham­pionship. 
The one gold and two silver medals won by skaters Scott Hamil­ton, David Santee and Elaine Zayak, respectively, represented the best showing by an American squad in world competition in recent years. 
The Americans just barely lost an­other medal in the final ice dancing event Saturday night when Judy Blumberg and Michael Seibert took a fluky and uncharacteristic tumble to the ice. 
The move cost them their third­
place standing to Natalia Be­
stemianova and Andrei Bukin of the 
Soviet Union in a tie-breaker 
determined by the winner of the 
free-dance. 
And with Santee the only American competitor here considering retiring before the 1984 Olympics, American skating experts have high hopes for their squad over the next several years. 

For the ladies, young American national champion Zayak, with her astounding array of seven triple jumps, won a silver medal and plans more jumps for next year, despite some criticism that she should ac­quire more grace and style. 
in action now, and will return to her doubles spot with freshman Pam Fis­chette (Liverpool, N.Y.), where they were unbeaten in the fall. 
Her status at numher five singles is less certain. If Pt·tro elects to hold Legeay out of singles, junior Tina Stephan (Barrington, Ill.) will fill in. The remainder of Notre Dame's fall lineup will remain intact -Schuster at first singles, sophomore Linda Hoyer (Port Clinton, Ohio) at second, Fischette at third, where she was 17-0 in the fall, junior Carol Shukis (LaGrangt·, Ill.) at fourth, and junior Peggy Walsh (Midland, Mich.) at number six. 
Hoyer and Stephan will comprise Notre Dame's top douhlcs tandem, with senior captain Sheila Cronin (West Chicago, Ill.) and junior Stasia Obremskey ( Lehanon, Ind.) filling the bill at numher three.

Notre Dame'sWater PoloClub will begin practice Monday, March 23, from 4-6 p.m. at the Rockne Memorial. For more information contact Pat McDivitt at 8650. 
The Notre Datne hockeyteam had its annual ban­quet Tuesday night In the Monogram Room ofthe ACC and the follow· ing awanls were presented. The team's most valuable player award went to junior, Jeff Logan. He was also presented with the National Monogram Club's MVP honor. Logan, along with classmate Dave Poulin was named team co-captains for the 1981-82 season. Bill Rothstein and John Schmidt were named alternate captains. Jeff Brownschldle was named the team's best defensive player while fresh· 
man Tony Bonadio received the rookie of the year trophy. Mark Doman was honored as the most improved player on the squad while the St. Joe Valley Notre Dame club gave Scott Cameron its scholar­athlete award. Kevin Humphries was the recipient ofthe Ed McGauley Award for the team's outstanding senior while Don Lucia was given theJohn Whitmer award.

"Jimmy hits the ball well. He hit .31 0 as a freshman so we have a lot of confidence in him In his replacing Voellinger," says Gallo, "but we know that all the guys breaking into starting roles or in the important backup positions can do the job for us." 
In the outfield, the South Bend connection of Senior George lams ( .304,35 runs scored for second best on team) and Dan Szajko (.320, 23 RBI's) return after they both started all 3 7 games last year. 
"They do so much more for us then just hit," explains Gallo, "They're both super on defense and they can run like crazy which is great because I like a running type of game. You'll see a lot of hit and run plays for us this year given the situa­tion." 
As mentioned Chryst will play some in the outfield -when someone named Mike Jamieson doesn't. 

Captain Jamieson, who played mostly as the designated hitter last year, will be a key figure in leading this team which may be the groundwork for a future strong tradition in Irish baseball. Last year he led the club in hits ( 44) while placing second in batting average (.358) and RBI's (33). 
"He is by far our best contact hit· ter," praises Gallo, "He's very consis· tent and can spray his hits everywhere. He's also a great leader which is important since we're basi­cally young and still have many un­tested players." 
So, where does the team go from last year then? 
"Last year we e5tablishd winning which was important since we had four straight losing years in a row before that. This year any game we go to, the players now realize that it Is the other team that has to beat us. We'll lose some games, I'm not saying we won't, but we won't dwell on it. It's just like last year where we lost a doubleheader and then won 14 straight. 
"It's not a cockiness that we have but a very quiet confidence," con­tinues Gallo, "We're going to take every game as it comes and not just dwell on an NCAA bid, which is our major goal or goals. Our confidence level is very strong right now and if we do well at the start of the season and throughmtt it can only get stron­ger." 
The grqundwork is laid for a strong tradition in Notre Dame baseball. Construction begins Sun­day.

Irish baseball 


Gallo seeks W"inning tradition 


By LOUIE SOMOGYI 

Sports Writer 
Before the start of the 1980 
baseball season, Dr. Tom Kelly em­
phasized an important message to 
what he knew could be a talented 
baseball squad -"believe in your­
selves." 
The result was an assault on the 
record books unsurpassed in Irish 
baseball laurels, including: 
The most wins ever ( 29) to only 
eight losses in a season. 
The best winning percentage 
(.783) since the 1936 team went 16­
3. 
A team batting average of .332 ­
bettering the .30I mark of 1958. 
Now, in 1981, Larry Gallo takes 
over as manager for the club after 
serving at the assistant position last 
year with the similar philosophies of 
his predecesor and the belief of 
starting a program with a con­
tinuous winning tradition. 
"I think a lot of people see our program on the upswing," says the first year mentor, "I think we should have been in the NCAA tournament last year. I know that sounds like sour grapes, but there were also other teams that thought that we should have gotten a bid." 
The 'upswing' can be seen espe­cially in terms of the 48 game schedule this year which will be, by far, the most in a single season for an Irish baseball team. The season will start off Sunday against Christian Brothers College in Tennessee followed by a doubleheader on 
Monday against Delta State of Divi­
sion ll and a single game onTuesday. 
Then the road show spills over to 
Mississippi for single duels on Wed­
nesday and Thursday before concluding against Memphis State on Friday. 
"I know that that doesn't sound like traditional powerhouses like a Michigan or USC, but baseball is not like football or basketball. The talent can spread to anywhere in baseball. There are a lot of junior college teams in the country, especially like 
in a place like Florida, that could just 
whip many Division I teams. Believe 
me this is going to be a good road 
test for us and we'll find out a lot. 
"Christian Brothers has a good little program down there while Delta State may be one of the best teams in Division II. From what I've heard their hitting is just awesome so our pitching (perhaps the strong suit of the team) will be tested. Memphis State meanwhile is regarded as the premier power in the Metro which is saying something 
because Florida State is also from the Metro and they were in the College World Series last year. 
Off-Campus loses 


1 by default 
Due to an ineligible player used in the Tuesday night A­division playoff game by the Off·Campus team, Howard Hall has been declared the winner of this year's Interhall A-Division Basketball Championship. The Off-Campus squad was forced to forfeit the game in which the ineligible player participated. This forfeit gave the 0-C squad their second loss in the double­elimination tournament. The basketball crown marks the third straight interhall cham· pionship earned by Howard. 
"But this is what we need for our program. We have to continue to beef up our schedule. This year we've added Purdue and Ball State which are from two of the best con­ferences in college baseball and I hope in the future we can get a Mich­igan or Central Michigan on our schedule." 
Pitching is regarded by Gallo as the main strength for this years edi­tion for two big reasons -seniors Mike Deasey and Bob Bartlett. 
Deasey, the main ace, finished with a 6-2 mark last year while also accumulating eight saves and the team's top ERA of2.39. His control is also a main asset as he gave up only 11 walks in 52 2/3 innings pitched. 
Bartlett put together a 4-1 record earning six saves along the way while accumulating a 3.89 ERA and led the team with 37 strikeouts in only 34 2/3 innings. 
"Deasey and Bartlett have just been doing great in practice," says Gallo, "but right now Bryan Smith (junior, 4-1, five saves, 4.05) is throwing as well as anybody for us. Our young sophomore Steve Whit­myer had an excellent fall (in which the Irish went 8-4-1 ) and also has been coming along. All four have to be ready to relieve also but we're going to have a real stopper in soph­omore Steve Gallinaro. He has the ideal temperment for relievers and has tremendous confidence and can really throw the strikes. 
"Our pitching has been progress­ing very well. Last year our total ERA was 4.50 and before that the best was 5.SO. This fall we got it down to 

A strong defense is also a basis for optimism for Gallo for improved pitching despite the vacancioes that were left at third base and shortstop positions. 
Tim Prister, a junior transfer from Indiana, has won the inside track at the hot corner while fellow clas­smate Joe Barrows will split shortstop duties with sophomore Rich Chryst. Chryst will also spend time in the outfield. 
Second base is nailed down solid­ly with junior Chuck Tasch (.354 average and 17 RBI's at the lleadoff position last year) and backup Scott Siler who Gallo describes as "the best student of the game on our team from the shoulders on up." 
Junior first baseman Henry Valen­zuela (.268, three HR's, 26 RBI's) will begin his third straight year as a starter at first. 
"His batting mark is not indicative of what a great hitter he really is. There were some that he drilled last year that were outs because ofgreat stabs. He's our best pure hitter." 
The large shoes of graduated catcher Dan Voellinger (.345, five HR's, 38 RBI's and now in the New York Yankee farm system) will be handled by senior Jim Montagano who was out all of last year with an

Lacrosse team faces varsity test 
How can a 17-year-old team and a 10-year veteran coach have an in­augural season? 
Grant them varsity status and it's a whole new lacrosse game. 
The game invented by North American Indians and glorified on Canadian and New England fields for years has been granted varsity status after a 17-year sojourn as a club sport at Notre Dame. The team faces its initial varsity test on Saturday, March 14, when it faces off against Radford University on the first leg of a four-game spring trip. 
"I'm not going to deceive anyone and say we're jumping into this thing to become the nextJohns Hopkin!>,"' says Irish coach Rich O'Leary, the man who has guided the Notre Dame stickmen so ably as a club for the last 10 years. "But we have a chance, right away, to be a repre­

sentative team in the Midwest." 
The Irish also face Washington and Lee's junior varsity team on March 16 at 4 p.m., while they are entertained by Johns Hopkins Uni­versity's junior squad on March 18 at 4 p.m. The Irish· round out their spring swing against Morgan State on March 20 before returning to campus for a March 25 scrimmage against Purdue. 
"Tim and Moe (Beshlian) are ex­
tremely gifted lacrosse players," says 
O'Leary. "In fact, Tim Michels is 
probably the most gifted player we 
have had at Notre Dame in terms of 
all-around skills." 
Michels, a native of Lacrosse-rich 
Baltimore, Md., has filled many a 
shoe (and held many a stick) during 
his Irish career. When needed, he 
has played at various midfield and 
defense positions, and he exhibits a 
tremendous knowledge ofthe game. 
Yet Michels may be assuming an­other position for the Irish this spring. Head coach Rich O'Leary, faced with no overwhelming can­didate for goalie, has moved Michels into the crease the past few days of practice and may make that Michels' home for the year. 
"So far he has worked out quite well," explains O'Leary. "Tim pos­sesses a lot ofnatural quickm:ss with his hands and has good sense for the game. He has not had much trouble at all picking up the position. 
"Because ofour depth on defense, losing him from that position should not hurt us that much." 
O'Leary will call on junior Dave Lewis (Morris Plains, N.J.) and either Pat Jank (Watertown, N.Y.) or Rich Wickel (Weehawken, N.J.), both juniors, to round out the starting defense. 
Although attackmen are theoreti­cally the team's biggest scorers, two of last year's top three point totals belonged to midfielders. The trend should continue this year with the middies anchored by tri-captain Carl Lundblad. The top returning scorer from last year's club, Lundblad has been relied on heavily as an of­fensive weapon in his first three seasons at Notre Dame. 

Lundblad will probably be joined at midfield by sophomore Danny Pace (Summit, N.J.), who is coming offa sterling 14-goal, 12 assist rookie performance last year. Seniors Kevin Campion (Huntington, N.Y.) and Bob Durgin (Falls Church, Va), also should see considerable action alongside Lundblad and/or Pace. 
Two days and counting 
This was a frustrating day. 
First ofall we've got more injuries than I'd like to see right now. Orlando is still having problems with the thigh contusion he suffered on the Thursday before the Virginia game. People don't realize it but that was part of his problem against DePaul. Right now it's still bad and that could cause us real serious problems. 
Timmy Andree is having sotp.e problems with his back and that's not helping us right now either. Couple the injuries with midterms and you'll see that we only had nine guys on the court at one point during yester­day's practice. It's difficult preparing for two teams we're not that familiar with when we're having these kinds of problems. I'm very concerned about having everything learned by Saturday. 
This morning we put a game card together for Georgetown. That is the long piece of paper that lists everything we can do against the Hoyas and what they will try to do against us. I kc:ep it with me during the game. It's a quick reference that we use often. Tommy (McLaughlin)and I looked atJames Madison. They are a good ballteam that plays a tough slow-down game. 
By 2:00, after looking at films, answering the phone and doing radio interviews, I needed to get away for awhile, so I went down to Macri's Bakery. I love the Macri family and I just wanted to say hello. Oh, I did manage to sample a few of their pastries while I was down there. 
I picked up my son, Rick, at school around 2:30. I do that every day because I am away from home so often and I do love spending time with him. From the school we went shopping which is something I love to do be­cause it's a diversion. We got enough groceries/for the weekend because Terry and I will be in Provide11ce and the kids will be home with a babysitter. 


I got back to the office around 3 p.m. and there were hundreds ofphone messages waiting for me. I d,id a few radio interviews and everyone seems to ask the same questions: who are the favorites and how do I think we · will do? I answer all those questions the same way. In ' the NCAA's everyone's a favorite and I think we will do the best we can. I just hope that's good enough. 
Then to practice and I don't even want to talk about that anymore. It's frustrating and I'm conccrrned. But I'm not worried because I believe in our team and our staffand I believe in what we're trying to do: 
Last night I went home and spent time with my fami· ly. I don't get to do that very often, which is unfortunate because nothing makes me happier than being with Terry and the kids. But I was still thinking about Satur· day and the game.
