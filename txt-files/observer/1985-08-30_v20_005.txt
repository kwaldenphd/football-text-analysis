Tradition of construction continues at Notre Dame 
In the 1840s, Father Edward Sorin began a project 
which is obviously still under way. 
When he began building the University of Notre 
Dame he could not have imagined some of the con­
struction and renovation that is going on today. Things 
from new windows on old dorms to a brand new 
Olympic-sized swimming pool have been projects in 
the last year.   
Most of the work is good for the University by either 
providing new facilities or making old ones more 
useable. However, the users of this campus often com­
plain about the inconveniences associated with the 
growth and expansion ofNotre Dame. 
Father Sorin had his share of inconveniences in the 
construction of the University. In 1879 a major fire 
destroyed five buildin~ on the campus including the 
administration building. Although his life's work was 
destroyed he stood firm and made the decision to 
rebuild. 

Expansion and remodel­
ing continue today. 

The women of Farley and Breen-Phillips returned this year to freshly dormitories. The process eluded freshly painted ""r""-~./ refinished walls, new dows, new carpeting in hallways and a clean overall appearance. 
While there are few com­plaints about what has been done, there ace more gripes \'l!I~..U about what cannot be done. In order to protect the costly repairs, tacks and naiis can only be stuck in the molding near the ceiling, making it more difficult to hang decorations. 
It is really a small price to pay for the sutstantial provements. 
On the South Quad the partial skeleton of the new addition to the Law School staiRds between the en­gineering building and the rest of the Law School. Last year a memo was circulated warning of the annoyance of construction over the next year or so, causing one professor to quip, "So, should I postpone my classes un­til1987?" 
This construction site is not only a nuisance to law students and faculty, but to anyone passing by. You can no longer cut through Fitzpatrick Hall, because one entrance is blocked by the Law School's eastern expan­sion. The parking lot near the post office has been turned into a fenced-off storage area Inside the fence are a handful ofhandicapped-onlyparking spaces. Some speculate that these ace legally used by some ofEllerbe Construction's lesser skilled employees, but more likely it is just another inconvenience to the hand­icapped. 

John Men nell 
Production Manager 
In another construction site, a fence has been put around the Fieldhouse Mall in preparation for construc­tion on the half-a-million dollar memorial to Notre Dame alumni who died in World War II. A disgruntled Breen-Phillips senior said, "We'll have to walk so much farther." There will likely be more complaints when that modem Stonehenge-like structure is completed. 
Finally, the renovations on LaFortune Student Center 
have The construction (or destruction) did not start over the summer as scheduled, but was delayed until the beginning of the school year. This caused the users of the building to fear 
1......JJ~::::,p::::::::~--:-for their lives as the wreck­1-· ing ball was dropped near the foundation when the: old <Y~~~:::._::!..!.:=::==J;=== pool hall was destroyed. 
\-The result of the con­~;;;.F:===,-;:::::::=:==.!.~\=· struction should be a much­
-needed, much-improved student center. The users of LaFortune will just have to 
patient while the workon the building continues. 
This is by no means acom­plete list of construction for the past, present or future. A new Olympic-sized swim­ming pool will be opening 
soon behind the ACC and landscaping has been com­pleted around the expansion to Galvin Life Science Center. Future plans may include new dormitories or classroom buildings. 
Another complaint with many structures put on this campus is that it is change. Tradition is held very sacred here, and too much change too fast could be as devastat · ing as the fire of 1879. 
There will always be some change here. The students come through and shape the personality of the: campus and then leave to let others fill their places and make their marks. 
In 1844 there were just five buildings on this campus and 25 students. Those numbers have obviously grown along with Father Sorin's dream and with proper care will continue to grow into the future.

We of the Never Never 
(1983) Color, 132 min. 
Igor Auzins. Australia 
From the memoirs of Australian pioneer Jeanne Gunn comes th1s breathtaking and exciting film portrayal (reminiscent of My Brilliant Career) of her dramatic struggles as a lone woman against the Australian Never Never and the men who lived there as she fought for respect and the rights of the aborgines. 
11/4 7 00 pm, Snite Touch of Evil (1959) B/W, 108 min. Orson Welles. 1958 
Grand Prix winner at Cannes, Evil is in some respects more spectacular than Citizen Kane in its film noir decadence. Charleton Heston and Janet Leigh play a newlywed couple who wander into a seedy Mexican border town and fall under the spell of corrupt sheriff Hank Quinlan, one of Welles' biggest characterizations in every respect.

Like his earlier Lolita. Nabokov's story concerns a mild little man driven to murder by his own delusions. Tom Stop· pard's adaptation (Rosencranz and Guildenstern Are Dead) results in a sly and witty cinematic exploration of Nabokov themes set against Fassbinder's garish and disturbing background of pre-Nazi Ger· many, where Dirk Bogarde plays Hermann. a Russian exile watching his chocolate factory go to ruin in the worldwide depres­sion.

Probably the most celebrated Western of all time, John Ford's Stagecoach is both an action movie with a spectacular Indian attack and gunfight, and a subtly underplayed examination of society and civilization. The stagecoach itself contains a number of social "types" who interact with one another in a microcosm of civilization itself. Among the notable passengers are John· Wayne as a gun· fighter, Claire Trevor as a whore, John Carradine as a gambler. and Thomas Mit· chell (Oscar, Best Supporting Actor) as a drunken doctor.

Potemkin (1925) B/W, 67 min. Sergei Eisenstein. USSR Man With the Movie Camera (1928) B/W. 69 min. Dziga Vertov, USSR 

Two masterpieces of the Soviet cinema. Based on a true incident during the 1905 revolution in-which mutiny by sailors aboard the battleship Potemkin is sup· ported by the citizens of Odessa, Potemkin serves as the vehicle for Eisenstein's radical cinematic theories: his use of mon­tage, the dialectical synthesis of "conflic· ling" shots. and his treatment of the mass, rather than the individual hero. Camera. a radicalized "city symphony" documentary, takes the camera out of fie· lion and into the streets in order to demonstrate the special and specific reali· ty of cinematic vision.

Subtle form of segregation may be practiced by teachers 
Spedal to The Obeerver 
Remember when your first grade teacher divided the class into the redbirds and the turkeys for reading lessons? 
According to a sociologist at Notre Dame, your teacher may have been practicing a subtle form of segregation. 
Maureen Hallinan, White profes· sor of sociology at the University, said while ability grouping might benefit the brightest students in a classr<x)m, it can also create an atmosphere that discourages inter­racial mixing and provides students in lower groups with inferior in· struction. 
Because In many schools the high achievers are predominantly white students and low achievers black, Hallinan said ability grouping can defeat the purpose of desegregation plans. 
Compiled In collaboration with Aage Sorensen, sociology chairman at Harvard University, the findings result from a two-year study in which Hallinan surveyed 1,478 fourth through seventh grade stu· 
dents in 48 different classrooms of 
J0 schools in northern California. 
Originally intending to con· centrate on the development of children's friendships with their classmates, Hallinan said the schools' racial diversity led her to expand the focus. 
Her data, which attempts to determine if there are differences in the ways that black and white stu­dents choose their respective friends, can be useful in the im· plementation of school desegrega· tionplans. 
The studies reveal that both black and white children look for friends who share basic characteristics such as gender, age, race, socio-economic background and achievement level. However, the organization of their classrooms can also have a great im· pact on the friendship and learning processes. 
Students who were grouped together, especially on the basis of ability, tended to choose friends from within the group, Hallinan said. 
The grouping intensifies the ef· fects of similarity on the develop· ment of friendships and distinguishes one particularly im· portant characteristic. "Children tend not to choose friends who are lower achievers than themselves. Sometimes achievement is looked upon as more important than race," she said. 




Teachers who group students ac­cording to ability, Hallinan said, "are underscoring similarity in achieve· ment by putting these children together at the same achievement level, but setting them apart for everyone else to see." 
In effect, she added, the groupings can create a "partitioned" classroom by promoting friendliness among some students but constraining it among others. 
Considering that only a few black children are likely to be among the high achievers, the groupings can become a subtle form of segrega­tion. 
She also discovered that on an overall basis, black children are more willing to initiate interracial friendships than their white clas­smates. Black children apparently are attracted by what they perceive as a social power associated with white students' higher achievement, she said. Within an ability group, however, the situation changes. 
White children aren't likely to in· itiate interracial friendships without the prodding ofstructured activities such as classroom groupings or ex­tracurricular activities. 
Once the group Is established, however, a white child Is more likely to choose a black friend because of an emphasis on their academic similarities and the opportunity to choose on the basis of individual personalities rather than basic characteristics. 
Conversely, black children place little emphasis on structures such as ability groups and don't necessarily interpret groupings with white children as status equality. 
Within such groups, Hallinan said, black children might need to attain a higher status before friendships with white children in the group could become more commonplace. 
At the same time, children in the lower groups probably receive a poorer education because they begin at a lower level and have less potential to progress. Hallinan said teachers of lower groups are likely to spend more time on administra­tion and discipline, leaving less time for teaching than in high achieve­ment groups. 
If ability groups can be arranged to faithfully mirror the original racial composition of the classroom, Hal­linan said, achievement can be un­derscored without allecting the natural development of same-race and interracial friendships. 
She advises, however, that school officials should begin to realize that simply putting children of different races together in the same clas­sroom is not enough for successful school desegregation. 
"Teachers need to be aware ofthe effects of different pedagogical devices such as ability groups and use them in ways to promote ac· hievement and Interracial Interac­tion. 
It's not sufficient just to put these children together; what's needed Is institutional support. The schools have to make obvious efforts to change status systems in the clas­sroom. They need to enhance the status ofblacks,"she said.

Those "killer" bees reported to be in California may not be killers at all, but only victims ofrumors resulting in an undeservedly bad reputation. 
The misleading accounts of the bee colonies could result in undue hysteria and serious damage to the beekeeping industry in the United States, according to Notre Dame biology professor Harald Esch, an entomologist specializing in insect communications. 
Recent reports that bee colonies in California are buzzing with ag­gressive Africanized bees are' ridiculous because the so-called "killers" have never been ob­jectively ident_,ifi~d, Esch said. 
W. German spy scandal scale grows 
BONN, West Germany -Officials yesterday announced the defection of a diplomat from Communist East Germany, while authorities ques­tioned and then released a security official they said was suspected of being a double agent. 
The events were the latest in a spreading spy scandal that has shaken the government of Chancel­lor Helmut Kohl and prompted reor­

Government  sources  identified  

the diplomat as Martin Winkler, former charge d'affaires at the East German Embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina The sources, insisting on anonymity, said Winkler came to West Germany on Sunday.

Pasquale Anastasio, owner of The Commons on Eddy St., asserted, "I think our reputation speaksfor itself. We never have been, nor are we now, involved in any type of legal problem. We're completely clean." 
Anastasio cited the fact that his bar "relates to a more conservative type of clientele" as the reason he has escaped the problems that hang over the Five Points.

Killer bees may really be harmless 
The bees in question allegedly are the descendants of an aggressive African strain that escaped near Sao Paulo, Brazil, in 1957 and mated with bees native to Brazil. 
For years, reports circulated that the highly aggressive descendants were on their way from Brazil to the United States, but Esch said there are many different strains of bees in­habiting Brazil. 
"I doubt that these bees are even from Brazil," Esch said. 
"I've collected samples of bees in Indiana, Michigan, Tennessee and in Brazil. Many of them were classified by University of California resear­chers _!1,5 the sam.e.§!fain," Esch said.

ness, Esch said there is no difference between common European honeybees and the African bees that have gained a reputation for ex­treme aggression. 
He said the so-called "killers" could have been on the loose in this country for years. "There's no real control over what is imported; it is possible for beekeepers to return here with bees in small cagesin their pockets. If they put the bees in a hive, they're going to be released into the environm~nt." 
The biggest problem with reports of"killer" bees, Esch said, is the hy~­teria that can result. The bees are not as dangerous as they are reported to be, and commonsense should be the rule so as not to provoke any bee.

Peaceful Boesak feared by apartheid government 

In recent months we have witnessed the South African police state coming under siege. The scale of repression has increased dramati­cally. Well over 2,000 opponents ofapartheid have been detained without trial and many hav.e been tortured. More than 600 protesters have been killed by the edgy, trigger-happy police and military. There has been a sys­tematic rounding up of black leadership in a desperate attempt to crush political opposi­tion to the country's new apartheid constitu­tion. 
Peter Walshe 
guest column 
Three articulate churchmen have been at the forefront of this anti-apartheid struggle: Bishop Desmod Tutu (Nobel Peace Prize, 1985), Father Beyers Naude (General Secretary of the South African Council of Churches and Honorary Doctorate, Univer­sity of Notre Dame, 1985) and Father Allan Boesak (President of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, guest lecturer at Notre Dame, 1981 ). Three days ago the regime struck at Boesak, South Africa's leading theologian, detaining him as he prepared to lead a massive nonviolent protest-a march to Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Townwhere Nelson Mandela, a leader of the outlawed African Na­tional Congress is In the 21st year of his life sentence for treason against apartheid. The South African government knows that Boesak symbolizes a prophetic Christian stance against apartheid and wants him out of the way. 
Who is Boesak, this charismatic and prop­hetic figure? He was born in 1946, a "Coloured" South African, a person of mixed ethnic background. A member of the Afrikaner dominated, segregated Dutch Reformed Church, he entered the ministry in Its "Coloured" Mission Church andwent on to complete his doctoral studies at the Theologi­cal Academy of Kampen In the Netherlands. En route to that doctorate he spent time In the United States at Union Theological. His publications include "Farewell to Innocence. A Socio-ethlcal Study on Black Theology and Power;" "The Finger ofGod. Sermons on Faith and Responsibility;" and "Black and Reformed. Apartheid, Uberation and the Cal­vinist Tradition." 
Since 1976 Boesak has been student chaplain at the Universityofthe Western Cape (a segregated, "Coloured" Institution). Boesak has been in the forefront of the struggle to desegregate the white Dutch Reformed Church (the church of the apar-



Saying goodbye is an important part of college 
Two weeks ago Tumbles died. Tu111bles has been my dog since I was five years old; we grew up together and we were pals. Fifteen years together is a long time, and it was very hard to saygoodbye.lt made me think ofmany other times I have had to say goodbye. As I carried his trembling little body to the animal hospital that Sunday, I knew It was for the last time ... and I knew It was time to say goodbye. I thought about how many times in other situations my refusal to say goodbye has dragged things out painfully. 
Heidi Cerneka 
simply said 
Most of us are lucky that we have oppor­tunities to say goodbye. If at no other time, in coming to college, we had to say goodbye to family and friends. This Is a hard but very Im­portant lesson to learn. Saying goodbye is of­ten not permanent, but the important lesson we learn Is letting go. As we leave for college each year we let go once again of the friends from home. Hopefully, we know that we have had good times together and will see each ot-

her again, but that goodbye is still very dif­ficult. 
Saying goodbye is hard but often necessary and letting go Is not always just in relation­ships. We need to learn to let go ofsituations, places and bad memories. And finally, we need to be able to say, "It hurts to let go, but I am okay," or "I am not okay." It still hurts to think that the next time I go home, my pal wiU not greet me at the door orsit on my lap while we watch television together. I know, however, that Tumbles was In a lot ofpain and that knowledge put me in a lot of pain. It was time to let go. I am very thankful for his fifteen years of companionship and devotion and I wish it could have continued ... but it could not. Often we feel foolish when we are sad over goodbyes. As I cried all the way home from the animal hospital, I felt really stupid crying over a dog. When I got home, however, I found out I was not the only person hurting. In allowing myself to show my hurt, I was able to share it. Saying goodbye and letting go is not easy, but the feeling ofloneliness or anger is important to acknowledge. Often goodbyes are a sad topic of discussion, but homesick­ness and the missing ofold friends from home makes it an appropriate topic for an early

theid establishment), and in 1982 he was elected president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches. The same World Al­liance Conference in Ottawa expelled the white South African Dutch Reformed Church for heresy -for its persistent commitment to segregation and apartheid. 
Uke Tutu, Boesak is a patron and founder of the non-racial United Democratic Front, a massive alliance of organizations which has opposed the new apartheid constitution. The Front has consistently called for a National Convention in which the existing regime would sit down with legitimate black leaders to negotiate a new non-racial, democratic constitution for the country. The alternative, Boesak correctly points out, is the continued drift into the brutalities ofcivil war. 
Speaking two years ago at the national launching of the United Democratic Front in Cape Town, Boesak called for an "undivided South Africa that shall belong to all its people; an open democracy from which no South African shall be excluded; a society in which the human dignity of all shall be respected. We are here to say that there are rights that are neither conferred by nor derived from the state; you have to go back beyond the dim mist of eternity to understand their origin: they are God-given. And we are not here to beg for those rights; we are here to claim 
school year talk. It is important to feel lonely and sad, but it is just as important to let go and move ahead to meet the whole new world that college or any change has to offer.

them." Boesak concluded his address with a moving reference to the great hymn of freedom, "Nkosi Sikilel i Afrika" (God Save Africa): "I know that today we are singing that hymn with tears in our eyes. We are singing it while we are bowed down by the weight of oppression and battered by winds ofInjustice. We are singing it while our elderly languish In resettlement camps, and our children are dying of hunger In the 'homelands.' We are singing It now while we suffer under the brutality of apartheid, and while the blood of our children Is calling to God from the streets of our nation." But, he went on, "we must work for the day when we shall sing It as free black South Africans. We shall sing it when here, in South Africa, whites and blacks wiU have learned to love one another and work together in building a truly good and beautiful land" (A. Boesak, "Black and Reformed," Orbis, New York, 1984, pp. 155-163 ). 
This is the man feared by President Botha and his security forces. This is the man they have thrown into prison.

The winner oflast year's campus entertainer of the year award, James Mapes hypnotized over fifty people in the Washington Hall last W ednes­day night. These people Mapes successfully hypnotized were asked to come up to the stage for what was to be an amazing two and a half hours. 
With the sound ofmusic and touch of Mapes hands, the hyp­notized students fell asleep while standing up. Mapes explained the process and aquainted himself to the audience. While the subjects slept soundiy Mapes explained that 20 minutes ofhypnotic sleep is equivalent to two and a half hours of normal sleep. 
Mapes painted a scene in the minds ofthe hypnotized students. They were told they were on a spaceship on their way to another planet. According to the descrip­tion ofthe travel the astronauts and their chairs shook violently as if the velocity ofthe spaceship created the vibration; the hands and legs of the subjects lifted up as if they were floating in air. 
When the students were told the temperature was very hot or very cold, they acted accordingly to reduce any discomfort. They huddied together to use body heat as a means or they took off articles ofclothing to minimize the warmth. Mapes ordered them to reach out and press a certain colored button and the hypnotized students followed him instantly. 
"Look to your left. There is a large flower. The flower is very funny. It is laughing. Wait! There is a hideous green monster approach­ing to the right." 
When the students were described the characteristics ofthe flower, the hypnotized students pointed and laughed. Instantly their reaction changed when they were told the monster was approaching them. Tears and terror were visible in the eyes ofthe hypnotized stu­dents. Some clung to their chairs for security. 
Mapes set two scenes in time. He described the popular dance ofthe time. He told the students to dance. The students did the twist as if they

were in the 40's. One subject, Stu· dent Body President Bill Healy, ran offthe stage and danced in the balcony. Healy ran back on stage and continued to dance while anot­her student could only move his hands and body. "I was a non­believer. But under hypnosis I could not even lift my feet," said freshman Andy Shannon. 
One hypnotized student was asked to pick-up the dollar bills that Mapes threw on to the stage. "lfyou can pick up those bills you can have them,"said Mapes. Each time the student bent lower Mapes said the bills have gotten heavier. The stu­dent was unable to pick-up the dollars bills. 
"Did you want the money," ques­tioned Mapes. "Yes," replied the hypnotized student guiltily. 
"Positive thinking never works for a negative thinker. It makes the person feel guilty," addressed Mapes to the audience. 
One of the most incredible parts ofMapes performance was the regression ofthree students back to the age of 12 and then further back to the age offive. The hypnotized students signed their names at their present age. As they regressed back in age their handwriting, posture, as well as their mannerisms changed drastically. 
"Have you had your birthday yet?" questioned Mapes. ''Yes,"said the five year ·old Maggie. She then described all her friends who were at her party and also her favorite gift. Then Mapes asked the other five year old boy what he enjoyed doing in kindergarten. "Well, you know how you spray paint on a paper... then you fold it over ... it looks like a butterly," he replied. "What do you want to be when you grow up?" asked Mapes. "A cow­boy," was his reply. 
The impressive perroremance Wednesday night dazzled even the sceptics in the Washington Hall. "He was awesome. The best thing was his attitude. He has such a positive attitude," said Bill Healy. By the various incredible illiustra­tions, Mapes displayed that every sense can be affected through hyp­nosis. "Everything is created by imagination," said Mapes. Mapes proved that the mind determines reality. "Hallucination is self­created. We impose what we believe to be reality onto others." 
Mapes related his incredible performance to various situations in life. He used hypnosis to illustrate that people project their own self­image onto others. He wanted you "to screen out everything around you which was negative, identify those things that were positive and amplify them to your best advantage," said Norris Harding. 
Mapes completed his under­graduate degeree in psychology and mastered in theatre in California. He worked as an actor on soap operas and broadway. When Mapes lost a considerable amount of weight through hypnosis, he bc:came interested in this incredible field ofstudy. Self-taught, Mapes has mastered the intricate details of hypnotization. He now owns a clinic in Conneticut. Mapes travels to numerous colleges around the country to give demonstrations in f.typnotization extrodinaire.

The emerald city-there's no place like home 
Rev. Robert Griffin 
Letters to a lonely God 
Notre Dame surprises me when I catch sight of It from the sky lane of Piedmont as we come In for a ian· ding at 2:30 In the afternoon. It looks surprisingly modest from the air, not even as pretty as the neat fields we've been traveUing over since the plane left Dayton. The thunder that waits to be shaken down over the stadium during the football season doesn't signify Its closeness by as much as a rumble. 
I have to make an act of faith that those modest brown buildings are the facilities of a landmark place as wonderful of the Emerald City of Oz. The doubts are persistent: "Our Lady's school takes itself too seriously. As a·grove ofacademe, Notre Dame doesn't amount to a fleabite on a bear's rump," to.clean up a Down East expression. In an hour, after I have seen the sun reflecting on the lake, and felt the deep peace that makes the trees, sheltering the Grotto as a foreground to Sacred Heart Church, seem like part ofa religious ex­perience, I will be safe again as a true believer. The question Is, as I unbuckle my seat belt, should I want to believe, or does an accep· tance of the Notre Dame myths mean I've been taken in by the great 
deception? 
I spent the summer In one ot the 
busiest neighborhoods ofNew York 
City; and I spent the first week of 
August as the celebrant ofa highly 
romantic wedding in Vienna, 
Austria. Since May, I've ridden to 
the subway stop where Bernhard 
Goetz played the vigilante; and I've 
stood on the spot in an imperial city 
where Mozart finished his 
"Requiem." I love Manhattan in all 
its moods. Maybe it's sad, like a 
dying star; but on Fifth Avenue, 
with money in my pocket, on the 
way to dinner, I AM THE WORLD! 
Vienna was lovely, as though the 
picture books were true, and I felt 
like dancing as though I were Gene 
Kelly as an American in Paris. 
But last night, at dinner, I felt the perfect peace ofbeing at home. There's a real world out there in the suburbs beyond the airpon; it's big, busy, and interesting; and I need wiU leave me reestless. The Empire State Building reminds me, a homesick priest, of the Golden Dome. The Blue Danube may have inspired a waltz; but it doesn't make my hear sing like the sight ofthe St. 
Joe river seen downhill from St. Mary's. ' 
One evening, in Greenwich Village, I was caught in a thun· derstorm. I moved from doorway to awning, from awning to doorway, playing hide-and-seek with the downpours ofrain. I noticed how pretty the buildings were as the waterdrops formed beads oflight on the brick. Whenever the rain stopped to catch Its breath, wetness hung In the air as a shimmer ofthe darkness. The trees seemed fresh and alive and hopeful, free oftheir usual desperation in a struggle for survival. As for Wordsworth on a bridge in London, surprised by the city, free ofsmoke in the early morning, sun as a pan ofdivinity, so, for me, those narrow streets of the Village took on the charm ofa young girl in April picking flowers in a field. The walk home, despite the soaking I got, matched the contentment I feel walking Darby O'Gill II, my cocker spaniel, under the Indiana stars. The evening made me happy with the realization that I would be going back soon to the campus where the miracles oftrans· figuration are not as rare as rainstroms in a dry year when the cisterns are half empty. 
You don't need to ask if the myths are true ifyou're living in a place worthy of the dreams you had while in temporary exile. Are all the stories true that we tell ourselves on alumni weekends? Are we smug and provincial as we pat ourselves on the backs as Catholics who enjoy being Number One? The question seems as useless to me as aguing about the quality ofmy faith in God. God has told me, through the tradi· tions I accept, as much as I need to know to save my soul; or to help others, if they will accept me as a spokesman for the same religious traditions, to save their souls. Maybe somebody else has a better faith or wiser traditions; that's his problem. My faith, for me, is like the rock ofages; his faith, for me, could be like the rolling stone that gathers no moss. Notre Dame is the snug harbor where I've anchored my soul as well as I can. Here, with the help ofGod, I will wait for the sun· set and evening star when all the voyages, except one, are over. The Galilean fisherman will be pleased to find me here, I think, when they finally come to pilot me over the heavy seas, though it sounds risky to say so. Nothing is cenain under the Golden Dome but the bookstore and football. 
Twenty years ago at this time, I came back to this mid-western school, which I loved as a student in the late Fontes, feeling slightly tragic. I was at a turning point, after barely surviving family disasters. I got offthe train from an over-night trip, about as cheerful as a prisoner on the way to the slammer. The beauty ofthe campus left me lonely, like an alien distant from his homeland. The trees and the lawns were the fiefdom ofstrangers; they suffered an overkill ofgreenness like the plushness ofa cemetery. 
Notre Dame could become jour­ney's end, the land ofdeath, if I wasn't careful. Homesickness made me fear the worst. Nobody I wanted to see lived on this campus. The family and friends I missed as though they had burled me were 800 miles away. 
We don't die, though our hearts seem broken. I survived the winter. I kept on surviving winters until I got Into the habit. Now, after twenty years, I have no place else to go that would mean as much. 
For me, Notre Dame could never be a great deception. My conver· sion was gradual; the special grace of this place is like the truth you become aware ofone day at a time as you're growing up. It Is the Emerald City that Is personally mine. In New York, I'm a summer visitor; In Europe, I'm a tourist. Here, I'm on turf that belongs to me as a fatherland. I hope to God It Is a lasting city. I hope that for you, It Is a lasting city· that you will always come back to as a home. It takes a heap oflivin' to make a dorm a home. I hope that your time here will be filled with the pleasures of life. On bittersweet days, remember that nothing In tradition and legend is as wonderful as you are. The ghosts have had their time here. Sorin, Rockne, Dooley, and Leahy will not walk this way again. Now It is your turn. You·are the generation that makes Notre Dame alive in this decade. Ask not what the myths can do for you. Ask what you can do for the myths.

Bosco leads BYUpastBC in Classic 
A88ociated Press 

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.j. -Robbie Bosco completed 35 of 53 passes for a career-high 508 yards and Glen Kozlowski caught 10 for 241 as Brig­ham Young opened defense of its 1984 national championship last night by defeating Boston College 28-14 in the third annual Kickoff Classic. 
The victory stretched the nation's longest winning streak to 25 games and got BYU off and winging in the opening game ofthe college football season. 
Bosco and Kozlowski teamed up on four long-range passes to set up BYU's first three touchdowns and then put the game away on a 22-yard touchdown pass with 8:32 left to play. 
It was Bosco's third touchdown pass of the contest. He also flipped a 6-yarder to Mark Bellini to start the scoring early in the second period and fired a 12-yarder to Bellini late in the third quarter to snap a tie after BYU had blown a 14-0 lead. Bellini caught nine passes for Ill yards. 
Boston College unveiled a new starting quarterback in Shawn Hal­loran, who spent the last two seasons backing up Heisman Trophy winner Doug Flutie. The fourth-year junior got off to a shaky start and finished with 18 completions in 3 7 attempts for 165 yards. He was inter­cepted three times while Bosco had four passes picked off. 
Boston College, 10-2 a year ago and Cotton Bowl champion, scored on a 1-yard run by John Mihalik in the second period and tied the score on Troy Stradford's 5-yard run at 
9:27 of the third quarter. 

But the Cougars had something to prove to a Giants Stadium crowd of 5_1,227 and a television audience in 92 percent of the nation, and Bosco answered the tying touchdown with a 51-yard bomb to Kozlowski at the Eagles' 12-yard line. The next play was his second touchdown pass to Bellini and put BYU ahead to stay. 
Despite last season's champion­ship, BYU was only ranked No. 10 in this year's Associated Press preseason poll.

Irish add Ramblers to slate to fill Dec. 7 void 
The Notre Dame men's basketball schedule was finalized yesterday when it was announced that a home game with Loyola of Chicago would fill the one remaining date, Dec. 7. That date previously had been filled by UCLA, but the Irish-Bruins con­test was switched to Jan. 18 earlier this week for television after I.SU, originally scheduled to play Notre 
Dame  on  NBC-lV  that  day,  was  
forced  to  cancel  because  of  a  
scheduling conflict.  

Notre Dame was left one game short of the 28-game regular season limit, and had been searching franti­cally for someone to play at a time when most schools already have their schedules finalized. The Ramblers still were shy of 28 games themselves and had Dec. 7 left open on their calendar by design for final exams. 
But when the opportunity to play Notre Dame came, Loyola jumped. The kind of exposure the Ramblers could receive by playing the Irish was exactly what they were looking for after a successful season and a trip to the NCAA Tournament last year. 
Alfredrlck Hughes may not be at Loyola anymore, but Coach Gene Sullivan remains. Sullivan, a Notre Dame graduate, applied for the Notre Dame head coaching job when Digger Phelps got It, and over the years has carried a bad-boy image with him In college basketball circles because of his outspoken nature. 
Generally, the Irish would shy away from playing a team like Loyola because ofSullivan, but Notre Dame didn't have too many more cards In Its hand this late in the scheduling game. 
The last meeting ofthe two teams was In 1979, and Notre Dame holds a 22-1 record In the series, which dates back to 1924. 
The game will be a one-shot deal, with Notre Dame· not having to play a return date in Chicago. 
In another basketball scheduling note, the Feb. 26 home game with DePaul has been moved up one night to ·Feb. 25, also because of television.

Faust pleased with hitting in team's first tuneup 
By LARRY BURKE 
AsslstontSports Editor 

With slightly more than two weeks to go before the season opener against Michigan, Irish coach Gerry Faust put his football team through the first of two preseason scrimmages in Notre Dame Stadium yesterday afternoon. And while Faust felt that the execution left something to be desired at times, he was pleased with the intensity and physical play demonstrated by his squad during the two-hour session. 
"There were some mistakes, but I was pleased with the hitting," noted Faust. "We wanted to play a lot of different people, and also to inter­change different players on the first and second units, and we ac­complished that. We tried working all of our quarterbacks on each of the two offensive units and in dif­ferent situations to see how they 
performed under fire."  
Starter  Steve  Beuerlein,  
rehabilitating  from  off-season  
shoulder surgery,  was  one  of the  

quarterbacks who saw action in the scrimmage. The junior signal-caller performed well, mixinJ the run with 

TerryAndrysiak 

the short pass to drive the first of­fensive unit within field goal range on the first series of plays, and hit­ting sophomore wideout Tim Brown over the middle for a 30-yard completion on his second series before giving way to sophomore backup Terry Andrysiak. 
"I thought Beuerlein played well," said Faust. "We didn't work him too much this time, but he's feeling fine. He'll play more next week." 
The first half of the scrimmage consisted of six series of plays, which Faust divided between Beuer­lein, Andrysiak, sophomore Tom Byrne, and freshman Steve Belles. 
Andrysiak started off shaky, having his first pass deflected at the line of scrimmage and picked off by linebacker Rick DiBernardo. But the sophomore settled down and moved his charges into field goal range on his next try on the strength of a 15-yard rollout completion to tight endJoel Williams. Hal Von Wyl followed with a 52-yard field goal at­tempt that hit the left upright and fell through to open the scoring. On "and also to see how various players his next series, Andrysiak picked up performed in those situations. At 15 yards on a nifty bootleg but saw this point we're concentrating on his unit turn the ball over on downs. testing different people, to see how 
Byrne worked the fifth series, and they respond. Next week we'll con­like Andrysiak, was picked offon his centrate more on Michigan's of­first pass attempt. It was sophomore fensive and defensive styles." 

Belles was the standout in the second half, completing three of four pass attempts to set up a Carney 44-yard field goal in the first two­minute drill. The freshman hit Brown over the middle for 12, found fullback Frank Starns on a screen for seven, then hooked up with tight end Tom Rehder for a 25-yard completion t.o set up Carney's kick. 
Freshman split end Steve Alaniz had two receptions in the second half, the first a leaping catch over the middle on a pass from Byrne and the second a sliding grab on a toss from sophomore Pat Pesavento.

It was Belles and reserve wideout Mike James that provided the most excitement of the firs1 half, however. On his first pass attempt, the freshman quarterback hooked up with frosh flanker Ray Dumas for a 15-yard completion. Belles followed with a pair of 20-yard completions to James, the first a sliding grab over the middle and the second a diving catch on the sideline. On a fourth-and-goal play from the two-yard line, freshman tailback Mark Green found a hole over right tackle and scored the day's first offensive touchdown.

Wolverine stripe has kept Irish working hard 


The Michigan game is only 15 days away, but members of the Notre Dame football team have had the game on their minds for months. Sometime last winter, senior Tony Furjanic came up with the idea ofa "Wolverine stripe." 
In simple terms, the Wolverine stripe was a small strip of shaved skin on each player's arm somewhere near the wrist. The purpose ofthe device was to serve as a reminder of the next season, the first game ofwhich, obviously, was Michigan. 
"Every time we were tired or had too much to do and didn't want to go work out, we could just look down and see the stripe," is how Allen Pinkett described its sig­nificance. "It was there to remind us of the national cham­pionship we were going to win, to remind us that we had to go work out." 
Pinkett has a hard time finding his Wolverine stripe these days, as it is barely visible. He doesn't need it anymore, though. No one has to tell him or his teammates what awaits them two weeks from now in Ann Arbor, and no longer is it tough to find the incentive to go work out.

National media attention this summer may have been focused on the near-Senate campaign of Georgia football coach Vince Dooley, but another college coach a little closer to home had his own taste of a political career. Yes, folks, Notre Dame basketball coach Digger Phelps was asked to run for the U.S. Senate in 1986. 
For Phelps, the request by former U.S. Senator Vance Hartke that he run for the Senate against Indiana incum­bent Dan Quayle was flattering, and, at the same time, an offer he hardly expected. The Irish coach quickly put to rest any rumors that a political career might be on the horizon, though, insisting that he would stick to coaching for now. 
Jeff Blumb 
Sports Editor 


All the "Phelps for Senate" hubub started when Hartke watched Phelps'June 20 speech to the National Press Club on C-SPAN, the public affairs cable TV network. Phelps, never one to hold back any words no matter the subject, spoke on the problems in the educational system at all levels and the win-at-all-costs attitude in sports, among ot­her things. 
Hartke, a Democratic senator from Indiana for 18 years and now practicing law in the Washington, D.C., area, told Phelps he thought the speech was one of the best he had heard in a long time, and that he thought the 14-year Notre Dame coach could beat Quayle in the '86 senatorial race. 
Phelps, who says that he does not portray himself as eit­her a Democrat or a Republican at speaking engagements in order to maintain his credibility, figured he ended a cam­paign that never really got offthe ground by telling Hartke "no." Still, Hartke says the Phelps campaign is not yet over. "I take 'definitely not' to mean 'maybe,"' Hartke told the South Bend Tribune's Jack Colwell. "I think Phelps .can win." 
Phelps maintains that he will stick to coaching, but let him make a trip to the Final Four or the like this season and watch how fast he jumps back into the '86 race. 
You have to wonder, though, if Hartke thinks a basket­ball coach could become Indiana's next Democratic senator, why he did not go after Phelps' good friend, In­diana University basketball coach Bobby Knight. Knight, certainly no less popular in the state and equally out­spoken, would only figure to have an even better chance of winning against Quayle. Then again, how many senators have you ever seen throw a chair? Not exactly political grace, you would have to say. 
 
Speaking of Phelps and the Irish basketball team, the recent loss ofassistant Pete Gillen to Xavier is going to hurt a lot. Not to take anything away from the present assistants, but Gillen was very excellent at his job. He was a top-notch recruiter, solid with the X's and O's and related well to the players. In fact, Basketball News rated him the fifth best asSistant in the country last year. 
Gillen had been waiting for the right head coaching op­portunity to come along for some time, and he couldn't have been any better prepared when the Xavier offer came along. Phelps' team will survive the loss of Gillen, as it has six other times when assistants have gone on to become head coaches, but itwill be strange not to see the energetic coach on the bench this season. 
On top oflosing Gillen, there is a chance that Phelps also may be losing assistant Gary Brokaw to the head coaching job at Rutgers. Brokaw is a native of New Brunswick, N.J., the location of Rutgers, and it is a natural for him to coach there even though he attended Notre Dame as an under­graduate. 
The Rutgers head job sits vacant today, and Phelps has been pushing Brokaw for the job through some ofhis many New York area contacts, including New York sports guru Sonny Werblin. It appears that Brokaw has only an outside chance at the job, but, as with most things in college sports, it certainly is not out ofthe question. For that reason, don't be surprised if Phelps is looking for another new assistant in the near future.
