area project 

By Brigid Rafferty Staff Reporter 
The Indiana Commission of Higher Education has given St. Mary's a grant of $15,414 to be used by the Government in a community recreation project with the St. Joseph County Recreation Council. 
"The prog.ram consists of a series of workshops and clinics for the public, with the view to train and retrain community leaders engaged in recreational programs for young adults and older teenagers," explained Louis Tondreau, Government Depart­ment chairman and director of this project. 
"We're in need of special types of programs to assist them. We want to make people aware of inner city resources, and build up proper human relations. We hope to attract recreation leaders from different areas in the northern districts of Indiana," he said. 
The 15 activities in the series are scheduled from November through May, and will include sessions on crafts, gardening, and other issues, as well as clinics on various sports.

Former ND professor 
Murphy urges awareness of social injustice 
by Stu• ('art>y Starr Ht•portt>r 

In a speech at the Morris Inn last night, form"r Notre Dame professor Fat11er Laurence 
Murphy  urged  Americans  to  
"Internalize their awareness"  of  
social injustice.  

"There's no comfort in inac­tion," Murphy told the conference on Technology Transfer in the Furtherance of Distributive .Justice. "People who don't ac­tively oppose injustice sin against prudence. that is, decision and moral action." 
Murphy referred to Socrates' injunction to pity the man who pPrpetrates injustice more than his victim . and added, "If there is no moral decision, then there is no truth. no justice, and we are lesser nwn." 
Now a Maryknoll priest, Murphy graduated from the Naval Ae11demy at Annapolis and served in the Navy for six years before Pntering the seminary. After his ordination in 1954, he did graduate work in philosophy at Y11le University before coming to Notre llamP. In addition to earning his l'h'D and teaching in the Philosophy and Theology depart­nwnts for five years, Murphy was instrummtal in founding CILA. He 1s presently on the staff of the <'t•nter for Humanistic Studies at St•ton IIall University. 
S;u'l'irit•t•s eallt•d fot· 

Noting the "distinctively <'hristian" belief in the value of suffering as a reflection of Christ's sacrifice, Murphy asserted, "As Christians, we can accept the sacrifices called for by the harsh

demands of justice, including a significant redistribution of resources throughout the world." 
Murphy observed that in order to practice social justice, Christians must be strongly convinced of the intrinsic merit of the ministry of justice. In addition, they must have perseverance, which he termt-d "often the obscure side of courage", and the experience of commitment shared with a community. 
.Justict• "t•sst>ntial" 

Terming the ministry of justice "t•ssential" to the nature of the Church, Murphy said, "Christians still suffer from an inadequate understanding of the Church. Too oftm Roman Catholics see the Church only as an institution, not as a community of God's people." 
"Participation in the ad­ministra lion of justice is inherently part of the Church's purpose," Murphy daimed. In addition, he noted that the three traditional views of what constitutes the Christian vision-­doctrine, fellowship, and service-­are all necessary elements of social ministry. 
Murphy affirmed that the Church has been concerned with the problem of social justice throughout the twentieth century, but particularly in recent years. 
"Today the Church is making an effort to understand social justice and to deal with social structures under which human rights are protected or abused," Murphy said. 
Murphy also cited a statement from the Synod of Bishops which met in 1971 which read in part, "We have been able to perceive many serious injustices ... which stifle freedom and keep mankind from building a more peaceful and fraternal world." 
Although advocating con­sciousness-raising as a way to become more aware of issues, Murphy commented, "Con­sciousness-raising is a liberation from something; forming a con­science, on the other hand, is a step toward liberating for something." 
Murphy urged that social justice be seen in the contest of "terribly complex" problems, such as population, food and en­vironmental crises, the threat of 
violence between nations and from 
terrorist groups, and the great disparity that exists between rich and poor. "When we speak of

Murphy admitted, "Success is

Observer Anniversary 

iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii tho m as o'neil 
This week the Observer is nine years old, a publica ton born out of the dissension and turbulence of the 1960's, and one which today is a survivor, historically, of a disastrous war, of Watergate, as well as our own private crises and oppressions. There should, we tell ourselves, be cause for celebration. But all week there has been an uncomfortable silence and lack of enthusiasm among our editors over our birthday. 
The hush, the lack of excitement is suggestive of our con­temporary performance. There was a time, years ago, when it was fashionably martyr-like to erect a porcelain idol to your ideals: the so-called radicals of the 60's gave Notre Dame The Observer, and espoused, within its pages, the belief that a war should be ended, 
and that marijuana, the eventual opium of a generation, should be legalized. 
Their idealism was courageous, commendable and substantially American: it made them heroes, and especially in a post-Vietnam, post-Watergate era where the campus issues, generated by this newspaper, have delt with matters as seemingly non-sensical as the price of a basketball ticket or the right to hang football banners alluding to prophylactics. 
We have since become conservative by comparison, even apathet­ic by nature. The article printed opposite to this page is published penultimately to remind us of our history, to resurrect those idols which have since become vague legends or inessential names, and ultimately to undercut our new-found conservatism with radical re-direction and renewed enthusiasm. The conservatism we've embraced in the recent past was done so to make this newspaper a more professional publicaton. We should remind ourselves first, however, that we are a campus publication, decidedly less stoic t­han some other publications, and being independent of the ad­ministration, understandably more critical of everyone around us for the purpose of purification and progress. 
Today the Observer's reputation is Jess than enviable: members of its staff have been "mooned" and laughed at. It is not, however, altogether disliked or unaffective. It's simply less assertive than it should be, and less dedicated to the informative and educational task to which it is committed in theory. We suffer today from a small and over-worked staff: our offices at night and during the day seem empty and abandoned, but this was also the cross of our founders in the '60's, and although we have had greater numbers to help in its daily construction in the recent past, we have no real cause to complain today. We have every ingredient among us to produce a superior publication, albeit we are sometimes tired of 
trying. 
The article opposite this, by Robert Sam Anson, the Observer's founder and today a respectable journalist, should remind us of that original enthusiasm and dedication. This is not to imply, emphatically, that we have not improved the Observer in nine years. It is to frighten us into improvement perhaps by suggesting it. And there are, certainly, areas in which we have regressed in time, although they may be considered inconsequential by some. 
There is always, some tell us, room for improvement, and by rededicating ourselves in good faith on our anniversary, to t­morrow, to making this publication more constructive and colorful in the future, we are insuring ourselves and this campus of at least some eventual measure of improvement. And we may be insuring ourselves also of some future celebration over our anniversary. In the meantime, we humbly applaud ourselves, over a bottle of wine or a beer at Corby's, for a job generally well-intentioned, and well­done. It is, after all, our birthday.

SB weather still unpredictable 
by Thomas J. Conaty Staff Reporter 

When the ND-SMC students arrive at school in early Sep­tember, they have usually packed away their cut-offs and t-shirts and unpacked their sweaters and coats, preparing for the well­known South Bend weather. This year, however, has been different. Although spotted with rain, the South Bend weather has been characterized by warm weather and sunny skies. 
Local weather forecasters have been puzzled by this strange oc­curance. Apart from the "few" nights of 30's and 40's the South Bend temperature has averaged in the high 60's or lower 70's. There has even been days in the high 80's that resulted in a "country club" atmosphere around duLac. 
Even statistics are confusing. This past August the number of cloudy days outnumbered the sunny days 5 to 1. In an average Indiana month the cloudy days outnumbered the sunny days 2.5 to 1. 
The winter usually dominates for six months and the fall and spring time lasts anywhere from one afternoon to one and one-half months. 
The most violent month in Indiana is March where an average of forty-four tornadoes are recorded. Many of them, however, are so small that they could easily fit into a closet. 
Notre Dame and St. Mary's freshmen do not realize how for­tunate they are to have this type of weather for in the past years snow covered both campuses within a month after school started. 
The earliest it has snowed since 

1940 was on September 18, 1967 and 
the latest was on May 30, 1951. 
If anything, it has been the rain that has dampened the utopian weather in the NO community. This however, is not much for according to Erv Wesley of the South Bend Weather Bureau the amount of rain in the South Bend area has been half of what was expected. 
"This does not necessarily mean we are in for a bad winter," Wesley says, "but speaking from past years~ we could possibly expect a rough one." 
Wesley also said that in a period of five or six years the weather conditions even out. This means that if for two years or so the weather is colder than usual then possibly the next two or three years might be warmer. Then the following year may have normal weather conditions, warm summer and cold winter. He did emphasis that this took no less than five years. 
Whatever the statistics say,the students are quite satisfied. Going to classes in cut-offs and wearing t­
shirts to the football ·games' are .... welcome changes. 
Another Republican, Robert 

Taylor, easily defeated Democrat 
John L. Bilancio by a margin of 
over a thousand votes. In the fifth 
council District, 
In the most overwhelming 

victory of the Democrats, Kopc­
zynski collected 85 percent of the 
vote as he defeated Republican 
Michael Wells for the sixth district 
council seat. 
Democrats also swept the races 'for Councilman at Large, winning 
all three seats by substantial 
majorities. 
Democrats MaryAdams,Richard 

Dombrowski and Frank Horvath 
all won with vote totals of over 
20,000. They defeated Republicans 
H. Chris Overgaard, James R. Rice and Frank Slaby, Jr. andthe American Party candidate Leonard Copeland. 
The closest race in the area occurred in Goshen mayoral contest where the winning margin was onlv 12 votes. 
Low voting turnouts were cited

Slafkosky, seeking his first elective office in South Bend, commented, "we worked as hard as we could; I couldn't ask any more from the people who worked for me." The former Notre Dame football player plans to remain in politics and attempt to unite the Republican party. 
Slafkosky criticzed what he called the "terrible turnout", but thanked those people who did vote. 
Kronewitter, the Independent mayoral candidate, stated that he ran in order to talk about issues which affect the entire city and to see "if people will let go of traditional party ties." He con­eluded from his defeat that people were not ready to break these a ances.

Irish cornerback Tom Lopienski stacks up Navy's Gerry Goodwin. 
t

I 
by Ernie Torriero 

The question will be asked time and time again by countless members of the Notre Dame rebble and by those who cultivate the art of the trivia. "Who," they will ask with a characteristic gleam. a look which beckons the challenge of an answer, "is the only man in Notre Dame history to score on two blocked punts on two consecutive plays?" 
Quickly the answerer will probe deep into the caverns of his mind where instant replays of great moments in sport are so ever­securely treasured. There he will find the response he is looking for. 
It will all vividly come alive. It is late in the second quarter of the -17th meeting between two of college football's most bitter arch­rivals: Notre Dame and USC. The Trojans, in the lead 7-6, face a fourth and 21 situation an their own 26 yard line. Glen Walker goes back to punt. But moments after taking the snap, the Trojan number 39 b~comes oblivious in a forest of blue-shirts, as a bevy of Irish tacklers stream in upon Walker. Cornerback Luther Bradley hurdles his body through the air and makes contact with the pigskin Walker had tried to fruitlessly boom away. Senior cornerback Tom Lopienski spots the loose ball and falls on it in the end zone for an Irish touchdown. 
"We knew we could block that punt." Lopienski was to reflect later on. "The fullback turned out on me and I managed to get in on the punter. Then came that call." 
"The call" Lopienski was referring to was an offsides whistle against the Irish. The television instant replay clearly showed a Southern Cal interior lineman had moved. Irish coach Dan Devine was flushed with rage and a chorus of boos showered down upon the officials. 
"We were very frustrated at the time," said Lopienski as he though back on the situation. "We had to prove that the first block was not a fluke. The adrenlin was really flowing. I knew someone was going to get a piece of the ball again." 
Indeed the Irish instant replay 
worked to perfection. This time, 
strong safety Mike Banks spanked 
the ball back toward the Irish goal. 
The alert Lopienski once again 
zeroed in on the bouncing piece of 
leather. He scooped the ball up on 
the run and was escorted in for the 
touchdown by Mr. Ross Browner. 
Alertness is no stranger to Lopienski for he has been called upon many times in his career to aid the Irish in crucial situations. 
The 6-1, 175 pound Lopienski will hardly forget his baptism into the world of collegiate football. It came in the third quarter of the 1973 Southern Cal game and even Lopienski himself could not think of a better time to prove his worthiness. 
"Reggie Barnett had just gotten thrown ..out of the game," Lopiens){1 remembered. "I was his back-up and my assignment was to cover Lynn Swann. He made a touchdown catch right after I ·g& into the game. We were in man­coverage and it was either him or 
I. I felt so disappointed at the time because I felt I had let the team down." 
What Lopienski didn't mention was thet Swann was blanketed when he caught the pass and he was forced to haul the ball in with acrobatic-like precision. Swann, then an All-American selection is now on his way to becoming All­Pro for the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
"But I remembered that catch everytime I played USC," Lopienski continued. "That game probably gave me a boost. I realized then I could play at anytime and that I always must by ready." 
After spending last season as a back-up at the cornerback and strong-safety positions, the 21­year-old Akron, Ohio native came on strong in the spring to win a Hering Award and also clinch a starting cornerback position. So far this season, Lopienski has picked off three passes and returned them for a total of 60 yards. 
Lopienski emphasizes that the cornerback position is a thinking man's dream. "Each team has a strength," Lopienski explained. "I've got to play up to that strength. If a team has a strong 

Weston earns AP honors 
SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) ­Jeff Weston, whose 22 tackles blunted Navy's offense and whose 53-yard touchdown run on a pass interception lifted a sagging Notre Dame attack, was named Tuesday The Asso­ciated Press National College lineman of the week. 
By far. it was the best game I ever played," Weston said of last Saturday's 31-10 victory over the Navy's Midshipmen. 
The Irish offense was held to just six first downs and 80 yards net rushing but, unlike a week earlier in a seven-point loss to Southern California, the

• 
defense came to the rescue. 
"After the loss to USC, we had to prove to ourselves we could go out there and do the job," said Weston, a 6-foot-3, 248-pound sophomore tackle from Rochester, N.Y. "We were all pretty psyched up for the game." 
The Notre Dame defense scored two of the four Irish touchdowns and set up the oth­er two on a fumble recovery by Ross Browner and a pass inter­ception by Tom Eastman. Browner, a sophomore end, also scored the first Notre Dame touchdown after blocking a Navy punt and returning it 27 yards for the score. 
But it was Weston, contin­ually breaking through or around the Navy blockers, who provided the extra defensive ef­fort that kept the Midshipmen in check. 
"Everything was happening for me," he said. "They were running my way and all I could do was tackle." 
And tackle he did, finishing with five solo shots and 17 as­sists, including two for losses totaling eight yards. He also re­covered one of the five Navy fumbles. 
Weston now has 76 tackles for the season, second only to run­ningmate Steve Niehaus' 90. Weston leads the team in tack­ling for losses with 51 yards. 
In the fourth quarter, with the Irish holding a precarious 17-10 lead. Navy kicker Steve Dykes dropped back for a fourth-down punt. Instead, he passed. The ball saled into Weston's hands and the big lineman rambled 53 yards for the back-breaking touchdown. 
hard, real hard. It is not an easy life. Notre Dame would not be as good without the help of the prep team. In fact, sometimes the prepers are better than some of the teams we face." Lopienski runs a 4.6 in the forty yard dash and is sometimes used in returning punts. He has returned one punt this year for a 19 yard return. "I don't really mind returning punts," Lopienski reJected. "It's a challenge. But blocking punts is where it's at. I really love that part of the game." Lopienski 's love is not a blind pursuit. Rather it is a calculated science of which he is rapidly becoming a master. "I try to aim," Lopienski reterated with science-like precision, "for a spot six yards in front of the punter. It is here that Bob Golic <freshman middle linebacker) helps me the most. He forces the seam which enables be to come from the outside. We have different variations for each op­ponent. We go into a game knowing we can block a punt." 
If Lopienski goes into every game with that attitude, then many more opposing punters will have the shadowy figure of number 26 in blue etched in their minds in nightmarish-like remembrance. 

running attack then I must be prepared to watch for it. A cor­nerback has to play the total game. 
I'II stress certain things in practice. For example, when I know a team has a deep-threat, I'll practice pursuit all week." 
Lopienski feels tha defense is as good as in past years and he credits the people behind the scenes for that success. "The defensive line is full of workhorses and I'd like to think the secondary is as good as ever," he com­mented. "But the prepers are really of great help. They work

The Notre Dame Rugby 'A' team defeated John Carroll University of Cleveland this past weekend, 26-6. Shawn McDonald and Jim Kovac each scored twice for the Irish. ThP backs played extremely well as Notre Dame totally dominated the game. The win ups the team's record to 4-2. 
The 'B' team romped t a 32-0 victory over the John Carroll 'B' team. Kevin Diegan and Mark Janko led the Irish attack. The team's record now stands at 5-l. 
The Irish 'A' and 'B' teams both play at home this Saturday morning against the University of 
St. Louis.  •' •  ·  
******* ***  
The Notre Dame  soccer  team  shutout the  

University of Chicago 6-0 last Saturday. Fresh­man Bill Hagerty scored three goals to lead the Irish attack. Jim Donovan, Pat Flood and Jim Rice each added a goal as the Irish offense kept constant pressure on the Chicago defense. 
The Notre Dame defense, led by Jim Humboldt and John Thornton, prevented Chicago from ever mounting on attack. 
********** 
The Irish dominated in a series of weekend races between Purdue and the Notre Dame Rowing Club. The novice men swept a four-race series of 500 and 1000 meter pieces against three Purdue boats. The Junior Varsity bested Pur­due's varsity lightweights in 1000 and 2000 meter races, after losing the initial 500 meter piece. 
The Irish varsity took the 500 and 1000 meter races from Purdue's varsity heavyweights, but lost the 2000 meter piece by one boat-length. 
The men's crew closed their fall season with the weekend series and will start training next week for the spring. 
********** 
The Notre Dame Sailing Team traveled to Bloomington, Indiana this past weekend for the Hoosier Classic. This is a traditionally tough regatta and this year was no exception. Strong teams from Michigan, Purdue, Ohio Wesleyan and Wisconsin at Oshkosh were present. Michigan proved to be best suited to the con­dition as they walked away with the regatta. Ohio Wesleyan was a distant second, followed by Purdue. The Notre Dame team sailed con­sistently and came back with sixth place. Nine schools participated in the event. 
The Midwest Collegiate Sailing Association rankings are now out. Notre Dame is ranked fifteenth out of twenty-eight schools listed. This ranking is misleading, however, ND has sailed in more races than anyone else by far. Also, the team policy is to sail everyone who is interested in sailing, rather than just sailing the best people, as most schools do. The top three schools are Miami of Ohio (1 regatta), Wisconsin at Oshkosh (4 regattas) and Michigan State ( 1 regatta). For comparison, Notre Dame has sailed in seven events. In skipper rankings, Bryan Ramsay is the only ND skipper ranked and is seventeenth. 
This weekend the team will be sailing at An­napolis in the War Memorial Regatta sponsored by Navy. 
The Notre Dame Lacrosse Club closed out its 1975 fall season with a 16-6 victory over Purdue. Both the "A" and "B" teams had a hand in this 
victory as the "A" team played the first and fourth quarters while the "B" team played the middle periods for NO. 
Notre Dame jumped out to a 7-1 first period lead and were never in any trouble. Purdue's first quarter goal was the only one they scored against the first team defense of co-captain John Fatti, Dan Welch, John Mandico and Chris Bowie. This quartet made life easy for goalie Jim Scarola all day. 
Another non-scoring aspect of the game in which the Irish excelled was facing off. As he has all season, junior midfielder Jay Williams dominated the faceoffs by winning nine of thirteen. 
Offensively, the stickmen of Coaches Rich O'Leary and Sandy Cochran were led by club president Bob Thibodeau and co-captain Don Trabert. Thibodeau had one goal and three assists while Trabert turned the hat trick. 
Attackmen Tim Walsh and Tom Bingle each had two goals as did middies Bob Driscoll and Mark Flanigan. Mark Connelly, Roger Mon­forton, Jeff Johnson and Tom Mouch also scored for the Irish. 
The club will now hold a box lacrosse season in preparation for the spring season which starts in February. Anybody interested in playing box lacrosse should contact Mike Kinsella at 6939. 
********** 
Both the women's varsity and novice crew teams ended their fall season successfully last weekend, each defeating Grand Valley State and Purdue. 
In the varsity race the Notre Dame boat coxswained by Rose Gill and stroked by Mary Fitzsimons, came off the line slightly ahead of Purdue. The Purdue crew continually challenged the Notre Dame lead, but Notre Dame won the race, finishing a length ahead of Purdue and five ahead of Grand Valley. 
The novice crew had a good start off the line immediately establishing the lead ahead of Purdue and Grand Valley. Coxswained by Rose Gill and stroked by Kathy Salvi, the crew con­tinued to lengthen their lead and won the race one and one-half lengths ahead of Purdue and five ahead of Grand Valley. 
********** 
The women's field hockey team finished sixth in the state tournament last weekend with In­diana State University winning the title and Indiana University placing second. 
In Notre Dame's first match, the women lost to third ranked Purdue 3-0. On Saturday morning, Notre Dame's defeated Taylor University 2-1. Left halfback Kathy Kane scored her first goal of the season, firing the ball in on a rebound off the goalie's pads. Co-captain Donna Losurdo scored the second goal on a crowded shot from the goal line. 
In their last game, Notre Dame lost to Marion College 3-1. Late in the first half, left inner Mary Anne Dooley scored on an unassited rebound off the goalie's pads.
