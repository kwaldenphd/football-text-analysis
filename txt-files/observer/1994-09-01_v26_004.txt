This fall for the first time, all Saint Mary's students must carry their student identifica­tion cards with them at all times, that is if they want to enter several of the buildings on campus. 
During the summer, Saint Mary's has installed a universal card access system on several commonly used buildings and entrances to the underground tunnels on campus. 
Specifically, all students will have access to the west door of McCandless, the north door of Holy Cross, and the ramp door of Moreau Hall between the hours of 8 p.m. and 5 p.m. ev­eryday. The Student Affairs door will be accessible during these hours Monday through Friday. The tunnels and stair­wells to LeMans Hall will be ac­cessible 24 hours a day every­day as will the Holy Cross, Regina, and Cushwa-Leighton Library tunnels. Students will have access to the tunnel lead­ing to Haggar College Center everyday from 7 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. 
Other members of the Saint Mary's community, such as employees and faculty, will also have restricted card access to these doors, according to direc­tor of security, Dick Chlebek. 

"Their cards are valid at cer­tain times and certain locations, such as when they are physi­cally at work during normal business hours," said Chlebek. 
A similar system has been used in previous years in the stairwells of LeMans Hall and the outside doors of McCandless Hall. 
In the past, only residents of LeMans Hall had access to the LeMans stairwells and elevators and McCandless residents had card access to their residence hall at night. Now all students will be have access to all of the buildings with the card access system installed regardless of which hall they live in, accord­ing to Chlebek. 
"It is universal because to benefit from a campus social life students must interact with other students," said Chlebek. "This universal system allows for this interaction if the stu­dents so choose." 
This system was installed to improve personal safety on campus, according to Chlebek. 
"We wanted to increase secu­rity before something happens,'' he said. 
According to Shea Powel. McCandless residence hall di­rector, everyone has been sup­portive of the system so far. 
"We have not had much of a problem of people forgetting their I.D.'s so far and the peo­ple that question the card ac­cess system are in favor of it when they find out it is de­signed for better security," she commented. 
Sophomore McCandless resi­dent Kim Melvin says she sup­ports the card access system even if she has to think a few steps ahead of the front door to pull out her I.D. card. 
Saint Mary's is not the only college with this card access system. According to Chlebek, the University of Maryland, University of Southern California as well as Notre Dame.

Can there be anything worse? 
When I felt those old familiar South Bend scratchy throat symptoms at the sound of my alarm clock yesterday morning, I ·ust knew that it was going to be one of those cough drop and kleenex kind of days. 


After realizing that By ELIZABETH these items hadn't even REGAN been on my Venture list Saint Mary's Editor last week-afterall, winter is supposed to be months away-1 hit the snooze button on my alarm clock praying that my nose would stop running in nine more min­utes. 
Beep ... Beep ... Beep ... drip...drip...drip... No such luck. 
There is nothing worse than being sick away from home. Without the convenience of a stocked medecine cabinet, a comfortable bed, and my mom to bring me an endless supply o hot tea and chicken noodle soup, my symptoms generally seem even worse than they actually are. 
After clamoring out of my top bunk and reaching for my favorite sweatshirt, in order to ward off the draft in the room, I knew I was going to have to fend for myself. 
While plugging in my hot pot, I remembered that my handy "Female Pack," distributed at the beginning of each year, came equipt with some Luden's cherry cough drops. Although they are not the best for ridding a sore throat, I was desperate enough to believe that they would be the answer to my prayers-anything to avoid the infrrmary. 
The last thing in the world that I wanted to do was trudge down to the inrrrmary and be poked, prodded, and gagged by anyone but my favorite pediatrition from home. · 
In order to prolong the inevitable, I decided to call home and get some much needed sympathy from my mom, who unfortunately ordered me to go directly to the infirmary. "Do not pass go." 
The dread was overwhelming as I slipped into my cozy pink slippers and headed for the eleva­tor. I was already sick enough and wasn't look­ing forward to being exposed to all of the other germs roaming around the infrrmary. 
The very thought of moaning, coughing, and hacking all around me was enough to make me cringe. To my delight, I was one of the first sick people around this year, and the gross, but defi­nitely clean anticeptic smell dispelled my fear o foreign anti-bodies. 
After rilling about a million forms and becom­ing reacquainted with the nursing staff at Saint Mary's, who I might add, can be almost as com­forting as my mom-when I'm really desperate, it was time for the infamous strep test. 
After giving me a quick gag of the throat, a bottle of Sudafed, and some salt for gargaling, they sent me on my way with a promise of the results as soon as possible. 
Although it wasn't something that I cared to do for fun, it wasn't nearly as bad as I had remembered. It was just a matter of suffering through the rest of the day. 
The chunky dining hall soup would never be as good as Campbell's, my roommate's half­hearted sympathy just isn't quite as nice as my doting little sister's, and boiling my own water for tea isn't the same, but I guess there comes a point when mom just can't be there anymore.

U.S. prepares for showdown with the Vatican 
By RITA BEAMISH 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

The Clinton administration is girding for a showdown with the Vatican over abortion while struggling to keep the spotlight on global population and devel­opment at an upcoming United Nations conference. 
Adding to the complications was growing opposition from conservative Muslims who see the conference as a threat by affluent Western societies to their cultural beliefs. 
The administration has played a lead role in shaping the International Conference on Population and Development set to begin Monday in Cairo. Vice President Al Gore will led a 45-member delegation repre­senting the United States.

and some 1,200 non-govern­mental groups sending dele­gates agree on many aspects of an aggressive voluntary blue­print for curbing population growth in both poor and rich countries. 
Despite what they regard as remarkable accord on goals like improving women's status and integrating population and development strategies, U.S. officials anticipate a heated fight over still-to-be-decided sections on abortion as a repro­ductive health option. 
However, Undersecretary of State Tim Wirth said Wednes­day that compromise language appears likely on another con­tentious front -providing fam­ily planning information and care to adolescents. 
"Our position is that every­thing should be done to avoid abortion," said Wirth, the ad­ministration's point man on population issues. 
The United States, nonethe­less, will continue to insist that "if a pregnancy gets into trou­ble, a woman ought to have ac­cess to the full range of repro­ductive health care services," including abortion, Wirth said. 
"They will object to that," Wirth he said of the Vatican. 
Vatican delegate Bishop James McHugh, the bishop of Camden, N.J., said he hopes for language clarification or omis­sion that will allow the church to support the document.

But, McHugh added, "We don't have a way in which we can accept a little bit of abor­tion." 
The United States has sought to shift attention away from the controversy as political analysts eye the potential of the large Catholic swing vote for the 1996 presidential election. 
"This is not a conference about abortion. This is a con­ference about the urgency of population stabilization and economic development," Wirth said."Unless we stabilize the global population, almost every hope for economic develop­ment, political stability and maintenance of the integrity of the ecosystems will be severely threatened."

Mayors push for quick implementation of bill 
By SONYA ROSS 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
Mayors urged President Clin­ton on Wednesday to swiftly implement the newly passed $30 billion anti-crime bill so they can begin hiring police of­ficers in hopes of cutting urban crime before 1996. 
The U.S. Conference of May­ors put together a three-mem­ber task force to prod Congress and the Clinton administration along as they appropriate money for cities to use in anti­crime efforts. It comprises Denver Mayor Wellington Webb, Louisville Mayor Jerry Abramson and Paul Helmke, mayor of Fort Wayne, Ind. 
Knoxville, Tenn., Mayor Vic­tor Ashe, president of the con­ference, said unless money is made available quickly, cities won't be able to adequately re­cruit and train new officers in order to put them on patrol next year. Most cities, he said, have an average training pe­riod of six to eight months. 
"Under the best of circum­stances, it's going to be a year. We sure don't want it to take a year and a half," Ashe said. 
Clinton is expected to sign the measure sometime after Labor Day. 
Ashe said the mayors hope Clinton will treat their need for crime-fighting help as he would treat federal aid to areas strick­en by disaster.

NEW YORK 

A man armed with an assault rifle drove to a busy tourist hub in Rockefeller Center just as workers were going home

"He got back to his car so cool, calm and collected, and started backing up as if nothing had happened," said Bob Crofts, who was at Rockefeller Center for a meeting with a col­league, Dan Brennan. 
Two police officers nearby ran over and "within two sec­onds, they were on top of him

horrible, horrible life," Murphy said. 
The sixth-grader has a thick me in the juvenile court system, where over nine years, he has been both victim and accused, Murphy said. 
According to Murphy's records, the boy was removed from his mother's home after investigators found cigarette burns on his neck, back and buttocks, scratches on his face and abdomen, and cord marks on his legs. 
He and his brother were 
placed in the custody of his grandmother, who Murphy said provided no discipline. 
"She let them do whatever they wanted," Murphy said. "He and his brother both engaged in pretty outrageous criminal activity.'' 
The grandmother has an unlisted phone number and could not be reached for com­ment Wednesday. 
In the past two years, the boy was prosecuted at least eight times for felonies including rob­bery, car theft, arson and bur­glary.

•I, FARRINGTON 
Sage advice for college life 
I have often been asked, as one "in the know" at Notre Dame, what young men and women arriving at Notre Dame for their first year should ex­pect. Often, the most dreadful fears turn out to be needless fancies, while at the same time, some of the gayest hopes are doomed to be extinguished in a sea of blackness and suffering. Tempus fugit! I may be just an impractical old cleric, but I have seen enough brown autumns pass beneath the shadow of our golden dome to give a few hints. 
•The 
University makes quite a squawk about its rules and regulations, but have no doubt, it's all for show. With an affec­tionate wink of its motherly eye, Notre Dame actually expects its students to break a few rules here and there; if they didn't they wouldn't have the sort of spirit that made us America's foremost Catholic University, would they? Likewise with the University Honor Code -a snitch is a snitch here too, make no mis­take, and the evangelists "bor­rowed" a little now and then. See for yourself! 

•One 
of the grandest fixtures on the Notre Dame campus is our beloved Father Hesburgh, for whom the library is named and who occupies a spacious office on the thirteenth floor. If you happen to run across this august and gregarious man, make sure to call him by his nickname, "Fats." There is nothing he so loves as being addressed this way from a dis­tance by the latest bearer of the Notre Dame torch. 

•Another 
ND luminary fa­mous for his accessibility is Coach Holtz. Either of his nick-

names -"four eyes" or "old bitch and moan" -will earn you the easygoing affection so famous in ND gridiron lore. Nota bene: try a few choice jests about "Under the Tarnished Dome" or last year's season (and championship hope) ending loss to puny 
Josh Ozersky 


Boston College. Coach Holtz is famous for "rolling with the punches" and likes nothing bet­ter than a barbed exchange with a new student. 
•Notre Dame football is fa­mous across the land, of course. but few away from South Bend know its mirthful, prankish side, For generations, running backs or linemen who have fumbled a ball or missed a tackle have had to endure "blobbying" from first year stu­dents-that is, having their ex­pansive behinds whacked with a rolled-up magazine while the student yells "Nice game! Blobby Blobby!" and prepares for a second stroke. In the days of Frank Leahy and Ara Parseghian, this tradition was done with a rattan cane similar to those used in Singapore, but times have changed. Make sure to exercise this custom on the huskiest, most intimidating player you can find; as often as not, they are the best-humored. Also, at home games alcohol is prohibited in the stadium, but you can be sure a hip flask of Irish whiskey, proffered to the ticket agent in exchange for a good place in line, will find a warm welcome. 
•Notre 
Dame's professoriate, too, likes a bit of sport and de­pends on the incoming fresh­man to supply it. Eminent in­structors like Alistair Mcintyre of the Philosophy department or Charles Rice of the Law School often count as a loss a week in which they are not the target of a well-placed water balloon or a joy-buzzer hand­shake. Only freshmen are al­lowed to address these men by their first names, however, so take advantage of the privilege while it lasts. 

•
Lastly, although the University's drug and alcohol policy is a strict one, Notre Dame tends to look the other way on special occasions. On days after a big win in football, the smell of a thickly-rolled "blunt" wafting through the air is synonymous with gridiron success. And, although this may be considered somewhat more daring, the addition of such "designer hallucinogens" as MDMV or ecstasy into the punchbowl at a University­sponsored dance is sure to make your name in the dL rm. 


The experience of learning and living in a Catholic envi­ronment as seeped with tradi­tion as Notre Dame's is a unique one, and it is my deep­est wish that you enjoy it and exploit it to the fullest. I hope these tips will help you to a holier, more fulfilling, freshman year and I encourage all stu­dents to refrain from contacting me if they do not. My prayers are with you.

Americans must accept 
CubanPredi~ent 
Dear Editor. .. .I am a first generati()n. Cuban-American. MBA student here in Notre Dame and feel it is my obligation to come to the defense o the Cuban people who are seeking exile here in our great country and to explain why we must tighten the embargo on Castro's 
Cuba. ·... · l don't know about the rest of the readers of this page, but I cannot put a price on democracy and human rights. Over any fis~ cal or economic rationalizations, we must recognize that the cause of a free and democratic Cuba is more important. Too many are the times I have come across statements which trivialize the reasons for· which balseros risk their lives to seek freedom here in thls country. ·It must· be. made clear· that these people are not immigrants looking for the good life. but that these are in· dividuals risking their lives for freedom. Once in Miami, the support networks set up for their estab­lishment into the working _class of this country is incredible. I know, because we welcomed three ~alseros into my in-laws home for over six months, until they each had jobs and enough money to gel their own apartment and car. Surprisingly state and federal government forgets that the arrival of Cubans, over the years. is what has transformed Miami into the thriving interna­tional center it is today. On the other side <>fthe florida §traits, the problem is far greater. The embargo on Cuba must be tightened to purge Castro from his dictatorial wrath, and no more money should be allowed to flow into the country, The primary reason we must· tighten the embargo now is that nev~r has it been as effective as it is today. The most si~ficant blowpfthe embar~o began to hit ~uba short• ly after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the decrease in subsi­dies from Eastern bloc countries. The Castro regime is finally struggling to remain in control. What I amasking from all ofyou is to recognize the plight of the Cuban people, trapped itt and outside of their motherland. I want you all to see tbat the embargo has bee1l placed on the Cuban people by Fidt:d as he has continually raped them of their dignity. Understand and share with me the want for the Cuban govern­ment to recognize basic human rights and democratic freedoms. Castro will not do these things if he can help it, beca~se he knows that it will meanthe end of his regime; .Castro cannot be a solution to the problem, because he is the problem. Let's hope that Clinton understands that without the embargo the United States' leverage to promote positive change will dissipate overnight. Everyone has witnessed the success o world wide.slll)ctions as Mandella take~ South Africa Into the 21st century. TheJntetr~.ation~lpressure b.nposed by a tighter embargo on Cuba will otfer ·the best chan:ce to give the Cuban people the freedom that we so richly deserve. · FRANCISCO CANTERO, JR. Graduate S~udent in Bruines~

The Band of the Fighting Irish 
By THERESA ALEMAN 
Accent Writer 
Her loyal sons (and daugh­ters) will soon be marching onward to victory once again. The Fighting Irish Marching Band is keyed up and ready for the 1994 football season. Under the direction of Dr. Luther Snavely, the band has a "blow-out" season planned. 
After rigorous tests of musical and athletic skill, the band has been narrowed to 307 march­ing members. A record group of 240 freshmen auditioned for the band starting last Thursday morning. 
This was about twice the number of last year's audition­ing freshmen according to Fred Dini, a senior clarinet player 
t

·,.. '.. 
and the band's parliamentari­an. Dini attributes the large group in part to the movie "Rudy" which popularized the Notre Dame football team, band and Fighting Irish spirit. 
During audition week, band hopefuls and leaders practiced an average of eight hours per day, marching and playing... and marching some more. "We practiced three to four times a day during camp. It's defmitely a lot of work and it does take up a lot of time, but it's worth it," Dini said. 
Practicing at least two hours a day, every day for the entire season, makes for a pretty tight-knit group of friends according to Jennifer Radwan, a junior clarinet player. "We're all very excited about this year. 
We have quite a few very enthusiastic members and we have a lot of good things planned," Radwan said. 
Drum major Sean Kenney anticipates another spirit-rich season, ''I'm personally excited as the student leader of the band, and I think as a group, we're ready for a great time. I just hope the students enjoy our performances as much as we enjoy performing." 
"We'll have a different show every week. Hopefully we'll have more dance routines, they seemed to be well-appreciated last year. Notre Dame seems to be heading for a National Championship year and the band will be too!" said Jill Albanese, a junior clarinet player and the band's secre­tary.

The Notre Dame Marching Band prepares for the Northwestern game in Chicago on September 3 
In the Spotlight... 
By BEVIN KOVALIK 
Assista.nt Accent Editor 
The Irish fans roar in the sta­dium. The tunnel begins to shake and to echo. The players run out onto the field. The cheers are ht.1ard across the world. And the marching band plays on and on. 
"At this moment I know what the band is really all about," said junior Karen Putt, a picco­lo player in the Notre Dame Marching Band. 
"It's amazing," she said. "I get a rush and chills still run through my body each time." 
A Granger native, Putt has been acquainted with this Irish tradition for a long time. Her older brother Chris Putt was a member of band until he grad­uated last year, and he helped nurture her interest and involvement. 
"This experience has been really different in comparison with my high school band," she said. 
"The first time I ran through the tunnel, my old high school band memories started to slightly fade away-it was just so incredible." 
In addition to her dedication to the Notre Dame Marching Band, Putt has also participated in the Varsity Band and the Concert Band since her sopho­more year. 
In the Varsity Band Putt plays during the Notre Dame Basketball games and the Concert Band plays each Spring at the Commencement ceremo­ny and Baccalaureate Mass, and the band tours around the United States during spring break to display its talent at dif­ferent churches and high schools. 
Putt and all the other band members have been practicing night and day since August 24. Although Putt didn't need to try out, since she is already an established band member, the band camp gave her a "refresh­er" course in marching and all the old tricks. 
"As an older member of the band, I now get to help the freshmen learn the ropes dur­ing tryouts and in preparation for the fall season," Putt said. 
"Once you're in the band, you make friends instantly," Putt added. "We are a really close knit group and everyone works well together." 
"It's great just to be a part of the action," Putt said. "From the stadium last fall at the Florida State game, I could see crowds of Irish fans stretching out all the way to South Quad. It was phenomenal!" 
Putt's pride and dedication to the band makes her an impor­tant part of the big band pic­ture. 
On game days, excited Irish fans will spot our band uni­forms and demand when we will play on the steps of the Administration Building, Putt said. 
"We are the oldest university marching Band, and it makes our efforts seem worthwhile when we know that people do come from all over to hear us play." 
Putt has her piccolo all warmed up as she looks for­ward to another rewarding sea­son. 
And her fingers remain crossed in hopes that she will be able to play in the national championships this time.

I had just polished off a crumbcake doughnut and a steamin' cup of Joe when the phone rang. A woman's vmce 
spoke, "Is this Nick Canon, Print Detective?" I answered in the affirmative. 
She told me she had a lot on her mind and even more on her desktop. A phone, a computer, a key­board, a monitor, a mouse pad, a scanner, and a personal printer that in her words, "was as big and slow as a dinosaur."

Yep. She was happy all right. Come to think of it, so was I. As we parted I wrote down a number she could call if she had more questions, 1-800-848-4123. And then, I looked in her big beautiful eyes and told her what I tell everyone, "Before you buy a printer, investigate."

Women's volleyball to use experience, new talent to dominate 
By DOMINIC AMOROSA Sports Writer 
After an exhilarating ride through the NCAA tournament last season, the Irish found themselves in the Midwest re­gional final against powerhouse Penn State. The Irish fell to the Nittany Lions in three games, but the groundwork was estab­lished for a return trip to the nation's elite. 
"We're better at this point of the season than last year," said head coach Debbie Brown. "It's a similar team, but we're look­ing to improve." 
The Irish return seven letter winners from last year's squad and boast one of the finest freshman crops in the country. Senior co-captains Nicole Coates and Christy Peters (see story) will anchor the young team from the outset. 
"Last year showed us what we're capable of doing," said Peters.

CAMPUS MINISTRY ••• 
A STORY OF FAITHFULNESS, OF BLOOD,
AND OF NEW BEGINNINGS 
By now, we have greeted everyone with the famous words "How was your summer?" and 
have told everyone how ours was in response to the same question. 
We are delighted, even exhilarated, to be back on campus and to be with our friends again. We are happy to be back on what has now become "our turf." 
As we begin a new academic year under the Dome, each of us is filled with many thoughts, and with many hopes for what we want this year to be for us. 
One of the grace-filled realities ofour faith is that the blood of martyrs never drips. It flows. And from it, new strength always enables a rejuvenated and revitalized Church to become 
stronger and to grow. 
Sometime durin_g the night of May 8-9, 1994, while many at Notre Dame were still grappling with final exams, five young Rwandan Holy Cross Brothers, men in their twenties, were murdered. They were still in their preparatory years of training before they would become zealous Holy Cross religious serving their people in Africa. 
Their blood flowed. The history ofour faith tells us that from their blood, Christian roots in their country, which in recent years were not sufficient to overcome historical tribal animosity, will strengthen the Euth and hope they shared with us. 
Holy Cross has five new martyrs. 
May Brothers Eulade Gasasira, C.S.C., Leonard Karemangino, C.S.C., Venant Kayitana, 
C.S.C., Jean-Baptiste Mundeli, C.S.C. and Janvier Murenzi, C.S.C. rest in peace. 
~rom .their blood, their lives and their witr?-ess, may the Church become more deeply rooted 
m Afnca and may the Gospel ofJesus Chnst become a worthy way of life for many. 
In the midst of these days ofsuffering and loss, there was cause for great happiness. 
Eleven other Rwandan Holy Cross Brothers, who were missing since Ma}', finally made their way safely to Uganda, arrivmg there three weeks ago. They are currently living with American, Kenyan and Ugandan Holy~ Cross priests and brothers in Fort Portal. And just ten days ago, the first Tursi Holy Cross seminarian pronounced final vows and was ordamed a deacon. He was fairly certain none of his family members would be with him for this moment ofcommitment to be lived throughout a lifetime. 
The Rwandan Holy Cross Brothers were not the first martyrs in Africa. A Notre Dame alum, Vince McCauley, C.S.C., was. 
He set foot on African soil for the first time when he was 52, when he was appointed bishop 
of Fort Portal, Uganda. Over the subsequent twenty years, he became a legendary figure in 
East Africa because of his accomplishments, and especially his holiness. 
Twenty-five years earlier, doctors in Washington, D.C. and at the Mayo Clinic had told him that he had less than six months to live. He was young, recently ordained Holr. Cross missioner who had only been able to spend six months in Bangladesh, a land where he was prepared to live and work all the years of his life. 
But instead of preparing for death, the young priest from Omaha traveled to Lourdes, France. At the Grotto of Our Lady there, he did not ask to be cured. He simply promised Mary that he would continue to work every day for the spread of the Gospel for as long as he might live. The Grotto, ofcourse, meant a lot to him, for it was after the Grotto of Lourdes that our own is fashioned. And as a student at Notre Dame, he had visited the Grotto often. 
He lived more than forry-years beyond his six-month expectancy, and in the course of those r.ears, he became a modern saint for Africa. His diocese grew so rapidly that three additional dioceses were cut off from the one where he was originalfy appointed bishop. He resigned as ~iocesan bish~p, so .that his African auxiliary might become one of the first African bishops m post-colonta1 Afnca. 
But, Bishor McCauley didn't retire. Instead, he founded an institute for higher theological studies in Nairobi, Kenya, in order to prepare young African priests for an apostolic life that would include a rigorous rheological and reflective component. He founded the Association 
goals, but there's no added pressure to duplicate last year's performance," commented Brown. "Our preseason has gone well and it should be fun to actually play against other competition." 
The strength of the Irish lies in the two outside hitter posi­tions. Peters, Coates, junior Brett Hensel and sophomores Jenny Birkner and Kristina Ervin, as well as freshman phe­nom Angie Harris will pound the opposition with kills. 
"We will rely most on our out­side hitters," said Brown. "That is the position where we have the most depth." 
Besides Coates and Peters the outside hitters boast some solid credentials. Hensel can play any position on the court and is essential to the serving rota­tion. Birkner and Ervin both made the MCC newcomer team last season and Birkner was also the newcomer of the year. In addition, Harris comes in as one of the most highly touted

freshman in the country. 
"The early part of the season will be important for us to es­tablish some consistency and gain some experience for our younger players," explained Brown. 
In order to use the outside hitters to the maximum, the Irish will rely on junior setter Shannon Tuttle. 
"Shannon has done a great job," said Brown. "She has an advantage of being in the sys­tem for two years and her men­tal preparation is better." 
Middle blockers Jen Briggs and Jen Rouse will support the net for the Irish. Rouse is the tallest Irish player at 6'5. 
The Irish must contend with a tough schedule as well as the lofty expectations placed on the program. After opening tonight against Valpraiso, the Irish will host the Shamrock Invitational this weekend. 
Other national tournaments on the schedule include a trip to the Colorado Coors Tourna­ment in Boulder, as well as the Big Four Invitational in Louisville.

of Member Episcopal Conferences of East Mrica, to bring tog_ether the one hundred mostly African bishops of i:he region to work together for the good oT all their peoples. And, above all, he loved and served the poor ofAfrica. He treated kindly and with generosity thousands of refugees from the Idi Amm regime. And he never failed to see the face of Christ in every person be met and dealt with. 
Bishop Vince McCauley, C. S.C. was one of the founders of the Hoi}' Cross missions in Africa, and he became an inspiration for future generations of Holy Cross men and women. When he died in 1985, everyone who knew him, even a little bit, knew in their heart that a true saint had joined his Lord in heaven, welcomed in a special way, surely, by Mary who knew he had more than kept up his end of the bargain he made forty years earlier. 
When Holy Cross priests entered his simple q_uarters in Nairobi, Kenya, after his death to gather his personal effects, they found only a lew changes ofclothing, two cassocks and a few mconsequential papers. He took the Lord Jesus at his word, and kept only two tunics for his fifty-year sojourn following Christ. 
Oh, yes. The cancer that led to his original six-month prognosis did not go awa}'. He underwent more than for:ry operations to keep it under control, until at last it killed him. Now he serves as a model of foving Gospel service regardless of the cost, for generations of Holy Cross religious in East Africa and elsewhere, ana for thousands ofAfricans. 
As a new academic year begins, you are happy to be here, among and with your friends. 
You are happy to be in a place where you, too, can pursue and deepen your own desire for a more significant and life-giving relationship with Jesus and with our community of believers. 
There will be many opportunities for you to do so, whether in late night sessions with friends, at the Basilica or Grorto, at residence hall Masses, during N.D.E. retreats, or in countless other ways. 
However you want to allow this deepening of your spiritual side to happen, pursue it. 
Pursue it relentlessly. 

That is the way it has always been here. It was that way for Vince McCauley when he was a Notre Dame undergraduate. 
And, please God, it is the way it will be, for you and for generations ofNotre Dame men and women to come.

With one season still left, it would not be surprising to see one of the talented captains of 1994 take over one or more of these categories. 
Both Coates and Peters are very aware of the task that lies ahead of them. As far as their goals for this year, they both believe that they have to ma­ture quickly in order to build on last years success. 
"It is crucial to get into a rhythm and to play together," says Peters. "Considering that our main goal is to beat a lot of ranked teams and to improve last year's ranking."
