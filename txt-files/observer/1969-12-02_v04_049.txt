Losers become winners • 
WASHINGTON (UPI) America's first draft lottery in 27 years yesterday decided by the luck of the draw which of 850,000 young men of military age will be called to service next year. 
"September 14th," was the first birthdate to be called out as youth representatives of the various states drew, one by one, the large blue plastic capsules from a big glass laboratory jar at Selective Service Headquarters. Then in rapid order came April 24, Dec. 30, Feb. 14, and Oct. 18. 
With a third of the 366 birthdate capsules drawn, I 7 represented days in December meaning that those born in December, 1951, would be highly vulnerable to the draft during 1970. 
Under the new lottery system, a registrant's birthday would be the key to the order in which he would be subject to the draft call. Basically, it was first drawn, first called; last drawn, last ­and probably never -called. 
Those affected by the third Io Itcry in three generations 
consisted  of  lA  registrants  
between  their  19th  and  26th  
birthdays.  

The University may press for either a temporary or a per­manent injunction, but it is not known which will be sought by the administration. 
The persons named in the 

court  order,  Brian  Mcinerney,  
Rick  Libowitz,  Tim  MacCarry,  
Fred  Dedrick,  and  Sister  

Joanne Malone, have now acquired a lawyer and will present their case on the day appointed by the court. 
At least three of those named did _not actually participate in the blocking of the office as was chragcd in the court order. However, the restraining order must name specific persons in order to be legally effective. 
The five could not predict just what action will take place in the hearing on December II, but the adion will most probably depend on what kind of in-
Lt. Gen. Lewis B. Hershey, 76 year old outgoing director of the draft, spoke briefly following the opening prayer and the first capsule was drawn by Rep. Alexander Pirnie, R. of New York, a member of the House Military Affairs Committee. 
Members of the Selective Service's Youth Advisory Board were called by name to the side 
of the bowl and one at a time they pulled out a capsule which was opened by a woman from the Selective Service staff. The Defense Department has given this breakdown of its manpower needs for 1970. Of the 850,000 eligible I A registrants, 290,000 are expected to volunteer instead of being drafted, leaving a Selective Service pool of 560,000. The Pentagon believes that an estimated 250,000 of these will be drafted under the new Io ttery. Thus the remaining 310,000 would not have to serve and would be able to plan their lives in the expectation they will see no military interruption. However, should the number of volunteers fall below the prediction, the number needed as draftees would increase. The priority situation under 
junction is sought by the Uni­versity. 
The five demonstrators who were involved in the Dow­CIA protest,and named in a court restraining order, have been granted an extension which postpones their hearing until December II. Several of the protesters appeared in court last Monday, November 24, to enter a plea for an extension of the hearing on the grounds that the five needed more time to arrange legal counsel for the presenta­tion of their case. 
The hearing is to be held to decide whet her or not the res­training order should be declared either a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting such demonstrations. The five must the birthday lottery may vary from locality to locality. Local draft boards will continue to be assigned draft quotas to be filled. 
present  reasons  why  such  an  
injunction  should  not  be  
brought against the protest.  

Therefore it is possible that a local board may use up all of the calls under a certain birthdate and another may use only part of those born on the same date. 
To deal with this, the drawing included the random selection of the 26 letters of the alphabet to establish a priority within a priority. 
Following is the order of the alphabet to be applied to the first letter of last names in determining the order of call for inductees with the same birth dates: 1-J; 2-G; 3-D; 4-X; 5-N; 6-0; 7-Z; 8-T; 9-W; 10-P; 11-Q; 12-Y; 13-U; 14-C; 15-F; 16-1; 17-K; 18-H; 19-S; 20-L; 21-M; 22-A; 23-R; 24-E; 25-B; 26-V. 
Of the 56 youngsters schedule(! to draw capsules, the Selective Service said the representatives of Michigan and Alaska refused to come and take part. 
Before drawing his quota of capsules, Jonathan Crawford, Notre Dame's senior class president, said, "The youth of Indiana are proud to participate," and added that he hoped the random selection system would be the "first of many needed reforms" in the draft. 
Lottery guidelines presented 
WASHINGTON (UPI)-Here ·sa rule of thumb guide for draft !age youths to determine what 
he birthday lottery drawing !means to them: 
You arc involved if your ~irthday falls between Jan. l, 1944 and Dec. 31, 1950. 
If your birthday is drawn in the first 122 numbers and you have no deferment such as college, it is almost certain you will be called for induction in 1970. 
If your birthday is drawn fbetween number 123 through 244 the outlook is touch and go that you'll receiVe your draft board notice. There are varying factors such as the quotas assigned to your local Selective 
Service  board,  deferments,  
whether  your  birthday  comes  
high  or  low  in  this  middle  

grouping. 
ff your birthday is drawn in the bottom third from 245 to 366, there is small likelihood you will be summoned in the draft and you can probably plan your life and career in the knowledge you will have no militarY service requirement barring national emergencies 
If you are temporarily deferred because of college, you exempt status continues but the 
priority level in which your birthday falls in the drawing will be effective for the year your exemption expires. 
Thus if you !should graduate or drop out of college in 1973, if your borthday was the 15th number drawn in the Monday lottery, you would be placed in the 15th level of call ups in 1974 even though a different birthday was drawn 15th that vear. 

'Ten' trial to continue; court option to be decided 
The newly ratified University Court convenes this morning to hear the decision of each individual member of the Notre Dame Ten as to whether he wants to be tried under the University Court or by the old 
tripartite  appeals  board  
contained  in  the  old  Judicial  
Code.  

A directive from the SLC ordered the University Court to extend the option to the defendants which was presented to , them at last Wednesday's preliminary hearing before the University Court. 
The SLC directive was formulated at last Monday's meeting after the SLC had ratified the University Court and the sections of the new Judicial Code pertinent to the hearing of the case of the "Ten." 
The SLC action was prompted by a letter from Father Hesburgh to Professor James Massey, SLC Chairman, stating that Hesburgh had not had time to review the recently passed Judicial Code. 
Hesburgh said that he had no objections to specially approving the sections of the Judicial Code which would effect the hearing of the "Ten." 
The SLC also sent to the University Court an amendment to the proposed Judicial Code saying that the Court will require a "simple majority" of the six members to overturn Father Riehle's orders of suspension and expulsion. 
Father Hesburgh said thai he interpreted the original wording of the new Judicial Code to mean that five of the six members of the Court would be necessary to overrule Father Riehle. 
But he felt this was unfair to the party that seeks action hefore this Court and communicated his beliefs with the additional comment that if this section was amended to a simple majority he would favor the change in his letter to the SLC. 
Fred Dedrick, Student Body Vice-President, at the SLC meeting made a motion which would have made it necessary for five of the six Court members to vote for conviction of the "Ten" in order for Father Riehle's actions to be upheld. The motion was voted down. 
Professor Massey made a 
motion incorporating Hesburgh 's 
belief that a simple majority of members should be necessary to uphold Riehle. After being am ended to include the oossibility that a student may 
choose to go before the old 
appellate body, it was passed. 
The University Court at Wednesday's short meeting was unable to dispose of preliminary matters of discussion and failed to hear opening motions from the defense. 
Instead the meeting consisted of introductions of the ten defendants and the six members of the Court, the reading of the SLC directive to the defendants, and a motion for continuance from Gary Mcinerney, Defense counselor for the "Ten."

SLC allocates $5000 for minority scholarship 

by Bill Carter 
At last night's Student Life 
Council meeting the Council 
passed a proposal calling for the 
allocation of $5000, collected 
from disciplinary traffic viola­
tions on campus, for the purpose 
of beginning a "minority schol­
arship fund." The proposal, as 
presented by student represen­
tative Ted Jones, called for the 
money to "partially finance" the 
scholarships with a special 
emphasis on recruitment. 
In making his proposal concer­ning the minority scholarship fund, Jones pointed out that the money collected from the traffic violations had been accumula­ting over the past two years without any indication of how it would be put to use. He an­swered objections from those who claimed a percentage of the Cotton Bowl profits were to be directed to this purpose by sta­ting that money was needed right now to recruit next year's freshman class. 
Jones emphasized the fact that the $5000 would only serve

and D2 parking lots alone 
On November 26, Tom Ste­
vens was incarcerated by the St. 
Joseph's County police for a 
fight he was involved in in 
Alumni Hall. Another student 
was apprehended on November 
24, for the theft of several 
record albums. His case is being 
studied by the university court 
campus judiciary. 
On November 26, Dean Porter of the campus Art Gallery reported the theft of a small, ancient Greek sculpture from the gallery either on the previous Friday evening or Saturday. The object is a bronze sculpture of a miniature horse, dating back to 800 B.C., and its value is estimated to be $1 ,000. The exhibit was arranged in such a way that the sculpture could have been grabbed by a tall person with long arms while the gallery was open to the public. 
On friday, November 28, a huge amount of laundry was disc0vered strewn around the as a beginning for the fund, as capital to work with to handle preliminary planning and details, such as finding people to man the scholarship committee. 

Jones explained the need for a minority scholarship fund at Notre Dame. "Notre Dame needs a far greater diversity in its community. Right now there are only two scholarships I know of which are particularly for minor­ity students, and yet 8 2 of the 83 blacks on campus are cur­rently on some form of financial aid.

tion concerning the ten-cent shuttle bus fare. As finally stated the motion called for nothing more than cohtinued negotiation on the issue between the student government and the Academic Affairs Office. 
The shuttle bus motion, as originally presented by Student Body President Phil McKenna, called for the elimination of the ten cent fare by next year with Notre Dame and St. Mary's shar­ing the additional cost of run­ning the bus after 6 p.m. McKenna presented figures which showed the bus company to be "breaking even or better" on the service charge required at night.

the use of the bus during the day and that the additional cost

He called the fare an unfair tax on students based on an unjust claim that the bus was used only for social purposes after 6 p.m. 
McKenna's motion was amen­ded by Prof. John Houck to call only for further negotiation on the subject and not for elimina­tion of the fare and substitution of University funds to finance the use of the bus. Houck's amended motion passed easily, despite McKenna's objection that the amendment made the motion meaningless.

As a public service, The Observer submits the following program script to the major TV networks in an effort to take the strain off Spiro Agnew. Narrator: Tonight, live from beautiful, downtown Washington (the rest of the city is decaying but that's not our problem) in the heart of the Selective Service National Headquarters. Hershey Candy Company patriotically presents the "Fish Bowl, or You Bet Your Life." Our host for the evening is the guiding light of America's youth, that wonderful and warm humorist, AI Capp. But before we introduce AI, a word from our other first half sponsors Dow Chemical Co. and Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. In an attempt at fairness, the second half will be sponsored by the Hudson Bay Real Estate Company.

Al: Now for the draft of the future. Here it is fun lovers. Bob Hope has just completed casting for his 1984 Vietnam Christmas Tour. So if you don't make it this year, there's still hope. The odds of getting picked get better every year. 
(Chorus of boos from the six-year olds in the audience) 
Al: Alright, alright. On with the show. As you all know, we're here tonight to pick the lucky winners in the America: Love It Or Leave It contest. As a special highlight we have arranged interviews with a draft-eligible youth for each day of the year. So we'll have comments from one of the many thousands of lucky winners immediately after his selection. 
Al: Enough of this levity. On with the monologue. By the way, narrator, why don't you shut the windows or close the door? Narrator: I'll be the straightman and bite, (he said fishingly) why should I close the windows in here? 
Al: Because I'm beginning to feel a draft.

Al: Before we bring you the second selection, a word about next year's bigger and better show. Next year we are going to feature a pre-selection show, "Countdown to Pickoff", as well as a post-selection show, "The Selective Service Today", in which we'll give a "fair" analysis of the draft's first year.

' Kronk and the Ducks' 
It was rather sup pinging really. Students like Tom Kronk and Pat Dowdall, unwilling to sit back and do nothin, got out and started asking questions about why the fieldhous7 couldn't be saved for a campus center for the fine arts. The Art Department, which has been trying to be heard for months, was pleased to join in with a concrete plan (including facts and figures) for saving and renovating the old stucture. 
Tom Kronk and his new University Arts Council began raising the question publicly over and over and support began to gather (even this column attacked the destruction of the fieldhouse back in October). 
Miracle of miracles! There was a rally and people came to it. Art freaks, student senators, drama people, student union bureaucrats, writers from the Observer and the Scholastic, radicals, conservatives and even a plain student or two; all of them concerned about the arts at Notre Dame. 
After a while, Fr. Hesburgh came to. As Joe McCarthy used to say, "It's the most unheard of thing I ever heard of!" 
* * * 
Every now and then a columnist writes what is best described as a "three asterisk" column. These columns are identifiable by frequent breaks denoted by three asterisks (***). A three asterisk column means one of two things; either the columnist is too rushed and busy to sit down and write out a coherent argument that will run seventy lines or else he has a number of small subjects, none of which is worth a whole column, which he wants to cover. Having done the former before, I am pleased to say this is the latter. 
* * * 
Watch your record stands, gang, for a hot disk just out from Big Frenchie's Records! Another smash hit from that song writing team of Bill Locke and Pat Clinton; Agamemnon! A musical comedy remake of the Greek classic by Aeschylus, Agamemnon! is out just in time for the harried Christmas shopper trying to pick out a gift for the man who thinks he has everything. Starring Ruth Fishcher and Pat Clinton with vocal and instrumental support from Tim Barry, Tom Connolly, Steve Tabscott, Denny ("Seg Willy") Williams and Michael Monotone, the entire production is best summed up by the insipid chorus during a refrain of "The Insipid Chorus Waltz." 
"We don't understand what's happening or what our playwright undertakes here. But we know whatever is happening it wouldn't have happened in Shakespeare." 
* * * 
A new cause for those still drunk with their victory over the administration on the fieldhouse issue; the mural in the Huddle. I can find no one who finds the atmosphere of the already gloomy room enhanced by the sight of nightmarish football players undertaking eight or nine different plays simultaneousely. 
I say we should raise some money (preferably out of administration pockets) and commission Andy Warhol to do a study of Father Hesburgh on the wall. 
* * * 
I am told that the University was left a large sum of money (the figure mentioned was $'1 00,000) by a little old lady for the feeding of the ducks in the lakes on campus (the farsighted l.o.l. realized that someday even Father Duck will go the way of the flesh). I am told that the administration refused the money saying, "That sort of thing is for the birds!" Tom Henehan suggested that they take the money and establish duck-feeding scholarships for poor students. The students would have tuition, room and board paid for in exchange for feeding the ducks once a week. 
If Fr. Hesburgh is still looking for a replacement, I'd like to nominate Henehan.

Correction 
Editor: 
May I correct the report on the CIA-Dow events in the Nov. 20 Observer according to which in my remarks made at the protest I "explained that a sub­committee of the SLC will hold 
public hearings on the Placement Bureau, and warned that the news media may escalate the demonstration in an identity clash between students and administration". What I in fact said was that the SLC had formed a joint committee with the Faculty Senate to look into the operation and policies of the Placement Bureau and to report back with their findings and recommendations. I also pro­mised to relay to that committee the suggestion given by Father David Burrell at the protest that the committee hold public hear­ings. I also stated that as SLC chairman I had no authority to reply for the committee. I also announced that the committee members were Prof. Charles Allen (committee chairman), 
Dean Joseph C. Hogan, Mr. Ted Jones, and Prof. Barth Pollak. 
I made no remarks whatever about "news media" or an "identity clash" although I do recall that those remarks were made by some speaker. 
May I take this opportunity to congratulate the Observer on its generally excellent coverage of the protest. 
Sincerely yours,

He wishes to work with the SLC in its investigation of campus security. He feels that most students do not become very concerned until they arc involved personally.

White said that he went to the

p.m. to try to start his roommate's car. !lis roommate had given him the keys to the car, because the vehicle having trouble starting. 
As White approached parking lot, he saw five youths, all about 15 years old, "rumbling around cars." He said two "kids" were in a car, searching through its glove compartment. Two more were "ripping the door off of a coupe." And he said that one was trying to gain entrance to his roommate's car. 
lie yelled at the teenagers to scare them away, but they fled only when he ran towards them. One of the vandals shouted obscenities at White, angering him so that he pursued the high schooler. White caught the youth, and started dragging him away, threatening to turn him over to the authorities. 
Though White had made the threat only to scare the teenager, the vandal's partners in crime evidently took it seriously. One jumped out of the shrubbery, barring White's path, ordering White to release his captive. 
At this, another teenager jumped White from behind, and 
a  rope  was  tossed  on  the  
Senator.  White  says  he  was

It is White's opinion that it IS these youngsters, not Notre Dame students, who are plaguing the vehicles in the parking lots. lie pledges to bring the issue of

The Paulists arrived on the West Side of New York City in 1858. In 1895 they moved into San Francisco's China­town and into the fringes of Chicago's Loop in 1904. They're still there. Times change. Neighborhoods change. Sometimes they go up. Sometimes they go down­but through it all the Paulist stays. As long as th.:re arc people to be served the Paulist will be there. The Paulisl may be in the same old place but he con­stantly docs 11£'11' things. That's one of the ch<lractcristics of the Paulist order: using their own individual talents in new ways to med the needs of a fast-changing world in the col­leges ... in communications ... in the ghettos.

human life and be sure of having all the facts. 
However, there is another, very important, isssue involved in the punishment of these students. One of the outcomes of World War II was the so-called "Nuremburg Principle". This is to the effect that anyone who feels he is participating in or allowing to happen some atrocity, especially the taking of human life, should do all in his power to stop it. 
The early Christian tradition was one of standing up for beliefs even though it led to the Cross of the lions. 
On this campus we have at 
least ten people willing to risk suspension and expulsion to show their opposition to these companies on grounds of conscience. There were at least as many more willing to go to jail under the court injunction to show their witness on Wednesday but the recruiters left campus. 
Whether or not you agree with these people that Dow and CIA must be stopped., I feel that you must realize that they were required by Christian tradition and a principle of world justice to act on their belief. 

Should people be punished for acting as men? Can Notre Dame afford to let this principle be smashed? 
Germany could have used many such men, can Notre Dame afford to lose the few we've got?

'Rule of fear' 

Editor: To Vave Lammers: I read with great interest your editorial, that was in the paper 
on the importance of the other side. But I cannot agree with your terming of Fr. Hesburgh's letter as a "rule of fear." You fail to explain just why we should be afraid of it. It "steps" on no one; it does not infringe on our daily lives here at the du Lac. 
As to whether or not the ten students should remain expelled or suspended is a very thought­provoking question. And I alone cannot answer it. But Fr. l-Ies­burg's letter (or at least some de rivation of it) is necessary in a "Christian" community. To me, it is not a rule of fear, but rather a rule of protection! 
Peace and victory, 
Tom Mignanelli

cashed a field goal attempt and it was 64-63. 
Jones, who seemed to get clutch points all night, tipped-in a Jim Hinga miss as the Irish pulled off eight points in a row. Carr, his touch back, made it 76-69 at 2: IS and a bucket by Jay Ziznewski at I: 30 clinched things. During this rally, O'Connell and Carr scored field goals (besides Jones) and John Plcick dropped in two free throws. In the final minutes, Carr and llinga each cashed two foul shots and Jones got another tip-in. 
Carr played a super game on offense with several fine assists to go along with his 31 points. Jones seconded with 19 m.d O'Connell added 14. Hill (22) and Shannon ( 18) and Mlkan 
( 17) paced Minnesota. 
The ND offense seemed too one-sided with the burden being placed on the shoulders of Carr. The Irish need a healthy Catlett to team with Jones and take some of the pressure off Austin. 


84-75 last night at the losers' Pleick onto the court, but Sid's court. ND sent a starting line-up sore ankle prevented him from of Carr, Mike O'Connell, Collis operating effectively. It was the Jones, Sid Catlett, and John opening game for both squads. 

Apparently suffering no ill 
side effects after devouring a 
sumptuous Thanksgiving feast at 
the South Dining Hall, the Irish 
icers poured in 18 goals past a 
bewildered Ohio University 
defense as Notre Dame swept to 
its second and third straight 
victories over the holidays by 
the scores of 8-5 and I 0-0. A 
few "firsts" were registered as 
the Irish set the Bobcats down 
to their third loss of the season. 
On Friday night, sophomore 
wingman Jim Cordes made his 
seasonal debut a successful one 
as he tallied twice past Bobcat 
goalie Dennis Hayworth. 
Saturday evening, freshman 
center John Noble notcher1 his 
first goals of the season ( thr!!e of 
them, to be exact) and goalie

Jim Crowley (one of the fabled 
"Four Horsemen") turned the 
tri k three times in 1921-'22. 
Both teams played a hard 
contact game on Friday night, as 
typified by the 17 penalties 
dolled out by the officials.

Scoring was see-saw, with OrirJ coming from behind to tie on three different occasions. I I was Cordes, however, who spelled defeat for the Bobcats as his tie-breaking goal at 19:53 of the Freshman John Noble has scored three goals this season, and all sewnd period paved the way for three came in one game-against Ohio on Saturday night. 

Coach Johnny Dec sent his charges out in a 1-3-1 defense and the zone seemed like a good move as Minnesota was unable to hit during most of the entire game and expecially the first half. The Irish also dominated both backboards early in the contest. 
NO's first five points, however, were all free throws, the first two by Jones, and the Gophers took their only lead of the first half and of the game at 4-3. A driving lay-up by captain Carr heralded a six-point Irish spree, making it 9-6 with 16: II left. Junior guard Erick Hill closed the gap to 13-11, but ND then ran away to a 24-13 lead at 9:10. 

Dee substituted liberally through the middle of the first half and at one point (6: 35 ), none of the five starters were in, but this lasted only briefly. With the Gopher front-line shooting gone ice-cold, long range gunner Ollis Shannon and Hill pulled Minnesota to within three, 30-27 at 4:25. Then Jones canned two free throws, Carr hit a corner jump shot, and Mike O'Connell converted a steal from Carr to blow it out to 36-29. 
The half ended 41-30 with N D hitting 48% and Minnesota only 31% from the floor. Carr had 13 points and O'Connell 10. llillled 
the Gophers with I 0. 

The second period boiled down to a struggle bet ween guards. Hall and Shannon (a sophomore) continued their fine shooting and even hit the offensive boards well. Larry Mikan, the Gopher's 6-7 center and leading scorer, shook himself after a poor beginning and began to score. On the other hand, NO's offense consisted mostly in setting-up Carr, who was cold early in the half. 
A quick rally reduced the deficit to six, where it remained until the ten-minute mark. After 
Regan also netted two goals with Captain Phil Wittliff, Kevin Hoene and John Roselli of the "Veteran Line" and defensemen Mark Longar rounding out the rest of the scoring with one goal apiece. Tomasoni turned in a fair game, stopping only 23 of 28 Ohio shots, but a few timely point-blank saves preserved Notre Dame's second win in a row. Few expected the drubbing the Irish handed the Bobcats on Saturday night. But from the opening faceoff the outcome was never in doubt as Coach "Lefty" Smith's ruffians intimidated the Ohioans the entire game. Ohio just couldn't mount a serious offensive thrust as Irish defensemen Bill Green repeatedly broke up the Bobcat passing attack at mid-icc. Noble, whose hat-trick was one of the highlights of the evening, displayed excellent stickwork and deception in garnering his first three goals of the season. Regan moved into the second slot in scoring on the roster behind Wittliff as his second 

two-goal night in a row upped his season point total to 9 (four goals and 5 assists). Netminder Tomasoni rebounded from his fair showing of Friday night to turn aside all of the Bobcats 25 shots-on-goal in registering the first Irish shutout in 4 7 years. 
The Irish should meet their match in the next few weeks as they move on a three week road trip during which they'll be paired with Wisconsin twice and Boston College once in addition to four other games (including a two game tournament at Merrimack College). Last year the Badgers simply destroyed the Irish with their skating: Notre Dame just could not keep up with the torrid pace set by the Badgers over three periods of play. Over their first three games, however, the Irish sextet appears to have gained a much quicker attack over last year's squad. Combined with a defensive unit that is more solid than ever, the Irish are well capable of spelling defeat for both the Badge~ and the top-rated Eagles.
