'Sister act' an option for college women 
Students consider vocations with the Sisters of the Holy Cross 
By NELLIE WILLIAMS News Writer 
On Saturday ev1ming, Notre Dame junior Ileather Phillips will be getting ready for a dance. 
Unlike other young women, however, Phillips wilt bf! wondering what her date thought of this article. 
The studio art major and theology minor enjoys aerobics, drawing and painting water­colors. Sh!' likns playing with kids and loves Hallmark cards. She enjoys writing and piec­ing together puzzles. 
And, one day, slrn may he a nun. 
"It's kind of a. sensitive thing," she said. "I've been thinking about the sisterhood since I was 15. I would always joke around with my panmts about it." 
Phillips is one of only a few women study­ing with the Sisters of the Holy Cross in order to bP. a nun. 
/\cross the country, the number of women joining convenL'i has been decreasing. 
Sister Margaret Andre and Sister Margaret Mary Lavon is, both in charge of the Vocation Ministry for Holy Cross Sisters, belir.ve that the opportunities available to women today that did not exist 50 years ago have caused a decrease in women joining the sisterhood. 
"When I was graduating from college, women were like ser,ond class citizens," said Lavonis. "Tlrn only women administrators of schools and hospitals were sisters." 
In the 1950s and 1%Os, about 50 forma­tion classes for joining the Holy Cross Sister's Community were offered each year. Today in the U.S., there is one a year. 
"A lot of people find it hard to make a per­manent decision," said Lavonis. · The Holy Cross community is international and has many sisters serving in eight foreign countries, which helps bolster numbers. 
"Some communities are not international like we are and are dying out,"said Lavonis. 
The number of nuns teaching at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's has not decreased. Often, nuns do not wear traditional habits, which makes them less identifiable. 
Although sisters are not very visible, the priests at Notre Dame are a part of everyday life and Old College is well-known on cam­pus. 
Andre attributes the high percentage of young men studying to be priests at Notre Dame to the visibility and daily interactions with priests around campus. 
"I think it's because Notre Dame priests always talk about vocations and religious life. The visibility helps the students think," she said. 
However, some students are aware of the nuns' presence on campus. 
Phillips began talking to Lavonis last May and suggested the Holy Cross sisters start a vocation faith sharing group. 
Phillips had been attending a vocation group with men in Old College and Father Bill Wack. However, being the only woman in the group "felt strange," to Phillips. 
Now, Phillips attends the vocation faith sharing group she helped create with the Sisters of the Holy Cross once a month. 
One reason Phillips believe she was drawn to learn more about the Sisters of the Holy Cross is because shc, is at Notre Dame. 
Growing up in Sacramento, Calif.. she attended a single-sex Catholic school. At home she would complain to her dad about the nun's habits. 
"I used to say, 'Oh, dad, I could never be a nun because l hate their shoes,"' Phillips said. 
Although stereotypes about nuns exist, such as they are only teachers or nurses,

INSIDE COLUMN 
Beware of the swans 

The last few years of student government has seen an incredible variety o!' leaders. We have had a Student Body King crowned 011 the steps of the Main Building and declare that everyone bow to him in greeting. We have had candidates win under 
slogans such as "Bring the [Grateful) Dead to campus," and serious competition from "Kill the swuns1" We've seen inept and unethical presidents blasted in nation­al news wires as they faced ethics hearings and petitions

{and this is truly scan­dalous!) the successful implementation of a senate Assistant made up of democratically Viewpoint elected repn~sentatives to Editor serve the students' interest. 
At the same time as this radical form of govcrnmrnt was implemented. the duties of all student government officers ·were rcdetined. The rule ol' student policy mak­ers /who wresLle with administrators, represent the students and allocate our money) and stu­dent programmers (who coordinatP concerts. An Tosta! and otl1er entmtainment eventsl was divided. The Senate is invested with the responsi­bilities of leadership. and Executive Cabinet groups (CCC. HPC. SUB and class of1irers) take care of the run stuff. 
Despite this plethora of politicians. with a dear separation of powers, there is a perennial con­cern among some votns that student govern­ment is a clique that serves only ils own interests and that the solution is to send in a l'ew "out­siders" to break it up. 
Unfortunately. the result of this effort bas con­sistently been the election of"outsiders" who just bring in their own diques. Then it seems we've been duped back to square one. 
Just consider what happened a r,ouple years a go when junior dass officer Matt Griffin was elected student body president over senator Matt Szabo. No fewer than 1 g ethical viol.1tions. a recall petition and a $25,000 debt left from turn­ing the President's Ofiice into a private party marked that year. 
The true solution seems obvious: Elect a ticket that's had enough experience as representative leaders. They should also know both how to get things done and how to bring in people from all over campus to work with. Striking examples or ideal presidential candidates have popped up in recent years: former vicr.-president Megan Murrav, '98. former chief of staff and reformer Brend~n Kelly, '98, and two-time senator and chief of staff Matt Mamak. '00. 
Unfortunately, none or these ideal presidents even ran for the office. 
What qualities did these people bave that made them so ideal? All of them served on the Senate and either in the Office of the President or the Executive Cabinet. All of them had experience on the Campus Life Council. They all knew how to deal with the administration, and though diplo­matic, all were rarely seen as conciliatory when it came to defending the students' issues. They were true enough politicians that they wouldn't turn student government into a private clique. 
So, if students take the lessons of the past with them this year, we won't have to worry about it next year, and we can actually see student gov­ernment accomplish all the things of our wildest dreams. Well. that. or at least keep out of trou­ble.

SMC students circulate petition 

 Students say elections were 
'handled unfairly' 
Bv COLLEEN McCARTHY Associate New, Editor 
Although the student govern­ment assodation constitution at Saint Mary's does not have pro­vision for students who are dis­pleased with election results, thri>e Saint Marv's students haVP taken matters· into their own hands. 
Juniors Tara Cuµelli, Kalil' Quinn and Meghan McCormick came up with a plan to help stu­dent voices be heard on camµus regarding the election situation after attending a question and answer session with the Hoard of Governance on Tuesday. 
Cupelli, Quinn and McCormick brgan circulating the pr,tition on Weduesday and collected 332 signatures by Thursday, repre­senting 25.4 percent uf tlrn stu­dent body. 
"After the meeting. I was not happy," said Cupolli. "l wrote a letter to [College president] Dr. [Marilou} Eldred and decided we needed to start a petition." 
The petition states that the election for president and vi~:e president was "handled unfairlv by the Board of Governance, Elections Committee, Elections Appeals board and the director of Student Activities." It goes on to state that "As students of Saint Mary's College W(~ feel that our votes bave been discounted and our opinion not valued." 
By signing the petition, stu­dents are requesting for a fair and accurate representation of the views of the students, said Cupelli. 
"We went door to door and took the petition to classes but some people found us because they heard we were circulating the petition," said Cupelli. "For the most part, peoples' respons­es wne extremely positive." 
The three women plan to sub­mit the petition to the board of governance along with a letter that thev will also send to Eldred, Linda Timm and direc­
tor of student activities Georgeanna Rosenbush. 
"Our point is that by circulat­ing this peliliou, we are not attacking any of the candidates," sairl Quinn. "They're all quali­fierl to hold tlie positions, but it is not fair that Board of Governance took determining the decision of the election into their own hands and didn't let the students decide." 
McCormick hopes the petition wil I send a message to the Board of Governance. 
··we realize that Board of Governance's decision might be final, but tve feel the majority of students weren't represented and that's what they said they;-. ., · were doing," said '.VlcCormick. ,~ 
Cupelli hoµes the petition will signal to the Board of Governance that they axe not, representing the majority of the studf'nts who vot0d in last Wednesday's election with their decision. 
"Board of Governance said at the meeting Tuesday that. their decision was final, but we want tlrnm to know that according to this petition. they are not repre­senting the majority of the stu­dents," said Cupelli. "We want to make a point that students are not being listened to." 
Although the three women du not expect that the Board of Governance will change its deci­sion to render Renner and Nagle victorious in the election, they feel an apology from the Board of Governance is in order. 
"At the very least, Board of Governance should admit they made a mistake by taking the election decision out of the hands of the students," said Cupelli. "I clearly think that with 33 2 signatures of the student body, it is obvious that the stu­dent body thinks they were wrong." 
Quinn agreed. 

"I don't know that Board of Governance will change any­thing alter the way they reacted at the meeting Tuesday saying their decision was final, but if so much of the student bodv wants thP decision changed, h·ow can this one board sav no'?" said Quinn. ·

Phillips said she has leanrnd otherwise. 
"I thought [nuns] worn won­derful. l\fony touched my life by example," shesaid. 
She does not feel she would be limited in life choices as a Sister. 
"Part nf me f'ep]s .limited at times, but \vhcn I step back and look at it, it's such a liber­ating life choice -there's still so much freedom there," Phillips said. 
Contrary to the sisterhood, Phillips still considers mar­riage an option. 
"f think marriage is still such a beautiful option. Sometimes I think I would really miss out not haYing a family of my own or kids. Hut then I think, what if~ '4!,8.S working in an orphan­age for kids caring that way?" she said. 
Sh0 also questions whether she will be lonely. 
"What if ['m truly alone? 'vVhat if you want someone to hold you -something like that'?" 
For now, Phillips will just keep praying about her choice, 
Iler family, Phillips sairl, is very supporliYe of her search­ing. Her mother once consid­ered becoming a nun and lrnr grandfather thought about the priesthood. 
"It's something in our family. It's a ·way we see the best pos­sible way to answer to God's call in complete service," Phillips said. Before joining, at least six months of discern­ment, pre-candidate (no set length), candidate (one to two years). noviate (two years), temporary incorporation (usu­ally five years), and then the final vows arc required steps. 
Phillips is currently in the stage or discernment. She is exploring her options and learning more about the reli­gious life.

To help young women in deciding whe1her or not they want to commit to the sister'­hood, the Sistnrs of the Holy Cross have created a pince to help women pomlcr tlw com­mitment. 
They have created a house, the Discernmeiit Jlouse, also called the lipper Room. The house was created to provide a community and reflective environment while discerning whether God is calling them to religious life as sisters. The first young woman to live in this environment arrived in early January and is living in the Upper Boom with four other nuns. 
Not onlv is th.is Colorado­native Kathleen Hick's first time living in the Midwest, it is also her first time living with a community of Sisters. She admits it is challenging. 
"It's a r0al challenging jour­ney to be on. Being in my 20s, I'm the only one here my age and I am loosfolv connected to the community,'~ said Hicks. 
She believes it takes much courage for people tu explore lhis commilmenl when they fool they have received a cal! to the religious order. 
"This isn't a call tu be a nun," she said. '·This is a call about being a full person. It's not about becoming a nun ­it's about becoming myself in the greatest way I can." 
Hick does not foci there is a secure delinition of what reli­gious life is about. "It's a mys­tery," she said. "There are these old stereotypes that becoming a nun is like giving your life away. We're kind of afraid of this old tradition of nuns our mothers grew up with." 
She said shn thinks the nuns are also intimidated by the younger generation. 

"They may be intimidated by the lack or structure our gen­eration has. The world is a dif­ferent place than it was 20 to 30 years ago, and the Sisters are trying to redefine their life with the time going on." 
llicks, like Phillips, has doubts about her call to reli­gious life. 
However, she foels drawn to having a community life. 
"I realize where I am is where I want to be," said Hicks. 
llicks can live in the Upper Room for up to two years. 
"As long as I feel it's where I want to he, I'll stay." she said. "I can move un if I discover it isn't." Lavouis and Andre believe that young wonrnn need to know the option to he a nun exists. 
"The kPy is desire," said Andn~. "When you keep get­ting the same thought over and over again-it's a signal that God is trying to tell you something."

Meanwhile, the United States arranged a Friday meeting of the international monitoring group that has tried to enforce rules of engagement in the conflict since 1996. The monitors comprise representatives of Israel. Lebanon, Svria, France and the U~ited States. 
U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the agreement to meet was an "important develop­ment" that could help ease tension. 
Recent fighting has killed six Israeli soldiers and two allied Lebanese militiamen and wounded 15 Lebanese civilians. It has also seri­ously eroded the chance of resuming the Israeli-Syrian peace talks, which were suspended indefinitely last month. 
Israel demands that Syria, the main power bro­ker in Lebanon, rein in the Hezbollah guerrillas if it is serious about negotiating peace.

Shavings indicate wear on a nut that travels along the screw. 
The horizontal stabilizHr, the jackscrew, nut. eleva­tors and other components that adjust the plane's up­and-down pitch have been the focus of the Flight 261 investigation. The pilots reported trouble with the able," Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said Thursday.

A 2-foot section of the jackscrew was recovered from the wreckage, and metal shavings found on it were determined to have come from the nut in the mechanism. It is unclear whether the damage was a possible cause or an effect of the crash, and the nut has not been recovered. 
NTSB investigators also announced the Navy had recovered additional pieces of wreckage from Flight 261.

They offer an essential point of 
view." said Elizabeth Eldon, 
assistant professor of biological 
sciences and mP-mher of the 
University committee on women 
and faculty and students. 
Eldon cited several reason why 

committees would benefit from 
student membership. Because 
students' population turns over 
quickly, this ,vould help deter­
mine if change was actually 
occurring, sh<' said. Also, stu­
dents would gain an understand­

added. 
Ilowever. Eldon caulioned that 

there may be negative effects. 
"In anv committee there has lo 

be a level of trust among mem­
bers and an acceptance of com­
mon ground rules," she said. 
''Faculty and students alike need to know whon a certain dis­cussion is confidential, and need to be able to trust that confiden­tiality will be maintained. Some faculty are uncomfortable dis­cussing sensitive confidential topics when students are present due to this lack of trust." 
Eldon also said that due to stu­dents' busy lives, they may not always be present at committee meetings. 
"Committees work best. though, when all members attend regularly and are pre­pared for each meeting. Good committees do real work on real issues. Students [or faculty] who attend erratically have a· nega­tive impact, since time is wasted

Although the candidates agree would benefit fromstudent mem­borship, some may not and each committee should be viewed sep­arately. 
"We need to look at which committees need student mem­bers," he said. "For example, the first year of studies advisory committee already has student ropresentation and there is not much need for a student to be on the biohazard committee." 
Overall, candidates hope that their election would help increase the student voice on university committees. 

"It has been our experience that committee members truly do care about what students have to say," Micek said. "The only problem is that often times there are no students on these committees. We feel that stu­dents can make a difference and one of the best ways that they can is through creating profes­sional working relationship with other members of the commit­

Most presenters are con­nected with Catholic commu­nity leadership in cities including Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, San Antonio and El Paso, Texas, he said. 
"Students at the University often do not get the opportuni­ty to hear and directly encounter creative leaders who are impacting communi­ties of need throughout the country,'' commented McNeill. 
McNeil! encourages students to attend the events, all free to the general public. "We tried to make it student friendly," he said. 
Students look forward to the experience. 
"We students all know that our large cities involve pover­ty and other challenges. I am interested to see what these presenters have done to address these issues with imagination and hope," said Erica Love, student of urban affairs. · 
The conference will begin 4 
p.m. Sunday with a discussion by Hehir of the Catholic Church in cities. Other high­lights include Elizondo, asso­ciate director of the University's new Institute for Latino Studies, who will speak 8 p.m. Monday about Latino faith-based initiatives. 
"Father Elizondo is a 
dynamic speaker and an 
expert on Latino pastoral con­
c1ffns," McNeill said. "He is 
also the founder of the MACC, 
Mexican American Cultural 
Center, a national center for 
training and leadership devel­
opment for those working in 
Latino communities." 
In addition, Notre Dame stu­
dents Angela Anderson and 
Nikolas Green will speak 
about their experiences in 
faith-based initiatives over the 
past summer. 
"We hope the speakers will 
spark the students' imagina­
tions and desire to visit faith­

O'Donnell also stressed that the Judir.ial Council's punish­ment was handed out against the rules of the constitution. The committee formPd to decide the punishment did not mr~ct the constitution quo­tas. and thus their punish­ment was "null and void," O'Donnt>ll said.

"We made a decision." said Zahm senator Ryan Becker. "Now to go back 24 hours later and hear this again ... we have to support the Judicial Committee and go with our original ruling." 
Candice Marcum, Welsh Family Hall senator argued otherwise. "[Wednesday] night it came down to two decisions -either extreme left or right," she said. "There the situation objectively. "Do what is right," he said. "Last night, tht' decision didn't work out for several reasons. We made a mistake, but that doesn't mean we have to make another mistake tonight.

Hridget Tomes from Cavanaugh disagreed.

"I want to reiterate what Pat I Foy] said: Do what's just. Do what's right," O'Donnell said. "I don't think the Judicial Council made the right decision and the consti­tution was not followed. The punishment should stand at a one day suspension."

House passes Diarriage tax cut 
Associated Press 
WASIIINGTON 

Dispatching an p!fction-year valentine. Hepublicans won llowrn passage Thursday of leg­islation that would rut income laxes $182 billion over 10 yf"ars !'or all 
married la.xpayers. including the 25 mil­lion couples who pay a "marriage penalty" <·omparPd 


with singl<> Clinton pPoplc. 
The vote. timed lo coincide with Valentine's Day next week, was 268-158 to send the bill to the Senate. Although 48 Democrats joined all Republicans in favor, it was short ol' a v,~lo-proof' edge. 
Senaw passagn is far from certain and President Clinton is lhreatt\ning a vow over lh1\ bil­l's (:ost and liming, y(1t llousP c;op lead!'i'S trumpetrd the nrnasu rP as L!w nrst in a series of tax cuts that would return ·a portion of projected budget surpluses to taxpayers and limit tlrn growth of govP.rnnrnnt. 
"We nncd a tax code that doesn'l punish married cou­ples." said House Speaker Dennis llastcrL. 11-Ill. "They need to buy braces for the kids. They nm~d to buy insurance for 
the car and the home. They 
don't need the fpderal govern­
ment picking their pocket.'' 
It was a day for politicians of every stripe to ally themselves with the popular issue. even if they opposed this particular bill. Df"spite his veto warning, Clinton said al a Capitol Hill app!iarancc. ··we know we should do this." Howrwer, he wants marriage penalty tax relief targeted more toward lower-and middle-class tax­pay1:rs. 
"We are united in saying. "Let's do it nmv, "' Clinton told a Democratic rally. 
The "marriage penalty" occurs ber.ause millions of cou­ples who me joint tax returns are forced to pay taxes at high­er rates than they would if they WI\J"n single and filing separate­ly, especially if each spouse earns roughly the same incomr. The penalty strikes must frequently at income lev­rls between $20,000 and $75,000 and costs couples an average of $1,400 a year, according to congressional esti­mates. 


The GOP bill would cut taxes for th use couples as well as millions of others who already get a marriage "bonus," mainly those in which one spouse earns the lion ·s share of family income. It would gradually expand the bottom 15 percent tax bracket to apply to more of a married couple's income, boost the standard deduction in 2001 for marriod filers to twice that of singles and raise the income cap to allow more lower-income couples to claim the earned income tax credit. 
About 50 million married couples filed joint income tax returns in 1997, the most recent year complete statistics are available from the lnternal Revenue Service. 
Democrats complained that half of the bill's total tax cut would go to couples who alreadv receivf> a bonus and would consume a large chunk of the projected budget surplus before plans are laid to ensure the future solvency of Social Security and Mecidare, to pay down the national debt and to guarantee adequate govern­ment spending. 
"The Republicans want to have a political gimmick for Valentine's Day," said Hep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. "If they just want a political issue, they've got it." 
Democrats also said two­thirds of the tax cuts would go to couples earning more than $75,000 a year once it is fully phased in by 2008, and would entangle some of them in the complex alternative minimum 
tax.

Black college students and hundreds of other critics of Gov. Jeb Bush's plan to get rld of affirmative action packfld Capitol hearing rooms Thursday to denounce the effort as an attack on women and minorities. 
Bush did not attend the third and final set of hearings on his "One Florida" propos­al, which would eliminate race and gender as factors in university admissions and the awarding of state contracts. He watched some of the hearings on closed-circuit television in his office.

Bush spokesman Justin Sayfie said after the meeting that Bush still wants quick approval on key parts of the plan. 
"The governor is committed to moving ahead with the One Florida plan," Sayfie said. Delay "would mean African­American high school seniors would lose an opportunity to attend the State University System."

"The athletes that are needed to win football games will be included in that 20 percent whether they have the grades or not," said Brenda Holt. a high school teacher in Quincy. "If the government in this state docs not protect us from the good­old-boy system. then who does?" 
The legislators hearing tes­timony were split into two groups to accommodate the crowd. About 1,200 people attended. and 100 spoke. Each speaker was limited to three minutes. 
"I think the governor has his heart in the right place, but has been misguided in his approach so far," said Kelvin Lawrence, a sophomore at predominantly black Florida A&M University. 
For weeks, leaders in Florida's black community have protested against the plan. In January, 
demanding 
that Bush 
rescind his 

execu live order to put One Florida in place. 
Bush refused, but he agreed to three public hear­ings on the plan. The previ­ous two, in Tampa and Miami, also were dominated by critics. 
Then this week, while 1,000 students protested in the Capitol rotunda, Bush met with four students from Florida A&M and agreed to add a three-year "account­ability measure" to make sure enough minorities are admitted into state universi­ties. 
Brogan said Thursday the plan would increase opportu­nities for minorities and streamline the application process for state business.

"I have always supported common-sense gun control. Al Gore bas not always done that," Bradley said. 
The Gore campaign coun­tered that Bradley was trying to manufacture differences where none exist. 
"Vice President Gore has been a strong advocate for gun safety laws." said Nathan Barankin, a spokesman for California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, co-chair of Gore's California campaign. 
But spokesman Chris Lehane acknowledged that Gore's rer.ord in Congress bears little resemblance to his gun-control stance of today.

Bradley said Gore voted against a 1990 bill to expand a federal ban on assault weapons and only wants to register new handguns while ignoring an estimated 60 million current weapons. 
Bradley said he wants to license and register all hand­guns but Gore has dismissed the plan as too difficult. 
"The essence of leadership is to take on that which is consid­ered too hard to do and make it happen. That's what leaders do as opposed to politicians," Bradley said. 
In addition to national regis­tration of handguns, Bradley's plan calls for banning gun dealers from residential neigh­borhoods, limiting the number of guns a person can buy each year, banning small, cheap "Saturday night specials" and ordering background checks for purchases at gun shows. 

"The unusual instrumentation

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Prisoners deserve the vote 
EVANSTON, !II. 

"Our best teacher is history." said Eugene l'encham, Chicago ci,il rights attorney a.nd judge. 
The roots of apartheid in South Africa can probably be traced to the Dutch invasion, when the Europeans' superior weapons and technology overwhelmed the area's native inhabitants. Manu Bhardwaj 
For the next 300 years, blacks in South Africa slowly won back their inalir.nabln rights from their oppressors. They won 
Daily

back the right to give their children some 
Northwestern

semblance of' an pducation. They won buck the right to buy and drive caws. They won back the right to work in dpcent, upper-level jobs. In fact, by 1494, they had won back all of their rights --except one. 
You can often judge a commodity's value by the extent that those who have it don't want Lo give it to those who don't have it. Six years ago, blacks in South Africa finally won the most important right of alL the right to vote. 
Eugene Pcncham said to a curious audience Monday, "What did South Africa's blacks do finally when they got the right to vote'? Why, they elected an ex-convict who had been in prison for 27 yAars!" 
That's right. They elect(~d N<!lson Mandela. 
Now, stay with me for a minute. 
America contains only 5 percent of the world's population, but houses 25 percent of its prisoners. I can't help but won­der how many prisoners in Lhe United Statfls are like Mandela. That is, how many are unfairly incarcerated? 
Ask yourself this simple question: If 13 men have been released from Illinois' Death How, three of whom were freed based on nnw evidence found by Protess and Northwestern journalism students, is it really unreasonable to assume that thflre are hundreds of Illinois prisoners serving regular jail sentences who also are innocent? 
Yet given the possibility that our justice system is incapable of proving true guilt or innocence, there still are no candi­dates for public office paying attention to the plight of prison­ers who are serving jail timfls for crimes they did not commit. 
Why'? 

Because, just like Mandela, nonfl of our prisoners has the righl to vote. That's right. Despite the fact that the 15th Amendment says "the right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be dflnied or abridged by the United States," we are consistently denying U.S. prisoners the right to vote in all 
U.S. elections. 

I am not arguing that pP-ople who kill and rob other people don't deserve to go to jail. What I am saying is that people in jail deserve to vote, for two reasons: 
1) Innocent people are serving time in jail for crimes they did not commit. The only way politicians will start paying attention to them is if they arc given back the right to vote. 
2) Even though U.S. citizens who kill and rob other p!lople deserve to go to jail, all citizens still deserve the right to vote in America. 
Although giving the vote to innocent people in jail won't diang,~ the justice system overnight, it. will give those inno­cent people a voice and a means to try to change the system.

O'Donoghue/Norton's vision untarnished 
This letter is about the character of our friend Brian O'Donoghue. Many of you know him as "Odie." To others, he is just a figure that appears on the cover of The Observer on Thursdays with a summary of tbe previous night's Student Senate meeting. To those who have had any con­tact with him, there is no doubt that he is one of a kind. He has the uncanny ability to seem like the most insane person you've ever met, but in the next instant, he l:al!J .~ay the perfect thing to lift your spirit in a time of crisis. 
If you ask him what he wants to do with his life, without hesitation, he'll respond, "To save the world." And the crazy thing is that he's seri.­ous. The first time we heard this we almost laughed, but the look in his eye wouldn't let us dismiss it Look at what he wants to do as President, and it's clear that he's a dreamer. He has set his sights on enabling the students of Notre Dame to do great things. It has been obvi­ous that Odie has been working for this goal since he set foot on this campus at Freshman Orinntation in 1997, evim to tho oxtcnt of passing up time abroad in order to serve the community in the Student Union. 
The past few weeks have seen the escalation of Odie's vision. Unfortunately, one wrong step may hamper his chance of achieving this goal. While campaigning officially started Tuesday, candi­dates were interviewed by campus publications on Saturday. Believing this exception covered all campus media, Brian and running mate Brooke Norton accepted an offer to appear on campus internet radio WVPI with Jabari Holloway. 
On Sunday, Odie was casually asked if such interviews were allowed since campaigns started on Tuesday. To be certain. Brian made a more official inquiry, and to his dismay round that his radio appearance was, in fact, prohibited. Brian turned himself in at once, and received a two day suspension of campaign activities, which he in turn appealed to the Senate. 
It's become far too commonplace for politi­cians, and people in general, to cover up their mistakes. However, as soon as he realized he might have committed an infraction, Odie sought to turn himself in. This is honorable trait is one of the qualities that we claim as one of Notre Dame's founding principles. Apparently, Brian's colleagues in the Senate agreed with him as they unanimously agreed that while he had made a mistake, the punishment was too severe. In response to the Senate's decision, Student Activities, an administrative group, determined that the Senate had no right to overturn the penalty. 
This letter is not meant as an endorsement of any candidate for Student Body President, but as a sign of support for our senator and friend, Brian O'Donoghue.

I 
Awareness ofsocial irresponsibility ofRepublicans should be raised 
In his Inside Column from Tuesday, Dustin Ferrell is quite right in claiming that Democrats have their individual failings, and he also cor­rectly points out that some Democrats do not hold positions of highest virtue on every issue. But one could claim that of anv human, for we all fall short of perfection. Does human imperfection mean that no idea is better than any other idea? Does the fact that policies are frequently imper­fect mean that one should attempt to improve those policies or, rather, just abandon the issue altogether? Of course, "not supporting ineffective legislation" does not mean "not caring." However. in the absence of proposals of effective legislation from Republicans, suspicion arises as to real motives. The traditional Republican approach to the environment is the frequently discredited one of allowing companies to enforce themselves. Of' course, Republicans receive mil­lions from companies to encourage this position -a cynical person might even say that many companies have no intention of enforcing them­selves. 
Ferrell vastly understates the overwhelmingly positive impact of environmental legislation. And without Democrats (and a few Republicans of good will). there would be no Clean Air Act, no Clean Water Acl. and no effective method of enforcing corporate responsibility in regard to the environment. Give credit where credit is due. It is ludicrous even to compare the Democratic party record to the systematic attempts of the Republican party in 1994 to dismantle even the most basic environmental legislation. 
Lest one think naively that no corporation is completely irresponsible anymore, I point to the long-standing battle between the National Resources Defense Council and Texaco. The NRDC is a highly respected, non-profit, public interest group. According to the NHDC. in 1988, ."our scientists uncovered evidence from Texaco's own internal reports showing that the company had been knowingly and illegally discharging tons of oil, grease and other highly toxic pollu­tants into the [Delaware] river since 1983." Armed with Texaco's own pollution reports and the testimony of local residents, NRDC quickly filed suit against Texaco in federal court. The oil company responded with legal delay tactics for three years, during which it continued to pollute the Delaware River. Finally, in 1991, the case went to trial and a federal judge, calling NRDC's evidence against Texaco (practically unassail­able}, determined that the company had violated the Clean Water Act on a total of 3,360 days." Texaco, fined heavily and discredited, continued to resist and eventually faced contempt proceed­ings for its obstinate delays in undertaking a court-ordered environmental study. The court battle continued into January 2000! 
In regard to race relations, critics of the Democratic Party like Farrell enjoy pointing out the traditional racism of Southern Democrats. Unfortunately, time has passed for that objection. Long ago, the most notorious racists in our gov­ernment (such as Strom Thurmond) got the mes­sage and switched allegiances, to the Republican Party. 
Many Republicans these days endlessly lam­baste President Clinton while lionizing Ronald Reagan as the serene embodiment of the ideals of the Party. Reagan demonstrated his concern for children and education by trying to abolish (not revamp!} the Federal Department of Education. all the while selling weapons to the Contras in blatant defiance of the law. Lest we forget, Bill Clinton was not the first president to have trouble recalling facts while under oath. 
Ferrell imagines that there is no coherent ide­ology to political parties. However, there is, and it's called a platform. In the real world, most of the time, legislators vote the party line. If consci­entious Notre Dame Catholics should not be Democrats because of the abortion issue, a host of issues dictate that they not be Republican either. Realistic voters must honestly address the institutional Republican Party's legacy of social irresponsibility on a wide range of issues, not wish it away.

great building, and it has a great spirit. And we have a great staff. And I'm not just saying that because they're all stand­ing behind me." And that is when the brawl erupted. Not really, but it was touch-and-go for a minute there. 
Asked what she thought of McCandless Hall. Le Mans senior Kathleen Foley replied, "No tunnels, no way," in refer­ence to McCandless's omission from the underground tunnel network at St. Mary's. Foley continued, "And it's closer to Angela Athletic Facility, so it's probably full of really skinny girls." 
But the residents of McCandless know it as more than a location. To them, it's just home. 
Holy Cross Hall 
At the end of the tree­lined Avenue lies a students, and it is possessed of some of the largest rooms ever created. No joke ­you could squeeze a roller skating rink into some of these rooms and still have room to herd alpacas. They are immense and feature hardwood floors, incredibly high ceilings, enormous v..indows, but they only have two temperature settings -Hell and Eskimo Hell. 
The real charm of' this building is not in its parlors or its VendoLand. It is in its community. These are no hostile Amazon women in Holy Cross, living in gated seclusion bringing in men for the sole pur­pose of breeding and then sending them to the place from whence they came. No, these be a friendly and chaste people, and though the author of this article was required to be accompanied by an escort, as are all men in all St. Mary's residence halls, it was still one of the most welcom­ing environments on campus. 
Responding to inquiries of her opinion of Holy Cross Hall, though, LeMans Hall resi­dent Foley stated, "I think it's gorgeous and it's beautiful. but sh-t, the whole dis­tance to class thing. It's way out there." 
Annunciata Hall 
The fourth floor of Holy Cross Hall is actually a residence hall unto itself. Annunciata Hall, a.k.a. "The Rockin' Sorority," is a special section designed for seniors to live in community together, and that is exactly what happens. They live in community. It looks like a normal floor, but Annunciata offers extra amenities such as a very nice break room with a big screen TV. It also has its own computer lab and kitchen, and membors of the com­munity are given a key that accesses the basement entrance so they do not have to pass the scrutiny of the front desk every time they want to enter and leave the building. 
An Annunciata resident who would onlv identify herself as "Gabby" explained: "It's just nice being on a floor with all seniors. The extra door is just a little extra incen­tive." 
Fellow Annunciataette Megan Bodary agreed: "I feel tough. I feel like a big kid, finally, you know? I just like the feeling when you walk in the elevator and get to say, 'Could you press four, please?' It's a separation. It's just enough." 
While there will always be a naysayer such as Foley, -who said: "I always thought it was so funny that they renamed it a whole hall when it's just the fourth 

floor. That's all it is!" -there is something impressive about the community of Annunciata. It is com­posed entirely of women on the brink ofleaving one stage of life and embarking on another journey, and they are all in it. They are all in it together. 
Le Mans Hall 
Opened in 1925, Le Mans (silent "s") Hall houses 520 students 
-

and numerous administrative offices, but it is also the most recognizable land­mark on the Saint Mary's campus. It is an enormous structure with a commanding bell tower as its focal point. Once inside, the first floor is a wonderland of classy wood paneling, and the main lobby is speckled with small metal chandeliers that give it an almost medieval flavor. Large wooden pillars also make their presence felt in the lobby, soft­ly whispering, "Is it a forest, or is it an indoor place?" And then it cackles. 
Most Le Mans Ball residents are absolutely in love with the building and the people who people it. "There's a lot of quiet," said RA Sara Velligan, "so it's easy 
,,. 

to get things done. And at the same time there are a lot of distractions whenever you want to find them. Best of both worlds. really." 
Surprisingly enough, Foley agreed: 'Tm lazy and Le Mans is close to everything. Yeah, we're huge. We have the most washing machines of any building on campus." 
And the one naysayer in Le Mans, who desired anonymity. stated, "There is no best part about living on campus. They're unhelpful and stupid ... Ijust don't like the business department, that's all. I'm sorry." So really, she can pretty much be dis­counted. 
Indeed, any residence hall at Saint Mary's offers a sense of spirit that is diffi­cult to match at other schools; almost all of the women interviewed agreed. Even Kathleen Foley. Despite the sometimes­hindersome issues of visitation hours and 
-... 

access cards, life on the Saint Mary's cam­pus is a life lived in community, and it is largely through this community that Saint Mary's students are able to prepare them­selves for the world outside.

There am nicer places to live than South Bend, but we can make it seem better bv flush­ing. Maybe someday they will get a town sign that says "South Bend: The town that flushes." 
As for dating, there are many things to do, you just have to be a creative mastermind to find them. Going out to eat is popu­lar on Wednesdays. And it doesn't take long to figure out what bar to go to on every night. There arc always the movies. Anything can really be a date. People should just be lighthearted and accept that massage from a stranger. Or sit by that lonely person at lunch. That's a date. Invite some opposite sf'xers ovor for an episode of' "The Simpsons." Climb some trees, go to the Snite, jump off the diving board at Rolf's. Go date, it's the best lime in your lifo to meet all sorts ol' people. Then when you get to know them better ask them if they flush the toilet. And if they uon't, tell them you never want to seP them again. 
Notre Dame is one weird place when it comes to gender relations and commitment between men and women. I think to have commit­ment, relationships are necessary; and those seem few and far between here at ND. ­
Let's examine the Notre Dame relationship, shall we. We'll begin with freshmen year: This is a time when crowds of first-year students can be seen roaming campus (and the off-campus apartment complex­es) on Friday and Saturday nights. These groups participate in dorm­hopping. They move from building to building looking for a good time. Many of these students engage in multiple random hook-ups those first few months of school. They're looking for a good time in a dark corner with an unfamiliar face. Someone they can brag to their friends about, or more likely, avoid in the dining hall for the next four years. 
The darker side to the freshman idea of tho relationship -the per­manent cormnitment. These not-so­rare people find another like-mind­ed individual and begin Lhe dating ritual. These people want to contin­ue on the Notre Drone i'amily ­personally. Before you know it, it is four years later and the couple is trying to decide which city could provide themselves and their chil­dren with the best opportunities. How does it happen? Why isn't their an exorbitant amount ofrnla­tionship-hopping going on? The answer, my friends, comes in the 
THE GAL 


ERICKA RAVETTINE 
form of an example: the SYR. 
Ah, the SYR. This is a dance no one really wants to go to, but every­one must. It's a rite of passage for the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's student. However, with the dance comes the undue pressure of "who do I take?" This is the trouble. 
By the time the dance draws near, you are ready to invite just about anyone -a friend, a friend's friend, that person who sits next to you in class, some guy/girl that passes you in the dining hall or the first cute picture you come to in the Dog Book. 
Though everyone experiences this feeling of desperation, the invi­tee always reads too much into the invitation. Fleeting thoughts of "Oh, he/she must really like me" and "Next spring will he our one year anniversary" are pervasive throughout the evening. The prob­lem (in this example) lies in the mixed-up mindset of the invitee; commitment and dating relation­ships will not ever be normal here if men and women can't learn to talk to each other, rather than jumping to grand conclusions on their own. 
So, what does that leave us with? By senior year, you will know a handful of couples getting married after graduation; you will actually know a few couples who arc tying the knot before that. The rest of your friends, however, will still be in that dark dorm room corner from freshman year, still terrified of any kind of commitment.

NFL 

Marino voids last two years of contract 
Associated Press 
DAVIE, Fla. 
Dan Marino now has some time, and the Miami Dolphins have more money. 
Marino. tlrn !\TL career leader in passing yardage. voided the final two vears of' his ,~ontract with the l)olphins on Thursday. It remainf'd undear whether the 38-year-old quarterback will retire or return for another sea­son. 
Marino r,ould rejoin the Dolphins or go to another team as a free agent. 
'Tm not going to speculatP­about what Dan's going to do." Dolphins president Eddie Jones said Thursday. 
"Dan is a great

still want to do this?' I-le had the injury last Eddie Jones year and his Dolphins president 
knees are not 
getting any bet­
ter. I'm sure that's what he's 
thinking about." 
Marino threw 12 touchdown passes and 17 interceptions last season. missing five games and most of' a sixth because of a neck injury. He finished with a career-low 67.4 passer rnting. 
Coach Dave \\'annstedt has indicated that he would prefer to go with a younger quarter­back like Jim Druckenmiller or Damon Huard. who was 4-1 as a starter last season. 
Though there is no timetable for Marino ·s decision. he likely will make an announcement before ~arch 20. the day the Dolphins begin their offseason workout program. 
"We've got a new coordinator, a new head coach and we're going to have a new offensive 

system," Jones said. "And I don't know how Dan fits into 
that." 

With Marino no longer under contract, the Dolphins gained $5.8 million to spend during tho free agPnt signing period, whirh begins Friday. They also released veteran tight end Troy Draytun on Thursday. 
Dravton, 29, said he will not re-sign with the Dolphins for less money. 
'Tve paid my dues as far as a football player," said Drayton, who caught 32 passes for 299 vards last season. ''I'm finan­cially secure, but money is defi­11itelv an issue. I'm a veteran and icnnsidn myst>U' oni> of the best tight ends in tho league. 
''I'm just going to put some bait on the end of the hook, watch the line and sP.e if thP.re aro any takers." 
Marino might have some tak­ers, too. 
At times. last season, Marino showed glimpses of the player who 
owns nearly every NFL passing record. 
He led Miami to two fourth­quarter comebacks during the regular season. But the Dolphins were embarrassed 62­7 at Jacksonville in the ser,ond round of the playoffs. Miami trailed 38-0 before Marino com­pleted a pass. He finished 11-of­25 for 95 yards with three turnovers. 
"I don't think anybody wants to end a career on the kind of game that we played in Jacksonville," Drayton said. "I-le deserves to go out on a white horse and with lots or fanfare. He's done a lot to revolutionize the quarterback position and the NFL as a whole. 
"I can't see Dan in another uniform." 
PGA 
Tired Woods falters in Buick Invite 
Asoociated Press 
SAN DIEGO 

Davis Lovn Ill and Phil Mickelson, lwo victims ol' lhe greatest winning streak on the PG.I\ Tour in 52 years, put themselvr.s in position Thursday for anoth­
f:r rrack at slopping T i g e r Woods. 
W hi I e W o o d s 
was out of svnc and u~~ually in the rough. Love 
recovered from one mess after another and finished a roller-coastor round at 7­under 65, gb,ing him a one­strokf: lead over Mir,kelson in the Buick Invitational. 
"I just didn't have it," Woods sai.d after a ·1-undrr 71. 
Love, who finished four strokes back or Woods in the Tour Championship, made 10 birdies and a 30-l'oot par save on the South Course at Torrey Pines, considered the more difficult or the two tracks. 
Mickelson, the first victim in the streak that began with the NEC Invitational in August. shot a 66 on the North Course. 
While Love is trying to win for the first time in nearly two 
years.  his  thoughts  were  
never  too  far  away  from  
v\loods.  

"He's the guy to beat as long as he doesn't hurt him­self," Love said. "He's been on a roll since high school." 
Woods was two days removed from his sixth straight victory Monday at rain-delaved Pebble 13each, and he lo·oked like he could have used a day off. 
Trouble was. there was a tournament going on. 
When he failed to birdie the par-5 ninth on the North Course, Woods limped in at 1­under for a six-shot deficit, the largest he has faced after the first round since he trailed by eight strokes in the Bay Hill Invitational 11 months ago. He tied for 58th in that f'vent. . 


"It's OK. There are a lot or holes to play." Woods said. "'l proved that last year. You can go out there and make it up on the wr.ekend. or even tomorrow." 
Last year? What about last week'? 
He was five strokes bai;k going-into tho l'inal round at Pebble Boar,h -seven shots back with seven holes to play -and still managed to win for the sixth straight time, ;:itP.tching Ben Hogan in 1948 for the second-longest strnak on the PGA Tour. 
Ho has his work cut out for him if hf~ is to takn another step toward Byron Nelson's record of 11 in a row. And if the first round was any indi­r,a tiou, a couµle of prime players an> lining up to stop him. 
"I think guys like Fred CouplPs (68). Davis Love and myself are really trying to play at a different level. and hopefully have a different winner out on tour," Mickelson said. "Nobody has really done it yet." 
Maybe the senet is to give Woods a short week to get ready. After the Monday thriller at Pebble, he was at Torrey Pines at the r,rack of dawn on Tuesday and spent Wednesday in the pro-am. All of it seemed to take a toll on the 24-year-old Woods. 
He was 2-over after three holes. and lucky to be that. lie didn't hit a fairway. He didn't even hit a green in reg­ulation. Woods had to make a 15-foot putt on his first hole [No. 10) and a 6-footer just to salvage a bogf:y on the next one. 
By the time he reached the 507-yard 14th hole, Woods wore a look of exhaustion. Even after making a 30-foot eagle to get back to even par, it was all he could do to muster a smile. raise his put­ter in the air and lick his fin­ger to chalk one up. 
He missed a couple of 15­foot birdie putts before his first nine was over, and was muttering to himself on a long walk to the first tee. 
"I think I need a day off." be said after his round, evident by the far,t he dedined to go to the range as the sun set over the Pacific Ocean. ''I've been grinding pretty hard lately. I've been hitting a lot 1Jf balls. Maybe I'm just a little tired and need a little rr.st." 
That's not to say he had no energy. Woods swung so hard with his driver on the :~26­yard second hole that he fell a few steps back. 
"That's all I've got." Im whispered as the ball came one hop short of landing on the grnen. He lipped out a 3­footer for birdie, however, wasting the good drive. 
Still, a tough day at the office for Woods is better than par for the course. 
Even though Woods was six off tho lead, keep in mind that last year he nearly missed the cul and went on to win by two strokes with a 62-65 on the weekend. 
"The guy is awesome, man," said J.L. Lewis, who was in the group at 67. "He r,an play bad and win. and there is not very many guys that you can say that about. There are other guys who have a lot of talent. but he gets the most out of his." 
That's the task facing Love and Mickelson. two supremely talented players who haven't gotten much out of their games lately. 
Mickelson failed to win last year for the first time sinr,e 1992, ending the longest active streak on the PGA Tour. Love won over $2 mil­lion last year, but also failed to win. 
Love spent the offseason trying to retool his swing, which he says partially con­tributed to his back and neck problems last year. The swing held up fine Thursday, even though it took him 10 holes to record a simple par.

NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL 
Barkley's supsension lifted after St. John's appeal 

Associated Press 
NEW YORK 
SL. John's successfully appealed the suspension of sophomore guard Erick Barkley on Thursday and he will play Saturday against Villanova. 
On Turrnday, Barklliy, the team's loading scorer at 16.9 points per game, was suspend­f'd by thC' NCAA for three games for an undisclosed rules violation. SL John's appealed that ruling even though he had alrnady Sflrved one game ­last Saturdav's victorv over Boston College -and ;nissed a ds'e'Cond that night at Providence, another victory for the Red Storm (15-6). 
The Division I Subcommittee on Student-Athlete Heinstatenrnnt upheld St. .lohn's appeal, reducing the suspension to two games. 
·· Erick is obviously very bappy," St. John's coach Mike Jarvis said Thursday night. .. lie appreciates the game more than he did before. He was glad to prac:tice today. Usually it's a chore.... You get a sense of how relieved he is bec:ause he was concerned about his image and percep­tion." 
Tbrough Jarvis, Barkley said hr. was going home after prac­tice and would speak to the 
media after Saturday's game at Madison Square Garden. 
"Today is a time to move on," St. John's athletic direc­tor Ed Manetta said Thursday. "We're not going to got into specifics of the case because that has to du with a student's privacy and we're going to respect that right now." 
Manetta wouldn't give details about the process that stretched almost a week. from notification of the possible vio­lation to the appeal hearing. 
"The NCAA interpreted rules differently than we did," he said. "The committee today ruled on what we presented and took a middle decision 
and that's frequently  a  good  
way  to  resolve them.  This  
committee heard from  both  

sides and made a decision on that." 
The NCAA won't comment on specifics involving a deci­sion without written permis­sion from the athlete. 
The violation in question concerned exchanging cars with a family friend, two sources familiar with the case have told The Associated Press. 
Barkley traded his late model Jeep Cherokee for a bigger but older Ford Expedition that belongs to a family friend, said a source close to Barkley and another with knowledge of the matter, both speaking on condition of anonymity. 

That exchange would have been a violation of NCAA rules if Barkley received preferen­tial treatment because he is an athlete or if it constituted pos­s i b Ie payback for when he turns professional. 
Jarvis said that as far as details, ''it was pretty much what I've been reading in the paper." 
"It was just a matter of if the process were different then we wouldn't have ever had this situation in the first place. This is about the process. It needs to be changed and improved. You should be inno­cent until proven guilty," he said. 
"If there was a problem with the fact there was an exchange of autos among the friends, the first thing was re­exchanging the cars. Again that would be common sense." 
Jarvis made some strong comments about the NCAA last Saturday when the suspension was announced and he pub­licly apologized for using rape when describing his feelings. 
"The outrage had to do with the fact that our arguments were based on common sense and any time someone is wronged when it just doesn't make sense, then that would obviously make anyone out­raged," he said Thursday.

MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL 
Griffey traded to Reds for 4 players 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK 

Ken Griffey Jr. was trad­ed from the Seattle Mariners to the Cincinnati R e ct s to d a y a f t e r agreeing to a con­t r a c t with his home ­t O W 11 team. 
T h e agree­ment was confirmed to The Associated Press by a source close to the negoti­ations who spoke on the condition he not be identi­fied. The deal sends pitch­er Bret Tomko and out­fielder Mike Cameron to Seattle along with minor league infielder Antonio Perez and another minor leaguer, the source said. 
Cincinnati called a news conference for 6:45 p.m. EST. 
Seattle and Cincinnati agreed Wednesday night to a tentative trade that would end the l[}-time All­Star's stay with the Mariners, and Cincinnati 
-
was given 72 hours to work out a contract exten­sion with Griffey that would make the trade final. 
The trade involved only the Reds and the Mariners. There had been specula­tion a three-way deal including Anaheim was in the works. 
"The Angels are not included in any transaction involving the Reds and Mariners," Angels vice president Tim Mead said today. 
The terms or the contract and the other players involved in the trade were not immediately known. 
Griffey's agent, Brian Goldberg, said earlier this week that his client would takr less-than-market value to play for 

Cincinnati, where he grow up. Griffey, who is eligible for free agency after the season, rejected a $148 million, eight-year exten­sion offered by the Mariners last year. 
Seattle and Griffey want­ed thP matter resolved by the start of spring training. 
Griffey. 30, had 398 career home runs in 11 seasons, along with a .299 average and 1,152 RBIs. Hank Aaron, baseball's career home-run leader with 755, thinks Griffey has the best chance to top his record. 
Griffey, who will earn $8.25 million this season, the final year of an $34 million, four-year contract, told the Mariners in November that he wanted to be traded to a team closer to his home in Orlando, Fla. 
Mariners general man­ager Pat Gillick held talks with the New York Mets the following month, but Griffey then said he would accept a trade only to Cine in nati. 
Reds general manager Jim Rowden cut off negoti­ations at the winter meet­ings, saying the Mariners' demands were too steep. Bul talks resumed in recont weeks. 
Goldberg said Tuesday the Mariners gave him permission to talk directly with the Heds in an effort to break the impasse. Since there was no deal in place then and no 72-hour window, that appeared to violate baseball's rules. 
"Enough occurred for us to look into it," said Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of baseball oper­ations in the commission­er's office. 
Alderson said whether any penalties would be issued is something "that still has to be determined." 
"! would say this wouldn't take us very long," he added. "Sometime next week at the latest." 


NBA 
Rodman gets desired attention 
Assoc ia red Press 
DALLAS 

Now that Dennis Hodman has played his first game for the Dallas Mavericks, the wait begins for his first outlandish act. 
There was no reason for Rodman to dye his hair a new shade or to try anything wild on the court in his debut Wednesdav night, a 117-106 loss to Seattle. llis mere presence already had him where he wanted to be: in the spotlight. 
The key with Rodman will be how he responds once people get used to him being around again. That's when he's likely to start pulling the stunts that have made him more famous than rebourid'Y· ing ever could have. 
Another way to push his but­tons is for the Mavericks to lose a lot, something that's entirely pos­sible. Just because Bodman knows Dallas' past doesn't mean he's ready to lose more often than he wins. 
Still, no matter what Bodman does is interesting to a lot of peo­ple. His return to the NBA after 10 months of making movies. wrestling and generally getting into trouble was truly a big-time evont. 
The game drew 18,203 rans, the second-largest home crowd in the Mavs' 20-year history. More than 150 media credentials were issued, triple tho typical amount. 
Plenty of [ans were watching at home, too. Fox Sports Net report­ed Thursday that it was the most-watched Mavericks game the regional sports network has televised since it began receiving ratings in 1994. Viewership peaked at 111,700 from 8:15­
8:30 p.m. and there were an average of 94,065 television homes tuned in throughout the game. 
With so much buildup, all 
Rodman had to do was show up. And he did, even arriving fivo minutes earlier than he had to. 
Rodman played 32 minutes without any problems. 
lie grabbed 13 rebounds and played tough defense. He com­mitted five fouls and drew just as many. He missed his only shot, an attempted tip. 
"Same old Dennis,'' said Sonics forward Horace Grant. "He is still the same, pushing old Dennis." 
Bodman got away with one of his old tricks -locking his arms in another player's, then acting like he was the one knocked down when the other guy tries to get untangled. And he was effec­tive at doling out shoves in traf­fic; Emanua! Davis still may not have regained his balance from one particular jolt. 
But Rodman will need to learn about the NBA's new rules limit­ing contact. While he's at it, he should consider a refresher course in illegal defense as he was twice caught out of position. 
Teammates were excited by what they saw Wednesday. They figure that as he gets into the swing of things, he'll become more of a force. 

"He just has to get his lungs and his feet ready l'or basket­ball," teammate Cedric Ceballos said. 
Bodman told The Dallas Morning News he dmisn't mnsid­er his return a sideshow. 
"I think this is a real good opportunity for me to rome back and one, just to see if I can do it," Hodman said. "Two, the peo­ple here are very generous and nice. Three, to prove a point. If I can make this team get to the playoffs, my job is done. My job is done. 
"It's a challenge, a hell of a challenge to try to turn this team around. Even though I'm not the Michael Jordan of thP NBA, I can do something to make this team a little more physical, a little more hard-core minded that they can go out there and say, 'Hey, we can't be beat. If we're going to get beat, let's go out there and fight our butt off every night."' 
If it happens, the perception of Bodman being a grand disruptor could change. 
If the plan doesn't work, then don't be surprised if Dennis tho Menace returns.

..... 

February 10, 2000 To the Saint Mary's College Community: 
As the current Board of Governance and in light of the recent elections complications, we feel it is necessary to address the members of the student body. Let us start first by assuring each of you that the members of the current student government association who have been handling the recent events have done so with the utmost courage. responsibility, dedication, and intelligence. They deserve our support and encouragement. Their task is not, and has not been, an easy one. 
The 2000-200 I Student Body Election began with the informational meetings that are attended by all tickets considering running. At these meetings, candidates are informed of the election bylaws, and made aware of requirements and deadlines. After these meetings four tickets declared candidacy. The primary vote was conducted on Monday, January 31st and no one ticket emerged with 50% plus one vote-the requirement established in the SGA constitution for a win in the pri­mary election. As a result, according to the stipulations in the bylaws, a run-off election was held. The constitution states that, "The winner of the run-off will be that ticket with the highest number of raw votes." As we are all aware, the results of Wednesday's run-off election were a dead tie. Each ticket received the exact same number of raw votes. As this is a situation that Saint Mary's had never before been presented with, the Elections Commissioner, at the encouragement of the Director of Student Activities, approved a third election. This decision was not made according to the bylaws established in the constitution. The constitution clearly states that, "The only time a revote is to occur is if improper voting procedures were followed." Due to the fact that proper voting procedures were enforced for Wednesday's election a revote was indeed uncalled for, and in fact, was a direct violation of the stipulations set forth in the Student Government Association constitution. Furthermore, decision-making at that point rested in the hands of the Elections Committee, not the Elections Commissioner nor the Director of Student Activities. We acl,<;.nowledge that this oversight was a mistake. 
irl"N 

Unfortunatdy, this oversight was not brought to our atten~fl;until afteffriday's election. The results of Friday's election awarded the Koelsch/Rodarte a higher
,,;-1ull · J 
number of raw votes than the Renner/Nagle ticket. Thes~¥t&'ults, howi~.,are deemed unofficial for 48 hours according to the SGA constitution. This time peri­od is the window of opportunity that is present in every election. giving either ticket the opportunity to file an appeal. Proper election procedure is to inform the candidates of the unofficial results. If, after having been informed of the results, no appeal is filed by either ticket, the results become official. Complaints, on the other hand, and a careful distinction must be noted between a complaint and an appeal, can be filed at any time by any member of the student body. Again, these guidelines are set forth in the elections bylaws of the Student Government Association constitution. 
Sunday the Renner/Nagle ticket filed such a complaint. Their complaint was based on the fact that the Elections Committee was erroneously not consulted in det~rmining to conduct a third election. It also sighted another oversight regarding Friday's election procedures: off-campus voting was not allowed in the Off­Campus lounge. 
In light of these complaints, and according to the SGA constitution, the Elections Committee met on Sunday night to discuss the validity of the complaint and establish a course of action. A quorum of the Elections Committee voted unanimously to nullify Friday's election in light of what they considered to be valid complaints filed by the Renner/Nagle ticket. At this point, the Elections Committee notified both tickets of the decision to nullify Friday's election. The Elections Committee then continued its thoughtful deliberation. The Elections Committee, made up of representatives from each residence hall and off-campus students, faced a great challenge in reaching what they considered to be a fair, just, and impartial decision. The committee mentally placed itself in the position that they shouid have been in on Wednesday night: the point at which, according to the constitution, they should have been consulted. They were faced with determining what an appropriate policy would be in light of not only this election, but also bearing in mind the relevance of this decision on future elections at Saint Mary's. Several options were thoroughly discussed by the committee, including sending the tie-breaking vote to Board of Governance, establishing an emergency electorate. and reverting to Monday's numbers. A revote was NOT an option; it is a direct violation of the Student Government Association Constitution. After approximately four hours of discussion, the Elections Committee reached a conclusion. The decision of the Elections Committee is the following: In the event of a tie in the run-off election, the total raw votes cast from the primary and run-off election will be tallied and the ticket with the highest number of resulting raw votes wins. 
After a majority of the Elections Committee voted in favor of such a policy, the candidates were notified, as well as the Observer. At this point, after the decision of the Elections Committee was made, the constitution states that each ticket has 24 hours to make an appeal. 
In anticipation of a possible appeal from the Koelsch/Rodarte ticket, the Interim Elections Commissioner took steps to insure that the Elections Appeals board would be fully functioning. The Constitution states that the Elections Appeals Board is made up of three members of the senior class who are also members of either Board of Governance, Student Academic Council, Residence Hall Association, or Student Activities Board. Furthermore, the members of the Appeals Board are asked and expected to remain unbiased and refrain from campaigning for any candidates. Unfortunately, one member was unable to serve. The SGA constitution states that. "An Elections Appeals Board will be appointed by the Elections Commissioner and approved by the Executive Committee of the Board of Governance ... " In light of the inability of one member to serve, the executive board voted to approve th~ appointment of her replacement, a senior member of Student Activities Board. 
As expected, an appeal was indeed filed by the Koelsch/Rodarte ticket on the grounds that, "the decision to use the raw votes from the Monday and Wednesday elections is not a valid representation of the wishes of the student body ... " and that they believe the Renner/Nagle complaint was not filed in a manner compliant with the time restrictions stated in the Student Government Association constitution. The Appeals board convened to discuss this appeal. Again, they faced a very difficult task and several options again surfaced. However, the one option the Appeals Board knew was invalid was to call a revote or to take into considera­tion Friday's vote due to the explicit laws stated in the Student Government Constitution. As written by the Appeals Board, their decision is the following, " ... we affirm that the Elections Committee holds sole responsibility to assess elections procedures .. .In the case of the 2000-2001 election, improper elections pro­cedures occurred ... Therefore. Friday's vote was nullified ... Because Wednesday's election resulted in a tie, we refer back to the vote of the Monday, January 31st elections. Monday's results showed that the Renner/Nagle ticket received 43% of the total votes while the Koelsch/Rodarte ticket received 37% of the total votes. The goal of the Elections Appeals Board is to keep in mind the voice of the student body, while remaining fair to the tickets involved. We believe that our deci­sion does accomplish this objective. The decision of the Elections Appeals Board is final and binding." After reaching its decision, the candidates were notified, as well as the Observer. 
The intensity of this election refiects something that we should all be very proud of. This is reflected in the narrow split of the elections. Both tickets are made 
up of strong women yearning to serve Saint Mary's. Both are highly qualified and exemplify the best of Saint Mary's. Both have struggled to stand up for their 
rights as students and as candidates for Student Body President/Vice President. 
We regret that the unfortunate events of the past week have occurred. We always hope that elections run smoothly, and they usually do. However, these recent events have served to solidify our confidence in the workings of the Student Government Association. Events unfolded such that the Constitution was our framework. Due process was followed every step of the way. Decision-making was conducted justly and fairly. In the process, we have maintained the integrity of the elections process and the future integrity of the Student Government Association. In particular, Bridget Heffernan, our interim elections commissioner, has conducted herself ethically, honestly, and has acted with the utmost concern for the interests of the student body. 
This past week has not been easy for any of the parties involved: the candidates, the members of the Elections committee, the Appeals Board, or the student body. This eler.:tion has served to illustrate the importance that even one vote can bear. Finally, we would like to remind everyone that we are all members of the same student body. We implore you to act with graciousness and maturity. There is no one to blame. It was an unfortunate occurrence, however, the strong guidelines established by the SGA constitution have insured fairness. Keep in mind that the student body elected the officials that are currently serving their terms; it is imperative thal we have faith in and support the decisions made by the current Student Government Association. 
Thank you very much and good luck to everyone involved. We are sure that the talents of the four young women involved will not be wasted next year. Saint Mary's is truly blessed to have such skilled and able women present among its student body. 
With Respects, The SMC student body will receive a copy of this letter in their mail tomorrow. 1999-2000 Saint lVIary's College Board of Governance

The NFL's annual free-agent period starts Friday with the possibility that some of pro football's biggest stars will be on the open market. victims of age, injury or the salary cap. 
That group includes Stove Young, Jerry Rice, Dan Marino, Bruce Smith. Thurman Thomas and Dcion Sanders. who all could be retired or with new tt1ams next season.

guidance, Sul.livan began to realize that she could chal­lenge what she had done before -and supercede it. 
"She's a very hard worker," Hildebrandt said. "I knew right away that she could beat all of her previous records." 
Sullivan did beat all of her previous records Thursday night, engraving her place in Saint Mary's swimming histo­ry by setting the 50 freestyle record twice, and anchoring the 200 freestyle relay that cracked the oldest record left on the record board. 
Hildebrandt was visibly moved on the side of the deck, glancing at her watch and up at the scoreboard for confirmation, holding in tears of prido. 
"It brought tears to my eyes," she said. "Everything about her race was perfect ­her start, her turn, her stroke. I was watching in so much anticipation that I didn't even want to look at the board, because I didn't want to he disappointed. The swim was so perfect ... she deserves this so much." 
But Sullivan, who prefers middle distance events, had no idea she had set the record. 
"I just wanted to give it all I could," she said. "In the 50, there's really no time to think. I was just looking for­ward, thinking, 'I own this lane.' I knew that I was going to swim fast." 
But she was unaware of just how fast she would swim. 
"I don't train for the 50, so this was a pleasant surprise," she said. "l didn't even know I'd broken it until I walked around [to Gretchen]." 

Sullivan's role has been one of silent ne!'.essity throughout the season, as the junior has the ability to pull out a tight win in critical situations. As the season progressed, Hildebrandt watched the· woman who came to her uncertain mature into some­one who played an integral role on the team. 
"In her lane, she is the motivator." Hildebrandt·said. "She works hard. and they have fun. She is someone I look to for leadership both in and out of the pool ... she is an excellent role model." 
Her newfound confidence was based in her mental training. an aspect of swim­ming she had never consid­ered before, Sullivan said. 
"I had never trained men­tally before," Sullivan admit­ted. "Since I've gotten back from Ireland, I've had a much more laid back attitude towards the sport. Under Gretchen, l've also learned to he mentally tough, and that mental toughness matters." 
Mental focus will surely come into play for Sullivan, who still has the 100 and 200 freestyle events on her schedule for this weekend. But as far as she's con­cerned, for now, she just wants to take it easy. 
'Tm just trying to have fun, and enjoy swimming because I know one day I'm going to miss it," she said. "As far as breaking records. I hope we're surprising some people -maybe scaring some peo­ple. I'm excited for tomorrow -everyone shocked them­selves today." 
Especially Sullivan.

Kentucky upset encourages Notre Dame for OSU game 
By RACHEL BIBER 
Sports Writer 
Af'lPr posting a hugP win ovPr l8tl1-rankl'd Kentuckv on Tunsday, the 38th-ranked Irish look to keep Lheir hot streak alive. and improvP upon tlH'ir 3-2 rpcord wlrnn they meet 58th­r an kn d Ohio State t h i s Saturdav at th<· fjck Tennis Pa\'ilion. 
T h e recent win over KPnturkv marked tlrn biggest upsf~t by Notre Dame since the 1997 Irish squad. then ranked 29th. upendr.d eighth­ranked Duke 4-3. 

However. after the big win, the Irish are being careful not ­to take Ohio State lightly. 
"W(\ are pretty concerned about Ohio Statr brcause they arc undel'eated," NoLre Dame coach 13ob Bayliss said. "They are prr,tty solid l'rom top to bot­
tom." 
Ohio State has yet to encounter rough terrain this season. blowing by former numbfir 51 Soulb Alabama. TolP-du. Bowling Green and llobert Morris. 
Al'ter posting wins, the Buckeyes received attention by being granted a national rank­ing l'or the first time in at least 
l'our years. 
Chris Porter, ranked No. 62, will lead the Buckeyes into Saturday's match. and will most .likely t'ace .Irish captain and .\II-American Hyan Sachirn in the top singles battle. 

Including the recent win over Kentucky's ninth-ranked Carlos Drada, 14th-ranked Sachire has put together an impressive string of victories and should pose an o!Jstade for Porter. 
The rest of the Irish lineup will prosurnably remain the same as in the previous match. barring the return of injured 56th-ranked junior and l':o. 2 singles player Matt Daly, who has hPen hampered by a shoul­der injury. 
Freshman Brain Farrell stepped up in the No. 6 slot to fill in for 
Daly, and demonstrated his poise and power by clinching the Irish victory over Kentucky in their previous match. 
Sophomore Casey Smith will most likely follow Sachire in the ranks at No. 2 singles. followed by sophomores Javier Taborga, Aaron Talarico and Andrew S o u t. h Alabama, the No. 51 team in the countrv, but this match will be a whole new level of play and we are goi.ng to be on the road as well. This will be by far the toughest test of the season to date."

WOMEN'S TENNIS 
Terrapins serve up competition 
By KEVJN BERCHOU Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's tennis team won't have to wait much longer to find out exactly where it stands in relation to its competitors. 

-
The Irish womim will take on the tal­ented Maryland Terrapins this after­noon at the Eck Tennis Pavilion in a showdown that 
should serve notice as to exactly how far they have ·come, or perhaps how far they need to go. 
Coming off an easy 9-0 trouncing of Yale, Notre Dame will be provided with a much more daunting test when they take on Maryland this after­noon and attPrnpt lio run its season record tu 4-1. 
"They're very talented," head coach Jay Louderback said. "They're as athletic as any team we'll play all year." 
As always, the Irish will be !ed bv junior All-American Michelle Oasso, wh~1 will play both No. 1 singles and doubles. Dasso played exceptionally well in her last singles match and looks to have recovered from a fall shoulder injury. 
Sophomore Becky Varnum and junior Kelly Zalinski will be relied upon heavily to pick up key points in No. 2 and No. 3 singles, respectively. 
Maryland has been surging lately. easi­ly winning its first three dual meets of' the season. The Terps are young ­almost to a fault. And their lack of expe­rience could play into the hands of the Irish. 
"They haven't had a tough test all year," Louderback said. "With the fresh­men playing in their first big match, that could be a difference." 
The Terps' top two players are extremely talented, yet inexperienced, freshmen. First year player Delia Causevic, a native of Bosnia, will battle Dasso in ~o. 1 singles, while her class­mate Jessica Johnson will take on Zalinski. 
Causevic has been on top of her game lately but she too will be tested as her match with Dasso will be her toughest to 

date. 
With the lri.sh hav­ing sent two doubles teams to the Rolex Indoors last weekend. and the Terps featur­ing Johnson and Causevic as their No. 1 doubles pair, the doubles matches should be intersting. 
Dasso and Varnum will receive a strong challenge from Causevic and Johnson. 
Junior Kimberly Guy and freshman Katie Cunha will play No. 2 doubles in hopes of continuing lheir tine play. 
Maryland, rarely tflsted in thrfle previ­ous victories over Missouri. West Virginia and Georgetown, faces a diflicult test in meet­ing 011 Notre Dame's home court. 
Since beating thll Washington Huskies lust month, the Irish have not taken on a quality opponent, making this match a valid indicator of the squad·s current state. 

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
Irish look to improve against Red Storm 
By KERRY SMITH 
Assisrant Spons Editor 
When the time ran off the clock against Pittsburgh Wednesday, the frish were able to put another notch in the win column, but their sloppy play left a mark on the fifth-ranked squad. 
faltering for the l'irst time in con­ference action, the Irish allowed the Panthers hang with them too lung and let the unranked 13-9 squad come too dose lo an upset in the 81­74 contest. 
As thn final stretch uf' the rngular season brings a l'lurry of tough matchups for Irish head coach Muffet McGraw's 20-2 team, tonight's game against Big East rival St. John's may just be what Notre Dame need to gP.t back un track. 
Defending an undefeated confer­ence record and looking to increase an already record-breaking 16-game winning streak, the Irish play host to tho Red Storm in tho teams' second meeting this season. 
"I don't think we'll have the same performance against St. John's," said Irish center Huth Riley. "We loamed a lot from our game Wednesday night. You nP.ver want to say that playing ba<l is a good thing, but there is a lot we can take from that game." 
The Irish are all too aware NCAA that the Big Eusi and tournaments arc looming and recognize tho importance of staying on top. 
McGraw will look for more consis­tent play from her starters in the lane and an improved effort from the bench against St. John's. The Irish have struggled recently getting the ball to the post. 
"We've been working in practice now for woeks on throwing the ball high," said M~rnw. "It's not that difficult. We continuallv throw it to tho defender. We'll h·avc to keep working on that." 
Riley scored 19 points in Wednesday's game, but didn't play a major role on offense until midway through the second half. 
Riley knows Urnt she and her team­mates will have to stay focused to ensure a win over St. John's. 

"A lot of the players on the team wcren 't ready to play on Wednesday," said Riley. "Each time you play a team twice it's harder to beat that team a second time. ft's a great opportunity for St. John's to f'.ome here and gain some respect in the polls because we are ranked fifth." 
When the Irish traveled to New York in January for the teams' first game, they handed the Red Storm a crushing 69-49 loss. Guard Danielle Green teamed up with Riley to lead the Irish with 16 points apiece. 
The Red Storm's Latasha Thompson scored a game-high 20 points and has continued to lead the St. John's squad in their three games since last matching up with the Irish. 
The Red Storm, at 8-13, has won only three conference games this season. The unranked squad is com­ing off an overtime loss to Syracuse Wednesday. 
The Irish have never lost to the Hect Storm, holding a 7-0 advantage in the series.

Belles compete in second day of MIM Championships 
 Sullivan exceeds expectations after year-long layoff 
By NOREEN GILLESPIE Saint Mary'o Editor 

.. Colleen Sullivan stepped onto · the pool deck in September convinced that she wasn't going to live up to what she used to be. After a year abroad in Ireland. the junior sprinter was looking to return to swimming because she missed it; but after a vear and a half without seriui:is train­ing, she knew that achieving the standards she was usB<l to was close to impossible. "She came in. first day, and said flat out that she didn't know if she could do what she had done in high school," said coach Gretchen Hildebrandt, who admitted that she didn't know what to immediatelv expect from Sullivan. · Sullivan wasn't sure what she could expect from herself, either. "I was very worried," she said about her return to com­petitive swimming. "I had got­ten in to do a 500 over the summer, and it killed. I hadn't done anything in the water in a year and a half. It definitely affected my ronfi­dence." So easing back into the sport, Sullivan trailed in her lane, unsure of what her capabilities would allow her to do. "As far as training, at the beginning part of the season, I'd volunteer to go last in my lane," Sullivan said. "I had lost confidence in my training more than my races. It took me awhile before I could lead the lane." But under Hildebrandt's

. Record-breaking performances lead Belles' dominance 
By NOREEN GILLESPIE Saint Mary's Editor 
Coach Gretchen Hildebrandt had one wish for her swim­mers leading into the MIAA swimming and diving champi­onships: That they would attack their races. 
Arter Thursday night, attack was no longer the word she could use to describe her swimmers' performancBs. 
It was more like destroy. 
Maybe it was the unexpected fourth place standing the Belles found themselves in at the conclusion of Thursday's finals. Maybe it was the fact that Saint Mary's swimmers dropped more time than any other team in the conference championship. Or maybe it was the four record-breaking performances the athletes posted throughout the course of the day that led Hildebrandt to believe that maybe her high expectations for the wBekend just weren't high enough. 
"This is what I dream of," said Hildebrandt, first-year coach for the Belles. "You can never guarantee anything, but this -this kind of day -this is what you hope for." 
Rebounding from a sixth place MIAA finish in 1999, the Belles sought to advance with the home court advantage in their corner in 2000. After tal­lying dual meet scores and analyzing expected perfor­mances, a fifth-place finish for the weekend was not an unreasonable goal. But when Thursday's tallies put the team in fourth place ahead of Alma, Albion, and Olivet Colleges after day one, the team admit­ted that it might be time to rBevaluate that goal. 
"lt's hard to say if we're going to stay here," 
Hildebrandt said. "Every sin­gle day is different, and we don't have anyonB in the 400 individual medley tomorrow, which will hurt us. But we will have fantastic performances tomorrow." 
Regardless, Saint Mary's rise to fourth place does make Alma and Albion Colleges, both of which defeated the Belles in regular season com­petition, take this team a littlB more seriously. 
"This shows a couple of teams that we are really tough. They may not be tapered as well, and that's
