Philosophy, rules change go to SLC 
by Anthony Abowd News Editor 
A staten on Christian philosophy for ND staff and S!:' eral suggestions for rules revisions head the lisl of summer work done by the office of Student Affairs. 
The statement, delivered to the rectors at their orientation, "is an in' ·~1 attempt to recognize the Christian nature 01 . dationships that staff should use with students," says Dr. Robert Ackerman, director ofstaff development in Student Affairs·, "This is a staff policy not something which asks any action on the part of the students." 
The Rule revisions are suggestions presented by Student Affairs to the Student Life Council (SLC). The SLC is responsible for revisions of the Student Manual. Some of. the suggestions representing softening past University policy conerning the use of alcohol on campus. 
STUDENT AFFAIRS IS prepared to permit ·alcohol use in private rooms and elsewhere on campus "in accord with guidelines established by the Office of Student Affairs," according to the most recent revision of legislation to be presented to the SLC. 
The present Student Manual lorDIOS "tne use or presence of alcoholic beverages in all public places on campus." It does mention the use of alcohol in private dorm rooms. 
"We have submitted a working document of suggestions," sates Phillip Faccenda, vice­president of Student Affairs, "which we hope will lead to a redrafting of the university rules." 
Ackerman stresses that these ideas are not in 
their final form but suggestions from the Office 
of Student Affairs to the SLC. 
"These are our ideas, what we think it ought to be," says Ackerman' "We are not trying to pressure anyone to accept them." 
MEETINGS FOR THE SLC, a committee composed of students, faculty and a~­ministration, have not been set. The SLC IS charged by the Board of Trustees of the university oto periodically revise the Student Manual. .. 
me statement on Christian philosophy for the 
staff is not in its final form. It asks that rectors 
and all Student Affairs personnel be Christian in 
their actions with students. 
"We're trying to make a short statement of our 
educational purpose. It's a value statement of 
what we believe and are willing to do with regard 
to our educational format," said Faccenda. 
Student Affairs under Faccenda's leadership, 
began formulating its policies and goals only 
since last May when Faccenda 's appointment to 
his present position was made permanent. At 
that time a large number of staff reallignments 
were also announced. Over the summer the 
offices for Student Affairs was moved to a new 
location in room 315 of the Administration 
building. 



Faccenda 

Faccenda outlined several other areas, in addition the Christian philosophy and the rule revisions, which his staff prepared over the summer. 
Student Affairs has prepared a draft for 

_ revising hearing procedures and other appeals methods concerninguniversity discipline. These suggestions will also go to the SLC for their consideration. 
ALSO THE OFFICE has outlined procedures for rector orientation and staff education. This will be Ackerman's primary responsibility. 

"I will hopefufly spend the year trying to help the professional staff develop skills to do a good jobs," says Ackerman. "There are concerns the rectors have, such as counselling and un­derstanding the personal growth of students that I can help with." 
Faccenda hoped to have a free flow of in­formation from his office to the students this year. 
"My underlying theme is that ever-ything we do is open. In terms of policies and attitudes we're going to be as open as possible. This will, I hope, eliminate many suspicions," says Fac­cenda. 

Storage hit; losses 'minimal' 
by Art Ferranti Executive Editor 
Thieves broke into the Notre Dame fieldhouse shortly before students returned from summer vacation. 
Used for summer storage by students, the fieldhouse sustained minimal losses, according to Jim Hunt, ND graduate of 1973 and president of the 73 senior class, who was in charge of the summer storage. 
Security estimated that the burglary took place between 3: 30 
p.m. and 6:45a.m. between Aug. 23 and Aug. 26. 

Hunt Silid Tuesday that two or three of the best bicycles were taken, as three stereos and 200 boxes and trunks were broken into. He speculated that the thieves were after objects of high value which could be easily fenced. 
A box of 200 records has also been reported missing and some furniture damaged, according to Security. Arthur Pears, directorof securi~y, reported "Thebuilding is like a sieve." They have often found the building unlocked. Wire clippers were used to break in, but there are no clues as to the identify of the thieves. 
Rod Braye, the resident of the fieldhouse, became ill ap­proximately 3:00 p.m. Thursday, August 23. Security took him to the informary a few minutes later, and when he returned on Saturday, he did not check the storage area. Storage guard Ziggy Podemski, last year's notary public and custodian of Stepan Center, notiCed the disarray of bikes and boxes Sunday morning at 7:30a.m. 
Security did know about the storage in the fieldhouse, ac­cording to Pears, but they were not officially notified and did not have

Tolkien dies 

Author J .R.R. Tolkien, former Oxford professor noted for his famous Lord of the Rings trilogy, died Tuesday in Bour­nemouth, England, at the age of 81. 
A family spokesman said that Tolkien, who had been in failing health, became ill while visiting friends and was taken to a nearby nursing home where he died a short time later. 
Toikien's first book, The Hobbit, was 
. written in 1939 for his own children. The Lord of the Rings trilogy appeared 14 years later, which sold well from the start but suddenly became a best seller in the 1960's and Tolkien's tales of a middle earth kingdom populated by hobbits, trolls, ecchnated dragons, and evil mountains I grew into an international student cult. 
~ 
The book's fame soared into the millions with over 100,000 sales annually, and the 
j
paperback editions sold even more.

. Tolkien retired as a professor of English language and literature from Oxford in 1959, and had lived in semigtclusion since that time. Earlier this year he was to

'Frankie's' revived as 'The Library' 
Notre Dame alumnus opens new bar 
by Maria Gallagher St. Mary's Editor 
Notre Dame students have long been noted for their prowess with the brew, but few have ever bought more than a keg at a time, much less 10 kegs, 250 cases of beer, 50 cases of wine and 175 cases of liquor at one time. 
Of course, a restaurant came with that purchase. 
Notre Dame graduate Rick Kanser ('73) recently purchased Frankies restaurant on Notre Dame Ave., and expects lots of help from his fellow Darners to 

keep. his business going. So far he 
has invested over $8,000 in a new 
bar and various other renovations. 
"The Library," as it has been renamed, will offer students "a clean place where they will be treated with respect and not subjected to ridiculous prices," according to the new proprietor. 
"South Bend has never really had a good student bar, and students hve been ripped off all. over town," Kanser commented from personal experience. "They deserve better because they are potentially good business." 
The restaurant's image is Kanser's foremost concern. "Business has gone downhill here the past two years," he noted. "I'd like to cha that right away." 
For starters, Kanser has redecorated and installed new game machines, and exnects an all-female crew of bartenders in the fall. The Library will continue to serve food, but the greasy pizza of old will be replaced by a type of thick-crusted Sicilian pizza or­deredfrorr.Chicago. The restaurant will open daily at 11 for lunches 

and  will  still  sponsor  "dinner  
specials."  Live  bands  will  be  
featured on weekends.  
This is Kanser's first  business  

venture. Just barely over In­diana's legal drinking age himself, he gained previous experience as a bartender at the Senior Bar. He plans to expand his staff in the fall to "30 or 40 Notre Dame students and graduates." 
Summer business has packed the establishment on weekends, and an even greater volume is ex.. pected when the students return, but Kanser said he plans no further expansion. 
"At this point, I can't afford it, 
but I'd also like to keep the place 
small." He feels his place of 
business will have a "friendlier 
atmosphere" than the larger bars 
in town. 
Kanser also feels that the mark 
of a good business is a concerned 
owner. He speculated that the 
reason business had slacked off in 
several places around town was 
because the owners were never 
there, or obviously didn't keep 
close tabs on their places and 
personnel. 
"Customers notice these things. 
If an owner doesn't really care, his 
place reflects it. Just being there 
can make a big difference. Kanser 
will literally be "living" there-on 
the second floor. 
He modestly disclaims any 
credit for the establishment's new 
name, which was first suggested 
as a joke. "That was Rich Sher­
man's idea," he admitted. Kanser 
himself was out playing golf when 
the new sign for the front arrive. 
"I really didn't think they'd do 
it," he grinned. 
Kanser first got the "crazy idea" 
of running a bar in October of his 
senior year. He had originally

'Civil rights center set up 
A new political and social force has been founded at Notre Dame. Financed bya $50,000 grant from 
the Ford Foundation, the newly formed Center for Civil Rights under the direction of ND law professor Howard A. Glickstein is aiming toward provision of new and dynamic leadership for the civil rights movement. 
"The civil rights movement is now in need of fresh, new ideas," director Glickstein noted. "The problems over the years have become more sophisticated and our thinking on civil rights has grown stale. The center will generate these new ideas to meet such sophisticated problems 
The Center, operating in conjunction with the ND law school, intends to be a nation:.! organization, focusinF Jinmarily on national civil rights issues. It wm house the papers of Father Hesburgh compiled during his tenure as member of the Civil Rights Commission as well as the collections of other civil rights leaders. 
. . GLICKSTEIN SEES the center as a catalyst of revived interest in civil rights. Through the "power of publicity" Glickstein hopes that the center can influence social and governmental action by making recommendation and proposing solutions. He envisions a day when the center will lobby on pending legislation, comment on presidential propo.<>als, and testify before congressionall committees. 
.. "THE CENTER will be a facility which scholars from all over the country can come to study the 
1 problems and history of the civil 
1 ri_ghts movement," said 
Glickstein. "It will acquire a degree of expertise so that it will be a clearinghouse for advice on all civil rights issues." 
Glickstein is somewhat alarmed at the apparent apathy toward civil rights that exists at Notre Dame as well as all across the country. He cites the complexity and subtlety of discrimination as the cause of this apathy. 
According to Glickstein, many forms of discrimination are built into the systems 1>f society. An example of such institutionalizer' bias is certain intelligence tes1 which place minority groups at disdvantage in obtaining er ployment. 
. CIVIL RIGHTS PROBLEMS are simply so massive and complex that the public has difficulty seeing immediate solutions. 
"It was easy to get people ex­cited about civil rights several years ago when the goal was to give people the right to vote. But

Increased enrollment cramps 100 freshmer1 
As a result of Notre Dame's mysterious inability to be affected by nationally decreasing collegiate enrollment trends, nearly 100 freshmen have been placed this fall in forced living quarters on an already over crowded campus. Despite the nationwide tendency towards . decreased enrollments, this year Notre Dame experienced an increase of 5 per cent over 1972 Summer arrests solve mystery  in the number of accepted ap­plicants who actually agreed to attend school this fall. John Goldrick, director o[ ad­missions, said that out of 3059 applicants who were accepted in the spring, 1800 have confirmed their intention to attend Notre me, 175 students greater than the ex­pected frosh population. The admissions department, according to Goldrick, traditionally accepts twice the number of frosh arplicants th~ university expects for the fall semester. Although historically only 50 per cent of those accepted actually agree to attend, 59 per cent of the applicants confirmed  Cancellations occur when an applicant who has been accepted and has confirmed his intention to attend, pays the enrollment fee only to later reverse his decision. As of August 8, when the number of cancellations historically ex­ceeds 100, only 45 conf)rmed ap­plicants had decided against Notre Dame. But hopefully the overcrowded conditions for freshmen will only be temporary. Rev. John Mulcahy, director of on-campus housing, said that an effort to "uncrowd" the freshmen will be made as space becomes available. But upperclassmen, who agreed last spring to overcrowd their  were filled with excess students. Morrissey was hardest hit by the overcrowding, as their population jumped from its original 307 to a present total of 337. Alumni was also hit hard, increasing by 24 to its present 300. Mulcahy said that he expects the demands for on-campus housing to be as great this year as last, but declined to speculate as to the seriousness of next spring's situation. He said that he wants to keep all options open until the situation becomes more clear. Goldrick was unable to project whether or not the current ooom m enrollment would continue next year. He cited the start of  coeducation last year as a possible reason for the increase. He said that it still must be decided whether the present in­crease should be used as the guide in determining policy for accepting applicants next year, or whether the same system should be aga.in be used hoping that this year's increase was unique. Women were not affected by the overcrowding, as the quota was reached in August and transfer applications were immediately cut off. All of the overcrowding oc­curred in the men's dorms, and all forced rooms weredetermined · with the cooperation of the in­dividual hall rector.

The summer has been a series of completely unexpected develop­ments for the admissions people who rely on the "numbers game" for acrueing a workable freshman class size.

Preliminary phone dir~t.ories were ready for distribution when the campus opened-registration. The phone directory has been plagued with problems in past years and last year was not even published until well into the first semester. 
"The student directory has always been a problem," says Rick Sullivan, registrar at ND and the man chiefly responsible for the early edition of the directory. The preliminary directory was ready last Thursday and given to the hall rectors for distribution. 
"There is a two-fold reason for the preliminary director," Sullivan states. "First, it is a service-to get the information into the public's hands. Secondly, it is an editing tool to get corrections and updates on the information printed." 
Sullivan explained that the front cover of the directory contains a tear-off coupon for students, faculty and staff to revise the in­formation in the directory. Students turn revisions into the House Office, 315 Administration Building, not into Sullivan's office. 
The preliminary directory was made possible by some revisions in procedure and utilizes the student master file the registrar has in computer storage. 
''The information in the direc­tory is accurate as of August 20th. Changes have been made since then, mainly new admissions, ad we did not have the local addresses of many of the off-campus ~tudents," Sullivan says. 
Sullivan stresses that the students, faculty and staff must take the initiative to correct mistakes in the preliminary. All changes are due before September 12. 
"If the final version is incorrect, onlythe student is to blame. They 
 can edit the directory before it becomes final. That's the biggest benefit of the directory," says Sullivan. 
Final versions of the directory will be turned over to Promotional Enterprises, an Indianapolis company, after September 12, to print the official university directory.

Dean of Students for the University 
of Notre Dame. 
"Primarily, discipline is a developmental tool , " explains Macheca. "My major concern is that we use resources that can help in growth and development of our students." 
Macheca also sees his function in the traditional sense of keeping order in the ND student com­munity, but he stresses that this will be only a secondary function for him. 
"Discipline has a place within the community. It can primarily function as a developmental force within the lives or our students and secondly as a function of good order. However, in extreme cases, the developmental model cannot preempt the need for order in the community," he says. 
SINCE JULY Macheca has been Dean of Students. He replaced Fr. James Riehle who held the position for six years. Macheca is a 1962 graduate of ND with a degree in Latin American Studies. He did his graduate work in Mesico. After privileged classes were given special consideration in the judicial processes."

working for the Defense Depart­ment for several years, he came back to ND to run the Public 
Relations,md Development Office in Chicago in December 1969. 
Macheca is impressed with the human resources on campus and hopes these will become his primary tool in executing his job. 
"We can do more than other places primarily because the human resources we have, starting with the students, are at one un­believable level of quality. At this place there is staggering potential. 
There is a great group of young 
people. The other constituencies, 
the Student Affairs personnel, are 
people who care about the 
students," he says. 
These human resources, 
Macheca hopes, will follow his lead 
and concentrate on developmental 
discipline. He has run numerous 
sessions to familiarize staff with 
the philosophy. 
"I've spent the entire orientation

rectors, assistants and rectorsand

Macheca says. 
"WE also feel that awareness if a 
very important ingredient in 
developmental discipline," he 
adds. Macheca hopes to set up a 
"viable counselling service 
through the Dean of Students that 
would even include students." 
Along with increased awareness, 
Macheca would like greater 
flexibility in the types of punish­
ments at his disposal. 
"Implicit in rehabilitative

A potprurri--any mixture of unrelated objects, subjects, etc. A potpourri is what is offered here, but all bound together within the realm of Notre Dame. 
The Dining Hall-The renovations of the South Dining Hall are amazing to say the least, but talk among students is skep­tical about its workability. The new system can run efficiently and will run efficiently as soon as old habits are broken and the new system becomes acclimated to the students. Security--There were big headlines this summer that two juveniles were ap­prehended and convicted of on-campus crimes. In their statements, they con­fessed to 10 campus crimes from the past semester. Yet, the apprehension of the suspects was made by a resident of Lyons Hall, not security, the protectors of the campus. To c<mpound this, the Fieldhoose was broken into and an un­determined number of items from summer stoarge were taken. Security 
claimed that they storage was taking  did  not know place in  that the  
Fieldhoose  over  the  summer,  even  

thoogh that. storage had occured there for countless number of years prior to this summer. 
The New Philosophy--The new philosophy that came oo t d Dr. Philip Faccenda's Central Staff this summer, really wasn't that new. Tre philosophy was a good restatement of things that have always existed at this university and the rules with slight renovation, are basically the same as the past ones. 
What was most encouraging a bout the rulesandthephil<liophy was the partthat students played in the shaping of the document Though theywerenotdirectly involved in the meetings that resulted in the philosophy, they played an important advisory role to the central staff.

Student Directory--The idea of finally producing a preliminary student phme directory is not visionary, only basic and it's surprising that it took so long to come about. But nontheless, congratulations on a good, smmd idea finally coming to pass. 
Punishment--Tre idea of how you punish thos1e who dis obey campus regulations is a question that came to the front last year with the infamous Lewis Hall case. With the juggling of the central staff, the insertion of John Macheca as Dean of Students and the writing of the new philosophy, it again appears to have come to the front The attitude of Macheca and the entire central staff is a healthy, excellent at­titude. I nw hat the Central Staff terms a communityof scholars, it is questionable from the start that there should be regulations at all--if we stay within their definition of community. But nonetheless, if there must be rules, there inevitably will be offenders and the hardest ques1ion arises--the question of how do you handle the offenders? 
A strict "knee-jerk" policy of treating offenders leveling them with apunitive sentence-has not place in a universi1y. Punitive action should not be the rule in disciplinary cases, just the exception. Instead the policy that Mac hec a asserts, developmental rehabilitation policy, is in order. Students are not criminals and they should be treated with compassion with a sense of rehabilitation when they have crossed u Diversity policies. 
This policy is anexcellentone, yet most students are waiting with an ap­prehensive air--waiting to see what develops. Faccenda's staff has pledged themselves to fair and equal justice on campus and we await and welcome this stance.

How are you doin' today? 
Lots of things are running through my mind ... but it's so hot, I'm really having trouble sorting things out. 
This year is beginning a lot differently than any of the three that went before. I mean, before my prime responsibility was to myself, But no more ... 
It's pretty exciting when I think about the possibility of really af­fecting someone else's life, which is what an R.A.'s job is all about to me, but it is quite a responsibility. 
And I guess I'm a little scared. 
It's difficult when I remember how a lot of guys will think I'm out to be "Big Brother" and breathe down their necks all year. But I doo't want that at all. 
And I guess I'm afraid that all the guys won't appreciate the im­portance of respecting the rights of everyone living around them. But I feel badly when I lose trust in people I haven't even given a chance yet. 
Especially when everyone has really been great these first few days, helping each other move in, making newcomers to the hall feel welcome. 
I really think it's going to be a worthwhile year. 
But I wish I felt more comfortable approaching people I don't know.. .I mean, how do I know that they really don't mind me being around? 
That's strange, isn't it? I mean theway I get all upset about things that haven't even become problems yet.. .and which may,never become problems. I guess I'm just really apprehensive about success. 
Success. I hope I never let that become my entire motivation for what I do. I mean, it's necessary for me to achieve some sense of self­satisfaction, but I've been involved with people long enough to know that the search for results can lead to a lot of frustration. 
And what's really important is for the guys to notice some amount of growth. That's what I'm all about this year... helping guys grow, and appreciate their growth. Then maybe some pattern will become apparent in their lives, and growth will become a conscious habit. 
That would be great. Really great. ,' 
It's hard though. I mean, coming back to Notre Dame and trying to help all of these guys grow. Not because of them, but because of the pattern that's developed in my life. 
I really miss Donna. I mean, it's really difficult learning to share and love with one person, knowil;g that she'll always be there to make the going easier, and then to suddenly find that not only isn't she right there to help, but that there are 50 new guys with whom I have to form a relationship. 
Because this job can really get lonely. Not because there aren't plenty guys just as willing to help me as 1 am willing to help them, but because I wonder how I can touch their lives with any of the intensity 
~ 
with which I touched the person I love back home. 
I know that that's a really great thing to say about my relationship with Donna, but I guess it could lead to frustration if I expect too much from the guys. 
I know what I have to do .. .l have to appreciate all the little things that happen this year; I have to reach a point where I say that what I've done is all I'm capable of doing. 
And then do more. 

I hope I'm making sense, God. Help me realize that I'm not really alone. You're here, and so is Donna. If I sink those terrific facts into my thick, emotional head, my work, and yours, should be a lot easier. 
Thanks for listening, Father. I'll talk to you again later.

The Observer today introduces to its campus readers the work of Pulitzer Prize winning cartoonist Pat Oliphant. ms work, some of which is pictured on this page, has also merited for him the Sigma Delta Chi award for editorial cartooning. 
A native of Australia, Oliphant came to the United States with his family in 1964 and since that time has been displaying his prize-winning work in the Denver Post. At present, his art is syndicated to more than 300 other newspapers across the country. 
"The basis of my cartoon is humor," says Oliphant, for "there is no better vehicle for satirical thought." In those instances where a particularly grim subject might indicate straight approach, "the contrast that humor affords thrusts the messaee home with fresh impact." 
Prior to his arrival in Denver, Oliphant had already established himself as a cartoonist of note. From 1955 until his departure for America, he was the editorial cartoonist of of the Adelaide Advertiser, the state's largest daily newspaper. 
In i958, he won two of the top prizes in London's "Great Challenge Editorial Cartoonist Competition," an in­ternational contest designed to find the funniest editorial cartoonist in the world. All western nations were represented in the competition. 
Besides the Pulitzer Prize and the Sigma Delta Chi award both of which he garnered in 1966, Oliphant has been a two­time recipient of the Reuben Award, presented by the National Cartoonists Society as Outstanding Cartoonist of 1972. 
Artist Oliphant tackles the world of politics, foreign affairs, social attitudes, and customs in the traditior. of European master humorists, but directs his work squarely at an American audience. His international background, talent, and complete editorial freedom make this possible. 
And Oliphant has a real grasp of the American point of view. He understands the American way of life and reflects this incisive outlook in all of his cartoon panels. 
Starting today, the Observer will regularly offer the work of this renowned young artist as an addition to the editorial and features departments. Make it a point to look for Oliphant's distinctive viewpoints on these pages.

The. actual movement began 
seven years ago at Notre Dame. Rev. Edward O'Connor, C.S.C., one of the founders said, "When we started, we had 25 people gathered·· in a one-room house in South Bend and were wondering what is going to come of this movment." 
They stress renewal within the church through a personal relationship with the Holy Spirit and its gifts such as healing, prophesy and tongues. Intensive Bible study is an important facet of the Charismatic Renewal. 
The movement has grown considerably as shown ·in the history of the Charismatic Renewal Conference. At the first event in 1967, 90 people from Notre Dame and Michigan State University joined together in what was called "a reflection of what the Lord was doing with them." 
In 1968, 150 people came to Notre Dame for the affair and the number jumped to 450 in 1969. The 1970 conference ended with a mass concelebrated by 40 priests with over 1,300 people in attendance. 
1971 and 1972 found first 4,500 and then 11,000 people coming to South Bend to "Praise the Lord." 
At this year's conference, a plane flew low over the stadium as Patty Gallagher of New Orleans gave her testimony Saturday. The stadium was full with people from the U.S. and others from Ireland, Israel, Germany, South America, India, Belgium, France, Australia, Mexico, Korea, and Puerto Rico. The noise covered her words until the plane pulled up and everyone heard her announce "Praise the 
Lordy Jesus Christ," The crowd as 
one responded back: "Praise the . Lord, Alleluia."

21 new faculty members added at SMC 


by Maria Gallagher Saint Mary's Editor 
Staff changes have been made in almost every academic depart­ment at Saint Mary's with the addition of nine new full-time faculty and 12 new part-time tea­chers. Four are returning from leaves of absence. 
Earl Holmes joins the biology department as an assistant professor, corr.ing from Elizabethtown College. He received his B.A., M.S. and Ph.D from Earlham College, 1\l,ller­sville State College, and Texas A & M Universiy respectively, and also taught at Franklin Pierce College.

Student Board 
by Mary Janca 
Staff Reporter 
Getting the newly-structured 
Student Board of Governance to 
function successfully is the major 
goal for St. Mary's student 
government this year, according to 
its chairman, Barb McKiernan. 
"We have to see that it is going to 
work before we announce the 
proposals we hope to pass through 
it," she said. 
The Board is a triumvirate, 
composed of a chairman, the Hall 
Life Commissioner, and the 
Student Affairs Commissioner. 
Under the Hall Life Commissioner 
are the 4 hall presidents, while the 
4 class officers are under the 
Student Affairs Commissioner. 
"The main idea of this 
structure," explained McKier­
nan , "is to diffuse student 
government. Class presidents 
were not really brought in and 
involved, and the hall presidents 
were isolated in each of their own 
halls." 
Under the new system, she 
continued, class and hall 
presidents can exchange ideas and 
get help from each other. One has 
to do with other, she said. 
THE BOARD WILL also get away from a 'figurehead' type of student government, as it was. There is to much for 1or 2 people to do. More people will be involved this way," she added. 
McKiernan labelled the Board an "experiment." However, "I'm positive it will work. The feeling of the school is up, and this is much better than the old structure.'' 
However, other structural changes, such as the creation of a College Senate, review of the Student Relations Board, and the choosing of a student represen­tative on the Board of Regents, are already in the making, according to McKiernan. 
"THE COLLEGE SENATE is a step from the planning process, and will include alumnae, faculty members and students serving in a senatorial capacity. It will work like the U.S. Senate," stated the Board Chairman. 
The senate, she believes, will give SMC President Dr. Edward Henry "a unified backing," since proposals passed through this body must meet the approval of all members of the SMC community. 
Thus, any proposals passed by the Student Assembly will be sent to the College Senate, and from there to the Board of Regents for approval, added McKiernan. 
THE STUDENT RELATIONS BOARD, formerly the Judicial Board, will be reviewed to allow each hall to make more of their

New South Dining Hall 
features scramble areas 
by Jerry Lutkus Editor-in-Chief 
A newly-renovated and com­
pletely air-conditioned South 
Dining Hall opened to stud~nts as 
they returned to compus over the 
Labor Day weekend. The 
renovation, drawn up by Ellerbe 
Architects, is in its final stages as 
workers complete the finishing 
touches. 
The new design completely 
alters the flow of traffic within the 
dining hall. All students are to 
enter the hall by the front doors. 
Directly in front of them as they 
enter are the new doors which lead 
into the pay cafeteria, now named 
,the "Oak Room." I Students then veer off to either 
the left or right, where a wrought­
iron fence will guide them to the 
location of the "checkers." These 
dining hall employees will be 
sitting approximately in the area 
where the old doors to the pay 
cafeteria were located. 
The flow of traffic will lead the 
students down a hallway, which 
used to be the side section·s of the 
pay cafeteria, into the serving area 
in which the old kitchen used to be 
located. 
As the students walk into the 
serving area, in the center of the 
room will be a cart containing 
trays, napkins and silverware. 
Directly in front of that is a stretch 
of serving counters containing six 
areas where students can pick up 
the hot entrees. On either side of 
the serving or scramble room are 
counters which hold the salads, 
fruit, doughnuts and other similar 
As the students exit the serving room, they are confronted with a huge square area which holds the refreshments. In front of them will be the carbonated items, on the two sides of the square to their left or right are the milk dispensers and on the far side of the square are the dispensers for coffee and tea. All of the dispensers are serviced by dining hall employees from within the block. 
The eating areas are much expanded with seating capacity of 904 in each side of the dining hall, yet the tables are spread out to all~viatethe crowding problem in the hall. Also, along the side walls of each hall, the four-seat tables taken from the pay cafeteria offer the student the choice of eating in 
large or small groups. 
According to Bro. Kiernan Ryan, 
assistant vice president for 
business, the conveyor belt system 
for disposal of trays after eating is 
one of the crucial factors in the 
efficient operation of the new 
system. 
Students will no longer have to 
bus trays to the mobile stands in 
the halls. Now, a conveyor belt 
system, running along the wall on 
the kitchen side of each dining 
area, will bring the dirty dishes 
into the washing area. 
Ryan and Edmund T. Price, 
director of food services, urged all 
students who use the facility to bus 
their trays to the belt. If all 
students cooperate, they said, the 
system will be extremely efficient. 
They also requested that students 
who read The Observer during 
their lunch hour, deposit the paper 
in disposal containers after they 
read it instead of leaving the paper 
on their trays. 
Once finished, the students can 
exit the cafeteria by the side doors 
The Scholastic faces budget cut 
by Paul Waller and Paul Szewczyk 
Cuts in the Notre Dame budget have hit the University's bi-weekly magazine, The Scholastic, with an approximate thirty per cent cut in its budget for the 1973-'74 school year. 
SMC govt board 
(continued from page 13) own rules. The situation is unique in each dorm, and sowe're trying to work out judicial reviewing in the halls, rather than in student government, she continued. Three nominations for the ex­pired term of student represen­tative on the Board of Regents, previously held by former SBP Sue Welte are also up before the executive Board of Governance. Seeking the position are McKiernan, Ann Smith, and Mary Ellen Stumpf, Senior class president. 
The Scholastic, the nation's oldest college magazine, financed completely by the Student Ac­tivities Fund, will suffer an overall budget cut of $14,600, including a $13,000 cut in printing costs. 
"I don't know who is responsible for the cuts," stated Kerry McNamara, editor of The Scholastic, but he assumed that it is due to the overall increase in prices everywhere. 
McNamara said that at first there was talk about a cut-back in the number of issues printed. However, the staff soon decided against that proposal, wishing rather to reduce the costs of printing. This could be done by cutting down the number of copies printed each issue and changing the magazine to a more standard size, according to McNamara. 
Despite any cutbacks however, the editors reported that there is no chance of the magazine's folding. "This will just make us more determined," stated McNamara. 
All clubs interested in participating in

or the front doors, both which used to serve the students as entrances. Ryan emphasized that there are "two tremendous pluses" to the new system. "It has increased the seating by 480 in the dining hall and it took· all the serving lines out of the dining room," he said. 
According to Ryan, the kitchen area in the dining hall was "completely gutted" and all new highly-automated equipment wa~ installed. All the commissary items, including the butcher's stop and bakery, have been moved completely to the North Dining Hall. ­
The two men asked for patience on the students part while a traffic pattern is worked out through use of the new facilities. "We need your (the students) cooperation and patience to allow for the necessary changes in traffic patterns and for you (the students) to become accustomed to the new feature new "scramble scramble system of food service," areas" and conveyor belt they said.
