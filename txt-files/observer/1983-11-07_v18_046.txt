In recent months it seems as though the Administration is maneuvering the nation's troops where ever it deems necessary. And yet Congress has not declared war.

N ouwen to lecture on peacemaking 
ByPATSAIN 
SeniorStaffReporter 
Father Henri ). M. Nouwen, for­mer professor of psychology at Notre Dame during the late 1960's, is returning to the University to 1alk on "A Call to Peacemaking." 
Nouwen. who will be speakin:~ in 

the library auditorium on Thursday 
at 8 p.m., will talk about the personal 
and social call to peacemaking ev cry 
Christian experiences. 
"This is not a talk about how the 

United States should make peace in 
Latin America, but about a Chris­
tian's ...call to peace," said Father 
Don Mcneill, Director of the Center 
for Social Concerns. 
McNeill, who invited Nouwen as part of a national "Week of Peace," said Nouwen's understanding of peacemaking comes from an inter­est and concern for society as a whole, and does not exclude politi­cal action. 
"Christ will ask one question ofall people: 'What have you done to the least of mine?"' said Nouwen in an article in the Chicago Catholic. "How are we, as a nation ...going to relate to smaller countries?" 
In the same article, Nouwen said that "the spiritual destiny of North America is intimately connected with the spiritual destiny of South America." In other words, agreed McNeill, one's personal actions can affect society's actions as a whole. 
This is where Nouwen's personal

Nouwen is returning to the Cnited States from a stay in Nicaragua this summer. He had originally planned to go to Peru, said Mcneill, but his experiences in strife-torn Nicaragua compelled him to come back to the ll.S. on a 19-city speaking tour. 
"I had to do anything possible to stop the killing .. .I had to say no more war," Nouwen said in the Chicago Catholic. " ...Something more than political conflict is 
happening there. It is a deeply spiritual crisis that involves both Americas, North and South. It is a crisis that reveals the failure of five centuries of Christianity to bring unity to the Americas," said Nouwen in America. 
Nouwen most recently has been a professor at Harvard University's Divinity School, where he teaches every spring. It was at the end of the last spring semester that he made his trip to Nicaragua, which brought him back to the United States to speak for peace.

for Social Concerns. The deadline is Thursday, November 10. 
"Some people go in and find these wonderful people and develop great relationships with 'grandparent' types ofsenior citizens," said Andrea Shappell, who is one of the class "facilitators." 
The elderly who are visited are aware the students are in a class at Notre Dame, and "are willing and able to communicate," Shappell said. Each student is given two mem­bers of a nursing home to visit. one easy to talk to, and another more ofa challenge, such as those VI ith hearing problems. 
"Many of the senior citizens have 
had visitors from previous classes, 
and understand the goals of the 
course," said Shappell. 

"Sometimes, the realtionship with ·challenging problems is the more rewarding," said Shappell. A relationship with an elderly person that is easy and fun does not always provoke the questions about theol­ogy and community service the course is based upon. 
One of the discussions that inter­ests many seniors in the course is how to end a relationship, said Shap­pell. "'How to say 'goodbye' to 
... Class 
someone you have made friends 
with is a situation many graduating 
seniors face." 

Journals are kept by the students while they visit people in the homes. These journals are used as resource material in class. and to write a major reflection paper at the end of the class. 
Charles Fletchinger. a former senior who took the course last year. said 'Theology should not he is­olated from a person's experience, but deeply concerr:u;d with it. For example, can you actually 'love your neighbor' when he has built a wall around himself?" 
"Students do not use the people to grab three credits," said Shappell. "They go because they care and want to learn." Interviews before registration also help in selecting in­terested students. 
"The actual service becomes tht' framework for the theology studied," said Fletchinger. "llnless we examine love and are loved in return, it remains nothing but an ideal."

Regan is impressed with the inter­
action between Mayor Roger Parent

council has a great deal of power as 
long as its members insist upon 
standing by their opinions. Regan 
was quick to note, however, before 
tomorrow's elections, the mayor

Regan is hoping the ekction will

The losers in the big trade-off 
Newspaper hl_.adlinc~ and economic fi>rccastcrs once again arc proclaiming that hard times will he over soon, as America moves out of the recession. Reagan suppor­tt·rs, both in and out of the administration, are singing the praises of supply side economics and otht·r prcsilkntial policies. 

RandyFahs 
Monday analysis 
The economic picture is not as rosy as we an· being led to hdicvt·, and its benefits arc not being shared by all Americans. Fur­thermore, the policies of Reaganomks may not he the major driving force behind the 
rea!l'('1J'· The administration has had some d­kct on the economy, hut it is difficult to dt·termine the areas and extent of the in· lluenl.T. 

Economic policies involve tradeoffs. The goals of full employment and low inflation have not been achieved at the same time since the beginning of the 1970s. One's economic philosophy determines which of the two is more important. Conservatives tend to fed that low inflation is preferable, while liberals generally support low unemployment. 
Being the conservative Republican he is, Ronald Reagan has supported reduced infla­tion. His monetary policies have contributed to the production ofa 3.9 percent annual rate of inflation for 1982 (down from 13.3 per­
et·nt ). 
This dearly helps those Americans who have a paycheck coming in on a regular basis. Less oftheir wages are being eaten up by infla­tion. But before we pat Reagan on the hack, let's not forget that while inflation was high in 
1979, the unemployment rate was a mere 5.8 percent. Unemployment peaked at 10.8 per­cent in December of 1982, and is still at its highest level since the Great Depression. Car­ter and Reagan had different views on the economic spectrum. Their different ap­proaches can be cited as contributing factors to the trends of the leading economic in­dicators. 
Let's turn for a moment to those who are presently unemployed. They do not ex­perience great benefits from low inflation be­cause the policies which reduce inflation malle it difficult for them to find work. Those people who are unable to find a job face a frustrating, degrading and anxiety-filled road. Unemployment damages a person's outlook on life and destroys personal dignity. 
President Reagan has chosen a tradeoff which causes those at the bottom of the ­employment picture to bear the costs for the remainder of society. In this so-called land of opportunity, it is against our nation's prin­ciples to subject those who are willing to work to the ravages ofunemployment. 
Yes, the economic picture is improving, but 

unemployment is still above nine percent. 
Some economists feel that economic gains 
have come about not because of 
Reaganomics, but because ofthe natural cycle 
which would have come out of the recession 
anyway. In other words, the economic situa­
tion is getting better irrespective of Reagan's 
policies, perhaps even in spite of them. What 
the President has really done is achieve low 
inflation at the expense ofemployment. 
Until we are able to find a way to maintain low inflation and low unemployment, the na­tion will have to find some type of middle ground. To choose high unemployment so that the nation can experience low rates of inflation dooms millions of people to un­employment and its cycle of degradation, frustration and poverry.

Caldicott speech 
Dear Editor: 
Three chn·rs for tht· llniversity of Notre Damt· and American Association of l lniversity Woml·n li>r inviting IIden Caldicott, M.D. to our l·ampus, to share with us thl· "real facts" about till' nuclear arms race. 
Dr. Caldicatt's presentation was gripping and factual. She said that in spite ofhow thing.-; stand at the present moment, we can do some­thing to change them -by voting only for those politkal representatives who oppose the prcSl·nt nuclear arms buildup. 
Each ofus needs to become more informed ahout the nuclear arms issue and more st·nsitivc to the repercussions of our nation's dcdsions. We nt-ed to find out what stance our political n·prcsentatives talle on this issue, vote accordingly, and urge others to do likewise. 

We have a responsibility-to ourselves, to one another, and to our future generation. If we don't accept this responsibility -now ­maybe soon "that's all she wrote."

Grenada decision 
Dear Editor: 

The Richard Cohen column ofNovember I has made it obvious that many in the United 
States  simply  do  not  understand  why  we  
invaded Grenada  
Cohen's  sarcastic  writing  style  not­ 

withstanding, it is clear he feels that American lives were not in danger before the invasion. In fact, nearly I ,000 were in peril due to the overthrow of Maurice Bishop. The new Marx­istleader, General Hudson Austin, instituted a 24-hour shoot-to-kill curfew that was lifted only for a few hours the day before the inva­sion. Even then, American medical students 
could not leave the island as some wished. 
Also, Cuban "construction workers" with suhmachine guns patrolled the streets. Chaos ruled -there was a real threat that Americans would be taken hostage, as in Iran, if Austin panicked. 
The U.S. decision to invade was made primarily to avoid another Iran. One must recall that President Reagan was elected over 
Jimmy  Carter  in  1980  partly  because  of  
increasing American frustration over Iran.  
Cohen's  declaration  that  Americans  in  

Grenada were not in danger, based on com­ments of a man not even in that country, and oblivious of the truth made apparent when the students came home and spoke of their fears, is not only mistallen but also indicative ofirresponsible journalism. 
There is of course another reason for the invasion. The U.S. was asked by Grenada's is­land neighbors to do something, and not be­cause they liked Bishop, but because they disliked and feared Austin much more than they did Bishop. The United States does not 
have a long history ofignoring its all t ies pleas 
for assistance -remember the British in the 
Falklands war? 
In short, Grenada's neighbors did not invite 

us to move into Grenada, as Cohen claims; 
rather, they asked us to do so as would anyone 
living next door to a burning house who, be­
cause of legitimate fears that the fire would 
spread to nearby homes, calls the fire depart­
ment to preclude this possibility by putting 
out the fire. Cohen would certainly not want 
any fire department ignoring sincere calls for 
assistance, would he?

on his own 24. The I 5-yard inter­ference penalty put the Panthers in good field position on their 39. Four plays later, Pitt quarterback John Congemi hit Bill Wallace with a 44­yard touchdown pass after Wallace had turned defender Pat Ballage around, causing him to slip and fall.

The second mistake was a fumble by Pinkett on the Notre Dame's first play after the touchdown and missed conversion. Pitt end AI Wenglikowski knocked the ball loose and Troy Hill recovered to put the Panthers I4 yards away from an­other touchdown. Pitt did not let the opportunity slip away as they used two plays to increase their lead. 
The touchdown came on a I 0­yard run by McCall who was helped greatly by Fralic and Sweeney who blew away the Notre Dame line. It was the two-point conversion that had Irish fans groaning, however, as fullback Mark Bailey took a Congemi pass and went right by two Notre Dame defenders who missed the

tackle. 
Throughout the rest of the game, 
the Irish would threaten to get back 
in the game, but, every time they 
looked like they were about to, they 
would self-destruct. 
Many of the errors were made by 
freshman quarterback Steve Beuer­
lein, who had by far the worst game 
of his short career. Beuerlein threw 
three interceptions, two of them 
coming deep in Pitt territory, 
including one at the goal-line. He 
also panicked and overthrew a wide­
open Joe Howard, costing the Irish 
another touchdown. Much of his 
poor performance (8-of-23, 3 inter­
ceptions) can be chalked up to inex­
perience, but he was also the victim 
ofa number ofdropped passes. 
Blair Kiel came off the bench to 
relieve Beuerlein and performed 
well despite halting another Irish 
drive with an interception. He 
passed for I34 yards on 9-of-I6 pas­
sing. It raised the possibility that Kiel 
could start next Saturday's game 
against Penn State. Faust would 
make no comment, other than he 
would make a decision after looking 
at the game films. 
"I felt that Steve played well," said 
Faust, "but he's a freshman and he 
made some mistakes that hurt us." 
Possibly the key part of the game came late in the third period. The Irish were trailing I4-3, but drove 9own to the Pitt S-yard line and had a second down and four. They could not get any closer, however, as Beuerlein, who had to stand and wait for play calls from the sidelines, was forced to snap the ball quickly in order to avoid delay-of-game penalties. Notre Dame was then forced to settle for a 22-yard Mike 
Johnston field goal. 
With the momentum shifting toward the Irish, Pitt began a crucial series on its 20-yard line. The Pan­thers picked up one first down, but were then forced into a third-and-II situation. Chris J elic, who had replaced an injured Congemi, then found Wallace wide open across the middle. Wallace had broken away from Ballage who was getting picked on all day. 
However, the Irish held and forced a third-and-seven play. fhis time Marlon Mcintyre took a pass in the flat that appeared to be well­covered, but Rick Naylor missed the tackle for one of the few times all game and Mcintyre fell just inches short. Jelic converted on the fourth down, and, two plays later, McCall used a Fralic block to go 3I yards. One play later, McCall scored, leaving the Irish to play catch-up, something they have not had much luck doing. 
The unimpressive showing by the Irish pretty much killed any hopes for a Sugar or Cotton Bowl ap­pearance. But the Fiesta Bowl seems to want Notre Dame very badly and bowl officials were in the locker­room after the game. It would seem that a win over Penn State would be necessary. The promising comeback bodes well for that game, but Irish fans are finally learning not to get too optimistic.

If you have a BSN and are regis tered to practice In the US or Puerto Rico, or you're still a student, talk to an Army Nurse Recruiter. 
It could be a very happy move.
