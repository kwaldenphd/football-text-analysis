The other holiday 
Everyone knows about the national holiday coming up tomor­row. Many are getting ready to don their green beads and green shirts while sharing green drinks and good times. But what I'm really Mike Harkins looking for­ward to is the other national Graphics holiday that happens to land on March 17th this year. 
Okay, maybe it's not a national holiday, but the first day of the NCAA men's basketball tournament is still one of my favorite days of the year. 
So the Irish men are out of the tournament and now out of the NIT. It's painful to think about given the high hopes for the team going into the season, and this week would have been a lot more fun with them participating in the tournament. It'll be alright though, because once the tournament games begin on Thursday, I will be glued to the television from the first tip off at 12:20 p.m. until the final whistle at midnight without having to think about anything else but basketball. 
Well, alright maybe I'll be think­ing a little about that other holiday taking place tomorrow. And I do plan on celebrating the way it is meant to be celebrated. But I have definitely been looking forward to the NCAA Tournament a whole lot longer. 
From now until CBS plays "One Shining Moment" after the final game, basketball will most likely consume the majority of my life. Whether it's reading up on which Cinderella teams have the best chance of pulling an upset, filling out brackets with all the possible outcomes, or highlighting my bracket for the pool that I take part in with a few friends, chances are you would find me doing something tournament-related. 
Fortunately I have worked pretty hard in school so far this semester, knowing I would have to be pre­pared for the inevitable skipped classes and large decline in time spent on homework during March Madness. Of course, as a second semester senior, working hard pretty much means cutting down on playing video games from the average 3-4 hours to about 1-2 hours. 
Anyway, I hope you all are as excited about tomorrow as I am. My schedule tomorrow is as fol­lows: 
8:00 -Wake up. 
8:01 -Crack open a Guinness. 8:02-9:20-Guinness continues. 9:30-12:15-Class (I know it 
sounds bad, but they do allow water bottles in class, right?) 
12:20-5:00 -Watch basketball. 
5:00-7:00-Eat and continue St. Paddy's festivities. 7:00-Midnight-Watch basketball. Midnight-? -Heartland. Now that I think about it, I might 
just have to follow the same sched­ule on Friday.

"As far as I know, brackets are fully legal as long as student-ath­letes aren't involved. I would bet that at least every guys' dorm has one," Tracy said. 
Several women's dorms on campus are also organizing their own tournament pools. 
Cavanaugh vice president Monica Selak said she and fellow dorm officers decided to organize a tournament pool just this week. Participants will be charged $3 to enter, and all the money col­lected will help sponsor a service trip to a needy school in Phoenix, Ariz.

"We were trying to find a cre­ative way to do some sort of social service activity and we fig­ured this would be a great way to raise money," said Selak. 
Every student has a different approach to filling out his or her bracket. Some pick all the favorites, some go for a lot of upsets, some go with their favorite team to win it all, while others are a bit more realistic.

From 1989 to 1997, Gregorian served as the president of Brown University, where he taught freshman and senior history seminars and a course on Alexis de Tocqueville. In addition, he led capital cam­paigns that helped triple the endowment there. 

Prior to that, Gregorian served for eight years as president of the New York Public Library -no small task, considering that this system has four res(larch libraries and 83 circulating libraries. He is credited with pulling the library out of financial crisis. 
Gregorian was born to Armenian parents in Tabriz, Iran. After receiving his ele­mentary education there and his secondary education in Lebanon, he enrolled at Stanford University in 1956. He graduated with honors just two years later. 
In 1964, he earned a doc­torate in history and the humanities, also from 

Stanford. 
Gregorian taught European and Middle Eastern history for eight years at San Francisco State College, the University of California at Los Angeles and the University of Texas. l-Ie then joined the University of Pennsylvania faculty.

ACE teachers-in-training are allotted a stipend of $12,000 per year from the schools in which they teach. In addition, most ACE participants are eli­gible to apply for and receive two annual $4,725 education vouchers through AmeriCorps. 
To qualify, the participant must complete 1,700 hours of service in or outside of the

The court's ruling will allow ACE to continue its service program and especially will help with recruitment of new participants, Staud said. 
"The AmeriCorps awards enable us to recruit broadly for ACE," he said. "Participants tend to be recent college grad­uates who have significant loan indebtedness. The award is well deserved for these par­ticipants who are providing service for the country. 
"It would have been a big disappointment had the ruling gone the other way, making it more challenging to attract students with high debt," he nothing will stop the program. Catholic schools are too needy. We would just have had to been more creative and ener­getic in finding other sources of funding." 
Last week's ruling ensured the future of ACE at a critical time for Catholic schools throughout the country. There are nearly 8,000 Catholic schools in America, but last year only 34 new schools were opened, while more than 100 were closed. 
Within the past few months, the Archdiocese of Chicago announced it is planning on closing 23 schools, and the Brooklyn diocese said it would closed 21 schools in the past two years. 
"Now is a difficult time for Catholic schools nationally," Staud said, "but ACE is com­mitted to serve these schools for decades to come. The chal­lenges are great, and many schools have confided that they would be unable to stay open if it weren't for ACE. However, because we have so many motivated people who are part of the program, we are able to turn them loose on this prob­lem. We're in this for the long haul."

Faculty complaints were scarce, as all departments came tognther to roconfigure their course numbering sys­tems, Templo said. In fact, he noted that many departments welcomed the opportunity to create a new and better iden­tification system. 
"Some departments were running out of unique num­bers to manage their teach­ings. It was a lot of work, but some were excited at the prospect of reconfiguring 
their whole

The first two digits of the new numbers, assigned by the registrar's office, will indicate the level and type of course. Previously, a letter suffix was used to indicate the type of course. 
Each academic department was responsible for assigning the last three digits, using whatever system they pre­ferred.

lied over 100 visits to the region for his cause. 
Kamm 's Tuesday presenta­tion, "Civil Rights, Human Hights: The Struggle for Justice in the United States and China," emphasized the intrinsic parallels between American Civil Rights activi­ty of the 1950s and 1960s and the struggles faced by contemporary Chinese socie­ty. 
The 1972 Princeton gradu­ate explained his human rights career as almost inevitable given the social and historical context of his own coming of age. Kamm listed such events as the Medgar Evers murder, the March on Washington and the Asbury Park riots of the 1970s -which occurred just miles from his childhood 
home  - as incidents which  
shaped  his  eventual  life  
course.  

"I took away the bedrock belief that social change is best achieved through non­violence, even when the cost is high," Kamm said. 
One of the most fundamen­tal comparisons between post-World War II America and 21st century China is that both societies are defined by their immense economic growth and the subsequent widening of the gap between the wealthy and the poo, Kamm said. It is this disparity that spurs frustration and conflict, Kamm said. 
"It is striking to examine the two societies because the profits of nonviolence arise precisely at the time of greatest tension," Kamm said. 
Continuing to link the two movements, Kamm com­pared the likes of American Civil Rights activists Martin Luther King Jr., Halph Abernathy and Hobert Moses to present-day Christian practitioners in China who, although vehemently nonvio­lent, have been detained for political crimes. 

"Both [groups of individu­als! are members of move­ments that seek to awake the conscience of the peo­ple," Kamm said. 

llis own conscience was awakened in May of 1990 when he first took the plunge into human rights activism. Kamm opted to walk away from his career as a successful businessman for a large cooperation in order to advance this cause. In 1999, he established and chaired the Dui .H ua Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to improving human rights in China. 
The Foundation prided itself on its establishment of an elaborate database con­taining names and related information for more than 9,000 political and religious prisoners incarcerated in China. 
Hecently, his meticulous efforts have paid off. Last month, in an iconoclastic move made by Beijing gov­ernment officials, informa­tion on 56 prisoners was ceded to Dui Hua -without prior solicitation. The ges­ture could, Kamm said, present a watershed event in terms of international access to prison records in China. 
The concession of records, as prompted by growing pressures from the interna­tional communHy, draws another significant compari­son to the Civil Hights move­ment, said Kamm. American 
racial policies criticized abroad adversely affected diplomatic relations with other nations and thus spurrnd donwstic social change. 
"International pressure pushed forward the American Civil Bights revo­lution," Kamm said. "I am grateful to those who criti­cized us." 
Despite signil'ieant mile­stones reached by the foun­dation, Kamm and his coworkers realize their work is far from over. In fact, given the current circum­stances of a China marked by rapid economic growth, the time has never been more appropriate to move forward these advancements in human rights, according to Kamm. 
"We should push for more concrete improvements in China because the country is rising so fast," Kamm said. 
According to Kamm, the mindsets of American human rights activists ­and citizens of the US in general -reflect concern over the kind of superpower China will inevitably be: democratic or authoritarian. 
Citing the Civil Rights movement as a large influ­ence in his own approach to the human rights issue in China, Kamm embraces the value of vociferous persever­ance in the name of moral good by continuing to inves­tigate the identities of the innumerable political dissi­dents help captive in the grim penitentiaries of China. 
"We find the names of the lost and forgotten, and we present them to power," Kamm said. "Sometimes lives are changed, even saved."

Experts support arbiter proposal 
Associated Press 
Wi\SIIINGTON -Setting up an independent arbiter of freedom-of-information dis­putes with thn govnrnmnnl would makn appnals for tho release of information morn fair and less expensive, wit­nesses told a Senate panni Tuesday. 
"ll will morn than pay for itself in diverting eases from the courts," Thomas M. Susman. a lawyer spoeializing in Freedom of Information i\r.t cases, told thn Snnate subcom­mittee on terrorism, technolo­gy and homeland sneurity. 
The proposal is part of a bill Congress is considnring that would strengtl11m the 1966 act in part by forcing govnrnrnont ofl'ieials and ageneios to respond morn quickly to requests for information. 
Sponso rod by Sons..loh n Cornyn, H-Texas. and Palriek Leahy, I>-Vt., tho bill would create an ombudsman at the Administrative Confer-enee of the United Stales to review agency compliance with FOil\ requests and recommend alternatives to litigation. 
Currently, disputns aro resolved in court, with the Justice Department defending the agencies. 
Creating a government ol'nee with oversight of the process would go a long way toward correcting the defensive pos­ture of some agnneies toward FOil\ requests, sending tho message from the government that "we are serious about open government require­ments," KathPrine M. Cary, division chief of the Open Hecords Division of the Texas Attorney General's Office, told the panel. 
"FOil\ isn't a game of us ver­sus. them," Susman said. 
The bill. sponsornd in thn llouse by Hep. Lamar Smith. H-Texas, would r-equire agen­cies lo give people seeking documents a tr-acking nurnbnr within 10 days and to sol up tnlephorHl or lntnrrrnt systems allowing them to learn the sta­tus and estimatml eomplntion date. 
i\geneios that didn't respond within 20 days would losn all exemptions to FOil\ requests except for national sncurity, personal privacy, proprintary information or a ban in anoth­er Jaw. 
The open govnrnnwnt issue took on nnw weight al'tor-thn Sept. 1 I, 2001, attacks when the Bush administration sot a higher threshold for· FOil\ dis­closurns. The While llousn advisnd agencies to make sure the information they rnleast>d would not joopardizn national seeurity. 
But media outlets and othnrs say that "national security" has become too common a reason for withholding infor­mation. 
Walter Mears. a retired Associated Prnss newsman, told the subeommittee that thn more information the govern­ment tries to keep secret, the greater tho chance that. what should be withheld will be leaked.

Mass. governor lVants turnpike chairman out 
Associated Press 
BOSTON -Gov. Mitt Romney asked the state's highest court Tuesday if he has the power to fire the Massachusetts turnpike chairman after an· engineer who led an investigation into leaks at the $14.6 billion Big Dig project says he can no longer vouch for the safety ofits tunnels. 
"With the Big Dig there's been a pattern of cover-up· and stonewalling that has left the pub­lic with little confidence that the project is being managed well or that the road and tunnel system are safe to travel," Homney said. 
But he stopped short of calling the tunnels unsafe and said he will continue to drive through them. 
The governor's comments came in response to a March 9 letter written to the Turnpike Authority by engineering specialist Jack K. Lemley, who said he was "unable to express an opinion as to the safety of the 1-93 portion of the Central Artery." 

Bill redirects license plate profits 
State political parties stand to lose hundreds of thousands ofdollars 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -When Indiana drivers spend $48 for personalized license plates, $30 is sent to political parties, a vestige of a time decades ago when the parties ran the Bureau of Motor Vehicles. 
But a bill that a House com­mittee unanimously advanced Tuesday would take the nearly $1.4 million split between Hepublicans and Democrats and give it to the BMV. 
Hepublicans said the money should be used to help upgrade license branches. BMV Commissioner Joel Silverman said the money could also be used for security or to keep up with increasing costs. 

"We need to upgrade our license branches," said Hep. Cleo Duncan. H-Greensburg. 
But Democrats said the money should go back to cus­tomers who probably would not want to donate an extra $30 to help upgrade the branches. 
"If we were to ask the people, I'd bet they'd want their money back," said Rep. Carotene Mays, D-Indianapolis. 
"It just looks like it's a slush fund being created for the BMV," said Rep. Terry Goodin, D-Crothersville. 
The only person to speak against the bill was John Livengood, former Indiana Democratic Party chairman. He said the money has helped fund a healthy two-party system in the state and that he realizes where the money goes when he buys his two personalized plates.

Army platoon leader penalized for assault 
Lieutenant sentenced to 45 days in prison 
Associated Press 
FORT HOOD, Texas-An Army platoon leader was sentenced niesday to 45 days in a military prison for his role in forcing three Iraqi civilians into the Tigris !liver. 
Army 1st Lt. Jack Saville also must forfeit $2,000 of his military salary each month for six months, military judge Col. Theodore Dixon ruled. 
Prosecutors had recommended Saville, who chose a nonjury trial, be discharged from the Army. 
"I hope to use these experi­ences for greater good," Saville, a 25-year-old West Point graduate, read from a statement. 
Saville pleaded guilty Monday to assault and other crimes for forcing two curfew violators into the river at gunpoint in January 2004 near Samarra. One of the men allegedly drowned. 
Saville was convicted Tuesday of a lesser assault charge for 
Friday, March @9:00pm 

Limit ofJj participants 

doing nothing to stop another Iraqi man from being foreed into the river near Balad in December 2003. 
The charges carried a maxi­mum 9 lfl-year sentence though a plea deal eapped the sentence at 15 months; that part of the agreement was kept secret so the judge would not be influenced, Army official<; said. 
During sentencing Tuesday, Saville apologized, saying his poor decisions "adversely affected U.S.­Iraqi trust during critical times of reconstruction." He said he has learned from his mistakes and has been forgiven by God. 
Earlier Tuesday, former soldier Terry Bowman testified that before the Balad incident, Saville laughed and said it was part of a bet with another platoon over who would do such a thing first. The actual orders, however, were given by Saville's co-defendant, Staff Sgt. Traey Perkins.

The magic of forgiveness 
I had one of those "don't put it off till tomorrow" moments last week. My father called last Thursday and told me that my grandmother (his mother) would probably not live much longer. "She won't recognize you or even know Kate Barrett you're there," he told me, "but if you want FaitlzPoint to come for yourself, you should." 
I went the next day, on Friday, and she died on Saturday, at 92. My dad was right; she didn't recognize me, and I doubt she knew I was there, even though she did blink a little at one point when I prayed a Hail Mary right in her ear. I did go for myself, and it's a day I won't forget, in part because I sat with my grandmother on the day before she died, but mostly because I got to sit there with my dad. 
My grandmother, I should note, was a complex and difficult woman. We never seemed to please her quite enough, though I think that may have been .the only way she knew how to love us-believing us to have the potential for just a bit more than what we were showing her. As it turned out, her own life never seemed to please her quite well enough either, even if to others it would appear she and my grandfather had achieved every mate­rial success. After my grandfather's death, she became more and more adept at re-inventing her own life story, adding more imagined money, travel and prestige every time she told a new audience her constantly-improv­ing autobiography. 
My mom and dad had cared for her for the last 15 years, since my grandfa­ther's death, guiding her from a rela­tively independent life through the gradual loss of her abilities and her freedom into the world of the nursing home. She did not make these changes gracefully or willingly, and my dad, an

only child, bore the brunt of her ongo­ing anger, frustration and loneliness. 
Over the course of about three quiet hours, I sat with my dad last Friday in her room. If it's true that we learn how to take care of our own ailing parents by watching the way they took care of theirs, then I have learned how 
reconciliation in his ongoing pil­grimages, and especially, I think, in his prayer and belief that God's grace worked through what must have seemed at times too heavy a burden. 
My grandmother grew up during a time in our Church when faith was driven in part by fear -fear of some­how not fulfilling the obligations a demanding and punitive God seemed to have imposed. She carried that understanding of her faith into adult­hood. My dad and I wondered togetHer as we sat whether she was somehow afraid to die. Did she worry that she hadn't quite gotten it right somehow? That God waited for her with a list of the shortcomings she had accumulated and hadn't yet "erased" with her mul­titudes of daily Masses and rosaries? 
God graced my dad with the gift of forgiveness in his journey through my grandmother's last 15 years, trans­forming his pain into compassion for her and into hope and prayers for her 
healing and peace. Sometimes ­

We again approach Holy Week, our holiest week. Again we can gratefully · approach the Lord who loves us, who forgives us, and who offers us the abil­ity, with his grace, to forgive each other in his name.

The credentials generation 
It is ollicial. Spring brnak has eome to a dosn, and from somewhere deep within the eolloelivo wnarinoss of the campus mind, synapsns, long dormant, are begin­ning to lim. Ttwrn is a growing tnnsion about somo people, nven

I done right? What of the choiees that I made when I did not realize that they were lasting choieos? 1\nd more over, how I am expected to make any choices at all, when I am still not even sure what it is that I want out of life? 
I am not alone. We have become what some eall th() credentials generation. The perl1et internship; the right mix of study, service, and work; law schools; MeATs; the perfect job; a power resume; a promotion; those key contacts; and do not forget the Notre Dame diploma. All of these are ground together and sifted over our heads in the hope that we might linally locate the eredentials that will complete us as per­sons. They lbcus our minds on the present, and shield us from the uncertainties in our futur-os and in ourselves. 
But in truth, a diploma just labels rne as an ex-studont. And no amount of creden­tials will evnr protect or eonsole me from weariness or pain. For, if I am honest with myself, I know that none of these things will ever give me any sort of happiness. and it is this truth that I lear most of all. 
That is wally the essence of the problem. Does a career, a diploma, have anything at all to do with my happiness? What have I thrown away liw the sake of that career,

Day o' St. Pat on the way 
I enjoyed Black llisl.ory Month so much I thought Fnbruary's lessons should bn applind to March's Irish wondor-St. Patrick. I >id you know ho WlL<; kidnappnd in Grnat Britain and r11lomtnd to Jr·nlaml1L<; a slavo Joe Dowglallo l(u· six years?

Sinen Black llistory Month challenged us to per­potually cdebrato history and her­iutgP, wn ought to rnvernntly reflect upon tho sihrnifkance of St. Patrick and his day. 
Tho Irish-American and 1\frican­!\nwrican dilemma is finding a con­IW<:tion with the cui turn of a land soparatnd by the Atlantic Oenan and a progmssion of ynars. Black llistory Month is fillnd with nwnr­onee-an attribute many Irish 1\nwrkans f(mr is abstmt in the cele­bration of St. Patrick. I have an easi­or tinw l<tking HooL<;' Kunt.a Kinte soriously tlmn I do a leprechaun, fi>r oxamplo. Thn enlnbration of Martin Luther !<ing .Jr. allows some to say, "I'm going honwliJr the thrnn-day wnnkend, and my extended fiunily is eoming to visit." 
Whnn Marrh 17 rolls around, some say, ''I'm going straight lhr tho chirk not wnaring grnnn when I set fi>ol in It J. Bnnlley's." It's salil to say St. Patrick has bmm passnd over more limns than "llotnl Hwanda's" I>on Chmtdlo lin· Bnst Actor-two (Tinws in nnml of' anwnds.

Scholar Thomas Cahill adds, "The 
papacy did not condemn slavery as 
immoral until tho end of the 19th 
century. but here i'i Patrick in the

Ireland takes ~:,rreat pride in these

treated with a mixed reception, ulti­
mately mixed co1:ktails. 
I would be lying if I dairned I did not enjoy tlm testivitins associated with St. Patrick's Day. The stigma of the day being a drunken celebration of debauchnry has a special appeal to my college appetite. The 1\nwriean attitude toward the Irish has improved sinee the New York City of tho 1 SOOs and the slogan. "No Irish Need Apply." Drinking was stereotyped to make people believe ali Irish descendant<; were irrespon­sible employees. 
!laving progressed since then, the United States recognizes the poten­tial fi1r a person of any background to become an aleoholic and be irre­sponsible. It's eute (and a lot of fun) for people to express this unity in the expodnd dnstruetive behavior of Mareh 17. It's just rather appalling it geL'> done in the name of a saint, the irony ofwhieh makes the occa­sion all the more enjoyable to defamers. Perhaps 1\merieans just need a day ofalcoholic indulgence, 
just like llalloween is for candy

and what willllose forever if I continue down this road? Maybe my happiness was among those things that I saerifieed. I worry that I have sold out to someone else's ideal, someone else's truth. and someone else's happi­ness. Maybe I should have been a farmer, like my great-~:,rrandfather, or a teacher like his father­in-law. Maybe I should have followed my friends to DaLian, or Ouagadougou. or to a Chilean snminary. 
I am envious of those with a greater sfmse of purpose than I, those who ean become doctors (and dentists), teach­ers, preachers and scholars out of a sense of duty and love. I am not surn if there is even a god of computer program­mers. or whether all that we do is just human contrivance, politics and business. Perhaps fol­lowing this path will just inevitably take 


me farther and farther away from whnt it is that I truly need and want. None of this thinking pul<; a stop to grad­uation of course, nor should it. But it does give it a sense of greater 
urgency and of deepnr impor­tance. I have many diflkult choices to make, as do all the mombnrs of' the ere­

And so it is with great frustration that I write this letlill', for I am still in disbeliefthat this one place !loved so much has let me down so ofl.en. The graduating elass of 2005 has arguably gone through four ofthe worst years at Notre Dame. We have seen the alcohol policy changed simply for publicity sake, tho dorms we loved so much had their greatest traditions ripped away (SYHs and the like). tuition has increased at an alarming rate, seniors have been kicked out oflbot­ball games for throwing marshmallows, tailgating has been destroyed as we know it ... tl1e list goes on and on. Lot's face it, we are tho first elass to go through Notre Dame's new "No Fun Policy." The bottom line is that the University couldn't care less about how their actions aftect student life. 1\nd up until now. I've been able to deal with it. 
Ilowevnr, when I mad in yestnrday's papnr that tho golden dome, tim symbol oftl1is school, w~L" going to bo hidden by st:afli>lds during our gradua­tion, that was the la'it straw. Some ofyou may dis­agree with my earlier eomplainl'i, but this one is fi1lt by all ofus. You'rn telling me that tl1is prndous regilding can't be done between May 16 and September? 1\re you, the University. seriously going to daim that thnrn aron't 1mough "dry and wind­less" days between tl10se two datns? Bemuse Umt would be absurd. Something must bn done about this. I just w~mt to say tlumks, adminL'itration. Thank.;; for dnstroying our ability to utke h'l"<mt fi.uni­ly pictures on onn ofthnmost important days of our lives. Thanks for not caring about thn student body ag~\in. Thank.c; for nothing.

Consider it Christian 
I enjoyed reading the piece entitled "Can you afford to be a Liberal?" by Sarah MacMillen. Having lived in South Bend, I can attest to the cost of trying to live in consideration of others. It puz­zles me that many !bod chains drastieally raise the prices on organic and traditionally farmed foods to fool the consumer into believing that sustenance farming is more expensive, when in many ca.c;;es, it is just the opposite. 
How is it that in Los Angelos, arguably one of the most expensivo places to live in the United States, I can lind organic or traditionally farmed foods for cheap? Indiana is practically Amoriea's breadbasket, and yet I cannot ever rnmember see­ing a farmer's market advertisnd in Soutl1 Bond, or seeing anything organic or traditionally farmed under the price of livn dollars. I go to the Brentwood Farmer's Market and buy an entire sack of fresh vegetables and eggs that am organic or traditionally farmed for those same live dollars. I can also go to the Santa Monica or Beverly I Iills Farmer's Market and do just as well tl1ere. 
The mere faet that this artide was equated to living as a "liberal" (l see the categorization of people still persists undor the Dome) tells me sometl1ing. Are tl1e people or the Midwest so con­servative that they no longer support the old adages of farming'? When was it "un-eool" to mill about the fresh wares of the farming community on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon? I buy my chicken and eggs from a family at the Brentwood Farmer's Market every Sunday afternoon .. Even 
though it takes an extra two or three minutes of 
my time, I like hearing their son tell me how he is now old enough to harvest the oggs without his mother's supervi'iion. 
The fact that I buy organic or traditionally farmod foods, in my eyes, makes me very t:onser­vative. I support those who lhrm in ways that enrieh God's earth, rathor th<m hurt it. I support the littlest guy out there -tho singln liunily farmer. I support those who know no otlwr way of life but farming. I like soeing the boy at tho market smiling at me, as opposed to seeing the smilny faco ofWalmart inliltrating my living room nvnry evening. And I have to say that buying my fi1od while ba<;king in Uw sunlight sum bnaL<; shopping under tho cold hum of fluornscont lighting.

Famous tenor brings true Irish feeling to St. Patrick's Day 
Self-taught singer Ronan Tynan has risen above challenges to become an inspirational and world-famous performer 

J 
ust in time for St. Patrick's Day, the world-renowned Irish tenor Ronan Tynan will perform in the Leighton Concert Hall at the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center Thursday, March 17. The concert also features perform­ances from guests Vince Gill and the Notre Dame Glee Club. 
The majority of today's classically trained musicians hone their crafts through their collegiate experience, but the County Kilkenny native's voice has gained reputation as a natural talent. He broke into singing at the age of thirty­three and after less than a year of train­ing, won the top prize in the BBC talent show "Go For It" (a predecessor to "Pop Idol" and "American Idol" in the UK and the United States, respectively). The instant success led to his association with the "Irish Tenors" trio, along with John McDermott and Anthony Kearns. 

Tynan left the group last year to pursue soloist opportunities and has since essen­tiality made himself a household name in the United States -as well as endeared himself greatly to New York City. Sports fans undoubtedly recall his 7th inning renditions of "God Bless America" at Yankee Stadium and perhaps also his singing "New York, New York" at the 2004 Belmont Stakes. Tynan also devoted much time to funerals and memorials centering around Sept. 11, 2001, along­side such people as Bono, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Billy Crystal, Barbara Bush and Regis Philbin. 
The tenor was also the only soloist for the funeral of former President Ronald Reagan, a request personally made by Nancy Reagan. 
Tynan was born with a lower limb dis­ability and ended up a double amputee at age 20. Even so, he had a steadfast and strong personality, and he committed himself to becoming an athlete, eventual­ly winning a total of 18 gold medals in the Paralympics and setting world records in the long jump, shot put and discus. He also earned a degree as a medical doctor from Ireland's Trinity College. 
The performance at Notre Dame kicks off a U.S. tour for Tynan. The tour is in conjunction with the recent release of his self-titled CD, featuring classic inspira­tions such as "How Great Thou Art" and "Amazing Grace," as well as popular tunes such as "Man of La Mancha" and "From a Distance." Tynan also wrote one of the songs -"Passing Through," a trib­ute to his mother who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. While doing much work in popular and Irish folk music, Tynan has also made his operatic debut as Pinkerton in Puccini's "Madama Butterfly" and has performed soloist roles in Verdi's "Requiem," Rossini's "Stabat Mater" and Puccini's "Messa di Gloria." 
The concert begins at 8 p.m. Tickets are $75 preferred seating, $50 for the general public, $40 for Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and Holy Cross faculty and staff, $37.50 for senior citizens and $20 for all students.

In sharp contrast to the firestorm over the original film, the new version of' "The Passion" arrived quietly, with little fanfare. The fact that the original is available on DVD limited theatrical prospeets for the recut edition.

path to home video. 
Timed to coincide with the smash suc­cess of "The lnerodiblns," Warner Bros. has rnissuod a new special edition of "The Iron Giant," complete with a host of nnw special features and a nnw digi­tal video transfer. Thn new DVD linally dnlivnrs justice to tho film and pays homage to Bircl's ereativo brilliance.

While alone in the house at night, llogarth discovers the Iron Giant (voiced by Yin Diesel) in his own baekyard ­the thick woods of Maine. Befriending the innocent alien robot, he elicits t.he help of a friendly junkyard operator, Dean (voiced by Harry Connick .Jr.) in hiding the 50-foot-tall giant from Kent Mansley (voiced by Christopher McDonald), a paranoid government agent. 
Hiding behind the veneer of an inno­cent children's tale, "The Iron Giant" is populated by very real characters, as human as any seen in live-action fea­ture films. Although it cleverly uses the 11J50s Cold War setting as a backdrop to show­ease that period's mass paranoia, its message can easily be applied to the 21st century. Hussian spies and atomic holo­caust can easily be sub­stitutod for foreign ·ter­rorist threats and nuclear warfare. The lilm's lessons are simple but at. the same time 
"We certainly had higher nxpecta­tions than what we got," said Hob Schwartz, head of' distribution for Newmarket Films, which released "The Passion of' the Christ" and t.he nnw cut. "We wnrc trying to get thn f'ilm out thorn hoping it would reach an audi­ence that it didn't reach the first time around. It doesn't seem to have worked out quite as well as we had hoped." 
Newmarket executives hopn more movin-goers will turn out as Easter approaehes, Schwartz said. 
"Hobots," featuring the voices of' Ewan McGregor, llalle Berry, Hobin 
Williams and Mel Brooks, is the second 1'1~ature-length eartoon tale from "lee Age" directors Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha. The movie tracks the adventures of an ideal­istic robot inventor who moves to the big city. 
While "Robots" did not enter theaters with the profile of "Shrek 2" 
and "The lncredibles," which opened to sky-high numbers, it had been expected to rival the opening weekends for 2002's "Ice Age" and last year's "Shark Tale." 
Rut competing with "The Pacifier," "Robots" fell about $10 million short of both those debuts. 
"Those other movies didn't have any­thing that was working the families with this strength, so I am very, very pleased," said Bruce Snyder, head of firmly based in reality, rising above the conventions of the average Disney ani­mated fare. 
But the l'ilm's foundation is still set firmly upon the touching friendship between Hogarth and the Iron Giant and. Although the Giant appears to be quite benevolent and altogether harm less, thern are still hints at its more sin­ister origins. Hogarth refuses to ques­tion the Giant's past, prefnrring instead to teach his new 50-foot pal the joys of comic books, television and cannon­balling into a local lake. Through it all, Hogarth reminds the Giant that he always has a choice -to be the heroic Superman everyone adores or the arch­villain everyone fears. 
The special edition DVD features an oxcellent new digital vi~eo transf1~r as well as a solid surround-sound audio track. The video transfer highlights the film's vivid color palette and is quito striking. 
The real heart of the special edition lies in the wealth of special features. These features inelude an audio eom­mnntary with key mnmbnrs of the ern­ative team (induding Bird himself), 1X minutns of deleted scenes and several short foaturcttes on the production, design and voiefl talent in the film. These features provide a penk at the amount of love that went into making this project, and there is nary a regrnt to be found for the film's dismal box office returns.

NCAA TOURNAMENT 


Oakland gets 64th berth in first tourney win 
Associated Press 
DAYTON, Ohio-It took eight years in Division I for Oakland to get its first win in the NCAA tournament. 
As a reward, the Golden Grizzlies get to play top-seeded North Carolina -in Charlotte, no less. 
Oakland broke open a tight game behind Rawle Marshall's 29 points and Cortney Scott's 21 to beat Alabama A&M 79-69 Tuesday night in the opening round of the NCAA tournament at the University of Dayton. 
"There can't be too many col­leges who can say they won a game in the NCAA tourna­ment," a grinning Marshall said. "We'll ride this momentum and see how far it takes us." 
The Golden Grizzlies (13-18) won their sixth game in a row, including three upsets in as many days last week by a com­bined seven points to take the Mid-Continent Conference title, giving them a berth in the field of65. 
"If we win the national cham­pionship, we'll finally get to 19­18," coach Greg Kampe said with a laugh. 
Now they get to play the mighty Tar Heels on their home turf. 
"To play against some of the No. 1 players in the nation ­it'll be great to put your talent up against them and see where you stand," Scott said. 
Oakland became only the fifth team with a losing record to win an NCAA tournament game, following Bradley in 1955 and the last three years at the Dayton opening round: Siena in 2002, UNC-Asheville in 2003 and Florida A&M a year ago. 
"There was a whole lot of adversity during the season," said Brandon Cassise, who chipped in with 13 points. "It brought us together. That's why we've played so well in these do-or-die games." 
Obie Trotter scored 24 points and Joseph Martin added 22 for Alabama A&M (18-14), regular­season and tournament champs of the Southwestern Athletic Conference. 
Both teams were making their first appearance in the NCAA tournament. Oakland made the jump from Division II to Division I in the 1997-98 sea­son. 
As the Golden Grizzlies stretched the lead to 21 points with 5 minutes left, the embold­ened Oakland student section began chanting, "We want Tar Heels! We want Tar Heels!" 
The turnaround is almost incomprehensible for a team that was 7-18 and riding a three-game skid just 18 days earlier. Almost as incredible, Oakland opened the season 0-7, losing by an average of 13 points a game against a who's who of powerhouses: Illinois, Marquette, Xavier, Missouri, Texas A&M, Kansas State and Saint Louis. 
Marshall, a wiry, 6-foot-7 sen­ior swingman expected to be taken in the NBA draft this spring, was the focal point for the Golden Grizzlies most of the night. 
He was 9-of-16 from the field, including 3-for-4 on 3-pointers and 8-of-11 in free throws, to go with nine rebounds and three assists. 
Marshall's most dramatic play came in the opening half. He took a pass on the right elbow, pump-faked a defender off his feet and then sliced through the lane for a soaring dunk and a foul. A crowd of 8,254 roared its approval. 
Ahead 38-35 at the break, Oakland scored 16 of the first 18 points in the second half. 
Patrick McCloskey, who had sleepwalked through the first half with no points and two rebounds in 12 minutes, led the surge with five points, five rebounds and a blocked shot. The 260-pound Scott, a transfer from Iowa, added four points on two twisting inside moves, Cassise <:arne off the bench for two baskets and Marshall hit a 3-pointer. 
"It took us a while to learn how to play against their speed," Kampe said. "We com­pletely controlled the tempo the rest of the game." 
The Rochester, Mich., school with an enrollment of 16,500 pushed the lead to 54-37 and the lead never dropped below double digits. 
"This is surreal," Cassise said. "I can't believe it's all happen­ing." 
Scott built his 21 points on 9­of-14 shooting and added eight rebounds and McCloskey had 11 rebounds as the Golden Grizzlies took a 43-29 edge on the boards. 
A&M coach L. Vann Pettaway said his team was worn out from playing four games in six days, winning the conference tournament on Sunday before hitting the road less than 24 hours later to make it to Dayton.

The Washington R1~dskins made the first overtures to Courtney Brown, with coach Joe Gibbs flying to Cleveland on Tuesday to try to woo the one­time top draft pick who was cut by the Browns the previous day. 
Within hours after Brown's release, Gibbs and defensive line eoach Greg Blache had din­ner with the oft-injured defen­sive end and his wife. 
Cleveland has said it would like to re-sign the No. 1 pick in the 2000 draft, who was released a day before he was due a $2.5 million roster bonus. If Brown were to join the Hedskins, he would be reunited with his Penn State teammate, linebacker LaVar Arrington, who was taken with the second overall pick that year and also has been plagued by injuries. 
If Washington acquires Brown, the team will have the top three picks from that draft: Brown, Arrington and tackle Chris Samuels. 
In another development Tuesday, Minnesota signed widn receiver Travis Taylor, a disap­pointment with Baltimore after being taken 1Oth overall in 2000. It probably put an end to any chance Plaxico Burress will end up with the Vikings, one of the few teams that had some interest in the player thought to be the most sought rncnivnr in fren agnncy. 
Pro Bowl left tackle Orlando Pace wrapped up a two-day visit with the llouston Texans, the first step of a process that could eventually lead to a trade with St. Louis. 
"We've had contaet with tho Hams and we brought the play­er in for a visit," Texans general manager Charley Cass1~rly said. "That's all I'm going to say for now." 
St. Louis faces a 4 p.m. EST Wednesday deadline to re-sign Pace. "After that, under NFL rules tho Hams wouldn't be allowed to strike a deal with him until July 15. 
With most of the top players in froe agency already signed, there were some lesser contract agreements Tuesday. 
Tight end Anthony Becht, a late first-round pick in 2000, signed with Tampa Bay, leaving the New York .Jets. The Bues are hoping his blocking helps their run game.

Indianapolis considers building nevv stadiun1 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -Lawmakers started over Tuesday in their work to find the money for a new Indianapolis Colts stadium after several proposals failed during the first half of the legislative ses­sion. 
A Senate committee listened to city ollicials and Colts coach Tony Dungy speak about the benefits of a new stadium and expanded convention center, but most sena­tors already seemed supportive of the project-at least in theory. 
Senate Tax Committee Chairman Luke Kenley, H­Noblesville, said while the idea of a new stadium had broad sup­port, funding will be tricky in a tight budget year. 
The proposed 63,000-seat retractable roof stadium to replaee the RCA Dome is project­ed to cost between $550 million and $700 million. 
"We all want to do it," Kenley said. "Now we need to see who will pay." 
The lobbying effort for the new stadium included NFL commis­sioner Paul Tagliabue, who met with Gov. Mitch Daniels in the afternoon and was to attend an evening reception for lnhrislators. 
"I think the need is elear," Tagliabue told reporters after meeting with the governor. "And I think the opportunity is a good one." Several NFL cities have formed public-privatn partner­ships to build new stadiums, Tagliabue noted. 
"It's a mixturP of publi1~ and private funding -it's a public and private asset," he said. 
Kenley and other members of the Senate have their chanc1~ to make a funding plan on which the state, city and team can agree. Several House bills to finance the stadium died in thn first half of the legislative session, although the legislation eould bn revived by adding them to other bills. 
"We're kind of in the third quarter of this game and we're running out of timeouL'i," Kenley said. 
House Speaker Brian Bosma, H-lndianapolis, said some law­makers met Monday with Colts owner .Jim lrsay to discuss the project. A group of city ollicials, Coll'i representatives and Senate and House members planned to start work on a new funding plan, starting with a meeting Wednesday. Bosma said llousn Hepublicans in the group want to make sure the stadium money comes from balanced sources, including the city and the team. He also said lawmakers wanted to look at the stadium ahrremnent Indianapolis Mayor Bart Peterson reached with the Colts to see whether it is fair. 
"There are still a lot of discus­sions that need to happen," Bosma said. 
Fred Glass, prnsidenl of the Indianapolis Capital lmpro­vmnnnt Board. which oversnes the HCA Dome and the adjoining convention cenll~r. said Tagliabue's visit eould bring per­sperliVP about how otlwr stadi­ums have bel'n eonstruetPd using NFL loans.

School officials were consider­ing whether to cancel practice this week, with hopes that Gailey would be well enough to resume at least some of his duties after the break.

MEN'S TENNIS 

Irish stay busy, notch victories over break 
By RAMA GOTTUMUKKALA 
Sports Writer 
Spring break is usually a time to catch some sunshine and much-needed rest and relax­ation. The Irish men's tennis team found both of the latter rare during the past ten days. But they did catch plenty of sun in several contested outdoor matches. 
Transitioning to outdoor play for the first time this spring, No. 18 Notre Dame (13-4) competed in four dual-matches and sent four doubles teams to compete in the prestigious Pacific Coast Doubles Championships. The Irish won three matches against St. Joseph's (3-5), No. 68 William and Mary (4-10) and No. 27 Rice (9-4). Their only loss came to No. 55 Boise State (15-5) in the BluB-Gray National Tennis Classic. 

In their first outdoor match of the season, Notre Dame easily rolled past St. Joseph's in a 7-0 decision. The· two doubles points were closely contested, but the Irish had no problems in singles play. In a match that heavily favored the Irish, the team collectively dropped just 20 total games in the vietory. 

The rest of the team's match­es during break were not quite as easy. Competing in the Blue­Gray National Tennis Classic, Notre Dame won their first round match against William and Mary in a close 4-3 deci­sion. 
Placed as the second overall seed for the event, the Irish came out strong against William and Mary on March 10. Winning both doubles matches and getting victories in the first two singles contests, the Irish jumped out to an early 3-0 lead. But William and Mary won three straight three-set victories to close the gap. Sophomore Barry King beat Colin O'Brien 3-6. ()-1, 6-1 in the linal match on court to seal thn victory for Notre Dame. 
Unfortunately, the Irish came up just short the following day against Boise State, dropping a 4-3 decision. The match lasted more than four hours and fea­tured five three-set singles matches. Winds of greater than 20 miles per hour added prob­lems for both teams in the marathon match. 
Although the Irish fell behind 3-1 early, King keyed a come­back by posting a 7-6, 2-6, 6-1 victory over Matias Silva at the No. 3 slot. Victories from Stephen Bass and junior Eric Langenkamp helped notch the score at 3-3 before the decisive last singles match. 
Boise State Senior Ikaika .lobe topped Irish freshman Sheeva Parbh u with a 3-6, 7-6, 6-3 vic­tory that gave the Broncos the win. 
The down-to-the-wire drama didn't stop there for the Irish. Saturday, Notre Dame's match against Hice again came down to a hotly contested 4-3 vietory. This time, the Irish dinched the all-important fourth point. 
Again playing the final match on court, King clinched the match for the Irish with a 6-3, 6-7, 6-1 vietory over Hice's Ben llarknett. The Irish fell behind 2-0 to the Owls early, but a 6-1, 6-3 victory by Parbhu keyed the Irish comeback. 
Among a talented pool of competitors, Notre Dame also played well at the Paeilk Coast Doubles Championships, advancing three of tiHlir four duos to thn round of 32 in the 128-tnam draw. 
The doubles team of Langenkamp and Parbhu advanced to the final 16 before losing to Pepperdine's No. 1 team. Bass and King beat the Texas A&M team of Matt Bain and Yevgeny Supeko 4-6, 6-4, 7­5 in their opening round match and then upset UCLA's No. 3 team of Chris Lam and Philipp Gruendler 6-3, 4-6, 1-0 ( 1 0-6). The duo's run was ended in the round of 32 by Rice's No. 2 team, Konstantin Haerle and

NEW YORK -.Jason Giambi was excusP.d from tnstifying at Thursday's eongrnssional hearing on st.nroids in baseball, and tho top l>nm<HT<tt on the comrnittne said it's possi­hln other players also could have subpoenas withdrawn. 
(;iambi dons not have to go to Washington because of his involvement in the ongoing federal investiga­tion into illegal steroid dis­tribution, llouse Govern­ment Reform committee chairman Hep. Tom Davis and ranking Democrat Hnp. llnnry Waxman said Tuesday. The New York Yankees slugger testified

"I appPanHI in front of tho fndnral grand jury a ynar ago. I answnrcd nvnry question, told thn truth and eoopnratnd fully," Giambi said in a statnmnnt released by his agent. "I appreeial.n that the mem­bers of the committee evaluated my situation. and I will now continue to focus on playing the best baseball I possibly can for the Yankees and our grnat fans." 
BAI.CO founder Victor Conte, BALCO vice presi­dent James Valente, Barry Bonds' trainer Greg An­derson, and track coach Hemi Korchemny were 

indicted in the case, and trial dates have not ynt bonn sdwdulnd.

undergo surgery, but it was unlikely that team physicians would clear him to play any­way. 
Ryan was heading into his senior season and would likely have been the top reserve offensive lineman on the depth chart. The 6-foot-5 senior from Tamaqua, Pa. has had a pro­ductive but injury-filled career at Notre Dame. 

As a sophomore, Ryan started three games, logging over 120 minutes of playing time. 
However, knee injuries in 2004 mostly kept him off the field for all but 10 minutes, 24 seconds. 
The back condition -a degenerative disk problem ­will allow Ryan to pursue other interests in football. 
He has said that he would like to stay involved in some way with the Irish and eventu­ally go into coaching. 
Giles' case is much different. 

The senior had only started one game in his career for the Irish, and the South Bend Tribune reported his departure is rooted in Giles' desire to play, according to his former high school football coach Lou Silva. 
"I haven't talked to Zach, but according to some of his good friends it's a done deal. "He just wants to play football," Silva told the South Bend Tribune. 
The center played in place of the injured Bob Morton at times in 2003, including the entire second half of the Boston College game and the fourth quarter against Florida State. 
Giles will join a Northeastern team that finished 5-6 overall and 4-4 in the Atlantic 10 con­ference. 

Giles is a native of Marshfield, Mass., 30 minutes away from the Northeastern campus. 
Aside from the loss of Ryan and Giles, Notre Dame retains all five of its starting linemen this year -including tackle Hyan Harris, who won the team award for top offensive lineman as a sophomore in 2004.

son ends. 
This is a dream come true," said Owens. "I remember when I was a sophomore, and I told !then-head coach] Jane [Albright! that once I graduat­ed, I would come back as her assistant in two or three years. This is even better. I can't explain how excited I am to be part of the Huskie family again." 
The 37-year-old Owens helped guide Notre Dame to a 251-74 rceord during her tenure, including 10 consecu­tive NCAA Tournament appearanees and the only national championship in 2001. She is also credited with aiding the development of for­ward Ruth Riley, arguably the greatest player in Irish histo­ry. 
"Carol Owens is one of the top assistant eoaches in the nation, and in my opinion, she is the best skills eoach in the country when it comes to the post position," Riley said on Notre Dame's athletic Web site. "As a young player, I was very grateful to find a school where I knew I would develop fundamentally at my position. Coach Owens has personal experience of being an All­Ameriean post player, and she uses that knowledge teach and mold young student-ath­letes. I am very grateful for the time she invested in mak­ing me the best post player I could be." 

Owens has also been an integral part of Notre Dame's outstanding recruiting classes. The Irish claimed eight straight top-20 ranked classes from 1996-2003. 
"Carol's one of the reasons we've gone to 10 straight NCAA Tournaments," MeGraw said. "She's turned our pro­gram around. I don't know what we'll do to replace her. We're so happy and sad at the same time. We're losing a friend, a big part of the Notre Dame family." 
Owens played for No·thern Illinois from 1986-'90, where she set 13 school records, including being the all-time leader in scoring, shot blocks, free throws made, free throws attempted and field goal per­centage. She was also the first player to reach the 2,000 point/1 ,000 rebound plateau for either the men's or women's program at Northern Illinois. Owens was inducted into the Northern Illinois University Athletic Hall of Fame in 1995 and then into the Illinois Basketball Hall of Fame in 2001. 
''I've told her how fortunate I was as a young coach, not only to be able to coach a player of her caliber, but of her character," said Jane Albright, Owens' coach for the Huskies. "This is a person you'd want your daughter to play for." 
Owens graduated from Northern Illinois and played three seasons professionally in Japan, Spain and Italy. She will take over a Huskies team that went 7-20 this season, including a 2-11 home mark. Northern Illinois was 12-16 in both 2003-04 and 2002-03 and 17-13 in 2001-02.

In singles, Catrina Thompson bested Jones 6-2, 6-2 to regis­ter the lone point lor the Irish. Lauron Connelly was the only other Irish player to win a set in singles. Although she bounced baek from a loss in her first set tiebreaker versus Holden, she was unable to secure the win and fell 7-6, 2-6, 6-2 at No.4. 
Chang defeated junior Liz Donohue 7-6, 7-6 at No. 6. Suffering an upset. Buck lost to Boulytcheva 6-3, 6-4 at No. 2. Stastny, filling in for the injured Christian Thompson, played at No. 3, but dropped her match 6-0, 6-2 to Surkova at No. 3. Finally Miecoli defeated Sarah Jane Connelly 6-1,6-1 at No.5. 
The Irish will return to the courts on Friday versus Tennessee.

reeruiting for next year is very well underway," he said. 
Weis belinves the success of any college football program lwgins with its ability to recruit. On Feb. 27, he demonstrated the concnrn to improve that essential niTort at Notre Dame. 
Weis and his nnw staff had HO junior recruits visit the campus that Sunday, coordinating meetings between players, parents and the entire coaching staJT and later dividing players up bntwnon spndlic position coaches. 
The players attended a Notre Dame-UCLA baskntball gamn at the Joyce Center, a storied series between two basketball programs that would bring an advantageous atmosphere and experience to tim recruits' visits. 
"I think that every time someone steps foot on campus, an impres­sion is being made," Weis said. "Notre Dame shouldn't be about weather, it should be about the place." 
Weis pointed to past recruit com­plaints about the characteristically overcast weather of South Bend as unfortunate but existing reasons ­among others -for why players have not chosen Notre Dame. Weis said he thinks the recruits should receive a more thorough experi­ence of the school and program before making surface decisions, exhibiting a developing understand­ing of the college reeruiting process new to the first-time head coach. 
"I have a passion for recruiting, as much as I like to eoach," Weis said. "Now, that confuses some peo­ple [who askl 'How can somnbody who's been in the NFL for the last 15 years and luL'>n't had to meruit be a guy that has a passion for mcruiting'!' 
"It's because I look at recruiting like a game with wins and losses and setbacks and small stPps." 
Wnis has bnnn on four Super Bowl-winning stalls ovnr his NFL camer, and though lw is not used to losing the big game, he under­stands the feeling and has applied his disdain l'or that nxpnrinnee to rncruiting. 
"Wiwn you go after a guy and you don't got him, sometimes it's a setbw~k. and sometimes it fools like you just got punched in the mouth," he said. 
Weis' competitive approach to n~cruiting is a testament to his rool'i in the NFL with head machos Bill l'arcnlls and Bill Belkhiek, a place Weis knows is the destination of many of the talented players he seeks. 
"TIH~se kids all think they are going to play in thn NFL," he said. "Everyone who goes to a Division-! school thinks that's where they're going to end up. So all of a sudden, that's what winning is all about right thnre." 
So, along witl1 attractive weekend visits and meetings with assistant eoaches. Wnis ha'i the perfect mar­keting tool. 
"I don't wear it because it lits so well on my fmger," Weis said, reluc­tantly rnmoving a Super Bowl ring from his finger. 
"It's because it makes an impres­sion. You can make an impression verbally. Well, you can also make an impression non-verbally -it's tough not to notice." 
Weis plans to make recruiting efforts and -eventually, recruiting success-just a'i difficult to iJ.,rnore.

NIT 
continued from page 28 
of-10 on 3-pointers) and Russell Carter (seven points) hit consecutive three-point field goals to cut the deficit to seven. 
Teams traded baskets for the next six minutes, and Holy Cross led 60-55 with 5:31 to go. But Chris Thomas-who had a team-high 21 points and nine assists -hit a pull-up jumper and then found Rick Cornett for a wide-open dunk to cut the score to 60-59. 
Then, the ghosts of Madison Square Garden appeared in purple jerseys. 
Crusaders center Nate Lufkin canned 1-of-2 foul shots. Hamilton scored a bucket and point guard Torey Thomas con­verted a fast break lay-up to make the score 65-59. Notre Dame would not recover. 
Holy Cross made 7 -of-8 free throws -including 5-of-6 from Hamilton -to hold on to the win and advance in the NIT. 
While the Irish struggled once again to make key defen­sive stops, they also were severely out-rebounded ­especially on the offensive glass. Holy Cross grabbed 20 offensive rebounds to Notre Dame's 11, leading to 18 sec­ond-chance points and 34 points for the Crusaders in the paint. 
In comparison, Notre Dame scored just 11 points in the lane. 
"I think that if everyone boxes their man out, we won't have a problem rebounding," forward Rick Cornett said. "I think that's where we strug­gled the last few games." 

In a 66-56 win over Rutgers on March 2, Notre Dame sur­rendered 19 offensive rebounds and grabbed only five. 
In the first half Tuesday night, Torin Francis (23 min­utes, seven points) made a free throw to open the scoring, but the lead changed often throughout the half. Though the Irish seemed they would go into the half with the lead and some momentum up 32-30, Holy Cross freshman point guard Pat Doherty stripped Thomas and fed Hamilton for a buzzer-beating lay-up to tie the score at the break. 
"That's a big momentum play right there," Brey said. "That's a deflating play right before the half." 
The Crusaders then opened the second half with an 18-5 run. Notes 
+In their final game in Notre Dame uniforms, seniors Chris Thomas and Jordan Cornette broke significant program records. 
Thomas' 3-point field goal with 27 seconds to go was his 302nd career shot made from behind the arc. The basket moved Thomas past former Irish sharpshooter Matt Carroll on the all-time list for most 3­point field goals made. 
Cornette registered his 201st block Tuesday, as well, passing LaPhonso Ellis as the all-time leading shot-blocker in Irish men's basketball history.

MEN'S BASKETBALL 
Team runs out of steam in NIT 
As the NCAA tournament start­ed, a disappointing Notre Dame basketball season came to an end Tuesday night. 
Appearing on ESPN2 while the play-in game aired on ESPN, the Irish simply got beat by an inspired Holy Cross team. 
A Holy Cross team jumping at the oppor­tunity to knock off the Irish even after the Crusaders saw their 16-game winning streak come to an end on their home court in the Patriot League title game Friday. 
A Holy Cross team grabbing 20 offensive rebounds, forcing 19 Notre Dame turnovers and scor­ing 34 points in the paint. 
A Holy Cross team meeting a Notre Dame team that needed to have its season come to an end. 
Relegated to a second consecu­tive NIT appearance, an under­achieving Irish squad had noth­ing left in the tank physically to get back to Madison Square Garden -the NIT's saving grace. 
"I don't know ifwe could have got to New York, quite frankly," Mike Brey said. "Let's be honest with where we are depth wise and physically. It would have been nice to stay alive for anoth­er week. 


'Tm just being very realistic about our basketball team." 
Having Chris Quinn on the bench in a white button-down shirt and black pants instead of in the backcourt alongside Chris Thomas hurt this team a lot. Brey's right -the Irish simply don't have the depth to replace what Quinn brings to this team. 
But it wasn't just physically where the Irish couldn't keep pace with the Patriot League runner-up in the first round of the NIT. 
Most importantly, it was men­tally. 
When reaching the preseason goals of a Final Four run and a 30-win season became less real­istic each time the Irish stepped on the court, expectations changed to simply earning an NCAA tournament bid. 
But then the late-season col­lapse even took that goal away, with a collapse capped off by a loss to Rutgers that effectively ended Notre Dame's season. 
And the criticism about a dis­appointing season peaked. 
"We always held ourselves to high expectations, but all the negativity and criticism put a hamper on our team," Thomas said. 
Not meeting those high expec­tations became physically appar­ent by the sparse Joyce Center crowd of 2,518 for Tuesday night's game. 
That sent a strong message ­one received by the Irish. 
"When people don't show up, that takes a lot out of you," Thomas said. 
That wasn't any more evident than after the game in the Notre Dame locker room. 
Usually the immediate voices of this Irish team, even after dis­appointing losses, Thomas and Jordan Cornette just sat on the stools in front of their lockers with towels pressed against their faces. 
Towels hiding the tears streaming down their cheeks. 
Thomas eventually removed the towel from his face and fought through tears at the start of his interview before eventually settling in. 
Cornette didn't move. 

Those two didn't want to have their careers in an Irish uniform end this way. Removing the tow­els meant facing the realism there were no more chances left. 
No more chances to practice. 

No more chances to atone for the mistakes made in previous games. 
No more chances to make a mark on the Notre Dame pro­gram. 
When practice started in October, no one would have said this was the way Notre Dame's season-one of the most antici­pated in years -would end. 
But it was a good thing it did.
