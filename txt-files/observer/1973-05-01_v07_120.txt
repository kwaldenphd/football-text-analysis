Nixon 'accepts responsibility' 
Watergate affair topic of television address 
by John Herbers 
(c) 1973 New York Tims 
.. Washington--President Nixon insisted tonight that he did not know of the political espionage or the attempted coverup of last year's Watergate ~ase but ~at _he accepted full responsibility. Appearmg on _nationwtde radio and television, the President sa1d ~e had delegated the running of his 1972 ca_mpatgn for reelection to others in order to carry out hts search for peace in Vietnam and other Presidential respon­
sibilities. But he added: 
"In any organization the man at the top must ~r the responsibility. That responsibility belongs here m this office and I accept it." 
The President also said that he had given his new Attorney General-designate, Elliot L. Richardson, authority to hire an outside special prosecutor if he thinks one is needed to find all the facts in the Watergate case. Having turned the case over to Richardson, he said, he would again pursue full-time the responsibilities of finding peace abroad and a better life for Americans abroad. 
The President, having accepted the resignations of his two top assistants-H. R. Haldeman, the White House chief of staff, and John D. Ehrlichman, his chief domestic adviser-thus became faced with having to reshape the White House staff and find a way for the Addministration to maintain its credibility. 
The President was urged by Republican leaders 
around the -country to name a chief o~ staff wh~ ~as 
been in no way imi-licated in the allegations of political 
sabotage and who has an impeccable record for public 
service. 
Nixon's decision to accept the resignation of his two 
aides was made over the weekend in the isolation of his 
mountaintop retreat at Camp David, Md., as both his 
friends and foes waited and wondered what he would do. 
The President, saying that he wanted to address the 
nation "from my heart," described the charges 
against his close personal and political friends. He said 
that "the inevitable result" had been to raise serious 
questions about the White House itself. 
Nixon said he had been "appalled at this senseless, 
illegal action when he first learned last summer about 
the break-in at Democratic headquarters in the 
Watergate complex. . . 
Throughtout last year, the President sat?, he r~etved 
"continuous reassurances" that none of hts key atdes 
had been involved and thus he "discounted" news 
accounts casting doubt on the White House denials. 
Until last month, he said, he was con­
fident that the charges were 1unfounded. 
"However, new information then came to me which 
persuaded me there was a real possibility that some of 
these charges were true," Nixon said, and that there 
had been an effort to hide the involvement. He said he 
had then ordered a new investigation, with the reports 
it produced to be filed "directly to me, right here in the 
White House." 
In what he described as one of his "most difficult" 
moments, he said, he had accepted the resignations 
today of John D. Ehrlichman, his chief domestic ad­
viser, and H. R. Haldeman, his White House chief of 
staff. 
He said the aides agreed that the government's 
image had to be preserved. He spoke highly of Ehrlich­
man, Haldeman and the departing Attorney General, 
Richard G. Kleindienst, but pointedly noted that the 
White House counsel, John W. Dean 3rd, "also has 
resigned." . "Justicewll be pursued fairly, fully and impartially, no 
matter who is involved," Nixon said. "This office is a 
sacred trust and I am determined to be worthy of that 
trust." 
He said his new nominee for Attorney General, 
Secretary of Defense Elliot L. Richardson, had 
authority to designate an outside, impartial in­
vestigator if he felt that that would be necessary. 
The President explained his lack of knowledge of the 
Watergate developments before last month by noting 
that he had been determined last year to remain aloof 
from the election campaign, concentrating on the goals 
of the Presidency. 
"The easiest course would be for me to blame those 
to whom I delegated the responsibility to run the 
campaign, he said. But he described that as the 
"cowardly" course. 
"In any organization, the man at the top must bear the responsibility," Nixon asserted. · He pledged to do all in his power to assure "That the guilty are brougbt to justice." "It was the system that has brought the facts to light," he said, countering the arguments that had held 



.Ehrlichman .Nixon Richardson 
that the Watergate case illustrated the flaws of the 
American system. 
He praised the Watergate judge, John J. Sirica, and even had an unusually kind word for the American press. 
He said there was also a risk of devoting too much of the government's attention to Watergate, and that he would turn to the larger responsibilities of his office. 
Reciting a number of international initiatives that are under way-arms control, detente with the major Communist powers, the maintaining of peace in Southeast Asia and the Middle East-and his goals of full employment and prosperity at home, Nixon said he was determined to pursue those ends. 
He recited goals that he said he had written last Christmas eve: 
--peace in the world. 
-full opportunity for every American. 
-jobs for all who can work and generous help for those who cannot. ~tablishment of a "climate of decency and civility." -"to make this a land in which each person can dare to dream." 
It was a characteristic performance for the 60-year­old President, who has prided himself on his handling of many crises in his long political career. There was evidence that this one was filled with as much personal trauma as any in the past.

offer "four or five non-violence courses apart from those double listed" for the 1m fall semester. 
During the two semesters of the 1972-73 school term the program offered only double-listed ocurses 
"I expect by next year we'll ~ back on _the s~m~ road" paved by thz Umvers1ty s non-violence program which has operated since the fall of 1969, said Dean Crossen 
. "~e:re in the process of 
fmahzmg right now the ap­pointment 1of a new man to head the non -violence staff," said . Crosson, "as well as adding another faculty member." 
The , Arts and Letters Dean promised that publicity concerning the new courses would be available upon students' return to the University this fall. · 
Notre Dame's academic non­violence program began in 1969, at. the heighth of sentiment against the Vietnam war, and until this year had offered several courses each semester to University students, those enrolled num­bering 4()()-500 during someterms. Last year five courses were listed as solely non-violence program offerings each semester. 
After realizing that none of these courses jwere offered this year, a number of students and faculty expressed the fear that the non­violence program had been discontinued for good at Notre Dame. However, Dean Crosson's 
announcement  appears  to  have  
repudiated these fears.  
"The  University  offers  these  

courses not only in response to student interest, which has been continuous," said Crosson, "but

tradition of the Christian church a 
tradition that manv of the

country have lost sight of. It is 
important to bring it back into 
view." 

Problems with tbe non-violence 
program have stemmed from 
difficulties with funding, said 
Crosson, but those problems have 
now, for the most part, been 
resolved. 

Crosson believes that student 
interest in the program "will not 
be nearly as great as it was three 
or four years ago," but expects 
anywhere from 60 to 100 students to 
participate in the program next 
year "if the courses are good " 

"Frankly, three or four y~ars ago there were many instances of some pretty lax academic stan­dard_s ~~d .unwarranted highgradmg, sa1d Crosson, referring to 3.95 averages awarded many fo~~er students in the program. 
But I would not be trying to keep the program in the college if I didn't think standards would now be re~sonable," he concluded. 
Umversity Provost. Father ~ames Burtchaell professed Ig~orance of the arrangements· bemg made in relation to the program, reminding that the affair was "being handled by the College of Arts and Letters."

Tuesday1 May 1 1 1973 the observer 
Observer picks top ten of year 
1. Coeducation at Notre Dame 
More than any other event this year, the arrival of 360 women last fall changed Notre Dame permanetly. For the first time women were part of Notre Dame, no longer to be considered strangers or intruders, but part of the Dome and Notre Dame's destiny. The change was first apparent in the elaborate security precuations taken at Badin and Walsh, ~u~ soon made itself welcome in the classrooms and dmmg halls. 
But the change was not without its trials. Women soon were demanding that administrators supply them with better medical service and allow them to move off campus; they were not content to be objects, on or off campus, but were adamant that they be treated as people. 
4. Lewis Hall Incident 
It appears that Notre Dame still has not heard of the end of the Lewis Hall incident, in which Security en­tered graduate student's room and evicted a young man from her room. The charge was leveled that the student was expelled from the University without due process. 
The woman was not technically in violation of parietal rules because Lewis Hall, a graduate dorm, has no hours. Security charged, however, that they investigated only in response to a complaint by another student that the woman's male friend had taken a shower in the dorm. 
The AAUP has been investigating the matter. The Advanced Student Affais Committee has formulated a set of rules for handling disciplinary cases involving graduate students. 

5. Hesburgh resigns Civil Rights Commission Chair 
Following President Nixon's landslide reelection last November, Notre Dame President Father TheOdore Hesburgh was asked to resign his post as Chairman of the Civil Rights Commission. The WHite House Staff indicated that Hesburgh was asked to resign because of statements made before the. election, but Hesburgh denied having made the statements. 
Hesburgh stated that he would resign in compliance with Nixon's request, but felt that Nixon's request calling for his whole staff to resign was on questionable legal grounds. In 1964 the Civil Rights Commission refused to honor a request by President Johnson that they resign, claiming that the Commission was an independent agency and not a part of the White House staff. 

Thirteen slates of candidates entered this year's SBP-8BVp-marathon, in which the Glenn Sorge-Juan Manigault and Jim Clarke-Chris Singleton tickets finished one-two, throwing the election into a run-off. Problems arose, however, when R. Calhoun Kersten decided that he would enter the race. 
Denied the right to run as a write-in candidate, Kersten asked his followers to vote a blank ballot to invalidate the election. The strategy worked and 52 percent of the voters threw in a blank ballot. 
The new election saw so many slates of candidates that the election was called off and the different fac­tions were called to the bargaining table by Dr. Ackerman. A compromise constitution was written, forged and taken to the HPC. Other constitutions were proposed, the HPC accepted one, but their hall councils failed to approve any new constitutions by the required two-thirds majority. 
Anew election was called, and former SBVP Dennis EtiE-nne and Mike GPisinger were elected.

2. Faccenda revamps the Student Affairs Office 
Dr. Phillip Faccenda, formerly chief counsel for the University, ,inherited the position of Acting Vice­President of Student Affairs last year when Fr. Thomas Blantz departed. After holding the position for over six months, Faccenda aecepted the permanent position, becoming the first nonCSC to hold the position. . 
Faccenda has totally revamped the office of Student Affairs, establishing a central Staff composed of his top assistants. The Central Staff has taken over many of the policy decisions that were previously made only by the Vice President of Student Affairs and has realigned the machinery of the Office of Student Af­fairs. 

6. Student chairs SLC 
In an unprecedented move, the Student Life Council, tripartite advisory council for Student Affairs, unanimously approved Fred Giuffrida to chair the SLC for a year. Dr. Robert Ackerman, director of student activities, was elected Vice-Chairman of the SLC at the same time. qDr. Philip Faccenda told the SLC that its function was to legislate "in that area of responsibility which is assigned to the office of student affairs." 
The SLC spent the year exploring the campus housing crisis and its impact, and dealing with a number of proposals from the black community, in­cluding a black house. 
9. Farley, B-P, and Lyons picked as next women's dorms; students forced off-campus. 
Administration officials, convinced by students that 
an early announcement of the future women's dorm 
would not destroy hall spirit, but would help students in 
choosing their new hall, announced early in December 
that Farley and B-~ would be the next women's dorms 
and that Lyons Hall would be going to the women 
students in the '74-'75 school year. Farley and B-P 
juniors were moved to Lyons and the underclassmen 
were moved to the rest of the halls. 
The head count showed, however, that there were not enough rooms and that some students would be forced to move off-eampus. Sixty percent of next year's seniors and twenty percent of the juniors would have to live off-eampus, but some halls decided to overcrowd rather than split up. 

3. Academic Manual is Adopted. 
The Academic Council spent the entire year revising the Faculty manual, first adopted in 1967. The revision ultimately beeame the University's first Academic Manual. 
The Academic Manual, governing University academic policy, included some landmark decisions. It is the first statement from the academic community that acknowledges the position of Provost. The manual calls for the approval of new college deans by the academic community. Probably most significant for students at the University is that the manual guarantees student representation on many policy­making bodies. 
The issue of the revision of the faculty manual stirred so much controversy that Professor Edward Goerner declined a prestigious teaching award because he did not want to condone what the ad­ministration was doing. His action met with approval among the faculty of the University. 

7. Kennedy, Shriver visit campus. 
Last fall's presidential campaign brought Senator Edward Kennedy and Vice-Presidential hopeful Sargent Shriver to Notre Dame to campaign for the Democratic Presidential ticket. The large crowd for the Kennedy speech brought speculation that the crowd was there to see Kennedy, not to hear about the··  McGovern-8hriver ticket. 
Shriver charged that "Honor in Washington is as· dead as <Nixon's dog) Checkers--cold in the ground," and appealed to the students not to be swept along by the tide of cynicism. Shriver was introduced to the crowd by Fr. Hesburgh, who had invited all four major candidates to appear. The Republicans declined. 

10. Irish teams earn laurels. 
Notre Dame's football, basketball, and ~ockey teams all earned trips to postseason competition. The foot­ball team posted an 8-2 record, including a 45-23 defeat at the hands of USC and Anthony Davis, to earn an Orange Bowl bid against Nebraska. But the Irish just couldn't handle Johnny Rodgers and his teammates and went down to a 4o-6 defeat. 
The Irish basketnall team came back from an early 1-6 record to finish up with a 15-11 record and Digger Phelp's first invitation to post season play as the Irish coach. The team went on to defeat USC, Louisville, and North Carolina before losing to Virginia Tech in overtime of the final game, 92-91. 
The Irish Hockey team established itself this year by posting a 21-13 record in the rugged WCHA, finisl': ~: behind Denver and ahead of Wisconsin. The t(. II defeated North Dakota in the semifinals before losir hearbreaker to eventual NCAA champs Wisconsil the final three minutes of the second game of series. 4-3

Role of ND Library continually expanding 
by Jim Gresser Staff Reporter 
The role of the Notre Dame Library is aconstantly changing and expanding one. That role, which a serious shortage of funds threatens, will have a gre~t effect not only on the type of servtces the Library offers, but on the overall quality of a Notre Dame education. 
In contemporary education, revolutionary methods are being employed. The university library must according to the Director of Univ~rsity Libraries, Mr. David E. Sparks, be willing to respond to those changes.
Perhaps the greatest educational changes are occuring on the undergraduate level. Mr. Sparks feels that "undergraduaJe education is not static" but that it develops greatly "as teachers and students gain new insights into the process of ecucation." The role of the library, Mr. Sparks believes, is to "try to be aware of thosekinds of changes" and to "follow along." 
In many academic areas the library is feeling thesevereimpact of what Mr. Sparks calls the "age of the paperback book." Many teachers want their students to develop their personal libraries and a flight from the library results in certain fields. 
"Graduate education," Mr. Sparks added," is . a_n?th_er situation. There, a dtmmtshmg book budget can really hurt." Most graduate studies demand a large corpus of in-depth material and it is impossible to complete a doc­torate or master's degree without that extensive collection of materials. If the necessary books are not purchased now, both the need for the books and their cost will grow. Mr. Sparks stresses that 
"undergraduate education is. not less important but it has a different tempo."
In both undergraduate and graduate education new demands must be met : demands for books, periodicals, microtexts and readers, tapes and listening equipment. The obvious problem then as Mr. Sparks sees it, is how to reconcile "the changing times with an unchanging budget." 
Undergraduate Use 
On the undergraduate level, the library must meet an interesting assortment of needs. Unlike many other University libraries, the Notre Dame library is a complex combination of academic resource, study hall, and student union. As such, the library on the undergraduate level is used to essentially its full extent.

and as the building of the collec­tions and the use of them continue so does the quality of the research. Many departments have library committees which actively work with the library staff to improve the quality of the collections. Mr. Sparks feels that all departments should have such advisory com­mittees. 
All in all, Mr. Sparks feels that thelibrary'sservices are quite well utilized by the University com­munity. He also feels that this utilization will continue to grow as does the cooperation and com­munication between the academic community and that which is there to serve them. As. Mr. Sparks put it, "We take no complacent posture. The library can and always will be improved." 
Libary of the Future 
A key word for~the Notre Dame library of the future is, as it is in somany other places, automation. In both the academic and the clerical aspects of the library's maintainance, automation can be a tremendous boon. At the same time it also involves tremendous initial expenditures.

Kress Library of Economic Literature is priced at $39,000 which, while far less than it would cost to purchase the books, is still a great deal of money. Also, an in­creased micrbtext collection means more capital outlay for readers, storage cabinets, space and personnel, all of which takes money which the library simply does not have.

to the efficient governance of the library. 
The llibrary is a very complex [)rganization and one that is vital to the continued success of the University. Though Mr.Sparks feels the Library is not in any dire straits of losing its accreditation or of closing its doors, he does feel that the library situation "could become a real problem if we don't take some action now ... There are a few danger signals and we ought to pay attention to them."

t.c. treanar 
I was putting the last touches in my Final Ever Observer Column, a compendium of all the sagacity I have piled up over yars at Notre Dame, when my spy from the Federal Bureau of Astronomy burst into my room. He had a report from the planet Leath, which had been discovered only twenty years ago. The planet set four-and-a-half light years distant, and ever since its discovery in the U.S. we have been trying to contact the inhabitants of that bizarre world. 

l 
( Just last night, we received word from the top·3~ret mission of Number forty-four, the mysterious robot. That automaton relays a sohf:ring and mournful tale, and I gladly relinquish my column space

"On the planet Leath, nothing ever follows in logical order. What a

Isn't it nice to be home again? -James Taylor

f Home is the greatest four-letter word in the English language. The euphony of it describes its meaning. Soft-sounding, relaxing, effortless to say, it is a welcome word to the weary lips that must
1. contend with such difficulties as school, political, selfish, un­concerned and self-centered Yes, home is a good word. 
And for someone who has finally reached his twenty-first bir­thday and almost reached his diploma, home is a good feeling also. Home is something entirely different to me this May than it has ever been before.
1 
Going home this summer does not mean temporary residence for 
the purpose of gainful employment. Home, for the first time since 
( September of 1969, is home. I am finally moving back in without 
( any immediate plans to move out. In fact, it is a strange feeling not 
( knowing when your next change of atmosphere will take place. I 
( know, however, that two weeks after I am home, I won't feel like I've ever left. 
Home welcomes all of us. Unlike friends and lovers of our pasts, our homes do not forget us. We never llose contact because we're ignored; because eventhoughwe may ignore or resent our homes, they neverignore·nor resent us. The door is ever-open, and home always beckons. 
Home means people. Different people for each home, yet in many ways all the same. Home means little ones, (yes, brats at times lbut its impossible to deny the feeling their eyes and smiles convey when they realize that you are finally home. Being the youngest of five, my little ones are nephews and nieces, but there is precious little distinction between them and siblings. 
Home means parents and grandparents. Maybe having only one of each has made me appreciate them more. Home is the twice-a­week letter from Mom that you secretly. enjoy. (How many of your high school friends are you still writing to'1) And home is the sacrifices that everyone made to send you here. 
Home is the interest that is taken in you, C"Bob, what are they

it chooses the latter. · 1 "I spoke with the head Slug-an old man, with thick white hair and 
heavy white moustache and ample muscles bunched at the neck. He 
was sentient, and he was sorry-the sorrow a monster with long teeth, 
hanging onto his soul like a leech. 
"He took me to a fertile garden, with fat juicy fruit and the smell of 
God all around, and told me his vision of the truth. 'I don't know­
those are the only important words,' he said, 'there is no redemption 
to-be found, no system. The animals are happy, but not men. We 
cannot recognize the things of value-because the things of value 
don't last. There is only one lesson I have ever learned...' and sud­
denly a great fog rose around us, and when it dissapated, the garden 
was gone, too-all that was there was the desert, and a single blade of 
grass. 'Love the Fragments, he said, and bent over the blade. 'Love 
the fragments,' he whispered. 
"Later, I saw a worship-service for Uncle Miltie. The crowd drank 
from an anoydyne, which made them roll and roar like the animals. 
They danced the Ritual dance and chanted the ritual chant. A great 
voice arose: "How glad I am that you have come to dine with me 
and to share my bill of fare!" Then the fog again, and when it lifted I 
saw the bill of fare: the Head Slug, bound and ready for consumption. 
His face was full of resignation; he was ready to become the 
fragments he so loved ... " 
Here the report ended, and I gave an involuntary shudder, so glad I 
was to be at Notre Dame, safe and secure. I gave my spy a glance, as

towards the balcony; the play was clearly drawing towards a close.

writing about you now?"), andthe worry and the concern they have for whatever it is you think is important to you now. Home is not being able to understand, and yet not ever giving up trying to 
understand. 
It has taken this hardened and cynical senior a long time to realize what my home and family mean to me. How often have I said I would never make it through an entire summer at home? Now I anxiously await my role as full time law student and full time uncle. 
I find that it is extremely easy for those around us to neglect their homes. Appreciation for families is limited in a university en­voirnment. I think part of the reason is that to go away to school was, for most of us, a small rebellion aginst the limitations of home life. To admit appreciation for a home environment now, tends to tear down a bit of the independence and self-sufficiency we have worked so hard to establish. 
Our environment removes us from families, for all practical purposes, for a period of four years. Our friendships are mostly transitory, and by lack of any concrete associations, we lose some respect for the family institution. Yet, I hope that four vears' reflection will lead my fellow students to conclude,as I l'illV"e; mat voluntary removal from my family situation has made me grow to a point of independence such that I can realize the perpetual in­terdependence between myself and my family members. 
Notre Dameis but four years out of alifetime. To become closely attached to it, or to anything else that severely strains family ties is a mistake. Yet to incorporate Notre Dame, or anything or anyone into the bond of your family existance is to enrich all of those whom you love. 
So I humbly suggest that whether this be your first or last summer at home, you should smile when your thoughts turn to it. Smile because home means people who loved you enough to con­ceive, bear, and raise you; people who loved you through your mischievious childhood, through your difficult adolescence and finally loved you enough to sacrifice whatever is necessary to send you to Notre Dame. Also, home is people who will love you fifty years from now when your grandchildren are m college. 
Four years done, and I'm goin' home. I'm tired and I need some rest. I do wanna see all the smilin' faces 'cause it's sure gonna be nice to be home again.

Well Earn 
In any organization, the real hero is the little guy who puts in a lot of time and doesn't get much credit, certainly not his just reward. The Observer has always been lucky to have many of these heroes, and we would like to take the opportunity to thank them. 
The first round of thanks has to go to our reporters, who work under deadline everyday. Their job is difficult and thankless, but they do it well. 
Another round goes out to the night editors, assistant night editors, and night controllers, who often watch the sun . ise from their perches in our LaFortune offices . The small pay they get coold hardly keep any but the most dedicated 

Evalu 
This week students will use the University evaluation forms to express their opinions on the teachers and courses they have taken this semester. The results of the exercise will be compiled and sent to the various department chairmen so that they may intelligently criticize the members of their respective departments. 
One of the primary goals of any University is to promote quality in­struction. This can be done through hiring of quality intructors, but even more important is the constant im­provement of teachers currently em­ployed by the school. This can be done 


L My droogs from the several haunts of the campus convened last 
a 
night around two kegs of Schaefer. These distinguished associates were gathered with me in party caucus because it was time for the last "Gordian Knot," and I needed their careful evaluation of "how it s was on the eve of my last column.

 recent student body presidential concession speech that wasI delivered from the ROTC building roof to a crowd of wildly

gesticulating ducks. We did much thinking and drinking that nostalgic night and wew had reports from spies in every hall and heat tunnel on ~ampus. After the discussion, my droogies, inspired beyond mere oral ex­pression and incensed with alcoholic zeal, drafted the following statement of opinion, which I now submit for the consideration of the campus at large: "The university of Notre Dame is today a community seriouslysick,such that it cannot achieve its goals as established before th~ublic by its reputation, tradition and current leadership." ' Now this is quite a sweeping statement, I thought, especially for a crowd of drunks, so rather than end my last "Gordian Knot" with it I thought that, inasmuch as I have a stake in and a feeling for Nob-e Dame, I would explain what my collegaues said as they closed our last party caucus last night.

only by intelligent use of the course evaluation forms. 
Thus The Observer urges every student to use the course evaluation forms distributed this week in an intelligent and sincere manner. The results will help studentstin the future as well as faculty members teaching in various depart­ments. 
Only through serious use of the forms can students demonstrate the success or failure of current faculty and courses, and only through this method of evaluation can faculty be given the op­portunity to improve in their chosen vocation of scholarly inquiry.

affirmed by the constituent elements of the University. In this 
healthy Notre J?ame, a sense of ~onor s~ould prevail among faculty 
and students ahke, and a productive tension would mark relations at 
the interface between constituencies. In short, such a healthy Notre 
Dame would be testimony to the vitality of the fundamental prin­
ciples of ~e University: scholarship and Christianity. 
Now neither my friends nor I hold scholarshipand Christianity to 
be matters of littled moment. Nor do we hold this scenario of a 
"radica~y innocent" Notre Dame to be a whimsical fancy of equally 
shallow Import. However, we do hold that this University is diseased 
in all its constituent parts and that like a good cancer the disease is tspreadil"'i!:. ' Consider the following symptoms: -The faculty is bitterly divided over the question of University 
. governance, as evidenced by last year's faculty letters. The 
frustration and bitterness goes far beyond any conceivable definition 
of "productive tension." 

-A professor popular among students has returned the Univer­sity's highest teaching <:~ward because of what he called ad-
Dpinian 

ministrative "despotism."
-The Academic COuncil rejected nearly all the recommendation! of the Faculty Se~ate concerning University governance; severa~ were rejected at the specific request of the University President. 
-stud~nts regularly destroy University property, violate ever) standard of moral and ethical behavior, and most graduate from thE school unethical, irreligious , childish, and totally ignorant oi Christian moral teaching.
-A woman grad student was expelled from school in clear violatiot. of every principle of due process and every regulation established by the University itself. Protests were studiously ignored . 
-The introduction of 350 women to an eight-thousand male campm has been called "co-education." -Black studies can't even get a decision from the Student Liff Council.' 
In point of fact, the flesh that is Notre Dame is rotting and, I fear must inevitably fall from the skeleton of Christianity around which it was meant to grow. The school is administered in Byzantine fashior, and produces for the most part, social and moral misfits a~ graduates. This constitutes a sick polity. 
Now this is not meant ito suggest that the Golden Domehousesonl)' miscreants and perverts. My spies tell me that the chief officers ol the University are men talented in their respective fields, who do ar excellent job in their departments. This, I think, we must be willin[ to accept. However, the distrust, bitterness and rampant cvniri~m that seems to inhere in the current system of administration seemf symptomatic of a chronic disorder. Administrators distrust facult-: and students, which feeling is reciprocated, causing double£.; backlash and general misdirection of resources. 
Such a pathology cannot be cured by juggling committees. It cannot be cured by mumbled budgetary statements by tbf. University President. It cannot be cured by repression of any of th~ elements of the critical triad. It can only be cured if each student, teacher, and administrator recognizes the good resident in each member of the University and seeks to increase and benefit fron, that good. We must affirm the tremendous talent, reputation anf tradition of Notre Dame and make that rather than narrow personal concern the foundation of the University polity. 
In short, when I or anyone else says that Notre Dame is sick, WE' mean that the bitterness and distrust of years of unresolved conflict have destroyed the school's ability to graduate educated moral mer, as a matter of course. I have many many great people here in four years, from all parts of the place, and I will find it hard to say good bye when the time comes. But like everyone else, I must leave, and 1 make my farewells with the hope that people will someday soor begin to think, because Notre Dame has the potential to be mucl:. better. 
And so my colleagues went home for the last time, and that is, a~ Samuel Beckett would say, "How it is." 

In Light Of A Boycott

I wish the following remarks to be construed by the reader as an 
open pre:'entation to all members of the University of Notre Dame maneuverin~s ~e wis~es of the workers were consistently ignored commumty, from whom , I hope, serious comment will be elicited. Beyond this disputation, there remained themore solid question o One week ago therewas begun in the dining halls of the University ~he workers' living and working conditions and circumstances. Whil a bo;rcott of non-UFW lettuce, a step which was taken after 1t was generally appreciated that the lack of cohesive bargainin1 thevotlve approval of the student body in general referendum. The power severely limited the workers' ability to protect themselves o; fac.t ?f the issue had only recently been brought to light by Dr. improve their situation, detailed information as to the presen· Ph1ll1p Fa_ccenda, Vice-President of Student Mfairs, who announced dealings of owners with the workers, represented by the Teamsten the estabhshement of the referendum to register student opinion and or not, was simplynotavailable.TheObserver ran as advertisement! 
re~rt~ the fact that a quasi-boycott had been in effect since the begmmng of the academic year. Assistant Vice-President for StudentAffairs, Fr. James Shilts, attributed this first action to a p~rely administrative decision made by Fr. Jerome Wilson VIce -Pre~ident of Business Affairs, Mr. Edmund Price, Directo; of Food S~rv1ces, and Fr. James Burtchaell, University Provost. 
In the bme between Student Affairs' disclosure of a plan to put the question before the students (who would bear the brunt of the sacrifice involved in the boycott action) and the actual referendum the facts_ of the migratory workers situation were placed before th~ com~umty by the news media, particularly the Observer. If anythmg tangible or rational is to be said of those facts and their presentation, it is that they were at best cumbersome and in­conclusive. 
Th~ issue, eve~yone said. was a complicated one. There were, all ad~mt~ed, tw~ Sides to the question. There was, the Observer ed1tonally posited, only one way to respond: boycott. But, neglecting a series of photographs depicting conditions, all of which stood un docume~ted; els~where, it was written in the Observwer (April 13 pg. 8), . Cahfo~ma farm workers, according to the growers, wer1 well pa1d, particularly lettucepiciters who frequently made $4.50 b $5.00 ~r hour. Fur~ermore, they are well housed, covered by socia ~ecunty, workmen s compensation, and other benefits." To thi! ext~nt were the facts available for the informed electorate. Ef. fectively, of course, all such ambiguity suggested here was resolveci by ~ resoundi~gly positive student vote, a vote which gave to thE nation the affirmed support by the University of Notre Dame ol Cesa.r c.havez and the ~ationallettuce boycott. 
It IS time then, I beheve, to present some clarities, which rna) serve to suggest the presence of a similar issue somewhat closer t(ho~e, of less than. national import, which h~s hitherto gone un

Cesar Chavez' contention and hence the c~mtention behind the national boycott, was that fuis fundamental nght had been denied the workers. But there were, as the Observer duly reported, other principles involved. These were evident in the qu~tions of c.ompulsory union membership for the migrant workers, and m the cla1m of some that what was occurring was no more than a jurisdictional dispute between the Teamsters (who represented a number of the workers) and the UFW (which was seeking to represent all workers).

what's cooking with father burtchaell 
Many students have never seen Fr. James 
T. Burtchaell in his Roman collar, and even fewer have seen him in the long white lab apron he likes to wear when he's in the kitchen. Most know him as University Provost, or assistant rector of Dillon Hall, rather than gourmet cook. But Fr. Burt­chaell would rather talk about cooking than just about anything else. 
A glimpse at Burtchaell's background makes it only logical that he sould ap­preciate good foods. His grandmother <"A very good cook," Burtchaell recalled) at­tended the famous Cordon Bleu school of cooking in France, and his mother was "An even better cook," although she received no formal culinary education. 
"I first became interested in cooking when I was a student overseas-in England, Europe, and the Middle East," he related. "I began to pay careful attention to the wines and food; sometimes I'd even go in the kitchen and watch the cook." 
Burtchaell started to try his own hand "in earnest" about seven years ago when he returned to the United States. 
"I see cooking as both an art and a hob­by," he said. "I like it because it coincides with hospitality. Often I have the op­portunity to be a host, but rarely at the dinner table." 
enjoys cook rule 

Apparently it is a role Burtchaell greatly enjoys. He cooks once a month for the deans of the University ("Always something experimental, but they don't complain"), and every Thanksgiving "for people who are stuck here." Last Thanksgiving, he cooked a Hawaiian dinner for eighteen atop the library that was a complete departure from the traditional fixings. 
"I enjoy sharing things I've made," he explained. "It's rare today when one can make things with one's own hands." 
Burtchaell compared pre-prepared foods such as canned or frozen t.v. dinners to 
' "those paint-by-number kits. There's no creativity in them; it's not really your ownwork." 
Burtchaell adheres to the adage, "too many cooks spoil the broth." 
"I always cook alone-it's my 'therapy'­very relaxing. I usually spend hours by myself Ofl\a meal, and it's a welcome break." 
"I start with a cookbook and go beyond it­adding my own touches to the basic recipe, and experimenting." 
Burtchaell has no single favorite recipe, although he does recommend his oyster stew recipe that appears in The Notre Dame Cookbook. He likes a variety of foods, but is partial to French cuisine. 
The off-campus student should take a strong interest in cooking, Burthcaell believes, and take advantage of the bp­portunity to work with a stove-an op­portunity which Burtchaell regrets more on­campusers can't share. 
"Most of them are very spoiled," he contends. "They're used to being served all their lives, and they've just discovered that food costs a lot. A lot of them waste money on expensive shortcut foods. When I was a student in Germany, everyone <the students) made his own breakfast and supper. Students here are used to having food prepared for them rather than doing it themselves." 
Burtchaell scoffs at the proposal of off­campus students to have a University­operated co-op. 
"It's another example of what I was just saying. They've just got to learn how to cope with high food prices-they certainly won't be able to avoid them after they graduate." 
Burtchaell urges the study of "how to make inexpensive meals look attractive." Much of this, he feels, will develop if there is a genuine enjoyment from working in the kitchen. 
"Shopping is a large part of the fun of cooking," the Provost believes. 
Burtchaell said he would like to see a change in custom in American household cooking habits. He feels that menshould take a larger share in the cooking duties than an occasional summer barbecue, or preparing salads. 
"A large part of Thomas Wolfe's novels were devoted to descriptions of the food hismother cooked," Burtchaell noted. 
Burtchaell is strongly opinionated on the subject of restaurants. 
on restaurants 

"The cook makes the whole restaurant," he firmly belives. · 
Burtchaell also explained how to dif­ferentiate between an "ordinary" and a "superior" restaurant. 
"A menu like every other place indicates a trite restaurant. Anywhere you can get steaks, chops, a duck-always a due~ in orange sauce-and seafood .,latter, but m a good restaurant the cook will include some of his own special recipes." 
"A good restaurant takes pride in its 
materials. You'll' never see ketchup on the 
tables. They'll use olive oil instead of Crisco 
(here he pauses for derogatory emphasis), 
and good butter. Be suspicious if you're 
servedJoo large a portion; that usually in­
dicates a lower quality of food. In a good 
restaurant, you can't eat a whole lot of any 
one course-it's just too much." 

"A really good restaurant pays very little 
for furnishings and decoration. L'Orangerle 
Thank you who made 
in San Francisco is as plain as a service station bathroom, but the food is out­standing." Burtchaell also cited the Oyster Bar under Grand Central Station in New vo...k as another example of sparing decoration but fine fare. 
In the South Bend area, Burtchaell commented that "there's no single all­around good restaurant," quickly conceding that Dean Emil T. Hofman was NO's expert on Michiana restaurants. 
"However, several of them offer single excellent entrees. Al's Bar on Lincoln Way West has great goulash, and the Capri has superb veal cacciatore and fettucini although it's not listed on the menu." 
Burtchaell offered a quick overview of around-the-world cuisine. · 
"There are very few trained cooks in America. They haven't the pride in their work that the Europeans have. There was awful food in Jerusalem, but sometimes we'd get ducks and cook them ourselves. In France or Italy you can get a good meal almost anywhere. You can wander in to the smallest, most obscure restaurant and there will inevitably be good food-it's something consistent in both countries." He winces at the thought of England. "In England it's easy to get a bad meal anywhere." 
on cookbooks 
In cookbooks, Burtchaell confessed owning several of Julia Childs's, but he does not like Graham Kerr's. However, he favors both cooking programs on television and while he does not care particularly for Kerr's recipes he agrees with 1the spirit with which they are presented. 
"I think it's great to expose the public to alternate methods of cooking than what they're probably used to. Both cooks seem to enjoy their programs and convey enjoyment on them-which is what cooking is essentially all about." 
Burtchaell debunked the theory that cooking must be necessarily "complicated and exotic" in order to be good. 
"It's a shame that French cooking isn't more widely cultivated. People seem to believe that it's ·more complicated than it really is." 
Burtchaell further regretted that there is a "dying of the old traditions" in American homes. 
"There's no more handing down of 'how things are done' from mother to daughter. Most girls who get married today don't even know how to cook sauces." 
For the fledgling gourmet, Burtchaell offered several tips. 
"Start with one book, just one, and work your way through it. Don't get a big book. Something like The Joy of Cooking is fine. Julia Child is a bit exotic for the beginner, 
to all those An Tostal a 
success. Pictured here are only a few of those who spent many hours planning, organizing, building-and finally, playing. 
maria gallagher. 
but not bad." 

Improvisation, Burtchaell believes, is the key to making cooking individual and really enjoyable. 
"Find a good cook and watch a while. Don't be afraid to experiment on your own." 
He warned,however, that "it will take some years to grow," and urged beginners not to be disappointed in initial failures. 
Does the Notre Dame dining hall offend his gourmet tastes' Not at all, said Burt­chaell. 
"I eat in the pay cafeteria often enough to know what the students are getting," he said. "It's probably the best bargain you ean get anywhere, and not bad considering the amounts that must be served." He then added with a grin, "Ifyou think it's bad now, you should have had it when I went here! 'fhere's a substantial improvement." 
cafeteria beer? Burtchaell said he favors serving beer in the dining halls if Indiana lowers the drinking age to eighteen. This, he believes, would reduce it to the status of "just another beverage," which is all he thinks it should be. He was optimistic about the bill's passage, but said there could possibly be a compromise at age nineteen. Burtchaell said he was pleased with the growth of American interest in wines, but blanches at the mention of "pop wines." "I put BFA in the same category as dope," he said. He believes that those same people who drink the cheaper brands today will be drinking good wines in five years if they are serious about quality. Burtchaell feels that all American wines without I exception are inferior to their European counterparts. "But they shouldn't be," interjects Burtchaell. "After the war destroyed many of Europe's vineyards, the American vines were shipped over there. There's no ap.: preciable £difference in our soils or climates, and our processing methods are certainly far more advanced." Again, Burtchaell attributed American inferiority to a lack of pride in preparation. Burtchaell said he hoped to sometime take a group of students to Europe for a few weeks "just to learn to appreciated different types\Of cuisine." He suggested that they could possibly earn credit for sampling and comparing different types of wines and food. "I'd love to do it sometime, but I don't know when I'd ever have time. I'm busy in the summer, and Christmas is too cold... spring break would be ideal..."he mused. What's that University policy that only fifteen students are needed to petition a course? 






Tuesday! May 1, 1973 the observer 1 1 

Leisure time hard to fill inside penitentiary 
(continued from page 6) 
inmates participating in a variety of activities. The prison's recreation area is often a popular place for passing these hours. Outdoor facilities such as basketball courts, baseball diamonds, and a rather run-down miniature golf course are provided in this area, as well as an indoor gymnasium equipped with weightlifting equipment, a 
basketball court, and ceiling­
mounted television sets for 
bleacher viewing. 
Although most inmates making use of the recreathn area do so on strictly a part-tin. basis, several prisoners deem. inca!lable of work in one of the prison industries for physical or psychological reasons are assigned to the recreation area full-time, ac­cording to education director Wenzel. 
"There they live a mor~r-less 
vegetable existence," he says, "for 
the prison provides no other 
function for them." 
While several other prison ac­tivities are conducted on_ an in­stitution-wide scale (such as. 'weekend movies pooulat.."R-rated films can be show~. but no "X's), most inmate activites are formed on individual or small-group bases, and some are truly unique. 
One inmate employed in the 
prison tailor shop spends all of his 
free tim~> ;n the shop's basement 
repairinb , toys donated for 
distribution to charitable 
organizations at Christmas. Boxes 
and boxes of toys, repaired and 
ready to be shipped, line the cellar 
walls, and the mounds of broken 
toys still to be repaired are even 
larger. 
In addition to repairing broken 
toys, this tailor shop employee and 
several helpers produce their own 
creations, ranging from hand­
made, wooden, toy circus wagons 
and Budweiser beer wagons to 
various forms of hand-made 
candles. "'"-quests for these ar­
ticles usually run well ahead of 
production, and selling prices run 
from a dollar or two for candles to 
thirty dollars for the four-foot long 
beer wagons. Any money an 
inmate attains by selling his work 
is placed in apersonal prison ac­
count to be spent or saved at his 
discretion. 
The toy and candle makers are 
but several of many accomplished 
inmate , artists. Quite a large 
number of prisoners do fine work 
in sketching and painting. 
Browsing through the prison art 
gallery, one might easily get the 
impression he is viewing a 
professional art exhibition. The 
majority of the works on display 
would bring top dollar in a 
professional art market, but the 
inmate artisits usually charge far 
less. The largest amount ever 
recieved by an inmate for his work 
was $75 for a large painting per­
sonally commissioned by a 
clergyman for a church 
decoration. 
The range of subjects and styles 
employed by the inmate artists is 
as broad as the spectrum of their 
personal backgrounds. Portraits, 
landscapes, even caricatures are 
represented. One inmate 
specializes in providing a three 
dimensional effect to his work by 
building out his sketch image in 
clay or paper mache' before the 
fmal painting. Another inmate 
artist obviously appreciates the 
artistic elements of the feminine 
form, as his easel adorned with 
painting of a voluptuously posed 
nude woman demonstratees, 
"We doo't normally approve of 
tbe inmates cboosiDg such sub­
jects," says education director 
'WeDzel , "but nor do we take any 
action We8s it becomea a habit." 
Alted where an inmate miebt· 
obtain a model for such a ~f!DI, 
Mr. Wenzel replied, A terrifle 
memory, a terrilk memory." 
The artistic: eadeavon of Ja­dlana State Prlaoa inmates, however, are DOt limited to thoee of 
. painter'S and toy maken. 1i1.uJ inmatea are aecompu.Jted 
musicians and a can often be heard practicing in their cells or par­ticipating in impromptu jam sessions. While country-western musicians seem to be the most abundant in the prison, blues and rock artists are also quite com­mon. Walking past the prison chaplain's office, one might hear a group of a dozen inmate musicians practicing a rock opera written by a black inmate bass player. Needless to say, with all of this inmate musical talent, the prison often schedules performances and talent shows, one of which is an­nually open to the public. 
Boredom Hours 
While personal hobbies consume free time of many prisoners, most inmates, however, still find their leisure hours filled with nothing but boredom and unconstructive hours filled with inothing but boredom and unconstructive ac­tivity. It is such a fact that makes many inmates criticize the Indiana State Prison administration for being "totally custody-minded" rather than being concerned with. inmate rehabilitation. 
As on inmate puts it, "They bring you in here to cure your 'social ills' and make you want to get an honest job when you get out. But how do they go about doing it? They stick you in a cell half a day and the other half make you work in the Tag shop. You call that rehabilitation? I don't know about you, but I don't know too many places outside that are looking for experienced license plate makers." 
Prison Education 
While inmate complaints such as 
this are far form uncommon, the 
fact remains that the prison does 
offer several rehabilitation 
programs in educational and 
vocational areas. But for each of 
these programs there exists a 
strong inmate criticism. 
According to prison policy, any 
inmate desiring to take part in an 
education program in place of 
being assigned to one of the prison 
industries may do so. Instead of 
reporting to the tag shop or soap 
factory, he attends each day a 
program of classes taught by one 
of three full-time teachers or 
several inmate-teachers. Classes 
taught are primarily adult basic 
education courses and courses 
aimed at providlng an inmate with 
a high school diploma equivalent. 

According to one middle-age inmate-teacher, 35 per cent of the prison's inmate population is functionally illiterate. But a total of only 12 per cent attend daily classes. The reason? "Money," says the inmate-teacher. "It JUSt doesn't pay to be a student in prison. While tag shop workers make 70 cents a day, students only get 20 cents. And even though either one isn't much, there's quite a difference between four and 14 dollars a month when it comes to buying coffee and cigarettes." 
While education direector Wenzel agrees that money does probably play some part in keeping illiterate inmates out of classes, he feels that individula personal reasons are far more applicable. "Many inmates simply feel that they've done alright so far in life without an education, so why bother with oen now?", says Mr. Wnezel. 
The relatively small attendance of. optional evening classes run by Notre Dame and St. Mary's students under the direction of SMC associate education professOr Sr. Margaretta Reppen · wou.ld appear to support Mr. Wenzel's contention. One SMC volunteer even relates how one inmate at­tending the twice-a week evening sessions showed little interest in his studies and remarked, "All I want to learn to do is write my name on the writ to get me out of here, and I've got 25 years to do it, so I'm in no hurry." 
But the fact remains that there 
are many inmates at Indiana State 
Prison who earnestly desire an

Lack of Funds for Education 
Education director Wenzel agrees that a nightly education program would indeed be valuable, but because of space limitations and the lack of per­sonnel to supervise visiting grouJI;, such ideas are just too impractical. "Certainly we'd like to provide better programs," says Mr. Wenzel. 'The warden has never vetoed .any of our suggestions for better education. But we just don't have the money 
Weekend buses to follow Angela 
by Terry Keeny Staff Reporter 
Weekend bus runs between Notre Dame and St. Mary's will continue to use the Angela Blvd. route after1i:OO pm on Friday and Saturday nights when the electric gate th the U.S. 31 bus entrance will be removed and the iron swing gate will be locked. 
This action is necessary ac­cording to Security Director Ar­thur Pears because of the repeated vandalism of the elctric gate on Jet weekend nights. Pears said that as 
~ as four or five gates were 
broken a week at a cost of $15 per 
gate. 
The bus drivers refuse to use the iron gate exit because they have to leave the bus to unlock and swing the gate open. On occasion when the bus driver has left the bus to

any more to do it." 
Nor are the prison's basic education programs the only rehabili tation efforts suffering from lack of funds. The prison offers various vocational learning opportunites in such fields as auto­mechanics, welding, upholstering, refrigeration, and radio-TV repair, but according to many inmates, the equipment used to teach these skills is so limited and out of date that any prisoner -attempting to obtain a job in his trained field after his release would find himself lost in a world of new techniqu"es entirely foreign to him. As one inmate remarks, "You just can't learn to fix a '73 Ford engine when you're learning on a '63 Chevy." 
Money Indeed, after aU of the various arguments concerning prison rehabilitation are aired, one single word appears to provide the chief answer to the entire problein money. As with prisons all across the ·country, state funds are simply not great enough to provide adequate, advance rehabilitation programs. Salaries for student inmates cannot be raised to make education more appealing. Salaries for full-time prison educators cannot be boosted to lure greater numbers of first-rate 
teachers into reform education. Funds cannot be raised to provide vocational training programs with mooern, up-to-date equipment. And the list goes on and on and on. 
But the fact that such a growing list of financial difficulties can be halted is obvious. An increased awareness on the part of state legislators concerning the lack of funds for prison rehabilitation could lead to a state budget foredistribution favoring finan­cially staved prisons. But the big question remains, will such an increased awareness ever occur? One can only hope that legislators will recognize the difficultieS before the arrival of a time when it makes little difference whether a prison is custody or rehabilitation oriented, when it can afford custody and nothing more.

Cost Of Caring 

Editor: 
I'm tired this evening. I'm suffering from the weariness that follows the end of an involvement. The political confusion has finally come to a resolution. So I'mltired, and somewhat confused about what to do next. How different it would have been had that cam­paign, joked about during January lunches, and fought in February snows, had ended, (as any decent political campaign should), at the time of elections. But this one didn't, it refused to die until now. 
I feel alone this evening. I'm wondering why I allowed myself to become so entangled in University affairs, or why I ever wanted to I'm asking myself these questions for at least the thousandth tirxre. There is still no answer that I ,can understand. The lesson of the past months is that such political entanglements can be spiritually devastating 1 One often hears of deceit and lying, but the worst are the lies you tell yourself. You can constantly try to be 1ruthful but gradually you change. Each person you meet . causes subtle manipulations in your character, until,you no longer represent one~ person but rather many strangers housed in one ego. 
This has been a frivolous ad­

venture, especially for someone 
who has been around as long as I 
have. Long-graduated com­
panions haunt me as I think about 
their reactions and derisions if 
they discovered this last attempt

Hesburgh 
And 
neither has gained any national recognition for their fair­mindedness. Definitely, the Watergate Case needs a person who is recognized by the entire nation as being honest, non­political, and objective. That man is our own Father Hesburgh. 
· Everyone is aware of the work that Father Hesburth has done for social justice in the United States. He has also never worked on a political campaign, nor has he publically supported any one candidate. Nevertheless, he has always deplored social inequities and violations of individuals' rights. It is impossible to argue that individual rights have not been violated in the Watergate Case, but the. problem of who the real violators were still confronts us. Father Hesburgh could be the very person that the country needs to clear up this political scandal and restore a sense of honesty to the American government. 
Of course, Notre Dame should not go unpaid for the rendering of the services of our President to the United States 1 Congress could verywell grant Notre Dame a three mjJ!ion dollar endowment The ~ eame<tlrom This grant could be used for a number of purposes.

Center studies man's contemporary society 
by Steve Magdzinski Staff Reporter 
<Part II of a two-part series) 
The history of the Center for the Study of Man dates back to 1961 when it was founded by the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, president of the University, and Dr. George Shuster. With the help of matching funds from the Ford Foundation and grants from the Carnegie Corporation, said Dr. FitzGerald, "from 1961-1968, the Center was originated, developed and flourished under Dr. George Shuster." 
The first large project of the 
Center was a three-year study of 9, 
451 Catholic eiP.mentary and 2, 075 
secondary schools. Originally 
funded with a $350,000 grant from 
the Carnegie Corporation and 
$46,000 in additional funds, the 
project eventually produced the 
first thoroughly researched study 
of the American Catholic 
elementary and secondary school 
system. 
They study of Catholic schools 
dealt with the religious and moral 
commitments of the Catholic 
school as an institutional form, the 
economic squeeze on parochial 
schools and the future of such 
schools in the United States. 
In 1966 the results of this study were published by the Notre Dame Press in Catholic Schools in Action. In turn the massive data collected . in this research provided the empiricai basis for 16 additional studies, among them written ar­ticles on Catholic schools in Denver, St. Louis, Florida, Michigan and other areas. Of special interest in these studies were the included attitudinal demographic studies as well as new instruments for determining the changing religious attitudes of Catholic students. Out of these studies centered in education, said FitzGerald, was developed within the Center the Notre Dame Office 
of Educational Research. 
In November, 1971, the OER completed its report on the Financial Condition of Non-Public Schools for President Nixon's Commission on School Finance a study funded by the Office of Education of the Department of Health, Education and 1Welfare. Since then, in the absence of ex­ssion on School fina­nce, a study funded by the Office of Education of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Since then, in the absence of ex­ternal funding. the OER is tem­porarily inoperative in the field of research. 
Prior to Dr .,Fitz.Gerald, who was named acting director on Oct. 6, 1971, the directorship of the Center for the Study of Man was held by Fr. Ernest Bartell gave uphis post to become president of Stonehill College Northeastern, Mass. 
As an autonomous in­terdisciplinary research center, the Center for the Study of Man has the academic status of an institute "Threatening in the long run are the possible effects of massive industrialization and of the eventual exhaustion of our power resources. A highly stimulated industrial "Sector may be beneficial to a society's short term economic vitality, while threatening its very basis in future'generations." 
Approval and funding for the study are expected in the next several weeks, said Sayre. 
The research at the Center for the Study of Man in Contemporary Society varies from religion to technology, from soul-illness to computer training in the SSTRL. But each of the projects is aimed at the .improvement of a world which undoubtedly needs improvement. The Center studies man in con­temporary society, "a society confronted with novel and in­creasiiH~ly complicated social problems," and, in Dr. Fit­
Gerald's view, "challenging the combined resources of our cultural heritage and the rapidly developing socio-behavioral disciplines." 
and, accordingly, is directly responsible to the Vice-President for Advanced Studies, Dr. Robert Gordon. Staff and facilities on 5th and 11 floors of the Memorial Library are funded in part by the University. 
Most of the research done at the Center, however, must be funded by outside sources, public or private. Lab projects are studied and approved by a laisson com­mittee made up of six members of the College of Arts and Letters. 
Including principle and associate researchers and staffs, the director and his administrative secretary, there are 57 persons employed in the Center for the inner~ity, with minorities and the poor need support and en­couragement to develop new programs and to do a more ef­fictive job. The task of CCUM in this regard is to develop training programs with, by, or for the trainees to give them new insights, training skills and to acquaint them with the best available resources being used in other parts of the country. 

The CCUM also conducts a year­long Religious Leaders Program in which administrators, pastors, teachers, and social workers study, reflect and pray to continue their ministry in more acceptable ways, said Egan. · 
Center 'has a large religious component' 
Studyof Man. The SSTRL employs 25 persons, including faculty, technicians and graduate students. 
Research at the Center 
Among the work that ahs been done at the Center and the SSTRL in the past have been studies on juvenile delinquency, drug ad­diction, poverty, inner~ity social problemsand Latin American educational studies. 
One project still in progress under the funding of the Ford Foundation is Prof. Julian Samora's five-year program in advanced study for Mexican­American graduate students. The students, five or six of whom are working on doctoral degrees, are doing research work in special areas, after which they will be able to return to their communities to contribute the knowledge they have gained there. 
Another large program, under the funding of the Lewis and Lilly Foundations and smaller grants, is a pastoral theology program under the joint direction of Dr. Tjaard Hoommes, l''r. Donald McNeill 

Research ranges from technology to religion 
and Msgr. John J. Egan. This program is both academically and action oriented. 
The Pastoral Theology Group has developed a program of field training in which graduate students in pastoral theology go into the inner-city or other areas in which religious problems with a distinctly local flavor not described or dealt with in traditional literature have developed. 
Msgr. Egan has additionally been the director of the Catholic Commission on Urban Ministry <CCUM> since 1966. The CCUM is an organized network of 1300 lay people,priests and nuns in 42 states and Canada, which has several different functions. ItS work in the field s of social action and pastoral ministry consists of researching its won activities, relating them to other similar activities and thus, gaining a newt of support for its won participants. 
Often enough, said Msgr. Egan, the work of CCUM is not too popular. Yet those who work in the

A national newsletter, Link is published by the CCUM, which, as its heading states, "connects ideas and services for people in pastoral and community ministry." LINK, edited by Egaa, has 2, 500 sub­scirbers across the country. 
Under the direction of Dr. Thomas Broden, CCUM'conducts a work training program for seminarians and nuns, the purpose of which is to develop programs to combat white racism in both the Church and 1society. 
"What is interesting about the Center for the Study of Man," said Dr. FitzGerald, "is that, though there are other institutions larger than this one, they tend to be narrower in scope. This is the only one that I am acquainted with that has a large religious component. The existing techniques of the social disciplines are thus made available to religous groups to discern and assess the contribution of the religous culture in dealing with contemporary social problems: an interesting development academically ,in that without discplacing the traditional theological or religoius view, it makes available to our traditional understanding of religous life the results of these techniques applied to contemporary religious ex­perience."

It is, as the proposal submitted to the NSF says, "a systematic study of the environmental, ethical and commerical values involved in the application of contemporary technology."

Irish crew wins 
Notre Dame's crew team swept Grand Valley State College on April 14 at Grand Valley, and dominated a tri-meet with Fordam and Williams College by winning 
two out of three races on April 21. 
The team also placed fourth, third and fifth in the Heavyweight, Lightweight and Freshman divisions at the Mid-West Sprints in Madison, Wisconsin. 
In their first face of the season, the varsity heavyweight eight turned in the fastest time of the day with a 5:38 current aided. Grand Valley clocked a close 5:44. The varsity Lightweights won their race by 15 seconds over Grand Valley with a time of 5:49. The Freshman edged by with a half a boat deck showing a time of 6:00 for the 2000 meter course. 
Fordam, the Lightweights won the first race of a best-of-five series for the Eward Cup. Against heavy winds the Lights sprinted past Fordam at the 1500 meter mark, but no times were recorded for an official inadvertantly halted his stopwatch during the middle of 
the race. , 
The Lightweights were stroked by captain Kevin McEvily from St. Ed's Hall. George Willinet, Frank Laughery, Paul McEvily, Steve Fenstenmacher, Art Geis and Frank Matthew rouhded out the boat. The tights were coxed by Mike Houle. 
On Saturday, April 28, vying for the Eckels cups at the Mid-West Sprints, the Heavyweights crossed the line at 6:09 good enough for fourth place in a field of seven. Wisconsin won by three lengths with a time of 5:24. Heavyweights were stroked by Rick Dorosh. The rest of the eight was composed of Fred Hydrick, John Walsh, Joe Perry, Chris Kotch, Dan Hesse, Greg Erickson, and Chris Zilinski. 

A weak start, and bad placement kept the crew from walking past Purdue and Kansas State, who pulled to a length's lead and sat on it. Coxwain, Diane Johnson guided her boat to fourth place ahead of Nebraska and St. Thomas. 
The Freshman, after ex­periencing a very poor start, managed to retrieve a fifth place, although losing to Lincoln Park Boat Club by one tenth of a second-6:23.2-over the 1900 meter course. 
At Fordam the Freshmen were deprived of victory when six man, John Moushigian, ~ncountered equipment failure in the first five hundre<metersof the race. Stroked by Kevin McBride and Coxed by Jose Santellano the Freshman finished only 11 seconds off the 6: 21 pace set by Fordham in the heavy current. 
Also in the Freshman boat are Bill Brady Burkes, Tom Melvin, Joe Piotroeski, Mark Thickpenny, Doug Quackenbush, and Stan Gerrity. 
New officers will assume thetr 
duties next week. Frankie 
Loughery will replace John Goal 
as president, PaulMcEvilytmd Jim 
Roe will become treasurer and 
secretary respectively. 
This Saturday the Crew will journey to Mariatta, Ohio for the Mid American Colleaiate Rowing Association championship on the Ohio River.

The rest of the half was marked by a lot of contact as both teams became extremely physical, a characteristic which has marked the playoff series from the start. Thorpe made a key save in the closing minutes, coming out of the net to stop a Dillon breakaway. 
After Thorpe made another excellent save on a Chuck Nadeau slap shot, Wittliff went to work again. With a little over three minutes gone Wittliff took a pass from Eric Horne in front of the net and dumped the puck in on the right side. This broke Dillon's back and from there on the game became a free-for-all.

It was not a good weekend for the Notre Dame tennis squad, even though things looked great coming into the matches at home with Michigan State and Iowa. Afterall, the Irish had rallied from four opening losses and five in their first seven matches to post an 11-7 mark before the weekend action.

Notre Dame tried valiantly in the tandem action, needing a sweep for the victory, but only the combinations of Chris Kane-Rob Schefter and Mark and Paul Reilly could muster victories. So, the Spartans gained their revenge, 5-4. 
Sunday morning, it was the same story, Iowa came to Notre Dame with the possiblity of setting a new team record for consecutive wins during the season, but the Hawkeyes needed a three set 'Vic­tory over the Irish tandem of Walsh and John Carrico to set the mark and record a 5-4 win. 
Notre Dame again found itself at a 4-2 disadvantage after the singles round with only Walsh and ScheCter recording wins, but could not quite get that third victory in the doubles.

The Irish Eye 
=============================================:===========:===================:===========================================================================:=:=:===============:======:========================:=====:=:=:============:==========The 

year in retrospect· 

There's a lot to be said about Notre Dame's athletic fortunes during the 1972-73 school year. 
It should be said that the year was an exciting one; one which saw ND's football, basketball, and hockey teams all complete successful regular seasons and then go on to post-season competition. It could also be said 
that the year was a disappointing one; one which saw the Irish shellacked in the Orange Bowl, shaded in the NIT championship game, and nipped in the WCHA finals. 
And the best explanation for whatever is said about the '72-'73 campaign lies in the rosters of the Irish teams fielded during the year. For almost without exception, the squads competing for ND in the "major sports" were youthful, underclass teams which carried potential, expectations, and not a great deal of certainty into their respective 
seasons. 

Coach Lefty Smith's hockey team lost its senior goaltender to graduation, ,and entered its second WCHA campaign with only a handful of fourth-year performers. Coach Digger Pelhelps' basketball team returned but one starter and but one senior 'regular from '71's 6-20 squad, and Ara Parseghian's gridders entered their 1Q-game season loaded with youth-particularly at the skilled positions. 
Asking a young, potentially talented team to compete with the best college opposition in the nation-regardless of the sport-is asking for an up-and-down, possibly exciting and possibly disappointing year. That's exactly what the Irish got in 1972-73, and nowhere were the exttemes inore apparent than with Ara Parseghian's ninth Notre Dame football team. 
The Irish entered their season opener at Northwestern's Dyche Stadium with a squad dotted with question marks. One of the question marks was at quarterback, one was in the offensive backfield, and one was on the defensive line. Northwestern, 7-o losers to Michigan the week before, loomed as an interesting, if not demanding opponent for the ND team. But as a sellout crowd of 55,000 looked on, the Irish crushed the Wildcats 37-o, and had given names to their question marks by the end of the first half. The quarterback was Tom Clements, the running back was Eric Penick, and the defensive lineman was Steve Niehaus, and they, along with veterans Darryll Dewan, Greg Marx, and Andy Huff, put on a show that thoroughly delighted Notre Dame partisans. 
Among those the Irish delighted was Jim Donaldson, the recently-retired Observer sports editor, who observed, midway through the first half, that "this is what Notre Dame football should really be like: we score, you get creamed. We score, you get creamed .... " 
But the Irish had no time to relax after they'd alternately scored on and creamed the 'Cats. They next met Purdue, a team loaded with All-American and pro prospects, and had to confront a huge, talented Boilermakerdefenset-a defense led by tackle Dave Butz. "We're going to run right at him <Butz)," said ND tight end Mike Creaney. "Is he slow? No, 'he's an All-American." But run and pass the Irish did, all the way to a 35-14 triumph that starred Clements, Creaney, and, again, the ND defense. 
And during the next two weeks, the Irish maintained their winning ways. They tripped Michigan State, 16-o, and thumped Pittsburgh, 42-16, before taking their 4~ record i!lto a game with the Missouri Tigers. . 
Hampered by the f1red-up T1gers and by the loss of freshm.an Steve.Nte­haus, ND fell behind 30.14 in the second half before mountmg a furJO.us comeback. The Irish sliced the count to 30.26 before Clements was m-different, but the results were just as painful. Nebraska, displaying every bit of its awesome strength, crushed Notre Dame ~. and left the Irish with little consolation, save a fourth period,Clements-to-Demmerle 
TD pass. There was frustration and disappointment in the Irish locker room after the runaway, but coach Parseghian summed it up best when he replied 
tersely to a questioner: "I don't see how you can ask that (if the defeat would cause the Irish to return to their no-bowl policy). I would suggest to you that it would be just the opposite. That we would want to come back to prove we're a better football team than we showed today." 
And while the Irish gridders were losing to USC and Nebraska, the ND basketball team was also suffering through some December-January woes. Coach Digger Phelps' squad, whose starters included four sophomores and a junior, lost six of its first seven games, including close decisions to Michigan, Indiana ,and Kentucky. In that same mold was Notre Dame's second loss of the season, in the home opener against Ohio State. The Irish, after leading most of the way, were tied at the end of regulation, and were defeated in overtime, 81-75. "It was just like this up at Michigan," lamented sophomore forward Pete Crotty. "We had that game, too, and let it get away at the end." 
But things soon improved for Phelps' crew. A stunning, 7Hi9 win over Marquette--at Milwaukee-kept the Irish on the first of several medium­length winning streaks, and, by the time they had completed the last such skein~ by upsetting South Carolina at the ACC, 73-69, Notre Dame was 15­11 and had accepted a bid to appear in New York's National Invitational Tournament. 
The Irish went into the tourney as heavy underdogs, and they remained that way until the final weekend's action. ND played its first-round game against Southern Cal, on St. Patrick's Day, and the Irish used a bit of luck to win that game, 69~. The next week brought upsets of Louisville, 79-71, and tourney favorite North Carolina, 78-71, and the Irish, on Sunday, found themselves in the title game against Virginia Tech's Gobblers. 
The Hokies earned the NIT crown 92-91 when Bobby Stevens pitched in a 15-footer with one second left in the first overtime, but Notre Dame's John Shumate was selected as the event's Most Valuable Player, and the Irish, with all five starters returning next season, had found a solid base from which to guild in '73-'74. 
"We'll be back," Digger had promised earlier in the season, "'We're still young-we'll be back." Mter the tournament, the words were the same, but with a different twist. "Next year's a new year, and we'll be back. It's like I told you last week-'we've only just begun."' , 
Nor were the ND cagers the only Irish team to suffer a one-point loss in a championship series. Coach Lefty Smith's icers, after battling to second place in the WCHA standings during the regular season, bombed North Dakota in the first round of the league playoffs, and then met always-strong Wisconsin in the title round. 
. The two teams had split their earlier four meetings, and the first match of their two-game, total goals playoff ended in a 4-4 tie. And the second game was tied at three with just minutes left in the final periodwhen ND's John Noble was whistled off for cross-checking, giving the Badgers the opportunity they needed to score, and win thegame and the championship, 4-3. 
"As the <final) game wore on," said the South Bend Tribune's Steve Klein, "you got the feeling that they could have played on and on without settling anything. It was apparent in theh third period ·that something 
tercepted while attempting a final-drive sideline pass to Darryll Dewan I other than the two teams was going to decide the the game." 
The play was a close one, but Mike Fink's theft secured Mizzou's upset. "It's too bad/' said a subdued Frank Pomarico afterwards. "If Darryll had caught that pass he might still be ~unning." 
But the Irish bounced back after the1r loss, and shut out TCU and much-heralded tail back Mike Luttrell, whose pre-game comments about the ND defense were not taken lightly by co-captain Gr~g Marx. Luttrell. was stymied all afternoon, and the ND offense, meanwhtl~, scored three times to win, 21-o. "Ask Luttrell," suggested Marx, "ask him how many yards he got. A~k him if this was a Notre Dame de~ense." . 
Followmg TCU, ND dumped Navy and Air Force, and head~d mto the season's home finale with an Orange Bowl bid at stake. The Irtsh top~ the Hurricanes, 20-17, but not .before a snowball had cau,sed Bnan Doherty to fumble an extra pom.t at~empt, and not before Canes had come close on a 44-yard try at a tymg fteld goal.

As bitter as the loss was it did not lessen the achievements of Smith's sextet. The Irish featured the most potent line in college hockey-Ian Williams, John Noble, Eddie Bumbacco-and blitzed the WCHA during the last half of the season. Notre Dame won 11 of their final 13 games, and included in that win column four wins over the nation's top-ranked hockey team: two against Michigan State over the weekend of January 26th, and a pair against Wisconsin over the weekend of February 23rd. 
Notre Dame's oUtH teams-the competitors in the so-called "minor sports" --also experie'!ced up-and-down seasons. Defensive lapses and stranded baserunners have combined to give the ND baseball squad a 9­19slate, and coach Jake Kline's squad, even if it finishes with a rush, can only end up one game below .500. Coach Dennis Stark's swimmers won four of their last five meets to post a 6-3 record, but the Irish wrestlers, hurt by injuries and a thin roster lost three of their last five and finished 
6-8. ' The ND fencers, despite tough losses to Detroit and .Wayne State, rallied to finish 6-2, and the Iacross and rugby clubs posted fall marks of B­3 and 11-2 respectively. Coach Don Faley's track squad had its problems this year, going 0-3 in indoor competition, and only consistently strong performances by hurdler Tom McMannon, weightman Bill George, and
