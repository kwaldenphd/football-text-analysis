Communists shell "Frontier City" 
SAICON (UI'I) -Communists bombarded a U.S. infantry camp ncar the Cambodian border with mortar fire yesterday but did not renew a ground assault that cost them 214 dead in the first attack. 
Military spokesmen said commanders of the 25th Infantry Division outpost known as "Frontier City" called in artillery, helicopter gunships and jet fighter support Sunday to silence enemy guns after they had pumped 15 mortar rounds into the camp. Patrols

French say "non" to ''God''Bolivian President killed In crash 
LA PAZ, Holivia (UPI) -President Rene Barrientes Ortuno, whose army crushed the guerrilla forces led by the late Erncsto Che Guevara, was killed yesterday when his helicopter crashed outside his hometown of Cochabamba in the Bolivian interior. 
Radio Condor said Barrientos' helicopter crashed when it hit a power line outside of Cochabamba, about 200 miles southeast of the capital. /lis aide, Lt. Leo Orellana, was accompanying him and also was killed. 
A spokesman for the presidential palace confirmed the president's death shortly after the semiofficial Radio Condor broadcast the announcement. 
Barrientos was an accomplished pilot, but government officials could not confirm whether he was at the controls of the aircraft when it crashed.

BELFAST, Northern Ireland (UPI)-The final contingent of an airlift of 550 British troops from London arrived Sunday to reinforce British forces already based here in guarding the country's utility and communications centers.

DeGaulle's announcement said his resignation would be effective as of noon Monday. 
According to the French Con­stitution, DeGaulle will be suc­ceeded immediately by French Senate President Alain Poher, 60 year old leader of the Center Party. 
The 78 year old general informed France his day-and its day-had come with these terse words: 
"I am ceasing to exercise the functions of the president of the Republic. 
"This decision takes effect at 
midday today Monday."  
Thus,  in  20  words,  Charles  
deGaulle  again  stepped  out  of  
the  hurly  burly  of  French  

political life as he had done shortly after World War II and ended the DeGaulle reign in France which began in May of I 958. Then, he came forth from retirement from this same estate to lead France out of the bitter rivalries of the Algerian rebellion and to build his Fifth Republic 
on the political ruins of the 
fourth. 
The issue upon which DeGaulle fell was, technically, a vote for or against his Constitutional reform plan. Broadly, it would have stripped the French Senate of political power, decentralized the nation into about 21 parity auto­nomous regions and, in all, revised about one third of the Constitution's lesser provisions. 
But many Frenchmen did not even understand fully the pros and cons of these issues and for the entire nation this was a vote for or against continuation of DeGaulle's power. The general made it so Friday night when he told them in what proved to be his last nationwide television appeal: 
"If I am disapproved solemnly by the majority of yourselves on this capital subject . . . my present task as chief of state will clearly become impossible and J will immediately stop carrying out my functions." 


HPC hears report 
Pete Kelly, Notre Dame's Community Relations Director, told hall presidents last night of his plans to involve individual halls in South Bend community 
service projects. Kelly, speaking at the HPC's weekly meeting in the student center amphitheatre, described the hall's role in the Community Action Corps he is organizing. 
The corps will consist of three divisions: a Volunteer Service Bureau, a Community Organ­izing Committee, and a Student Action Committee. The Volun­teer Service Bureau, which will concern the halls most, will be the first division set up. 
It will coordinate community service projects by handling pub­licity and recruitment of volun­teers. Kelly asked that the hall presidents, with the assistance of section leaders, keep the resi­dents informed of current pro­jects. 
He also asked that the presi­dents choose a representative for each project with whom volun­teers can sign up. The presidents must keep in touch with Notre Dame's Volunteer Service Bureau which, in turn, will re­main in contact with the volun­teer service bureau downtown. 
"We'd like to involve the halls as much as possible because we'd like to sec them establish an individual identity with the South Bend Community," Kelly said. 
Among the projects with which the bureau will deal are neighborhood study help, mental health groups, Big Bro­ther, and nursing home visits. 
THE OBSHR Vt'R will no longer be available in the morning durinx the Continental breakfast due to the one hour time discrepancy between Niles and South Bend.

Outraged housewife Editor: I know full well that one cannot reach you through wn­scicnce, through an ordinary ap­peal to ordinary decency, or, least of all, through the 6th or 9th commandments. All those things have long ceased to have any "relevance" (oh, poor mis­used, abused, overused word!) for such as you. But there comes a time when someone simply has to risk your ridicule, your scorn and say what is in one's heart. I am a mother of five child­ren, three boys, two girls. We live ncar the university and my husband teaches there. We have taught our children that they possess the great gift of sex among other marvelous gifts. We have told them that it is indeed a wonderful and beautiful gift ... in fact, a sacred trust. Never have we permitted anyone of them to feel that there is any­thing unpleasant, dirty or shame­ful about sex. 

We have also taught them to love the Mother of Jesus and to honor her for her womanliness, her compassion, her strength, and her motherhood. 
Now I find that my daughters, uged 9 and 6, cannot walk on the campus of Our Lady un­attended hy either one of their parents, or at least one of their brothers. They neither under­stand nor enjoy the remarks that pour out of the windows. They arc just little girls, but they somehow sense the meaning of the remarks and they feel un­comfortable without even know­ing exactly why. The porno­graphy conftrence was a sad sad event for our family . . . an opportunity to explain some things to the children ... but a sad and even heartbreaking event for us. 
I take exception to your ad for NODOZ in the April 21 issue. I take exception to your flippant attitude toward sex. But most of all, I take exception to your hypocrisy. Under the words "The Observer" ... you have "serving the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College Com­munity." You serve all right ... but whom do you serve? There 

is a myth abounding that if one objects to the war and talks about love a lot, he is Christian and if he objects to porno­graphy, it follows that he does not object enough to war and hatred and is, therefore, not Christian. That is a lie. I object to the wanton destruction of life. I object just as much as to the wanton destruction of the life of a soul. 
One last observation. Mo~t of you will some day marry. You may have daughters. Think it over . . . is the world you arc bent on creating what you want for your daughters ... or for that matter ... your sons? 

Jeanne I. DeCelles I'.S. It just occurred to me ... is your problem perhaps arrested development'? Maybe your latrines were patrolle'd so care­fully when you were back in fourth grade that you were un­
able  to  express  yourselves  e­ 
nough  through  scatology  
then???

Anti-Giuseppe 

Editor: 
After reading of the recent difficulties the sophomore class en countered in its abortive attempt to conduct business with Giuseppe's, I would like to reiterate Class President Barry Doyle's warning to the student body that Giuseppe " ... might do this to someone else." lie 
already has. 
Last fall I had the misfortune of renting Giuseppe's party room for a week end dance­
party sponsored by the lnns­bru.ck Club, the International STudent Organization and the Pan-American Club. In this in­stance, too, Giuseppe gave the club officers the impression that no written contract was neces­sary. "It's like this, boys," he said. "! make a little money, the clubs make a little money, you all have a good time and every­one is happy. Everyone gets something." When asked about the possibility of a raid, he merely pulled out a deputy's badge anti winked. 
In successive meetings, how­ever, he voiced concern, both over the outbreaks of violence at other South Bend bars and over the presence of ABC inspectors in the city. lie finally stipulated that if we could get a police officer to watch the door he would be happy to rent the room to us. We were to contact him no later than the Wednesday evening before the party to make the final confirmations. Unfortunately, after publicizing the party and hiring the officer we were casually informed by Giuseppe on Wednesday evening that he had rented out the room to another group. This action alone was reprehensible enough, out on the evening of the can­celed party we discovered. that 
Giuseppe's room was vacant. 
In view of my experiences and the experiences of the sopho­more class, I can only say that Giuseppe's formula for business is at least self-fulfilling, if not entirely ethical ... "everyone gets something." We have all gotten ours, and it looks as if the 
sophomore boycott may finally give Giuseppe his.

Error costs N D sweep 
For the second weekend in a row the NO baseball squad has split a pair of games with their opposition. This time it was Western Michigan who divided the Friday-Saturday games, the Irish winning 5-2 at home on Friday and Western coming off with a victory at Kalamazoo, 7-6. 
The big star of the Irish win had to be sophomore Ron Schmitz. He relieved the Notre Dame ace, Jim Phelps, in the third inning with the bases loaded and nobody out. Schmitz then retired three men in a row without one Bronco touching the plate. However, Western did score on Phelps before he made 

his  exit.  Besides  this  brilliant  
fireman  performa nce,  Schmitz  
aided  his  cause  with  a  bases  

loaded double in the 4-run fourth inning for Notre Dame. The sophomore from Cleveland !snow 2-1 on the season. 
Rich Lucke was the leading hitter in the ball game with 3 hits in 4 appearances at the plate. One of his hits was a double. He had support from Schmitz, who had another safety aside from his big two-bagger, and Jim Gieselman who was 2 for 3 including a run producing triple in the seventh. 
The Broncos were held at bay, scoring single runs in the third and ninth innings. 
The game at Kalamazoo was an extra inning affair which the home team won in the eleventh inning on an errant throw by Irish shortstop Phil Krill. The error occurred with two outs and the bases jammed. There was a 3 and 2 count on the bat­ter, Dave Shoemake, and this 
permitted the runners to be go­ing with the pitch. This forced Krill to make the long throw from short and it was wide of its target. 
This was a heartbreaking defeat for the Irish who came from behind with a 4-run ninth to take the lead, 6-5 after trailing by 3. The lead didn't last long as Shoemake smashed an in­side the park homer for WMU. Shcemake was the hitting star of the day with a 4 for 5 afternoon. 

Sophomore Tom Sinnott 
suffered the loss after relieving 
Bob Arnzen in the ninth. This was Sinnott's first decision of the season. 
Leading hitters for the Irish were Tom Lux who had 2 hits in 5 trips plus 3 rbi's, and Rich Lucke and Arnzen who were both 2 for 4. John Schlukebir hit a towering home runfor the Broncos to give them their first run. 

ND scrimmage: offensive show 
Ara may not be able to "stop the snow'" as evidenced at seve­ral football games the past few falls, but he doesn't do too bad with the sunshine. 
After a week of unpredictable weather, the Irish were treated to a warm, sunny day for their second Saturday football scrim­mage. Seated in the stadium this week, the crowd watched as 73 points were totaled, some by the defense. 
The Joe Theismann-led Blues had it their own way for the early part of the work-out, scor­ing five times. Freshman Andy Huff accounted for two TO's with runs of seven and four yards. Ed Ziegler also scored from the seven and Theismann fired TO passes to fullback Jeff Zimmerman ( 14 yards) and Jim deArrieta, working at split end, (20 yards). 
Huff's second score came shortly after freshman defensive back Ed Gulyas returned a punt 60 yards. Gulyas was the crowd­pleaser of the day, even when in the coaches' doghouse. He set sail on another long punt return, but fumbled the ball at the twenty while in the clear. Jim Yoder, as punter the last line of defense, came over in time to have the ball bounce into his hands. He then went 30 yards back upfield. 
Yoder and Bill Etter quarter­backed a second team rally with Cieszkowski ran over, around, and through for a 12 yard TD after Theismann, on another pass to Zimmerman, and Ziegler scored again for the first team. 
The second team defensive backfield seems to need only experience. Clarence EIIis sup­plemented Gulyus' performance by taking a stolen Theismann pass 80 yards for a scorP.. If Ellis gets s step, it's going to take someone with more than two legs to catch him.
