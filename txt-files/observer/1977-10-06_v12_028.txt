Vol. XII, No. 28 Thursday, October 6, 1977 

SOUTH BEND* Ind. (AP)-Laetrile proponent Dr. Helen Calvin was pronounced dead but life support systems were left attached until her kidneys were removed for possible transplant. Dr. Calvin was a prac­ticing physician at the Notre Dame Infirmary through the Spring of 1976. 
St. Joseph County Deputy Coroner Louis Grwinski, who ruled the death a suicide due to de­pression, said the 49 year-old physician was ruled dead at 10:15 
a.m. after three doctors at Memorial Hospital agreed that her brain was dead. Brain wave tests had shown no signs of life in two days, he said. 
Grwinski said the physical cause of death was massive brain damage due to loss of blood. 
Later yesterday, surgeons re­moved Dr. Calvin's kidneys. In 1972, she had donated her body to the Indiana University Medical 
Dept. book budgets 'relatively small' 
Former NO physician commits suicide 
by Patrick Cole Special Projects Editor 

Editor's note: This is the third article of a four-part series examin­ing the availability of books in the Memorial Library to students in the Notre Dame-St. Mary's commu­nity. Today's story will deal with how books are ordered. Tomor­row's story will illustrate the plans and ideas concerning the improve­ment of the library. 
In this age of the "knowledge explosion," new information is being learned and published at unprecedented levels. The Notre Dame Library has the task each year of bringing in new books to the University libraries. 
The ordering of new books is done by the collection development department. Maureen L. Gleason, responsible for book requests, said that from July 1976 to June 1977, the library ordered 16,560 new books. 
The collection development department did not exist until October 1974. But the department is responsible for ordering books that are used for teaching faculties and specialized works for research. 
Gleason said that money for books is divided up by depart­ments. "But the budgets are relatively small," she indicated. "But I'm involved in the ordering of books, not the selection of them.'' 
The total fund for the purchase of books is $600,000. This includes money for periodicals, serials and subscriptions. Is the money enough? ''Some departments run out of money and we have to return the orders,'' Gleason said. 
For the Department of English, the book budget has been $11,000 to $12,000, according to Prof. Edward Vasta, the department chairman. But, he adds, the English department's book budget was $14,500 per year from 1967 to 1972. 

Does the decrease of $2,000­$3,000 still leave enough money for the department? "Right now, we have enough money to buy only about one-third of the books that we ought to be buying," Vasta said. "That has hurt us a great deal. So it really takes three years to buy the books that should have been bought in one year, and when you do buy those, you have another two years to catch up with'', he added. 
Gleason revealed that the library receives special collections of 
books. Collections usually contain· valuable books or specialized works in a given subject. "But collections are negotiated by the Universtiy and the Library Administration," Gleason said. "They also have endowment funds and gift dona­
tion,'' she noted. ''And the library has been getting some of this. Some of this money goes to the purchased book fund. But no money comes out of the book fund for special collections.'' 
Among the collections ordered recently are the Sports and Games Collection, the Stevens Collection from the Episcopal Seminary in Philadelphia and the Cara Collec-· tion for research in the apostolate which includes African materials. 
Liaisons 

Gleason said that the faculty liaisons, usually a member of the library, suggests to a teaching department books to be ordered. Each liaison is assigned to a certain department in each college of the University. 
However, there are some draw­backs in the system. "I don't get much feedback from the depart­ments regarding books,'' remarked Stephen Hayes, a liaison for the departments of sociology and psy­chology. "With the psychology department, I have contact with them about every three months. With the sociology department, it's about once a month. But liaison work is relatively new,'' he con­cluded. 
Hayes explained that his basis of knowing what books to order is that ''he knows what books are used for courses." And, he said, "I know what books are used for teaching. I don't make distinctions between undergraduate and graduate stu­dents. A faculty member with· a research project has more expertise to order more specialized mate­rial." 
Some liaisons complain that at times books are ordered which are not needed. "Faculty members might be over-ordering for research," said one liaison. "The department's faculty liasons haven't been controlling what the people order,'' said a library staff worker. ''And in the past years, it's happened, too. The faculty will order stuff for their research but it is of no value to the students." 
If books are to be of any use to the students, they must have access to them, Hayes complains. "And if the studentdoesn't have the research skills, there should be a librarian there to help them. Students are lined up during final and you do~'t have the time to answer their questions in depth!' 
JnterUbrary loan 

What if any of the Notre Dame libraries do not have a book wanted by a faculty member or student? Books can be borrowed from other college· libraries through the inter­library loan department. Accord­ing to Carmela Kinslow, who is in charge of interlibrary loan, the department provides material for the faculty, students, Ph.D. candi­dates and Master's degree candi­dates. 
Eut Kinslow said the activities of the interlibrary loan department have been increasing lately. "There's been a gradual increase in the borrowing," she said. "I don't know whether this shows a deficiency, because we don't have the budget of a Harvard or a Yale.'' 
Interlibrary loan statistics show that by department, the English and history departments have had relatively high rates for loans. In the 1974-75 school year, the history department had 135 loans, the theology department had 122, and the English department had 118. In 1975-76, the Biblical Institute led all loaners with 184 requests and the economics department had 167. 
The history and English depart­ments followed with 166 requestl and 143 respectively. [continued on page 3] Center at Indianapolis. After determining that the kidneys were usable, they were transported to Indianapolis by Ronald Philo, chid of the organ transplantation section at Indianapolis' Veterans Admin­istration Hospital. Physicians at the medical c~nter wouldn't know if 
there ' are  appropriate  transplant  
recipients  untP  today,  Dr.  Philo  
said.  

The victim's husband, Dr. 0. Walter Calvin, charged that Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigations of his wife's cancer patients were among the factors that led to her fatal action last Friday. His wife had been de­pressed over marital problems, Dr. Calvin added, in addition to the pressure of working with tenninally ill cancer patients. 
She had been listed in critical conditions since being hospitalized Friday. Dr. Calvin told police he found his wife locked in the office at their home, her left wrist cut and bleeding. 

Dr. ·Helen Calvin An FDA spokesman said a series of interviews conducted with Mrs. Calvin's laetrile patients were rou.­tine and were not an attempt to remove her license. "Everything she had done was totally legal," he said. "There were no prosecution efforts against her by the FDA that I know of.'' Paul Ragan, a FDA attorney, said he was distressed at the news of Mrs. Calvin's condition, adding, "She was one ofthe few physicians who sincerely believed in laetrile. She was not motivated by the chance of amassing grP.at wealth like many other doctors,·' 'who, are administering the purported anti cancer substance, n he said. _ Ragan's remarks came in re­sponse to claims by Dr. Calvin that the FDA probes were efforts to gather evidence aimed at revoking his wife's medical license. Ragan admitted FDA agents have been contacting Dr. Calvin's patients, but said such interviews were for the sole purpose of follovying court directed procedures and to preclude the possibility of fraud in the importation of laetrile from Tiiuana, Mexico. The FDA lawyer said s~ch interviews have been conducted with laetrile patients through' out the country and that strong evi­dence of fraud has been found only on the West and East coast. "To our knowledge, no evidence of fraud has been uncovered in the midwest," Ragan said. Mrs. Calvin was openly import­ing laetrile from Mexico, contend­ing that federal court decisions 
gave her that right.  No challenge  
had been  made  to  Mrs.  Calvin'&  
claim.

Dillon-Grace battle causes extensive damage ' 
by Drew John Bauer Senior Staff Reporter 
The recent incident between Grace and Dillon Halls over Dil­lon's 'Go Big Red' flag was a "prank which turned into a major confrontation and caused extensive damage to University property," Bro. Just Paczesny, vice-president for Student Affairs, said yesterday. 
The conflict reached its peak Tuesday night when 250-300 "Dil­lonites' s stormed Grace in an attempt to recover their flag only to run into a barrage of roman candles and firecrackers thrown from the tower by Grace residents. 
Paczensy said that although "it is one thing to have normal pranks", it became a serious matter when Grace responded with "unlawful" firecrackers which he added, are prohibited in duLac. 
The battle ended early Wednes­day morning with Dillon recovering the flag that was stolen during the first half of Saturday's football game, from their tailgater. The flag was apparently taken by a 

History, english loans high 
[continued from page 1] 
Last year, the history and Eng­lish departments had the most loans. The history department had 196 requests and the English department followed with 148. 
Why do the English and history departments have such high request rates from the interlibrary loan department? Fr. Thomas E. Blantz, associate professor of his­tory, said the high interlibrary loan rate of the history department reflects the history department's library collection. "We lack the books we need, especially or gradu­ate level work," he said. "Most of the interlibrary loans would come from the graduate level or from faculty research.'' 
Prof. Edward Vasta, chairman of the English department, said he "was not surprised" that the department had one of the hi~hest 
Shakespeare play opens new season for theater group 
The Notre Dame -St. Mary's Theatre opens its 1977-78 season 
on Oct. 7 with Shakespeare's farce, A COMEDY OF ERRORS. The play based on Plautius' Manaechml will be presented in St. Mary's O'Laughlin Auditorium at 8 p.m. on October 7,8,13.13 and 15. 
A COMEDY OF ERRORS is Shakespeare's shortest play and his only real farce. The tangled plot involves two sets of twins in search of their lost brothers. 
The production is directed and the costumes are designed by Diana Hawfield. Hawfield directed Edward Albee's A DELICATE BALANCE last season. 
The set has been designed by scenographer David Weber, utili­zing the Festival Stage built for the Notre Dame -St. Mary's Summer Theatre season. Weber has also set-up the lighting for this produc­tion. 
The cast includes Patrick Marks and Matt McKenzie as the Anti­pholus twins, Sean Coleman and Dave Ellison as the Dromio twins, Michele Roberge as Adriana, Lisa Jaquez as Luciana, Theresa Riche­son as the Courtesan and Lisa Tun:o as Luce. 
Tickets are $2.50 each, $2.00 for students, faculty and staff of the Notre Dame -St. Mary's commu­nity. Season subscriptions are still available. For all ticket information

figures for loans. "The problems with interlibrary loan," Vasta con­tinued, " is that your only have the books for a short period of time. Professors must sit down and decide what order they must have, and when the books do come, they must find time to read them." 
"A lot of times," Kinslow said, ·"the book might take two months to get here." Tomorrow: plans and suggestions for improvement.

Grace resident. It resulted, how­ever, said one Grace staff member, in "hundreds of dollars worth of damage'' and several injuries due to firecrackers and glass frag­ments. 
Grace also said that the flag was turned over to Dillon because the hall rector, Rev. Splain, informed the hall that unless the flag was produced "right-away", the persons responsible for its theft would be suspended from the University. 
Additionally, Splain told The Observer Tuesday night that "due to the circumstances", he could not hold Dillon responsible and that Grace would pay the costs of any damages. He also said that Grace would then try to collect the cost from the people directly involved in the flag's theft. 
Paczesny stated that Dean of Students James Roemer will soon be in contact with both hall staffs ''to seek solutions to these juvenile activities''. Roemer was not avail­able for comment last night on whether disciplinary action will be taken by the University against anybody involved. Two Dillonites received minor

fifth-floor Grace resident received a cut on his face when a stone shattered his window. None of the injuries recquired any medical attention. 
Among the injured was Paczes­ny, who said that he was punched by a student in Grace while asking that student to return to his room. "He wouldn't move, so I asked him for his l.D. and he struck me instead.'' 
Although Paczesny said that he could not catch the student after being struck, he did comment that "I have a good memory of his face." He would not state what action would be taken against the student if he was caught. 
The battle was the last of several incidents on Tuesday. Earlier, four men wearing disguises and bran­dishing electric hair dryers kid­napped Jerome Castellini, Grace Hall president, from a Hall Presi­dents Council meeting. He was taken to a waiting motor vehicle and carried off to an undisclosed room in Dillon. 
Sources said that Castellini watched the Phillies-Dodgers baseball playoff game while Dillon was trying to negotiate a trade for the flag with Grace. . However a problem arose when Grace inform­ed Dillon that they could keep Castellini, who they said was less. important than the flag. · 
the Dillon Hall Council th~n ~ voted and decided eight to four toI release Castellini under the condi-i tions that either the flag bef returned or that Grace would payi Dillon SSO if it was destroyed. Castellini accepted these condi-j 
tions a Dillon section leader said.  t  
Once Castellini was released,  
residents at Grace phoned Dillon  ·  
telling them that they would burn  
the flag at midnight. This promp­ 
ted, the leader said, a spontaneous  
gathering of approximately 80 per­ 
cent of the hall who went to Grace  
to try to recover the flag.  
Although there were several  
attempts to burn the flag, it was not  
burned seriously because it is made  
of nylon. However, it did have a  
couple of marks on it when it was  
returned to Dillon.  
Paczesny summed up the inci­ 
dent by saying that ''The student  
responsible for taking the flag  
should seriously examine his con­ 
science about the wanton destruc­ 
tion that took place because of his  
act."

A No-Frills Trip 
....iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiart bu c hw aId 
WASHINGTOl'l--President Carter intends to embark on an 11-day trip to eight countries on four conti­nents in late November. Some people are accusing the President of trying to get into the Gulnness Book of Records. But Zbigniew Brzezinski, Mr. Carter's National Security A divisor, insists that the trip makes sense and will enhance American foreign policy with coun­trie& that are playing an increas­ingly important role in world affairs. 
Titere i.,; another theory as to why the President is going to a11 these places and, while I couldn't pin it down, it makes more sense than the one advanced by Mr. Brzezin­ski. 
It seems the President only wanted to go to Brussels, but since he is so conscious about costs he had to include the other countries in his itinerary. 
Rumor has it that Andy Young, tbe ambassador to the U.N., carne into the Fresident's office and said, "I have good news for you, Mr. President. Under the new 'no-frills airline rates' you can fly to Brussels for $145 " 
''That li>Ounds great, Andy," the President said. 
''All ~·ou have to do is show up at the airpNl six hours in advance and bt; liste<.i on standby." 
''That seems reasonable," the President said. 
"Ifthe plane isn't full up you get a seat and fly to Caracas, Venezu­ela.'' 
"That seems to be a weird way to going to Brussels." 
"You have to stay 24 hours in Caracas and then fly to Brasilia in Brazil and remain there for 24 hours more.'' 
"And then go to Brussels?" the President asked. 
"No, then you fly to Lagos, Nigeria, for a 72-hour layover," Andy said. 
"All this for $145?" the Presi­dent asked. 
"It's a fantastic bargain," Andy told Mr. Carter. ''From Nigeria, the plane then goes to New Delhi 
for a 48-hour refueling stop."  
''And  from  there  it's  on  to  
Brussels?''  
"Not exactly.  You then fly  to  
Tehran for lunch."  

"Does the airline provide me with lunch?" 
"Not under the 'no-frills plan'. But the Shah of Iran will give you lunch in Tehran because he wants to encourage 'no-frills' airliners to land in his country.'' 
"What date will that be?" "November 29th." "Will they be showing the same 
movie on the entire flight?" the President wanted to know. "They don't say in their ads, but if you want to see a movie you'll 
have to pay $3.50 extra." 
"We'd better scrub the movie," 
the President said. "I'd rather 
have the $3.50 to spend in Bros. sels." 
"You won't be going to Brussels 
after Tehran. To get the benefit of 
the $145 fare you have to fly to 
Paris ftrst.'' 
"It could be worse," the Presi­
dent said. "They could have taken 
me to Poland." 
Andy looked embarrassed. 
"They are taking you to Poland. 
But it will only be for 24 hours. 
They have to drop off several 
people in Warsaw." 
''It sounds like a long flight.'' 
"Frankly, I don't know how they 
can do it for ~145, but the regular 
fare is $395 with taxes so we're 
saving $250. Now on December 
2nd you arrive in Brussels, but you 
can only stay for 24 hours.'' 
"There's no guarantee you can 
leave the next morning. You have 
to go back on standby for the return 
flight. But I was told that at this · 
time of year you won't have any 
trouble getting on the plane." 
"And that's the cheapest way I 
can go to Brussels?'' 
''I've checked out all the other 
charter planes and this is not only 
the least expensive but also the 
fastest way to get there." 
"You did a good job, Andy, and 
every taxpayer in America is proud 
of you." 


Might not always right 
Dear Edimr: 
Last summer The New York Times published an editorial endorshg the quota system used by the t'niversity of California to reject All<tn Bakke's application to its med .,chool, then openend up its editorial page to a spirited dis­cussion .r hat stand by its readers. 
The resv!· ,-,as that by a ratio of 15 to 1, the Umes' readers rejected the T'um!l~· logic. Now, 15 to 1 is a heavy m.·j(Wity in any case, and all the n.or.~ , , when you consider the ideologk:l --reciisposition of your averagt' 'h· ·.:.s reader. 
Thi:s · f:v \d not however, lead us to beiie-~ ':,;:at "might" necessarily "mal\e., t::·. ~t", any more than we should '-~. support the forced splitting ;,~) of tile oil companies becaU3t: · 'bg is bad." What we should learn is exactly the oppo­site; that is, that the taking of dogmatic positions on issues like reverse discrimination, busing, abortion, or anything else, is not only foolish and ill-advised, but can be down-right dangerous. 
Take the example of reverse discrimination. How much more sense does it make to say, ''Black, (or White? or Red? or Yellow?) is (in and of itselt) good," than it does to say, "Black is bad?" The New York Times says that there can be only "racial solutions" to "racial problems", yet does it follow that if a certain practice is plainly insane, its solution must be, too? Must a problem like bigotry be solved by more bigotry? 
Quota systems like the one used by the U. of California take a good idea (equal access of all to educa­tion) and twist it into a ''Policy to Atone for the Sins of the White Race during Four Centuries", an attitude which is neither fair nor historically correct. 
At a "liberal" Catholic univer­sity like Notre Dame, the official attitude requires that minority groups which have found favor with 
the liberal establishment be not only accepted as equals (as they should be), but that they be actively supported, whether you like it or not. You may argue that not eating lettuce in the dining halls from time to time is a small price to pay for advancing the cause of migrant workers, but it becomes quite another matter when a state-run (or private) university proposes to deny you admission to one of its professional schools to atone for the "sin" of being white. Let's hope the Supreme Court finds an acceptable solution to the problems of quotas before long, because if not we'll all be worse off.

I'd like to direct the focus of this artkle to the overwhelming dis­crepancy which exists between the images of, on the one hand, the Christian behavior pattern toward which one would expect graduates of a Catholic school to direct themselves-and, on the other, the well-known stereotype of the fat­cat upper middle class Notre Dame Alumnus. 
Undeniably, the stereotype in question is a gross generalization, an unfair and incorrect depiction of many worthy graduates. But equally apparent is the fact that the popular image of this bloated individual has not manifested itself into existence unaided by some valid reasoning. Anyone who has been here for any length of time has personally witnessed the highly 
·signiticant percentage of alumni, 
who too closely fit the mold with 
which we are concerned. 
Basking in the sunshing of their· wealth, their materialism, their over-consumerist tendencies, they conveniently manage to overlook the fact that their whole life-style is in direct contradiction to the most basic and fundamental Christian principles. Saving thousands of dollars each year while there are people who don't have money to eat; accumulating a multiplicity of assets while others don't have clothes or shelter from the rain; consuming barrels of fuel in the engagement of pleasurable pur­suits, while some have not a car, nor a bicycle, perhaps . not even shoes for themselves. It's difficult to reconcile such behavior with the dictate of "doing unto other." Doubtless, attempts will be made to rationalize it but we 'II leave it for persons so inclined to entertain us 
with  their  discourses  at  a  later  
date.  
A  hypocritical  group  of  alumni  

cannot, however, be held solely responsible for their actions. What they've become is only the natural outgrowth of belonging to hypocritical groups while members of the student body. A quarter in the milk jug outside the dining hall mushrooms into a ten dollar bill to support the struggling livelihoods 0f the bar owners. A two hundred dollar check from home somehow escapes the destiny cf Professor Danehy's legal aid fund, a down­town Christmastime Salvation Army bucket, or any number of needy individuals whose oppressed or simply unfortunate personages are usually not hard to locate via the news and human interest pages of papers and magazines. Instead, it inconceivably surfaces in the Treasury of the host travel agency for this year's spring vacation to Florida, or perhaps can be found in 
the  pockets  of  the  regional  
jeweler's  class  ring  sales  
representative.  

But it would be negligent here to ignore the signif..:!ant role in this charade admirably enacted by the models for our actions, the venerable and priestly among our faculty and administrators. You know, those individuals with the dormitory rooms two or three times larger than yours or mine.· And the refrigerator and TV and stereo and turntable and necessary stack of up-to-date albums. And the private bathroom and shower. You know. We might even want to mention those perpetrators of justice who habitually direct their subordinates to look the other way if he or she should somehow uncover one of those ingeniously camouflaged alumni kegs or tail­gater station wagons, strategically secreted throughout the stadium parking lot and Green Field on certain Saturday mornings. 
Not cheer, cheer, but alas, alas. alas....for old Notre Dame.

Latin American study program expanding 
Maureen Sajbel Senior Staff Reporter 
The Latin American Program for Experiential Learning (LAPEL) differs from other Notre Dame foreign programs in many ways. It 
is  a  year  of  learning  not  solely  
based  on  academic  studies,  but  
also  on  living  with  Spanish  
speaking  people,  working  in  a  

service capacity and getting in­volved with the problems of the Third World. 
"Anyone who has an interest in making a commitment in working with people, living a simple life and exploring social justice would find this a very interesting year," according to Pat Cimino, a member of the 1975-76 LAPEL group. 
Fr. Don McNeill, C.S.C. director of LAPEL, has opened the 1978-79 program to interested under­graduates from Notre Dame and St. Mary's. This year's program is based in Peru but, McNeill ex­plained, the program could hope­fully be expanded to include Panama, Mexico and Southern Texas. 
LAPEL began in the fall of 1974 at Notre Dame and the first group of 
.students went to preparatory 
classes in Spanish and Latin 
American studies that spring. Six 
students participated in the 1975­
76 program and five in the 1976-77 
program in Santiago, Chile, and 
Chimbote, Peru. These students 
were under the supervision of 
members of the Holy Cross con­
gregation. 
The program was termed a ''year off' at the time it was under the guidance of Volunteer Services and because students did not receive college credit. The program this year in Lima, Peru, includes three Notre Dame students, Tim Beaty, Michael Haggerty and Mary Kathleen Hawley, and has been transfered experimentally to the Committee of Academic Progress in the College of Arts and Letters. 
These students will receive 15 credits for year-long directed reading courses with Notre Dame professors and will pay the equiv-
Assertion training groups forming 
Two assertion training/ con­sciousness raising groups are cur­rently being formed for St. Mary'sstudents. Each group will exploresuch topics as the difference be­tween nonassertion, assertion, and aggressi~n; identifying and e~pres­smg basic human nghts; and tdent­ifying and overcommg self-defeat­
thoue:ht and behavior patterns. 
Participants in each gi~up will have numer?us opportumttes . to evaluate thetr present asserttve skills, and to learn new ones, in an overall supportive context. 
Each group will meet once a week for six weeks, with each session lasting approximately two hours. One grOl!P will meet on Wednesday from J _p.m. to 5 p.m. 
and will be led by Suzanne Areson of the Counseling Department. 
The other group wlll meet on Mondays at the same time and will be led bv Joe Miller of the Psycho­logy Department. The Wednesday group wil begin October 12 and the Monoay group will begin October 
10. 
To reserve a place in either group or to get aamtional informa­tion, contact Mrs. ~pt at 4835 or stop bY.165 LeMans Hall. Students must sign up by Thursday, October 6.

alent of one semester's tuition, room, and board plus approxi­mately $300 for transportation expenses. "The status of the 1978-79 program in Peru is uncertain now," stated McNeill, ''but it is hoped that the program will continue as it is ~et up this year." 
McNeill stressed that the year was based on "experiential learning in Latin America," and that students work in a "sharing-learning" atmosphere. In past years students have worked with exceptional children, taught English in grade 
schools  and  worked  in  food  
programs for the poor.  
The  academic  facet  of  the  

program includes workshops dealing with the theology of the Church, seminars on human rights,

To apply for next year's program, McNeill encourages interested students to attend an informational meeting Monday, Oct. 10, at 7 p.m. in Ministry West Office on the ground floor of Badin Hall.

that an employer does not have to include pregnancy disabilky pay­
ments in a health insurance program offering protection for numerous other disabilities. 
A 6-3 majority of the justices found that pregnancy discrimi­nation is not necessarily illegal discrimination based on sex. 
That reasoning both mystified and enraged womens' groups. Despite the protests of feminists for two 
hours Wednesday the court was
urged to again apply that rationale. 
An attorney for one of the women, Mary Dunlop of San Francisco, argued that past court rulings had maintained "200 years of discrimi­nation against women" in education. 
"First, it was aimed at all women,
then at married women, and now at 
pregnant women," she said.

prospects of a court victory, in the wake of the GE case, are dim.

Lecture explores Tut's tomb 
by Jana Schutt 
Howard Hall Academic Commis­sion sponsored a lecture Tuesday at 7 p.m. Prof. Robert Leader spoke to the group on the discovery of the treasures of King Tutankh­amen. His lecture was accomp­anied by a slide presentation. 
For quite some time the English­speaking world has been intrigued with the pharaohs of Egypt and their tombs. Prof. Leader brought the discovery of one of these tombs to life through his presentation. 
King Tut' s tomb is located in the Valley of the Kings, about five miles from the Nile River. There are sixty-two other such tombs known to be in the Valley, but Tut's is the only one ever found intact. All of the others had been ran­sacked by thieves before archaeolo­gists arrived. 
An Englishman, Lord Car­narvon, sponsored an expedition to Egypt in 1916. He took Howard Carter, an American, with him. It was Carter's idea to dig beneath a group of ancient workers' huts. Here they found stone steps lead­ing down to a sealed door. 
All tombs in Egypt are subterra­nean. The workers had to clear rubble away from sixteen steps and thirty-two feet of passageway before they encountered a second sealed door. Behind this Carter and his assistants found an ante­chamber full of treasures, but no 
mummy.  Surprisingly  nothing  
seemed to have  been taken  by  
thieves.  

In the antechamber, the men found a third sealed door guarded by two larger-than-life statues. On Feb. 17, 1923, this door was opened to reveal a shrine 17xllx9 
of solid gold. 
Three smaller shrines were found inside the first. All of solid gold, they grew increasingly 
smaller until the last was filled by a huge stone sarcophagus. This coffin in tum held three gold coffins. In the last of these was the body of King Tut. He was a boy-king, about 18 years old. It is now believed that he was assas­sinated by a blow on the head. The treasures of Tut have trav­
elled from Moscow to Chicago. Their intrinsic value is estimated at $25 million. 
Lastly, Prof. Leader refuted the "curse of the kings" which is a myth concerning Egyptian tombs. It was believed that those who disturbed the sleep of the pharaohs would die, but Howard Carter lived to tell the story of Tut's tomb.

Father Hesburgh will present his annual address to the faculty and staff of the University at 4:30 p.m. Monday, October 10, in Washing­ton Hall.

Devine responds to controversy 
Jim Brennan Sports Writer 
A good crowd showed up Tuesday night, at 8 p.m. in Pangborn Hall, to hear Coach Dan Devine, Willie Fry and Terry Eurick, speak and answer questions. 
The overall tone of the assembly was very cordial and at many times, humorous, as the three speakers joked around a lot with the crowd. 
Coach Devine started out by commenting on future Notre Dame schedules. including next year's, which starts out against Missouri and Michigan. He said that the schedules are hard, but that any game Notre Dame plays is not easy. "I've been a head coach in the Big Eight, and I know it's as easy to get a team ready to play Notre Dame, as it is to play Nebraska or Oklahoma for a Big Eight championship.'' 
He also said that last year, the Irish played more teams that won seven or more games than any Notre Dame team in the past 20 years. Notre Dame was the only team in the country to play both of 
,. the top two teams, Pitt and USC. 
Mentioning that Notre Dame must travel South two more times this season, Devine stated that many people do not realize the problem
i. that the change in climate pre­
sents. Several years ago USC came in here for the last game of the season. It was very cold and they lost big. Since then, the Trojans refuse to play Notre Dame here late in the year. Devine commented, "We face the same situation when we go out there at the end of the season.'' 
Devine talked about the players' dedication and willingness to play with injury, and also of the team Mass before each game, which he said is a big part of Notre Dame football. ''I wouldn't trade this Notre Dame experience for any­thing in the world" Devine said. "This is one of the closest-knit teams that I've had. When they're freshman, you teach them your ideas on life in general, and when they are seniors, they can run the squad. 
Eurick commented on the fans 
booing  Rusty  Lisch.  He  said,  
"Rusty hasn't said  a  word  about  
the situation, but continues  to go  

out and practice 30 minutes early every day. The community here is what makes Notre Dame what it is, and when the fans start booing players, then it gets to be like 'Podunk U!., 
Coach Devine then began to talk of the harm of rumors and mis­quotes. There was a rumor going around that Notre Dame had lowered its admission require­
ments. This rumor, according to Devine, is false. Devine also explained how one of our players missed Notre Dame's requirements by 1/100 of a grade point average last year and had to sit out, even .though he met the requirements 
set by the NCAA. 
Devine brought up the Notre 
Dame-Southern Cal game in 1974, 
which USC won by exploding in the 
second half. There was rumor that 
there was a fight in the Notre Dame 
locker room at halftime. "I wasn't 
there at the time, but I remember 
reading it in the paper. It really 
upset me, because I was sure that 
this didn't happen. It was just 
something that someone made up. 
Things like this really hurt 
recruiting, and the people that 
make them up would be sorry if 
they knew this." 
About the Michigan State game, 
Devine remarked, "The game is 
not the same 20 rows up as it is on 
the sidelines. You can see the pain 
and effort on the field, and the 
determination 9n the players' 
faces. I was happy and proud that 
we won, even though I was 
dissatisfied with ourfumbles and 
mistakes.'' He told a reporter 
after the game that he was satis­
fied, and then a writer in Miami 
decided to write a big story on how 
he was satisfied with the mistakes. 
Devine said that in his years of 

coaching, his teams have either lead the nation in fewest penalties or fumbles. Dave Mitchell, who fumbled in the Michigan State game, had torn ligaments earlier in the year and doctors said he would never play again. He had very little actual contact before the game, and now he's playing while the injuries to other backs are piling up. 
Coach Devine will receive a Pangborn golf shirt later this week, which he said he would wear at the next home game.

Monte Towle Trivia 
Towle's Rags 
Throughout my four years as a student at Notre Dame, I have met many students and professors who not only share a great interest in the world of sports, but also possess a strong working knowledge of sports and athletes in general. In this sense. Notre Dame is quite unique among colleges and universities in the United States. In fact. if there were such a thing as a national sports trivia contest between student bodies of colleges and universities. 1 am sure that Notre Dame would come out on top. 
Do you consider yourself a sports trivia expert? Do you long for that chance where you can someday show off your sports knowledge in front of thousands? Do you have enough confidence in yourself and your sports knowledge to match wits with the likes of Bill Mazer. Dick Enberg or even Howard Cosell? Well, here's your chance to prove yourself. Let's cover some of the more popular areas of sports trivia often raised in discussions. 
I don't claim to be an expert myself but always find it enjoyable to try my knowledge against anyone. One of my favorites concerns a pitcher who recently retired with more than 200 career victories although he never had a 20-win season. He pitched for teams such as Baltimore, Philadelphia and the Chicago Cubs among others. He even pitched a no-hitter. 
And speaking of pitchers, one remembers Jim Bunning and the perfect game he threw for the Phillies against the Mets in 1964. The last batter he retired was Johny Stephenson who was pinch-hitting for someone else. Who? 
lJnifoqn numbers are always popular. So, try this one. In 1963, both MVP"s in the major baseball leagues, the NFL MVP and the 
A~L  MVP all  wore  the  same  uniform  number.  What  was  the  
number and what are their names?  
What numbers did the former  athletes wear?  Don Merdidith,  

Dallas Cmvboys quarterback; Jerry West, L.A. ~Laker guard; Dick Hutkus. Chicago Bear linebacker; Bill Russell. Basten Celtic center; And Jean Beliveau. Montreal Canadien center. 
It's always interesting to try and place athletes with the colleges they attended. Try guessing what colleges the following football and basketball players went to: Jo Jo White. Bosten Celtic guard; Roger Stauback, Dallas Cowboys quarterback; Ken Stabler. Oakland Raider quarterback; Johnny Neumann, Buffalo braves; and Lou Hudson. now with the L.A. Lakers. 
Can y0u name the starting lineup for the 1965 Minnesota Twin team that won the American League pennant? The shortstop was the A.L. MVP that year. If you can't get that one then try to name fl,ur great running backs who came out of Syracuse University. 
Who was on deck when Bobby Thomson hit his pennant-clinching homer for the New York Giants in 1951? Who was on the Mound? What was this pitcher's uniform number? Who was the Giant's third base coach at the time? Who really cares? 
Name the AFL quarterback that once passed for over 4,000 yards in one season? What team did Wilt Chamnberlain once score 100 points again::t in an NBA game? Who was the first NHL player to score 50 goals during the regular season? 
The answers to these and multitudes of other sports trivia questions continue to be a popular source of debate among sports fanatics. especially here at Notre Dame. What is your favorite trivia question? Well. send it to me in the mail along with the answers to these questions and I'll print the best ones next week. My address is 1127 Grace so I hope you responrl to this challenge. 
St. Mary's tennis team trounces Notre Dame women, 8-1 
by Laurie Reising Women's Sports Editor 

It was not exactly ideal tennis playing weather yesterday after­noon, but that did not hamper St. Mary's team as they soundly defeated the Notre Dame squad 8-1. 
The St. Mary's players must have found the chilly 55 degrees invigorating, for they looked excep­tionaly quick and in control of their games. In the first singles match, St. Mary's Noreen Bracken, filling in for Barb Timm, did an admirable job downing Mary Shukis of Notre Dame 7-6,6-4. 
Bracken has been playing in the fourth and fifth positions but Coach Cathleen Cordes felt "she had the mental stamina to take over for the afternoon." Cordes praised the sophomore saying, "She was up against the best and proved she could handle it.'' 
Veteran Louise Purcell had to go three· sets before she finally put away Paddy Mullen 6-1,3-6,6-0. Meanwhile freshman teammate Cindy Shusta was breezing to a 6-3,6-0 triumph over Jean Barton. 
Fourth singles action was equally dismal for Notre Dame as Irish captain Diane Shillingburg lost a

Notre Dame to host tennis tournament this weekend 
Patrick Smith Sports Writer 

The fifth annual Notre Dame Invitational tennis tournament will be held this Friday through Sunday, October 7-9. Six schools will take part in the round-robin tourney which is scheduled to get underway Friday at 9:00a.m. at the Courtney Tennis Center behind the Athletic and Convocation Center. Competing in the event will be Southern Illinois, Indiana, Oral 
Roberts,  Miami  of  Ohio,  Illinois  
State and the host Irish.  
Coach  Tom  Fallon  is  looking  

forward to the tournament which he believes will be a good indicator of how the Irish will fare this year. "This tournament will be a tough test," Coach Fallon pointed out, "we're up against awfully good teams." "We are also anxious to see how our three starting fresh­man will perform." 
Notre Dame has captured team honors in the fall classic three years in a row, including its victory in 1976. Coach Fallon anticipates a strong balance down the line of his singles players. Sophomore Carlton Harris will hold down the number-one position while fr~shman Herb Hopwood will fill the second slot for the Irish. 
Fallon is counting heavily on junior Marty Horan and sophomore Tom Westphal who wilt be playing in the third and fourth positions respectively. Freshmen Mark Hoyer and Kevin Ghandi, along with senior Steve Barret and junior Jimmy Kelly, will fill the remaining four spots._ 
Fallon is also quite optimistic about his three doubles teams. The pairs will include Harris and Horan, Ghandi and Hoyer, and the duo of Westphal and Hopwood. ''We will be experimenting with our doubles combinations," Coach Fallon stated, "to see how the partners perform together." 
Conventional scoring methods for doubles matches in this week's tourney will be replaced by eight­game pro sets to allow for near simultaneous conclusion of all matches. _For singles matches, the no-add sys.'em will be used. 
cross country 

The Interhall cross country meet will be held Tuesday, October 11 at 4:30p.m. on Burke Memorial Golf Course. Participants should pre­sent proof of insurance to the Interhall Office or report to fairway number two by 4:15 p.m. prior to the meet.
