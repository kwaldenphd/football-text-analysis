Clinton, Brown trade criticism before New York primary 
NEW YORK (AP) Democrats Bill Clinton and Jerry Brown traded a final bar­rage of charges Monday but then shook hands on the final day of campaigning before high-stakes primaries in New York, Wisconsin and Kansas. 
"This is now for the voters to decide," said Clinton. "We each argue that we have better plans for change." 
Both candidates said Paul Tsongas, who dropped out of the race three weeks ago, could receive a substantial number of votes in New York, the biggest prize in Tuesday's balloting with 244 delegates. 
The state is crucial for both active candidates: front-runner Clinton is looking for a convinc­ing win to diminish the signifi­cance of Brown's challenge; Brown wants a good showing to affirm his status as a serious candidate. 
New York has proved a rough-and-tumble battleground over the last two weeks. Every point of contention has been magnified by the aggres!"ive Manhattan media as the candi­dates jockeyed for support among fractious voting blocs including blacks, labor, and Jewish voters. 
Pollster Lee Miringoff of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion called it a close contest, with Clinton slightly ahead and an unusually high 20 percent of voters still unde­cided. 
"I think, at this point, Clinton has to have a very good day to reach 50 (percent)," Miringoff said. "That's because it's be­come a 2 1/2-person race" when Tsongas is taken into consideration. 
Tsongas, the former Massachusetts senator, sus­pended his campaign nearly three weeks ago but is urging people to vote for him and ap­pears to be toying with a re-en­try. Over the weekend, he 

Aspin.discusses U.S. nuclear policy after disintegration of Soviet Union 
By MEREDITH McCULLOUGH 
Assistant News Editor 
The break up of the Soviet Union coupled with recent polit­ical change in Eastern Europe has resulted in a new world order that has altered the United States' interest in and strategies concerning nuclear weapons, according to Representative Les Aspin (D­Wis.). 
Within the past few years the nuclear threat to the U.S. has changed from a large scale in­tentional attack by singular, rational, well-known enemy to smaller scale, possibly acciden­tal, attacks by multiple, un­known, irrational opponents, according to Aspin, Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. 
Aspin addressed the impact of these international shifts, newly 
promised an announcement on Wednesday. 
Clinton, after amassing a huge delegate lead last month with victories on Super Tuesday and then in Michigan and Illinois, was forced to take Brown on after the former California governor squeaked past him in Connecticut's pri­mary and added victories in Vermont and Alaska. 
Overall, Clinton has 1,078 delegates to 439 for Tsongas and 165 for Brown. 
Brown called the New York race "very close" but sought to lower expectations. "We'd like one more vote than the other side but anything the voters give us will give us the encour­agement to go on," he said. 
At a statehouse rally in Albany where a number of Tsongas signs bobbed in the crowd, Brown said a vote for him would send the signal, "Get off the dime, Washington, we want a country that works for 

Les Aspln 

raised security issues and proposed policy for dealing with such change in a lecture Monday, titled "Challenges for 
U.S. Security in the Post-Cold War Era." 
The discussion was a keynote speech for the second day of the conference "From START to Finish? The Future of Nuclear 
all of us." 
Clinton and Brown went head-to-head Monday in a tele­vised mini-debate on NBC's "Today" show to start their final day of campaigning. 
Brown jabbed at Clinton for playing golf at an all-white club, saying it "validates institutional racism." That drew an angry retort from the Arkansas governor, who then swiped at Brown on race issues, too. 
"Jerry Brown knows I'm not racist," Clinton said. "I have demonstrated in a Southern climate all my life a deep commitment to civil rights and equal opportunity." 
Clinton then recalled a 1975 remark Brown made, quoting the former California governor as saying, "We ought to let the white kids teach the black kids to read, the black kids teach the white kids to fight.' That was a horrible thing for him to say. I did not run a television ad on it." 
Security· Issues." 
Since 1988, the Soviet Union has undergone dramatic gov­ernmental·changes that have eradicated two main threats to 
U.S. security, said Aspin. 
When former president Mikail Gorbachev began to withdraw Soviet forces from Eastern Europe in 1988, "a message went out to Eastern Europe that the Soviet Union would no longer back up the puppet gov­ernments in Eastern Europe with military forces," said As pin. 
This action encouraged re­formers to challenge their gov­ernments and ultimately re­sulted in the dissolving of the Warsaw Pact, he said. 
The second threat was dis­pelled in Dec. of 1991 with the resignation of Gorbachev, fol­lowed by the virtual disappear-

AP 

MOSCOW (AP) -President Boris Yeltsin won an initial vic­tory in the Russian Congress on Monday by keeping a no-confi­dence vote off the agenda, but opponents said they would continue trying to reduce his powers. 
Yeltsin clearly did not have firm control over the 1,046­member Congress of People's Deputies, meeting this week for the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union last December. 
The Congress appeared to be about evenly divided between supporters of Yeltsin and op­ponents, mainly former Communists, who want to slow his economic reforms, force his Cabinet to resign and adopt a constitution that removes his broad decree-making powers. 
Yeltsin said Sunday he might "correct" some of his reforms, hinting at wage and price con­trols, but he said it would be "suicide" to transfer power to parliament because it would cripple the transition to a free market. 
Yeltsin is in no danger of los­ing the presidency. But he could be pushed -either during or after the Congress -into giving up his post as prime minister and thoroughly revamping the Cabinet that he lightly shuffled last week. 
Monday's voting gave no clear sign which way the Congress would go. 
The parliamentary opposition, an uneasy alliance of former Communists and rebellious members of Yeltsin 's own reformist camp, lost their effort to put a no-confidence motion on the week's agenda by a vote of 412 to 447. 
But they won a straw vote forcing Yeltsin to give a report Tuesday on the painful eco­nomic reforms he began Jan. 2. 
Their goal was to associate Yeltsin, who remains Russia's most popular politician, with the reforms, which are unpopu­
lar because they have sent prices skyrocketing without putting more goods on the shelves. 
Presidential adviser Galina Starovoitova said she was heartened by the first day's voting and predicted Yeltsin would emerge with his powers intact. 
But another adviser, Sergei Shakhrai, said "the first round went to the opposition." 
Opposition leaders said they would introduce a resolution condemning Yeltsin's govern­ment, and possibly try again for a no-confidence vote, after his economic report. 
Unlike a formal vote of no­confidence, which would force the formation of a new Cabinet, a condemnation of Yeltsin's re­port would merely increase pressure on him to slow his re­forms and change his top min­isters. 
Parliament Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov, leader of the drive to limit Yeltsin's powers, wants to vest more power in the Congress and smaller Supreme Soviet legislature, which meets more often. 
He opened the session in the Grand Kremlin Palace by warn­ing that "social and political tensions prevailing in nearly the entire country threaten to bring us to a collapse." 
"We can afford no unconsti­tutional methods. We need dia­logue rather than monologue. We need a compromise. The president needs it more than anyone else. The nation needs it," Khasbulatov said. 
Yeltsin said he needed his ex­traordinary powers for another two or three years to pursue his reforms. 
He watched with a somber and sometimes sour expression, speaking only once, when he tried to get Congress to allow an adviser to read the economic report. 
"I had planned to address the Congress on the whole complex of issues: economic, social, political, national and constitu­tional, not to take the floor several times," Yeltsin pleaded. "I am not trying to escape." 
The lawmakers voted his proposal down. 
Yeltsin supporters responded to their defeat by calling Khasbulato·v a potential "dictator" and seeking a vote of no-confidence in the speaker. But lawmakers easily kept that off the agenda, by a vote of 793 to 115. 
The Congress, the highest legislative body in Russia, was elected in March 1990, and more than half its members are former Communists.

INSIDE COLUMN 



tudy days need to be reviewed 
During the campaign for Student Body President and Vice-President and again in the March 26 issue of Scholastic, Greg Butrus and Molly O'Neill promised to give students an extra two study days 


before finals. To do this, MIKE SCRUDATO 
they probably will end up 

trying to have the last two Sports Editor 
days of classes cancelled. 
This proposal is ludicrous. 

The final week of classes, especially the final two days, are essentially a review for final exams. If these two days of class are cancelled, professors would not cut anything from their syllabi except for the review on the last day o class. 
I know that I would benefit a lot more by going to classes and giving my professors a chance to discuss the final than from studying on my own. 
That is if I even studied all day on the Thursday before finals. If I spent four straight days doing nothing but studying, I would have a nervous breakdown before I took my first final. 
To prevent doing so I would probably do nothing except play Sega or Nintendo and party until at least Saturday. 
I would rather do these things during summer vacation when I could look back on my fond memories of finals week than trying to veg out with the nervous anticipation of finals looming in the baek of my mind. 
If Butrus and O'Neill are so obsessed with cancelling the last two days of class that they must do so, then let's start exams on Saturday and let everyone go home two days sooner. 
The point is that there is nothing wrong with the eurrent system. Nonetheless, it seems as if Butrus and O'Neill want to make a change. 
Instead of simply cancelling the classes, it would make more sense to make the last two days of class optional review sessions. 
Professors would not be allowed to give new material to students on the last Thursday and Friday of classes. 
These days would serve as a time for professors to eonduct final exam reviews, which students could attend if they felt it would be beneficial to them. 
If a student thinks the review would be a waste of time, he or she could simply stay home and study independently (or drink beer and play Sega). 
These two days do not even have to be called classes. To make everyone who cannot cope with those grueling last two days of classes feel more comfortable, they simply could be called review days. 
Then Butrus and O'Neill would not have to worry about being accused of reneging on campaign promises, and half the student body would not be in rest homes before finals week even starts.

Pirates attack ships off shores of Asia 
•KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -Pirates have be­come a menace in the waters of Southeast Asia, slipping aboard ships at night to plunder and sometimes kill. After 61 acts of piracy were recorded in the region last year, compared to 33 in 1990 and only three in 1989, the peril finally caught the attention of government leaders. "In the dark of night, they clamber onto the ships and tie up the erew while they pillage and rob," said Mahathir Mohamad, prime minister of Malaysia. "When they leave, the crew members remain tied. For hours, the ship will sail unguided. It may deviate from its course and it may collide with another vessel or run aground, causing all kinds of damage." 
Five Israeli soldiers wounded by bomb 
•TYRE, Lebanon -A bomb exploded yesterday as an Israeli military convoy drove through a village in southern Lebanon, and five Israeli soldiers were wounded, Lebanese security sources said. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said two of the soldiers were seriously wounded in the explosion that targeted an Israeli convoy in Markaba village in Israel's self-designated "security zone" in southern Lebanon. Israeli gunners retaliated by shelling the villages of Qabrikha, Chaqra and Majdel Silim with 155mm howitzer fire, the sources said. There was no immediate word on casualties or an immediate responsibility claim for the explosion, which coincided with a visit to the area by Yitzhak Mordechai, head of Israel's northern command. It was not known whether Mordechai was in the convoy, which included civilian vehicles.

U.S., ex-Soviet officials discuss nuke proliferation 
MONTEREY, Calif. (AP)-U.S. and former Soviet experts began a conference Monday on ways to dissuade struggling post-Soviet states from export­ing their nuclear technology. 
"There is no one presently who is playing the role of whistleblower," said William Potter, director of Russian and Eurasian studies at the Mon­terey Institute of International Studies. "We must try and train specialists and experts in non­proliferation in countries of concern." 
The four-day conference, which includes legislators and officials from Belarus, Kaza­khstan, Russia and Ukraine, is the second of its type. 
The first was held in Moscow in October, two months after a failed coup against then-Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev began the disintegration of the central government. 
Potter said the struggling members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, which replaced the union, now have an economic incentive to sell nuclear arms despite treaties that prevent such sales to coun­tries that don't allow monitor­ing. 
"Nuclear commodities are one of the few things the former Soviet Union could sell on the international markets," Potter said. "The problem is it's going to come down to the weakest

Small amounts of uranium and plutonium of suspected So­viet origin already have shown up on the black market in at least four European countries in recent months, according to nuclear weapons experts. 
Ildar Akhtamzyan, a nuclear expert with the Moscow State Institute of International Rela­tions, described as a good sign Russian President Boris Yeltsin's assertion that he wouldn't allow transfer of nu­clear arms to countries that don't comply with international safeguards. 
"Now, the focus is to make the safeguards safer," Akhtamzyan said, noting that a key international nuclear weapons treaty is up for renewal in 1995. 
"We can have all sorts of laws, but the question is who will fulfill those laws," he said. "Someone could bribe a local official and the monitoring won't do any good. Now is a very unstable time." 
Vyacheslav Pozdnyak, a polit­ical science professor at the Minsk State Institute of Foreign Languages in Belarus, said things are changing so fast in his country that no central force is monitoring nuclear weapons.

Inspections: Few bombings u nsuccessfu I 
WASHINGTON (AP) -More 
than a year later, it is clear that 
the Bush administration was off 
target in its Gulf War claims 
that allied bombing "pretty well 
eliminated" Saddam Hussein's 
nuclear capability. · 
Some important nuclear sites 
were hardly touched, U.N. in­
spectors have discovered. In 
other cases, buildings were hit 
but the equipment inside un­
harmed. 
Some targets were damaged 
or destroyed even though allied 
war planners didn't realize the 
targets were tied to the nuclear 
program. 
1\vo small Iraqi nuclear reac­
tors were demolished early in 
the aerial bombardment, but 
since the war's end 13 months 
ago the world has learned that 
Saddam's atomic ambition was 
more grand than the war plan­
ners imagined. 
"We didn't understand what 
targets were important," said 
Gary Milhollin, director of the 
Wisconsin Project on Nuclear 
Arms Control, a private group 
in Washington. 
During the war, administra­
tion officials gave the impres­
sion that the intensive allied 
bombing campaign had wiped 
out the threat of a nuclear 
armed Saddam. 
"We've pretty well eliminated 
his nuclear research and pro­
duction capabilities," Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney declared 
on Feb. 3, 17 days into the air 
campaign. 
Two days later Cheney said: 
"His nuclear capability has 
been pretty well demolished." 
Asked about the administra­tion's early claims of success, Cheney's spokesman, Pete Williams, said last week: "We know now that we didn't hit as much as we could have. They concealed a lot." 
He added: "But the fact is we stopped it in its tracks, and the 
U.N. inspection team is disman­tling the rest ofit." 
The International Atomic Energy Agency on March 25 ordered the destruction of key buildings and equipment at a! Atheer, a weapons laboratory and production site that escaped nearly unscathed dur­
ing allied air strikes. Inspectors 
are scheduled to arrive at the
site 20 miles southwest of Baghdad on Tuesday to super­vise the demolition. 
AI Atheer and other elements of the Iraqi nuclear program remain standing not because allied bombers missed them. The allies didn't target the facilities because they didn't know they existed -or didn't realize their nuclear role. 

"Our major failure was an in­telligence failure," said William Arkin, director of military re­search at Greenpeace USA. Arkin visited sites throughout Iraq after the war and has studied the effects of the allied bombing. 
The U.S. military also was mistaken in thinking that bombing alone would end Iraq's nuclear potential, Arkin said. 
"If you want an analogy, you can say al Atheer is the Los Alamos of the Iraqi nuclear program," said nuclear physi­cist Paul Zimmerman, referring to the U.S. weapons design lab­

Feds seize property of Chilean who supplied Iraq with bombs 
MIAMI (API -A Chilean weapons maker who supplied Iraq with 29,000 cluster bombs during its war with Iran lost a chunk of his assets Monday to federal agents who accused him of export and money-launder­ing violations. 
Criminal charges weren't filed against Carlos Cardoen, who made more than $200 million arming Saddam Hussein's forces, but the government seiznd dozens of bank accounts and about $30 million in Florida office buildings, homes and other properties owned by Cardoen. 
"Today we have dropped a duster bomb on Carlos Cardoen and his organization," said U.S. Customs Commissioner Carol I Iallett. 
U.S. Attorney James 
McAdams declined to comment 
on the possibility of criminal 
charges against Cardoen. 

Cardoen wasn't in the United States Monday and couldn't be located for comment. 
The civil forfeiture actions in federal courts in Miami and Orlando allege Cardoen fun­nelled money he received from Iraq in payment through his Florida real estate. 
They also say his companies built the bombs using 100 tons of munitions-grade zirconium bought from Teledyne Chang in Albany, Ore., between 1984 and 1988. 
Teledyne and Cardoen's Swissco Management Co. claimed the zirconium was in­tended for civilian use in Peru. the government said. 
Cardoen also bought 200,000 castings for cluster bomb fuses from a Miami company in 1988 for use in the bombs, the gov­ernment said. 
Shipments of the fuses and of zirconium, a metal used in nu­clear reactors as well as bombs, are tightly controlled by the Commerce Department for national security and nuclear non-proliferation reasons. 
Ms. Hallett said it's not clear whether any of the bombs, which can rain 400 bomblets onto oncoming troops, were used in the Gulf War. 
Teledyne President AI Riesen has denied any illegal activity. The company, one of only two in the nation that make zirconium, wasn't targeted by the government's civil actions.

Bush administration asks Supreme Court to uphold Pennsylvania abortion law 
WASHINGTON (AP) Seeking to overturn the Supreme Court's 1973 ruling legalizing abortion, the Bush administration asked the court Monday to uphold a Pennsylvania law that imposes a 24-hour waiting period and requires women to notify their husbands before ending a pregnancy. 
In a friend-of-the-court brief, the ·Justice Department reiterated its longstanding position that women do not have a fundamental right to have an abortion and that the 1973 decision in Roe vs. Wade was wrongly decided. 
The brief filed by Solicitor General Kenneth Starr asked the high court to uphold Pennsylvania's law and argued that states could impose even stricter curbs. 
The Justice Department said the court could impose an outright ban on abortions be­cause "the protection of human life -in or out of the womb -is certainly the most compelling interest that a state can advance." 
The brief said that if the court declined to overturn the 1973 decision it should apply the reasoning adopted in its 1989 decision in Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services and find that Pennsylvania's abortion law is valid because it advances a "legitimate state interest." 
If it takes this narrower ap­proach, the court should "make clear that the liberty interest recognized in Webster does not rise to the exceptional level of a fundamental right." 
The administration's filing drew praise from the National Right to Life Committee, Inc. By adopting the Justice Department's position, the high court "would effectively overturn Roe vs. Wade and allow the states to directly limit the reasons for which abortions may be performed," the group's legislative director, Douglas Johnson said in a statement. 
The Justice Department ac­tion came one day after an es­timated 500,000 protesters marched in Washington in the biggest demonstration ever held by abortion rights' ac­tivists. 

Pennsylvania's law is valid because it advances legitimate state concerns that women make informed decisions before having an abortion, the Justice Department's brief said. 
The provision requiring a woman to notify her husband of plans to have an abortion "can help protect the life of a fetus, the integrity of the family unit, and the husband's interests in procreation within marriage and the potential life of his unborn child." 
Planned Parenthood and other abortion rights organiza­tions appealed to the Supreme Court last year after a federal appellate court upheld most provisions of the law, including the 24-hour waiting period and one that required parental permission for teenagers to obtain abortions.

Police kill five in Nepal as strike turns violent 

KATMANDU, Nepal (AP)­Police opened fire today on vio­lent mobs during a strike called to protest price rises and al­leged corruption, killing at least five people and wounding 50 others, officials and doctors said. 
The demonstrations were the biggest challenge to the govern­ing Nepali Congress Party since it came to power last year in the country's first multi-party election in 30 years. 
The strike, which was called by a leftist opposition party, re­flected public disappointment with the government's failure to lift living standards in Nepal, one of the world's poorest countries. 
Opposition parties also accuse the Congress Party of nepotism in administration and educational institutions. 
An overnight curfew was im­posed in Katmandu and a, sub­urb, Patan, after a day of spo­radic street battles between riot police and youths armed with stones, bricks and soda bottles. 
In Katmandu, the violence started when protesters at­tacked offices and shops that

had remained open in defiance of the strike sponsored by the Nepal Communist Party-Unity Center, a party from the ex­treme-left. 
Police initially fired tear gas and bullets in the air to dis­perse protesters. 
After the crowds regrouped and hurled stones at policemen, police opened fire. The demon­strators then disappeared into the narrow lanes of this ancient city. 
An Associated Press reporter saw one man shot in the head in Assan, the main shopping area in downtown Katmandu. Witnesses said at least five more people were killed in other parts of the city. 
Doctors at Bir Hospital said 31 people were admitted, mostly with gunshot wounds, and four died. At least 23 peo­ple were admitted to other hos­pitals. 
A Home Ministry official said 
one person died in Patan, and 
there were "some deaths" in 
Katmandu. But the official, who 
spoke on condition of 
anonymity, refused to elabo­
rate. 
Two years ago, a decades­
long pro-democracy movement 
by the Congress Party and 
communist parties climaxed 
with violent street protests that 
forced King Birendra to become 
a constitutional monarch and 
titular head of state. 
A year later, the Congress 
Party won a narrow election 
victory, ending 30 years of 
monarchial rule interrupted 
only by a short-lived democracy 
in 1959.

SAHAIEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) -Serbian snipers fired on peace demonstrators from their perches in hotel rooms Monday, killing at least five people, as violence wracked the capital of ethnically divided Bosnia­llercegovina. 
But the chaotic day -which included shelling that killed nine others and the storming of parliament by demonstrators ­failed to stop the European Community (ECJ from recogniz­ing the former Yugoslav repub­lic as an independent state. 
"Nobody knows whether recognition will bring peace," Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes said in Luxembourg. "But if we didn't recognize we would create more chaos." 
The deaths Monday brought the number killed to 100 in the last six days in divided Bosnia, where a Serb minority opposes the independence drive backed mainly by the republic's Slavic Muslims and Croats. 
Bosnia's president, Alija 
I , said the Serbs had stepped up the fighting to try to prevent EC recognition. The Serbs have threatened to establish their own republic, even tearing off a chunk of the Bosnian capital for themselves, if the EC granted recognition to Bosnia. 
Many fear a civil war in Bosnia would be bloodier than in neighboring Croatia, which with Slovenia declared indepen­dence last June. More than 10,000 people have died in fighting in Croatia. A fourth republic, Macedonia, also has

declared independence. 

A state of emergency and an overnight curfew were imposed in Sarajevo, yet volleys of ma­chine-gun fire reverberated through the city at night in cel­ebration of the EC move, the Tanjug news agency reported. 
Earlier in the day, about 40,000 demonstrators were marching for peace when snipers from inside Sarajevo's Holiday Inn opened fire for the second straight day. 
At least five people were killed and 30 injured, said Ferid Haradjic, a doctor at the mu­nicipal hospital. At least 10 people were wounded in the Holiday Inn shootings the day before. 
The hotel serves as headquar­ters for ethnic Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. Bosnian police who entered the hotel said they arrested six Serb gunmen. 
Science fiction writer Isaac Asimov dies 
NEW YORK (AP) -;-Isaac 

Asimov, whose nearly 500 
books ranged from science 
fiction foretelling an era in 
which mankind and benign 
robots spread across the galaxy 
to science fact, histories and 
humor, died Monday at age 72. 
He died of heart and kidney failure at New York University Hospital, said his brother, Stanley Asimov, a vice­president of Newsday. 
The most popular of Asimov's novels and stories were excursions into a future in which Earth is forgotten by a humanity that spreads through the stars, ruled by a galactic "Foundation" and served by robots. 
He set a standard that has been followed by other authors when. in "I Robot" in 1950, he laid down a set of three laws for robots, the essence of which was that robots may not harm people or stand by and let people get hurt. 
Asimov also was one of the most widely read popularizers of science fact. as well as a prolific writer on subjects that amused or interested him, including literature. humor and opera, light and grand. He was also an associate professor of biochemistry at the Boston University School of Medicine 
"I heard that he was the only author in the world that had at least one book in each of the major classifications of the old Dewey decimal system (the old library cataloging system)," said Martin Greenberg of Green Bay, Wis., an anthologizer who worked with Asimov. 
Scientist and author Carl Sagan called him "one of the master explainers of the age.... I think millions of people owe their knowledge of science, their familiarity with some scientific fact, to reading either the fact or fiction of Isaac Asimov." 
A hallmark of his fiction was that the science, sometimes mindboggling, was nonetheless convincing.

The USOC has threatened to kick Jordan off the team if he doesn't allow the use of his likeness, and I think that they are perfectly within their bounds to do so. The team rep­resents this country in front of the world, and if Jordan, for whatever reason, cannot be part of that team in every way, then maybe he shouldn't play in Barcelona. 
Irregardless of whether Jordan is dunking or 'the Mailman' Malone delivers it home, the United States should be a shoo-in for gold this summer. So maybe, to keep the unity of the team as close as possible, the USOC should get this Jordan issue resolved as soon as possible, whatever the outcome may be. It would be in the best interests of the team and the country. 
I'm not taking anything away from Jordan as an athlete, for he is simply the best basketball player in the world right now, but if his off-the court activities and behavior are going to cause such an uproar as to impede the success of the team, then he should be confronted so as to end the problems as soon as possible. 
Jordan is a great player, and a strong role model, but his image is taking a beating at the moment. He is not a god, but he is a man, and subject to the same pitfalls as everyone else. It may be hard for him to fathom that not everyone wants 'to be like Mike'. 
The issue at hand is basketball, and Jordan should settle all of the off-the-court affairs that may affect his game and that of his teammates. The Olympics await, and Michael Jordan should be a part of that team. 
However, if his presence on the team is going to cause chaos among the Olympians, then maybe he should be left off. The choice is up to him.

Danapilis hit his third hit of the day, a double which scored Counsell all the way from first. 
The Rockets mounted a quasi-comeback in the eighth with three runs despite solid pitching from freshman pitcher Marty DeGraff who was making his first collegiate appearance. 
"It was a good game for us. A lot of people played in some different spots including DeGraff who made his first college appearance," said Notre Dame coach Pat Murphy. "With the injuries, we are pleased to score 13 runs." 
Injuries could cause some trouble for the Irish with Layson in the hospital, Counsell still feeling the effects of the twisted ankle, Bautch banged up, and the flu floating around, and with a game against Purdue on Wednesday and a four game series with Midwestern Coll~giate Conference foe Evansville this weekend. 

NCAA 
continued from page 16 
Laettner, who personally lifted the Blue Devils to two of their five straight Final Four appearances with buzzer-beat­ers, rebounded from his worst half of the year to lead a clos­ing 23-6 Duke charge. 
Duke's defensive pressure, meanwhile, limited Michigan to only 20 second-half points on 29 percent shooting -nine for 
31. The Wolverines, who led 31-30 at halftime, shot only 38 percent for the game and had their lowest point total in eight years. It was also the lowest losing score in a championship game since 1981, when Indiana beat North Carolina 63-50. 
Bobby Hurley, the floor leader who matched his career high of 26 points against Indiana in the semifinals, hit only three of 12 shots in the championship game but had seven assists with his nine points and was named Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four. 
"It wasn't a pretty game," 
Hurley said, "but we got the job done." 
Grant Hill had a terrific all­around game for Duke with 18 points, 10 rebounds, five as­sists, three steals and two blocks. Thomas Hill added 16 points and seven rebounds for the Blue Devils. 
"Coach just challenged us at halftime to play better," Grant Hill said. "We just tried to come and play hard. Michigan played hard. I'm just so happy we came through in the stretch." 
However, it was Laettner's long-distance shooting that sparked Duke, which trailed 31-30 at halftime. 
Laettner's 3-pointer 44 sec­onds into the second half gave Duke the lead for good, 35-33. Another 3-pointer by Laettner with 11:05 left gave the Blue Devils a 46-39 lead, and they took off from there. 
"The second half, we had no semblance of order on offense," Michigan coach Steve Fisher said. "And I think it was as much their defense as any­thing. We unbraveled with some bad shots and you can't do that against a good team."

•••Considerations 

During Lent, we try "to bring the image of Jesus to perfection within us." Like generations of Christian believers before us, we try to look to Jesus Christ as the source of reconciliation, forgiveness and peace, and as a unifying force for us as people. 
We trust Jesus when He tells us that despite our infidelity and our temptations to look elsewhere, He is, in the end, our one sure hope. 
And so we attempt to judge what is going on within ourselves and around us in the light of what we can become as an accepted and forgiven people, and in the light of the Gospel. Jesus challenges us to make a decision about him, and about the Gospel as a way of life as Good News for all men and women. 
This weekend has shown us once again that we are a bitterly divided nation when it comes to the issue of abortion, and what has become the politics of abortion. And today Respect Life week begins. 
The Catholic bishops in our country urge us to move toward a consistent ethic of life in our personal moral choices and in our life as a nation. This is a call to reject violent solutions to family and societal problems. It is issued in the context of a generation that will face more and more complex life and death issues and situations than any previous generation. 
Every human person is created in God's own image, and no human person is separated from God's love. Those who are apparently the least of our brothers and sisters are every bit our equal in the eyes of a God who does not value people or their worth in the limited ways we often do. 
Today within our society there is an undeniable readiness to end troublesome or unwelcome lives. Killing seems to be a solution to many problems. We look for language that dehumanizes the victim so that killing appears to be something other than it is. The destruction of any human life cannot heighten our personal respect nor anyone else's for an argument about the sacredness of the life of every person. 
We expect a baby with joy, yet we can abort a fetus without much concern. What clearly has the form of a human person is simply called a mass of cells. 
We deplore the monstrous or inhuman acts of a criminal, and apply "the death penalty." One inexcusable murder leads to a death which enjoys popular support. 
In the near future, it seems likely that "quality of life" arguments used in situations where there is consciousness, may become the basis for accepting assisted suicide or even legal euthanasia. 
More than a year after the conclusion of a popular war that was thought by many to be a just one, we still have no information about the 'collateral damage' it caused. Do we care how many innocent civilian victims there were, even if we think an enemy's dictator-leader caused the deaths by his reckless actions? 
Our nation now again accepts official violence in political situations, and has abandoned a policy where human rights were, if not the cornerstone at least a touching stone for policy. 
If you pull the first string on the seamless garment which the consistent ethic of life represents, in the imagery of Cardinal Bernardin,_ the garment is weakened. If you pull many strings, it unravels completely. 
As followers of Jesus, we try to bring hope to the issues we face. We need to make personal decisions carefully, and to develop a set of moral values that are consistent with the way we look at life-our life and the lives of others-as precious gifts from God. 
The politics of abortion will take us nowhere. But neither will an approach that does not take into account the entire range of life-related issues.

Women's golf hits snag at IU 
By MIKE HOBBES 
Sports Writer 
Seeking a chance to move up 
in the ranks against some of 
their tougher competition, the 
women's golf team traveled to 
Bloomington for the Indiana 
Invitational this past weekend. 
Unfortunately for the Irish, the weather proved to be the biggest adversary. 
"Throughout the weekend, the wind chill was below freezing. We knew we were in for a tough time when the practice round on Friday was marred by sprinkles," stated Head Coach Tom Hanlon. 
On the average, the total score per team was eighteen shots higher than the prior year. Some were as many as :~6-40 shots over previous finishes. 
"Indiana, ranked fourteenth in the nation. won the tournament. followed by Northern Illinois and Penn State," cited Hanlon noting the poorer scores due to the weather. 
For the weekend, the team finished sixteenth. Leading the way for the Irish was junior Kathy Phares. 
Once again the common dtmominator for the Irish was the lack of practice here in lovely South Bend that has resulted from rather frequent cold temperatures. 
"We really need to practice and play more. I am some what disappointed from the scores of the weekend, but then again, I can not control the weather," said Hanlon. 
Looking towards the coming week, the Irish are hoping for accommodating weather so that they may get in as much practice time as possible in preparation for another upcoming tournament this weekend. 
ND/SMC Sailing takes sixth at Miami of Ohio 
Special to The Observer 
The ND/SMC Sailing Club travelled to Miami of Ohio this weekend for a regatta. 
Bob Leonard skippered a ves­sel with Adrienne Briggs as the crew in the A division. Rudy Bryce skippered in his first col­legiate race while Christy Frederick as the crew for a ninth place finish in the B divi­sion. 
Overall, the team finished sixth in a field of twelve includ­ing powerhouses Michigan, Wisconsin. Ohio State and Western Michigan. Michigan State came out on top of the field. 
The ND/SMC team had a hard timH adjusting to the rapid weather changes both days. The team will head to Ohio State this weekend to try to make-up for their mistakes

Men's galt places seventh 
By MIKE HOBBES 
Sports Writer 
Citing a lack of practice time this spring mostly due to the inclement weather, Notre Dame men's golf coach George Thomas was still able to com­ment on the overall improving performance of the team. 
"It is unfortunate that we have had such a bad spring," stated Thomas. "We have really not had the time to get in some good outdoor practice, but de­spite this situation we are managing a good stroke aver­age." 
Enduring the some of the bad weather this past weekend. the team competed in the Purdue Invitational Tournament. The Irish battled inclement weather on Saturday to finish the day in the sixth spot. Leading the team on Saturday were seniors Mike O'Connell and Mike Crisanti.

0. K., enough already, right. Well, the freshmen of the Irish women's track team have not been quite as dominating in their sport as the budding bas­ketball dynasty in Ann Arbor. However, this sizable portion of the squad has started to show some promise, with a number of strong performances at this past weekend's Indianapolis Intercollegiate meet. 
Leading the way for the freshmen were the middle dis­tance runners of the freshman class. Eva Flood, Stefanie Jensen, and Emily Husted all placed well in the 1500 meter race, finishing second, sixth, and seventh respectively. 
Husted, who was racing for the first time since she broke her foot in November, was un­sure on how good this perfor­mance was for her and her teammates. 
"I wasn't quite sure what to expect. I think the weather af­fected our performance, though."

O'Connell. "We just had a bad day." 
Sunday proved to be a high­light for the Irish as the weather turned warmer and two members of the squad low­ered their scores from the prior day. 
Joe Dennen finished the day with a 74, for a combined over­all score of 154, to finish sec­ond for the Irish and 24th overall. Once again, it was· Mike O'Connell leading the way for the Irish with a total for the day of 76. For the weekend, O'Connell finished with a 153 to place him in the 21st position overall. 
"Our second day was ideal," said O'Connell. "We got pumped up and felt better about our prospects." 
Overall the men finished a respectable seventh place out of a field of fifteen teams. The tournament was won by Iowa, with Texas Tech in ·second and Eastern Michigan and Western Illinois tieing for third. 
Also marking a mark were freshmen Kristi Kramer, who placed fourth in the 5000 meter event with a time of 18:24, and Becky Alfieri, who finished a strong fifth in the 3000 meter race. 
Among the upperclassmen, Karen Harris and Latrice Waters were the most visible. Harris, the Irish's weights spe­cialist, came in seventh in both the discus, with a throw of 129' 1 0", and the shot, where she had a toss of 40' 5". Waters finished seventh in the 100 meters (12.3 seconds), and ninth in the 200 meters (26.5 seconds). 
Freshmen Sarah Riley, a dis­tance runner who made the trip as a spectator, was optimistic about her team's performance, noting that "things went pretty well." 
Perhaps it is the attitude that is guiding the women to their strong showings, which summed up in her view of the me~~-"It really was a lot of fun. 
Though the freshmen may not be dominating the world of NCAA women's track, their attitude of optimism and en­thusiasm bodes well for the remainder of this year and the years to come.

From the Sidelines 
The tarnishing of a legend 
Picture this scenario for a minute if you would. The setting is Barcelona, the gold­nwdal game in men's basketball. The USA, lf'd by its professional athletes and a coupln of collngians, has been tearing through the world's teams like a machete through soft butter. 
It's the final live minutes of the game, 
'-U.S. up by s1wen, and coach Chuck Daly has put all live starters in for one last hurst to put the game out of reach and sncure the first gold medal for America sine1~ the 1984 games in Los Angeles. 
Daly pulls Larry Bird. Patrick Ewing, Magie Johnson. and Shaquille 0' Neal off the court. sending in Chris Mullin. Karl Malone. David Robinson. and Scottie Pippen to complement the star of the show. the king-jammer himself. 
Team USA goes on a tremendous run. Three-pointers are buried, turnovers are forced. and the game goes out of reach. Then. with three minutes left, Robinson pulls down a board in traffic. He quickly tosses the outlet pass to Pippen, and the now world-famous American fast break is on. Pippen dishes to Mullin, who gives out a quick behind-the-back shuffie pass. 
Getting the ball and driving in for the monster slam, the dunk that shatters the baekboard and puts the exclamation point on a tremendous performance, is Bill J.aimbeer. 
Bill J.aimbeer?!?!??? 
That's right. What, you were expecting someone else? Maybe lsiah Thomas? Or how about Clyde Drexler? No, some other basketball wizard, perhaps? 
Oh. maybe you're wondering where Michael Jordan is? Well, he wasn't playing in the Olympics, marking the sad fall from grace of a basketball idol. 
You sne, after the Bulls completely pounded the Golden State Warriors in the NBA finals to claim their second consecutive title, things went a little sour for the Air Man. 
With allegations of a gambling problem and thousands of dollars in checks to pay off his debts, the Jordan star had lost some of its glitter. 
There are rumors of how difficult Jordan is to play with, of the ego that irwvitably hits a bonafide superstar, and of the special treatment he may receive just because he is Michael. 
On top of all of those things, Jordan and the U.S. Olympic Committee are having a squabble over his likeness being rnproduced on Olympic merchandise.

Women's tennis splits two in Texas 
BY JASON KELLY 
Sports Writer 
With matches against perennial powers Texas and Texas A&M on the schedule. the Notre Dame women's tennis team knew their trip south wouldn't be easy. 
They were right. 
Against Texas last Thursday, the Irish didn't win a set in a 5-0 loss to the Longhorns, who are expected to jump to number three in the next poll. 
Because of bad weather conditions, the match was shifted inside, but the change didn't help the struggling Irish. 
Intimidation may have been a factor against the heavily favored Longhorns. 
"Texas is a really good team, but we didn't play them tough," Notre Dame coach Jay Louderback said. "I think we played a little scared." 
It was Texas A&M who played scared on Friday. 
In 24 hours, the Irish made a complete turnaround and dumped the Aggies 5-2 without the services of sophomore standout Terri Vitale, who was sidelined with eye problems. 
"Against A&M we played well," Louderback commented. "Even with Vitale out of the lineup we won four of the singles matches." 
Senior Melissa Harris and freshman Laura Schwab got the match started with tough three set victories at number one and two singles, respec­tively. 
Harris beat Texas A&M's top player Lynn Staley, 7-6, 2-6, 7-6 and Schwab knocked off Janine Burton-Durham 6­4, 2-6, 7-6. 
Sophomores Christy Faustmann and Lisa Tholen were also winners in singles competition and they teamed up to win the only doubles match of the evening over Burton-Durham and Anna Schlumpf, 6-1, 6-1. 
Western Michigan is next up for the Irish today at 3 
p.m. in the final home match for the seniors. 
It is expected to be an emo­tional match with the 8-9 Irish trying to reach the .500 mark as the seniors say goodbye. 
"Our seniors have done a great job for us all season and it will definitely be emotional when they play their last match at home," Louderback said. 
Emotion won't be enough 
By JENNY MARTEN Associate Sports Editor 
Warmer weather and hot bats helped propel the 15th-ranked Notre Dame baseball team a 13-7 win over the University of Toledo yesterday. 
Several Irish batters came up with multiple hit games and senior Joe Binkiewicz ripped his fourth homerun of the year to lead the Irish in the game. Junior Dave Sinnes (3-1) pitched six solid innings from the mound allowing three runs and four hits while striking out eight and walking none. Don Wackerly (0-3) was the losing pitcher in the contest after giving up six runs and live hits in only 4.1 innings of work. 
The Irish got things started in the third inning by scoring four runs. Senior Craig Counsell (2 for 4, 3 runs) got things started by beating out a bunt, but stepped on the lirstbaseman's foot and twisted his ankle. Junior Eric Danapilis 
Blue Devils repeat as National Champions 
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) ­History didn't come easy for the Duke Blue Devils. Nevertheless, history they made, energized at last by their star, Christian Laettner. 
They became the first team in 19 years to repeat as NCAA champions Monday night with a 71-51

Fab Five freshmen, the youngest team to ever vie for the title. 
"We won last year, but it's the best feeling to go out in my last game at Duke on a winning note," Laettner said. 
After missing six of eight shots and making a season-high seven turnovers in the first half, Laettner finished with 19 points and seven rebounds. 
"He was throwing up bricks and we were still 
down just one point," Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said. "I knew if we could turn up the emotion and get him back in the game we'd have· a shot." 
"I don't think we were emotionally drained," Laettner said. "I missed some shots and Michigan played well. I was playing really weak and we weren't rebounding. In the second half, we did a better job. I wasn't physically or emotionally drained." 
Not since UCLA ended a seven-year reign as national champions in 1973 had a team managed to win two in a row.

(3 for 4, 3 RBI) who had another productive day at the plate, singled to advance Counsell. Up to the plate came Binkiewicz (2 for 4, 3 RBI) who almost nailed a guy painting the signs in right center with a three run homer. Freshman Paul Failla then sent a triple off the wall and scored a few batters later before Bob Lisanti got caught in a rundown to end the inning. 
Toledo came right back in the fourth with three runs off Sinnes. A double, a single and a sacrifice fly brought three Rockets across the plate to make the score 4-3 in favor of Notre Dame, but the Irish ended all hopes of an upset by Toledo with a eight run fifth inning. 
The Irish went through the batting order in the inning with a little help from three different Rocket pitchers, Wackerly, Rick Fortman, and Mark Adzema. The Toledo pitchers hit Failla and freshman Steve Verduzco with pitches to load the bases after Binkiewicz reached base on an error. Bob Lisanti singled into short right to score Binkiewicz. 
Freshman Robby Birk beat out a per­fect bunt on a suicide squeeze which scored Failla and junior Dan Bautch singled off the pitcher's leg to snnd Verduzco across the plate and Fortman limping off the field. A walk to Counsell set up Danapilis' two-run single, but Notre Dame's scoring had only just be­gun. The Rockets opted to walk Binkiewiez to load the bases, but the plan was wrecked when senior Cory Mee (3 for 4, 1 RBI) launched a three­run double. 
The seventh inning brought some new faces onto the field for the Irish includ­ing sophomore pitcher Tom Price who pitched an inning and gave up one run and two hits. Notre Dame got the run back in the bottom of the inning when
