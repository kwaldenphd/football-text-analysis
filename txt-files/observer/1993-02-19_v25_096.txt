Ferry sinks, at least 1 ,000 dead 
PETIT GOAVE, Haiti (AP} -A packed ferry carrying up to 1,500 people .sank in stormy seas off Haiti, and only 285 people were known to have survived, the Red Cross said Thursday. 
Survivors told how they clung to floating objects, in one case a bag of charcoal, to stay alive. 
"The sea was full of people," said one survivor, 29-year-old Madeleine Julien, from her hospital bed in this coastal town. "I kept bumping into drowned people." 
The ferry Neptune went down late Tuesday off Petit Goave, 60 miles west of the capital. But communications are so crude outside the capital it took a group of about 60 survivors a day to first report the accident. 
U.S. aircraft and vessels dispatched Thursday to help in search-and-rescue efforts reported "lots of debris and lots of bodies," said Coast Guard spokesman, Cmdr. Larry Mizell, liaison in Port-au­Prince. 
The Coast Guard said it had found more than 100 bodies floating off Petit Goave. Bodies were earlier reported washing up on the beaches of Miragoane, 18 miles to the west of Petit Goave. 
Mizell said there was "no correlation between this and the boat people," referring to the tens of thousands of Haitians who have fled their homeland by sea since the army ousted elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991. 
One survivor, Benjamin Sinclair, told the private Radio Metropole that as many as 1,500 people were aboard the triple-decker

A new state center-right rela­tionship may be the only alter­native to anarchy in the former Soviet Union. according to Mar­cia Weigle, an assistant profes­sor of government. 
In her lecture yesterday, "State Formation and Political Parties in Post-Communist Russia," Weigle. who is an ex­pert on the former Soviet Union and social movements, dis­cussed recent changes in Rus­sian history in terms of two ma­jor waves of state-party rela­tions. 
She said that the first wave, from the spring of 1990 to spring 1992, was because "post-communist reformers and the liberal-democrat coalition failed to consolidate" as a result of disintegrative pressures in the new state and the political party system in addition to the actions of state and party leaders. 
The second wave from the fall of 1992 to the present, involved post-communist state leaders and a center-right statist coalition of parties and interest groups. 
Weigle said that there is a daunting array of tasks for Russian political leaders in the post-Soviet Union, with the most pressing being that of establishing state authority. 
Weigle approached the issue of the present situation in Rus­sia by concentrating on the in­stitutional and social roots of Russian state power. 
"It's really a battle about who controls the government," said Weigle. 
She said that the multi-party system is not predetermined. She continued that though "Russia, of all the reforming communist states, was the least prepared to introduce any kind of political parties," political parties and party blocs were the only effective, if extremely weak, form of political repre­sentation. 
Weigle said that political par­ties transformed state power from within Russia. She noted that the situation was ironic be­cause, though reforming com­munists believed that they could use the state to keep political parties in check, these same parties and electoral blocs succeeded in pushing for change. 
One way they did this was 
in March of 1989 and the spring of 1990, said Weigle. These elections, she said, "indicate the capacity of independent political participation to organize its forces in the face of institutionalized opposition." 
She said that these events were not "something that could have been taken for granted." There was an absence of a moderate right party because of the link between nationalism and hardliners and chauvinists. She said that there were "missed opportunities to link new state power with liberal­democratic party coalition." 
Weigle said that although parties have gained more power in legislature, "their representation in parliament no longer reflects their standing in the political process or among the general public." 
She said that Yeltsin's lack of control over governmental ap­pointees will harm political parties whose candidates were being appointed to government positions. 
Weigle said that the prefer­ability of the "second wave" of state/party relations, the state

INSIDE COLUMN 

Memories and thanks: a JPW tribute 
My first memory reaches-------­back almost nineteen years ago. I was sitting on ' 
the kitchen counter, eating . 
cinnamon red hots. For 
some reason, Gammy (my 
grandmother) was in from · 
New York, watching me 
while Mom and Dad were Sean Farnan 
gone for some reason that . I did not know. As my Accent Photo Ed1tor memory jogs back,-. Gammy did not really mind that I was makmg a glutton of myself with the red hots. Next, I remember Mom and Dad coming back with a new-born sister. 
I remember the last day of nursery school. The school invited all of the parents to the school to watch us ride around on tricycles and then have a hot dog lunch. Dad took time o work so that he could come. I remember lobby­
ing hard at lunch to stop at the grocery store on the way home for some of those Double Stuf Oreo cookies that one of the girls in the class had brought for the potluck dessert table. 
I remember those summer days and evenings of grade school when all of the neighborhood kids would flock to our backyard for endless games of kickball. Our supply of band-aids was constantly being taxed with scraped knees and elbows. Mom was continually making pitchers of Kool-Aid to quench the thirsts of the neighborhood youth. 
I remember those nights before the grade school science fairs when Mom and Dad were trying to get my sister and me to start and finish the science projects due the next day. 
I remember the taxi service that Mom and Dad ran to the birthday parties, the roller skating parties, the CYO basketball games and whatever else was on the agenda. 
I remember the days of junior high school. Those days of ups and down. Those days when Mom and Dad had to deal with me and my friends who knew it all and proceeded to let everyone know we knew it. 
I remember the last days before leaving for college. Mom was scurrying around making sure that I had bed sheets, laundry soap and plenty of underwear and socks. Dad worked those paternal miracles of packing more into a car than seemed humanly possible. 
After spending three years here at Notre Dame, I have come to realize that the experiences that I have had with my parents are unique but yet shared by nearly all here. None of us have gotten this far on our own. We have some pretty amazing people behind us. 
To all of the parents out there this weekend, we all have come a long way -thanks for bringing us this far. Thanks for enduring through the Little League games .. ~he neighborhood Kool-Aid stands and the s1bhng rivalries.

MacCurtain: Irish society favors men Clinton tries to enlist support 
By KATIE MURPHY This inferiority in status set influences further developed 


for his new economic plan 
News Writer the stage for future inequities the patriarchal lifestyle in Ire­
Post-famine society in Ireland favored the social and political development of only the male half of the Irish population, ac­cording to Boston College Pro­fessor Margaret MacCurtain. 
"The social needs of Irish women were not satisfied in the ways that the needs of the males were satisfied," said MacCurtain, who spoke yester­day in the Hesburgh Library lounge on "The Waning of a Patriarchy: Ireland in the 1990s". 'There was an endless round of pleasurable activities (for males). Sport was an open season as well as an open sesame to politics," said Mac­Curtain. 
for Irish women, according to MacCurtain. 
An Irish man's name was tightly linked to his land, said MacCurtain. This connection between the males of a family and the farm enhanced the status of the males of the fam­ily, giving them a more impor­tant position in society, she said. 
Women, however, were told by various sources to simply bear the children and stay home at night, said MacCurtain: 
"There were very few plea­sures in their lives," said Mac­Curtain. "The rural community could not accommodate daughters as they did sons."

land. According to MacCurtain, the concept of patriarch was constantly on the minds of the men in power, and is still rep­resented by the laws of modern Irish society. The place of the woman in the home was rein­forced by stringent controls on contraception, abortion, and information about sexuality, she said. 
"Prevention of abortion in Ireland is seen as the male ownership of women reflected in the state laws and constitu­tion," said MacCurtain. "And in the 1980s, the women's body was high on political agendas, and nowhere more than in Ireland." 
The modern debate on sexual issues launched a strong tide of public response in Ireland. Although MacCurtain said she believes the Irish state is rather "out of tune" with these issues in the country, a strong critique of the male status quo is rising in Ireland. 
The key to an effective voice for women in Ireland is em­powerment, said MacCurtain. 
"Equality is a two way process and gender equality is a goal for modern Ireland," said Mac Curtain. 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Presi­dent Clinton led his adminis­tration on a blitz across the map of America Thursday to enlist citizen support for a pain­then-gain economic plan that he said would keep America's children from having to settle for a "lesser life." 
In a campaign-style rally at St. Louis' Union Station, the opening shot in his drive to win America to his side, Clinton said he was "tired of all the naysayers" who would oppose his budget plan. 
"The price of doing the same thing is higher than the price of change," he declared. 
Henry Cisneros, Clinton's housing secretary, carried the pitch to Flint, Mich., still reeling from the closing of a big Gen­eral Motors plant in 1987. He said higher taxes can't be avoided. 
"Taxes -even the word is difficult to express," Cisneros said. "I get dry in the mouth, but it's imperative." 
But even as Treasury Secre­tary Lloyd Bentsen returned to Congress to implore legislators to cast "the vote of a lifetime" for Clinton's plan, a new release

of fine print from the White House indicated the ad­ministration's deficit cutting to be less dramatic than first por­trayed. 
Republicans, meanwhile, ac­cused Clinton of mounting a propaganda blitz to sell old tax­and-spend solutions disguised in new clothing. 
Clinton brushed off questions about new deficit projections as he set out for the Midwest to generate the grassroots support that will be vital if his plan is to survive attacks by powerful interests, criticism by Re­publicans and misgivings by some fellow Democrats. 
In his maiden appearance be­fore Congress Wednesday night, the president proposed raising taxes, directly or indirectly, for most Americans. His ideas would also cut spending in 150 programs but increase it elsewhere. And, to reinvigorate a soft economy, he would cut some business taxes and un­dertake a quick public works spending program. 
This amounted to "reinventing our government," Clinton told the lawmakers. Failure to take painful steps now, he said, would amount to "condemning our children and our children's children to a lesser life than we enjoyed." 
But the new figures from the White House showed that when full account is taken of the im­pact of spending increases and pro-business tax cuts, the four­year reduction in deficits would not add up to the half-billion dollars ballyhooed by the ad­

Sinclair, a 32-year-old bus driver, said he clung to a bag of charcoal from 11 p.m. Tuesday

He said the vessel was cruis­ing in a rainstorm and, as con­ditions worsened, passengers panicked. 
Julien, a street merchant, said "the seas and storm tossed the 150-foot Neptune from side to side. 
People crowded atop the ferry were knocked screaming into the waters, she said. Farm animals on board floated away. 
Julien was separated from six family members, who are pre­sumably all drowned. 
She and other survivors said there were no life jackets or life boats on board. People had lit­tle chance of surviving unless they were lucky enough, as Julien was, to grab an object to stay afloat.

Catholic Worker movement exhibition opens at esc 
Special to The Observer 
An exhibition of some 50 pho­tographic portraits of people involved in the Catholic Worker movement will open at the Uni­versity of Notre Dame's Center for Social Concerns Sunday, Feb. 21 from 3 to 6 p.m. 
The photographs were taken by Mary Farrell, a freelance photographer who lives and works at the Dan Corcoran Catholic Worker House in Winona, Minn. 
In 1989, Farrell began a year­long journey visiting many of the country's nearly 100 Catholic Worker communities, including the Holy Family Catholic Worker House in South Bend. Living and working with her subjects for extended peri­ods, she hoped to provide, on film, a visual compliment to written and spoken accounts of the movement. 
"What it means to be a Catholic Worker is written on the faces of these servants of the poor, and we witness their journey of the soul," she said 

Ban AIDS immigrants, Senate votes 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The Senate voted Thursday to bar AIDS-infected foreigners from immigrating permanently to the United States, a lopsided defeat for President Clinton that left the White House groping for what to do next. 
Clinton had promised during the campaign that he would lift a ban already in place, but right after the vote the White House seemed to run up the white flag. 
"If you look at the vote mar­gin, he doesn't have that many options," said spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers. "He's going to review it; I think the Senate made a pretty strong statement about it." 
Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., thought so, too, and said the 76-23 vote on his amendment should send the administration a message that letting people with the AIDS virus into the country and letting homosexu­als into the military are politi­
cally unpopular. "Frankly, I think President Clint_on made a lot of promises 

to special interest groups that are not in sync with the Ameri­can people, and this is one of them," Nickles said. 
Myers suggested that Clinton had not put up much of a fight on the AIDS issue in the Senate. 
"The president has been re­viewing his options on this for the last several weeks, but he's been working primarily on his economic plan," she said. 
Up to now, the immigration ban has been a matter of policy that the administration could change. But Nickles' amend­ment would make that policy federal law. 
His amendment is attached to a bill that authorizes spending for the National Institutes o Health. The bill itself later passed 93-4 and now goes to the House, where a similar ef­fort is under way to put the ban into law. 
Before approving Nickles' amendment, the Senate de­feated a move by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., that would have kept current federal policy in place for 90 days but left Clinton free to change it after that. 
Kennedy, whose measure lost on a 56-42 vote, said the United States had obligations that extend beyond its borders. Such obligations, he said, would include political refugees who should not be denied U.S. government protection simply because they have caught a virus.

The Catholic Worker move­ment was founded in 1933 by two Catholic laypersons, Dorothy Day, a freelance writer, and Peter Maurin, a homeless epigrammatist. 
The movement began as a publishing project, its founders intending little more than to distribute a radical newspaper devoted to the social program of the Catholic Church. 
Its editorial offices in the New York slums soon expanded to accommodate a pacifist and an­archist Catholic community de­voted to voluntary poverty, hospitality and the recognition of Christ in the poor. The movement has grown over the years into a loose confederation of such communities. 
The exhibition is sponsored by Notre Dame student gov­ernment and the Student Union Board. It will be at the Center for Social Concerns until April 2, and accessible Mondays through Fridays from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., Saturdays from noon to 2 p.m., and Sundays from 6 to 9 p.m.

Elders: Teaching abstinence does not work 
ALEXANDHIA, Va. (AP) ­
Teach.ing teenagers sexual 
abstinence hasn't stopped them 
from getting pregnant or 
contracting AIDS, so schools 
should step in with other kinds 
of information, the nation's next 
surgeon general said Thursday. 
"Every mother I know, every 
teacher I know, every minister I 
know has been teaching ab­
stinencn for a thousand years. 
We know thny're not abstain­
ing," said Dr. Joycelyn Elders, 
chosen for the health post by 
President Clinton. 

Elders, now state health chief 
in Arkansas, will succeed Dr. 
Antonia Novello, who steps 
down in June. 

In a speech to a National School Boards Association panel on school health pro­grams and in later comments, Elders said many parents are ill-equipped to properly teach their children about pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases such as AIDS. 
"People always say let the parents take care of it," she said. "Well, nobody ever taught them, so they don't know how to teach their children." 
She said 52 percent of chil­dren don't go to church and can't receive instruction there. 
Elders, 59, is an outspoken pediatrician who has been a target of conservatives and anti-abortion groups since 1987, when then Gov. Clinton made her the first black person and the first woman to head the Arkansas Health Department. 
Her resolute support of con­dom distribution in schools as a means of combatting teen pregnancy and AIDS raised the ire of conservative and Chris­tian groups in Arkansas, which has the nation's second highest pregnancy rate among teenagers. Clinton ignored calls for her resignation. 
When word of her impending appointment as surgeon general 
Correction 
In a story in yesterday's issue, The Observer incorrectly reported a statement made during Wednesday's Iceberg Debate by Sheila Moloney of the Breen-Phillips' team. Moloney said that Notre Dame should not compare il'ielf with secular universities in part because those universities place technical research, such as fetal tissue studies, ahead of ethical research. Notre Dame banned research with human fetal tissue as contrary to its Catholic nature. 
The Observer regrets the error.

leaked in Washington, the National Right to Life Commit­tee called her a "pro-abortion extremist." 
Elders said Thursday her primary goal as surgeon gen­eral would be a reduction in the teen pregnancy rate, a goal she never achieved in Arkansas. 
"The agenda in my mind is to make every child born in America a planned, wanted child," she said. "If I take care of that problem ... I will have done a lot." 
But Elders said she promoted school clinics because they could reach one-fifth of the na­tion's population with primary preventive health services. 
"You have a person in the White House who wants to push school health," she said. "You can't educate children if they're not healthy and you can't keep them healthy if they're not educated."

Christopher calls for peace in Middle East 
CAIRO (AP) -Secretary of State Warren Christopher chal­lenged Arabs and Israelis on Thursday to strike compromises quickly or risk diminished U.S. interest in pressing the Mideast peace process. 
"There are important oppor­tunities here that should not be missed by the parties," Christopher said on his arrival in Cairo, the first stop on a week-long tour of the region and his first trip abroad since taking office. 
"We have come to the region ready to do our best, and we will be assessing whether the parties are ready to do theirs," he said. 
A senior U.S. official told re­porters en route from Wash­ington that the Arab-Israeli conflict "can't continue to have a high priority if we're pushing against a closed door." 
The official, declining to be identified, said, "It's a big world with lots of things to do ... You have to have some indication of willingness on their part to take some of the tough decisions." 
The talks on borders, peace and Palestinian self-rule are "festering" and even "stalemated," the official said. 
After a series of stops here, in Jordan; Syria, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Israel, Christopher will report his findings to President Clinton. 
"He'll be inclined to gauge whether or not, as we go around, there's a serious en­deavor here on their part," the official said. 
In Moscow, the Russian For­eign Ministry said it "welcomes this important initiative of the new American administration." 
The statement said Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozsyrev .spoke with Christo­pher by telephone before the trip. It said they discussed sev­eral issues connected with the Middle East peace process but gave no details.

Plane en route to Miami hijacked 
MIAMI (AP) -A gunman seized a hostage at a Haitian airport, hijacked a missionary group's plane with 12 others aboard and ordered it to Miami on Thursday, an official said. 
But the gunman surrendered his weapon to the crew about 2 1/2 hours after he comman­deered the plane, before it reached Miami, said a federal law enforcement source who spoke on condition of anonymity. The source also said the hijacker was a soldier. 
The hijacker shot a hole in the ceiling of the plane before it took off, but no injuries were reported, said Kathleen Bergen, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration in Atlanta. 
The plane, an aging twin-prop DC-3, refueled without incident in Providenciales Island in the Turks and Caicos before flying toward Miami, Bergen said. 
The plane was carrying 10 passengers, all believed to be 
U.S. citizens, and a crew of two when the hijacker boarded with a woman he took hostage on the ground in Cap Haitien in northern Haiti, Bergen said. 
"I have no know idea of any of his demands other than he wants to go to Miami," she said. 
She said the plane was due at Miami International Airport shortly before 7 p.m. 
The FBI was planning to be there when the plane arrived, said Wendi Jackman, airport spokeswoman. The U.S. Cus­toms Service sent up a Citation jet to accompany the plane into the airport, according to the Coast Guard office in Miami. 
It wasn't immediately known whether the hijacking was re­lated to Haitian refugee crisis. Tens of thousands of Haitians have fled the impoverished Caribbean nation by sea since· the army ousted the country's first democratically elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aris­tide, in 1991. 
American policy has been to intercept the refugees at sea, though some have reached Florida. 
The hijacked plane was owned by Missionary Flight International, based in West Palm Beach, Fla. A spokesman for the missionary service said he had no information on the hijacking. 
Bergen said she had no in­formation on security proce-

dures in place at the Cap Hai­tien airport because the FAA doesn't evaluate security there. She said the agency was getting its information on the hijacking from government sources in Haiti. 
DC-3 twin-prop transports, able to carry 21 passengers, began service in 1936 and be­came the most widely used air­liner in history. 
The missionary group's flight had been scheduled to fly back to West Palm Beach, said Dave Bowen, operations director at Palm Beach International Air­port. "They've been based out of this airport for years," he said. "They take food, medical supplies and such to Haiti out of Palm Beach." 
Two Haitian soldiers fired their way aboard another mis­sionary plane in Cap Haitien and landed in Miami in April 1989 after an unsuccessful coup attempt. 
In June 1989, four Haitians hijacked an Antillean Airlines flight during a stop in Haiti and tried to take the plane to New York but were arrested during a stop on the Caribbean island of Curacao. 

CDC: Pregnant minorities at higher risk 
ATLANTA (AP) -The first federal study of births compli­cated by diabetes shows mi­norities are at highest risk be­cause they don't get prenatal care to detect and control the disease, health officials re­ported Thursday. 
"This is a very clear case of a disease where we have clear risks and clear interventions that can prevent serious com­plications," said Robert Ger­man of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "Women must get early and continuous prenatal care." 
Doctors knew that blacks, 
Hispanics, Asians and Indians 
get diabetes more often than 
whites. For example, the rate 
of diabetes in 1989 was 25.2 
cases per 1,000 white women 
compared with 43.4 cases 
among black women. 
They also suspected that mi­
norities were at further risk 
from diabetes during preg­
nancy because they got less 
prenatal care, but they had 
never been able to track that, 
German said.

U.N to pursue war crimes court 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -The five permanent members of the Security Council agreed Thursday that an international court should be set up to punish war eriminals in former Yu­goslavia. 
The United States, Britain, Franee and Russia had backed the concept, but did not win China's support until Thursday, diplomats said. 
The t11xt of a draft resolution they agreed on will ask Secre­tary-General Boutros Boutros­Ghali to study ways to set up the eourt, which would be lim­ited to atrocities in the Yugoslav conflicts. 
The draft text contained little detail on the structure or working of the court. But it said war crimes committed after Jan. 1, 1991, would be pun­ished by the court. Diplomats said that was an arbitrary date. 
Agreement on the text by the five permanent Security Council powers virtually assured passage of the resolution, which was drafted and sponsored by France. 
In October, the Security Council authorized a commis­sion to gather evidence of war crimes, a process similar to that which led to the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals after World War II. 
The 1945-49 Nuremberg tri­als of Nazi war criminals estab­lished a chain of responsibility for collective war crimes. Nazi leaders -including Hermann Goering, Martin Bormann and Joachim von Ribbentrop ­were condemned to death. 
The U.N. commission, led by Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Poland's first post-Communist premier, has said it was overwhelmed by reports of atrocities. It said crimes were committed by all sides in the Balkan conflict, but blamed Serbs for the bulk of them. 
Among its findings were mass graves; evidence of systematic rape of Muslim women by Serbs; and the "ethnic cleansing" campaigns of terror to drive minorities from areas dominated by a particular group. 
Any trials from the wars in former Yugoslav states would be based on the 1949 Geneva Convention on the treatment of civilians during war. The con­vention outlaws mass deporta­tions and attacks on civilians, hospitals and mercy missions. 

ANC agrees to 5 years of multiparty rule 
SOWETO, South Africa (AP)­The African National Congress (ANC) formally agreed on Thursday to govern jointly with whites and other parties for up to five years after the end of apartheid. 
The announcement, following three days of meetings by the ANC's top leaders, was seen as an important compromise in the delicate black-white political negotiations. 
But the ANC also tried to as­sure supporters it would hold the strongest share of power if, as expected, it captured the country's first all-race election. Militant members of the na­tion's biggest black party had opposed multiparty rule. 
"The objective will be to unite our country, to bring about stability, to ensure we embark 
SECURITY BEAT 

on a reconstruction program with other parties," Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC's secre­tary-general, said at a news conference in this black town­ship outside Johannesburg. 
At this point, key differences remain between the govern­ment and ANC. But they appear to be converging on the idea of a multiracial, multiparty government that would lead South Africa out of the apartheid era. 
Ramaphosa said joint rule would not last more than five years, while President F. W. de Klerk has spoken of permanent power-sharing entrenched in a new constitution. 
All parties receiving at least five percent of the vote in a multiracial election would be represented in the interim government, but the largest party would wield the most power, Ramaphosa said. That likely would be the ANC. 
"Our idea ... means the prin­ciple of majority rule should not be sacrificed in any way," Ramaphosa said. 
He said the ANC opposed de Klerk's plan for an interim government on grounds it would give too much power to minority parties such as whites. 
"We see minority powers not having the power to frustrate decisions," Ramaphosa said. 
The ANC also favors a strong presidency, while de Klerk has called for a weak presidency possibly to be shared among leaders of the largest political parties.

Nuclear plant sues Westinghouse 
PORTLAND -The operator of the Trojan nuclear plant sued Westinghouse Electric Corp. for fraud Wednesday, saying it sold a defective steam generator system that led to the plant's shutdown 18 years early. No specific claim for monetary damages was listed in the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh. Estimates for the bill to close the plant early have ranged to more than a half-billion dollars. Westinghouse spokeswoman called the lawsuit groundless. PGE and Westinghouse have been pointing fingers at each other since the utility decided Jan. 4 to shut down Trojan because of microscopic cracks in steam generator tubes. The lawsuit claims Westinghouse knew that the steam generator designed for the nuclear plant was faulty and steam tubes were subject to corrosion and cracking. 
Investors wary about Clintonts plan
NEW YORK -Worried investors sold more stocks in a second day of market apprehension over President Clinton's tax~ boosting economic plan. The losses on Wall Street weren't as severe as on Tuesday, when the Dow Jones average of 30 big~ company stocks posted the biggest single~day drop since November 1991. The Dow average rose slightly, but stocks in general were broadly lower. Market analysts attributed the behavior to twin concerns about Clinton's plan: raising taxes on most Americans will stall an economic recovery, and cuts in government spending are far less than envisioned. 
Head of S&L Agency To Resign
WASHINGTON-The head of the agency that disposes of failed savings and loan institutions, Albert V. Casey,. will resign in two months, he told employees Thursday. Casey,72, is also president of the Resolution Trust Corp. He was appointed by the Bush administration to reorganize the agency which was suffering under a convoluted management structure that included two boards. The agency takes over failed S&Ls and dismantles them, either by closing them or selling off the assets. A former postmaster general and former chairman of American Airlines, Casey let it be known privately that he would stay on at the agency if the Clinton administration asked. 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Presi­dent Clinton's proposed energy tax is designed to spread the pain, but it takes its hardest toll on the users of petroleum ­motorists who will pay higher gasoline prices and people who heat their homes with oil. 
The Energy Department es­timated that the tax will prompt new conservation and by the end of the decade reduce oil imports by 350,000 barrels a day. But the department said the tax is not severe enough to prompt significant switching of fuels. 
The tax, which if approved by Congress would be phased in over three years beginning in July 1994, is pegged to the amount of energy content in each fuel as measured by Btu, or British thermal unit. Only solar and wind power are ex­empted from the tax, officials said. 
According to the Treasury Department, the tax when it comes into full force would raise the price of a gallon of ga­soline by 7 1/2 cents a gallon, home-heating oil by 8 1/4 cents, natural gas by 26 1/4 cents per thousand cubic feet and the average monthly electric bill by $2.25. 
On average nationwide, the tax was estimated to cost a family of four, with an income of $40,000 a year, an additional 

Energy tax hits petroleum users 
$118 annually in increased costs for electricity, heating and transportation by 1997, accord­ing to department estimates. 
But different fuels have dif­ferent energy content and the tax is structured to take particular aim at oil. 
Petroleum, which already is more expensive than coal and natural gas per unit of energy it releases, will be taxed at more than twice the rate -60 cents per million BTUs -applied to other energy sources. Coal, natural gas, nuclear and hydro­electric energy will have a tax of 26 cents per million BTUs. 
One British thermal unit is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit. 
The average residential household uses about 100 mil­lion Btus of energy a year, about a third of that for electricity, according to Cambridge Energy Research Associates. 
Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary said the tax would "reduce our reliance on unsta­ble foreign sources of oil" curb­ing petroleum use. 
The tax brought quick criti­cism from the petroleum indus­try. 
"It's a thinly disguised gaso­line tax ... and a job killer on a mammoth scale," said Charles 
Clinton: Airlines should blame themselves 
WASHINGTON (AP) -A con­gressional investigation of the airline industry's money mis­eries began Wednesday with the Clinton administration chiding airlines for contributing to their own woes by overexpanding. 
Other critics, including the head of USAir, were far harsher. Some accused the nation's three largest airlines of adding hundreds of planes to their fleets to drive smaller competitors out of business. 
The so-called Big Three ­United, Delta and American ­said their expansion has been prudent. 
The growth has been ''far more than needed." said Patrick Murphy, an acting assistant secretary of transportation testifying for the administration. lie said recent expansion by the Big Three equaled the creation of two IHJW major airlines. 
Hut he told a !louse Public 
Works subcommittee on avia­tion that the major airlines ap­peared to be well-intentioned, anticipating additional passen­gers who never appeared. 
"The industry was used to a level of growth we haven't seen in five years," Murphy said. Airline travel is about the same as 1988. 
The industry has lost $8 bil­lion over the last three years. 
Elsewhere in the capital, Robert Daniell, chief executive officer of United Technologies Corp.. told labor representatives and Connecticut lawmakers that the industry situation is worsening. Calls come in daily from airlines and air frame makers canceling or reducing orders, said Daniell, whose company is the parent of jet engine maker Pratt & Whitney. 
Daniell hinted that his com­pany may have to lay off more than it announced just last month, which was 10,000 over the next two years. "That number is not fixed in con­crete," he said. "It's a function of the business volume which is still changing -unfortunately negatively." 
The administration is con­cerned that airlines will go out of business, reducing competi­tion in the industry, Murphy said. "A lot of damage could be done while we wait for eco­nomic growth," he said. 
Murphy appeared in place of Transportation Secretary Fed­erico Pena, who was working on parts of President Clinton's economic package to be un­veiled Wednesday night. 
Pena joined congressional leaders Tuesday in proposing a commission to develop solutions to the airline industry's problems within 90 days. 
The aviation subcommittee, headed by Rep. Jim Oberstar, D-Minn., will hold three days of hearings this week and next. 

Oberstar and Public Works Committee Chairman Norman Mineta, D-Calif.. questioned why the Big Three expanded so aggressively when the economy was in recession. 
Some airlines "seem to be concerned primarily that the plague ·will recede before killing off your pesky neighbor," Mineta said. "It is not at all clear that the industry is unanimous in wanting a cure for the plague, at least not a cure that arrives too quickly." 
Oberstar said that from 1988 to 1992 the Big Three added 445 aircraft while the rest of the industry reduced their fleets by 149 planes. 
"The miscalculation was driven by the Big Three, the ones with deep pockets. not the whole industry," he said. 
Kuwait continues to test OPEC cartel's resolve 
VIENNA, Austria (APJ -OPEC's uneasy resolve to cut oil output will be sorely tested these next few weeks by mem­bers who took exception to the accord. 
The cartel ended four days of tough negotiations late Tuesday by pledging to curb runaway oil production, sending a message it was intent on keeping crude prices from falling further this spring. 
But there was initial skepti­cism the dozen nations of the Organization of Petroleum Ex­porting Countries would live up to their promises this time around. 
"The next few weeks will be key," said Ann-Louise Hittle, senior oil analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York. "They'll be eyeing each other very closely because they're obviously anxious to protect market share." Kuwait, which is trying to bring its oil production back to the levels before it was invaded by Iraq, told other members it would fight back if anyone cheats on the deal. 
Kuwaiti Oil Minister Ali al­Baghli told reporters his coun­try would pump to capacity "at the first sign that the others are not respecting" their new out­put limits. 
Such overproduction could wreck the deal and cause oil prices to tumble. 
The accord calls for cutting nearly 1.5 million barrels of oil a day from current levels on March 1. setting the new pro­duction ceiling at 23.6 million barrels a day through June. 
The oil markets initially re­acted with pessimism to the ac­cord, which follows several failed attempts to cut output. Light sweet crude for March delivery slipped 45 cents a bar­rei to $19.53 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
The average price of an OPEC marker has been running more than $3 a barrel under the cartel's target of $21 a 42­gallon barrel. 
OPEC desperately sought the output cutback because of fear prices would plunge in the spring, when oil demand typi­cally eases in the United States and other big oil-consuming nations. 
OPEC Secretary-General Subroto predicted the clamp­down on producton would have a "substantial impact on the market." 
But Paul Mlotok, head of en­ergy research at Morgan Stan­ley in New York, said that "oil prices should remain stable in the range" of the last few weeks. 
The agreement nearly un­raveled Tuesday morning after Iran, Nigeria and others turned down Kuwait's demand for as­surances it could pump more in the summer. 

Kuwait, rebounding from Persian Gulf War damage to its oil fields, had argued it should be given an exemption because it needs to pump as much as possible to pay off $50 billion in costs for the war and recon­struction. 
But Saudi Arabia, the cartel's most influential member and the world's No. 1 oil producer, pressed it to accept cutbacks. Nigeria, a large impoverished nation, also insisted Kuwait contribute. 
Under the new accord, Saudi Arabia can produce 8 million barrels a day in spring, down from about 8.4 million barrels a day. 
Iran, the cartel's No. 2 pro­ducer, was given an output level DiBona. president of the Amer­ican Petroleum Institute. The API predicted that gasoline prices could jump as much as 10 to 15 cents, much higher than Energy Department esti­mates. 
of 3.3 million barrels a  day,  
down  from  January's  3.5  
million barrels a day.  

Environmentalists said that the tax represented a step to­ward reducing carbon dioxide emissions and help combat the so-called greenhouse effect and global warming because it would curb some use of fossil fuels. especially coal and oil. 
But because the tax also ap­plies to nuclear power. hydro­electric power and natural gas, energy experts said they did not expect a significant shifting of fuels and most reductions in use of fossil fuels would likely come through conservation. 
Critics of the tax, including many Republican lawmakers, were expected to argue that the tax will make U.S. industry less competitive with foreign com­panies and unfairly affect the poor. 
Jobless 
benefits 



extended 
WASHINGTON {AP} Democrats rushed the first item of President Clinton's economic program to the House floor on Thursday, giving committee approval to a $5.6 billion measure that extends unemployment benefits for the longterm jobless. 
In a preview of the year's political tensions, Republicans complained that their efforts to alter the $5.6 billion legislation were thwarted by Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee. 
"On the one hand Clinton extends an olive branch to Re­publicans,'' complained Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas. "You saw what happened -they wouldn't take any amend­ment." 
The panel sent the bill to a House on a voice vote; it cast a party-line, 23-14 vote to limit amendments on the House floor. Debate is set for next Wednesday. 
"This is the opening shot," Archer said. "If that's going to be the policy all the way through, they they've got the votes to pass whatever they want to. Anything we might propose is not going to go anywhere." 
The measure provides for another seven-month exten­sion of the emergency unem­ployment compensation pro­gram, which gives workers who have exhausted their regular, 26-weeks worth of state unemployment benefits with up to another 26 weeks or benefits. 
Right now, the program is set to expire March 7. and Congress plans to pass the new extension by that date. The emergency legislation would extend it through early October; no one who filed a claim after Oct. 2, 1993, would be eligible. Those in the program before that could get benefits until Jan. 15, 1994.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Dear Editor: 

Hegarding the Feb. 12 ac­count of the Louis Putz lecture on Lourdes, I would like to offer what I believe is an important clarification of the "handful of the supposed healings ... scien­tifically appraised as 'miracles.'" 
First of all. medical authori­ties do not make a determina­tion as to whether a cure is a "miraele." The Ordinary of the diocese in which the cured per­son lives makes that determi­nation. Since 1858, only 65 bishops -on the basis of overwhelming medical evidence -have seen fit to publicly confirm that specific healings at Lourdes are "miracles" attributed to Divine interven­tion. That does not mean other cures, found to be medically in­explicable by competent medi-cal committees on the basis of overwhelming medical evi­dence, are not "miracles." 

For example, some bishops believe there is no need to fur­ther document the power of God or the intervention of His Blessed Mother. Moreover, de­terminations that a cure is, in fact, a miracle commonly take from ten to twenty-five or even thirty-five years. 
Secondly, in 1990, the direc­tor of the Lourdes Medical Bu­reau reported that "more than 2,000" cures at Lourdes have been found to be "medically in­explicable" by physicians of the International Medical Commit­tee, which is comprised of men and women who are Catholic, non-Catholic, agnostics and atheists. 
Thirdly, it may be helpful to know the criteria for a "medically inexplicable cure." First, the ailm.ent must have been incurable and life-threat­ening. Second, the problem must be organic, not functional: that is, it cannot be something like Joss of speech, unconnected with a cerebral lesion. 
Third, tests such as X-rays and biopsies must conclusively prove existence of a disease. 
Fourth, the ailment cannot be L attributed to any medical­treatment which was or could have been applied. Fifth, the cure must be (a) unexpected; 
(b) 
sudden or spontaneous; and 

(c) 
complete and without conva­lescence. Sixth, the ailment must not recur for at least three years.

Dear Editor: 

As a member of the 1993 Sophomore Literary Festival Committee, I would like to in­vite all Notre Dame students, faculty, and staff to attend the Twenty-Sixth Annual Sopho­more Literary Festival. Running from Feb. 21 through Feb. 25, the Festival will feature five writers on the cutting-edge of contemporary American literature. 
This year's guests encompass diverse styles and themes in their works while sharing a flair for controversy and inno­vation. 1\vo of them, poet Nikki Giovanni and novelist Gloria Naylor, poignantly recount their experiences as African­American women, while activist Marge Piercy infuses her books, poems, and plays with scathing reflections on gender and racial inequity. Former journalist Tim O'Brien revives the anguished intensity of the Vietnam War in his works of fiction, and celebrated dramatist Edward Albee captures the turbulence of that bewildering era in his provocative classic, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? 
Parting curtains on the past 
GARRY TRUDEAU QUOTE OF THE DAY 
to shed light into the future, these Festival participants challenge their audiences to a better understanding of them­selves and a greater respect for others. 
The Festival opens on Sunday with Nikki Giovanni, continues with Tim O'Brien on Monday, Gloria Naylor on Tuesday, and Marge Piercy on Wednesday, and concludes with Edward Al­bee on Thursday. In addition to giving readings each night at 
8:00 pm in the Library Audito­rium, the headliners will meet informally with their audiences in discussions, classes, and book signings. 
Wherever your interests or ideology lies, I encourage you to take advantage of these op­portunities to interact with those who rouse the conscience of our culture. Whether they provoke you to anger, move you to tears, or just open your eyes to a new perspective on the world, time spent in their company will not be time wasted.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Parents are the ke 
"We never had a lot of money growing up ... But my parents always said we kids were going to have a college education... Then, when I was accepted at Notre Dame, that was like the biggest thing in their lives." 
With faces alive with love and admiration, this was just one of the many stories that had in­troduced me to the Notre Dame parent; someone I have come to appreciate as truly at the center of Notre Dame's greatness.

And that which we call Notre Dame in simplest terms is a process by which we exercise, enrich and hopefully celebrate these qualities in a very special way. And, that our ability to draw students together that are best able to learn from one an­other and to surround them with challenge and support that ignites the magic of these in­fused dreams, and plays them out on a most magnificent stage represents our stewardship of this gift called Notre Dame. 
If so, is that not further affir­mation that it is the parents that history must accord the mantle of providing the key in­gredient to the greatness achieved here? 
In each of the 450 plus stu­dent one-on-one's I have par­ticipated in, there would always be at least one moment where the depth of this family pres­ence expressed itself. Not sur­prising was that the students were looking to copy that vision in their own lives. 
One of the most beautiful came a few semesters ago when a business major confided that each day she had a growing sense that her place was to return to the native American village of her grandparents to help that community build a better life. It had been only the previous semester that a lad had made a similar com­mitment to his family's village on the Mexican border. 
Then, it was to share the 
beauty of a student who feared that he would miss being able to pass on the cohesiveness that had been shared by a family of modest means who had taken the time to understand and celebrate the empowerment of acquiring their first car, first house and of course sending the first offspring for a college education. 
The reason... he had just signed an employment contract that would put enough money in his pocket to compress a lifetime of goals into an instant. How was he to preserve and recreate the memories and culture he cherished for his family? 
It was just last semester when a young woman confided that though she was very pleased with the selection of her major and was doing very well in her course work, each day she was becoming more attracted to the role of wife and mother that (you guessed it) her mother had played in her family's life. 
Adding a sense of order, pri­ority, empowerment from their family experiences, however, usually manifested itself in less dramatic ways. Observations on concern, dedication, effort, understanding, patience, care, hope and love were only to be­gin the list of razor sharp im­prints students carried as fam­ily-based tools that were form­ing the foundation for their life decisions. 
About this time I couldn't help but stop and think about those pre-teen pictures dotting The Observer birthday vignettes that had become such a daily part of this newspaper. Maybe they were doing more than celebrating the durability of this family love. Maybe they also served to rechallenge those blessed with student care with the depth of parental challenge to and belief in this Notre Dame.

Hartley introduces ~~Silent Men" 
By KENYA JOHNSON 
Assistant Accent Editor 

Noted independent film maker Hal Hartley will be in South 
Bend Feb. 21 to introduce his latest work, "Simple Men," at 
8 p.m. at the Morris Civic Auditorium. "Simple Men,"a quirky and sophisticated portrayal of life's 
absurdities. revolves _around two radically dissimilar 
brothers locked together in a search for their missing father, 
who happens to be a legendary New York Yankees shortstop 
who has gone underground after being accused of a 60s 
political bombing. Each brother-one an angry ex-con and 
the other a quiet, bookish observer-has questions that can 
only be answered by their father. 
The department-chose the Moris Civic Auditorium for the 
event so that it could screen a new 35-mm print of the film, 
accommodate a larger audience, and "because the 
auditorium's grand scale is reminiscent of how luxurious an 
evening at the movies used to be," said Jim Collins, associate 
professor and associate chair of communications and 
theater. 

Hartley has earned an international reputation as a self­made, truly independent film maker who avoids Hollywood producers and exorbitant budgets. Droll and minimalist. his style has been compared to French film maker Jean-Luc Godard and the French "new wave" of the 1960s, although his characters and stories are distinctly American. In his work he explores the problems ofnegotiating a moral life full of love, adventure, politics and pain. 
Tickets are available at the door or in advance at the 
LaFortune information desk for $5. Doors will open at 7 p.m.

Pitchers and catchers begin their springs 
The big day that baseball fans waited for all winter arrived Thursday, and not even a little rain in Florida and Arizona could dampen spirits: Spring training has started! 
Pitchers and catchers from 15 of the 28 teams reported to camp in places like Vero Beach, Sarasota and Scottsdale, with the first official workouts planned for Friday. 
Before breaking out the bats and balls, however, there was other business to attend to after a busy off-season in which players changed teams like never before. 
In Bradenton, Fla., the Pittsburgh Pirates began preparing to win their fourth straight NL East title after losing the Jikes of Barry Bonds, Doug Drabek, Jose Lind, Danny Jackson, Roger Mason, Alex Cole and others. The Pirates hope new players in camp named Young, Garcia, Martin, Backlund and DeLos Santos can take their place. 
"Maybe they should hand out those little name tags to everyone; like they wear at conventions, that say, 'Hi, my name is .. .'" center fielder Andy Van Slyke said. 
At least a lot of the Pirates know each other. In Tucson, Ariz., 63 players reported for the expansion Colorado Rockies' first camp, and they spent a lot of time making introductions. 
"Whenever I meet someone new -which is almost everybody around here -I repeat their name three times to myself," said Steve Reed, who pitched 18 games for the San Francisco Giants last season. 
"There are 63 guys here, and I'm the only guy from the Giants organization. Trying to remember each guy's name, all the way from reporters to the clubhouse guys to the front-office guys and especially my fellow players, well, it's difficult," he said. 
The one pitcher who needs no introduction this spring is Nolan Ryan, who will be playing his record 27th and final season this year. 
Ryan, 46, was not among the 32 players who reported to the Texas Rangers' camp on Thursday. He's expected at Port Charlotte, Fla., next week and will work out for the first time on either Feb. 28 or March 1.

In Port St. Lucie, Fla., New York Mets manager Jeff Torborg said he will approach this spring training with a looser reign, mainly because he knows his veterans better. 
"Our practices will be about an hour shorter," he said...And I'm going to watch the kids early. The veteran players I know." 
Three of those young players, center fielder Ryan Thompson, second baseman Jeff Kent and catcher Todd Hundley begin the spring as starters for a team that finished a disappointing fifth in the NL East last year. 
While pitchers and catchers are the only ones scheduled to be in camp this early, other players are showing up. 
Dale Murphy, limited to just 18 games last season because o knee problems, joined 12 other Philaelphia players in a workout two days before the start of the Phillies' camp in Oearwater, Fla. 
Bert Blyleven, back with his third stint with Minnesota, was an early arrival at the Twins' camp in Fort Myers, Fla.

Bo Jackson returns to diamond 
SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -Bo Jackson took a few more steps Wednesday in his bid to return to baseball with an artificial hip, working out at the Chicago White Sox camp a day before spring training officially starts. 
Jackson, with a barely notice­able limp, ran the bases, took batting practice and fielded grounders at first base. His 40­minute session came under the watchful eye of team trainers and a few fans who wandered into Ed Smith Stadium. 
Jackson worked out earlier this year at Comiskey Park in Chicago, running sprints through the corridors. He ar­rived in Sarasota on Monday and began drills designed to determine whether he will be able to play this year after missing the entire 1992 season. 
So far in Florida, Jackson has not tried to slide on the bases. 
"I don't forsee a problem," White Sox trainer Herm Schneider said. "He'll slide head-first on his right side." 
Jackson did not comment on his progress. He has told the White Sox public relations de­partment that he does not plan to speak with reporters about his return. 
Jackson, 30, underwent hip replacement surgery last April. He has spent almost a year getting accustomed to the plas­tic-and-metal prothesis in his left hip. 
Pitchers and catchers are scheduled to report to Chicago's camp on Thursday, and the first workout is set for Friday. The rest of the team is to report next Tuesday and practice the following day. 
Jackson's comeback is sure to be the main attraction for the White Sox this spring. The team

already has featured Jackson in its preseason ticket advertising, and hopes he will be able to provide some of the excitement he did before being injured in January 1991 in an NFL playoff game for the Los Angeles Raiders. 
Jackson's last full season in the majors was 1990, when he hit .272 with 28 home runs and 78 RBis for Kansas City. He played 111 games, most of them in the outfield. 
Jackson was released by the Royals in March 1991 and signed by the White Sox in April. He went through a reha­bilitation program that took him through the minors, and returned to the majors in September, hitting .225 with three homers and 14 RBis in 23 games, all of them as a des­ignated hitter. 
Next week, Jackson will likely move into the outfield for workouts. As much as the White Sox would like to see Jackson be able to play outfield this season, they would be happy to see him healthy enough to serve as the full-time designated hitter. 
Jackson, a former Heisman Trophy running back at Auburn, is the only player to be an All-Star in the major leagues and the NFL. He was the most valuable player of the 1989 All­Star game at Anaheim Stadium, leading off the bottom of the first inning with a home run and later showing off his speed.

Former champ Larry Holmes sued in L.A. 
LOS ANGELES (AP) -Orange County fight promoters are suing former heavyweight boxing champion Larry Holmes, claiming he broke a contract by refusing to complete a four-fight deal. 
Jury selection is scheduled to begin Friday in U.S. District Court. 
Promoter Bob Rey met Holmes at a celebrity roast in 1990 and interested him in making a comeback, said Frank J. Lizarraga Jr., an attorney for Rey and his associate, Jason Schlessinger. 
Holmes, the WBC heavyweight champion from 1978-84, fought one bout against Tim (Doc) Anderson, which he won easily, but he declined to fight again for the promoters, they claimed. He has since had fights for other promoters. 
The dispute has led to lawsuits by each side, and the promoters' company, LBA Associates Inc. of Newport Beach, Calif.. has filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in 
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa 
Ana. 

Earlier this week, a Pennsylvania state judge ruled against the promoters and negated their deal with Holmes. A motion by Holmes' lawyers to overturn the federal case here was rejected, however, and trial began Wednesday.

"Chavez is No. 1," said Azumah Nelson, who will de­fend the WBC super feather­weight title against Mexican Gabriel Ruelas on the card. Nelson, however, made it clear that he is not including himself when he ranks Chavez as the best. 
The 25-year-old Norris and the 25-year-old Blocker both

Another delay in signing Lewis-Tucker contract 
LONDON (AP) -The signing of King and Tucker were in Mex­
a contract for the scheduled May 8 title fight in Las Vegas between WBC heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis and Tony Tucker has been delayed. 
Lewis' manager on Thursday blamed financial demands by promoter Don King. 
Frank Maloney said that un­der WBC rules, Lewis is entitled to 80 percent of the $12.16 mil­lion purse for making his de­fense in the challenger's home country. But Maloney said King, Tucker's promoter, was demanding a 7 5-25 split. 
The deadline for the signing of a contract had been set for Friday, but Maloney said it was unlikely the deal will be com­pleted by then. Instead, he said the WBC had decided to vote on whether to accept King's de­mands.

"The fight is not in doubt," he said. "Everything else has been agreed on." 
Maloney expressed disdain at King's tactics. 
''I'm sure Don King will come up with something else next week," he said. "I hope King tries more tricks. It only makes Lennox more angry, more de­termined." 
Lewis' camp has included a clause in the contract that for­bids King from making any di­rect contact with the British fighter. 
Maloney discounted any pos­sibility of a unification bout against Riddick Bowe, who holds the WBA and IBF titles. He said Lewis was already look­ing ahead to a second defense this summer in ·England, pos­sibly against fellow Briton Frank Bruno.

Men's track at Indiana meet 
By SEAN SULLIVAN Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's track team competes this weekend in the Indiana lntercollegiates~ held at Indiana University in Bloomington. 
The meet will be scored but will not feature many of the Irish top performers. Absent from this competition will be Mike McWilliams. Nate Ruder, Mike Miller and Todd Herman.

"This is going to be the year," comments Hall. If focused, this should be the case. But if his mind slips look for Senior Fred Sharkey to benefit. 
150-pound 

Joe Carrigan returns from a year ofT as the big favorite. He won the weight class two years ago and looks to earn his sec­ond title. Steve Clar, a junior from Morrissey hall, stands as Carrigan's biggest challenge in the sophomore loaded division. 
155-pound

160-pound 

This shines as the strongest division with two top fighters who could be the clear cut fa­vorite if they were five pounds lighter. Jeff Goddard used a quick jab to reach the finals at 155-pounds a year ago and must be considered the fa­vorite. Goddard will receive strong competition in the form of junior Kevin Mullaney who fell to Goddard in the semifinals last year. 
"I think there are some really good fighters this year, and it is going to be a tough road to the finals," said Goddard. 
165-pound 

This experienced group is highlighted by the skills of Brian Weiford and Jamie Bailey. Bailey could be a serious contender. He is one of two former wrestlers in the Bouts and has looked impressive during training. 
"Brian's pretty good," said Bailey. "But I think that I can do alright. My wrestling skills help me out, help me with my balance and my quickness."

Women's track looks to rebound at IU 
By MIKE NORBUT

The Notre Dame women's 
track team will travel to 
Bloomington, IN, this afternoon 
to compete in the Indiana Col­
legiates, featuring teams from 
across the state, including Indi­
ana, Purdue, and Ball 
State-Notre Dame's nemesis in 
last week's Ball State 
Invitational. 
Individual standouts for the 
Irish included Becky Alfieri, 
who won the 1000 meter run, 
past Tim Mahoney in the open­ing round. Brendan Nelligan and Mike Epperly appear most likely to meet O'Rourke in Friday's finals. 
"The division has some pretty good guys. Nelligan has a really stiff, powerful right," said O'Rourke, "and Epperly is also a very good fighter." 
185-pound 

Eric Poley, a veteran of Bengal Bouts, is the favorite in this depleted field. Only four boxers are competing for the title. Joining Poley is sopho­more Harry Zembillas who seems likely to be in the finals. 
195-pound 

Jeff Lyman and Shawn Duffy are the only two boxers in the division. Take you pick. 
Heavyweight 

Matt Carr was the winner a year ago and is the early fa­vorite. His opponent is football player Huntley Bakich. If Bakich, a sophomore, shows as much promise in the ring as he did during brief moments on the football field his freshman year, this could be quite a bat­tle.

"I felt that we did reasonably well last week," said coach Joe Piane. "We can always im­prove, though." 
The Irish will be without freshman sprinter Erica Peter­son, who will be travelling to Winnipeg, Canada, for the Canadian Nationals. Last week, Peterson ran the 800 meters for the first time during the indoor track season, placing second behind Western Michigan runner Jill Stamison. In previ­ous meets, Peterson has won many sprinting events, includ­ing the 55 meter hurdles, the 200, and the 400 meter dash. 
"This is not the most impor­tant meet of the year for us," continued coach Piane. "We're giving our runners a chance to try different events to help them with their times in their regular races."

:. Virginia completes season sweep 
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -Once able to hold the upper hand over all of college basket­ball, Duke now can't even do it in its own conference. 
Thomas Hill missed a 3­pointer at the buzzer Thursday night. giving No. 23 Virginia a 58-55 victory over the seventh­ranked Blue Devils. 
It marked the first time since 1990 that Duke lost back-to­hack games to anybody, and the first time since 1990 the Blue Devils were swept by an Atlantic Coast Conference op­ponent. 
"I think all that is good. That means we've had a hell of a few years," eoach Mike Krzyzewski said. "That doesn't mean it's over, but I would always like somebody to say it's been four years or three years -as long as it's losses. If it's wins, then I'm baek selling Polish sausages in Chicago." 
Virginia (16-5, 8-4 ACC) took sole possession of fourth place in the league and dumped Duke (19-5, 7-5) into the league's seeond tier. 
"I don't think I've ever felt as good about an offensive per­formance as ugly as that one," said Virginia coaeh Jeff Jones, whose Cavaliers shot 36.8 per­cent and had 18 turnovers. 
"It's a disappointing loss for us," Krzyzewski said, "because I thought our kids were ready. But I'm not down on my team. I think it's the type of thing where our younger guys can improve on it and show matu­rity." 
Cory Alexander scored 20 points and Ted Jeffries 10 for Virginia, which last month broke Duke's 36-game ACC home winning streak. 
Duke, playing in its first game sinee losing leading scorer Grant Ifill to a sprained toe, got 16 from Cherokee Parks and 14 from Thomas Hill, who was held scoreless in the final 16 minutes. 
"I think it's evident that we're not as deep a team as people might think," Krzyzewski said. "I would say we'll be there. I'm just not sure when that will be." 
Duke trailed in much of the first half, when the Blue Devils shot 32 percent and had nine turnovers. But Duke picked up the pace after halftime, forcing nine lead changes and four ties before Virginia again gained the upper hand.

Morrissey defeats 0-C in lnterhall Basketball, 42-31 ..

Following two tough road losses to Kentucky and Ten­nessee last weekend, the Notre Dame women's tennis team is hoping that the familiar con­fines of the Eck Tennis Pavilion will help reverse their fortunes. The Irish, in only their second

Sports Writer 
Using a tenacious press and taking advantage of high per­centage shooting,. the Morrissey Manor now hold the title of interhall basketball champions after knocking off a strong Off­Campus squad 42-31. 
Point guard Steve Clear was the motivating factor behind the Morrissey victory, dominating the game in the first half. As coach Andy Curoe noted, "Steve started things off right for us, controlling the tempo, and the rest of the team followed his lead." 
Morrissey opened the game using its 1-2-2 press to force turnovers and bad passes, while making almost every shot it attempted in the first few minutes. Most of these baskets were the result of Clear's ef­forts, as he time and again beat his man to the basket and dished the ball out to sharp­shooters Torn Sear and Mike Martin. 
The first half was character­ized by up-tempo play, with 
both teams running at every opportunity. However, this worked to Morrissey's advan­tage. 
"We substituted every three or four minutes to keep our guys fresh. Also, our big men, 
. Brian Corbett and Brendan Tully, ran the floor extremely well, which forced 0-C's Brian Ratigan and Eric Jones to play both ends," Curoe said. 
0-C captain Todd -Reynders concurred with this, saying, "It's obvious that they play to­gether more than we do. Their press caused a lot of problems, and when we were able to set up in the half court, we had one pass and a shot rather than moving it around." 
Inside play was a key factor as well, since the biggest ques­tion before the game was how Morrissey's inside players would fare against the power of Ratigan, Jones, and Ray Griggs. This question was quickly answered by Corbett and Tully, both of whom blocked numerous shots and effectively clogged the lane. In fact the key to the game was the rebounding of the Morrissey team as a whole, since all five players crashed the boards, reducing 0-.C's second chance shots to a minimum. 

After running out to a 26-10 halftime lead, Morrissey with­stood a slight second half rally, as 0-C took advantage of Clear sitting on the bench with foul trouble. Both Griggs and shooting guard Brad Leshnock hit a couple of three pointers to close the gap, but Morrissey was able to hold out with tight defense played by Joe Godin and John Neal. 
Any chance at an 0-C fourth quarter rally was ended by the patient Morrissey spread of­fense, which ran the clock down and kept the ball in the hands of Clear and Sear, forcing 0-C into desperation fouling. The game ended to the rhythmic clapping of the hundred-plus Morrissey faithful who watched their team earn the title.

Although unranked, both LSU and TCU will be shooting for an upset of the twenty­second ranked Irish. 
"These will not be easy matches," warned Faustrnann. "Overall, we're probably pretty evenly matched with these teams." 
Tholen added, "I remember from playing LSU the last two years that they're a scrappy, fighting team. Even if we get up early, we can't slow up be­cause they will not give up." 
Playing in the Eck Pavilion, the Irish hope, will be a big in­fluence for the team.

Maradonna makes his return for Argentina 
(AP) -Diego Maradona re­
turned to international soccer 
for the first time in 2 1/2 years 
as Argentina and Brazil played 
a 1-1 tie Thursday night. 
The 32-year-old forward 
hadn't played for Argentina's 
national team since the 1-0 
loss to Germany in the World 
Cup final on July 8, 1990. The 
2 1/2-year absence included a 
15-rnonth suspension for 
cocaine use imposed by the 
Italian League on April 6, 
1991, following a positive test 
that March 17. 
"This is a marvelous day. I was anxiously waiting for this," Maradona said after the match. "Before I reached the stadium I was moved to hear so many young people chanting my name." 
Maradona didn't score, but made some fine passes, espe­cially in the second half. He neatly put the ball between de­fenders Mauro Silva and Cafu to Gabriel Batistuta, whose shot narrowly missed the goal, caused a roar that shook the flag-decked grandstands in River Plate Stadium, filled with about 75,000 fans.

Water polo to host MAC tourney 
By MIKE NORBUT 
Sports Writer 

The Notre Dame water polo team will be in action this weekend as it will host the very first tournament of the newly formed Mid-American water polo Conference, including Northern Illinois, Bowling Green, and Southern Illinois. 
"We're looking forward to this tournament, since practice can be quite monotonous," said freshman Walter Morrissey. "We are really happy to be hosting a tournament and are confident that we'll play well in front of the home crowd." 
The Irish will be getting back into tournament play after nearly a three month layoff. In their last tournament, held November 21 in DeKalb, IL, the team finished a respectable fourth place, considering they had only eight healthy players available for the trip. 
In their first game, Notre Dame held strong against a Hoffman Estates, IL, club team before losing 9-7. The team bounced back in the second

game, trouncing Southern Illi­nois 16-3, but lost to a Milwau­kee men's club team 8-7 in the third place game. 
This weekend, the Irish will be healthy and ready to com­pete in front of the home crowd. Returning for the team will be junior Ed Padinske and freshman Brian Wood, both of whom missed the previous tournament due to injuries. However, Notre Dame will be without player/coach Tony Buczkowski, and will look to Chris O'Hara, Eric Schultz, and co-captains Joe Dummer and Brian Coughlin to pick up the slack both offensively and de­fensively. 
"There's no doubt that these teams are coming here expect­ing to win," commented Dum­mer, who will split duties with Schultz this weekend at the hole-man position. "Our job is to disappoint them." 
The tournament is scheduled to start Friday evening and continue through Saturday afternoon. All games will be held at the Rolfs Aquatic Cen­ter at the J.A.C.C. 
Irish tennis beat Texas in second round of indoors 
Special to the Observer 
LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY-The University of Notre Dame men's tennis team, ranked sixth in the country, defeated tenth-ranked Texas on Thursday, 4-3, in the second round of the 1993 USTA-ITA 
Men's  National  Indoor  
Intercollegiate  Team  
Championship.  The  win  

improves Notre Dame's record to 4-2, while the Longhorns drop to 2-1. 
Notre Dame, which received a first round bye in the event, will now face top-ranked USC on Friday in the quarterfinals at 12 noon. USC was a 4-3 winner over Alabama-Birmingham on Thursday and had a 6-0 record on the season. The match against the Trojans is a rematch of last spring's NCAA Championship semifinal, in which the Irish upset the de­fending national champion by a 5-l count. 
In the win over Texas, Notre Dame won at the top three sin­gles positions over players all ranked in the top 40. Irish se­nior Will Forsyth, ranked 19th by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association, improved his record to 19-7 on the season

Chalk Talk 

Baseball swings at Howe offering and strikes out again 
In baseball, it's three strikes and you're out, right? 
Well, such is not the case for wonder­boy Steve Howe. This Spring, the talented lefty reliever returns from his seventh, yes SEVENTH, drug-related suspension. 
As a pitcher, Howe began showing signs of regaining the form he showed as a dominating closer for the Los Angeles Dodgers in the early eighties. He logged 22 innings in Yankee 
pinstripes last season, with  a  3-0  
record and a 2.45 ERA.  
Yet  as  a  human  being,  Howe  
continues to show about as  much  

control as Ray Charles would on the mound. 
Howe's attempted rehabilitation comeback ended abruptly last June, when he pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Missoula. Mont., to a misdemeanor charge of attempting to buy a gram of cocaine. (If you can find cocaine in Montana, you must be hooked.) 
Then-commissioner Fay Vincent promptly suspended Howe, a move intended to be a lifetime ban. Hooray for Fay, right? 
Not quite. When the league pulled the rug out from under their commish last fall. they apparently forgot about the integrity standards he tried to uphold within the game. 
On Nov. 12, arbitrator George Nicolau overturned Vincent's decision to ban !lowe after a grievance was filed by the players' union. 
The baseball world should be outraged that such a villian as Steve Howe should get a seventh chance, while one of the game's most faithful, Pete Hose, remains in exhile. 
To deny one man the Hall of Fame glory he deserves because he occasionally participates in the only existing sport (gambling) as old as the Bible-while embracing another man with an obvious narcodics fixation without remorse-is to deny justice itself. 
Major League Baseball is not operating on a double standard of on­field performance. for in that respect, Howe couldn't hold Hose's jock, as they say. 
Hather, the league is operating without standard. 
In such a critical social, racial and economic atmosphere, Major League Baseball must establish some authority to restore to the game such basic principles as "Three strikes, you're out." 
63rd Annual Bengal Bouts begin Sunday at JACC 

By GEORGE DOHRMANN Sports Writer 
The 63rd annual Bengal Bouts answer the bell this Sunday as 75 Notre Dame 
Holy Cross Missions in Bangladesh. The quarterfinal round is slated for a 2 
p.m. 
starting time in the Joyce ACC Arena. The semifinals will be held the following Wednesday in the JACC Fieldhouse. The finals are Friday at 8 

p.m. 
back in the main arena. 


Made famous by Dominic J. "Nappy" Napolitano, the director from 1931-1981, the Bouts boast the second largest stu­dent participation beyond the Bookstore Basketball tournament. Over $300,000 dollars have been raised since the in­augural bouts in the 1930's. 
The large number of boxers eclipse the group of 72 which laced up their gloves last year. The large turnout not only spells more funds for the Holy Cross Missions but also adds an additional

Irish lacrosse looks towards NCAA tournament 
By KEVIN MCGUIRE Sports Writer 
As the Notre Dame lacrosse team prepares for the 1993 season, fifth-year coach Kevin Corrigan is understandably ex­cited: "This is an extremely talented group that has a good mix of youth and experience." 
The Irish will need this com­bination of veterans and youth in order to surpass last year's 10-5 record, as they try to repeat their appearance in the NCAA tournament. The road, however, will not be an easy one because the team has put together the toughest schedule ever. 
Senior goalie Chris Parent believes the team is up to the challenge: "We play a really tough schedule that we will overcome because we are a deep team that is anchored by our defense."

Notre Dame tries to break slump at DePaul 
By JONATHAN JENSEN Sports Writer 

The Fighting Irish limp to Chicago this weekend to meet another slumping team in the DePaul Blue Demons, who had lost seven out of their last 11 before downing the UAB Blazers on Tuesday night. 
"Our confidence is at an all-time low," said DePaul coach Joey Meyer. 
The Blue Demons will get no sympathy from the Notre Dame though, as the Irish have lost six out of seven, falling to 24th-ranked Marquette 69-61 in their last outing on Wednesday night. 
Despite having only eight scholarship players available against Marquette, the Irish led for most of the contest before succumbing to the 
graduated all-time leading scorer Mike Sullivan and Brian Mayglothling, who is out for personal reasons. The Irish will look to junior attackers Randy Colley and Robbie Snyder as well as midfielders Ed Lamb and Will Sutton to lead the offense. 
"Colley will score his share of goals this year, but it will be a group effort, with the majority of the offense being generated by the middies," said Corrigan. 
The Irish know they will have to work together in order to get back to the level of play that took them to the NCAA's. 
"We will have to learn to deal with adversity by adapting to the situation and then conquering it. But I'm confident we have the players to do so," Corrigan said. 
The Irish have plenty of young talent, with the likes of freshman Rob Tobin and sophomore Marc Pasquale, expected to contribute 
. significantly. But the question remains as to whether they can . return to the form that garnered them the Midwest Region's bid to the NCAA tournament. The Irish can accomplish their goals, junior midfielder Billy Ahmuty believes, "We are a very athletic team and if we play smart and to our capabilities, we .. can go a long way." i;:;;.;;;:J.;:~".

Colin Hanley appears to be the gem of this group with only minimal resistance coming from the rest of the field. Mike Ahearn is a longshot with hope as well as Dan Schmidt. Schmidt was a semifinal loser a year ago. 
"This is a really strong division," said Schmidt. "All the boxers have a chance, but you have to consider Colin the fa­vorite."

In DePaul, the Irish face a team that may be even younger than they are, as the Blue Demons are led by sophomore Chicagoans Tom Kleinschmidt (18.3 PPG) and Brandon Cole (14. 7 PPG), and junior forward Kris Hill (9.4 PPG, team-leading 8.8 RPG). 
DePaul's senior leadership is provided by athletic guard Terry Davis, who has started every game for the Blue Demons and provides 
15.3 points per game. 

Senior Monty Williams, the Irish's leading scorer and rebounder, will look to rebound from a 10-point performance against the swarming defense of the Warriors by asserting himself Sunday at the Rosemont Horizon.
