Vietnam, China 
open talks 
BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -­Vietnam's peace ne~otiations with China opened m Hanoi yesterday with a Vietnamese proposal that a demilitarized zone be established on its border with China, according to Asian new agency reports re­ceived in Bangkok. 
It was the first day of talks between the two Communist neighbors, who fought a border war in February. 
Vietnamese negotiator Vice Foreign Minister Phan Hien said Chinese troops still occu­pied more than ten areas in Vietnamese territory. He said the Chinese were continuing to strengthen their forces along the border and that the situa­tion was "very tense." 
He proposed that both armies withdraw two to three miles from the border recognized before the Chinese invasion Feb. 17, and that prisoners of war be exchanged soon, accor­

$117millionpledged 

Catnpaign enters finalphase 
by Mike Shields . News Editor 
The Campaign for Notre Dame, a program to make Notre Dame "the greatest Catholic university of all time,'' is within ten percent of its goal of $130 million in endowments, University President Fr. Theo­dore Hesburgh announced at a press conference yesterday. 
The national fund-ratsing drive, which began less than two years ago, has already obtained $117 million in gifts and commitments to the Uni­versity, but Hesburgh said he hoped to surpass the tar~et by "several million dollars.' 
Yesterday's press conference marked the opening of the campaign's thtrd and final phase, that of contacting over 80,000 alumni, parents and friends. Phase III has a target of $15 million, Hesburgh said. 
The first phase involved flyin~ prospective donors to the Uiu­verslty to seek support. Phase II involved a series of over 140 luncheons and dinners. 
Hesburgh noted that Notre Dame is currently twenty-third in the nation in endowments. The current campai~n will "ca­tapult Notre Dame mto the top ten or 15 universities in the land," he added. 
"Show me the ten universities with the largest endownments, and I will show you the ten finest institutions of higher learning in the United States," Hesburgh claimed.

Reid considers record store after new proposal submitted 
by Kathleen Connelly Senior Copy Editor 
Director of Student Activities John Reid said last night that he will make a decision on the latest Record Store proposed by the Board of Commissioners either today or tomorrow. 
Reid cited security, inventory control and continuity in administration from year to year as being his major concerns with the pro{>osal.
The onginal record store proposal, submitted almost a year ago, was rejected on the basis of these reservations by Fr. John Van Wolvlear, vice-president for Student Affairs. 
In t~is latest propos~!, ho~ever, the drafters of the proposal haye elimmated the posstble mventory, management and secunty problems foreseen by Van Wolvlear by subsituting a plan for a store that would operate on an order basis rather than maintaining a substantial connnuous inventory.
In justifying his rejeaction of the original proposal, Van Wolvlear ex_pressed concern over the possibility that a future Student union mtght be unwilling to adminster the record store. 
Under the provis10ns of the/roposal, the Student Union Services 
"The concern that Fr. Van Wolvlear has expressed in the past are

store  would  operate  from  the  Ticket  Office,  with  no  other  
permanent facilities.  

my concerns," Reid said. "I agree with what he said on the first proposal," he added. 
''The beauty of this proposal is that it deals with the reservations that the admmistration nad on the frrst proposal,'' Student Union Director Tom Hamel observed. 
The current record store proposal has evolved in response to administrative criticism dunng the past year.fLast May, Roche, then newly appointed Student Union director submitted the original proJ:?osal for ·a large inventory store. 
The first prOJ:?<?Sal was arafted by Roche and Curt Hench who was Executive Staff coordinator for the Student Union at the time. At present, Hench is Services Commissioner. 
The first proposal was submitted to Bro. Just Paczne~y, former vice-president for Sudent Affairs. When Paczseny restgned, the responsibility for the decision was transferred to his successor, Van Wolvlear. 
Van Wolvlear turned down the proposal in November of last xear, stating that he did not believe there would be sufficient demand for a full-time record store. He also expressed concern that the store would not be feasible from an administrative standpoint, especially in the areas of inventory control, security and continuity. 
''A lot-of people were disappointed when it was turned down,'' Roche said. ''Student reaction to the idea of a low cost record store

While she is sure that she does not want to take a job that she considers "demeanin_g," that is the only thing she is sure of. Barb is scared and confused about her future.

The Saint Mary's delegation consisted of seniors Merce Webber, Ann Sofranco, Ann Bathon and Megan Phillips, and juniors Mary Beth Bonte, Donna Hancock and Denise Streff.

Daily committee sessions were held from 9 a.m.-11 a.m. During designated intervals, the students arbitrated over the proposed resolutions which often resulted in intense delib­eration. 
Highlights for the Saint Mary's delegation included a briefing session with the Third Secretary of Tanzania at the Tanzania Mission. According to Phillips, the Briefing "pro­vided an excellent opportunity to learn of the up-to-date Tanzania policies." She added that it proved to be advan­tageous when they approached the Ugandan delegation. 
The group members agreed that, by participating in the conference, they became aware of the political struggles of

The disparity between the expectations of undergraduates and the experience of graduates in the job market is understandable, given the current emphasis on "technical" expertise and specilization in today' s job market.

Why are opportunities available to Englishmajors, for example in seemingly unrefated fields? According to Willemin, die answer lies in the liberal arts students' broad base of ­understanding. "It allows a student much more flexibilicy to go into different areas. Students with lioeral arts degrees are much more circumspect, more facile, with a high degree of ability in reading and writing. That makes them desirable· to employers looking for those

'Free Lebanon' 
Haddad declares 'self-rule' 
TYRE, Lebanon (AP) · The Israele-backed Christian military in southern Lebanon yesterday delcared itself under "self-rule" ,l!ld proclatmed a new "Free l.pb:non" state, the Israeli radio sall1 The declarat­ioncame hours <>. .er the Christ­ians shelled a Lebanese army unit as it jouned U.N. peace­keepers in the area. 
''Our intention wilt be to liberate all Lebanon from all the invaders and all who are for­eigners and who have bad intentions against Lebanon," said a militia leader, Maj. Sadd Haddad. 
The Christian milita contends the Lebanese forces are heavily influenced by Syria, seen by the Christians as rivals for control of Lebanon. The Israelis and Christians share the view that a Lebanese army aided by Syria will allow Palestinian ~uerrilla infiltration of the Israelt border and heighten tension in the area. 
Israeli radio said Haddad announced the birth of "Free Lebanon" at a news conference in the northern Israeli town of Metulla. 
Lebanon's state radio called Haddad's statement "Israeli­inspired secession.'' Pierre Genayel, leader of the rightest Christian Phalange Party, also condemned the declaration, saying "enough of states within a state." 
There was no immediate response from Israeli officials to Haddad's declaration. Diplomatic sources reported the United States had asked Israel to be a moderating influence on its Christian allies and allow the Lebanese army deployment in the area or proceed. 
Haddad's artillary shelled the 560-man Lebanese contin­gent as it moved into the village of Dirdghayya, the battalion headquarters about seven miles east of Tyre. Two Lebanese soldiers and a civilian were reported wounded. 
Haddad commands a force of about I, 500 rightist Christian soldiers who were given control of a six-mile-wide strip of Lebanon's 59-mile border with Israel when the Israelis with­drew from the south after they moved against Palestinian ~uerr.illas in a March, 1978, mvaston. 
Samir Sambar, a U.N. 
spokesman in Beirut, said two civilians were killed by Haddad's shelling of Irish U.N. troops and that the Norwegian and Nigerian troops also were being pounded by Haddad's guns. A report from Tel Aviv said one Norwegian U.N. soldier was killed and another wounded in the shelling. 
Residents of the rolltng hills of southern Lebanon and northern Israel have suffered from battles between warring factions since the civil war tore Lebanon apart in 1975 and 1976, Their homes and property have been heavily damaged by small arms and artillery fire. 
The Lebanese battalion has greeted by singing and dancing crowds of Lebanese villagers as it moved south early yesterday. Lebanese Prime Minister Dalim EI-Hoss and other Lebanese officials are trying to heal the wounds of the civil was between rightist Christians and 
Palestinians  and  their  leftist  
allies.  
The  war  was  halted  by  a  

Syrian force of 30,000 soldiers that still occupies areas north of the Litani River, just north of Tyre.

The glut of careers open to lib.eral ~s majo~s essentially fall into two related mdustnes--busi­ness and communications. According to the BLS the fields of advertising, purchasing a~d man~gement or administratt<:?n are the m~Jor areas of business open to any hberal arts maJor. Their statistics show that the rate of employment in those fields will grow as fast as the. average, relative to other fiefds, through the mid·l980s. All three areas rely, in large/art, on people who are sensitive to trends an ideas tbat thr~ad their way through the foJ::lulace and, accordm~ to the "Occupationa Outlook Handbook, technical aspects of the field can be learned "on 
the job." . .
The communications field iS expect.ed to expand greatly through 1985. Accordiqg to analysts, the inc::reased flov.: and complexicy of ideas are bringmg on ap. mcreased need for people who can anaiY.ze, 10terpr«::t, process and communicate those ideas, parucufarly to the business community as well as the rest of society. In public relations, person~el and l~bor relations IiberaJ arts maJors wdl be h1red "faster than the average" through 1985. People filling these positions can expect to start at salaries between $10,000 to $16,000, even in the low level positions. The employment _growth ?f writers ofall types in the business industry wtll increase as fast as the average, accordmg to statistics. Writers can expect to make between $10 000 and $20",000 a year, UP. to $25,000 and

Record flood~ displacesthousands of 1ssissippians 
(AP) --Thousands of Missis­sippians downstream from their stunned capital city of Jackson packed bags and fled yesterday to escape record floodmg of the Pearl River that already has cost half a billion dollars and displaced more than 17,000 people. 
In neighboring Alabama, hun­dreds more joined the 5,000 families in the Black Belt region who have abandoned their homes to rising water. Officials warned of the added peril of snakes and alligators driven from their river lairs. 
While the Deep South bore the brunt of this week's floods, which have been blamed for at least five death, the 2,000 residents of the northwestern Minnesota town of -Warren awoke to find streets inundated by the overflowing Snake River which runs through the center

Mary lrby and her ten children of Selma, AL, a city of about 28,000 on the Alabama River, were among hundreds plucked from the floods by boat. 
''This man came up in a boat to try to get us out to feed the hogs," she said. "But the hogs had all come up on our front porch. That's when I knew it was time to leave." 
The water was inching down in Jackson, but it still lapped 2~ the rooftops of some houses and officials warned of record high water advancing on communi­ties to the south. · ) ackson Mayor Dale Danks warned residents to stay out of flooded neighborhoods because of hidden dangers, including snakes and weakened roads and bridges. 
"We now face added prob­lems by the receding water, which we consider just as critcal 
as when the river was rising," 
he said. 
Record crests were expected downriver at Geoq~etown, Monticello and C.olumbta where more than 2.000 residents al­ready have been evacuated. 
Sandbagging was going on around the clock in Columbia, a town of 8,000 about 80 miles south of Jackson, and many residents were packing their belongings and heading for higher ground. 
''The river is nearing 22 feet and it_ is forecast to reach 28 feet later this week,'' said Jim Thornhill, Marion County Civil Defense director in Columbia. "The crest will reach 2,000 people and if the river climbs even a foot above that level, we're talking about 5,000 evac­uations." 
In Georgetown, about 40 miles downriver, Mayor Beal Allbrit­ton said 80 percent ofhis town's 420 residents had moved out. ''All we can do not is hope we can ride this thing out,'' he said. 
In Monticello, located between Georgetown and Columbia, even more people were evacu­ated as the river rose at the rate of two feet a day, expected to go 
34.5 feet above flood stage on Saturday. 
The Pearl dropped to 42.5 feet in jackson after cresting at 43.2 feet on Tuesday, more than 25 feet above flood stage. _ 
Police and National Guards­men continued to patrol the flooded downtown area, permit­ting only authorized people and convoys of dump trucks with sandbagging -dirt fast road­blocks. 
The Mississippi flood yester­day forced Amtrack to cut off its Chicago to New Orleans pas­senger trains at Memphis, using buses for the ride around submerged tracks. 
Civil Defense officials said 500 other families in the path of flood crests surging into west­central Alabama were evacu­ated yesterday in the Selma area. At Demopolis, a city of 8,000 on the Tombigbee River, officials said 600 families had left their homes. 
George Srarks, deputy direc­tor of Civi Defense in Selma, warned that snakes driven from the rivers often seek dry shelter in abandoned homes. 
''We also have alligators down here," he said. "The flood waters sometimes wash them up out of the river and they sometimes end up near some of the homes. ·

WASHINGTON--The most pressing question Washington faces today is.. whether we will get the Gilbert Stuart portraits of George and Martha Wash­ington. For those who have not been following the controversy, the Smithsonian Institution bousht the paintings for $5 milhon from Boston's impover­ished Athenaeum Library to hang in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington. 
Suddenly Bostonians are up in arms. The idea of losing the paintin~s caused all the politi­cians 1n Massachusetts to scream that Washington was stealing their state's heritage. Mayor White said that every­one knows Washington has no culture and the sale could only be compared to the Mona Lisa being sold to the Arabs. 
My answer to White is, "Baked beans." If any city is lacking in culture it's Boston. It doesn't have a first-class uni­versity, a decent symphony orchestra or an accredited mu­seum. Bostonians can't tell the difference between Rembrandt and a hockey puck. 
I go to Boston a lot and I have many friends there But not once has anyone ever said to me, "Would you like to see the Gilbert Stuart portraits of George and Martha Washing­ton?" 

Depending on the season, my host will say, "Would you care to see a Red Sox game?'' or "How about going over to watch the Celtics play basket­ball?" 
I believe it's silly for Ameri­cans to argue which city has more culture. I think the decision as to where the por­traits should hang must be left to the wishes of the people of involved. 
I am fortunate to have in my possession a tape made during the sitting for the portraits. 
The tape was given to me by the Smithsonian and they have authenticated that the voices are those of George, Martha, and Gilbert Stuart. 
Here is a partial transcript: 
WASHINGTON: Gil, what do you intend to do with these portraits? 
STUART: It is my dream, Mr. President, that some day they will hang in the national Por­trait Gallery in the nation's capital. 
WASHINGTON: I'd like that, wouldn't you, Martha? . MARTHA: What other chot­ces do we have? 
STUART: Well, I heard from an art dealer that Boston would like them. 
MARTHA: You mean the home of that dreadful Yankee, John Adams? 
STUART: That's the way I felt about it, Ma'am. They have no appreciation of art. Just the other day I heard Paul Revere say, "If you've seen, one por­trait, you've seen them all." 
MARTHA: George, I've never asked anything of you before. But you have to promise me that I'll never hang in Boston. -WASHINGTON: (laughing) Martha, you worry too much. The Bostonians are too cheap to buy a Gilbert Stuart paintmg, much less a pair. 
MARTHA: Nevertheless, you must promise. 
WASHINGTON: All right, Martha, I promise. Gilbert, you're a witness. I never want our portraits to hang in a city that throws Coca-Cola bottles at opposing baseball teams. 
STUART: I couldn't agree with you more. I'd rather have my work hanging in Cleveland. That was the end of the tape, hut I believe it speaks for itself.

To ask or not to ask, that is the question! Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to take offense against the rejections and refusals cast forth by a sea of ND women. 
The formal season is upon us! Male hearts jump! Excitement, apprehen­sion, anticipation and fear fill the air. Who do I ask? Why do I ask? How do I ask? Shattered egos, untested cour­age, daydreams never realized, hopes unfulfilled are but a few of the characteristics of this jolly time. 
These thoughts and questions plague the male mmd in endless hauntmg exercise. 
Their answer is always the same. "What the hell," says he, "ask anyone, but at least ask!'' We all know the hardest pan is in the asking. We also know that the chances are she' II say yes, but convincing our timid egos is another story. 
"Well, even if I decide to try, who do I ask?" Try the ·girl who always comes to mind while you rest in bed, staring at the wire mesh forming the under­pinning of your roommate's bunk. You know--the one that just happens to sit 27 rows behind you in your 600 person basic Intro to Economics class. 
"Oh her," exclaims the ego, "she'll never say yes.'' ''Give it a shot,'' yells the id, "I haven't had a woman in six months!" 
"Why do I ask?" A formal gives you the perfect excuse. No strings attached! The girl doesn't feel threatened by your desire for a relationship. You just want to go and have a good time. Formals are to college what apple pie and Moms are to America. But we know better, don't we guys? If she agrees and if we play our cards right, we might have the beginnings of something we always wanted: a sexual life at Notre Dam<:. 
We got the who and we got the why, now the how! The best strategy calls for a non-committal approach. How can I pop the question m such ~ way that ifl am rejected, it won't seem that way. Conversational example; 
Boy; Yea, the idea of Boing to my formal has crossed my mmd. _But, I'd like to go with someone I could have a good time with and not feel the pressure of a forced relationship. Someone very similar to yourself would be nice. · 
Girl, (Here's the crucial response! Unless she's totall) ignorant, the hint will be re<  i" ·J and the proper informativ(-reply will be given. A reply, which done with :t little tact, will give you an answer without direct rejewon.) Why, thank you! 
But, euough of theories. The time has come! She approaches on the 
Mike Cervini 
opposite path. It's now or never! Heart pounds, pulse races, mind swirls, one deep breath--here we go! Wait! The super ego has fainted! Id and ego work fevenshly to resuscitate their counterpart. She's here! He's bif:k! Thank God! 
"Hi Mary Lou." "Hi Mark." "How are you?" "Fine." You silently curse yourself for such a stupid opening line, 
while  praying  the  rest  will  go  per­ 
fectly.  You finally ask.  She agrees.  
You'll  call  her?  She  says  O.K.  

Good byes are exchanged and you· re off! The path ahead seems shorter and a tree you never noticed before comes into view. 
Oh, che trials and tribulations of the NO man! God, the women have it easy! And they don't even realize what we go through for them. Please, help us out! Flaunt your availability!

Religious television 
Paid programs dominate 
NEW YORK (AP) --Paid religious television shows by indtvidual performers are dn­ving public-service programs backed by the nation's major faith off the air, a new study finds. It says the shift has "narrowed" the output. 
The situation, surmised in the industry for some time, was statistically documented in a study of broadcast patterns over the last 20 years on a cross-section of the country's TV outlets.. 
The trend "has considerably narrowed the sources and con­tent of religious programming'' in America, says the jomt report by Protestant, Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox representatives. 
It was submitted to the Fed­
eral Communications Commis­
sion, appealing for restoration 
of its former policy of crediting 
stations in seeking license· re­
newals for carrymg unpaid, 
sustaining programs. 
Blaming abandonment of that 
policy in 1960 for the "marked 
reduction in the diversity of 
program service," the report 
cites the sharp rise in commer­
cial shows and steep decline in 
those representing the main 
religious bodies of U.S. com­
munities. 
The study found that paid 
religious TV broadcasts have climbed from about half the total in 1959 to 92 percent now, while public-service religious prog­rams have fallen from about 
half to just 8 percent. 
''The paid programs are dis­
tinctly different from the sus­
taining programs they have replaced both in content and source,'' the report says, noting that none of the paid shows represent mainline Protestant, Jewish or Catholic organiza­tions. 
''Without sustaining pro· grams, television cannot pre· sent a balanced representation of the major faiths that move the American people." 
The re_{lort was prepared by commumcations offices of the 
U.S. Catholic Conference, the National Council of Churches, made up of Protestant and Orthodox denominations, and the United Church of Christ. 
For example, the report cites CBS's dropping in ] anuary of the two most honored. high quality religious shows on net­work television, "Look Up and Live" and "Lamp Unto My Feet.'' 
They had been on the air for a quarter century, prepared in cooperation with major reli­gious bodies and formerly wide­ly used on network affiliates. But their usage had fallen sharply recently, replaced by paid religious shows and finally driven out of existence. 
However, in the face of wide­spread distress in church cir­cles, CBS since has decided to initiate a new sustaining-time religion program on Sunday morning, "For Our Time," beginning April 29, dealing with ethics and faith. 
"It's a second chance, and the churches have promised to get behind it and give it a little more support," said Pamela Ilott, CBS vice president and executive producer for religious and cultural affairs programs.

Congressional team opens  
hearing on alleged fallout  


SALT LAKE CITY (AP) ­Nearly two decades after the last open-air nuclear test in Nevada, a congressional team begins an investigation today into claims that radioactive fallout caused cancer in people living downwind in Utah, Arizonia and Nevada. 
If an informal hearing earlier in southern Utah is any indicat­ion, the committtee can expect testimony from angry people who either have cancer or lost relatives and friends to the disease. 
Irene Allen told of losing two husbands to cancer. Ilene Prosstgaard, whose father died of cancer last year, said, "I wish someone had some answer'' 
"A crime has been committed in our state," said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Ut, who sponsored

the town meeting Tuesday night and vowed to seek special legislation awarding compen­sation to bomb test victims. 
Today's hearing was sparked by millions of dollars in claims from 550 persons, mostly Utah residents. 
It has not been proven that fallout from the test caused cancer in anyone. More than 4,000 sheep died after one series in 1953, but the Army denied fallout killed them. 
The congressional panel, whose cochairmen are Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-MA, and Rep. Bob Eckhardt, D-TX, will try to determine whether fallout 
caused the cancers and whether the government must make amends. 
The congressional panel also will explore allegations that the Atomic Energy Commission, the DDE's predecessor, covered up evidence of higher-1 than-normal levels ofplutonium in Utah soil from atomic tests. 
Dr. Joseph Lyon, Co-director of the Utah Cancer Registry, said he will testify that leu­kemia deaths amongh children in southern U tab were 2. 5 times higher during the blasts than before or after. 
Pro-Aminforces cause violence in Uganda 
KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -­Troops still loyal to Idi Amin are 1reported killing officials in eas-­tern Uganda believed sympa­thetic to the new government in ! Kampala. 
With the invasion force of Tanzanian troops and Ugandan exiles still preparing to extend the new government's authority to northern and eastern Uganda, the deposed presi­dent's forces were reported on a murderous rampage in the eastern city of Tororo, near the Kenyan border. 
It was believed that pro-Amin Moslems were also killing members of Christian tribes in the area in retaliation for Chris­tian murders of Moslems after the fall of Kampala to the invaders last weekend. That outbreak of killings was in retaliation for massacres of the Christians by Amin's Moslem 
supporters  during  his  eight  
years in power.  
The  whereabouts  of  Amin  

remained a mystery. Various reports, none conflrmed, put him in Libya, Sudan, Iraq, Zaire or still inside Uganda, possibly in the northwestern corner of the country where he was born. Meanwhile, Tanzanian com­mandos made a dash of some 50 miles to the east of Kampala to secure the Owen Falls dam and power plant on the Nile River. The plant produces all of Ugan­da's electricity and 15 percent of the power used in Kenya, and there had been fears that Amin's men would blow it up.

Gymnasts establish themselves in Midwest 
byBnan McLaughlin 
This Notre Dame Gymnastics Team established itself as a growing gymnastics power by defeating Purdue and Indiana in the first annual Golden Grips Classic. Notre Dame outscored host Purdue 185.81 to 154.87, 
with  the  women's  team  
accounting  for  34.03  of  that  
diference.  The IU  women did  

well to come within two points of the ND women, but since IU had no men's team, they were defeated by 10l. SO points in the team tally. 
To negate the advantage the Irish had in depth and numbers over the smaller Purdue and Indiana squads, only the· top three scores for each team in each event were counted in the team totals. Looking at the total team scores, the Irish men outscored the Boilermakers by 12 points while the Irish women outscored the Purdue women by 46.68 and Indiana by 15.58. 
The men's competition began with vaulting. Entered in this event were Dave Petrillo, Dan Howley, Bob Meehan, and· Brian McLaughlin, and took third through sixth place respectively. 
The second event, pommel horse, proved to be the stron~­est event for the Irish. Louts DeLeon took first place in the event with a fine performance. Immediately following DeLeon were Petrillo in second and Meehan in third. Also placing well was McLaughlin in sixth place. 
McLaughlin went first on floor exercise, but his score didn't count because he had to perform an exhibition. McLaughlin scored what would have been fifth place. As it stands, however, Steve Reifenberg took third place,. Howley took forth, Petrillo took fifth and Meehan, sixth. Meehan showed a supreme act of courage as he badly injured his ankle on his opemng pass, but continued his routine with­out favorin~ his injured ankle. 
John Paultk was the highlight of the rings, performing .many strength moves including an impressive "Iron Cross": He was awarded third place. Joe Skovira and Brian McLaughlin, also performing well, took fifth and sixth places respective!} , while Meehan was able to place seventh despite a stumble on his dismount due to his ankle. 
Joe Skovira gave an excellent performance on parallel bars to

routine that included a front flip 
between the bars and a back 
flip dismount. Meehan and 
Howley received fourth and 
fifth places respectively. 
Notre Dame finishec}strongly 
on High Bar, with McLaughlin 
taking second place and Howley 
taking fourth. Both dismounted 
with back flyaways. Meehan 
also did well, taking sixth place. 
In the all-around results, Bob 
Meehan was able to overcome 
his pain enough to finish 
second. Howley, Petrillo, and 
McLuaghlin finished fourth, 
fifth, and sixth respectively, 
although if McLaughlin's floor 
routine had counted, he would 
have finished fourth. 
The women were competing at the same time as the men and doing even better. The first event for the women was floor exercise. Competing in this event were Jody DiDonato, Tracy Keating, and, from St. Mary's Roberta DePiero. DePeiro started the meet off well by taking second in this event. Keating was forced to improvise the end of her routing, but did well and finish­ed sixth. 
Entered in vaulting were 
Butzer, DePiero, DiDonato, 
Keating and Larkin. A~ain the 
Irish gave a good showtng with 
DePetro in third place, Keating 
in fourth, and DeDonato in 
seventh.

spirit has really been inspirat­ional." 
Pullano has not missed a start since he was inserted in the lineup early in the spring of his freshman year. His average has improved annually, batting .329, .340 and .356 in three full campaigns. He'll really have to go on a tear, against tough competition, to ratse that mark again this season. But, if there are any doubters out there, I'll give you even money that Rick does it again. For he's managed to set himself apart from the crowd with a special mixture ofclass, determination, and pride in a job well done.

Jamieson came home to score 
on an error by the Butler 
shortstop. 
Pullano and Jamieson strung together singles again in the fourth, and once again a miscue by .the Butler shortstop cost the VISitors a run. 
Three Butler runs in the second inning of the finale forced the Irish to play catch-up ball. Notre Dame was trying to even its record at 10-10, but mana~ed just four hits while droppmg the 7-2 decision. 
The Irish entertained the University of Detroit over the weekend, and it was more of the same. This time, the Irish dropped the opener 6-1 before coming back for a night­cap 8-6. 
Mike Bobinski was handed his first loss of the campaign. Bobinski yielded five runs in six innings, but only two were earned, thanks to five Notre Dame errors. The Irish managed but three hits. 
Notre Dame scored three in the fourth, five in the fifth, and added a pair in the sixth to come from behind to beat the Titans 8-6 in the second game. Henry Valenzuela went 3-for-4 for the Irish, driving in three runs. Sophomore Jim Montagano belted a solo home­run. 
Mike Kenahan was the win­ner in relief. The senior righthander turned in four and two-third innings, allowing just one earned run. Vuono sealed the victory by retiring the final two hitters. 
Mike Deasey posted his fourth victory in as many dec­isions when he went six innings in Notre Dame's 16-3 win over Northwood Institute. The rout avenged Notre Dame's 7-4 loss in the first game. 
The Irish scored seven times in the fourth, and coasted the rest of the way. Rick Pullano, Dave Barrish and Mark Simendinger each stroked three hits for Notre Dame, and Dan Voellinger went 2-for-3.

Irish ruggers reach quarterfinals in St. Louis Ruggerfest tourney 
by Rich Harper and Kevin Connor 

Another chapter was added to 
the Irish ruggers' success story 
this past weekend, as the "A" 
team advanced to the quarter­
finals of the highly esteemed 
St. Louis Ruggerfest. 
The ruggers stamina was 
tested, as they were called upon 
to play three games ~~ the 
opening day of competition. 
They were victorious in the first 
two but suffered a tough loss in 
the 'third, dropp!ng them from 
further competition. 
In the first round of play, the 
Irish breezed to an easy shutout 
over the local St. Louis Univer­
sity rugby club. Action w~s 
highlighted by trys fr~m Kevtn 
Corcoran · Bnan Hamgan, and · 
freshman' Brian Tucker. An 
extra point was added by Mike Allair. 
A mere hour and a half after 
the close of the first game, the Irish donned their spikes again ' to take on a highly touted Black Sheep rugby club. The game was a grudge match for Notre Dame who suffered a defeat to the s~me team in their last meeting a year ago. The Bl~ck Sheep JUmped off to a qu1ck 
lead, 4-0, in the first half. 
The Irish regained their com­
posure in the second half, led 
by a hard-running and hard-hit­
ting Mike McGlynn. An alert 
Rich Harper picked up a Black 
Sheep kick and scampered ten 
yards for a score, evening the 
match at 4-4. Dave Gamache 
put the Irish into the quarter· 
finals as he galloped his way 
into the BlacK Sheep endzone, 
giving the Irish an 8-4 victory. 
The stress of a full day of 
competition began to take its toll as Notre Dame took on the No;seman rugby club in . the third game without the serv1ces of an injured Dave Gamache. Jim Bowers, normally a scrummie, was called upon .to fill Gamache's shoes, whtle 
John Poinsatte took over Bow­ers' place in the serum. The Irish were the obvious agressors, continually pressing die Norsemen in both halves, but were unable to put a score on the board. The Norsemen scored once in each half to take a 8-0 win, eliminating :r:-r?tre Dame from further competmon. Meanwhile, in Chicago, otht;r Irish ruggers to.ok on t~e Um­versity of Ch1cago m two games. The Irish were hurt early in the first game as Peter 
Paganelli was ejected tor over­
zealous play. The pace of the 
game was slowed by many 
penalties on both teams. The 
fine play ofJohn Muldoon w<l:s 
overshadowed by a 11·0 Chi­
cago win. 
The Irish turned the tables in 
the second contest, trouncing the Maroons 18·0. Th~ ga'!le was highlighted by senwr K1m Uniacke's fine running and by the efforts of rookies Mike Marshall and Kin Zubler. One · trv was recorded by both U.ni­acke and Marshall, while Zub­
ler added two.

Irish nine split another twinbill 
by Craig Chva/ Sports Writer 

Trying to figure Notre Dame's baseball team depends a great deal on your pomt-of­view. If you're the type that sees half-full glasses of water, the Irish are on the verge of putting it all together. But if you notice the empty half, well, the Irish seem to be going nowhere fast. 
Tuesday afternoon, Coach Tom Kelly's men split a double­header with Butler University. The Irish took game one 4-3, behind the c'ombined pitching efforts of Greg Kot and Marty Vuono. The nightcap was all Butler, however, as the visitors from Indianapolis won 7-2. The split marked the fourth time in five twin-bills that the Irish broke even, and it left them with a 9-11 slate. 
Kot, a freshman from Fair­fax, Virginia entered the con­test with an 0-2 mark, but was working on a 4-0 shutout into the fifth inning. A walk and three singles halved Notre Dame's lead and after a two-out double and an error, Kelly summoned Vuono from the bullpen. 
The sophomore righthander yielded a run-scoring single, but then put out the fire without further incident. Vuono then set down the side in order in the seventh to earn his first save of 1979. 
Singles by shortstop Rick Pullano in the second and fourth innings keyed Notre Dame uprisings. In the second, Pullano singled with two out to send Mark Simendinger to third he then stole second base, setting the stage for Mike Jamieson's two-run single.

Butchers, Chumps highlight today's bookstore games 
by Frank LaGrotta Sports Writer 

Notre Dame's Bookstore Bas­ketball tournament kicks into high gear this afternoon with four feature games on tap. The tournament's number one seed, Butchers, featuring Bruce Flo. wers, Dave Huffman and Kevin Hart, will play on Bookstore 10 at 6:30. Right next door on Bookstore 9, Tom Sudkamp and Rusty Lisch will lead Chumps into action as they attempt to return to the tournament's final game where they lost last year toJeffCarpenter's squad. That game is also scheduled for 6:30 p.m. 
Two late games tipping off behind Stepan Center feature Strappamasquon and His Com­bat Wombats, with Greg Kna­felc and Pete Holohan (Stepan 5 at 5:30) and the perennially powerful Nutmeggers (Stepan 3 at 6:30). 
The tournament proceeded without incident yesterday as 32 teams advanced to the next round of play. In an overtime marathon, Captain Necrophelia and the L.M. 's outlasted Ivory Magicll, 25-23. Jerry Maloney was 12-for-28 for the winners with teammate Dave Onus­check chipping in nine. Chris Sullivan and Mike Moore had seven and six points respec­tively for the losers. 
Balanced scoring was the key as the Irish Wildcats dumped Paul Bauersfield and the Un­known Assailants, 21-7. Gary Thompson, Kevin Dochney, Rich Buehner and Kent Brock­elman all scored five points for the 'Cats.
