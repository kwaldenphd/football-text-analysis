Flag football touches the heart of ND tradition 
It's a cold evening, but the crowd doesn't notice. 
Standing on their feet, they anticipate a big play. The opponents have fourth down, and drop into punt formation. 
The kick is deep, and it is caught on the 28 yard line. A few moves and fakes later, it's in the end zone. 
A 72-yard punt return for a touchdown. The crowd goes wild. The team mobs their punt returner, cheering as loudly as they can. 
I tell you, if Tim Brown had been there, he would have cheered when Tammy Goodwin returned that punt for Farley's Finest. I mean, that girl has moves that would have left Mic­higan State's defense sitting on their collective behinds. 
Heck, she might even be good enough to fake out Walsh's defense. 
I am a flag football maniac. I turned down an opportunity to type Security Beat every Sun­day, Tuesday, and Thursday just because it con­flicted with my flag football schedule. 
I even dropped one of my MWF classes so that I'd have less to study at halftime. 
I have to admit that there is a reason why I am such a flag football nut. You see, my girlfriend is one of Farley's defensive end. 
Sure, she's not as big as William Perry or as mean as Eric Dorsey, but when she comes flying down that field, you had better watch your flags. 
In that game that Tammy outran Tim Brown's longest return of the day before, my girlfriend had two sacks, and she stopped a run for a loss. 
If you have never witnessed a flag football game at Notre Dame or Saint Mary's, you really ought to go to one. These are ordinary girls, the ones with curtains in their windows, match­ing bed covers, secret ice cream cravings, and the rare ability to scope during all 21 meals on the meal plan. 
But, heavens, they play football which would make Knute himself smile. From the very beginning of the school year, flag football is a hot topic : 
"Can Farley repeat without Marilu?" 
"How good will Lyons be?" 
"Will Howard's team be better than they were last year?" 
Questions, discussions, boasts. It doesn't stop. Practice every afternoon. Drills, drills, drills. Rumor has it that Pasquerilla West tried to recruit linebackers from Lewis by offering cars and SYR dates. I think the NCAA is investigat­ing. 


Now, I don't want people to think that I am belittling flag football. It does wonders for hall spirit. 
Most importantly, it carries on a tradition at a school that absolutely loves football. We watch the Irish on Saturday, the guys dorms on Sunday afternoons, and the women on the astroturf of Cartier field on Saturday. 
In Howard, flag football may build a sense of dorm spirit before anything else does. For example, Howard doesn't have a hall president yet, but they have a quarterback. 
After the first round of games, perennial powers P.E., Farley, Lyons, and B.P. were 1-0. P.W., Lewis, Howard, and Walsh all stand at 0-1. Badin opens their season tonight. 
Flag football is probably the most intense inter-hall sport on campus. 
But more importantly, it is fun. I always kid my girlfriend that she won't have fun if Farley doesn't win it all again, but she knows she will. 
But as she says, it will be a lot more fun if they win. Intense, but fun. That's Notre Dame flag football for you. 
Well, I've got to go. I've got to take a nap so that I can watch flag football tonight. Or did they go on strike? Who knows, maybe the Irish Guard will show up. 
Regardless, Go Farley.

Hahn testifies before 


Associated Press 
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -A "drained and tired" Jessica Hahn testified Monday before a federal grand jury probing the PTL ministry, answering questions about her sexual liaison with Jim Bakker and the subsequent payoff that led to the TV evangelist's downfall. 
"I'm just really drained and tired," she said during a lunch break. "I want it all to be over. I also want to cooperate." 
She said she "will do whatever needs to be done" as the probe proceeds. 
She added that she was "just trying to be as truthful as I can be" in her testimony about a 1980 tryst with Bakker and sub­
sequent  payments  she  
received.

WASHINGTON -Sen. Joe Biden claimed during a cam­paign appearance in New Hampshire last spring that he finished in the top half of his law school class, although records indicate he finished near the bottom. 
In a videotape aired by the public service cable network C­SPAN several months ago, the Delaware Democrat was asked at a campaign stop in Claremont, N.H., on April 3 about what law school he atten­ded and how well he did. 
On the videotape, a clearly angered Biden told the ques­tioner: ''I think I probably have a much higher IQ than you do.

"The first year in law school, I decided I didn't want to be in law school and ended up in the bottom two-thirds of my class, and then decided I wanted to stay and went back to law school and in fact ended up in the top half of my class," he went on. 
But last week Biden released his law school records showing he had graduated 76th in a law school class of 85. The law school transcript also showed he made little progress in class standing through the three­year course, ranking 80 out of 100 in the first semester of the first year, and 79th out of 87 the second semester of his second year. 
Biden has been deviled about questions in the last 10 day . about his law school career and his use of others' words in his speeches without credit. He revealed last week that he com­mitted plagiarism in law school and took a course over to make up for the error. 
In the videotape, Biden went on to say, "I went to (Syracuse) law school on a full academic scholarship." 
The records he released last week indicated he had a $800 scholarship from the school out of a total tuition of $1,620 as well as $1,000 in room and board from his work as a residence adviser in a dorm and student loans.

incident with Hahn was dis­closed. 
Hahn said she agreed in 1980 to accept $265,000 for her silence, but broke the agree­ment after Bakker mentioned the encounter and the pay­ments stopped. 
Hahn's lawyer, Dominic Bar­bara, said his client received $20,300 before payments stopped. 
Hahn said she posed for semi­nude pictures in Playboy and submitted to an interview with the magazine "to finally tell my side of the story." 
The interview and pictures are due out this week. 
Asked why she posed for the pictures, she said, "When you see the story you'll understand why. The pictures are as im­portant as the story." 
Barbara said he didn't think

jury 

Barbara said. "I don't think it takes away her credibility. You have to keep in perspective that Jessica is 28 years old, and she was seven years younger and a very different person when this all happened." 
Barbara said his client's tes­timony was expected to center on the financial settlement she received rather than the sexual encounter itself. 
"I think most of the tes­timony will be about the events of 1984 and 1985 rather than 1980," Barbara said, adding that the 1980 incident was "in­disputable. Bakker has ad­mitted it." 
The attorney said it "was a very sad thing for her to be here. It's like reliving the whole incident.'' 
Barbara said his client didn't plan to seek more money from

Newsweek magazine said Biden does not mention the moot court competition on his resume, and did not win the po­litical science award at the Uni­versity of Delaware, where he received a single B.A. in poli­tical science and history. 
Biden told the New York Times he was "frustrated" and "angry as hell" about the Newsweek report.

Racial issues require more sensitivity 
During the past two weeks, there has been a great deal of controversy sur­rounding the "Life in Hell" cartoon which appeared in the September lOth edition of Scholastic Magazine. This in­cident has received a variety of responses from the student body and has generated heated debates regard­ing racial issues here at Notre Dame. For the past three years, I have asserted that communication is the pri­mary step towards bridging the gap which exists between minority and 

i white students on this campus. Al­though I would have preferred to see a more positive incident pave the way for such communication, this controversy has at least opened up the forum for discussion. 
Lisa Boykin 
guest column 
There are many issues to consider; however, let's start by examining the cartoon itself. I do not mean to defend the cartoon or the author, Matt Groen­ing. I am merely attempting to get at the heart of what Groening may have intended to express. The cartoonist is supposedly depicting his own success­sion from grammar school to college and satirically relaying the type of narrow-minded teachers he encoun­tered. In the eighth grade caption, the teacher warns Groening that in high school he will encounter gangs, drug pushers, and Negroes. This is the cap­tion which has ignited the controversy. From the tenth and eleventh grade cap­tions, which made reference to the hippy movement and peace demonstra­tions, I gathered that the time period Groening referred to was the late 1960's or early 1970's. Given the context of the entire comic strip, if one were to read the eighth grade alone, which is obvi­ously derogatory, the message would be different. Even though Groening's cartoon may have been referring to the 1960's, it is extremely disturbing that the association of gangs, drug pushers, and blacks are just as prevalent today as it was 20 years ago. There are still narrow-minded individuals who per­petuate these racial stereotypes and un­fortunately there are still individuals who find this type of behavior humorous. This, iri my opinion, is the crux of the issue. 
The debate surrounding Groening's cartoon, however, is not reserved to the 
Doonesbury 
ND community alone. During the sum­mer months, the Oklahoma Gazzette printed the same cartoon and encoun­tered the same reaction. According to the Scholastic editor, she did not know of the Oklahoma Gazzette incident when she approved Groening's cartoon for publication three weeks ago. Once again, I am not defending the Scholas­tic or its decision to print the cartoon. The fact that other people outside of ND have found this cartoon offensive is indicative of a broader social prob­lem. The issues which surround this controversy run much deeper than whe­ther or not the editorial staff of Scholastic exercised bad judgement in allowing the cartoon to be printed. Rac­ism, in all forms, is a reality of Amer­ican society whether we read about it in the Scholastic or not. It occurs in the "real world" and it occurs here at Notre Dame. I doubt that censoring a student magazine will shelter us from that harsh fact. I am not a mind reader, nor do I profess to be; however, this is the sad reality that I'd like to believe Groening attempted to convey. 
Yesterday, I read with great concern the response of two Notre Dame stu­dents to this controversy. What surprised me most was that both stu­dents found the eighth grade portion of the cartoon to be humorous. Although I could see the sad reality of racism tpat Groening unsucessfully attempted to make light of, I found no humor what­soever in the association of gangs, drug pushers, and blacks. Although I can ac­cept Ms. Bruns affirmation of not being "prejudice," I think that comments such as hers as well as Mr. Sammon's are an indication of the common insen­sitivity that many people have. These two students found nothing wrong with the cartoon and could not understand why members of the Notre Dame com­munity would be offended. 
Furthermore, Mr. Sammon referred to his fellow students, who may have taken offense to this cartoon as "vociferous prigs." Although I consider myself to have an extensive vocabu­lary, I must admit that I referred to Webster's Dictionary to find out what he meant. "Vociferous"is defined as "making or given to loud outcry." "Prig" is defined as "one who irritates by rigid or pointed observance of proprieties," and "propriety" is defined as "the standard of what is so­cially acceptable in conduct or speech." I am sorry if I may have bored

some of you with this vocabulary les­son; however, the definitions of these words only serve to illustrate my point further. Again, I am no mind reader, and I do not know whether or not Mr. Sammon realized the full extent of what he suggested by his word choice. What concerns me is that many students find such racial stereotypes to be humorous and acceptable. Today, these racial stereotypes are humorous in the car­toons; tomorrow, they may be humorous in the classroom or during Bookstore Basketball games at AnTos­tal. 
It is unfortunate that, in this day and age, racism and sexism are replaced by a display of insensitivity to the issues which impact the minority community. 
Campus spirit must be rejuvenated 
Dear Editor: 
I suppose that by today's standards, I am an "old grad," though in reality I'm only 45. I have been more than a watcher of Notre Dame football almost 30 years. I was a football manager back in the mid sixties, and have had a close relationship with Notre Dame athletics and the athletic department since graduation. 
The following remarks are made with good will but with warning to our stu­dent body. I am fully aware that things are different from the thirties, forties, and fifties, and even from the sixties and seventies. And yet, I have wit­nessed in the past three or four years a decline in the true Notre Dame Spirit. I don't think it can be attributed to wins and losses, but rather a lack of real fighting spirit on the part of Notre Dame students who are more preoc­cupied with their own personal pur­suits, than in the true support of our teams. 
Last week I visited the campus and had the oppurtunity to watch football practice for three straight days. We now have a real coach. He's not up in some ivory tower, but is on the field with the men, teaching, correcting, polishing, and most of all--COACHING! As an observer of Notre Dame football 
Garry Trudeau 
One certainly doesn't have to look far to find examples of this insensitivity-­for instance, Arizona Governor Evan Mecham's rescission of the state's ob­servance of Martin Luther King's birthday. It is not my purpose to "point the finger of guilt" at the people to which I have made reference. Rather, it is my sincere hope that we as a "Notre Dame family" can learn from this incident, and perhaps, in the fu­ture, remember that communication, understanding, and sensitivity can go a long way in bridging this gap that I mentioned earlier. 

Lisa M. Boykin is a senior govern­ment/philosophy major and a regular Viewpoint columnist. 
for a long time, I can say that Lou Holtz and all of his fine staff will do their job, but my serious concern is whether you­-the student body--will do yours. I've heard it said that most students do not attend the rallies, many sell their foot­ball tickets for extra money, and some really care little whether Notre Dame wins or loses on the gridiron. A winner at Notre Dame takes the concerted ef­fort of all of us at our rather small school by comparison with others. Will you be there to do your part? I sure hope so. 
Why? Well, chasing a pigskin may not be so important, if indeed that's all it is. But I sincerely believe, like Rockne and a host of others who've fol­lowed him, that the football program, which teaches players and students how to win with honor and decency, produces winners in life who will not let life defeat them, but will "win over all." So many who have had the Notre Dame Spirit imbue their lives, and who have achieved something and left a mark in this life, have done so because of the fighting spirit of our beloved alma mater. My question to the student body is simply this: Are you big enough, and strong enough, and determined enough, to carry on this great tradi­tion? Or is Coach Joe Paterno right when he said last year, "the Notre Dame mystique is dead! "?

Breaking: a habit 
A 
long with football games, final exams and all-nlghters, 
the study break Is an all-American college Institution. It 
Is performed In multiple settings, to various degrees and 
according to the particular style of each participant In the 
game. 

One's choice of study space determines to a great extent 
one's study break location. If hitting the books In a dorm, 
one can pop over to a friend's room, Interrupt his or her 
concentration and blow-off the next 20 minutes talking 
about nothing until someone else comes In and another 
quarter hour Is spent discussing what the newcomer Is not 
learning. 
Choosing to study anywhere In LaFortune Is usually a 
study break all of Its own. Friends, acquaintances and 
other attractive people are always passing through, and 
the time between visits available for actually accomplishing 
something usually averages seven minutes or so: never 
enough time to do anything. 
Mary Berger 
Back in the High Ufe 

The Pit Stop Is frequently performed by 'brar buddies In order to "be social and chat" but more Importantly to eat. During my Inquiries Into what constitutes a successful study break. I found that food Is a very dominant theme. 
At 9:45p.m. on a Wednesday night. one male student told me, "I have gone so long without eating that I need to now." Another explanation was that "everybody needs to eat; It's a natural, human need. If you are taking care of such a vital need, no one can point a finger or accuse you of blowing off." 
The most appetizing locations for food breaks? Hall food sales, the Huddle, the Ice-cream shop, vending machines, the Oak Room or one's own room with popcorn or pizza. 
There are some students however, who act In a different way and exercise their bodies In order to rt<Juvenate their minds. Picking up a Stepan Courts basketball game Is a Grace Hall resident's preference while some of his section­mates choose to play tag In the hallways. Running Is popular, too -both around campus and up and down the stairwells In the library. 
A junior explained that he still needs to complete his math requirement as the result of a bit-too-relaxing study  break his freshman year. "A friend called and asked if I'd like to take a bizarre study break. I said, 'Sure' and we went cross-countrv skllno for three hoursl" 

Mindless activities which allow one to "zone out" were the most popular choices among students. These options ranged from simply flipping through a magazine to "cranking" the Dead Milkmen on the stereo to the ever­popular sleeping. 
Some may say study breaks are a waste of time: valuable hours are lost during the breaks themselves and upon returning. the mind does not kick back Into "work" mode. On the other hand, one Is revived by a short Interruption. A change of pace makes one more alert and revives burnout. Having contact with people and the norms of life reminds one that those seemingly endless hours with the books will not Indeed last forever. Breaks serve as a little reward for those hours of work well done thus encouraging one to spend study time In a more productive manner. 
So the next time you find yourself reading the same page for the fifth time and your knees have conformed to the desk chair, go get something to eat. run to the thirteenth floor of the library or dance in the rain. Some­times, as all 7-Up fans know, you "gotta take a break."

Belles edge Oberlin, fall to Findlay 

By MOLLY MCNEILL Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's soccer team is off to a promising start this year under new Head Coach Tom Vanmeter. The 2-3 Belles split a pair of games at Findlay, Ohio last Friday against Findlay College and Oberlin College. 
The Belles were upset in the first match by Findlay, 2-1. Anne Czweda booted a shot from outside the goal box to score the Belles' only point. 
Vanmeter felt the team did not play together and gel as they usually do. 
"We played sloppy soccer and had no continuing plays that took us down the field to a goal," said Vanmeter. 
The Belle's quickly bounced back Saturday to defeat Ober­lin College, 3-2. 
K.C. Chandler scored the first goal on a shot from the corner that sneaked in the goal over the head of Oberlin's 

Voce 

injures hand 

Special to The Observer 
Center Gary Voce of the Irish basketball team frac­tured his right hand in a pickup game last week, leaving his hand in a cast for the next month. 
Skip Meyer, assistant trainer for the Notre Dame athletic department, said that Voce's hand will be ex­amined before Oct. 15, the opening of fall practice. Voce will then be fitted with a splint for another month, during which he will be al­lowed to practice. 
Voce injured his hand last Wednesday in a pickup game when former Irish guard Scott Hicks drove for a layup and accidentally kicked Voce in the hand. 
The team plays one preseason game against Yugoslavia Nov. 19 before opening the season Dec. 1 at Indiana. 
goalie. 
Freshman Tricia Troester then stole the ball from an Oberlin defender and sped down the field on a breakway, scoring her first goal of the season. 
With the score tied at two, Celest Aquino crossed the ball to Troester who challenged the defense and scored her second goal of the game, giving the Belles the winning edge. 
Coach Vanmeter was pleased with his team's perfor­mance, calling it "a 180 degree turnaround" from the game before. 
"We have a small team, but all players contributed to the victory," Vanmeter said. Van­meter referred to the victory as the "best team effort yet" and hopes the Belles continue playing as a winning team. 
The Belles will join the Notre Dame football team at Purdue this weekend when they take on the Boilermakers Saturday at 10 a.m. 
Irish inch to eighth 
Associated Press 
After an impressive 31-8 rout of Michigan State last Satur­day, Notre Dame moved up a notch to eighth in this week's Associated Press college foot­ball poll. 
Oklahoma, Nebraska, Auburn and LSU -the first three idle last weekend -held onto the top four spots in the poll Mon­day while Miami and Florida State inched ahead of Ohio State, which slipped from fifth place to seventh. 
Michigan State and Pitt fell out of the Top Twenty after two-week stays while Texas A&M and Iowa moved back into the rankings for the first time since the preseason poll. 
Oklahoma, which returns to action on Saturday at Tulsa, received 53 of 60 first-place votes and 1,193 of a possible 1,200 votes from a nationwide panel of sports writers and broadcasters. 
Nebraska, which visits 12th­ranked Arizona State on Satur­day, received the other seven first-place votes and points. 
1,129 
Auburn, with a road game against Tennessee coming up, received 1,028 points. All three teams have 2-0 records. 
LSU, 3-0 following a 49-16 vic­tory over Rice, remained No.4 with 995 points. 
Miami has been idle for two weeks -the Hurricanes meet lOth-ranked Arkansas in Little Rock on Saturday -but jumped from sixth place to fifth with 888 points. Florida State, a 41-24 winner over Memphis State, climbed from seventh to sixth with 869 points. 
Ohio State's shaky 24-14 tri­umph over Oregon cost the Buckeyes two spots in the rankings, dropping them from fifth to seventh with 867 points. Ohio State visits LSU on Satur­day. 
Notre Dame's win lifted the Fighting Irish from ninth to eighth with 788 points, while Clemson, which needed a last­second field goal to nip Georgia 21-20, slipped from eighth to ninth with 777 points. 
Arkansas' 30-15 victory over Tulsa boosted the Razorbacks 

Golf team edges Lansing for crown 
Special to the Observer 
After suffering through a season of one and two stroke losses last year, the Irish golf team turned things around Monday at the Glen Oaks Clas­sic, edging Lansing by one stroke to take the ten team tournament. 
The Irish compiled a score of 314 to edge Lansing on the par­72 Pine View Golf Club course in Three Rivers, Michigan. Notre Dame's Pat Mohan led all golfers with a round of 74 in the rain and mud, followed by Doug Giorgio (77), Dick Con­nelly (81) and Paul Nolta (82). 
Notre Dame's win at Pine View continued momentum that the Irish had started on the previous weekend, in a win over Western Michigan. 
A dual match with Western Michigan last Friday started the fall season for the Irish gol­fers, and the team responded Notre Dame shot a combined with a 27-stroke whipping of the score of 379 in the match.

It's official: NFL players on strike 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -NFL players called their second strike in six years Monday night, putting their six-figure salaries on the line for the freedom to choose where they work. 
"As of midnight tonight (Monday) the players of the National Football League will be on strike again," Gene Up­shaw, executive director of the NFL players Association, said in announcing the strike during halftime of the New England Patriots-New York Jets game. 
"None of us wants this, not the players, not the fans, not the owners, and that's really, really sad." 
The owners vowed to con­tinue the season Oct. 4-5, after a one-week delay, with non­striking regulars and free agents who were told to report Wednesday, the same day the union planned to start picket­ing. The owners said they would honor requests for ticket refunds . 
The issue was free agency. The union demanded that any player with more than four years' experience be free to choose his team; the owners in­sisted on some compensatic:ui for teams losing free agents, a system that has seen only one player change teams in a de­cade. 
There had been no talks since a meeting Friday between Up­shaw and Management Council negotiator Jack Donlan, and no further negotiations were scheduled. "The ball is in Gene's court," said Jim Con­way, assistant exerutive direc­tor of the Management Council.
