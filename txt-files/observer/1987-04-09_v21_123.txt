The combination of these two words evokes Kim scenes of back alley smoke-filled room corrup-Y f 
tion. ura ovac Come on, everyone knows that Chic~go . . 
politics is corrupt. From the Daley machme Assistant Accent Ed1tor 


through the Washington regime, accusations
and mud-slinging have flavored every cam­paign, making them more exciting to watch than the latest episode of "All My Children." 
Chicago newspapers thrive on politics. Itsells newspapers. It breeds controversy. If all of the politically-related articles were removed from recent issues of The Chicago Sun-Times and Tribune, there would hardly be enough news to last one visit to the bathroom. 
But, maybe that's where some of the recent political commentaries belong. 
The Sun-Times has been doing a little mud­slinging of its own. Maybe they didn't find the politics of late to be interesting enough so they created their own story. They asked challenger Ald. Edward Vrdolyak to withdraw from the race. 
I don't know from where they drew their au­thority. But I'm sure I speak for the majority of readers when I say that I don't like being told what to think. By asking Vrdolyak to withdraw from the race, they were telling voters not to vote for him. The least they could have done was to be subtle about their bias. 
What ever happened to fair journalism that afforded each candidate an equal chance? Ob­viously, the Sun-Times has no trust in the opinions of the voters or they would never have demanded such an absurd action. 
Why didn't they ask the other challengers, Hynes and Haider, to drop out, too, since they did not have Washington's majority? The Sun­Times, in this hasty action, ignored one of the fundamentals of the American democratic sys­tem: a government chosen by the people. 
When straight news is combined with biased editorial comment on the front page of a major newspaper, the reader is being brainwashed with opinion instead of receiving the facts he was expecting to receive. 
It is one thing to publish an editorial on the editorial page that blatantly says, ''This is one man's opinion." It is entirely different to demand that a candidate drop out of a mayoral race in the headlines. 
Perhaps the Sun-Times has suffered through being number two behind the Tribune for too long. Maybe they thought a little muckraking would sell a lot of papers. They were probably right. But what happened to their journalistic

conscience? They have ignored it in favor of selling more papers and making more money. 
The headlines on Monday's Sun-Times predicted a landslide victory for Harold Wash­ington. Now the newspaper has become a sooth­sayer. I thought that went out with gypsys and fortunetellers. The Sun-Times' predictions were realized in a victory that was not a landslide as they said, but in a victory nonethe­less. 
This is a classic example of the self -fulfilling prophesy. If the Sun-Times tells its readers there will be a landslide victory, many voters will be psyched out and think that there is no need to vote because a handful of votes don't matter in a landslide. They might just have well told their readers to vote for the incumbent because they thought he had the majority. 
The individual is lost in the majority. Instead of reviewing the qualifications and integrity of a candidate, the only thing that becomes im­portant is who is going to win. And how can a challenger have a chance when a major news­paper is biased in their editorials and report­ing? 
Responsible journalism seems to have taken a backseat to muckraking. If this continues, it won't be long before they will succeed in con­trolling our votes, dollars, and minds.

U.S. soldier defected because of army abuse 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW -An American sol­dier who defected to the Soviet Union says he did it because he was abused in the U.S. army and wanted "a chance to be a human being," the official news agency Tass said Wed­nesday. 
Wade Roberts said he "loved his people" and denied his desertion was treason, Tass re­ported. The agency said he was interviewed at a Moscow hotel, but it did not say which one or when. 
It was the first Soviet news report about the American since Kremlin officials an­nounced last week that Roberts had defected and Soviet aut­horities granted asylum to the soldier and a West German wo­man. 
The U.S. army has confirmed that a Pvt. 2 Wade Roberts was declared absent without leave March 2 from his army unit 45 miles northeast of Frankfurt, West Germany. 
It has not commented on So­viet reports of the defection, the first of an American soldier to the Soviet Union since the Vietnam war. 
According to Tass, Roberts gave a scathing account of his time in the Army. Itquoted Ms. Neumann as saying the Army had jailed him in a disciplinary case. 
Roberts suffered from "ar­bitrary actions in their most debased forms," the news agency said. "Commanders there get sadistic satisfaction from insults, ill-treatment and physical abuse." 
"Human dignity and human rights are flouted there at every turn, men are turned into robots," it said. "Americans are slapped on their faces and then called in a high-flown manner to defend democracy.''

Soviet claims bugging is an accepted 'way of life' 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -Alleged bugging of the new U.S. Em­bassy in Moscow and a spy-sex situation at the old embassy there have been blown out of proportion by the U.S. govern­ment, according to a Soviet diplomat. 
"It's common knowledge 
that everyone is bugging every­
one," said Pavel Pavlov, a 
member of the Soviet Embassy 
in Washington. "In diplomatic 
circles, it is accepted as a way 
of life, and I do not know what 
the uproar is about." 
Pavlov, who is lecturing at 
Indiana University-Purdue 
University at Indianapolis this 
week, made his comments at a 
news conference Tuesday. 
He said he was not impressed 
by the furor over an alleged 
sex-spy operation involving 
Marine guards at the U.S. Em­
bassy in Moscow. 
"Such things happen," Pav­
lov said. "Those are the facts 
of life. I don't know what you 
can do about them." 
But, he added, so much at­
tention on the incidents 
detracts from more important 
issues such as nuclear arms 
agreements. 
The United States and Soviet 
Union "should start dealing 
with the most important prob­
lems. A lot can be done to ease 
tensions -not only in principle, 
but in material ways," Pavlov 
said. "Then we can move into 
those gray areas and what 
seem now to be hopeless ones." 
He said his country has adopted a more open attitude and a new viewpoint under General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, but only time will tell if progress will be made in negotiations. 
''There are many signs that relations are improving. But I don't know if all these externals mean a deep and profound change in attitudes. I think any profound changes are yet to be seen in the future." 
He said the Reagan adminis­tration "keeps putting new ob­stacles in the way of agree­ments, and we simply can't prolong these tensions forever."

Two Notre Dame seniors awarded Mellon Fellowships 
By JOHN FLORY Staff Reporter 
Notre Dame seniors Megan Went and John Staud have been named winners of the Andrew 

W. Mellon Fellowship, an award given to outstanding col­lege students in the area of the humanities. 
The Mellon Fellowship was established five years ago by the Andrew W. Mellon Founda­tion to encourage careers in higher education. It presents winners with a cash stipend covering tuition and fees for postgraduate study at any uni­versity in the United States or Canada. Went and Staud have each been awarded $9750 for graduate school, an increase from past awards. 
The Fellowship was awarded to 122 college students this year, chosen from among 1772 applicants from 57 universities in the United States and Canada. 
Staud, a chemical engineer­ing and English major, said he learned of the award while as­king one of his professors, Thomas Werge of the English department, about graduate schools last summer. Werge nominated Staud for the fellow­ship and after submitting his name, Staud was sent an appli­cation package. 

The application required a 1000-word personal statement, college transcripts, two letters of recommendation, and a pref­erence form. In the preference form, Staud was asked to name three to five graduate schools he would like to attend and why. 
Staud applied for the fellow­ship in October, meeting the application deadline of Dec. 8. In February, he was sent a let­ter of invitation to a regional interview in Ann Arbor, Mich. Interviewed by a panel of five or six, he was later informed by letter that his candidacy was being reviewed by a central committee and that he was a semifinalist. 
By mid-March, Staud was "80 percent sure" of winning thP fPllowship, having learned that he was one of 155 semi­finalists competing for 122 fel­lowships. 
Went found out about the fel­lowship in a letter sent by Nat­han Hatch, dean of the College of Arts and Letters, in May and September of last year. 
An art history major, Went was nominated by Charles Rosenberg, professor of art his­tory. Like Staud, Went ap­peared before a panel of five interviewers in February. 
Went was also aware of being 
one  of  the  155 semifinalists  
being  considered  for  the  
award.  

Asked about his future plans, Staud says he is considering Northwestern, Penn, and Cor­nell, but favors Michigan, and will continue his studies in En­glish. 

Went said she is considering Columbia, and will likely pursue a five-year program in Art History leading to a Ph.D. for which the fellowship would pay the first two years. 
Staud stressed the qualifica­tions for the fellowship as aca­
demic  achievement,  serious­ 
ness,  and  a  strong  
"commitment  to  the  

humanities." Went added that careers in teaching are empha­sized by the Mellon Fellowship. 
Last year there were also two winners from Notre Dame. They were English major Bar­bara Rodrigues and Philoso­phy major James Louis. In 1985, there were three winners from Notre Dame, said Hatch, adding that in each of the preceeding four years, there has been a Fellow named from Notre Dame.

Earthquake rocks central Nicaragua 
Associated Press 
MANAGUA,-A strong earthquake rocked central Nicaragua for about 35 seconds on Wednesday, but authorities said they had no immediate reports of major damage or casualties. 
The government's seis­mological institute said it had no immediate reading on the quake, but the state radio, the Voice of Nicaragua, described it "as quite big." 
The tremor was recorded by 

U.S. geological Survey earthquake monitors in Golden, Colo., at a preliminary magnitude of 6.2 on the richter scale. It occurred at 11:43 a.m. 
A news bulletin read over Managua radio said authorities had no immediate reports of anyone being killed or hurt, adding there were no reports of major damage. 
The U.S. geological Survey said the earthquake occurred off the Pacific coast of Nicaragua, centered about 60 miles southwest of Managua, and was reportedly felt in nor­thern Costa Rica. 
Myra Guillen, a secretary at The Associated Press bureau in Managua, described the earthquake as "quite, quite big." She said it started at 11: 44 
a.m. and lasted about 35 seconds.

He also said he would not be a member of the president's Cabinet, unlike former CIA director William Casey, on grounds that the agency should be a gatherer of intelligence rather than an advocate for any particular policy. 
As for the Meese investiga­tion, senators asked Webster if, in retrospect, it would have been better if the attorney gen­eral had called in the FBI in the first place. 
Webster said that had he thought at the time there might be criminal activity inolved, he "absolutely" would have got­ten the FBI involved. 
However, he asked, ''Could the FBI agents have done a bet­ter job of conducting such an inquiry or looking for materi­als? I'm not sure I'm in a po­sition to answer that."

Latest cancer research

BOSTON -Nearly a quarter of patients with advanced can­cer show some response to an experimental therapy that turns their own blood cells into cancer hunters, and this could be "the dawn of a new ap­proach to treating cancer," a researcher says. 
The treatment uses interleukin-2, a natural disease-fighting chemical, to prime the body's defenses against cancer. The latest results essentially confirm con­troversial and highly publicized findings that gal-
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -A third Marine who worked as a secur­ity guard in Moscow and Leningrad and in the U.S. em­bassy in Rome has been ar­rested on suspicion of espionage, causing American officials to broaden their inves­tigations into security breaches in American diplomatic missions. 
Sgt. John Joseph Weirick, 26, of Eureka, Calif., was arrested Tuesday night and held in the brig at Camp Pendleton, Calif., said Robert Sims, chief Defense Department spokes­man. He is suspected of espionage while working as a security guard at the American consulate in Leningrad in 1981 and 1982, Sims said. 
Meantime, as American offi­cials sought to measure the damage caused by the infiltra­tion of American diplomatic missions by KGB agents and electronic eavesdropping devices, there were these developments:

Senate hearing on his nomina­tion to head the CIA that thevanized the attention of cancer Soviets use their new hilltopvictims and their families embassy complex in Washing­ton to intercept U.S. telephone communications. But he said he was unable to say "how much damage they are doing." 
.Secretary of State George P. Shultz told reporters that Soviet eavesdropping at the U.S. em­bassy in Moscow had cast ''a heavy shadow" over the talks he will hold next week in the Soviet capital. He said he in­tended to tell the Soviets "that they can't expect to continue to create a hostile environment for our people overseas without cost to themselves." 
Soviet 
Deputy Foreign Min­ister Vladimir Petrovsky said the U.S. charges that the KGB had bugged the new U.S. em­bassy in Moscow are "dirty fabrications" intended to spoil Shultz's trip. He accused Pres­ident Reagan of making "hos­tile remarks."

Church must recognize women's true role 
Being a Christian, I believe that my ultimate purpose and goal is to love God with all my heart, mind and soul and to love others as myself -even those who have committed grotesque sins against me and those whom I love. St. Paul has taught me how difficult it is to reach this degree of spiritual maturity. You see, I cannot find it in my heart to love this man, Pa,ul, of the New Testament. 
Chenoa Seaboy 
guest column 
When I think about the grotesqueness of the sin that he committed against me and all women, I can feel only dis­gust and hatred toward the man. His words about women reek of vanity and demonstrate the cruel degradation of other human beings which is the inevi­table outcome whenever any particular person, race or sex tries to establish their own superiority over all other people, races, or the opposite sex. Here are just some of his cruelest words: "But I want you to understand that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of a woman ... a man ought not to have his head covered, since he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of man. For man does not originate from woman, but woman from, man. For indeed man was not created for the woman's sake, but woman for the man's sake (1 Co­rinthians 11 :3-9). '' 
Jesus instructed His followers, "Do unto others as you would have others do unto you <Luke 6:31)." Suppose Paul were alive today and I asked him the following questions: Paul, would you like to be considered as being inher­ently inferior to more than half of the world's population simply because of the sex that you were born with? Paul, if you were to marry, would you like to be told by your spouse that you are to be "subject" to her in all things? Would you like to be considered as being the glory of your opposite sex, rather than the image and glory of God, simply be­cause you were born a man? 

It is obvious that his answer to these questions and all similar questions would be, "No." Clearly, then, Paul has not only violated one of our Savior's most important teachings, but has also taught others to violate it. 
But the real grotesqueness of Paul's sin consists in the fact that he thought 
Doonesbu 
and uttered such cruel words after he, himself, had received tremendous mercy and kindness from God; the fact that he, who had once so zealously per­secuted many courageous Christian women, still tried to establish his supe­riority and authority over them and all women after being so generously con­verted by God. 
Perhap's Paul's little thoughts about women wouldn't invoke in me so much anger and disgust and sadness if there weren't so many male religous "leaders" even today who share his at­titude toward women. One Sunday last summer I visited a fundamentalist Pen­tecostal Church service. A male preac­her was givng what I thought was a rather good sermon he said, "So, wo­men, go home to your husbands and say 'teach me'." I was nauseated. Don't get me wrong. I have nothing against women learning from men. But I do have something against men thinking they can't or shouldn't be taught by and 
"Paul, would you like to be considered as being in­herently inferior to more

population  simply

you were born with?" 

learn from women. 
Later, the women who had invited me to the service asked me how I liked it. So I told them, and it tore my heart out to hear them trying to convince me that women really are inferior to men and that we should be subject to them, etc. It was like hearing a black person trying to convince another black person that blacks really are inferior to whites and that they should be subject to whites, etc. Or like hearing a women who has just been beaten by her hus­band trying to convince her horrified children that she deserved the beating. I was too torn apart to feel anger. That night I simply cried. 
However, it isn't only fundamentalist churches that are like this. The Catholic Church is a prime example. This view of women is implicit in the fact that women aren't allowed to become car­dinals, priests, bishops and popes. In their pastoral letter on the U.S. eco­nomy, the U.S. Catholic Bishops con­demn social injustice and degrading sit-

uations of unemployment and homelessness. But considering the way they treat and obviously view women, I just cannot believe that they are really bothered by the fact tha people are just being degraded and treated unjustly. As Jesus said, "You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother's eye (Luke: 42)." When I hear the Catholic leaders asking for forgiveness from all women and that Catholic women are now allowed to fill all the positions that men can fill -then I will believe that injustice and degradation of human beings truly bothers them. If the Church leaders simply allow Catholic women to enter these positions of ser­vice without apologizing and asking for forgiveness, I will remain unconvinced. They will be like the white restaurant owner who now allows blacks only be­cause he or she has been forced to. 
Jesus told the apostles, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exer­cise authority over them. It is not so among you, but whoever wishes to be­come great among you shall be your servant (Matthew: 20: 25-27)." Clearly, this teaching has been ignored by most Christian men throughout the centuries since Christ -including St. Paul. 
As usual, our world is in desperate need of a spiritual renewal. I am con­
vinced that in order for this to happen, 
Christians from all demoninations 
must unite in what is perhaps the one 
thing that we all agree on -that our high­
est calling and most basic duty as 
Christians is to love God with all our 
heart, mind and soul, and to love others 
as ourselves. 
Christians do not need more morals and doctrines and rules and regulations added to the useless pile that already exists. We need love -the kind that can pierce the darkest evil. But I can assure you that there can be no Christian unity so long as Christian men share Paul's view of women. You see, when someone truly loves another as their own self, that person does to the other just as they would have the other do to them. True lovers do not seek to dominate and rule over others. 
John Ruskin once said, "Pride is at the bottom of all great mistakes." Many Christian men from all denominations will be making a great mistake if they do not change the way they view and treat women soon. And I am certain that, pride will be at the bottom of it . 
In the meantime, I will be praying for the grace to forgive and love St. Paul, and I ask for your prayers for this as well.

Honesty and straightfor­wardness is characteristic not only of the adults, but of the youth of Appalachia as well. Marc Haygood, a senior from Chicago, spent one af­ternoon working at the youth center in Martin. "I thought they would be kind of timid," says Haygood, "But they just ran up to me and asked me, 'What is your name?' and grabbed my hand and said, 'Hey, let's play pool!' " 
Haygood, along with Peggy Woodward, a junior from Miami. and Missy Hol­land, a sophomore from Tiverton, R.I., also worked with infants at the day care center. "At first the infants were kind of apprehensive when I arrived," he says, "But by the end of the day they really got attached to uS; and some of them cried when we left." Haygood also was attached, and as a souveneir of his work he now possesses a photo of three of the infants. 
Not all of the jobs involved directly working with the people. The purpose ofjobs such as seed distribution and home repair was to help people help themselves, the basic philosophy under which CAP operates.

It should be noted that all the things the group did and experienced would not have been possible If it weren't for the group of permanent volunteers who work for CAP. Many of them have just gotten out of college and have donated up to a year of their time to working in the mountains. 
One volunteer by the name of Kevin took the stu­dents to the areas off the main roads to give them a closer look at the way of life in Appalachia. Many houses they drove past were run­down and littered with trash around them. And to the students who believed that the people of Appalachia took pride in their land, these houses were a disturb­ing sight. 
"It's bad that people have to live like that," says Lopach. "We walked off this one road, and all this trash was just left there as if 
someone else would take 
care of it." 

"I think it's because they don't really have the gar­bage collection," says Stiglmeier. "What are they going to do with It? The ap­pearance isn't that great, but are you going to fault them? It isn't vegetables or food; it was cars and stoves. I talked to the permanent volunteers about it, and they said the same." 
The permanent volunteers are there not only to work, but also to educate groups of students on Appalachia and help make the experi­ence worthwhile, to make it have a lasting impression on the students. And through their guidance, as well as the work experince and the interaction with the people of Appalachia, spring break '87 is one experience the eleven students from Notre Dame won't forget. 


Few of the more priviledged people live in private residences. Within the heart of the city, 80% of the population live in common housing. Each family has its own room and corridor, but kitchen and bathroom facilities are shared with other residents, perhaps three other families. If someone over the age of 18 wishes to buy an apartment, possibly after waiting one year and having to prove how the money was obtained, an apart­ment with one room, a kitchen, one corridor and a bathroom will cost about $12,000. A similar three-room apartment would follow at approximately $37,000. 
When a couple gets married, each person receives approximately $200 from the government, but should they divorce, each must pay the government a fee of $320. There is a 40% divorce rate among couples who have been married for at least three years. If a father who has been divorced has one child, 25% of his salary must go towards child support, and this percentage increases with the number of children. In most cases the mothers receive custody unless they have drug. alcohol, or other problems which would hinder the quality of child raising. 
According to our tour guide, alcohol abuse in the Soviet Union has diminished. Citizens can still buy alcohol between 2 and 7 p.m. "After about three to four hours in line one may get vodka, otherwise wine," the guide explains. State-owned bars do exist, but they don't offer any alcohol. In restaurants one person may purchase 100 grams of alcohol. Not many people frequent restaurants, however, because an evening may cost the equivalent of between $16 to $24. 
Our guide Leonard explained that "now all magazines, newspapers, and even the theater criticize day-to-day Soviet life." Changes are said to be occurring In social life but not in food or clothing. He seemed to express hope about Oorbachev's new policy of sponsoring private enterprise, such as shops and restaurants, which will be put to the test starting the first of May. 
As for the few Soviet citizens I saw, they seemed to be content. It Is true they have not much In the material sense. Their clothes are of cheap quality and are very expensive. A set of men's boxers and pajama shirt cost about $60, and women's shoes can run from $160 on up. 
The government takes care of everything for the people. They have jobs, and there are state-owned stores and forms of entertainment. "A model city," Leonard said of Moscow with a smirk on his face, "There is no unemploy­ment or people living in the streets," 
Life in Moscow, socialist life, seemed to me to be, quite simply, existence. Food is bought because people need to be nourished, clothes are bought because people are cold and need to clothe their bodies, work obligations are fulfilled because they must be. The people did seem content, but there was a spirit a vlvacitie, something missing. 
On a visit to an art museum I spent some time studying the art works but more time studying the people. Families mingled, they had smiles on their faces, and fathers held their little girls' hands. In the Impressionist section, one mother In her fur hat and snow boots talked to her son about each work, showed him the details up close, and then backed away to show him how all of the dans blended together. It was as precious as the works them­selves. 
1 am still asking myself what life is really like there, if the people are happy. Is their present form of socialist government acceptable? Is it the system they desire? 
When I asked Leonard if the Soviet people are generally happy, content. and pleased with their government he froze up, turned his head away, and said, "No statistics." I asked, "But what do you think?" He looked me in the eye and held my glance for a moment as if he wanted to answer, wanted to tell me what he thought. He shook his head then, as if to shake off the thought and repeatd, "No statistics."

Men's tennis team shows grace under pressure in 6-3 win 

By THERESA KELLY Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's ten­nis team was strong under pressure Tuesday, winning three of four matches that went the full three sets while defeat­ing Bowling Green, 6-3. 
"We played well," said Head Coach Tom Fallon. "It was nice to have won the close matches this time." 
Irish number-one singles player Tim Carr won his match in three sets, taking the first set from Bowling Green's Rick Boysen, 6-4, then dropping the second, 1-6. Carr and Boysen battled to a tie-breaker in the third, with Carr coming out on top, 7-6. 
Brian Kalbas, the number­two man for Notre Dame, also went the distance, 6-2, 4-6, 6-4. 
Dan Walsh won the third three-set match for the Irish by following the pattern set by his teammates. Walsh won the first set, 6-3, and dropped the second, 3-6, before beating Bowling Green's Mike Cansfield in the third, 6-4. 
Irish fifth man Mike Wallace had little trouble in his second meet back from a shoulder in­jury, winning in straight sets, 6-1, 6-1. 
Teammates Dave Reiter and Paul Daggs suffered losses to their Bowling Green oppo­nents. Reiter lost, 6-2, 7-6, in the number-three spot, and Daggs went to a third set tie­breaker before losing, 6-2, 4-6, 7-6. 
In doubles action, the Irish took two of three matches, with Carr and Reiter winning in the number-one spot, 7-5, 6-3. · Teammates Walsh and Daggs had an easier time, 6-4, 6-2, in the second match. Irish number-three pair of Wallace and Sean O'Brien lost in two, 7-5, 6-4. 
"Maybe it was the good wea­ther," said Fallon of his team's overall performance. "It had been a while since we'd played outside.'' 

The Irish hope the good wea­ther and the good play continue this weekend as they host Eas­tern Michigan on Sunday. Notre Dame is undefeated against their next opponent, holding a 16-0 record dating back to 1970. 
"The  Eastern  Michigan  
team  is  a  lot  like  Bowling  
Green,"  said  Fallon.  "We  
ought  to  be looking  at  more  

close matches on Sunday."

Belles drop twinbill 
By MOLLY MCNEILL Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's softball team was swept in a doubleheader by Val­paraiso, 5-3, 11-3, on Tues­day. 
Trish Tierney went one­for-three with one RBI in the first game, while Dawn Kon­tek also went one-for-three at the plate. 
A three-run rally in the sixth inning gave the Belle's hopes for a comeback in the seventh, but they were un­able to score. 
The Belles were hitting the ball well, but unfortunately right at the tough Valparaiso fielders. 
In the second game, Dawn Brohman found the hole in the Valparaiso outfield and slammed a home run to right-center field. 
The home run was one of her two hits and two RBis. 
Senior Kris Pantelleria ripped four hits in as many at bats, including a bunt­single. Martha Judge also contributed one hit to the the Belles' effort. 
Pitcher Liz Pokora was unable to complete the game because of a muscle spasm and was replaced by Colleen Murphy. 
The Belles travel to IUPUI today to face Hanover Col­lege. Their next home game will be on Aprilll, when they play host to St. Francis.

Speaking ofDodger Blue, Los Angeles has been the focus of certain colors, namely black and white, as General Manager AI Campanis resigned over ra­cial comments he made on Monday night. 
The Dodgers will be trying to aviod the disabled list this year, now that manager Tommy Lasorda has his star left fielder Pedro Guerrero back from a knee injury. 
A youth movement has given the Cincinnati Reds the most preseason hype of any of the NL West teams. Eric Davis is being heralded as baseball's top all-around player, and fresh new names such as Barry Larkin and and Kal Daniels are expected to give the Reds the edge this year. 
But I don't buy it. The pitch­ing staff isn't quite as strong, and the biggest question mark is Mario Soto, who has a 5-10 record and 4.71 ERA last year, though granted he did have shoulder problems. 
Injuries appear to be the key in the division this season. The San Francisco Giants will count on three pitchers coming back from injuries-Atlee Ham­maker, Roger Mason and Jim Gott.

In fact its hard to get a handle on just how good the Giants will be this season. Already Roger Craig's team has dumped San Diego twice, and the Giants could make it a four-way battle in the division. 
The San Diego Padres have a new manager in Larry Bowa and are so young that people are saying that this team will be great in a few years. That's fine, but I'm only looking at this season. 
And the Atlanta Braves have a new look with a brand-new uniform design and the loss of third baseman Bob Horner. I hope manager Chuck Tanner has gotten used to riding the bottom of divisions because this should be his fourth straight season in the cellar. 
Obviously the Padres and the Braves are my final two picks for the bottom. But what about the top? The Dodgers have won every odd year this decade, but the streak stops here. And even though there hasn't been con­secutive championships in thiS" division since 1978, Houston will end that streak. How 'bout them 'stros!

Overall, it's a quality group. 
Second place goes to the New York Mets if for no other rea-· son than the non-repeating syndrome. But other than that, the Mets have some other prob­lems that may unravel last year powerhouse. Dwight Gooden will be in drug rehab for a while, Roger McDowell is injured and a host of off -the­field problems have sur­rounded this team since its shining moment. 
Third place goes to the only quality team left, the Philadel­phia Phillies. Philadelphia has a nice blend of youth and expe­rience in its lineup. Mike Eas­ler (.302, 14HRs, 78 RBis), ac­quired from the Yankees for Charles Hudson, adds punch to lineup that already includes sluggers Von Hayes (98 RBis) and Mike Schmidt (37 HRs, 119 RBis). 
This is where the quality in this division takes a nosedive.

Unfortunately, Rick Sutcliffe and Steve Trout lead a pitiful pitching staff (last place with a 4.49 ERA) that will give up some runs anywhere, and they'll give up a lot more at Wrigley Field. 
The Pittsburgh Pirates will take fifth. The Pirates are very young, especially their pitch­ing staff. Doug Dra beck and Bob Kipper will have to respond to help first baseman Sid Bream, outfielders Barry Bonds and Van Slyke, second baseman Johnny Ray and third sacker Jim Morrison (no, not THAT Jim Morrison) get some wins. 
The cellar goes to the Montreal Expos by a landslide. The off-season was not kind to MontreaL They lost an all-star outfielder, Andre Dawson, probably will get one back, Tim Raines, but only after he has missed over a month. They traded one of the National League's finest relievers, Jeff Reardon, to Minnesota for peanuts. That leaves them with a team even the optimist-of­optimists won't believe is a con­tender.

Billy Gardner is out to do just that. Right fielder Danny Tar­tabull was acquired from Seattle, where he hit 25 home runs and added 96 RBis, and the versatile Juan Beniquez 
comes to the Royals from Bal­timore, where he has batted .300 or better in each of his last four years. 
Add the familiar names of George Brett, Frank White and Willie Wilson, and throw in the fact that none of these players are used to finishing out of first place, and it looks like another royal season in Kansas City. 
If last year is any indication, the Texas Rangers are a team of the future, and should make a strong run at the AL West title this season -thanks to some kids who come through when given the opportunity. 
Rookies, rookies and more rookies led the traditionally­hapless Rangers to a very un­traditional season and a second-place finish. For example, first-year left fielder Pete Incaviglia tied a club record with 30 homers, while Ruben Sierra smacked a record 10 triples, even though he was not called up until June 1by manager Bobby Valentine. 
The California Angels are not the same team that battled the Boston Red Sox in that memorable AL championship classic last year. Gone are Reggie Jackson, Rick Bur­leson, Doug Corbett and Terry Forster -along with any hopes of topping last season's 92-70 mark. 
Tony LaRussa's Oakland A's have the bats of Reggie Jackson (yes, he's back) and Jose Can­seco going for them. But they also have the strikeouts of those two men going against them. 
The Minnesota Twins just don't have the pitching. Fifth place. 
The Chicago White Sox just don't have the hitting. Sixth place. 
The Seattle Mariners don't have either one. Seventh place, easily.

They are the same folks who put all those ads in Classifieds, wear capes, worship Stonehenge and do various other goofy things such as use an "oaken cudgel" to try to block the 4 Fags' shots in yes­terday's game. Andy 'Pheonix' Saal of the Druids was able to block seven shots with the cudgel, which really was just a big stick. 
"Sunspot activity changed the phase of the moon and caused all our shots to be off by four inches," said ArchDruid Mark McLaughlin of his team's 0-of-24 shooting.

The Gashmasters held an 11-5 lead at the half, but Glazed Donuts fought back to even the score at 16. The two teams traded baskets to the wire until Glazed Donuts' Rick Gates, with his team up 20-19, sunk a 15-footer for the win. Gates was modest after his game-winning bucket. 
"I don't even like glazed donuts," said the Columbia City, Indiana native. 
Ironically, the players on both of these teams are neigh­bors at Campus View. They planned on getting together last evening to watch replays of the game over beverages. Just like the big time.

The Kansas City Royals have some­thing to prove, and perhaps more im­portantly, they have the perfect divi­sion in which to prove it. 
The Royals went from champions of the baseball world two years ago to a 76-86 team last season, when they es­tablished themselves as the American League's second-to-last team in runs scored. But this year should see Kansas City back in the top spot, thanks to some

fresh young faces, some hungry old ones, and the easiest division in baseball. 
Sure ace reliever Dan Quisinberry only saved 12 games after four succes­sive seasons as Fireman of the Year, but you can't expect a guy to save many games when his team isn't getting in front. 'The Quiz' might not be 'The Su­perquiz' of old, but he should find the going a little easier this year behind Bret Saber hagen (7-12, 4.15 ERA), Charlie Leibrandt (14-11, 4.09), Danny Jackson (11-12, 3.20) and Mark Gubicza (12-6, 3.64). 
This is a team that would be 15 games better than anyone in the AL West if it could find some runs, and new manager

hind Jerry Melia's 15 points, in­cluding all 11 of the Cheeses' first-half points. It seems only two cheeses showed up for this one, as the winners played with only four guys while the losing team was comprised of five girls. 
Melia, relishing his opportu­nity to play hotdog, gathered most of his points from layups as a result of the fast break or just plain ole basket-hanging. His layup conversion percentage was somewhat lower than Indiana's Steve Al­ford three-point shooting percentage, as Melia turned in a 15-of-42 performance. 
''About the only thing I could fill up was the scoresheet," said Melia after looking at the game's tally sheet. 
The five girls from Team No. 659 were in the game through­out, thanks to the seven-point, nine-rebound and one-broken­nail performance of Nannette 
,LaFond. "Nannette was a major force in the game until she broke that nail," said John Fitzsimmons of the Cheeses. 
All five girls got on the scoreboard, including Michelle LaRose, who scored her team's final point. 
"We· just really wanted to make sure LaLa (LaRose) scored at least once this semes­ter," said Jenny Hallenback.

Maybe if I say it a few more times, I'll really believe it. Nevertheless, the National League East is separated into two definite groups: the contenders and the no-way-in-becks. 
And leading the way for the con­tenders will be the St. Louis Cardinals. This team made a major deal, trading

outfielder Andy VanSlyke and catcher Mike Lavalliere for Tony Pena, who has few peers as a backstop. The rest of the lineup will be solid if last season's wounds are fully healed. Willie McGee and Jack Clark are trying to rebound, and if they do, the Cards are looking good. 
Other keys are 'The Wizard' Ozzie Smith, who has improved his offense (107 SBs) to go with his acrobatic field­ing, speedster Vince Coleman and the progress of rookie outfielder Jim Lin­deman, who was impressive enough to facilitate Van Slyke's departure. 
The pitching includes starters Greg Mathews (11-8), John Tudor (13-7) and Danny Cox (12-13), and super-stopper

a little help from Sports Illustrated's baseball preview issue, I'll try to give a run down of the division. 
The Houston Astros are the defending champs and should be near the top again this season. The entire starting lineup returns, including Cy Young award winner Mike Scott and Nolan Ryan, who will be trying to make it through the season without injuring his right elbow again. 
Already the Astros are fired up, taking the first two games from Los Angeles. And manager Hal Lanier is hot too after he was nearly beaned by 
a  warm-up pitch from  the Dodgers'

game.
