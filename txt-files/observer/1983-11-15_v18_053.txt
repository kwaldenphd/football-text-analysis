Reactions to nuclear dilemma class mixed 
ByALAN PARKIN 
News Staff 
Though reactions to the Univer­sity's new Nuclear Dilemma class is mixed, many students say the course, team-taught by teachers. from five departments, is worth taking. 
Most of the students said they signed up for the class in order to learn more about the scientific and moral aspects of the nuclear issue due to its relevance to the future of our planet. 
Inaugurated this semester, the 
Nuclear Dilemma cla.">s intends to 
make students consider the implica­
tions of nuclear weapons. The 
course takes students from 
Truman's decision to drop atomic 
bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki 
to the peace and war pastoral of the 
National Conference ofCatholic Bis­
hops last spring. 
Since the course consists of stu­
dents from many different 
departments, the course considers 
the economic, philos ophical 
theological, and political aspects of 
the nuclear war debate. The course 
is cross-listed in the philosophy, 
theology, ecQilomics, government, 
and sociology departments. 
The class uses a team-teaching for­
mat and includes guest speakers 
who lecture on a specific field of in­
terest. Most students say spe akers 
present interesting and important 
facts; many students even said the 
lecturers should speak for a longer 
period of time than the hour or so 
they are allotted. 
"The speakers have so much to 
tell in so little time that it is difficult to take notes and concentrate on what they arc saying at the same time," said senior Carol Cizauskus. 
Others agree the format allows the students to learn of differing viewpoints and makes the class more interesting. 
Some students have said, however, the majority of speakers have presented only the theological approach to the issue. concentrating primarily on the U.S. bishop's pas­toral on peace and war. These stu­dents are dissatisfied by the heavy theological accent and want to know more about the reasons for the 
U.S. government's support of nuclear weapons. 
"Up to this point, the speakers have dealt a bit too much on the theological viewpoint," said College of Arts and Letters senior Tom Bauer. "Hopefully the other view­points will be emphasized more in the future," he said. 
The class syllabus indicates more government speakers will lecture during the remainder of the semes­ter. 
Except for a few objections, most students said the class is living up to their initial expectations. 
junior Kevin Conelly said that he has already recommended the course to other students. Other stu­dents agreed, saying the course "forces one to think about the issue," and because of it "serves a more practical purpose than many other philosophy and theology courses." 
One student said he would not recommend the course at the present time, but said he would if the course "becomes a bit more or­ganized and cohesive" in the future.

Katie \X'hdahan is a senior govcrnml'nt major. In 
many ways she is an ordinary Saint Mary's studt:nt. 
\X'ith one exception. 
She possesst:s a vote on the Saint Mary's Board of

\X'hdahan is this }Tar's student regent at Saint Mary's. 
She has the right to vote on all issut:s that art: to ht:

Thl' ideals of any learning institution include the idl·als of tht· students. l'or this rl·ason. including a studl·nt on the ultimatl' governing hoard of an institution is an excellent policy. 
:1.1anv pl'opk. said \\'hdahan. "don'! know who intnprl'ts the ideals ami what that llll'ans." A studt·nt who is involved in hoth thl'

imposing an unprecedented censorship ot the press during the invasion, it has acted againsr tht· right of the puhlk to obtain information through a free and independent press. 
However. a~ implied above, even if the ad­ministration had respected democratic prin­ciple~ and procedures in carrying out the invasion. it would still not he justified. 
:\<lore than one n·nrury of l ·.s. armed inter­ventions in Latin Amcrka shows that neither democracy nor a decem international order can ht· achieved through military force. In fact. it ha~ had just the opposite result. When we examine the consequences of these inter­ventions. it is dear that they have been direct­ly or indirectly responsible for the 
establishment of dthcr outright military dic­tatorships or unrepresentative, and thus fraudulcnt. governments. 
.\foreover. gun-hoat diplomaq· and re<:ur­rent harassment art· largely responsible for the militarization and the strengthening of Communism in the socialist rcvolutins of Cuha. Nicaragua and <ircnada. 
llow then can the I ·.s. government hcst dct(:nd democracy and peace in the hcmi­spht·re' It is not through the liSt: of military t()rcc. The invasion of<ircnada, just as much as the invasion of Afghanistan hy the Soviet I 'ni­on. sabotages the promise of a civilized inter­national onkr. Both invasions embody a logk of hostility and increasing violence in world 
songs and tlowcr pt•lals will provide sufficent armor to Slop small arms fire. machine gun tire. and grenades. To prove ·!his. do the following:

rdarions. Amcrka's allks now have every 
reason nor w trusr the I ·.s. government'scom­
mitmenr to disarmamcnl in nuclear issues. 
The l:nilcd Stales can foster world peace and democracy hy de-emphasizing lhc Easi­West componcnl of regional contlicts and hy emphasizing North-Sourh dialogue through regional mediators. such as those offered hy the Contadora group. This administration's reliance on military force gives linle credence to its claim that it seeks democracy in El Sal­vador and Nkaragua. 
The government must accept abroad what it believes at home: that democracy is a process of subjecting all interests to competi­tion. to what is in effect uncertainly, hut an uncertainty defined within the rule of law. 
Therefore, this administration must accept that it cannot "export democracy,'' nor even achi<:ve its security goals, hy means of violent actions against other sovereign states, whether democratic or not. 
In this conrext. the invasion of Grenada has an important implication. Ifthe l 'nitcd States docs not change its course ofinternational ac­tion -especially hut not exclusively in rela­tion to Ccnrral Amcrka and the Caribbean ­all of us, Americans or not, will he devoured hy the deadly logic of violent reactions and 
counter-reactions of which  Grenada  is  the  
most  recent  hut  most  likely  not  the  last  
episode.

"Our problem is that we get carried away and los~ discipline," say the Stanford quarterback. "We'll get inside the twenty and then make a mental mistake like a p~nalty after a play. Most of it is due to over­aggressiveness." 
Cotter and the rest ofthe Stanford team are confident about facing Dil­lon. 
"The pressure is on them," Cotter 
says. "They have to win. Our goal 
was to get to the final. I think we're 
finally showing that the North Quad 
can produce quality football." 
But don't look for Dillon to make 
it easy for Stanford. They have faced 
their biggest challenge in the last 
few years against Flanner and have 
come out on top. Additionally, the 
Big Red Machine appears to be finely 
tuned again this year. 
Who will come out on top in this 
battle between the perennial power 
and the North Quad upstarts should 
be known by sometime late Sunday 
afternoon.

Hold off on those Christmas Break plans 
By MIKE SULLIVAN 
Sports Editor 
If you are now making plans to be 
home t<>r all ofChristmas Brc:ak, you 
might want to hold off for a while. It 
now appears that Notre Dame will 
be going to a bowl game after all.

A Boston College-Notre Dame matchup would give the liberty Bowl officials their second excellent game in a row. Last year, Alabama played Illinois in the bowl in Bear Bryant's last game as the Alabama head coach. This year, they would have what some people are dubbing as the "Catholic Super Bowl." 
"The only two Catholic schools playing Division I-A -maybe we should have a bingo game at halftime," joked Boston College's sports information director, Reid Oslin. 
Both schools would receive more than bingo winnings for competing, though. The liberty Bowl, which is played in Memphis, Tenn., pays 5620,000 to each school. It is also
