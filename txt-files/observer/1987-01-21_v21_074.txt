Montanaro found guilty of plagiarizing research paper 
By MARK PANKOWSKI 
and TRIPP BALTZ News Editors 
An academic honesty com­mittee found Student Body Vice President Don Montanaro guilty last week. of plagiarizing a major research paper, sources told The Observer. 
Montanaro was ordered to rewrite the paper on a different topic or flunk the fall-semester 
course,  said  a  source, who  
spoke  on  condition  of  
anonymity.  

Two other Notre Dame stu­dents, who were working with Montanaro on the group proj­ect, were also found guilty of plagiarizing, the source said. 
Montanaro would not discuss details about the committee proceedings. He did say, however, "I can tell you what is involved in this situation is poor organization, careless­ness and ignorance of the rule of footnoting. 
"What has come out of this is that we have to produce a new paper." 
One of the students this week confirmed the three appeared before an academic honesty committee on Wednesday. He declined further comment, saying the committee's proceedings are confidential. 
Speaking Tuesday night, Montanaro said the incident "in no way affects my ability to do my duty as student body vice president.'' 
Student Academic Commis­sioner Doug Wurth, however, said he thinks Montanaro should resign. 
"I think anyone should resign their position of leadership if they've been shown to violate or ignore the University regu­lations," Wurth said. "Basical­ly, it's a violation of the com­munity." 
Student Body President Mike Switek was not at home Tues­day night and could not be reached for comment. 
Montanaro and the students were caught plagiarizing late last semester in a class entitled "American Voting and Elec­tions," the source said. 
The 400-level government course was taught by Professor David Leege, who acknowl­edged that an incident of plagiarism occurred in his class last semester. 
"I have indicated publicly that there was a charge of plagiarism in my class and that the charge was sent to the de­partment's honesty commit­tee," said Leege, who declined further comment. 
The source said Montanaro plagiarized by copying from publications and not document­ing where the information came from. 
Montanaro and the stu­dents' punishment entails that they must get the equivalent of a "B" on the paper they are to rewrite, the source said. No matter what grade they nor­mally would receive on the paper, however, they still will get a failing grade on it. 
The failing grade will then be 
averaged in with their mid­
term and final exam grades, 
the only other marks they 
received in the course, the 
source said. If they fail to do 
the paper, they fail the course. 
Notre Dame's student hand­
book du Lac states that a stu­
dent committing an academic 
offense, if serious enough, 
could face ''penalties up to dis­
missal from the University." 
The penalty's severity also 
depends on whether the student 
has committed a previous of­
fense, duLac states. 

Students found guilty of aca­demic offenses have the option of appealing the committee's decision to the dean of the col­lege. Montanaro and the two · students are apparently not 
appealing. 
A few years ago, Wurth said, 
the administration asked a stu­
dent leader to resign because 
the leader charged personal 
phone calls to a student govern­
ment credit card. Wurth added, 
however, that he doubted the 
administration would ask for 
Montanaro's resignation. 
Montanaro said the adminis­
tration has taken no stand on 
the plagiarism incident. 
"This is a college matter," 
he said.

Fired friend not perfect but will be missed by at least one 
A friend of mine told me last night that he was no longer employed. 
He did not quit, even though he knew that continuing to work in the position he held jeopardized his future with the business. To him, quitting was something he could not even consider; it meant giving up, and he would never give up on a commitment he had under­taken. 
And so he continued to work, hoping things between him and the management would some­how get better. But they didn't, and yesterday my friend called to say he had been fired. 
Anyone who has ever experienced a firing knows how devastating it can be. It is not just the loss of a paycheck and the security a salary brings; this was not a problem for my friend, who has already obtained other employment. 
Being fired is more a loss of an identity; you are no longer part of an organization by which you defined yourself. You no longer have a place where you are needed for your own personal abilities, and that can leave you feeling adrift and more than a little like a failure. 
In the case of my friend, anyone who ever worked with or under him knows this is simply not true. Vince Lombardi once said, "If you're lucky enough find a guy with a lot of head and a lot of heart, he's never going to come off the field second." Judged by these standards, my friend lost nothing more than his position, be­cause no one put more of himself into every­thing he undertook than he did. 
Sometimes that got him into trouble; it was probably the characteristic which got him fired. Because he had such enthusiasm for the work he did, and because he set such high standards for himself, he often demanded more from his colleagues and employees than it seemed he had a right to. His own confidence that he would succeed in anything he attempted might have been considered cockiness, and was often a source of friction between him and others. But it was also an infectious quality that imbued his staff with the same assurance. 
I remember the time he told me about a proj­ect that had to be completed in a four-hour dead­line, a project that was so involved and impor­tant that most people thought it could not be done within such stringent time limits. Not only did his staff finish the job in the record time he had set, but they produced some of their best work. And I know my friend was there from beginning to end, doing as much as everyone else and giving them the confidence to succeed. 
I also remember the times he called and told 


Mary Heilmann 
Assistant News Editor 

me about mechanical problems in his office, problems which he often worked late into the night to correct. There was no recognition in these hours of overtime work and little reward other than the personal satisfaction which comes from a job well done. But that was enough for my friend, and it kept him going when most people would have given up. 
I don't mean to make this man sound like the perfect worker, or some kind of hero for manag­ing to get fired from his job. I know he might have been difficult to work with, and I can only imagine what it would have been like to be his boss. I suppose I'll never know all the reasons why he was relieved of his duties; that is some­thing between him and his boss,.and I don't pretend to know the answers. 
I do know that he'll be missed by those he worked with. And if you're wondering why I'm writing this article, telling you about a friend of mine who lost his job just like thousands of other people in thousands of other offices all over the country, I guess that's the reason. I guess I hope he'll get a chance to read this, and that he'll know he will be missed.

Students get obscene calls 
By MARK PANKOWSKI News Editor 
Since Christmas Break, six Notre Dame students have received obscene phone calls from a man claiming to be holding their parents hostage. 
Notre Dame Security Detective Anne Schellinger said the caller phones female students and threatens to kill their parents unless the stu­dents do what he tells them. 
The caller, believed to be at least 30 years old, uses "very vile language" and "talks with authority in a monotone voice," Schel­linger said. 
"The calls are extremely obscene in nature," she said. 
Schellinger said the calls are especially worrisome for students because they're un­able to call their parents while talking to the man. 
have no way of knowing whe­ther or not the caller is actu­ally holding their parents hostage, Schellinger said. "A person could have a nervous breakdown," she said. 
Schellinger recommended that students hang up imme­diately upon receiving a call from the man. 
Of the six calls, Schellinger said three were reported Tuesday. She said she did not know whether Saint Mary's students had received any of the calls. 
Schellinger, however, said the caller may be the same man who phoned Saint Mary's students about five months ago claiming to be conducting a National Edu­cational Association survey.

Time to take action for HPC 
By CINDY RAUCKHORST Senior Staff Reporter 
The Hall Presidents' Coun­cil last night formed a special committee to discuss solu­tions to alcohol-related campus problems. 
"We don't have any definite answers, but if we talk about it, maybe we can identify some of the possible solu­tions,'' said HPC Co­chairman Joanie Cahill. "It's time for us to take some kind of action," she said. 
"We're at the point in soci­ety today where many of the most crucial problems can be directly or indirectly related to alcohol," said Vince Willis, vice-president of the Notre Dame chapter of BACCHUS, whc spoke at the meeting. 
BACCHUS, a national or­ganization which promotes the responsible use of alcohol, became officially recognized at the University earlier this year.

workshops used at Saint 
Mary's. 
According to Heller, the 
psychology class "Social and 
Problem Drinking'' has met 
with success in the last two 
years, with a large waiting 
list each semester. The class 
is purposely limited to about 
20 students, however, for 
more personalized instruc­
tion. 
The College also sponsors 
alcohol awareness programs, 
such as the four-day program 
held last November. 
"Each of the information 
sessions were packed during 
that week," Heller said., "So 
we know people are attending 
the programs." 
"We try to provide alcohol 
education and social alterna­
tives to drinking off-campus. 
But then it comes down to an 
individual response," Heller 
said. "We do what we can." 
Heller said she and the class 
presidents plan to write a let­
ter to Saint Mary's students 
encouraging them to partici­
pate in more non-alcoholic al­
ternatives. 
One such alternative, Willis 
said, is Theodore's, which in 
its first few months has at­
tracted almost 1,000 students 
each weekend night. 
"We've got to commend the administration on that. They stepped in on a big problem and did something about it,'' he said, referring to the need for an undergraduate altern­ative to hall parties at the on­set of the alcohol policy.

thing we've learned to work with instead of fighting against. I'm not opposed, however, to reexamining the policy together as students and administrators," Willis said. 
Some BACCHUS ideas re­quire the cooperative effort of students and administrators. But others are geared toward students helping students, Willis said. 
Two such efforts are peer counseling groups and pro­grams to work with area high school students. 
"Often attitudes toward al­cohol are developed early on. We can make a difference es­pecially with younger people," he said. 
A program which has been effective with University stu­dents, Willis said, is the Buzz Bus sponsored by the Hall Presidents' Council and sup­ported by both campus stu­dent governments. 

According to HPC Co­chairman Joanie Cahill, the council plans to extend hours for the bus to now include Thursday as well as the weekend nights. 
The bus, whose route in­cludes stops at the Senior­Alumni Club, The Commons, Bridget McGuire's Filling Station and several off­campus locations, offers rides to students who don't want to drive-or walk home after drinking.

Montanaro said for the last two weeks he has spoken to fac­ulty and students about the problem of plagiarism. 
"There is a general concern among faculty members that students are not aware of the proper ways to do research," he said. 
"I've spoken to people close to me, fellow students, also ig­norant as we were of these (research) techniques, and they did not see (the incident) as an infraction," said Mon­tanaro. 
"As a student leader my con­cern is that two second­semester seniors and a junior are still ignorant as to what would constitute plagiarism and footnoting," he said. "Many students are equally or worse knowledgeable of the subject."

The council agreed to sup­port the BACCHUS-sponsored alcohol awareness mini­week, "Friends Keep Friends Alive," which begins Monday. At last night's meeting, the Student Senate also agreed to support the program. 
"Although the administra­tion has been very helpful in the efforts to increase alcohol awareness on campus, we can't look to the administra­tion to solve the problem," Willis said. "It has to start here with us." 
Members of the newly­formed committee headed by Stanford Hall President Jim Wimbiscus said they probably will draft a letter stating the HPC's position on responsible drinking. 
"Students have got to start realizing that getting drunk is not as cool as everyone thinks,'' said Bob Daley, Fis­her Hall president. 
Sorin Hall President Jim Fallon said the council should examine the effects of the 
three-year-old University al­cohol policy, which he said is turning Notre Dame into a "commuter campus on weekends.'' 
"Before the alcohol policy, I don't remember any of these things happening," Fallon, a senior, said, referring to last semester's three alcohol­related accidents. 
"It seems to me the Univer­sity could work to promote re­sponsible on-campus drinking rather than driving everyone off," he said. 
In other business, the coun­cil is drawing up a proposal to aid in the relocation of stu­dents from Howard, Carroll and Holy Cross halls. The presidents from these three dorms said they plan to meet later in the week, before Friday's deadline for Howard residents to indicate dorm preferences for next year. 
The council voted to draft a letter to the administration voicing recommendations on the long-term plan to house a more balanced ratio of men and women at the University. 
Council members also ap­proved financial support for the Late Nite Olympics, spon­sored by Non-Varsity Ath­letics, and for the Women's Care Center Phone-a-than. The olympics are scheduled for February 13.

Wednesday lunch fasts help world's hungry 
Dear Editor: 

When I got back from break there was a hand painted card addressed to the World Hunger Coalition in the mail­box with a simple message: "Many blessings for the new year." What this symbolized, though, ran much deeper than these words. The card was from a child halfway around the world. She 
'had been given food and education by Caritas Bangladesh, one of the groups the Wednesday Lunch Fast supports. 
The blessings this girl was giving would be incomprehensible to Western Hemisphere Catholics, but there was

! 
another message in the card. It was her 

.~ life, her education, and her sacrifice. 
·I It showed the universality of kindness that runs deeper than cultural differ­
.~ 
ences and distance. ·f This young girl, along with hundreds 
I 
of others throughout the world, was { helped by the sacrifice and generosity .(, of those people in the Wednesday Lunch 
Fast. While this fast may appear to be

~ 
a meaningless effort towards some un­

.( 
foreseeable end, it does make a sub­

.( 
I 
stantial difference in the lives of many

., 
people.

' { 
This past semester 600 fasters raised ~ $5,386 which will be distributed I throughout the world. Our organization 
is presently re-evaluating where the ac­tual money will be donated. In the past, the money went primarily to India. Due to the Green Revolution in that country and the growing needs in parts of Africa and Latin America, our giving patterns are gradually answering those needs. 
Our thanks to all those who fasted this past semester. Please continue your generous and necessary support.

Peace must be sought 
in Iranian war region 
Dear Editor: 
Anyone who has read the article writ­ten by Brian Murray on Reagan's genius in foreign policy-making, and who has some knowledge on what is going on in the Middle East will find that many of the statements made have no ground and are misleading. 
Doonesbury 

First, he states that "if Iraq wins, Russia will have an excuse to invade Iran to secure its borders." Murray has no explanation whatsoever as to why this is so. In any case Iraq has no in­tention of winning the war, that is, of invading Iran. In fact, Iraq has again and again offered to make peace with Iran. On the other hand, I do not see how Iraq, which is smaller in size and largely outnumbered in population by the Iranians, can invade and control Iran. 
Secondly, Murray specifically states that "an Iranian loss could only des­tabilize the Mideast." On the contrary, if Iran wins the war against Iraq, it will destabilize the Persian Gulf states by encouraging the Moslem fanatics, who are growing in number, to control these states. A good example of the on-going activities of these groups is the coup d'etat that failed in Bahrain a few years ago and the attempt on the life of Emir of Kuwait. 
As I see it, it would be in the interest of America to find a way to end the war between Iran and Iraq and to bring peace to the area. This certainly would not materialize by selling weapons to Iran. As a matter of fact, selling weap­ons would help Iran to continue its at­tempt to invade Iraq and at the same time encourage it to carry out more acts of terrorism. Only peace will se­cure the flow of oil to the world and end the suffering and bloodshed of the peoples of Iraq and Iran. 
I suggest that those who attempt to 
analyze such a complicated subject 
have a better perspective of what is 
going on in that part of the world and 
a humanitarian drive for promoting 
peace rather than war.

Student responsibility should replace policy 
The holidays have come and gone and a new year is upon us. For many it is a welcome opportunity to put the tri­umphs and hardships of the fall behind and begin anew. But in our eagerness to move on, there is one lesson which, more than any other, we should not ef­face from our memories. That is the frailty of human life. 
Sean Garrett 
guest column 
Prior to the conclusion of the fall se­mester, drunk driving by Notre Dame students resulted in the deaths of a South Bend man and a Notre Dame junior. It would be an irreconcilable waste of life if we were not to learn from the error of our classmates, so again I bring this problem to your at­tention. 
Whenever there is a death, there are many questions. Concerning the recent deaths associated with the Notre Dame family attributed to drunken driving, the most objective and commonly asked question is how do we, and soci­ety in general, tackle the problem of drunk driving. While it is wonderful the way the Notre Dame community rallies behind a cause generously offering a hand or advice, in this case, I fear we are missing the rn.ark. The solution of­fered will merely mask our problem, failing to destroy its root. That is, we, as members of society, are failing to take responsibility for our actions. 
As printed in the Observer, it is the feeling of many students that the exis­tence of the alcohol policy is the cause of drunk driving. Although I questi9n the motives behind the policy, that is of little relevance here. Drunk driving is a problem for all of society, not for just those of us at Notre Dame. To think that such a problem is restricted to those of us subject to the alcohol policy is naive to the point of being frighten­ing. In turn, the solution to the problem of drunk driving should satisfy the needs of all of society. Sooner than we realize, we will be a part of the world which need not comply with du Lac. The removal of the alcohol policy, then, is not the solution to our problem. Policy or not, alcohol consumption will always take place on campus. The so­lution to the problem of drunk driving 
Garry Trudeau 

will be found only when we stop looking for excuses and hold ourselves account­able for our own actions. 
Policing student parking lots amilor monitoring the gates at both campus entrances in an effort to discourage drunk driving or prevent drunk drivers from continuing on does not address the problem correctly. At that point one has already made the decision to drive while under the influence. Even if one is kept from reaching the roads, little will prevent him from trying again at a later date. No lesson has been learned. The driver has merely failed 
to beat the system. The effort to curt drunk driving must be made before one reaches for his keys. 
An increased presence of the clergy also fails as a solution to our problem. Responsible behavior resulting solely from the everpresent eyes of Big Bro­ther benefits no one. Students should be encouraged to make responsible, ed­ucated decisions as part of a conscious learning experience, not out of fear of reprimand. Those of us who are stu­dents will soon be a more influential part of society and no longer hiding in the shadow of the dome. No longer will a lengthy document inform us of how and when we may consume alcohol. No longer will a hall staff be watching our every move and hounding us about our drinking habits. No longer will we find a gate at every street corner where we must prove our sobriety before passing through. Who then will monitor our every move? 
This is the issue at hand. It is one of personal accountability. It is the only true answer to the question of drunk driving. Whether one is under the in­fluence of alcohol or not, one is respon­sible for his own actions. If we do not hold ourselves accountable, if we do not choose to remain sober behind the wheel, we will continue to suffer the losses of loved ones. 
As we enter the new year I ask you to give serious thought to the value of human life. As the future of society, I urge you to set an example for others. The decision to not drink and drive must be made before the drinking begins. I challenge you to take respon­sibility for your actions. Your life depends on it !

A Corps of hope 
JERRY POHLEN features writer 
For most Notre Dame stu­
dents, Christmas marked the 
completion of their first semes­
ter and the end of finals. To me 
It represented the six month 
mark of my two year commit­
ment as a Peace Corps volunteer 
in Benin. Looking now at the 
changes that have occurred, it 
seems like I must have been here 
longer. 
Less than a year has gone by since I first learned that I had been chosen to go to Benin. With one hand on the telephone receiver I told my placement director my excitement over the assignment and with the other I thumbed through an atlas to de­termine where this place was. Literature on Benin (formerly Dahomey) was scarce, and indi­viduals who had actually visited there were even scarce, so it was hard to get an accurate picture 
·or how I would be living for the next two years. 
I arrived in early July with 11 other trainees for a project to promote fuel efficient, wood bur­ning cook stoves. For the first three months, we were to spend eight hours a day, six days a week learning the skills neces­sary to function somewhat nor­mally In our new jobs and cul­ture. While the majority of this was in French language training, other important topics were cov­ered as well: how to ride, main­tain, and repair a Yamaha moto­cross bike, cultural do's and don'ts, how to kill, clean, and cook a chicken, the proper way to prepare a malaria slide, and of course, how to build a variety of stoves. During training we were also given one week to live with an active volunteercf>n site, and four weeks of living with a local family while commuting to the training site for classes. 
By the time we were sworn in, we were one trainee lighter. To­gether we had chosen our own sites from a list of potential loca­tions given to us by the govern­ment. On the average there would be two volunteers to each of Benin's six provinces. We were issued medical kits, motor­cycles, and mosquito nets, taken out to our villages to be formally introduced, and left there. 
Peace Corps has neither the time, resources, nor desire to ease anyone into their two years of service, but the volunteer is hardly on his own. I was only half finished sweeping out my new home when 20 local children gathered to Inspect the work. By the time I was done, 15 more were called in for a seond optmon. The people were friendly and patient, and ex­tremely forgiving of a beginner's French. In two weeks something of a routine began to emerge. 
Shortly thereafter many of the new volunteers underwent what could loosely be labeled as "cul­ture shock." More accurately, it was the emergence of cultural evaluation, for there are ele­ments of every culture that one finds desirable and not. When you begin your service you are often too fascinated with the new experience to make any type of judgement. For me this change occured at 6:30 on a Sunday morning when my neighbor's son was beating on my front door to ask If I had any odd jobs for him. I did not appreciate It any more than I would have in the states. It Is an important point when one can finally rec­ognize the advantages and dis­advantages of any cultural aspect and then, assuming the good outweighs the bad, one will work out well. 
It was not nearly as big of a hurdle as I had been led to believe. Many people find It more difficult to mentally recover from their first spill on their motor­cycle than their first plate of fish head stew. 
Most of the difficulties one ex­
periences are best overcome 
with a sense of humor and an 
incredible amount of flexibility. 
There is certainly no way to ob­
tain a type of security that comes 
from having a well-defined, 
predictablejob here in the Peace 
Corps. One must foster a faith 
that somehow things will work 
out, and they do by avenues that 
you would least expect. 
This Is far and away Peace 
Corps' greatest asset: its abilty 
to provide the volunteer with an 
endless supply of strange, un­
predictable, and fascinating ex­
periences. Additionally, I do not 
believe there are many jobs for 
the recent college graduate in 
which one can be so In control 
of one's own agenda. You can 
set your own goals and respon­
sibilities far better than at any 
entry-level position with a 
stateside firm. 
But there are sacrifices one must make to join Peace Corps. One must be willing to part with most of the American creature comforts. You must learn to deal with frustration and occasional boredom as things move much slower than most volunteers would like. And one must be able to put all home front personal relationships in their proper prospective; there Is not a iot that can be done to ease the discom­fort of two people who. find It dif­ficult to be thousands of miles apart. You are in this experience with both feet whether you like It or not. 
The opportunity to experience a different culture from the ground level cannot be matched. For me I can see my views on Third World development chang­ing as 1 experience not only dif­ferent ways in which people live, but entirely new ways In which people think. I doubt I will ever 
look at anything with a com­pletely American perspective again. 
Wednesday, January 21, 1987 -page 7 
People are people (even in France) 
One of my friends from home asked me In a recent letter If my host family was "typical" French. I laughed when I read that and smiled even wider when I read her next line, "What Is 'typical' French anyway?" I have been trying to figure that out since I came here. 
Mary Berger 
C'est Ia Vie 

Before I arrived, "typical" French to me was an old man sporting a beret with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth, riding a bike and carrying a loaf of bread and a bottle of wine. I have come to the conclusion that that Image Is very French. 
There are other "typical" French characteristics. 
Taking a three-hour lunch break for a long leisurely meal with one's family Is one example. Most businesses are closed from noon to approximately .3:00 p.m. Restaurants are In business during these hours but then close until 7:00 p.m. rings In the dinner hour. 
The patlsserles-boulangerles one sees and smells everywhere are also an Important part ofmost French people's days. In addition to picking up a fresh dessert or fresh bread, neighbors run Into each oher and chitchat. 
"Typical" French students sometimes carry a heavy class load, frequent cafes, bars and discos during the week. and return home for the weekends. Very few students live In dor­mitories and little,If any, campus life exists. Students board with families or share apartments and find their excitement In town. 
In spite of the differences from American life cited here, French people and the French way of life are not that different from Americans and our mode of living. The language may be different. the food may be different. and other superficial aspects oflife maybe different butday -to-day living, growing 
and experiencing are the same. 
People go to school and to work. they come home to their families and dirty dishes, they watch television and go to movies, they celebrate the birth of a new baby and they mourn the loss of any life. 
Whether they live on one side of the Atlantic or the other, whether they are Catholic or atheistic, whether they have brown hair or blond, people are people. So let's hope It's not always like Depeche Mode puts il "that we should get along so awfully."

Repeat 
continued from page 12 
Everybody has a realistic shot with Rozelle's ideal schedule. Someday, Rozelle will see his version of utopia: all NFL teams finishing at 8-8. He sure has done a great job in elimin­ating dynasties, hasn't he? 
Humbug. 
It's true that dynasties are a thing of the past, but it is not because of Rozelle. It is the na­ture of today's sports. There are a number of reasons for this inability to repeat. Some are easy to understand. Injur­ies and bad breaks are often at fault. Some others are more disturbing, and increasingly prominent, like drug problems, loss of motivation and salary bickering. 
It is evident that with the makeup of today's sports, a team merely has to capture the ever-elusive spark that remarkably brings everything together for that team and carries it to the top of its sport in a given year. The catch is that once a team wins a cham­pionship, it is not allowed to have this magical spark the fol­lowing year. That way no teams can hog this spark for too long, like the Boston Celtics and New York Yankees have been known to do in years past, and ruin the fun for the rest of the teams. 
Coaching genius cannot over­come this system. Neither can an abundance of talent. Not even a great draft, or a cute quarterback can do it. It is in­escapable. 
This formula, not Rozelle, kept the Bears, who were nearing invincible status in the minds of most, from participat­ing in this year's Super Bowl. 
Rozelle's "equalizing" schedule somehow gave the Bears the easiest schedule in the league. Even though the Bears played barely above ade­quate for most of the year, the unending lineup of patsies they were presented kept their record from slipping too much. But the spark had left them, and no matter how much they tried to talk and intimidate to cover it up, they became just another team. What a shame. 
That is what lies ahead for this year's winner also. Don't tell me the Giants are going to be a dynasty. They are just a nicer version of last year's Bears. Not quite as interesting, but much easier to tolerate. Don't tell me Denver, with John Elway, is the team of the fu­ture. We've gone through too many teams that never turn po­tential into production. 
Next year, Denver's try for another dramatic drive to pull out a miraculous playoff vic­tory will hit a snag. Next year, the Giants will not get great games out of Phil Simms at crucial times, and they will fall a notch or two. It may be not be much to look forward to, but these teams will face the same fate as the champs of the recent past. Duane Thomas' quote could be changed for the teams of the '80s to say "If these teams are so great, why are there different teams every year?" 
Sorry Giants and Broncos, no 

matter how good you look this 
Sunday, don't expect to return 
to the big one. Endorse those 
products, write those books 
about your amazing life and 
renegotiate those contracts. 
Get all your fun in this summer 
because there is going to be a 
new king next year. Just ask 
the Bears.

The Notre Dame women's basketball team dominated the boards last night, beating Cleveland State 85-68 to im­prove its record to 4-10 for the year. 
The Irish used a large height advantage to outrebound the Vikings by a whopping 65-36 margin. Notre Dame's all-time record for rebounds in one game is 74. 
"We knew we had the height advantage," said Irish head coach Mary DiStanislao, "and we had to go out and use it."

Irish wrestlers pin down win thanks to AlA forfeitures 

By STEVE MEGARGEE Sports Writer 
After losing three dual meets this year because of matches it had to forfeit, the Notre Dame wrestling team finally got its chance to turn the tables last 
:!' l night against Athletes in Ac­tion. Taking advantage of 12 points handed to Notre Dame by Athletes in Action forfeits, and overcoming some lack­luster performances, the Irish defeated Athletes in Action, 25­23, at the ACC Pit. Despite the win in the exhibi­tion dual meet, Notre Dame head coach Fran McCann was not pleased with the results, as the Irish won only two of the six meets that were not for­feited. "I was hoping to win four of six matches; we ended up losing four of six," said McCann. "We gave a couple of matches away that we could have won. I don't think we wrestled very well." Notre Dame's two winners 
were 118-pound freshman Andy Radenbaugh, by a score of 11-1, and 142-pound sophomore Pat 
Boyd, by  a  score  of 4-2  over  
Arizona State graduate  Tom  
Riley.  .  

"I was extremely pleased by Pat Boyd. He beat one of their better guys who was a good col­lege wrestler," said McCann. 
Injuries to sophomore stand­outs Jerry Durso and Chris Geneser may have partially af­fected Notre Dame's perfor­mance in the other matches, as some wrestlers had to change their weight classes to keep the Irish from forfeiting those matches. 
"We had no continuity out there with the changed lineup, but I'm not going to make any excuses," said McCann. "If people are injured, the others are just going to have to suck it up and take up the slack. Some of the guys don't look hungry enough." 
Whether Durso or Geneser will be able to wrestle against

pulled down 10. Bunek also led all Irish scorers with 22 points, shooting 10-of-16 from the field and two-of -three from the free­throw line. 
"When Heidi decides to turn it on, she does really well,'' said DiStanislao. "She created bas­kets for herself on the fast breaks." 
Last night's game also marked the first appearance of Notre Dame's two newest players to the team, Ellen Mauch, a 5-6 guard from Mineral Wells, Texas, and Kim Garrison, a 6-0 forward from Mill Creek, Wash. Both saw ac­tion last night, although neither scored. 
Neither really had to score on a night when Notre Dame's tough defense forced Cleveland State into shooting a woeful.189 (7-of-37) from the floor in the first half. The Irish led 41-27 at the intermission, and although Cleveland State's outside shooters improved their mark a little in the second half ­scoring over the Irish zone to finish the game at a .278 clip ­it was nowhere near enough. 
While Notre Dame's traditionally-tough match-up zone defense was causing prob­lems for the Vikings, the Irish offense was rolling to a .522 field-goal percentage for the game. Botham connected on 7­of-11 to chip in 15 points to the Irish cause, while guards Mary Gavin and Diondra Toney each added 11 points.

Super Bowl's a BIG, but one-shot, deal 
"If tb.e Super Bowl is such a big deal, then why do they play it every year?" 
Free-spirited running back Duane Thomas of the Dallas Cowboys uttered these words more than 10 years ago, obviously not agreeing with the rest of America that it should be held sacred. That was just one of the many phases that the Super Bowl has gone through in its previous 20 years.

The game began as a novelty, giving the wild and un­predictable AFL a chance to strut its stuff against the hallowed NFL. Tack on a few Roman numerals for aut­henticity and we may start a tradition here. 
In the first two years, it was no match. The Green Bay Packers disposed of Kansas City and Oakland, and with them, all notions that the AFL was equal to the NFL. 
But then some Joe from New York shook up the traditionalists with a promise and a performance that showed that this Super Bowl idea just may cut it after all. 
Things went fine until Minnesota started making regular appearances. They managed to turn every game into a rout or a bore. They did more than just look bad, they managed to make some excellent Miami and Pittsburgh teams look bad with them. 
When the Viking hex finally was eradicated, the Super Bowl put together some classics. The two Pittsburgh­Dallas matchups will forever be Super Bowl highlights. Who can forget Lynn Swann tipping and catching Terry Bradshaw's bomb out of the end zone? Or Jackie Smith dropping Roger Staubach's flip into it? These were the glory days of the Super Bowl. 
But things have changed now, and it is not necessarily good or bad, just different. We still have the trans­afternoon pre-game shows that tell the viewer everything he wants to know about the teams in the game. Twice. We still have the best of each conference playing each other, the same general idea with which the game originated. Football has just fallen into the same cycle as both baseball and basketball. It is very hard to repeat as champion. 
Not since the Steelers won in 1979 and 1980 has a team won consecutive Super Bowls. Most will say this is good. Pete Rozelle wanted parity and parity he is getting, right? Knock down those powerhouses and give the weak sisters a shot at the fame, the glory and the endorsements.
