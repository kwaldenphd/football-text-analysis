Bush speechw-riter returns to Notre Datne

News Writer 
Notre Dame fans who felt they had outgrown the sea of green era and were not quite suited for yellow may now contribute to a new hue in The Shirt's recent years -navy blue. 
A cheering crowd greeted the unveiling of the 2006 version of The Shirt at the Hammes Bookstore Friday afternoon. The Shirt Project president Richard Fox said he was excited to see a positive response to the navy blue color and simple design of The Shirt.

William McGurn left the halls of the West Wing and the Oval Office Friday for the Jordan Auditorium of the Mendoza College of Business. 
. Though miles away from Washington, the chief speech­writer for the White House ­a 1980 Notre Dame graduate -was hardly disoriented as he returned to his alma mater to present his lecture "Future Government and Public Policy." 
A former editorial writer at the Wall Street Journal, McGurn first became a part of the Bush administration in early 2005, and has since become the head of the entire speechwriting team in the White House. 
lie spoke to an audience of students and faculty members on topic ranging from his work in the West Wing, the challenges of speechwriting for the President and the role of the media in the portrayal of news. 
McGurn said for any given speech, there might be approximately 30 people working to produce an aver­age of ten drafts. He said focal and delicate matters such as the war in Iraq generally require even more prepara­tion. 
"We're trying to explain to the American public a very difficult situation and the President's perspective, his voice," McGurn said. 
When asked if he had ever written a speech outlining something contrary to what he believed was correct, McGurn said though there may have been occasions where his per­sonal opinion was different from that of the White House -he would never promote anything he did not consider

Dancers raise record amounts 
By MEGAN O'NEIL Senior StaffWriter 
After nearly 12 hours on their feet, participants in the Riley Hospital for Children dance marathon were begin­ning to look weary Saturday morning. 
Then came the annouQce­ment that made it all worth­while -Saint Mary's had broken the record for the most money raised by any institution's first dance marathon in the state of Indiana. 
The $21,047.42 total roughly doubled to previous record held by Indiana University at Bloomington.

Bishop disapproves of Jenkins' recent choice

School about D'Arcy a particularly timely topic -the pastoral role of the bishop and his relationship to the Catholic university. 
D'Arcy said the Second Vatican Council had a strong impact on the role of the bishop within the Church.

When asked by a student about his relationship with the University administration,

Speaker encourages 
careers in social w-ork 
By ADRIENNE RUFFNER News Writer 

Over two dozen students and faculty members gath­ered in 119 O'Shaughnessy Hall where co-founder and executive director of the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy (LAANE) Madeline Janis-Aparicio spoke about the variety of career options within the field of social work. 
Janis-Aparicio rallied for six years to pass the Los Angeles living wage ordi­nance prior to co-founding LAANE, a social justice 
agency in Southern California. 
"In the face of globaliza­tion, in the increasingly face­less world of capital, how can we make the world a better place," Janis Aparicio said. "Oftentimes poor people are hidden." 
Janis-Aparicio encouraged the crowd to consider a career in social work through the retelling of her own expe­riences in the field.

Leaving out a legend 
The Shirt 200(> was almost one of the 
lwst evnr. 
Ttw 1 00-plus ynars of Tradition­
Thn Shirt's theme-converging with 
thn hope of an unforgettable season to 
comn (my last as 
an undnrgradl on Tim Dougherty
Pat O'Brien's 
timnless prophecy 
in Knutn Hoekne Sports Writer 
Ali-Ameriean: 
"This is thn day 
and you are the tnam." 
Down right inspirational-it literally 
gave mn chills to think of the possibility 
of sneing my life's fulfillment mere 
months away. But like a loss in next 
year's roeord, it had one fatal blemish, 
and The Shirt fell short -shockingly 
so. 
Frank Leahy's .864 winning percent­
ago is Division I college football's second 
highest earner mark, behind only Knute 
Hockne's .881. llis lads' 39 game 
unbnatnn stn~ak (37 -0-2) from 1946­
1950 remains Notre Dame's longest 
over and ninth in Division I history. No 
list of all-time college football's greatnst 
eoaehes that omittnd his name would 
be !'rndibln, mueh less a list of great 
Notre I >ame coaehes. 
The same goes for any shirt that uses the likenesses of Fighting Irish coaches to boast its proud Tradition and refUS!$ to aeknowledge the spndal place Lnahy holds in shaping the very Tradition of Notrn Dame an enduring rnality li1r eaeh pnrson who has ever dreamt of those gold helmel'i shining in the sun. 
Unfortunatnly, The Shirt Committee didn't get the memo. 
Knute Hockne, The Four Horseman, Ara Parsnghian, Lou Holtz, and Charlie Weis unmistakably desnrvnd to be on Thn Shirt. Although the eommitten's "system" (sne httpf/theshirt.nd.edu/cur­rent.htmll has some truth to it, under Thn Shirt 2006's theme of Tradition. that "systmn" omittnd tho absolute most important rnason why those limr r.oaeh­ns bnlong on The Shirt. Knute had three of thnm, Ara two, Lou one, and Weis­wnll, aceording to the committee's interpretation of Hoekne's immortal words at the 1928 Army game, this coming fall should bn his first. Leahy, on the othnr hand, led all Notre Damn eoaehes with li1ur consensus national ehampionships. 
Whiln Hor.kne certainly started the Tradition, Leahy is truly the one who made it perennial, from his dominance in the late 40's to his All-American grand-lad Hyan Leahy ('96), who donned the blue and gold the last time (1993) the Irish could look at them­selves in the mirror and say they were without question the best toam in the eountry. Without Loahy, Notre Dame is the University ol' Chieago on prayer-oids -or Boston Colloge (whom he left to roturn to Notrn Dame) at host. 
The absonee of Loahy's imago on this year's shirt is an absolutely unforgiv­able allhmt to the 87 wins he earned and the 23 consensus Ali-Amerieans ­induding four lleisman winners-he producod in the 11 years or service and Tradition he gave to Our Lady's University. In the end. The Shirt is clos­er to Jack La Motta than The Gipper. It coulda be!m a contender. 
It shouldn't take a giant statue outside of Notrn Dame Stadium to prove my point, but it is there nonetheless. For the millions of fans who walk around the stadium next year staring into the tens of thousands ol' The Shirt's seam­poring around the stadium on game day, their only visibln reminder of Leahy's place in ND Tradition will be that hefty hunk of bronze outside the East Gate. At lea'it Jerry McKenna knew something about Tradition.

truthful and substantiated. 
"The people elected him," he said. "It's the Bush admin­istration, not the McGurn administration." 
He said speechwriters that are acutely opposed to one of the President's stances are generally assign()d to work on an unrelated issue, to avoid a conflict of objectivity. 
McGurn also commented on the role of the media, and the ways in which every network or newspaper bias deters from the message he and the President are trying to evoke. 
"In many cases, the report­ing may be slanted not con­sciously or on purpose, but rather due to ignorance and a lack of knowledge of all the facts," McGurn said. "Sometimes the media isn't even aware of the existence of a counterargument to what they are saying." 
He also expresse<;l frustra­tion in the way that television and newspapers highlight drama and controversy, some­times neglecting comprehen­sive and responsible journal­ism. 
"The President may be delivering an important speech on Medicare but if someone yells out something from the back, that becomes the news," McGurn said. "From the inside that is really frustrating but we understand the media needs the drama, sometimes over substance, to sell more." 
But sensationalist reporters are not the biggest problem McGurn and his team of writ­ers face every day at work. Instead it's the challenge of striking a balance between informative and clear speech­es. 

"A speech can't be too dense with facts, or else people won't follow," he said. 
All bases must be covered, though, and all relevant points must be addressed, he said. Knowing presidential speeches are subject to the scrutiny of the media and his­tory, omitting complicated information is also not an option. 
McGurn said even after the efforts of the speechwriting team, President Bush makes the final decision by approv­ing or rejecting a speech. 
lligher-ranking government officials often check content and interpretation of policy within the text. McGurn said. But it is Bush who goes gives final approval to all of his public oratory. 
He said Bush consistently reminds his speechwriting team of his enrollment within an American oratory during his time in Yale University and reminds his speechwriting team of that advantage on a regular basis. 
McGurn said the President likes to adhere to the method­ology and rhythm he learned in such course. 
The speechwriters are always busy looking at the next of fifteen drafts before their speech airs throughout the world, he said.

Thn money raised at the event,

never denies care to a patient, 
n~ceives no state funding and is 
entirely dependent on corporate 
and private donations. 
"One out of' every two children 
that walk into the doors of the

The number of universities 
and colleges who put on dance 
marathons has grown to 14, 
Cain said. While the ba<>ic struc­
ture of the event is sHt, Cain 
works with studP.nt leaders to 
develop programs that best fit 
their schools. 
Cain described the Saint 
Mary's dance marathon, which 
was largely spearheaded by the 
frnshrnan dass, a<> "impressive." 
The partieipants were enter­tained by dancing group TroopND, a cappella singers The Undertones, Saint Mary's cheer­leaders and the Notre Dame band Speedway. Further, dancers kept busy playing improvised games of volleyball and basketball, as well as writ­ing cards to patient<> at Hiley. 
The morale committee kept students energized by teaching tlwm a "morale dance" in small increments throughout the evening. The groups then per­li~rmed the dance in its entirety at the fmd of' the 12 hours. 
i\ local family who personally benefited from the medical serv­ices ofl'ernd by Hiley was present to share their story with the stu­dents . 
. Johnson said 140 of the 190 registered studenl<> showed up to dance Friday night. They were joined by 50 marathon commit­tee members. There were stu­dents who left the event, Johnson said, but she estimated there were still 120 dancers on the floor at the closing ceremony. 
While the first dance marathon exceeded all expectations, .Johnson said, there is always room lor improvement. 
She said she hopes to confine future events to one condensed arna in order to keep the group united, noting that at any given time Friday night there were 25 people on the second level of the

"In th11 future I would like to have a few hundred dances stay the wholo time," Johnson said. 
Organizer /\my Dardinger said it was dillicult to eonvince people to return to the dance floor after they were permitted to sit briefly in order to eat. ­
"For the first year, I think the marathon ran smoothly," Dardinger said. "We followed the schedule almost exactly until about thrne in the morning, then we started some games. i\ little after thrnn. the dancers realized that they were actually going to make it until 6, so the energy level picked up again."

"[I likel the color [andl the design," Petros said. "I think the Four Horsemen and the coaches ... stand out in people's minds ­the tradition. Everything about it is great." 
Fox said he anticipated a posi­tive student reaction to the shirt because of the simplicity of its design and its historical signifi­cance. 
"Everything on there is instant­ly recognizable by students," Fox said. 
The Shirt Project website said the design of this year's The Shirt attempts to link the successes of past Notre Dame football eras to the potential of the current team. The general student consensus seems to favor this year's shirt over last year's tor the design and the color. 

Freshman Hebecca Svenson wa<> at the bookstore on Friday to buy The Shirt. Svenson called The Shirt dassy and said she was relieved it was not yellow again like last year's The Shirt. 
"It's a lot nicer than la<>t year," Svenson said. "I like the color." 
Graduate student Yinlu Chen was al<>o at the bookstore Friday to buy The Shirt, but said she liked last year's yellow color bet­ter than the navy blue of this year's shirt.

Insurgents kill three soldiers 
BAGHDAD -Insurgents killed three American soldiers in the Baghdad area Sunday and fired mortars near the Defense Ministry in a spree of violence that killed at least 27 Iraqis as politicians began work on forming a new government. 
The largest Sunni Arab party raised new allngations of sectarian killings -one of the most urgent issw~s facing the new leader­ship. 
U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad said the next government must decommission sectarian militias and integrate them into the national armed forces, warning that the armed groups represent the "infrastructure for civil war. 
Protesters burn effigy of king 
KATMANDU, Nepal -The protesters crowding a Katmandu road in a whistling, seething mass Sunday were dearly unified in their quest to force Nepal's king from power. 
They roared their approval as a straw effigy of King Gyanendra was burned. They cheered demonstrators who dared to confront police. They chanted for a return of democracy and an end to royal rule. 
Two weeks of demonstrations have regular­ly brought tens of thousands into the streets around Katmandu. and smaller crowds in other cities across this Himalayan nation, but under that surface unity is a deeply fractured political scene. . 
Politicians ousted when the king seized absolute control in February 2005 want back in power with a restored parliament, but are widely despised for ineffectiveness and cor­ruption. Maoist rebels want to end genera­tions of feudal-style rule, but have a long his­tory of brutality in areas under their control.

Bush urges quick formation in Iraq 
TWENTYNINE PALMS, Calif. President Bush on Sunday called Iraq's top leaders to congratulate them on breaking a political impasse and urge the quick formation of a coalition govern­ment. 
Bush said he told President Jalal Talabani, Prime Minister-designate Jawad al-Maliki and parliament Speaker Mahmoud al-Mashhadani that they have a duty to improve the lives of Iraqis, defeat the insurgency and unite the country. 
White House spokesman Scott McClellan told reporters that Bush encouraged the leaders, especially al-Maliki, to act quick­ly and pick a Cabinet. 
FEMA requests return of funds 
BEAUMONT, Texas -The federal gov­ernment is asking 625 people in Texas to pay back a total of $1.26 million in recov­ery aid they shouldn't have received after Hurricane Rita. 
Texas families received more than $592 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency after the September storm. 
Most of the money FEMA wants -$1.14 million -was incorrectly paid for damage to homes that were not the owners' pri­mary residences, agency spokeswoman Hannah Viek said. Damages to secondary residences are ineligible for FEMA money.

WASHINGTON -Finance ministers endorsed propos­als Sunday intended to make it easier for interna­tional lending institutions to deal with soaring oil prices, trade gaps and other prob­lems that threaten to derail growth. 
The policy-setting com­mittees for the 184-nation International Monetary Fund and the World Bank told the World Bank to attack corruption and directed the IMF to explore ways to give tougher policy advice to member countries in such areas as budget deficits and currency val­ues. 
Oil prices, now at a record $75-plus per barrel, were among the develop­ments causing officials from Europe, the United States and other countries at the institutions' weekend meetings to worry about the prospects for long-term growth. 
With U.S. pump prices already above $3 per gallon in some places, the White House is under pressure to act. On Sunday, for exam­ple, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee said the government should consider a tax on oil com­panies if they make exces­sive profits. 
In talks that wrapped up Sunday, ministers resolved a dispute over anti-corrup­tion efforts by pledging "to improve governance in all countries." 
Some European nations complained that the World Bank's president, Paul Wolfowitz, was emphasiz­ing the fight against cor­ruption at the expense of poverty reduction. The for­mer top Pentagon official began his five-year term in June. 
Wolfowitz told a closing news conference that he was satisfied with how the debate was resolved. 
"These are complex and nuanced issu.es, but we must develop a common approach if we want to deliver results for the poor," he said. "It is an effort that will take some time." 


The Bush administration says it's critical to crack down on corruption so that the U.S. is assured its dol­lars supporting the bank are not wasted. 
"With billions of people still living in destitute con­ditions, we cannot rest," Treasury Secretary John Snow said. "We must do more to make these ideas and programs even more productive, beneficial and effective." 
On the issue of oil, the world's seven wealthiest industrial countries met Friday night with three big oil-producing countries ­Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United Arab Emirates -to explore ways to improve data about produc­tion and reserves to give oil markets better information. The G-7 countries also called for increased invest­ment in exploration and refinery capacity to boost supplies. 
The meetings went ahead without any of the large­scale demonstrations that in years past have filled the streets around the IMF and World Bank headquarters, a few blocks from the White House. This year's events were on a small scale; one man among a group of 30 protesters was arrested Saturday and charged with carrying a stun gun. 
Anti-poverty activists expressed disappointment that more was not accom­plished toward meeting the U.N.-sanctioned goal of cut­ting poverty in half by 2015. 
"By their next meeting, we want to see real change -not just pocket change ­for the 100 million poor children out of school," said Max Lawson, policy adviser for Oxfam International. 
Getting the go-ahead at these meetings was what supporters hope will prove to be a broad overhaul of IMF operations. Proposals include giving rapidly growing economies such as China, South Korea and Mexico greater voting power. 
AFGHANISTAN 


Troops face increased resistance 
Associated Press 
KABUL -Britain's defense sec­retary warned on Sunday that any let up on militants could see the toppled Taliban regime and al­Qaida regain power in Afghanistan. 
As John Reid made his call dur­ing a visit to Kabul, gunbattles elsewhere killed five people and rockets slammed into a U.S.-run base in the south. 
The warning followed a spike in bombings and shootings targeting coalition troops, Afghan forces 

and often ordinary locals as the Taliban apparently have made good on threats to increase attacks during the warmer spring and summer months. 
""The greatest danger of all for the people of Afghanistan and the people of the United Kingdom would be if Afghanistan ever again came under the rule of a Taliban regime prepared to protect al­Qaida or terrorist groups," Reid told reporters in the capital. 
Spiraling violence is a growing concern for nations contributing troops to a force operating here 
under a NATO mandate. The force is to rise from its current 10,000 soldiers to about 21,000 by November as it gradually assumes command of all international troops in Afghanistan. 
Some 6,000 mainly British, Canadian and Dutch soldiers have started deploying in the remote tribal-dominated southern region 
At least 18,000 U.S. soldiers are in Afghanistan -more than four years after the U.S.-led invasion toppled the hard-line Taliban regime for hosting al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden.

The group wanted to seek revenge for being picked on, he said. 
The story in North Pole broke two days after five Kansas teenagers were arrested on sus­picion of planning a shooting rampage at their high school last Thursday, the seventh anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre in Colorado. 
"Our investigation does not reveal any connection to any of these other school tragedies," Lindhag said. "I think it's more coincidental than anything." 
In Riverton, Kan., a communi­ty of about 600 people in south­east Kansas, near the Oklahoma and Missouri borders, prom went on as planned Saturday. 
"Our school is not big on can­celing things," said Daniel Koucky, a senior at Riverton High School. "We haven't had a

Sheriffs deputies found guns, ammunition, knives and coded messages in the bedroom of one suspect and documents about firearms and references to Armageddon in two suspects' school lockers. 
A bond hearing for the sus­pects-ages 16 to 18 -was set for Monday afternoon. The prosecutor said he would soon determine whether to file crimi­nal charges.

"There was someone on that platform whose position on unborn life was unacceptable to me," D'Arcy said. "The church's position is mine. I didn't want the young people to think that was OK ... If the bishop is there, that is what it means." 
Throughout the disagreement. D'Arcy said he retained his respect for the University. 
"I never bashed Notrn Dame ­becausn it is too elegant a place to do that." he said. "I have groat afl'ection and love for this place." 
Though he spoke out against Jenkins' decision not to ban the "Monologues," D'Arcy advised students to read the play and become informed about the sur­rounding issues. 
lie said his actions and deci­sions have been based on the late Pope .John Paul ll's definition of academic freedom. The Catholic teaching states that members of a university should be treated with academic fmedom so long as the rights of the individual members are maintairwd, D'Arey said. 
"In all this 10 week debate did you ever heard that definition?" he said. "Did you ever hear it on this wonderful campus?" 
The students present ques­tioned the Bishop about how they should express their dissatisfac­tion with Jenkins' decision to allow the continued performance of the "Monologues" and their concern that dorm Masses are celebrated improperly. 
D'Arcy rejected a student's suggestion that Notre Dame was no long1~r a strietly Catholic uni­versity. 
"I think among the major uni­versities it is by far the most Catholic," he said. "I have great affection for it, and so does [Popel Benedict [XVII."

The Feb. 2005 campus visit of "Vagina Monologues" playwright Eve Ensler was "especially painful" to him, D'Arcy said.

"Who was constricting aea­demic freedom that time," he said.

IN BRIEF 
Merck responsible· for Vioxx death 
HIO GHANDE CITY, Texas -A state jury found Merck & Co. liable Friday for the death of a 71-year-old man who had a fatal heart attack within a month of taking its since-with­drawn painkiller Vioxx and ordered the com­pany to pay $32 million. Merck said it would appeal. 
The damage award will likely be reduced because of a state law capping punitive dam­ages. 
The jury of 10 men and two women deliber~ ated for about seven hours over two days before returning the verdict in favor of the family of Leone! Garza, who had suffered from heart disease for more than 20 years and had taken Vioxx for less than a month. 
The company was ordered to pay $7 million in non-economic compensatory d~mages and $25 million in punitive damages. 
Crude-oil prices continue to rise 
NEW YOHK -Crude-oil prices broke through $75 a barrel to hit a new record Friday, fueled by concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions and tight U.S. gasoline supplies. 
Prices at the pump also kept rising, with the average price of a gallon of unleaded regular gasoline at $2.855, up 3 cents from a day ear­lier and more than 60 cents higher than a year ago, according to AAA's daily fuel gauge report. 
Crude prices, which are more than 40 per­cent higher than a year ago, have risen 8.4 percent from Thursday's closing price -the biggest weeklong jump since the week ended June 17, 2005, when crude futures rose 9 per­cent.

Eli Lilly involved in racism suit 
Lawsuit alleges discriminatory pay rates on behalf of 1,000 black employees 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -A racial discrimination law­suit alleges Eli Lilly & Co. paid black employees less than their white peers, passed them over for pro­motions and subjected them to harassment such as epithets. 
The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court also claims a Lilly human resources staffer told a complaining female employee that her managers on the manufac­turing side considered her previous corporate supervi­sors to be too accepting of blacks and that they were no longer in a position to address her concerns. 
"It's like the plantation, unfortunately, at the manu­facturing site. It's blatant discrimination,'" Cassandra Welch said Friday, the day after the lawsuit was filed. Lilly fired her in mid-2004 for allegedly falsifying e­mails in an unrelated financial dispute with another employee of the Indianapolis-based drug company.

"I say that this war is the joint responsibility or the peo­ple and the governments. While the war eontinues, the people renew their allegiance to their rulers and politicians and con­tinue to send their sons to our eountries to fight us," bin Laden said. 
In his last message, bin Laden ofl'ered the United States a long-term truce but warned that al-Qaida soon would launch a fresh attack on American soil. But no new attacks on the United States have occurred. 
In the Sunday broadcast, bin Laden called for a global Muslim boycott of' American goods similar to the recent ban on Danish products after the publieation of' caricatures of Islam's Prophet Muhammad that outraged the Muslim world.

Wal-Mart practices under fire 
Company engages in battle with politicians aiming to change its policies 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -There is no candidate. There are no ballots. There won't be an Election Day. And yet it may be the hottest, highest-stakes political contest in America today. 
It's the campaign against Wal­Mart. 
i\ year-old efl'ort to force the nation's No. 1 private employer to change its business practices has evolved into a Washington­style brawl: tens of millions of dollars spent by Hepublican and Democratic political consultants using polling, micro-targeting, ads, e-mails, direct mail, grass­roots organizing and strategic methods to drag the company into the public square and try to shame them into change. 
Both groups have hammered the world's largest retailer about its wages, health insurance, treatment of workers and pro­clivity for buying non-U.S. goods. Wal-Mart has responded with counterattacks and a multimil­lion-dollar public campaign to polish its image. 
On both sides are some of the best political strategists money can buy. 
WakeUpWalMart.com is run by Paul Blank, political director for Howard Dean's 2004 Democratic presidential campaign, and Chris Kofinis, a former political professor

"Our opponents have organ­ized the likes of a political cam­paign against us," said Bob McAdam, vice president of cor­porate affairs at Wal-Mart. "It would be nonsense for us not to respond in a similar fashion." 
Wal-Mart's main opponents are the Service Employees International Union, which start­ed Wal-Mart Watch, and the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which funds a separate cam­paign called WakeUpWa!Mart.com

too-cozy relationship with China." 
Under fire, Wal-Mart turned to Reagan adviser Michael Deaver, Bush-Cheney political director Terry Nelson and several Democrats, among them civil rights leader Andrew Young and campaign strategist Leslie Dach. 
Talk about odd bedfellows: Democrats working for Wal-Mart against organized labor. 
"We were being attacked. We wanted to hire people who knew how to respond," said Wal-Mart's McAdam, formerly a GOP aide on Capitol Hill and political strate­gist for the tobacco industry. 
WakeUpWalMart.com claims 212,000 supporters who can be mobilized with a computer stroke to recruit members and participate in media events designed to shine a bad light on the Bentonville, Ark., company. 
The group also passes out UFCW-sponsored workers' rights material outside Wal-Mart stores. 
A goal of the UFCW is to show Wal-Mart's 1.3 million U.S. employees -many of whom have a low opinion of unions or fear retribution if they organize -that unionized labor can change their workplace and lives 
for the better.

IRAQ 
Marines not standing still in city 
Associated Press 
RAMADI-Weapons locked, loaded and ready, a U.S. Marine platoon runs through this troubled Iraqi city's war-wrecked streets, hurling yellow, gray and violet smoke grenades to shroud their path. 
Pausing only to train gunbarrels around corners or scan rooftops for insurgents, they bound across desolate roads lined with broken glass and charred cars -and start running again. 
Stancling still is rarely an option in this insurgent-plagued metrop­olis beset by roadside bombs, rocket fire and, Marines here say, the worst sniper threat on the planet. 
"Every time we go out, we run," said 2nd Lt. Brian Wilson. a 24­year-old platoon commander from Columbia, S.C. "If you stand still, you WILL get shot at." 
And most of the time, Marines shoot back. 
Buildings around Government Center, the Marine-defended headquarters of provincial gov­ernment. offer stark evidence of fighting between insurgents and 
U.S. forces in downtown Ramacli, a city 70 miles west of Baghdad in the heart of the Sunni Arab-domi­nated insurgency. 
Some buildings have been blown away by air strikes, their walls ripped open, their twisted floors collapsed. Others, inclucling a small mosque and il<> tank-blast­ed minaret, are riddled with rock­et and bullet impacts. Plastic awnings over shopfronts are shredded. Power lines hang down along sidewalks. 
Marines patrolling this city on foot don't like to stay exposed too long, preferring instead to blow front gate locks off private homes with special shotgun shells to take temporary cover in walled court­yards before moving on. They don't knock first -there is no time. 
On one recent sweep, U.S. and Iraqi infantrymen climbed over walls between houses instead of risking the streets outside. 
"We try to stay mobile so snipers can't aim in on us," said 1st Lt. Carlos Goetz, a 29-year-old Miami native. "If we walk, then it gives them more time to aim in on your head." 
Running around with 60 to 80 pounds of gear, the Marines' pace is more of a quick jog. 
The urban environment of walled villa rooftops and four-to five-story windowed buildings keeps Marines edgy. 
"You try to take cover wherever you can, but it just feels like some­one's always watching you. It real­ly messes with your head," said Cpl. Jason Hunt ofWellsville, N.Y 
"You look for dark windows, tiny holes anywhere," the 24­year-old said. "They could be sit­ting back on a bench with a scope and a barrel -they see you, but you can't see them." 
Troops from the 3rd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment aggressively patrol the blown-out district around Government Center at all hours -conducting raids and sweeps during the hazy, gritty heat of the day, and in the quiet of night when moonlight casts build­ings and villas in blue hues. 
Marines say the patrols have disrupted insurgent operations. But the guerrillas operating in small teams are relentless, firing rockets, mortars and machine guns daily at Government Center, 
U.S. bases and fortified observa­tion posts. Sometimes they attack the same targets several times a day. 
Goetz said Marines patrol hop­ing to bring insurgents out into the open, where they are little match for the overwhelming U.S. firepower. 

TURKEY 
Orthodox Christians celebrate Easter Sunday 

Associated Press 
ISTANBUL Orthodox Christians around the world cel­ebrated Easter Sunday, wor­shipping at candlelit services from Russia to Ethiopia before gathering families for outdoor feasts. 
Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, spiritual leader of 200 million Orthodox Christians, led prayers on Easter eve in the crowded Church of St. George in Istanbul. A flame brought from the site of Jesus' grave in Jerusalem was passed from candle to candle. 
The patriarch called for peace, telling the congregation, "We call for an end to the killing of one another, and we denounce the violence and fanaticism that threatens life." 
In Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulcher, hundreds of Orthodox Christians gathered for Mass. Candles glowed around the tomb where many Christians believe Jesus was buried, and hymns filled the cavernous grotto-like church. 
Orthodox Christians use a dif­ferent calendar from Roman Catholics and Protestants, so their celebration of Easter usu­ally falls on a different date from the rest of Christianity and always after the Jewish festival of Passover. Coptic Christians in Egypt and some 25 million Ethiopian Christians also cele­brated Easter on Sunday. 
At the Vatican, Pope Benedict XVI joined Orthodox religious leaders' calls for peace and offered prayers for victims of flooding along the Danube River. 
"In the joyous atmosphere of these days, I cannot not recall that many of these peoples, in Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria, are suffering because of the flooding," he said, speaking from his window overlooking St. Peter's Square to tens of thou­sands of pilgrims. 
The disaster has forced thou­sands from their homes yet Orthodox Christians still man­aged to celebrate Easter. Romanian refugees held servic­es outdoors in the flood-stricken village of Rast, where priests used an improvised altar in an open tent. 
Similar services in other flooded Eastern European vil­lages were accompanied by fire­works and even celebratory gunfire. 
Easter celebrations, a blend religious and local traditions, typically include a spit-roast lamb dinner and a display of hard-boiled eggs, dyed red to symbolize the blood of Christ. 
In Cyprus, youths around the island lit traditional Easter bon­fires to burn effigies of Judas ­the disciple thought to have betrayed Jesus. 
In Greece, Orthodox leader Archbishop Christodoulos said the church remains a source of defiance against the negative effects of globalization and dom­inance of major world powers. 
"The church is our hope for the future," Christodoulos said in his Easter message. "It is the living and new resistance against the murderous world order which throws every inde­pendent voice, every protest of 
conscience  and  reasonable  
opposition  into  the  meat  
grinder."  

Christodoulos' remarks were seen in part as a reference to the United States, ahead of demonstrations planned this week by anti-globalization and other groups against a visit by 
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. 
Political and religious leaders in predominantly Orthodox countries used Easter messages to issue appeals for national unity. 
At Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Savior, President Vladimir Putin attended Easter prayers led by Patriarch Alexy II. 
"I heartily congratulate Orthodox Christians and all citi­zens of Russia celebrating Christ's resurrection. Easter gives millions of Russians joy and hope," Putin said. 
Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko said he hoped mod­eration would prevail in tough negotiations to form a governing coalition as well deep division between the nation's Ukrainian­speaking, nationalistic west and pro-Moscow, Hussian-speaking east. 
"God will give us wisdom and lead us down the correct path," he said.

Cities with few collego graduates have a hard tinle generating good­paying jobs. That, in turn, makes it hard to attract more college gradu­ates, said Richard Vedder, an eeo­nomi(:s professor at Ohio University. 
Cities such as Newark, N.J.; Detroit and Cleveland have relative­ly few college graduates, which helps explain why they are strug­gling to recover from the decline of 
U.S. manufacturing, Vedder said. 
Among the three, Oeveland had tim largest share of eollege gradu­ates in 2004, 14 pereent of those 25 and older. 
"Society is paying people more for their brains than for their brawn," Vedder said. "The nerds and the wimps and the geeks are ruling the world." 
College graduates made about two-thirds more money than high school graduates in 2004, accord­ing to the Census Bureau. The median income -the point at which half make more and half make less -for adults wiili bache­lor's degrees was $42,404. lt was $25,360 for high school graduates. 
AdulL'i who did not graduate high school had a median income of $18,144. 
Many cities wiili a lot of college graduates also have expensive homes, even with the softening real estate market. 
San Francisco was the costliest in 2004, with a median home value of $662,000, according to census data. That was more than four times the national median of $151,000. 
Cities that want to increase their pool of skilled labor need to foster an environment that wekomes out­siders, including inlmigrants and people from elsewhere in the U.S., said Richard Florida, professor of public policy at George Mason University. 

"You know what they say, they say we want our kids baek. We want them to stop leaving," Florida said, paraphrasing leaders of many depressed cities. "What iliey don't say is that they want other people's kids to move there." 
Most big cities are strapped with struggling publie sehools and need to attract ouL'iiders to improve edu­cation levels an10ng adult'i. It's pos­sible, in part because unmarried college graduates are the most mobile demographic group, according to census data. 
"Cities have realized that they can attract edueated people and they don't need good schools to do it," said Florida, who wrote the book, "The Rise of the Creative Oass." 
But cities need good schools to keep people from fleeing to the sub­urbs once they beeome parents, said William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution in Washington. 
Frey pointed to Washington, a city witi1 lagging public schooL<; but impressive education leveL<; among adulL'i. 
"D.C. is like a revolving door," Frey said. "These young people move in and then they move out when they want to have kids." 
But Wankel, the Tennessee native, said she has no plans to leave Washington. She said she would miss the restaurant<;, muse­UlllS and convenient public trans­portation, what she calls "eiviliza­tion." 
"I had always been a small town girl, and I didn't know if I could adjust to living in a big city," Wankel said. "Now, I don't want to go baek to the suburbs." 
IU tnusic students die in crash 
Associated Press 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. Georgina II. Joshi had studied at the Hoyal College of Music in London and sung in Wales. Zachary J. Novak shared his love of music with children as a church choir direetor. 
Joshi, Novak and three fellow graduate students from Indiana University's music school died late Thursday when the small plane Joshi wa'i piloting cra'ihed near the Monroe County Airport. 
"This is a deva'itating loss that is deeply fi~lt on the Bloomington campus," IU President Adam llnrbcrt said at a news confer­ence Friday afternoon. 
Investigators from the Fnderal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board were searching for answers about what caused the single-engine Cessna to crash in heavy fi-1g. But without a cockpit recorder and with no distress call from tho plane, answers wnrn fi~w Friday. 
Ed Malinowski, an air safety investigator for the NTSB, said the probe would look at the plane, the pilot and the weather. A preliminary report could be available within a week, but the final report could take a year or more, he said. 
The students were identified as Joshi, 24, of South Bend; Novak. 25. of Anderson; Robert Clayton Samnls, 24, of Medina, Ohio; Garth A. Eppley, 25, of Wabash, Ind.; and Chris Bates Carducci, 27, of Monroe, Mich. 
They were returning from a rehearsal for a community eon­cert in West Lafayette, about 90 miles to the north, when the plane disappeared from radar about 11:40 p.m. Thursday. 
Emergency crews found the badly damaged craft more than four hours later, upside down in dense woods just south of the airport a couple miles west of Bloomington. The main fuselage appeared to be in one pieee, and the landing gear was still attached, but the wings were damaged. 
Malinowski said the plane hit nose-first. Nicole Meyer of the Monroe County coroner's office said all five students died instantly. 
Autopsies were scheduled Friday and Saturday. 
Several 911 callers had described "the spit and sputter­ing of an airplane" and the sound of "extreme acceleration unusual for a plane coming in for a landing," said Mike Cornman, deputy lire chief in Van Buren Township. Some reported hearing a loud boom. 
Malinowski said visibility was about a mile at the time. 
Investigators said they did not immediately know how much flying experience Joshi had. 
The plane was registered to Yatish Air in South Bend. A phone number to Yatish Air could not be found. 
The crash came as the IU campus prepared to celebrate the Little 500 men's and women's bicycle races, a two­day event that draws thousands to Bloomington for racing and parties. 
As students cried and con­soled one another at the music school's building, rock music echoed from the Delta Upsilon fraternity house across the street, where students played volleyball and threw Frisbees. 
"It's kind of put a strain on the party. I know a lot of students have a heavy heart about now," said Ryan Pappas, a 19-year-old freshman from Cincinnati, as he returned to the party. 
The music school, with about 1,600 students, is one of the largest in the nation, with pro­grams in opera, jazz, orchestral music and early music. Still, Herbert said, it has "a family kind of environment." 
"Students are taking it very hard," he said. 
Sam Page, a 19-year-o.ld freshman from Columbus, Ohio, majoring in performance bas­soon, agreed. 
"To lose one student, let alone live, is such a tragedy. It will have a big inlpact on all of us," Page said. 
A memorial service was planned Friday evening at First United Methodist Church, where Novak was worship coordinator and directed the Wesley choir and ehildren's choir. Church members put up silver-framed photo of Novak on table with three white roses as a photo col­lage of him stood nearby. 
"Zach was just a beautiful person, more full of life than anyone I know," associate pas­tor Jimmy Moore said. 




Big oil companies now recruiting on campuses 
Associated Press 
AUSTIN, Texas-University of Texas senior Thuan Phan switehed majors from computer science to geological sciences, fig­uring the field trips would make it more fun. Now his degree turns out to be lucrative, too. 
"Big Oil" has been doing some big recruiting on U.S. campuses this year -as have many small­er companies in the petroleum and natural gas business. The combination of high priees, an aging work force

For job-hunters, 2006 is a good time to graduate from eollege. The National Association of Colleges and Employers' most recent survey found companies planning 14.5 percent more on­campus hiring this year; a recent salary survey showed offers up significantly across a range of fields.

After all, rumor has it that Scientology was ereated by its founder, L. Ron Hubbard, as a joke after he bet a friend that he could start and popularize his own religion as a money-making scheme. 
Sure, Scientology Web sites claim that their religion is on par with the Eastern religions that seek salvation and unity with God through personal enlightenment. But on the flip side, many have accused it of being run like a commercial business (unlike Catholicism, of course), in which members are charged for each of the religious services performed by the church. Plus, the Church of Scientology itself is rumored to have real estate holdings valued in the bil­lions of dollars (unlike Catholicism, of course). 
Beyond these financial practices, though, there are some tenets of Scientology that make the rumor about Hubbard's facetious formation of the church sound highly plausible. For instance, the central practice of

Ounces 

Scientology-auditing-requires a counselor to measure the electrieal resistance running through a practi­tioner while he holds onto metal objects as a means of quantifying dis­turbances in his spirit. Also, to those who obtain a certain level of clarity in Scientology, Hubbard's teachings promise a number of supernatural abilities, inc! uding telekinesis, immor­tality and even immunity from the common cold. 
Best of all, though, Scientologists supposedly believe that our emotional and physical problems emerged 75 million years ago, when an evil galac­tic warlord named Xenu attempted to fight interplanetary overpopulation by dumping trillions of bodies into Earth's volcanoes. Eventually, their radioactive souls attached themselves to the spirits of human beings­henee the plethora of modern mental disorders. 
So no wonder Tom Cruise had the munehies for his tyke's placenta. His soul was actually locked in battle with the tortured spirit of a 75 million­year-old alien! Give the guy a break. 
Well, I was going to do just that, and in my quest to achieve true solidarity with the guy who had me from hello in "Jerry Maguire" and the girl who stole my heart while making out to Sixpence None the Hieber songs on "Dawson's Creek," yesterday morning I snuck into the Founding Church of Scientology of Washington, DC. 
Upon entering, I was not only struck by the lavishness of the chapel which held the Sunday service -mahogany walls and bookshelves, beautiful stained glass covered in esoteric Scientology symbols, a large portrait of the deific Hubbard and comfortable wicker chairs that could have doubled as patio furniture-but also the size of the place. While the overall building was a palatial mansion, only 25 to 30 people could even fit into the tiny chapel itself. 
We began the service by reciting a creed, and then followed that with some readings from a massive collec­tion of Hubbard's writings. To be hon­est, I was pleasantly surprised by the scriptural part of the service­Hubbard's teachings did seem to of'l'nr thoughtful insights on how to deansn one's soul and become a psychosomat­ically sound individual. 
But thnn things just got weird. 
The minister dragged out an E­Meter -a laptop-sized electromag­netic sensor that measures an individ­ual's stress levels -and proceeded to test it out on a member of the congre­gation. Then, the doors to the chapel were ominously slammed shut as the lights were dimmed, and I grabbed my wicker chair expecting my soul to be sucked out by an alien warlord with an E-Meter. 
Instead, we ended the service with an activity called group processing, in which those of us in the congregation proceeded to roll our necks, nod our heads, find the 11oor, envision the walls, find our heads and bodies and shout words like "Okay!" and "Here!" back and .forth with the minister. I lit­erally felt like I was a four-year-old with ADD playing Simon Says with my psychiatrist and therefore had no desire to stick around after the service to sign up for the extremely expensive weekday processing sessions. 
Still, with absolutely no mention of aliens, silent births or Tom Cruise, I have to admit I was a little disappoint­ed with the whole Scientology experi­ence -except for the part where I got to watch middle-aged men and women shouting things like, "My head is a part of my body! My body is in the chair! The chair is on the floor!" 
If L. Hon Hubbard really did start this whole thing as a lucrative practi­cal joke, then it's safe to say the joke was on these idiots.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 



Closing statement response 
In his response to University President Father John Jenkins' closing statement, Hev. John J. Coughlin, 
O.F.M. argues that "the University needs to hire more devout Catholic pro­fessors who cherish the Catholic approach to reason and are also top notch in their respective academic dis­ciplines" ("A response to Father Jenkins," April 20). I wonder if this is absolutely necessary since for the most part Catholic reason does not seem to enter classroom discussion, outside of possibly Theology, and Philosophy ­never once in my courses in political science did I hear any mention of reli­gion or get a Catholic perspective on issues, and I would have benefited immensely from such input. 

Unless a student gets to know a pro­fessor on a one-on-one basis, the faith and beliefs of the professor seem to be irrelevant. There is a long held tradi­tion in academia that seems to separate the personal beliefs in both the secular and religious spheres from teaching. If this is the case, why would a person's religious background matter? In my two years at Notre Dame, the most enriching conversations I had about Catholicism were with a non-Christian faculty member who, out of personal interest, knew an immense amount about Catholicism and challenged me to understand more deeply what it is about Catholicism that is important. 
Notre Dame's Catholic identity is expressed in ways that go beyond hir­ing mainly Catholic professors. The top quality and the willingness to engage the students in thought and discussion seem to be important in the hire of fac­ulty at Notre Dame. Besides being taught the faith and having it deepened and nourished, Catholics also need to learn how to engage it with the rest of the world, and a diverse faculty and student body is one of the best ways to understand, live and deepen one's faith.

Monday, April 24, 2006 
It's just too soon for this tagline: "September 11, 2001. Four planes were hijacked. Three of them reached their target. This is the story of the fourth." 
It's the tagline for "United 93," a movie, told in real­time, about the plane that crashed into a Pennsylvania field on that fateful morning. 
Maybe I've watched a little too much cable televi­sion over the years, but to me, that sounds an awful lot 
The Coffey

like the tagline of 
Grind

MTV's hit reality show. You know it ­"This is the story of seven strangers, picked to live in a house and have their lives taped, to see what happens when people stop being polite and start getting real." 
And while "United 93" is the story of 45 people (many of whom were indeed strangers) who chose to take a plane out of Newark International Airport on a sunny September morn­ing, this story -unlike the one on MTV -is not entertainment. Moreover, unlike MTV's contrived "Real World," this actually was the real world. It still is. 
In fact, Osama bin Laden, the orchestrator of the 9/11 attacks, is 


Too soon for 1 United 93' 
still wandering the deserts of Pakistan. And from wherever he is, he's still making videotapes and threatening more attacks against America. Each time a new tape is released, the al Qaeda leader still makes the front. page of American newspapers. 
In a United States Federal Courthouse, Zacarias Moussaoui is currently on trial for conspiring with al Qaeda to commit the 9/11 attacks. During the past few days, the jury has heard testimony from those who lost loved ones in the World Trade Center Towers and the Pentagon, including Michael Williams, a man who lost his 24-year-old son in the World Trade Center. Before the attacks, Michael was helping to plan his son's wed­ding. After the attacks, he helped to plan his funeral. 
On Wednesday, the jury will hear similarly gripping stories from the families of Flight 93 victims. Flight 93's cockpit voice recording will be played publicly for the first time. Then on Friday, April 28, a major motion picture will be released. It's just too soon. 
But we all love movies about heroes, right? Who didn't love "Batman" or "Indiana Jones?" And the men and women of Flight 93 were undoubtedly heroes. But if this Friday night I ask a friend what movies are playing at the local theater and she lists "United 93" as one of the options, I can't see myself exclaiming, "Oh yes! I really wanted to see that one!" That just wouldn't seem right. 

I couldn't buy a greasy tub of pop­corn and sit in a cushiony reclining chair to watch something so similar to what jurors are watching (and weeping over) in an Alexandria, Virginia courthouse. I just couldn't do it. The jurors are listening to the tes­timony in an attempt to decide whether or not to give Moussaoui the death penalty. But it's too soon for me to watch that in a movie theater. It's just not the right time. 
So when is the right time? When September 11 stops being news. And that might take a while. 
On July 18, 1863, Colonel Robert Gould Shaw led the 54th Massachusetts Voluntary Infantry, the first all-black regiment, into battle at Fort Wagner. The group experienced catastrophic losses. One hundred and twenty-six years later, TriStar Pictures released a movie about it. 
This movie, "Glory," received much critical acclaim. It grossed over 25 million dollars. Denzel Washington won an Oscar for his performance. I even watched it in my Civil War class last semester. And I loved it. 
But I don't need to watch a movie about Flight 93 in my American History class. I already saw live footage of the Shanksville, Pennsylvania field in my second peri­od AP American History class, back 
page 13 

on a September morning when I was a junior in high school. 
We don't need a major motion pic­ture about September 11. We can still see footage of it on CNN. Note that CNN is a 24-hour news network, not to be confused withE!, the 24-hour entertainment network. 
A film about September 11 will never be viewed as entertainment in the same way that MTV's "The Real World" is. One hundred and twenty­six years from now, the story of September 11 will undoubtedly evoke strong emotions in those who didn't watch two airplanes hit the World Trade Center towers in the middle of their American History class. But for these students, the events of September 11 will no longer be front­page news. For these students, 9/11 will truly be American history. 
Flight 93 crashed in a Pennsylvania field on September 11, 2001. It was part of the most devastating attack ever on American soil. Four and a half years later, Universal Studios is releasing a movie about it. That's just too soon.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Chicken rights 
In the April 19 issue of The Observer, Julie Nichols expressed her perspective on how we students could do our part to "make the world a better place" and "ease the suffering in the world" through decisions based on "compassion and decency" ("Rid campus eateries of battery-cage eggs"). I highly doubt any­one would argue that these abstract goals are quite worthy of our attention and commitment, as suffer­ing and injustice are rampant on both an interna­tional and local scale. 
Amidst my consideration of how to address suffer­ing around the world, Julie pointed out to me that farmers are confining their egg-producing chickens to "barren, wire cages" all over the world. Wait a second. Now this is a topic that truly deserves my attention. Let me forget about the international struggles against genocide in Sudan, the enslave­ment and forced prostitution of women in Eastern Europe and the growing sweatshops in Southeast Asia. All of the homeless, starving and impoverished people living on the streets in the US are also going to have to wait. Sorry CLAP and AllianceND, but it's the chickens' turn. 
I cannot truly express my severe disappointment that human rights (on whatever scale) are less important than the quality of life for your average chicken. At no point should animal rights step ahead of our own as a campus priority. While nothing nec­essarily threatens our existence as students, our attention would be much better spent addressing any worthwhile human cause before an arbitrary animal rights cause. 
Ultimately, Julie would like to see Notre Dame buy its eggs from a source that does not confine its chickens to a cage. If it were up to me, I'd much rather see the effort and money that she would apply to this cause sent to an international relief organization or earmarked for an increase in the wages of campus employees. While I completely agree that we should base our decisions on "com­passion and decency," I find that neither of these criteria is met by wasting resources on a species that is not even capable of appreciating it. Go tell a starving child or an impoverished working father that mistreated chickens deserve aide before them, and I guarantee that you do not understand compas­sion and decency.

Catholicistn equals patriarchy? 
Critics of President Father John Jenkins' "closing statement" should help us understand their response to the following questions. In what sense does "The Vagina Monologues" mount an "attack" on the Church or on Catholic teaching or the Magisterium? "Does it really reduce women to one of the female organs of reproduction?" 
No doubt theatre and film can be used to attack corporate greed or the war in Iraq. But since I'm not a trained film critic, I ask myself such simple questions as how does "The Vagina Monologues" stack up against such "classics" as "Roger and Me," "Fahrenheit 9/11" or "Bowling for Columbine?" 
The difference that seems most significant is that there is never, ever, any doubt as to who or what Michael Moore is attacking: the CEO of General Motors, President George W Bush and his rubber stamp Congress, absentee or uninvolved parents and indifferent school teach­ers. 

Who or what is Eve Ensler attack­ing? Women? The Catholic Church? The Magisterium? The proposition that sex outside marriage uniting a man and a woman is sinful? Forgive my dullness, please, I just don't read the script that way. 
I read "The Vagina Monologues" as a very broad satire, even a bur­lesque, ofthe basic principle of patri­archy -that men control female sexuality and fecundity and, neces­sarily, women's bodies, particularly their reproductive organs. It also ridicules male control of the lan­guage and speech used to describe female sexuality and women's bodies and body parts. 
As a Catholic, I would like to believe that an attack on patriarchy is NOT in itself an attack on Catholicism or on Catholic sexual morality. I would also appreciate the opportunity to invite my students to interpret such texts as "The Vagina Monologues" for themselves. 
Would it be too much to ask those who disagree with this interpretation of "The Vagina Monologues" and the academic freedom appropriate for college students to rebut it directly? 
Edward Manier professor of philosophy and history April21 


One loyal daughter's dissent 
In the thirty-some years since my graduation from Notre Dame, I have been embarrassed to be associated with the University only once: on April 5, 2006, when the new University President Father John Jenkins issued his profoundly disap­pointing "closing statement" on "Academic Freedom and Catholic Character." From Jenkins, the philosopher, I had hoped for so much more. 
For the last five years, when con­templating Notre Dame's sponsorship of the sexually degrading "Vagina Monologues," I thought perhaps philosophically serious people had not considered the work's implica­tions. As Father Wilson Miscamble points out in his clear-eyed open let­ter to Jenkins, the production is an insult to the dignity of women and men alike ("An open letter to Father John Jenkins," Aprilll). It reduces women to their body parts and pre­tends to define their identity and worth in terms of their sexual experi­ences (an attitude associated until now only with testosterone-driven alpha-males). It exalts lesbian rela­tionships. It is man-hating. It sepa­rates sex from relationships and love. It directly contravenes Pope John Paul II's important work on the inte­gral nature of body and spirit in what has been called Theology of the Body. 

The young woman who will sup­posedly spearhead "Loyal Daughters," a soon-to-be-created version of "The Vagina Monologues," believes the objections to the original production are fundamentally "politi­cal." What? The objections are philo­sophical. The issue is not Republicans versus Democrats -it is the sort of idea and mindset pro­moted on the Notre Dame campus and what it means to have a Catholic identity. 
Jenkins intuited this with his initial statements, and then he caved. Amazingly, he has been lauded for his "courage" to stand by the status quo. Real courage is the virtue it would take to do the right thing-to say, "I was wrong" and reverse course. That would be a model of courage this loyal daughter would not soon forget. 
In the meantime, could we please not label another sexually debasing performance, written by women who currently attend Notre Dame, "Loyal Daughters?" Some of us are offended enough already.

The 2004 French film "Exils," direct­ed by Tony Gatlif, tells the story of a couple who travel back to their parent's Algerian homeland, in search of their past, their families and themselves. The rich story is marked by cinematography of excess -intense music, colors, sounds and sex. Throughout their jour­ney through Europe and Africa, tho couple struggles to find a place where they bnlong.

Out of rwn1ssity -but also as a personal chal­lenge -they sneak on trains, buses and walk to Spain.

The audience comes to realize that they have not known each other for very long before they left on this jour­ney. It becomes obvious that Naima has had a difficult life and now struggles with intimacy and having a sense of belonging.

next weekend. pre-empting other 9/11 
themed films like Oliver Stonn's "World 
Tradn Center." The film is projneted to 
perform wPII both critically and com­
nwrcially, as it has been re<:eivcd posi­
tively in prn-rnlnase ser()(mings. 

"United <J]" is partieularly notable 
because it is tlw first major fictional film 
based on the events of IJ/11. Prior media 
eoveragn was primarily documentary in 
nature, induding slanted non-fiction like 
Mkhanl Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11." 
From "Titanie" to "Schindler's List" to Grnengrass' own "Bloody Sunday," his­torical tragedies arn a einematic staple. Yet never has the event been as dose to the American people as 9/11, and per­haps morn importantly, 9111 was a ·reeent event. Unlike most films based on historieal events, "United 93" arrives less than half a decade from the tragedy itself. This raises an important question: is it too soon? "United 93" lacks the advantagp, of time and history given to most cinematic depictions of real-life 
events. 

The movie's oiTieial Web site 
(www.united93movie.com) claims that, 
"tho time has come for contemporary 
einema's leading filmmakers to dramati­
cally investigate the events of [9111]." 
But is it truly time for sueh an investiga­
tion? Is five years enough? There are those for whom the event is still a very real and very fresh experience, and in light of America's continued involvement in tho Middle East, the consequences of the event are still left unresolved. 
The other important question is this: what are the filmmakers trying to achieve? The shock of the tragedy of 9/11 gave way to unified heroism and unbridled patriotism. Greengrass, in the "Director's Statement" on the official Web site, speaks of the "courage and endurance" of the men and women involved in 9/11 -is "United 93" thus a film about herons, or is it, as the trailers lead us to believe, about ordinary peo­ple'? The easy answer, of course, is that it's both -a film about ordinary people who became heroes. 
Such a depiction is in and of itself extraordinary, especially since the offi­cial Web site describes the flight as "one of the most heroic legacies of I incompre­hensible tragedyJ." Such a statement raises another question: if the tragedy of 9/11 is still incomprehensible, if its meaning has not been sorted through by time and understanding, is it really appropriate for filmmakers to be depict­ing such events? 
Some may feel uneasy due to the fact that the media seems to have cashed in so quickly on this tragic event. "United 93" is a feature film with a relatively small, but not unsubstantial budget (15 million dollars). It will undoubtedly make a lot of money in its theatrical release, and then in DVD sales.

Paul Greengrass' movie "United 93" chronicles the flight of the fourth plane hijacked by terrorists on Sept. 11, 2001. The plane crashed In Pennsylvania. 
What was so striking about the media reaction to 9/11 was the respect and taste Hollywood showed -films and tel­evision programs were delayed or had the Twin Towers digitally removed. For instance, a "Spider-Man" trailer featur­ing the World Trade Center was pulled from theaters. 
Yet here we are some five years later, and between Stone's film and Greengrass' film, it seems that Hollywood has returned to the tragedy with full gusto. Is it appropriate? Is it respectful? The quality and depictions of the films themselves will contribute much to the perception of Hollywood's 9/11, but only time will tell. And though Hollywood may believe the time is now, it remains to be seen if the time is right.

SHOW REVIEW 
~Rent' rocks the Morris Performing Arts Center 

The first production of "Rent" on Broadway featured Jesse L. Martin, right, and ldena Menzel, second from right, who would later star in the 2005 film version. 

By LAURA FOX 
Scene Writer 
The performances of "Hent" at South Bend's Morris Performing Arts Center­which ran for three nights this past week -provided audiences with a unique personal encounter with a famous Broadway production. 
Started as a script for a theatre work­shop, the evolution of "Rent" into a renowned musical involved a seven-year struggle with writing and rewriting for first-time playwright Jonathan Larson. Larson, however, was never able to see his masterpiece performed. After receiv­ing congratulations concerning his anticipated success, Larson died of heart complications on the eve of the show's opening. Grounding the musical in the celebration of life and the perme­ability of death, the spirit and tenacity of Larson's legacy has infused following performances with true emotion. 
In the year following Larson's death, "Rent" premiered to commercial and critical success. The musical received a total of 17 awards in 1996, including a number of Tony Awards and a Pulitzer Prize. 
The minimalist props the musical employs reflect the initial budget con­straints that Larson faced while writing "Rent." Three "Frankenstein" tables are usually used for multiple purposes, and a simply crafted metal spire may signify either a Christmas tree or a church steeple depending on the scene. 
This sparse, industrial set contrasted sharply against the ornate beauty of the Morris Performing Arts Center. Golden cornicfls and crown molding only fur­ther highlighted the bleak surroundings inhabited by Larson's vivacious charac­ters. 
The cast's performances offered an infectious spirit, which involved audi­ences in the closely intertwined ele­ments of levity and tragedy within the show. Focused on the lives of struggling artists in New York City, "Rent" func­tions as a musical and a social commen­tary. Once asked to describe his work in one sentence, Larson concluded, "'Rent' is about a community celebrating life, in the face of death and AIDS, at the turn of the century." 
The community Larson adeptly created consists of

Mark is the former boyfriend of the spunky and irrepressible Maureen, now a lesbian with the intelligent Joanne. He lives with Roger, an aspiring musician who meets and falls in love with Mark's beautiful and self-possessed neighbor Mimi. Mark befriends both Collins and Angel, who later become lovers. 
Many of the relationships within "Rent" have their problems -each pairing endures the hardships of AIDS, death, and jealousy but they do not do so individually. Instead, the beauty of their interactions allows them to share and shed their grief in an ultimate avowal of human dignity and strength. 

The audience at the Morris was capti­vated and included in this sensation through various scenes. The scene in which Maureen protests the attempted eviction of a homeless population from a vacant lot by the group's former friend Benny was a particularly good example of this effect. 
As a performance artist, Maureen uses her art to discuss the unnatural venture Benny is attempting to undertake and calls for universal action through a com­munal "leap of faith." Maureen further involves the audience as she calls them to "jump over the moon," a metaphor for overcom­

prices through the 
Student Union Board (SUB). Students were only charged $10 for tickets originally priced at $42. The decision of SUB to purchase such a large number of tickets and to offer them for such a low price was a welcome one for Katie Helm, the organizer of the outing. 
"It's great that SUB can get students involved in the South Bend community," Helm said. 
According to the testimonies of many of the attendees, students loved this opportunity to reach beyond the borders of campus and foray into the cultural life of South Bend. Jeniffer Velez, a pro­claimed lover of the popular movie ver­sion of "Rent," thought of trekking to Chicago with some of her friends to catch one of its. performances there, but was dissuaded by the high costs and dis­tance. 
"Having it play in South Bend was really convenient," Velez said. "It was awesome that SUB provided the stu­dents with tickets and transportation, especially since they gave us such a big discount." 
The musical invoked a common enthu­siasm among those who attended. Velez recounts her favorite memory of the show as "exiting the parking lot with the car in front of us blaring 'Seasons of Love.'" 
Orllana Gutierrez, also a big fan of the movie, was particularly pleased by the live performance of the musical as it offered her "extra insight into the emo­tions and experiences of the characters, and the additional scenes, excluded from the movie version, especially drew my interest." 
The staged production of "Rent" included various scenes that the movie excluded, further cementing the sense of community which Larson created. One in particular, the singing of "Christmas Bells" by the homeless street vendors and many of the main charac­ters of the cast elucidated both the tumultuous nature of their surrounding community and the love encompassed within their shared vivacious relation­ships.

Associated Press 
GREENBURGH, N.Y -Jaromir Jagr got only as far as the trainer's room Sunday after leaving the ice with his left arm limp a day earlier in the New York Rangers' play­off opener. 
His teammates practiced without him and there was no immediate indication that the All-Star who scored 123 points this season would be available to face the New Jersey Devils in Game 2 on Monday night. 
"He's uncomfortable, but it doesn't appear to be too bad," coach Tom Renney said Sunday . 
As disjointed as the 

Rangers looked in giving up five power-play goals during Saturday's 6-1 thrashing, having to face the formida­ble Devils without Jagr makes the outlook that much bleaker. 
Patrik Elias had two goals and four assists for New Jersey. 
"We're definitely playing with confidence," Devils for­ward Jamie Langenbrunner said. "When you have confi­dence, things seem to go better." 
The first half of New York's practice was sluggish but improved steadily. The highlight of the hourlong session was Michael Nylander's outburst that 
IN BRIEF 

Rockies more o~timistic about Helton's health 
DENVER-The music was a little louder, the mood a little lighter in Colorado's clubhouse, and the Rockies' 3-2 win over San Francisco in 10 innings Sunday wasn't the only thing they were celebrating. 
Slugger Todd Helton seems to be improving, although the stomach ail­ment that landed him in the hospital and on the disabled list Friday remained a mystery 48 hours later. 
"More a positive vibe because he is feeling better," team trainer Keith Dugger said. 
Helton is expected to be released from Rose Medical Center on Monday after another battery of tests. Dugger said doctors "haven't officially elimi­nated anything" but reiterated that Helton's condition isn't considered life-threatening. 
"I think there is improvement," manager Clint Hurdle said. "More optimism maybe today than there was yesterday." 
came after the puck was knocked away. He respond­ed by slamming his stick hard against the glass sever­al times. 
New Jersey already entered this first-round, best-of-seven series as the heavy favorite. New York is riding a six-game skid that cost them the Atlantic Division title to the Devils. 
Officially, Jagr's injury is being described as an upper-body problem. While getting a rare shift as a penalty killer, Jagr tried to take a swipe at Devils for­ward Scott Gomez. He made a stiff-arm type move as he carried the puck and didn't connect, apparently causing 

Red Sox, former _player 
agree to send World Series 
ball to Hall of Fame 
BOSTON -The Boston Red Sox and their former first baseman, Doug Mientkiewicz, agreed to end their legal fight over ownership of the ball from the final out of the 2004 World Series by sending it to the Hall of Fame. 
"An amicable agreement was reached many weeks ago, and it pro­vides a permanent home at the (Hall of Fame), with opportunities for some public display as well at Fenway Park," Red Sox president Larry Lucchino said via e-mail Sunday. 
The agreement was first reported Saturday night in The New York Times. 
Pitcher Keith Foulke fielded the ball off the bat of Edgar Renteria on Oct. 27, 2004, and threw to Mientkiwicz for the final out of Boston's four-game sweep of the St. Louis Cardinals. 
the injury. It'll be up to doc­tors, Renney and Jagr to decide if he can play Monday. 
"As long as we're working hard and playing within our system we should be able to get scoring chances with him out there at less than 100 percent," Renney said. "But we're going to be really very, very careful here and make sure that we give him a chance to assess where he is, both psychologically and physically." 
Rangers defenseman Darius Kasparaitis also sat out Sunday's practice as he recovers from a groin injury that forced him to miss 12 of the last 14 games. 
lniured Street still unavail­
atile for A's 
OAKLAND, Calif. -Huston Street's strained chest muscle is taking longer to heal than he might have expected. 
What the Oakland Athletics' closer thought would probably sideline him for only a couple of days could end up keeping him off the mound for more than a week. 
Street was unavailable to pitch for the fifth straight day Sunday and his status for a three-game series at Texas starting Monday also is in doubt. The A's have an off day Thursday before a weekend series at Kansas City, so they might decide to rest the reigning AL Rookie of the Year until then to be extra cautious. 
Street played catch for the second straight day Sunday but did not feel good enough to work off the mound, which had been a possibility if he had been physically able. Trainer Larry Davis is going to be conserva­tive with Street.

WOMEN'S lACROSSE 

Irish cotne back to edge Rutgers 
Foote became first ND player with 200 points 
By ERIC RETTER Sports Writer 
Notre Dame senior Crysti Foote led the team with four goals and five assists as the Irish snapped their two game losing streak Sunday, topping Rutgers 13-8 in a rainy game at Yurcak Field in Piscataway, New .Jersey. 
The No. 7 Irish had previ­ously dropped back-to-hack I 1-10 contests to No. 1 Duke and No. 3 Georgetown before improving their record to 11­3 (3-1 Big East) with Sunday's win over Hutgers. 
"I was ecstatic about the win," Notre Dame coach Tracy Coyne said. "I was real­ly happy about the way we responded to a lot of the chal­lenges they put out for us." 
The Irish got ofT to a quick start, with senior All­American candidate Crysti Foote seoring 48 seconds into the game, and recording an assist on freshman .lillian Byers' goal 1:04 later. 
Behind two goals from Katie Batiuk, the Scarlet Knights were able to tie it just as quickly, making the score 2-2 at 22:46. 
Although the Irish increased their lead to 5-2 with goals from sophomores Mary Carpenter, Heather Ferguson and Caitlin McKinney-Foote picked up assists on two -Hutgers again fought back, scoring four unanswered goals to go into halftime with a 6-5 lead. 

As the second half began, Foote took control offensively. The senior was involved in the first three goals of the half, scoring two goals after picking up an assist on Byers' half-opening goal. 
A candidate for the Teewaraton Trophy, which honors the nation's best play­er, Foote has 55 goals and 29 assists this season, and is only four assists away from breaking Notre Dame's single­season and career records. 
Foote's nine-point perform­ance was her third of the sea­son and made her the first Irish player to score more than 200 career points. 
"The thing about Crysti !Foote]'s game is that she just accomplishes things you don't even notice," Coyne said. "She works hard creating opportu­nities for others. Whatever the defense throws at her, she can recognize whether it's her time or someone else's." 
Once Foote's first goal of the half made the score 7-6, the Irish never relinquished the lead. 
After Kathryn Lawrence's goal 6:4 7 in to the half again made it a one-point game at 8-7, Byers, who finished with three goals and two assists, scored with 22:16 left to play and ignited a Notre Dame offensive run. The Irish score five straight goals, increasing their lead to 13-7 while hold­ing the Scarlet Knights score­less for 16:59. 
With games against No. 13 Syracuse and Vanderbilt remaining on the schedule, Notre Dame hopes to enter the postseason on a high note. 
"Our goal this year is to fin­ish on a winning record, and we can do that if we win our next two games," Coyne said. "[HoweverI. that will be a tall order with two good teams left to play." 
Notre Dame will play Syracuse at home Saturday at noon. 
Notes: 

+ Byers now holds the Notre Dame freshman record for goals scored. Her first goal of the game, which was her 39th of the season, pushed her over the mark. Byers currently has 41 goals with two games to play.

Appleby wins in Houston 
Five-under Sunday secures win for golfer 
Associated Press 
HUMBLE, Texas (AI') ­Stuart Appleby made it look easy in the Shell Houston Open. 
Appleby shot a S-under 67 on Sunday to cap a wire-to­wire vietory and join Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson as tlw only two-time winners on the I'GA Tour this year. 
Appleby, also the J 999 win­ner in Houston, linished at 19­under 269 on the new Tournament Course at Hedstone, six shots ahead of Bob Estes. Appleby matched the tournament record for margin of vietory and was the first player in the event's 60­year history to lead from the opening round to the end. 
The victory margin was also a personal best in eight career wins for Appleby. He won twice in playoiTs and the other live by one shot. 
"To have a eomfortable vie­tory has never left my lips," said Appleby, who won in 1999 by one stroke over John Cook and llal Sutton. "It was niee to know, coming down the last part of the day that things were in hand." 
Like a pinch to make sure he wasn't dreaming, Appleby asked caddie Joe Damiano where he stood with two holes left. 
"I knew where I was," Appleby said, "I just wanted to hear it from his lips." 
Appleby, who turns 35 on May 1, earned $990,000 and 

has two victories in the same 
year for the first time in his 
career. In January, Appleby 
won the season-opening 
Mercedes Championships for 
the third straight time. 
Lately, Appleby was growing increasingly frustrated that he couldn't win anywhere but Kapalua. 
"There needed be another dose of that throughout the years and there hadn't been," Appleby said. "Winning now, twice, puts that emotional feeling at a higher level. Once is nice, twice certainly shows and proves to you that what you're doing works." 
Estes dosed with a 69 to fin­ish second, and Steve Stricker was 12 under after a 66. Mathias Gronberg, paired with Appleby on Sunday, had a 73 to match Jerry Smith (72) at 10 under. 
None of them ever threat­ened Appleby, who won for the fourth time in five tourna­ments when holding the 54­hole lead. His one blemish came in 2004, when he closed with a 76 at Bay Hill and lost to Chad Campbell. 
Appleby never wavered this time. 
I le moved to 15 under on the first hole, curling in a 20-foot­er that danced halfway around the lip before falling. Gronberg, 5 feet closer, left his birdie putt short. 
Appleby extended his lead with birdies on Nos. 4 and 6. Before another birdie at No. 8, Appleby was careful to follow the rules. 
He hit his approach into a greenside bunker and found a bug crawling on his ball. He tried to shoo it away, but never touehed it. Once the bug disappeared under the sand. Appleby blasted out to 10 feet and sank the putt. 
Typical of Gronberg's day, his eagle chip from behind the par-5 eighth lipped out and he gained no ground. Gronberg then three-putted the ninth, while Appleby made a par to lead by four at the turn. 
As relaxed as he looked all week, Appleby said he was still churning inside. 
"You always feel pressure," he said. "As the week goes on, the pressure mounts. You've got too bleed it off and keep it at the level where the cooker doesn't blow." 
It never eame close. 
Estes mounted the only other mild threat, closing within three on the front nine. But Estes, from Austin, sliced his drive into the water on No. 8 and bogeyed the hole to drop four back. 
By the time Appleby reached No. 13, the only question was whether he'd break the tour­nament scoring record of 22 under set by Vijay Singh in 2002. 
Appleby reached the par 5 in two en route to a birdie, then fell back to 19 under with a bogey on 14. He made routine pars the rest of the way. 
The Houston Open will move to the weekend before the Masters next year, a jump tournament organizers hope will strengthen the field. 
They may also have to sell more players on the 7,457­yard Tournament Course, which got mixed reviews in its debut. 
ND TRACK AND FIELD 

Notre Dame adds four to Regionals 

Annen, Weber headline Irish qualifiers at event 
By DAN MURPHY Sports Writer 
Notre Dame continued its 
success on the track this 
weekend as the Irish sent the 
majority of their squad to the 
Central Collegiate 
Championships hosted by 
Eastern Michigan in Ypsilanti, 
Mich. 

The highlight of the meet was sophomore Kyle Annen's first-place finish in the ham­mer throw event with a total distance of 187 feet, one ineh. The seventh best toss in Notre Dame's history, Annen eclipsed distances that haven't been touched in over a decade. The mark was also long enough to qualify the Idaho native for the NCAA Hegional meet. 
"Kyle has done very well recently in practice, he is real­ly starting to come into the peak of the season and com­peting at the top of his game," freshman Anna Weber said. 
Weber, Annen's female coun­terpart, was also successful as she logged a length of 147 feet, five inches. The throw was just long enough to nudge out Eastern Michigan's Marika LeRoy for a second place fin­ish. Weber also placed first in the shot put competition earli­er in the day. 
The only other regional qualifier at the meet was the 4 x 100-meter women's relay team. The crew ran to its fastest finish of the season to claim second place behind the EMU Eagles. 
Maryann Erigha, one of the four members of the team, also ran well in her individual 100-and 200-meter sprints earlier in the day. She placed second in both events, with times of 12.2 and 23.71, respectively. 
"This meet was more about getting people ready for the Big East, trying to improve our marks," Weber said. 
Other notable performanees for the Irish included Okechi Ogbuokiri and Kate Mattoon, who both took home first place finishes in the 400-meter race and the pole vault, respective­ly. Notre Dame also added to its point total in the women's high jump as Stacey Cowan, Emily Loomis and Lauren Biscardi swept the top three spots. 
"We went in with a new phi­losophy to just win the compe­tition, rather than go for the best mark," Cowan said. "It helps to get your adrenaline pumping." 
On the men's side, Garet Koxlien was also a winner, dominating the competition in the discus throw with an ini­ti<tl mark of over 51.5 meters. Ryan Postel finished second behind Michigan's Stann Waite in the 400-meter race. 

The men also sent four dis­tance runners to Hayward Field in Eugene, Ore. for the Oregon Invitational. Thomas Chamney and Kurt Benninger became the third and fourth members of the team to quali­fy for the NCAA Regionals, as they both ran for the first time since the beginning of the out­door season. 
Chamney finished third in the 800-meter run with a time of 1:49.44. Benninger compet­ed in the 5,000-meter race. He finished in seventh place of the "A" bracket. 
Freshman Patrick Smyth also ran the 5,000-meter for the Irish. His time of 14:10.05 was good enough for third place, and he was only .05 seconds away from joining both Benninger and Chamney as a qualifier for the regional meet. 
Next week the Irish will split up again with the top athletes going to the Drake Helays in Des Moines, Iowa. The rest of the team will compete in the llillsdale Gina Relays in Hillsdale, Mich. The two com­petitions will be the last tune­ups before the Big East meet kicks off May 5.

No. 2 Nadal upsets Federer in Monte Carlo Masters final 
Tennis star beaten in French Open warmup 
Associated Press 
MONTE CARLO, Monaco ­Rafael Nadal called his latest clay-court win over top-ranked Roger Federer easier than the one at the French Open. 
Federer believes he is closer to figuring out how to beat Nadal on clay. 
Second-ranked Nadal defend­ed his Monte Carlo Masters title with a 6-2, 6-7 (2), 6-3, 7-6 (5) win over Federer on Sunday, handing the seven-time Grand Slam champion his second defeat of the year. 
Nadal has beaten Federer four times in five meetings, and twice on clay after winning in four sets last June at Roland Garros. Federer, who had 78 unforced errors on his least-favorite sur­face, is now 28-2. 
"I was beating him easier today than in Paris," Nadal said. 
"To begin the clay season like this, for me, is unbelievable." 
Nadal extended his winning streak on clay to 42 matches and can pass Bjorn Borg's mark of 46 and move behind Guillermo Vilas (53) if he wins next weekend at Barcelona. 
"One day, for sure, I'm going to lose on clay," said Nadal. "I just hope it isn't next week." 
Federer complimented himself on "a fantastic week" and felt his chances of one day over­hauling Nadal on clay "went up." 
"I've got to adjust quite a bit to play Rafael," Federer said. "But I already feel like I'm improving a lot. The more I play against him, the more I'll be able to figure out his game and the easier it will be." 
Nadal broke Federer seven times, overcame a 3-0 deficit in the fourth-set tiebreaker and won the match with a forehand pass that bounced on the line. 
"It's very special for me to defend the title," Nadal said. 
"Beating Federer in a final is special too. I was very aggres­sive with my forehand and I had a good touch." 
Federer lamented missed opportunities, felt his serve was below par, and was upset at converting only 4-of-18 break­point chances. 
"I was not serving well enough or just playing well enough from the baseline," Federer said. "I thought I gave him a little too much." 
Nadal used his big forehand to pressure Federer on his weaker backhand. 
"He's a lefty, so I'm always going to have problems," Federer said. "I enjoyed the bat­tle against him. I have answered some questions I had about how to play on clay." 
Federer appeared in his 12th consecutive final, but his win­ning run in Masters series matches ended at 29. His previ­ous Masters defeat came at Monte Carlo in a quarterfinal loss to Richard Gasquet of France last year. 
Federer started with a string of erratic shots that helped Nadal race to a 4-0 lead. 
He finished with twice as many unforced errors as his opponent, and his first-set loss was the largest margin this sea­son. Federer's previous worst sets were 3-6 against Olivier Rochus, Nikolay Davydenko and Tommy Haas. 
"I don't care about the unforced errors, as I had no choice but to attack him," Federer said. ''I'm going to make errors because I'm the 

guy pressing." 
Nadal served for the second set at 5-4, but Federer broke him, and closed out the tiebreaker with an ace. At the start of the third set, Federer broke Nadal to love and looked comfortable on serve before suf­fering a lapse. 
"I thought I let him have a couple of breaks, you know, just stuff out of the blue really," Federer said. 
Nadal broke for a 5-3 lead, and Federer screamed in frus­tration while losing the next game.

Notre Dame dominates opponents in sweeps 
Irish hitters unload for 31 runs in four games 
By DAN MURPHY and JAY 
FITZPATRICK 
Sports Writers 
Notrn Dame finished its home Big East schedule on a high note, sweeping both Villanova and Hutgers in weeknnd dou­bleheaders. 
Irish pitcher Heather Booth dominated the Scarlet Knights in game one, throwing a perfect gamn in the five-inning win. The pm~fect game was Booth's first, as .well as her first solo no-hitter in her already illustri­ous career. The complete game also brought Booth over the XOO inning mark. making her the first Irish pitcher to accom­plish this feat in the school's history. 
Thn Irish were also able to hit the ball hard all weekend, driv­ing in eight runs in three of· their games and seven in the fourth. 
Notre Dame catcher Mallorie l.enn and third baseman Meagan Huthrauff had huge days at the plate, each hitting a homerun and driving in multi­ple runs, and shortstop Sara Schoonaert inade a big impact in the field by robbing hitters of what would have been base hits. 
Notre Dame 8, Villanova 7 
The weekend started in excit­ing fashion as the Irish (31-13, 13-1 Big East) needed some last-inning heroics to overcom~ the worst inning in Notre Dame's recent history for an 8­7 win over Villanova. 
Notre Dame entered the bot-

tom of the seventh down two runs. Ruthrauff started the inning with a deep solo shot over the centerfield wall. Then consecutive doubles brought around Notre Dame lirst base­man Linda Kohan to tie the game as right fielder Carissa Jaquish, the winning run, stood at second. 
Two batters later Notre Dame designated player Erin Glasco stepped to the plate and deliv­ered her second game-winning hit of the season. A sharp single through the left side of the infield scored Jaquish easily and the Irish survived Villanova's scare. 
The excitement for Notre Dame came after an explosive Wildcat fifth inning. Villanova piled up seven runs off of six hits against Booth. There were no errors or. extra base hits ­the entire Wildcats' lineup got the job done with consi~tent hit­ting. 
Notre Dame 8, Villanova 3 
The second game of the dou­bleheader was also close for the majority of the game, and once. again, Glasco came through with the big hit Notre Dame needed. A two-run home run in the fifth inning put the Irish ahead for good. 
The score was tied 3-3 as a fired up Villanova once again looked to be in position to upset the Irish. Two sacrifices scored Wildcats leadoff hitter Cassie Koenig after she started the game with a double to right field. 
Notre Dame's scoring started in the fourth frame with three consecutive bunt hits at the top of the order. Ruthrauff then added two more as she double into left field to take a 3-2 lead. 
The advantage did not last ­long as the Wildcats responded in the fifth as Villanova first basemen Laura Determan sin­gled in the tying run -setting the stage for Glasco's homer. 
The Irish tacked on two more in the fifth and one in the sixth to go ahead 8-3 and freshman Brittany Bargar (8 hits, 7 strikeouts) was able to silence Villanova for the remainder of the game. 
Notre Dame 8, Rutgers 0 
The Irish started game one strong against Rutgers (12-34, 4-14) behind. Booth's perfect game in l'ive innings of work, including four strikeouts. Booth overpowered Hutgers, using all of her pitches effectively to keep every Scarlet Knight off the basepaths. 
"Heather dominated today, making hitters look sick with her changeup," Irish head coach Deanna Gumpf said. "She went out and had great com­mand over her pitches today. 
Booth's perfect game was aided by a hardworking defense behind her, including great plays by Kohan and Jaquish. 
"The defense played awesome today," Booth said. "They went out and took away a lot of hits." 
Notre Dame also had a big day at the plate from the start, sending seven batters to the plate in the first and scoring three runs behind a Ruthrauff single and a two-run double by Kohan. 
After a quiet second inning, Notre Dame continued the onslaught in the third with two more runs. Kohan knocked in sophomore pinch runner Brittany Glynn with a sacrifice fly while Jaquish poked an RBI single over the shortstop to add

another run to the Irish lead. 
Notre Dame finished off the five-inning contest with a big final inning, led by back-to­hack homeruns by Lenn and Ruthrauff. Kohan followed with a walk and Glasco finished off the win with an RBI double to left center. 
"We unloaded on their pitch­ing today," Booth said. "They tried a lot of different things against us, but no one could control our bats today." 
Notre Dame 7, Rutgers 0 
The Irish came out a little slow in the second game, but an explosive five-run fifth inning helped Notre Dame pull well out of reach from the Scarlet Knights and complete the sweep. 
Notre Dame batted around in the fifth, starting with a double to the warning track in center by second baseman Katie Laing. Laing's base hit was fol­lowed by a single from Schoonaert and a two-run dou­ble to left center by Leon to give the Irish a 3-0 lead. The Irish were able to knock in three more runs in the inning to secure their eventual 7-0 win. 
One important reason for the offensive turnaround for the Irish in the fifth was their abili­ty to make adjustments to Rutgers' pitching. 
"We needed ~hat bi.g rally in the fifth," Gumpf said. "We had the bases loaded with no outs twice, and we couldn't have that. We made some good adjustments in the fifth and that really helped out." 
With the sweep, the Irish complete their home Big East schedule, but still have key matchups on the road against Louisville and South Florida to come. 
"We aren't looking to the postseason yet, because we still have a lot of tough parts of the season left," Booth said. "Louisville and USF are going to be big games that we need to win."

No. 11 KPMG cruises past Fully Depreciated 
Average foe's, Smush Parker also advance 
By TIM DOUGHERTY AND 
FRAN TOLAN 
Sports Writers 

In a business battle botween old and new, No. 11 KPMG stearnrolled its toughest compo­tition of tho tournament so far to advanco to the round of 64 with a 21-7 win against Fully Deproc.iatod. 
Matdwd against live formida­bly-sizod University mnployees in tho accounting orliee, whoso narno suggosts their gamns (and aecountsl aren't what they used to he, tho accounting firm-spon­sored studonts overcame expe­rioneo with frosh innovation ­and logs. 
KI'MG establishod a physical defensive presonce early. matching its strength with youthful quickness that enabled tho team to force turnovers when Fully DPpreciatod players drovo into the lane. 
"These guys were pretty big and physieal. so it was good to go out and bang with them," KI'MG senior financo major Greg Hiltz said, while adding that Fully Depredated was KI'M<;'s most worthy victim thus far. 
Former walk-on running back junior Hobert 1/ydfl led KPMG to an 11-4 halftime advantage with four of his live points. 
Then Greg "Busch Leaguer" Hiltz Show took control. as he buried three of KPMG's next four points on mid-range jumpers to stretch the lead to 15-4. llis shot tingled the nylon en route to his game-high seven­points for KPMG, of whom Hiltz said -if not for sponsorship restrictions -would be aptly named It Tingles. 
Hyde and Hiltz, two Keough Hall "Sons of Grace," were too much for Grace Hall's current office occupiers, according to Fully Depreciated's Andy Hoeder, who said the team did not have high expectations for the game. 
Captain Kyle Johnson agn~ed, especially since the team had to pick up two late subs. 
"The score was closer than tho game looked;" Johnson said. 
The Smush Parker Project 21, Team Vinny 4 
Bookstore Basketball learned a n71w term Sunday, as Team Vinny found out what it feels like to get "smushed" in the final day of round of 128 play. 
Though Webster and Oxford may not inelude "smushed" in their literal lexicons, the defini­tion would have something to 

-do with falling behind 8-0, 
being dominated in the paint, 
and succumbing to relentless 
transition basketball by Dillon 
freshman. 
Michael Wakim was all over 
the court for Smush Parker, 
hounding ball handlers by pick­
ing their pockets or forcing 
errant throws. Smush Parker 
then beat Vinny down the court 
to convert those turnovers into 
easy baskets around the net. 
Only one of Smush Parker's 
first-half points came outside of 
10 feet from the rim, as the 
squad commanded an 11-4 
lead. 

Team Vinny struggled to lind 
an inside presence all day, set­
tling for unsuccessful long 
jumpers into unpredictably 
gusty winds. 
Wakim was on the receiving 
end of several fastbreaks that 
he started, leading Smush 
Parker with six points and sev­
eral steals in a game which the 
team was fully prepared. 
"We came and scouted them 
the game before and knew we 
had nothing to worry about," 
Wakim said confidently. 
After the win, Smush Parker 
ran through a tunnel of hands 
formed by their numerous fans. 
"We had great fan support out 
there," Wakim said. "We had 
the sixth man on the sidelines." 
On the court, it was Mark 
Langhans who complimented Wakim's performance with live hard-earned baskets around the rim, establishing an inside game that featured rebounding dominance thanks to Smush Parker's superior ability to box out. 
Langhans, on the other hand, explainnd their overall success more simply. 
"They got smushed," he said. 
Team Mountain Lightning 21, Pageantry 12 
With a smashmouth style of play resembling that of a foot­ball team. Team Mountain Lightning defeated Pageantry Sunday. Mountain Lightning's Brent Gills was able to put up a game-high 13 points despite the physical play by both teams. 
"Nobody could hit a shot in the beginning, but I eventually found my stroke," Gills said. 
Both teams maintained high intensity levels throughout the contest, but Mountain Lightning was able to pull away early in the second half. 
"Both teams got pissed off but, after about two hours of play, we were happy to come out with the win," Mountain Lightning captain T.J. Ceravolo said. 
Ceravolo also said the Pageantry players were poor sports when they fell behind. 
"They got really whiny," he said. 
Mountain Lightning was thrilled to advance to the next round after the rough vktory. 
"We're definitely ready to move on," Ceravolo said. 
Average Joe's 21, Justice League of Notre Dame 10 
Average Joe's cruised ·to a victory over a less-than-super Justice League of Notre Dame team Sunday. The Average Joe's are already preparing for its round of 64 matchup. 
"We gon' get to that next round," Average Joe's swing­man Benedict "Hendry" Pietrzak said. "I wanna know where the gold at." 
Average Joe's dominated the J ustiee League inside to build an 11-6 halftime lead. 
It also employed a sufli>cating 2-3 zone that Justice League was unable to solve throughout the contest. 
Average Jon's point guard Jeff Schweitzer, generously listed at 5-foot-4, shouldered much of the o!Tnnsive burden to take the pressure off of his teammates. 
"Jeff played liko he was at least 5-foot-8 today," Pietrzak said. "lie was a monster for us."

tournament this year. After expanding the conference. Notre Dame will see a number of new teams. 
"With several new Big East teams now in the fold, it should make for a very competitive event," Irish coach Jim Kubinski said. 
One of the new teams, Louisville, has replaced Notre Dame atop the Big East stand­ings, much to the team's dismay. 
"I was a little surprised by that," Kubinski said. "Especially after beating them [in the Boilermaker Invitational], to see Louisville get the No. 1 seed was unexpected to say the least." 
If the Irish hope to regain their first place spot, they will most likely call on their seem­ingly unmatched experience. 
"One of the coaches joked about this being Mark [Baldwin.]'s lOth Big East cham­pionships," Kubinski said. 
While 10 is a bit of a stretch, 
both  Baldwin . and  Scott  
Gustafson  have  been  here  
before.

East Championship, there's no question that will help us this week," Kubinski said. 
One player. who hasn't been there before is freshman Josh Sandman. But if his play over the past month is any indica­tion, that won't hurt him in the least. 
Kubinski said Sandman, who posted a 69 in the final round of the Boilermaker invitational, has been playing as well as any­one on the team. 
In fact, Kubinski feels Sandman can lead the team to this year's championship. · "If he plays like he's been playing, he could possibly lead the team in scoring. And if he does that, we'll be in good shape to win," Kubinski said. 
Fortunately for Sandman, he won't have to do it by himself. All live golfers have been show­ing signs of greatness over the week-long break. 
"Mark, Cole, Josh and Scott have all shot in the mid-60s in qualifying matches," Kubinski said. "And our 'fifth' guy, Tommy Balderston, shot a 71, so he's not too far olTthe pace." 
Kubinski is quick to note Balderston is not a typical fifth player, as he may have the most tournament experience. After battling neck and shoulder 

. injuries in the fall. he was unable to participate in any om­cia! tournaments. Kubinski, however, is confi­dent that won't hurt his per­formanee. "Tommy was actually selected All-Big East twice, so he knows how to play in these kind of tournaments," Kubinski said. "It's like having a number two or three talent at tlw number five spot."

Irish coach
with a pair of dou­bles wins -its 25th consecutive doubles point. No. 6 juniors Catrina and Christian Thompson topped the Bulls' No. 10 Gabriela Duch and Neyssa Etienne H-3. 
No. 38 sophomore Brook Bud and freshman Kelcy Tefft fol­lownd up their win, clinching the point after downing South Florida's Liz Cruz and leiri Hai 
H-4. 
The final match between sen­iors Laurnn Connnlly and Stastny and South Florida's Luisa Obardo and Courtney Vernon was abandoned, as the Irish already held a 5-4 lead. 
Coach Jay Loudnrback believes the doubles point has played a significant factor in the team's success all season. 
"We had such a good team efl'ort. and Nos. 1 and 2 played really well." he said. "II' we're ever close in a match, it is doubles that carries us." 
In singles, first off the court was No. 31 Catrina Thompson, who defeated No. 63 Etienne 6­2, 6-2. The next win came from Connelly, who topped Obardo 7­6 (7-2), 6-3. The final and clinching victory for Notre Dame came from Stastny, who eelipsed Hai 3-6, 6-1, 6-1. "I had a rough start at the beginning, so I was [focusing on I keeping the ball in play," Stastny said. "[Further into the contest] I was playing more con­fidently and consistently. So it was slow start, but strong lin­ish."

mining factor in  
the  win  was  
experience.  
"We  have  played such  as  

tough schedule this year. South Florida is a good team, they just haven't played as tough of a schndule, and that experience really helped us out," he said. "We played a lot on the road against good teams, so playing here didn't affect us." 
Ilowever, the one variable that was dif'ficult to adjust to were the weather conditions. "It was really hot and humid, and wo did a great job of surviv­ing that," Louderback said. 
"We also didn't have really long matches !leading up to the finals!, so we were pretty well­rested." 
Notre Dame returns to the courts on May 12 in the first round of the NCAA Championships. 
The draw will be announced on May 3.

FOOTBALL NOTEBOOK 
Bettis makes return to ND 
By ERIC RETTER Associate Sports Editor 
Former Notre Dame running back Jerome Bettis said Saturday's Blue-Gold game was the first time he rnturned to Notre Dame Stadium since entering the NFL in 1993. 
Bettis was one of four hon­orary coaches for the game, along with former Irish stand­outs Hocket Ismael. Bob Golic and Mike Golic. 
Bettis said he had seen road games when Notre Dame played near Pittsburgh when he was with the Steelers, but time constraints kept him from attending road games. 
"I had a day job, so I couldn't make it," he quipped. 
Bettis' appearance was a long time in the making. Bettis said a prior commitment prevented him from serving as an hon­orary coach at last year's Blue­Gold Garno but told Irish eoach Charlie Weis that he would coach in the 2006 event. 
"IIc booked me a year-and-a­half in advance, and didn't let me get out of it," Bettis said. "It was like, you are booked, it's a done deal, go to the next ques­tion," 
Bettis said he was glad to finally return to the fold at Notre Dame. 
"It was fun I got some goose­bumps going down the tunnel," he said. ''I'm just glad to be back and be a part of every­thing that's going on." 
+ The attendance of 41 ,279 was the highest in Blue-Gold history. 
Bob Golic attributed this to the excitement Weis and his coaching staff have brought to the program. 
"There is a different look in people, there's a different look in the eyes of the players there's a different look in the eyes of the fans, because they see something," he said. "Everything is going in the right direction, [and! because of that, there's this optimism, this excitement; people are actually enjoying going to the game." 
+ Junior punter Geoff Price had a strong showing Saturday afternoon, moving him closer to becoming the starting punter. Price punted the ball four times, with punts of 43, 43, 50 and 52 yards for a 46.3-yard average. 
"It's good to see price punting the ball pretty [well]," Weis said. "lie had multiple 50 yard punts, that lifts my spirits."
+ Irish kicker Carl Gioia struggled Saturday, going 1-for­3 in field goals and missing both within 40 yards. 
"Missing two field goals, sign me up it concerns me," Wcis said. 
But he was pleased that Gioia rebounded and made the kick to end the game. 
"Even though it's not the pressure of real game it's still the last play of the game," Weis said. "You kick the field goal, you're either in overtime or you win the game in regulation. It's just like when a quarterback throws an interception, you want to come out there and throw a pass right off the bat and get it out of the way, well same thing with field goals." 
+ Notre Dame running back Travis Thomas capped his strong spring with the 77-yard touchdown run in the third quarter. Weis said Thomas' hard-hitting style complements starting running back Darius Walker's finesse game well. 
"[Thomas] is just going to pound you and pound you and pound you and hit you in the mouth," Weis said. "lie's very unique, because there are very few offensive players with defensive mentalities. He plays the game like he's a line­backer." 
+ Notre Dame senior line­backer Mitchell Thomas started for the Gold team -with the defensive first team -and looks to compete for a spot to join Maurice Crum Jr., who is currently injun~cl, in the start­ing linebacking corps. 
Mitchell Thomas joined soph­omore Anthony Vernaglia and freshman Paul Quinn as the starters for Gold. 
+ Irish freshman Evan Sharpley took steps to distin­guish himself as the backup quarterback for next season. Sharpley was 1 0-of-12 for 112 yards. 
"Completing 10 out of 12 passes, I think that's a pretty good day," Weis said. "I thought he held up well for himself today." 
But Weis was not pleased when Sharpley fumbled a snap early in the second half­something that competing quarterback sophomore David Wolke also did. 
Wolke completed his only pass attempt of the game for eight yards. 
+ Weis said he has boon pleased with the talent level in his receiving corps. 
lie said the return of consen­sus All-American Jeff Samardzija and the team's for­mer No. 1 receiver Hhema McKnight has created a buzz in some eirdes. 
"I was talking to one of the scouts for the [New England I Patriots during pre-game, and we were looking out there at Hhema and Jell', and they were like 'Whoa, we got a couple of legit receivers now,"' Weis said. "You could match those two up with anybody. They're two front line receivers."

Belles drop lllatch to Calvin 8-1 
By GREG ARBOGAST 
Sports Writer 
This is not how Saint Mary's envisioned heading into the MIAA conference tournament. After fighting to within a half-game of first place in the conference with a dramatic win over Kalamazoo ten days ago, the BeJles fell to fourth place in the MIAA with Saturday's 8­1 loss to Calvin. 
The loss drops Saint Mary's conference record to 5-3 on the season. The Belles are currently behind Albion, Calvin and Kalamazoo. Calvin moved into second place in the MIAA with its victory over the Belles. 
"Calvin is a really good consistent team," senior co­captain Kristen Palombo said. "They don't have a true number one player, but their players are very consistent throughout their line-up. That puts other teams at a disadvantage." 
Palombo, who lost her match to Calvin's Amy Zeilstra by the score of 6-2, 
7-5, was one of five Saint Mary's players to lose her singles match in straight sets. 
No. 3 Calie Mulcahy lost to Annie Huizenga 6-4, 6-4, while No. 4 Mary Elizabeth O'Connor was defeated by Kari Lipinski 6-3, 6-0. 
No. 5 Tara O'Brien, return­ing after a one-match absence due to injury, was unsuccessful in her return as she lost to Allyson Logan 6­2, 6-1. No. 6 Melissa Dingler fell short against Kim Bosscher 6-2, 6-4. 
Junior co-captain Kelly McDavitt was the only Saint Mary's player to walk away from Saturday's match victo­rious, defeating Emily Dosterhouse 6-1, 6-2. 
The inability to win close games, which has been an issue for the Belles in their past couple of matches, plagued Saint Mary's again Saturday and is an issue that the team knows it must work on. 
"In close games, a lot of the time it comes down to believing that you can win the point, and that's some­thing we're really struggling with right now," Palombo said. "We have to play to win the points rather than not to lose them." 
One positive the team took from Saturday's match was that it prepared the Belles for next weekend's MIAA conference tournament. Saint Mary's was on the court for 12 hours against Calvin, and that foreshadows the type of stamina the Belles will need next week­end. 
Each player will have to play up to four matches in the conference tournament. 
Although Saint Mary's is currently in the midst or a two-match conference losing streak and a four-match los­ing streak overall, the team is ready to use the upcoming week to prepare itself for the conference tournament. 
"We're just going to try and have a couple of good practices this week," Palombo said. "We can't con­trol our draws, so we're just going to try and get our con­fidence back."

After a walk and a hit batter loaded the bases again, Dressman knocked in two more runs with his second sin­gle of the inning. 
Right bander Jeff Manship earned the win for the Irish, throwing seven innings and allowing three runs -all in the first inning -on six hits with eight strikeouts and two walks. 
Mainieri said Manship's per­formance Saturday was remi­niscent of starts by Notre right-hander Jeff Samardzija, who has given up early runs several times this year only to shut down opponents for the rest of the game. 
"I thought what Manship did was Samardzija-like," Maineri said. "He struggled early, but was able to battle back and dominate the game." 
Notre Dame 11, Rutgers 5 
The fan and media that descended upon Frank Eck Stadium to see Jeff Samardzija pitch in Friday's series opener served as an electric backdrop for an electric day at the plate for Notre Dame. A crowd of 3,507 fans -part of a record-setting weekend attendance of 10,003 -saw the Irish top Rutgers in the first of three weekend games. 
Cooper extended his hit streak to 19 games with two two-run home runs over the right field fence, and Samardzija (6-1) picked up the win after working seven and one-third innings and allowing three earned runs on six hits and three walks. He struck out six Rutgers batters. 
"It was a monumental night for Notre Dame baseball," Mainieri said. "We had a packed house, beautiful weather, a 19-game win streak on the line. And we've got a guy like Jeff Samardzija, who's practically a rock star celebri­ty in this town now." 
The Irish rode a three-run rally in the fifth inning to break open a 2-2 deadlock. Cooper belted his first long 

ball off Scarlet Knights starter Steve Holt to spark the offen­sive outburst, scoring center fielder Nettey. Designated hit­ter Brezovsky gave the Irish the 5-2 advantage several bat­ters later on an RBI ground­out. 
"[Cooper] has been phenom­enal. If he's not the player of the year in the conference, I don't know who is," Mainieri said. "He's just been fantastic -great defense at first base, hitting in the clutch, getting us going, hitting home runs, doing all the things that he needs to do." 
The Irish added two more runs in the sixth inning off a bases loaded chop RBI single over the pitcher's head by third baseman Brett Lilley and a bases loaded walk by Dressman. 
A four-run seventh inning completed the damage inflict­ed by the Notre Dame bats on the day. Lopez belted an RBI sacrifice fly to center field, and Nettey knocked home another run on an error by Rutgers' first baseman Steve Hook. 
Cooper later hit his second two-run dinger over the right field fence to extend the Irish lead to 11-2. 
But Rutgers cut the score to 11-5 with a three-run eighth inning. Stewart entered in relief and stopped the Scarlet Knights attack, striking out four of six batters faced in his inning and two-thirds of work. 
"He's been so reliable for us coming in, throwing strikes, changing speeds," Mainieri said. "And he's been like that all year for us."

'Tvn seen [Clausen's interest in Notre I>mne) boom since tim first time he brought me out hero for [Notrn Dame's) junior day," Tyler said aftnr the press confimmce. "I was like, 'What school are you going to recruit me to?' But he wouldn't say. After that, I knew he liknd Notre Dame a lot." 
Clausen's father, Jim, said he wa.<.; plea.<.;ed with Jimmy's deci­sion. 
"It's a dremn comn true," Jim Clausnn said. 'Tm overwhelmed by all this. Wf~'re tremendously honored." 
Jim Clausen said he is most proud of the efliJrt his son has put into his football career. 
"I don't know if [Jimmy's) good enough to play fbotball at Notrf~ Damn or not, but I know he's a young man that has worked extremely hard to get to this point," he said. 

Jimmy Clausen's brother, Ca.r;;ey Clausen, said he wanted to play at Notre Dmne but went to Tennessee because Irish coach Bob Davie wanted an option quarterback at the time instead of a drop-back passer. Casey Clausen started four years for the Volunteers from 2000-03. 
"I think once Coach Weis cmne here and did what he did last year, with Coach Willingham's players basically, it kind of opened up [Jimmy's) eyes a little bit," he said. "He's one of a kind -m1d I'm his oldest broilier, so I'm his biggest critic. But this a kid who's kind of in a league of his own."

up front without blitzing, I thought that there was good pressure applied, especially by that first group on defense," head coach Charlie Weis said. "I thought that first line was creating a lot of havoc in there, which that was encouraging." 
The effort was led by junior defensive taekle Trevor Laws, whose two sacks earned him the Defensive MVP award. Laws had three total tackles in the game. 
"Obviously, Trevor [Laws) got the MVP because of the pene­tration he was causing right there," Weis said. 
The blue team was led by the starting offense and the gold team was led by the starting defense. Notre Dame coach Charlie Weis pitted the first team units against each other and the second team units against each other in order to ensure parity. 
His plan worked. The game was a scoreless tie for much of the first half, until junior wide receiver Jeff Samardzija caught a 35-yard touchdown pass from junior quarterback Brady Quinn with 3:15 left in the second quarter. 
An 83-yard touchdown run by junior running back Travis Thomas in the third quarter was the only other score until Gioia's game-winner. 
"I showed patience and something broke open for us," Thomas said. "[Ferrine] was coming behind me and I was like 'five more [yard!. five more [yards]' and I looked behind me and I was like 'leap!' and I got in there." 
The game's first possession ended when Samardizija attempted a pass and was intercepted by cornerback Ambrose Wooden. The play 

was one of four trick plays drawn up by the two offensive honorary coaches, Raghib Ismail and Jerome Bettis, none of which had much success. 
But while Ismail and Bettis used their permitted trick plays, the defensive coaches ­Bob and Mike Golic -didn't participate much in the on­field action. 
"They gave us both headsets that didn't work; we got incom­ing but there was no outgoing," Bob Golic joked after the game. "I got that right away [that our headphones didn't work], [my brotherI Mike actually didn't get that until the second quar­ter." 
On the next possession, Gold appeared poised to score, driv­ing 60 yards in nine plays behind 4-of-5 passing from freshman quarterback Evan Sharpley, but the drive stalled and Gioia missed the 34-yard field goal. 
After the game, Weis was pleased with the play of both defenses -especially sinee the Irish ran a base defense for much of the afternoon. 
"I think that it's been pretty obvious that one of the things we've done throughout the spring is try to keep it relative­ly simple to make sure that we can evaluate their athletic abil­ity based ofT of them not hav­ing to think about what they have to do," Weis said. "I think it's a positive when you can turn 'em instead of playing base defense and be able to hold up pretty well."

FOOTBALL RECRUITING 

Highly-touted recruit Clausen commits to Irish 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Editor 
SOUTII BEND -For Jimmy ClausPn, it was all about the coach. 
Tlw Westlake Village, Calif., quarterback said Saturday he will attend Notrn Dame thanks to the straightfiJrward recruiting of Irish eoaeh Charli1~ Weis. 
"It all comes down to Coach Weis," Clausen said. "Throughout 
FOOTBALL 

the recruiting process, he has been straightforward with me. I just think this is a great situation, and every high school quarterback would want to play under Coach Weis." 
In front of more than 250 people during a news conference in front of the lleisman Gallery at the College Football Hall of Fame, the nation's No. 1 high school quarter­back -and arguably the most highly touted quarterback recruit since Ron Powlus -announced he will enter Notre Dame as an early­enrollee next spring. 
"I think you all know why I'm here today," Clausen said. ''I'm very excited and proud to say that in January I'll be attending the University of Notre Dame." 
Clausen's announcement was followed by 27 seconds of thunder­ous applause from the fans in attendance. The 6-foot-3, 195­pound protege of renowned quar­terbacks coach Steve Oarkson has thrown 88 touchdowns and just 11 interceptions while leading his Oaks Christian High School team to a 27-0 record as a starter. 
''I'd like to say 'thank you' to Coach Weis for having the confi­dence in me throughout the recruiting process," Clausen said. "I look forward to thi<> afternoon to meet my future teammates and help bring us national champi­onships."

Gioia nailed a 20-yard field goal to break the 7-7 tie as timP expin~d in the fourth quarter -in front of a record 41,279 fans. Gioia had missed a ]4-yard liPid goal earlitw in the first quarter and Notre Dame head coach Charlie Weis was happy the junior ended the game when he did. 

''I'm glad we kicked a field goal, because I didn't know what I was going do with over­time," Weis said. "I didn't say too much during the game, but I did say center the ball and kick the field goal." 
Both Notre Dame defenses played well and limited the scoring opportunities of the opposing offenses. And for Notre Dame, who ranked 75th in total defense and 103rd in pass defense last season, get­ting pressure on the passer had been a focal point during spring practiees. 
"All spring long I've been talking about getting pressure
