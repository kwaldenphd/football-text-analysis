Cheerleading is better left to students in the stands 
Question: What can a five-year-old girl dressed in pink do that a whole team of Notre Dame cheerleaders cannot? 
Ifyou answered "Bring a crowd to its feet," give your­
self a pat on the back for remembering one of the few 
highlights of last night's basketball contest with the St. 
Louis Billikens in the ACC. 
The child earned a standing ovation twice for shaking and gyrating to selections from the band. She was given the opportunity to perform because Jeff Anhut, the suspender-dad junior who periodically goes into dan­cing fits during a certain song, had to work tonight-­according to a sign held up by a friend. 
Meanwhile, your uniformed keepers ofthe Irish spirit watched from the floor. I hope they picked up a pointer or two. For when it comes to maintaining the spirit 
during games, the folks with the pom-poms have failed miserably. 
Two weeks ago, Notre Dame faced DePaul in na­tionally televised rematch. Not a seat was empty. During actual play, the stands were shaking, the din from the students' shouts as loud as anytime during the last four years. But during the timeouts, as everyone looked for direction from the cheerleaders, all we got were handstands. And pyramids. And choreographed dance routines. And the crowd sat down. 
Being a cheerleader at Notre Dame has to be one of the easier jobs to master. Ninty percent of the time, the student section starts the cheer anyway. The task usually becomes minimizing the time it takes to follow along. But there is that remaining ten percent when -God forbid -we actually need cheerleaders. Indeed, that's why the school dresses, trains and flys these individuals to all points of the country. 
But these people aren't leading cheers. They're rol­ling around the floor of the ACC doing impressions of Jennifer Beals and Kurt Thomas. And the atmosphere of the game suffers because ofit. The excitement ofcheer­ing for collegiate sports repeatedly gets drowned out under the onslaught of dance routines from the soundtrack of"Purple Rain." 
There's no help from the mascot, either. If there's 

anyone who has an outright license to go nuts during 
the game, it's the leprechaun. But talk about a dud. We 
were out-entertained by a Billiken last night, and I don't

even know what a Billiken is. 

Simple creativity is the request here. The best cheer­leaders don't just offer up the same old hash. The last cheer I can remember the skirted crew coming up with is the "arm swimming back and forth" cheer. But even that crowd favorite makes a rare appearance now in the ACC. Handstands and a dance move that looks like an attempt to dry fingernail polish is the standard fare. Nei­ther prompt much in the way of response, save a smat­tering ofapplause from kinds patrons on the other side

of the arena. 
It's clearly time to take things into our own hands. The cheerleaders obviously are more content being a gymnastics team than being leaders of cheers. The game plan runs like this. Each game will be an audition. Anyone who wants to be a real cheerleader can just stand up and have a go at it. Whoever gets the most cheers gets the job. We're a democratic bunch. The five­year-old gets the LaSalle game on Wednesday based on last night's show, al­though Keith Lomax, the man the crowd called 
"Magic" from Providence College also deserves a shot. 
When football comes back, perhaps this won't be necessary. The sheer number of fans in the stands and the celebration surrounding each game makes any cheerleading void barely noticeable. But during basket­ball, inside the ACC, when keeping momentum can be vital to victory, cheerleading actually can become im­portant. And those entrusted with the job apparently would rather be on stage than on the ball.

OPEC decision to cut prices will not affect costs at pump 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK-Analysts said OPEC's split decision yesterday to cut some prices for only the second time in its 25-year history is not likely to lead to immediate price cuts at the gas pump. 
And for the time being, they said, prices may level offor nudge slightly higher. 
"OPEC was responding to condi, tions on the open market, rather than leading the way," said Philip Verleger Jr., an oil industry analyst for the consulting firm of Charles River Associates. "The consumer has been able to take advantage of most of what has happened already." 
With earlier price cuts by OPEC competitors, such as Britain, Nor­way, Canada and U.S. oil companies, the average price of a gallon of gasoline has fallen 5.3 cents in the past three months, according to a recent nationwide survey by Dan Lundberg, a Los Angeles gasoline price consultant. 
Verleger said that if the industry interprets OPEC's action as a sign that the price-cutting is over, oil companies that had postponed pur­chases because of price uncertainty 
may resume buying, pushing prices up initially. 
On the New York Mercantile Ex­change, prices of contracts for future delivery of crude oil opened sharply higher after the Organiza­tion of Petroleum Exporting Countries concluded its special three-day meeting with its pricing announcement. The 27-cent rise to $25.65 a barrel in contracts for March delivery of West Texas Inter­mediate marked a rebound from a slump that earlier in the week had dragged the top U.S. grade of oil below S25 for the first time in more than five years. 
Earlier today in Geneva, Switzer­land, nine of OPEC's 13 members agreed to reduce some prices by up to S1.41 a barrel. But three members who have been pressing for holding the line on prices-Algeria, Ubya and Iran -refused to go along and Gabon abstained. Nigeria raised its prices by 65 cents, restoring part of a $2 cut implemented in October, when it broke ranks with the cartel to meet competition from Britain and Norway. 
Each $1 cut in the price of oil is equivalent to a reduction of 2% cents a gallon in the price of refined petroleum products, such as gasoline or heating oil.

the 1984 deficit topped the old mark of S69.4 billion set in 1983 and was almost three times the 1982 level of 
542.7 billion. 

The growing deficits have been blamed primarily on the strength of the U.S. dollar, which since the fall of 1980 has surged upward by more than 40 percent against major cur­rencies.

Finns find w~eCkage of Soviet missile; apology issued 
A.ssodated Press 
HELSINKI, Finland. -Finnish officials said yesterday they have found the wreckage of the Soviet missile that strayed from a military exercise last month and that the Russian words on it confirm it was a target drone, not a cruise missile. 
Pieces of the missile, hunted ever since it strayed from Soviet naval ex­ercises in the Barents Sea Dec. 28, werefound on a frozen Finnish lake. 
The missile's flight, first over a thinly populated area of northern Norway and then into Finland, where it disappeared from r~dar screens, caused a sensation when it was initially described by Nor­wegian officials as a stray cruise missile. 
"We found the nose of the missile and chunks of metal on the ice and the Russian text on them confirms that the object was a flying target," Air Force Maj. Lars Fredriksson said at a news conference. 
Finnish Air Force divers are to go beneath the frozen surface of remote Lake Inari today to hunt for the main body ofthe missile, he said. The missile is believed to be about 4 5 feet under the ice. 
"By the size of the nose I would estimate that the missile was about 10 meters (33 feet) long," Fredriksson said.

There's just no substitute for 

D
uring the Christmas holidays, I saw the Replacements in con­cert at a bar in Chicago. It was kind ofa silly show, and the band, which hails from Minneapolis, was in good spirits. The lead singer and rhythm guitarist, Paul Westerberg, kept pulling the cord out oflead guitarist Bob Stinson's guitar and running away. Bob played a solo using his shoe as a pick, the roadie sang a song, and the band, which is filled out with Bob's 18 year-old bass­playing brother Tommy and drum­mer Chris Mars, even switched instruments for a song. 
What really struck me was that these four guys were not only having a good time, but they were " 
·also playing music that is not always funny; it has some very serious moments. This delicate balance, in 
general, results in "music that mat­ters." This is exactly what the Replace­ments produce. 
They put the fun, creativity, and message ~ dearly needed back into music. Let It Be, their latest album, displays their increasingly inim­itable style ofgarage rock and shows just why hip America is beginning to have a love affair with the Replacements. 
LetIt Be begins with the single that could very well break them through to a larger audience. The song is "I Will Dare," and it has been receiving considerable expo­sure in clubs across the country. It is a lighthearted, bouncy tune about an aging man trying to arrange a rendezvous with a younger woman. He sings: 
How young areyou?

mergency --Kool and the Gang, 
the nine member band from Jersey City that appeared on the scene over fifteen years ago with a self-titled debut song, has released a new album. It is named, ofcourse, Emergency and is filled with the same combination ofsleek pop, rythym and blues and funk that has frequented the charts regularly for the last seven or so years. The band, led by bassist Robert "Kool" Bell and vocalist James Taylor (yes, a different James Taylor.), is best known for the joyous pop romp "Celebration," still a favorite at dances and parties, as well as the downright funky "Get Down on It," the reggae-tinged "Let's Go Dan­cing," the smooth middle-of-the­road R&B of"Joanna," and others like "Ladies Night," "Too Hot," and "Tonight." All these songs display the band's knack for writing irresis­table and professional songs. 

Emergency will not disappoint our Top 40 music culture. "Misled," already being heard on radios throughout the country continues the band's tradition ofdanceable, if shallow, hits. 
The album blasts open with the slam-bam title cut. "Emergency" quickly establishes a catchy hook charged by power chords and throbbing bass. Taylor's unmis­takable vocals shift into an apt and melodic verse about heavy and uncontrollable passion bordering on the suggestion ofviolence. The song is tailor-made for dance floors, but the continuous beat tends to become monotonous. 
"Fresh", an easy-going love song, follows. The song is sleekly produced and the image ofan indi­vidual being fresh like a spring day engages but flounders with the standard fare that fills the rest of the lyrics. 
How oldam/? Let's count the rings around my 
eyes 
How smart are you? 
How dumb am I? 
Don't count any ofmy advice 
The lead singer, Paul, has a ter­rific rock 'n' roller's voice: gritty yet still capable ofsensitivity and emo­tion, kind oflike Bruce Springsteen's. In "I Will Dare," he plays the old man perfectly, down to the admission that he needs someone in his life:Ain't lost yet so 
I gotta be a winner Bacon and cigarettes is a lousy dinner 
What he's saying is that he needs someone to care for him, to cook for him. He's sick ofbacon and cigarettes. Quite unusual a concern for a rock band, huh? 
It seems as if the Replacements have done some serious thinking about loneliness and despair; per­haps they've experienced more than their fair share ofit. "Sixteen Blue" is a serious song about the loneliness ofgrowing up. It is about real life, and how kids try to cope with it. In it, Westerberg sings how life can be so frustrating and boring when you're young: 
Driveyourselfright up the wall No one bears and no one calls It's a boring state It's a useless wait /know 
This last statement about knowing what it's like is a very tender one, and we know he means it. Our teenage years are the hardest ones in our life. They're filled with awkwardness, sexual ambiguity, peer pressure, and just plain boredom. All these things are ad­dressed in this song, and the result of this is a confused Westerberg saying, "I don't understand." We can feel the tension in his voice, and suddenly we remember our high school days. "Sixteen Blue" gives a realistic view about maturing, yet it shows empathy, in a way. Bob Stin­son's beautiful solo at the end practically speaks to us, and it evokes some strong emotions. No other song about youth that I know ofdoes it better. 


"Misled," the highlight of this collection, comes next. The tune's title is a pun referring to the hero's misfortune in love and to the wo­man who wreaks that havoc. Power chording gives the song its power­ful feel and irresistable dance beat. However, the group's lyrical weak­ness rears its head in a line that gave me a good laugh: She's as heavy as a Chevy!pureexcttement/~is/ed." 
"Cherish," a sweet love song, ends the side. The song is genuinely pleasant to listen to despite my dislike of the word "cherish." The lyrics foreshadow later divine refer­ences when Taylor wistfully croons: 
Ifyou receiveyour calling before I wake. This may be the next single. 
The second side explodes like the first with the hypnotic beat of "Surrender." The record's sleek production continues, and the lyrics, though still about love, take a different approach, almost as ifthe song were politically or morally motivated. 
"Bad Woman," a soulful slower song follows. The lyrics start on a bittersweet tone:Every time I see lovers look into each other's eyes, I realize the best ofmy life was you, 
but slip into confusion in the 
chorus:Bad woman, mad wo­
man/you're the only one to satisfy 
the man. I may be slow, but I find 
not even a hint ofexplanation as to 
why the woman is bad or mad. 
The album's final song is in keeping with same musical groove, but takes an interesting lyrical turn. "You Are the One" is sprightly synth funk about a different kind of love--love ofGod. The words create a new dimension to the group's music, for me anyway, which has so often relied on standard themes of love and fun. Here's an excerpt from the only lyrics printed on the album jacket: 
In the name ofthe one who's gra­dous, the one who's merciful, high and mighty, we can feel it, through yourpres­ence all around us everyday. W'ben 
we're singing, working, playing, we give praises to your name. We thank the 
Creatorfor 
blessing us with success. 


The words are touching, but the song's seven minutes runs too long. 
Kool and the Gang have as­sembled a sleekly produced pack­age of danceable ditties. There are two notes to make though. 
First, after a decade of fluffy, disposable lyrics, I find it hard to take them any more seriously than smartly-fitted dressing. That's precisely why "You Are the One" surprised me. So many oftheir 



Bulling through tt 
by Andi Schnuck 
features staff writer 
" Thefirst four seconds ofan 
interview will decide the outcome." This may seem to be an exaggeration, butJim Schaf­fer, author of"How to Get a BetterJob in Indiana-Bullish Success," believes the heart ofan interview is in the first four minutes and the greatest impact is made in the opening seconds. 
"A good beginning and closing will leave the best impression on an interviewer," Schaffer says. He notes that creativity in an interview will leave a lasting impression on the prospective employer. Schaffer uses the term "Halo effect" to describe the act ofemphasizing notable achieve­ments that will wow the inter­viewer and overshadow minor points that might detract from one's desirability as a potential employee. 
Schaffer offers these and other "new and radical" concepts in "Bullish" to provide an updated approach to a job search. He felt a fresh outlook was needed to survive in a job market flooded by new college graduates as well as newly unemployed. 
Schaffer focused on four basic problems usually encountered during an applicant's search for a job. First and most important is the applicant's ability to deal with rejection -it generally ac­companies interviewing. Self-songs have dealt with love that the 

words have become meaningless 
and indifferent. 

Second, excepting the occasional clicks of brilliance that have produced memorable songs like "Misled" and "Celebration," much of the band's material struggles to rise above mediocrity, despite danceable rythyms and pleasant melodies. 
Still, "Misled" lingers in my ears .. 
confidence is a must when 
making the rounds of interview­ing. 
Ofalmost equal importance is the need to focus one's energies. Many people head in too many directions as they consider em­ployment possibilities. A good hard look at what one wants do with his or her life is necessary to find success and happiness in the vocational world. 
One important strategy for interviewing is the use of mar­keting tactics. The applicant should "hook" the prospective employer into wanting to know more about their prospective employee. Schaffer stressed that sensitivity to the needs of the interviewing company will help the applicant to assert talents and interests according to what will best fit those needs. This gives an opportunity to demon­strate creativity while maintain­ing an image that would fit their "team." 
Although an applicant may not, at first, seem to fit the per­ceived image ofa company, Schaffer feels there are ways to react within an interview that will overcome these deficiencies. A good strong atti­tude and self-projection show the interviewer that one is seriously interested in the com­pany.

the Replacements' Let it Be 

The Replacements give an altern­ative look at another seemingly superficial topic-androgyny. "Androgynous" tells about two people, Dick and Jane, wearing clothes associated with the oppo­site sex. Dick and Jane love each other, but people laugh at them. They're happy with how they are, and as Paul Westerberg points out, "Cupie dolls and urine stalls will be laughed at the way you're laughed at now." The song doesn't encour­age androgyny per se, but it does seem to support individualism, another important theme for the Replacements. 
This theme is touched upon in "Answering Machine," a song about how machines can interfere with human communication. It poses a simple question: How to say "I love you" to an answering machine? Or "I'm lonely"? Or "good night"? Or "I miss you"? Obviously, you can't say any ofthese to a machine; only a real person will do. So Paul quiver­ingly says, "Oh, I hate your answer­ing machine." The song is solely Paul's, as he plays a powerful guitar part with no backing. The song fades with a recording ofan oper­
ator repeating itselfover and over, 
and it makes a statement on the 
difference between machines and 
humans. 
Not all ofletItBe's songs are as thought-provoking as these, but, nonetheless, they are still great. "Favorite Thing" is full ofincom­plete statements like "Yeah, I know. I love. I kill. I smoke. I drink. And I'm feeling swell." It is probably just a nonsensical song played very tightly, but it does say something. It is kind ofa love song, with its chorus of"You're my favorite thing." The playing on this song is great, and it is one of the album's more fun numbers. 
There are two really hilarious songs onLetItBe, "Tommy Gets His Tonsils Out," and "Gary's Got a Boner." "Tommy" is a visit to the local psychopathic dentist, or whoever it is who takes out tonsils. Monster guitar riffs and fast bass and drums accompany Paul Wester­berg's overanxious yellings like:

James Schaffer 
non-Beatle group from Britain to 
have a number one song in America 
-"You really Got Me," ( 1964). 
Twenty-one years later, they per­
form in three videos for M1V, one 
of which is the channel's finest. 
This group needs no further 

introduction. I'm referring, of 
course, to The Kinks. 
How does this band remain so 

strong, interesting and popular after 
over 20 years? The answer is very 
simple: Ray Davies, the lead singer 
and songwriter, is a charismatic 
genius. Musically, he's been able to 
create over two decades of 
pleasurable music. Lyrically, his wit 
and optimism are reknowned, com­
bining social satire with personal 
statements. Personally, he's able to 
win anyone to his side with his 
warm, friendly approach. His per­
sonality, more than anthing else, has 
held this group together and kept 
its audiences interested. 
And now, Ray Davies has done it again. Word ofMouth, released about a month ago, is a collection of intelligent, fun songs from rock's most accessible performer. Al­though Davies himself has been beset by personal problems (recent dissension within the band, and the recent defection ofChrissie Hynde ofthe Pretenders from his life), his lyrics remain ultimately optimistic and at times, humorous. 
Ray Davies is usually at his worst when experimenting with hard rock. Even this type ofsong succeeds to a degree on Word of Mouth. The two examples ofthis type ofsong, "Sold Me Out" and the title song, are mediocre in them­selves, but are saved by the smooth guitar work ofRay's brother Dave. 
The Kinks are at their best when Ray is mellow, the sound becomes lighter without becoming easy listening material. Here his lyrical wit shines, and he demonstates the interesting qualities of his voice. For example, "Good Day" is a quiet, nostalgic piece with an optimistic look to the future, in which his voice sounds confident and smooth. In this song, he's like a modern Dickens, creating vivid and interest­ing characters and drawing us into his world. How's this for a hit of nostalwa? 
News ofthe world, tea and biscuits in bed. 
Yesterday I took a shower 
This tainted look at dentists is played up to the max. Paul's doctor character is tense, impatient, and not very dedicated to his work. For instance, the chorus goes "Rip rip! Rip 'em out now! Rip rip! We're gonna rip 'em out now!" Not too subtle. And if you listen carefully, you can hear the patient asking the dental assistant what she's doing after the operation. You'll crack up. "Gary's Got a Boner" is pretty self­explanatory, and morals dictate that I not go any further into details. It's sufficient to say that it is really funny. And the Replacements even give partial songwriting credit to Ted Nugent, whose "Cat Scratch Fever" riff they obviously stole. 
They do perform one legitimate cover version onLetIt Be, and that is Kiss' "Black Diamond." This choice is kind ofa bow to Kiss, who really didn't make lousy music at the start oftheir career. Kiss helped to form the Replacements' trashy sense of music taste; Kiss was, at the beginning, just a garage band like the Replacements. The Replace­ments play "Black Diamond" as it's meant to be played -very loose. Gone are Peter Criss's operatic tendencies. Gone are the droning guitar chords at the end. This is minimalist garage rock. Chris Mars' drumming is perfect, and the Stin­son brothers do it right, too. Paul Westerberg's singing comes close to masterpiece quality. At one point, he sings the word "thumb," as in "they got you under their...", in a way that I wish I could frame. This song is done so well, it doesn't even sound like a cover version. Quite impressive. 

As you might have guessed, I really like this album. I think that only Bruce Springsteen's Born in the U.SA. surpasses it as the best album of 1984.LetItBe hits home in so many ways that it is hard to resist. It is both tender and hard­rocking, and always inspired. Bands of this caliber are rare, and they represent the small minority of good American rock 'n' roll bands. See if you can findLet It Be where you live, and ifyou can't, please write their record company at: Twin/Tone Records, 445 Oliver Ave. So., Minneapolis, MN 55405.

That last line is delivered in a quiet, confidential voice, as if he's whispering it in our ears. Later, he states that "Today is gonna be a good day." He's going to make it a good day. Ray loves the past, but always keeps an eye on the future. 
Musical pleasantry and fine he becomes too sentimental. The song is very short, but stands out as one ofRay Davie's great mistakes. 
The album bounces back with "Summer's Gone," a song which seems contradictory in theme to "Good Day" but is interesting musi­cally. "Going Solo" is a brilliant piece of music, a song as good as any he's done in the eighties, with the possible exception of "Too Hot." 
Even Dave, in the two songs he's written for the album, appears in fine form here. His song "Guilty," 

lyricism meet in the album's greatest success, "Too Hot." Ray complains here ofthe intensifica­tion ofcity life, the building pre­ssures which confront the individual, which he humorously links to the recent "workout" craze. 
Sleazy toum gets me doum. Want 
somepeace and quiet. 
Thepoliceare everywhere, like 
there's gonna be a riot. 
But back at the gymnasium, they're 
trainingfor a war. Think ofall thefun we bad in 
1984. 
The one great weakness in the album is the song "Missing Per­sons." Ray mawkishly sings ofthe departure of Chrissie Hynde. Al­though his personal approach is almost always effective, in this song like "Sold Me Out," is weak in itself 

but is strengthened by great guitar 
work. His other song, "Uving on a Thin Une," is good simply because it sounds much like Ray's work. His voice is dropped down from its usual screech in this work and its theme recalls some of the group's work from the sixties, with refer­ences to "kings in days ofold," reminiscent of"Victoria." 
The Kinks make great music as they have for over twenty years. It's the personality ofRay Davies that makes the group a legend in its own time. He's an extremely likeable person and a terrific showman. It is this warm, absorbing personality that has kept the Kinks musically active and important after two decades ofwork.

Sharon vs. Time sets a dangerous precedent 
A few days ago, a landmark case involving journalism was settled. After digesting a 64­page charge and deliberating for considerable time, a jury ruled that Time magazine, while 
John Perez 
just wondering 
negligent in checking the accuracy of its reporting, had not libeled former Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon in a Feb. 21, 1983 cover story regarding an official Israeli government report on the 1982 mass murder of several hundred Palestinian refugees in Beirut, Lebanon. 
The $50 million lawsuit centered on one paragraph in the eight-page story. The passage stated that "Sharon told (Lebanese officials) that he expected (military) forces to go into the refugee camps and . _ _that there was a need to take revenge for" the then-recent as­sassination ofLebanese President-elect Rashir Gemayel. In effect. alkged Sharon, the Time story implied that he bore "indirect responsi­bility" for the massacre and thus tarnished his reputation. 
The trial itself was extremt"ly unu~ual, as both plaintiff and defendant claimed that Is­raeli security measures denied them access to information vital to their respective cases_ An­other oddity was the fact that the jury, instead of returning a guilty or not-gulity verdict, had to rule on three issues: First, could the aforementioned passage be interpreted as defaming Sharon? Second, was the content of the paragraph false? Finally, did Time print the item with a "high level of awareness" of its falsity? The jury answered "yes" to the first 
two, "no" to  the third. The magazine  was  
found not guilty.  
Regardless  of  the  outcome,  the  

Sharon/Time case sets a dangerous precedent. Every time a politician, foreign or domestic, disagrees with something reported by the news media, he could conceivably sue and then orchestrate the suppression of evidence on "security" grounds. "I don't see why (controversial Libyan leader) Muammar Khadaffi can't sue and then say every piece of evidence is a state secret," said Time Inc.'s chief defense counsel Thomas Barr. 
This entire debacle calls into question the role ofthe news media in today's world. In my opinion it has never changed: to inform the general public about what is going on and how it affects them_ Granted, modern technol­ogy has drastically changed the methodology of news-gathering over the years, but the ul­timate objective remains the same. Ofcourse, the media is obligated to accomplish this task in as objective and impartial manner as possi­ble. 
The journalistic profession has always been largely self-regulating_ Does the Sharon case, and others similar to it like Weshnoreland vs. CBS, mean that the media needs more regula­tion? Do we need a watchdog agency to keep an eye over the press?Absolutely not! 
Let's face it: public figures such as generals, presidents and dictators are all adults now. They're heavy hitters in the na­tional/international spotlight. They're in the big leagues now. Assuming that the press satisfies its responsibility to be fair, accurate and impartial, these public figures have noth­ing to snivel and whine about. By doing so, they only succeed in showing their childish nature to the world, sort of like the Little Leaguer who threatens to go home and take the only baseball bat unless he gets to bat leadoff and play whatever position he wants. 
Public figures are exactly that: public. Everyone should be accountable for their ac­tions. Why should such persons be any differ­ent? IfSharon had asked me for advice, I would have made it brief: grow up.

P.O.BoxQ 
Mother Theresa is a blessing not a curse 
Dear Editor: 
Ann Pettifer's column on Mother Theresa and the Bhopal disaster made me realize how easily a person's actions can be misconstrued by the ignorant. Pettifer begins by saying Mother Theresa is a pup­pet of the Indian government and then proceeds to tell usJesus Christ denounced capitalism. After this, she refutes the Church's authority to create dogma and doctrine and ends by telling us that spiri­tual attributes such as piety and charity are doomed to become extinct. Her untruths are so numerous that I can only address the more blatant ones. 
First, Pettifer states, "Mother Theresa is an example ofa Catholic spirituality which has divided and betrayed the vigorous con­frontation with power thatJesus displayed and which took him to the cross." Jesus vigorously confronted people who used their religiousposition to amass power and wealth along with the people who dese­crated the temple. But he treated the other wealthy and politically powerful people with the same love and understanding with which he treated the crippled, poor, or­phaned and widowed. It was not Jesus' confrontation with power that took him to the cross but mankind's sins such as mur­der, stealing, lying, adultery, sodomy and abortion_ 
Second, Pettifer deqounces the Church's ability to create dogma and doctrine. She says, "The Gospel, properly preached, is matchless." We must realize the Church is built on both the Gospel and tradition -tradition which is manifested by dogma and doctrine. The Gospel is beauti­ful but, as is obvious in the Protestant religions, if it is your sole source offaith it can become splintered into numerous in­terpretations by many people and contain no prescription by which to guide your life. Yes, the Church is structured into a hierarchy, but it is a necessary hierarchy used to administer the sacraments of Christ. Christ sanctioned this hierarchy when he gave Peter the keys ofthe Church. 
Third, Peuifer spews on about the lack of female role models in the church, and the clergy's endless obsession "concerning the state of Mary's hymen." She obviously has no understanding of Mary's prophetic role in the history of the Church. Mary, a female, was the greatest human being to have ever lived. Throughout history -at Lourdes, Mt. Carmel and Fatima-she has 
made God's wishes known to mankind. She is the Queen of Heaven and it is her life of obedience, piety and chasity which has shaped the model for all religious people and laity to follow. Her following of Christ's example gives hope to all mankind to live as Christ taught us to live. Mary was also the only person to have been consumed bodily into heaven. 
Pettifer ends her article by saying, "To end on a more hopeful note-it is becoming increasingly clear that Mother Theresa's spirituality will take its place eventually alongside the dinosaur." Well, I hope the day never comes when God no longer blesses us with examples such as Mother Theresa and the stigmatists Padre Pio and Bro. Gino to give us hope in this world.

Boudreax unaware of what ND offers 
Dear Editor: 
I am disturbed by an article that Charles Boudreaux wrote for Tbe Observer on Jan_ 
28. He speaks out rather strongly against the University of Notre Dame's annual plea for funds, denouncing Father Hesburgh's description ofthe administration as "active agents in Notre Dame's destiny," and "co­creators." 
I would like to know from whom Bou~aux thinks he is getting his educa­tion_ He refers to the appeal for donations as "false advertising." I would therefore refer to Boudreaux's degree upon gradua­tion as false advertising -ifthe University is as superficial as he seems to think. 
As a senior, I can look back on my four years here and recognize administration policies and actions with which I disagree. However, the education which I have 
received, both intellectually and emotion­
ally, allow me to put those dissentions into 
perspective. I am more aware ofinjustices 
and values than ever before. Moreover, I 
feel prepared to face the "real" world. I 
strongly resent being referred to as "a 
forty-thousand-dollar sheepskin glossed 
over with social service and moral or ethi­
cal platitudes." The person I have become 
is something I can be proud of, and I owe 
that in part to Notre Dame. Boudreaux is 
obviously unaware of the major social and 
ethical effects Notre Dame and its 
graduates have had upon this world. 
The University is not run by parents, nor by students, nor by the administration. It is ·a unique combination ofall three that per­mits a learning environment permeated by 
spiritual discovery and growth. And 
regardless of how it is run, it cannot be 
done without money. This is, quite simply, 
a fact. The donations that Notre Dame 
receives are not required dues; they are money put forth by people who under­stand this school's unsurpassed specialness and unique atmosphere. Does Boudreaux plan to drain the University ofeverything it has to offer, then leave with an education most people can only dream of, without so much as a goodbye or a thank you? It would not surprise me. My father would call him a hypocritical opportunist -and so would I.

Gary Voce emerges from shadows to contribute much to Irish team 
ByPHRWOLF 
AssistantSports Editor 
It is hard to imagine a 6-9 person becoming lost in the shadow ofa six­footer, but when one considers that the shadow is that of David Rivers, a figure who stands larger than life on the Notre Dame basketball team, it is easier to picture. 
With all of the commotion sur­rounding the arrival of Rivers last fall, three other freshmen on the Irish squad were nearly forgotten. Among these three "forgotten" players was Gary Voce, a 6-9, 235­pounder from the Bronx, N.Y. 
Voce has accepted his role this year. A coach can ask for little more than a player who knows what is expected of him and then delivers on that ex­pectation as Voce has. 
"He's got to become a player for 
us," Phelps says. "The potential's 
there, and he's just got to get the 
game experience. By the time he's a 
junior, he should be able to step 
right in." 
That necessary playing time 
comes slowly, though, and Voce says 
sitting on the bench was the biggest 
adjustment he had to make coming 
to Notre Dame after starting on his 
high school team for three years. 
"I guess that's pretty hard to ac­cept at first," Voce says with an honesty that is manifest in his quiet tone, "but you just look down the road and see that everyone does it; you've got to go through it. So that's the role for this year, and next year I hope to be playing a lot more. And junior year it's up to me, I guess, be­cause there won't be anybody else in front of me." 
Voce seems to be at the age at which he is young enough to believe that he can do anything ifhe puts his mind to it and mature enough to ac­cept the criticism and limitations given him by his coaches. He modestly states that he thinks he is a good rebounder and inside scorer, but when asked about his weaknes­ses, he recites Phelps' criticisms. 
"My weakness is lack of consis­tency and aggressiveness sometimes," he says. "Coach says I fall into lapses and I can play hard for probably only a two-minute spurt. 
He says this, not me." 
Voce recognizes, however, the importance of impressing his coach with his ability and his effort. 
"Some games, I'll get in and find out that nothing's going right for the first two minutes or so," he explains. "And I'm not going to be in there for too long, so I hope that for the few minutes I'm in there, it's going to start working right off the bat." 
When things do fall into place for the big man, impressive things can happen, as he showed against St. Francis and Valparaiso. It seems as though Voce has a knack for corning up with a big play when he is in the game. Indeed, as Phelps points out, the native ofJamaica has a knack for the game of basketball, which he didn't begin playing until he was 13.

Despite the fact that Rivers received most of the attention from the public early in the season, the Irish coaches knew that they had a player that they could count on in Voce. He has seen playing time in every one ofNotre Dame's 16 games so far this season. 
Voce has averaged only about nine minutes in those games, but he has learned to live with his role as a substitute player. He has come off the bench to lead the team in scoring on two occasions. He pumped in 17 points and grabbed 1S rebounds against St. Francis, and he led the Irish over Valparaiso with 14 points and 13 rebounds. Still, Voce knows that this is not his year to lead the team. 
"All I can really do this year," he admits, "is work as hard as I can at practice to help the team to get bet­ter and be ready when I'm called upon. I won't be the deciding factor in a game, but I can help the team win a game by practicing hard and helping to get the team pumped up." 
Head Coach Digger Phelps says he couldn't be happier with the way 
"This kid's a raw talent," Phelps says. "He wasn't, three years old, out there dribbling on the streets. He was out in Kingston, jamaica, having pina coladas." 
Although Phelps' account is em­bellished a little bit, the underlying point is clear: Voce still is at an early stage in his career. He certainly has come a long way since his friends in seventh grade tried to interest him in using his then 6-6 frame to play basketball, but his full potential is just now being tapped. It's just a mat­ter ofgetting game experience. 
So what of playing in the shadow of David Rivers? Does it bother Voce? No. 
In fact, Rivers and Voce have been good friends since they met last year. Rivers has nothing but praise for his classmate, and Voce sits back and takes it with a humble smile. 
Of course, it's only a matter of time before Voce could be regularly on the end of Rivers' fast-break passes. The two friends may eventu­ally cast quite a large shadow to­gether.

In Tuesday's interhall basketball action, Dillon moved into a two-way tie for first place in the ACC, while Grace remained unbeaten atop the Big Ten and Off-Campus earned its first win of the year in the Pac Ten. 
In a hard fought, overtime struggle, Dillon ( 4-1) was able to earn a share of the ACC leadership by defeating Alumni ( 2-3 ), 4 7-4 3. 
The win puts Dillon in a two-way tie with Flanner for first while the Alumni loss places it in sixth place.

a 61-47 romp ofOff-Campus ( 3-2 ). 
In Big Ten action on Tuesday Grace (5-0) maintained its first­place status with a 63-60 win over DilJon ( 3-2 ). 
In one other Big Ten game, Holy Cross ( 2-3) was able to overcome a two-point halftime deficit to defeat Alumni ( 2-3), 49-45. 
Meanwhile in the Pac Ten, Flanner ( 2-3) led Grace ( 4-1 ) by three into the final period ofplay but Grace was able to turn the tables and come away with a four-point win. 
In one other Pac Ten game, the battle of the defeated, Off-Campus ( 1-4) was able to earn its first victory 
that we wanted to be within five or six points with five minutes left," said Grawer. "That way we thought we'd be in position to win the game." 
Hicks, commg ott the bench for 22 minutes of play, hit on 4 of 6 at­tempts from the floor and was per­fect from the line enroute to a 10-point game. Freshman point guard David Rivers lead the Irish with twelve points, while Barlow and sophomore Donald Royal both hit for 11 points. 
of the year, the win came at the ex­pense ofwinless Fisher ( 0-5 ). 
In ACC action today, Carroll ( 0-4) will be playing Cavanaugh ( 0-4 ), and if Cavanaugh loses this one, it will get another shot for its first victory when it takes on Alumni ( 2-3 ). 
In Big Ten action, undefeated Grace will put its uncontested first­place status on the line when it plays Alumni ( 2-3) while Off-Campus ( 2­
3) faces Dillon (3-2). 
Grace ( 4-1 ) will try to move to within a half-game of front-running Sorin (5-0) in the Pac Ten when it squares off against Fisher (0-5). Flanner ( 2-3) will take on Stanford (2-3). 
With Tim Kempton in the infir­mary with the flu, both Barlow and Royal were forced to play most of the game, with Barlow playing the full40 minutes and Royal getting 38. 
Besides Hicks' 1 0 points, the rest of the Irish bench was almost silent. Senior Dan Duff took one ofhis rare shots, a 15-footer from the foul line, and hit it, but that was it from the bench. For the Irish it was an no­enthused performance, but a win is a win, and with UCLA on Sunday in Pauley Pavillion the extra "W" is all that counts.

Every athlete strives to play to the best of his or her abilities. Gaining recognition from coaches and fans can give the athlete added satisfac­tion for the effort put forth. 
Two freshmen hockey players have discovered that hard work can make the adjustment to the college hockey environment both beneficial and enjoyable. 
Of the seven freshmen who have seen action thus far with this season's Notre Dame hockey team, Mike McNeill and Tom Mooney have stood out above the crowd. 
Both are centers and both are in the top five on the Irish scoring chart, where they have been from the beginning of the campaign. 
McNeill, a 6-1, 1 75-pounder from South Bend St.Joseph's High School, recently jumped ahead of Mooney into the fourth spot by virtue of his two-goal and three-assist perfor­mance against Lake Forest on jan. 
23. In 19 games, McNeill has notched 12 goals and 1 5 assists. 
Mooney, a native ofthe Pittsburgh area, stands 5-11 and weighs 180 pounds. He has tallied 26 points, with II goals to his credit. 
Neither Mooney nor McNeill flaunts his achievements. But at the same time, both are extremely proud to be contributing to the team at such an early point in their careers. And each expresses his feelings in his own modest way. 
"It makes me feel great," says Mooney, "because in the beginning, I was just happy to make the team. I didn't know ifI was good enough, so I was really scared about the situa­tion at first." 
"Things are going well," adds McNeill. "I get a lot ofhelp from my teammates and that makes it easier. My goal is to keep improving as a player. 'Ibe points aren't the most important factor. I want to remain a team player." 
i., 
Despite their hard work and de­termination on the ice, both Mooney and McNeill are actually ex­tremely shy and quiet while away from the game. Both seem to have found a way to successfully separate the two different parts of their lives. 

"I really am a shy person," says McNeill with a slight grin. "I have a hard time sitting down and really talking to someone. I think in a way, this attitude carries over to the ice, but not in such a way that I am afraid to play my game. I can change enough to be outgoing and ag­gressive when I play." 
"Well, yes I am pretty quiet offthe ice," Mooney responds politely. "But I do change when I'm playing. Actually, J prefer rough games to skating games." 
Mooney is not a regular visitor to the penalty box, but he has made 10 trips in that direction this season. And he has also demonstrated that he can effectively throw his weight around. A Hartford writer cited a crunching check delivered by Mooney against a Yale player ­
'· 
('. during the Phoenix Mutual -as the best check of the tourney. McNeill on the other hand, has had just two penalties, but that is in part due to different strengths and

i. styles ofplay. 

"I try to anticipate things," says McNeill. "I feel comfortable playing hockey and I like to believe that be­cause of my understanding of the game, I can be a smooth player." 
"The line I'm on now is more of a grinder line," says Mooney, who was moved before the Alaska-Fairbanks
