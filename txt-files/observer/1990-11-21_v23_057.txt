between Dec. 25 and March 25, but Information Minister Latif Nassiyif Jassim indicated Monday that some might be al­lowed to leave earlier. 
A Dutch company reported Tuesday that 122 Dutch, Belgian and British nationals who had just completed a dredging project for the Iraqi government would soon leave. 
And the government indicated it would free an unspecified number of other Europeans in response to visits by a Swiss delegation and a group of European parliament members headed by Jean-Marie Le Pen of France. 

The Western allies have ac­cused Saddam of trying to use the hostage issue to try to split the alliance assembled against him after the Aug. 2 occupation of Kuwait. 
Parliament speaker Saadi Mahdi Saleh said there were 124 Germans remaining in Iraq and Kuwait. No specific ar­rangements were made for their departure.

Counselors discuss ways to aid victims of emotional abuse 
By DANNIKA SIMPSON 
News Writer 
Victims of verbal and emo­tional ahus1! arn all'netnd just as much. if not more, than victims of physical abusn and they often develop a tolnrance to pain. according to Sally Cole­man, the Coordinator of Addi­tion SPrvices at thn Univnrsity Couns111ing Center. 
"Victims d11velop survival skills which we view as gifts," she said. 
Coleman and Wendy Settle, also of the University Counsel­ing Center, lectured on abusive r11lationships Tuesday, giving characteristics of victims and offering victims ways to seek help and break the cycle of abuse. 
Coleman said what happens to the victim over time is that they become numb to their feel­ings and bodies. "When we be­come numb to our bodies ... we don't know what we feel." 
Victims of abuse distance themselves from their pain by learning to "split off emotion­ally" and by separating them­selves from the pain to survive, Coleman said. She called this "euphoric recall." When in this state of mind, the victim only remembers the good parts of a relationship, she said. 
Settle said the victim can only · see the loving side of abuser, not the mean side. 
Coleman said it is a myth that victims want to stay in abusive relationships. "Victims do want to change but don't have the tools." She said victims become powerless to leave these types of relationships because they have been belittled for so long. The victim often has little self confidence and may feel they will be alone if they leave the relationship. "Just by wanting to stop it (the abuse), you can't 

· stop it." 
According to Coleman, an­other reason the victim is un­able to leave an abusive rela­tionship is that he or she often feels it is his or her fault for being victimi7;ed and may feel "trapped, helpless, and hope­less." It is not, however, the vic­tim's fault that he or she is abused, Coleman said. "Victims do not ask to be victimized." 
Settle explained the relation­ship between a victim and vic­timizer in terms of The Stock­holm Syndrome Theory which was developed by Dee Graham of the University of Cincinnati Counseling Center. 
Settle said The Stockholm Theory was developed from a study of bank robbers and the the people they took hostage in Sweden in 1973. The re­searchers found that the vic­tims and their captives "bonded" with one another

Conservatives battle Thatcher's bid for reelection as party leader 
LONDON (AP) The Conservative Party on Tuesday staggered Prime Mininster Margaret Thatcher with faint support, forcing her into a sec­ond round of balloting in a fight for leadership of party and country. 
Thatcher fell two votes short of defeating the sternest chal­lenge of her 11 1/2 years as party leader, but she rejected calls by some to step down and vowed to battle on in a second round of voting next Tuesday. 
·Thatcher reacts/page 6 
If Thatcher loses the leader­ship of the party, she would step down as prime minister. The Conservatives have a ma­jority in the 650-seat House of Commons. 
The opposition Labor Party moved to capitalize on the tur­moil in Conservative ranks by tabling a motion of no confi­dence in the government. That motion, likely to come to a vote before Tuesday, would bring months. 
Heseltine also focused his campaign on Thatcher's atti­tude toward Europe, which has caused strains within her party. 
Heseltine, standing hand-in­hand with his wife, Anne, out­side their home, told reporters: "I am overwhelmed with grati­tude. to my parliamentary col­leagues who in such large mea­sure have given me their sup­port."

DART mess is a case for more classes 
I heard a nasty ru­mor. 
I was on the tele­phone with my mother the other day, trying to e;Xplain why I'm only re'gistered for three classes next 


semester. I'd finally Alison Cocks convinced her that senioritis wasn't the Editor-in-Chief reason, that I was actually closed out of two classes in my major and several in other departments. 
She pointed out (gasp!) that I'm here to GET AN EDUCATION. We're not paying $16,000 for season football tickets. Frankly, I was shocked. 
If I were here to get an education, then surely as a second semester senior I'd be able to register for any class I wanted to take. Or at least most of them. And if I were closed out of one, I'd have enough good al­ternatives to end up with a fulfilling sched­ule anyway. 
Since I can't do that, even as a senior, I can't quite believe her. I challenged her, suggesting that maybe I'm actually here to fight the good fight during course registra­tion while Notre Dame becomes a great re­search university and the Arts and Letters faculty overload themselves with their classes and the pressure to "publish or per­ish." 
She conceded that while her theory sounded better, mine was probably closer to the mark. Then she asked me why she should pay the bill if this is the case. 
Aside from my purely emotional desire to graduate this May, I couldn't think of one she'd understand. My mother went to school in the 60s, and she can't quite grasp the idea that in modern times, money doesn't guarantee an education. 
Since she's the one signing the check, she has this crazy notion that there's a certain amount she can expect in return for her $16,000--a daughter taking classes she likes, for example. 
I must admit this whole scenario sounded pretty good. I've already spent two years in the College of Arts and Letters taking filler classes. One or two years of worthwhile classes doesn't seem unreasonable at this stage. 
Fortunately, three classes is one more than I need to graduate. If I needed five, I'd be scrambling. I know of plenty of others who are. One friend of mine has been closed out of the same course four times. 
I'd therefore like to offer the following modest proposal: the University can take the tuition I've paid since I've been here and subtract what my education has actually been worth. 
The difference would pay the salaries of several new Arts and Letters professors, who could, in turn, teach a few more quality classes. Then next year's students might pay $16,000 for something that's actually worth that amount.

Soviets say U.N. should reconsider Iraq decision I 
Sunbather 
AP Photo 

PAHIS (AP) -The Soviet Union said Tuesday the U.N. Security Council should "take stock" of its sanctions against Iraq and decide whether a new course of action is necessary. But the Soviets again rebuffed President Bush's efforts to rally support for a resolution autho­rizing military force. 
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, emerg­ing from a 90-minute meeting with Sncretary of State James Baker, told reporters. "We need to consult with our colleagues and partners in the Security Council." 
But he stopped considerably short of backing any measure that would advocate the use of force. 
Shevardnaze said the council should "take stock of things and pass appropriate judgment on what it has been doing." 
Then, if necessary, he said, the body should "adopt new resolutions with a view to im­plementing all the previous de­cisions." 
Baker had been pressing a last ditch effort to strike a deal before Bush's trip to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday. However, the Soviet leader's statement indicated that the two sides were still far apart. 

Even so, Baker said, "The United States and the Soviet Union have been united in their approach to thh; problem" since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. "We are united today.

We intend to remain united," he added. 
As the Paris summit wound down its second day, both U.S. and Soviet officials unveiled plans for a superpower summit in Moscow early next year to sign a treaty on reducing long­range nuclear weapons. 
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said there was no firm date for the summit, although he said both countries were shooting for January. Fitzwater said having a nuclear arms treaty to sign was a prerequisite for the summit, but holding the session in January "is what we have been talking about and shooting for."

NO Air Force ROTC wins its third 'Right of Line' award as best unit in country 
Special to the Observer 
The University of Notre Dame Air Force ROTC detachment was recognized as the nation's top Air Force ROTC unit in a special ceremony at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama. 
The "Right of Line" award was presented by Brig. Gen. Robin Tornow. the commandant of Air Force ROTC, and caps a banner year for the Notre Dame detachment. Previously they had been award the Air Force Organizational Excellence Award, citing the unit's outstanding recruiting and training programs.

Baker and Shevardnadze meet­ing, Fitzwater said it seemed "very unlikely" that support could be rallied for a resolution to step up pressure before the president's trip to the Middle East. 
The United States is seeking a new resolution giving advance authority to using military ac­tion to drive Iraq's Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait, although officials said exact language has not yet been drafted. 
Shevardnadze, in effect, agreed that the matter should be reopened by the United Nations -but declined to go beyond that.

The Right of Line award is the third received by the Notre Dame unit in the past eight years, an accomplishment un­matched at any other univer­sity. 
The award reflects the out­standing training given the cadets as well as the superb motivation and academic apti­tude of the students enrolled in the programs, according to Col. Howard Hanson. the detach­ment commander. 
He also credited the outstand­ing support provided by the University of Notre Dame. "We're proud of our cadets. proud of our training, proud to

Heseltine forced the issue by winning barely enough votes to deny Thatcher a first-ballot victory in an unprecedented ballot among the 372 Conservative members of the House of Commons. 
Because 16 lawmakers ab­stained, Thatcher needed 206 votes, or 15 percent, but re­ceived 204. Heseltine received 152. 
In the second round, a simple majority can win, but other candidates are now free to join the race. If necessary, a third and final ballot would be held Nov. 29. 
Partisans on each side urged the other to give up. But Thatcher inevitably faced pres­sure to resign rather than end her career in defeat. 
"The party is obviously. in trouble, and there is no point in hiding it," said Teddy Taylor, one of Thatcher's most outspo­ken supporters in the House. He urged her to continue. 
"I suspect she may have polled her maximum number of votes today," said Conservative legislator Ivor Stanbrook, who supported Heseltine. 
'I am absolutely astonished that he got so many and that so many of my colleagues should have been so disloyal," Conservative lawmaker Ivan Lawrence said on Sky Television.

Space sh.uttle returns smoothly 
I and safely to Cape Canaveral 
CAPE CANAVERAL. Fla. (AP) -Atlantis and its five astro­nauts glided to an smooth landing in Florida today, be­coming the first shuttle crew to touch down at the Kennedy Space Center in five years. 
It was the sixth time a space shuttle has landed here. The last time was in 1985, when Discovery blew a tire, but to­day's landing on the pave'd runway was smooth. 
Atlantis swooped through a brilliant blue sky, accompanied by the customary twin sonic booms, and touched down at 
4:43 p.m. EST after circling the world 80 times. 
Atlantis was diverted to Kennedy by wind and damp runways at its California desert landing site. 

"Welcome home. It sure was a beautiful sight," Mission · Control told the crew. 
The descent began about an hour earlier when Atlantis' commander Richard Covey and pilot Frank Culbertson Jr. fired the shuttle's twin braking rock­ets. The firings reduced the spaceship's speed by 156 mph and sent it gliding toward Florida. 

Workers at Kennedy had to scramble to prepare for the landing, assembling a convoy of support vehicles and bringing in extra personnel. 
"There's no nervousness in­volved," said Bruce Buckingham, a Kennedy spokesman. "We've got every­body in place making preps for this. It's just a matter of im­plementing our plans." 
Late Monday, showers moved across the Mojave Desert base, dampening the lake bed run­ways. About a quarter-inch of rain fell on the hard-packed desert floor, stopping before sunrise. 
The Air Force checked the runways and determined they were unsuitable for landing, said NASA spokeswoman Nancy Lovato. The concrete runway would have been the only one open at Edwards today and probably Wednesday. 
The outlook appeared to be no better at Edwards on Wednesday, prompting NASA officials to choose Kennedy as a landing site today. The sky over Kennedy was clear today, and winds were well within landing limits. 
Atlantis, whose five astro­nauts put a spy satellite in orbit during the Pentagon's last se­cret shuttle mission, has enough power and supplies to stay in space until Thursday, said Randy Stone, chief of the flight director's office. The shuttle was launched from Kennedy last Tqursday night. 
The three-mile runway at Kennedy provides less room for maneuvering than the wide­open desert and the weather there is usually more unstable. 
'Discovery, the last shuttle to use the Kennedy runway, blew a tire and sustained brake dam­age during landing in 1985. 
On Monday, NASA had to call off the landing attempt minutes before the shuttle was to begin its fiery plunge to Earth. 
"The weather, as it sometimes does, pulled a dirty trick on us," Stone said.

The victim may think the abuser will phys­ically harm them if they decide to leave. "(The victims often say) If I leave, he might hurt me really bad. I'd rather stay," Set­tle said. 
Coleman and Settle said vic­tims of emotional, sexual, and verbal abuse may exhibit ex­treme shame and guilt and may "doubt their ability to love and be loved."

Milli Vanilli: Blame it on the 'pact with the devil' 
LOS ANGELES (AP) -The Milli Vanilli duo said today they made a "pact with the devil" when they pretended they sang on a hit album, and they contended it was all with the knowledge of their record company. 
"We were scared. People threatened us," said Milli Vanilli member Rob Pilatus at a news conference today. "(But) we're happy that it's over." 
Pilatus declined to say who threatened him and partner Fabrice Morvan. But he said Arista Records President Clive Davis knew about the deception that has rocked the pop music industry. Arista has denied the allegation. 
"Arista Records and their executives did not know that Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan did not sing on the Milli Vanilli album, and any assertions to the contrary are false and libelous," the company said in a statement today. 
Milli Vanilli was-stripped of its Grammy on Monday, the first act forced to return a Grammy in the 34-year history of the award. 
The National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences re­scinded the 1989 best new artist Grammy, one day before the two planned to surrender the honor. 
Pilatus said the album gave them. fame and fortune, but it came at a high cost. He said they were seduced by the money and success because they were poor and living in a Munich housing project. 
"You get something, for that you make a pact with the devil," said Pilatus. 
Goaded by the media to prove they could sing, Pilatus cursed and said, ''I'll do it." The two then burst into a few lines from the song "Girl, You Know It's True" from their the best-selling album by the same name. 
The duo admitted last week that they did not sing a note on the album. They also lip­synced at concerts and on the Grammy awards show in February. The album sold about 7 million copies. 
Pilatus, 25, from Germany, and Morvan, also 25 and a native of the Caribbean island of Guadaloupe, were stripped of its best new artist Grammy Award following revelations that other singers substituted for the pop duo on "Girl, You Know It's True." 
"This. is the first time this has ever happened" in Grammy history, academy president Michael Greene said. "I do think it's an isolated incident. We are as upset about it as the public has the right to be." 
Greene said academy trustees voted overwhelmingly to take back the award. A decision on what to do with it will be made by an academy subcommittee Dec. 5. 
Greene said the duo's wish that it be given to the three singers who actually sang was "not a possibility." 
The academy recognizes "packaging" groups is part of the music industry, Greene said. But misleading record labels are unacceptable, he said. The album label "said 'Vocals: Rob and Fab.' That was just absolutely false," he said. 

ing and returning." They en­couraged anyone who has these feelings to seek help. 
They told victims of abuse to be gentle with themselves dur­ing the process of recovery, to ask for and accept compli­ments. Coleman also suggested victims think about the rela­tionship, do good things for themselves daily, and realize that they deserve respect. "Thinking gives back power ... Just by acknowledging you de­serve respect, you can hold on to that power." 
She told victims to "create safe places and times" for themselves in which they can think about what they want from a relationship and decide what makes them happy. 
Coleman also told victims not to be discouraged if change does not occur overnight. She said victims often become dis­couraged and disappointed when they do no experience a change immediately. "Victims get well, exceeding well, all the time. What happens is a pro­cess. It doesn't happen overnight," said Coleman. 
Victims must learn, Coleman said, "We have the right not to be hurt, we have the right to make mistakes, and we have the right to be imperfect." 
When and if victims decide to get help, Coleman said they must also remember, "To do this alone is not the answer."

Thatcher pledges to fight for leadership 
PARIS (AP) -British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher waited only a few minutes Tuesday to declare that she would fight on in a contest for the leadership of Britain and the Conservative Party. 
"I am naturally very pleased that I got more than half the parliamentary party and disap­pointed that it is not quite enough to win on the first bal­lot," she told reporters outside the British Embassy, where she had received news of the voting of party parliamentarians in London. 
"So I confirm that it is my in­tention to let my name go for­ward to the second ballot," she added, appearing determined and composed. 
Thatcher failed by only two votes to gain a first-round vic­tory over former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine. She received 204 votes, Heseltine gained 152 and 16 Conservatives abstained. A first-ballot victory required 206 votes; but a candidate needs only a majority to win in the second round next Tuesday. 
Thatcher, who was in Paris for a European summit, was expected to come under pres­sure from some of her allies to step down rather than prolong the contest. The opposition Labor Party also sought to take advantage of the political in­fighting by proposing a motion of no confidence in her gov­ernment. 
After talking very briefly to reporters, she went back into the Embassy. She had earlier warned her host, President Francois Mitterrand, that she might be a little late for the evening's entertainment in Versailles. 
Earlier, Europe's longest­serving prime minister had busied herself with top-level meetings and, according to sources close to her, avoided telephoning London for updates on the election.

My large thanks to the Notre lowed Pentagon warriors on who run his country. If Martin Dame community for its hospi­campus, I thought he might Luther King was right, that the "greatest purveyor of violence in the world today (is) my own government," then why serve the people who run that gov­ernment and sanction its cur­rent spending of $800 million a day on military programs of death? 
What if, instead of having the Pentagon, the National Abortion Rights Action League, was allowed in? Would there be any difference in its arguments and the ROTC's? NAHAL would be here to teach leadership skills in running abortion clin­ics, as well as the just-abortion theory. NAHAL would provide faculty and buildings, give money and scholarships to stu­dents and require only four years of patriotic service in an abortion clinic after graduation. ROTC claims it is not pro-war, and NAHAL says it is not pro­abortion. Both are pro-choice. They just want to be ready in case war-the killing of enemy life-must be the last resort and in case abortion, the killing of fetal life-is another last resort. 
If the Pentagon is different from NAHAL, it's because of its larger firepower. It has nukes enough to abort the whole planet. 
Those Holy Cross-Holy Sword-priests who continue to accept Pentagon money in ex­change for access to Notre Dame students aren't the prob­lem. Nor are the ROTC generals and colonels the problem, much less the undergraduates, many of whom are strapped and en­dure the military only tor money. I'm the problem. All those who oppose ROTC are the problem. We haven't worked hard enough, or risked enough, to persuade our brothers and sisters that teaching or studying the ways of war has no place on any campus, where the force of ideas, not the force of violence, is to be learned. 
I admire the Pentagon im­mensely. It has pulled off one of the greatest cons in history: persuading priests at Notre Dame to let militarists come in to teach 10 percent of the stu­dents how to violate the core

Dear Editor: 
I am so tired of hearing peo­ple come to the "defense" of ROTC programs because "otherwise poor people would not be able to attend Notre Dame." Coleman McCarthy im­plied that ROTC is comprised mainly of lower class, under­privileged waifs who compro­mise their principles to afford colleg~ without burdening their families. That is so untrue. A great many ROTC cadets and midshipmen have parents in the military, and are following a proud family tradition of serv­ing their country. I can count on one hand the number of stu­dents in ROTC solely for the money, and they are given two years to decide whether or not to remain in the program. 
I am not a war-monger, or a lobotomized baby killer. I am a cadet private, the lowest rank in the Army. (I just got pro­moted up from being nothing.) And I'm proud of it. I'm not on scholarship, and l think Army ROTC is the one thing at Notre Dame that keeps me motivated, active and confident in myself. I'm not being taught how to annihilate whole countries at a time; I am learning pride in my country, and leadership skills that will last through my career, be it military or civilian.

Finally a win for the 1 Victory March' 
By PAIGE SMORON Assistant Accent Editor 
It's got a good beat. but can you dance to it? 
Apparently someone thinks so. Even if it's not conducive to the cha-cha, William Studwell of Northern Illinois University rtlcently ranked Notre Dame's Victory March, MCheer, Cheer for Old Notre Dame,» number one as a college football fight song. (Anyone not familiar with the tune in question, try to sleep in past dawn on a home game weekend. You will be roused with a boisterous rendi­tion blaring out the windows of Pangborn.) 
The songs on the list fulfill the criteria of being "the best, most famous and most stirring.'! All of Studwell's choices are. as he admits, "totally personal and subjective," and it may be questioned what qualifications should be required to compile such a list. Studwell is an academic librarian who has faculty rank as a full professor at NIU. In the past. he has published reference works on such themes as Christmas carols and their origins, flag­waving anthems, bawdy drink­ing lyrics. opera and ballet plots. Now hn has a fondness for football fight songs. 
Of Notre Dame's winning 
march, Studwell says, "The best fight song comes from a uni­versity that is not the oldest, not the biggest, and not the most academically renowned, but which seems to many fans to be all three simply because of the fight song." 
"The 'Notre Dame Victory March' is undoubtedly the most famous musical piece associ­ated with collegiate sport," he believes. "It was written in 1928 by two Irishmen, com­poser Michael J. Shea and lyri­cist John F. Shea, during the Knute Rockne era when Notre Dame was becoming synony­mous with football power. More than 60 years later, and largely because of that song, many people around the country still 'Cheer, Cheer for Old Notre Dame.•» 
Our melody is very similar to Yale's "Down the Field," he points out, although he thinks the Notre Dame version is "an improvement that's far better" in motivating fans, even if he's not among them. 
Studwell has discovered a geographic trend in fight song success, and insists that it's the Midwest that has given birth to most of the best known fan wake-up tunes. with half the current, pre-Penn State Big Ten represented on his list of 13. In addition. he claims his own

"Good afternoon. I'm your host Dr. Dan Winicur and this is-"

"BEAT TilE CUHVE!" 
"That's right. It's academia's favoritll game show that allows you to win valuabl11 prizes for exereising your intellectual prow11ss. Tell 'em what they can win, Bob!" 
"Today's winner will reeeive his or her choie{l of a 1990 IBM entry-level sales position, an all-expense paid trip to Indonesia to work with the 1'11ace Corps, or a four-year tour of duty with a branch of the armed forces. lin or she will also rec11ive an invitation to re­turn next fall to play in our spedal Graduate Hound during our Week of Champions & Masochists! Baek to you, Dr. Dan..." 
"Thanks, Bob. Now, let's in­terview today's contestant, Chuck Young!" 
"Now. Chuck, you're a fresh­man at Notre Dame. How neat! It must be just like Animal House, especially on football weekends. Tell us, Chuck, what do you do in your spare time?" 
"I watch Bllllt The Curve. " 
"Wow, that's great. If you were a woman I'd kiss you. Now let's begin .... 
"First. let me briefly explain the rules of our game for new viewers. I'll be asking Chuck a variety of questions just like

"It's time for Chuck to pick his first category." "Let's see... How about Chemistry?" 
"All right, let's open curtain number three and meet your competition .... 
"It's a chemistry graduate student who graduated from Oxford University: Bob Warren!"

perspective living near Chicago has "nothing to do" with his top three choices coming all from schools in the Upper Midwest. 
A vocation like Studwell's opens himself to the wrath of college fans and alumni around the country. As a result, it must be difficult for him not to be biased when it comes to rating his own alma mater. NIU's "Huskie Fight Song" is ranked, tactfully, "above average," and Studwell describes it as an easily sung and peppy rouser scoring perhaps in the top 30 or 40. 
In a move that will probably alienate many Notre Dame supporters, Studwell rated the University of Michigan a close number two. He finds "The Vic­tors" to be "the most pugna­cious. boldest, and feistiest fight song," and continues, "Anyone who has ever heard over 102,000 loyal fans erupting in choruses of 'Hail to the victors valiant, Hail to the conquering heroes,' knows what I'm talking about." Maybe he hasn't heard our version yet. 
Ironically, although Studwell finds us melodically superior, he also concedes that he is "not high on Notre Dame myself," and, in fact, roots for us to lose (blasphemy!). 
Oh, well... it's nice to be num­ber one at something again.

Perez 

continued from page 16 
Some have said that Perez's low profile has been because she has been avoiding re­porters. That may have been true initially, she says, but it certainly isn't the case now. 
"I'm willing to talk to some­one (after a match), but I don't want to be assaulted right off the court," says Perez, who likes to have a "cooling off pe­riod" after the matches in which the players confer with each other while Perez goes back to her office to think things over. 
"After coaching you need time," says Perez. "Coaching is a rollercoaster ride, and I need my coaster to level off before I can talk to reporters. Right after a match, you might feel things in the heat of the mo­ment that no one else should know. In the time in my office, I need to reassess and reevaluate what just happened and what needs to be said." 
In her second year of coach­ing for the Irish, Perez comes across as being tough and with a sense of humor. Based on her past history, she's had reason to need both. 
Graduating from the University of Pittsburgh in 1982 after being named to the all­region women's volleyball team as a senior, Perez headed west to Northern Illinois University for an assistant coaching job. After three years there she went to Eastern Michigan as an assistant for head coach Frank Fristensky, an immigrant from Czechoslovakia. 
After Perez had departed Eastern Michigan to coach semi-pro volleyball in Chicago, a representative of a Swiss vol­leyball team phoned Fristensky to see if there were any people 

Maria Perez 
Fristensky could recommend for a head coaching job for a team in Amriswil, Switzerland, in the European Men's Professional League. 
Fristensky said Perez would be a good choice, and Perez was off to Switzerland to coach a professional men's team, not knowing any German. 
"I knew no one in Switzerland, and I didn't know the language," says Perez. "All I knew was volleyball. It went well, considering I had to learn the language and earn the re­spect of the male players. They were skeptical. They had the attitude like, 'What is this little broad doing here?'" 
Perez has a Swiss newspaper in her home that announced that she was the first woman coach for a men's volleyball team in Switzerland. At least, that's what she thinks it says. 
"I was trying to learn the language," recalls Perez of her time spent in Switzerland. "I was taking an intensive German class four hours a day, Monday through Friday. I always saw my name in quotes in the pa­pers, but I never talked to a re­porter. 
"So to kind of entertain my­self, I translated the stories to my benefit. One of the advan­tages to not knowing a lan­guage is being able to translate the stories to your advantage. Here, unfortunately, I under­stand the printed language." 
Perez understands that the Notre Dame team has gone 4­
The Observer 

18 since she has assumed the head coach position. But she has reason to be encouraged by her players' showing in finish­ing fourth in the Midwestern Collegiate Conference Championships last weekend at Xavier. 
"In the first round against Loyola, the players gave a great effort," says Perez, referring to the Irish's come-from-behind 12-15, 15-8, 17-15, 11-15, 17-5 first-round victory over fourth­ranked Loyola. "They were to­tally in sync, totally in focus. It was beautiful to see, almost mesmerizing, and I expect that I'll remember it for the rest of my life. 
"At the end of the tourna­ment, the scoreboard said we lost-that we finished fourth," says Perez, whose team lost the next two matches to Butler and Saint Louis. "But we never lost. We were winners. I think the foundations were built this weekend for the start of some­thing great. Awesome." 
And Perez's players are at­tributing their drive to succeed to their head coach, despite a tumultuous 9-25 season. 
"It was tough on her to step in after Lambert, because she got all the attention and criti­cism," says sophomore Alicia Turner. "She does a great job as a motivator. She's taken us to the top of our confidence. Now I have so much drive to play volleyball and get better. She's an incredible motivator and wonderful coach." 
Senior Colleen Wagner and sophomore Jessica Fiebelkorn also had nothing but praise for Perez. 
And with the administration having to decide on a perma­nent replacement for Lambert in the coming months, they will have to consider Perez, who has the powerful advantage of her players' support. 
She has overcome more ad­verse conditions than this.

Women's volleyball concludes in Texas 
By RENE FERRAN Sports Writer 
Notre Dame travels to Austin, Texas this weekend to participate in the Whataburger-Texas Classic hosted by the University of Texas. The other teams in the tournament are Penn State and San Diego State. 
The Irish (9-25) are the only non-ranked team in the tourney. First-round oppo­nent Texas has a record of 28-2 and is currently ranked seventh in the nation, while Penn State (40-0) is sixth and the Aztecs (21-10) are 19th. 
Notre Dame goes into the Texas Classic after a fourth­place finish in last weekend's Midwestern Collegiate Conference Championships. The Irish were led by sophomore Alicia Turner. She believes Notre Dame's tough five-game first-round victory over Loyola last week only can help the Irish as it heads for Austin. 
"We finally pulled together in a tough situation when we were down," said Turner. "Hopefully, this will help us this weekend, remembering how we pulled together against Loyola." 
The Irish play Texas Friday at 8 p.m. The Longhorns have lost this year only to Nebraska and Stanford, both within the last three weeks. Texas is a perfect 11-0 at home, only dropping five games in those matches. The Longhorns are led by Nikki Busch (.369 at­tack percentage, 306 kills). 
San Diego State, a member of the Western Athletic Conference, comes into the Texas Classic fresh from a weekend journey through Utah, losing to Brigham Young and defeating Utah. 
The Irish have faced Penn State twice during the sea­son, losing both times in three games. The Nittany Lions are a late replacement for USC in the Classic.

Henderson, at 31, beats Fielder for AL MVP vote 
OAKLAND, Calif. (AP)-Rickey Henderson's dazzling array of talents-speed, power, batting and defense-outshined the sheer slugging of Detroit's Cecil Fielder to gain the Oakland Athletics' speedster the AL Most Valuable Player award Tuesday. 
Henderson, one of the best leadoff men in baseball history, capped the finest overall season of his 11-year ca­reer by gaining 14 of the 28 first-place votes in balloting by the Baseball Writers Association of America. 
His total of 317 points put him nar­rowly ahead of Fielder, who led the majors with 51 homers and drove in 132 runs. Fielder drew 10 first-place -votes and 286 points in the voting by two writers in each AL city. 
Boston pitcher Roger Clemens, run­ner-up to Oakland's Bob Welch for the Cy Young award, finished third in the MVP voting with three first-place votes and 212 points. Oakland's Dennis Eckersley, who finished sixth in the MVP voting behind Toronto's Kelly Gruber and Chicago's Bobby Thigpen, got the other first-place vote. 
Henderson and Fielder were the only players named on all 28 ballots. The award brought a $100,000 con­tract bonus to Henderson, who signed a 
Lakers star says he's innocent 
HOUSTON (AP)-Los Angeles Lakers forward James Worthy pleaded innocent on Tuesday to charges he solicited sex from two female Houston Police Department undercover officers before a game against the Rockets last week. 
Harris County Court-at-Law Judge Jimmie Duncan set Worthy's trial for Jan. 28. 
"We are in the process of assembling all relevant facts into this incident and we will have no further comment at this time," Worthy's attorney, Cornel Williams, said following Worthy's brief court session. 
Worthy left the courthouse quickly, trailed by reporters and cameramen who followed the Lakers' star around the block while he searched for his limousine. 
Worthy declined comment throughout the brief stroll but did comment on the incident prior to a game in Los Angeles on Sunday . 
.. 

I made a major mistake and I can't dwell on·it," Worthy said. "It's a tough problem but it's not going to go away. I know I've hurt some people badly, and I've got to address that."

Captain Mike O'Connor was also pleased with Notre Dame's final season race, though slightly disappointed with his personal performance. 
"The team ran well, and the first two guys ran exceptionally well," said O'Connor. "All of us were glad to be able to con­tribute. Obviously, I had hoped to run better, but it's good that we were able to run well enough to get third. The se­niors were all disappointed that we didn't run very well, but it

$12 million, four-year deal a year ago. He is the fourth Oakland player to win the MVP. Vida Blue won in 1971, Reggie Jackson in 1973 and Jose Canseco in 1988. 
More than the slugging of Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire, it was Henderson who made the Athletics go this year. If he didn't open the scoring with a homer or "Rickey run"-a walk or single followed by two stolen bases and a sacrifice fly-he frequently started rallies that brought the A's back or made the big plays in left field. 
Oakland won 26 of the 33 games in which Henderson scored in the first in­ning. Five of his career-high 28 homers were leadoff shots, extending his major league record to 45 leadoff homers. 
Henderson, still running madly and taking the bumps at age 31, led the American League in stolen bases for the lOth time, finishing with 65 to give him a career total of 936-two shy of Lou Brock's major league record. 
Henderson also led the majors in runs scored (119) and on-base percentage (.439). He finished second in batting with a .325 average, just behind George Brett's .329, and in slugging with a ca­reer-high .577 mark, just behind Fielder. 


As spectacular as Henderson's statis­tics were, he produced several magical moments that confirmed his status as one of baseball's most colorful and dangerous players. On May 9 against the New York Yankees, Henderson scored from second on a groundout to shortstop. Two other times he scored from third on sacrifice flies to infielders. He leaped high against walls several times to rob opponents of homers, chased down liners in the gap or in foul

territory and threw out runners with uncanny accuracy. 
Henderson sometimes seemed to beat other teams even before he got to the plate, strutting ever so slowly to home plate, getting on the pitcher's nerves, making opponents think too much about what he might do. 
Digging in and scrunching down in the batter's box, Henderson's strike zone is about the size of a lady's handkerchief, helping him to draw 97 walks.

Arkansas, Duke to collide in rematch of Final Four 
-

By GREG GUFFEY Sports Editor 
NEW YOHK-It's been less than a year since second­ranked Arkansas and sixth­ranked Duke met in the NCAA Final Four. 
The two teams will play again tonight at 7 p.m. in the semifi­nals of the Dodge NIT at Madison Square Garden. 
The Blue Devils won the meeting in thn NCAA Tourney last year 97-IB before losing to UNLV in the final. 
"We're looking forward to sneing what we can do in a rn­match," Arkansas coach Nolan Hiehardson said. 
The Blue Devils sport a dif­ferent look this season. Gone are Phil Henderson (18.5 points per game), Alaa Abdelnaby 
(15.1 ppg,), and Robert Brickey 
(11.7 ppg). Christian Laettner 
(16.3 ppg last year) is the only returnee in double figures. 
The Razorbacks return a good nucleus, including leading scorer Todd Day. He averaged 
19.5 points last season, and is scoring at a 21.0 clip in the NIT this year. 
Lee Maybnrry (14.5 ppg last year) returns at guard, while Oliver Miller (11.1 ppg I ast year) returns at center. They are joined in the starting lineup by senior forward Ron Huery and senior guard Arlyn Bowers. 
"Mayberry and Day are as good as any players in the United States," Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said. "And Miller-! don't know how you play defense on him. I think our game will be a good game. I think there will be a lot of points scored." 
Sophomore guard Bobby Hurley brings 8.8 points back to the Duke lineup, while Bill McCaffrey scored at a 6.6 clip last year. The Blue Devils look to senior co-captains Greg Koubek and Clay Buckley to provide experience and leader­ship. Five freshmen should also contribute this season. 
Richardson thinks the youth on the Duke team might actu­ally help in some ways. 
"The only big thing I see dif­ferent is that they don't have the older kids," Richardson said. "A lot of times, young teams come to the top rather than guys who are expected to be there." 
The Dodge NIT will be a 

Todd Lyght is expected to lead the secondary from his corner­back position. Junior Rod Smith and freshman Jeff Burris are expected to share time at the other corner, while freshmen Willie Clark and Tom Carter will both spend time at free safety. Dependable senior Greg Davis will start at strong safety. 
The Trojan offense is led by petulant sophomore quarter­back Todd Marinovich, a pre­season Heisman candidate who has had problems this year. Marinovich was suspended from the Trojans' 13-6 victory over Arizona State on Oct. 27 for missing class, and it has been rumored that he will turn pro after this year. 
Marinovich's numbers, while they are good, are less than outstanding. He is 152 for 253 passing this year, with 12 touchdowns and nine intercep­tions. Tailback Mazio Royster (184 rushes for 992 yards) and fullback Scott Lockwood (111 carries for 513 yards) will get the ball frequently in a USC at­tack which is geared toward the run. 
"They run the option now, which they didn't do last year, which presents more problems for us," Holtz says. "Last year they predominantly featured Todd Marinovich and his pass­ing. Now they are more of a running team, run a little bit of option, do a variety of things along that line and I think they • are every bit as productive as what they have been in the past." 
On the special teams, Ismail will be replaced by Ray Griggs for punt returns and either JeiT Burris or Willie Clark for kick­niTs. Craig llentrich (1 0 for 15 FG, 43.9 yards per punt) will do the kicking for the Irish.

Holtz says. "They have given up some big plays. They are very, very young on defense, and let's say this: They are very, very talented on defense." 
Linebackers Kurt Barber and Scott Ross lead the Trojan de­fense with 70 and 68 tackles respectively. Ross also has two interceptions on the season. Sophomore free safety Stephone Pace will anchor the USC secondary. Pace is is tied for second on the team in inter­

homecoming for Arizona freshman Khalid Reeves, a highly-touted prospect from Queens. 
He averaged 28.6 points and 
8.0 rebounds as a senior at Christ the King, while being named a Parade second-team All-American. He has scored seven points in 29 minutes dur­ing Arizona's first two games. 
"He's better than I thought," said Arizona coach Lute Olson, who compared him to former Iowa guard Ronnie Lester. "He's the best incoming guard in the eight years I've been at Arizona." 
Krzyzewski also has a big­name freshman in Grant Hill, a versatile player who plays just about anywhere on the court.

"We got blown out, and the kids know it," Phelps said.. "I think the kids will be confident to go out and play a team like this." 
There are other similarities between the two teams. Besides the big men, both squads have a good, average­size forward and excellent guard play. 
Irish forward Daimon Sweet 
(10.5 ppg) will match up against sophomore transfer Chris Mills (12.5 ppg). Olson says Mills, who came to Arizona after a now-infamous ordeal at Kentucky, is still struggling in finding his rhythm.

"He has a lot of poise," Krzyzewski said. "We like him the most out on the perimeter. He starts inside, but ends up outside in our motion oiTense." 
Arizona and Notre Dame have not met since 1934, when the Irish won a 46-24 game in South Bend ... Two Arizona transfers have played against Notre Dame in the past. Brian Williams was a freshman at Maryland when the Terrapins beat the Irish 78-75 in 1988, and Chris Mills was a freshman at Kentucky when the Irish downed the Wildcats 81-65 in the Big Four Classic two years 
ago. 
Bennett give the Irish a solid backcourt, combining for 23.5 points and 12.5 assists per game. Arizona counters Matt Othick and Matt Muehlebach, who combine for 20.5 points and 12.5 assists per game. 
The Irish have Kevin Ellery 
(6.5 ppg) coming ofT the bench, while the Wildcats have two players in double figures, Wayne Womack (13.5 ppg) and Case Schmidt (12.0 ppg). 
Phelps also expects the four Irish freshman-Carl Cozen, Brooks Boyer, and Joe and Jon Hoss-to make some contribu­tions as they did in the first two games. Against Fordham, those four combined for 13 first-half points and gave Notre Dame a big spurt heading into the locker room. 
"They play with a lot of heart and enthusiasm," Phelps said. 
son. 

Notre Dame's defensive problems are well-documented. The Irish have had difficulties, particularly with their sec­ondary, all year. In fact, the Notre Dame defensive backs have intercepted just five passes all year, while the USC backs have picked off 15 and returned four for touchdowns. 
"To have a good football team, you have to excel in give­aways and takeaways," Holtz says. "You have to excel in lost­yardage plays, but the take­aways and the giveaways really hurt us. In addition to that, teams don't get penalized against us, they don't make turnovers, and they convert on third-down plays. When you do that, you are not going to play very well on defense." 
Zorich is slated to start along with fellow seniors Bob Dahl and George Williams on the de­fensive line. Seniors Andre Jones and Scott Kowlakowski will start at outside linebacker, while team tackling-leader Mike Stonebreaker (89 tackles) and sophomore Demetrius DuBose will start at inside linebacker.

Thanksgiving is coming to the Joyce Athletic and Convocation Center ice rink this Thursday and Friday, when the Irish host the University of Ala­bama-Huntsville Chargers. 
No, there won't be any carved turkeys for postgame delicacies, but most of the players' parents will be in town as Notre Dame has the home-ice advantage. But Notre Dame is hoping that the Chargers won't be feeling at home. 
''I'm not quite certain what to expect," said Notre Dame head coach Ric Schafer. "They beat Alaska-Fairbanks 7-4, then turned around and lost (to Alaska-Fairbanks) 9-0. It'll be interesting to see what kind of team shows up." 
After those two games, the Chargers are 3-4-1 on the season, and they typically give the Irish a tough game. The Chargers defeated Notre Dame 9-2 last year, and the Irish haven't beaten them since 1986, when the Irish won 10-7. 
"We didn't know what to expect," said junior center David Bankoske. "We weren't mentally prepared. We went down there and said 'We're in Alabama, they can't play hockey here,' and proceeded to get throttled. We're going to get some payback." 
Coach Ric Schafer was pleased with the play of his team over the past few games, defeating UMass-Boston twice last weekend. 

"We deserved them," Coach Schafer said of the wins. "We tried a couple of different lines, and it seemed like it charged them up." 
The players aren't down­playing the importance of having most of their parents in town for the game. 
"Everyone's going to turn it up a notch because their parents will be there," said sophomore defenseman Dan Sawyer. 
"Our parents have been with us [in hockey] since we were three and four, and now we want to put a show on for them," said Bankoske. 
Clemens receives suspension 
BOSTON (AP)-Roger Clemens was suspended for the first five games of next season and fined $10,000 Tuesday for behavior which led to the Boston pitcher's ejection from the last game of the American League playoffs. 
The penalty announced by AL president Bobby Brown will force the Red Sox star to miss one start. It comes a week after he earned a $125,000 bonus provided in his contract for fin­ishing second in the AL Cy Young Award voting. 
Although Clemens can appeal, Red Sox general manager Lou Gorman said, "Dr. Brown's statement and subsequent fine and suspension of Roger Clemens speaks for itself. Although we are not in agree­ment with the severity of the league's action, we are satisfied that the issue has been ad­dressed." 
Clemens was ejected by plate umpire Terry Cooney in the second inning of Oakland's 3-1 victory that completed the A's four-game sweep Oct. 10. 
In his announcement, Brown cited Clemens for making " ... significant physical contact with an umpire (Jim Evans), for threatening umpire Cooney, for verbally abusing umpire Cooney with pe'rsonal obscenities and for not leaving the dugout immediately after 

American Heart Association 
the ejection." Clemens was not immediately available for comment. 
Last season, Clemens led the league for the second time in earned run average with a 1.93 mark. He was 21-6, the second winningest season of his career. 
He finished second to Oakland's Bob Welch in the Cy Young balloting. Clemens won the award in 1986 and 1987 and was most valuable player in 1987. 
Although Boston surprised preseason predictors by win­ning the AL East, the season ended on a sour note for the team and its star pitcher. 
The altercation occurred after Clemens walked Willie Randolph, giving the A's, who led 1-0, runners on first and third. Cooney and Clemens got into a shouting match, and Clemens bumped Evans. 
After the game, Clemens and Cooney said that after Randolph walked the pitcher shook his head near the mound. 

Cooney said he told Clemens, "I hope you're not shaking your head at me. He said, 'if you want to talk to me, take your mask off.' By me not removing my mask and not getting into a verbal thing with him, that was my way of warning him." 
"I was looking down," Clemens said. "I saw (Cooney's) throat guard moving, so he was saying something. He thought I was talking to him. I told him, 'I'm not shaking my ... head at you. The problem was not with you.'" 
Several witnesses said Clemens used obscenities. Cooney said he was the first one to speak in the dispute after seeing Clemens shake his head. 
Boston second baseman Marty Barrett also was ejected in the incident after throwing two water coolers and a trash bin from the Red Sox dugout onto the field. 
Women's basketball preps for Evansville 
By RENE FERRAN 
Sports Writer 

The Notre Dame women's basketball team opens regular season play Monday at 7:30 
p.m. against Midwestern Collegiate rival Evansville in Joyce Arena. 
The Irish come into Monday's game having defeated the Latvian National Team 69-61 November 19th, the only loss on its United States tour. Latvia had come away with wins against Ohio State and ninth­ranked Purdue. 
Senior point guard Karen Robinson led Notre Dame with 18 points, and three other starters scored in double fig­ures. 
Irish head coach Muffet McGraw was pleased with her team's performance against the Latvians. 
"We got the first game jitters out of the way," said McGraw. "We came out nervous in the first half, but we have an expe­rienced team, and we re­grouped and came out in the second half much more relaxed. Now that we have our first game under our belt, we'll be ready to play against Evansville." 
Evansville was 10-17 last season, 6-10 in conference ac· tion. The Lady Aces, however, return their entire starting lineup, including preseason all­conference choices Diane Starry (6-0, forward) and Amy Humphries (5-5, guard), as well as 6-4 sophomore center Christy Greis. 
"They'll be an improved team this year, especially with all five starters back," said McGraw. 
The Irish have never lost to Evansville in the 11 times they've played. For Notre Dame to continue its mastery of the Lady Aces, McGraw believes the Irish will need to continue to rebound as they did against the Latvians-Notre Dame outrebounded Latvia 40-31. 
"Rebounding will be a big key for us this year," said McGraw. "They have (Greis), who was one of the leading rebounders in the conference last year. We need to keep her off the boards." 
Notre Dame was a nearly unanimous choice in a presea­son MCC coaches poll to repeat as conference champions, and placed Robinson and senior forward Krissi Davis on the first-team All-MCC. Robinson also was named MCC Player of the Year. 
After Evansville, the Irish travel to the West Coast to face UCLA and second-ranked Stanford, the defending NCAA national champion.

Ragh1b lsma1l attempts to evade a Penn State tackler in Notre Dame's upset loss to Penn State. Ismail is improbable against USC Saturday. 
By KEN TYSIAC 
Associate Sports Editor 
Notre Dame's chances for the 1990 National Championship are very slim after last week's 24-21 loss to Penn State. 
USC has no title hopes at all. 

When the seventh-ranked Irish square off against No. 18 USC at 8 p.m. Saturday in the Los Angeles Coliseum, however, there will be plenty of motiva­tion on each side as the teams battle for the 62nd straight year in this storied traditional match up. 
"It's a big rivalry, it means an awful lot to us," says Il'ish Coach Lou Holtz. "I've studied the history of the rivalry; it's a great rivalry. There will be lot of great athletes, national at­tention, it's going to be on prime time. The records don't mean anything. It's a game where everybody prepares their best and plays their best."

ing better than to defeat the Irish and break a string of seven consecutive Notre Dame

Underclassmen lead Irish to third-place finish in NCAA's 
By BARBARA MORAN 
Sports Writer 
The men's cross country team ended a stellar season with an outstanding race at the NCAA championships in Knoxville, Tenn., Monday, finishing third in the country behind Arkansas and Iowa State. 
Finishing first for the Irish was the same duo that led the team to victory at the NCAA District IV qualifying meet two weeks ago. Sophomore John Coyle crossed the line first for the Irish, completing the 10­kilometer course in 30:.00 for 24th place overall. Freshman Mike McWilliams followed close behind, capturing 34th place in 
30:11 and earning the status of top freshman in the country. Both Coyle and McWilliams were awarded All-America honors for their efforts. 
Also scoring for the Irish were Seniors Pat Kearns (58th, 30:37), Ryan Cahill (73rd, 30:45), and Mike O'Connor (85th, 30:57). O'Connor, who had led the team all year, was suffering from a sore achilles tendon during the race. Jonah Koech of Iowa State won the race in 29:05. 
The race marked the highest NCAA finish for the Irish under the coaching of Joe Piane. The win followed a strong first­place finish at the district qualifier and a near-perfect season which included only one loss, a 29-26 upset to William and Mary. 
Five of the top seven runners wiil return to the Irish squad next year, including the two All-Americans. Piane was pleased with the season conclusion, and is already looking forward to next year. 

"We placed about as high as we could place, but we could have run better," said Piane. "Cahill just didn't run very well, and O'Connor had a sore achilles which has been pretty sore off and on all year long, but we still needed their per­formances to place in the top three. 
"We had a successful year," continued the coach, "but we can always hope to do little bet­ter. If you'J:;e satisfied with third you've got a problem, but it sure was a great year for us. You're not going to hear me complain about it. This season makes us real excited to look

'Don't call ND the underdogs' 
Arizona Head Coach Olson won't underestimate Irish 
By GREG GUFFEY 
Sports Editor 
NEW YORK-Arizona coach Lute Olson isn't buying the claims that unranked Notre Dame is the Cinderella against his third-ranked Wildcats in the semifinals of the Dodge NIT. 
"Sure, nobody's ever heard of Notre Dame," Olson said. "I wouldn't ever view Notre Dame as a Cinderella." 
If Notre Dame isn't Cinderella, it is certainly an un­derdog in the game set for 9 
p.m. 
tonight on ESPN. Sixth­ranked Duke and second­ranked Arkansas will meet at 7 

p.m. 
in a rematch of last year's NCAA Final Four semifinal. 


The losers will meet in the consolation game at 6:45 p.m. Friday, while the winners will play for the championship at 9 p.m. 
The week will be a big test for the Irish, who downed Fordham and Iowa in the opening rounds. Arizona has six players averaging in double figures after two wins over Austin Peay and East Tennessee State. 
"This is an opportunity for us to see how good we really are," Notre Dame coach Digger Phelps said. "Arizona is a team most everybody will be talking about when March rolls around." 
The biggest test for the Irish will come inside, where the Wildcats have 6-10 center Sean Rooks· and 6-11 Brian Williams. How well Notre Dame players Keith Tower and LaPhonso Ellis handle that challenge could determine how the Irish fare in the game. 
Most attention will be focused on Williams and Ellis, both ju­niors and both team leaders. Williams averages 17 points and 11 rebounds, while Ellis scores 13 points and pulls down 
10.5 boards. 
"That will be an interesting matchup," Olson said. "Both have size and strength. I think he (Ellis) is playing well. He's a good inside-outside player. He's not a guy who's always going to be around the basket area." 

Ellis will probably try to mix up his inside and outside play. With Iowa double-and triple­teaming him, he went to the perimeter and nailed two three­pointers. 
"In the first two games, Williams was defending guys 6­4 who were perimeter-type players," Olson said. "We feel comfortable about him being able to go out and defend peo­ple on the perimeter. I think Brian can handle it." 
Phelps sees a lot of similari­ties between the Arizona big men and LSU's inside game last year. The Irish were beaten soundly by a Tiger team led by Shaquille O'Neal and Stanley Roberts last season before a record <;,\hOWd in the Superdome. 
see NIT I page 13 the all-time series 34-23-4. 
Injuries will play a crucial 
role in Notre Dame's effective­ness Saturday. Heisman Trophy candidate Raghib Ismail still has been hampered by the deep thigh bruise which caused him 'to miss the second half last week against Penn State. Holtz said that Ismail almost certainly will not return punts or kickoffs, and it is possible that the star flanker will not play at 
all. 

Two more All-Americans have 
been missing from practice 
early this week. Nose guard 
Chris Zorich and cornerback 
Todd Lyght are battling injuries, 
but are expected to play 
Saturday. 

The most critical loss is 
Ismail. The Irish lost to 
Stanford 36-31 on Oct. 6 when 
the junior from Wilkes Barre, 
Pa., was out of the lineup. 
Against Penn State, Notre Dame 
went into the lockerroom at 
halftime with a 21-7 lead, but 
did not score in the second half 
when Ismail was forced to the 
sidelines. 

"When (Ismail's) out there you can control a lot of things about coverages and about run support and about blitzes," Holtz says. "So when he's out of the ballgame it hurts our confidence, but I really believe that we are not a one-man football team. We are a good offensive football team." 
If Ismail is not able to play he will be replaced by junior Shawn Davis. Split end Tony Smith will be the other wideout. Sophomore quarterback Rick Mirer, who threw two intercep­tions in the loss to Penn State but otherwise has had an out­standing season (1 03 of 185 passing, 8 TD, 6 Int.), will start at quarterback. 
The player most likely to pick up the slack should Ismail be absent is tailback Ricky Watters, who has rushed for 288 yards in the past two games. Junior Rodney Culver and freshman Jerome Bettis will share time at fullback for the Irish. 
Notre Dame will face a young USC defense which features

Low campus profile? Don't blame Perez 
After the turbulent resignation of women's volleyball coach Art Lambert, followers of the team expected the suc­cessor to be a lower profile-and less vocal-head coach. 
That successor was Maria Perez, and she definitely succeeded in keeping the lower profile. But whether she's less vocal is disputable. 
"I think what has happened (since Scott Brutocao 
assuming the job as head coach in the Irish Items first week of October) is I'm not the person that people perceived me to be," says Perez, who had been Lambert's assistant before stepping up to the top spot. "I'm Maria Perez, and I think everyone is starting to realize that. Everybody thinks I'm just this terrible mean person but they don't know me." ' 
Who is Maria Perez? Who is this enigmatic coach who refused to talk to reporters after matches immediately following the Lambert affair? Much space in this and other publications have been devoted to the exposition of the Lambert drama, but practically none has been used for an understanding of the succeeding coach.
