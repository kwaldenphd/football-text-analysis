Maybe it's just me, but I think we have gorm a little overboard with t11is whole political corre<:tness thing. I understand not wanting to hurt people's feelings, but we've taken it to a whole new extreme. Anything that can potentially be deemed minutely ommsive to anyone is almost irnrnndiatdy censored.

theatrical illusion, and artistic insight, provide a sensitive vision of what it is to be human,'' said Cindy Laughlin, director of artistic servic­es at Baylin Artist Management, the group that manages the mari­onettes. 
"The performance spans the range of emotions with characters and actions that are amazingly convincing," she said. 
Cashore, who graduated from Notre Dame with a bachelor's degree in Fine Arts, has been cre­ating marionettes since he was 11 years old. He began performing with his creations, which can have as many as 42 strings attached, in 2007-2008 school year sponsored by the Office of Special Events. 
Cashore has performed in Europe, the Far East and various locations in North America such as the Kennedy Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla. 
The performance will feature music by composers such as Vivaldi, Strauss, Beethoven and Copeland. 
The show will be at 7:30 tonight in the Uttle Theater. Student tickets are $5.

"The local community actual­ly helps build the school," Ho said. "And the government sus­tains it." 
ND-8 worked on several fundraising projects last semes­ter, such as a T-shirt sale, a paper bricks fundraiser, and an ornament sale at Christmas to raise money for the school. Through these fundraisers, ND­8 has raised $24,000 toward their $35,000 goal. 
As soon as the monetary goal is reached, construction on the school will begin, Ho said. She hopes that Artists for Africa will bring them even closer to their goal, which they hope to reach by the end of the semester. 
"From this event, it would be nice to get a couple thousand [dollars]," Ho said. 'That's aim­ing high, but we have high hopes for this event." 
Artists for Africa will take place tonight and Friday at 9

Through the partnership between Notre Dame's Africa Faith and Justice Network (AFJN). the African Student Association and ND-8, Artists for Africa will perform a benefit performance tonight and Friday. 
This year's Artists for Africa benefit will showcase student musicians, a cappella groups and dance groups. Featured acts include Project Fresh, Notre Dame's urban dance crew, Halftime, a campus co-ed a cappella group, The Dance Company of Notre Dame and First Class Steppers, Notre Dame's stepping troupe. 
The benefit will also include student solo artists Michael Rose and Simon Chun, as well as local band Half Pint Jones. 
All of the proceeds from the benefit concert will go toward Building Tomorrow, a non-prof­it organization supported most­ly by colleges across the nation. The organization encourages young people to promote awareness and raise funds for educating children in sub­Saharan Africa. 
Sophomore Barbara Ho, who is organizing this year's Artists For Africa benefit, said she is looking forward to collaborat­ing with campus groups to raise money for Building Tomorrow. 
"I've always wanted to do 
a really good cause." 
ND-8 partnered with Building Tomorrow when planning Artists for Africa. ND-8 is a stu­dent-run organization on cam­pus that promotes the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals for improv­ing social justice around the world. These eight goals include combating poverty, improving the environment and providing universal education. ND-8's education subcommit­tee, which focuses on the devel­opment goal of universal edu­cation, has been working close­ly with Building Tomorrow by raising money for the project through fundraisers since fall 2007. 
Ho first heard about Building Tomorrow when the organiza­tion's founder, George Srour, delivered a lecture at Notre Dame last spring during Millennium Development Goals Week. 
In his lecture, Srour spoke about how he started Building Tomorrow after visiting Kampala, Uganda, as an intern for the UN. While there, he saw suffering children who lacked a decent education. 
"It was really inspirational," Ho said. "He's pretty young and has already started this non­profit organization." 
After hearing Srour speak, Ho and the other committee mem­bers at ND-8 started working with Building Tomorrow to raise $35,000 in order to build

Obama's strongest support­ers were blacks, particularly black males, and exit polls are suggesting that upcoming pri­maries will be favorable ground for Obama, Pinderhughes said. "The District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia have very signifi­cant black populations," she said. 
Political science professor 

Darren Davis spoke about the shortcomings of polling infor­mation. 
"We're seeing an increasing­ly biased media, one that pays selective attention to polling information and tries to equate polls. But not all polls are alike," he said. "You have internet polls, polls of likely voters, state-wide polls, national polls." 
"Polls ean be awfully mis­leading," he said. 
Davis drew on the idea that voters are "pressured" to vote for a black candidate in this election. 
"Social pressure leads voters to want to vote for a black candidate, but when they're in a private voting booth, they frequently vote for someone else or not at all," he said. 
Political scientists eall that phenomenon the Bradley Effect, he said. 
Freshman Chris Hhodenbaugh said Davis' analysis of polling shortcom­ings stuck with him the most. "It's interesting to hear people trying to inform us rather than CNN pundits getting us to watch the program," he said. 
Senior Mike McKenna, the NDVotes'08 student coordina­tor, recognized the importance of political competency in national elections. 
"The focus is political com­petency, not just being con­sumers but analyzers of politi­cal news," he said.

"Generally, if you have a fever you should be in bed and not go into elass," Moskwinski said. 
Students have experi­enced various degrees of infection. Senior Colin Ethier missed only two dasses when he contracted the flu. 
"I had a bad cough and my chest was really tight. ... I was extremely tired and my body ached for about four days," he said. 
However, sophomore Kara Coyle's flu inducted a 103 temperature, inability to sleep more then two hours 
at a time, hot and eold flashes, nausea. a bad cough and extreme fatigue. She missed an entire week of school, leading her to turn in three papers late. 
"Most of my teachers were understanding since it seemed to be a campus epi­demic, but I don't think my note from Health Services gave me an excuse for more than one day, which seems pretty unfair," Coyle said. 
According to CBSNews.com. the flu infects up to 20 percent of the population, causes the hospitalization of 200,000 and kills 36,000 eaeh year.

ranks of any kind." 
One concern, Brown said, is that the University would have a "stained glass ceiling" and that non-Catholic faculty could feel undervalued for their work. 
"It's hard to feel that the University values your efforts if the University is pouring resources and time into hir­ing faculty merely because of the fact that they're Catholic," he said. 
Brown added that religion is not always a factor in how professors teach. Non­Catholic professors, such as those who study the history 

or philosophy of religion, ean also contribute to the Catholic character of Notre Dame, Brown said. 
"We also have faculty who are not Catholic and make enormous contributions to the University's Catholic mis­sion," he said. 
Professor Thomas Noble, student affairs chair of the Faculty Senate who attends weekly Senate meetings, said students must become edu­cated about the issue. 
"Don't think that what you have to do is choose one fac­ulty position or another. Arrive at your own view," Noble said. "I think it's lot more important for the whole process if you decide what you think, and we find vari­ous ways to bring that for­
ward." 

Student body viee president Maris Braun said there will be a Town Hall meeting Feb. 18 for students to discuss this issue. The meeting will take place at 7 p.m. in 101 DeBartolo Hall. Senators also plan on hosting sessions within their dorms before the meeting. 
In other Senate news: 

+ The Senate unanimously passed a resolution on improving the academic advi­sory structure. The resolu­tion stated that students are "often unaware of whom their advisor is after their freshman year." Therefore, the Senate proposed that freshmen should be notified about whom they should eon­
taet for questions about elasses and majors. Also, the resolution said, colleges should have mandatory meetings, followed by break­out sessions within majors. The resolution also recom­mended an increase in the number of advisors in the Mendoza College of Business and permanent advisors in department offices. 
+ In addition to the aca­demic advisory resolution, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution support­ing iTunes U. Residential Life Committee Chair Marianna Montes said the University did not show eon­cern that iTunes U, which allows students to upload lectures, would enable stu­dents to miss elass. 

However, the University is concerned about legal issues surrounding academic prop­erty, she said.

Ecuador's Tungurahua volcano erupts 
QUITO -Ecuador's Tungurahua volcano shot columns of ash miles into the air on Wednesday, as officials ordered the evacuation of 3,000 villagers living near its slopes. 
Some 1,000 villagers from the western flanks of the 16,575-foot volcano fled their homes for shelters at dawn, said Mauro Hodriguez, director of Civil Defense. He said 11 families who refused to leave, fearing loot­ers, were removed by force. 
"We've taken all of the precautions possi­ble," President Rafael Correa told reporters on Wednesday, adding that a state of emergency already in place in the area will be extended for 60 days. 
Juan Salazar, the mayor of the nearby vil­lage of Penipe, said 3,000 people needed to be evacuated -a figure that included the 1,000 villagers who had already fled.

TOLEDO, Ohio -The threat of worsened flooding stretched across Ohio Wednesday, where two days of rain and melting snow left water covering busy roads and pushed rain­swollen rivers and creeks past their breaking points. 
In northwest Ohio, city leaders in Findlay hoped to avoid another major flood just months after the city was swamped by historic flooding.

Military confims secret lockups 
Guantanamo commanders verify existence of 'Camp 7'for key alleged terrorists 
Associated Press 

GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE -Somewhere amid the cactus-studded hills on this sprawling Navy base, separate from the cells where hundreds of men sus­pected of links to al-Qaida and the Taliban have been locked up for years, is a place even more closely guarded ­a jailhouse so protected that its very location is top secret. 
For the first time, the top commander of detention operations at Guantanamo has confirmed the existence of the mysterious Camp 7. In an interview with The Associated Press, Hear Adm. Mark Buzby also provided a few details about the maxi­mum-security lockup. 
Guantanamo commanders said Camp 7 is for key alleged al-Qaida members, who must be kept apart from other prisoners to prevent them from retaliating against long-term detainees who have talked to interrogators. They also want the location kept secret for fear of terror­ist attack.

"When George and I are asked to describe what our platform is all about, we say student life improvement," Braun said. 
Although his running mate was not present, Ehrlich, a jun­ior from Stanford Hall, said their platform was made up of fun ideas that are also feasible, ineluding adding a tetherball pole to North and South Quads. "We always want to ask, 'Is it possible'?"' Ehrlieh said. 
Wearing shiny gold pants, Zahm freshmen Howes and Himkus argued their Iaek of expnrienee is made up for with tiHlir interesting ideas, inelud­ing an embargo on all British goods. "Our names don't mat­ter, our issues matter," I lowes said. "The only thing louder than these pants should be the voice of the stud1mt body." 
Questions 
Weiss first asked eandidates to explain their eampaign's most important idea. 
llollowood said getting bntter toilet paper is most important. "There should be warning labels on this stuff." he said. while holding up a pieee of the eurrent toilet paper being used on campus. 
Heish and Grant said they have done extensive research talking to other Midwest schools, and they believe get­ting student discounts ofT-cam­pus is very important. "It is one of the biggest issues that really affect student life," Schmidt said. 

Emphasizing their signature issue. Kelly and Poelhuis said they, too, had looked at other s<:hools, and they both felt a shuttle bus service would greatly improve student lifn. "If other schools can do it, why not at Notre Dame'?" Kelly said. 
Braun and Chamberlain said they had three issues they feel would most benefit students ­increasing Grah-N-Go points and selection. implementing a book delivery service to the dorms and increasing ofT-cam­to "find what students want." 
Ehrlich said getting tetherball poles on campus would be a very positive addition, and would also help students get more exereise. "I'm focused on getting students outside and exeited," he said. "I see a lot of freshmen and they're always inside playing Rockband." 
Mueh of Howes and Rimkus' platform derives from the Nickelodeon show "Legends of the Hidden Temple," and includes using Temple Guards to proteet against parietals. However, Rimkus said one should not worry if they are eaught, "because just like in the show, you can tag team your partner to finish the job." 
Weiss then asked the candi­dates to explain what distin­guishes their ticket from the others. 
Both Heish and 
Schmidt and 
biggest thing I 
bring to the table is the fact that I'm vice presi­dent right now," said Braun. "There really is no substitute for experience." 
Although the other tiekets have little or no student gov­ernment experience, they are hoping their ideas appeal to voters. "We have no experienee and we don't know how to run a bureaueracy," said Hollowood of himself and Tomala. "We just want to get better toilet paper." 
Ehrlich echoed these senti­ments, saying what he lacks in experience he makes up for in enthusiasm. "I wanted to see someone who is running a good campaign but not taking them­selves too seriously," he said. "It's not mutually exclusive being serious and fun." 
The final question from the Judieial Couneil asked how eandidates would make student government more accessible to their eonstituency. 
Most candidates responded that they would ask students what they want through sur­veys and personal interaetion. "We want to ereate transparen­cy in student government," said Heish, whose Web site, boband­grant.com, includes a student c1msus section asking for input for their platform. "We want to get students on the second floor of LaFortune." 
Ehrlieh said he believes stu­dent government is very acces­sible; however, people don't feel that it is necessary to inter­act with it until a concerning issue arises. 
Student input 
One audience member asked how the eandidates plan to help the environment. All said they thought it was an impor­tant issue, and they supported the etTorts of GreenND. 
Kelly and Poelhuis said they support giving students incen­tives to reduee their waste, sueh as rewarding the dorm that cuts down most on energy use. "I think the vast majority of students are apathetic: about the environment," Kelly said. "You need to give people incen­tives to get them to eut down." 
Another audience member asked how eandidates plan to improve diversity.

Ehrlieh, who is the only can­didate to openly advoeate a University-recognized Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender (GLBT) club, said Notre Dame's eurrent diversity polieies are failing, and the University needs to relleet on its eurrent record. "I feel very coneerned about diversity," he said.

The final question asked was whether they would sacrifice their eandidaey in return for Notre Dame winning a National Championship, to which all of the candidates responded yes. 
"It's been a long time since Notre Dame has seen a get to see the light of the sec­ond floor of LaFortune in return, that's OK." 

In their elosing statements, the candidates reiterated the issues most important to them and asked the audienec for support.

IN BRIEF Wheat prices soar to record high 
NEW YORK-Wheat futures reached a new record high Wednesday as investors bet that tight­ening U.S. supplies and poor harvests around the globe will push grain prices higher -worsening food inflation. 
Other agriculture commodities spiked on the rally, with soybean and com futures both hitting records. Precious metals rose broadly, while ener­gy futures fell. 
Wheat prices have trekked relentlessly higher as global supplies have shrunk. Smaller-than­expected harvests around the world, due partly to dry weather, have left stockpiles depleted even as demand continues unabated. That's brought an increasing number of foreign buyers to the U.S. market seeking dwindling supplies of milling­quality wheat used in bread, pasta and other foods. 
U.S. wheat exporters have sold more than 15 million bushels a week in seven of the last 11 weeks, well above the U.S. Department of Agriculture's weekly target of about 1 million bushels a week. 
Eli Lilly's Taurel receives millions 
INDIANAPOLIS -Eli Lilly and Co.'s chairman and chief executive officer, Sidney Taurel, who has announced that he's stepping down in March, received total compensation valued at $11.3 mil­lion in 2007, an 18 percent increase from 2006, according to regulatory filings. 
The drug maker gave Taurel a $1.72 million salary last year. His pay package also included $4.04 million in non-equity incentive plan com­pensation and $215,044 in miscellaneous com­pensation, which included $107,105 for use of the corporate jet, according to a preliminary proxy statement filed Wednesday with the Security and Exchange Commission. 
In addition, he was awarded restricted stock valued at $5.3 million. 
The company said it based Taurel's 2007 com­pensation on Lilly's 2006 performance. It noted that Lilly exceeded earnings targets that year, strengthened diversity programs and "enhanced its brand iinage and reputation.'' 
Lilly spokesman Phil Belt said the company ailns "to be competitive in the upper half of com­pensation packages among peer companies."

Republicans block rebate bill 
Democrats' bid to add $44 billion to House-passed measure divides Senate 
Associated Press 

WA';HINGTON -The fate ol' $600-$1,200 rebate checks for more than 100 million Americans is in lilnbo after Senate Republicans blocked a bid by Democrat.<> to add $44 billion in help for the elderly, disabled veter­ans, the unemployed and businesses to the !louse­passed economic aid pack­age. 
GOP senators banded together Wednesday to thwart the $205 billion plan, leaving Democrats with a difficult choice either to quickly accept a House bill they have said is inadequate or risk being blamed for delaying a measure designed as a swift shot in the arm for the lagging economy. 
The tally was 58-41 to end debate on the Senate meas­ure, just short of the 60 votes Democrats would have needed to scale procedural hurdles and move the bill to a final vote. In a suspenseful showdown vote that capped days of partisan infighting and procedural jockeying, eight Republicans -four of them up for re-election this year -joined Democrats to back the plan, bucking GOP leaders and President Bush, who objected to the costly add-ons.

Alaskan villages are short on local police 
Remote, poor towns cannot afford adequate law enforcement; state troopers lack enough manpower to be effective 
Associated Press 
ANCHORAGE -In the four hours it took Alaska State Troopers to arrive at the Eskimo village of Nunam !qua, a man choked and raped his 13-year­old stepdaughter in front of three younger childn~n. lie had already beaten his wife with a shotgun and pistol-whipped a friend after an evening drinking home brew. 
Across the remote, frozen reaches of Alaska, scores of native villages have no full­fledged police oflicers at all. And help in an emergency can be a long way ofT. 
"We're just trying to hang in there," said Edward Adams, mayor of Nunam Iqua. 
Alaska's villages are often des­perately poor, with pnople sub­sisting on hunting and fishing. Many communities cannot atliJrd police forces. At the same time, the Alaska State Troopers don't have the manpower to put olli­cers on patrol in every village. 
As a result, when serious <Times are committed, many vil­lages must rely on troopers based in towns far away. And it can take days for help to arrive if the weather is bad or troopers have more pressing cases. 

During the attack in Nunam lqua more than two years ago, locals in the village of 200 had to call troopers in Bethel, 155 miles away. But the troopers' aircraft was being serviced. So they had to charter a plane to get to the community on Alaska's western coast. 
Since then, tribal leaders in the village have hired a single public safety officer. But she has no law enforcement training and is unarmed. 
Nunam lqua and many other villages are also eligible to tap into the state-funded Village Public Safety Officer program and hire what is known as a VPSO, a brown-uniformed peace officer who receives up to 10 weeks of training from the state troopers and carries pepper spray and a Taser, though no gun. 
But the turnover rate among VPSOs has been high as 40 per­cent, because the job is stressful, with low pay and little backup. And many villages can't attract good applicants because of inad­equate housing, the low wages and the astronomical cost of liv-
Across South, tornadoes create mass destruction 
Associated Press 
LAFAYETIE, Tenn. -One man pulled a couch over his head. Bank employees rushed into the vault. A woman trembled in her bathroom, clinging to her dogs. College students huddled in dor­mitories. 
Tornado warnings had been broadcast for hours, and when the sirens finally announced that the twisters had arrived, many people across the South took shelter and saved their lives. But others simply had nowhere safe to go, or the storms proved too powerful, too numerous, too unpredictable. 
At least 54 people were killed and hundreds injured Tuesday and Wednesday by dozens of tor­nadoes that plowed across Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Alabama. It was the nation's deadliest barrage of twisters in almost 23 years. 
"We had a beautiful neighbor­hood. Now it's hell," said Bonnie Brawner, 80, who lives in llartsville, a community about an hour from Nashville where a nat­ural gas plant that was struck by a twister erupted in spnetacular !lames up to 400 feet high. 
The storms flattened entire streets, smashed warehouses and sent tractor-trailers flying. Houses were reduced to splin­tered piles of lumber. Some looked like life-size dollhduses, their walls sheared away. Crews going door-to-door to search for bodies had to contend with downed power lim~s. snapped trees and flipped-over cars. Cattle wandered through the debris near hard-hit Lafayette (pronounced luh-FAY-et). At least 12 people died in and around the town. 
"It looks likn the Lord took a Brillo pad and scrubbed the ground," said Tennessee Gov. Phil Brmlesen, who surv<~yed the damage from a helicopter. 

Hundreds of houses were dam­aged or destroyed. Authorities had no immediate cost estimate of the damage. 
President Bush gave assur­ances his administration stood ready to help. Teams from the Federal Emergency Management Agency were sent to the region and activated an emergency cen­ter in Georgia. 
"Loss of life, loss of property ­prayers can help and so can the government," Bush said. "I do want the people in those states to know the American people are standing with them." 
Students took cover in donnito­ry bathrooms as the storms closed in on Union University in Jackson, Tenn. More than 20 stu­dents at the Southern Baptist school were trapped behind wreckage and jammed doors after the dormitories came down around them. 
Danny Song was pinned for an hour and a half until rescuers dug him from the rubble. 
"We looked up and saw the funnel coming in. We started running and then glass just exploded," he said. "I hit the floor and a couch was shoved up against me, which may have saved my life because the roof fell on top of it." 
With five minutes' warning from TV news reports, Nova and Ray Story huddled inside their home outside Lafayette and came out unscathed. But nearby, their uncle, Bill Clark, was injured in his toppled mobile home. 
They put him in the bed of their pickup to take him to a hos­pital, and neighbors with chain saws tried to clear a path. What normally would have been a 30­minute drive to the hospital took well more than two hours because the roads were clogged with debris. Clark died on the way. 
ing in Alaska's remote communi­ties. Nunam lqua, for example, has no housing to offer a VPSO. 
The mayor said there have been several burglaries in the village in recent months and a suspicious fire that badly dam­aged the tribal office. Those cases have not been solved. Adams said having a VPSO would at least be a deterrent to crime. 
"We never have anyone patrolling, and that encourages young people to steal," he said. "Enforcing the law would be a lot of help." 
VPSOs function as all-around emergency responders in remote communities, answering calls about family disputes, drown­ings, suicides, fires and search and rescues, and protecting crime scenes until troopers arrive. Most VPSOs are natives themselves. 
A state task force has taken a long, hard look at the VPSO pro­gram, created in 1979. The panel released its recommenda­tions last week, calling for hefty raises from the current base pay of $16.55 an hour to $21, a boosting of the force from 51 ollicers to 111 over the next four years, and help in developing housing lor them. 

Every village with more than 150 residents would get one VPSO. Communities with more than 500 residents would get two.

Lighten up, student government 
I don't think I've met Bob Reish, Grant Sehmidt or George Chamberlain. And the only time I ever met Maris Braun was drunkenly spending my Domer Dollars on a brat at the Stadium, appropriately. She seemed very friend­ly. 
I have nothing against any of them in particular ­and, to be honest, I don't think that a voto for one ovor another will make a substantive diller­once on my senior year. 
But each year, we hit this point of the student govern­ment elections and the cult or student government opens its doors to the rest of us and imagines we care to enter. I don't want to repeat the tired argument that student government doesn't matter. That argument ha<> bncome so tired that cam­paigns have started to aeknowlPdge it with a supPrficial distance, as il' they aren't part of the sometimes laughably self-contaim1d irrelevance that student groups-the stu­dent government, The Observer, the Society of Women Engineers -all suffer. 
My critique of student government isn't that simple. It's not that I think that stu­dent government can't make a difference­it can, for sure. It's the painful seriousness with which most candidates seem to take themselves. 
It's an easy mistake to make, and one of which I am guilty too. I'm so self-impor­tant that I feel compelled to publish my thoughts every other week. There are times when I approach this column the same way our candidates approach this election, as il' my choice of words about Hillary Clinton, Larry Craig, or Father Jenkins (now there's a threesome) consis­tently matter to people besides my mom and whichever person on campus has a vested interest in the column. I try to recti­fY that with an ironic self-awareness (and, apparently, a self-awareness about that

self-awareness). 
(And now I'm so caught up in myself 
that I spent an entire paragraph -heck, 
an entire column-suggesting that I have 
the solution). 

There are two serious pairs of candi­
dates this year-I'll give Giants-over-the­
Pats odds (note: this paragraph was writ­
ten before Sunday evening) to anybody 
who bets on anybody besides Maris and 
George or Bob and Grant. But both cam­
paigns -especially Bob and Grant's ­
border on self-parody. 
Maris Braun and George Chambnrlain can take us "from tradition to innovation­exceeding expectations." Please. 
And their Web site: "We come to you today with a simple goal of exceeding the expectations. needs, and desires of this student body because, quite frankly, most of the issues that affect a freshman in Carol, a senior in Zahm, a sophomore in PW, or a 5th year architect student oll'­campus affect us, too." 
Maris and George, representative of the Notre Dame student body, know that they can best represent "Carol" (yes, Carol) Ilall. They can also represent Dylan. And Louis. 
But Bob and Grant arc the worst ollfmd­ers. From everything I've heard, Bob Reish is a really nice kid. He's a really nice kid who really wants to be student body president. lie's a really nice kid who really wants to be student body president and apparently doesn't understand that his campaign makes it shamelessly look like he really wants to be student body presi­dent. He and his running mate, Grant Schmidt, created bobandgrant.com (also registered under reishandschmidt.com). One of my friends who drinks gallons of the student government Kool-Aid thought it was a great idea -a catchy Web site that everybody remembers "better than squiggly rnbraun3 or whatever." 
Bobandgrant.com makes me want to vomit, and I haven't even had any Kool­Aid. Just by investing in "bobandgrant.com," they've gone above and beyond what anybody reasonably thinks you should for a student govern­ment election. 
Rudy Giuliani didn't even invest in 
RudyGiuliani.com when he was running 
for a somewhat more important presiden­
tial position. 
But Bob and Grant didn't stop there. Look at bobandgrant.eom. First, you go through the entry sereen, whkh (if you haven't been lueky enough to see itl some­what resembles the sort of "Click IIere to Enter" image that you might see on the Web site of the Bellagio. But it geL<> worse.

That's right, their self-named Web site reveals that thny were planning their stu­dent government campaign in Soptember or so. Ugh.

If Lent is the answer, what was the question? 
It is a Gospel scene made for prime-time TV-the confrontation between Jesus and Satan in the desert, which serves as the cli­max of Jesus' forty days of preparation before beginning his public ministry. It is the Scriptural basis 
of our season of  Fr. Lou Delfra  
Lent. But the story actually begins much earlier.... Our Lenten story begins in Eden ­in  Faithpoint  

Paradise, where everything is perfect. Plenty of food, animals like each other, Adam and Eve have no quarrels or jeal­ousy, and all live in peace. 
Then, an apple later-and Paradise is suddenly lost. How did it end? If Lent is part of the solution, then what was the problem'? If we are to live Lent well, it is good to understand the reality it is helping us respond to. 
This is what the beginning of Genesis tries to teach us. There is an evil force in the world -symbolized by the Serpent ­that leads Adam and Eve out of Paradise. It is the force responsible for what we call temptation-and Lent is a response to the challenge of temptation. 
So how were Adam and Eve tempted'? The first temptation is simply this: the ser­pent says to Adam and Eve, "Look how nice that apple looks! Wouldn't you feel better, more full of life, if you just had that apple'?" 
As a human being, you wish we had got­ten thrown oil' by something a little more complieated -areal twisted plot that the serpent had to plan late into the night. But no-just "Hey, check out the apple. Wouldn't it feel good to eat that apple'? It's so much energy to resist the apple. Wouldn't it be easier to just eat it and get it over with? If God didn't want you to eat that apple, why would he have made it look so good in the first place'? And why would he have given you this desire to eat it? If you desire it, then it's yours." 
It's not difficult to see why a lot of com­mentators on Genesis describe the first sin as a sexual sin -because the first thing the serpent uses to divert us is our appetites, our human desires. But, it seems to me, the heart of the sin wasn't sexual. Really, it was thinking that just because we want something, it's therefore our right to have it. That is, the sin seems to be think­ing that the world was created just for me. 
There's an apple. I want the apple. Therefore, the apple's mine. That's the first temptation. 
The second and third temptations then follow from this first one. In the second temptation. the Serpent says to Adam and Eve, "If you eat this apple, you will become like God." And the third is, "Ifyou eat it, you will know what is good and what is evil." That is to say, "If you eat it, you become the one who makes the rules for how the world is ordered. You become God." 
What is it that has led us human beings ofl' the right road? What is it that messes up our Paradise'? A'i I read Genesis, it is this: replacing God's will with our will. Or, as St. Augustine wrote, 'The root of all sin is pride"-removing God from the center of the universe, and placing ourselves 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
The passing of a true legend 
Amidst the excitement and hubbub of the Super Bowl, Super Tuesday, and even National Letter of Intent Day, Notre Dame lost one of its quiet giants on Monday morning, with the passing of Father ArthurS. Harvey, at the ripe old age of97. 
Father Harvey, or "Father Art" as he was known to thousands of his students, passed away peacefully at Holy Cross House, where he spent some tough final years of his life both bed ridden and unable to eat solid food. And yet, his spirit was lively to the end, and his legacy as one of the great priests of Notre Dame will forever remain. 
Father Art spent over 60 years of his life at Notre Dame, and is largely responsi­ble for the acclaim and prestige that the theater department enjoys today. His pro­ductions in Washington Hall were reviewed the world over, and his close frien­ships with Broadway legend Helen Hayes, Notre Dame alumnus Phil Donahue and others are well known. He even came out of retirement one last time in 1989 to direct a revival of his most acclaimed production, Arthur Miller's "Death of a Salesman." 
Several years ago the University Fathers honored Father Art by creating the ArthurS. Harvey award for Theater Excellence. It was something of which he was especially proud in his final years, as he would mentor up and coming theater stu­dents and priests right from his bed. But more than just awards, Father Harvey will be, and should be remembered, as the very embodiment of a priest-a coun­selor, a mentor, a friend, and an instructor. His legions oftheater students, many going on to great acclaim on stage and screen, would tell you of his insistence on getting the best of his people, his unbending demands for excellence, and his encouragement and guidance, that for most people, lasted well beyond their four years at Notre Dame. 
I was lucky enough to know another side of Father Harvey-that of a family friend as well. His "halftime" Masses, given in our kitchen and living room during Notre Dame football games, became legendary around our house and among my visiting friends and roommates. But it was a prayer that he always prayed aloud during the lL'it of intentions that has stuck with me all these years, and tells you most about the man: "Father," he would intercede, "we add our prayers for one person, somewhere, who needs your help more than anything right now. Someone who is alone, who is struggling, and who doesn't know where to turn. Only you know who that person is. We ask you to be with that person right now, and give them your comfort and blessings, and have them know that you are with them." That was Father Harvey. 
His funeral Mass will be held in the Basilica next Monday afternoon. If you are walking by, to or from class, and hear the bells toll, be happy, for we will be inside celebrating the wonderful life of a true Notre Dame man. 
Godspeed Father Harvey!

there. 

Well, it all seems pretty depressing-if only because it all seems only too familiar. In many ways, we succumb to this tempta­tion all the time. 
And yet, there is a way out. There is cause for hope. 
The Gospels announce the birth of Jesus. Then, immediately, Jesus is grown, and fol­lows the Spirit into the desert, where he encounters the Serpent. And where Adam failed, Jesus triumphs. 
As the story unfolds, it is not surprising to see that the Serpent hasn't changed much. He tempts Jesus with the same three temptations. He begins with our appetites, our most basic human desires. "Take these stones and turn them into bread. Relieve your hunger. Use what's in the world for what you want, for satisfac­tion." 
But Jesus refuses: "We do not live by bread alone, but on the Word of God. We do not live merely according to our human desires, but according to a much deeper desire to hear God's will for our lives, and to follow it." 
A second time, Satan says, "Cast yourself down and let the angels save you." It is the serpent in the garden, whispering in our ear, "Become like God. Do what you wish. You are God. You are at the center of the universe. Everything will reconfigure itself according to what you want. Be petty. Use others. Everything and everybody else will rearrange themselves to accommodate you." That's temptation. 
And in the third temptation, Satan comes clean. No more hiding his intent: "Worship me and the whole universe is yours." It is the Serpent again: "Eat this apple, and all the secrets of the universe are yours." 
Jesus' answer: "The Lord alone is God. God alone shall you serve." It is a simple, yet powerful assertion, a profession of faith, that God is at the center of the Universe, ordering and guiding all things. True happiness -the restoration of Paradise -comes in allowing our will to be aligned with God's. 
Of course, this is sometimes hard to ful­fill. In fact, only one human has ever accomplished it totally. So we ought not try this at home on our own! 
Rather, let Christ live within us. Stay faithful to Christ. A'i St. Paul writes, "In the sin ofAdam. we have all become lost. But in the righteousness of Christ, we have all been saved." 
Lent is about far more than what we give up, although that often seems to attract most of our attention. In Lent, we fast and sacrifice for a reason -to try, in the midst of our hun1an shortcomings and sometimes overeager attachments, to enter more fully and freely into a living relationship with Christ. This Lent, give up what you will­but do so that you might be freer to put on Christ. He is the way back to Paradise. He is the answer to the deepest questions of our life.

Stop the climate change propaganda 
Professor Darcia Narvaez makes a statement in her column ("A call to conserve," Feb. 5) that manmade glob­al climate change will be "profoundly affecting the survival of most if not all planetary life forms" if immediate action is not taken to stabilize emis­sions of greenhouse gas equivalent. That climate change could cause the extinction of most or all species on the planet is a very frightening prospect, to be sure, but is it grounded in fact? 
A cursory survey of available evi­dence from previous climactic shifts, 20th century warming and studies on the effects of warming on species reveal that the professor's statement is actually nothing more than fearmon­gering. 
First, consider the observations from the 20th century. If climate change will cause unprecedented extinctions across all variations of life, then one would expect that the 0.7 degrees Celsius of warming observed empirical­ly in the 20th century would have definitively caused at least a few extinctions. 
However, a Chris D. Thomas survey in 2004 found that global climactic shifts have caused one extinction (that of the Golden Toad of Costa Rica). That global warming should be implicated in so few extinctions is surprising, espe­cially when one considers that Thomas' survey actively sought to implicate global warming in extinctions. 
Furthermore, some evidence suggests that even that estimate may have been an overestimate. If warming has caused at maximum one extinction in the 20th century, claims that warming this century will threaten all life on Earth are highly suspect. 
Secondly, to state that manmade warming will threaten the very exis­tence life on the planet is inconsistent with historical data. Most species extant today have existed for at least one million years, and during this peri­od species had to endure climate events ranging from the Holocene Climate Optimum (with temperatures warmer than IPCC estimates for 2100) to the ice ages to the shutdown of the Gulf Stream. 
To claim that modern species that adapted to past climate changes will suddenly become completely unable to adapt to modern changes is absurd. A wide body of evidence suggests that the net effect of warming on biodiversity is not negative. 
Surveys of many plants, animals and fungi find that warming overall expands their ranges of livable habi­tats, as the Northern boundary expands and the Southern boundary remains more or less constant. This growth in habitat predicted by warm­ing should, if anything, expand biodi­versity, not destroy all life on earth. 
In conclusion, based on a wide range of evidence (some not mentioned in this letter due to length), Professor Narvaez's claim that C02-induced warming will threaten life on the plan­et is nothing more than fearmongering. 
I do not disagree with the professor's endorsements of alternative energy investment or individual energy con­servation, as both produce long-term and short-term benefits, but her use of wildly exaggerated fear-driven claims is unacceptable.

ND, Weis back on the right track for now 

Notrn Dame coach Charlie Weis show<~d up at his National Signing Day press confenmce with ashns on his forehead. but lw has almady had his 40 clays of sufl'nring­1:~ wonks. to bn morn accuratn.

The coaches and players drew criticism from thn media and the fans through­out last season, and. even though hn would nevnr admit it, Weis had to fen! that pressure: allega­tions that he wasted tho summer on tho wrong quartnrback, that he was too conservative ofl'en­sively, that the spark that got him tho honorific "oll'ensive genius" had somehow fizzled out. 
Allor Wednesday, Weis has the chanc~n to silence all his eritics. 
Now hn has the chance to ern­ate his fi10tball tnam in his imago. One excuse Weis sympa­thizers used last season is that Weis had to make do with "Ty's Guys" and that his recruits were too young and inexperienced to make an immediate impaet. 
That won't be the case in 2008, with the roster now almost com­pletely filled with players Weis recruited. 
Weis said he felt this recruiting class was perfect in filling the holes he thought his team had. 
"If you had told me the number was 23, how many of each posi­tion you want. that was the most significant part. to not only bring in good players but to fill a bunch of holes," Weis said. 


What this means is simple: Notre Dame had bettnr be good next year. · 
The true fans paid th<~ir dues and then some during last year's mnbarrassment (by anyone's standards, and especially at a place with as much history as Notre Dame) and deserve to be rewarded with a good season next fall. The 2008 season should bring a rejuvenated oflense and a much better defense -in no small part thanks to the recruits. 
The general theme of Wednesday's news conference was versatility. Corners who can hit like safeties. Defensive ends who are fast enough to play line­backer. Offensive linemen who ean play all five spots. 
More so than filling speci!ic holes, Weis needed to use this recruiting class to adapt Notre Dame to his ofl'ensive scheme and especially defensive coordi­nator Corwin Brown's 3-4 defense. 
Last season, a lot of players had to switeh positions and adapt to the 3-4 with mixed results. Defensive end Trevor Laws dominated on the strong side and Maurice Crum and Joe Brockington looked very eom­fortable as the inside lineback­ers.

CD REVIEW 
By JAMES COSTA Assistant Scene Editor 

Not quite the Killers' third album, "Sawdust" is a compila­tion of b-sides, covers and out­takes garnered from sessions recorded for the band's previous two albums -"Hot Fuss" and "Sam's Town." Like the gesture of other bands who offer recordings that never saw the light of day on an official release, the record seems geared more toward the real fans of the band who've been waiting to hear tracks and demos ever since the smashing debut of "Hot Fuss." 
Surprisingly, the CD holds up quite well on its own merits. While it does not have the f1ow or arch seen on "Hot Fuss" and especially on the epic, Western­themed "Sam's Town," it also makes no qualms about being concentrated far more on the individuality of the tracks. It's an approach that works, since the band has an all-original third

The Killers Label: Island Recommended Tracks: "Tranquilize" and "Leave the Bourbon on the Shelf' 
album in the works -which makes "Sawdust" a very hearty and satisfying appetizer to what is sure to be a deliciously innova­tive and forward-moving main course. 
Early on, we get the track "Leave The Bourbon On The Shelf." Never before released in any capacity, it's a song that's already been acquiring an almost legendary significance to fans of the band who know that it is the lost, first 
element of the "Murder Trilogy" on "Hot Fuss." Now released, it fills in ahead of "Jenny was a Friend of Mine" and then "Midnight 
"Under the Gun" is a particular­ly strong song, and it's hard to tell why it didn't make the first album. Armed with an infectious and rollicking chorus of "Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now," it's a subtle anthem to those moments when you can't be sure what's going on, but know it's bad. 
The band makes a few blunders by adding covers to the "Sawdust" mix. It gets especially bad in its cover of Joy Division's "Shadowplay." The new version just isn't good and should not have been done in the first place -much less put on a CD for peo­ple to spend their hard earned money on.

Arguably the band's most popu­lar album, "Hot Fuss" is extreme­
ly present on "Sawdust" with a bunch of tracks that didn't quite make the final cut. These include "Under the Gun," "Show You How," "Glamorous Indie Rock and Roll," "Who Let You Go" and "The Ballad of Michael Valentine." Indeed, it's almost enough for a "Hot Fuss EP." 

Killers, doesn't bring anything new to the semi­nally classic song. The tune isn't bad, but it's nothing new either. At best, it'll introduce some new listeners to the brilliance of Dire Straits. 
If anything, buy the album for "Tranquilize," the opening track, which is also a duet with Lou Reed. 
"Sawdust" is good. It's not "Sam's Town," and it's certainly not "Hot Fuss." But, it has its moments, and certainly will whet your appetite till Flowers and company drop the next real album.

Lawyers present physical evidence on Clemens
J. 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK Brian McNamee's lawyers said Wednesday they gave federal prosecutors physical evidence backing the personal trainer's allegation that Hoger Clemens used performance-enhancing drugs. 
"I think this is a significant point in the case. We believe that this is significant corrobo­ration," said McNamee's lead lawyer. Earl Ward. 
McNamee's side turned over syringes with Clemens' blood to IHS Special Agent Jeff Novitzky in early January, a p~rson familiar with the evi­dence said, speaking on condi­tion of anonymity because McNamnn's lawynrs did not want to publicly discuss details. The syringes were used to inject Clemens with steroids and human growth hormone, the person said. A second person. also speaking on : on d ition of anonym i t y, said the evidence was from 2000 and 2001. 
Lanny Breuer, one of' Clenwns' lawyers, immediate­ly responded that McNamee "apparently has manufactured evidence" and called all the allegations "desperate smears. 
"It is just not credible," Breuer said in a statement. "Who in their right mind does such a thing?" 
In December's Mitchell Heport on doping in baseball, McNamee said he injected Clnmens with performance­enhancing drugs in 1998, 2000 and 2001.

By denying under oath that he used performance-enhanc­ing drugs, Clemens put him­self at legal risk if prosecutors determine his testimony was­n't truthful. 
Hichard Emery, another of McNamee's lawyers, said the committee will be given a description of the evidence that was turned over to prose­cutors.

Keith Ausbrook, the commit­tee's Hepublican general coun­sel, told The Associated Press the committee was not aware that such physical evidence existed. 
"Unknown and unexpected evidence comes in at all times in any investigation," Ausbrook wrote in an e-mail. "We will still need to examine McNamee's evidence and hear what he has to say." 
McNamee, the former per­sonal trainer for Clemens and Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte, also told former Senate major­ity leader George Mitchell that he injected Pettitte with HGH. Pettitte confirmed in December that he used HGH for two days. 
Emery said McNamee's legal team planned to hold a news conference following their client's deposition in Washington on Thursday and will discuss the evidence in greater detail then. Because the items were turned over several years after the events under discussion, Clemens' side could challenge whether it was tampered with. 
"Brian McNamee is obvious­ly a troubled man who is obsessed with doing every­thing possible to destroy Hoger Clemens," Breuer said in a statement. "McNamee lied to the police who were investi­gating him for sexual assault, he lied to Senator Mitchell, he lied to the federal govern­ment, and now he apparently has manufactured evidence. lie has changed his story repeatedly on this matter. lie claims to love Roger Clemens, he says he modeled being a father on Roger Clemens, he said Roger treated him like family -but he now claims he kept blood, gauze, and needles from Roger Clemens for seven years. It defies all sensibility." 
Emery said it was unneces­sary for McNamee's side to persuade the Justice Department that the evidence was authentic. 
"They'll decide themselves what they believe is the case and make their own decisions based on the facts as they have it. All we know is what we believe is the truth," Emery said.

NCAA BASKETBALL 
Duke pulls away late to grab top spot in ACC ... 
Top-ranked Memphis rolls over SMU to remain undefeated; No. 8 Wisconsin stays hot by edging host Iowa 
Associated Press 
CHAPEL IIILL, N.C. -Duke has spent the entire season erasing memories of last year's un-Duke-like struggles. Now, after an impressive win against their biggest rivals, the Blue Devils are starting to look like a team that fits right in with their storied tradition. 
Greg Paulus scored 18 points and was one of six players in double figures in the second­ranked Blue Devils' 89-78 win over the third-ranked Tar Heels on Wednesday night, ending a three-game losing streak in the heated rivalry. 
Jon Scheyer added 17 points for Duke (20-1, 8-0 Atlantic Coast Conference), which repeatedly knocked down 3­point shots to control the game almost the entire way. Duke led by as many as 11 points in the tirst half and never trailed after the break, beating the short­handed Tar Heels for the first time since the 2005-06 season. 
Picked to finish second in the ACC, the Blue Devils figured to be too small up front to contend with the favored Tar Heels this year. Yet behind a spread-the­floor attack that creates matchup problems all over the court, Duke is alone atop the league and looking like a good bet to win the regular-season race. 
"They're pretty special right now," Blue Devils coach Mike Krzyzewski said. "We know who we ·are. We're a very unconven­tional team. We're not a strong physical team, but we are strong team emotionally, a real together group. 
"You have to hope you don't get killed by a team for a stretch by their strength. You have to find a way and because we have versatile players we've been able to do that so far." 
Duke shot 46 percent and went 13-for-29 from 3-point range, with Paulus going 6-for-8 from behind the arc. That was just too much on the perimeter for the Tar Heels (21-2, 6-2), who played without injured point guard Ty Lawson and seemed like they had to fight the entire way just to stay within reach. 
"We definitely drove the ball and got a couple good penetrate and kicks," Paulus said. "''m not sure what we shot, but it seemed like whenever we need­ed a 3, we had guys who took big s~ots and knocked them down. 
Tyler Hansbrough had 28 points and 18 rebounds in what became virtually a one-man effort, but the Tar Heels looked a step off all night with Lawson watching from the bench after spraining his left ankle in the weekend win at Florida State. 
North Carolina twice closed to within a point early in the sec­ond half, but Duke never wavered or looked flustered in a hostile environment. 
"We're looking to take over this league," said Gerald Henderson, who had 12 points for the Blue Devils. "We hope that we can continue to play like this and win like this .... We just want to continue to add in the left side of the column." 
It was a surprisingly one-sided outcome in a rivalry that drew plenty of notable onlookers, including former Tar Heels bas­ketball players Raymond Felton and Sean May, former Tar Heels football star Julius Peppers and even former Democratic presi­dential candidate John Edwards. 
Tigers 77, Mustangs 48 
Reserve guard Andre Allen scored a career-high 19 points, Joey Dorsey had 10 points and 14 rebounds and top-ranked Memphis beat SMU on Wednesday night. 
Memphis (22-0, 8-0 Conference USA) extended the nation's longest home-court winning streak to 45 games. 
The Tigers led 40-18 at the half, shot 43.3 percent and com­mitted only seven turnovers in the game, including one in the first half. 

Bamba Fall and Jon Killen scored 12 points apiece for SMU (7-13, 1-6). 
Tigers coach John Calipari benched forward Robert Dozier and didn't start center Dorsey, both of whom had started the team's first 19 games. 
The Tigers struggled in the game's opening minutes with the new look, missing seven of their first eight shots and falling behind 7-3 after Fall's left-hand­ed hook fell. 
Calipari eventually got a spark from Allen, who fueled a 14-3 run with two 3-pointers and a driving layup. The Tigers fol­lowed that run with another, scoring 15 of the game's next 17 points on their way to 40-18 halftime lead. 
Allen had another 3-pointer during the second run. 
Allen had 11 points at the half and Willie Kemp, another reserve guard, scored seven. 
In the second half, the Tigers stretched their lead to 40 points. SMU has lost eight of its last nine games. 
Badgers 60, Hawkeyes 54 
Marcus Landry scored 16 points, Brian Butch added 12 and No. 8 Wisconsin held off Iowa on Wednesday night for its 13th victory in 14 games. 
Joe Krabbenhoft had eight points and eight rebounds to help the Badgers (19-3, 9-1 Big Ten) pull into a tie for first place in the Big Ten with surprising Purdue. 
Iowa didn't make it easy on Wisconsin, staying within one score for most of the second half, but the Badgers hit 10 straight free throws in the final 
3:29 to seal their 10th win in 11 meetings with the Hawkeyes (11-13, 4-7). 
With Iowa down 54-51 with 59 seconds left, Wisconsin's Marcus Landry blocked Tony Freeman's layup, giving posses­sion back to the Badgers. Jason Bohannon hit two free throws, but Iowa's Jeff Peterson answered with a 3 with 25.6 seconds left. 
Krabbenhoft hit another pair from the line to make it 58-54. Justin Johnson then missed a 3, and Landry finished things off with two free throws. 
Freeman led Iowa with 18 points, 12 of which came in the first half. Cryus Tate added 15 points and eight boards. The game featured 13 lead changes and seven ties.

conference, one that began with video highlights and Latin music. After an extended peri­od for still and video cameras and a brief statement by Santana, the Mets turned up the house lights of Shea Stadium's Diamond Club for questions. 
Santana answered many with cliches, speaking how he would take things one day at a time, that success was a team effort and that he will have to make adjustments to pitching in the National League. He understands that Mets fans demand a World Series cham­pionship -or at least an NL pennant -immediately fol­lowing last year's September collapse.

ace for his staff. looked on from his front­row seat. 
"You should be happy, Willie," Minaya said. 
Ten days before the first spring training workout for pitchers and catchers in Port St. Lucie, Fla., Santana's teammates were excited. 
"Somewhat it allows us to officially, kind of completely shut the book on '07," Mets third baseman David Wright said Tuesday. "It kind of takes away from, I guess, kind of the aura of what happened at the end of last year. We can kind of put that behind us. And when your superstars have a fresh attitude, looking ahead rather than behind, I think that that rubs off on the rest of the team." 
Santana, a two-time AL Cy Young Award winner, was just 15-13 last year and lost seven of his last 11 decisions as ·his ERA rose from 2.60 to 3.33 ERA, his highest since 2001. He allowed a career-high 33 homers -the most in the AL. 
"I don't know, man. It's part of the game. You're going to have slumps, I guess," he said. "I don't really have an answer for it." 
His agent, Peter Greenberg, revealed that the deadline for the Twins to make a trade was mutually agreed to with Minnesota general manager Bill Smith around Jan. 22. The initial deadline was Jan. 28, but the sides agreed to push it back a day because executives of some of the interested teams weren't available. 
Santana had a full-no trade clause, which meant he could control his destination. Greenberg said the Mets were Santana's first choice but that all three bidders were accept­able. 
"I think he would have been perfectly happy if he had went to Yankees. I think he would have been perfectly happy if he had went to the Red Sox," Greenberg said. 
The Mets were not the only team to add an ace this offsea­son. 
The NL West champion Arizona Diamondbacks acquired Dan Haren from Oakland, giving them a nasty 1-2 punch of right-banders in their prime. Haren and Brandon Webb, the 2006 NL Cy Young Award winner, should win enough games all by themselves to at least make the young Diamondbacks con­tenders again. 
Just imagine if 44-year-old Randy Johnson and his creaky back are healthy, too.

PARIS -Elena Dementieva of Russia and Agnes Szavay of Hungary overcame resistance from unseeded opponents Wednesday to reach the quar­terfinals of the Open Gaz de France. 
The fourth-seeded Dementieva defeated Petra K vitova 7-6 (7), 6-2 while No. 7 Szavay beat Tathiana Garbin 6-3, 4-6, 6-2. 
Kvitova traded two breaks of serve with Dementieva, foreing a tiebreaker where two unforced errors cost the Czech qualilier the first set. 
"During the tiebreaker, it was so dose," Dementieva said. "I knew I had to go for the winner. Otherwise, she was going to kill the ball. She was going for the winner all the time. I didn't want to play defensive today." 
Kvitova had opportunities again in the seeond set, but wasted five break points to let Dementieva finish with a return winner. 
"I knew it was going to be a tough match for me because she won four matches here," Dementieva said. "She was play­ing really well today. She's serv­ing very hard and she has a very powerful play. It was not an easy first round for me." 
Meanwhile, Szavay earned an 
" 

early break in the third set and completed her victory on her second match point when Garbin netted a ground stroke. 
Szavay broke Garbin at 3-3 and won the first set when Garbin double-faulted. But the Italian saved three break points at 5-4 in the second and rallied to square the match. 
Dementieva will take on either Yuliana Fedak or Kateryna Bondarenko, both of Ukraine, while Szavay will meet the win­ner of Thursday's match between second-seednd Daniela llantuchova of Slovakia and Katarina Sn1botnik of Slovenia. 
Earlier on Wednesday, Frenchwomen Virginie Hazzano, Nathalie Deehy and Alizn Cornet advanced to thn second round. 
Hazzano outlast~d eighth­seeded Alona Bondarenko of Ukraine 6-2, 4-6, 7-5 to face Cornet, who beat Klara Zakopalova 4-6, 6-2, 6-1. Dechy edged Peng Shuai 6-4, 7-6 (8) and will next play top-seeded Anna Chakvetadze of Hussia. 
"I could have lost today against Alona," Hazzano said. "Two days ago, I could barely walk at the airport aftor arriving from China." 
She, Dechy, and Cornet were on the French team eliminated by China in the first round of the Fed Cup last weekend.

Belles-Scotsgame postponed 
SpeciaJ to The Observer 
Saint Mary's game Wednesday night against Alma was canceled due to 
inclement weather. 
The game has been rescheduled for tonight at 
7:30 p.m. at the Angela Atlhletic Center at Saint 
Mary's. 
The Belles are 9-10 overall and hold a 5-6 record in the M IAA. The Scots are 7-10 and 4-6 in conference play.

to 67-50. 
But the Irish responded with an 11-3 run to quiet the home crowd and strengthen their hold on second place in the Big East. The win was Notre Dame's sec­ond straight on the road after it lost its first two of the conference season. 
"I think we've really improved and learned from our mistakes," Kurz said. "We've gotten a lot better since the first two games." 
The run was one of many for the Irish, who outscored Seton Hall 18-3 during one stretch in the first half. That spurt was punctuated by a McAiarney 3­pointer with 7:19 remaining in the stanza. 
Kurz, Notre Dame's captain, said the team's ability to score in bunches is what makes it danger­ous. 
"We got in a flow early and really showed what we could do," he said. 

McAlarney finished with 19 points and helped the Irish shoot 45 percent from behind the arc. 
llarangody finished above his season scoring average of 20.4 and also displayed a new facet of his game as he spontaneously ran the point for the Irish. After a Seton Hall missed shot early in the second half, Harangody ripped down the rebound and dribbled the ball the length of the floor before finding Ryan Ayers for a 3-pointer. 
Kurz added 17 points and 10 boards in the win, Notre Dame's eighth in its last nine games against Seton Hall. 
Jeremy Hazell led the Pirates with 26 points on 8-of-14 shoot­ing.

Kurzplays steady role in offense 
By FRAN TOLAN Sports Writer 
After Notre Damn's S9-iW win over DePaul last Thursday, Blue Demons eoaeh Jnrry Wainwright had plenty to talk about. He eould havn talked about how Notre Dame drilled eluteh shot arter duteh shot down the streteh. 
But in his postgame press eonferenee, Wainwright emphasized that Irish forward Rob Kurz is the "most under­appreciated player" in the Big East. 
In his ehat with the mndia soon after, Irish eoaeh Mike Brey emphatically agreed. 
And how could he not? 
Kurz-the team's lone sen­ior -is averaging 13 points and 8.1 rebounds per game. But with Kurz's fronteourt­mate Luke llarangody on the short list of Big East player of the year candidates and junior Kyle McAiarney sporadieally erupting for 30-plus points. Kurz is rarely even men­tioned. 
Maybe he warrants attention so infrequently beea use his numbers are usually pretty constant. For instanee, he put

Squad prepares for top-ranked teams 
Weather delays NO's arrival to tournament 
By LORENZO REYES Sports Wri rer 
Notre Dame head coach Jay Louderback has a routine that he expects his team to follow before tournaments. Usually, he will stress the squad's mistakes from previous matches and focus on hitting to prepare for the contest. 
This time around, however, Mother Nature wasn't cooperat­ing with his program. 
En route to the ITA National Women's Team Indoor Championship in Madison, Wise., the Irish faced some inclement weather. Unable to continue to Madison. they were forced to stay the night at a motel between South Bend and Madison. 
"We're stuck in the middle of Wisconsin," Louderback said. "We were lucky to get a room actually. There was a pretty bad traftie accident, and with all the snow, we decided to call it a night, and head over there tomorrow morning." 
Fortunately for the Irish, they aren't scheduled to play No. 6 Georgia in the first round of the tournament until 4:30 p.m. today at the Nielsen Stadium in Madison. 
The team iost to Georgia Tech in the championship game of this tournament last season. 
A total of 16 teams await the No. 16 Irish when they make it to Madison, including No. 1 Stanford, No. 2 UCLA, No. 3 Northwestern, No. 4 and defend­ing champions Georgia Teeh. as well as No. 7 California. 
Coaeh Louderback bnlieves the tournament is an excellent way for his team to gain experience playing some of the best compe­tition in the nation. 
"We're guaranteed at least three matches this weekend," Louderback said. "And when you play some of the best tnams in the nation, you're going to have some great games and experiences."
