APPhoto Kuwaiti volunteers wave guns and their national flag after graduating from a month-long basic military train­ing course Monday. The U.S. and U.S.S.R set Jan. 15 as the target date for Iraq's withdrawal. 
(AP)-The United States and the Soviet Union have fixed Jan. 15 as a deadline for Iraq to get out of Kuwait, or face the pos­sibility of a military strike to drive it out, diplomats said Tuesday. 
Three Americans. waving Iraqi flags and criticizing their government, arrived in Jordan after being freed by Saddam Hussein. 
The deadline for an Iraqi withdrawal had been the only sticking point in a draft U.N. Security Council resolution agreed upon by the five perma­nent members of the council. The measure is expected to be voted on by the full council on Thursday. 
In a fresh sign that the Baghdad government is bracing for war, the Pentagon said Iraq is rapidly increasing its troop strength in Kuwait and south­ern Iraq. It said Iraq has 450,000 troops in the region, an increase of 20,000 over last week. 
The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, meanwhile, questioned whether it is really in the "vital interest" of the United States to use mili­tary force to liberate Kuwait, the oil-rich emirate Iraq seized on Aug. 2. 
The freed Americans, whose families had traveled to Iraq to plead with Saddam for their re­lease, told reporters at the Amman airport that the Bush administration had ignored their plight. 
"I was not released with help from my government," said John Stevenson of Panama City, Fla. "It was my family who did it." 
The United States has de­manded the unconditional re­lease of all of the hundreds of foreigners held hostage in Iraq, and the State Department has discouraged private hostage­freeing missions. 

Another freed American, Clyde Jesse of Buffalo Grove, Ill.. suggested the United States should negotiate with Saddam. "I believe it is time we started talking." he said. 
The third freed American was

John Major succeeds Thatcher as British prime minister 
LONDON (API -John Major, Pndorsed by Margaret Thatcher as the politician closest to her heart, was elected by the Conservative Party Tuesday night to succeed her as prime minister. 
Major, 47, fell two votes short of winning a majority in voting among the 372 Conservative Party members of Parliament, but his two opponents quickly conceded defeat and the party confirmed Major as the winner. 
Thatcher, ending 11 112 years in power, intended to submit her resignation to Queen Elizabeth II on Wednesday morning, and Major would then be called to lead the govern­ment. 
Major, the chancellor of the exchequer, emerged from his official residence at 11 Downing St. Tuesday night smiling and

holding hands with his wife, Norma. Inside, Thatcher, who came next door from the prime minister's 10 Downing Street residence, embraced Major. "I am thrilled and delighted that John Major is to succeed me," the "Iron Lady" said in a statement released by aides. 
"It is a very exciting thing to become leader of the 
John Major

Conservative Party, and partic­ularly exciting, I think, to follow has ever had," Major said. one of the most remarkable "Our job now I think is quite leaders the Conservative Party clear. We are going to unite to­
tally and absolutely, and we're going to win the next general election," said Major, who will be the youngest British prime minister in this century. 
Major received 185 votes, two short of a majority. Former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine received 131 and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd had 56. 
Hurd and Heseltine conceded within minutes, and party offi­cials declared Major elected. 
The party had been torn by the sudden and unexpected leadership challenge by Heseltine, who last week stopped Thatcher short of vic­tory in the first round of the leadership race. 
Thatcher had not wanted to leave office. but she decided to resign last week after she was unable to put down Heseltine's challenge. 
She said she resigned to let someone from the Cabinet stand against Heseltine. Major and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd both joined the race, but before the vote her aides spread the word that she was backing Major. 
The son of a circus performer and at one time a welfare recip­ient, Major personifies the val­ues of self-reliance and hard work that Thatcher had preached to the nation. 
Gorbachev, Yeltsin try to reach agreement on treaty 
MOSCOW (AP) -Mikhail Gorbachev and political rival Boris Yeltsin clashed Tuesday over a proposed treaty binding the 15 Soviet republics, and emerged with a compromise that Yeltsin called "a victory for common sense." 
Gorbachev's Communist Party allies in the Russian republic's Congress of Peoples' Deputies tried to persuade the body to vote on a new union treaty that Gorbachev is pushing to arrest the disintegration of central authority. 
The issue boils down to a contest between central author­ities, led by Gorbachev, and au­thorities in each of the re­publics that are arrayed behind Yeltsin. 
The Russian Congress is highly sympathetic to Gorbachev. He wanted it to ap­prove the union treaty in order to pressure Yeltsin to sign the republic. 
"There will be no (Soviet) Union without Russia, nor will Russia be able to exist without the union (treaty)," Gorbachev told reporters during a break. 
"We've got to pass it in one or two months, or it will mean the breakup of the union." 
Six republics -the Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia -al­ready have said they will not sign the treaty pact. 
The Soviet president did not speak during Tuesday's session, but smiled broadly from an isolated balcony in the Grand Kremlin Palace as his allies engaged in a boisterous floor fight. 
Yeltsin, who quit the Communist Party last July after being elected president of the Russian Federation, hammered out a compromise under which the Congress would debate the 

pact on behalf of the Russian Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin addresses the extraordinary session of the Supreme Soviet Federation, the largest Soviet see SOVIETS I page 3 Tuesday at the Kremlin. Yeltsin refused to allow the passage of Gorbachev's proposed union treaty.

'Useless' majors don't get respect 
I have a terrible --------­
confession to make: I'm an American studies major. 
I don't know how students at other uni­versities respond to that statement, but at Notre Dame such a R b s· 
confession is bound 0 yn 1mmons to elicit statements Asst. Accent Editor such as, "Oh, that's the easy major." "Are you in it to meet foot­ball players?" and "What's that?" American studies majors suffer the same fate as students studying philosophy, theol­ogy, and just about any other major that doesn't attract recruiters to campus. Some of our fellow students tend to view us as having "useless" majors because the sub­jects are either "too easy" or our majors won't guarantee us a job with a starting salary of $30,000 right aftet graduation. I can't speak for other students in my major, but my own decision to become an American studies major was based on my interest in journalism, not a desire to meet athletes (not all of whom are in American studies) or to snack my way through col­lege. Basically, the only way I could take courses that interest me was to become an "Am-Stud." I don't know how the individual majors rank as far as the level of difficulty, and frankly I don't care. If I chose a more chal­lenging major in the College of Science I would have been miserable for four years because writing is what makes me happy. If those of us who have chosen "useless" majors are satisfied with our decision, then why are we made to feel as if we've made a big mistake? The biggest mistake a student can make is to choose a major and a pro­fession that doesn't even interest them. The yuppie culture that developed during the 1980s tended to undervalue professions that didn't rake in the big bucks, and our nation's college students began to embrace that philosophy. I don't think that all students who are shooting for an M.B.A. or some other pro­fessional school are money-grubbing weasels, but on the other hand I don't ap­preciate other students making me feel like something is wrong with me for choosing a major that's a few steps behind the fast track. As we near the end of the semester, many students are considering what major to de­clare. I hope that these students won't let others discourage them from choosing a major or career that interests them just be­cause the prospects look better in another field. So, on behalf of my fellow American stud­ies majors and other students who are in what other people have deemed "useless" majors, we are doing quite well, thank you, and we stand by our decision. I hope every­one at Notre Dame is as content with their major selection as I am with mine.

Assailants opened fire inside a game hall and by a nearby butcher shop in Gela, Sicily Tuesday night, killing eight people and wounding seven, police said. State tele­vision said the attacks were apparently carried out by a Mafia gang seeking to rub out members of a rival clan. Six were killed when the assailants sprayed gunfire inside a game hall crowded with people playing cards and bil­liards. Two others were gunned down in front of a butcher shop down the street. Nearly 100 people have been killed in violence between rival Mafia clans in Gela the past three years, according to news reports. The gangs are fighting for control of extortion rackets, drug trafficking and other illegal activities.

A former top federal regulator testified in Washing­ton Tuesday that Sen. Dennis DeConcini improperly of­fered him a deal on behalf of savings and loan owner Charles Keating, and that three other "Keating Five" se­nators acquiesced in the proposal. Edwin Gray, a star witness at the Senate Ethics Committee's hearings into the five senators' relationships with Keating, said DeConcini's offer at a 1987 meeting will be "etched in my mind forever." He said DeConcini, apparently speaking for the other three senators as well, asked that regula­tors not apply to Keating's embattled Lincoln Savings and Loan Association a rule limiting risky investments.

Gov. Booth Gardner declared emergen­cies in all but three western Washington counties.

A LaGrange woman who was separated from her daughter and bullied by a "deprogrammer" during 20 days of captivity wants her Amish husband and other abductors prosecuted, a prosecutor says. LaGrange County Prosecutor Susan Glick said Monday that Elma Miller feels "she lost 20 days of her life." During the ordeal, the 32-year-old woman was taken to five locations in Michigan, Ohio and Illinois, au­thorities say. She and her 9-year-old daughter, Annie, were kept apart. Authorities say Mrs. Miller was kidnapped by her estranged husband after she split from the Old Order Amish Church.

Conference scheduled to discuss death and divorce 
By CATHLEEN 
MCLAUGHLIN News Writer 
·An old tune says that there is "a time for every purpose under heaven" and specifically a time to mourn. 
Four years ago this need was verbalized to Kathleen Sullivan, director of Alumni Continuing Education, by Notre Dame stu­dents, alumni, and faculty. 
From this an annual confer­ence on death and divorce was created for members of the Notre Dame community. This year, the conference titled "Death, Divorce and Dismantled Dreams: Working Through The Pain," will take place Dec. 7-9. Registration will take place on Dec. 7 at the Center for Continuing Education. 
The conference will consist of brief presentations followed by interaction among small groups of participants. Seminars on the loneliness, fear, guilt, anger, and sadness associated with both death and divorce run concurrently throughout the weekend. 
Another element of the con­ference is the sharing of per­sonal experiences among par­ticipants. Attending all sessions is important, according to Sullivan, since it would be difficult to enter the intimate "sphere of caring and under­standing" if one did not get fully involved. 
The seminars on loss by death will be given by Pat Reynolds, a Saint Mary's grad­uate and co-founder of the program. Reynolds was a coun­selor at Highland Park Hospital in Illinois until she moved to Florida where she is continuing her therapy practice. 
In 1984, Reynolds lost her husband, which, she said, con­tributes to her ability to lead sessions on dealing with grief. In addition, she feels the con­ference is therapeutic for her. 
Discussions regarding divorce will be lead by Jim Faught, a

1971 Notre Dame graduate. Faught is trained as a family and divorce lawyer. Since 1979 he has been the assistant dean at Loyola School of Law, where he advises students on life de­cisions. Personal experience with divorce helps Faught lead the discussions. 
The program has earned im­mense praise from its partici­pants. A 1962 Notre Dame graduate, John Crowe, said, "This weekend has been the key to the rest of my life." 
The program organizers said they would like to increase at­tendance by students in partic­ular. One student attendee from last year's conference remarked that she was a bit nervous with mostly adults, "but the age range added character and competence to the program that would not have been pre­sent with only students." 
Those involved with the pro­gram said they recognize that many people may be apprehen­sive about their memories, but they say it is a risk worth taking to discover a weekend of hope. Judi McArdle, a past conference attendee, said, "At this program you can mourn loss in a safe place without judgement; for however it is you mourn, and 
for  whatever it is  you  are  
mourning."  
The  registration  fees  for  

alumni and Friends of the Uni­versity is $98. Notre Dame Staff members pay $50, and students pay $25. Kathleen Sullivan can be reached at the Alumni Continuing Education Office, 427 Administration Building, or by telephone at (219} 239-6186.

HPC debates off-campus event problems 
By DAVID KINNEY News Writer 

Solutions to problems occur­ring during off-campus events were discussed Tuesday night during the Hall Presidents' Council (HPC} meeting. 
According to Co-Chair Mary Dandurand, the Century Center has refused to host any Notre Dame student event. Several other establishments, including Union Station, are becoming increasingly wary of hosting NO events, said Dandurand. 
The centers have justified this new policy by citing harassment of security guards and students bringing alcohol to the events. 
"It's kind of sad," continued Dandurand, "that this kind of reputation of Notre Dame stu­dents has spread to the South Bend community."

The council attempted to find solutions to the problem. It was suggested that dances start earlier so that students do not drink beforehand, or that the bar be moved to the side so that it is not directly next to the dance floor. Dandurand sug­gested that perhaps formals could be held at on-campus fa­cilities, such as the Rockne Memorial, the Center for Continuing Education, or the Morris Inn.

'Universals' in education obstruct critical thinking 
Dear Editor: 
This is in response to John Barry's warped view of educa­tion (The Observer, Nov. 20). Barry makes many outrageous comments on education, but for the sake of brevity I will confme myself to a few of his more egregious views on "trendy" education. 
Regarding his view that the role of the university is to "teach universal knowledge," I would ask him to define what this knowledge is and how its gets to be universal. I suppose that Barry would defme this as any knowledge which is "western," not even getting into the fact that those in the West see knowledge-what it is, how it is gained, etc.-in different subjective terms, claiming that knowledge which is produced from a certain, narrow way of looking at the world is "universal" is the height of arrogance. 
His choice of John Silber to defend western civilization as not ethnocentric was very unfortunate indeed. Silber, as much as any of the other demagogues who have appeared on the scene in recent years to spew forth on these matters, is an ideal ex­ample of Western civilization gone awry. He has incorpo­rated the ethnocentrism which does indeed exist in our culture into his rhetoric, which, among other things, is highly racist and xenophobic. 
There are many things which we can learn from a non-white, non-male dominated society. I feel sorry for Barry and others like him who think that the only reason they are in college is to have certain "universal" knowledge imparted to them. If I were them I would not feel I was getting my money's worth. 
I always thought that school, rather than being a place where one crammed one's head full of facts, should be a place where one is taught to think, to be able to engage the outside world in a critical manner. If one views knowledge as "universal," then one can hardly act in a critical manner towards it. If one does not learn how to think, then having this knowledge will not do any good. 
Being taught certain facts in a rigid manner, which Barry seems to advocate, will do nothing but inculcate gener­ation after generation with a noncritical, one-sided view of the world-hardly the stuff of a dynamic, thinking society. 
The traditional teaching methods which Barry idolizes are, for the most part, only useful in perpetuating this dogma. The current way of teaching is very hierarchical and is based on the false as­sumption that the teacher knows everything and the stu­dents are only there to lap up what the teacher deigns to throw out to them. This is hardly the way to learn how to think. 
A curriculum based on the digestion of knowledge and then spewing it back out on tests really does not make much of a contribution to a person's intellectual develop­ment. Education based on grades as the ultimate determi­nant of one's worth teaches students to be silent and to fol­low the teacher's lead, rather than inviting boldness and risk­taking, which are necessary to develop the skills and confi­dence to engage the world in a critical manner. 
A model of education where the teacher is one of many 
Westernism dominates other cultures 
Dear Editor: 
John Barry's letter (The Observer, Nov. 20} is a perfect example of why universities need non-traditional Western civilization-based curriculum. Perhaps if Mr. Barry would take a "trendy" class in gender, black, or Asian studies, he would realize that Western culture has not been "penetrated by the culture of the East." Instead, he would find that Western culture has a history of imperialism which has worked very hard to subjugate any type of counter­culture which does not fit the needs of its white, male society. 
As a first generation Asian woman, I am deeply offended that Mr. Barry offers Western culture as "all-encompassing." Mr. Barry's claim attempts to obliterate thousands of years of my ethnic heritage, my family's cultural history, and my position as a woman in a patriarchal society. Thankfully, he fails. 
As for his claim that it is possible to graduate "without taking a single Western history or Western civilization class," I think that if he glanced at the classes offered by Notre Dame's history department, he would have a difficult case to prove. Western Civilization I, Western Civilization II, Development of Modern America, and American 
Military History are 100 Level
r 
courses. The sole 200 level
r 
class is Critical Issues in
r 
American History. Clearly, these classes are firmly based in a Western cultural tradition and Mr. Barry can rest easily knowing that the youth at Notre Dame are not being indoctrinated with "fad­prompted concentrations." In my opinion, this University has yet to acknowledge true diversity because it does not have an Asian studies program; nor does it offer Black Studies, Gender Studies, or Peace Studies as full majors. 
Furthermore, his use of the Dartmouth Review as an example of censorship reeks with misinformation. Recently, the editor of the Dartmouth Review resigned from the paper because the issue which was distributed on a Jewish holiday contained a quote from Adolf Hitler's Mien Kampf. The college administration, presumably holding "the official views of the college," played no part in any of the decisions made by the editor of the Review. How Mr. Barry can interpret these events as a suppression of the right to free speech is beyond me. 
I can only hope that his statements were based in ignorance and not misguided conviction. If Mr. Barry truly believes in letting "time-proven ideals" endure "since they have stood the test of time," then what stands in the way of revoking the education. 
employment, housing, and even the voting rights of women and minorities besides the "fads and trends" of some liberal educators and politicians? These advancements were not "mindless" unless, of course, one believes that slavery of African-Americans to the fields of white plantation owners. and that bondage of women to the kitchen of their husbands was good, accepted, and "time­proven." On a more banal level, Notre Dame existed as a fine all-male university for well over 100 years. I wonder if Mr. Barry would want to claim that admitting women to the University was "fad-prompted"?

Dear Editor: 

The junior class has allowed a simplistic form of Nancy Neo­Reaganomics to strike again with its sugar-coated "Just Say No!" approach to chemicals of all sorts.

Finally, a brief comment on the so-called "fads" which Barry sees as being so detri­mental to education. I wonder why he holds so much antipathy for peace studies. If nothing else-and I believe it has a lot more to offer-it is an antidote to the "war studies" which we currently get all through primary and secondary school, as well as college. If you doubt that this is what we have, just think back to your history classes. Most of the events we learn about are wars: indeed, history itself seems to be de­fined by wars. 
The particulars of education, as well as the overall cues we get throughout our educational experiences, tell us that competition and domination are the ways to "succeed" in life. Peace studies triP" to think about ways to build a society-a world-through modes other than violence, war and domination. If this is a "fad," I hope it is a long lasting one. 
Peace studies is part of a trend-which I differentiate from the merely trendy-away from traditional concepts of organizing knowledge. This trend recognizes that the vari­ous disciplines, which are at the heart of traditional education, are merely artificial constructs, and many times not very good ones at that. 
The trend also attempts to incorporate various ways of looking at the world into particular questions. It recognizes, for example, that a sociologist or an anthropologist might have something in­teresting to contribute to a someone studying politics. 
Even more, this trend toward multidisciplinary study, which, I assume, Barry would regard with horror, directly implicates the notion of disciplines in perpetuating outmoded ways of thinking, and seeks to blur and possibly disintegrate, disci­plinary boundaries.

Professor rejects 'pacifist' label 
Dear Editor: 
In the name of honesty, I must respond to The Observer's coverage of the debate on ROTC at Notre Dame (The Observer, Nov. 16), which characterizes me as a pacifist. What I actually 
was that, while I was raised a pacifist and continued to regard myself as such in personal relations, I had long ago concluded that the use of force was sometimes a regrettable necessity in relations among states. 
True pacifists would not 
regard this as a "pacifist" position, nor would they be likely to accept my corollary support for the presence of ROTC on campus. Therefore, though I regard the label as an eminently honorable one, I cannot in good conscience accept it as an accurate 
description  of  my  present  
thinking.

Letters cure column writing blues 
It was another one of those weeks that had turned into an­otber one of those late nights of writer's block twelve hours before my column was due. 
In desperation, I asked a guy down the hall for some funny ideas. 
"Oh, you write that Freshman column?" 
Yep, that's me. Do you have any suggestions? I'm dying here. 
"Hey, I'm not the freshman. I've already been around the block once." 
Can I quote you on that? "Sure. 1\m I really going to be in the papPr?" 
By MEREDITH McCULLOUGH Accent Writer 
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead. But who are they? Come on, you remember those two guys in Hamlet -Hamlet's friends. They didn't really see much action, but they were on the stage, at least for a little while anyway. Oh. Right! THOSE guys. How could anyone forget? 
Tom Stoppard didn't forget. In fact, he took these two minor characters, developed them, and created a new version of Shakespeare's Hamlet based on them. 
His production, 'Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,' takes a fresh look at Hamlet, telling the story from an en­tirely different pe rspecli ve. Those who remember Hamlet as a heavy, tragic tale. may be morn than pleasantly surprised to find that Stoppard's version is a light comedy. 
The Notre Dame theater de­partment did not forget either. They will be presenting this show on Friday, Nov. 30 and Saturday, Dec. 1 at 8:10 p.m. 
'Rosencrantz and Guilden­stern Are Dead' is a behind-the­scenes look at the Hamlet tragedy. Every exit in Hamlet is an entrance in Stoppard's play. The audience sees the story from the eyes of Hosencrantz and Guildenstern, two lost souls who do not really know what is happening in the actual scheme of things. 
This aspect has caused crit­ics to praise the play's existen­tial strains although Stoppard 

Yeah. 
"Wow! I'm gonna make the paper! I'm gonna make the pa­per!" 
He waved his finger in the air. Mike was #1. 
Any more suggestions? 
"Not really." 
Well, what did you want to know about when you were a Freshman? 
"Umm, how can I meet girls?" 
"Hey," his roommate said,'Tm still wondering that." 
''I've got it," suggested an­other friend. "Why don't you answer your mail? Nobody be­lieves you really get any and this is a great chance to prove 
insists that his work is more humorous than philosophical. He has expressed that his play could be taken to have all sorts of deep meanings, but he just meant for it to be funny. 
The show will be presented by Notre Dame students at the Lab Theater. But where is that? Come on, you remember that small room up the cast-iron back stairs of Washington Hall ­the place where all student theater is presented. Oh. Right! THAT theater. How could any­one forget? 
Unfortunately. it seems that far too many students have ei­ther forgotten the existence of the Lab Theater or have yet to discover it. Whichever the case, Washington Hall's smaller up­stairs theater is one of Notre Dame's best kept secrets. 
The theater may be small, but according to Gerry Smith, the director of 'Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead,' it is the perfect place for experimental productions. 
Unlike the larger downstairs auditorium-type stage, the Lab Theater is not subject to the limitations of conventional the­ater. Seating arrangements can be altered depending on each show's individual needs, the re­cently acquired black curtains can be used to alter the shape and dimensions of the theater, and the director can have more freedom in choosing the boundaries of the stage. "That's the shame of it," commented Smith. "It is such a versatile room, but it doesn't get much attention." 
'Rosencrantz and Guilden­stern Are Dead 'seems to fit right in with the whole

them wrong." 

Not a bad idea. The truth is, Mike ("Duke on Stuff") Snyder gets more mail than I do. But I'm coping. And since large quantities of turkey stifle cre­ativity, I'm more than willing to rely on my mailbox for column material. 
So I reached way back into the mail slot, where some let­ters sit for weeks before falling down, and 'started going 
atmosphere of the room. Smith explained that the play itself pokes fun at theater. Since the Lab Theater is not a traditional stage, it serves to "knock down the conventions of theater." 
For this production, Smith chose to arrange the theater in an arena setting. In such a set­up the audience is positioned around a center spot, eliminat­ing a fourth wall and bringing the audience closer to the ac­tors and actresses. 
"The audience is an integral part of the drama," said Smith. Since the two main characters of the play are actually specta­tors of Hamlet, they are almost part of the audience them­selves. Emphasizing this con­cept, the cast is not confined to the boundaries of a stage, but act "in, out, and through the audience." 
Smith and his cast have been working on this production for the past four and a half weeks. The show came together as a result of auditions open to both campuses. Smith feels that this diverse group of fourteen actors and actresses have come together well and show real talent. 
Hosencrantz and Guildenstern may be dead, but the Lab Theater is proof that the stu­dent theater department at Notre Dame is alive and well. 
The show will begin at 8:10 
p.m. on Friday and Saturday, but the doors will open at 7:40. There is limited seating; only the first eighty or ninety people will be admitted. The performance is free of charge. 
through my mail. 
Some of it is unprintable, like the one from "Cheshire", who complained the ASPCA was hassling him for chasing squirrels around campus. He says the wet ones are hard to catch. Anyway, I made an effort to filter out material appropriate for the sensitive Notre Dame/Saint Mary's community. 
Here's what I found: 
Steve Krauss writes: ''I'm re­ally bummed because )'(Jew Kids on the Block are coming. Say it ain't so, Chuck!" 
Sorry, man. It's a fact and there's nothing I can do. A lot of my friends have suggested it would be the perfect weekend for a road trip. Otherwise, get ready for the onslaught of pre­pubescent girls. 
An anonymous letter said I would benefit from all kinds of good luck if I made five copies of it and sent them to my friends. It's already been around the world 20 times and people have won millions or had pets die depending on whether or not they mailed copies of the letter. My dorm's formal is on December 8th and I still don't have a date, so I'm going to run off a few dozen copies this weekend. Not that I believe in that stuff. No way, not me. It's just to be safe. 
Even my little brother wrote me a letter. "Dear Chuck, I hope your enjoying yourself at school because I am. A Bart Simpson t-shirt would be a great hit at Chippewa plus a mini Notre Dame football too." 
A group of girls from Pasquerilla section 2A wrote, too (if you haven't figured it out yet, this is why I write a column): "Dear Chuck, are you really a freshman?" The pinna­cle. 
Of course, not every letter writer had such great insight. Many people wrote to ask for advice. ("Will a bad dogbook picture kill my social life?" etc.) Why they think a Freshman guy with a 2.0 would be any help is beyond me. Maybe I write like Dear Abby. 
Cathy and Lisa, two women in Knott, want me to convince their parents to buy them a car. They subscribe to the Observer, so I guess I've got some influ­ence. They also asked me why their CD player always quits on "certain songs like #8 on Talking Heads, even though the play button is still lit?" It's a mystery to me. I referred them to Dr. Head, as I often must do when the wisdom my readers are seeking is of a highly tech­nical nature. 
Finally, Gina Pavioni wrote me a letter. Or so her friends say. I can't answer it in print because she never mailed it. 
Special thanks to everyone who did. 
Have any ideas on how Chuck can generate mail? Write to: Chuck, The Observer, c/o Accent, Jrd Floor ofLaFortune

Tagliabue levies fines on Patriots for Olson incident 
NEW YORK (AP) -The alleged sexual harassment of reporter Lisa Olson will cost three players a total of $22,500 and the New England Patriots $50,000. 
Zeke Mowatt was fined $12,500 on Tuesday, while Michael Timpson and Robert Perryman were each fined $5,000 for their roles in a locker room incident involving Olson, of the Boston Herald. The Patriots were fined $25,000 because they "never vigorously sought the facts about what had happened," NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue wrote in a letter to Patriots owner Victor Kiam. 
In addition to the team fine, the Patriots were ordered to pay $25,000 for counseling on how to deal with the media. 
Tagliabue levied the fines after receiving a 60-page report on the incident by special counsel Phillip Heymann of the Harvard Law School. Tagliabue concluded that "a serious inci­dent occurred on Sept. 17 while Ms. Lisa Olson of the Boston Herald was interviewing cornerback Maurice Hurst in the Patriots' locker room. The incident involved misconduct of certain Patriots' players that was degrading to Ms. Olson. "Professor Heymann's report is thorough and balanced," Tagliabue said. "It treats the entire episode on a factual ba­sis, not with speculation, rumor or rhetoric." 
The report, in which 91 people were interviewed, some more than once, also said, "Lisa Olson on three occasions presented the investigators with a clear and consistent account of sexual harassment.... The Patriots pointed out to us that various accounts written by Olson or attributed to her by other reporters were exagger­ated and not entirely consistent. "On the other hand, it was obvious to us that players were extremely reluctant to speak frankly about their own activi­ties and those of some of their teammates. Their accounts of the incident of Sept. 17 were also often inconsistent with the accounts provided by others present in the locker room that day. 

"Still, direct conflicts remain between the account of Lisa Olson and the accounts of the Patriots ... some of these con­flicts have proved unresolv­able." 
Olson, in a prepared state­ment, thanked Tagliabue and Heyman for the thorough and revealing report. 
"My satisfaction with the in­vestigation and subsequent sanctions is surpassed only by my wish the disgraceful inci­dent had never occurred in the first place," Olson said. "It was not my choice to have this mat­ter decided in a public forum, and it is unfortunate that Patriot management forced this to happen by not dealing with the guilty persons swiftly and decisively." 
Olson has been reassigned to the Boston Celtics' beat. Mowatt and Timpson are still with the Patriots, but Perryman was released on Nov. 6 and now plays for the Dallas Cowboys. 
Tagliabue called the players' actions and statements "completely uncalled for and improper. Mowatt's conduct in­volved both verbal and demon­strative actions. Timpson and Perryman encouraged the mis­conduct." 
Heymann's report also said it found Mowatt's account of the incident "is not credible." 
"We believe Olson's account that two or three players whom we cannot identify paused and 'modeled' themselves briefly by her in some fashion," the report said. "No one tried to bring the humiliating activity around Lisa Olson to a stop." 
The hefty fine to the Patriots stemmed from their slow reac­tion to the incident and for "too little regard for the proper enforcement of league policies." Tagliabue also concluded, based on Heymann's report, that the team's management failed to comply with NFL policy on equal media access "in that the club did not adequately supervise its players, did not adequately investigate and re­solve a serious incident of mis­conduct in the club's locker room and appeared to condone the misconduct of the Patriots' players."

Belles 
. continued from page 16 
And surely, you can have both. The problem is that a stereotypical belle would have a surplus of the former but little of the latter. "I know where (the name) came from-the South," said junior Kelly Cook, a sweeper on the Belles soccer team. "To me it's a tradition. A tradition doesn't bother me. I like following tradition. Notre Dame has its own traditions, and would you want to break them?" "The Belles" is rooted in tra­dition-a 13-year-old one. Can one ever reassess that position? Karen Jurgenson, a junior English major, thinks so. "A Southern Belle is a polished lady," she said. "That kind of genteel woman is not how I picture a Saint Mary's woman. We are more' independent, ag­gressive, spirited and worldly, and it doesn't seem like a true 

ideals and morals." In other words, Saint Mary's is not a finishing school. 
Michelle Sibilsky, co-captain of the women's volleyball team, said, "I don't think it would be appropriate if we were called 'The Lions' or something. It doesn't fit what the school's trying to portray. It's just hard to identify with a Belle for a mascot. You can't have some­one cheering for you, dressed as a belle." Certain men at Notre Dame, on the other hand, might enjoy it. "I like the name," said senior tennis ace Sarah Mayer, "It's unique. No other team, obvi­ously, have the 'Belles' as a nickname." Actually, all the female sports teams at Bellarmine College in Louisville, Ky., use "Belles." Who knows how many other schools use it? "Half the people (at Saint Mary's) really like it, and the other half want to change it right away," said Mayer. 
-=-· 

of changing the name, the Belles usually balk. "If we had to choose, (our nickname) wouldn't be 'Belles,'" said senior softball co­captain Maggie Killian. "I can't say we go by that name. We don't really say, 'Go Belles.'" What do you say? "We say, 'Go Blue,"' said Kil­lian. Well, why not the Saint Mary's Blue, then? It's less stereotypical. "It's hard to be a threat when you're called a belle," said Si­bilsky. "People laugh if we're in a huddle and yell, 'Go Belles.' We say, 'Go Belles,' and then, 'Ding Dong.' But we don't treat it with disrespect. We tend to laugh at it sometimes, but other than that, I don't know." Jurgenson, at least, does know this: 
"I know that the name is a tradition, and in some ways that's important. But the school needs to change as we change."

Flyers chase Islanders with 5-1 win 
UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP)-Three power-play goals in a 3:17 span of the second period, two of them by Pelle Eklund and all on the same penalty, carried the Philadelphia Flyers to a 5-1 victory over the New York Islanders on Tuesday night. Flyers goaltender Pete Peeters stopped 27 shots and had a shutout going until Dave Chyzowski scored for the Islanders at 15:07 of the third period. 
The victory gave the Flyers 33 points, only four points away from the idle first-place New York Rangers in the Patrick Division. 
Craig Berube and Keith Acton added third-period goals for the Flyers, Berube with only 12 seconds gone and Acton at 4:55. 
Islanders starting goalie Glenn Healy was then pulled for Jeff Hackett after stopping 22 of 27 shots. 
The Islanders, who had al­lowed only three goals in their last 54 times shorthanded, were stung when Ken Baumgartner was assessed a 5­minute major for fighting against Rick Tocchet, who cov­ered up and escaped a penalty from referee Andy vanHelle­mond. 
The Flyers then showed why they are ranked first in the league in power-play percent­age on the road. Mike Ricci broke the scoreless tie with his sixth goal of the season, the first on the major penalty. On a Gord Murphy pass from the point, Tocchet, standing to Healy's left, de­fleeted the puck in mid-air, then batted a pass into the crease for Ricci to tap in. 
Oilers 7, Penguins 3 
PITTSBURGH -Mark Messier had four assists, and Martin Gelinas and Craig Simpson scored 1:43 apart as the Edmonton Oilers got five consecutive goals in a 7-3 vic­tory Tuesday night over the Pittsburgh Penguins. 
Gelinas scored his sixth goal at 4:03 of the second period, taking Ken Linesman's pass and beating Frank Pietrangelo from 10 feet to tie the game at 3-3. Simpson scored his 11th after taking a behind-the-back pass from Messier. 

Glenn Anderson gave the Oilers a 5-3 lead at 16:05. Joe Murphy scored at 6:23 of the third period and Anderson got his second goal of the game at 17:05. 
Red Wings 4, Kings 3 DETROIT -Bob Probert scored with 2:05 remaining to lift the Detroit Red Wings to a 4-3 victory over the Los Angeles Kings. 
Jimmy Carson skated behind the Kings' net and flipped a perfect pass to Probert, who tapped it past goalie Daniel Berthiaume for his seventh goal of the season. 
It was the Red Wings' third consecutive victory, their longest winning streak. Detroit is 10-3-0 at Joe Louis Arena, 1­7-3 on the road.

Golf club wants Open, admits black member 
BIRMINGHAM, Mich. (AP) ­A suburban Detroit country club accepted its first black member, a move that would allow the club to host the U.S. Open in 1996. 
The applicant, whom Oakland Hills County Club officials have refused to identify, has qualified for membership, but no space is available, said Jim Beachum, club secretary. As a social member, the man can participate in club social activities and entertain guests, but he must wait to tee off on the club's North Course until he is 15th on the regular membership waiting list. 
Beachum said Oakland Hills has 57 5 stock members and 60 social members, with a yearly turnover of about 25 memberships. The man has paid between $6,000 and $8,000, which will be applied to the full membership fee of $36,000. 
Beachum said Monday it would be at least three years before the man could be a full member, which would allow him to play on the South Course, the site of five U.S. Opens and two PGA champi­onships. 
The South Course had been named as the course for the 1996 U.S. Open. Bob Woods, chairman of the U.S. Senior Open Championship in 1991, said he asked USGA executive director David Fay last week when the contract for the tournament would be sent. 
"David said that at a USGA executive committee meeting the committee wanted to be sure of membership policies before it negotiated a contract 

Miami defense on streak since loss to Notre Dame 
CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) ­The defending national cham­pions have rediscovered de­fense. 
After a shaky opening month of the season, third-ranked Miami has turned as stingy as past Hurricanes teams. 
"We're coming together now, and nobody can touch us," de­fensive end Rusty Medearis said Tuesday. "We're just playing out of our heads right now."

Going into Saturday's regular­season finale at explosive San Diego State, the Hurricanes (8­
2) have allowed an average of 
9.7 points and 227 yards in the past six games. In the first four games, Miami allowed 23.8 points and 368.5 yards. 
"We were an inexperienced defensive team" at the start of the year, coach Dennis Erickson said. "I said that going into the 
point guard, and 6-11 center Keith Tower will round out the starting lineup. Kevin Ellery will also get a lot of minutes coming off the bench . 
The Hoosiers come into the game with a 2-1 record after a 77-74 loss to Syracuse in the finals of the Maui Classic Mon­day. Last year Indiana made life miserable for Notre Dame in Bloomington, as they forced 21 season, but nobody would believe me." 

The Hurricanes returned only five starters from last year's defense, which allowed the fewest points and yards in the nation. Miami lost four defen­sive linemen in the first three rounds of the NFL draft. In this season's opener, then­No. 1 Miami gave up 474 yards in a 28-21 loss at Brigham Young. 
Irish turnovers en route to an 81-72 triumph which wasn't as close as the score indicated. But this year the Irish have game experience-they played four games in the NIT-and the home court advantage in their favor. 
"As we review the preseason NIT, I think we accomplished a lot of good things and obviously we see where we need to improve," Phelps said.

"We weren't experienced enough to cope with what we had to cope with in that first 
game," Erickson said. 
Through four games, the Hurricanes had given up nearly as many points as all of last season. 
"With our inexperience, we didn't know how to handle the big games," defensive tackle Russell Maryland said. "Now the guys aren't so much in awe when we play good teams." 
In the four games since a 29­20 loss at Notre Dame, the Hurricanes have allowed only four touchdowns. They surren­dered just 204 yards in a 33-7 victory Saturday over Syracuse. 
Last year's Hurricanes had perhaps the best front four in the history of college football. For that reason alone, this year's defense still can't match the 1989 unit.

Irish swimmers primed for National Catholics 
By BECKY WOOD 
Sports Writer 

Fifteen teams will culminate their fall swimming seasons at Notre Dame this weekend when the Irish host the Fourth An­nual National Catholic Swim­ming and Diving Championship Meet beginning on Thursday. The three day competition will run through Saturday with tri­als beginning at 10 a.m. daily followed by finals at 6:30 p.m. each day. 
Both the Notre Dame men's and women's teams will host the teams and run separate meets. The National Catholics meet has grown since its incep­tion in 1987, especially with the addition of swimming powers Villanova and LaSalle in 1988'. 
Times have become signifi­cantly faster each year due to an increase in the number of teams competing. Because more coaches and swimmers look at the National Catholics as the focal point of the fall season, their preparation is better for the meet each year.
