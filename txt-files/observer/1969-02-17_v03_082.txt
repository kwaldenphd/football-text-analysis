Petty thieves hit NDoverweekend 
by Bill Holley 
In the past three days Notre Dame has been hit by a rash of petty thefts. The first instance occurred Friday night at the Cellar in the basement of the Halfway House. At this time a total of $95 was taken from the purses of two girls visiting the campus for the weekend. The purses were left in the coatroom, which was unguarded. 
Freshman Class President Ray Comnell explained that the reason coats were not checked was that the coatroom serves not only the Cellar but the Halfway !louse and the Holy Cross lounge. In his words, "Why should we have put someone in the coatroom to check coats when we were only using the Cellar." 
A number of coats were also reported stolen from the coat racks at the Mardi Gras Carnival at Stepan Center. Mardi Gras Chairman Jim Golomb admitted that he knew of six reported thefts. Campus Security only had one incident reported while figures were not available from the St. Joseph County Sheriff's Department as to the number of official reports. Ernie Gargaro, a member of the Mardi Gras Committee reported that the reason coats were not checked at the Carnivalswas that funds were not available to pay people to watch coats. lie said: "It would run personnel costs out of sight.'' Two additional Sheriff's 
deputies were put on duty 
Sunday to help with security but 
as one deputy put it "We can 
watch the coat racks but we 
can't tell if they are taking their 
own coats or stealing them." 
About 4:00 p.m. Sunday, Henry Cardinnlc uf 417 Lyons reported to tit.: Security office that his wallet and class ring were stolen from his room while he was out. His roommate David Heise was at the room at the time. Heise said that two negroes about 18 or 20 years old came to his room asking for a friend. Heise then went to look their friend's number up in the phone book. When he turned around the two men had left. He later discovered that Cardinale's wallet and class ring were missing.

Joe McFarlin, president of who encouraged American negroes to emigrate to Western Africa. 

Professor Lynch led-off the series by providing a survey of the effects of historical developments and a number of black leaders on the American negro's attempt to return to Africa after the Civil War. A question session following the lecture prompted a comparison of such recent Black Nationalists as Malcom X, who visited Africa several times and earlier Afro-Americans who may have had an entirely different vision of the African state in relationship with America. 
Dr. Rita Cassidy, professor of Afro-American History at St. Mary's and coordinator of the series, announced that in the coming weeks topics in the series will study such aspects of black culture as the current American "black is beautiful" appreciation of all aspects of negro humanity, nineteenth century blacK thinker and the proponents of a revival of fascination in traditional negro foods, clothing, music and dance. American and African 
styles in literature, art and architecture will be also compared. 
African playwright Wolc Soyinka's The Trials of Brother Jero will be performed by a local· all-black cast, and the Moreau Art Gallery is exhibiting a collection of implements, textiles and clothing articles entitled African Structural Arts throughout the month of February. 
The second lecture will be Wednesday (please note that the 
S.B. Tribune was wrong), when John Povey, associate director of the African Studies Center at UCLA and editor of Arts d'Afrique will speak at 7:30

EMPIRE BUILDERS 
are not exactly what we need. City builders are all we're looking for right at the moment. City builders, in our language, are engineers. And a growing city like Milwaukee needs plenty of those. If you are one, we need you to design streets, sewers and structures, to supervise construction, to try your hand in one (or maybe all --if you stay around a while) of the many departments of local government concerned with building a GREAT city.

by Ted Price 

Maybe you were lucky enough to hear before you went to the Morris Civic--many were not and were left standing outside while the Student Union did its thing and managed to present the Four Tops in concert under conditions known affectionately as "Clutch." The whole snafu opened with an emergency telephone call to Lo11 Lanwermeyer, Student Union Social Commissioner. 
"I was sound asleep about I0:30 Saturday when the phone ran~ and the Notre Dame

operator called and said that I had a message to call Tharon Hill in Chicago," said Lanwermeyer. Hill is the road manager for the Four Tors, and when he called five hours before a date, Lan wermeyer figured something was wrong. 
-OESER VER ___ JNSJGH'l' 
Lanwermeyer called the Union's agents, College Entertainment Agency, and spoke to Stan Rubin, who had originally negotiated the contract. Rubin informed him that the Tops had been in Los Angeles the previous night taping the Hollywood Palace show and that they had left their sheet music at the studio. 
Lanwermeyer arranged for the music to be flown to Chicago with an emergency priority and then phoned the group there and told them that it was on the way. He also added that the contract was "solid", that is it could not be broken. 
He dispatched Ed Zawacki, the Student Union's concert chairman to Chicago via Cessna 337, chartered from Stockert Flying Service of South Bend. 
Zawacki arrived in Chicago and located the Four Tops in a room at the Holiday Inn ncar O'Hare. He said that the group refused to leave Chicago until they actually had the music in their hands. 
"I told them that the music was due in about three and that there was no reservation available on any flight to South Bend after that." Two more aircraft were chartered, this time from Executive Charter at O'Hare. 
Zawacki returned to the airport and saw the operations manager of the airfreight service there. He briefed him on the situation and otherwise persuaded him that it was an emergency. As soon as the plane was at the gate, Zawacki and the manager were in its belly searching for the music. 
"We finally found it, two boxes weighing almost fifty pounds apiece," he said. "These I grabbed and ran to the Stockert plane." 

Meanwhile, the Four Tops had boarded their planes but found that there was no room for IIi!!. So Hill had to go with Zawacki. But somehow, Hill's attache case didn't make it. 
"We taxied back from the runway to the hangar and found the case. From there, back to the lineup waiting for takeoff, and we were finally airborne on our way to South Bend." 
When the squadron landed at St. Joe International, they were met by several police cars and a nearly apoplectic Lou Lanwermeyer. The Four Tops were hustled into the police cars, along with all their music, instruments, road manager and his briefcase. 
The concert went on at 4:35, late enough to make the audience's temper rather ugly, But according to several people who were there, the concert was "real good". 
According to Wade, the entire operation cost in the neighborhood of $500, but there has been no figure released on the damage to health of several Union officials. He said that the Tops would cover all extra expenses.

First of all, there was "booing" last Tues. night, and it was vehement. But it was directed at Coach Dec, not the players. llell, I did not realize there were five Black players on the court until just reading the OBSERVER. It so happens that I was wrapped-up in the game-not a racial issue! 
Second, consider the night of January 15, when Spencer Haywood was here. lie received an enormous ovation, one of appreciation for his efforts while representing our country in Mexico. Also reflect upon the standing ovation given Austin Carr. Both of these enthusiastic acclamations were given because the two players were great in their sport. I do not think race had anything to do with these at all. But the other nite, everything went wrong, so right away, the racial issue arises. Well, not so, my brothers!

'Boo-Birds'hibernate,cagers explode 
By PETE BRUDERLE 
Observer Sports Writer 

Notre Dame's flickering chances for an at-large NCAA tournament bid received a much needed shot in the arm Saturday, as Johnny Dee's forces thumped the Aggies of Utah State 108-82. 
With nary a boo to be heard the entire afternoon, the Irish mounted their finest offensive effort of the season as four starters topped twenty points and a healthy Jackie Meehan cleverly quarterbacked the attack. As Dee put it on national television after the game, "We're where we wanted to be at the start of the season." 
Bob Whitmore was high scorer with 26, 22 in the second half, while Austin Carr added 25 and Arnzen and Murphy totaled 21 each. All five starters earned a

Wisconsin skaters too much 
The Irish icers ventured north for the weekend and suffered two more defeats at the hands of the powerful Wisconsin Badgers, 5-l and 10-2. Notre Dame's record now reads 13-7-3, four of the set-backs resulting from Wisconsin. On Jan. 30-31, the Badgers humiliated Notre Dame 10-2 and 12-0. 
Friday night in Milwaukee, the Irish went out and astounded 3,724 fans by out-playing their foes for twenty minutes. John Roselli fed Jim Cordes for a score at 17:31 and the defense allowed the Badgers a mere IS shots on goal. Notre Dame harried Wisconsin goalie Bob Droman with 12 shots and left the ice leading 1-0. 
Things reverted to normal at 
8: 14 of the second period when Bert DeHate, Dave Smith, and Jim Boyd vaulted Wisconsin into the lead by scoring three goals within the amazing time span of 21 seconds. Smith's goal came only two seconds after DeHate's. During the second 20 minutes, Irish netminder Dick Tomasoni made 25 saves and never really

had a chance on any of the five Badger goals. The other two came in the third period on deflected shots. Tomasoni was brilliant in the nets, ultimately turning away 59-64 shots, an excellent percentage of.922. 
Friday's game was marked by 14 penalties and set the stage for Saturday's rough--and-tumble match in Madison. The Irish were out-scored but never out-hit, as 16 penalties were whistled. The highlight came at IS: 53 of the second period when NO's Phil Wittliff and Mike Collins took on Dick Klipsic and Dave Smith. All four players received 5-minute fighting penalties and were exiled from the game. 
Before he left, Wittliff scored one of the two Irish goals, at 
17:04 of the first period. Joe Bonk hit the cords earlier at 3:59, but by that time, ND was already down 2-0. Wisconsin left the ice after twenty minutes with a 4-2 lead. 
Dick Tomasoni had only 43 shots on goal compared to Friday's 64, but his percentage 
was much lower, .769. The Irish offense was even less effective, 

Mudron cops 
championship 
Pat Mudron was the only member of the Notre Dame wrestling squad to win a divisional championship in the Wheaton Invitational this past weekend. In doing so Mudron won 3 matches, one over Dave Krepic of Elmhurst another over Walt Kummerow of North Park College and the first place match over Dave Harper of the host team. Mudron was competing, of course, in the heavyweight class. 
The only other ND grappler 
to reach the finals was 
123-pound Keith Giron, who 
was defeated by Bill Whitehead 
of Dubuque, 3-1. Giron had 
advanced with a 4-2 triumph 
over Dave Anderson of 
Augustana in the semifinals. 
putting only 14 shots on goal. That figure almost matched the number of shots taken at Wisconsin during the first period on Friday's contest. 
Notre Dame actually played well over the weekend. The Badgers are a class ahead of the Irish in skating speed, passing, and defense. And Notre Dame definitely improved over their previous losses to the Badgers. The Irish get a chance to rebound on Tuesday night against Lake Forest College. The next home game is scheduled for Feb. 28 against Gustavus Adolphus. 

Irish tap 
new coach 
John Counsell, 1964 Notre Dame baseball captain who signed a five-figure contract with the Minnesota Twins upon his graduation, has been named assistant baseball coach at the University by Athletic Director Edward W. Krause. 
The 26-year-old Counsell spent four seasons in the Twins' Class A farm system, before asking for his release in 1967. 
An outfielder who led the Midwest League in assists with 26 in 1966, Counsell had his best year at the plate that season with a .254 average and 51 runs batted in at Wisconsin Rapids. The previous fall h~ hit .297 in the Florida Instructional League. 
In his last year of professional baseball, Counsell hit .245 for pennant winning Orlando in the Florida State League. 
A defensive gem as a three-year starter at Notre Dame, the native of Oconomowoc, Wisconsin had his best season as a junior in 1963. That year he hit .350 in addition to collecting five hits in the last Irish appearnace in a NCAA baseball tournament. 
Counsell succeeds Tom Kelly as Jake Kline's assistant. Kelly is now assistant director of intramural and club sports at the Universi ty. 
ND Relay unit wins at Garden 
Notre Dame's two-mile relay team won that event at the Knights of Columbus Track Meet on last Friday night. Mike McCann, Joe Quigley, Mark Walsh, and Rick Wohlhuter rounded the Madison Square Garden track in 7:35.6. Bill Hurd finished second to Kentucky sophomore Jim Greene in the 60-yard dash. Greene won the event in 0:06.2 after taking his semi-final heat in a sizzling 0:06.6 
lived up to his billing as the 
nation's number six leading scorer. Though somewhat timid on defense and rebounding, Roberts scored from in and out on a variety of shots for his 35 points. 
The only question left now is which tournaments the Irish will hear from. Convincing wins this week, tonight against Butler and especially in New York on Thursday against N.Y.U., could earn some friendly glances form NCAA officials when they convene to name at-large selections next week. 
In any case the Irish are sure to hear from the N.I.T. and a trip to Fun City would assure at least a two game set. A first round loss at Carbondale in the NCAA would end it all, but a first round win might well give the Irish a second shot at Kentucky. And if Saturday was any indication of what is to come, a second matchup might not prove as frustrating as what took place in Louisville over the Christmas holidays.

Coach Dennis Stark's swimmers found it tough going again this weekend as a rugged Western Michigan squad beached the Irish 67-46 Friday night at Rockne Pool. "We knew they were tough, but they were tougher than we thought:' Stark remarked. 
The Broncos took 9 of I 3 events in boosting their record to 7-4. Notre Dame is now 5-2. 
Reid Lichenfels took his specialty in the one meter diving, while Freshman John Fahey lowered his varsity 200 yard butterfly mark again, this time .6 seconds to 2:08.2. 
John May added a win in the 100 yard freestyle in the quick time of 49.7. Notre Dame's other first came in the 400 yard freestyle-relay which saw Vince Spohn, Iom Hock, Bill Ladouceur, and Captain John May combine for a new meet record of 3:22.8. 
Tomorrow night the Irish travel to Mount Pleasant to meet Central Michigan. They return to action at home on Saturday against Northwestern.
