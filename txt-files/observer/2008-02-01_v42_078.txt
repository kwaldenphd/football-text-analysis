Approximately 1,800 stu­dents hoping to secure a job or internship attended the Winter Career and Internship Fair Wednesday night at the Joyce Center. 
Unlike its fall counterpart, which was geared toward pre-professional students, the Winter Career Fair largely focused on compa­nies that would be attrac­tive to Arts and Letters majors. "Arts and Letters is what this fair was about," said Anita Rees, the Career

Brazilian Carnaval celebrated 
Kellogg Institute sponsors SDH event 
By LINDSAY SENA 
News Writer 
South Bend will be getting a little taste of Brazil tonight as the Kellogg Institute for International Studies hosts its 10th annual celebration of Brazilian Carnaval in South Dining Hall. 
A celebration similar to Mardi Gras, Carnaval takes place each year at the begin­ning of Lent and is celebrated in many European and Latin American countries. 
Brazilian Club officer Valerie Kornfield explained the tradi­tion behind Brazil's Carnaval. 
"It is a unique opportunity for people from every social class to party and celebrate together on the streets," Kornfield said. "There are huge, elaborate parades and presentations in Rio de Janeiro and Salvador, as well as some in Sao Paulo. Thousands of tourists flock to Rio de Janeiro and Salvador to participate in the festivities." 
Events Coordinator for the Kellogg Institute Dina Dinovo said Notre Dame's Carnaval celebrations have "grown exponentially each year." The event has been held at a vari­ety of locations -first at Reekers, then Legends, LaFortune Ballroom and the Palais Royale in downtown

Notre Dame is not alone in its work to ease financial bur­dens. 
Last year, Harvard University announced it would significantly change its finan­cial aid policies in order to make college more affordable for the middle class. 
Harvard's decision has sparked a recent trend, with many other elite universities across the country, including Yale, Duke and the University of Pennsylvania, making simi­lar changes to their financial aid programs.

University hosts Winter Career Fair 
Annual event focuses on job and internship options for Arts and Letters majors

With a price tag of more than $44,000 each year, a Notre Dame education is not cheap. But the University, like many top-tier private colleges around the country, is working to ease the financial burden for tuition-paying families. 
Over the past 18 years, spending on financial aid at Notre Dame has risen from $55 million to $72 million, a 13 percent increase. Meanwhile, tuition over the same period has only increased about five to six percent, said Joe Russo, direc­tor of student financial strate­gies. 
"Our goal is to continue to reduce the need to borrow by providing more scholarship money," Russo said. The University's current fundrais­ing campaign aims to collect $1.5 billion in donations by 2011. The campaign's largest component will be used to provide undergraduate schol­arships, Russo said. 
Russo said his office does not publicly express the details of its financial aid poli­cies. 
"We haven't communicated information about our finan­cial aid program publicly but to those who ask -students, parents, alumni -we can reassure them that we are making things happen," Russo said. "We have a lot to be proud of, and I think it's reflected in the growing num­ber of students every year who. want to attend this University." 
The University has three "premier policies" that make its financial aid program unique, Russo said. The first is need-blind admissions. When deciding whether or not to accept a student, the University does not consider one's ability to pay tuition. The second policy is Notre Dame's commitment to meet the full demonstrated financial need of accepted students. Third, the University allows outside

By EMMA DRISCOLL 
News Writer 
Saint Mary's College will bring experts, college students and high-schoolers together Feb. 13­15 for the third-annual Diverse Students' Leadership Conference (DSLC). 
"The mission and intention is to educate and foster intercultural interaction among partici­pants," said Larisa Olin Ortiz, director of multi­cultural affairs. "What the students wanted is to challenge participants and to reconsider how diversity plays such an important role in our world today." 
Organized by the Diversity Board, the DSLC was first held at Saint Mary's in 2006. It was the first conference organized by students for the College's campus.

Saint Mary's administrators have decided to make the Center for InterCultural Leadership (CWIL). which is responsible for some of the College's multicultural programs, a part of the College's Academic Affairs Division. 
CWIL was originally funded by grant money from the Lilly Endowment Inc., a private foundation which "affords spe­cial emphasis to projects that benefit young people and promote leadership education and financial self-sufficiency in the nonprofit, charitable sector," according to the Endowment's Web site.

Worldvvide loser in sports 
Where have you gone, ESPN? 
Sure, the self-proclaimed 
"Worldwide Leader in Sports" is 

thriving, but it's not the same chan­
nel it was even a few years ago. 

I ean remember a kinder, gentler 
era of' sports pro­

gramming when Jay Fitzpatrick

was the "Sports 
Heporters" -a 
calm Sunday morning show with 

some of the best sports journalists 
in the eountry. People like Bob 

Hyan, Mike Lupica and the venera­
ble Dick Schaap would discuss the 
week's issues calmly and rationally. 
They respected each other's opin­

ions and worked to find some kind 
of answer to major issues in the 
sports world. 

And then "Around the llorn" hap­
pened. 
ESPN decided to repackage the 
"Sports Heporters" every day at 

5:30 p.m. So they replaced the best journalists who were intelligent and n~speetful for. quite simply, stupid ones. 
Woody Paige and Jay Mariotti ­two common guests on the show­say and do silly things to garner arbitrarily given points from host Tony Heali for more face time. The more you say things that Heali likes, tlw more chances you get to say things he might like later in the show. 
Nowadays ESPN has found a way to bring this sensationalized style of news to the masses with the morn­ing show ESPN "First Take." 
As the show has evolved over the years, it has two basic parts. The bulk of the show is interviews with journalists and athletes from around the country. The rest? 
Skip Bayless vs. black people. 

It's not always an African­American, but since Bayless is a 57­year old white man, ESPN figured it would be best to pair him with some of its younger, black analysts often like Shaun King, Jalen Rose and Jemele Hill and wait for the controversy (and ratings) to start. 
In thn segment "1st and 10," Bayless answers questions with absurd, superlative-laced state­ments that make him sound like a fool. This is until the person on the other end of the table contradicts whatever Bayless says with his or her own ridiculous, off-the-wall statement. And then the yelling starts. The two "analysts" yell rebuttals at each other without regard to any sense of order until host Jay Crawford makes a snide remark about one of the two views and moves on. 
I do not understand why ESPN feels the need to show this on the air. It has had a history of such great coverage and journalism, but now they have devolved into this. Its sourees are not always real interviews or newspapers. Instead it thrives on rumors and the bastion of journalism -TMZ.com. 
I do not know where the ESPN of old has gone. I just want it to come back.

Wash U. professor lectures on Islam 
By SARAH MAYER 
News Writer 
Dr. Fatemeh Keshavarz, director of Eastern Religious Studies at Washington University in St. Louis, present­ed a lecture entitled "The Role of Women in the Muslim World" Thursday in the Stapleton Lounge at Saint Mary's College. 
"Knowledge about Muslim women is more than just facts, it's about their culture, their history, and their talent," Keshavarz said. Originally from Iran, Keshavarz said women are often alienated in the Islamic world, despite the fact that they are an integral part of it. 
"Women are culturally dis­tant yet so close at the same time," she said. 
Muslim women still face great obstacles, especially since they are considered the proper­ty of their husbands, Keshavarz said. However, they are begin­ning to overcome these obsta­cles and receive education. In Iranian universities, 70 percent of the students are women. But the government is considering establishing a quota system because women are doing such better than men. 
"!The quota system] would just be holding women back and is a ridiculous idea," Keshavarz said. 
The majority of her lecture focused on the fact that many American students know very little about Iran and Muslim culture. Although Keshavarz says even the most intelligent students do not know 60 to 70 percent of the facts or real story behind the history of Iran. 
According to Keshavarz, only 300 Americans a year travel to Iraq, and when applying for a visa, "the United Nations gives you a million reasons not to go." Keshavarz said she was happy to speak at Saint Mary's and "bridge the gap between the Muslim world, especially Iran, and the United States." 
According to Keshavarz, who received all of her facts from the United Nations, every Iranian woman needs her hus­band's consent to travel abroad. 
"If the husband does not approve-than she cannot go, it is absurd and the law needs to change," Keshavarz said. 
Kashavarz is involved in the 1,000,000 Signatures Campaign with many other Muslim women between the ages of 17 and 25. The all­female organization send mem­bers from village to village in Iraq asking for signatures to support gender equality issues. 
The talk was sponsored by the Justice department, CWIL, and the Political Science and English departments.

Carnival returned to campus in 2005, Dinovo said, and has been held in South Dining Hall ever since. 
The family-friendly event brings together a variety of people: students, faculty and staff from Notre Dame and Saint Mary's, as well as from other are colleges, Dinovo said. 
"We have members of the community that return each year dressed in the colors of Brazil," Dinovo said. "It is really a pleasure to have all of these people come together and enjoy dancing, singing and having fun." 
As in previous years, Notre Dame's Carnaval will feature Chicago Samba. The Chicago­based Brazilian musicians have been together for over eighteen years and play "a variety of styles of the most popular artistic expression in Brazil," according to the group's W1~b site. 
Kornlield describes Brazilian music as "full of spirit and fun and movement, beautifully woven together. The lyrics of traditional sambas often speak about central elements of Brazilian history or culture." 
In addition to music, compli­mentary snacks will be served and professional Brazilian dancers in costumes will be performing and teaching dance steps to a variety of tra­ditional and popular Brazilian rhythms. 
Dinovo estimates at least 400 people will attend the celebra­tion, which begins at 8 p.m. Admission is free and the event is open to the public.

Snow paralyzes Chinese rail services 
GUANGZIIOU, China -Hundreds of thou­sands of desperate travelers, some hoisting terrified children or baggage over their heads, pushed their way onto trains Thursday as service resumed after the worst winter storms in decades paralyzed China. 
Piles of suitcases, dirty blankets, duffel bags, clothing and shoes, abandoned in the chaotic stampede, littered the rain-soaked train station in Guangzhou, the starting point for the busy rail line north to Beijing. 
Railway officials said the restored service could carry 400,000 passengers a day, but hundreds of thousands of stranded people, most of them migrant workers, were still waiting to leave the city.

The first act of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's new government will be to ask Parliament on Feb. 13 to pass a motion apol­ogizing for past policies of taking mostly mixed-race children from Aboriginal moth­ers to try to make them grow up like white Australians.

FBI clears Egyptian college students 
TAMPA, fla. -Two Egyptian college stu­dents arrested near a South Carolina Navy weapons station last year were carrying low­grade fireworks, as they claimed, not the dan­gerous explosives as charged by federal prose­cutors, the FBI has determined. 
Ahmed Abdellatif Sherif Mohamed, 26, and Youssef Samir Megahed, 21, have been in jail since sheriffs deputies found what they called bomb-making materials in the trunk of their car during a traffic stop near Charleston, S.C. 
The FBI report was submitted to the court Wednesday by Megahed's public defender as part of a motion seeking bail. U.S. Attorney's Office spokesman Steve Cole declined com­ment on the filing Thursday.

KANDAHAH -A suicide bomber blew himself up Thursday in a mosque in southern Afghanistan, killing a deputy provincial governor and five other people in another blow to President Hamid Karzai's U.S.-backed government. 
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, which came as U.S. officials were warning that the six-year mission to sta­bilize Afghanistan faces a crisis due to Taliban resilience and weakening international resolve. 
Pir Mohammad, deputy governor of Helmand province, was attending noon prayers at the mosque in the provincial capital of Lashkar Gah when the bomber struck, according to police chief Mohammad Hussein Andiwal. 
At least 18 people, including two children, were wounded by the blast, Andiwal said. 
Haji Ikramullah, who was walking to the mosque when the explosion occurred, said he saw bod­ies inside and wounded people shrieking in pain. 

A Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, claimed responsibility for the attack, which he said the "enemies of James Jones and former the drawdown by midyear was carried out by an Afghanistan" against U.N.

Border guards require proof of citizenship 
Associated Press 

DETHOIT -Tougher identification rules went into effect Thursday along the nation's borders, but there appeared to be little added delay as travelers unprepared for the change were in many cases allowed to cross with a warning. 
Rather than seeing a bottleneck over the Ambassador Bridge into Detroit, truck driver Paul Kraus said, "It's actually slow today." The 42­year-old regularly crosses the bridge from Windsor, Ontario, and said he always carries required documents. 
U.S. and Canadian citizens enter­ing the country are no longer allowed to simply declare to immi­gration officers at border crossings that they are citizens. Instead, those 19 and older must show proof of citi­zenship, such as a passport or a "trusted traveler" card issued to fre­quent border crossers. Driver's licenses must be accompanied by proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate. 
Orville McFarlane of San Diego had just his driver's license as he returned from a sports betting parlor in Tijuana, Mexico, but was still allowed past San Diego's main bor­der crossing. 
"I was taken aback a little bit" about being asked for a birth certifi­cate, the 36-year-old pharmacy tech­nician said. "I said I didn't have it. He gave me a reminder slip." 
Customs officials said that delays were minimal across the country and that most motorists had the docu­mentation they needed. 

"It's been a very smooth transi­tion," said Thomas Winkowski, assis­tant commissioner of the Office of Field Operations, Customs and Border Protection. "There have been no issues with wait times." 
Officers at the ports had latitude to admit people who are unaware of the changes once their identities were confirmed. and many points were offering a grace period and handing out fliers explaining the changes.

IN BRIEF 
Economic woes hurt Google profits 
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -Google Inc.'s fourth-quarter profit fell below analyst expec­tations, signaling the crumbling U.S. economy has dented the Internet search leader's mon­eymaking machine. 
The Mountain View-based company said Thursday that it earned $1.21 billion, or $3.79 per share, during the final three months of 2007. 
That's up 17 percent from net income of $1.03 billion, or $3.29 per share, in the same period a year earlier. 
If not for stock awards given to its employ­ees, Google said it would have made $4.43 per share -a penny below the average estimate among analysts polled by Thomson Financial. 
Revenue totaled $4.83 billion, a 51 percent improvement over $3.21 billion in the previous year. 
In a more important measure to investors, Google retained $3.39 billion in revenue after paying commissions to its thousands of adver­tising partners across the Web. 
The net revenue missed analyst estimates by about $60 million, or just under 2 percent. 
Fuel prices and credit hurt spending 
WASHINGTON -Buffeted by soaring fuel prices and tighter credit, consumers increased their spending at the weakest pace in six months. In other signs of trouble, applications for unemployment benefits last week soared by the largest number since Hurricane Katrina. 
The Commerce Department reported Thursday that consumer spending edged up just 0.2 percent in December-the year's peak shopping season. That was down sharply from a 1 percent gain in November. It was the weak­est performance in this area since a similar 0.2 percent rise in June of last year. 
Meanwhile, the Labor Department reported that the number of laid-off workers filing appli­cations for unemployment benefits increased by 69,000 to 375,000 last week. That was the highest level for jobless claims since the week of Oct. 8, 2005, when the economy was dealing with the disruptions caused by Hurricane Katrina and other Gulf Coast hurricanes. 


Bushbudgetmayexceed $3 trillion 
President expected to propose $200 billion in federal health care savings on Monday 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON President Bush's 2009 budget will virtually freeze most domestic pro­grams and seek nearly $200 billion in savings from federal health care programs, a senior administration official said Thursday. 
Overall, the Bush budget will exceed $3 trillion, this oflicial said. The deficit is expected to reach about $400 billion for this year and next. 
Bush on Monday will present his proposed budget for the new fiscal year to Congress, where it's unlikely to gain much traction in the midst of a presidential campaign. The president has prom­ised a plan that would erase the budget deficit by 2012 if his policies are followed. 
To that end, Bush will propose nearly $178 bil­lion in savings from Medicare over five years­nearly triple what he pro­posed last year. Much of the savings would come from freezing reimburse­ment rates for most health care providers for three years. An additional $17 billion would come from the Medicaid pro­Bush's proposal.

IRAQ 
Civilians killed as Iraq violence continues 
Britain's airport base pummeled with 20 rockets as officials realize fragility of recent security improvements 
Associated Press 
BAGHDAD Violence 
returned Thursday to the south­
ern city of Basra, where mili­
tants pummeled Britain's air­
port base with 20 rockets and 
British gunners answered with 
volleys of artillery. Civilians 
were killed and wounded in the 
crossfire. 
In Baghdad, a bomb-rigged 

car blew apart at a bus stop, 
killing at least five people in a 
Shiite enclave that had not seen 
major violence in months. 
The two attacks -in areas 

considered relatively stable ­
were troubling reminders that 
recent improvements in Iraqi 
security were fragile and far 
from deeply rooted. 
The Basra battle also exposed 

potential security gaps around 
Iraq's second-largest city less 
than two months after a scaled­
down British force handed over 
control to Iraqi police and mili­
tary. Hival Shiite factions are 
locked in fierce struggles for 
dominance in Basra and the 
rest of the oil-rich south. 
U.S. forces, meanwhile, have expanded offensives in central and northern Iraq, seeking to build on gains against al-Qaida in Iraq in the past year. But the latest campaigns also have driv­en up the military's death toll after months of decline. 
A U.S. soldier was killed 

Thursday by a roadside bomb 
in Baghdad, the military report­
ed, but gave no other immedi­
ate details. The victim's name 
was not given because family 
had not been notified. 
At least 38 U.S. soldiers have been killed in January -well above the 23 in December but still sharply lower than a year ago. In January last year, 83 soldiers were killed in Iraq. 
Since the beginning of the war in 2003, at least 3,942 members of the U.S. military have died. The total for January could rise; occasionally the mili­tary reports new casualties a f'nw days after they occur. 
Casualty figures were uncer­tain in Basra, where militants launched a 45-minute barrage at dawn with 20 Katyusha rock­ets hitting Britain's base at the airport. The unguided Katyusha, which can be fired from mobile launchers, is a common part of militant arse­nals in Iraq and used elsewhere by militias, including llezbollah in Lebanon. · 
Three British soldiers were reported wounded, but there was little damage to the base. 
The British military said it mspondnd with six high-explo­sive artillery shells -killing at least one person and wounding live. 
An Iraqi military intelligence ol'licer at the British base said about 10 Iraqi civilians were either killed or wounded, although he could not provide a breakdown. The officer spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information. 
"We regret all deaths and injuries in Basra, from whatev­er cause," said Capt. Finn Aldrich, a British military spokesman in Basra. 
"The only people that arc suf­fering because of these attacks are the people of Iraq. These attacks are delaying the devel­opm!~nt of Basra and thtl pros­perity of the people of Basra. Without security and stability, there will be limited foreign investment -investment that will speed up the development of Basra," the spokesman said. 
Although Iraqi forces have command of security in Basra, about 340 miles southeast of Baghdad, Britain currently maintains about 4,500 troops at the airport outside the city and can provide assistance if called. British forces have come under sporadic attacks at the base, but the numbers have fallen dramatically since the hand­over Dec. 16. 
The number of British troops could be further cut to 2,000 by spring. In the months soon after Saddam Hussein was toppled, there were about 40,000 British troops in Iraq.

Cellmate claims woman confessed 
Arnold microwaved baby, Williams says 
Associated Press 
DAYTON, Ohio -A former cellmate of a woman accused of killing her month-old baby by burning the girl in a microwave testified Thursday that the woman confessed to the crime, saying the baby "fit right in" the oven. 
Linda Williams testified that she developed a sexual relation­ship with defendant China Arnold when the two were cell­mates in the Montgomery County jail in March and that Arnold confided in her about what hap­pened to her baby. 
She said Arnold feared that her boyfriend believed he wasn't the child's father and that he was going to leave her. 
"She said she put the baby into the microwave and started it and left the house," Williams said. 
Williams said "She said she put the boyfriend over she asked baby into the whether they

Williams said. baby to the hos­
inmate
Sitting at the defense table, the 27 -year-old Arnold showed little emotion as her trial got under way in the August 2005 death of Paris Talley at their Dayton home. 
Under cross-examination by defense attorney Jon Paul Rion, Williams acknowledged that she met with detectives after the alleged conversation and told them Arnold had said she didn't know how the baby died. 
Williams, who has since been released from jail, said she lied to detectives in that initial inter­view because she had feelings for Arnold. 
In his opening statement. Hion said: "The evidence is going to show that she did not purposely take the life of her own baby." 
Rion said that other people had access to the baby, that Arnold was intoxicated to the point of blacking out when the child died and that people questioned about the case changed their sto­ries. Rion also raised questions about the reliability of the sci­ence when it comes to determin­ing the effect of microwaves on humans. 
Coroner's officials have said the baby suffered high-heat internal injuries and had no external burns. They have ruled out scalding water, open flame or other possible causes of death that could have damaged the skin. 
During the opening statement by Assistant Montgomery County Prosecutor Daniel Brandt, a photo of the burned baby was flashed on a screen for the 12­member jury to see. Arnold sat quietly, occasionally jotting notes on a yellow legal pad. 
Brandt said Arnold killed the 
child after argu­
ing with her 
pital, Brandt 
said, Arnold exclaimed: '"I killed my baby. I killed my baby."' 
Brandt said Arnold later told police it never would have hap­pened had she not gotten so drunk. He said Arnold, who has been in jail since she was charged in November 2006, told Williams she had killed the baby in the microwave and other inmates that she hadn't meant to do it. 
Rion said Arnold, who has three sons, loved having a daughter and quit college and her job so she could stay home and take care of her. Rion said that Arnold's boyfriend was the father of the child, and that it couldn't have been anyone else. 
Suicide numbers trouble Army 
Attempts to curb problem largely unsuccessful as rate continues to climb 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -Multiple new efforts aimed at stemming suicides in the Army are falling short of their goal: The service anticipates another jump in the annual number of soldiers who killed themselves or tried to, including in the Iraq and Afghanistan war zones. 
As many as 121 soldiers com­mitted suicide in 2007, an increase of some 20 percent over 2006, according to prelim­inary fig-u r e s

themselves for some other reason jumped six-fold in the last several years -from 350 in 2002 to about 2,100 incidents last year. Oflicials said an unknown portion of that increase was likely due to use of a new electronic tracking system that is more thorough in capturing health data than the previous system. 
The increases come despite a host of efforts to improve the mental health of a force that has been stressed by lengthy and repeated deployments to the longer-than-expected war in Iraq, and the most deadly year yet in the now six-year-old conflict in Afghanistan. 
"We have been perturbed by the rise despite all of our efforts," said Col. Elspeth Ritchie, psychiatry consultant to the Army surgeon general. 
Those efforts include more training and education pro­grams, the hiring of more men­tal health professionals and the addition of screening programs launched after a succession of studies found the military's peacetime health care system overwhelmed by troops coming home from the two foreign wars. 
"We know we've been doing a lot of training and education," Ritchie told a Pentagon press conference. "Clearly we need to be doing more." 
The preliminary figures on 2007 show that among active duty soldiers and National Guard and Reserve troops that have been activated there were 89 confirmed suicides and 32 deaths that are suspected sui­cides but still under investiga­tion. 
Less than a third of those who committed suicide ­

compared with three there in 2006. 
The total of 121, if all are confirmed, would be more than double the 52 reported in 2001, before the Sept. 11 attacks prompted the Bush administra­tion to launch its counter-terror war. The toll was 87 by 2005 and 102 in 2006. 
Oflicials said the rate of sui­cides per 100,000 active duty soldiers has not yet been calcu­lated for 2007. The 2006 toll of 102 translated to a rate of 17.5 per 100,000, the highest since the Army started count­

firmed. It's common for investi­gations to take time and for officials to study results at length before releasing them publicly. 
Ritchie said Thursday, as she did last year, that officials are finding that failed personal relationships are the main motive for the suicides, fol­lowed by legal and financial problems as well as job-related difficulties. 
Long and repeated tours of duty away from home con­tribute significantly in that they weigh heavily on family rela­tions and compound the other problems, oflicials said. 
"People don't tend to suicide as a direct result of combat," Ritchie said. "But the frequent deployments strain relation­ships. And strained relations and divorce are definitely relat­ed to increased suicide." 
With the Army stretched thin by years of fighting the two wars, the Pentagon last year extended normal tours of duty from 12 months to 15 months and has sent some troops back to the wars several times. The Army has been hoping to reduce tour lengths this sum­mer. But the prospect could depend heavily on what Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, recom­mends when he gives his assessment of security in Iraq and troop needs to Congress in 
April.

Inmate granted reprieve minutes before execution 
Associated Press 
ATMORE, Ala. -A murder­er who would have become the nation"s first executed inmate in months won a reprieve Thursday from the 
U.S. Supreme Court a little more than an hour before he was scheduled to die by lethal injection. 
James Harvey Callahan, set to die at 6 p.m. CST. was granted a stay, Holman prison warden Grantt Culliver told officers on death row. The Supreme Court"s brief order did not detail why it granted the stay. 
It would have been the nation"s first execution since September, when the high court agreed to consider whether lethal injection is cruel and unusual punish­ment. The inmate"s attorney had asked the high court to halt the execution after a fed­eral appeals court lifted a stay granted by a Montgomery judge. 
Callahan was sentenced to death for the 1982 murder of Jacksonville State University 
student  Rebecca  Suzanne  
Howell, who  was  abducted  
from  a  coin  

laundry and raped before b e i n g strangled a n d dumped in a creek. 
H e r mother, 


V e r n a Callahan 
Coheley, and sister, Karen Greer, had arrived to witness the execu­tion. A corrections officer quoted them as saying it was "cruel and unusual" for them to get there only to learn of the stay, said prison system spokesman Brian Corbett. 
The Supreme Court on Sept. 25 agreed to hear a challenge filed by two Kentucky death row inmates over that state"s lethal injection method. No 
U.S. executions have taken place since then, except for one that occurred in Texas just hours after the decision was made. 
Courts have put off several executions pending the Kentucky case, including that of Alabama death row inmate Tommy Arthur. He was to have been put to death at Holman prison near Atmore on Dec. 6, but the Supreme Court stopped the execution a day earlier. 
Callahan challenged Alabama"s method of lethal injection, which like most cap­ital-punishment states is simi­lar to Kentucky"s. The Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday, however, that he waited too long to do so. 
In its 2-1 ruling lifting a lower-court judge"s Dec. 14 stay, the appeals court said it did not make any finding on "the relative merits of Callahan"s constitutional claim because we conclude the claim is barred by the statute of limitations." 
The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the Kentucky case Jan. 7; a ruling is unlikely before spring. 
Kentucky death row inmates Ralph Baze and Thomas Clyde Bowling Jr. claim that lethal injection as practiced by the state amounts to cruel and unusual punishment, in viola­tion of the Eighth Amendment. 
Lethal injections, devised as a humane alternative to elec­trocution and the gas cham­ber, have come under attack in recent years amid reports that the three-drug cocktail doesn't always work as quick­ly as intended and that inmates are subjected to excruciating pain before they die. 
Callahan, who has been on death row for more than a quarter-century, met with a half-dozen relatives, including two sisters and his son, as the hour of the execution approached. He had only a cheeseburger and a Coke for what could have been his last meal. 
Corbett, the Department of Corrections spokesman, said Callahan appeared confident he would get a stay but was "anxious" at times. 
The warden said family members were "overjoyed and applauded when told of the stay." 
Separately Thursday, a young man who says he fatally shot a retired police officer in 2003 because he thought the "A" on the victim's cap meant he was the Antichrist had his death sentence reduced by the Florida Supreme Court. 
The justices unanimously ordered that Ryan Green, 24, be sentenced to life in prisoo without parole based on evi­dence of schizophrenia. A Pensacola jury had rejected his insanity p.lea in convicting Green of first-degree murder, but he appealed only his sen­tence.

Acknowledging, not promoting, racism 
It would be easy to pretend that the racist letters sent last week to hundreds of Notre Dame students were mean­ingless garbage. It would be easy to quickly toss them in the trash without a second glance -although their mes­

Some people have questioned our decision to publish a prominent story about hateful, horribly misguided letters. And they have a point: The man who wrote them doesn't deserve the stir he's caused. At Ohio State, does still exist. There are many injustices in this world that should make people uncomfortable. The reader has a right to know. 
In writing about the letters, we chose to focus on the fact

The Wall came tumbling down 
On Jan. 23, Hamas militants destroyed several large stretches of a seven-mile barricade between Egypt and Gaza, erect­ed by Israel before Hamas came into power last year. Many journalists have referred to the barri­cade as "Gaza's Berlin Andrea Wall," a parallel they Laidman continued to draw last 
week. High Sounding However, the differ-Words ences -not vague similarities -between the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the "fall" of the Gaza border fence are the most important part of the story unfolding in the Middle East. The Berlin Wall fell as a step toward consensus in Germany and as a sign of public desire for unity. The fence intended to keep Palestinians in Gaza and most everything else out was brought down, with the help of blow-torches and explo­sives, out of desperation from within. Reporters on the ground in Gaza and Egypt last Wednesday described the move­ment of tens of thousands of Palestinians in and out of the border city of Rafah as a major shopping spree for food and medi­cine (any movement in or out of Gaza had been prohibited by Israel for more than a week. punishment for rocket attacks on southern Israel). Rather than stop the flow of people or even attempt to direct the crowds, Egyptian soldiers stood aside, reportedly smiling, letting the Palestinians pass. Necessities like sugar for baking and cement for building homes, which are scarce in Gaza and absurdly expensive 
when and where available, were being lugged back across the border openings in huge quantities. 
Some officials in Hamas called the events last Wednesday the beginning of the end of Gaza's isolation. A senior Hamas political advisor in Gaza said, "Actually it's more than just looking for medical or food supplies, it's something like a sense of relief, a sense of freedom." 
These Hamas officials predict a new dynamic in political policies surrounding Gaza, a moral victory for Palestinians and Hamas, and a blow to U.S.-Israeli policy. Hamas also hopes the breakdown at the border will spur a new dialogue with Egypt that will create an arrangement other than re-sealing the Gaza strip. 
These sentiments serve to align the events of last week with the effects of the fall of the Berlin Wall, but the reality is that neither Israeli nor Egyptian officials are viewing the breach of the border in this light. 
The contrast with Berlin comes to a head in this point: the fall of the wall in Gaza does not indicate decades of conflict coming to an end, but, it seems, decades of conflict escalating further still. 
The reaction from Israeli government officials was not the desire to work with Palestinians, but either to seal off Gaza and wave off any responsibility for its resi­dents, or to invade and renew their authority over the territory. 
The Israeli deputy defense minister, Matan VIlnai, called the rush of Palestinians across the border an opportu­nity for Israel to "disconnect" from Gaza. 
"We need to understand that when Gaza is open to the other side we lose responsi­bility for it. So we want to disconnect from it. We want to stop supplying electricity to them, stop supplying them with water and medicine, so that it would come from another place," Vilnai said. 
That place would likely be Egypt, where Israel (and indeed, the U.S.) was throwing responsibility for restoring security and closing the border, and where officials like Vilnai would like to see the burden of Gaza re-positioned. 
But while Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hassarn Zaki said that the bor­der would be open "as long as this is a humanitarian crisis," Egyptian officials have been clear about their intention to re-seal the border-and not to develop any new or cooperative relationships with Ham as. 
Meanwhile, the Israeli defense minister, Ehud Barak, spoke of considering a major invasion of Gaza. 
"Probably we will find ourselves there," Barak told the Associated Press. "We are not rushing to reconquer Gaza, but we will not remove any option from the table when it comes to the security of our citi­zens." 
In Washington, White House spokes­woman Dana Perino characterized the blockade as a means of self-defense for Israel, who she said was also committed to preventing a humanitarian crisis. She called Harnas the "genesis of the prob­lem." 
"The blame for this problem can be laid squarely at the feet of Barnas," Perino said, stating last Wednesday that the polit­ical group sends "upward of 150 rockets a day into Israel." 
The perception of Harnas on the ground at the border openings was quite the opposite. "This is the best thing Barnas has ever done" was the resounding anthem of the day, repeated by Palestinian citizens. 
One woman told a New York Times reporter, "We thank Barnas for this. I'm a Palestinian. not Fatah or Barnas. But I thank Harnas. This is the best thing they have done." 
This range of reactions and conflicting intentions demonstrate that the day "Gaza's Berlin Wall fell" was not like its supposed historical precedent. That does not mean, however, that 1989 Berlin has no lessons to offer the U.S., Egypt, Israel and Palestine in dealing with the question of what to do next in Gaza. Rather than attempt to parallel what has happened, all players must turn to what is needed today. The answer is not dissimilar from what the world needed a dose of in 1989: multi­lateral cooperation, international unity, and practical hope for the future.

Workers and the Catholic university 
I am a Catholic novelist, which makes me a member of a distinct minority in the world of letters. When I arrived at Notre Dame in 1993, I looked forward to teaching at a university where my work would not be regarded as exotic. A veteran of Catholic undergraduate education, I

Columnist 
inent Catholic university, debates, trumpets and worries about our Catholic identity more than any other institution I know. One of the administration's biggest current worries is how to attract and retain gifted, productive Catholic fac­ulty and those drawn to our Catholic mission. The Provost's Committee on Recruiting Outstanding Catholic Faculty recently issued a report filled with sensible rec­ommendations about how we might achieve that goal. 
As a fairly-paid, well-treated faculty member, I'd like to add one more suggestion to the list: let's make Notre Dame the Catholic university known for the fairest labor practices in the country. What's the connection, you ask, between attracting a first-rate faculty to a Catholic uni­versity and treating the other workers on campus fairly? 
The way we treat our extensive staff and our part-time faculty says everything about the ethos and morals of this University. Paying our workers fairly and listening to their concerns will demonstrate that Notre Dame's Catholicism is more than a pious group identity. Fair labor practices embody the Gospel values at the heart of Notre Dame's mission. 
We should all be encouraged that Notre Dame staff members receive many of the same benefits as faculty. We should be proud that the University has chosen to retain many food service jobs that other colleges have outsourced. But when Notre Dame says that its wages are locally competitive, we should examine the claim carefully. We don't have to drive very far from Notre Dame's campus to see the visible signs of how very trou­bled the local economy is, or how many South Bend workers struggle. We are competing with wages that sen­tence many local workers to constant anxiety and, often, to two jobs just to pay the bills. That kind of "competi­tion" is hardly Catholic. 
I teach a course called "Class, Labor, Narrative" whose reading list includes Pope Leo XIII's encyclical Rerum Novarurn and the Catholic Worker Dorothy Day's memoir The Long Loneliness. Like so many of my students, I am troubled by the gap between the struggle for fair labor practices I teach about and this Catholic University's insti­tutional reality. When the University outsourced book­store jobs to a private corporation, many University employees lost their Notre Dame affiliation and benefits. I know office workers who put in a long week at Notre Dame, then moonlight to provide for their families. And recently, I met a custodial worker at Notre Dame, a single mother of four, who admitted embarrassment that she must supplement her full-time Notre Dame wages with food stamps. Now, there's a challenge to our Catholic identity. 
Last summer Father Wilson Miscamble, professor of history here, published a compelling article, "The Corporate University," in the magazine America. Miscamble argued that "Catholic schools, especially those with significant financial resources, should undertake to provide a 'living wage' for their lowest paid employees." Of course paying our workers better without outsourcing any more jobs will require either a different allocation of resources or more resources, and of course there is already fierce competition for those resources. But com­mitted faculty, administrators, staff and alumni might undertake the joint task of fully supporting our workers with a renewed sense of common purpose. 
Our first step should be to listen to workers themselves. Dorothy Day, in the midst of a strike by cemetery workers employed by the Diocese of New York, reminded Cardinal Spellman of the workers' "right to talk over their griev­ances .... They have indeed labored with the sweat of their brows, not lived off the sweat of anyone else." Notre Dame workers should know that they are surrounded by faculty who recognize their hard work and support their desire to be treated with dignity and to discuss their visions of a just working environment. 
They should know that they are surrounded by faculty who believe that fair labor practices will attract precisely the kind of students, teachers, staff, and administrators who belong at a Catholic university. Fair labor practices will help us match our stated beliefs to our practices. Fair labor practices will affirm our University's identity and our own commitment to each other, members of a truly Catholic community.

Based on his earlier work, Votolato hasn't always been so mellow. According to his website, roekyvotolato.eom, he grew up in the town of Frost, Texas (pop.

Despite listing Willie N1~lson, Steve Earle, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Johnny Cash as his musical inspirations, Votolato went on to form a punk band named Waxwing with his brother Cody. With albums like 2003's "Suicide Medicine," Waxwing pre­sented a more volatile Votolato. 
Since taking a departure from his roots, Votolato's more recent work bettor represents his music as a product of his environment.

On Sunday, Notre Dame kicked off a competition that it hopes will renew recycling efforts around campus. Heeyclemania is a 1 0-week, nationwide competition in which more than 400 schools will compete to reduce waste and increase recycling. In order to motivate students to recycle, Notre Dame has decided to make the intercollegiate com­petition interhall as well. 
The Energy and Environmental Issues Committee and student government are sponsoring the event and the competition between dorms is being monitored and tallied by the Students For Environmental Action. There aren't many rules to this competition, just recy­cle. Oh, and steal. 
In addition to encouraging each dorm to increase its own reeycling, the compe­tition allows students to lift recycling from other dorms, but warns that getting caught in the act will likely incur retalia­tion. Students are permitted to take recy­clables from other buildings on campus, but under one stipu­lation: The recy­clables must be dug out of trash bins. 
Sifting recyclables from garbage may sound like a dirty job, but it's some­thing that some stu­dents on campus already do. Junior Ann Kelley, a mem­ber of Notre Dame's Students for Environmental Action (NDSEA), says that she and many fellow students often root out recyclables they find improperly placed in trash bins. "We're used to dig­ging through the trash," she said. 
In addition to the recycling competi­tion, other recycling-oriented events will be taking place in the upcoming weeks. In the fourth week of Recydemania, a Mass will be held at DeBartolo, and Notre Dame's waste will be put on dis­play. Also, about seven weeks in, there will be an art competition that will encourage students to create artwork out of recycled products, including crafting a

trophy, which will be given to the dorm that wins the competition. 
NDSEA is hoping Hecyclemania will be remind students how easy it is to recycle on campus. 
This school year, Notre Dame began a new single-stream recycling system. Similar in design to Game-Day Recycling, an aU-in­one recycling plan implemented last year largely thanks to NDSEA Core members Lourdes Long and Colleen Kelly, single-stream recycling allows stu­dents to put all their recyclables in one 
place. Unlike the recycling infrastructure from previous years, which confused stu­dents with different bins for different recyclables, single-stream simplifies the system down to one bin where students can recycle everything from newspaper to empty cans and bottles. 
However, single-stream recycling didn't produce the immediate results it should have. "We feel it wasn't very well publi­cized," Kelley said. But it might be more than just a eommunication problem. 
Fellow NDSEA member Jackie Mirandola-Mullen, a sophomore in 
Howard Hall, put things plainly. "We're just lazy," she said. Mirandola-Mullen pointed out that a student will often toss a bottle in a trash can, rather than depositing it in the recycling bin right next to it. 
Kelley and Mirandola-Mullen also believe that the labels on recycling bins are insufficient. They stressed that stu­dents often don't realize all the things that they can recycle. "There's a very minimal amount that should actually be thrown away," Kelley said. 
NDSEA wants students to know they can recycle cardboard, newspaper, alu­minum cans, bottles of every kind and many types of plastic. The Styrofoam cups from the dining hall can even be recycled. However, Kelley said the cups used at Starbucks are not recyclable, and NDSEA encourages students to bring their own mugs to the coffee shop. 
With recycling now conveniently locat­ed around dorms, stealing it from your cross-campus rival should be relatively easy. But while Hecyclemania is about fun and mischief. it's also about being aware. Kelley said she once made a sign that read "Every time you don't recycle, a kitten dies." While throwing a bottle in the garbage instead of the recycling bin may not kill a cat, hopefully the thought will help you rethink a careless decision.

There are three notes in a musical triad and three members of Jukebox the Ghost. Coincidence? In the case of Jukebox, probably not. With its mix of eccentric lyrics, piano proficiency and upbeat tem­pos, the upstart band from Washington, 
D.C. has struck a chord with casual lis­teners and seasoned fans alike, inspiring ·· rave reviews and building a growing underground following. 
Legends keys up its calendar this week­end with a performance from the indie pop-rocking trio, set to storm the stage after Rocky Volatalo performs at 10 p.m. 
In devising band names, Jukebox the Ghost came up with the perfect stage name for itself, as the group's music calls to ear bygone bands and shades of songs past while infusing its tunes with an up­tempo and youthful flair. 
The genius of Jukebox starts with the talented fingers and vocal chords of pianist and singer Ben Thomewill. The man tickling the ivories has also tickled the fancy of listeners and reviewers, who have compared him to both Ben Folds and Queen, high praise for any piano man. And as far as his voice goes, Thomewill tends to maintain a fairly tem­
perate pitch while occasion­

ally breaking into falsetto forays. 
Don't let the cascading ripples of piano notes and shrill trilling fool you, how­ever -Jukebox can jam with the best of them. Guitarist Tommy Siegel enters this department as Jukebox's resident rocker. Drummer Jesse Kristin keeps the band on beat by alternately pounding out the percussion backbones to the band's frenetic songs and slowing things down for its low-key tunes. 

Part of that diversity of sound comes from the band's musical inspiration. "All of the members have incredibly different influences," manager Seth Kallen said. "Ben (piano) is classically trained, and takes a lot from classical composers. Tommy (guitar) is a big Frank Zappa fan and Jesse (drums) played in a bunch of punk bands throughout high school." 
Thomewill and company met during their years at George Washington University and decided to form the band from there. Thomewill said he originally planned on a career in politics, but then changed tracks, becoming a music major. It seems safe to say he made a wise career decision. Although Jukebox has graduated from college, its manager says that the band's origins make for great university concerts. 
"The band has never been to South Bend, but are really looking forward to playing at ND," Kallen said. "Their early shows were at a ton of college parties at GWU, their alma mater, so it's great doing stuff like this on the road." 
The band has come a long way and continues to travel wide and far since arriving on the scene in our nation's capi­tal. Jukebox is currently in the midst of a tour spanning the Midwest to the East Coast and then down south.

Jukebox the Ghost is bringing its hip, piano-driven sound to Legends. 
With its hip combination of quirks, craftsmanship and cool factor, Jukebox the Ghost figures to bring panache to the stage for its Saturday night show. Even better, since all Legends concerts have free admission for students, you won't even have to part with a quarter to hear this Jukebox play.

capability to give viewers instead of wallowing for refreshing change for an aging fan base. Unfortunately, the adult roles of Coach Whitey, Karen Roe and Deb Scott have passed to possible guest stars. As well, the opening credits no longer feature Gavin DeGraw's "I Don't WannaBe." The changes are a risky leap for the show, but ones that will hopefully pay off. 
The show's storyline has been infused with even more drama. Lucas (Chad Michael Murray) is struggling to write his second book, Peyton (Hilarie Burton) is fal­

more life-altering twists -like engagements, weddings and career drama -to propel the plot forward. 
Schwahn's decision to skip ahead four years presents several advantages. The actors and actresses are playing charac­ters much closer to their actual age, a 
half of the season, the characters have decided to get their lives back on track. Peyton quit her thankless job and headed back to Tree Hill, but too late, finding her ex, Lucas, dating his edi­tor, Lindsey (Michaela McManus). As well, Brooke has returned home to be by Peyton's side and Nathan has realized he's an alcoholic. 

New actors have also joined the cast. Last season's villain, Dan Scott, the father of Lucas and Nathan, is in jail for mur­dering his brother, so soap veteran Daphne Zuniga is the new baddie in town. She plays Veronica, the domineer­ing executive of Brooke's company as well as Brooke's hellish mother. Torey DeVitto plays Nanny Carrie who is filling Haley's role of wife and mother. The best addition to the cast has been Jackson Brundage as Nathan and Haley's son, James Lucas Scott. Brundage is an adorable boy with serious acting chops. 
The jump into the future will bring more adult storylines -previous seasons have tackled controversial issues like teen pregnancy, breast cancer, and death and school shootings. Luckily it appears that the love triangle of Peyton, Lucas and Brooke will be avoided this time around. 
Due to the writers strike, "One Tree Hill" is scheduled to end after only seven new episodes. The last will be the show's lOOth episode.

Tennessee Titans comerback Adam "Pacman" Jones, left, listens Thursday in a courtroom in Murfreesboro, Tenn., as District Attorney William Whitesell recommends that charges against Jones be dismissed. One criminal charge is still pending. 
Judge drops 2 charges against Pactnan 
Associated Press 
MURFREESBORO, Tenn. -Adam "Pacman" Jones is busy clearing away the legal problems that led to his suspension from the NFL. 
Jlis biggest challenge may be proving he can control himself. 
Suspended for the 2007 season, the NFL will review Jones' status aftPr the Pro Bowl. But commissioner Roger Goodell has said actions, not words, speak loudest. 
A Tennessee judge dis­missed two misdemeanor charges Thursday from an incident Aug. 25, 2006, leaving only one criminal charge still pending against him in Georgia. But Jones didn't help himself by being in an Atlanta strip club Jan. 3 while the Titans were prepping for a playoff game. 

An attorney who asked that Jones be arrested for allegedly punching her withdrew her request Jan. 
16. Atlanta police said Thursday they will not investigate Jones without the victim's help. 
Worrick Robinson, one of Jones' attorneys, said the issue of the cornerback being in a club remained and that there's no excuse for that. 
"He's a grown man.... But he's got to take respon­sibility for his actions. When he's asked, he's 
IN BRIEF Forsberg spurns Modo, 
wants to return to NHL 
STOC:KIIOLM, Sweden -Peter Forsberg has decided not to play for his hometown team Modo this season, instead setting his sights on a return to the NHL. 
Forsberg made the announcement to Modo hours before the deadline for transfers in the Swedish hockey league. "My goal is to go back to the NHL," Forsberg told Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet. 
The 34-year-old Forsberg has been sidelined with a foot and ankle injury since finishing last season with the Nashville Predators, but has recently indicated he wants to return to the NHL if he is healthy. 
He has practiced with Modo in his hometown of Ornskoldsvik, raising hopes there that he would play for the team in the Swedish league. Modo sports director Erik Holmberg said that Forsberg informed the club Thursday he would not be available this season. 

going to have to step up and say he was there, that there is no excuse," Robinson said. 
Goodell's strict standards are well documented. 
Bengals linebacker Odell Thurman is hoping for full reinstatement by April after sitting out the last two seasons. 
Originally suspended the first four games of the 2006 season for skipping a drug test, the punishment was extended to a full sea­son after a drunk driving arrest. Two Georgia men accused Thurman of kick­ing and hitting them at a party last June. No charges were filed, but Goodell turned down Thurman's request to reinstate him for 
Upshaw, union threaten 
strike if owners opt out 
PHOENIX -A defiant Gene Upshaw said that if the NFL's owners opt out of the current labor agreement later this year, the players' union is ready for a strike or the decertification tactics it used to get free agency after the 1987 walk­out. 
"If they want to get out of the deal, there's nothing we can do about it," the executive director of the NFL Players Association said Thursday before the union's annual Super Bowl news confer­ence. "But we'll be prepared." 
The labor agreement reached after tough bargaining in March of 2006 gave both sides the right to opt out in November. That would lead to 2010 being an uncapped year before the con­tract expires in 2011. 
Several owners, including Denver's Pat Bowlen, have suggested that the current agreement is leaving some teams cash­strapped and making it likely that the owners will opt out next year. 
last season. 
The Titans might not want Jones back. 
They went from giving up the most yards defensively in the NFL with Jones in 2006 to fifth best and a 10­6 record with a playoff berth without him. A video popped up recently on the Internet showing Jones saying he saw himself in Dallas with a couple Pro Bowls in two or three years. 
Jones did not comment Thursday when asked if he had done enough to be reinstated. Robinson said the video was shot last summer when Jones was upset at not being allowed to take part in training camp. 

~acks.on protests umpire

NEW YORK -Jesse Jackson criticized Major League Baseball on Thursday for sending investigators to the hometowns of umpires to ask neighbors questions that include whether the umpire belongs to the Ku Klux Klan. 
"Major League Baseball has done a dis­service to its progressive social history by equating southern whites with white supremacists," Jackson said in a state­ment. "I am surprised the professional league which helped change social atti­tudes in all sports leagues about segrega­tion, by championing Jackie Robinson, would make such a destructive move." 
World Umpires Association president John I-lirschbeck and union spokesman Lamell McMorris said Wednesday that Tom Christopher, the Milwaukee-based supervisor of security and investigations in the commissioner's office, had asked ques­tions about Klan membership to neighbors of umpires Greg Gibson and Sam Holbrook, who reside in Kentucky.

Nash, Paul among All-Star reserves 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Chris Paul and David West were picked for their first All-Star game Thursday night, giving the hometown Hornets a pair of players for the event New Orleans will host next month. 
Detroit, Phoenix and Washington also had multiple players chosen as reserves for the Feb. 17 game. Boston will only send two of its Big Three to the Big Easy. Paul Pierce was voted in by Eastern Conference head coaches to join starter Kevin Garnett, but Hay Allen fell short. 
"No Hay? That's crazy," Pierce said. "I think Ray should have been on there based on our reeord and what we're doing team-wise." 
The Pistons' Chauncey Billups and Hichard Hamilton arc headed back for the third straight year, while the Suns will be represented by Steve Nash and Amare Stoudemire. Caron Butler and Antawn Jamison also were recognized for their strong play, which has kept the Wizards in the middle of the playoff race despite the absence of injured guard GilbPrt Arenas. 
"To find a way to turn things around and play at a very high level and be very competitive in our confer­ence," Jamison said, "it speaks volumes for the type of year Caron and myself are having." 
Toronto's Chris Bosh and Atlanta guard Joe Johnson were the other players picked for the East, which will be coached by Boston's Doc Rivers. Dallas forward Dirk Nowitzki, the reigning NBA MVP, Utah's Carlos Boozer and Portland guard Brandon Roy were selected from the West. 
Paul, Nash and Roy emerged from a crowded group of West guards to beat out the likes of Golden State's Baron Davis, Utah point guard Deron Williams, and Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili from the defending champion San Antonio Spurs. 
Also missing out during the worst season of his career was Shaquille O'Neal, ending his streak of 14 consecutive All-Star selections. That tied the record held by Jerry West and Karl Malone. 
Paul, the 2006 Rookie of the Year, and West have helped the Hornets to a 32-13 record, which led the Southwest Division entering the night. New Orleans could still get another representa­tive, as Byron Scott will coach the West if the Hornets win their next game, or Dallas loses either of its next two. 
Paul is averaging 20.8 points, 10.7 assists and a league-leading 2.6 steals. He has just one fewer steal (110) than turnover for the season. 
David West averages 19.6 points and 9.4 rebounds. 
Garnett, LeBron James, Orlando's Dwight Howard, New Jersey's Jason Kidd and Miami's Dwyane Wade were voted by fans to start for the East. The West starters are Denver's Carmelo Anthony and Allen Iverson, the Lakers' Kobe Bryant, San Antonio for­ward Tim Duncan and Houston center Yao Ming. 
Coaches were then required to vote for two guards, two forwards, a center and two players regardless of position. East coaches bypassed a nat­ural center, picking Bosh, a power forward, at that spot. 
Allen, averaging 18 points for a Boston team that began the night with an NBA-best 35-8 record, was perhaps the most noticeable omission in the East. Orlando was hoping for a spot for Hedo Turkoglu, averaging a career-best 19.4 points. 
"Obviously, I think Ray should have made it," Rivers said. "The fact that he had to sacrifice the most of the three. It's unfortunate that the other coaches didn't see it that way." 
Allen was beat out by Billups and Hamilton, who were selected for the first time together in 2006, when the Pistons were en route to a franchise-best 64 wins. 
"I am excited. I'm geeked," Hamilton said.

Spagnuolo turns Giants 'D' around 
Associated Press 
CHANDLER, Ariz. -Steve Spagnuolo didn't mind setting the record straight about his last name. 
It's Italian and, as his father would say, the 'g' is silent. 
"Spah-NYOO'-loh," said the New York Giants defensive coor­dinator and the man responsible for coming up with a Super Bowl game plan to stop Tom Brady and the New England Patriots' run to a perfect season. 
The 48-year-old Spagnuolo has made a pronounced difference with the defense in his first year after making the trip up from Philadelphia, where he spent eight seasons learning the Eagles' attacking defense under veteran coordinator Jim Johnson. 
In the eight months after his hiring, Spagnuolo taught that same aggressive system to a team that had given up 362 points in posting an 8-8 record the previous season. The hope was that the Giants would became the Eagles of northern New Jersey, one of the NFI;s elite defenses. 
The early result was utter fail­ure. New York gave up 80 points in the opening two weeks of the season, losing 45-35 in Dallas and then dropping a 35-13 deci­sion at home to the Green Bay Packers. 
At a time when there were calls for Tom Coughlin's job, there were also questions about Spagnuolo and whether he had learned anything from Johnson. 
The day after the loss to the Packers, the defense went over the videotape with "Spags," as they call him-the 'g, of course, pronounced. 
"He came in and never wavered," defensive end Justin Tuck said. "He never cussed any­one out or downgraded guys. He just stayed the course and that meant a lot to me. He didn't know us and we didn't know him. For him to come in and continue to show faith in us and tell us that he believed in us and what we could do, that made a big impression." 
Spagnuolo said the most important thing he learned from Johnson was patience. 
"When we put in a blitz or something, if the first time it did­n't work, it was OK with Jimmy," Spagnuolo said. "He stuck with it. He stuck with what he believed in. We won many games because of that." 
With the Giants, Spagnuolo knew the system worked and he was certain he had the talent to make it work. The only question was how long would it take.

Belles drop third straight 
By GRIFFIN DASSATTI 
Sports Writer 
Ringing in a victory hasn't been easy lately for the Belles. After losing to two of the strongest teams in the MIAA [Calvin and Hope] last week, the team was dealt a third loss by the Olivet Comets Wednesday. 
Saint Mary's started off strong in Wednesday's game. Junior Megan Conanty quickly racked up nine points in the first four minutes of play. Olivet went on a scoring run with 8:27 in the first period, quickly closing the gap. Thanks to a 3-pointer by junior Erin Newsom with nine seconds left in the half, the Belles led 33-31. 
But they weren't able to hold on. After increasing their lead to 38-31 less than 
two minutes into the second period, Saint Mary's defense wasn't able to stop Olivet from getting the ball into the net. Olivet quickly rebound­ed with a 55-49 lead with ten minutes left in the game. 
The Comet's continued to score, winning 80-70 over the Belles . 
Saint Mary's manages to score and average 67.6 points per game, but some­how its opponents are find­ing ways to overrun the players. The team has lost the last three games by ten points or less, including a nine-point loss to first­ranked Hope last Saturday. 
The Belles struggled on the boards Wednesday night as they were outrebounded 38-34. Rebounding hasn't been much of an issue lately for Saint Mary's. Coach Jenn Henley said she feels the team's rebounding has 
"improved all season and we need to continue those efforts." 
The Belles will head to Adrian College in Adrian, Mich. Saturday to take on the Bulldogs at 3 p.m It will be Saint Mary's last away game this season before the MIAA Championship tourna­ment starts Feb. 25. 
Adrian (4-5 MIAA, 6-11 overall) is ranked one spot above Saint Mary's (4-6 MIAA, 8-10 overall) in the MIAA. But the Bulldogs haven't been a problem for the Belles recently. In the teams' two meetings last season, the Belles won both, 56-48 and 84-72, respective­ly. Saturday's meeting is the first of two for the season ­the two face off again at Saint Mary's on Feb. 20.

Belles look to rebound at ho111e versus Hornets 
By PETE REISENAUER 
Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's will look to get back to winning tonight when it takes on Kalamazoo College in its only home meet of the year. 
The Belles have dropped their previous three matches and hope their fortunes will shift in tonight's meet. Belles coach Ryan Dombkowski thinks his team has a chance to come away with a victory -though it won't be easy. 
"I think we'll need to swim out of [our] minds to win, but that's what you're trying for every day. So, anything could happen," Dombkowski said. 
The Belles have been posting solid times lately, but the swim­mers will have to strive for faster races. Dombkowski said Kalamazoo is "probably a much deeper team, if you look at past results on paper" and has a returning All-American in swimmer Katie Stefl. 
Still, he thinks his team will field some close matchups. 
"We'll be competitive in most of the events," Dombkowski said. "So digging deep to find that little bit extra during the last few yards is going to mean a lot in a meet like this." 
Dombkowski sees the race as a warm-up for the MIAA swim­ming and diving championships that will take place Feb. 13-16. 
"We want to use this as an opportunity to work on our race strategies," Dombkowski said. "Improve some of the finer points of our technique ­starts, turns, etc. -and really get prepared for our confer­ence meet coming up in two weeks." 
Tonight's meet against Kalamazoo begins at 7.

Everett continues steps toward full recovery 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -Kevin Everett slowly unbuttons his suit jacket and sits down. 
It hardly seems like a big deal, those three little buttons. For Everett, though, it is nothing short of amazing. Less than five months after the catastrophic collision that doctors said might leave him paralyzed -or worse -he is walking and slowly regaining full use of his hands. 
''I'm happy people ean know me like this," Everett said Thursday in an interview with The Associated Press. "They can look at me and see what I've overcome and I'm still trying to overcome, and just see that life isn't that bad after all. 
"It could be a whole lot worse." 
The Buffalo Bills tight end was playing speeial teams when he taekled Domenik Hixon on the second-half kiekoff Sept. 9. His helmet struck Hixon's helmet and shoulder pad, and he inlme­diately fell face-down on the turf. He lay motionless for what seemed like hours as medical personnel worked on him and the crowd at Halph Wilson Stadium watched in silent hor­ror. 
His spinal-cord injury was so severe, orthopedic surgeon Andrew Cappuccino said the next day that Everett's chances of a full neurologic recovery were "bleak, dismal." It was 
unlikely he would ever walk again. 
"He was just going off of past research on the injury. I couldn't expect him to say anything else but what he said beeause he did­n't know the outeome. Nobody did," Everett said. "I was just hoping for the best. We were giv­ing everybody the worst-ease scenario." 
Everett is telling the story of his aeeident and recovery, as well as its impact on everyone around him, in "Standing Tall: The Kevin Everett Story," which was written with Sam Carchidi and eomes out Friday. Although his main goal in telling his story was to inspire others with spinal­cord injuries, he believes anyone can learn from it. 
He and fiancee Wiande Moore are spending two days doing interviews before f1ying to the Super Bowl, courtesy of an invi­tation from NFL commissioner Hoger Goodell. Moore said the couple will root for the New York Giants against the unbeaten New England Patriots because they're the underdogs. 
As Everett has proven these last five months, never count out an underdog. 
"I just saw it as a temporary little injury," he said. "It's not anything that's going to hold me back." 
He is, though, trying to figure out where his life will take him next.

Drew rebuilds Baylor after tragedy, scandal 
Associated Press 
WACO, Texas -Scott Drew came to Baylor from Valparaiso in 2003 with a task no coach should have to face: rebuild a program ravaged by the mur­der of' a player by a tmunmate and seandalized by a former coach who tried to cover up NCAA violations in tlw after­math. 
Tlw rostnr was decimated al'tN the top thn~e scon~rs toi>k advantage of' relaxed transfer ruins. Sr.hool-imposed sandions rnduend scholarships and n~eruiting visits. The NCAA later strippnd the team of' play­ing a nonconfnrnnce schedule. 
Thn best advice Drew got was from his father -a basketball coach and his mentor -and had nothing to do with X's and O's. Instead. llomer Drew told his son to read Job, a Biblical chapter that diseussns the suf­fering of the righteous and true faith. 
Consider where Baylor stands today. The No. 25 Bears (16-3, 4-1 Big 12) are ranked for the first time in 39 years. They are nnar the top of' the Big 12 and headed for their first NCAA tournament si111:e 19X8. 
"I don't sen how anybody out­sidn could totally appreciate how dnvastated and how far down it was," former Baylor football coach (;rant Tea!T said. "This is good not only from the standpoint of restoring the pro­gram, but gives a chance for Baylor to move away from that devastating time." 
That was five summers ago, when Patrick Dennehy's body was discovered six weeks after he was reported missing. Carlton Dotson pleaded guilty to murder and is serving a 35­year prison term. 
The death sparked a scandal that led to the resignation of coaeh Dave Bliss, who on tapes secretly reeorded by an assis­tant coach tried to portray Dennehy as a drug dealer. School investigators already had determined Bliss paid up to $40,000 in tuition for Dennehy and another player and improperly solicited $87,000 from boosters. 
Baylor, the world's largest Baptist university, offered the job to Scott Drew. lie was 32 then and a head coach for only one season at Valparaiso, where he won 20 games after nine years there as his father's assistant. 
"The greatest thing that Scott did was bring energy, enthusi­asm and a positive attitude," said athletic director Ian McCaw. who was hired a couple of weeks after Drew. "That's what really paved the way for us to move the program for­ward and really mitigate some or the challenges." 
Drew's infectious optimism and enthusiasm were exactly what Baylor needed. 
"It was just a good lit," said Homer Drew, who then 


returned to the Valparaiso bench. 
"Each and every game, he has so much energy that he makes you just want to go out and play that much harder for him," said Curtis Jerrells, the leading scorer (14.4 points) on a team with live double-figure scorers. 
With only five scholarship players available at times dur­ing Scott Drew's first season, 

the overmatched Bears went 8­21 but managed to win three Big 12 games. 
A year later, Baylor had the nation's most inexperienced team with only one returning scholarship player. Then came the 2005-06 season when the NCAA, after considering a full­season ban for the wrongdoing under Bliss, took away the non­conference schedule and the Bears went more than 300 days between games before going 4­13. 
"The toughest times were when we lost that season, then we started playing and things didn't go well," Drew said. "You see your players down, sec them frustrated. Like a parent. you hate seeing that." 
It wasn't until last season that the Bears linally got to play a full schedule with a full roster under Drew, and went 15-16.

Prince's 3 lifts Pistons over Lakers 
Associated Press 
AUBURN HILLS, Mich. ­Kobe Bryant was unstoppable at times, scoring 10 straight points in the third quarter and finishing with 39. 
With the game on the line, though, the Detroit Pistons prevented him from attempt­ing a game-winning shot. 
Tayshaun Prince made a 3­pointer with 4.5 seconds left and Lamar Odom shot an air­ball, giving Detroit a 90-89 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday night. 
Bryant was upset about not getting a chance to lift the Lakers to a rare win at The Palace, but talked calmly about it 30 minutes later. 
"What are you going to do when guys are open? If I catch the ball, what am I going to do, go one on three?" he asked. "We made the right play, we just didn't complete it." 
Bryant had an unusual triple-double, adding a career­high 11 turnovers and 10 rebounds to his scoring total. 
"I have to make smarter decisions with the basketball," he said. 
The Pistons have won nine straight at home over the Lakers, including three games to win the 2004 NBA finals, dating to Jan. 18, 2002. 
Detroit led by as many as 17 in the first half, then fell behind when Bryant scored 10 straight to put the Lakers ahead 62-58 with 4:18 left in the third. 
The Lakers led 72-67 enter­ing the fourth, and it was a seesaw game the rest of the way. 
Prince led the Pistons with 22 points while All-Stars Chauncey Billups and Richard Hamilton scored 16 and 14, respectively. Rookie reserves Arron Afflalo and Rodney Stuckey added 10 apiece. 
"Tay hit the shot, but the bench is what won it for us," Billups said. 
Bryant didn't have much help. 
Derek Fisher scored 15 and reserve Ronny Turiaf had 12 points, but lamented missing a free throw with 17 seconds remaining that proved to be costly. 
"I feel terrible because I let the guys down," Turiaf said. 
Detroit has won four straight, while Los Angeles has dropped four of its last five games. 
The Lakers had a chance to end their skid at The Palace, but could not corral a key rebound before Prince made the game-winning shot. 
With 16 seconds left, Prince passed to Billups, who dished to Rasheed Wallace, who missed a shot. The Pistons got to the offensive rebound and Prince was later open in the corner for a 3-pointer. 
"When another team gets an offensive rebound, it always seems that's the easiest time to hit a 3," Detroit coach Flip Saunders said. 


It was a disheartening way for the Lakers to start a nine­game road trip, where they will be challenged by a gruel­ing schedule and short-hand­ed roster. 
They dressed just 11 play­ers, as Luke Walton (hip) was active but not in uniform with day-to-day status. Andrew Bynum (left knee), Chris Mihm (right ankle) and Trevor Ariza (right foot) were on the inac­tive list. 
"It's a tough loss because I felt like we had the game, but we made mental errors down the stretch," Bryant said. "But I'm encouraged and if we keep playing hard like this on the trip, we'll be all right." 
Detroit, which began a five­game homestand, had played 10 of the previous 14 games on the road. 
Los Angeles got off to a rough start, matching a sea­son high with nine turnovers in the first quarter -with Bryant contributing three of them -as it fell behind 29­22. 
The Pistons built a huge lead in the second only to see it whittled to a seven-point advantage at halftime. 
Los Angeles took advantage of a disparity at the line, mak­ing 16 of 22 free throws while Detroit connected on both attempts in the first half. 
The Lakers finished with 35 free throws to Detroit's 16, leading to constant bickering from the Pistons' players and coaches that drew three tech­nicals. 
"We were able to kind of get back into the game because of that," coach Phil Jackson said.

Pierce, Allen lead Celtics past Mavs

BOSTON -Rajon Rondo knows he isn't going to outjump Dirk Nowitzki. So the 6-foot-1 Celtics point guard had to out­think him. 
Rondo had a season-high 12 rebounds, swiping the ball from Nowitzki and putting in a reverse layup with 42 seconds left to give the Celtics the lead, and Boston held on to beat the Dallas Mavericks 96-90 on Thursday night. 
"He didn't block me out, so I went up under and got the ball," Rondo said. "I just wanted to get it up quickly before the defense recognized that I had the ball." 
Playing without Kevin Garnett for the third straight game, Paul Pierce and Ray Allen scored 26 points apiece to help the Celtics remain unbeaten against the Western Conference. And they did it against one of the West's best teams while overcoming 31 points and 11 rebounds from Nowitzki. 
Nowitzki, who along with Pierce was picked as an All-Star reserve about an hour before the game, made a pair of free throws with 58 seconds left to tie it at 90. The Celtics got the ball to Pierce, but his shot went around the rim and out. 
Along came Rondo to grab the ball away from Nowitzki and put in the game-winner. 
"I had the rebound in my hand," Nowitzki said, "and then Rondo came out of nowhere and snuck it up to the basket before I could react." 
A miss and an offensive 
rebound gave the Mavericks the ball out of bounds with 17 sec­onds left, but Jason Terry's run­ner was altered to avoid a blocked shot and James Posey came down with the rebound. Posey hit two foul shots, then tipped the ball away from Terry at halfcourt in the closing sec­onds to ice it. 
"Any game we win without Kevin is important for us, part of our growth process," Celtics coach Doc Rivers said. "Dallas is a team that we are still trying to catch, in our minds. They've been there. So when we play those types of teams, they're important." 
The nationally televised game between two of the NBA's top teams drew the usual collection of celebrities at courtside, including Red Sox players Jonathan Papelbon and Coco Crisp. Celtics Hall of Farner Bill Russell got a big cheer when he took his seat near the Mavericks bench. 
No players from the New England Patriots this time, though: They're down in Arizona preparing for Sunday's Super Bowl against the New York Giants. 
The Celtics had lost two of their last four and five of their last 11 since opening the season 29-3 to earn Rivers the honor of coaching the Eastern Conference at the Feb. 17 All­Star game in New Orleans. Dallas' loss deprived Mavericks coach Avery Johnson of the chance to coach the West, which instead went to the Hornets' Byron Scott.

Tean1 faces challenge at IU Relays 
By ALEX BARKER Sports Writer 

One week after staging a comebar.k in the final two events of the Notre Dame Invitational to salvage a tie with Miehigan State, the Irish will compete in the biggest meet so far this season, the Indiana Helays at Indiana University Bloomington. 
"This weekend's competition will be a stop up from previous mnets," Irish coaeh Tim Connelly said. 
The Irish will r.ompete with 20 other teams including No. 22 Indiana and fellow Big East opponents Marquette and Cincinnati. 
The Irish posted a solid per­formance in last week's ment. However, Connelly is not com­pletely satislied. 
"We still have a very long way to go to be at full strength and be close to our full potnntial." Connelly said. "The big focus for us this weekend will be to eontinue to improve and com­pete well against tough compe­tition." 
Anna Weber had a earner­high throw in the weight throw and a season best time for the 400-meter relay team. The Irish made great strides last week as Anna Webor threw a carePr-high 1H.HH meters in the wnight throw and the Irish 400­metnr relay tnam finished with a snason high time of 3:52.61. Notre Dame set SIWI~ral more Big East qualil'ying marks and Weber's throw was nnough to qualify her for an NCAA bid. 
The Irish will look to keep this monwntum going as they lwad on tlw road for the first time this season.

After dominating its exhibi­tion last week against Robert Morris, Notre Dame will face tougher competition against the Bison. Notre Dame, ranked fifth in Lacrosse 
The Bison defense, which finished seventh in the NCAA in scoring defense last season, will face a huge challenge against the explosive Irish. Notre Dame returns virtually its entire offense from last year's NCAA Tournament team. 
"We're very strong on the offensive end and in the offen­sive midfield," Corrigan said.

Yeatman, the 2007 LaxPower rookie of the year, was 15th on the list. Yeatman was the only underclassman in the top 20 on the list. 
Senior Sean Dougherty, a preseason All-American selec­tion, was tabbed No. 35 on the list. Dougherty anchors the Notre Dame defense that held opponents to a team­record 6.66 goals per game last season. 
The last Irish teammate on the list was senior midfielder Michael Podgajny, who was ranked 37th. Podgajny was the only Notre Dame player to score a goal in every game last year. 
Corrigan said while the team has high expectations, players are focused on meet­ing daily goals in practice. 
"We want to take everything we're doing up a level, and do it on a daily basis," Corrigan said. 
The exhibition with the Bison will conclude the Irish preseason. Notre Dame's first game will be Feb. 16 against Loyola.

Brook Buck made sure the Irish would put some point'> up against their rivals and notched the first point with a 6-4, 6-2 victory over sophomore Tania Mahtani. 
The Irish, now in striking dis­tance at 2-1, entrusted No. 88 Hielley to come through over Taney. But the sophomore fell 6­4, 6-1 in straight sets.

Loud crowd distracts Hall, moves Irish to victory

ing his say. With 18 seconds left, the Notre Dame sopho­more stole a rebound from Providence forward Geoff McDermott and hit two free throws to send the game to overtime. 
In the extra period, the Irish jumped out to an early lead and held off a furious Friars run to extend its home win­ning streak to 32 games, 81­74. 
"We didn't want to lose, especially on our home court," Irish point guard Tory Jackson said. "If we could get it to overtime ... we thought we would win." 
Just seven minutes before Harangody's heroics, Notre Dame (15-4, 5-2 Big East) appeared to have the game in hand. They led 58-50 and jun­ior guard Kyle McAlarney had just brought the home crowd to its feet with a slashing layup. 
But that field goal was the last one the Irish would score in regulation. Providence went on an 11-1 run, capped by Xavier's shot with 1:08 remaining, to take the lead. 
With 18 seconds left, Notre Dame found junior guard Ryan Ayers for an open three that would have given the Irish the lead and probably the win. 
Ayers shot found nothing but iron, and McDermott grabbed the rebound. llarangody con-the second half, the crowd taunted him with repeated chants of "Airball" on all of his subsequent trips to the line. Hall made just 2-of-1 0 free throws in the game and missed four straight in overtime to help seal his team's fate. 
"He was just throwing up bricks," Irish forward Zach Hillesland said. "The fans were 
tinued to harass him, howev­er, and then somehow ended up with the ball. 
"I was just standing right there, and I don't know if he lost it or what, but it ended up in my hands," Harangody said. 
The Irish forward lent in for a layup and drew a foul, then nailed both free throws. 
"It was a pressure situa­tion," Harangody said. "I just had to have confidence." 
The Friars (12-8, 3-5) had one last possession. With time running down, McDermott tried to hold for the winning shot, but Irish point guard Tory Jackson stole the ball. With two seconds left, Jackson~ desperation heave caught front iron and the game headed to overtime. 
In the extra frame, Notre Dame jumped on top quickly, going on a 14-5 run capped by a runner in the lane from Jackson to take a 75-66 lead with just under two minutes remaining. 
Once again the Friars wouldn't go away. Guard Brian McKenzie nailed back­to-hack NBA-range 3-pointers to get his team within three ­but that was as close as Providence would get. 
Harangody led all scorers with 31 points for Notre Dame. He also pulled down 14 rebounds. 
Jackson, Ayers, and senior forward Rob Kurz were also in double figures for the Irish, with 14, 10, and 11 points respectively. 
Kurz played the last 12 min­utes of regulation and all of overtime with four fouls -but never fouled out. 
"When you've played a lot of basketball, you know how to play without getting a stupid silly foul," he said. 
Providence, who out­rebounded the Irish 48-38, including grabbing 22 off the offensive glass, was led by guard Dwain Williams, who had twenty points. McDermott, Xavier, and McKenzie each chipped in 10. 
Harangody scored the first eight points of the game for Notre Dame, who opened up a 18-6 lead with 13:46 left in the first half. 
Providence stormed back, going on a 15-3 run and tak­ing the lead 22-21 with 6:50 left in the half on a 3-pointer by Williams. 
Irish forward Zach Hillesland put the Irish back up by one with a jumper, but the Friars regained the lead on another 3-pointer, this time by guard Jeff Xavier. 
The Friars held the lead until the last possession of the first half, when McAlarney hit backcourt teammate Tory Jackson with a perfect pass for a layup to give Notre Dame a 32-31 lead going into the locker room. 
Notes: 
+As part of the Joyce Center's "Camo Night," cam­ouflage T-shirts were handed out to fans in the lower bowl. At halftime, sergeant first class John Adams was hon­ored for his service in Iraq and a video was shown detail­ing Brey's trip to Kuwait over the summer for Operation Hardwood.

+Before Thursday's contest, Notre Dame had not gone into overtime since March 20, 2006, an 87-84 loss at Michigan in the NIT. 
The game was the first over­time contest at the Joyce Center since an 85-82 Irish loss to Georgetown on Jan. 24, 2006. 
+The win kept Notre Dame alone in second place in the Big East, 1 112 games behind conference leader Georgetown.

great to keep calling out that 'Airball' chant during stop­pages of play for minutes on end,; That really helped us out. 
Besides the student section, the fan turnout seemed sparse at the outset of the contest. But as the game continued, the entire crowd at the arena began to energize the home squad. Most of the Notre Dame supporters stood for the dura­tion of overtime. 

"Our building, our fans really helped us tonight," Irish coach Mike Brey said. 
"There's where your home­court advantage kinda gets you the win tonight." 
Point guard Tory Jackson said the crowd was instrumen­tal in helping the Irish win their 32nd straight game at the Joyce Center. 
"I love our crowd even when they heckle some of our oppo­nents," Jackson said. 
"They kept me laughing; they kept me fresh."

ball to his teammates when Notre Dame needed it most. 
Forward Rob Kurz hit a three to begin overtime and Jackson made it possible with his dribble penetration and kickout. Later in overtime, with Notre Dame up two, Jackson stole the ball from Providence guard Dwain Williams, then found an open Ryan Ayers who drilled a 3­pointer. On Notre Dame's next two possessions, Jackson drove into the lane and found Harangody each time, allowing the Irish to take a seven-point lead. 
"I didn't feel like I had to make something happen, I felt like I could make something happen," Jackson said. "Once I got in the lane, I felt like I could drive because the big men kept coming up to get charges, so I felt like I could drop it off to the side and [Harangodyl was there three times in overtime." 
And when Providence guard Brian McKenzie decided he was going to drain two ridiculously­long 3-pointers to keep the Friars alive, it was Jackson who hit three of four free throws down the stretch to make sure Providence wouldn't return from the dead. 
And it was Jackson who sent the game into overtime by com­ing up with a key steal on Providence's last possession of regulation. The 5-foot-11 guard followed Providence forward Geoff McDermott around a screen, knocked the ball away and nearly made a 30-footer that would've ended the game. 
"I was sneaky. I'm thankful for being short right now," Jackson said of the steal. "He wouldn't of seen me if I was a big guy." 
Harangody's clutch free throws made Jackson's unsung heroics possible. The soft-spo­ken Harangody, who is a canQ.i­date for the Naismith award, turned into a creature pos­sessed out on the floor. For example, nine seconds into the second half, Harangody made a layup, was fouled, and subse­quently began throwing a few chest bumps into the air before fmally connecting with junior Zach Hillesland. But he would need to suppress that intensity at the free throw line, with the game hanging in the balance. 
Harangody pulled a Dwight 

. Schrute, the popular "Office" character who once claimed he could raise and lower his heart rate at will, and calmed himself enough to knock down the free throws. 
"I just had to stay poised, stay confident and concentrate," Harangody said. "It was just one of those times when you can't be as intense." 
For Irish coach Mike Brey, the play of Harangody and Jackson came as no surprise. 
"I thought our two sopho­mores would not let us lose the game," Brey said. "They made big plays at big times." 
The Irish found a way to win when one of their main scorers, McAlarney, had an off night. It wasn't just Jackson hitting the big shots either. Hillesland knocked down a few jumpers, Ayers finished with 10, includ­ing the big 3-pointer in over­time, and Kurz had another steady 11-point performance. 
But Jackson's outburst Thursday gave his team, and most importantly, Jackson him­self, the confidence that he can score a few baskets when his teammates struggle. 
That only means trouble for the rest of the Big East.

While the game won't count toward the CCIIA or even the overall record, the Irish hope to repay Team USA for the 7-2 thrashing it handed Notre Dame in the last meeting on Nov. 19, 2004. Though current Irish coach Jeff .Jackson wasn't around for that debacle, he and his team certainly want to avoid a similar fate tonight.

The Bearcats arc 10-10 overall, but have struggled with conference opponents ­thny are 1-7 in Big East play and, af'tnr bnating Georgetown on Jan. 8, have lost six straight to conference teams. 
Irish coach Muffet McGraw said every road game would be a "gnl11.t test" for Notre Dame. which will play three consecutive road games later this month. 
Hegardless of the opponent, McGraw feels the team has work to do. 
"We just have to get sharp­er," she said. "I feel like we've lost a little bit of our execu­tion." 
The Irish aren't too far from where they need to be. They are 16-5 (4-3 Big East) and recently beat Providence by 17 points. However, consecu­tive losses to DePaul and No. 1 Connecticut highlighted faults in the Irish defense. McGraw said improvements on defense come from varia­
