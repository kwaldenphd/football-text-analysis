STUDENT SENATE 

Group passes Domer Dollars resolution 
By KAITLYNN RIELY Assistant News Editor 
The Student Senate unani­mously passed a resolution Wednesday that asked the University to review the Domer Dollar card swipe systems on campus. 
The resolution -prepared by Residence Life chair Pat Knapp and Alumni Hall senator Danny Smith for his Campus Life Council (CLC) Student Concerns task force -identified occa­sional service interruptions in the card swiping system. 
The resolution said students should have access to a service for which they have already paid. To avoid problems with the wording of the resolution, Knapp said he has already _spo­ken with all the parties involved. 
"We structured it in such a way that we communicated with the CLC and the adminis­trators first and then went back and worked on the language on it and talked to pretty much everyone who would be effected -the stakeholders," Knapp said. 
The resolution asked that the Department of Food Services work with the Office of Information Technologies and the Vending Software Company to allot resources to make the card swipe systems reliably accept Domer Dollars. 
"We would like the adminis­tration to conduct a study or review, whatever you want to call it, to determine the best way to fix the system per [Vending Operations Manager] Dean Winter's and [Director of Food Services] David Prentkowski's recommenda­tions and then implement those recommendations," Knapp said. 
The resolution will be pre­sented to the CLC for approval

New passport laws affect spring breakers 
Students returning from Mexico, Caribbean will need to travel with additional documentation

Starting on Tuesday, the United States Department of Homeland Security began requiring air travelers re­entering the United States departing from cities in Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and Bermuda to carry a passport with them ­changes that will affect Notre Dame students who intend to travel to the involved coun­tries either for spring break or study abroad. 

It is the first of a two­pronged phase initiated by the 9/11 commission, titled the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) ­and will likely affect Spring Break travelers in March.

SMC gym improves security measures 
By MANDl STIRONE News Writer 
Students trying to lose extra post-holiday weight or stay in shape this semester may be happy to hear Saint Mary's Angela Athletic Facility implemented new rules to guarantee their safe­ty. 
Under the new rules, stu­dents will have to show their school identification at the door to enter the facilities ­an upgrade from previously nonexistent security meas­ures. 
Other changes include the addition of a second desk worker at the Angela's north 
door, which will be locked at 7 p.m. every night, Athletics Director Lynn Kachmarik said. 
Students seemed optimistic about the new procedures. 
"It makes more sense because anybody could walk in here," sophomore Kaela Hellmann said. 
Senior Michelle Lonnee agreed, noting that the lack of security in the past has opened the gym doors to peo­ple who don't belong there. 
"It's a good idea because a lot of random people come here to workout," she said. 
Kachmarik also said she hoped to get a scanner sys­tem in the future that would

"These new laws were implemented most likely because of increasing risks in air travel," said Kayle en Carr, leisure manager for Anthony Travel. "They were actually supposed to begin last year, but the airlines kept postponing the dates because of the potential 
effect they could have on tourism in Mexico and [the] Caribbean." 
Because the National Passport Processing Center in New Orleans will most likely be receiving an influx in applications owing to the new laws, Mary Kowalksi, vice president of travel serv­ices at Anthony Travel, rec­ommended that these stu­

Brey addresses decision 
McAlamey suspension saddens hoops coach 
By BOB GRIFFIN 
News Writer 

Two days after Notre Dame suspended sophomore basket­ball player Kyle McAlarney, the University had not released official information, although head coach Mike Brey commented on the situa­tion after the team's 71-68 loss to St. John's Tuesday. 
Breywho spoke McAiarney about his developing bond with McAlarney as the season pro­gressed -said he was devas­tated when informed of the Office of Residence Life and Housing's decision to suspend the guard for the spring and summer semesters. "I love Kyle McAlarney," Brey told the New York Post follow­ing Tuesday's game. "He's real­ly like a son to me and I miss him. To say that wasn't a dag­ger to all of us would be an understatement." McAlarney was arrested in the early morning hours of Dec. 29 on marijuana possession charges. Janice McAlarney, Kyle's mother, said Brey and Athletic Director Kevin White

Newspaper readership thrives 
By MANDl STIRONE News Writer 
Newspaper readership pro­grams implemented last year at Notre Dame and three years ago at Saint Mary's have proved successful ­even gaining momentum over time -say student govern­ment representatives and stu­dents. 
Through the College Readership Program, copies of national newspapers are made available for free on both campuses every week­day. Students, faculty and staff can peruse The New York Times, The Chicago Tribune, USA Today -and, at Saint Mary's, the South Bend Tribune as well.

INSIDE CoLUMN 
The joy of rocks 
Rocks are everywhere. There is no doubting that, nor do I think anyone would. However, like some friend who is always around eating your food, I think rocks are unappreciated. Think about it -if that 
friend was to leave, you may have more food, but something would still be missing. 
Well, that metaphor may have fallen short, 

but the point Dustin Mennella remains. Rocks, or naturally occur­
ring aggregates of Photo Editor minerals by defini­
tion, have played an important role in the history of the world up to this 
point. In fact, the Earth itself could be viewed as a large compilation of solid and molten rock (without which we would be as homeless as hobo Joe). 
And hey, the Stone Age? Without rocks, what would cavemen have used to invent tools? But moving on, this isn't about the past-there are plenty of rocks around to appreciate today. You could be walking along the road and come across a felsic Rhyolite (an igneous type), or perhaps even a nice metamorphic Gneiss, who knows? 
For as long as I can remember I have always enjoyed climbing, and I would climb anything really. Trees were major targets, but jungle gyms, cars and even houses as I got older were all summited in turn. As we grow older though, different things are expected of us, and alas my tree climb­ing days are now very few and far between. 
However, I recently discovered the Rockne Memorial contains a rock climbing room -"climbing on rocks?" I thought. Sure, I don't see why not! I tried rock climbing out for size, and with it rediscovered my joy of climb­ing. I found the challenge of traversing an inclined face, or completing a cer­tain climbing route entertaining, and also a good way to keep in shape. 
But I digress, back to rocks. As of now I have only climbed in man-made gyms, but I hope to climb actual rocks in the future. Perhaps a nice sandstone wall or granite boulder would be nice, I'm not really sure what rock-types are good for climbing. By the way, did you know that from an engineering per­spective, rocks larger than three inch­es in diameter are classified as boul­ders? 
New Mexico. Just one word away from traditional Mexico, which is also the traditional Spring Break destina­tion. However, for my Spring Break, I signed up for a geologic field trip into the Bandelier Mountains of New Mexico for some true rock apprecia­tion. Carlsbad Caverns is also on the itinerary, where the nation's deepest limestone cave exists within a Permian-age fossilized reef. Needless to say, I am already excited. 
Perhaps next year I should plan to study the black sand beaches and Basalt lava-flows of Hawaii for spring break ...

Scientists can't get sloth to move 
JENA, Germany Scientists in the eastern German city of Jena said Wednesday they have finally given up after three years of failed attempts to entice a sloth into budging as part of an experiment in animal movement. 
The sloth, named Mats, was remanded to a zoo after consistently refusing to climb up and then back down a pole, as part of an experiment conducted by scientists at the University of Jena's Institute of Systematic Zoology and Evolutionary Biology.

president Lizzi Shappell said she considers the program a complete success, hearing nothing but positive feedback since its August start. 
Notre Dame's fledgling pro­gram has a consumption rate of about 90 percent, she said. 
In fact, it has been so popu­lar while coming in under­budget that a sixth newspaper distribution center was added, making daily papers available in Hesburgh Library, South and North Dining Halls, LaFortune and a location for off-campus students in C lot. 
Senior Chris Harris, coordi­nator of the Readership Program at Notre Dame, agreed with Shappell's analy­sis. 
"I haven't heard one bad thing about it from anyone taking part in the program," Harris said. 
He said he has received no complaints about the program

Feb. 5. 
Since the resolution was passed with little debate, most of the meeting was spent on committee reports and Senate administrative business. 
Student body president Lizzi Shappell, vice president Bill Andrichik and chief executive assistant Liz Brown said they are preparing their report to the Board of Trustees next Thursday. The report will focus on four main areas -the upcoming community summit, the eating disorders confer­ence, alumni-student relations initiatives and follow-up on the status of the College Readership Program, Shappell said. 
Siegfried senator Jim Lockwood asked Shappell whether the program could provide more New York Times papers and fewer editions of The Chicago Tribune and USA Today. Lockwood also asked about the possibility of adding The South Bend Tribune to the program. Shappell said she would consider these sugges­tions. 
"We wanted to do a full year of the College Readership Program as it is and then we will reevaluate it," she said. 
Gender Issues chair Ashley Weiss said right now it's "crunch time" for her commit­tee's work on the eating disor­ders conference that will take place Feb. 8-10. Her committee is now working on advertising and finalizing the paperwork for the event, she said. 
Andrichik asked the senators to remind people that, although the conference is free for Notre Dame students, they should still register on the Center for Continuing Education's Web site. 
Minority Affairs committee chair Destinee DeLemos said she is working with the College of Arts and Letters to explore the creation of a Native American studies minor. 
Since Dillon Hall senator Tyler Langdon left this semes­ter to study abroad, the CLC lost one of its Senate liaisons. Lockwood was elected as the new liaison and Pasquerilla East senator Emily Cooperstein was selected as the alternate.

from the· student body, and noted that the 90 percent con­sumption rate is only an aver­age. 
He added that students have even been stepping up and recycling. 
"I think the students realize they have a civic duty to recy­cle, and if they don't, USA Today takes recycled papers collected at the end of the day anyway," he said. 
Saint Mary's is also seeing similar levels of success with its College Readership Program, which began during the 2003-04 school year. Unlike with Notre Dame's pro­gram, students must swipe their ID cards at boxes on campus to access the newspa­pers for free. 
The Chicago Tribune was added to the mix -along with the locked boxes -at the beginning of this academ­ic year, as the budget for the program was increased from $7,500 to $13,000 per year. 
Saint Mary's student body president Susan Mcllduff said 2005 was the first year the program was not limited to the spring semester; before then, it was about half the size of the current program. 
Originally, there were only two distribution sites -the Student Center and LeMans Hall -but locations at the library and Madeleva were added this year, she said. 
"When Kellye Mitros and I were elected as student body president and vice president 
© 2007 ERNST & YOUNG U.P 
[for 2005-06], we decided to offer the program for the entire academic year, Mcllduff said. 
During the past year, Mcllduff and current student body -vice president Maggie Siefert worked to add The Chicago Tribune to the pro­gram to cater to the many students from the Chicago area. 
Mcllduff said she thinks the "students benefit greatly from the papers." 
"They're always gone by mid-day," she said. "Also, I have noticed that more pro­fessors are assigning current event journals relating to the course's subject matter." 
·Students at both schools generally seem to approve of 
the program. 

Notre Dame senior Walter Machnicki said he particularly likes The New York Times ­that program's most popular publication. 
"I like that they have The New York Times instead of just grabbing The Chicago Tribune for my non-Observer news," he said. 
Likewise, Saint Mary's soph­omore Beth Alexander also enjoys the opportunity to read a national newspaper. 
"A lot of us are so busy that we don't have time to watch the news on TV with the newspapers we can read at leisure," Alexander said.

Israeli president faces rape charge 
JERUSALEM -Israeli President Moshe Katsav, facing charges of rape and abuse of power, asked parliament Wednesday to tem­porarily remove him from office in an effort to blunt growing calls for his resignation, including one from the prime minister. 
At a stormy, emotional news conference at his official residence, Katsav blamed Israeli media for his plight, using terms like "witch hunt." "McCarthyism" and "persecution." He shouted at a local TV reporter, pounding on the podium and gesturing angrily during a rambling diatribe that lasted nearly an hour. 
The president has been under intense pressure to quit since Attorney-General Meni Mazuz notified him Tuesday that he planned to indict him after a monthslong investiga­tion into allegations by four women who worked for him. The charges include rape, abuse of power and sexual assault.

Pentagon criticizes Bush's plan 
Sending more troops to Iraq may hinder quick response to crisis at home 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON President Bush's troop buildup in Iraq and the demands of the four-year­old war are causing con­cern at the Pentagon that the conflict could hamper the military:s response to domestic crises. 
The head of the National Guard said Wednesday his troops lack the necessary equipment and that will hurt their ability to respond to natural or manmade dis­asters at home. 
"I am not as comfortable as some others seem to be in accepting the low readi­ness levels here at home," Lt. Gen. Steven Blum said. "It creates a problem. It will cost us time and time will translate into lives." 
Adm. Timothy Keating, commander of U.S. Northern Command, also said there may be "specific equipment shortfalls that, in the longer term, could have an impact on our abil­ity to respond." 
Keating also said that right now, "the analysis we've done does not indi­cate any significant degra­dation in our ability to respond" to a crisis at home. 

Their comments came as opposition grew in Congress to President Bush's plan to send more than 21,000 mandant of the Marine they train for the mission, equipment in Iraq. additional troops to Iraq in Corps, told the House but would have it as they "Units that have returned the coming months.

dents act soon to insure they receive their documents on time. 
"We have been seeing more people coming in and asking about new passport applica­tions," Kowalski said. "It used to take four to six weeks to process a passport; now, it will probably take up to eight weeks." 
Sophomore Nicole Bernal, who's traveling to Baja, Calif. for Spring Break, wasted no time in submitting her docu­ments. 
"I noticed my passport had expired before Christmas, and because I'm also travel­ing to Rome for the architec­ture program junior year, people told me I should get my passport renewed fast," she said. "I sent off every­thing a week before Christmas break, and it took almost six weeks before I got it back." 
The experts at Anthony Travel recommend that even students who are going on cruises or driving across borders should still pay attention to the laws and insure that they have a renewed passport to carry with them in case of an emergency. 
"We're planning a lot of student spring break travel, including a cruise to Mexico, Belize and the Bahamas," Carr said. "Though the cruise doesn't require a passport, if there is an emer­gency and somebody people had to fly home, they won't be able to re-enter easily without one." 
According to the U.S. Department of State, stu­dents who most recently renewed their passports at the age of 15 and below are only covered for five years before expiration, and will have to reapply for a new one for a fee of $97. However. students who last renewed their passports after the age of 16 only have to renew their passports each decade for a fee of $6 7. 
Moreover, if somebody needs to expedite their pass­port renewal with a guaran­tee to receive it back after processing within three weeks, it will cost them an extra $60, plus roughly $30 to send it via express mail. 
Fortunately, the Notre Dame post office is now accepting passport applica­tions and is equipped with all the necessary resources to help students with inter­national travel, so they don't have to go to the trouble of visiting the passport agency downtown. 
"We are an authorized passport acceptance agency, and we check to make sure that all of the· paperwork is correct before forwarding them to the National Passport Processing Center," said Ellen Bystrom, postmas­ter at the Notre Dame Post Office. "We also can take photos on site, and we rec­ommend students make appointments between class­es, but we also accept watk­ins." 
The Notre Dame Postal Office charges a $30 process­ing fee, and an extra $15 for photos. Customers seeking passport photos may not wear hats or headgear obscuring the hairline, nor dark or nonprescription glasses with tinted lenses. 
Additionally, students will have to bring along with their application proof of cit­izenship, either using a pre­vious passport or a certified copy of their birth certifi­cate, a government issued photo ID such as a driver's license or military ID and two checks or money orders -one to send to the Department of State and one for postal fe.es. 
"It was fairly busy back in December, even though it's only a fifteen-minute proce­dure," Bernal said. ''I'm relieved that I got it sooner, so I suggest that students get an appointment soon. They ask numerous questions 
including citizenship, place of birth, where you are going and why you are traveling there." 
Anthony Travel projects that over 75 percent of its Notre Dame customers have valid passports for travel, but should always be aware of changes to the border patrol regulations and have contingency plans in ease something goes awry during their journeys. 
"It's always best to chnck with your travel profession­al," Kowalski said, "and that's why we're here for the Notre Dame community."

IN BRIEF 
McDonald's quarterly profit doubles 
CHICAGO -McDonald's Corp., the world's largest fast-food chain, said Wednesday that its fourth-quarter profit more than doubled, thanks in large part to the spinoff of a burrito chain and strong sales in Europe. 
The earnings were" in line with prelimi­nary results released last week but the stock slipped after some analysts said operating profits were below their expecta­tions. 
The restaurant company earned $1.2 bil­lion, or $1 a share, in the quarter ending Dec. 31. That was up from $608.5 million, or 48 cents a share, during the same peri­od last year. 
McDonald's revenue climbed 11 percent to $5.6 billion, from $5.01 billion during the year-ago period. 
Even without the gain from the spinoff of its Chipotle chain, McDonald's said income from continuing operations climbed to $761.2 million, a 26 percent increase from $604.8 million last year. 
Home Depot CEO earns small salary 
ATLANTA -The Home Depot Inc. is pay­ing new Chief Executive Frank Blake a fraction of what it paid his predecessor, Bob Nardelli, and has taken the unusual step of promising Blake no severance pack­age if he leaves. 
But executive compensation experts don't expect the decision announced Wednesday by the world's largest home improvement store chain to set a trend in corporate America, despite the ire that hefty salaries have drawn among investors. 
"I wish it were a trend," said Lowell Peterson, a New York labor attorney who is familiar with executive compensation issues. "I suspect it's unique to Home Depot because the pay and severance package given to Nardelli was so out of line." 
Atlanta-based Home Depot said in a regu­latory filing that Blake could earn as much as $8.9 million in total compensation this year. 
That's a fraction of the $25. 7 million a year on average that Nardelli was earning at Home Depot excluding stock options.

Congress halts minimum wage bill 
Lawmakers cite tax break attachment as reasons for delay in Washington 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The 

minimum wage increase 
that was supposed to zip 
through Congress veered 
onto a collision course 

Wednesday as lawmakers 
argued over business tax 
breaks that would be 
attached to ensure 
Republican support. 

Democratic leaders in the House began laying ground­work to blame the Republicans for any impasse. Senate Democrats, however, cautioned their House colleagues not to jeopardize legislation they'd promised to approve if they gained control of Congress. 
House Democrats 
demanded a clean bill from 
the Senate-no tax attach­

The Senate did vote 54-43 
to advance a House-passed 
measure that would lift the 
pay floor without any 
accompanying tax cut. 
However, that was well 
short of the 60 votes needed 
to keep that version moving. 

The vote was a signal to the House that without the tax breaks a minimum wage bill appeared doomed in the Senate.

Toilet paper is an immensely valu­able creation, without which we'd be relegated to using newsprint, our left hand, or perhaps even discarded sheep's wool (like those in the Viking age of England did) to unsoil ourselves in the lavatory. 
While toilet paper is typically used to clean messes, any high school kid could tell you that it can also be used to make messes ­messes of hate, that is. 
After all, the jun­iors bate the sen­iors. The soccer players hate the football players. The cheerleaders hate the pom-pom squad. 
And how do they manifest this hate? By thrusting roll after roll of Charmin onto t~eir enemy's trees. 
The ensuing mess often enrages lawn maintenance-freak fathers and some­times even prompts principals to hold school-wide assemblies in which they threaten to disband the football team if the "toilet paper vigilantes" persist. 
But toilet paper isn't the only good thing in America that can be used in a bad way. The list even extends beyond eggs, shaving cream or any other of the array of household items thai teenage angst teaches high-schoolers to abuse. 
In fact, what perhaps tops the should-be-a-good-thing-but-can-cause­trouble list is not actually a thing at all. Yet it leads to hate and fuels a desire in some not only to damage property, but to damage lives. 
What is it, you ask? Believe it or not -American Pride. 
American Pride can be beautiful ­when we resound in chords of "God Bless America," when we fly American

flags from our front porches and when 
we plop ourselves on lawn chairs on a 
muggy July night, waiting for the pop 
of the Independence Day fireworks. 
But other Americans take this Pride 
too far. They plop themselves on lawn 
chairs in the stifling Arizona desert, 
day after day waiting for wanna-be 
immigrants to cross the American bor­
der. These Americans might see fire­
works too -fireworks made by the 
shotguns some choose to carry. 
Many of these "border vigilantes" 
profess to be part of a group that 
describes itself as "a citizens' 
Neighborhood Watch on our border." 
They call themselves "The Minuteman 
Project." 
The Minutemen? Most Americans 
know about the original Minutemen ­
that rag-tag bunch of Revolutionary 
War-era New Englanders who pledged 
to be ready to toil with the Redcoats at 
a mere "moment's notice." History has 
everafter heralded them as heroes. 
But the modern-day Minutemen? 
Heroes? Hardly. 
"We are a nation of immigrants." 
President George W. Bush spoke these 
words over and over again in the 
spring of 2006. But do most of ioday's 
pride-filled Americans even under­
stand what thai means? 
It seems as though the only American 
history many know of is that of the 
white Lexington and Concord 
Minutemen, who thrust America into a 
War of Independence, after which the 
nation expanded tenfold as a result of 
a so-called "God-ordained" Manifest 
Destiny. This led prideful Americans to 
believe they had the right to enslave 
the blacks and exterminate the Native 'Americans as they marched across the 
continent. 
But in the late 19th and early 20th 
centuries, many of our white ancestors 
were not marching across a continent; instead, they were sailing across an ocean. They didn't enter America at Roanoke, Jamestown, Plymouth Rock or any of the other historically roman­ticized "ports of entry." Instead, they landed in America cramped and crowded at Ellis Island. 
And they were hated. The Protestants hated the Catholics. The Germans hated the Irish. And everyone hated the Italians. 
And how did they manifest this hate? By killing one another -sometimes even with hatchets. 
But by and large, we don't see riot­rousing hate between these groups anymore. Americans of varying degrees of whiteness co-exist in the same neighborhoods and even marry one another without thinking twice about it. 
While sneaking across the American border is certainly illegal (as is toilet­papering trees, I might add), that does­n't mean that you, as an ordinary pride-filled American, should sit at the border with a shotgun. True, the immi­gration debate is a complex issue, but need we further soil the debate by turning it into another mess of hate? 
After all, being a modern-day Minuteman doesn't make you a hero; instead, it makes you like one of those pathetic people who remain frozen in the high school world long after gradu­ation. 
Toliei paper shouldn't make a mess. And American pride shouldn't make you a bigot.

IEWPOINT 
.-------:---c--------­
Thursday, January 25, 2007 
The first weeks of the beginning of the second semester are always marked by three special dates and occasions, all of which point toward different aspects of unity and solidarity. 
The first celebration is when the Catholic Richard V. Church celebrates a Warner, CSC World Day of Peace. 
FaithPoint

The Catholic under­standing of peace is that it is both a gift from God but a human work as well. And as each new year begins, at least recently, more wars are raging, more innocent victims are dying every day, many of the members of our armed forces are in harm's way and continuous streams of refugees and suffering people could fill the headlines every day ifsuch tragedies had not become so commonplace among us. I am always encouraged to see student organizations who take up the causes of peoples who suffer as a result of wars and struggles. And as the years have passed, the work of the Kroc Institute has become 
Seeking solidarity 
very significant and made its mark as one of the outstanding academic programs and institutes in the United States. Every Friday, the 5:15p.m. Mass is celebrated in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart to pray for peace. In the face of such human suffering, it may seem fruitless to spend 30 minutes in prayer. But in the face of such human suffering and injustice, we do let our prayers and voices rise for our brothers and sisters and ask the Lord to continue to raise up among us people who will pursue peace with justice for all God's people. 
The second celebration in January is the national holiday honoring the work of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. On our own cam­pus, University President Emeritus Father Theodore Hesburgh is always interviewed when this day is celebrated because of the contributions he made as chairman of the Civil Rights Commission when the land­mark law which King promoted and died for ended years of segregation and racial intolerance, creating a solid legal basis on which to begin what remains a long and difficult struggle in our country and other countries around the world. One of the members of our staff, Chandra Johnson, is one of the outstanding campus ministers in our country with innovative and significant programs which enable us to participate in the important work of cross-cultural min­istry. 
Finally, the Catholic Church celebrates the Octave of Church Unity during the third week in January. The prayer of Jesus is that all Christians may one day be united, and significant work in ecumenical and inter-religious dialogue has taken place for the past four years since the closing of the Second Vatican Council. The preface for the Masses during the Octave state beautifully what we pray for and seek during these days. "Through Christ you bring us to the knowledge of your truth, that we may be united by one faith and one Baptism to be His body. Through Christ you have given the Holy Spirit to all peoples. How wonder­ful are the works of the Spirit revealed in so many gifts! Yet how marvelous is the 
page 9 

unity the Spirit creates from their diversity, as He dwells in the hearts of your children filling the whole Church with His presence and guiding it with His wisdom!" While sig­nificant work in ecumenical and inter-reli­gious dialogue takes place through mem­bers of our Department of Theology and in the Tantur Ecumenical Institute in Jerusalem, another member of our staff, Priscilla Wong, offers Prayer From Around the World in different Christian, Muslim, Hindu and Jewish traditions. 
It is important for us to promote solidari­ty in all of these for us and others as well. As we begin a new year, it is also important for us to be reminded of these three ele­ments of human solidarity.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
McAlarney suspension justified 
In the article regarding Kyle McAlarney's suspension for two semesters (Jan. 24, actions that are taken by our family members make headlines internationally. We 'University suspends McAlarney'), I find the statements by his mother to be a bit are scrutinized far more than any other school I have ever seen. Therefore, it is of disturbing. All Notre Dame students-athlete or not-are given a thorough high importance that such matters be addressed by the University in an appropri­description of du Lac. Each student is given an orientation of du Lac and knows ate manner and whether the individual or his parents agree with the decision, it is what the rules at Our Lady's University are and what is expected of each individual. the consequence to the action. In this case, the University is handling the situation You may argue the point that in your opinion the punishment may not fit the crime, with the individual and dealing with someone who broke the rules of du Lac. I but that decision is for University officials to make. Stating that the University is understand how difficult this must be for the individual and his family; however, the using this individual to make an example out of is ridiculous. The University did not University should not be targeted for doing its job. make the error in judgment to possess the substance, the individual did.

Suspension w-as overkill 
It is often said that college is a microcosm of the real world. If that were that case, then Kyle McAlarney would have been back playing against Georgetown or Tank Johnson would have been placed on death row. For those of you on the University judicial board, please -gain some perspective. An overwhelming amount of illegal underage drinking is allowed in each resi­dence hall every weekend, yet one student is suspended an entire semester for having maru­juana in his car. As I remember the stories, a past student was booted from his residence hall for being in Pasquerilla West Hall at 12:30 a.m. studying on a Monday, yet another student throwing around sexist remarks directly at a female rector got a "firm talking-to ..."Either there is a serious consistency problem, or the administrators guiding the process are seriously screwed up in the head. I vote for both. Meanwhile, there's one point guard who has seven more months to learn a lesson that I am sure he already understands, while a good chunk of the current Notre Dame student body will break the law tomorrow night in Dillon Hall. 
HapaDima Los Angeles Jan. 24 

After reading of the University's decicison to dismiss Kyle McAlarney from Notre Dame in this morning's South Bend Tribune, I shared the news with a fellow Michiana resident who also has very close ties to the University. (Two of our parents were employed at Notre Dame for about 25 years). I thought I would share his thoughts when I relayed the message of the decision to dismiss Kyle. "Actually, I am quite relieved. I was afraid they were going to have him stoned to death in front of Sacred Heart Chapel. Whoever made this decision needs to look deep into their Christian heart and see exactly what was the motivation behind this decision. I doubt it is anything Jesus would be proud of. What has happened to mercy and forgiveness? If they believe that Notre Dame as an institution has anything to offer, to better the Christian character of their students and help them make good choices, then why would they send Kyle away from that environment and cast him out? I think this decision is flat-out wrong and reflects very poorly on the University." I think his comments are well stated, not to mention true and appropriate. 
Todd Maher Granger Jan. 24 
I just read on NDNation.com that Kyle McAlarney was sus­pended from school. Please tell me this isn't true. Frankly, it's embarrasing. The punishment certainly doesn't match the misdemeanor. Has the University gotten so caught up in its conservative self-righteousness that it's now making an example of one of its more visible members? I hope not. Suspension from the basketball team for the remainder of the year is much more fitting. McAlarney's smoking mari­juana does affect his stamina and does hurt the team. It should not be tolerated. McAlarney's smoking marijuana does not hurt the Notre Dame community. It may offend some of the community's more conservative members. However, let's not confuse smoking marijuana with murder or rape -or invading countries that pose no threat to you. As importantly, we should look to the past as a means to move forward. In my four years at Notre Dame, a number of kids were caught smoking marijuana. None of them were suspended from school. All of them received some form of discipline. However, none of these punishments were as dra­conian as academic suspension. Now would be a great time for University President Father John Jenkins to intervene in the name of common sense. Clearly, common sense went hugely wanting at McAlarney's disciplinary review.

Student Film Festival returns for 18th year 
Thirteen movies demonstrate the admirable talent of student filmmakers 
By ANALISE LIPARI and ERIN MCGINN Assistant Scene Editors 
Annually, the Notre Dame Student Film Festival allows student filmmakers a chance to exhibit their dramatic, humor­ous and occasionally off-kilter work to the University and general public. This is the 18th year for the festival, which has come a long way since its original incep­tion in the basement of what is now McKenna Hall. 
"I think there were about seventy-five people who showed up," said Film, Television and Theater professor Ted Mandell. "The students put the show together and just about any film that they could get their hands on was in the show." 
Over the years the film festival grew bigger and kept moving to larger loca­tions, reaching its final home in the Browning Cinema in 2004. 
All of the films shown at the Film Festival were created in production courses within the Film, Television and Theatre (FTT) department. 
"They are projects done for class, just like a research paper in history, except that many of them are seen by an audi­ence of 1200 or more." Mandell said. "I believe the quality of filmmaking has improved every year. This year's batch of films, overall, are really well done."

Festival will play host to 13 differ­ent and diverse selections from students within the FTT department. 
"I think students will be surprised at the quality of filmmaking and surprised at the topics undertaken," Mandell said. "Many of the thirteen films are made to convey a strong message or tackle tough subjects in thought provoking ways. Others are just plain enjoyable, plus there's a surprise star who pops in too." 
In light of the recent debate over the presence of "The Vagina Monologues" on campus, one film of interest for students may be "Loyal Daughters," a film by Molly Miner, Kathleen Kudia and Monica Engel that profiles the cast of Notre Dame's last production of the Eve Ensler 


Even the simplest of scenes takes extensive planning in order to film. The students shown here are filming a scene for Jean Milan and Rama Gottumukkala's film "My Rapist." 
tics often left the town's residents disgruntled and protesting. Whether viewed as an expose on small-town politics or a charac­ter study in power and its affect on the human ego, "Welcome to Snyderville" takes a different and intriguing approach to the com­munity right outside the bound­aries of Notre Dame. 
Another film that takes a dif­ferent angle on a familiar subject at the University, vocation to the priesthood, is Emily Andreas' and Rin Westcott's "Stained Glass Ceiling." Through interviews and alternated voice-overs, the film chronicles one devout woman's desire to be ordained as a Catholic priest, questioning the audience's and Church's opinions on the subject in a subtle and compelling way. 
The most literary film is that of Trevor Park and Pacifico Soldati's black-and-white "Adaptation," literally an adapta­
tion of the short story "Theft" by Depression-era writer Katherine Anne Porter. It tells the story of a

play. In the context of the heated discus­sions that took place in recent memory, as well as last fall's student-produced work of the same name, "Loyal Daughters" will inevitably be an afl"ecting look at a controver­sial and timely sub­

The film alludes to the issue of breaking the silence about the victimiza­tion of these women, and in turn asks the audience to examine its own views and sensitivities as well as the consequences of remaining silent. 
A third film to tackle deeper issues of personal identity and the complexity of societal pressure is "Flipped," by Lisa Goepfrich, Brandon Kusz and Fabian Farias. In a somewhat "reversed" envi­ronment, "Flipped" envisions a high school where the majority of the students and teachers are gay, and a young het­erosexual student named Nick struggles with hiding his sexuality.

By RAMA GOTTUMUKKALA 
Scene Critic 
As a bomb explodes dangerously close to Theo, he grimaces with pain and covers his ears, trying to blot out the excruciating tinny sound that accompanies the blast. But he can't and neither can we, as direc­tor Alfonso Cuar6n allows that awful sound to linger for a full minute after the fact. 
"You hear that ringing in your ears?" Julian (Julianne Moore), Theo's ex-wife, asks him after another such explosion. "That's your ear cells dying. You'll never be able to hear that frequency again. Enjoy it while you can." 
Children of Men 


Director: Alfonso Cuar6n Writers: Alfonso Cuar6n and Timothy J. Sexton Starring: Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, Michael Caine and Claire-Hope Ashitey 
These horrific sights and sounds pepper the landscape of "Children of Men," a film that offers a frightening vision of how far a world -perhaps even ours -could plum­met toward chaos. Marked by violence and desolation, it's a dark reality that threatens to shatter the most brittle of humanity's commodities -hope. 
In 2027, mankind is gasping its last breath, struggling in a world where pro­creation is a distant memory. After all, if women can't have babies anymore, what else is there to hope for? Indeed, hope seems the most important word in the film as these characters have so little of it. 
A former peace activist, Theo (Clive Owen) is resigned to civilization's inevitable fate. But when Julian enlists Theo's help, he is faced with guarding a miracle. He is charged with safely transporting Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey), a young, pregnant black girl, to the scientists of The Human Project. If Kee and her baby live, so too might the rest of humanity. 
The promotional material behind "Children of Men" almost shouts a single question: "Why are women infertile?" Cuar6n argues that the answer doesn't matter, and his movie never offers a solu­tion to this seemingly central question. Women stopped having babies 18 years before the opening credits roll. And by the time the end credits roll, that question has gone unanswered. 
Instead, what the film does so brilliantly is take us on one man's odyssey to restore hope to a world that severely lacks it. Far from a traditional high-concept film, view­ers are thrown headlong into the second act. It's an atypical choice that allows Cuar6n more time to play in a world that is painstakingly realized. 
Nowhere is this more apparent than the film's Academy Award-nominated cine­matography. The camera employed by Cuar6n to tell this story is as unstable as the world around it. In one breathtaking segment, we're thrown headlong into the rubble of a refugee camp. As the angry hiss of machine gun fire, tanks and explo­sions rock the scenery, Theo scrambles to find Kee in a shot that continues unbroken for nine minutes. Debris falls all around and blood spatters onto the camera sur­face in an exhausting, masterful segment that mirrors the peril of Theo's journey. 
It's easy to forget how often Owen has been in front of the camera in the last few years. Since his first major role as a sniper in 2002's "The Bourne Identity," Owen has had memorable turns in "Sin City," "Closer" and "Inside Man." But here, he is at his very best. He has to portray a fragile character, someone dangerously close to the edge of a precipice that much of mankind has already fallen over. As the heart and soul of the picture, Owen domi­nates every scene he's in, which helps because he's in so many of them. 
Hope is one of the two most eagerly sought commodities in cinema, the other being redemption. Characters find hope and lose it all the time. But with "Children of Men," Cuar6n tortures his characters by continually holding it an arm's length away, seemingly impossible to reach. He keeps it from them for so long, without offering a clear reason why, that when we glimpse it near the film's end, we fmally understand what made Theo suffer after it in the first place.

CUARON 'S lATEST DEMONSTRATES HIS POTENTIAL 
By BRIAN DOXTADER 
Scene Editor 
Alfonso Cuaron's "Children of Men" starts out as a complex rumination on soci­ety, but ultimately reveals itself as a glori­fied chase film. Ultimately, the visceral impact of "Children of Men" punches the gut more than it picks the brain, but as a "thinking man's thriller," it has few peers. 
The film is set in London in 2027 in a world in which women are no longer able to have children. In its opening scene, the audience is informed that 18 year-old "Baby Diego," the youngest person alive, has just been killed. Theo Faron (Clive Owen), an office worker with a checkered past as a protestor, discovers Kee (Claire­Hope Ashitey), a girl who has become pregnant. Working with an activist group led by his ex-wife Julian (Julianne Moore) called The Fish, Faron tries to bring Kee to a boat that contains the so-called "Human Project" in order to save the human race. 
In terms of sheer craftsmanship, "Children of Men" is nearly flawless. 
Cuaron's previous work includes both artsy independent films ("Y Tu Mama Tambien") and Hollywood blockbusters ("Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"), but "Children of Men" is his most accom­plished film to date. The hand-held cam­eras and "cinema veritae" documentary style is at first jolting, but becomes increas­ingly immersive as the film wears on. Cuaron's camera is constantly moving, one of the director's trademarks, but rarely without purpose. Many of the war scenes are so perfectly choreographed that they resemble a musical more than a chaotic thriller. 
The performances are solid throughout, but nobody outside of Owen is really given a chance to fully explore his/her character. In particular, Moore's fiery, sensitive turn as Julian would have benefited from more screen time. Michael Caine has a show­stealing turn as the hippy-ish Jasper Palmer, and Danny Huston has a memo­rable cameo that recalls Joe Turkel's dia­bolical Eldon Tyrell from "Blade Runner." 
"Children of Men" is set in the future, but it's not a futuristic film. In fact, its deliber­ate resemblance to modern day is unset­tling, but effective, evoking a "1984"-esque vibe without over-reliance on typical sci-fi trappings. In fact, the most spectacular special effects are during the technically complex war sequences, which resemble "Saving Private" more than they do "Star Wars." 
"Children of Men" has a lot to say about a lot of social issues ranging from immigra­tion to religion, but its approach is not quite comprehensive or clear enough. There are many unanswered questions, and while that might be deliberate, it mud­dles many of the film's themes. In ways, it feels like an incomplete picture, and prob­ably could have benefited from another 20 minutes or so in order to slow down and more fully explore its intriguing premise. As it stands, it plows through its two hours with bulldozing force that leaves the view­er stunned and exhausted. 
Some of the questions the film raises (why can women no longer have children?) are irrelevant, but others (why is Kee able to get pregnant?) would clarify the plot and give the film a better thematic anchor. Kee 
Children of Men 

herself is held at an odd distance, and the audience is never given a chance to really understand her, or understand why she is so important to the human race. 
"Children of Men" is a very good film, but it's far from perfect. Its technical accom­plishments and visceral approach to intel­lectual material is unique, but audiences are inclined to leave the theater with more questions. Cuaron has proven himself a great director, but he has yet to make a truly great film. "Children of Men" is his best to date, but it's easy to wonder if there's a "Director's Cut" already waiting in the wings. Most films falter from being too long. "Children of Men" is one of the precious few that suffers from being too short.

NFL 

-
Associated Press 
NEW YORK-The NFL is 
going deeper into the wal­
lets of players who get 
caught using steroids and 
other performance-enhanc­
ing drugs. 
After four months of 
sometimes intense negotia­
tions, the league and union 
announced Wednesday 
more extensive testing for 
performance-enhancing 
drugs and the addition of 
the blood-boosting sub­
stance EPO to its list of 
banned substances. 
The union also agreed 
that players suspended 
after testing positive will, 
for the first time, forfeit a portion of their signing bonuses in addition to the salary they will lose during their time away. That is sig­nificant because the signing bonuses often are the only guaranteed portion of a player's salary and can be larger than salaries, which sometimes are kept artifi­cially low to keep the team under the salary cap. 

"It is important that the NFL and its players contin­ue to be leaders on the issue of illegal and danger­ous performance-enhanc­ing drugs in sports," NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said. ''These latest improvements will help ensure that we continue to have a strong and effective program. As we have done in the past, we will review and modify the policy on an ongoing basis." 
In addition to the new test for EPO, the agreement includes an increase from seven to 10 of the number of players on each team randomly tested each week during the season for steroids and other perform­ance-enhancing drugs. That means there will be 12,000 tests each season, up from the current 10,000. 
The new policy will make the NFL the only North American sports league to regularly test for EPO. Urine will be tested, not blood, for EPO. Baseball did a round of urine testing for EPO in 2005. Rob Manfred, MLB's executive vice president for labor relations, said Wednesday there were no positives among the 500 samples tested. 
Baseball conducts urine tests of major and minor league players for perform­ance-enhancing drugs and stimulants, with each play­er tested at least twice ran­domly per year. Baseball does not conduct blood tests and does not test for EPO or human growth hor­mone. Baseball and its players union have agreed they will test for HGH if a urine test for that drug is validated. 
IN BRIEF 

Weir tries for fourth 
straight U.S. title 

SPOKANE, Wash. -For a three­time national champion, Johnny Weir makes a pretty good underdog. 
Weir is going for his fourth straight title at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships this week, a run that would put him on par with the likes of Brian Boitano and Scott Hamilton. But figure skating is all about 'what have you done for me lately,' and the guy making the noise these days is Evan Lysacek. 
"Being an underdog coming in is natural," Weir said Wednesday. ''I'm not always going to be invincible, I'm not always going to be top dog. Evan Lysacek has had a great season. I'm going to fight as hard as I can to be the four-time national champion. 
"All the chatter...is just talk and is not something I take very seriously," Weir added. "It doesn't change the way I'm prepared for this competi­tion." 
Ford ends its Champ Car 
series sponsorship 
DEARBORN, Mich. -Ford Motor Co. said Wednesday it has withdrawn as an official Champ Car World Series sponsor. 
Ford had participated in Indianapolis-based Champ Car and its predecessor, CART, since re-entering open-wheel racing in 1992, first pro­viding engines and then sponsorship. 
"We evaluate all of our racing pro­grams on an annual basis and have decided that this sponsorship does not align with our current business objec­tives," said Dan Davis, director of Ford Racing Technology. 
Davis said Ford's withdrawal from Champ Car will not affect the other racing programs the company sup­ports, including NASCAR's three major national touring series, the NHRA PowerAde Drag Racing .Series, the Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car and KONI Challenge Series, as well as sev­eral U.S. Auto Club-sanctioned series. 
Dungy pl.a.ns on making 
career decision after season 
INDIANAPOLIS-Colts Coach Tony Dungy will wait until the end of this season before considering his future with the team. 
Dungy signed a contract extension last year that would keep him in Indianapolis through 2009. But many have wondered whether the 51-year­old coach, who had said previously he intended to retire at age 50, might resign if he wins the Super BowL 
"That's something I've not thought a whole lot about," he said Wednesday. ''I'll sit down with (owner) Jim (lrsay) and my wife at the end of the year. The first thing you have to do is make sure you're still wanted back. I never take that for granted any more." 
Dungy made a similar statement after last season when the Colts were eliminated from the playoffs in a 21­18 loss at home to eventual Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh.

AUSTRALIAN OPEN 

Gonzalez prevails over second-ranked Nadal 
Williams, Sharapova advance on women's side of the bracket 
Associated Press 
MELBOURNE, Australia ­Rafael Nadal limped out of the Australian Open complaining his leg was too sore to chal­lenge Fernando Gonzalez in the quarterfinals. With Gonzalez stinging winners past him from both the forehand and back­hand sides, though, even a fit Nadal might have struggled. 
The lOth-seeded Gonzalez had 41 winners in a 6-2, 6-4, 6­3 upset over the second-seeded Nadal on Wednesday, earning him a semifinal spot along with top-ranked Roger Federer, Andy Roddick and Tommy Haas. 
In the women's semifinals later Wednesday, the unseeded Serena Williams was to contin­ue her unlikely quest for an eighth Grand Slam title. Limited to only four tournaments last year by recurring knee prob­lems, Williams was not expect­ed to be a serious contender at this year's Australian Open. 
But she was one win away from the final, as was top-seed­ed Maria Sharapova -who reached the semis with a 7-6 (5), 7-5 win over Anna Chakvetadze, a fellow 19-year­old Russian. 
Williams was to face 17 -year­old Nicole Vaidisova of the Czech Republic in the first semifinal, followed by Sharapova against fourth-seed­ed Kim Clijsters. 
Gonzalez, who will be playing in the semifinals of a Grand Slam tournament for the first time, will get a day off to watch Thursday's semifinal between defending champion Federer and sixth-seeded Roddick. Gonzalez will face Tommy Haas on Friday. 
French Open champion Nadal was the only player to beat Federer at this stage of a tour­nament last year, doing it four times in finals. Federer was 91­1 against everyone else -his only other loss an upset to Andy Murray at Cincinnati. 
It was a five-setter against Murray on Monday that Nadal thinks derailed his prospects of making the Australian Open fmal. 
"I can't run a lot," he said Wednesday. "It was difficult to play one match like this, quar­terfinals of one Grand Slam, with pain. If I am playing bad, well, you can go home and say disappointing. But today I just say, 'Well, I can't do more. I try my best."' 
He called for a medical time­out in the third set and had to go to the locker room to remove his long, green shorts for treat­ment on his upper left leg and buttock. 
Roddick is only 1-12 against Federer, but the 24-year-old American had match points against Federer at the Masters Cup. last November and beat him in the fmal of an exhibition tournament at Kooyong on Jan. 14. 
Gonzalez was hardly a con­tender until he beat local favorite Lleyton Hewitt in the . third round and fifth-seeded James Blake in the fourth. The 26-year-old Chilean won 12 of 15 matches to end 2006 and made three finals -losing two to Federer. 

He always had a powerful forehand but was too erratic with it, often criticized for swinging and missing too many times on big points. But since starting work last year with Larry Stefanki, who coached John McEnroe and helped Marcelo Hios and Yevgeny Kafelnikov reach No. 1, Gonzalez has been improving. 
"I used to just hit, hit, hit, and maybe I win the point -now I have other strategies," he said. "I am playing great tennis. I can do great things in my game." 
Gonzalez broke Nadal's serve twice in the first set, in the opening game of the second and twice again in the third, and only faced three break points. He had support from a scatter­ing of Chilean supporters wrapped in flags and chanting in Spanish. 
And he had growing support from the local crowd. Early in the third set, a man yelled: "You're the man, speedy." 
Clijsters reached the women's semis by defeating Martina Hingis 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 on Wednesday. Hingis' comeback run from three years in retire­ment ended last year in a quar­terfinal loss to Clijsters, who also beat her in the same stage at the French Open. 
"It's great playing her and everything, but I don't want to see her in the quarterfinals ever again," said Hingis, who won three titles here and figured in six straight finals through 2002. 
Clijsters· has reached the semis in every trip she's made to Australia since 2002, and has bowed out to the eventual champion every time -losing three times in the semis and dropping the 2004 final to Justine Henin-Hardenne.

steals per game, almost an entire steal more than Connecticut, who ranks second in that eatego­ry in the Big East at 11.06. 
One standout performer in the last three games in regards to turnovers has been freshman guard Melissa Lechlitner. In the past three games, Lechlitner has only one turnover, coming against Marquette Tuesday. Over that same stretch, the freshman has notched 18 assists, including a career high nine against Syracuse. 
"I think we're making better decisions," McGraw said. "I don't think we're forcing things, l think we're taking more shots rather than trying to force a turnover." 
The other key factor in Notre Dame's success this season has been free throw shooting. The exceptional free throw rate has not only helped the Irish main­tain their leads or shrink those of their opponents, it has in fact saved two important road wins. 

Notre Dame's wins against Michigan on Dec. 1 and Valparaiso Dec. 19 were each the result of last-minute free throws. 
Against the Wolverines, guard Tulyah Gaines sank the go-ahead points with four seconds to play before guard Charel Allen iced the win at 61-58 with two more foul shots in the final seconds. 
At Valparaiso, Breona Gray sank one of her two free throws in the final second to give the Irish a 60-59 win to add to their NCAA Tournament resume. 
Even though limiting turnovers and making free throws are important aspects of winning, McGraw understands that her team needs to do more if it hopes to succefld in the remainder of its Big East schfldulfl. 
"We don't talk about [turnovers at practice] at all, and we don't talk about the free throws, and those are two things we're doing well," she said. "1 think I might just shut up about everything and see if we get good at some­thing else," she said.

Henley said. 
Henley said the Scots played a "triangle-and-two" defense in which two players played man-to-man while the other three were in zone coverage. The two man-to-man defend­ers matched up with Kessler and senior point guard Bridget Lipke and were sue­cessful in reducing their con­tribution. 

Saint Mary's bench scored only two points in Saturday's 84-72 win over Adrian but the reserves came up big on Wednesday. In total, the Belles bench contributed 19 points to the cause and fresh­man guard Patty Duffy dropped 15 points in 21 min­utes of play. 
"We needed another shooter and Patty gave us a momen­tum swing," Henley said. "She hit some tough shots from outside." 
Duffy, who has been plagued by ankle injuries, was 3-of-6 from behind the arc and was able to take pressure off of Kessler and Lipke. 
Henley also mentioned free throw shooting as a key to Saint Mary's success. The Belles made 82 percent of their free throws and Kessler was 6-of-6 from the charity stripe.

a solid defender and an effective ball handler, averaging barely a turnover per game, but oppo­nents know he isn't a threat to score. 
With the scoring from the point guard position down sig­nificantly, Notre Dame's other players will have to pick up the slack. 
First and foremost, Irish lead­ing scorer senior Russell Carter will have to take his game to even higher heights. Carter showed he is capable of taking over games after his 32-point outburst against St. John's Tuesday. That's not necessarily good news, however. The Irish lost to the Red Storm 71-68 because they were too reliant­on Carter offensively. 
Furthermore, a major offen­sive strength of this team has been its balance. For most of the season, other teams have had to respect the ability of most of the Irish team to score if left open. Even without McAlarney, the Irish cannot panic and get into a pass-to­Russell-and-stand-around offense that will be too easy to defend. 

Senior guard Colin Falls will be one of the players whose play will be crucial to take the pressure of Carter. Without McAlarney, Falls is Notre Dame's only major outside shooting threat. As such, teams will be more focused on denying him the ball outside three-point arc most the time. Despite this, the Irish need to get Falls the ball, whether it be through the senior's hustle or a designed play from Brey. 
The best way to get defenders to give Falls and Carter space on the outside is to make oppo­nents respect the scoring ability of Notre Dame's inside players. 
Sophomore forward Zach Hillesland has shown potential to pick up the scoring slack in however, and he is 

only averaging 5.6 points per game so far. If the Irish want to reach their goals despite losing their point guard, they need Hillesland to use his athletic ability to get to the bas­ket more often. 
For Notre Dame's more tradi­tional post players -junior Rob Kurz, sophomore Luke Zeller and freshman Luke Harangody -the absence of McAlarney has meant, and will continue to mean, a greater reliance on them to score and rebound. Without McAlarney's outside shooting presence, the Irish getting the ball into the post has been both harder and more important, and more missed outside shots have meant more offensive rebounds. 
So far, Kurz and Harangody have both stepped up to the challenge at various times, but have not always been consis­tent. 
Zeller has seen reduced play­ing time due to his struggles with back-to-the-basket oll'ense. His shooting ability does add a different dimension, however, and Brey may start to usc him in the future to draw larger defenders away from the basket to open up driving lanes for Carter and Jackson. 
McAlarney was an important cog in Notre Dame's machine, but without him the Irish are still a special group. It will take maturity from younger players thrown into action and hard work from players learning new roles, but, even without its orig­inal starting point guard, Notre Dame can still accomplish its goals this season.

jobs. That's what everyone else says because they want to put words in your mouth. The bot­tom line is when you "re unhealthy, you're unhealthy, do you something about it." 
In his autobiography, No Excuses, however. Weis had a less confrontational tone. 
"I said, 'Look at that fat ass,' " Weis wrote in No Excuses. "I wish I had been looking at someone else. Unfortunatelv, that fat ass was me." · 
Weis has insisted that the surgery was not an attempt to increase his chance at getting a head coaching job. At the time of the surgery, Weis was considered one of the top offensive coordinators in the NFL but weighed around 350 pounds. 
Weis' case is going to trial more than two years after a Massachusetts review board decided he had enough evi­dence to go forward with the lawsuit.

Weis' malpractice case set to begin 
Irish coach fell into a coma following 2002 gastric bypass surgery 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Editor 
Notre Dame coach Charlie Weis' lawsuit against the two doctors who performed his gastric bypass weight-loss surgery in 2002 has been scheduled to begin in court Feb. 12. 
Brian Hardin, director of football media relations, said Weis was recruiting away from campus and unavailable for comment Wednesday. Hardin said Weis likely would not comment on the lawsuit in the future. 
In the days following the surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital, Weis suf­fered from internal bleeding. He went in for a second sur­gery and fell into a coma for two weeks. 
In the lawsuit, Weis alleges that physicians Charles M. Ferguson and Richard A. 

Hodin failed to meet the prop­er standard of care. The Boston Globe reported that New England Patriots quar­terback Tom Brady, who Weis has said was a frequent guest at his house and help with his kids after the surgery, will be a key witness in the case. 
Weis' lawsuit claims that as a result of the surgery, Weis suffers from limited move­ment in his legs and feet and continues to experience signif­icant pain. 
Weis has said repeatedly in the past that his father's death from a heart attack at age 56 was a primary factor in his decision to have the high-risk surgery. 
"You want to know why you do it? Because for 10 years you're over 300 pounds and your father died at 56 of a second heart attack," We is said at the press conference introducing him as Notre Dame's coach in 2004. "You're afraid if you stay at the same level, you're going to drop dead. That's why you do it. It has nothing to with getting

Irish cut down on turnovers 
ByJAY FITZPATRICK Sports Writer 
Despite falling to Marquette 71-62 Tuesday night, the Irish still sit in the top half of the Big East standings, due in part to their ability to limit turnovers and sink free throws. 
Notre Dame is the best free­throw shooting team in the con­ference at 77.8 percent and sec­ond only to South Florida in turnover margin at plus-3.84 turnovers per game. 
"We're not trying to do too much. I think we're playing within ourselves and I think that's why we're not turning the ball over," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. 
In 19 games this season, the Irish have committed 330 turnovers, but have limited that number to 10 against St. John's Jan. 16, 11 against Syracuse Saturday, and only 12 against the Golden Eagles. Accompanying this low turnover rate has been Notre Dame's abil­ity to steal the ball effective. Notre Dame averages 11.95

Belles top Alina for road win 
By DAN COOPER Sports Writer 

Saint Mary's traveled to Alma Wednesday night and returned home with a victory after defeating the Alma Scots 66-58. 
The win lifts the Belles record to 7-10 overall (6-4 MIAA), while the Scots drop to 7-9 (3-6 MIAA), respective­ly. 
It was a close game throughout and the Belles took a narrow 37-36 lead into halftime. In the second half, the Belles took control and pulled away by outscoring the Scots 29-22. 
Alma's defense was tough, holding junior guard Allison Kessler to 11 points -eight points off her season average -on just 2-of-9 shooting.

Sophomore point guard Kyle McAlarney has been suspend­ed for the semester and will not play again for the 2007 Irish. 
That news has been out for a cou­ple of days now and McAlarney is headed home to ponder his future. 

But what about the future of the team? No. 21/22 Notre Dame is still in the hunt for an NCAA Tournament bid and possibly even a Big East title. However, without McAlarney, several Irish players will have to adjust to new roles.
