A bust of Notre Dame football great Knute Rockne was confiscated from Irish basketball center Tim Kempton, after the breakup of several post-dance parties at the Americana Hotel Saturday night. 
Three Notre Dame students were arrested for violating state liquor laws (related story, below). Many other students were asked by hotel security officers to leave the hotel, after hotel guests complained to the management about noise. 
Most students had attended the formal sponsored by Lyons, Badin and Keenan halls in the Century Center that night. 
Kempton was stopped by a South Bend police officer when he got off the elevator in the hotel lobby. The officer called Notre Dame security, who came to the Americana. Kempton said he was holding the bust for a friend, Dave Robinson, a senior from St. Edward's Hall. 
"I was up in the room that the bust was in," said Kempton. "When they broke up the party, I was bringing it down to the car." 
Kempton claims he "never had possession" ofthe bust, and was only c~rying it for Robinson. "I have no idea where the bust came from," he said. "I had nothing to do with it." 
University Security Director Glenn Terry said Robinson, a manager of the basketball team, told 
bust from a storage room in the ACC. When contacted by The Observer, Robinson refused to com­
ment~ 

Kempton and Robinson were both questioned by security officers and police, but neither was arrested. Terry said Kempton told Officer Eugene Eyster of the South Bend Police Department that "he was with someone else, who said he had permission to have it." 
Terry said he was unsure of how and an investigation is underway. 
The bust of Rockne is hollow, weighs approximately 75 pounds, and is about two feet tall. Its worth is estimated at 5500. 
When reached for comment at the NCAA Final Four in Lexington, Ky., Notre Dame Basketball Coach Dig­ger Phelps refused to comment. 
Both Kempton and Robinson are being referred to John Goldrick, as­sociate vice president for residence life.

The Reagan administrationsaid yesterday that Japan has made "new commitments on trade issues," but officials indicated there is still no agreement on efforts to persuade the japanese to open their markets to U.S. goods. On Capitol Hill, mean· while, angry legislators were preparing legislation that would impose quotas and tariffs on Japanese products coming into the United States if Japan does not lower trade barriers. President Reagan met at the White House with two envoys he sent to Tokyo over the weekend in a last-ditch attempt to prod Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and other officials into making trade concessions. Last year, japan sent the United States nearly S37 bil· lion more in goods than it imported, and some members ofCongress are criticizing the administration for not doing enough to end the imbalance. ·AP

MTV promised top concert, but who is Tommy Shaw? 
Saturday, the winner of the Millions for MS competi· tion will be announced, and Notre Dame, with an average contribution of 53.29 per student, has a good shot at first place and a free MTV concert. 
But, should Notre Dame win, Madonna won't be dan· cing toward the Golden Dome. And the Boss won't be performing at the ACC. 
The school raising the most money per student in the Millions against MS campaign will be blessed with a free MTV concert by · drumroll please· Tommy Shaw. 
Tommy Shaw, you remember him? He used to play guitar for Styx? 
Well, at least the concert's free. 
When the Millions against MS campaign began, the organizers of the event and the student body in turn were led to believe that the winning school would receive a free MTV concert by a major performer. Ac· cording to Bill Healy, a member of the campaign com· mittee, "we were promised a top five act." 
The winning school will 
receive a free MTV concert, as promised. That concert, however, is one that many 
students  would  term  
mediocre at best.  
Students  entered  the  

competition thinking they were vying for some "dream concert." One widely eire· ulated rumor indicated that the winning school could choose any act to perform at their campus. free. 
MTV never promised the concert of the winner's choice as a grand prize. Nor did they specifically prom· ise Bruce Springsteen or Madonna. In fact, they never 
really promised anything, but allowed the competition to continue for weeks without announcing the prize. 
They captured our interest with talk ofa first-rate act, and only when the campaign was drawing to a close did they tell us what we were competing for. 
Should Notre Dame win the competition, many stu· dents will be disappointed and understandably so. We'll feel like children who were promised bicycles for Christmas and ended up with socks and T-shirts. We'll probably recover from the disappointment, but next year we won't be quite so quick to put our trust in Santa Claus (or MTV). 
MTV was wrong to ask us to compete for an un· specified performer. They should have made the condi· tions of the contest cl<:ar from the onset. Notre Dame, however, has much to be proud of. 
Whether or not Notre Dame wins the competition, the campaign here has brought in more than 520,000 to help eliminate Multiple Sclerosis. A great concert

would be nice, but we all know that's not the point. The purpose ofthe drive was to raise money to fight MS, and in that we suceeded. 
Anyone who has ever seen a television commercial knows the contest was a well-planned tool to inspire us to raise money to fight MS. Contest organizers pitted Notre Dame against a dozen or so rival universities and baited us with promises ofa great concert. 
It worked. Students seemed more than willing to at· tend the various events, and whether their intent was to help win a concert, help 
fight MS, or just have a good time, the reasons for par· ticipating seem somewhat irrevelant. 
Students participated in the events to receive a free concert, which we may or may not win, and indeed, few students probably care to win. They also partici· pated to help fight MS. 
Should Notre Dame take first place in the contest, the fact that we were able to join together in fighting MS will 
almost  certainly  over·  
shadow  the  thrill  of  a  
Tommy  Shaw  concert.  

Those students who attend 
the concert will probably go only because it's free or because it's being filmed by MTV. 
So why not give up a concert that no one much cares about in order to further the real purpose behind the campaign? Why not give up the concert, should Ne win, and donate the money to help fight MS? 
Such a move would make two definite statements. First, we could demonstrate our dedication as a student body to eliminating Multiple Sclerosis. Secondly, we could very effectively express our dissatisfaction with MTV. 
Notre Dame has already done well in its fight against MS. Saturday's announcement of the winning school could give us an opportunity to do even more.

Plagiarism exists, but not severe, claim ND/SMC administrators 

By MARKS. PANKOWSKI 
CopyEditor 
Plagiarism. It is defined as the of­fering of another's work as one's own, and it is a problem at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. To what ex­tent it is a problem, however, remains uncertain. 
"There's probably as much plagiarism at Notre Dame as in other universities," said Michael Loux, dean of the College of Arts and Let­ters at Notre Dame. "My guess is that there is some cheating, less than most would claim. It's tough to get statistics though." 
"I have caught it and many of my friends have caught it," said Thomas Bonnell, assistant professor in Saint Mary's English department. "I wouldn't attempt to venture a guess as to how widespread it is, however. There's no way ofknowing." 
Judging from the number of re­ported cases to administrators, plagiarism does not seem to be a sig­nificant problem at either Notre Dame or Saint Mary's. 
"In the last two to three years we've had about six to seven cases in the freshman writing program," noted Edward Kline, chairman ofthe Notre Dame English department and director of the freshmen writing program. "In three years that I've been chairman ofthe English depart­ment, we've had nothing." 
"I think (plagiarism) happens at all schools, certainly at Saint Mary's," said Susan Vanek. freshman aca­demic counselor at Saint Mary's. "I haven't seen many cases, so perhaps it's not a big problem. I do occasion­

ally  run  into  it,  but  it's  not  
prevalent."  
Plagiarism,  however,  may  be  

more widespread than the number of reported cases seems to indicate. 
According to du Lac, ifa teacher at Notre Dame determines that a stu­dent has plagiarized an assignment, the teacher must take the matter to the Honesty Committee ofhis or her department. Nevertheless, some in­structors choose not to go through this potentially long process, and thus the plagiarism goes unreported. 
"I have a feeling that many profes­sors don't want to deal with the Honesty Committee procedure," said Michael Francis, chairman of the government deparment at Notre Dame. "Professors prefer to settle the matter on their own, which I think is the best way, unless the stu­dent wants to take it to the Honesty Committee." 
At Saint Mary's, although many teachers do inform the freshman academic counselor or the dean of academic affairs when they discover plagiarism, they are not required to do so. 
Instructors who settle the matter on their own-most often do so be­cause they believe that plagiarism is a private matter between student and teacher. They feel they can punish the student adequately with­out involving the administration, thereby allowing the student to be punished without having the inci­dent go on the student's file. 
Instructors also may not report a case ofplagiarism if they believe the student simply forgot to document a source or was unaware ofwhat con­stitutes plagiarism. 
Several steps have been taken by Notre Dame and Saint Mary's in or­der to curb the incidence of plagiarism. Teachers, for example, are encouraged to explain to their students what constitutes plagiarism and what the punishment is for the offense. In addition, some professors employ a different approach to solve the problem. 
"When looking up references, stu­dents tend to plagiarize," said Robert Lordi, English professor at Notre Dame. "If I give complete freedom on assignments outside of class, I have a tendency to find plagiarism. I now give my students assignments that don't require them to depend on outside sources. That usually eliminates the possibilities of plagiarism." 
Despite their best efforts to curb the problem, in the end, teachers must rely somewhat on students' in­tegrity not to plagiarize. 
"Individual teachers take the issue seriously, and I hope students take it seriously as a result of the teachers' talking to them about it," said Loux. "I would hope that this being a Cath­olic university and students' being aware of plagiarism, that they wouldn't violate honest practices."

Carrying banners proclaiming peaceful inten­tions, a group of marchers dance in the funeral 
New statue to arrive from Italy after Easter 
By LYNNE R. STRAND 
News Staff 
A new Carrara marble statue of Brother Andre, the Holy Cross brot­her beatified by Pope John Paul II in May 1982, has been completed and will arrive at Notre Dame from Italy soon after Easter. 
Often called "the Miracle Man of Montreal," Brother Andre is credited with curing thousands of sick people through the intercession of St. Joseph, patron saint of Canada. Brother Andre is currently the only member of the Holy Cross order who is beatified and a candidate for sainthood. 
Although Brother Andre stood five feet four inches, the statue stands six feet tall. When looking at the statue, said Father Anthony person" he knew of, and Raffo's studio was the home of the same Carrara crystal-tinged marble as Mastrovic's "Pieta." 
Brother Andre was a man of "absolute, simple faith," Jenky said. "He told people they would be cured, and it happened. Andre al­ways said, 'I do not cure; St. joseph cures.' He was a believer in the power of prayer. Brother Andre was like St. Joseph, a working man, not highly educated." 
Born Alfred Besset in St. Gregoire d'Iberville, Brother Andre was a peasant and a realist. Because of his ill health, he was unable to profess priestly vows. He acted as porter at Notre Dame College, a novitiate and school for boys in Montreal, Canada. The school was located on Mount Royal, where Brother Andre built St. Joseph's Basilica, Canada's national shrine. As porter, he heard of the sick and visited them. The cures began to occur when Brother Andre was in his thirties, and were re­ported to be frequent and spon­taneous. 
Father Andre Leveille, director of vocations at Moreau Seminary, is also from the Montreal area and was at the St. Joseph Shrine on Mount Royal last fall when the Pope visited. "It shows what importance Brother Andre has when this is the one shrine the Pope kneeled at, along with 3,000 priests, when he was visiting Canada," said Leveille. 
Leveille was a priest and semi­narian at the shrine. He saw people in "absolute despair, people who are crippled or with cancer." Although Leveille said he never saw a miracle credited to Brother Andre, he has seen people "healed inside." 
Brother Andre often said, "people who suffer have something to offer to the good God. Do not seek to be spared trials, ask instead for the grace tobear them well." 
Brother Andre visited Notre Dame in the 1930s for a Holy Cross chapter meeting.

The statue was enlarged by Giovanna Raffo studio artists. The studio, located in Pietrasanta, Italy, is also the origin of the Carrara marble in Ivan Mastrovic's "Pieta," which currently stands in a Sacred Heart side chapel. Lauck's statue of Brother Andre will be placed next to the "Pieta." 
Lauck is not a newcomer to Notre Dame art. One of his most famous works is the statue of "Our Lady, Notre Dame" at the main circle. He began work on the statue ofBrother Andre a year and a half ago at the re­quest of University President Father Theodore Hesburgh and Father Daniel )enky, rector of Sacred Heart Church. 
For approximately four months, Lauck worked on the three foot original ofthe statue. He chose Raffo because he was "the most reliable

Plan is not a good deal 
Last night, the current student senators passed a new constitution two days after the new senators were to have replaced them. 
Hurdling last minute objections, the senate sent the proposal to the Hall Presidents' Council for approval. If the HPC concurs with the senate, a radically newconstitution will take effect for the coming student government term. Elections would be held for dorm senators. Then on April 15, the newly elected senators would join Bill Healy, student body president-elect, to form the 1985-86 student government. 
The new constitution provides for 2 5 senators and a framework of two standing com­mittees and three ad-hoc committees. 
The class officers, three HPC representatives, judicial coordinator, student activities board manager, student body treasurer and freshman advisory council president would no longer be voting members of the senate. 
The president would have veto power, but the senate could override his veto with a two-thirds vote. The vice president would be a voting member of the senate and the president would have the tie-breaking vote. 
According to the proposed structure, the Student Activities Board would almost be an extension of the president's cabinet. The SAB manager would be appointed by the stu­dent body president and would become an executive coordinator. All executive coordin­ators would need senate confirmation before holding office. 
The proposal has its merits. The senators would be more accountable to their constituents because they would reside at the same location. The committee structure would give the senators specific duties to perform within the committees. 
The judicial coordinator should not have a vote on the senate. He should be a checkon their power, not a participant in their politics. The HPC, with fewer political concerns, could concentrate on Notre Dame's social activities. It would rightly focus itself on dorm life. The president, with his veto threat, would have the potential to be a more imposing figure. This would give the president the power to lead. 
Unfortunately, the drawbacks overshadow the merits. Four weeks ago, the idea of restructuring was on the backburner. Now, less than 25 days later, student leaders have emerged with what they think is a panacea for government, but what is more likely a Pandora's box. 
The restructured senate of 26 voting members, counting the student body vice presi­dent, would not be much larger than the current 17-member senate. The present senate, however, really only has five senators whose sole function is to represent their districts. The remaining senate members serve only in a secondary capacity and their interests are limited to the institutions they represent. The proposal calls for 25 senators who would have equal interest in every issue. This would create a logjam oflegislative chaos. 
Having senators represent their dorms will better define their interests, but perhaps too much so. Currently, senators have to worry how an issue affects various segments of the campus. They represent a significant segment of the campus. With the new constitu­tion, senators would represent only the self-interest oftheir dorms. They would have no reason to reach outside their narrow interests. 
Also, the student body would be misrepresented because each dorm would have one senator regardless ofits size. 
Removing the class officers as voting members eliminates a channel for class sentiment to be expressed. Most senators would be upperclassmen whose interests tend to be different from those of younger students, especially freshmen who depend heavily upon campus activities. 
The Student Activities Board, under the new plan, loses much ofits independence. The SAB manager would be appointed by the president, who also would control the SAB's purse strings because the president would head the finance committee. That would be too much control over the activities board. 
While the need to restructure student government is apparent to almost everyone, The Observer strongly questions both the means and the methods student government has taken so far to achieve this goal. In light of the above objections, the leaders of student government should cease all further action upon the proposed new constitution and open the matter to extensive campus discussion. 
The Bertino administration and the present senators should step aside and let those whom the students elected take office. Once this has occurred, the restructuring can take place in an orderly manner with the present officials serving in advisory positions. 
If this does not occur and the proposal takes effect, the Student Senate will not have dealt student government new cards, but merely reshuffled the same stacked deck-with a few jokers added.

Growing accustomed to life at ND takes stamina 
1n the latter part of August of last year, I boarded a train and headed offto Notre Dame for my first semester as a college student. For the longest time, I, like many others had dreamed about life under the Golden Dome. I had heard of all of the fantastic traditions and effervescent spirit that this University boasted and now I was ready to live in this world called Notre Dame. 
When I arrived with my family, I was almost beside myselfwith excitement. The train ride from New Orleans hadbeen trying on my anx­ious nerves, and the car ride from Chicago's

to the point 
Union Station seemed to take an eternity. I think that I could have qualified as the perfect six year old with my incessant "are we there yet?" How could I not be excited? I was headed for the place that would be my home for the next four years. I wanted to see my new world. 
The image of the Dome as I first saw it still stands out clearly in my mind today. The sun­light reflected off of it radiantly, and I knew that Notre Dame would be all that I had im­agined it to be. I can remember my thoughts at that time vividly. The people who were sitting in the front seat of the rent-a-car represented an old world, one that I was ready to forget. For my entire life I had been tied down in a controlled environment that I thought I did not care for. I was ready to get out and bask in the independent life that college was going to offer. Notre Dame was going to set me free. 
I cannot say that I have been disappointed with the independence that life under the Dome has offered me. Even though the admin­istration does exercise a good deal of con­straint over the students, being a thousand miles from home has been independence enough for me. I found that Notre Dame did offer me a new life, a new world. The problem was that as time here wore on and the new­ness wore off, I was not so sure if I wanted to forget the old world that I had left down South. 
living in the world under the Dome is not as easy as I thought it would be when I first arrived here. I had had dreams of a place where nothing ever went wrong, and where everyone was friendly and willing to sacrifice themselves for each other. In my mind, I had created a utopian society and I thought that life here would be unparalleled by life in any other part ofthe country. 
When the month ofOctober rolled around, something started to happen to me that was completely unexpected. I began to feel the first yearnings for my home town. I wanted to see my mother and father and all of my high

school buddies again. I wanted to escape this world of clandestine alchoholic parties and return to a place where the drinking age is still 18 and bars welcome the patronage ofcollege underclassmen. As reluctant as I am to admit it to anyone, I was beginning to feel homesick. I wanted to go home. 
Obviously, I stuck it out. I began to write a few more letters to my friends and looked for­ward to Sundaywhen I would have the chance to call my family. This all helped me get through the times when my inner call to return to the sunbelt was the strongest. I must say that winter was the hardest thing for me to get through. I admit that the snowy months were a welcome change from the 18 years that I had spent enduring 80 degree winters, but February in South Bend can be quite depressing. 
My homesickness seemed to appearfully on those terribly gloomy days we experienced this past winter. Walking to class at 7:50 in the morning and seeing the gray that appeared to be the only color that God would allow to ex­ist on this campus, I could only think about how wrong all the stories were that I heard before I came here. The snow on the ground looked like a crusty layer rather than a fluffy blanket, and the Dome was eclipsed by the mucky fog that always surrounded it. Why did I want to be here? I thought that in coming here I had made the biggest mistake ofmylife. 
Now, after a fantastic spring break and a visit from my parents, life under the Dome does not seem as bad as it did during those depressing times. Like most freshmen, I was suffering from a mild case of culture shock. Here I was, an 18 year old kid, thrown into a world 1000 miles from home with people that I had never met before in my life. I did not really think that the people here were goingto talk differently than I or not understand the culture from whence I came. I guess I found out that life here is not utopian, but simply as enjoyable as one wishes to make it. 
The reason I decided to write this column is that I felt those yearnings for home recently. But this time, something was different. The pains I felt were not as biting, and an airy con· versation with a new friend allowed me to for­get that I ever lived any place else but Notre Dame. Now that my time as a freshman is com· ing to a close, I have apparently come to grips with my new world. I have made friends from all parts of the country and even from some foreign lands. I have become accustomed to all that daily life under the Dome entails and have grown to love it for real. But no matter how comfortable I become in this environ· ment, I know that there is something in my heart that will never let my feelings for my old world cease.

orm rooms-big or small, Mor­rissey or Pasquerilla West, love 'em or hate 'em-they are as much a part ofcollege life as Chern 11 5. Our "homes away from home" are rarely what we expect them to be. Whether a freshman with an as­signed room, or a junior with the "choice" quad, they somehow don't compare to a Fifth A venue apart­ment. 
Must students do the "usual" decorating to salvage the atmo­sphere as best we can: touch up the paint on the walls, buy some second-hand carpet, and fill the room with "borrowed" milk crates. We bring our stereos and some photos and maybe even a throw pillow or two. But it's still just a dorm room. 
Unless creativity intervenes-and a look around campus will certainly show that creativity abounds here 
under the Dome. 
The "Howard Penthouse," better known as room 421, is the unique creation ofroommates Mark Huber, Bob Lee, Jim Chmiel, and Carl Gebo. 'Ibis three-room quad is also referred to as the "social hub of Howard Hall." 'Ibe guys were lucky in the respect that Chmiel, a junior,. received the Number I room pick. But from there, it was nothing but hard work. 
'Ibe four arrived at Notre Dame nine days early this school year, along with Bob's dad from Gales­burg, Illinois. The five started by sanding and painting the walls and refinishing the woodwork. It seems, thou¢1, that with all of this hard work, some things were left out. lbere is not a visible desk, sink, or bed in any ofthe three rooms.

The lack ofdesks is easily ex­plained: the atmosphere of the room doesn't lend itself to studying. But sinks and beds? A closer look shows the sinks concealed behind carefully constructed tables and a lV console. The tables move, allow­ing the guys to brush their teeth, and then return to hide the sink. 
The hiding beds make up the most interesting aspect of the rooms. In the bedroom, a fake floor was constructed. The floorboards are on hinges which lift up in an almost "coffin" fashion to expose the mattresses. With the floor­boards down, the beds are virtually invisible. 
The details with which the room was finished are exquisite. The hardware necessary for these details, as well as the lumber for the beds and console, cost the roommates close to S 1 ,000. Why all this work and money? "We like luxury. We're college yuppies," they replied. 
All four are juniors and had planned on keeping their room next year, until Huber and Chmiel were chosen as resident assistants. The other two say, "We're taking applications for two new roommates." Ifinterested, stop by 421 Howard. 
But Howard's creativity is rivaled by that ofSorin. Steve Divney and Mike Cannatti occupy I02 Sorin. Because of the 18-foot ceilings, the guys were able to build a full-scale loft. Nearly a second story, the idea is similar to the room they lived in last year. The lumber cost some­where between 51 00 and S 1 50. 
Why did they do it? Says Divney, "It makes for a nicer lifestyle. We wanted to use our engineering knowledge before graduation. This set-up allows us to have two re­sponsible social gatherings at the same time." Because both arc seniors, the loft will be for sale for next year. 

Down the hall in I07-sorin, live Tim Laboe,Jim Callaghan, Dick Prosen,Jim Folstrum, Steve Beuer­lein. and Chris Kvochak. 1bey have a similar layout in their room, which they planned at the end of last year. Their set-up is also for sale come May. 
'!be room's uniqueness lies in the decor ofone of the walls. It is cov­ered with autographs of nearly everyone who has visited the room. Is that okav with their rector? "Sure! He signed it, too. It's alright as long as we paint over it at the end ofthe year," the guys said. 
Upstairs in 346 Sorin is home to Pat Loughran, Craig Berry, andJohn Gleason. This two-room triple contains "the stages." By putting all of the beds in one room, the other room was open for ideas. Gleason came up with the stage idea. 
The upper stage is their couch and lV console. Underneath is a "study": an armchair and assorted books. The lower stage has more room for seating, and for storage underneath. Says Berry, "It was the only place to keep Pat's skis." 
The wall abv the lower stage is decorated with everyone's favorite mascot: the :-.lotre Dame leprec­haun. The outline was there from previous years and the guys repainted it this year. The room cost approximately $120 and fol­lows all University regulations. As for next year, says Berry, "We'lf keep it, but probably put it together differently." 
North Quad also has its share of unique rooms. Kirk Kimler and Mark Worscheh live in 316 Stan­ford, and have done some unusual 
things to their room. No beds are 
visible upon entering the room. 
They are rigged so that they fold 
down out of the wall, similar to 
bunks in a boat. 'Inc bottom is 
paneled to blend in with the wall. 
The idea was copied from other rooms last year, and took the guys three weeks to build. "Everyone else was studying, and we were still working on our room," they said. 
The middle of the room contains an entertainment center, complete with lV, stereo, and refrigerator. Both the stereo and lV have hookups in the lofts for turning them off. 
Behind the entertainment center is a fabulous shotglass collection. They started it their freshman year and they now have nearly l 50 glasses. The room, including the bed frames, entertainment center, and shotglass case, cost approxi­mately 5350. 
While men seem to be con­structive, women seem to be 
creative. Tammy Kruse has turned 
316 Walsh into a miniature Notre 
Dame. Decorated completely in 
green, blue, and gold, Tammy has 
captured that alumni spirit already.

about Notre Dame. 
Why did she decorate with this theme? "I was already such a Domer when I came here," she said. She plans to keep the idea for next year, because of the time and money that she has put into decorating. The handmade curtains, chairback and blue and gold af¢1an show how handy she is. 
Well, ifyou'rt: looking around your room and wondering what went wrong, just remember, "There's always next year!" A little imagination and creativity can turn your "ho-hum" abode into an inte­rior designer's dream.

Marc Ramirez 
Strange days indeed 
P
ONTIAC, Mich.-Bud Kilroy here. Middle ofjanuary, 1986. I 
don't think they ever thought it would come to this. But it has. 
The big guy just got through preppin' us and we're ready to head 
out onto the battlefield. 
Yeah, I've seen so much pain and suffering I don't even flinch 
anymore. Kids just outta college cryin' for their mothers. The 
veterans who thought they'd be ready for anything-anything but 
this. How such a thing could happen in an advanced society like 
ours eludes me. 
They call me Chief. I am the quarterback ofthe Houston Oilers. 
And I've got to lead these guys out there. This is the Super Bowl, 
and we're playin' the Bears. 
Here's the deal: First they put these little transmitters in our 
helmets -just so the rest ofthe players could hear me calling 
signals. That was okay. But pro football, like everything else, has 
gone too far. 
They decided the rest ofthe good ol' U. S. ofA. would like to hear 
us too, so they made it so everyone athome could hear me barking 
signals. That was early in the season. And now-this. They can hear 
everything we say. 
Wait-time to go. We're lining up, single file, ready to be 
introduced. 
QB: Breaker one-nine, this here's Chief We'refixin' to be 
introduced, come on? 
FB: I bearya, good buddy. We're all lined up behindyou nice 
andpretty, like ants on a sidewalk. 
QB: Mercy sakes alive, Night Train, looks like wegot us a 
convoy. 
TE: You got the Barrelhouse here. Gonna have toput the heels 
to the turftonight, buddy -there's a lot ofBears out there. 
QB: That's a big IO-four, Barrelhouse. Looks like we're gonna 
need us some good defense. Hey DoubleNickels, y'gotyer ears on? 
MLB: You got 'im, Chief Let's kill us some Bears 'fore they get a 
chance to get back to Shy town, y'bear? 
FB: Hey, waita minute, Chief What's yer 20? 
QB: The middle ofthe field, you dodo. They justannounced my 
name. 
We're on the offensive. We've set up bivouac on the 20-yard-line, but we can't hold our position much longer. Thirty seconds is all we've got to make our next move. 
QB: OK, gang, we're ready to roll. You copy? 
LT: We read you, Chief Ten-but. 
QB: No, you moron, two-but. Hut one, but two. 
C: 
Take a bike, Chief QB: Thanks, Snapper. I'm fading back. 

C: 
Roger, Chief I'll stand myground. LE: Chief, I've bit an open area. Send me the ball. QB: Coordinates, Fireball? LE: I'm at the35-yard-line and the left bash mark-ub, 


disregard last transmission, Chief The heavy artillery is almost 
on me. 
RG: Houston, we have a problem. Chief, you'regonna have a 275-pound lineman coming your way in a few seconds, do you read? 
QB: I read you LOUD AND CLEAR, Rambo! Requesting backup! Help! TE: Chief, this is Barrelhouse. I've reached a temporary clearing at the 30-yard-line. Fire away. 
QB: Here goes, Barrelhouse. Airalert. 
TE: I can see it coming, Chief I think I've got it. I think ­
The refs blown the whistle. Play is dead. Bodies are everywhere. 
Barrelhouse never caught the ball. He couldn't hold on. Hit at full speed by a free safety. He'll be out for a long time. Oh well. Life goes on. 
Hiya. I'm the Bears' defensive team captain. They call me the Hunter. I'm at the middle linebacking position. I'm really into all these changes the NFL has been making. Transmitters for us guys on the defense is the best thing they've created since stickum. Excuse me while I spit. 
MLB: Okay, guys, item one: We stopped 'emprettygood on the last one. Way to go, Cobra. 
FS: Hey, only doin' myjob. 
MLB: Item two: It's second-and-10. They've brought in a new tight end since we wasted their last one. Lancer, I wantyou to 
watch the screen; Hondo, watch the end-around on your side; Bandit, take the otherside. 
Okay, men, let's go. Andbey -let's be careful out there. 
BEARS' COACH: Hey men, guess what? We've intercepted their transmissions. They're going long. Hunter, Gomez, Lancer­converge in backfield. 
MLB: Roger, coach. Grody, we're sending everybody. Continue pursuit. Suspect is armed and dangerous, butyou're bigger than be,is. Please apprehend. 
DRE: Yes, sir. Suspect seems quite eager to rid himselfofthe ball. Don't worry, I've gothim now. 
Suspect apprehended. 
MLB: Good work, Grody. 
FB: Chief? Chief, areyou all right? 
QB: I'm losingyour signal, men. Overand out. 

Eric Bergamo 
Television review 
T
his year, NBC has found new frontiers to explore in the fam­ily with "The Cosby Show" and "Family Ties," two shows that have shot the network's Thursday night lineup to the top of the Neilson ratings. 
"The Cosby Show" marks the triumphant return of Bill Cosby to prime-time television. His last series was the highly popular "I Spy" of the sixties. Cosby plays a sucessful and respected doctor, Cliff Hux­table. The plotline for each episode is standard family sitcom fare. noth­ing glaringly new in this depart­ment. Yet the series is different, startlingly different in its format. 
Network television has had its 
share of troubles in presenting 
blacks in a favorable light. It is a 
shameful fact that black role models 
are limited on television, a problem 
that needs w be eliminated in the 
honest view ofequality. 
"The Cosby Show" is a positive 
step in that direction, a direction 
that should be actively pursued by 
all the networks. "The Cosby Show" 
is the first show w present blacks in 
an intelligent and succesful manner. 
No living in the ghetto as CBS once 
did with "Good Times," Bill Cosby 
and family are well-off. There are no 
jokes about living in the squalor of 
the slums. 
The secret to why "The Cosby 
Show" is so good lies in Cosby 
himself. He is so well known to us 
that we can't help but like him in 
his role. When he laughs, we laugh 
with him. His style is smooth, 
honed through the experience of 
many stand-up routines and of 
bringing up his own family. 
It seems that Cosby has faced 
whatever comes up on the show at 
least once in raising his own family 
and uses that experience to en­
hance the show. Cosby is a perfect 
role model, someone we can't help 
from liking. 
Also notable 1 the show is 
Phylicia Ayers-Allen as Cliff's wife 
Clair. She plays her role quite well, 
(well enough to deserve an Emmy 
nomination), and does not let Cosby's star quality overshadow her own talents. Thank you NBC for bringing us something that breaks 
the unfortunate color lines that are 
in television. Thank you for a show 
that everyone can enjoy. 
"Family Ties" is a reversal on the format that made "All in the Family" such a large hit in the seventies. Instead of having the conservative parents against the changing morals and social values of their liberal kids, the roles are reversed. The liberal parents are opposed to the changing morals and social values 
of their conservative kids. Ifthere was ever a sitcom that expressed the changing times since Ronald Reagan took office, "Family Ties" is that sitcom. 
Each week is a new dimension in the widening generation gap be­tween liberal parents and conserva­tive children. The views and opinions ofeach age are put forth and conflicts emerge. The conflicts are not qmte as loud and violent as they were on "All in the Family." 
It is quite humorous to watch the parents reminisce on the peace marches of the sixties while won­dering what happened along the line that made their children so materialistic. At best, the series is a statement of the country's change back to conservatism and the effect of the Reagan years upon Americans. The change from Yippie to Yuppie, from flower power to the power ofone's bank account. 
Another fine cast graces this program. Michael Gross and Meredith Baxter Birney portray the parents with the emotion and savvy needed to get across the fact that they are watching their children take the opposite course in growing up than they did. 
Michael]. Fox takes his role of Alex and uses him to make that statement of the changing ways of 
America. He is purely interested in capitalism and he lets us know it whenever he is on the program. He is the personification ofthe Reagan conservative, yet with a sense of timing that makes his lines much 
more appealing to us. 
Justine Bateman and Tina Yothers round out the cast, which has had Baby Andrew added to it recently. I'll review his acting when he learns to speak, which should be in two seasons.

Rose worried as Reds close 



poor spring 
Assoclated Press 
TAMPA, Fla.-Player-Manager Pete 
Rose says he hopes his Cincinnati 
Reds make a quick turnabout from 
an ill-timed, exhibition-season 
slump just a week away from the 
season opener in Cincinnati. 
Sunday, Cincinnati lost for the 
ninth time in the past 12 games, ab­
sorbing a 15-2 pounding from the 
New York Mets. Reds outfielder 
Dave Parker suggested that the Reds 
are floundering because offatigue. 
"This is probably the worst part of 
spring training," Parker said. 
"You've been here for awhile. You 
are ready, but at the same time you 
want to play for real. I'm ready to 
play for real. 
"It's been a grind," Parker said. 
"I'm a little fatigued. I think every· 
one is, but you just have to suck it up 
and dig a little deeper because we'll 
hit stretches like this in the season, 
too, and you have to be ready for it." 
Rose, chagrined over Sunday's shellacking, said he was postponing the next round ofroster cuts a day or two to avoid having them come on the heels of the loss to the Mets. He said he hopes fatigue is the reason for the Reds' slump. 
"Boy, 1 hope so," he said. "I hope so. I hope they are tired." 
The Reds plan to start pitching staff ace Mario Soto in the April 8 opener against the Montreal Expos. Sunday, Soto and Bob Buchanan were pounded for a total of 22 hits. 
At first base, Cesar Cedeno dropped a wind-blown pop fly and allowed two runs to score. Soto threw a wild pitch which let another run in. Catcher Dann Bilardello dropped a ball while making a tag at the plate. The Reds were down 8-0 after four innings. 
When the Reds finally scored Sun· day in the eighth inning, it ended a string of 19 scoreless innings. 
"We've got to start putting some crooked marks on the board," Parker said. "All we've seen is goose eggs."

great year. The team's personnel is about the same as last year, except for the pres­ence of pitcher Walt Terrell in Dave Rozema's place, but that may be a weak­ness as every other contender is improved. Ifany ofthe players mentioned above has a poor year, Sparky Anderson will be watch­ing the playoffs on television. 
Toronto (89-73)-"Ifthe Blue Jays had a bullpen, they'd win the division." This is what many people have been saying for the last two years, but you shouldn't hear it in 1985 as Toronto has gone out and eliminated the problem by picking up top­notch relievers Bill Caudill and Gary Lavelle. With those two packing up starters like Dave Stieb, Luis Leal and Doyle Alexan­der, and with Jesse Barfield, George Bell and Willie Upshaw leading a talented group of hitters, the Blue Jays should be the division favorites. However, Toronto has one major weakness -it hasn't proven that it can win the division yet. Until the jays prove they can, you can't expect them to beat proven winners like Detroit, Bal­timore and New York. 
Baltimore (85-77) -The Orioles are indeed proven winners -they have the best record in baseball over the last 20 years · and they have the talent, especially on the pitching staff of Mike Boddicker, Storm Davis, Scott McGregor, Sammy Stewart and Tippy Martinez, to win their second divi­sion title in three years. However, they also have been hit by a rash of injuries. Pitcher Mike Flanagan is out for much of the season, while free agent Lee Lacy will miss the first few weeks because of a thumb in­jury. The other teams better capitalize, though, because if Baltimore can stay close for the fU"st half of the season, they'll win the division with their usual second-half rush led by a lineup of Lacy, Fred Lynn, Cal Ripken and Eddie Murray. 
Boston (86-76) -Once again, the Red Sox have one of the best hitting teams in the league and also the best outfield (Dwight Evans, Jim Rice and Tony Armas) in baseball. Their young pitching staff of

who will jump at the chance if one of the 
frontline pitchers should falter. 
Chicago (96-65) -With the kind of tal­ent that he has on his roster, second-year pilot jim Frey doesn't beleive in tampering too much with success. So the defending division champs will field much the same team that won the NL East last year. The only major lineup change is at shortstop, where 22-year old Shawon Dunston will open the season as the starter, replacing 39-year old Larry Bowa, who hit just .223 last year. 
Even if they don't add another pitcher, however, the Cubs have enough on the mound to stay in contention. Not even the biggest Cubs' fan could hope for Rick Sutcliffe to have the kind of year he had in '84, but the veteran right-hander will get some support in the starting rotation from Dennis Eckersley, Dick Ruthven, Scott San­derson, and Steve Trout, as well as help from the bullpen in the person of Lee Smith. 
Philadelphia (81-81)-The Phillies fig­ure to be solid around the top ofthe lineup, but there are still some big question marks looming as opening day nears. Chief among these is the first-base situation, where the trading of Len Matuszek to Toronto leaves converted-outfielder John Russell as the leader at that position. The Phillies are already shaky on the right side of the infield with juan Samuel at second base, who has been hitting the cover offthe ball lately but continues to field ground balls like he's using a shovel. Mike Schmidt is solid at third base, but rookie manager John Felske will need solid seasons from shortstop Ivan Dejesus and catcher Ozzie Virgil if the Phils are going to go anywhere. 
The Phillies' bullpen, led by AI Holland and Bill Campbell, should get the job done, but once you get past Steve Carlton and John Denny, the starting staff is pretty suspect. 
Pittsburgh (75-87) -These days you have to wait on line to gripe if you're a Bruce Hurst, Bob Ojeda, Roger Clemens, AI Nipper and Dennis Boyd also began to come around last season. If new addition Bruce Kison has a good year, and ifreliever Bob Stanley returns to the form that saw him gain 33 saves in 1983, then Boston could make a run for the title. More likely, though, the Red Sox will finish in the middle of the pack. 
New York (87-75) -With the addition of outfielder Ricky Henderson, the Yankees lineup, already tough with Dave Winfield and Don Mattingly, may be the strongest in the division. If pitchers like Phil Niekro, Ron Guidry, and joe Cowley have good seasons, the Yankees could be very hard to beat, but the chances of the pitching being good enough to beat four excellent teams are not very promising. Niekro most likely will not repeat his 16-8 season, while Guidry's future doesn't look too productive. Look for New York to finish in the bottom half of the division. 
Cleveland (75-87) -Ifthe Indians were in the AL West, they might have a chance at winning the division with their decent pitching staff. In the East, though, Pat Corrales' team has little chance offinishing higher than fifth. If Bert Blyleven ( 19-7, 
2.87 ERA) and leading reliever Ernie Camacho repeat their 1984 performances, and if starters Neil Heaton and Rick Be­henna live up to their promise, the Indians could be spoilers. However, Cleveland needs production from hitters like Mel Hall and Joe Carter if it is going to finish higher than sixth. 
Milwaukee (67-94) -Now that George Bamberger is back in the Brewer dugout, Milwaukee's personnel looks a lot like that of the team that ended up going to the World Series a few years ago. However, the '85 edition is just a skeleton of that power­ful team because of injuries to many key players like Rollie Fingers, Paul Molitor, Robin Yount and Pete Vuckovich. If, by some miracle, players like Yount, Fingers, Cecil Cooper and Ben Oglivie return to their old form, Milwaukee could pull off some surprises. Realistically, though, the Brewers will be lucky to stay out ofthe cel­lar. 
member of Chuck Tanner's "grumble bunch." The latest trade demands are com­ing from lefthander John Candelaria, who is upset about being moved to the bullpen to replace the injured Rod Scurry. Scurry, by the way, also wants to be traded. 
Ifthe Pirates could ever get their act to­gether, they could make some noise in the division race. Last year, Pittsburgh had one ofthe best pitching staffs in the majors, but, unfortunately, it was teamed with an of­fense that had all the punch of a 50-year­old prizefighter. The off-season acquisitions of George Hendrick, Steve Kemp, and Sixto Lezcano should help the Pirates balance things out a little more, however. 
St. Louis (84-78) -The big question for Cardinal fans in '85 is, "Will there be life in the bullpen after Bruce Sutter?" Neil Allen will try to prove that there is, but the fact remains that the Cards went nowhere last year when theybad Sutter, so you can't ex­pect much of an improvement now that he's gone. Their starting pitching, however, which includes joaquin Andujar, Bob Forsch and John Tudor, as well as young talent like Danny Cox and Ricky Horton, is a strong point. 
But the Cards are still lacking of­fensively. Sure, plenty of Whitey Herzog's players could get speeding tickets on the basepaths, but one wonders ifthere will be anyone around who can drive those guys in. How many current Redbirds hit more than 11 home runs last season? And how many knocked in more than 70 runs? The answer to both questions equals the Cards chances ofwinning the NL East-zero. 
Montreal (78-83) -The fans in Montreal have got to be wondering what's going on. One year, they're watching Bill Virdon lead the Expos into contention, the next year the team is in fifth place under someone named Jim Fanning. Well this year, the Expos and their new manager, Buck Rodgers, might be better off trying their luck in the 25th century then in 1985. 
Gary Carter's loss will be felt at the plate, but also on the mound, where a question­able pitching staff will lose its veteran signal-caller. The starters, namely Steve Rogers, Bill Gullickson and the currently­disabled Charlie Lea, might not be that bad, but the relievers are closer to arsonists than firemen. 

Royals 
continuedfrom page 16 
talented Kent Hrbek set there. The real problem areas are short and catcher, where journeyman (and ex-Twin) Roy Smalley and Tim Laudner, rt.spectively, will attempt to plug the holes. Three-fifths of the pitching staff are proven com­modities, with Mike Smithson, John Butcher and future CyYounger Frank Viola locked in. Two rookies, starter Richard Yett and reliever Curt Wardle, should con­tribute a lot to the staff. Pitching problems, ifthere are to be any, will be in the bullpen, where last season Ron Davis started more fires than careless campers. 
Oakland (77-85) -The A's could be a surprise team in the West, but there a few things which must happen for that to be the case. 1.) Pitchers Rick Langford, Steve McCatty and Mike Norris must return to the form they showed a few years back when Billy Martin was managing the club. 2.) Dave Kingman must continue to hit with the power he did last year in racking up 35 HRs and 118 RBis. 3.) Newcomers like Dave Collins, Alfredo Griffin and jay Howell are going to have to fill the holes created by the departures of some key players. Ifall those things happen, the A's may be able to make a serious run in this division, although they aren't likely to win it. 
Chicago (74-88) -Tony LaRussa's prob­lems as White Sox manager figure to get only worse this season. While Chicago does have a legitimate shot at winning the division, it will be lucky to play .500 ball. There have been a few changes since last year's disappointing season that followed a first-place finish in 1983, but none of any great significance. It's really hard to see the Pale Hose doing much of anything unless Ron Kittle hits better than .215 and knocks in more than 74 runs, his totals oflast year. Add the continuing feud of Carlton Fisk with LaRussa, and it's easy to imagine a scenario where LaRussa is canned by the All-Star break. 
Seattle (74-88) -Seattle has never finished higher than fourth in the division, and don't count on the Mariners to change 
Padres 
continuedfrom page 16 
footed combination of Alan Wiggins and Garry Templeton can perform as well at the plate as in the field. Overall, it appears the surfwon't be the only thing that will be up in San Diego. 
Atlanta (80-82) -The only challenge that the Padres may have to stave off may come from the Atlanta Braves. When Ted Turner wasn't threatening to buy out CBS over the winter, he was making Bruce Sut­ter financially independent. His addition should help shore up a bullpen which did nothing for a pitching staff that is shameful after Pascual Perez. 
If the Braves are going to get the job done, they will need a healthy Bob Horner. Dale Murphy is a great hitter, but he won't get many pitches unless there is a power threat behind him. Youngster Brad Kom­minsk could provide that, but he is not reliable. Other than Claudell Washington, who hit only seven ofhis 17 homers in the last five months of the season, the Braves may as well be hitting with swizzle sticks. Still, Sutter may be able to save the Braves enough to keep them in contention. 
Los Angeles (79-83) -Oh, how the mighty have fallen. The once great Dodger infield of Garvey, Lopes, Russell, and Cey has been replaced by Brock, Sax, Ander­son, and Guerrero, which gathered more rays than grounders last year. That made things difficult for the Dodger starting staff, which comprises the best four-man rota­tion in the division. Other things which added to the ruin of the Dodgers were an anemic offense and a bullpen that was lo­cated in a drug dependency program in Santa Monica. Since neither of these items has been changed in the off-season, don't expect the Dodger fortunes to change much either. If depression truly causes people to eat more, the Dodger equipment manager is going to have to get Tom Lasorda's next uniform from Omar the Tent Maker. 
Cincinnati (70-92) -Pete Rose has to be the most secure manager in baseball, because there is no way Cincinnati man­agement is going ro fire him before he breaks Ty Cobb's record. He also has to be that this year. Nevertheless, Manager Chuck Cottier will attempt to do what Dar­rell Johnson, Maury Wills, Rene Lac­hemann and Del Crandall have been unable to do in the franchise's eight-year history -reach the .500 mark. The Kingdome was built to hold out the rain, but it will be raining baseballs a lot inside this year, as Mariner outfielders again can expect to see cannon shot after cannon shot heading their way. Key to Seattle suc­cess will be whether or not last year's A.L. Rookie of the Year Alvin Davis can avoid the sophomore slump. Expect to see some improvement from the Mariners' younger players, but Jack Perconte, Spike Owen and Larry Milbourne does not an infield make. 
California (81-81) The Angels managed to tie for second place last year, a virtue brought about only because of their residence in this division. Don't expect to see them higher than fourth any time after August 1, though. Prune juice and Geritol might be a good substitute for Gatorade in the dugout. Depending on whether or not Reggie Jackson DHs on any particular day, California starts six or seven players over age 30. In fact, rumor has it owner Gene Autry plans to start including Medicare in player contracts, and white-haired manager Gene Mauch supposedly was mis­taken as one of his players last month at spring training. 
As the wear and tear of the 162-game season begins to take its toll, watch for Cal­ifornia to fold up like an accordian. Mike Witt cannot carry the pitching staff alone, but he may be forced to try with the pitchers the Angels have. 
Texas (69-92) -Third-year Ranger manager Doug Rader is a guy who's been known not to take much of anything seriously. By the same token, it's hard to take Texas seriously as a contender for the AL West crown. The Rangers have some good arms, but the roster lists an equal number of not-so-good pitchers. Take, for example, Mitch Zwolensky, who spent last year at Oklahoma City. He sounds better suited to be a cowhand on Bonanza. The Texas outfield is fairly solid, boasting Larry Parrish, Billy Sample, George Wright and Gary Ward. There are so many holes in other places, though, as Buddy Bell is the only non-ding-dong in the infield. 
the most secure player in baseball, because there's no way his manager is going to keep him from playing. 
Unfortunately, Rose's young team may frustrate him more than his pursuit of the "Georgia Peach." Other than Mario Soto, and a speedy outfield consisting of Gary Redus, Duane Walker and Eric Davis, Rose doesn't have a lot going for his squad. Still, this is a young team on the rise, and Rose should be able to instill enough spirit in this team to drive them a little higher in the standings. 
Houston (80-82) -It used to be you had to hit the ball outside the Astrodome to get a homer in Houston, but the Astros brought in the fences and brought down their chances. The Astros have a bunch of guys that couldn't hit a home run in a phone booth, so the only people helped by the closer fences will be opposing hitters. 
Fortunately, Houston has a pretty good pitching staff, headlined byNolan Ryan and Joe Niekro. However, even those guys can't win ifthe Astros don't score any runs, and they won't score many if the heart of their lineup consists of the troika of Terry Puhl, Jose Cruz, and Phil Garner. There's less power there than during the NewYork City blackout. The Astros had better pray for a lot of rainouts, but since those don't occur too often in the Astrodome, it could be a long year. The suggestion for manager Bob Lillis: Rent instead ofbuying. 
San Fransisco (66-96) -What do the Giants and Michael jackson have in com­mon? They both wear a glove on one hand without a reason. This team committed the most errors in baseball last year, and they hold the title ofthe worst team in baseball for three reasons -hitting, pitching, and defense. 
Ifthere is a good point about the Giants, it's the fact they do have some rising stars. The outfield of Jeff Leonard, Chili Davis and Dan Gladden is one of the brightest in baseball, but the infield is a catastrophe waiting to happen, with johnny "Disaster" Lemaster leading the way. Bob Brenly is a good young catcher, but not too much will hit his mitt, as Giant pitchers will need a swivel on their necks. If there's anything for manager Jim Davenport to be happy about, it's the fact that he can't do any worse than last year's tandem ofFrank Rob­inson and Danny Ozark. Or can he?

LEXINGTON, Ky. -Harold Jensen didn't start for the Villanova Wildcats last night, but he finished as a member of the national champions and on the all-tournament team for the NCAA Final Four. 
Jensen, a 6-S sophomore, carne off the bench for the Wildcats, who defeated Georgetown, 66-64, to take the national title as an unranked team with 10 losses. And jensen was the key, both from the field and the foul line. 
Vlllanova shot an NCAA record 79 percent from the field for the game, and Jensen made an important con­tribution by canning all five of his shoL<; from the field. The sport's newest super sub also made four of five free throws, all in the final 1 :24 ofplay. 
"This feels a little bit better be­cause I know I've already made the free throws," Jensen said after step­ping down from a chair on which he'd stood to take his victorysnips at the victory net. 
"'Ibis is an undescribale feeling and it's just great that it came with such a great bunch of guys and it's the culmination to an unbelieveable season filled with blood, sweat and tears," said Jensen, who scored 14 points. 
It was Georgetown, however, that had to hold back the tears of defeat as Jensen, an 81-percent free-throw shooter during the season, made

McClain's three-point play kept them up, 41-36, but Georgetown came back and went ahead on David Wingate's jumper, 42-41, with 9:49 remaining. 
The lead changed hands five times, the last on a jumper by Pinckney, who was named the tournament Most Valuable Player. Mclain hit two free throws for a 49-46lead. 
Again the Wildcats went ahead by five on a Pinckney jumper but Georgetown came back with six straight poinL<;. Wingate's drive put the Hoyas ahead, 54-53. 
Pinckney then lost the ball trying to drive against Ewing and the Hoyas went into a spread offense. But Horace Broadnax, attempting to pass to Bill Martin, threw the ball off a Villanova player and it bounced off Broadnax's feet. 
Villanova then hit six straight points, with Jensen hit­ting a jumper, Pinckney rwo free throws andJensen two more free throws for a 59-54 advantage with 1:24 remaining. 
Broadnax then made a basket but Jensen, a reserve sophomore guard who played most of the game, con­nected for two more free throws. 
McClain then missed a free throw, snapping his string of 20 straight successful foul shots in the tournament, andJensen also missed the front end ofa one-and-one. 
Ewing's jam brought Georgetown to within 61-58 with 4 I seconds left but McClain then came through with two more free throws. A Wingate field goal pulled the Hoyas within three but McClain then hit another one-and-one with 1H seconds left for a 65-60 edge. 
Georgetown, the Big East tournament winner and the No. I ranked team for all but five weeks this season ­
Against Wisconsin-Milwaukee, the Belles were able to shut out all of their singles and doubles matches with ease. Hall won a shut out 6-0, 6-0 at No. I, while teammate Laverie dominated her opponent, 6-2, 6-1 in the second singles slot. '!bird singles player Beck rallied to win 6-2, 7-5, and Zero slammed her way to a 6-1, 6-1 at No. 4. To complete the sweep, Yung overcame her opponent, 6-4, 6­3, and McDevitt matched the feat, 6-1, 6-3, to win the number five and six slots. 
In doubles play, the Belles continued to smash their opponents. Laverie and Hall earned a 6-1, 6-4 victory, while the duo of Yung and Zern stayed ahead of their doubles opponent by a score of6-2, 6-3. This identical score was matched by teammates Beck and McDevitt to complete the doubles sweep. 
The Belles' strong performances against Marquette and the University of Wisconsin enabled the team to walk away proudly from the dual meet at Marquette. 
"They (Wisconsin) were not as strongas us, and we were playing well," commented Nester. "Also, we were psyched-up after beating Marquette." 
Things have started out well for the Belles this spring, after a successful fall season which saw the squad qualify for the Nationals, a post­season tournament to be held on May 20-21. Every member of the fall squad has returned for the spring, and number three singles player, Kristen Beck has since added her services to the squad. 
"We're looking forward to a strong, suc­

The miss didn't affect Jensen as Dwayne McClain and Harold Pres­sley made five more free throws to seal the victory. 
Jensen was named to the all­tournament team, becoming the second non-starter to earn that dis­tinction in as many years. Geor­getown forward Michael Graham achieved the same honor last year.

Men's tennis team rolls to easy win over Valpo, takes on Butler today 
By SEAN MURPHY 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's tennis team, which scored an impressive 9­0 victory over Valparaiso on Satur­day, will play host to Butler University today at Courtney Tennis Courts. Even tougher competition will follow the Butler match, as three Big Ten teams will challenge the 9-4 Irish. 
Saturday's rout ofan overmatched Valparaiso squad did not see a single match go farther than the minimum two sets. Although, obviously, Val­paraiso could not give the Irish the toughest competition, they did give the young Notre Dame tennis team a chance to gain some much needed experience. 
"Our lack of experience has hurt us this year," says head coach Tom Fallon. "This team needs as much competition as possible." 
Only two players -junior captain Joe Nelligan and senior Mike Gibbons-of the six regulars on the squad have lettered previously. 
The tennis team will have the chance to gain even more experi­ence, however, as they take on four teams in the next eight days. Follow­ing today's match with Butler, Notre Dame will face Indiana at home, then Ohio State and Michigan on the road. 
"Big Ten schools are always tough," says Fallon. "Thursday's match against Indiana is a big one for us. They have a very strong program this year." 
Go ahead. Roosevelt's conven­ient locations and class sched­ules let you earn credits while you're earning cash, too. Classes are held days, eve­nings and weekends through­out the summer. Terms begin May 15 and July 8. So come to Roosevelt and take back the credits you need to bring you closer to a degree.

Gibbons, a three-year letter win­
ner, agrees with his coach's assess­
ment. 
"This is the important part of our schedule," says Gibbons. "Last year, we lost 5-4 to Ohio State and 5-4 to Michigan. We would definitely like to beat them this year." 
This year's Irish team consists of Nelligan and Gibbons in the one and two singles spots, respectively. Freshman Dan Walsh earned the number three singles position this season, while senior Dave Obert fol­lows in the number four slot. Sopho­more Tom Grier is number five this year, followed by another freshman, Paul Daggs, in the sixth and final singles position. These six players also make up Notre Dame's three doubles teams. 
Because of the transfer of sopho­more Paul Ghidotti, who was the number three singles player and a doubles player as well last semester, the Irish doubles teams have had to be repaired. 
"Doubles was a problem this year 
because of (Ghidotti's) transfer," 
says Coach Fallon. "It's always tough when you have new people playing together. But they have been playing well recently." 
Judging from Notre Dame's singles record of9-4 this spring, they too have been playing well recently. 
This week's three Big Ten matches should provide the young Irish tennis team with a chance to show just how much they have learned.

Villanova celebrates win 
Associated Press 
VILLANOVA, Pa.-Wild cheering erupted from dormitories, rolls of toilet paper arched across the sky and firecrackers exploded last night as Villanova upset top-ranked Georgetown for the NCAA bas­ketball title. 
"I'm ecstatic -I knew they were going to do it!" said freshman Doug Camburn as he was covered with a spray of beer. "This is supposed to be a dry campus, but this is amazing! Ifthis is college life, this is great!" 
Within five minutes after the final buzzer in Lexington, Ky., signaled the 66-64 win and Villanova's first basketball championship, at least 300 students filled the quadrangle, their screams clashing with rock music blaring from dorm windows and honking car horns. 
Achant of"Eddie is God" went up throughout the Roman Catholic campus as a banner in tribute to 6-9 senior center Ed Pinckney was illuminated in a dorm window. 
"Every expert was proved wrong," said junior Cedric Vaughn of Los Angeles. ''I'm so glad I went to Villanova -this is the world's greatest university!" 
The celebration will continue today when the team arrives at Philadelphia International Airport and heads downtown for a noon parade and ceremony.

Offensive coaches busy readying 1985 Notre Dame attack 
By MARlY BURNS 
Sports Writer 
The remaining three weeks of spring football will be cr.itical to the construction of the Notre Dame of­fense. In fact, if things go well, the Irish could hit new heights this year in offensive production. 
"!be foundation of any success that occurs, though, will not rest solely on the arm of quarterback 

Jim Higgins 
Steve Beuerlein or the legs of tail­back Allen Pinkett. 
Much of success will depend on the five architects of the Notre Dame offense -the coaching staff. These men are Offensive Coordina­tor Mike Stock, Assistant Head Coach Mal Moore, quarterback coach Ron Hudson, and offensive line coaches Carl Selmer and Jim Higgins. 
From all indications, the Irish of­fensc will be in good hands, for this year's coaching staff comes in with not only some pretty impressive credentials, but with the added ad­vantage of knowing the work of all the other members on the staff. This year, for the first time in the five-year tenure of Gerry Faust, all five offen­sive coaches are returning to the staff. 
"We're going to benefit by having them all return," says Faust. "It's un­usual to have all your coaches to­gether for more than one season, particularly now with the USFL creatingso many job opportunities." 
Stock, who spent six years as an Irish assistant under Ara Parseghian, was one coach who took a coaching job in the USFL. The Northwestern graduate returned to Notre Dame a year later, however, in the capacity ofpass receivers coach under Faust. 
The 1985 season will be Stock's third season ofduty under Faust, but it promises to be a unique challenge in that he will be serving as offensive coordinator as well as pass receivers coach. Last year's offensive coordin­ator, Ron Hudson, gave up the duty to concentrate more closely on the young quarterbacks. '!be role of of­fensive coordinator will not be en­tirely new to Stock, though, for he held that exact role for three seasons at the University of Wisconsin. 
"Basically, the offensive coach assumes the responsibility ofsetting up the game plan and the general of­fensive philosophy," says Stock. "The ideas will be group-oriented,

Can anyone beat the Hoyas? Better believe it! 
Villanova uses blistering shooting to upset Georgetown for NCAA title

Sony about that, Patrick Ewing, but the Vtllanova Wildcats answered the ques­tion, "Can anybody beat Georgetown?" by krwcki11g off the Hoyas, 66-64, last night in Lexi11gton, Ky. Led by seniors 
At'rhoto 
Dwayne McClain, Ed Pinckney and Gary Mclain, the Wildcats set an NCAA Tourn­ament record by making 79 percent of their shotsfrom thefield. 

Associated Press 
LEXINGTON, Ky. -Coach Rollie Massimino said unranked Villanova would have to play a perfect game to beat No. I Georgetown and keep the Hoyas from winning their second straight national championship. 
His Wildcats, a nine-point underdog, did just that, and came away with a stunning 66­64 victory last night in the final of the NCAA basketball tournament. 
"No one thought we could do it, but I did," said Massimino, whose team won the title with the worst record ever among NCAA champions, 2 5-1 0. 
The Wildcats shot 90 percent from the field in the second half as part of all-time tourna­ment record 78.6 percent, hitting 22 of 28 shots, but a couple of the heroes said there was more to the victory. 
"We worked so hard. Nobody in Ameriea knows how hard Villanova worked," said senior guard Gary McLain. "This is what hap­pens when you work so hard. You are No. 1." 
The victory denied three-time all-America Patrick Ewing a title in his final game. The 7-0 center was held to 14 points and was kept from dominating the action. 
"You can't be intimidated in a game like this," said Villanova's Ed Pinckney, who battled Ewing in the pivot all night. "It was the last game of the year -of my career. I had to play my hardest" 
Georgetown had won I 7 straight games and completed the season with a 35-3 record and a 121-23 record during Ewing's four-year career. Villanova was beaten twice by the Hoyas during the regular Big Ea..'lt season, 52­50 in overtime and 57-50, and Georgetown entered the game a nine-point favorite. 
Dwayne McClain hit two free throws and Harold Pressley one of two to provide the margin ofvictory, with Georgetown's Michael jackson completing the scoring with a field goal with four seconds remaining. 
McClain, hitting five of seven field goals, paced Villanova with 17 points and 6-9 Pinckney scored 16. 
The Wildcats als.o hit 22 of 27 free throws and matched the Hoyas on the boards with 17 rebounds. 
Georgetown was trying to become only the seventh team and the first since UCLA in 1973 to repeat as NCAA champions. They were being rated among the greatest teams of all time, after breezing through the last part of their schedule and looking stronger with each game. 
But Villanova, which finished in a third­place tie in the Big East Conference with Syracuse, began a six-game winning streak in the tournament, knocking off other ranked teams such as No. 2 Michigan and No. "i Memphis State in Saturday's semifinal. 
Their upset victory was akin to that of North Carolina State, which won the NC..AA title two years ago as an overwhelming under­dog. But that N.C. State team finished with one more victory against its I 0 losses, and the 16th ranking in the final pre-tournament poll. All Villanova had to show was hope as it en­tered its sixth consecutive NCAA tournament, a competition it never had won. 
The Wildcats pulled ahead 29-ZH at halftime and, after Ewing hit an opening jumper in the second half, they went up 36-30 with Harold Jensen's ba..'lket, a three-point play by Pinckney and a jumper by Gary McLain.

Some predictions for the 1985 base ball season

Sports Writer 
AL East 
During the past several years, most of 
the teams in the American League East 
have been cursed at one time or another by 
being members of baseball's toughest divi­
sion. Only one team from the division can 
go to the playoffs each year even though 
the second-and third-place teams in the AL 
East are usually among the top four teams 
in the major leagues. 
The division has been very strong the 
last two years, with the AL East winner rol­
ling through the playoffs to win the world 
championship. This season, though, will 
see the division become possibly the 
strongest and most competitive in major 
league history. 
Five teams should challenge to succeed 
Detroit as the AL East champ, with the win­
ner most likely becoming the world cham­
pion. It's almost a shame that there 
couldn't be an eight-team playoff in Octo­
ber -five teams from the AL East and one 
each from the other divisions-but it would 
be wrong to change the last legitimate 
playoffsystem in pro sports. 
Anyway, Detroit hao; got to be favored 
because it ha..'l almost the same team as it 
did last year, but look for Boston, Bal­
timore, NewYorkand, especially, Toronto, 
to give the Tigers all they can handle. 
Detroit (104-50) -It was a 35-5 start 
that gave the Tigers a division title last 
season, but don't think that will happen 
again. If the world champs are going to 
repeat, they're going to have strong years 
from the men up the middle -catcher 
Lance Parrish, shortstop Alan Trammell, 
second baseman Lou Whittaker, and 
centerfielder Chet Lemon -and hope that 
reliever Willie Hernandez has another

AL West 
In a division weaker than the social life at Notre Dame, the American League West, a number of teams have a fair chance to rise to the top simply by getting hot for an ex­tended period of time. This year, the AL West shapes up with Kansas City, Min­nesota, Oakland and Chicago as legitimate title contenders, while Seattle, California and Texas will lag behind miserably. 
Kansas City (84-78) -After a slow start in 1984, manager Dick Howser really had the Royals playing well by season's end. The late-season Royal· run was good enough to edge out the Twins and Angels for first place. If Kansas City can continue to play as well this season, it should have no difficulty running away with this divi­sion. But to do that, the Royals must see continued improvement from all of their younger players, especially pitchers Mark Gubicza, Bret Saberhagen and Bud Black. The big trouble spot in KC. may be catcher, where veteran John Wathan couldn't hit a medicine ball last season and Don Slaught did little better. 
Still, if stopper Dan Quisenberry can do the same kind of job he did last year and if third baseman George Brett does in fact play as well as the "experts" are predicting he will, the problem at catcher may not matter. 
Minnesota (81-81)-Surprise, Surprise. That was the Minnesota Twins contending for the division title until the last week of the season in 1984. Ifa few things fall into place for the boys from the Land of 10,000 Lakes, they may be able to come out on top this year. The outfield is solid with Tom Brunansky, Kirby Puckett and Mickey Hatcher, as is first base with the multi-

NL East 

What a difference a year makes. 
Last spring, anyone who picked the New York Mets or Chicago Cubs to win he Na­tional League East would have probably found themselves watching baseball in a rubber room. But, by now, it's become painfully obvious to fans in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, and Montreal that the balance of power in this division has offi­cially shifted. 
This year, most of the so-called experts are tabbing the Mets and Cubs as the teams to beat in the NL East, and this writer (who, incidentally, removed himself from the "expert" category by picking the Pirates last season) offers some predictions for the '8S season while also taking a stab at redemption after last year's debacle. 
New York (90-72) -The acquisition of Gary Carter should be the difference be­rween the Mets being a good team and a great team in '85. Offensively, the lineup has plenty of punch with Carter joining Darryl Strawberry and Keith Hernandez in the heart of the batting order, followed by veterans George Foster and Ray Knight. Of those five, all but Knight knocked in at least 86 runs last year. Centerfielder Mookie Wilson is still nursing a sore shoulder, but should be ready by opening day. Rafael Santana, who handled the shortstop posi­tion well last year, returns in a starting role. 
The Mets' biggest weakness is in the pitching staff, where there is a goldmine of talent but not a lot of experience. Dwight Gooden, Ron Darling, Bruce Berenyi and Sid Fernandez are the top four starters, but only Berenyi has more than a year ofmajor­league experience. Veteran Ed Lynch will open the season as the fifth starter, but

NL West 
If you're looking for a division which is going to be highly competitive with a lot of great teams, then you have come to the wrong place. This is the National League Worst, I mean West, and it is merely the senior circuit's answer to the American League Worst, uh, West. 
Last year, this division was as successful as an Ohio savings and loan. The Padres won by default, because they were the only team to finish over .<;00. While San Diego should get a little more competition this year, it appears the Padres should be in the National League playoffs. A word of warning, though: Look out for the Braves. If Bruce Sutter is the biggest thing to hit At­lanta since General Sherman, the Braves may be able to sneak into the top spot. 
San Diego (92-70)-How the West was won in 1984 was the fact the Padres had two things nobody else in the division had­hitting and pitching. For those same reasons, San Diego should repeat as West Division champions in 1985. While nobody on the starting staff is a Cy Young candidate, Dick Williams' starters get the job done as they proved last year by leading the league in shutouts. The loss of Tim Lollar is negated by the addition ofthe durable Lamarr Hoyt, who should have a better year in his first National League season than his 13-18 campaign of a year ago with the White Sox. Goose Gossage spearheads the bullpen, and he will get plenty of help from table-setters Craig Lef­ferts and Tim Stoddard. 
On offense, the Padres have a fine blend of speed and power. Steve Garvey headlines a group offive Padres who could hit 20 homers or more, while the fleet-
