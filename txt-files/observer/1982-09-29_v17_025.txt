Indiana authorities changed their mi~ds today about a trip to Texas to interview Coral Eugene Watts, who has ad­mitted slaying 13 women in Texas and Michigan. Lafayette Police Detective James Withers was hoping Watts might be able to shed light on two 1977 murders in Indiana and planned to interview him in Texas. But the officer said Watts was apparently not in the Hoosier state at the time of the 1977 murders. Withers said the deaths of Linda Sue Ferry, 30, of Dayton, Ind., and Kristy Kozik, 19, a Purdue University student, remain unsolved. Watts, 28, has been transferred to the Texas Department of Corrections diagnostic unit in Huntsville, authorities said. He was sentenced earlier this month to 60 years in prison after pleading guilty to a charge of burglary with intent to commit murder. He admitted, however, killing 13 women in Houston, Austin, Galveston and Michigan, officials said. Watts was given immunity from murder charges under terms ofa plea bargai.

In the Soviet Union, source of most of the world's caviar, the once abundant delicacy has all but vanished from stores. It is available only to tourists, the nation's elite and people able to pay exorbitant black market prices. It's a fur cry from the 1950s, when caviar was so plentiful and cheap that Soviets ate it for break­fast. Now, good connections or Western currency are essential for getting the prized appetizer -eggs of the Caspian Sea sturgeon. Offi­cials say the catch is good and only 3 percent is exported. Western prices have quadrupled in ten years and one French importer es­timates the Soviets export 15 times what they claim they 4o. "We haven't had any natural caviar for a long, long time," said an employee ofMoscow's biggest fish store, Okean (Ocean), last week. One store sometimes sells artificial cavi t ar, made from curdled mil and other additives and resembles the tiny black fish eggs. But for genuine caviar, most Soviets must turn to the black market. The offi­cial state price is the equivalent of S32 for a 1.1 pound tin, but black marketeers may charge S90 or more for the same amount. -AP

United We Stand 

This week section leaders all over the Notre Dame campus will be knocking on doors and asking students to donate 52 to the annual United Way drive. 'If you're like the average student of past years, you'll hand over your two bucks without giving it a second thought. Or, maybe if you're in a rebellious mood, you'll mutter something about "no change" and close the door. 
Some students refuse to give to the United Way cam­paign because they say they resent the pressure imposed on them to donate. The fact that the drive is run on a very personal, one-on-one solicitation basis, with section leaders directly approaching individuals seems to make some students feel threatened. 
These students' refusal to contribute to United Way is based on the way they perceive the drive as handled at Notre Dame. They feel that if they donate, they will be giving because they are obliged to, and not because they are acting out ofa true sense ofcharity. 
Juniors John Bardsley and Tom Bogen, co-chairmen of this year's United Way campaign staff at Notre Dame say the campus drive is not designed in such a personal manner to induce "guilt" contributions. It is simply the result of several years of intense organization of the campaign. "We don't run it this way for pressure. It's for

Bardsley commented on the abortion issue, saying "Any money given in this drive will not go to fund abor­tions... People would have problems with that and right­Iy so." 
In recent years the Saint Mary's Student Government has voted not to support United Way, for reasons al­ledgedly relating to the abortion issue. This year, however, this stand was reversed after the faculty ap­proached Student Government and asked for their sup­

agencies and services in­clude the American Red Cross, the Mental Health As­sociation, the Salvation Army, the Alcoholism Council and many more. 
The most redeeming aspect of United Way is that it acts as a blanket organization, making it unnecessary for the agencies involved to spend much time and funds on donation drives. In this manner, the agencies can con­centrate on their primary role of helping the com­munity. 
The fact that the St. Joseph County United Way managed to raise $2.8 million for these agencies last year is admirable. But perhaps the fact that the money was raised entirely by volunteers is even more sig­nificant. There still are people in the world willing to help others without thought of monetary reward. 
A controversy that seems to arise each year in the minds ofstudents is whether United Way funds finance pro-abortion organizations. The following is an excerpt of a letter written by Joseph A. Greci, executive direc­tor ofthe St. Joseph County United Way, ill response to the abortion question: Each United Way ts locally or-
Although it's too late for this year's drive, Notre Dame and Saint Mary's should make plans to unite their campaigns next year. It has taken NO approximately seven years to reach its present level of organization. It would probably take Saint Mary's just as long to reach a comparable level. Cooperation between the two schools would enhance the early efforts of the Saint Mary's participation and thus achieve better results than ifthe campaigns remain separate. 
Brogen sees the contribution drive as an educational experience similar to requests that will be made of us when we enter the working world. When we graduate and go out into the "real world," such requests will be numerous. It will be up to us to examine them and determine which are worthwhile. 
As for the United Way drive this week, the ultimate decision to contribute can only be made by the in­dividual. But in the long run, the actual value ofa con­tribution would far outweigh any well-meaning plans to cleanse the system by refusing to donate.

Should Notre Dame require a computer course? Should there be a university language requirement? According to Father David Tyson, executive assistant to Father Hes­burgh, these and other questions should be answered by a review of Notre Dame's Curriculum. /In his talk last night on "The Future of Notre Dame," Tyson suggested that there should be a review of Notre Dame's curriculum, especial­ly the General Education Com­ponent. According to Tyson, both society and students have changed since the curriculum was last reviewed in the late 1960's. Tyson stated that both the distribution and the content of the General Educa­

Helen Kellogg Institute for Interna­tional Studies has brought several scholars to Notre Dame from Latin American countries to teach courses and aid research in that area. 
The institute was founded last Dec. 1 with the appointment of its Director, Fr. Ernest Bartell. The research will focus on the needs of Third World people, especially the poor, Bartell said. One of the in­stitute's concerns is human rights and "the participation of low­income people who regimes," he continued. 
The institute is funded by an en­dowment gift from Helen Kellogg, who had expressed to friends at Notre Dame an interest in interna­tional studies. In deciding how to use the Kellogg endowment, the university narrowed its focus to Latin America for several reasons, 
. First, the concern for Latin America's poor is an appropriate one for a Catholic university, Bartell stated. He also stressed the common Christian heritage of the United States and Latin America and the in­fluence of issues in that area on American life. 
Bartell emphasized that research

Notre Dame's curriculum.  

In addition to discussion of cur­riculum review, Tyson addressed such topics as the mission of Notre Dame in the future, financial aspects ofthe university, and undergraduate enrollment, in his lecture to the academic commission ofZahm Hall. 
Tyson stated that financial aid could be a priority in the near future. In the past, Notre Dame has relied heavily on federal funds for financial aid, but the federal aid situation has become very uncertain under the Reagan administration. Tyson said that the administration is not in­sensitive to the financial needs ofthe students, but the building ofa finan­cial aid endowment requires time.

to investigate the recent massacre of 
Palestinians in two Beirut refugee 
camps, concluded last week with a 
total of2814 signatures collected. 
The petition, which conveys stu­dent outrage over the massacre in which 600 people were killed, urges the American government to con­tinue its efforts to solve the Pales­tinian problem through negotiations with all concerned parties.

This ceiling on undergraduate admission is one reason why Notre Dame has not adopted open access admission. Another reason why quotas will probably remain on women's admis­sion is the close relationship of Notre Dame with Saint Mary's Col­lege. 
According to Tyson, Notre Dame's committment to free inquiry and fidelity to the Roman Catholic Church are crucial elements in the school's character, but these priorities are constantly being artic­ulated and interpreted in different

Jesse Jackson, predicted an up­set victory over Wallace as clear skies and mild temperatures in­spired a medium-to-heavy turn-out. 

Wallace, now 63 and confined to a wheelchair since he was shot in an assassination attempt 10 years ago, already has been governor a record three times. But recanting his segregationist stands of old, he resurfaced after a four-year layoff from politics, saying he now represents "the average man and woman, black and white." 
Yesterday's Democratic primary runoff also featured Supreme Court Justice Oscar Adams' bid to become the first black elected to statewide office in Alabama. 
Adams, who was appointed to the court to fill a vacancy in 1980, was opposed by former Public Service CommissionerJim Zeigler. The win­ner meets Republican Tom Hayden in November. 
Wallace, who proclaimed "segregation forever" in his 1963 in­augural and sent troopers after black voting rights marchers two years later, competed with McMillan for black votes this time. 
During the first primary, Wallace 
drew black votes in heavy numbers, 
leading in every predominantly

Wallace, however, countered with the endorsement ofE.D. Nixon, an 82-year-old black man who is known as the patriarch of the civil rights movement in Montgomery. At almost every turn, Wallace said his chiefgoal was to find jobs "for black and white citizens ofAlabama." 
During the Sept. 7 primary, Wallace led with 42 percent of the vote, while McMillan drew 29 per­cent to gain the runoffspot.

. . . Taxes 
continuedfrom page 1 
The IRS is examining 28I,OOO tax returns that appear to involve abusive shelters -generally those that promise little more than a huge tax break. During the past I I months, the agency completed audits of 6I,772 such returns and found what it contends is an S824.3 million tax underpayment -an average of more than SII,OOO per return. 
In his testimony to the Finance Committee, Chapoton said, some discontent with the present tax sys­tem is traceable to the erroneous no­tion that all the tax breaks go to the poor and the rich with nothing for the big middle-income class. Some of the biggest tax breaks, such as those associated with home owner­ship and employer-paid benefits, are widely used by middle-income Americans, he noted. 
Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., chairman of the paneL said, "I am convinced members of this committee are...doing our best to simplify and bring about fairness." One method ofdoing that, he added, would be to continue with the policies con­tained in last year's tax cut and this year's tax increase: cutting rates while taxing more income by eliminating or reducing various deductions.

P.O. BoxQ 
Stereotypes and boxes 
DearEditor, 
As a novice Domer, I have read with inter­est about the "feud" between the ND and SMC women. Mindful of the tradition that freshman are to be seen and not heard, I have invoked a higher decree: Freshman Don't Listen To What They're Told Anyway. 
Stereotypes are almost never complimen­
tary, and the two given for the women ofthe 
ND community are no exception. I cannot 
stand by the statement that they are con­
trived. As a matter ofcourse, stereotypes are 
developed by observation·ofcharacteristics 
thought to be unique to a particular group of 
people, i.e. all SMC women are preps. 
Someone, somewhere made the decisions 
that would typecast the two groups. Who 
knows, it might have happened over a few 
beers at a football game. 
This is to blame the ND men for the 
stereotypes. "The almighty Domer male" is a 
myth. For example, as I am short and slender 
and only mildly athletic I am stereotyped as 
a wimp and a bookworm which makes me 
particularly undesireahle to: surprise! the 
female community. Come on girls, you 
stereotype just as much as the guys do. Un­
fortunately, the negative women's 
stereotypes are more enduring. 
As for a solution, I offer no great nuggets of 
wisdom( remember, I'm a freshman). I was 
told when I got here to be myself. Maybe 
that's the best advice. Don't allow yourselfto 
be stereotyped, girls. 
There is absolutely no reason why ND and 
SMC women can't get along. Are you fighting 
for something you believe in or something 
that was declared under the influence of a 
Miller' Sure, we could have a mud wrestle 
between the St. Mary's Maulers and the 
Domer Dominators or maybe a Perrier chug­
ging contest and a beauty pageant. Uh-huh. 
Go to your corners girls, and don't come out 
until you're ready to junk this feud. Guys, 
let's help them. They're equal members of 
our community and if it isn't done it won't 
be much ofa community anyway. 
Peter Pranica FisherHall 
Dear editor? 

It is with great distress that I read further than the first paragraph in Mike Monk's "Inside Thursday"column (9/23/82). I real­ly thought that Mr. Monk would be able to get out ofthe "little labeled box" he so aptly 
described. Alas it was not to be. 
Since Mr. Monk seems to need labels to 
work with (he uses them so often himself), I consider myself a liberal -indeed, those who tend to do labeling have called me a "bleeding heart." Yet, I don't see all those who fail to register for the draft as heroes, or decadent daisy pickers, either. Not only has Mr. Monk succeeded in boxing up himself, but others as well. And that's not the only box he creates. 
Granted, registering with the Selective 
Service is not slavery or oppression. It is 
what registration can lead to that concerns 
Mr. Sasway. The Armed Forces can certainly 
be oppressive to those who have personal 
and/or religious convictions against combat 
-especially considering how hard it is for 
those who have those convictions to qualify 
for conscientious objector status. More 
boxes, Mr. Monk -some people do 
legitimately find oppression in the Armed 
Forces. 
And unemployment' What happens to the 
previously unemployed when their "hitch" 
is up? Are there any jobs in the private sector 
for tank drivers or cruise missile crews? 
Now, my ·father received his electrical 
engineering training in the Army and it 
served him well. I do not deny that the 
Armed Forces can provide very good voca­
tional training. But more boxes, Mr. Monk ­
such simplistic ideas don't always lead to a 
fairy-tale public policy achievement. 
"...to kill or not to kill..." Mr. Monk makes a 
step out ofhis box(es) here by commenting 
on CO's, and I would agree with his state­
ments (see above). But again, what can 
registration lead to? Even if you don't get an 
M-16 when you're drafted, you are par­
ticipating in an organization which takes the 
lives ofothers as a major function. You sup­
port, in your activities on behalf of that or­
ganization, that function, even ifonly tacitly. 
Mr. Monk took his forward step directly Into 
another box -and I don't do LSD (only piz­
zas) nor am I stupid. 
I have my doubts about the theological 
concept ofa "just war," but I also recognize 
my obligations to the state as a member ofit. 
On such a basis, I wish Mr. Monk would put 
me, and the others whom he indiscriminate­
ly boxes up, in a carton without sides. Why 
don't you join us, sir? The answers aren't as 
easy to find, but at least you can hearwithout 
all that shouting.

A
utumn is ...a change of season -literally. It is the turning ofthe leaves from the cool placid green of spring and summer to the fiery red and orange of the fires to be lit during the frosty chill ofwinter. It is the in-between time ofvear when the circling chill ofthe ~utumn breeze fills out a woman's gathered skirt and rides over her partially covered sandaled feet signalling the need for closed-toed shoes and tightly tailored corduroy or wool garments. It is the time of transition from basketball games with shirtless players vying for the sweat-streaked ball to pick-up football games where grass and mud-stained sweatsuits become the fashion and the pigskin begins to acquire a crusted outer garment ofits own. Autumn is change. 
Autumn is something else ­something inherent to the Notre Dame community. It is memories. 
Halftime at the Notre Dame­Purdue game Saturday was ex­emplary ofthe importance of memories to the campus. We recalled the days ofglory, the I977 National Championship. We rejoiced in the memory of"how sweet it was," to borrow aJackie Gleason cliche. Somehow it would have been less appropriate to recognize and remember in any other season ofthe year besides autumn. 
Why? 

Because deep in the recesses of our "Go, Irish· hearts we hope and pray that this season will he the time of transition from losing to winning; that we will once again rejoice in the moment ofglory and national recognition as we did five years ago. 
Memories pull us through periods of transition. 
Memories of victory on the gridiron pull us through those quar­ters of play when the defense seems to be faltering and our sudden defeat appears imminent. Memories of the warmth ofspring and summer allow us to tolerate, some even to enjoy, the frost ofwinter's snowy playground. 
During the short time ofthe year we call autumn, we are afforded the privilege of watching the transition while we wait. Whereas each foot­ball game shows us the progress being made toward the ultimate goal ofa national championship, each autumnal day offers signs of transi­tion. 
Nature is most exemplary. With each day we observe the gradual fall ofsleep upon the many stately trees that surround the lakes, buildings and pathways ofcampus. Rich lively greens lose their pigment and become the reds, oranges and yel­lows that signify autumn's sleepy presence. The lakes become rest­less, rippling from the force ofthe autumnal breezes. Even the ducks, by their growing silence, remind us that it is time to rest. 
In seeming reaction to the response of nature to autumn's ar­rival, the people of the Notre Dame community take on the appearance of rest. The quads that were once filled with the boisterous sounds of frishec-tlyers assume a quiet, quiet that is hroken only occasionally hy some souls that venture out to play on the cold, half-frozen mud, often ignoring the cold temperatures in favor ofa more suitahle pretense of warmth. 
We feel the change of tem­perature. We hear the impending silence. We watch. And in the meantime ... 
In the meantime, we wait. And rememher. 

The semester hegins to require that we pay more acute attention to our reading assignment -mid-term exams are only a few weeks away. Accidentally we discover that there is a seven to ten page paper on Plato due on Friday in addition to the two hundred and fifty pages of reading. The hall study lounges become the second homes ofsome ofthe dorm's residents. The restless silence oflate August when many a joke could be tolerated in a supposedly quiet study area is replaced by the terse hushes ofserious academians. 
Autumn is here, signalling a time for rest. Like the couple in Twas theNight Before Christmas, we have all begun to settle down for a long winter's nap. 
Heavy-weave sweaters, tlannel­lined jackets, wool slacks and skirts are pulled from the hottom of stashed away Notre Dame boxes. We await with dismay the slushy, icy jacket that will envelope the campus in the coming winter months. But in the furthest recesses ofour minds. we visualize tltt hcach scene that awaits us during spring break. Each day counts toward the next when the sun will be a little warmer and the wind less rampant. Future days occupy our few hut ever-present wandering thoughts. 

Spring will come; we know that. Often when the temperature has just dipped below a tolerable chill we curse the ensuing cold. But there is still hope in the warmth to come. The warmth of the sun will return once again to invite us to play in its presence and glory again in our memories ofthe go,1d times. 
Together we wait. Students, faculty and staff all suffer through broken-down heating systems, raging winds and hot coffee dregs. Things that we normally do col­lectively, (studying, eating, praying) we seem to do with a more intense, unified vigor. There is something important about waiting together. 
Notre Dame in autumn is about remembering and waiting for the new memories to occur. It is hope for the future while we wait in the present.

Ttivia quiz 50 
I 
hoped you enjoyed last week's quiz. I really have been writing this for over two years, and I hope you have had as much fun with it as I have had. 
Tim Neely 
rock trivia 

This week I begin the third vear of the quiz with an all-new topic. :\tore details below. But first ... here are the answers to last week's anniver­sary quiz, on the origins ofgroup names: 
I. San Francisco band took its name from a sick joke about a blues singer -Jefferson Airplane (courtesy of Blind Lemon jefferson) 
2. 
Took its name from the tirst names of Messrs. Anderson and Council -Pink Floyd 

3. 
Named after West Coast utility -Pacific Gas and Electric 

4. 
From Australian aborigine term for a very cold evening -Three Dog 


Night 

5. 
Stole its name from another group which recorded for Capitol ten years before they did -The Knack 

6. 
From British (now also American) slang for "homosexual" -Queen 

7. 
None ofthe original band mem­bers more than five feet, nine inches tall -Small Faces (they dropped the "small" when a much taller Rod Stewart joined the band in the early 


19...,0s) 
H. From the nickname ofa great jazz saxophonist -The Yardbirds (after Charlie Parker) 
9. 
Name from the lead singer's girlfriend's beauty magazine -Loverboy (after seeing the words Cover Girl) 

10. 
From words Winston Chur­chill never said -Blood, Sweat, and Tears (what he actually said was "blood, toil, tears, and sweat") 


This week, as mentioned earlier, I have an original idea, not one I have used before. These are/were ab­breviations in the world ofpopular music. What do the letters stand for' You don't need to explain their sig­nificance; just tell me their literal meaning. Some I have given a brief explanation; the rest, I feel, need 
none. 
I. MCA 
2. ABBA ~. XYZ (circa 1981) 
4. BMl 5.EMI 
6. 
B.T. Express (what does the 'B.T.' mean?) 

7. 
BANG (the record label; I'll bet you didn't know it actually stands for something. ) 


8. The M G 's (of Booker T. and the ... fame) 
9. 
MPL 

10. 
L.T.D. 


Trivia will not appear next Wed­nesday, but in Friday's paper with the special section on The Who, as Mr. Neely will be providing a quiz on thatgroup in celebration of their new album andfinal concert tour. 
.PETE TOWNSHEND 

T 
Poetty in vinyl 
'[)etc Townshend and The Who have been inseparably connected r for so long that it is difficult to consider the work ofone without alluding to the influence of the other; the group has always had Townshend for a guiding force, and he has always drawn heavily on the influence of the group to work out his solo albums. 
All the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes is no exception to the 
rule; but whereas Townshend's last album, Empty Glass, seemed a 
work The Who might have done ifthey had time, this newer work, 
while rife with songs whose musical style and tone hearkens back to 
previous group efforts, is ofitself completely and exclusively Townshend. 
Joe musumeci 
album review 

Townshend has made a name for himselfas a geniu-s ofmusical ar­rangement as well as one ofrock's foremost lyricists; it becomes im­mediately obvious that the latter was his major concern onEyes. Not that the music is dissappointing -in fact, two or three cuts belong in the Townshend hall offame. But the lyrics ofevery song are of such consistenrly high quality that the lyric sheet could survive on its own as a work ofliterature. 
Townshend recognizes this, and rather than singing all the lyrics on the album (and he does this with his usual skill for rock vocaliz­ing) t reverts to a sort ofjim Morrison/Moody Blues technique and more or less chants some ofthe most resounding passages in anal­most eerie voice. 
I would like to quote from the lyrics, but find I cannot do so meaningfully; to do so would require more space than this review permits, for each song is so well constructed as to prohibit taking one or two lines out ofcontext. Townshend, like any good poet, has a marvelous facility of rhyme; but also, he has the common sense to know that lines need not rhyme to be musically practical. The 
songs are all loosely tied together through the theme ofevery man's importance in the world and the effect his lifestyle has on the degree ofthat importance. In the second cut, "The Sea Refuses No River". an image oflife as a flowing river is instigated, and it reasserts itself subt­ly throughout the length of the album. 
Musically, the album is a cornucopia ofstylistic flavors. Towshend takes a few new looks at his direction as a composer, as well as reexamining some old sounds from previous Who collections. The aforementioned "The Sea ..."seems a new attack on the melodious­ly soft approach common toThe Who by Numbers; a well-modulated harmonica in the background of the piece conjures up almost tan­gible images of the title. One song alludes to its origin in the title: "Face Dances II", and indeed, it might have worked better in the last group album than some material that was included therein. The song begins with a wonderfully light-hearted keyboard run that reminds one of the intro to that album's "Making records". "Exquisitely Bored" is one ofthe best tunes on the album, a sort of"Hotel Califor­nia" from a different point ofview; the sound is reminiscent ofWho Are You with just a touch ofEmpty Glass thrown in for good measure. It is in this cut that the infamous guitar chords are most evi­dent, still effective but played beneath the excellent keyboard work. 
It is here one realizes that Townshend, renowned as one of the greatest rock guitarists in the industry, has begun to be much more interested in the possibilities ofthe keyboard in his compositions. In Empty Glass, the synthesizer found itselfa major part ofthe or­chestration, but it was in Face Dances that the piano and keyboard picked up most ofthe melodies. In Chinese Eyes this approach has 
taken full root, and while the guitar work is still interesting and as 
competent as one might expect, it is the keyboard which forms the 
backbone ofthis album. 

Altogether, whether one sees it as a new approach from an old master, a precursor ofthe new group album, ora masterpiece ofrock lyricism,AI/ the BestCowboys Have Chinese Eyes is one ofthe most interesting and worthwhile albums ofthe year

Digger Phelps has once again beaten the competition in the recruiting game. At least as far as time is concerned. Phelps received a verbal commitment from a basket­ball recruit yesterday, the first high school senior to announce his inten­tions. 
The player is John Bowens, a 6-8 forward from Warren, Pa. Bowens averaged 27.3 points per game over the three years of his high school career to ths point. 
"We are real happy that John has decided to attend Notre. Dame," Phelps said. "We think he's the kind ofplayer and, more importantly, the kind of person that will fit in well here." 
The 220-pound Bowens is cur­rently 16th on the all-time Pennsyl­vania schoolboy scoring list. With 2,208 points thus far, he could break the 3,000 point barrier by the end of the season. That would place him behind only Tom McMillen of Mansfield High, who later went on to a great career at Maryland and in the NBA. 
Bowens visited Notre Dame last 
weekend, and_ quickly decided on 
Notre Dame. He plans to sign a na­
tional letter of intent on Nov. 20. 
That is the first day the NCAA allows 
players to commit themselves to any 
institution. 
Bowens has pulled down I,624 career rebounds ·in three years at Warren Area High School -an unof­ficial Pennsylvania record. He averages over 20 rebounds per game. He also shoots roughly 62 per­cent from both the field and the floor. 
Last year, Phelps got the nation's first verbal commitment when Jim Dolan .of Thorn's River, N.J. an­nounced his intention to attend Notre Dame. Dolan was the first of five players who eventually signed with the Fighting Irish, and entered Notre Dame as freshmen this faiL

opener. ii~iiii~iiiiiiii~~~~~~~~~;;iiii~;iiiiii
The Irish were led by three freshmen who combined . _ __ 1 
to score II of the team's 14 goals. Mike Roberts was deadly on offense as he scored six times against a porous Purdue defense. Fellow first-year player Steve Blaha had three goals and Sean Farley added two more. Grad studentJim Mills tallied two goals and junior Mike Erhard also had one to finish the scoring for the Irish. 
Notre Dame jumped out to a quick 4-0 lead at the end of the first quarter and increased the lead to 8-1 by halftime. After each team scored once in the third quar­ter, Purdue was able to make the score respectable with five goals in the final period against the Irish reserves. Notre Dame was able to play all 19 ofthe players on the team -a feat rarely seen, especially in season openers. The team travels to Loyola of Chicago this weekend 
for an invitational tournament. 
RUGBY -The rugby team overcame some early­
game sluggishness to earn a come-from-behind 9·7 vic­
tory over Purdue last Saturday. 
After Purdue had made a four-point try to open the scoring, Brian Moynihan scored for the Irish to even the count at 4-4. Notre Dame took advantage of the Boiler­maker's earlier missed extra point and took the lead 6-4 on Steve Schneider's successful conversion. Schneider later added a penalty kick to give the Irish a 9-4 edge before Purdue added a three-point-kick late in the match for the final score. Moynihan had another excel­lent game and Tom "Tex" Fallon played brilliantly in crucial situations. He continuously got free for long runs to get the team out trouble. 
The A team is now 3-0 on the season and will travel to Marquette on Saturday for what will probably be their toughest lll_atch ofthe year. 

The B team played valiantly against Battle Creek's A side before losing 22-10. The match.was actually much closer than the score indicates as the B squad was able to stay in the game against the much more experienced Battle Creek team until late in the match. 
The C team had the upset of the weekend as they suprised Purdue's B team I 0-8. John Tuskey scored on two penalty kicks late in the game to raise the C side's mark to 2-1. 
CROSS COUNTRY -The women's cross country 
team had a disappointing tournament in the rain at East. 
ern Michigan on Saturday as only two runners broke the 
20-minute mark. Maria Fiore led the Irish with a with a 
time of 19:24 and a 16th place finish over the 5000 
meter course. Teammate Anne Attea covered the 
course in 19:4 7 and wound up 26th in the field ofmore 
than forty runners. 

While part ofthe team was sloshing through the mud 
in Michigan, the rest ofthe women were competing in a 
meet at Manchester College against three other 
schools. Gina Ochsner paced the Irish with an lith­
place finish with Susan Wanchow coming in 16th and 
Lorie Keating following her. · 
The team will travel back to Manchester on Friday for 
?-!!eight-team meet. 

SOCCER -The women's B team dropped its record to 0-2 as they fell 5-0 to St. Mary's on Sunday. With 15 minutes left, the score was still close at 1-0. But St. Mary's was able to put on a late-game offensive surge and score four more goals in the closing minutes to hand the team its second loss in as many games. 
The A team was idle this week.

Owners unfair 
Ruling favqrs NFL players 

WASHINGTON (AP) -A labor law judge yesterday ruled in favor of the National Football League Players Association in its effort to force the NFL to open some of its records to union negotiators seeking a new contract. 
Administrative Law Judge Julius Cohn held that the NFL Management
' 
Council, the league's bargaining
t 
agent, had violated the National Labor Relations Act by refusing to furnish the players' union wi.th in­dividual player contracts and the 
! r 
non-monetary provisions of TV and network radio contracts. The 14-page ruling stems from three days of hearings that Cohn 
r held in June, approximately three weeks before the players' associa­tion contract with the NFL expired. 
In ruling that the league has vi­olated the law, Cohn thus upheld the player association's unfair labor practice charge and has recom­mended to the full five-member Na­tional Labor Relations Board that the league be ordered to turn over the documents to the union. 
The decision by Cohn maybe ap­pealed by management to the full NLRB for review and a final decision. 
.,· 
The league's 1,500 players struck the NFL on Sept. 21, claiming the owners' failure to bargain in good faith had forced the strike. 
"It's only a recommendation. The board didn't seek an order to turn over the financial arrangements in the television t contact that players sought. Certainly, that's the major thing the players were after," said Jim Miller, a spokesman for the NFL Management Council, ' which handles the league's negotiations with the union. "These things are routinely overruled all the time. We feel confident it will be overruled this time. 
"This is not such a major thing. The timing seems bad because we are ready to go into another negotiating session. The players al­ready have examined playet con­tracts, which they've been given the right to see again by the board." 
But Ed Garvey, executive director of the NFLPA, felt it was a significant decision. 
"We were extremely pleased," Garvey said ofthe decision. 
"It's important because we are alleging that this is an unfair labor practice strike and we think this is

the first step in proving this allega­
tion. It's a nice, clear signal to all the 
owners that this is a serious step 
toward establishing this as an unfair 
labor practice strike," Garvey said. 
Garvey noted that under federal 
labor law, management may not 
replace employees whose strike 
have been declared the result of an 
unfair labor practice by their 
employers 

Negotiations on a new collective 
bargaining agreement are scheduled 
t resume in Washington, D.C. on 
tomorrow afternoon. 

To date, 14 regular season games 
have been wiped out by the strike, 
the first in-season walkout in the 
league's history. 

"It is well settled that the duty of 
an employer to bargain in good faith 
includes the obligation to disclose 
to its employees' collective bargain­
ing representative data that are 
relevant and reasonably necessary 
to its role as bargaining agent," Cohn 
said in the 14-page decision.

Negotiations on a new collective bargaining agreement are scheduled to resume in Washington, D.C. tomorrow afternoon. 
To date, 14 regular season games have been wiped out by the strike, the first in-season walkout in the league's history. 
In his decision, Cohn noted that 
Ed Garvey, executive director ofthe 
NFLPA, had writtenJack Donlan, the 
owners' chiefnegotiator, on May 13, 
1981, aking for the information on 
player contracts and pacts the 
league has with the commercial 
television networks. 

" ... It is clear that this informa­
tion with respect to employees 
wages is presumptively relevant and 
therefore specific relevance need 
not be shown," Cohn said. 

The judge noted that the league's 
principal argument in withholding 
the documents is that the union had 
waived its rights to obtain copies,

The Saint Mary's Tennis Belles have done it again. They had an easy victory yesterday against Manches­ter College, winning 9-0. The team switched the usual roster just a little to give all members of the team a chance to play. 
Heather Temofew, at first singles, defeated Celena Crume 6-2, 6-1. Christen Beck, at second singles, defeated Wendy Hilligoss 6-1, 6-0. Kim Kaigi, at third singles, won 6-I, 6-3 over Janice Stryker. Allison Pel­lar, at fourth singles, beat Tracy Price 6-1,6-3. Maureen La Fountain, at fifth singles, beat Christy Crogan 6-0, 6-7, 6-0. Freshman Karie Casey hung onto a three-set match to defeat Cindy Petry 2-6, 6-4, 7-5. Coach Killeen was pleased at her fine co t meback. 
The doubles teams were also vic­torious. The first doubles team ofBe­ck and Pellar defeated Crume and Hilligross 7-5, 6-3. Temofew and Kaigi, playing second doubles, defeated Strycker and Price 6-1, 6-3. Diane Schnell and Michelle Spinoza, playing third doubles in their first match ofthe season, were victorious over Crogan and Petry 6-1, 7-5. 
Coach Killeen was pleased with the girls' playing and is looking for­ward to the match today against Taylor University in Uplands, In­diana at 5 pm.

"I can't pronounce his name, but those statistics are enough for me," laughed Faust. "All I have to know is his number." 
Faust knows a lot about Michigan State because they remind him of last year's Irish -the Spartans have lost three straight games that could have been won with a break here or there. 
"They lost to 19th-ranked Illinois ( 2 3-16 ), but time ran out on them as they were about to score. They lost to 13th-ranked Ohio State ( 31-10 ), but the score was tied going into the fourth quarter. And they lost to 16th-ranked Miami (25-22), who got a touchdown with less than 30 seconds to go, and we all know how tough it is to play Miami down there. Michigan State is ready to jell, and I just hope they do it after we play them."

Irish dominate NCAAstat sheet 

CARTER ADVANCES -Against Purdue, tailback Phil Carter 
carried the ball 27 times for 155 yards and two touchdowns. This 
performance moved the senior tri-captain into eighth place on the 
NO career rushing list with 1,904 yards. Vagas Ferguson is the Irish 
leader in this department with 673 carries for 3472 yards. 
Carter returns to the scene of his finest Irish performance ever as 
the team travels to Michigan State's Spartan Stadium, where two 
years ago he carried the ball a record 40 times for 254 yards. The 
40th carry lost yardage and dropped Carter below the single game 
record of255 yards. On the same play Carter suffered a severe thigh 
bruise which limited his action for over a month. 
CAMPBELL PERFORMS -Purdue's quarterback Scott Campbell has done exceptionallywell against Notre Dame. In three games the junior has completed S3 of 89 passes for 702 yards and four touch­downs, despite losing two ofthe three games played. 
DEFENSE DELIVERS -The Notre Dame defense held Purdue to a measly net total of 11 yards rushing after holding Michigan to just 41 yards on the ground. That translates into a 26-yards-per-game average, and makes the Irish No. I in the nation in the latest NCAA rushing defense statistics. ND is 14th in total defense. 
GETTING THE TIME -Notre Dame's offensive line has been doing a number on its opposition this season. Quarterback Blair Kiel has been given the time to look for alternative receivers and has been completing his passes at 61 percent efficiencv. The team has rushed for 566 yards in two games, with much ofth~ credit going to the line ofLarry Williams, Tom Thayer, Mark Fischer, Randy Ellis and Mike Kelley. Games are won and lost in the trenches, and this unit is gaining the confidence and the consistency needed to win. 
AGA~NST THE SPARTANS-The Irish have only recently begun 
to dommate the Michigan State series, which dates back to 1897, by 
taking 12 ofthe last 13 ball games, to bring the series record 30-16-1. 
Currently the Irish are on a six-game winning streak, with their last 
loss to the Spartans in 1975 -a l 0-3 decision that marked the first 
defeat for then-new coach Dan Devine. 
Michigan State owns a home record against the Irish of 8-;-1, but 
Notre Dame has taken the last six contests played in Ea'>t Lansing, last 
losing i!l 1968, 21-1 7. 

STRENGTH OF SCHEDULE -Notre Dame's current schedule is 
ranked the third toughest in the nation by the NCAA. The NCAA 
rates schedules based on team records from last season. Only Florida 
State and Utah have more difficult schedules. 
Michigan State's schedule is no easy path in itself. The Spartans are 
playing their fourth game this season against an AP Top Twenty op­
ponent. They have suffered losses at the hands of Illinois, Ohio State 
and Miami coming into this week's game with the Irish. 
Fdur NO opponents appear in this week's poll. They are Pitt, Penn 
State, Miami and Southern Cal. 
SECONDARY WOES-For the third week the Notre Dame secon­
dary will be severely tested by a good quarterback. Spartan quarter­
back John Leister has completed 40 throws in 97 attempts this 
season for 538 yards. His primary receiver has been Otis Grant, who 
has 14 catches for 268 yu.rds and two touchdowns. 
Leister threw for 204 yards against the Irish in 1980, the last time 
the two teams met in East Lansing. On that day, NO escaped with a 
26-21 victory, but the outcome was in doubt until the final gun as 25 
points went up onto the scoreboard in the final 10 minutes ofplay. 
Michigan State's ground game will also test the Irish defense as 
senior Tony Ellis enters Saturday's game with 197 yards on 39 
carries. Ellis is backed up by sophomore Aaron Roberts who has 100 
yards on 30 carries despite missing la'it week's game with sore ribs. 
GETTING THE FIRST -The Notre Dame offense has been converting on third down this year at 39 percent efficiencv -as compared to just 29 percent la-;t season. The Irish have made 4o first downs already this sea.,on after making only 177 in 1 I games last fall. 
BY THE NUMBERS-Notre Dame holds a prominent place in this week's NCAA stats: 
Larry 
Moriarty is 11th in rushing at 110 yards per game, and ranks 19th in scoring at nine points per game. 

Phil 
Carter is 16th in rushing at 105 yards per game. 

Tony 
Hunter is II th in receiving at 5. 5 receptions per game. 

Blair 
Kiel is tied for 20th in punting with a 4.2.5 yard average. 

 
Mike Johnston is tied for 16th in field goals with 1.5 per game. 

Notre 
Dame ranks 7th in rushing offense at 283 yards per game. 


BRAINS AND BRAWN-At Notre Dame 95 percent ofthe foot hall players obtain a degree. The 1977 National Championship team, which held its five-year reunion this past weekend, wa'> no different. At least seven members from that team are still proving that brains and football ability are not mutually exclusive. Ken MacAfee. andjoe Restic are in dental school, and john Leon, Dave Vinson.
