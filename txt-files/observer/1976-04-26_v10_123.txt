An Tostal. the annual Irish spring festival, is a 
weekend of "fun and frivolity," and this year at Notre 
Dame it was ··a tremendous success,'' accoridng to 
Bob Quakenbush, An Tostal executive committee 
chairman. 
"Keep the show going." was the An Tostal staff's 
unoflicial motto, and. although the weather was 
threatening throughout much of the weekend. most 
at'livities went ahead as planned. 
"We were fortunate with the weather," Quaken· 
hu!>h commented. "The rain was well-placed. It 
rained on Fridav night. when most of the activities 
were inside arivway, and the rain on Saturday 
afternoon didn .,-spoil the activities in the mud." he 
remarked. 
Gentle Thursday 
The festival began on "gentle Thursday" with the Trivia Bowl. held on the South Quad before a crowd of 
over 200 people. Contestants went through six rounds 
of trivia questions. with remaining participants 
winning special An Tostal mugs. 
Next on the agenda was a "Jock's vs. Girls" basketball game, played before a capacity crowd behind the bookstore. The girls defeated the jocks. who were slightly handicapped by boxing gloves. The frequent antics of the players and referees often broke the crowd up with laughter. 
After the game, a hungry group of students moved over to St. Mary's for a large An Tostal barbeque. At the ~amc time, the semi-final round of the Bookstore Basketball Tournament was being played on the hoohtore court. 
I hat evening several other events were held on the North Quad. A Chicago band. "Sahara", played throughout the entire evening. complementing the other al'livitics. A jail was set up in the middle of the quad to hold the captives of student "vigilantes". For a quarter. a person could impriso_n ~nothcr student, and the captive was able to buy hrs freedom only by bribing the jailer with fifty cents or by subm_itting to a barrage of pies, bought by spectators at a ~rme ea~h. 
A dunking booth was also set up on the quao.. Bystanders purchased baseballs and attempted to htt a small target. Good shots were rewarded by dunking such celebrities as Mike Gassman, Candy O'Connor In the group grope, several couples were blindfold­
ed, spun around, and allowed to feel around for their 
mate. The funcathlon was a strange form of 
Olympics, with teams of contestants nvolved in 
unusual races and other events. In the unusual object 
contest. participants brought in the strangest 'm 
they could find. The winning object was a coat rack 
made out of three deer's hooves. 
The climax of the evening was the Mr. Campus 
contest. About 400 people watched the event which 
was held on a special lighted walkway constructed in 
front of Sorin Hall. 
The winner of the contest was Tom Young, a senior from Cavanaugh Hall, who mimicked Tom Jones as his display of talent. The crowd went into an uproar when Young appeared on stage for the swimsuit competition with two bikini-clad women. This performance earned him the top place in the swimsuit contest. 
Tom Maschmeier, a senior from St. Ed. 'sHall, took second place with an imitation of a "seductive" woman. His evening gown earned him first place in the evening wear divison. 
Frivolous Friday 
Despite a late afternoon rainstrom that drenched bookstore basketball finals and caused the "jam­ming" competition to be cancelled. Frivolous Friday was ''a big success,'' according to Mike Casey, Friday co-chairman. 
Beginning at 1 p.m. with a giant sack race and lasting until midnight with Recess 176, Friday was full of games. These games included an Pgg toss, a jello toss. in which one player attempted to throw a block of jello in the mouth of his partner, an Aaron Burr-Alexander Hamilton-style water balloon duel, car stuffying. a keg toss, impersonation and amateur hour competitions, and the most popular event, the tinals of the bookstore basketball tournament. 
"The early events weren't that well attended," Casey commented, "because people were going to classes. They didn't want to join in because they might mess up their clothes but I was surprised with the turnout anyway, especially at the egg toss." 
The line of participants for the egg toss, the second event, the jello toss and the water balloon duel stretched across the width of the South Quad, where Friday's events took place, and thirty people stuffed themselves into a car to win the car stuffing contest. 
"The keg tosswas one of the biggest attractions of the afternoon," Casey said. "It was really exciting to see those guys throwing those big kegs around, especially when Ross Browner threw one wide, into the crowd."

Pennsylvania primary slated for tomorrow 
PHILADELPHIA (AP) -Two Democratic presidentail candidates said yesterday President Ford want s to delay the revival of federal campaign subsidies because he doesn't need the money for his own Republican race. 
But Jimmy Carter said Congress was at fault and predicted the aid probably won't be restored before the primary elections are over. 
Carter, Sen. Henry M. Jackson of Washington, Rep. Morris K. Udall of Arizona, Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace and Sen. Frank Church of Idaho spent an hour answering questions on a national­ly televised interview program. All but Church are on tl:l.e ballot in Pennsylvania's presidential pri­mary tomorrow although Wallace complained that his candidacy is not getting proper attention. 
"I wish that the national news would dictate that I am a candidate , " he said. " ...I want the people of Pennsylvania to know I am running." 
Most of what the candidates had to say in their joint appearance on the ABC-TV program "Issues and Answers" was in restatement of positions and forecasts that they have been discussing on campaign platforms. There was a moment's confrontation between Jackson and Carter over salary scales and the union shop in the South. 
The former Georgia governor insisted workers in his part of the country are paid wages comparable to those in other regions. Jackson scoffed at the claim. 
But the five-man show was hardly a deba te. When it ended, Carter, Jackson and Udall went back to their personal vote-hunting on a rainy, chilly day. Wallace already has concluded a brief Pennsylvania compaign. Church is not entered in primaries for anothr two weeks, running first on May II in Nebraska. 
Carter was campaigning in the Pittsburgh area; Udall met with black supporters and then went to work on a five-minute speech he is to give on national television tonight, and Jackson went to Harrisburg for a private fund rasing meeting. 
All three candidates have com­plained about the lapse of federal campaign sabsidy funds, cut off for more than a month because of congressional inactin after the Su­preme Court rules that the Federal 
Election  Commission,  which  su­ 
pervises  the  campaign  aid,  was  
improperly appointed.  

A bill to revive the election commission is expected to gain passage this week, but the Presi­dent has not said whether he will sign it. Republican congressional leaders have said there is a risk of veto because Congress revised the campaign spending law instead of simply reconstituting the election commission. 
Presidential candidates of both parties have a total of more than $2.5 million in subsidy claims awaiting approval by the commis­sion, once it gets into business again.

Still, Fitzgerald takes a low key appraod1 on his outstanding trans­fer. "We're not building the team around Best. We're building the team around the best 22 players. Art has demonstrated he can be one of them," said the coach. 
It's ironic that Best should wind up at Kent State since he signed a conference letter of intent before going to Notre Dame. 
This time Kent won out over Georgia Tech, Miami, Fla, and Tennessee because of its architec­ture school and a two-year scholar­ship for a single season of eligibili­ty.

Dom Famuele, a JUntor trom Morrissey Hall won the impersona­tions contest for the second year in a row with his impressions of characters ranging from Howard Cosell and Ed Sullivan to campus personalities such as Fr. Robert "Griff" Griffin. Second place was taken by Terry McHale, a junior from Zahm Hall, who along with four others, imitated Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones. 
The crowd's favorite performer, however, was not a Notre Dame student, but a 31-year old man named Mark Ludwig, whom the emcee introduced as from Misha­
waka. Ludwig, who at first would not perform, briefly imitated 
Professor's son found dead 
Donald Duck, then stomped of the stage, hollering. The crowd roared with laughter, and kept calling for Ludwig to return throughout the remaindrr of the show. Ludwig failed to repeat his performance. 
Although the sky hadclouded by late afternoon, threatening weather did not drive away bookstore basketball fans, who climbed trees, 
ladders, the roof of the bookstore and whatever else they could find to see the final game of the between the TILCS 

and the Average White Team. 

Rainfal began shortly before the half of the game. but the spectators remained to see the TILCS win in a driving rain. The award for the "jamming" or "dunking" compe­tition, which was to follow the game but was cancelled due to the rain, will be given to Bill Laim­beer, who had the most dunks in the tournament.

Huttinger to replace Johnson 
Senior Bar changes hands 
by Frank Tennant Staff Reporter 

Gil -Johnson. manager of the Senior Bar. announced the mana­gers for the upcoming year yester­day. Chuck Hullinger will replace Johnson as bar manager. with Jim O'Connell and Rich Johnson as his assistants. 
Huttinger is a junior accounting major from New Kensington, Pa. He operated food sales in Fisher Hall this year and will be head manager. i{ich Johnson is a fifth­year Architecture-Civil Engineer­ing student from Havertown, Pa. .Johnson worked as a carder and bartender at the bar this year and will he promotions manager. 0'­Connell. a junior English major from Washington. D.C .. will be bar managl'r. O'Connell was bar man­ager of a Wall's Drug Store in South Dakota. 
Twenty-nine students applied for the jobs. The selection process con~isted of submitting an applica­tion and three recommendations to the prcsl·nt managers. .Johnson said they interviewed all appli­cants. A list of Sl'Ven names were sent to Fr. Lally at Stlllknt Affairs. 
who chose the ·trio. 
''The most important thing for the new managers is that they will be starting off without any debt," said Gil Johnson. He revealed that a debt of $7,000 was paid off and a $3000 tire escape was financed by this year's operations. 
In addition to this, the Senior Bar donated $2,500 to the Senior Emer­gency Fund. Johnson said this money was given to Fr. Hesburgh and June McCauslin, financial aid officer. will grant the money on a financial need basis to seniors next year. 
''Although it seems like we made a lot of money this year, we lose money on every beer we pour now," said Johnson. He explained that enough money was made on bar cards to make a cushion to fall hack on at the end of the year. He eitcd this as the reason why the price of beer was not lowered at the beginning of the year. 
Hullinger said. "We want to continue the success of this year by providing just as enjoyable a place for seniors to get together next year." He said their main concern is to improve the general appear­ance of the bar. inside and out. 
Rich Johnson revealed two major changes he wants to effect next year. First, he hopes to have someone operate a food sales, including pizza, at the bar. He said. "It will be a nice place to bring a date and have something to eat and drink." 

The second change will be an additional bar in the smaller room behind the fireplace. Food sales will be locatecf in this room. 
''The prima y concern is to make the best use t · every room in the building," Joh 1son said. They will move the televi3ion upstairs to ease the traffic flow. He noted the dooce floor will be a flexible area with the possibility of campus talent play­ing. 
''The idea is to give the bar the ability to easily change its atmos­phere from night to night," he explained. 
O'Connell said his major concern is streamlining operations to make them more efficient. For example, he would like to reduce the number of companies from which the bar orders. 
General maintenance is the maj­or job O'Connell sees ahead of himself. The bar has not had to be renovated in two years and much work needs to be done.

The final event of the day was Recess 176, a continuation of Recess 101 last year. The affair included jumping rope and other childhood games and an ice cream-eating contest. 
Swmy Saturday 
"Sunny Saturday" turned out to be "Muddy" Saturday, for many students, with most of the day's events taking place in the mud field across the street from Stepan Center. 
The highlight of the day was the announcement that "Beppo" Guido, a junior from Holy Cross Hall, had been voted "Ugly Man on Campus.'' Guido, who received 49,313 votes, finsihed ahead of ''Ace'' Harris the second place winner with 32,675 votes and J.J. DeCoursey who took third place with 21,064 votes. ­
"We had a big problem with people who wanted to get into the mud pits before it was planned to,'' Pa-ula Griffin, Saturday co-chair­man commented, "and this was the hardest it's ever rained, but there was a big crowd and as long as everybody was having a good time and coming to it, the day was a success," she said. 
The day began early for partici­pants in the decathlon, who compe­ted in ten different events, includ­ing golf, swimming, jogging, ice skating, basketball and other sports starting at 6:30 a.m. Joe O'Neill, a sophomore from Pang­born Hall, won the decathalon, with Scott Jessup, junior, Paul Blum, a graduate student, and John Hedges, senior, finishing behind O'Neill in that order. 
Winners of the chariot race was a team headed by Randy Hadley, a graduate student, with second place taken by a team from Keenan Hall, led by senior Jerry Welch. The Observer team defeated Stu­dent Government in mud soccer, and Karen Zagrocki and Ellen Lawlor, St. Mary's students won the An Tostal scavenger hunt, coming up with items such as ice cubes still frozen, a "Monkee's" single, Senior Class President Au­gie Grace's autograph, and a January Observer. 
The tug-of-war, which took place in another rainstorm, turned into a free-for-all. as the last ourdoor event of the festival. Many of the students who were watching the event joined the teams and ended up being thrown into the pit. 
After the final event, many students participated in a sponta­neous "swimming contest" in St. Joe's Lake.

an electronic slide rule you can program com­pletely. The reason: It 

solves repetitive problems easily and quickly. Here's how. Switch to PRGM. 
Enter the keystrokes you need to solve your problem once and then flip the PRGM switch to RUN. That's it. The only thing you have to do for each iteration from then on is enter your variables and press the R/S (Run/ Stop) key. It's that simple. 
The result: Repetitive problems are no longer a repetitive problem. 
But that's only part of the HP-25 story. Here's more. You can add to, check or edit your programs at will. You can also write one­second interruptions into your program in case you want to note intermediate answers. 
And because the keycodes of all prefixed functions are merged, the 49-step program memory can actually store up to 147 key­strokes. (How's that for a memory capacity!) What's more, you can store numbers in eight data registers and perform 7 2preprogrammed functions and operations (logs, trig, mean deviations, rectangular-polar conversions, summations-you name it). Not to mention RPN logic; fixed decimal, scientific and engineering notation; and much, much more. 
In fact, if you wanted to know all the HP-25 can do for you it would take a book. But don't worry, we've already written one­125 pages-worth -just chock full of applica­tions programs and problem solutions. Such as Algebra and Number Theory, Numerical Methods, Statistics-even Games. In detail. 
The HP·25: Just $165!< 
And don't forget the best news. The price. The HP-25 was an exceptional value at $195. Right now it's an out-and-out bargain at $165:~ 
The HP-25. There's never been a calcu­lator with this kind of capability at this kind of a low price before, with HP's name on it. And you know what that means. Design, performance and a back up support system you just can't get anywhere else. 
The HP-25 is almost certainly available at your college bookstore. If not, call 800·538·7922. (In Calif. 800·662-9862) toll-free to find out the name of your nearest

Throughout the weekend, An Tostal assassins were at work throwing pies in the faces of unsuspecting victims. According to assistant assassin Jo Ann Stu­ber, upwards of sixty pies were delivered. 
Every year, according to Quak­enbush, the Jim E. Brogan award is given to the hall or organization which contributes most to the success of An Tostal. This year the award went to Brian Dowe and Steve Callahan, who were in charge of physical arrangements for the weekend.

of the contest on a two-out single
by first baseman Mitch Stoltz in the eighth inning which drove in Dave Lazzcri from third base. After a ground out and a strike out to open the eighth inning,
freshman second baseman Lazzeri grounded a single to ccn~r and went to third on another single into left by Tom Walbrun. Stoltz then stepped up and on the first pitch lined his game-winning single to c·enter to give the Irish their tirst victory after a seven game losing

The game was marked by strong pit<'hing performances by Notre Dame's Hob Stratta and Bethel's .Joe Leatherman, a right handed

and struck out three, while Leath­l'rman allowed but five hits until the eighth inning. 
Stratta's tine pitching was back­ed up by the errorless fielding and two double plays by the Irish infield despite poor field conditions. Rick Pullano and second baseman Frank Fiaski turned in double plays in the

Batton, TILCS leave AWT at altar 
by Rich Odioso As the rain fell harder on the Bookstore finals Friday, Dave Bat­ton's shooting percentage rose like an avenging tide, sweeping TILCS to a 22-20 victory over Average White Team. TILCS thus requited a quarter final defeat a year ago and left AWT a soggy bridesmaid for the second consecutive year. "If anything I guess the rain made me shoot better.'' said Batton. "I think it mainly affected the people who tried to drive and dribble." One dribble and drive that didn't seem affected was a shifting lay-up bv TILCS' Tom Kirbv late in the g;1me. The picture-perfect drive ~1round Kevin Dohe1 ty tied the e·,mtest at 19-19 after TILCS had trailed by two and three throughout· most of the second half. Batton then defeated the A' IT defense, the swirling wind, am the pelting rain for a pair of oub1de shots to more than offset a Doherty mortar shot that. as usual, disappeared  The first half, played in a moderate drizzle, was close and hard fought as AWT moved to an 11-10 lead. Average White opened up a second half lead as large as 17-14. Then Batton hit a pair of free throws and started his outside barrage. "It certainly was a thrill to win the tourney," said Dave, a unani­mous choice as MVP. "It's the type of tourney you really get excited about. After it was over we just hugged each other even though it was raining and we were all wet. We really wanted it." Batton's shooting was off in the first half and midway through it he turned his ankle. It was here that the yeoman work of Dubenetzky on the boards kept AWT from assum­ing command. "The ankle really hurt at first but as the game got near the end and the adrenalin started flowing I just put it out of my mind," said Batton. Posedion Adventure claimed the consolation game from the Nut­meggers 21-16.  Dave Kelly scoreless...John Dube­netzky of TILCS also deserves special mention for his consistently fine play... Batton delighted the crowd when he held up his finger at the free throw line to measure the wind and the rain late in the final ...The dunking contest was a victim of the elements.

Bat­ton is the first varsity player since John Shumate in the tourney's first year to win the MVP Award...tour­ney director Tim Bourret and his staff deserve one final mention for their conscientious work through­out the tourney that made this year's Bookstore the biggest and best yet...Rick's Picks were 20 of 23 on the tournament but gagged on the final and consolation...Jeff  ,.........................................................................,1 Bookscores ~ !TILCS FG-FGA FT-FTA REBS PTS I ~ ~ Kelly 0-J 0-0 3 0 DubenctLky 4-10 1-1 13 s Batton 9-24 2-J 13 II Sahm 4-13 0-1 4 4 Kirby 2-8 0-1 2 19-58 3-h 35 22 AWT FG-FGA FT-FTA REBS PTS Paterno 4-1:' 0-1 4 Horton 3-S 0-0 6 J l'nhlen 5-9 0-0 8 5 Doherty 7-14 0-0 3 7 Sullivan 1-9 0-0 2 6  
into the low-hanging clouds before plunging safely through the rim. Down 21-20, AWT's attempt to tie the score was foiled by a rain-induced turnover. Batton's bid to win with a third straight jumper was off the mark but John Dube­netzky grabbed the rebound and powered home the winning basket.  BOOKSTORE BANTER -The AWT Sports Information Office set a Bookstore first with its distribu­tion of a "Kurt Horton for Mr. Bookstore" flyer. Horton was pos­sible the steadiest performer in the entire tournament, shooting over SO percent.
