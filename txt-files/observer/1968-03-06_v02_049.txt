The Notre Dame Counseling 

Center, under the direction of Rev. Joseph Simons, C.S.C., is organizing group discussions on the subject of conscientious ob­jection. The sessions will begin as soon as enough have expressed an interest. Those who wish to participate should sign up in the Counseling Center office on the third floor of the Administra­tion Building. 
Business Tearn To Games 
Four senior management ma­jors will represent ND in Emory University's annual Intercollegi­ate Business Games this week­end in Atlanta, Georgia. The four, Pete Conley, Bob Roberts, Dan Shannon, and Steve Van Voorhis, will compete against 
four man teams from 39 other schools. 

The Emory games have been in process since December with distant teams participating by teletype. Notre Dame's team, selected by Management Dept. faculty, is leading the five teams in its industry. The 40 compe­ting teams have been divided into eight industries. 
The 40 teams will also be competing against a computer. The ND team has competed for the past two years in Notre Dame's INTOP (International Op­erations Simulation) game. 
INTOP, developed by the University of Chicago, is the frrst management game specifi­cally directed towards the prob­lems of international trade and overseas operations. It forces players to make truly entrepre­neurial decisions of business phil­osophy and objectives. The Em­ory games are similar to INTOP. 

Crosson Publishes 
The papers presented at ND's Centennial of Science Colloqui­um in 1965 have been published under the editorship of Prof. Frederick Crosson of the general program. Contributors to Science and Contemporary Society in­clude Notre Dame professors Mi­chael Crowe and Milton Burton. Dr. Crosson's book explores the current relation between science and society and analyzes the is­sues involved between science and religion.

Seitz Criticizes Universities 

"next to of course god" "The modern day university a battleground for social issues." "do creative work and make is the recipient of the anarchistic "Our universities have become critical decisions." He stated that 
·-Although next November's presidential elections will be uncom-and nihilistic components of our subject to disruptive elements, since science students are more 
fortable for Lyndon Johnson (the '64 peace candidate will have to 
~xplain the inconsistency which is Vietnam), the elections benefit 
'lim in one significant sense. Terry Southern said once that "The 
place of the satirist has been taken by the newspaper reporter"; 
a contention borne out by the babbling idiots campaigning for the 
Republican Party's nomination. If they do not press Lyndon 
Johnson to an explanation, they at least disprove his supposed 
monopoly on lunacy. 
According to Mon.'s South Bend Tribune, "Richard Nixon said 
Sutrtlay that the United States' revolutionary heritage is no justifi­
cation for another summer of racial rioting.'' In other words, 
Negroes do not riot because they are unemployed, hungry, or 
segregated; they riot through excess of patriotic fervor, the spirit of 
'76. Not that Nixon's perception is dull or his political savvy less 
than acute; but a man who has spent eight years of his life as 
United States Vice-President, who has argued capitalism with 
Krushchev in an American dream home (see Six Crises) who has 
travelled around the world on the business of Pepsi-Cola, should have 
more to say about an issue which he feels necessitates a change. 
Nelson Rockefeller, who recently shoved presidential aspirant 

John Lindsay into the garbage of New York, told the National 
Governors' Conference last week that, in his opinion, what the Re­
publican Party needs is someone "who can get enough independent 
and Democratic votes to get elected.'' 
A nation involved in Vietnam up to its freedom-loving beak, 
recently informed that at least $32 billion are needed to cure the 
cause of last summer's riots ("white racism"), deserves more than 
cocktail chatter from those who aspire to lead. But that presumes 
that Nixon, Rockefeller, and the rest aspire to lead and not just to 
win. The nation is more important than either party and the world 
is more important than any single nation; but when Nixon and 
Rockefeller speak ofparty unity, there is a suspicion that they speak 
of how winning is accomplished and not of why winning is impor­
tant. Both parties boil down to their ·special interests, to labor or 
management, to janitors and postmen, essentially, to jobs. That 

concern is less important than the issues which confront this 
nation. 
There is one candidate, mentioned nationally as material for the office of vice-president and at Notre Dame as material for the presidency; Mark Hatfield, who won his Senate seat with a cam­paign based on opposition to the war, is the only candidate who has an expressed opinion. On two occasions he has stated that he will leave his party if the Democrats nominate a peace candidate. Last week in the Senate he proposed a bill which would prevent an invasion of North Vietnam without Congression­al approval. The conflict in Vietnam, he says and has said, is a civil conflict, blown out of proportion by United States intervention. 
Mark Hatfield attracts not because he is a winner (although he has been as the only governor of Oregon in this century to serve ~wo consecutive terms) but because he has the courage to make an 
election what it is supposed to be: a conflict of issues rather than of personalities. Ironically, his disregard for the practical hog-wash politics of the modern realpolitks make him the nation's practical choice.

society," said Dr. Frederick Seitz, President of the National Aca­demy of Sciences, at a Challen­ges in Science lectu!e given Mon­day night in the Library audi­torium. With this statement, Dr. Seitz launched into a highly critical analysis of the activist movement on the modern cam­pus and the derogatory effects it is having on scientific ad­vancement at the university lev­el. 
Speaking on "Science, the Universities, and Society," Dr. Seitz concentrated the first half of his speech on the historical de­velopement of the university. He then described the growing breakdown of communications between the science community and the federal government. 
In line with his dealing with the government in attempts to obtain research grants, Dr. Seitz reported that the rising feeling in governmental circles is that "the science community is turn­ing its back on society by con­centrating on pure research, ra­ther than socially profitable pro­jects." 
The tempo of the lecture heightened as Dr. Seitz discussed the university involvement in modern society. 
"Our present day university is undergoing paralysis by the dissident groups which make it

NSHP To Receive 


$25,000 Grant 
Bolstered by a $25,000 grant from the Rockefeller Founda­tion, the Neighborhood Study Help Program is now financially assured of continued operation. This donation, which reached school authorities last week, sh­ould enable the program to carry through next December. It is believed that the personal in­tervention of Father Hesburgh was directly responsible for the 
grant. 
Cuts in the O.E.O. anti-pov­erty budget had shut off federal funds to N.S.H.P. last Dec. 31. Subsequently, a drive for private contributions was initiated in the South Bend area. A total of $5,000 has at this time been raised, with over $1,000 coming from N.D. members. This amount added to the Rockefeller grant reaches the bare-minimum figure of $30,000 per year need­ed for N.S.H.P. operation. 
N.S.H.P. currently runs 33 tutoring sessions a week, at 23 neighborhood centers. Over 600 
N.D. and St. Mary's students are regularly participating in this community action. In all, they are reaching I, I00 disadvantaged elementary and junior high youngsters. 
The Rockefeller grant, while providing a needed boost, is strictly a one-shot deal. Once the funds are depleted, N,S.H.P. will have to look elsewhere for assistance. There is a present possibility, however, of affilia­tion with United Community Service next year.
