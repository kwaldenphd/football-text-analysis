Scholars converge on SMC for Symposium 
by Prue Wear 
This weekend, in one of the 
.final large-scale observances of Saint Mary's College !25th Anniversary, St. Mary's brought together a panel of widely-known national and international scholars for the Language IS ym hoi/Reality Symposium on semantics and symbolism. 
National attention had been focused on the event with the distribution of Symposium brochures, and, far in advance of its beginning, a greater-than-ex­pected response was received. 
The most nationally well-known of the panel members, Dr. S.l. Hayakawa, President of San Francisco State College, spoke on Friday night in O'Laughlin Auditorium. 
The lecture was on "The Symbolic Processes of the Mentally Retarded Child" and much of Hayakawa's speech was an account of his personal experience with his 20 year old mentally retarded son Mark. 
After two days of deliberation and after finding out that there was no one stupid enough on either campus to want his job, 
Observer editor, Guy De Sapio decided not to announce his resignation at the staff meeting on Friday. 
llis announcement was greet­ed with shock and dismay by the staff who had already collected $23.32 for an office poll betting on how long the next editor would last. 
Instead De Sapio announced a basic restructuring of the paper which he stated, "would provide for the continued growth of The Observer in a manner which would assure continuity from year to year." 
At the same time De Sapio announced a number of new editorial appointments. 
The new organization would decentralize the structure of the paper allowing night editors a greater degree of participation in the editorial direction of the paper. Each night editor will serve as his own editorial page 
editor. lie will have the leeway 
One outstanding point was that Mark, unlike those who are "normal", has "unusually direct relathnships with experience". He felt this stemmed from Mark's lack of self-conscious­ness, a level of abstraction beyond Mark's abilities. 
Mark, he said, had created a "non-symbolic system" which gave him an unprejudiced view of the world. He said, "The same words by which we move up to higher levels of abstraction are the ones which divide us up." 
Relating the difficulties Mark had in comprehending the meaning of the everyday symbols, Hayakawa attempted to show that the "normal person" speaks his language unconcious of the levels of symbolism in it. In addition, he impressed upon the audience that the symbols in our language and in our thought processes play a great part in determining our attitudes toward the world around us. 
to speak out on issues that he feels are significant. 
The layout of the editorial page will change in order to allow for this expression. The Observer will not necessarily run editorials in every eight page paper. When it doesn't the editorial slot will be filled by the. night editor with a column that does not carry full Observer endorsement. 
The Observer as an entity will still speak out on issues. A new editorial board was established which will research and write Observer editorials. These will be run if approved by majority vote of the board. When they are run they will"represent" the senti­ment of The Observer. 
"The change was necessary," 

De Sapio said, "to emphasize 
what I felt the nature of The 
Observer should be. It is no 
longer a one or two man 
operation. The Observer does not 
belong to the editor or the 
publisher. It belongs to the staff. 
It would be different if The 
Observer was a business. But it is 
more than that. It has to be run 
(continued on page 2) 

The opening speech was given by Indiana Third District Congressman John Brademas, a member of the St. Mary's Board of Trustees. 
Meyer Schapiro, an authority on early Christian and medieval art, University Professor teaching in the Department of Art History and Archaeology at Columbia University, spoke on "Some Aspects of the Pictorial Image as Symbol and as Representation." 
The director of the Princeton University Anthropology Program, African language scholar David Crabb spoke at 
3:00 p.m. The topic of his discussion was "Preliminaries to a theory of language as Symbolic 'Of and For' Reality."

Juni0 r parent5 weekend pIan 
The Junior Parents weekend, March 13, 14, and 15 has been restructured and given a new format, breaking seventeen years of tradition. 
Previous Weekends have start­ed with parents attending their son's classes on Saturday morn­ing and ending with a dinner in 
Stepan Center. 

This year, according to Jim D'Aurora, one of the organizers of the Weekend, Juniors are hoped to be excused from Satur­day classes. Instead, students and parents would meet with faculty from all four major colleges on Saturday morning. 
Rich Linquanti, who is in charge of this aspect of the program, commented on the change. 
"We would like to relate, to parents, what their son is doing in school with something con­crete. We would tell them what his major is about and how he can apply his studies to it," he 
said. 

Instead of a reception on Sat­urday afternoon, there will be a discussion of current events top­
ics; life on campus, the black situation, co-education, and others. This part of the program was inaugurated because a teach-in held last year on the 
main quad during the Weekend, attracted many parents. 
Also Saturday, if enough halls have developed Hall Fellows pro­grams, a luncheon might be held 
in the residence halls, allowing parents to meet the Fellows. Linquanti points out that this would promote a more informal, relaxed atmosphere For those students in halls with no Fellows program, a luncheon for stud­ents and parents will be held in 
the dining halls.

McKenna announced yesterday 
that he intends to ask the

of the Board of Trustees for 
eight student seats when he 
meets with them next Tuesday. 
McKenna, who refused to 
predict the outcome of his1 proposal, said that he would ask for seats for the president and vice-president of the Student Body, as well as for the heads of the Afro-American Society and the Graduate Student Union. He also said that he would seek four "floating" seats, the occupants of which could be eligible to be replaced each meeting. Accord­-ing to the proposal, one of the seats would be occupied by an appointee of the Graduate Stud­ent Union, one would be occu­pied by an appointee of the Student Body President, and two would be occupied by 
students elected from the Stud· 
ent Senate.

Not everything at the meeting was related to work however. Plans were announced for the formulation of a GSU Basketball League. Each department will be canvassed this week to see if they wish to enter a team. The possibility of a Christmas dance was also brought to the floor.

After McKenna and other Student Government officials meet with the Trustees in an early afternoon meeting, there will be an open session where students can question the Trustees on any matter. Exact times of the meetings will be announced in tomorrow's Observer. 
Compare food 
ND and SMC students in 
co-ex courses vocalized last week 
their opinions on the food 
services on the campuses. 
Sixty-seven SMC students eat 
at the south dining hall while a 
maximum of about fifty ND 

students eat at the St. Mary's 
cafeteria daily. 
ND sophomore Marshall 
Breedlove compared the quality 

of the food, "It's OK. A great 
improvement over the food at 
ND and, in general, the meals are 
more balanced and less starchy. 

And it's great to get seconds." 
·--Across the road at the south 

dining hall, SMC junior Maureen 
Lavery says, "I eat there twice a 

week. The last three our of four 
meals haven't been so hot, but 
St. Mary's food has been so poor 
that ND food is about the same, 
or even better. But flies are 
always getting into the salad 
dressing and ketchup at ND. It's; 
really gross." 
ND sophomore Ray Ferrari expressed similar views, "St. Mary's has good ice cream and good salads, but the main course is about the same as at ND." 
An opposing opinion was held 

by freshman Connie Conole, 
south dining hall frequenter, 
"ND food leaves much to be 
desired. Also, I think that the 
dining hall lacks personality. St 
Mary's dining hall-food-wise and 
personality-wise--is much 
better." 
ND freshman Steve Donovan said of the SMC food, "It's all right. It tastes better than 
mentation, the experimental NO's."

Hockey scrimmage reveals potent Irish offense

Observer Sports Writer onslaught from this season's first and third lines, piled up a 4-0 
Last night's Blue-White lead in the first period against a hockey game at the Convo Blue squad consisting of both Center pitted an offensively the first and second lines on 
stronger White squad against defense as well as ace goalie Dick what was assumed to be a more Tomasoni, and held on for a 7-5 defense-minded Blue team. The victory. 
Paul Gallagher Experimental College 
Mr. Goerner's St. Thomas Moore Experimental College idea is finally and irrevocably dead. Georner, one of those teachers most widely respected by undergraduates at Notre Dame, wrote in exasperation to Fr. Sheedy recently that the Experimental College subcommittee of the Curriculum Revision Committee need not defer to his proposal any longer nor be troubled by his thorn in their side. Goerner refused to play the sort of politics needed to gain acceptance for his proposal, and knowing that without doing so he was doomed, accepted defeat, and counted himself out. 
What a relief! Now we can get back to keeping up with the latest mental gy rnnastics in our fields to winning a place for ourselves among the professionals. Indeed, in three, four years, we too can become professionals, if only now we can keep in check the groaning of our spirit, and discipline our minds to fight its repulsion of the pallid fodder which it must become accustomed to eat, and eat, and eat. 
It was an easy victory. A coed residential college (faculty and students living together community fashion!) geared toward students leading examined Jives, philosophical lives of wonder and questioning in Socratic fashion. How impractical! What firm would fund it! What kind of a job could you get with that! 
Besides it is just not what's going on. We'd end up like O'Malley, Sniedgowski, Duffy, Walsh, and Dunne, all making less than 20 thousand per year. Or Goerner himself, teaching freshman government and driving a VW bus after how many years? 
Lucky Goerner isn't a power politics man; that made things easier. lie's too used to philosophy; to just presenting ideas and trusting that the truth in them will touch and move men. No Grand Inquisitor was needed to down his proposal, so defenselessly offered. It was doomed from the start. 
Too bad about him though. He didn't act as sprightly as he might; didn't bounce back like a good loser should. In fact, he took the whole thing pretty hard. You see his eyes? Looked like he'd never spea\ of such things again. . . 
And in place of St. Thomas Moore we have a ntce little experiment that will keep the boys happy and keep things moving in the right direction, moving in a direction where there is a future. It's Nice and spicy-a little sex, lots of McLuhan stuff, some computers programming, a fiHie dabbling in cybernetics, and some collage making. It will really be different. And practical. Being only a year long, students won't be too affected by it and will be able to easily fit back into their normal department programs after it is completed. 
Goerner forgets we have a pluralistic community here. Not all of us arc in !crested in understanding ourselves and struggling with his ultimate questions; with reflections on life and death, suffering and sacrifice, loneliness and revelation, insight and confusion. Some of us came here to get an education. 
Things get tight in halls at times; he has a point there. It isn't like home. But guys seem to get through. Let them go out and lay one on once in a while. It's not the greatest solution, but it helps them kick the depression and get back to their work. They'll be glad for living through it later. 
N Dis center of molecular study 
Two Nobel prize-winners in chemistry are the intellectual "fathers" of research into molecular structure at the Uni­versity of Notre Dame. In fact, since Drs. Derek Barton and Odd llassel have left the field of con formational analysis that earned them the prize, Notre Dame has been one of the major centers for such research in the world, according to Dr. Ernest 
L. Eliel, professor of chemistry. 
Eliel whose interest in con­formational analysis dates back to a \950 lecture by Barton on the Notre Dame campus, has spent much of the past 20 years clarifying and measuring propo­sitions set forth by the two pioneers. 
Since Eliel knew Barton per­sonally and worked extensively in the field of conformational analysis, he was recently asked to writ~: an article about the two Nobel prize-winners for the magazine "Science." In his article, Eliel explains that the major impact of early research by Barton and Hassel was to lift organic chemistry off the flat page and propel it into three dimensions. Techniques of model-building and three-dimensional analysis cre­ated by the pioneers made pos­sible studies of sugars as well as later research into proteins and other complex molecules. 
Hassel, a Norwegian working at the University of Oslo, showed that the six--carbon ring common in carbohydrates, hormones, synthetic fabrics and other important molecules is not a planar hexagon, but a zig-zag shaped, three-dimensional figure resembling a modernistic 
chair.  Between 1930 and  1955  
he  studied  the  physical  pro­ 
perties  of  the  isolated  ring,  

showing that its simple deriva­tives exist in two forms now called "axial" and "equatorial." 
Much of his early research is not available to American scientists, since il appeared largely in an obscure Norwegian mining Journal. Hassel's research was interrupted for two years by the German occupation, when 

Neither the first two defensive units (Jim Morin-Bill Green and Mark Longar-Mark Steinborn) nor netminder Tomasoni displayed the form that will be needed to hold down such offensive powerhouses as Wisconsin and Boston College as the Whites broke through for three quick breakaways early in the first period. Freshman Paul Regan and Soph Kevin Hoene tallied on two of them, with Mike Bonk and John Rosselli upping it to 4-0 by the middle of the period. After the midway point, however the action seemed to even out as both teams proceeded to display what could be a potent Irish offense for the upcoming season. 
Second-string goalie Chris Catchcart protected the White lead with some fine split saves, until freshman Ricky Cunha slipped one underneath his pads at 2:5 8 of the second period. Taking the cue from Cunha, wingers John Womack and Adam Stelmaszynski of the Blue squad added two more to make it 5-3 for the Whites at the end of two periods of play. 
Two periods of fast-moving hockey will take its toll on a team, especially when that team has been divided into two opposing teams. Consequently, except for a flurry of shots towards the finish, most of the third period action was slow-moving and dull as all four offensive lines were pretty much exhausted. Cathcart's play seemed to deteriorate as Womack and defenscman Mark Longar beat him on close-in shots; conversely, Tomasoni's 
play steadily improved as the evening progressed. He ended the night with 32 saves as opposed to Cathcart's 27, although allowing seven goals to his opponent's five. The Irish "Veteran Line" (sophs Joe Bonk and Kevin Hoene teamed with junior John Roselli) accounted for five of the White team's seven goals, Roselli and Hoene both netting two each and Bonk garnishing with two assists, including one that set up his younger brother Mike for the third White goal. 
Assistant Coach Tim McNeill commented that the failures of the first two lines of defense 
"worries him the most" and that 
changes may be forthcoming. 
Otherwise both he and Head 
Coach "Lefty" Smith are 
pleased with the progress of the 
Irish's offensive attack and both 
feel that the goaltending, 
although displaying sporadic 
weaknesses last night, will be a 
key factor in many a game this 
season. Saturday night marks the beginning of regular season play for the Notre Dame sextet as 
they take to the ice at home 
against the "Lancers" from the 
University of Windsor. Game 
time has been moved up to 7:30 
so as not to conflict with the 
later telecast of the Georgia 
Tech-Notre Dame game from 
Atlanta. 
Frosh offense blunted 
The Irish freshmen were unable to get their offense going for the second straight game this 
year  and  bowed  to  Michigan  
State  21  -7 last  Saturday  at  
East  Lansing.  In  an  almost  

incredible performance, the young Spartans threw ND run­ners for I 13 yards in losses for a final tally of 43 Irish carries for a net 21 yards. 
Through the air, Notre Dame was more successful, completing 7 of 26 passes for l 02 yards. Willie Townsend scored the only ND touchdown in the third peri­od on an 18-ya rd pass from Jim Bulger, with Mike Creaney mak­ing good on the PAT. 
The big man of MSU was Jesse Williams from Bellefon­taine, Ohio, who rambled for 186 yards in 24 carries, including a 71-scoring dash which opened the scoring in the first quarter. Rich Salani caught a 27-yard scoring pass from Brad Van Pelt and Gail Clark capped the day 
by  stealing  one  of  Bulger's  
throws  and  going  88  yards  to  
score.  

Notre Dame closes the fresh­man season next Saturday at home against Michigan. 
Prostitutes to combat military VD? 
LOS ANGELES (UPI)-A Southern Baptist publication has facetiously proposed sending on­ly married soldiers into battle and allowing them to spend alternate weeks behind the front with their wives to help combat venereal disease in Vietnam.
