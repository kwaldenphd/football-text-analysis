Social action committee happy with turnout 
by Bill Carter 

About 20 of the Notre Dame -SMC and South Bend Social action organizations participated in a social action night Tuesday in LaFortune Center. Under the leadership of the newly-formed Kennedy Institute, the affair brought together all those groups interested in initiating their programs for the coming vear. 
The turnout of approximately 300 new people anxious to be­
come involved in the community social projects more than satis­fied the expectations of Kennedy Institute Chairman John Mroz and the others res­ponsible for the organization of the night. 
Institute board member John Kries said that everyone associa­ted with the social action groups was encouraged by the number and the attitudes of the students who came to the meeting. 
"Everyone there was really impressed with the people who showed up. They were so en­the groups if they would like to become associated with the In­stitute more formally for the purpose of facilitating fund rai­sing and recruiting programs. 
"The Institute thought it might be easier if just one group, acting as a representative of the entire body of social organiza­tions, went to the Foundations to make requests for grants. 
"The recent budget cuts mean that money will be short all over, of course, so it seems like it would be a good idea if the groups got together and more or less pooled their resources," he tiona! structure so that the lead­er of each respective social group will be a member of the board of the Institute, and decisions and plans will be formulated more or less in common. 
The Institute's plans for the future include a National Lt:ad­ership Conference next month and a Community Relations Conference sometime early next year. The Leadership Conference will be held sometime around Nov. 13.

What's in a name? 

Ever since he came into the game, I've been wattmg for the headline. There it was Monday morning: "Spray Wins Golf Tourna­ment." Beautiful! 
You have to understand what "Spray" means to a golfer. About what "malpractice" means to a doctor, or "malfeasance" to a politician, or "subornation" to a lawyer. I remember once, we were preparing a magazine cover story on Ben Hogan, then the world's top golfer, and the editor sent a phrase out to me to check with the great man. It went something like this: "Hogan showed up at the practice tee and, for hours, sprayed shots in all directions, hitting thousands of balls." What they were worried about was whether the thousands of balls" statement was accurate. Hogan's eyes slid right over this. He pointed to the word "sprayed." "What's this?" he demanded suspiciously. "It just means you hit balls in all direc·· tions," I told him. Hogan stared a hole through me. "I don't hit balls in all directions,'' he said bitingly. "I hit balls where I want to hit them. And I don't 'spraY.'. You spray paint, not golf balls." 
"Steve Spray" sounds like the name you give to a comic strip character who keeps missing the cut. "Stanley Shank" would be the only better name I could think of. "Shank Wins Open!" would be the only better headline you could imagine. 
An analogous situation would be to have a fighter named "Noel (Kid) Coward," and see the banner, "Coward Wins Heavyweight Title!" 
Would you like to see your case tried by a judge name "Hanger"? Bet on a jockey named "Puller"? Would the Mets hire a catcher named "Scatter"? 
Would you grant an interview to a journalist named "Yellow"? Would you bank where the vice president is named "A. M. Bezzler'"! Dine in an Italian cookery known as "Ma Fioso's"? How about a Chinese restaurant named "Poi Sun's"? Go under the knife to a surgeon named "G. N. Green," would you? 
Would the aficionados bet on a bullfighter named "Gore'"/ There's a real estate office in this town run by a guy named "Rooke" but, so far, no politicians named "Arnold Crook." ("A. Crook Wins in Landslide!"). 
Would you enlist under a General Retreat? I flew with a pilot named "Falls" once, but my favorite was a captain identified in the cabin nameplate as "E. Rohr." Think about a cross-country flight with "Pilot E. Rohr" staring you in the face and you keep a close clutch on that plastic bag. 
Would you get engaged to a girl named "Constance Lyon?" You like to have a backfield of "Swift " "Fleet " "Blocker" and "Smart," but, what if you had o~e consisting of "Boozer,'' "Walker," "Aker," and "Mal Linger"· at quarterback? When you go to the track, would you get on a horse named "Blue Doe"? 
Gary Player was the most felicitously named golfer in history. "Player" is the opposite of "Sprayer." To a golfer, to say, "he's a player" says it all. Bobby Cruickshank came within a couple of vowels of having the all-time worst name. 
But, until "Herbie Hooker" or "Woods Slicer" or "Chilly Dipper" or "Forrest Putz" comes along, Steve Spray is our man. Can't wait till he makes the British Open one year and an English writer says, "When he reached the 17th tee of the Open today, Steve Spray did." Or, "Steve Spray lived up to his name today when, on thr tree-bordered 18th, he hit a wood shot with a S-iron ... "
