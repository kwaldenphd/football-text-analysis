The events of that Tuesday one Assistant year ago didn't News Editor just motlvate firefighters and rescue workers of New York City to risk their lives in helping others, they moved a nation to act. Politicians put bipartisanship aside and worked together, church atten­dance dramatically increased, dona­tions of blood and money skyrocket­ed and a deep sense of patriotism pervaded the country. 
Around the world, nations grow­ing increasingly hostile toward the United States openly expressed their sorrow and sympathy. People crowded outside American embassies. covering the gates with cards and flowers and hosting can­dlelight vigils. President Bush's war on terrorism toppled the oppressive Taliban regime and guaranteed new freedoms for the men and women of Afghanistan. Osama bin Laden's al­Qaida terrorist network was weak­ened and driven further into moun­tainous caves. 
Closer to home, I remember the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's com­munities uniting in prayer. Classes, practices and other normal activi­ties were cancelled and students and faculty gathered on South Quad to celebrate Mass. Around the coun­try, Notre.Dame clubs raised money to help those affected by the terror­ist attacks while mourning losses within the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's families as a result of the them. 
Back in South Bend, Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students draped flags outside their dorm windows. They organized a massive collection at that weekend's football game. Many carpooled to local blood banks and waited hours in line for the chance to donate blood -so many, in fact, that some were turned away. 
God really does work in mysteri­ous ways. Today, one year later, I still can't fathom how so much good came from so much evil. 
Still, I worry. I worry that as time goes on we'll forget the good that came from last September and sim­ply focus on the bad. 
After all, the flags that once deco­rated our dorms are boxed away. our nation's blood supply has returned to normal levels (and in some areas is dangerously low) and stories of corporate greed have overshadowed our progress in the war on terrorism. 
Please don't let that happen. Please don't slip back into compla­cency. Today and always, remember to attend mass, light a candle at the Grotto .and volunteer to help others. 
And please, please, please don't forget. Don't forget what happened -the bad and especially the good.

Americans misunderstand Arab hatred 
. Arab animosity has many origins 
By MEGHANNE DOWNES Assistant News Editor 
Major news networks broadcasted images of Palestinians rejoicing in the streets on Sept. 11, leaving many enraged Americans asking "Why do they hate us?" 
Scott Appleby. director of the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, at a Sunday panel discus­sion, was quick to point out that the "they" is not repre­sentative of the whole of Islam and that it was a small extremist faction that carried out the terrorist attacks. The geopolitical development of these states is important to understand­ing the conflicts, said Appleby.

In the aftermath of Sept. 11, Notre Dame has added semester-long courses that deal with issues related to the terrorist attacks. 
"The events of Sept. 11 have changed how we see many issues and have pro­vided us with a 
of man­agement. 
These classes have proved to be popular among students as many of the classes filled up early. 
"The class [Problems of Contemporary Violence: Terrorism, War, and Peace After Sept. 11] filled up immediately when registra­tion opened," said Robert Johansen, director of grad­uate studies in the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies. 
This class dealt specifi­cally with the global role of the United States along with the meaning of human security and how to achieve it. 
"The class helped people to understand that acts of terror are political acts and that conditions of victim-
With regard to self-inter­est, Appleby said that America cannot be too pragmatic, narrow and short-sided. A sizeable and forceful political will will be necessary for this to be overcome. 
Americans are compelled to look at situations and believe that they arc the peacekeepers. Father Theodore Hesburgh, presi­dent emeritus, said at Sunday's panel that every time there is a disaster the United States and Red Cross are the first to arrive on the scene with manpower and financial aid, but this is a very small percentage of our gross national product. 
In this world of conflict, the United States, as well as other countries, is asking who the enemy is. "We are one of the candidates," said Appleby.

leading many Muslims to wrongly perceive Americans. Appleby provid­ed four masons for why there is animosity directed at the United States from the Islamic world. The gov­
ernment's relation­ship with Israel is blurred f ll r Muslims, and they wonder if t h C United States is the pup­pet of a Zionist 
state or is Israel the surro­gate of the United States. This hostility stems from the emasculization and repression within the cul­ture. Many Muslims carry a deep sense of humiliation. In several ways the US for­eign policy is hypocritical. If Islamic reign was permitted to be established in this region, democracy would ensue, but the government is too concerned about its oil, said Appleby.

Threats too close in Washington 
By JASON McFARLEY 
News Writer 
If only she had stayed. 
A week before terrorists slammed a jet liner into the Pentagon, Lauren Berrigan quit her internship at the sym­bol of America's military might. Berrigan, studying in the Notre 0 a m e Washing­t o n Program, craved a job with better organiza­tion and rn o r e direction. 
On Sept. 11, 2001, she saw her former office 



trans­formed into smoldering rubble, and she instant­ly regretted ever walk­ing away. 
"Where I 


had worked Thompson was really close to the damaged area of the building," said Berrigan, now a senior. "It's a little strange to say, but in a lot of ways I felt guilty for not being there and experiencing what the other workers did that day." Berrigan was one of 19 stu­dents studying in Washington last fall when planes hit the Pentagon, toppled the twin peaks of the New York skyline and went careening into a Pennsylvania field. The stu­dents watched as the attacks and the events that followed in their wake played out like a national drama just beyond the group's own doorstep. 
For Berrigan. the pangs of guilt haven't subsided, not even a year later. She still thinks about the day of the mostly deadly terrorist strike on U.S. soil -sometimes more than she'd like to. 
"I still have the continual fear that every time I turn on the TV there's going to be something there," she said. "I have a sense that [terrorism against the United States] isn't done. It'll always be in my mind." 
It stays with Gail Thompson, too. She remembers clearly the morning of the attacks. 
The day began the same as most others had the past two weeks Thompson had been in Washington. She woke early, dressed and left on time to arrive by 9 a.m. at her intern­ship in New York Sen. Hillary Rodham-Clinton's office. Thompson stepped off the Metro subway system and into a world of panic. 

"Every-one was watching TV when I got to work" in the Russell Senate Building, she said. "They said the Pentagon had been hit, and outside you could see the smoke behind the building. We all ran to get out of there. rt was the fastest f had ever run in my life." 
Internship coordinators sent Thompson and other Notre 
Dame students home for the 

day. Thompson debated how 
to get back to her apartment. 
She would feel unsafe on the 
subway, she thought, so she 

opted to walk. But ominous 
feelings still enveloped her, 
particularly each time a plane 
flew overhead. 

The long, fearful walk 
home, however, did give her 
time to think. The thought that loomed most prominently in her mind was to leave the program. 
"I wanted to go home," she said. "Me and my mother had a serious conversation about me coming home." 
Although program directors gave students the option of departing the program and returning to Notre Dame for the semester, no students left Washington. Speculation that the University would cancel the program, in fact, con­cerned many ofthe students. 
Rachael Protzman's family and friends had a hard time understanding her reasons for wanting to stay in the nation's capital. 
"I never wanted to leave," said Protzman, who interned a public relations firm. "It was difficult talking to loved ones because they didn't compre­hend why I didn't want to leave." 
The attacks cancelled class and work for the students for about a week. Program offi­cials also scratched special events and city tours from the curriculum. They warned stu­dents to stay close to their apartments and to avoid taking the subway and gathering in crowded places. 
In October, students faced a renewed threat, as positive tests for the disease anthrax surfaced in government office buildings. Thompson, who by October was working for a senator from her home state of Louisiana, found herself dis­placed when officials closed the Hart Senate Building, fear­ing that airborne anthrax had entered tho building's ventila­tion system. 
Thompson submitted to an optional anthrax test and took Cipro pills as a precaution. No one who she worked with eventually tested positive for the disease. 
The Hart building's close forved displaced senators to relocate in the basement of the Russell Senate Building. The move made Thompson's internship experience better. 
"It was really tight quarters in the basement. If I leaned to the left, I could see what's going on in another office," she said. "If I went to get coffee, I could see what was going on in another office." 
Berrigan, who worked with a Congressional committee after leaving the Pentagon intern­ship, said her time in Washington ultimately was positive, too. She eventually wants to live and work in the city. 
On the anniversary of the tragedy today, Berrigan and her Washington Program classmates' thoughts won't necessarily dwell on the destruction and death toll. 
"I'm trying to put September 11 behind me," said Berrigan. "I almost wish there wasn't such an emphasis on it." 
Thompson says she'll be looking forward, not behind. 
"One of the biggest lessons I've learned is there are a lot of people who hate us what we stand for. They can either eliminate us or we can keep going. I think most likely we'll keep going," she said.

LonDomers felt shock from across the ocean 
ByJAMES GAFFEY 
News Writer 

Sept. 11, 2001 started out as a typical Tuesday for Notre Dame students studying abroad in London last semester. It was late afternoon London-time when the first plane was hijacked. Many of lhe 150 "LonDomers" were in class at the time; some were wrapping up assignments just off Trafalgar Square in the class­room building's library; some were unwinding at their apart­ments on Edgwarc Road; and some, undoubtedly, were sip­ping pints in a quaint English pub. 
They were focusing on adapt­ing to a different culture; the familiarity of life in America, for the sake of personal growth, was something they had left behind for the semes­ter. But the news of the World Trade Center's collapse struck Notre Dame London students just as deeply as if they were back home. The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 put LonDomers in an awkward position -they felt the shock and pain of having one's own country attacked and yet were strangely removed from it. 
Christine Bryant first got word of the attacks while in the computer lab of the London classroom building. The person sitting next to her received an Instant Message from a friend in America and shouted out to everyone in the room. Soon stu­dents were frantically attempt­ing to log on to CNN.com to find out more and sharing details as they uncovered them. 
"The site was blocked at first 
because there was so much 
traffic," said Bryant. 

As a result, many of the stu­dents in the computer lab filed into the basement of the build­ing to watch the news with dozens of other classmates as it came in on television. Bryant, though, went back to her apartment and found that all her roommates were trying to use the phone to call back home. The first few hours after the attack it was very difficult to get information about family and friend back home, Bryant said. "In my apartment the news was on all the time." 
Dave Relczyk, a senior who was in London last fall, recalls the anxiety he felt in being unable to contact his girlfriend who was studying in Washington, D.C. at the time. "I wished I could have been with family and friends," said Belczyk. "We were an ocean away from them, and that was very difficult." 
Aside from the safety of fami­ly and friends back home, Notre Dame London students had to worry about their own safety in the capital city of America's biggest ally. The London students' apartment building is situated in a largely Arab neighborhood, and a handful of students were ver­bally harassed during the weeks following the attack. 
London Program administra­tors and rectors advised stu­dents not to wear any U.S. clothing that might make them targets. Bryant recalls the uncertainty and helplessness many of the LonDomers felt. "It was unsettling because there were rumors about sending us back," she said. 
Although Bryant said she felt no less patriotic than if she had been in the U.S., she said, "We couldn't show our patriotism as much because we didn't want to make ourselves targets." 
The great majority of British citizens, however, did not pose the slightest threat to the safety of American students. In the week following the attacks, flowers, sympathetic notes. and candles filled Grosvenor Square, the park in front of the 
U.S. Embassy. Throughout London British flags hung at half-mast. And Sept. 14, the third day after the attacks, was declared a national day of mourning throughout the United Kingdom. At 11 a.m. Friday three minutes of silence were observed in memory of those killed in the attacks on America. 
Notre Dame London Program classes participated in the day of mourning. The streets of London were strangely quiet. Busses, taxis, and subway trains all stopped for the three­minute period. 
Despite the great sympathy of

Friends and family remembered 
By SARAH NESTOR 
Saint Mary's News Editor 
While America remembers last year's terrorist attacks, the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's communities mourn the loved ones that they lost. 

A loving niece 
Amy Jarret, 28, lovEJd Notre Dame football and came with her brother, Jay Jarret '91, to at least one home game each year. Her ties to Notre Dame started with her grandfather, the late Aram P. Jarret, Sr. '38, her father Ararn P. Jarret '65, and uncle Father Peter Jarret '86, rector of Keough Hall. 
"Amy had a good love for life and a great love for people," Peter Jarret said. 
Amy Jarret, 28, began work­ing for United Airlines when she was 23 years old. She loved meeting new people and the freedom of being a flight atten­dant. Her family experienced little anxiety about her chosen career. 
"She was completely suited to it," Peter Jarret said. "Though she was engaged to be married so I think she was looking to get out of it." 
When United Airlines flight 175, en route from Boston to Los Angeles, crashed into the south tower of the World Trade Center no one in the family sus­pected that Amy Jarret had been working that flight. 
A call from United Airlines an hour later let the family in New Smithfield, R.I., know that Amy Jarret had been scheduled to work the flight, another call confirmed that Amy Jarret had been on flight 175. 

"It's been hard on the family because her bodv was never found," Peter Jarret said. "Instead the family has been finding other ways to remember her; dedicating a memorial in New Smithfield and through memorial masses for her." 
A role model alumna 

Suzanne Kondraten.ko, a Saint Mary's 1996 humanistic studies alumna, loved her time at col­lege and spoke so highly of Saint Mary's that she convinced her sister, Caroline Kondratenko, Saint Mary's senior, to apply. 
"I spent a lot of time here vis­iting her when J was younger," Caroline Kondratenko said. ''I've always tried to follow in her footsteps." 
Suzanne Kondratenko made the most of her time at Saint Mary's, earning a student inde­pendent study and research grant, spending a year abroad in Rome and graduating at the top of her class. 
"She was extremely brilliant, independent, but family was very important to her and she always found time for us," Caroline Kondratenko said. "She had a great sense of humor and people always loved her. You had to know her to experience it." 
Suzanne Kondratenko was a senior operations improvement consultant for Keane Consulting Group in Chicago. She was on assignment in New York City for a me<1ting with the Aon Corporation when one of the planes struck the south tower of the World Trado Center Suzanne Kondratenko was last seen heading down the stairs from the 90th floor of the sec­ond tower. 
Two weeks after the attacks, vvh ile the Kondraten ko family still searched for Suzanne Kondratenko in New York, Caroline Kondratenko left for Rome, following onre a.gain in her sister's footsteps. 
"I was in denial for a long tim0 and it was tough being so far away from what was hap­pening," Caroline Kondratenko said. "It was a great experience though and I knew how much she had loved it there." 
Today, the Kondratenko fami­ly is in New York City visiting Ground Zero, the place where Suzanne was last seen. 
"We are going to the memori­al services in New York City together, it's a chance for our family to spend time together there," Caroline Kondratenko said. 

A loved brother 

Timothy Byrne was a bond trader who worked on the one hundred fourth floor of the sec­ond tower of the World Trade Center. He loved working in the Twin Towers, so much that one of his brothers had given him a framed photo of the complex for a Christmas present the previ­ous year. 
Timothy Byrne, 36, brother of Notre Dame junior Colin Byrne, was last heard from when he phoned his mother to tell them he had just seen the first plane crash into the building next door. Apparently feeling safe because of the announcement that his building was secure, he said he wished he had a camera to take a picture. 
A bachelor, Tim Byrne had been a surrogate father to his eight brothers and one sister since their father, whose birth­day was Sept. 11, died in 1986 at age 47. 

A cherished cousin 

l'et<cir O'Neill began working at the company of Sandler and O'Neill at the beginning of August, just a short few weeks before the terrorist attacks. A recent graduate of Bentley College, the 21-year-old had competed against many appli­cants to be a bond trader on the 104th f1oor of the World Trade Center. 
Padraic McDermott, a Notre Dame junior, remembers his cousin's devotion to his family and friends and living at home to stay close to family and friends but commuting to work each day in New York City. 
"He was an athlete, he played lacrosse and liked to ski, he was a volunteer fireman," McDermott said. "His friends, as well as his family knew he was always looking out for them, he was devoted to serving others." 
Shortly after the south tower fell O'Neill's family began to fear for his safety, but amid the chaos they hoped he had safety in the city. A few days later, when O'Neill still had not come home. the family's worst fears were confirmed. 
"He was just the best guy, he had a great temperament, gen­tle and easy going," McDermott said. "It was just unthinkable for his parents and sister." 
Today, in O'Neill's hometown of Amityville, N.Y., family and friends have transformed a gar­den in the middle of town into a memorial park. 
"It's a beautiful park in his honor," McDermott said. "It was a big even in the town, many people from the village helped out, and it was a big event that really pulled the vil­lage together." 
While many members of the O'Neill family will be attending memorial service in New York in honor of the young man that graced so many lives, McDermott will be here with the support of the Notre Dame family. 
"It was really tough being out here when it happened," McDermott said. "It was the Notre Dame campus, friends and the Mass that helped, so that I didn't even feel homesick. I don't know what I would have done without that support." 
While these are a few from the thousands that lost their lives on Sept. 11, they represent the dreams that ended, the fam­ilies forever separated and the realization that life is so deli­cate.

Students reflect on life after Sept. 11 
. Community voices safety and security concerns 
By MEGHANNE DOWNES Assistant News Editor 
8:45 a.m. 9:03 a.m. 9:43 a.m. 
10:10 a.m. 
With each explosion America's sense of pride and security was chipped away. Americans were awakened to not only a black New York sky, but to the reality that they were no longer untouchable and were in fact vulnerable. 
A year after September 11 with Osama bin Laden not caught and war with Iraq immi­nent, Americans undoubtedly will be reflecting on not only how their lives have changed but their sense of security and their country's policy objectives. 
Safety 
Lisa Chester, a Saint Mary's student, grew up in a sheltered small town. The attacks forced her to become more conscious of potential problems. 
Although South Bend, IN is not a small town, several students feel relativity safe here because they are removed from potential targets and New York and Washington, D.C. 
"It depends where you are. Here I feel safe, but in a big city, I don't know. I wonder how easy it would be for terrorists to obtain nuclear weapons," said Luis Chiriboga, Notre Dame sophomore and international student from Ecuador. 
Aaron Briggs, Notre Dame junior, does not feel any safer, but he does not really feel any­more unsafe since the attacks. He feels that way because the situations unfolding in the Mideast and New York are not directly affecting him. 
"I think everything feels less safe. Even though we have more security, it draws attention to our vulnerability," said Erin Ryan. 
Students vary on their feelings regarding the effectiveness of the new security measures. Jacquelyn Kramer feels safe and would not hesitate to fly on an airplane. All students are not as assured as Kramer is. "As far as me feeling safe, I really don't think about it. I see the airport stuff and we are supposed to feel safer but I don't think it is that easy. I certainly don't feel safe because of a guy in uniform," said Chester. 
Alicia d'Alessandro. Notre Dame sophomore, said that the attacks show what we take for granted such as walking freely in an airport. 
Some are cautiously reassured by the belief that a sense of calm has returned to the nation after the initial wave of panic. 
"I feel safe because I feel like everyone is more aware now of their surroundings and what's going on, although there is still a threat," said Courtney Zeph, Notre Dame sophomore. 

Foreign policy 
In recent months, the govern­ment has made it apparent that a United States invasion of Iraq is on the horizon. Some students questioned whether it was the United States' role to take this position. 
"I think the government might be a tad too aggressive with regard to regime change in Iraq. Instead. I would rather see more humanitarian aid to Afghanistan and less covert operations," said Jacquelyn Kramer. 
Chester spoke of the duty that the United States has in the world and wondered if its ego has grown to the size that it automatically assumed that it has a duty to solve crime and poverty. 
"We have this elitist view that they [other countries] will listen to us because it is us, but we are always interfering and it doesn't mean that they will listen. We take it too far. It's not our duty to be there. It's foolish of us to think people will listen to us at all times," said Chester. 
Briggs believed that the nation does have a certain responsibility on the international scene. "I agree with America's foreign policy. I think terrorism is some­thing that we should not tolerate and I agree with our policy on Iraq," said Briggs. "I~ our duty as members of the human race

U.S. plans quiet 9 /11 m.em.orial observances 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK 
The nation will remember last Sept. 11 mostly in silence, with few sounds other than bells tolling, military jets roaring in tribute and the reading of victims' names. 
At the World Trade Center, felled by two of the four hijacked jetliners, family members and dignitaries will read the names of the 2,801 dead and missing Wednesday morning, to begin and end with moments of silence and include readings of the Declaration of Independence and the Gettysburg Address.

A wall etched with the names of the dead and miss­ing was unveiled Tuesday at a new ground zero viewing stand.

Is Iraq worth it? 
War is nothing ifnot a gamble. From the earliest recorded battles straight through to today, this remains constant throughout history. As a result the vic­tor, no matter how powerful, is never invincible.

and British citi­
zens, as well as

soldiers have 
learned this the 
hard way over the 
last several decades as they have 
become targets of those whom they 
have vanquished on the battlefield. As 
the United States prepares to lace up 
the gloves again in the name of world 
peace {ironic, isn't it?), the world is 
abuzz with debate as to whether or not 
war is justified. Few, however, are ask­
ing whether it will be worth it. While 
the ethicists duke it out on the moral 
level, a far easier gage for the common 
man is a simple benefit/risk ratio. As 
any business major can tell you (and 
therefore I'm assuming most of you can 
follow this}, the benefit/risk ratio is a 
device for detennining whether an 
investment is worth making. 
Let's look first at the risks involved in 

a sustained war with Iraq. By sus­
tained, we actually mean a quick war 
which will drag on into a long occupa­
tion (see Afghanistan) wherein the 
resistance fighters will likely be armed 
with weapons such as poison gas, 
anthrax, and a host ofother weapons 
never before at the disposal ofguerilla 
fighters. While the current administra­
tion would like us to believe that the 
Iraqi people will all join hands with the 
United States (notice United States, not 
United Nations) troops and sing songs, 
keep in mind these people have 
absolutely no reason to like the United 
States. Remember, Sadam has done a 
good job convincing them that the 
United States embargos are the cause of 
all of their hardships. Casualties to 
occupying troops in the months follow­
ing will likely be high. Further, we will 
be inciting more acts of terrorism from 
a people who have, throughout history, 
predominately desired to be left alone. 
This will come back to haunt us, guar­
anteed. 
Next let's take a quick look at the potential benefits. Once again, the White House wants us to believe that we will be saving·ourselves from annihila­tion at the hands of Iraqi nukes. Please, can we be realistic? Sadam is power hungry, not suicidal. Any large-scale attack on United States soil will result in an end to his reign. Funding Palestinian suicide bombers is one thing, attacking the US directly is anoth­er. What real benefits do we get? Well, we get cheap oil from the new puppet government, the military gets to oil its gears (which it always likes), we'll hope the economy gets a boost, and the administration gets a "V" in its colwnn. Not bad ifyou're a rich American, in the military or involved in Bush's adminis­tration. Oh, wait, those are the only people in the world who are pushing for this war. 
The evaluation does not bode well for the case ofwar. Notice that we're tbe only country ready to fight. Even in Britain, the majority oppose this war. Statistically, America has seen a whole lot less war in the last century than the rest ofthe world. Do you think. just

Prominent feminist author speaks at Saint Mary's 

By MELANIE BECKER 
NewsWrirer 
Through joint sponsorship of the Center for Women's Leadership (CWIL) and the Women's Studies department, feminist author Paula Kamen spoke to about 50 people at Saint Mary's Tuesday about the evolution of females in society. 
Kamen, whose book "Her Way" explored 20-year-olds vision of the future of women's movements, talked about the independence women have gained over the past 30 years, which has given them greater career options and sexual con­trol. 
Feminism and its implications were also addressed. Kamen stressed feminism is a way to give women a chance to explore their individualism. The ideals of feminism, she said, are not to encourage women to be more like men, but for them to gain more knowledge, political power and economic stability so that they can make their own decisions. While many women continue to have families, oth­ers choose to pursue careers. 
"Marriage, family and com­mitment are still important, but they are not set in stone," Kamen said. "Paths are very different then they were before." 
These outside factors revolu­tionized the way women are viewed, and view themselves sexually. As women's roles in society have changed, sexuality has been pushed to the fore­front, said Kamen. 
Sexual harassment, rape, sex out of marriage and lesbianism have come to light as women struggled to take control of their bodies and free them­selves from shame, Kamen added. Increasing sexual free­dom has put women into a more traditionally male realm as they are becoming more sex­ually active and aware. 
"In her research she is trying to connect women's personal struggles to larger social move­ments," Religious Studies Chair Phyllis Kaminski said. 
The audience raised ques­tions of how religion plays a factor in the changing view of women's sexuality. and several members of tlie audience raised issues about the struggle between religion and lifestyle issues espoused by Kamen. Kamen concluded her talk by saying women should listen to their own voice in making per­sonal decisions. Additionally, liberation should mean that women are given the right to follow their own morals and values. 
"I think that the amount of people that showed up shows what an important topic this is in the community," said junior Mary Beth Broviak.

Bush highlighted ACE and Notre Dame graduate 
By TERESA FRALISH News Writer 
In his Sept. 5 speech at the South Bend Regional Airport, President Bush pointed specifi­cally to teacher and 1995 Notre Dame grad­uate Ricardo Rios as an example of h o w Americans could serve their coun­try. 
Rios, whom Bush met and introduced to the crowd at the airport, teaches sixth grade chil­dren at St. Adalbert Catholic School in South Bend through the Alliance for Catholic Education. 


The ACE program is a two­year service experience that places college graduates in understaffed and Catholic schools nationwide. While teach­ing, volunteers earn a tuition­free master's of education degree and receive a stipend to cover their living costs. 
Bush founded the Freedom Corps, an umbrella organization that encompasses Americorps, a sponsor organization for ACE, upon entering office. As a fairly new teacher, Rios said he hopes to help develop each of his stu­dent's potential and be sensitive to their learning styles. "The biggest challenge is to tap into the individual needs of the stu­dents," he said. "Children learn in different ways." 

To help his students be suc­cessful, Rios wants to offer dif­ferent types of instruction for his sixth-graders. Though the stu­dents aren't perfect, Rios said he feels optimistic about teaching. 
"You can't really have an off day," he said. "It's exciting because [the children] make you laugh." 
Over the course of the year, Rios hopes to improve as a

teacher and empower his stu­dents to achieve their goals. 
"I hope that my kids see through both my teaching and experiences that they can accomplish anything as long as they put forth the attitude and effort," said Rios. 
Rios did not enter the ACE pro­gram immediately after gradua­tion as many Notre Dame seniors do. After receiving a degree in accounting from the University, he instead worked for four years as an accountant, a career he found satisfying and challenging. 
Despite having a rewarding position in the business world, Rios eventually became interest­
ed in making a significant career change and decided to spend a year serving in a Mexican orphanage. 
"I think something pulled me," said Rios. 
When his year of service in Mexico ended, Rios initially looked for a teaching position, but found the search difficult since he had no academic back­ground in education. At that point Rios began to consider various service teaching oppor­tunities, and decided that the ACE program seemed like a good match for his interests. 
'The more I learned about the 
ACE program the more I was 
impressed," Rios said. 
Rios credits the ACE pro­gram's excellent recruitment and teacher support networks as key factors in his decision to apply and become a volunteer. 
"I liked the fact that they real­ly go out and find energetic peo­ple who want to do service and teach," he said. 

Rios found that, of all the ser­vice teaching opportunities avail­able, ACE offered the best chance to strongly influence chil­dren's lives. The ACE program also provides participants with several layers of support, Rios said, including sight supervisor teachers who offer volunteers positive reinforcement and as well as mentor teachers during the school year and summer ses­sions. 
"It's basically set up for suc­cess," said Rios. 
In addition to the ACE pro­gram itself, Rios also considers his experiences at Notre Dame as a significant factor in initially stimulating his interest in service with children. After spending one semester of his sophomore year studying abroad in Mexico, Rios felt his outlook on society had greatly broadened. 
"That experience gave me a greater world perspective," said Rios. When deciding to work as a volunteer teacher, Rios reflect­ed back on his time in Mexico to help him make the choice to enter the ACE program. 
While at Notre Dame, Rios also participated in a wide array of service opportunities with chil­dren, including working with children's after school programs at La Casa de Amistad and help­ing Hispanic families to learn English through the Buen Vecino program. Rios tutored children at Notre Dame's Northeast Neighborhood Center and worked as a resident advisor in Zahm Hall during his senior year.

GRADUATE STUDENT UNION 
GSU outlines the

By ANDREW THAGARD 
Assistant News Editor 
The Graduate Student Union began its first meeting of the academic year Tuesday by dis­cussing proposed changes to its constitu­tion and outlining the organi­zation's goals for the coming 

Dale
year. 
In a fast paced meeting due mainly to President Tim Dale's commit­ment to limit each monthly meeting to one hour, members considered changing the consti­tution to give all committee members voting rights. The constitution currently only allows elected academic depart­ment representatives to vote, although in the past committee chairs have exercised a right to vote despite it being unconstitu­tional. The suggestion, accord­ing to Dale, was a move to align the constitution to practices within the meeting. 
"There are several things within the constitution that either seem ridiculous or make no sense," Dale said. 
The GSU, however, quickly became locked in debate as members questioned the logic behind diluting the power of elected members and giving some of it to representatives appointed by the president. In the end, members decided to maintain the current wording of the constitution but allow an open discussion at each meeting

Chiriboga supports the United States but feels as though tit may be overstepping its bounds. "The United States does a good job helping people, but it is too involved and let people resolve things on their own. It's their fight," said Chiriboga. 
Chiriboga recognizes that while this position may help the United States it may negatively affect the international commu­nity. "The world won't be able to feel safe until the United States and Mideast relations improve. If we allowed Iraq the situation to determine who could vote. 
Members unanimously approved stipend increases for the Social. Healthcare and Orientation Committee Chairs and approved the organization's 2002-03 budget. They also voted to allow the president to make himself or any voting member chairman of the meet­ing. 
Any of the motions that out­line constitutional changes will have to pass again at next month's meeting in order to go into effect, as dictated by the organization's constitution.

Once $2,000 dollars is raised, a bookshelf will be purchased and the interest earned on the remaining amount will be used to buy a reference book each year.

F-16s to fly over Stadium before Notre Dame-Michigan game 
Special to The Observer 

Two U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jets piloted by University of Notre Dame alumni will fly over Notre Dame Stadium just before the start of Saturday's football game between the Fighting Irish and the University of Michigan. The flyby is part of a national observance of POW/MIA Day. 
The participating pilots -1993 graduates Capt. Mark D'Auteuil and Capt. Pat Hund, 1989 graduate Maj. Tom Stewart, and 1986 graduate Maj. Dudley Kelsey -are based at Luke Air Force Base near Phoenix. Their appearance at Notre Dame is part of a cross-country training mission. 
Since 1979, POW/MIA Day has honored repa­triated soldiers and those still missing and unac­counted for during American wars abroad. Ceremonies are held throughout the United States and around the world on military installa­tions and ships at sea, with national veterans and civic organizations, and at state capitols, schools,_ churches, and police and fire depart­ments.

U.S. raises nation's terror alert level 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

The Bush administration raised the nationwide terror alert to its second-highest level, closed nine U.S. embassies overseas and heightened secu­rity at federal buildings and landmarks in America as new intelligence warned of car bombings. suicide attacks and other strikes linked to the Sept. 11 anniversary. 
Americans were urged Tuesday to be alert but unbowed -go to work, to school, on trips -despite spe­cific threats against U.S. inter­ests abroad and less credible concerns that terrorists might attack America again. 
After a hectic series of tele­phone calls and late-night meetings, President Bush's top advisers decided Monday to recommend raising the level from code yellow -"significant risk" of attack -to code orange -a "high risk." Bush met twice with the advisers Tuesday morning, the last time in the top-secret Situation Room, before telling them, "Let's do it." 
Despite no evidence of a plot against the United States. the Sept. 11 anniversary and intelli­gence gathered in the last 48 hours -some from a high­ranking al-Qaida operative ­prompted the decision. Tom Ridge, Bush's homeland securi­ty director, said plans for multi­ple attacks on U.S. targets in southeast Asia were in "an operational phase." 
Code orange is the highest alert level imposed since the system was established in March. The only higher status, code red, reflects a severe risk of attack on U.S. soil based on credible evidence. 
"The threats that we have heard recently remind us of the pattern of threats we heard prior to Sept. 11,'' Bush said on the eve of the anniversary. "We have no specific threat to America, but we're taking everything seriously." 
From immigration officers to meat inspectors. government workers were put on high alert as security precautions rivaled measures taken immediately after last year's attacks. 
Vice President Dick Cheney canceled a Tuesday night speech and was taken to a secret location to protect the presidential line of succession in case of an attack. He will remain in seclusion at least through the Sept. 11 obser­vances, a senior administration official said. 
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld ordered that live anti­aircraft missiles be stationed near launchers that had been deployed around Washington for a training exercise. 
Across the country, access was restricted to public places and events. Colorado Gov. Bill Owens, announcing security measures at the state Capitol, told residents. ''You should probably bring your driver's license" to the building. 
The government sent a sepa­rate alert to local law enforce­ment across the United States warning of possible scattered attacks. prompting discussions in communities on how best to protect potential targets like shopping malls, schools and public gatherings. 
Echoing the words of Attorney General John Ashcroft in a news conference earlier, the alert said: "Reporting also indicates that lower level al­Qaida operatives and sympa­thizers view the Sept. 11 time­frame as a suitable time to lash out in small strikes to demon­strate their worldwide presence and resolve. Widely dispersed. unsophisticated strikes are pos­sible." 
Local police were on edge. They urged residents to report any suspicious activity. 
"There's no such thing as a stupid phone call," said Lt. Kelly Willis, spokesman for the Des Moines, Iowa, police department. "We're here to be bothered." 
Among 15 or so U.S. diplo­matic posts closed overseas, the embassy in Jakarta and a con­sular office in Surabaya, both in Indonesia, were shut down due to what officials called credible and specific information about security threats. 

Bush to ask U.N. for help with Iraq 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
President Bush said Tuesday he will ask the United Nations "to deal with the problem" of Iraq and dispatched top members of his national security team to Capitol Hill to talk to skeptical lawmak­ers. 
Bush tied his goal of toppling Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to the war on terror he began after the Sept. 11 attacks a year ago. 
'Tm deeply concerned about a leader who has ignored the United Nations for all these years, refused to conform to resolution after resolution after resolu­tion, who has weapons of mass destruc­tion," Bush said during a visit to the Afghan Embassy. "And the battlefield has now shifted to America; so there's a different dynamic than we've ever faced before." 
The president does not plan to offer new information about an Iraqi threat or recommend any specific actions in his Thursday speech, a senior White House official said on condition of anonymity. Lawmakers said George Tenet, the direc­tor of central intelligence, and national security adviser Condoleezza Rice like­wise gave no new information in private congressional briefings Tuesday. 
Bush also continued phone conversa­tions on Iraq, talking to Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar of Spain, President Alvaro Uribe of Colombia and President Vicente Fox of Mexico. He plans to host Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi at Camp David Saturday, continuing a pattern of inviting like-minded leaders to the presi­dential retreat. 
Berlusconi has frequently allied him­self with Bush on foreign policy, and in a letter to a newspaper to be published Wednesday, laid out his strongest case yet in support of the U.S. demand for ousting the Iraqi president, saying pre­ventive military action was legitimate if Baghdad doesn't change its ways. 
U.S. allies and members of Congress have urged Bush to give them more evi­dence that Saddam's nuclear, biological and chemical weapons programs pose a direct threat. 
In his U.N. speech Thursday, the administration official said, Bush plans to respond with a challenge of his own: "What more do we need to know?" 
Outside experts and U.S. officials say Iraq probably has stocks of chemical and biological weapons and could make a nuclear bomb if it could obtain enough nuclear material. 
WORLD NEWS BRIEFS 
Iraq appeals to Arabs to confront U.S.: 
In conflicting signals, a senior Iraqi official on Tuesday called on Arabs to rise and "confront" America, barely a day after another official said Iraq wanted to be a trade partner. not a battlefield foe, with the United States. In the United Nations, meanwhile, U.N. chief arms inspector Hans Blix said there was no evidence from aerial photos or other sources that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction or is trying to build them. But he added there are still "many open questions" about Iraq's weapons programs that need to be answered. 
Arab station broadcasts Bin Laden tape: 
The Arab satellite station Al-Jazeera broadcast more excerpts of a videotape on Tuesday in which a male voice attributed to Osama bin Laden can be heard naming all 19 Sept. 11 hijackers and later the four leaders of the Sept. 11 attacks -Mohamed Atta. Marwan Al-Shehhi, Ziad Jarrah and Hani Hanjour. 
NATIONAL NEWS BRIEFS 
Medical helicopter crashes in S. Dakota: 
A medical helicopter crashed while taking a patient to a hospital in Sioux Falls, killing all four people on board, officials said Tuesday. The heli­copter, missing since late Monday, was found Tuesday morning in a field southeast of Doland in northeastern South Dakota, Gov. Bill Janklow said. "There arc no survivors," he said. The CarefHght air ambulance, leased by Avera St. Luke's Hospital in Aberdeen, was on its way from Aberdeen to the Heart Hospital of South Dakota in Sioux Falls with a patient, the pilot. a flight nurse and a flight medic, officials said. 
Police investigate Buzz Aldrin: 
Detectives are investigating a complaint that retired astronaut Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin punched a man in the face at the Luke Hotel on Rodeo Drive, after being asked to swear on a Bible that he'd been to the moon. 
FBI searches Islamic leader's home: 
Federal agents Tuesday searched the apartment of a prominent local Islamic leader charged with docu­ment fraud and a judge ordered him held without bail pending trial. FBI spokeswoman Beth Anne Steele wouldn't disclose details of the search. Sheik Mohamed Abdirahman Kariye pleaded innocent to felony charges of unlawful use of a Social Security number and unlawful possession of a U.S. govern­ment document. A trial is scheduled for Nov. 5. 
Map shows miners didn't have updates: 
A newly discovered map appears to show that mine operators didn't have the most recent survey of the area when nine miners got trapped for three days, authorities said Tuesday. The map found by federal investigators shows more exten­sive digging in an abandoned mine that was not shown on maps being used by the nine miners, mine safety officials said.

In an attempt to keep students out of the rain and snow in between campus­es this fall, Notre Dame and Saint Mary's consolidated the shuttle sched­ule by eliminating seven stops, includ­ing LeMans and Holy Cross Halls. 
According to Dan Skendzel, Notre Dame's director of administrative ser­vices, the stops that were eliminated either had a low rate of student use or could be easily served by a nearby stop. 
Prior to the implementation of the new plan for the shuttle schedule, there was a consensus between Notre Dame and Saint Mary's student gov­ernment and administration to amend the service. A portion of this decision was based on ridership data provided by shuttle operator, Coach USA. 
"In previous years the shuttle has been very unreliable, arriving and departing stops at various times because it could not possibly make all of its scheduled stops in the allotted time," Skendzel said. 
The revised schedule hopes to create a dependable 40-minute loop around Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and Holy Cross. A second bus services the Legal Aid Clinic and Robinson Learning Center on weekday afternoons. 
According to Rebecca Spann, a Saint Mary's freshman, who rides the shut­tle from McCandless Hall, the shuttle is occasionally early or late in the evening, but it is still faster than walk­ing to and from the two campuses. 
Although the new schedule has yet to increase efficiency and timeliness, Melissa Peters, LeMans Hall director said. "There have been no complaints about shuttle service at this time." 
The change in bus stops has not posed any security issues and has caused few complaints. 
"At this time there have been no official reports of security problems due to the location of the bus stops," said Dan Woods, Saint Mary's interim director of security.

After the tumultuous decades of crime and corruption, which occurred during its rocky transition from 75 years of Communism to a capitalist economy during the 90's, Russia has emerged as a prosperous country. 
This month Notre Dame welcomes Russian economist Victor Supyan, vis­iting fellow of the Kellogg Institute for International Studies and deputy director of the Institute of the USA and Canada Studies, Russian Academy of Sciences .. 
On Sept. 10, he gave a presentation entitled "The social and economic consequences of the Russian privati­zation" at the Hesburgh Center for International Studies. 
Supyan reviewed Russia's current economic situation. Its economy has been growing steadily since 1998 after experiencing a deep depression. Supyan said this economic growth is not directly connected with privatiza­tion as was initially expected. 
Rather, the four main reasons for economic success have been: 
. 
Import substitution (meaning focus­ing on the domestic market) 

. 
Solid growth in export volumes 

. 
Better tax collection 

. 
Increased domestic investments 


Supyan then discussed the three dif­ferent approaches to privatization Russia considered. The first, most lib­eral approach was "based on the proposition that the state's property should be sold to anyone who was ready to pay." 
Although this would have been the most economically efficient method, it was unref!,listic because no one, including criminals, had enough capi­tal to buy the huge amounts of land, and it would also be socially unfair. 
The second approach to privatiza­tion involved leftist forces such as trade unions and the socialist and communist parties who supposed that the enterprise assets should be trans­ferred or sold to them. 
This system had worked in Germany, but its shortcoming was that it ignored all other populations in the country. 
The third, called the voucher 
approach. advocated the free distribu­tion of state-owned property through­out the whole of the Russian popula­tion. Its limitations were that it did not create any economic incentive for the accumulation of capital and no effec­tive mechanism was introduced on how to utilize these potential shares of state property. 
The actual approach to privatization Russia employed in 1992 after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 most resembled the last "but was actually based on the shared interest among several social forces," said Supyan. 
It had the following six main objec­tives: create a middle class, increase employee productivity, social protec­tion, enhance financial stability, cre­ate strong national economy and attract foreign capital. 
Voucher privatization failed to fulfill its goals of economic effectiveness and foreign investment because companies did not make serious changes in orga­nizational and man­agerial structures, and it did not add to new investments. Supyan said, "The privatization in Russia did not create a stable middle class as was expected." 
Rather. it created a class of private own­ers. 
During the 1990's, political instability, legislation, a general economic slowdown and relativeIy high inflation also pre­vented privatization from taking off. 
The primary benefit of privatization, therefore, was the creation of the poten­tial for flow of capi­tal, a factor that allowed the Russian economy to flourish after 1998, said Supyan.

Boeing workers vote to go on strike 
Nearly 1,500 employees of Boeing's subur­ban Philadelphia plant have voted to go on strike early Saturday unless the company improves on a contract offer made Sunday. 
About 98 percent of the membership of United Aerospace Workers Local 1069 voted in favor of a strike, local President John DiFrancisco said Tuesday. He said the union offered to negotiate further but received no response from Boeing. 
Madelyn Bush, a Boeing spokeswoman, said no talks were scheduled. Bush didn't rule out further negotiations, but said a contract the company proposed on Sunday was "our best and final offer." 
United: No deadline extension yet 
United Airlines' new chief executive is wait­ing to see unions' proposal for a financial recovery plan before deciding whether a Monday deadline for reaching labor agree­ments should be pushed back, a spokesman said. Glenn Tilton said shortly after taking over the ailing carrier's top job last week that he might seek an extension to the Sept. 16 deadline imposed by his predecessor. 
Pilots union spokesman Steve Derebey said Tuesday that Tilton had indicated to union leaders that he was inclined to ask the Air Transportation Stabilization Board for about two more weeks to amend United's applica­tion for a $1.8 billion government loan guar­antee. 
Sidgmore to quit as WorldCom CEO 
WorldCom Inc. chief executive John Sidgmore said Tuesday he would step down as soon as a permanent replacement can be found to lead the bankrupt telecommunications provider. 
"I have concluded that having moved WorldCom through the initial phase of the bankruptcy process, now is the appropriate time for the company to initiate a search for a long-term CEO," said Sidgmore. who replaced former CEO Bernie Ebbers in April.

WASHINGTON 
Lawmakers asked the Justice Department on Tuesday to begin a crimi­nal investigation into whether Martha Stewart lied to a House committee trying to determine if she received inside information before selling her ImClone stock. 
"As members of Congress we believe it is our obligation to forward specific and credible infor­mation in our possession that could suggest a feder­al crime has been commit­ted," the Republican and Democratic leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee wrote to Attorney General John Ashcroft. 
Shares of Stewart's com­pany, Martha Stewart Omnimedia, jumped almost 10 percent immediately after the lawmakers' announcement Tuesday afternoon. Analysts said investors apparently viewed the referral to the Justice Department as preferable because it spares Stewart from hav­ing to appear before Congress under subpoena.

UC-Berkeley students 
receive hate e-mail 
Flight 93 victitns' falllilies visit crash site a year later 
Associated Pr<!ss 

SHANKSVILLE, Pa. 
Friends and family of the victims of United Flight 93 privately shared their grief and memories at the crash site Tuesday, a day before a public ceremo­ny marking the one-year anniversary. 
Preparations for Wednesday's event were put on hold for two hours as the nearly 500 people walked on the grassy field in western Pennsylvania to remem­ber their loved ones, who investigators believe overpowered the hijackers and prevented the plane from reaching its target. 
Reporters and the public were barred from the site, where 44 people died ­including the four hijackers -when the plane went down Sept. 11 just outside Shanksville. Family members later described the gathering as a healing way to remember the passengers and crew. 
The gathering was "solemn and sad, and yet celebratory," said Alice Hoglan, 52, of Los Gatos, Calif., whose son, Mark Bingham, was killed. "It was very heal­ing. It was almost a joyful event for me." 
"The most important thing to me is that we do not forget,"said Hamilton Peterson of Bethesda, Md., who lost his father and stepmother in the crash. 
Some of the relatives and friends were making their first visit to the site, about 70 miles southeast of Pittsburgh. 
Several spoke about the natural beau­ty of the site, against the backdrop of a tree line, and said it was a fitting resting place. 
"It was such a place that was so much about my brother, that there was actual­ly a comfort in it,"said Lori Guadagno, of Jacksonville, Fla., whose brother, Richard, died. 
On Wednesday morning, organizers expect some 20,000 people to attend a public memorial in a field a few hundred yards away from the crash site. 
At 10:06 a.m. the time the plane crashed. a bell will toll as the name of each victim is read. Scheduled speakers were to include homeland security chief Tom Ridge, who was Pennsylvania's governor at the time of the crash, and Sandy Dahl, the wife of Flight 93 pilot Jason Dahl. President Bush was expect­ed to visit privately with families at the crash site Wednesday afternoon.

Daily Californian 
BERKELEY, Calif. 

Some University of California­Berkeley students planning Wednesday's Sept. 11 memorial con­tinue to receive hate messages -a result of their widely publicized state­ments against distributing red.white and blue ribbons. 
Students began receiving hate e­mails and phone calls after a conserv­ative campus publication, The California Patriot, ran an online article on the decision made by the event's planning committee noL Lo hand out red, white and blue ribbons during the memorial. Some students received more than 200 hate e-mails each ­many containing racial slurs -over the issue. 
"You're nothing but an anti­American hate monger," said an anonymous e-mail sent to Graduate Assembly President Jessica Quindel. "You offend and disgust me and other veterans of this great country." 
ASUC President Jesse Gabriel and members of his office said they also received hate messages.Students who received hate messages said they have been unfairly singled out and added the messages have taken away from the memorial's importance. 
"The controversy has detracted from the idea of grieving the loss of life," Quindel said. "We're trying to include all voices and are being outcast and seen as wrong, which goes against American ideals. I think that shows the irony of trying to be patriotic." California Patriot writers said in a statement released Monday that they intended for their article to ignite a reaction but did not mean for it to result in hate messages or harm those involved in planning the memorial. 
"It's important to remember we shouldn't let (the students' decision] translate into vicious telephone and/or e-mail attacks directed towards those who wanted to keep red, white and blue out," the statement said. 
Sources quoted in the California Patriot's article, who wished to remain anonymous, said it misrepresented their views and included factually incorrect information. 
But editors of the publication said they presented all material accurately in the article. 
"It's a question of [them] lying or us [lying] and we have the notation to back it up," said Seth Norman, man­aging editor of the California Patriot. 
Steve Sexton, the writer of the arti­cle and former news editor of The Daily Californian, declined to comment on the allegations. 
Some Berkeley faculty members said the controversy has been blown out of proportion. 
"It's really sort of surprising how big an issue this has become," said politi­cal science professor Henry Brady. ''[The hate mail] shows the depth and concerns and fears that some people have and it's a shame that they've come out in this way." 
Last Thursday Berkeley Chancellor Robert Berdahl overruled the white­ribbon decision and allowed the use of ribbons that bear the colors of the U.S. flag. 
In a joint meeting the next day, organizers said they plan to distribute various colors of ribbons. including white. 
"I deeply resent the implication that by planning this service in this way, we are unpatriotic," said Berdahl at a press conference Thursday. 
"We believe it is a disservice to those who died to allow this memorial to become a political rally of any kind."

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Mother reflects on son's response to tragedy 
Stephen was home from Notre Dame for Christmas, 2001. He had described to us how the University had respond­ed on Sept. 11, and that was when I knew, more than ever, that he was in a good place. 
Over 6,000 people had turned out for Mass on South Quad. As a member of the Notre Dame Chorale, he sang with the Mass choir. Honestly, not only was I grateful he was where he was, I was also a little jealous. 
We had a remarkably usual Christmas in Pennsylvania. Stephen helped out the men's section of our parish choir on Christmas Eve, and the extended family gathered at my sis­ter's on the 25th. On Dec. 27, we made our customary holiday journey to visit his grandmother in Queens, N.Y., over the Vcrrazano-Narrows Bridge, past the now-altered Manhattan skyline. He grew quiet and reiterated his desire to visit Ground Zero. He had trained to be an EMT after his junior year of high school, volunteering Fridays and Saturdays, 6 p.m. to midnight, with the local ambulance corps during his senior year. Wanting to work in EMS at Notre Dame. he was told he needed to be certified as a firefighter. He took Firefighting I in Pennsylvania the sum­mer after his freshman year and was hired as a part-timer by the Notre Dame Fire Department in the days before Sept. 11. He felt part of the brotherhood of EMS workers and fire­fighters. 
We took the subway into Manhattan early on Dec. 28. The public viewing ramp was slated to open the following Monday. Walking past the makeshift memorials and plywood barricades, we could only glimpse the site. 
People had laid flowers, hung pic­tures of loved ones and left mementos of every sort from all across our nation and the world. There was a reverent silence. Someone put a pamphlet into my hand. The cover photo showed peo­ple running for their lives from the smoke and deadly debris of a collaps­ing tower. We kept walking and walk­ing, seemingly around an endless perimeter, drawn to but still afraid of the elusive look into the crater. Barricades were manned by armed soldiers and IDs were being examined scrupulously. 
It seemed we had come nearly full circle. Our son had grown more and more silent and despairing. I finally said. "If you are sure you have to see this, and if you really do want to see it, then you have to go up to that check­point, explain your situation and show that soldier your credentials. We'll wait here for you." 
He looked from the barricade to the soldier to the inner-circle ramp that went up to the site and back to us, turned and strode to the guard. We sheltered in the lee of an office build­ing (we weren't allowed inside because of security precautions) and watched. It was the coldest day of 2001. 
Stephen spoke to the soldier. He offered two IDs. Each was thoroughly checked, each picture held up for com­parison. More discussion. 
Then -he's in. Not a look back in our direction. Head down, he's moving precisely as directed, as if in proces­sion. (He didn't spend all those years in Catholic school for nothing.) Up the ramp. Out of sight. Later we learn that he was told to be very careful about saying anything -that "victims' family members could be there." 
Twelve minutes later he emerges, as grim-faced as a 19-year-old can be. "Unreal doesn't begin to describe it," is all he can say. 
We walk the long way back. He wants to leave his Notre Dame Fire Department shirt at the fence memori­al. By this time there's a crowd -we start to get separated. He points and calls out, 'TU meet you there!" 
We slowly make our way "there," a triangular street corner, with saw­horse barricades I can Jean on, wearily grateful. I still have the pamphlet that was pressed into my hand two hours earlier. It offers carefully non-denomi­national spiritual comfort. I slowly realize that the horrifying photo on the cover was taken from the spot on which I am standing. Now I'm the silent one. 
Notre Dame, Our Mother, pray for us.

GUEST COLUMN 
Mark this anniversary with inclusive vision 
One year ago, in the days before the terrorist attacks, Sept. 11 was a date like any other. It had no symbolic importance, its mention did not elicit a vis­ceral sinking or a mental vortex of nightmarish images. 
One year ago, had you asked me if Sept.· 11 would be an Mike Still important day, I would have said, "Well, it'll be a busy day ... I have to get to the involvement 
Daily

fair by 9 a.m. and then be back 
Collegian

at my apartment to wait for the cable-internet guy to get me online." 
One year ago, the top stories were Chandra Levy and stem-cell research. 
Things are a bit different now from a year ago. Following the attacks, our nation and the world have acted in ways that hitherto seemed impossible. 
Americans rallied together as a people in a way unseen since the Second World War. There was an outpouring of support throughout the world from countries as disparate as Russia and Malaysia. For the first time since the 1979 revolution, no chants of "Death to America" were uttered at the Friday public prayer sessions in Iran. 
And George W. Bush, a man seemingly better suit­ed for the Waffle House than the White House, rose to the occasion and became a leader. 
On Sept. 11, the Kegmeister grew up. He was no longer two sizes too small for his office. He realized that success in his war on terrorism would be fleet­ing without deep and true international support. So Bush's folks, led by Secretary of State Colin Powell and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, fanned out across the globe, searching for international part­ners to vanquish the looming and hidden threat. 
Although improbable and without precedent, deep and true international support seemed within reach. In the days after the September attacks, nation after nation agreed to help Bush snuff out terror cells. British Prime Minister Tony Blair called on the inter­national community to "reorder this world around us" and "create lasting good out of the shadow of evil." Pakistan agreed to allow the United States like renegade cowboys on the issue of a global cam­paign against terrorism. 
But something happened in the first, long year after Sept. 11. Bush mistook a world sympathetic to the horror and pain of the terrorist attacks for an international mandate to allow unchecked United States military action across the world. He mistook national grief as a cry to create an imperial presidency, whose decisions were beyond question and actions above scrutiny. 
Bush now feels as though he has an unlimited mandate, one which covers the right to wage war on Saddam Hussein's Iraq. 
There is no doubt that Hussein is a vile dicta­tor. He is a man who has used chemical weapons on his own people, a man who has actively pur­sued the develop­ment of weapons of mass destruction. But does he present such a security risk that we might send a quarter million of our American sons, daughters, friends and siblings over to the Persian Gulf region, a large number of whom might never come back? Does he present such a security risk that we should risk generating increased anti­Americanism throughout the Arab world and beyond? 
According to CIA officials, proof of links between Iraq and al Qaeda are sketchy at best. Says Sen. Chuck

right to wage war on radical Muslims, we now find 
that through unilateral decision-making and disre­
spect of international opinion, global support for the 
United States has fallen to levels seldom experi­
enced. Even Britain is a bit shaky about whether to 
get into the Hussein ouster game. One year later, we need to remind our­selves that it was not Iraq that struck at our capital, scarred Pennsylvania, and caused the World Trade Center to fall, but terrorists blinded by violent and hateful rage towards America -precisely the ;-. type of rage engendered 'l-'t by unilateral action and · t the flouting of interna­tional coalitions. One year later, we need to reflect on 
the horror of Sept. 11, honor those we lost and find solace and pride in our ability to come together as a nation. 
We need to show the rest of the world that our 
response to the ter­ror attack will con­tinue to be one based

NATIONAL LEAGUE 

Graves' first career start a shutout for Reds 
.., 
Associaced Press 
CINCINNATI 
Russell Branyan hit a solo horner to back Danny Graves and four relievers who com­bined on a six-hitter that led the Cincinnati Reds over the Pittsburgh Pirates 3-0 Tuesday night. 
Cincinnati, which gave Graves his first career start, got its sixth shutout of the sea­son and sent Pittsburgh to its 14th shutout loss. The Pirates (63-82) are ensured of a 10th straight losing season, a fran­chise record that broke the mark set from 1949 through 1957. 
They are the 18th major league franchise to record at least 10 consecutive losing seasons, a group that includes the 1945 to 1955 Reds. 
The crowd of 13,153 was Cincinnati's third-smallest of the season. 
Branyan 's sixth-inning homer off Kip Wells (12-14). his 11th since the Reds acquired him from Cleveland on June 7, cleared the 40-foot "batter's eye" wall located 393 feet away in center field. He is the fourth player and first Red to clear the wall since it was built before the 2001 season. 
Jose Guillen and Aaron Boone added run-scoring hits in the eighth. 
Chris Reitsma (6-10) pitched 3 1-3 innings in relief of Graves, who threw three innings. Scott Sullivan got a popup and strikeout to strand the bases loaded in the sev­enth. 
After not earning a save since May 3, 2000, Scott Williamson got his second in two nights. 
Graves, Cincinnati's closer since 1999, had made 363 relief appearances, the most by any pitcher making his first start since Los Angeles' Terry Adams also compiled 363 relief appearances before starting at Arizona on June 5 last year. 

Chuck McElroy, who played for the Reds from 1999 to 1996, set the record by mak­ing 603 relief appearances before starting for Baltimore against Oakland on Sept. 2, 2000. 
Graves, whose career high is four innings, threw 38 pitches. 25 for strikes, before rookie Wily Mo Pena pinch hit for him and got an infield single in his first major league plate appearance. Graves allowed two hits and walked none but hit two batters. 
Wells allowed five hits in six innings. He has lost three straight decisions for the sec­ond time this season. 
Braves 12, Mets 6 

Just because they've already clinched the NL East. the Atlanta Braves don't have to stop beating up on the New York Mets. 
A day after wrapping up their 11th straight division title, the Braves overcame a five-run deficit for a victory over New York behind two homers from Andruw Jones and five RBIs from pinch-hit­ters. 
Jones homered in four straight at-bats, going back to Saturday's game against Montreal. He became only the 11th player in NL history to accomplish the feat. 
Trey Hodges (1-0) earned the win in his big league debut. Mets starter Pedro Astacio (12-9) gave up four homers and was ejected in the fifth inning after he plunked Gary Sheffield in the arm with a pitch. 
The Braves, who have base­ball's best record, missed a chance to clinch themselves by losing Sunday to Montreal. 
They were idle Monday when the Mets defeated Philadelphia, handing the Braves another division cham­pionship. 
The team noted the accom­plishment before the game, showing season highlights on the video board and unveiling a 2002 pennant alongside the 10 others that have been won since 1991. 
New York's Hoger Cedeno dampened the mood on the first pitch of the game. homer­ing into the center-field seats against Damian Moss. 
Moss gave up four more runs in the second, including a mammoth homer by Mike Piazza. The left-hander was lifted for a pinch-hitter in the bottom half, leaving him with the shortest start of his career. 
Moss might have escaped the second without any damage if Chipper Jones had not lost a flyball in the lights, giving Joe McEwing a leadoff double. 
Moss retired the next two hitters, but Cedeno and Raul Gonzalez followed with run­scoring singles and Piazza hit a 434-foot drive into the left­field seats for his 28th homer, a two-run shot. 
Chipper Jones picked up that hit right away, looking sky­ward to follow the flight of the ball without moving a step. 
But the Braves responded as if they were mad at the Mets for taking away their chance to celebrate on the field. 
Marlins 6, Phlllles 4 

Mike Redmond wasn't sup­posed to play in the opener of Florida's doubleheader against Philadelphia on Tuesday night, then provided the much of the Marlins' offense. 
Redmond, who entered dur­ing a double switch in the sixth inning, hit a tiebreaking two-run homer in the seventh inning and had three RBI in Florida's 6-4 win. 
"It was one of those things where I was kind of relaxing, waiting for the second game," Redmond said. "But you always have to be ready, and when they told me I was going to double switch, l went and had a catch to get ready." 
He connected off Randy Wolf (11-8) for his second homer of the season. It followed a lead­off single by Mike Mordecai, who had three hits. 
'Tm not a big home-run hit­ter so it surprised me as much as it surprised everyone else," Redmond said. 
"Actually I foresaw what was going to happen," Marlins manager Jeff Torborg jokingly said when asked about the double switch, made to allow reliever Vladimir Nunez to pitch two innings. 
Derrek Lee had a bases­loaded triple in the first inning for the Marlins, who sent the Phillies to their eighth loss in nine games. 
"I know that those things are going to happen," Wolf said of the first inning. "You just have to try and minimize them." 
Graeme Lloyd (4-4) pitched a hitless sixth in relief of Julian Tavarez, who gave up three runs, seven hits and five walks in five innings. Armando Almanza pitched the ninth for his second save in four chances. 
Wolf, who had been 6-0 in eight starts since a July 21 loss to Atlanta, gave up five runs and seven hits in seven innings. 
After falling behind, Philadelphia got a run from Tomas Perez's second-inning RBI grounder, then tied it in the fifth when Bobby Abreu hit an RBI double and scored on a single by Travis Lee, who had three hits. 
Abreu was thrown out at the plate in the third by second baseman Luis Castillo, who took the throw from Kevin Millar after Pat Burrell dou­bled. 
Cardinals 8, Brewers 3 

Matt Morris, activated from the disabled list before the game, allowed one run in five innings Tuesday night as the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Milwaukee Brewers 8-3. · 
Eduardo Perez hit a three­run homer and Scott Rolen had a solo shot for the Cardinals, who have won seven straight for the first time since a nine-game streak from Sept. 8-22 last year. St. Louis maintained a 5{-game lead over second-place Houston in the NL Central. 
Morris (16-7). who went on the disabled list Aug. 24 after straining his left hamstring the previous day against Philadelphia, allowed five hits, struck out three and walked one. He threw 7 4 pitches, 44 for strikes. 
Milwaukee's only run off him came on Jim Rushford's RBI single in the second. The Brewers' 51-94 record is the worst in the National League and they went 2-for-9 with runners in scoring position, making them 3-for-32 in their last three games. 
Wayne Franklin (1-0), mak­ing his first major league start, allowed six runs _ five earned _ and six hits in five­plus innings. 
Perez homered in the fourth for a 3-1 lead, and St. Louis added a run later in the inning when Edgar Renteria stole second, took third when catch­er Robert Machado's throw went wide and high into cen­ter field and came around when Jeffrey Hammonds' throw went past third for another error.

AMERICAN LEAGUE 
Burkett gets win in Red Sox rout of Rays 
Associated Press 
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. 

John Burkett snapped a seven­game winless streak and Manny Ramirez homered for the second straight day as the Boston Red Sox beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 12-1 Tuesday night. 
Doug Mirabelli and Nomar Garciaparra each hit a two-run homer for Boston, which began the day 7 1/2 games behind the Anaheim Angels in the AL wild­card race. 
Burkett (11-7) gave up one run and six hits in seven innings for his first win since July 27. He had been 0-4 with an 8.47 ERA in his la.st seven starts. 
Ramirez also hit an RBI dou­ble. He has seven homers and 20 HBls against Tampa Bay this season. 
Aubrey Huff extended his career-high hitting streak to 17 games with a fifth-inning homer for the Devil Rays. 
Joe Kennedy (7-11) lost his third straight start, giving up seven runs and seven hits in six innings. The Devil Rays (48-96) have the fewest wins by an AL team after 144 games since the 1979 Toronto Blue Jays were 46-98. 
Ramirez hit his 28th homer in the third, an opposite-field solo shot that put Boston up 2-0. 
The Red Sox went ahead 7-1 with a five-run sixth. Ramirez and Cliff Floyd hit consecutive RBI doubles. After Benny Agbayani drove in a run with a single, Mirabelli hit a two-run homer. 
Garciaparra hit a two-run homer during a four-run sev­enth that made it 11-1. Pinch­hitter Freddy Sanchez delivered a two-run single in bis major league debut. 
Yankees 5, Orioles 2 Yankees 3, Orioles 1 
Jeff Weaver made the most out of his rare opportunity to start. 
Weaver allowed one run in eight innings and Raul Mondesi homered as the New York Yankees completed a sweep of a split doubleheader with a 3-1 victory over the Baltimore Orioles on Tuesday night. 
Rookie Juan Rivera drove in two runs, including a tiebreak­ing single in the seventh, and Andy Pettitte (10-5) allowed one run in 7 1-3 innings to lead New York to a 5-2 victory in the opener. 
The Yankees have won seven of eight, reducing their magic number to 10 for clinching their fifth straight AL East title. 
Joe Torre's second-game line­up looked more like a split­squad team from spring training than the regular Yankees. 
Alfonso Soriano, Derek Jeter, Jason Giambi, Bernie Williams, Jorge Posada and Robin Ventura sat out in favor of Enrique Wilson, Alex Arias, John Vander Wal, Chris Widger and Ron Coomer. 
But it proved to be enough against the Orioles, who have lost 16 of 17 games. 
After Chris Richard's RBI dou­ble gave Baltimore a 1-0 lead in the second inning, the Yankees tied it in the third. 
John Vander Wal and Rivera opened the inning with line dri­ves to left field. Marty Cordova just missed on diving attempts on both balls, putting runners on second and third. 
With one out, Vander Wal scored on a passed ball by Brook Fordyce, narrowly beating Fordyce's throw to Sidney Ponson (7-6). 
With one out in the fourth, Mondesi hit his 26th homer, giv­ing the Yankees 209 on the sea­son -second-most in franchise history. Led by Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle, New York hit 240 homers in 1961. 
Rivera added an RBI single to right in the seventh inning, giv­ing him three RBIs on the day and four in his career as he tries to win a spot on New York's postseason roster. 
Weaver (9-11). making his second start since Aug. 1, allowed four hits and retired 20 of his last 21 batters. He has had a tough time cracking the Yankees' deep starting rotation since being acquired from Detroit on July 5. 
Steve Karsay pitched the ninth for his 11th save and seventh straight since Mariano Rivera went on the disabled list Aug. 19. 
The Yankees didn't walk a batter for the sixth straight game, extending their walkless streak to 58 innings since Pettitte walked Boston's Nomar Garciaparra in the fifth inning last Wednesday. 
Only 8,875 fans showed up for opener. a makeup of a June 6 rainout -New York's smallest crowd of the year. 
Pettitte left with a 2-1 lead after giving up a one-out double in the eighth to Luis Matos. After an error by first baseman Nick Johnson, Ramiro Mendoza got out of a first-and-third jam by getting Jerry Hairston to hit into a double play. 
Mendoza allowed a ninth­inning homer to Tony Batista before Mike Stanton got the last out for his fourth save. 
Baltimore starter Jason Johnson (4-13), bothered by an upset stomach, allowed two runs and four hits in 6 1-3 innings. 
Blue Jays 5, Indians 4 
On a night when a bunch of rookies played like veterans. a veteran made a rookie mistake that cost the Cleveland Indians the game. 
Reliever Mark Wohlers made a throwing error in the ninth inning that allowed Shannon Stewart to score the go-ahead run as the Toronto Blue Jays beat the Indians 5-4 Tuesday night. 
With runners on first and sec­ond and one out, Vernon Wells smashed a grounder back to Wohlers (2-4), who spun around and made a wild throw to sec­ond base. 
Wohlers had plenty of time to wait for shortstop Omar Vizquel to get to second and make the throw, but just rushed it, Indians interim manager Joel Skinner said. 
"I just turned and fired and threw it to nobody," Wohlers said. "I knew as soon as I let it go, the result wasn't going to be too good." 
The Indians and Blue Jays, both rebuilding, have a com­bined 25 rookies on their ros­ters. Eleven rookies started Tuesday's game including both starting pitchers. Cleveland was mathematically eliminated from contention with the loss. 
Indians catcher Victor Martinez, making his major league debut. hit a single to shallow left to drive in a pair of runs in the seventh and tie it at 4. 
Martinez's first career hit and RBI chased Justin Miller, who was in control through six innings. 
"I just threw my hands toward the ball and finally I got a little blooper, but I'll take it anyway," Martinez said. "I was so happy. That's all I can say." 
Ellis Burks hit his 28th home run, a two-run shot in the fourth.

Sampras, Agassi will sit out Davis Cup to rest 

Pete Sampras follows through on a serve in the U.S. Open. Sampras won the tournament and will sit out this weekend's Davis Cup to rest. 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK 

The all-American U.S. Open final between Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi took enough out of both play­ers to keep them off the Davis Cup team. 
Sampras beat Agassi to win the U.S. Open on Sunday, and told team cap­tain Patrick McEnroe a day later that he wasn't ready to play in next week­end's Davis Cup semifinal match against France in Paris. 
"I think Pete needs time to digest what happened and decide what he wants to do," McEnroe said Tuesday. "I think he's just worn out, and I cer­tainly understand that." 
Once the United States' top two players passed on the chance, McEnroe chose Andy Roddick, James Blake. Todd Martin and Mardy Fish to play France on the clay at Roland Garros. home of the French Open. 
Roddick and Blake will play singles, and there is a good chance that Blake and Martin will comprise the doubles team. That pair beat Mahesh Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi, the U.S. Open doubles champions, to win the ATP Tour's event in Cincinnati last month. 
Sampras eliminated Roddick in the 
U.S. Open quarterfinals en route to his first singles title since winning Wimbledon in 2000. 
"It's time for the younger guys to take the baton and run with it," said McEnroe, whose term as captain was extended by two years on Tuesday. "This is a big step, we're relying on them." 
Agassi had previously decided that he wasn't going to play, but McEnroe held out hope that he would change his mind. 
"I really want the guys who want to be there," McEnroe said. ''I've seen too many situations in Davis Cup when the so-called best players were there and didn't want to be there for whatever reason. And that never works." 
McEnroe said that had Agassi won the U.S. Open, he thinks Agassi's Davis Cup decision might have changed. 
"I think Andre was devastated with his loss," McEnroe said. "Andre has said all along he is not going to play Davis Cup. I wasn't surprised that he declined." 
Sampras, who has won a record 14 Grand Slam singles titles, has never advanced past the semifinals on the red clay of Roland Garros, losing in the first round this year McEnroe noted that. saying that having Sampras on the team didn't guarantee a U.S. victory. 
"I had a conversation with Pete that was very honest and very straightfor­ward," McEnroe said. "When he told me that he's exhausted and having lots of emotions, that was pretty much the answer." 
Sebastien Grosjean, Arnaud Clement, Fabrice Santoro and Michael Llodra were chosen last week to rep­resent defending champion France in the semifinal, scheduled for Sept. 20­22. 
The United States and France have met 13 times in Davis Cup play, with the Americans holding a 7-6 advan­tage. 
The last match between France and the United States at Roland Carros was the 1932 final, which France won 3-2. France hasn't played there since 1982, when it defeated Czechoslovakia in a quarterfinal. 
"I think our chances are excellent," McEnroe said. "Obviously, playing in Paris will be difficult, but we're look­ing forward to it. The guys really wanted to play at Roland Garros."

Miami receiver to miss next game after surgery 
Associated Press 

CORAL GABLES, Fla. 
Miami receiver Andre Johnson will miss Saturday's game at Temple after having surgery on his left shoulder. 
Johnson. who leads the team with seven catches for 100 yards and two touch­downs, had surgery Monday to remove loose particles. His arm was in a sling Tuesday, and Hurricanes coach Larry Coker said Johnson will not practice this 
week. 

Coker did not set a date for Johnson's return but said he expects him to play Sept. 21 against Boston College. 
The 6-foot-3 junior caught four passes for 56 yards in the top-ranked Hurricanes' 41-16 win over Florida on Saturday, play­ing with discomfort in his shoulder for the second consecutive week. 
"It's something that's been bothering him, and something needed to be done," Coker said. 
The surgery comes before what should be the easiest part of Miami's schedule ­a three-game stretch against Temple, Boston College and Connecticut. After that, the Hurricanes have a week off before playing No. 5 Florida State. 
"He was hurting a little bit last week, but it was a big game and he toughed it out," teammate Vernon Carey said. "Now he wants to get ready for the rest of the season." 
With Johnson out. the Hurricanes will turn to Ethenic Sands, Kevin Beard and Roscoe Parrish. Coker said freshmen Akieem Jolla and Ryan Moore also wiil play Saturday against the Owls, a team Miami has outscored 180-24 over the last four meetings. 
The Hurricanes also lost defensive tack­le Santonio Thomas for the rest of the sea­son. Thomas, a 6-foot-4, 302-pound junior, tore a chest muscle against the Gators. 
He will redshirt this season, leaving him with two years of eligibility. 
Thomas played sparingly the last two seasons. He was a backup behind William Joseph, Vince Wilfork and Matt Walters this year. 
"He's in good spirits and in great shape," Coker said. "He's very upbeat about it. He said, 'Coach, you wanted to redshirt me anyway, didn't you?' I said, 'Maybe, maybe not."' 
against Akron may not have been the team's 50 carries or its 209 rushing yards, but rather the way the running backs ran -straight ahead. 
In his short tenure as the Terps' coach, Ralph Friedgen has hammered home the impor­tance of his running backs run­ning from north to south. Many attribute his philosophy to the success of junior tailback Bruce Perry, who improved greatly in that area last season on his way to becoming the ACC Offensive Player ofthe Year. 
That element of the Terps' ground game was absent in their season-opening loss to Notre Dame, and they needed it to come from sophomore tail­back Jason Crawford, who joined the Terps last season with a reputation as a big, pun­ishing back. 
Save for his first few runs against Notre Dame, Crawford didn't have many plays up the

PGAmay cut Tour tourney players 
Associated Press 
The PGA Tour policy board is considering reducing the number of players in as many as 10 tournaments next year. 
"It's a matter of daylight more than anything else," Olin Browne, a policy board mem­ber, said over the weekend at the Canadian Open. "It's oner­ous to expect a guy to warm up in the dark or finish in the dark." 
That was the case at the Phoenix Open this year. one of the events targeted for change. Because of frost delays and limited daylight, 21 players didn't finish the first round and 25 players had ~ to return Saturday morning to complete the second round. The tour policy is for full-field events to have 144 players before April, and 156 players during daylight-saving times (with a few exceptions). Browne said the board has proposed reducing fields by 12 players at certain events. 
Among those targeted are the Sony Open, Phoenix Open and Nissan Open early in the season, along with Greensboro and Tampa Bay in the fall. The issue now goes to the Players Advisory Council, which will poll PGA Tour members. A final decision is expected at the next policy board meeting in November. 
"Most members are not in favor," Browne said. "The board isn't in favor of it, either. I think we all agree that everyone should have as many opportunities to play as possible. But we should be able to start and finish in day· light."

Sophomore Kevin Goldthwaite earned co-Big East Player of the Week honors for his solid defen­sive efforts against Seton Hall on Saturday. Goldthwaite tallied two assists against the Pirates, bringing his season total to three. 
In addi­tion, Irish forward Erich Braun was named Braun to the 11­player College Soccer News Team of the Weck for last week. His two goals against Seton Hall in just over 10 minutes helped garner Braun this nomination. He now leads the Irish with four goals in three games.

FOOTBALL 

Michigan's Navarre looks to anchor offense 
8COUNDl!tl 
4. crowd pleasing comedy presented by the Repertory Theater of 4.merica 
friday, September 13 9:00P~ Washington nall 


ByKATIEMcVOY Associate Sports Ediror 
On Saturday Michigan will enter Notre Dame Stadium and not one of the players will have ever played on Notre Dame turf. The defense may not be so wor­ried. Michigan's has been touted as one of the strongest defensive units in the country. But what about the Michigan offense? 
The Wolverine offense will be facing a very solid Notre Dame defense, one that has shut down two teams' passing game and one team's running game. They will face off against a veteran defense. And they will face off amidst the yells and screams of a green student section and an alumni section that wouldn't put Michigan high on its list of favorite schools. So who can they depend on? 
They will all tell you John Navarre. 
"I have had confidence since he got here and took over for Drew Henson in 2000," said senior tight end Bennie Joppru. "He is playing with more confi­dence now. and I think that is very dangerous." 
Navarre, the senior quarter­back from Cudahy, Wis., has started the last 16 games. After taking over for Henson in 2000, he started all 12 games last sea­son, attempting a record 385 passes. 
As he enters this Saturday's game, Navarre is just a little more than 500 yards short of reaching the 4,000-yard mark. He would be only the eighth quarterback in Michigan football history to reach that landmark. He is eighth on the Michigan career passing yards list and seventh on the career touch­down list with 32. If he contin­ues to play well this season he could move all the way to sec­ond on that list, finishing 2002 behind Elvis Grbac's 71 touch­downs record. 

But those stats aren't as key this weekend when Michigan comes to Notre Dame as the fact that Navarre has game experi­ence. 
"I think anytime you would rather have a guy that has some experience in those kinds of games [road games]." said Michigan coach Lloyd Carr. "In terms of this game, I think that the fact that John has played in a lot of big games on the road will help him certainly." 
Navarre started this season with a career-high 286 yards against Washington. But he hasn't faced a secondary like Notre Dame's. If he wants to add any more yards to that 3,460, he's going to have to protect the ball. 
"[Protecting the ball] is a big premium every game but espe­cially against a team that is dan­gerous," Navarre said. "With the speed that they have and what they have done in the past cou­ple of games, you have to be especially careful." 
Navarre, who through 13 interceptions last season, would hate to add one more to the two­interception total this season. Navarre took some heat last season and losing the ball was a contributing factor. But his team is focused on helping him keep the ball this season, even against a defense like Notre Dame's. 
"l think [Navarre] has a lot more confidence," said junior running back Chris Perry. "Last year he took a lot of heat that he didn't deserve. But the support­ing cast didn't help him out too much either. Everyone is a Jot stronger and we know our assignments, which in turn makes everyone look a lot bet­ter." 
But before he can focus on protecting the ball, he needs to just focus on the ball. The ques­tion buzzing around the weekly Michigan press conference on Monday was whether Navarre could focus on the game despite the distractions of playing in Notre Dame Stadium. 
It goes without saying that the crowd will be hyped for this game. And, although Notre Dame Stadium doesn't rival sta­diums like Nebraska's for its noise, the crowd will do its best to be a distraction. 
"You cannot look at the big picture and all the surroundings and noise," Navarre said. "You have to focus on what you are doing and what your offense is doing." 
As Navarre looks to better his 
58.3 career completion percent­age amidst the hoots and hollers of Notre Dame stadium, Carr is worried about just one thing ­communication. 
"The question is if you have guys that can hear, and some­times you can't hear," the coach said. "There are stadiums out there where you can't hear and you have to feel the guy next to you." 

So is Navarre ready for this game? Is he preparing any dif­ferently? 
"You have to ask John that question," senior offensive line­man Tony Pape said. "He pre­pares every game like any other 
game." And if you ask him, he's just focused on getting his job done. 
Navarre said, "If we play like we did on Saturday, if we con­trol the ball and stop the defense like we did last week, things will take care of themselves."

Play ball 
Following Sept. 11} 2001} sports show American spirit lives on 
Associated Press While this week will be a chance for Americans to reflect on the tragic events of the last year, this past week­end exhibited why sports are so important to this country's psyche. Whether it was the intensity of team competition or the beauty of a one-on-one battle, sports has done so much over the past 12 months to heal America's wounds. It has provided a brief escape from "the real world", and may be the only part of American society that hasn't changed post-Sept. 11 -that is, if you don't count the longer lines for security checks. It was a banner weekend for most American sports, from the kickoff of the NFL season to the complete domination by Americans at the U.S. Open. More important is the fact that everyone got a chance to see that New York has started to recover and rebuild. The NFL season started in spectacular fashion Thursday as 500,000 fans jammed into Times Square for a blowout concert, followed by San Francisco's exciting 16-13 win over the New York Giants. The kickoff party was the league's way of demonstrating the resilience of the Big Apple. "They really wanted to show the country, and the world, 
that New York City is back," 
said John Collins, the NFL's senior vice president of mar­keting and entertainment. 
That was only the beginning of an outstanding weekend for America's passion. The NFL saw three games decided in overtime, one in the final minute and 10 others decided by one touchdown or less. The only other time there were three overtime games on opening weekend was 1979. 
Across town from Times Square, the U.S. Open was preparing itself for an All­American final on both the men's and women's side of the draw. 
The Williams sisters squared off in a Grand Slam final for the third time this season, and like the previous two, Serena got the best of Venus, who had America in her heart wearing a red, white and blue tradi­tional tennis dress. 
Two American old-timers renewed their rivalry in the men's final. as Pete Sampras

It was beau­impending labor strike was "You need to get people's tiful being here." averted at the last minute. minds off of it. And for some­
thing good to happen is great." But not all American sports shined this weekend. 
The United States basketball team finished an unbelievable sixth at the World Championships in Indianapolis, the hotbed of American basketball. They had been 58-0 in international competition when using NBA players. It was an outcome worse than anyone could have envisioned coming into the tournament. resulting in the country's worst showing in history at a World Championships. 
"I still think we're the best, the model for the world, but people are catching up. They beat us, and they beat us in our own country. We have to tip our hat to them," USA coach George Karl said. 
While patriotism has been prevalent at sporting events since Sept. 11, the United States appeared to play with­out passion in this tourna­ment. It seemed the Americans were foreigners in their own home. Teams like Turkey, Argen tin a and Yugoslavia had rabid fans that spurred on their squads with a wild patriotic fervor. 
"We didn't play the right way, we didn't play with the passion of the other teams," Antonio Davis said. 
The American players seemed to have adapted the fans apathy. The stands were mostly empty when the Americans were on the court and those who did attend showed nowhere near as much spirit as their foreign counterparts. 
Heck, there were more peo­ple watching the U.S. Open on an outdoor 20-foot screen in midtown Manhattan than were at the fifth-place game which America lost to Spain. 
Despite the lack of spirit in Indianapolis, every weekend millions of Americans go to sporting events all over the country. ranging from NASCAR racing to college foot­ball. They provide a chance for us to forget for a few hours what is happening in our lives and live vicariously through those athletes and teams. 
It may have been taken somewhat for granted before the terrorist attacks, but the role of sports became increas­ingly evident afterward. And that is something that will hopefully never change.
