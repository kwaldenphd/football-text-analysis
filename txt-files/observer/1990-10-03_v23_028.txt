INSIDE COLUMN 

Bad taste shown in front page caption 
Some days I pick up the paper when it re­turns from our printer and feel strongly that we have served the community well in that particular issue. Other days I feel we could have Alison Cocks done better. 
Yesterday I looked Editor-in-Chief at the caption on our front page photo and started pricing one­way plane tickets to Timbuktu. 
It wasn't born of a desire to shirk inevitable phone calls and letters from the public. Rather, I was disturbed at what I read because the caption perpetuated the racial stereotypes which still taint our community. 
I have always endeavored to instill in this staff an awareness of the need to treat all types of people on this campus fairly and objectively. It upset me, therefore, that rather than working to dispel such racist nonsense, we perpetuated it on our front page. 
The night editors responsible for writing the caption were not motivated by racist sentiments. I am certain of that. The cap­tion was instead a product of carelessness and ignorance. 
However, not knowing is no excuse. Igno­rance and insensitivity are dangerous qualities in journalists. 
The Multicultural Executive Council is 
providing the students with an excellent op­
portunity to challenge themselves outside 
the classroom. They should be applauded 
for their efforts. We did just the opposite on 
page one yesterday. On behalf of The Ob­
server, I offer them my sincerest apologies. 
More importantly, I owe the community an apology for the sentiments expressed in yesterday's paper. Unfortunately, I cannot read every piece of copy before it hits the presses every day. I am still responsible for everything that appears in The Observer, however. 
Since I can't be here all the time, I must ensure that the night staff understands what is appropriate material for the news section. Obviously, I failed them in that re­gard, and through them, the community I work hard to serve. 
If I could somehow hit 'rewind' and point out the error to Monday's staff before the paste-up boards left for the printer, I would. Since I can't unprint the paper, all I can do is assure the community that the en­tire staff learned an important language lesson yesterday. 
And we'll be back tomorrow, continuing 
to do our best to serve Notre Dame and 
Saint Mary's. There are days, like yesterday, 
when our best could be a lot better. But the 
community should never doubt our sincere 
desire to serve it well. 

Nor my own sincerity in saying, once 
again, that we made a foolish error and we 
are sorry.

Hall Presidents Council debates national gay and lesbian day 
By DAVID KINNEY News Writer 
The Hall Presidents Council discussed the National Coming Out Day for gays and lesbians Tuesday in response to the Stu­dent Senate resolution passed Monday concnrning thn nvent. 
The IIPC debated over how it should deal with the issue of the day, which will involve a va­rinty of events aimed at increasing the awareness of the discrimination of gays and les­bians. The group was divided over whether the IIPC should support or oppose the senate resolution, draw up a resolu­tion of its own, or not address the issue. 
The senate passed the resolu­tion acknowledging October 11, 1990 as National Coming Out Day "in order to further the awareness of the discrimina­tion, harassment, and violence suffered by gay and lesbian persons," read the document. 
Several members of the HPC pointed out that the resolution was too vague and too close to support of gay and lesbian ac­tivities and the council should not support the resolution but present another that represents the feelings of the Hall Presi­dents. 
Others said that the resolu­tion should be supported since it does not actually support gay and lesbian activities, but only the event and the end of the discrimination of gays and les­bians. 
Another member pointed out that the event should not be ad­dressed because it could lead to an increase in discrimination rather than a decrease. 
The group plans to deal with the issue and with the senate resolution at a later meeting. 
In other HPC news: 
• Mike Morland announced that the Student Government Legal Department has devel­oped complaint forms which allow students to mail com­plaints directly to the student government. The complaint forms should be available to students through hall rectors, 
RAs, and hall presidents this week.. 
•Joe 
Cassidy, Director of Stu­dent Activities, announced that the Notre Dame-Miami football game T-shirt will be available to students next week through dorm representatives. The shirt costs $6 for short sleeves and $8 for the long-sleeve version; all the proceeds from the sale of the shirt will benefit Zheng­de Wang, an ND student criti­cally injured in a hit-and-run incident last year.

HPC will once again sponsor the Quarter Mile fund raiser for the United Way, to be held on Friday outside the Notre Dame Bookstore. The event will allow people to tape change to a quarter-mile-long strip of tape.

ND hosts conference about alumni community service 
By MIKE SCARSELLA News Writer 
Executives from twenty college and university alumni associations met from September 30 to October 2 at Notre Dame to discuss ways to increase community service involvement through their organizations. 
Representatives from Prince­ton, Dartmouth, Duke, UCLA, and the Universities of Iowa and Indiana discussed the need for volunteer service as an integral part of alumni activity at the James Andrews Conference on Community Service last weekend. Topics of the discussion included university involvement in com­munity service projects and ways for alumni associations to en­courage public service. 
"We were working from the standpoint of trying to expose unknown concepts of community service to different universities of different sizes and geographic locations," according to Pete Pranica, assistant director of Alumni Clubs. 
Wendy Hopkins, a representa­tive from William's College, agreed, saying, "Size is irrele­vant. A willing administration and a hardworking alumni as­sociation are needed to obtain one to one contact with the alumni."

A video depicting the commu­nity service performed by various Notre Dame clubs was presented at the conference. Examples of service projects accomplished through alumni clubs at the University include the improvements made to low income neighborhoods during "Christmas in April," and the "Fresh Start" program, which offers free reconstructive surgery for people who normally wouldn't be able to afford it. 
The video was used in conjunc­tion with group discussions to provide a basis on which the rep­resentatives could build their own service programs. Pranica and Kate Sullivan, coordinator for the Notre Dame Service Pro­gram, led the discussions. 
University President Father Edward Malloy was among those addressing the conference. John Kobara, executive director of UCLA's alumni association, and Thomas Morris, associate pro­fessor of philosophy at Notre Dame, gave a keynote presenta­tion titled "Why Service? And More Importantly, Why Alumni?" 
In addition to the speeches and discussions, the participants toured impoverished areas of South Bend to examine a variety of opportunities for community service.

As part of the University's Multicultural Festival, Father Wilson Miscamble, professor of history and native Australian, spoke about his homeland with a particular focus on what he called "Australia's original set­tlers, the Aborigines." 
While Australia is most often associated with "Crocodile Dundee, beer drinking, great beaches and weird animals," Father Miscamble's presenta­tion dealt with the past history and present plight of the Abo­riginal people of Australia. 
The history of Australia, as it has been recorded in most textbooks, begins with its dis­covery in 1770 by Captain Cook who claimed the east coast of Australia for George III. But this was merely "the history of the dominant race; written for them, by them," Miscamble 
said. • 
According to Miscamble, only in recent years has an attempt been made to look at the Abo­rigines whose own history spans 30,000 years before when the first members of the group arrived presumably from Asia. 

By 1788, when the first Bri­tish settlement arrived, there were an estimated 300,000 to 600,000 ·Aborigines scattered sparsely throughout the coun­try. 
Existing in small bands of largely extended families, Mis­camble said, each of the indi­vidual groups established its own unique form of art and dance. "Their culture embodied the experience of thousands of years. They knew what worked in Australia." 
According to Miscamble, the strong belief in their land as a living entity is common to all Aborigines. "They put their natural world first and lived in sync with nature." 
Miscamble quoted Pat Dot­son, the first Aborigine to be ordained a Catholic priest who, in describing the natural world, 
stated that, "It is something, and yet it is not a thing. It be­longs to me; I belong to the land. I rest in it; I come from there." 
Ironically, Miscamble said, it was these same beliefs in the land as a provider of physical needs and spiritual substinence that placed the Aborigines at direct odds with the European settlers who believed in master­ing the environment and sought to enclose and own the land. 
After 1788, many if not all the Aborigines were, Miscamble said, "dispirited" from the land. Miscamble explained that the Aborigines lacked the cohesion and force to fight back against the advances of the British. Consequently, as two incompatible cultures came together in conflict, one

was subdued and virtually destroyed. 
Caught in what Miscamble called a vicious circle, the Abo­rigines were "ridiculed by whites; those that did seek to help were unable to reconnect the Aborigines with their past." 
According to Miscamble, of particular significance to the Aborigines and their acquisi­tion of rights and equality were the efforts of Edward Gough Whittam, who later became prime minister in 1972. Whit­lam was "as committed in the area of Aborigine land rights as a white politician could be" at the time. Most importantly, Miscamble said, he attempted to restore to the Aborigines parts of the country that had been taken from them. 
While progress has been made, Miscamble said that there are "no easy answers." He believes that it is important to understand the impact of European colonization because "not to understand this allows us to simply blame the Aborig­ines today for their circum­stances." 
He added to this stating that, "History has a role in stirring consciences" and optimistically believes that the Aborigines have much to offer, as they can "show us something about a deep love for the land." He concluded, "Perhaps from the desert prophets really do come."

Coveleski Stadium scheduled to host Holy Hour with Rosary for Peace October 7th 
Special to The Observer 
The Area Council of Catholic Men. in conjunction with Queen of Peace Ministries, is sponsor­ing a Eucharistic Holy Hour with Hosary for Peace in Coveleski Hegional Stadium on October 7 (the Feast of the Rosary) at 2:00 pm. Mayor .Joseph Kernan will read a proclamation and wel­come all Catholics on behalf of the City of South Bend. 
This event is the 47th annual Eucharistic Holy Hour sponsored by South Bend's Area Council of Catholic Men. In times past, 10,000 Catholics have filled School Field for the Holy Hour. 
The Holy Hour will be preceded by a procession into the stadium. All Catholic lay organizations are encouraged to take part in the procession. (For procession instructions, call 233-2899). 
Non-perishable food items (or a free-will offering) for the poor will be accepted at the stadium entrance. People of all faiths are welcome and encouraged to at­tend. 
Catholics believe that, eight days after Pope Benedict XV's urgent appeal to Our Lady in 1917 "the peace we ask for be obtained for the agitated world," the Blessed Mother appeared at Fatima and requested the faith­ful to pray the rosary and ex­press a greater devotion to the Eucharist.

Former CEO of Girl Scouts talks to ND/SMC students 
By BECKY RITZERT 
News Writer 
Frances Hesselbein, using her experiences as the former CEO of the Girl Scouts of America, offered business students insight into becoming success­ful managers in today's chang­ing world on Tuesday. 
In a lecture titled "Managing in Today's Changing World," Hesselbein stressed the impor­tance of being flexible as well as being goal-oriented as a manager of today. 
"It is necessary to clarify your mission" as a manager, she said. Hesselbein said that managers must ask themselves questions to define what their business is, who their cus­tomers are, and what the cus­tomers consider valuable. 
Hesselbein, speaking in the Hesburgh Auditorium, also em­phasized that it is just as im­portant to establish a mission when managing a not-for­profit organization such as the Girl Scouts. "The job market in the not-for-profit world is los­ing the image of being softer and lower paid," said Hessel­bern. 
She explained that since the non-profit sector is currently growing faster than both the private and public sectors, stu­dents should consider all three sectors when choosing their managing careers. 
According to Hesselbein, change should always be viewed positively. She said that man­agers must "constantly set new standards" despite the fact that it is often difficult to eliminate the "systematic tasks of old." 
A manager must also con­front change by "understanding the rapid demographic change" taking place, Hesselbein said. She suggested that leaders look at this growth in the "multi­ethnic racial community, not as a threat, but as an opportu­nity." 
Hesselbein also addressed 
methods which a manager may 
use when dealing with his or 
her constituents. "Don't push 
from the rear. Lead from the 
front," she instructed. 
The role of a manager is one of a leader, she said, so the du­ties of a manager must be transformed "from managing things to leading people." 
She again stressed the signif­icance of people by saying, "You cannot put people in little boxes on a structure chart. I prefer concentric circles." Hes­selbein said that viewing her organization while managing the Girl Scouts as those "concentric circles" allowed the staffs to be flexible as well as creative. 
Hesselbein briefly addressed the role of ethics in today's world of management. She said that managers need much help in understanding ethics, which should not be separated into categories such as business ethics or personal ethics. 
"It is an issue which is not debatable," she said. 
In addition to her previously mentioned position, Hesselbein also serves as the chairman of the Board of Governors of the Josephson Institute for the Ad­vancement of Ethics; she is the only female member of Presi­dent Bush's Points of Light Ini­tiative Foundation, and is the current president of the Peter 
F. Drucker Foundation for Non-profit Management.

Dartmouth Review chief resigns over Hitler quote 
HANOVER, N.H. (AP)-The president of The Dartmouth Review resigned Tuesday after the conservative off-campus weekly drew fire for quoting Hitler in its masthead on a Jewish holiday. 
"I will not be a part of this newspaper anymore -I am not an anti-Semite," said C. Tyler White, who is also a student at Dartmouth College. The news­paper is not funded by the col­lege. 
Student officials of the news­paper, which has previously been decried as sexist, racist 
· and homophobic, said the quote was put in by an unknown staffer without the authoriza­tion or knowledge of editors. One called it "sabotage." But White said the newspa­per's official response failed to express the staffs regret or to assume responsibility for let­ting the quote be printed. "The editor-in-chief has failed in his job, and now we all 
must wear the albatross of anti-Semitism because he won't take responsibility for the is­sue's contents," White said in a statement. 
He is the third of the weekly's 24 members to resign because of the incident. 
The edition distributed Sat­urday on Yom Kippur, the Jew­ish Day of Atonement and Ju­daism's most solemn day, car­ried a quotation from Adolf Hitler's "Mein Kampf." 
The passage inserted without attribution in The Review's masthead said: 
"Therefore, I believe today that I am acting in the sense of the Almighty Creator: By ward­ing off the Jews, I am fighting for the Lord's work." 
Cheers and congratulations greeted the resignations at the Student Assembly office, where students stacked petitions bearing more than 2.000 signa­tures and planned a protest rally Thursday.

Hijacked plane crashes 1n China, kills 127 
CANTON, China (AP)-A hi­jacked Chinese jetliner cartwheeled into two parked jets at Canton airport Tuesday, setting off a fiery explosion, killing at least 127 people and seriously injuring 46 others, of­ficials said. 
"The plane split the jets into pieces," said a Chinese man who witnessed the crash. "It was a horrible explosion. The whole sky went red and the air­port shook like an earthquake." 
Money, passports, watches 
and clothes were scattered along the tarmac. The crash occurred at 9 a.m., but ambu­lances wailed late into the night. 
Chinese officials, Western diplomats and witnesses pro­vided conflicting accounts of the disaster and the resulting casualties. 
A Western survivor said there was a struggle in the cockpit of the hijacked Boeing 737 as it landed at Baiyun International Airport, causing the plane to careen into an empty Boeing 707 and a Boeing 757 full of passengers bound for Shang­hai. 
Other unconfirmed reports said two hijackers, Chinese men who wanted to force the plane to Hong Kong or Taiwan, ex­ploded a bomb on the jet. 
A CAAC spokesman, Wang Chunfu, said only one Chinese man was responsible for the hijacking. 
Wang told a news conference 127 people died in the crash and 46 people were seriously injured. He said 100 people, in-

eluding the injured, survived. 
Among those killed, he said, were foreigners and Chinese from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. He declined to release further details. 
Premier Li Peng went to the crash site· near China's main southeast city and visited sur­vivors at hospitals. 
The accident was the worst publicly acknowledged air dis­aster in China. Previously, in 1982, a CAAC Trident crashed in the southern city of Guilin, killing 112 people. China rarely disclosed air disasters before the l980s. 
Although it was a domestic flight from Ziamen to Canton, at least two Americans were on the hijacked plane, U.S. Em­bassy spokesman Sheridan Bell said. Erin Lynne Thomas of Oklahoma City, Okla., was hos­pitalized in good condition with a broken limb, he said. She re­ported a second American woman had been sitting next to her, but Bell said the second woman was missing. 
An airport security officer, who only identified himself as Chen, said the pilot tricked the hijackers into believing they were leaving China, but the hi­jackers realized the truth as the jet approached Canton. 
As the hijackers argued with the pilot, Chen said, the plane circled the airport for about 40 minutes. Then it crashed. 
Witnesses said the 737 spun out of control down the tarmac, sideswiping the empty plane before hitting the 757. 
"The plane was snapped in 
h If l'k h 
scene. "All that was left of the 
fuselage was charred metal. It 
looked like a crematorium." 
The conflicting reports on the number of people killed or in­jured could not be reconciled immediately. 
Western diplomats said 104 people, including 10 crew mem­bers, were aboard the hijacked plane. Diplomats said they learned of only nine survivors, including an American woman. 
At least 150 people were aboard the Boeing 757, the air­port security official said. He said he believed "a large num­ber" of people were also killed aboard that flight. 
Tomohide Yamamoto, a busi­nessman from Japan, said he was sitting in the 12th row of the Boeing 757. 
"I think those who were sit­ting behind the 14th row couldn't have escaped from the plane," he told Japanese televi­sion. "Only those who were sit­ting in the front were rescued. After I got out of the plane, no one came out."

wing. 
"I want to express the hope that the administration will not learn the wrong lesson" from the lopsided Senate vote on Souter, Biden said. A more doc­trinaire conservative "could well fall outside the sphere of acceptability," he said. 
Souter becomes the 105th justice of the Supreme Court. filling the seat vacated last summer by the retirement of Justice William Brennan. 
The court's spokeswoman, Toni House, said Chief Justice William Rehnquist would ad­minister the oath of office in private at 9 a.m., and would administer the oath in a public ceremony in the court's ornate courtroom 15 minutes later. 
The first major case in which he will participate will be a sex­bias dispute that will be argued before the justices Wednesday, Oct. 10. At issue is whether em­ployers may exclude all women of child-bearing age -perhaps 20 million -from some haz­ardous jobs.

Bush calls for support for 'last best chance' federal budget plan with televised speech 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Presi­dent Bush asked Americans Tuesday night to support a $500 billion package of tax in­creases and spending cuts that demands sacrifice from all. "Everyone who can should con­tribute something," the presi­dent said. 
Claiming rare unity with lead­ers of the Democratic-con­trolled Congress, Bush said in a tO-minute televised speech from the Oval Office that the package was written in "eight months of blood, sweat and fears -fears of the economic chaos that would follow if we fail to reduce the deficit." 
"It is the best agreement that 
said of the compromise. "This 
deficit reduction agreement is 
tough, and so are the times." 
Bush's address from the Oval 
Office was nationally televised, 
but his message was primarily 
Congress, where an initial vote 
on the plan may be held as 
early as Thursday. 
Although the package gener­ally has support among Democrats, lawmakers from Bush's own party -particu­larly in the House -have balked at its tax provisions. Bush himself had to abandon his "no new taxes" pledge in the face of the growing deficit. 

There must be some way to avoid doingthe same thing
for the next forty years. 
not, a fan of tax increases," Bush said. "But if there have to be tax measures, they should allow the economy to grow, they should not turn us back to higher income tax rates and they should be fair. 
"Everyone who can should contribute something. And no one should have to contribute beyond their fair share." 
Bush pointed out that the agreement had been hammered out by a bipartisan group. "The Democratic and Republican leadership tonight all speak with once voice," he said, and he urged people to tell their congressmen they support the

You'll be getting your degree from a top school. You're about to find a great job. 
The question is: which job? And will it have the potential to interest you for a whole career? 
You've probably heard the story of the job applicant who said he was a shoe salesman with fifteen years expe­rience. "No;· corrected the recruiter interviewing him, "you've had six months experience thirty times."

monument that was a focus of 
celebrations. 
The broad thoroughfares 
around the Brandenburg Gate 
were thronged with tens of 
thousands of people hours be­
fore the historic occasion, and 
vendors sold food, drinks and 
souvenirs. 
Dixieland jazz, street musi­
cians and organ-grinders 
played music that rang in the 
chilly fall air. 
Searchlight beams waved in a 
cloudless sky, and a tall crane 
dangled an old East German 
"Trabi" car 50 feet in the air 
just south of the massive stone 
gate. 
About 200 leftist radicals 
lined a police ·barrier outside 
the Schauspielhaus, blowing 
whistles and jeering at digni­
taries arriving for a-formal 
state ceremony hosted by the 
departing East German gov­
ernment. 
The radicals chanted 
"Germany, drop dead!" 
Kohl, 60, said in a statement 
to the Frankfurter Allgemeine 
newspaper that the new Ger­
many will help stabilize Europe, 
and that it would not be a 
"restless Reich" like Nazi Ger­
many, which plunged Europe 
into its most disastrous war. 
The unification of Germany is 
a "European, indeed a world 
event of historic rank," Kohl 
said. 
Several German newspapers published the approved verse of the national anthem to be sung in unified Germany -not the old "Deutschland Ueber Alles" verse -but the third verse, which starts: "Unity and Justice and Freedom for the German fatherland." 
The verse admonishes Ger­
many to "bloom," not to be 
"above all," the old mission 
that frightens some Europeans. 
Only a year ago the rush to­ward unity was barely starting. East Germans demonstrated for political freedoms and the 
right to leave their country. The Communist government opened the Berlin Wall last fall but was swept away anyway in a peace­ful popular revolution. 
East Germans began to demonstrate for unification, which was taken up by Kohl and his government, and even­tually approved by Moscow and the Allies. 
The Soviets agreed to let' united Germany remain in NATO and to remove their troops by the end of 1994, although Germany is paying Moscow $9.5 billion to finance the withdrawal. The Allies will keep troops in West Berlin until the Soviets leave.

Baker believes sentiment for action against Iraq growing 
NEW YOHK (AP) -Secretary of State James Baker said Tuesday night he found grow­ing sentiment among the na­tions of the world for military action against Iraq to force a withdrawal from Kuwait. 
"There is more of a willing­ness to consider some sort of an approach like that if it be­came necessary at an appro­priate time," Baker said at a news conference. 
"It seems there is a greater willingness to consider some­thing like this than one would have expected a week ago com­ing into these U.N. meetings," he said after a week's consulta­tions in New York with coun­tf~rparts from other nations and other diplomats attending United Nations sessions. 
But he stressed sentiments could change quickly, as in a day. And he emphasized the Bush administration preferred a diplomatic and political solu­

Kuwait and seizure of the Per­sian Gulf emirate's oil fields. 
Baker spoke at the conclusion of a two-day meeting of 35 for­eign ministers to prepare for a European Security Conference summit meeting in Paris Nov. 19-21. 
Asked if the United States had begun to draft a resolution in which the U.N. Security Council would authorize mili­tary force against Iraq, as re­ported Sunday by The Associ­ated Press and Newsweek magazine, Baker replied: 
"There has been no decision taken at the top levels of this government with respect to go­ing forward now with respect to a particular resolution." 
However, Baker said, "it would not be prudent of us not to be giving some thought to what the various options are and how they would be imple­mented." 
U.S. officials told the AP on

lope" drafting had begun by the United States, the Soviet Union and other governments. 
The foreign ministers adopted a resolution condemn­ing Iraq for its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. The statement, pro­posed by the United States, called for an immediate and unconditional withdrawal. 
The 12-nation European Community, meanwhile, ap­proved nearly $2 billion in as­sistance to Egypt, Jordan and Turkey to compensate for eco­nomic hardships arising from the Persian Gulf conflict. 
Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis said the Community would provide $660 million and member nations $1.32 billion.

Supreme Court hears case on school 'resegregation' 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The Supreme Court was urged Tuesday to let Oklahoma City children attend neighborhood schools even though that has brought back racial imbalance. Continued desegregation of public schools in hundreds of other American cities could be at stake as well. 
Lawyers for the Bush admin­istration and the Oklahoma City school board said formerly segregated school districts should be allowed to escap.e court-ordered integration plans once they achieve racial bal­ance. 
But a lawyer for some black parents in Oklahoma City said returning to neighborhood schools in a city where whites and blacks live in different ar­eas had turned back the clock to a time when blacks and whites were required to attend separate schools. 
In an animated, hour-long session, all eight justices asked questions. 
Solicitor General Kenneth Starr. the administration's top courtroom lawyer, acknowl­edged that many of Oklahoma City's neighborhoods are pre­dominantly black or white, but said, "The school board has no realistic control over where people choose to live." 
School board lawyer Ronald Day argued that a federal judge's finding in 1977 that the city's schools were fully inte­grated -or "unitary" -freed the board from continuing forced busing and other court­ordered remedies until all city neighborhoods are integrated. 
Such residential segregation, Day said, "is a phenomenon over which this school board, indeed no school board, has control."

The Observer is the independent newspaper published by the students of the University of Notre Dame du Lac and Saint Mary's College. It does not necessarily reflect the policies of the administration of either institution. The news is reported as accurately and objectively as possible. Unsigned editorials represent the opinion of the majority of the Editor-in-Chief, Managing Editor, News Editor, Viewpoint Editor, Accent Editor, Photo Editor, and Saint Mary's Editor. Commentaries, letters and Inside Column present the views of the authors. Column space is available to all members of the community and the free expression of varying opinions on campus through letters, is encouraged. 
Administration requires gender diversity 

As Saint Mary's editor of The Observer, I feel obligated to address recent letters attacking the president of the College; Dr. William A. Hickey. 
I am very disturbed by two letters written by Devon Marcuson concerning the qualifications of Dr. Hickey to serve as president of a Catholic women's college. In Miss Marcuson's first letter (The Observer, Sept. 13), she claims that "the administration felt threatened by the women's movement and (is) determined to keep the status quo in bal­ance ... " Miss Marcuson must be unaware of how a president is chosen at Saint Mary's. 
The process begins with in­terviews of candidates by stu­dents, faculty members and administrators and the presen­tation of evaluations to the Saint Mary's Board of Regents. These recommendations are taken very seriously. I doubt that these individuals felt a "lack of confidence in women," since fifty percent of the faculty, seventy percent of the administration and one hundred percent of the student body is female. The Board of Regents happens to enjoy a two-thirds female majority. The Board of Regents uses these evaluations to narrow the list of candidates down to three prospective presidents. The three finalists are then presented to and interviewed by the General Council of the Sisters of the Holy Cross. This general council is made up entirely of sisters, who are obviously female. These sisters are charged with making the final selection. 
It is important to note that when Dr. Hickey was selected, the other two finalists were fe­male, and Dr. Hickey still won hands-down. I am quite sure the General Council for the CSC 
DOONESBURY 

takes the responsibility of ap­pointing the Saint Mary's pres­ident quite seriously and ac­tively sought to choose the most competent and qualified applicant. The sisters had the opportunity to appoint one of the females. However, this would have involved choosing a less qualified candidate for the sake of choosing a woman. Although Miss Marcuson refuses to recognize it, such an action would constitute pure sexism. I. for one, would not want a less capable leader who was chosen on the basis of gender. Although the vast majority of the people involved in the selection process were female, a male was chosen based on his accomplishments and qualifications. No existing fe­male candidate had devoted anywhere near the time and commitment to Saint Mary's and higher education Dr. Hickey had. Anyone who examines Dr. Hickey's past record would come to the same conclusion. 
If Miss Marcuson is concerned about women moving on to graduate school or other post­graduate pursuits, perhaps she would be interested in a few of the curriculum changes for which Dr. Hickey was responsible. During his time as Vice President, Dean of Faculty, and President of Saint Mary's, 
By 
Corinne Pavlis 
he introduced new degree programs including ones in accounting, marketing and management. He also re­established the nursing program which had been terminated. He did so to open more opportunities for Saint Mary's graduates. The days of the home economics major ended with Dr. Hickey. These changes have done more to improve the post-graduate image and ac­complishments of Saint Mary's graduates than any other. Although Miss Marcuson seems to make light of it in her Oct. 1 letter, Dr. Hickey is a staunch advocate ofwomen's education 
Dr. Hickey also established the Center for Spirituality which was specifically desig_ned to provide an environment for women and men to research and publish on the evolving role of women in the church. Though Dr. Hickey is not a member of the clergy, he has gone tq great lengths to promote spirituality at Saint Mary's. Miss Marcuson's concern that Dr. Hickey is not a member of the clergy seems inconsistent with her call for a president who can better empathize with Saint Mary's students. I cannot imagine who would be less qualified to empathize with college women than a male member of the clergy. 

Dr. Hickey's other accom­plishment involves Saint Mary's faculty. Miss Marcuson cites studies which call for greater number of female faculty mem­bers. She is obviously unaware that, for the first time, the fac­ulty at Saint Mary's is more female than male. This fact, in addition to the statistics involv­ing the numbers of female members of the administrators, faculty and Board of Regents, implies that there are ample positive female role models on our campus. Miss Marcuson points to studies by Dr. Elizabeth Tidball to affirm the need for a female president to serve as a female authority fig­ure. Miss Marcuson did not follow up her research. If she had, she would have found that Dr. Tidball does emphasize the critical importance of female role models, but does not call for the exclusion of men in administrative hierarchy. Dr. Tidball calls for men and women working together for the betterment of women. She also recognized that creating a "female haven" where only women interact and make deci­

sions is not a true representa­
tion of the real world. 

Yet another problem with Miss Marcuson's arguments in­volves her analogy between Gallaudet University and Saint Mary's. I have never equated being female with being handi­capped. It is precisely such an attitude that leads to the mis­conception that women are inately less capable than men. 
When I started as Saint Mary's editor for the Observer, I sought to meet with authority figures in the administration and faculty. Dr. Hickey has done more to help Saint Mary's gain recognition and improve its image than any other member of the community. He has been more enthusiastic and co­operative than any female member of the community. He has pushed the faculty and administration to take an active role in enhancing the per­ceptions that Saint Mary's women have of themselves, as well as how we are perceived by others. He exhibits a love and concern for Saint Mary's that is truly unique. 
I hope that when it comes time to choose a new president for Saint Mary's, instead of taking Miss Marcuson's faulty arguments into consideration, the community will reflect upon the accomplishments of Dr. Hickey and subsequently at­tempt to find a fitting successor whether it be male or female. I hope that day is very far away. When it does come, our community will realize what it will be losing. Great leaders are never appreciated until they leave us.

Culture abounds at Saint Mary's 
'Dracula' strikes O'Laughlin Auditorium tonight 
CORINNE PAVLIS accent writer 

"Dracula," Bram Stoker's classic tale of horror, will be performed tonight by Ballet Theater Pennsylvania at O'Laughlin Auditorium at Saint Mary's College. Tonight's performance is the first in a series of three dance presentations Saint Mary's will sponsor this year. 
The concept of "Dracula" ranges from the "dawn of man" to contemporary times. Ballet Theater Pennsylvania's version of Stoker's vampire tale is based on the theme, "I have seen the evil and it is our­selves." The character of Dracula will be portrayed by two principal dancers to represent the character's two dimensions. Dracula the Possessed, the darker of the two, represents the evil side of humanity. His counterpart, The Spirit of Dracula, symbolizes a brighter, more promising female facet of the play. 
The production combines classical ballet and modern dance to present a psychological study of good and evil. Each of the twenty scenes is intended to represent a different image of the powerful Dracula. Scenes such as "The Healing" and "The Gates of Hell" set the stage for the climatic final scene, "The Catharsis," in which The Spirit of Dracula rises above the carnage of broken bodies on stage and flies off. Dracula the Possessed is left behind to cover the bodies with his enormous black cape. 
The dramatic performance utilizes the music of Phillip Glass, special flying effects, Broadway set and lighting designs, and a dance company of twelve to present a romantic, frightening, and striking inter­pretation of the legend. 
Preceding "Dracula," the company will present its signature piece, "Bolero," which was recently filmed for PBS. This Spanish character dance fittingly features the music of Ravel. The piece is known for its sensual seductive rhythms which build slowly as new dancers take the stage leading to a scintillating finale. 
Later in the year Saint Mary's will also sponsor "Fresh Tracks," a faculty and guest artist dance concert to be directed by visiting assistant professor Sue Cherry. The performance date is set for November 
16. Next semester features the latest national tour of the Ballet Met Company. 
Individual tickets for ""Dracula," priced at $18 and $16, as well as a package of all three dance programs in the series are on sale at the Saint Mary's box office. The office. located in O'Laughlin Auditorium, is open 
A cast member of the ballet 'Dracula' looks skyward. The 
from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday. Visa 
show will be performed by Ballet Theatre Pennsylvania.

SARA HARKER accent writer 

Jeremy Turner's paintings and Dan Myers' photographs are on exhibition currently at Saint Mary's College in Moreau, Little Theatre and Hammes Galleries through October 12. 
Turner, of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, is having her paintings displayed in Moreau Gallery. 
The body of work is filled with information. The colors glow in a contrast that causes to discover the content of the work. 
The non-traditional perspective includes animal figures intertwining, stylized nude female figures stripped of any beauty, and stylized male figures finding satisfaction in themselves. 
"These paintings are for this particular period in history. They are meant to amuse, arouse, frighten their audience. But primarily to provide insight into the realities of our present society, " explains Turner in her artist's statement. 
She stylizes the female figure giving her neither beauty nor 
ugliness and paints her in a 
red-brown pigment with 
outside forces manipulating and 
changing her. 
In a piece called "Master 
Race," one of these female 
figures lays strapped to a bed 
cringing in pain while Barbie 
and Ken figures surround her, 
attempting to inject into her a 
solution of sperm-presumably 
the solution of utter perfection. 
The painting's bright colors 
attract the eye of the viewer; 
however, upon closer inspection 
of the piece, the coldness of the 
colors and the glazed looks on 
the faces and in the eyes of the 
figures bring out the reality of 
the painting. 
Her other works can be 
viewed in the same way, in that 
in each there is a human truth .as well as violence that comes 
through. 
Dan Myers, a photographer 
who attended Southern Illinois 
University and Cranbrook 
Academy, has his works on 
display in Little Theatre and 
Hammes Galleries. 
He describes his work like 
this: "...The pieces involve 
themselves with the shifting, unstable relationship between inside-outside, between what was real in the past and what was invented." 
The photographs cause the viewer to study the blurry im­ages of memories. All of the photographs are black and white, each with different im­ages, yet each evoke the same response of wonder. 
One in particular, titled "Real Events No. 1-9,"includes a series of nine 4 inch by 6 inch framed images. Upon close in­spection, each of them involves two or more individuals posing for the picture. 
What makes these photographs interesting is that the artist has taken the image and manipulated it so that it is not as visible as it once may have been, iterating the artists thoughts on the mechanical recovery of memory and the reclamation of personal history. 
Both of these exhibits are open during regular gallery hours: Tuesday -Friday 10:00 a.m.-12:00 noon and 1:00 p.m. -4:00p.m., Saturday 10:00 a.m.-12:00 noon, and Sunday

Notre Dame club sports off to good starts this fall 
With the 1990 fall semester in full stride, the sports clubs 
on campus are back in action. Club Corner has returned to help you to keep up with the teams. Several have been practicing since late August, readying themselves for com­petition. 


Rolando

The Sailing Club has been training since August for their de Aguiar seasdn. Led by Watts Hud­gens and Dave Kraemer, the Club Corner 1990 team has already partici pated in races as distant as New Haven, Connecticut. 
At the Harry Anderson Regatta, held at Yale Uni­versity September 1-2, the team faced several East­ern sailing powerhouses, and was relegated to the second division. 
"It was a good experience to see what the real guys in the big leagues are like," Kraemer said. The team made an impressive showing at the De­troit Yacht Club during the weekend of September 
22. Their second-place finish at the Midwestern Collegiate Sailing Association Sloop Championship qualified them for national competition in this event. 
This weekend, the women's team will travel to An­napolis to take part in the Navy Women's Intersec­tional. An Notre Dame sailor will also be competing at the MCSA Singlehanded at Western Michigan. 
"''-3 Rugby Club, with its 1-2 record, will be play­ing the fourth week of its season this Saturday, as it travels to Illinois to play in the Chicago Ball Tour­ney. The team began its topsy turvy season with a crushing 40-4 loss to the Michigan Wolverines on September 15th The Irish were heartbroken the next week by a 16-6 loss at Bowling Green; a game which was closer than the score indicated. However, the serum squad rebounded Saturday, destroying Val­paraiso 30-0. 
Team members are hopeful that the squad will perform well at the Chicago tournament. 
"We're optimistic about it," said Mark 'Fish' Fisher, "Last year, we played [the University of] Chicago, and beat them handily." 
Chicago is considered the best of the teams Notre Dame will face this weekend. But Fish was cautious 
about the team's ability. 
"We have lots of injuries. We're hurting right 
now," he said. 
Notre Dame will undoubtedly have a tough week­
end. Several Midwestern schools, including North­
western, Northern Illinois and VI-Chicago, will also 
send clubs. 
The Rowing Club, training since the first week of September, is also enjoying a successful season. Traveling to Pittsburgh for the Head of the Ohio, the rowing team made strong moves. The women's team picked up a gold medal in the Youth 8-woman shell, and a silver in the Heavyweight 4. 
The men's team was also impressive, winning a silver medal in the Heavyweight 4, a bronze in the Heavyweight 8, and fourth place finishes in the Club 8 and Open 4. In the Open 4, the Irish, despite fin­ishing fourth, still managed to beat the old course record.

Boston loses in 11, blows chance to clinch berth 
BOSTON (AP) -The Boston Hed Sox failed to clinch the American League East title Tuesday night and sent the race down to the final day by losing to the Chicago White Sox 3-2 on Ozzie Guillen's two-out HBI single in the 11th inning. 
The Boston loss, which came about one hour after Toronto won in Baltimore 2-1, left the Hed Sox one game ahead of the Blue Jays with one game left in the regular season. 
Dennis Lamp (3-5), Boston's fourth pitcher, was unable to hold Chicago in the 11th after the Hed Sox failed to score with the bases loaded and two out in the 1Oth against Donn Pall (3­5). Ellis Burks flied out to end the inning after an intentional walk to Wade Boggs. 
With one out in the 11th, Ron Karkovice lined a single to left and took second on Robin Ven­tura's single to center. Scott Fletcher popped out but Guillen pulled a low-outside pitch into right field and Karkovice just beat Kevin Romine's throw to catcher Tony Pena. 
Wayne Edwards, Chicago's fourth pitcher, pitched the 11th for his second save. Romine singled with two out but Pena forced Romine to end the game. 
The Red Sox tied the score 2­2 In the bottom of the eighth just after the scoreboard showed that Toronto beat Bal­timore on Fred McGriff's ninth­inning homer. 
Tom Brunansky led off the inning with a double, just the fourth hit off Chicago starter Melido Perez. Jeff Stone ran for Brunansky and Bobby Thigpen relieved Perez. Pena sacrificed Stone to third and Danny Heep -hitting. 174 -pinch hit for Luis Rivera and hit a sacrifice fly to score Stone. 
The White Sox took a 1-0 
lead In the first inning with the 
help of a balk by Tom Bolton. 
With one out, Lance Johnson 
extended his hitting streak to 13 games with a single and Carlton Fisk walked. The run­ners advanced on Bolton's balk and Frank Thomas hit a sacri­fice fly. 
The Red Sox broke their own major league record for grounding into double plays. They hit into three in the first four innings for a total of 173, two more than the the record they set in 1982 and equaled in 1983. 
Blue Jays 2, Orioles 1 
BALTIMORE -Fred McGriff hit a tie-breaking home run with two out in the ninth inning Tuesday night to give Toronto a 2-1 victory over the Baltimore Orioles and keep the Blue Jays' American League East title hopes alive. 
McGriff's 35th homer on a 2­2 pitch from Baltimore starter Dave Johnson (13-9) easily cleared the right-field wall. 
Toronto had to wait an hour or so to learn its fate until the Chicago White beat Boston 3-2 in 11 innings. The Blue Jays trail the Red Sox by one game with one game left in the regu­lar season. 
Trailing 1-0 after being held to one hit by Bud Black (13-11) over seven innings -Steve Fin­ley's leadoff single in the first -the Orioles tied the game in the eighth. 
Craig Worthington opened with a single and Jeff McKnight singled pinch-runner Rene Gon­zales to third failing to sacri­fice. Brady Anderson then lined a drive to center and Gonzales easily beat Mookie Wilson's throw to the plate. McKnight took second on the play but was stranded when Finley grounded out and Billy Ripken flied out. 
Tom Henke pitched the ninth for his 32nd save as Toronto won for only the third time in its last 11 games. 
Johnson gave up a leadoff single to Wilson in the first in­ning and then retired 12 straight batters before George Bell singled with one out in the fifth. John Olerud singled Bell to third and Pat Borders hit an opposite-field single to right that gave Toronto a 1-0 lead. 
Mets 6, Pirates 4 

PITTSBURGh -The Pitts­burgh Pirates made sure the New York Mets didn't win the National League East this year. On Tuesday night. they made sure Dwight Gooden won't win 20 games, either. 
Sid Bream hit a two-run homer and the Pirates ended Gooden's eight-game winning streak and denied him win No. 20 by beating the Mets 9-4.

Gooden lasted just 4 1-3 in­nings, his shortest outing since he pitched three innings in his second start of the year on April 14. He was working on three days' rest, one less than usual, in an attempt to get his second 20-win season. 
"I have no regrets about this," Gooden said. "I thought maybe I'd look back over the winter or maybe two or three years down the road and say maybe I should have pitched." 
"It's like a hitter wants to hit .300 instead of .299," Mets Manager Bud Harrelson said. 
Gooden (19-7) lost for the first time since Aug. 4 against St. Louis. He had won 16 of 17 decisions after a 3-5 start. Gooden left the game one bat­ter after Bream's homer. He al­lowed nine hits and eight runs, six earned. 
Bream's homer was his 15th, one short of his career-best in 1986, his first full major league season. It followed R.J. Reynolds' single and gave Pitts­burgh an 8-4 lead. 
"Last night was a relaxing time becaused it didn't mean anything," Bream said of a 4-1 loss to the Mets one day after the Pirates clinched the NL East title. "Nobody gave a hoot. We got back in the saddle again tonight." 
Bobby Bonilla drove in two runs to raise his RBI total to 120, one behind NL leader Matt Williams of San Francisco. 
New York's Dave Magadan was 1-for-5 and dropped to .329, six points behind NL bat­ting leader Willie McGee, who had a .335 average for St. 
Louis when he was dealt to Oakland last month. Magadan would have to go 5-for-5 in Wednesday's season finale to pass McGee. 
Reds 3, Astros 2 

CINCINNATI Jack Armstrong pitched two perfect innings in his first start since Aug. 24, and Paul O'Neill sin­gled home a pair of runs as Cincinnati Reds exercised its pitching staff in a victory over Houston. 
Four Reds pitchers retired the first 16 batters in order be­fore Luis Gonzalez1doubled off Rick Mahler with one out in the sixth. The Astros managed four hits, all off Mahler, against six Cincinnati pitchers. Glenn Davis' two-run single in the seventh scored both Houston runs. Randy Myers pitched the ninth for his 31st save.

The victory was No. 91 for the the National League West champions, who open the play­offs Thursday against Pittsburgh at Riverfront Stadium. The 91 wins are the most since 1978, when Cincinnati had 92.

lsiah Thomas faces charges 
DETROIT (AP) -A television reporter filed an assault and battery complaint against Isiah Thomas of the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday, saying the NBA All-Star choked him and threw him against a car. 
Virg Jacques, a reporter with Detroit's WJBK-TV, said he didn't know what provoked the assault outside a gymnasium at Oakland University, where the Pistons had just concluded an informal practice. 
"If you want to know what his reasoning was, you'll have to ask him," said Jacques, who went to the gym to file a report on the two-time NBA champi­ons' practice session. "But if he says I confronted him or pro­voked him in any way, he's ly­ing." 
Jacques, who said he was cut on the neck, filed the complaint with the university's Depart-

Since the football team will be 
playing Stanford Saturday, the 
Cardinal was generous enough 
to send four Olympic sporting 
teams with it: men's and 
women's swimming and men's 
and women's tennis. You'll find 
them all on Friday afternoon. 
There may not be four more dominant sporting programs during this decade. 
The Stanford women's swimming team may be the biggest draw of the weekend, as Olympic gold medalist Janet Evans will be attending. Evans, a world-record holder and three-time NCAA champion, heads a powerful women's team that also includes NCAA Champion Summer Sanders, who was the only person to beat Evans at this summer's Goodwill Games in Seattle. The women's team as a whole fin­ished second to Texas in the 1990 NCAA team champi­onships. 
The Cardinal men's swim­ming team is led by world­record holder and NCAA Back­stroke Champion Jeff Rouse. Other standouts are distance freestyle specialist Alec Kostich, who completed in this sum­mer's Goodwill Games, and sprinter Erik Maurer. The men's team finished third in the 1990 NCAA's. 
"Stanford's programs are as excellent as you can get," said Notre Dame men's and women's coach Tim Welsh. "This is not just national-level swimming, this is life at the top. It's just a thrilling en­tourage. 
"Stanford is also excited by coming. Both Stanford and Notre Dame have excellent academics and sports, so it's like comparing apples and ap­ples. Their apples are just a lit­tle bigger than ours right now, as far as swimming goes." 
Hold your breath, as the Car­dinal tennis teams have enjoyed even more success than the swimming teams. The women's tennis team has won the last five NCAA Championships. The men do not slouch by contrast, having won the last three. Both teams have a number-one pre-• season ranking. 
Th,t women's team boasts four of the top 11 players in the nation, including top-ranked Debbie Graham, an NCAA sin­gles champion. Besides Gra­ham, the Cardinal has senior Sandra Birch (ranked second), senior Teri Whitlinger (seventh) and freshman Laxmi Poruri 
(11th). 
"Stanford rarely plays dual matches outside of California because their facilities are so good," said Notre Dame women's coach Jay Louderback. 

ment of Public Safety, whose officers have arrest powers as Oakland County sheriff's deputies. 
"A complaint has been filed, and we are investigating," Sgt. AI Steele said. He declined to comment further. 
Thomas has an unlisted tele­phone number and could not be reached for comment. But Pis­tons spokesman Matt Dobek on Tuesday night related a version of the incident that differed from that given by Jacques. 
Dobek said he learned from Thomas and center James Ed­wards, who witnessed the con­frontation, that Jacques fol­lowed Thomas out of the gym, and refused to let Thomas into Thomas' car. 
After Thomas gained entry, Jacques stood in front of the car as Thomas tried to drive away, Dobek said. 
"There were no punches thrown," Dobek said. "We don't think it's a big problem." 
Jacques, however, said he had followed Thomas out of the gym and was walking to his own car when Thomas called to 
him. 

"He said, 'Hey, come here, man, I want to talk to you for a minute,"' Jacques said. "He said, 'Forget it' and walked away." 
Thomas then called Jacques over to his car again and "started shouting and put his hands around my neck and shoved me against a car. He was shouting, 'Get out of my face' and 'Get the hell out of my way,"' the reporter said. 
Thomas then got into his car and drove away after shouting, "Get the hell out of my way, I'm going to run you down," Jacques said. 
"It's very exciting for us for Johnathon Stark. Stanford's them to come. The teams we men's team includes three other play the rest of the year will be players in the national top 50. a notch lower than these guys." "It's an excellent honor to to

Phares helps women's golf 
Grace defeats OC in

Irish golfer Kathy Phares has proved to everyone that last year was not a fluke. 
The sophomore has contin­und her winning ways in the 1990 fall season. At the Irish Invitational this September, she was the second highest Notre Damn finisher and at the Lady Wolverine Invite, she tied for 14th place with teammate Cappy Maek. 
At the Illinois State Invite, Phares led the Irish with a 161 for two rounds which placed her eighth in the final individual standings. She also played two nxetltlent rounds at the Spartan Invitational over the weekend, but did not olace well due to a 
UNLV may get the chance to defend title 
LAS VEGAS (API -The NCAA has agreed to reconsider its de­cision banning UNLV from de­fending its national basketball championship, university offi­cials said Tuesday. 
The NCAA's Infractions Committee will meet Oct. 28 in a special session in Chicago to review the ban it imposed in July on postseason play for the UNLV basketball team, univer­sity President Robert Maxson said. 
Maxson said no promises were made to remove the ban, but called the decision to re­consider "a clear signal" the NCAA is willing to modify the sanction. 
"We're very pleased. We think this is a good sign for the uni­versity," Maxson said. 
UNLV officials said they planned to offer the committee a list of different penalties, but did not specify what alternative sanctions they would propose. 
"We'll be trying to formulate ideas for alternative penalties right up until Oct. 28," Univer­sity Counsel Brad Booke said. "We've discussed virtually every idea possible." 
Booke acknowledged that one of the possible proposals would bfl for UNLV to ask coach Jerry Tarkanian to step aside during postseason play. Other contin­gencies include limiting of re­cruiting or the loss of some scholarships for the basketball program. 
UNLV had been set to appeal the postseason ban before the NCAA Council when it meets Monday in Kansas City, but that appeal was postponed pending the reconsideration by the Infractions Committee. 
Hooke said UNLV has not waived its rig!tt to appeal to the NCAA Council if the Infractions Committefl reaffirms the post-the Irish Invitational, her first collegiate tournament, and at the MSU Invitational. At the Franklin Invitational, she earned medalist honors after breaking a seven year tourna­ment record with single round score of 73. 

Leading the team with a 82.4 stroke tournament average last fall, she won team MVP honors with her strong rookie perfor­mance. Hanlon had nothing

Men's interhall football ac­tion has completed its sec­ond weekend. Two early key games which may ultimately decide league championships were contested on Sunday, as Grace defeated Off-Cam­pus Crime 6-0, and Alumni trounced Cavanaugh 22-0. GRACE 6, OFF-CAMPUS 0 
In a game dominated by defense and special teams, Grace came up with the one break needed for the victory. 
Early in the second quar­ter, Steve Homan broke through the middle of the Crime line and blocked Bill Nash's punt attempt. Homan recovered the ball in the end zone to account for all the scoring. 
"We got lucky," said Grace coach Chris Sullivan, "but luck follows the better dis­ciplined and conditioned teams." 
Off-Campus' best scoring opportunity came late in the second quarter. The Crime drove down to the Grace 15, only to be pushed back by penalties and a strong Grace defensive stand. The Crime eventually missed a long field goal try. 
"Penalties on offense and poor fielding on punts . . . [and] poor field position throughout the game killed us," said Off-Campus coach Tom Helms. "Grace's special teams played well, especially their punter (Bob Sweeney) who consistently pinned us back." 
ALUMNI 22, 
CAVANAUGH 0 
The rematch of last year's championship game turned in the Dogs' favor early. Alumni took the opening drive and marched the length of the field, scoring on Dave Ludwig's five-yard run off­tackle. 
Cavanaugh quickly struck back, using a deflected pass completion from Pat McCul­lough to Dave Short to reach the Alumni 15. However, a holding penalty and two in­complete passes stalled the drive. Cavanaugh's only se­rious scoring threat ended on with a missed field goal. 
"The key to the game was . . . when we held them early in the game," said Dog coach Paul Szyperski. "Our defense helped give our offense mo­mentum by giving them great field position. It allowed us not to play conservatively, but instead to open up our offense and pass more. Our defense rose to the chal­lenge." 
Alumni seized control of the game just before half­

season ban. 

The committee imposed the sanction July 21 as a final reso­lution of a legal battle with Tarkanian that stretched to 1977 when Tarkanian won a court injunction prohibiting the NCAA from ordering his sus­pension from coaching for two years. 
Tarkanian did not attend Tuesday's news conference called by Maxson to announce the NCAA decision. 
Booke said, though, that uni­versity officials have discussed a variety of possible sanctions with Tarkanian. 
"There's certain things Coach Tarkanian can do that are probably permissible under his injunction," Booke said. "We've discussed several ideas with

Maxson credited Booke's 
work on an appeal brief filed · with the NCAA as the reason the Infractions Committee de­cided to review its original 
postseason ban. 
Maxson said he expected 
committee members to come up 
with some ideas of their own 
about sanctions, but expressed 
optimism that UNLV would be 
successful in overturning the 
ban on postseason play. 
"I think the clear signal is 
they're willing to look at some 
alternatives," Maxson said. "If 
they weren't, they wouldn't be 
flying to Chicago on a Sunday 
to hear up." 
UNLV announced immediately 
after the July ruling that it 
would appeal the ban. 
Maxson at the time called the 
penalty "a miscarriage of jus­
tice" and said UNLV was being 
penalized twice for the same of­
fense.

time. Mark Ross' eight-y~~d touchdown run and Ludwig s two-point conversion made tbe score 14-0. 
"We just weren't ready to play," stated Cavanaugh coach Ken Cotter. "We weren't fired up, and they were." 
The Dogs finished the scoring on a 40-yard pass from Jim Passinault to tight end John Caretta. The PAT was converted on a Passin­ault-to-Pete Parton comple­tion. 
"This game is behind us," said Cotter, "but if we win our next two, we still make the playoffs, and that's what we're shooting for." 
OTHER GAMES 
Sorin and Fisher tuned for next week's Rockne League showdown in impressive fashion. Sorin shut out St. Edward's 21-0, while Fisher downed Carroll 20-0. 
The Otters, who had a bye last week, opened their 1990 season with a convincing showing. Sorin took control in the second period, as quarterback Kevin Kramer scored two touchdowns to open up a 13-0 lead. Kramer's 15-yard pass to split end Tim O'Shaughnessy in the third quarter sealed the victory. 
"Our defense got us great field position all day," said Kramer, "which made our [the offense's] job real easy. For the first time out, our offense really clicked." 
The Green Wave took the halftime lead over the Ver­min on a one-yard run by quarterback Rick Ebert, set up by a 25-yard, one-handed catch by tight end Dave Hoeffel and a pass interfer­ence call in the end zone. 
Early in the fourth quar­ter, Ebert found Renzy Smith for a 35-yard touchdown pass. A 30-yard completion to Mickey Perez on the last play of the game rounded out the scoring. 
"Compared to last week .. . we got something going through the air. Carroll has some big guys on defense, so I'm surprised how well our passing game worked," said Ebert. 
Shawn Duffy's 25-yard field goal in the first quar­ter, and Dan Marzec's five­yard touchdown run with 
1:30 remaining gave Planner a 10-0 victory over Dillon in the Big Red's 1990 debut. 
"Our team's starting to develop chemistry, and this, along with our talent, bodes well for us this year," said Planner coach Kevin Rice. Keenan's first game in the Leahy League ended in a 0-0 tie with Stanford.

If the Mets don't pay, Strawberry wants LA 
NEW ·YORK (AP) -If the New York Mets want to keep Darryl Strawberry it will take more than big bucks. He wants some help, too. 
In his latest declaration, Strawberry let it be known the bidding for his services is be­tween the Mets and the Los An­geles Dodgers. That, of course, could change in a day or two. 
He also stressed that the Mets front office better come up with a leadoff hitter, prefer­ably fellow free agent Vince Coleman. 
"We've got a couple of guys around here who have to grow up," Strawberry said. ''I'm not going to start naming names, but we've got guys that care too much about their own stats. 
"I don't want to be around a team like that. I mean, us not winning this year is ridiculous. But it has to start with the front office. I've got to have a better relationship with them after all the negatives I heard this year." 
General manager Frank Cashen and senior vice presi­dent Al Harazin traveled with the club to Pittsburgh with the intent of letting Strawberry know the Mets want him. Strawberry missed the final week of the season with a bad back and was on the bench Sunday when New York was eliminated. 
"Obviously we do want to sign Strawberry," Harazin said. "We will make a major ef­fort to do that. Whether it's enough to get the job done time will tell." 
"He's said a number of dif­ferent things at different times. 

We hope he elects to stay. We think it would be in our best in­terest and his to stay." 
Strawberry's relationship with Cashen has deteriorated since the GM said the right fielder wasn't a $5 million player. But Harazin said team owners Nelson Doubleday and Fred Wilpon will not intervene in the negotiations. 
''I'm quite sure I'm going to listen to what the Mets have to say," Strawberry said Monday night in Pittsburgh. "That'll be my first priority. 
"But if I do get the offer from the Dodgers, that's where I'll be. I'm not going to lie -if they give me a five-year deal at today's rate, that's where I'll be." 
The Mets offered Strawberry slightly more than $9 million for three years in July and he rejected it. He wants a five-year deal for $20 million to 25 mil­lion. 
New York halted contract talks in mid July and Straw­berry, a Los Angeles native, went on to have his best season with 37 homers and 108 RBis. 
"They have quality hitters al­ready -Kal Daniels, Hubie Brooks, Eddie Murray," Straw­berry said of the Dodgers. "If I'm in the middle of that lineup, that'd be great-that's what I want. Instead of being the only guy, I want to see what I can do with those kind of hitters around me." 
Strawberry said he has ruled out San Diego -for now ­and any team that plays on an artificial surface. 
"The Dodgers know how to win," Strawberry said. "They've got heart and pride."

"She's very intense," says Louderback. "Her ground­strokes are strong and she hits the ball very hard. She works very hard at everything, at ten­nis and in the classroom. She likes to excel." 
Her play so far at Notre Dame should come as no sur­prise to those who have fol­lowed her career. The self-de­scribed "aggressive baseliner" won four Florida state champi­onships as a student at St. Stephen's Lutheran High School, and attended the pres­tigious Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy in Bradenton, Fla. 
With a background like that, it's no wonder that playing top­notch teams like Stanford doesn't faze Vitale. 
"''ve had a lot of experience. It's not Hke I'm just thrown into big matches now," she says. 
A tennis resume like Vitale's attracts college recruiters like a fire attracts firefighters, but the decision to attend Notre Dame was a fairly easy· one for her. 
"I loved the school," Vitale says. "I had a great recruiting trip. I came last year for the Michigan State game. I really like the girls on the team. Ev­eryone gets along really well and I really like the coach." 
With tennis helping her estab­lish a name for herself at Notre Dame, Terri Vitale doesn't have to worry about living in her famous dad's shadow, although questions about her father per­sist. 
"A lot more people have said things to me here than at home in Florida," Vitale says. "My friends [at home] didn't men­tion it as much as here on a

Baseball 
continued from page 24 
a big challenge for Murphy and his coaching staff of Mike Gib­bons, John Flanagan, Mike Moshier and Greg Hudson is in­stilling in this team a blue col­lar work ethic. In 1989 that was a lot easier because there weren't many scholarship or nationally rated players-just a bunch of ballplayers that over­achieved. Now the Irish are get­ting some of the blue-chip prospects that Murphy wanted when he came here. 
"This Is the most talented team we've had since I've been here," Murphy said. "Some of the sophomores had great years last year. We just had a meeting about the sophomore jinx. That comes from laziness and lack of preparation. They're going to have good years because they prepared and worked hard." 
The pitching staff, with a nu­cleus of four sophomores, is the strongest and a key aspect of the Irish squad. 
"They're still maturing," said Murphy. "They don't have the innings yet to be accomplished pitchers like [Brian] Piotrow­icz." 
Dave Sinnes (9-2), who led the nation in E.R.A with a 1.05, anchors the staff. Although he was nothing short of outstand­ing statistically , Murphy ac­knowledges there's more to the game than stats. 
"Sinnes has so far to go," he said. "He has to mature men­tally and appreciate what it is to be a consistent phcher. He can be as good as their is in the nation." 
Pat Leahy, 8-1 last year, will need to be more consistent. Chris Michalak and Alan Wala­nia, who have had had great fall practices, will also continue to play major roles. 
"Everyone talks about Sinnes and Leahy, but Walania can be as good as anyone on the staff," said Murphy. "The same goes for Michalak." 
Senior Tony Livorsi returns to provide leadership for the young pitchers. 
"Livorsi can get people out at any level," explained Murphy. "He could take his 72 mile per hour fastball to the minors and be successful because he knows how to pitch." 
Matt Krall, Cory Mee (a con­verted second baseman) and Dave Yawman will battle to fill graduated Ed Lund's spot at catcher. 
"Krall has the experience edge, he just needs confidence." Murphy said. "Cory Mee can do anything. He's the unsung hero of our program." 
Frank Jacobs, a 15th round pick of the Astros in last sum­mer's draft, has given up foot­ball to concentrate on baseball. 
"It's remarkable to have him out here," said Murphy. "That was a tough decision that not a lot of us could have made. But he realizes his future is in baseball." 
Rightfielder Eric Danapilis, a second team freshman All­American, returns as the lead­ing hitter, boasting a .429 av­erage. He led the team with 60 hits despite missing 18 games due to a back injury.

Swimming laps at 6:15a.m. is not for everybody. 
But for Brian Rini, tri-captain 

of the Notre Dame men's swim team, it is a way of life. Although he doesn't exactly en­joy it, Rini doesn't seem to mind his early-morning ritual too much. 
"I'm used to it," says Rini, a senior from Chagrin Falls, Ohio. "If you do it a lot, it doesn't really bother you." 
The practice has paid ofT for

back wins in last week's Tom Fallon Invitational that were a level above what he had previ­ously done as a college player. 
"I think those matches were a signal that he can become a na­tional level player if he focuses on his game," Bayliss said. "Sometimes last year he lacked perspective on things like when to come to the net, when to stay back and when to crush the ball. but he did a solid job." 
While personal honors are not on his mind at the moment, Coleman is concerned with team performance. 
"My goal is to do everything I ean for us to make it as a team into the NCAA tournament. We have a very competitive sched-Rini. Last season he was the most valuable player on a team which finished 12-1. He also holds Notre Dame records in the 500-and 1000-yard freestyle. As the Irish men pre­pare to host national power Stanford on Friday, Oct. 5 at the Rolfs Aquatic Center, it is clear that Rini will be counted on to lead his squad. 
"Brian leads mostly by exam­ple," says swimming coach Tim Welsh. "He also leads vocally and verbally. He is not only a high point scorer. He is also a practice leader, and attendance leader, and even a social leader for our team." 
Welsh has high expectations for Rini, who will probably swim the 500-and 1000­freestyle as well as the 200 fly this weekend. Even though Rini was last year's team MVP, the 
ule and every match comes down to the wire, so hopefully things will go our way," said Coleman. "It would definitely make the season worthwhile if we make it to the tournament." 
Although the relentless schedule makes for hard prac­tices, Coleman doesn't mind. 
"The schedule makes our program attractive to recruits, so we have to prove that we can beat the great teams. It doesn't do us any good to play an easy schedule," said Coleman. 
While the Irish have not in­stalled any major overhalls in preparation for Stanford, Coleman and doubles partner DiLucia, ranked 14th nationally in the preseason doubles poll, will have to put on a second to none performance in order to beat the top ranked Stanford doubles team of Jared Palmer and Jonathan Stark. 

BRIAN RINI 

Irish coach is convinced that Rini can improve himself even more. 
Rini's training habits may be his greatest asset. According to Welsh, Rini has a knack for peaking when the day of a meet rolls around. 
"He is a good technician," Welsh says of Rini. "He is very good on turns, and he always 
"We just feel lucky to be able to play them," said Coleman. "We'll have to stay on an even keel mentally in order to play our type of game." 
Coleman remembers well the welcome he received as a freshman, and hopes to make the transition into college easier for this year' group. 
"The  freshmen  have  come  
along  so  much in only  a  few  
weeks,"  said Coleman.  "They  

have great attitudes and have been doing a really good job for us." 
With an upperclassman like Coleman willing to take it upon himself to move the team into a national contender, it's no wonder Bayliss sees such a bright future for his troops. 
"We need someone to be able to stand alongside DiLucia and I think Chuck has shown signs of the one who's going to do it." 
trains hard. He is in good shape, and he prepares well. He has good race design and is a very smart racer." 
Since there are only 13 let­termen returning from last year's squad, many freshmen are going to be expected to fill the gaps left by graduation. With such a young team, one might expect that Rini might be inclined to bear too much of a burden, but this is not the case. 
"The freshman class is out­standing," Rini explains. "Every year the freshmen get better and better here because the program is expanding and im­proving. I really don't feel any pressure at all. I'm glad to be a senior and glad to be one of the captains, but I don't feel any added pressure." 
It seems that neither Rini, nor any of the other players feel any added pressure with Stan­ford, which finished third in last year's NCAA champi­onships last year, coming in this weekend. Instead, they are rather looking forward to it as an event. 
"The meet is more of a week­end fare," says Rini. "We are looking to be good hosts and show that we are proud to swim for Notre Dame. It will be a great chance to meet people who are Olympic-caliber swim­mers. We will also be hosting them-they'll be staying in our rooms, and that should be fun. Most swimmers get along with each other pretty well because they are the same type of peo­ple." 
If they are anything like Rini, they don't mind swimming at 
6:15 a.m. As long as it means that they will improve, they will get used to it.

Lyght practices, says he can play a 
By f:RANK PASTOR 
Associate Sports Editor 
When the subject of Notre Dame's defense is brought up, it inevitably comes out in two parts. 
There is the front seven, which regrouped in the past two weeks, limiting Purdue and Michigan State to a combined 141 yards rushing, to atone for the 253 yards it allowed Michigan in the season opener. 
Then there is the secondary. 
"The secondary is our biggest area of concern at the present time," said Head Coach Lou Holtz, whose team meets Stanford Saturday at 12:08 
p.m. EST in Notre Dame Stadium. 
While the rest of the team breathed a sigh of relief following Saturday's 37-11 Irish victory over Purdue, the secondary came under fire for surrendering 354 yards through the air to Boilermaker quarterback Eric Hunter. 
Inexperience has been the biggest obstacle for the defensive backfield. Strong safety Greg Davis leads all starters with three career 
Brett sits out 
game to 
defend title 
CLEVELAND (AP) -George Brett held himself out of the Kansas City Royals' starting lineup Tuesday night, reasoning that Oakland's Rickey Hender­son should be forced to over­take him in the race for the American League batting title. 
"I want to see what he does tonight," Brett said. "From the people I talked to, the consen­sus was, make him come to you." 
Brett is hitting .328. Hender­son entered Tuesday night's game at Oakland against Cali­fornia batting .326. Rafael Palmeiro of Texas, which was at Milwaukee, was hitting .321. 
Brett is trying to become the first player to win a batting ti­tle in three decades. He first won it in 1976 at .333, then flirted with .400 for much of the 1980 season before finish­ing with a major league-best .390. 
He had a .200 average in early May this season, but he has hit .390 during the second half. 
"He was overanxious early in the year, and he found a little mechanical flaw in his swing," Manager John Wathan said. ''I'm certainly not a man who can help George Brett with his stroke, but he was pulling too many pitches and hitting a lot of grounders to second. He wasn't using the whole field. That wasn't George Brett." 
Wathan had no reservations about keeping Brett on the bench for Tuesday's game against the Cleveland Indians, even though he said Brett is 7­for-19 lifetime against starter Tom Candiotti. 
"You can throw all those stats out now, in this situa­tion," Wathan said. "Just be­cause you've hit well against somebody in the past, there's no guarantee you're going to continue to do it. Rickey's got to catch George. It's a chess match. They've held Rickey out

starts, cornerbacks Reggie Brooks and Greg Lane have two apiece, and free safety Tom Carter started his first game Saturday against Purdue. The four combine for eight career starts between them. 
That total should increase by 28 this week if Todd Lyght returns to the starting lineup as expected. The All-American field cornerback practiced on Monday and Tuesday after missing the last two games with a pulled hamstring. 
"Todd Lyght has been able to practice," said Holtz. "Hopefully, he'll be able to play against Stanford. Todd says he feels better than he has in a long time, but it [the injury] still concerns me. 
"If Todd Lyght can play, and I won't say he will, he will start at one corner and Reggie Brooks will start at the other." 
Brooks replaced Rod Smith at short cornerback in the Michigan opener and started the next two games. He made a game-saving interception against the Wolverines, but it was just last spring that he lined up on the other side of the football.

"We knew we had a problem in the defensive secondary going into the spring," said Holtz. "Reggie Brooks is a very talented person who we felt might be able to play in the defensive secondary. He's still young, he's still learning, and I don't know if he feels real comfortable over there yet. 
"But he is a very smart person, he is a good hitter, he likes the game, and he has excellent speed. His height (5­
10) is not what you like in a defensive back, but his feet do touch the ground." 
Holtz further sacrificed height for speed last week when he moved freshman Clint Johnson from quarterback to cornerback in an effort to add more depth to the Irish secondary. 
"Last year, we had a veteran defensive secondary," said Holtz. "This year, we don't match up quite as well. We don't have the options we did last year when they (opponents) pass the football. Our secondary will get a big test this week."

Notre Dame welcomes 'Weekend of Champions' 
Men's tennis will face best in nation

When the Notre Dame men's tennis team plays host to three time NCAA defending team champion Stanford Cardinal Friday at the Eck Tennis Pavil­ion, look for Irish sophomore Chuck Coleman to continue his dominance that has led head coach Bob Bayliss to think that he may have another All-Ameri­can on his hands. 
But don't be surprised to hear such talk from Bayliss; he's one the main reasons why Coleman decided to play for the Irish instead of Alabama, the other school that he considered attending. 
"Coach Bayliss is a big reason why a lot of guys come here,"

Coleman complimented. "He puts academics first and he re­ally knows his tennis. He's helped me tremendously in ev­ery aspect of my game." 
By giving some attention to technical aspects of his game, Coleman has made a marked improvement in only a few matches on the young season. 
"He's improved a lot on his volleys and slice backhands, as well as his serve," said Bayliss. 
By improving in these areas, Coleman put together back-to­

season. This is the first many big tests for the Irish in the 1990­
91. The Irish finished 46-12 last year but did not receive a bid to the NCAA Tournament. 
"That (not getting a bid) was a tremendous blow," said head coach Pat Murphy. "The experi­ence would have been wonderful for a program on the rise like us." 
The fact that the Irish were snubbed by the NCAA selection committee at the end of last year despite the fourth best winning percentage in Division I (.793) has necessitated a big change in the schedule for this season. The Irish will play '87 and '88 national champion Stanford, '89 runner-up Texas and traditional College World

Once she got on the court, though, Vitale had little trouble adjusting to college life. She will go into this weekend's match with top-ranked Stan­ford occupying a spot in the middle of the singles ladder (either No. 3 or No. 4) and playing No. 2 doubles. Coach Jay Louderback is clearly im­pressed with her play, and her attitude, so far. ­

Most sports will play in packed weekend 
Take a look at the Notre Dame sporting schedule this weekend. 
Now look again. 

You probably don't need to be told to do this, since the calibre of oppo­nents Notre Dame will be playing is blatantly eye-catching. But if you're not up on your Olympic sports knowl­edge, let this be your guide. 
This weekend, tagged the "Weekend of Champions," began in concept two 


years ago as a baseball series against Miami while the Hurricane football  Scott  Brutocao  
team was in town. They named it "The  Irish Items  
Battle Before the War."  

Now it's the Weekend of Champions, and no one can dis­pute the appropriateness of the title. But there is one ques­tion. 
Where's Wheaties? 
"You know, we should have (talked to Wheaties), but we didn't," said Notre Dame sports marketer Bill Scholl. "It's a perfect tie-in for them, because we're also having a break­fast Friday morning to honor the athletes, including the other teams. It would have been a perfect spot for Wheaties to be involved. Talk about a breakfast of champions." 
Instead, the South Bend Tribune and Maxwell House are the sponsors. Because of the Tribune, advertising through­out the city has been prolific. 
Translation: Go early. You're not going to want to miss these events. 
The Weekend commences with baseball games Thursday and Friday night against 1989 national champion Wichita State at Coveleski Stadium, in downtown South Bend. The Shockers, 45-19 last year, tied Southern Illinois for the 1990 Missouri Valley Conference title and reached the NCAA tour­nament. 
"It's exciting to bring in a team of Wichita State's calibre," said Irish head coach Pat Murphy, whose own team was 46­12 last year. "They're clearly year-in and year-out one of the top programs in the country. We're lucky to have them come here." 
On Friday, there will be (count 'em) seven different sport­ing events on the Notre Dame campus.
