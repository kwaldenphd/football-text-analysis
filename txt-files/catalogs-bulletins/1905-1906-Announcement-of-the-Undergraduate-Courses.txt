ANNOUNCEMENT
'	OF- THE	. •
UNDERGRADUATE COURSES
-	,	IN THE
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME
NOTRE DAME, INDIANA ’	'
To be given during the year 1905-6
, The recent establishment of a four years’ Course in	;
Architecture at Notre Dame University, following the	T
opening of the School of Pharmacy, and the revision and . J
expansion of the entire system of studies several years	;
ago, offer an opportunity of acquainting the alumni and	!
friends of the institution, as well as the Catholic public	;
generally, with what has been and is being done at	.	;
Notre Dame towards meeting the increasing demands of	•
the age upon the college, and keeping pace with the	J
progress of American institutions of higher education !	:
generally. The brief account of the collegiate system at .	i
Notre Dame which follows is supplemented by an exhibit,	J
in tabular form, of the principal undergraduate curricula,	j
as offered for the coming scholastic year 1905-6.	J
' THE ELECTIVE SYSTEM AT NOTRE DAME.	. J
The entire system of studies at Notre Dame is based	i
upon the principle of election of studies. The student,	;
once he is admitted as a Freshman, is free to select his
own course of studies, conformably to his natural liking,	:
the career in life he may have in view, or the determin-
ate intellectual bent developed during the secondary
school years. The curriculum which is made up of the
traditional “ Classics ” holds, of course, the place of honor;.
but it is frankly recognized that there are other studies
which, while scarcely less efficient for cultural purposes '
than the “Classics,” lie closer to the predominant
activities and utilities of modern life. Hence, side by side
, with the “ Classics/} leading to the traditional A. B.
degree, there are other cultural curricula, open to the
. student’s choice and leading to equivalent degrees.
■ This has been the main principle of the collegiate
system at Notre Dame almost from the very beginning.
More than forty years ago, the principle of election of
studies was accepted as the guiding rule in shaping the
academic growth of the institution. This is shown by the
fact that at that early date a curriculum of General
Science studies was’ set up alongside the “Classics” as of
equivalent value for the work of college education.
Since that time, one curriculum after another has been
added, as the college has grown and the demand for a
wider range of election has made itself felt from the
student body, until to-day, it may be confidently asserted,
no other Catholic college or university in the country
offers so rich and varied a field of choice to the under-
graduate student.
THE STUDENT ASSISTED IN SELECTING HIS STUDIES*
. While the student is free to elect the course of studies
he is to follow, he has not, however, unlimited freedom in
this respect. The principle of election is necessarily
conditioned, in its practical operation, by the canons of
sound educational experience. “It is a fact of general ’
experience,” says President Wilson, of Princeton, “that
, the undergraduate student is not likely to make a
■	2	’	’	■	' .	■	' ■
systematic choice of studies unless aided by more mature
judgments than his own, and upon the assumption that
the knowledge of men more mature than himself is a safer
guide to a consistent and serviceable choice than his own
untested tastes and preferences?’ The elective system at
Notre Dame is a system of “assisted election.” There is
a set programme of studies which, while affording ample
range of choice, is sufficiently fixed to ■ shield the student
from the inconsiderate impulses of his own unripened
judgment.	>
THE GROUP SYSTEM.
The programme of studies at Notre Dame comprises a
number of parallel groups of studies leading to equivalent
baccalaureate degrees. Broadly speaking, the groups
divide themselves naturally into two general classes: the
cultural, or those which aim simply at wide-ranging
mental power and development; and the technical, or ‘
those which make a high degree of practical as well as .
theoretical skill, along the line of some strictly scientific
profession, an essential aim. To the first class—the
“cultural”—belong five, groups of studies; the Classics,
English, History and Economics, General Science, and
Biology. To the second class — the “ technical ” — ,
'belong five groups of studies also; Pharmacy, Civil
■ Engineering, Mechanical EngineeringfElectrical Engineer-
ing, and Architecture, with, in addition, a t short two-
year,' technical course in Applied Electricity and in
Mechanical Engineering. .
,To get a clearer view of the principle at work, let us
now take the first of these two general divisions, and
consider the five groups which we have called the
, “cultural” a little more closely. Each group, as a rule,
is made up of three kinds of studies; studies common to
all the groups, studies proper to each group, and studies
that are elective. Thus, in the five groups we are
:	.	•.	7.	'	: • 3	. . ' . ■■	'	■ .	.
considering, 'there are three studies which are common
to all the groups, ■—Christian Doctrine, Philosophy, and
English. In other words, these three subjects are
regarded as indispensably necessary in the work of liberal
education at Notre Dame, and they are the only subjects
which are so regarded.	:
Besides these three common subjects, there are studies
proper to the several groups. Each group has some
studies which are peculiar to itself, and are deter-
mined by the special quality of mental power it is aime'd
to develop. In the Classical Group, for instance, the
studies proper are, Latin, Greek, and History. In the
General Science Group, the studies proper are the natural
and physical sciences, with mathematics. In the English
Group, they are higher English, French, and German.
Again, there is more or less opportunity of election
allowed within a Group. Thus, in the Classical Group,
one elective, of five hours a week, is allowed in each year of
the course, except the Senior year. In the General Science
Group, the work of the Junior year is largely elective, and
the work of the Senior year almost entirely so. The
student may, at any time, with the permission of the
faculty, substitute one study for another in a Group.
By these means, it is believed, .there is provided for in
the programme of studies sufficient flexibility to meet the
most varied demands in the way of cultural training that
may be legitimately made upon the college, and, at the
same time, to' meet and give due recognition to the work
of the secondary schools in preparing pupils for college. .
ADMISSION OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES.
■ It is one of the great advantages of the elective sys-
tern that it enables the college to effect a connection
between its programme of studies and that of any good
high school or secondary school, however much the school -
.	■	4
may be influenced, in the making up of its curriculum, by
local or particular academic needs, requirements, or ideals.
It brings the secondary school close to the college, and
makes if easy for the boy to pass from the one to the
■ other, as easy, almost, as if the school were an integral
part of the college. The college, in effect, places all good
secondary schools on the same plane as its own preparatory
school, and is thus enabled to draw from them all without
any academic difficulty.
tfThe graduates of any public or private high school of
good standing, therefore, will not find it difficult to gain
admission to the University of Notre Dame. They will re-
ceive full credit for any work done in the school. In some
cases, certificates of graduation will be accepted in lieu of
the University’s Entrance Examination. Graduate stu-
dents of high schools that are fully accredited to the
■ -State Universities, will be admitted without examination
to the Freshman year of any Group of studies along the
line of their high school course/The wide range of election
-allowed at Notre Dame makes it easy for the graduate
■ of a good high school, whatever the studies he may have
followed, to qualify for Freshman standing in some one of
■ the many Groups of studies open to his choice.
'	'	ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS* .
■ The entrance requirements vary somewhat according
to the character of the curriculum that the student is to
follow. Thus, Greek is required from classical students
•only. Students who arq to take the course in English, or
the course in History and Economics, may offer in place of
Greek a corresponding amount of French and German.1 For
admission to the Engineering courses, more mathematics
is required than for admission to the other curricula.
. In general, it may be said that the entrance require-
ments of Notre Dame do not differ substantially from those
of other large colleges and universities in the United States.
These requirements are fairly enough represented by the
Regents’ Examinations in New York, or the examinations
which have been given for several years by the College
Entrance Examination Board, the certificates of either of
which will be accepted as the equivalent of the Entrance ,
requirements of the'University.
TABULAR DESCRIPTION OF CURRICULA. ,	.
In the following pages, the Groups of Studies which
have been described above, are exhibited in tabular form, ,
in such a way as to show the degree to which each one
leads, the studies of each year and term, and the number .
of class-hours devoted, a week, to each subject. The	j
character and relative advancement of the courses given	J
in the respective terms is also indicated by the Roman	s
numerals prefixed to these courses in the University .
catalogue; and alongside of the Roman numerals, in the ,
tabular statement, there is given the catalogue page on ,
which a full and- detailed description of the course may	\
be had. With the help of this tabular statement, there-	:
fore, it will be very easy, should further information be
desired, to follow the description of courses in the ,	■
