St. Edward's Hall,
HISTORICAL,
In building the University of Notre Dame, the
founders sought to make it a home from which the benefits
of Christian education might be spread to the youth of the
land. Realizing, however, that, to enter the university
proper, a certain standard of excellence must first be
reached, it was decided that such a degree of excellence
as was required, could be attained better here, if a prepara-
tory school were maintained in connection with the univer-
sity, than it could be if the boys were forced to acquire it
in the public school. From the very opening of the
university’s doors therefore, they have been free for students
desiring preparatory education as well as for those that
desire to pursue more advanced studies. In fact the
first pupil was a Minim. This unique distinction belonged
to the late Alexis Coquillard, of South Bend.
From this combined preparatory and academic school
grew the separate schools, and eventually St. Bd ward’s
Hall was erected as the junior part of the preparatory
department. The first move toward making this branch
of the school a separate department in itself, was made in
1854, twelve years after the founding of the institution.
During the first years of its existence the Minim department
was in charge of lay teachers, principally women, of whom
Miss McCambray was the first. She was succeeded by Miss
Birch, a lady from Kentucky. Next came Miss

Blake, and after her Mrs. Stace, mother of Professor
A. W. Stace, who was so prominent in the early history
of Notre Dame. After Mrs. Stace left, the care of the
younger boys was entrusted to Miss Moss and Mrs.
Williams who watched over the department until 1863.
At that time Father Sorin, decided that it would be more
advantageous to have the Minims in charge of Sisters than
to have them governed by lay teachers. Hence Mother M.
Angela, the famous foundress of the Order of the Sisters
of the Holy Cross in America, was entrusted with the
organization of the Minim department as we have it
today. She nominated different sisters to preside over the
work of the department until Sister M. Aloysius, the
present superioress was appointed to that position in 1874.
At that time the little fellows were still domiciled
in a part of the ground floor of the present infirmary
building, as it existed before the fire of ’79. Under
her guidance however, such progress was made that
it was found necessary to erect a separate building
for the boys under her charge and to enlarge the
campus in orderto make room for them. This led to
the erection of the present spacious building known as
St. Edward’s Hall, which received its name from the
founder of Notre Dame, Father Edward Sorin. After
moving into the new building in 1882 so great was the
advancement made by the department and so many were
the new pupils added to its register that it was found
necessary to augment very materially its staff of teachers.
At the present time the Hall has more than a hundred
pupils with a staff of thirteen Sisters as teachers. More-
over, this regular staff of teachers is assisted by seven of
the university professors in such branches as music, com-
position, languagest drawing- and painting^ elocution and

physical culture. In addition to this there are three
brothers of the Holy Cross who look after the Minims
during their recreation hours and watch over them in the
dormitories.
It is a matter of pride to those that are in charge of
St. Edward’s Hall, and perhaps it should be mentioned in
closing its history, that during the life of Very Rev. Father
Sorin, this was the department in which he took particular
pride. Nothing pleased him so much as to be present
occasionally at some of the Minim recitations or to be out
among the boys while they were at play. So great was
his attachment for them that the pupils of St. Edward’s
Hall, in order to show their appreciation of his attention to
them, organized a military company which was known as
the “Sorin” cadets, and still exists under that name.
This brief historical outline will give one a notion of the
origin and the development of the separate department at
Notre Dame, designed for the training and schooling of
small boys. It must not be thought, however, that because
St. Edward’s Hall is separate by itself, it is an independent
institution, apart from the rest of Notre Dame, for such is
not the case. Its separation from the university proper is
only in so far as the care and special provisions for the
young boys may require: so far as the general administration
is concerned it is a part of the institution and is under the
control of the President and the Board of Trustees of the
university itself.

DESCRIPTION.
St. Edward’s Hall is located in the north-eastern corner
of the university group of buildings, a little to the north
of the Academy of Music and east of the Main Building.
It is a large, four story, brick building, one-hundred-and-fifty
feet long and sixty-five feet wide. As shown in the cu*
presented in the opening pages of this catalogue, the exter-
ior of the building is plain and is approached by two main
entrances. Interiorly the building is well laid out to suit
the convenience of the purpose for which it was erected, and
is artistically decorated throughout the corridors,’ the parlors,
the chapel and many of the class rooms.
On the lowest floor of the building are located the
lavatories, toilet rooms, one or two of the clothes rooms,
bath rooms, etc. The second floor is divided into the
St. Edward’s chapel, parlor, reception room, class rooms,
study and society hall. A large corridor leads through the
center from east to west and two others cross this at right
angles. On the walls of these corridors are some frescoes
by the famous artist, Signor Gregori, numerous group
pictures taken of Minims of other years, and the names of
pupils who were in the hall at the celebration of the Golden
Jubilee of Notre Dame or who were leaders among their
companions. On the third floor of the building are more
class and recitation rooms, the music hall and the principal
st. Edward’s hale.
dormitories. On the fourth flat are the remaining dor-
mitories.
The various rooms in St. Edward’s Hall are all large,
well lighted and well ventilated. The building is heated
throughout by steam and is lighted by electricity so that
there is absolutely no danger of fire. The equipment is,
in every respect, as thorough and as up to date as careful-
ness and a judicious expenditure of money can make it.
One of the things that most readily appears to the eye
of an observer is the order and scrupulous cleanliness that
is to be noticed on all sides. Even in the play rooms
where it might be expected that such young boys might
leave things in a careless condition, everything is as neat
and orderly as one would find it in a well conducted home.
On the eastern end of the building is an annex more
than two hundred feet long, which is divided into a library,
game rooms, play hall, gymnasium, athletic club rooms,
clothes rooms, etc. This annex does not show in the cut of
the hall which appears in the first pages, but later on we shall
give a close description of its various apartments and
present some views of their interior. These will go to
show that the facilities offered to the young boys for
spending recreation hours in a manner most suitable to
their age and tastes are as complete as could well be expec-
ted. At the same time we will give descriptions of the
campus and the various places where the Minims conduct
their outdoor games.
* An important thing in connection with the description
of St. Edward’s Hall is to make mention of the park in
front of the building. This park, named for the hall before
which it stands, is considered the most beautiful part of the
university grounds, which have attracted attention as the
finest college grounds in the west. We give a view of only
a small corner of St. Edward’s Park, as it has been impos-

sible for us to get a photograph of the whole grounds. The
Hall, with its annex, has a frontage on this park of four
hundred and three feet.

THE ADVANTAGES OF ST. EDWARD’S HALL.
The advantages of having a separate department at the
university for boys under thirteen years of age are so many
and so evident that it would seem almost unnecessary to
mention them. In the first place if parents are desirous
of having their sons sent away to school when they
are still of such tender age, they must fully realize that
special care and attention should be given to these
young boys. However, it would be a difficult matter to
make special provisions for them, unless they be kept
alone and be under the supervision of prefects and
instructors that can devote their whole time to caring
particularly for them. It would be practically impossible
to make any deviation from the ordinary curriculum in
order to benefit them, if they were permitted to be among
the other boys, for discriminations in any department,
as among men in the world, always work unsatisfactorily.
Again the intimate association of such young boys with
older ones does not always lead to the best results. Whatever
they notice in their elders they will strive to imitate, but it
too often happens that they notice only the rougher side
of their companions’ actions. Children, below the age
of -thirteen years, it must be remembered, can not be
expected to use either discretion or judgment in shaping
their actions, and the evil influence of one thoughtless
person would leave a bad impression on their youthful
ST. EDWARD’S HALb.	11
VJ	*
minds that could not be easily removed.
Still another advantage in having the Minims by them-
selves is this: their studies, their manner of spending recre-
ation and their tastes in general are very much different from
those of the more advanced boys. Hence they can do
better in class-work if they follow such lines as are specially
planned for them, and they will enjoy their games much
better if they are where they can play them without
interference from older boys. Eife in St. Edward’s Hall is
thus made more home-like for them since the rules and
regulations are especially fitted to suit their best interests.
There are a hundred and one little things that go to make
up their comfort and happiness, that could not be taken
into account if they were not in a separate department.
It must be noted here too, that the principal care of looking
after these little fellowTs is entrusted chiefly to the sisters of
the Holy Cross. And none better than these same sisters
know how to take the place of the absent mother in looking
after the training, the progress, the welfare and happiness
of those left in their care.
SPECIAL ADVANTAGES.
The advantages enumerated above have all been gen-
eral in their nature, and refer to the benefits that are
derived from making the daily routine followed by the little
boys, something separate and distinct from that of the
advanced students. These advantages are merely tempor-
ary and exist only while the student is a member of St.
Edward’s Hall.	'
There is, however, another advantage and this is the
most important of all, inasmuch as it benefits the student
through the remaining years of his college course. The
advantage here mentioned is this: that of making the initial
and preparatory courses at an institution, in which the
i2
st. Edward’s hall.
student can follow right along to graduation in one of the
collegiate courses. This saves very much trouble and gives
a pupil a better foundation for his work. It has been found
when students come here after making their preparatory
course in High schools or, perhaps, in some academies,
they would be qualified thoroughly enough in some lines
of studies, whereas other lines were totally neglected.
Hence a student that might enter as a Freshman in some
studies might be two or three years behind in others, and
he would be held back to make these up.
Again the system of teaching in the other schools which
he had attended might be so much different from ours that
the change might be a great draw-back to him on the start,
and thus operate against him all through his course. Both
these disadvantages are overcome by starting in as a pupil in
St. Bdward’s Hall. The course of studies followed there
is arranged to lead up gradually through the higher
preparatory studies in Carroll Hall and from these into
the collegiate courses, with the same evenly balanced
progress as, in the graded school for example, the primer
leads to the first reader, the first to the second, the second
to the third, etc. The system is planned in such a way
that the young mind can readily accommodate itself to it,
and, this done, the making of a successful college course
thereafter is only a matter of time and of giving an amount
of labor proportionate to the advance made in studies.
That this has been a successful scheme has been repeatedly
proved in the examinations held at the end of the prepara-
tory course, to determine the eligibility of students for
entrance into the academic department. In these examina-
tions it has almost invariably been the case that those boys
who came from St. Bdward’s Hall were easily superior to
the young men who had prepared themselves in other

schools. Being thoroughly trained for every line which
they are to follow in the next years of their college life,
these ex-Minims take the lead at the entrance examinations,
hold it all through their course, and are frequently the
ones on whom class honors fall.

DISCIPLINE.
Continued and varying experience in the care and
handling of young boys has brought about the system
of discipline now enforced in St. Bdward’s Hall. Certain
restrictions must necessarily be laid upon pupils of their
age, and rules of conduct must be formulated which they
must strictly obey. Yet every liberty that is compatible with
careful training, and every privilege conformable to their
proper development are granted to the Minims. Those
in charge of the department realize that childhood is the
most impressionable time of man’s life, and that the effects
of early training are lasting. Hence it is sought to influence
the Minims by such methods only as will develop in their
youthful minds a love for order and rightful conduct, a
proper respect for superiors and a taste for such habits as
will bring them honor in after life. Bvery care is given
to see that they are kept from everything that would in the
least taint their morals, that, if Catholic, they be instructed
in the principles of religion, and that they be taught to
strive after such virtues and manly habits of character as
will make them estimable young men. As in a well regu-
lated home, recourse is had to kindness rather than austerity.
The Sisters feel that they fill the place of the absent mother
and try to make their instructions lead the boys along such
lines as their parents would most desire them to follow.
The discipline is thus more like the regulation of an orderly
16
EDWARD’S halL.
home than like the strict mandates of a boarding school.
In order to keep the little fellows impressed with the love
and respect which they owe their parents, they are required
to write to them at least once a week.
As an incentive toward encouraging the boys to keeping
the rules, an honor system has been established. At a con-
spicuous place in the hall is placed a black-board containing
the “Roll of Honor” on which are placed the names of
all those whose conduct has been conformable to all regula-
tions and whose work has been satisfactory to their teachers.
There is great rivalry among the boys to have their names
appear on this board, and when for any act or omission one’s
name is removed it is considered a great punishment.
Then, too, there is a gold medal awarded at the end of two
fu’l years to those whose deportment has been exceptionably
good. As this fact is made known to the Minim immedi-
ately after his entrance, he generally endeavors to shape
liis conduct with a view to receiving an ‘ ‘Honor. ’ ’ It has
been found that such incentives as these have been far
more effectual toward the development of good character
than would be an application of the strap or the rule. This
latter method finds no place in St. Edward’s Hall, for
seldom, if ever, is it employed.
The order of the day in St. Edward’s Hall is as follows:
Rising at 6:40 a. m., toilet etc.; breakfast at seven, after
which a short time is allowed for recreation and exercise;
at half past seven studies and classes are begun and contin-
ued without intermission until half past nine; from half past
nine until ten recreation is given and a luncheon is served
for those that desire to partake of it. At ten classes are again
taken up and followed until 11:45; II:45> toilet; twelve,
dinner, followed by recreation; from one until three study
and class; three recreation and luncheon; half past four
ST. EDWABD’s H2*L.
17
until half past six study and classes; half past six supper
followed by recreation. Bight o’clock retiring.
From this it may be seen that the work has been arranged
as judiciously as possible toward furthering mental and
physical development at the same time. Out of the thirteen
hours and a half that constitute the Minim’s work day,
they spend barely eight hours in class work and study, and
are never at work more than two hours at a time. This
gives them ample opportunity to take such recreation as
boys of their age require, and perhaps to this, more than
to any thing else, is due the fact that they are so healthy
and rugged. The recreation and exercise in the fresh air
between each two hours of study, unbind the mind and
prepare the boys to return to their work with a freshness
and vigor that does very much toward hastening their
progress. During recreation hours as well as in the class
and study-room the Minims are always under the super-
vision of prefects. The presence of these prefects is not
intended as a means of keeping order so much as it is to
help the little fellows along and administer to any of their
needs,
SOCIETIES.
There are two societies in the Minim department, that
of the Guardian Angels of the Sanctuary, which has for its
object to supply servers for the Church offices; and the
Sorin Association which has been established with a view
to give the pupils a start in elocution as early as possible.
This society is presided over by one of the professors
who finds it a pleasant duty to train these interesting
young talkers. Meetings are held once a week after school
hours. These meetings are a source of pleasure as well as
of profit to the young enthusiasts. Not infrequently are
fhey honored at these meetings by the presence of some
18	st. Edward’s hall.
of the university officials who take pleasure in attending
in order to encourage them and watch the development they
are making. The members prepare original compositions,
deliver declamations, are trained to debate, etc. Only the
best behaved and more advanced are admitted to member-
ship. As a further encouragement for this young literary
society a gold medal is annually awarded at commencement
time to the one who has done the best work, and who shows
his merit in open contest. In conclusion it may be said
of this society that it has the honor of furnishing the
representative who delivers the greetings from St. Kdward’s
Hall to the President of the University on President’s day.

THE MINIM'S CAMPUS
The campus set aside for the exclusive use of the
Minims is an eight acre, level field, directly north of their
play hall. It is located on the brow of St. Joseph’s lake thus
commanding one of the finest views of any of the many
splendid scenes at Notre Dame. This field is a place of
great activity during those seasons in which outdoor games
may be played. There are several base ball diamonds on
which, during the warm weather in spring and summer,
organized teams battle for championship honors in the
national game and for the medals awarded to the champion
nine.
Then there are three or four gridirons where enthusias-
tic football players develop brawn and muscle in the great
college game, Rugby. Around the outside of the field a
track is laid where the track athletes and bicycle riders
do their work. It may be said here too, that in proportion
to the number of pupils it contains, St. Bdward’s Hall has
more athletes and bicycle riders than any other department
at the university. It is a pleasing sight to notice these
youngsters playing their various games, in which they put
their whole spirit and in which they labor as intensely as
if the whole world were waiting for the result. Great is the
honor of those that come out victorious, while for the
vanquished, their dejection is almost immeasurable.
In addition to the things already mentioned the campu$

is well supplied with swings, May-poles, turning poles, a
tennis court, a large toboggan slide for the winter days,
and many other apparatus with which the Minims may
spend their recreation hours in an enjoyable manner. That
they take advantage of the opportunities afforded, can
readily be seen if one makes a visit to their campus on any
day when the weather permits them to be out doors.

ATHLETICS,
Young boys need a great amount of vigorous and
wholesome exercise, when they are required to do much
mental work. Study is wearing enough on any person»
but for the youth who does not. directly see the benefit
of it, application to books is doubly tiresome. He measures
greatness more by the standard of sports than by any such
qualities as broadmindedness and culture. Hence to satisfy
his longing for games, his desire to match his skill and
strength with his fellows, he must be given ample oppor-
tunity to engage in such contests. Thus will his mind be
relieved of the strain that study would naturally put upon
it. And if there is any truth in the old saying that “all
work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,” it must neces-
sarily follow that a suitable amount of play will sharpen
the intellect and render its possessor much more competent
to work in a beneficial manner. Besides this, play developes
a strong constitution, a sound physical strength, agility
of body and a confidence in one’s own ability. This is
particularly true of young boys, who are most susceptible
of training. Bearing these facts in mind, the authorities
of St. Edward’s Hall have made every possible provision
in order to give the little fellows a plenty of opportunity
for athletics. It must not be inferred however, that they
permit all play and no work. Only during regular recre-
ation times can there be any attention given to the subject

24
ST. EDWARD'S HALL.
of games and athletics, and these are never allowed to
interfere in any way with class work. Every game is
encouraged at its proper time, but when the hour for study
comes, they must all be stopped.
Base ball and football are the two chief sports among
the Minims. In spring there are as many as eight or nine
different nines competing for the championship of the hall.
The rivalry among these various teams is something intense.
Toward the close of the season the two teams with the best
record play a series of five games and to the winners of this
series go all the honors. Each member of the team is
presented with a gold medal. In football the rivalry is
about the same, except for the fact that the strongest team
usually plays most of its games with men from Carrol
Hall, and sometimes with junior teams from South Bend.
No medals are awarded to the members of the championship
eleven. Track athletics are being rapidly developed, and
for the spring of 1900 there are no less than five teams
in St. Edward’s Hall. Among these are some clever little
athletes who may be winners on the university team if
they remain until they complete a collegiate course.
In warm weather the Minims are allowed to go
swimming nearly every evening in St. Joseph’s lake. Of
all sports, this is the one the young boys particularly enjoy.
When the Brother announces the hour for going to the lake
everyone is sure to be on hand with his bathing suit.
Whenever the boys go swimming they are always accom-
panied by Brothers and are not allowed to go beyond
certain stakes in the water so that there is absolutely no
danger of any one’s being drowned. The Brothers teach them
how to swim and see to it that none of them are left to
remain in the water too long. Whenever it is found that
one’s health is not in proper condition to permit of his going
into the lake he is never allowed to do so.

THE DIFFERENT APARTMENTS IN THE ANNEX TO
ST. EDWARD'S HALL.
In describing St. Edward’s Hall mention was made
of an annex two hundred feet long built on the eastern end
of the building. The principal object the builders had in
adding this annex was to furnish places for the Minims
to spend their recreation hours when the weather is too
26
ST. ED WARD *S HALL.
inclement to permit them to be outdoors. On this account
much attention was given to the furnishing of the
GYMNASIUM,
a room forty-eight feet long and twenty-eight feet wide,
thoroughly equipped with every apparatus which might be
used to advantage by the little fellows. In it are to be found
running ladders, rings, punching bag, horizontal and
parallel bars, turning pole, climbing poles and ladders,
Swiss ladders, dumb-bells, clubs, weights, springboards,
mats, horses, pyramid frames, etc., etc. This apartment
is now used merely as a practice room since the building
of the large university gymnasium, as the boys are taken
to that for gymnastic instruction. Next in importance to
the gynasium is the
play hall,
a large room one hundred and ten feet long and thirty feet
wide. Here all such games as basket ball, indoor base-ball,
hand ball, etc., are played, and here in fact is where the
Minims spend the greater part of their recreation hours
during the season of rough weather. This room is also
used for drilling the Sorin cadets. The
READING ROOM,
is thirty feet long and twenty feet wide. This, like the game
room, is tastefully decorated with potted plants and pictures
and furnished with comfortable chairs and couches, while
in one end is a small library. The works in the library are
chiefly such as would be attractive to young boys, for
example books like “The Boy Trapper,” ‘Tour Young
Bxplorers,” Tom Brown’s School Days,” “Father Finn’s
Stories,” “The Tittle Sailor Boy,” “Adventures of Tom
Sawyer,” “Robinson Crusoe,” “Midshipman Bob,” “Jet
the War Mule,” “Stories for Stormy Sundays,” Youth's
Companion^ etc., or any magazine or paper they may wish
from home.

immediately adjoining the play hall is eighty feet long and

athletic teams, gifts made to the Minims in the way of orna-
ments, etc. The window shelves are all covered with
potted plants and the walls are 11 decorated with pictures.
In this room are played all such games as cards, checkers,
porchesi, parlor base ball, Kings and Queens and such games
for young folks as “Jackstraws,” “Battle of “Manilla,”
“Fireman,” “Uncle Sam’s Mail,” etc., etc.

THE MAIN STUDY HALL.
The main study Hall for the more advanced pupils
in St. Edward’s is located on the second floor at about
the center of the building. It is a large well ventilated
room with four windows on each side and two doors
in each end. Thus in warm weather it can be turned
into one of the most comfortable apartments at Notre
Dame. It is 40 feet wide and forty-five feet long.
There is a large corridor at each end of the Hall leading
to the main entrances of the building. The study room
is always kept scrupulously clean and is made as attractive
looking as possible. In each of the eight windows are
kept potted plants or ferns, and the walls are all tastefully
ornamented with pictures. In one end of the Hall are
placed three statues, representing St. Joseph, the Blessed
Virgin and our Eord. In the same end of the Hall
are large maps and under these are the blackboards
where the “Tablet of Honor’1 is kept. There are forty-
eight desks in this study room, and a few extra seats
placed along the sides.
In addition to this main study hall there are other smal-
ler ones where the youngest boys are kept and given special
instruction. The Sisters in charge of these smaller halls
make it a point to visit at the different desks and help the
little fellows along in case they should meet with any difli-
30

cutties in the preparing of their lessons. Then too these boys
who are the youngest are not required to spend eight hours
a day at work; the time of study is shortened to suit their
years and regulated to suit their capacity. These very
young boys also have special refectories, in which specially
prepared food is served for them, and special dormitories
in which to sleep.

RECEPTION ROOM.
The reception room in which the Sorin Association
holds its meetings is on the second floor across the corridor
from the parlor. It contains a beautiful Everett Piano, and
all the furniture necessary to make of it a convenient and
comfortable place for society meetings. In one end is a
platform which serves the purpose of a stage. Back of this
is a large frescoe by the famous Gregori. It is a historical
picture showing the founding of the University of Notre
Dame.
THE LAVATORIES
are all located on the lower floor near the clothes room
so that they can be conveniently reached at all times either
from the campus, from the clothes rooms, or from the
athletic dressing rooms. The Minims are obliged to make
their toilet here before every meal, and Sisters are at hand
to see that it is properly done. The boys are required to
brush their teeth carefully. . Baths are taken once a week
or oftener as parents may require.
ST. EDWARD’S HALL.
THE CLOTHES ROOM.
The clothes room is a very important department in
St. Bdward’s Hall. In this each pupil has his wardrobe
in which to keep his clothes. Sisters are constantly in
charge of this room and they see to it that the boys cloth-
ing is not carelessly thrown around. All necessary mending
and repairing is done by them. Bach boy’s clothes are
folded carefully and placed in his locker in orderly condition.
Clothing is changed to suit the seasons and it is
the duty of one of the prefects to see that the boys
follow this rule. Often when the temperature suddenly
changes in one day, they may be made to change heavy
clothes for light, or light for heavy clothes. Underclothing
is changed once a week.

THE DORMITORIES.
The dormitories are all commodious and well ventilated.
Each one is presided over by a Brother. The most notice-
able thing in connection with these dormitories is the imma-
culate cleanliness that prevails all through. The floors,
the bedding and everything is kept scrupulously clean.
The beds have springs with the ordinary mattress and
over this is placed a hair mattress. Bedding is provided
in abundance so that during cold weather there need be

THE REFECTORY,
At present the majority of the Minims take their meals
in the Carroll Hall dining room, which .was originally
intended for only the Junior department. Next summer,
however, a special refectory is to be added to St. Edward’s
Hall for the exclusive use of the Minims, who will then
enjoy the privilege of dining at their own building. What
the dimensions of the St. Edward’s dining hall will be>
have not been given out as yet, but it will be sufficiently
large to accommodate all.

st. Edward’s hall.
THE CHAPEL*
Just across the corridor at the east end of the study-
hall is the chapel, forty feet long and twenty-five feet wide.
The altars are in the east end of the room. The seats are
all made of white-oak. There is a fine, moderately large size
pipe organ in the rear. As the chapel touches only one
side of the building, there are stained glass windows on only
one side of it. Three of these four windows are the gifts
of Mr. John Cudahy, Mr. Thomas D. Sexton and Mr.
Augustus Meehan, respectively. Opposite the windows are
four blind windows. The first, with representation of Saint
Ann, is the gift of Mr. George Moxley; the second, with
36
st. Edward’s hall.
representation of Saint Theresa is the gift of Mr. Leo
Kelly; the third, with representation of Saint Augustine,
was given by Mr. Thomas J. Noonan; the fourth, with
representation of St. Peter, is the gift of Mr. John P.
Fortune. All these donors were at one time pupils in St.
Bdward’s Hall. The boys assemble in this chapel for
morning and evening prayers which last only a few minutes.
Occasionally they have Mass celebrated there especially
for them. On such occasions they have their own choir,
directed by a Sister, and occasionally one of their
members presides at the organ.
THE INFIRMARY.
So seldom is it that any of the boys in St. Bdward’s
Hall are sick that no special infirmary has been found
necessary for them. When occasionally it happens that
one of them is complaining of any illness he is put in
charge of the nurses at the university infirmary and is
visited regularly by the house physician. In case of
sickness the boy’s parents are immediately notified. All
that trained skill and medical science can do is at once
done for the patient, hence when a Minim does go to the
infirmary, he seldom remains there more than a few days.
In order to encourage the boys to guard against catching
cold etc., a premium is given to those whose health has
been the best during the year.

THE COURSES OF INSTRUCTION.
The courses of instruction in St. Bdward’s Hall
embrace all the studies commonly taught to boys under
thirteen years of age. They were planned with a view
to giving pupils a broad foundation for preparatory school
work and ultimately for university education. There are
many special branches such as music, painting, elocution,
etc., which are taught at the option of parents sending
their children here. Since boys as young as six years
of age are received into St. Bdward’s Hall the courses
necessarily start with the primary studies and in some cases
even with the alphabet. From this they go through all
the readers and, supposing the boy to have started his
course in St. Bdward’s Hall, by the time he is ready to
leave there and enter the Junior Department he has finished
his course and passed through the sixth reader. United
States History is taught to the pupil as soon as he is far
enough advanced for it. Geography, descriptive, political
and physical, is all taken up and gone through in its turn.
All studies in orthography are finished. English grammar
is also completed through parsing, analysis and diagram-
ming. Harvey’s text book is used. A good start in
English composition is given the boys at the close of
their grammar studies. Special attention is given to
teaching arithmetic as this is deemed one of the most
important studies. When a boy has finished the course
of arithmetic in St. Edward’s Hall he has passed
38
ST. EDWARD’S HALL.
through mental arithmetic, through all the common
branches of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,
fractions, common and decimal, mensuration, percentage and
everything given in Brook’s Higher Arithmetic. When
this is completed, those that are advanced far enough are
put in the algebra classes and given a start for higher
mathematics. Penmanship, of course, is included in the
regular course of studies and in this line the pupils are
drilled thoroughly so that the course may be finished as
quickly as possible. Thus Reading, Spelling, History,
Grammar, Geography, Arithmetic and Penmanship, all are
thoroughly covered by the boys that make the course in
St. Edward’s Hall. It is found too, that when they reach
their thirteenth year they are usually as far advanced as
other boys of sixteen years who come from other schools.
These are the principal studies taught. Catechism
and Bible History are added only for Catholic boys.
Others do not study them. One can see at a glance
that these studies include nearly every branch ordinarily
taught to young boys. They are well adapted to fit
young fellows either for a further course of collegiate
education or for a course in commercial studies, which
both may be followed here at Notre Dame. The President
of the university visits St. Edward’s Hall once a month
to examine the boys and see what progress they are making
with their work.
The above studies as well as instrumental music and
vocal culture are all taught by Sisters of the Holy Cross
who are famous for their efficiency as teachers, and who
form the regular staff of instructors in St. Edward’s Hall.
In addition to these there are many special branches
taken up and these for the most part are taught by
regular professors and instructors from the univer-
sity. These special courses include, painting and
st. Edward’s hall.

drawing, elocution, physical culture, and the languages.
In painting of course only a moderate amount of
work can be done because the students are so young
that advanced work is impossible for them. In drawing
they are given the elementary principles, such as drawing,
outlines, drawing from examples and making rough
sketches. In the languages they do very well. In Isatin,
for example, they go through all the declensions and conju-
gations thus acquiring a good foundation for further work.
In German and Spanish they go far enough to be able to
read and write these languages quite readily and the same
may be said of their work in French.

THE COURSES IN MUSIC.
The department of music in St. Ed ward’s Hall is
carefully looked after. Parents who bring their children
here with a desire of having them trained in the musical
line may rest assured that they will be thoroughly instruc-
ted. There are several large piano rooms on the second
floor where those boys who take instructions on the piano-
forte do their daily practice. It should be mentioned here
too, that these boys are not permitted to waste their time
at the piano as most boys are inclined to do when the
tiresome finger exercises begin to grow wearisome. A
Sister is on duty all the time to see that they practice
conscientiously.
The course of instruction in piano playing begins with
the most rudimentary work and goes as far along as the
student desires to follow those studies. Many of the young
fellows, that have a taste for music and have sufficient
talent to master its difficulties, have become quite proficient
performers in a short time. Some of them have even been
able to handle the pipe organ with a moderate degree of
skill. Violin and mandolin are the next most popular
instruments. There are many of these in use in St.
Edward’s Hall and among the boys is formed a mandolin club
which has made some creditable appearances in the past year
or two. Pupils are taught to play other instruments such
as banjo, guitar, the reed and brass instruments, etc., if
their parents so desire. However these have not been
ST. EDWARDS HALB.	d-i
taken up very widely as yet. The piano, violin and
mandolin are the instruments most used. During Com-
mencement week at the university, a concert is given by
the pupils in the Minim department, and the musical
numbers on their program are such as to win the approba-
tion of visitors.
GENERAL REMARKS.
All that has been said in the foregoing pages of this
prospectus is intended merely as a matter of information
to parents who may be desirous of sending their sons to
the Minim department at Notre Dame. Naturally enough
before leaving their boys here they would have many
questions to ask concerning the care they receive, the
studies they take, the privileges they have, the discipline
that governs them, the attention given in case of sickness,
etc., etc. We have intended to make this little pamphlet
answer all such questions and thus save the trouble of
an almost endless amount of correspondence. In the first
place a close description is given of the Hall and its various
apartments. Then the discipline is outlined, the work
set apart for the Minims is discussed, and some pages are
devoted to explaining how the little fellows spend their
recreation hours. The accompanying cuts, such as those
of dormitories, class rooms, chapel, etc., are given to show
the accommodations provided to insure every comfort
for the pupils.
The advantages of making a course in St. Mdward’s
Hall are touched upon merely to show parents that the
sacrifice they make by depriving themselves of their child-
ren’s company, will be repaid by the facilities offered for
42	st. Edward’s hadL.
moulding these children into cultered and estimable young
men. We have tried to make plain the fact that as many
comforts as possible are supplied to the boys and that they
receive every attention that care can give them.
The pupils of St. Edward’s Hall are the priviledged
persons at Notre Dame. The older student and the
members of the Faculty take great interest in them and
they are usually referred to as the “Princes.” Everyone
has a pet among the Minims; and the attention of five
hundred, good natured young college students goes to
make their days as happy as boyhood days should be.

THE SORIN CADETS.
Tight military drill is compulsory in the Minim depart-
ment. However the boys are never required to do more
than two hours drilling in a week. They are supplied with
Remington rifles and put in charge of an experienced man.
There are three companies in the department and each
of them reaches a commendable degree of profiiciency in
the art of drilling during the course of a year. We give
here a cut showing the cadets and their commander as
they appear for regular drill every Wednesday. The
simpler foot movements and the more common moves
of shifting the gun have been quite readily learned by them
and on some occasions they are called upon to march with
the companies of Carroll Hall. The uniform used by
the Sorin cadets is of dark navy blue with red broad-
cloth stripes on the legs of the trousers and around the
wrist of the coat sleeve. Brass buttons are used all
through. When thus attired the companies present a
very fine appearance.

Minim Department.
St. Mary’s Academy.
(One Mile West of the University of Notre Dame.)
Pupils who need primary education and those of tender
ige, are here carefully prepared for the academic and
advanced courses. For the care and training of these
younger pupils there has been established a separate
department to which the most scrupulous attention has
always been paid by the sisters in charge of the institution.
Great care is taken to see that these Minims have every
privilege and every comfort that is compatible with proper
training.

THE NOTRE DAME SCHOLASTIC,
Is the title of a neat 2 8-page paper, devoted to the
interests of the students, and published by them
at the University every week during Term time.
This journal opens a field for young writers who
might otherwise, for want of a proper medium,
allow their talents to remain inactive. It also
affords students an opportunity for practical exper-
ience in journalism. During seasons of special
interest at the University, The Scholastic is
published daily.
It will be the endeavor of the Bditors during the
coming year to merit the encouragement given the
paper in the past, and the encomiums bestowed
upon it by the press in general.
The Scholastic will be sent to any address for
$1.50 per annum.
