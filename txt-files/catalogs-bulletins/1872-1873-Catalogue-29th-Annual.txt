THE University was founded in 1842 by the Congregation of the Holy
Cross, and was chartered by the Legislature of the State of Indiana in
1844, with power to confer all the usual degrees. '
The College Buildings are on an eminence, near two small, picturesque
1 akes of pure spr i ng water, in th e m i dst of the line and hcal thy • fa rm in g
region.of the St. Joseph Valley, and scarcely a mile from the river. The
College can easily be reached from all parts .of the United States and Canada,
by means of two great trunk lines of Railway,—the Lake Shore & Michi-
gan Southern, and the Michigan Central; the former passing within a
mile of the College grounds, and the latter connecting at Niles with the
recently built Railway between that place and South Bend, which runs within
half a mile of the College. At the Michigan Southern Railroad depot, South
Bend, omnibuses or private conveyances can be obtained.
The Buildings are well adapted for the purpose for which they were
erected. The Study-Halls, Class-Rooms, Dining-Rooms, Sleeping Apartments,
and Recreation Halls are commodious and capable of giving accommodation
to five hundred resident Students..	.
- THE SITE
of the College is one particularly adapted to the improvement of the Students.
It is secluded and healthy, and constant care is rendering a spot naturally
beautiful still more attractive by art and good taste.	'
We state only the advantages of
HEALTH AND RETIREMENT
that are enjoyed by the inmates of the Institution;—a description of all that
pleases at Notre Dame would take us beyond the limits of these pages. We
prefer to give a hearty invitation to all our patrons, and to all who think of
confiding their sons to our care, to come and see and judge for themselves.
The advantages arising from '	‘
THE RETIRED POSITION ■
of the College cannot fail to be appreciated by parents who have at heart the
education of their children; and even the careless student when once interested
in his studies soon finds out the benefits he can derive from an uninterrupted
8	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
attention to class and study. Though secluded in a great measure from the
busy world without, yet the number of Students and the extensive College
grounds give him a world of his own, in which, what with Class, Examination,
Notes, Literary Societies, Religious Associations, Base-Ball Clubs, Boat-Clubs,
Dramatic and Musical Entertainments, he finds full enjoyment and amuse-
ment, and companions, ideas and sentiments that all concur to fix his mind
on his studies and establish him in habits of piety, application and order—
the influence of which will be felt during his entire life. He breathes for a few
short years the atmosphere of order, of regularity in all that he does; of pro-
found application to studies, broken only by healthy and regular recreation;
and certainly, in our times,when serious and solid studies are becoming so
rare, when all kinds of inducements to waste and fritter away time are forced
upon young Students, when morals are so lightly watched over, the advantage
of the retired locality of Notre Dame cannot be too highly spoken of.
Providence has singularly blessed the Institution in regard to health, and
those who have had their sons in the College can give their testimony that the
regular course of life, added to the salubrious climate, the fresh country air,
has done much to improve the health of their children.
The disciplinary government is mild, yet sufficiently energetic to preserve
order and regularity. The morals and general deportment of the pupils are
assiduously watched over, and their comforts and personal habits receive the
same attention as if they were in the bosom of their own families.
REGULATIONS OF THE UNIVERSITY.
All the Students are required to attend' the exercises of public worship
with punctuality and decorum.
Students must show themselves obedient and respectful towards the Pro-
fessors and Prefects of the Institution—never absenting themselves from the
place in which they ought to be, without permission from proper authority.
Students ifiust carefully avoid every expression in the least injurious to
Religion, or morals, their Professors, Prefects or fellow-Students.
The use of tobacco is strictly forbidden.
Intoxicating liquors are absolutely prohibited.
Compensation for all damage done to the furniture, or other property of
the College, will be required from the person or persons causing such damage.
No branch of study, once commenced, shall be discontinued without per-
mission of the Director of Studies.	;	:
No one shall leave the University grounds without the permission of the
President or Vice-President.
Bath-rooms, provided with hot and cold water, are fitted up for the use of
the Students during the winter. In warm weather, however, the Students
bathe twice a week in St. Joseph’s Lake.
Students who have failed to give satisfaction in the Class-room, or who
shall have been guilty of misconduct shall perform such tasks as shall be
0

assigned them, and will be excluded from all College exercises until such
tasks be accomplished.
No book, periodical or newspaper shall be introduced into the College,
without being previously examined and approved by the Director of Studies.
Objectionable books found in the possession of Students will be withheld
from them until their departure from the University.
.	. . GENERAL INFORMATION.
The Academic Year commences on the first Tuesday of September, and
closes on the last Wednesday of June, when the Annual Commencement, the
Conferring of Degrees and Distribution of Premiums take place. It is divided
into two Sessions of five months each. At the termination of each Session, a
strict examination of all the different classes is made in the presence of the
Faculty.
When a Student presents himself for admission into the College, he is
examined by the Director of Studies, and placed in the class for which his
previous attainments may have qualified him. His further promotion depends
on his application and progress. Should any Student, during the year, be
found capable of passing to a higher class, he will be promoted, and such pro-
motion is equivalent to the honors of the class he left.	■
: The Degree of Bachelor of Arts will be conferred on such of the Students
as shall have completed their Classical Course, and passed successfully an
examination before the Faculty.
The Degrees of LL.B and' LL.D., as also those of Bachelor of Science
and Master of Science, will be conferred on similar conditions.
Diplomas will be given to the Students who shall have completed the
Commercial Course, passed a satisfactory examination before the Board of
Examiners, and given clear evidence of their good character.
Special facilities exist at Notre Dame for the acquirement of the French
and German Languages. Not only are these Languages taught very carefully
by persons of acknowledged competency, but many of the members of the
Institution being natives of France and Germany, opportunities at all times
occur for conversation in these tongues.
All Students applying for admission will be required to give satisfactory
evidence of their moral standing.
There are in the Institution several Societies, whose Constitution and
By-Laws have been approved by the Faculty, such as the Archconfraternity,
St. Gregory’s Society, Holy Angels’, Holy Childhood, Philodemic, St. Ed-
ward’s, Thespian, St. Cecilia’s, Columbian and Philharmonic Societies, with
which Students are authorized and recommended to connect themselves.
O” In case of sickness, the Student does not remain in the College rooms,
but is immediately taken to the Infirmary, where he is attended and nursed
with devoted care by experienced Sisters, whose attention to the sick needs no
recommendation.	-

and held its first meeting in June of that year, on the day preceding the
Annual Commencement.	.
The Association numbers among its members not only the regular grad-
uates of the University, but also those who at any time held the office of
President or Vice-President of the University, and those on whom honorary
degrees have been conferred by the Faculty. Those who have been prom-
inently-connected with the University of Notre Dame as Professors are
eligible to membership, and may be admitted by a two-third vote of the
members present at any regular meeting.
The following is a list of the members up to June 25,1873. The gradu-

This charitable Society is composed of the Students of the Minim Depart-
ment only. The primary object of the Society of the Holy Childhood, of
which this little Society forms a part, is to afford an opportunity to children
throughout the Christian world to contribute their share towards the redemp-
tion of Pagan children from the darkness- of heathenism. The monthly con-
tributions of the members of this Society are small, but the aggregate is con-
siderable—while thousands of children are by this means- trained up to
habits of charity.

ation of having already graduated in Science, and being engaged also during the
year just past in teaching, generously declined to compete for the prize in his Class,
wishing to leave this honor entirely to the students proper.
46	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,
SFEOIALTIES.
LANGUAGES,	,
It is the desire 'of the authorities of the University of Notre Dame to
promote the study of the foreign languages, the use of which is so frequent
and necessary for business or scientific purposes.
The German language, the classes of which are so numerously attended,
will be taught by four Professors during the next scholastic year. The number
of German students attending the University is becoming greater every year.
The French language, though more especially the language of the
Collegiate Course/ will be of great advantage to the Scientific students. A
new Professor has been secured for next year.
Other languages may be taught when required.	■	•
SHORT-HAND WRITING AND TELEGRAPHY.
These two branches will call the special attention of the students of
the Commercial Course. Telegraph apparatuses will be purchased, and placed
in competent hands. It is very probable that Notre Dame will be in direct
communication with South Bend and the rest of the world by electric wires
before the end of 1873.
ANATOMY AND MATERIA MEDICA. ,
Young men desiring to study for the Medical profession will find oppor-
tunities to do so at Notre Dame. Yet, owing, to the want of a sufficient
museum whereby this important branch could be thoroughly illustrated, the
course of studies in this Department is limited, and embraces principally
Anatomy. The remainder of the course is completed in some of our neigh-
boring Universities. As a Preparatory Course, that which' is given here,
under Kev.' L. Neyron, M.D., leaves nothing to be desired.
.	PAINTING AND DRAWING.	‘
. The Drawing Classes showed last year a large increase on the preceding
years. The University enjoys means adequate to all demands in that branch.
It possesses a large quantity of models in all sorts of drawings, a fine studio,
and a v-igilant and zealous teacher of the art.
Painting promises likewise to be one of the popular branches of Art
taught at Notre Dame. A special Professor from Paris has been secured.
MUSIC.	.
This Department is complete in all its appointments. It has five Pro-
fessors, and, is divided into classes on the regular Conservatory system. An
Orchestra of fifteen pieces, with an excellent Quartette, and a Brass Band
of twenty-five instruments, are some of the leading features of the Musical
Department.
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.	47
Vocal Music will be highly cultivated next year. A Professor of merit
is announced from Paris. We call the special attention of our students and
patrons to this favorite and useful branch of music, which costs but little and
is now so deservedly popular.
■ ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATORY.,
A temporary Astronomical Observatory has been erected, in which the
fine instrument presented by the Emperor Napoleon has been placed. The
studies of the Class of Astronomy are now rendered practically interesting.
LIBRARIES.
: The College Library contains some twelve thousand volumes, very care-
fully arranged by the Librarian, Bev. J. C. Carrier; Donations of books,
especially to the Law Library, will be thankfully received.
The Circulating Library was commenced during the course of the year with
four hundred volumes—it now numbers over one thousand. All the Libra-
ries which formerly belonged to Literary and Religious Societies have been
merged into it. Instead of the dozen or more bookcases which often only
hid awa}- instructive books, a beautiful collection of Literary and Religious
works is now open to the? students in a room fitted up for a Reading Room.
.	“THE SCHOLASTIC”	.
This is the title of a neat little paper published every week, except in
vacation, at the University of Notre Dame. The chief object of this paper is
to keep the parents and friends of our students informed on the various sub-
jects of study and discipline at this University and at St. Mary’s Academy,
and of the progress of their sons and daughters in these two institutions. For
this purpose, regular weekly reports are given, consisting of the names of
those who deserve, by their excellent conduct, to be recorded on the Roll of
Honor, and who by their perseverance and industry deserve special commen- ■
dationfrom their various professors and teachers. Other reports, relative to
the arrangement of classes, the promotion of the more talented and energetic
students, etc., also find place in this paper, and keep parents and friends
accurately informed on all that concerns their children.
This paper also opens a field for aspiring young writers, who might
otherwise, through timidity, allow their talents in this respect to remain in-
active; while many articles of an instructive and literary character, from
writers of mature mind and ability, render The Scholastic a valuable pub-
lication for all who desire variety and utility in their reading. Our little
College paper at present consists of eight wide two-column pages, and as
soon as a sufficient patronage will justify its conductors to do so, it will be..
increased in size, and thus rendered still more useful and interesting.
