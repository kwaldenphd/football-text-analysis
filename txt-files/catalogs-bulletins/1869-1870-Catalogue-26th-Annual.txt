■ When the Congregation of the Holy Cross planted its standard in the St.
Joseph Valley in 1842, the time of Very Rev. E-. Sorin’s arrival, the prospects
j of success were but moderate; but the founder of the College, poor in purse,
yet rich in zeal and energy, strong in his confidence in God and in his devotion
to the Queen of heaven, the Help of Christians, to whom he dedicated the great
. enterprise he was then beginning, has seen the College gradually expand to its
| present growth, and gain the confidence of all who have patronized it
I
i	Tlxe University of Notre Dame
has attained its present honorable position among the educational institutions
of the United States by the steady and persevering efforts of its founder and
all connected with it to realize the object for which it was established: to give
an opportunity to the youth of America of obtaining a thorough education,—
mental, moral, and physical.
The experience of a quarter of a century has shown that the system
adopted and gradually developed by the increasing importance of the College
is a good and efficient one. By strictly adhering to it the College has sprung
up vigorously, with no mushroom growth that gives no promise of strength
and long life,-but like the sturdy oak that each year adds steadily but surelv to
its strength. And though the “improvements”—a word so familiar to all the
friends of Notre Dame—that have been made in the grounds and buildings are
more apparent to the casual visitor, yet to those intimately acquainted with
the Institution it is evident that the- same energy and reliance in God, that
have replaced the old log house on the lakeside—the only house on the prem-
ises when Very Rev. E. Soktn arrived—by the buildings that are now seen,
have been busy in increasing and perfecting the means of rendering the youth
of Notre Dame thorough students while in the Institution, and good citizens
in the various walks of life.
TTie Cliarter
of the Institution, granted by the Legislature of Indiana, in 1844, under the
name of “University of Notre Dame,” empowers it to confer degrees in all
the learned professions.	'
The University is conducted by the Fathers of the Congregation of theHoly
Gross; a number of highly competent Lay Professors assist in the various
branches of studies; other teachers and the prefects of discipline are taken
from among the Brothers of the Holy Cross, who are, like the Fathers, devoted
by their sacred calling to the education of youth.	•	•
-----------------------------------------------------:----.j
8	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
The disciplinary government is mild, yet sufficiently energetic to preserve
the most perfect order and regularity. The morals and the general deport
ment of the pupils are assiduously watched over, and their comforts and per-
sonal habits receive the same attention as if they were in the bosom of their
own families.
Tlxe Jhocsttion
of the College is one particularly adapted to the improvement of the Students.
It is secluded and healthy, and constant care is rendering a spot naturally
beautiful still more attractive by art and good taste.
We state only the advantages of
Health, and Retimnent,
that are enjoyed by the inmates of the Institution;—a description of all that j
pleases at Notre Dame would take us beyond the limits of these pages. We
prefer to give a hearty invitation to all our patrons, and to all who think of I
confiding their sons to our care, to come and see and judge for themselves.
The advantages arising from	j
i
The Iletircd ^Position
of the College cannot fail to be appreciated by parents who have at heart the
education of their children; and even the careless student when once inter-
ested in his studies soon finds out the benefits he can derive from an uninter-
rupted attention to class and study. Though secluded in a great measure
from the busy world without, yet the number of Students and the extensive
College grounds give him a world of his own, in which, what with Class, Ex-
amination, Notes, Literary Societies, Religious Associations, Base-ball Clubs,
Dramatic and Musical Entertainments, he finds full enjoyment and amusement,
and companions, ideas and sentiments that all concur to fix his mind on his
studies and establish him in habits of piety, application and order—the influ- |
cnce of which will be felt his entire life. He breathes for a few short years |
the atmosphere of order, regularity in all that he does; of profound application i
to studies, broken only by healthy and regular recreation; and certainly, in our •
times, when serious and solid studies are becoming so rare, when all kinds of i
inducements to waste and fritter away time are farced upon young Students,
when morals are so lightly watched over, the advantage of the retired locality
of Notice Dame cannot be too highly spoken of.
ITealLli.
Providence has singularly blessed the Institution in regard to health, and those
who have hail their sons in the College can give their testimony that the regu- .
lar course of life, added to the salubrious climate, the fresh country air, has
done much to improve the health of their children. In case of sickness, the
student does not remain in the College rooms, but is immediately taken to the I
apartments of the Infirmary, where he is attended and nursed with devoted |:
care by experienced Sisters, whose care for the sick needs no recommendation i
here to be duly appreciated.	।

are on a slight eminence, near bro small, picturesque lakes of pure spring wa-
ter, in the midst of the fine and healthy farming region of the Valley of the St.
Joseph, and scarcely a mile from that river. The locality can easily be reached
from all parts of the United States by means of either of two great trunk lines
of Railroad,—the Michigan Southern & Northern Indiana, and the Michigan
Central, the former passing within a mile of the College grounds. At the Mich-
igan Southern Railroad depot, South Bend, omnibuses or private conveyances
can be obtained. Besides these, a stage running from South Bend to Niles
passes the College twice a day. In South Bend there are several hotels.

ds a structure one hundred and sixty feet long, eighty-five feet deep and six sto-
ries high, surmounted by a well-proportioned dome, on the summit bf which
stands a statue of the Blessed Virgin-—a beautiful work of art. The exterior
of the building, especially when viewed from the wide avenue that stretches a
mile in front of the College, makes a favorable impression upon all beholders;
and the interior, admirably arranged and divided up into Study Halls, Recrea-
tion Rooms, etc., for the accommodation and comfort of the Students who live
—not merely study and recite—in it, completes the good opinion already
formed by a view of the exterior.	'
The Eastern Wing-, eighty-five feet long, forty-five feet wide and six
stories high, contains the Dining-Room, Study-Hall, and Sleeping Apartments
of the Senior Students.
The Western Wing-, of the same dimensions as the Eastern, contains the
same apartments for the Junior Students.
In the Central Building are the Wash Rooms for Juniors and Seniors;
Parlors; private rooms for Professors, and Class Rooms; the Museum, Library,
and College Chapel.
The	Hall
stands to the east, a building one hundred feet long and forty-five feet wide and
two stories high. It is divided off into Music Rooms, each containing a piano
and other instruments of music. Great attention has already been given to
Vocal and Instrumental Music. The continued success this year of the Choir,
the Philharmonic Society, the Band and Orchestra, under the direction of
their respective Professors, is the best proof that great attention has been paid
to .this department during the past ten months.
On the ground floor of this building is the
Junlors’ Recreation Hall,
occupying the length and breadth of the building. Close by is the Recrea-
tion Ground for the Juniors, and a little farther off are the grounds especially
set apart for their great games of Foot-bal], Base-ball, and other sports that
require more space than is contained in the everyday play-grounds.

"WasliingtoxL Hall,
a building one hundred feet long, fifty feet deep, and two stories high, lies to
the south of the Music Hall, and is devoted to Elocutionary and Dramatic Ex-
ercises. All the Students of Notre Dame have pleasing memories of Wash-
ington Hall. The Commencement Exercises' are held in it; and frequently’
during the year the students repair to it with pleasure,-to be entertained by
their fellow-students with music, declamations and dramatic performances. It
is handsomely fitted up, and is well suited for the purpose for which it was
built. On the ground floor is
Tine Seniors’ Recreation Hall,
which.is properly fitted up for the daily amusements of the Seniors, having on
one side the ordinary recreation yard with Ball Alley and Gymnastic Appa-
ratus, and on the other, more extensive grounds for the use of those who
indulge in Base-ball and other violent games.
Tire InBLrinttry,
and other buildings directly connected with the College, are in proportion to
the size of the College. An Observatory is in contemplation, in' which, will be
placed the fine refracting
Telescope,
* presented to the University by his Majesty the Emperor of France. It is one
of the best instruments of the size ever manufactured. The focal length of
the instrument is over nine feet, and the diameter of the object-glass six inches
clear. There are two eye-pieces for land objects : one of seventy-five, and
the other of one hundred power.
Before leaving this part of our Prospectus relating to Buildings, we must
mention several which, though they are not exclusively for College purposes,
do their part in making up the Establishment of Notre Dame, of which the
College Building is the centre.
Tlsc ClmTCli. of file Sacred Eeai't?
to the west of the College Building, serves as a place of worship to the Cath-
olics of the neighborhood, to the Students, and other inmates of Notre Dame.
It contains a fine-toned Organ of thirty-two stops. The sacred music per-
formed in this Church is of a superior order. In the Church tower is a peal
of thirty-two bells—the first of the kind imported, and one of the finest in
the United States. The base of the chime is made by the large bell re- ,
cently imported from France, and presented to the Church of Notre Dame by
. the friends of the Institution. Its weight is thirteen thousand pounds, and its
diameter, at the base, is eight feet eight inches.
Tlxe Mairuial Imbor School,
which deserves a notice apart, has been removed from its former position to
• give room to beautify and ornament more extensive grounds in front of the
College. It now stands near the Farm House, and all the Shops have been -
moved to the same locality.

f nected with the College, though we might add to the list the Printing Office
of the Ave Mj.klv, in which is published the journal of that name, and from
which, for ten months in the year, issues the Notre Dame Scholastic, a
paper edited by the Students of Notre Dame.

----------------
The Academic year commences on the first Tuesday of September, and
closes on tile last Wednesday of June, when the Annual Commencement, the
j Conferring of Degrees and Distribution of Premiums take place. It is divi-
’ ded into two Sessions of five months each. At the termination of each Scs-
i sion, a strict examination of all the different classes is made in the presence of
the Faculty.
When a Student presents himself for admission into the College, he is ex-
amined -by the Director of Studies, and placed in the class for which his pre-
vious attainments may have qualified him. His further promotion depends
on his application and progress. Should any Student, during the year, be
found capable of passing to a higher class, he will be promoted, and such
promotion is equivalent to the honors of the class he left.
The’Degree of Bachelor of Arts will be conferred on such of the Students
as shall have completed their Classical Course, and passed successfully a strict
examination before the Faculty.
The Degree of Master of Arts will be conferred on each of the graduates
of the first Degree, who shall have devoted at least two years to Literary
• or Scientific Studies.
The Degrees of LL. B., Bachelor of Science and Master of Science will
also be conferred on similar conditions.
Diplomas will be given to the Students who shall have completed the
Commercial Course, passed a satisfactory examination before the Board of
Examiners, and given clear evidence of their moral character.
Special facilities exist at Notre Dame for the acquirement of the French
and German Languages. Not only are these Languages taught very carefully
by persons of acknowledged competency, but many of the members of the
Institution being natives of France and Germany, opportunities at all times
occur for conversation in'these tongues.
All Students applying for admission will be required to give satisfactory
evidence of their moral standing.
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
All letters sent and received by Students may be opened and read by the
president or his substitutes.
There are in the Institution several Societies, whose Constitutions and By-
Laws have been approved by the Faculty, such as the Arch confraternity, Holy
Angels’, Holy Childhood, Philodemic, St. Edward’s, Thespian, St. Cecilia’s, and
Philharmonic Societies, with which Students are authorized and recommended
to connect themselves.

notice, settle all accounts, and supply means to defray all traveling expenses.
Should a Student withdraw himself, or be withdrawn by his parents or
guardians before the expiration of the session, no deduction is made except in
case of sickness or absolute dismissal.

February, April, and June.
15.	On the first Wednesday of every month, “ Certificates of Good Con-
duct” and “Improvement in Class” are issued by the Faculty to such Stu-
dents as deserve them.	I
16.	In the Refectory of the Senior Department, and also in that of the ।
Junior, conspicuous to the eyes of visitors, may be seen the “ Tables of Honor,”
presided over by the Vice-President and Prefect of Discipline. At these are
seated twenty-two of the Students whose conduct has been the most exemplary
during the preceding week. They are elected by the unanimous vote of the
Professors and Prefects.
17.	Bath rooms, provided with hot and cold water, are fitted up for
the use of the Students during the winter; in warm weather, however, they
bathe twice a week in St. Joseph’s Lake.
18.	On Sunday and Wednesday mornings the Students must wrap up and
place upon their beds their soiled linen of the previous half week. On Mon-
day morning the Students of the Senior and Junior Departments repair in
ranks and in silence to the Dormitories, whence they take their Sunday clothes
and carry them to their trunks. And on Saturday, at half-past three o’clock,
they go in the same manner to the Trunk-room, and bring their Sunday |
clothes to the Dormitories. The Students will be reviewed at eight o’clock
on Sunday and Wednesday mornings, with special reference to their personal
neatness.
19.	Stationery, etc., will be delivered to Students, as follows: on Mondays
and Thursdays, at half-past twelve o’clock, to the Students of the Senior De-
partment; Wednesdays, at half-past seven A. M., to the Students of the Junior
Department. Every Student should have a memorandum book in which to
enter all his receipts and expenditures, and his notes for recitation in class and
for conduct during his stay in college. Books prepared expressly for this
purpose can be obtained from the Secretary.
20.	Students who have failed to give satisfaction in the Class-room, or
who shall have been guilty of misconduct or breach of rule, will bo sent to the
Detention-room during the recreations or the promenades, and required to
prepare their lessons, or perform such tasks as shall be assigned them, and
will be excluded from all College exercises until such tasks be accomplished.
21.	Those Students who read sufficiently well and audibly, will occupy
the Reader’s stand, in their turn, in the Refectory. An alphabetical list of
Public Readers will be posted- in a conspicuous place, and every one named
in it will read one day, in order, at dinner and supper. At the end of each
meal, any Student is liable to be called upon to give an account of what he has
heard read.
22.	Senior Students will be permitted to read or study from eight to a
quarter to nine o’clock P. M.
23.	Every month all the Students must write to their parents or guard-
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
15
ians, and have their letters corrected by a member of the Faculty, appointed
by the President, previous to their being mailed. All letters sent or received
may be opened by the President or Vice-President.
24.	When a Student is sick, he will obtain permission from the Prefect
of Health to go to the Infirmary, where he must observe the regulations of the
place until his recovery.
25.	No book, periodical or newspaper -shall be introduced into the Col-
lege, without being previously examined and approved by the Director of
Studies. Objectionable books found in the possession of Students will be
withheld from them until their departure from the University.
'N. B.—Whether in.class or in recreation, when permitted to converse at
table, or during their walks, Students should endeavor to improve the purity
of their language, and cultivate urbanity of manners. A few years in Col-
lege would be profitably employed, if nothing else were learned than to con-
verse and behave with the dignity and propriety of gentlemen.
The happiness, no -less than the improvement, of Students, is so closely
connected with the good order and even rigid discipline of the College, that no
young gentleman of good sense, who has at heart his own welfare and the
accomplishment of his purpose in entering the Institution, can fail to discover
the importance of a strict observance of the foregoing Rules. If the authori-
. ties of the University exhort all to exhibit a sincere and unwavering zeal in
keeping those Regulations, they demand of Students nothing more than the
promotion of their- own interest.

UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.	19
All the branches necessary for a good legal education are included in the
course. The Code and Common Law systems of Pleading and Practice are
taught. The course of studies in this department embraces, chiefly, Ethics;
Political Economy; Constitutional and International Law; Municipal Law;
Law of Contracts; Equity Jurisprudence; Criminal Law; Evidence, Plead-
ing and Practice.
For the purpose of acquiring a practical as well as a theoretical knowledge
of the legal profession, the students shall be required, during the course, to
argue cases, draw up pleadings, and conduct Law and Chancery suits according
to the rules and formalities of regular courts of justice.
As it is a matter of the highest importance to a young Lawyer that, on
being admitted to the practice of his profession, he should be able to express
himself clearly and fluently, full opportunities will be afforded for cultiva-
ting the art of public speaking. As one means of attaining this end, and
for the purpose of familiarizing the student with the’practical workings of
his future profession, Moot Courts, under the direction of a Professor, will
be frequently held during the course. For the cultivation of other kinds of
eloquence, still further facilities are afforded in the various Literary and
Debating Societies of the University.	,
In addition to the general course of instruction, students will receive every
assistance in studying the Laws peculiar to their respective States.
t The entire course for those just commencing the study of the Law,
is intended to be completed in two years divided into four terms which
correspond with those of the other departments of the University.
Every applicant for admission into this department is expected to have, at
least, a complete English education. It is very desirable that ’he should also
have a classical training before commencing the study of the Law; neverthe-
less, those who may not possess this advantage will, without extra charge, be
afforded ample facilities for acquiring a knowledge of the classics, whilp.
prosecuting their legal studies.
Students intending to follow the Law Course may enter at any time, but
it is more advisable and profitable for them to present themselves at the
beginning of a Term.	(
The students will be required to pass through an examination at the close
of each Term, and also to present an essay, of not more than seven pages of
legal cap, on some one of the matters which they shall have seen. The notes
of these special examinations and essays, as well as those of the application
and general standing of the members in class throughout the Law Course,
will be placed to their respective credits in the result of the final examination
for the degree of LL. B.	•
20	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
Without entering into details, the order of studies is substantially pre-
sented under the following general heads:
Tix’st Term.
Nature and divisions of Law; Ethics; Common Law and Pleadings; Law
of Contracts as to Personal rights and obligations.
Second Term.
International and Municipal Law; Constitutional Jurisprudence of the
United States. Law of Contracts, as to Personal Property. Pleading and
Practice.
Third Term.
Political Economy; Law of Evidence; Criminal Law; Pleading and
Practice.
Fourth Term.
Law of Real Property ; Equity Jurisprudence and Procedure. A gen-
eral review.
The hours for classes are, on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays,
from 10 to 12 a. m., and from 2% to 3% p. m.; on Saturdays from 10 to 12 a. m.
Besides the ordinary prizes granted in the different classes, at the end of
each collegiate year there will also be two grand prizes, of $50.00 and $40.00
each, awarded respectively (subject to the rules and regulations of the Univer-
sity), to the best and second best treatise or discourse, as the case may be,
written by students of the graduating class, on some subject chosen by the
Faculty, and which will be submitted in due time and form.
Students attending the Law Course will have the privilege of consulting
the library, but each one is requested to furnish himself with the leading text-
books which are generally used. All the works need not be procured at once,
but the student can supply himself with those of more immediate application,
as indicated by his Professor, from time to time, in the progress of the course.
Among the text-books principally recommended are, Kent’s Commentaries;
Parsons on Contracts; Colyer on Partnership; Edwards on Bills of Exchange
and Promissory Notes; Angell & Ames on Corporations ; Bishop on Criminal
Procedure; Chitty, and Stephen on Pleading; Washburn on Real Property;
Greenleaf on Evidence; Burrill’s Law Dictionary; Story on Constitutional
Law; Story’s Equity Jurisprudence, and others which can be obtained as
needed. The usefulness of these works wrill not cease with the student’s
careeer, but, as they are standard authorities on most of the subjects of which
they treat, they will continue to be of service in subsequent practice. Hence
the desirability of acquiring them as early as possible.
The authorities of the University have determined to spare nothing that
can be done by them to place the Law Department on a first-class footing;
and have in contemplation, as soon as circumstances will permit, the erection
of a separate building for the use of students pursuing this Course. '
The students will be expected to conform to the rules of the University.
Further information may be obtained by addressing Rev. W. Corby, S. S. C.,
President of the University.

S9TBE OE COMMENCEMENT.
[From the Musical Independent, Chicago.]
We had the pleasure of a somewhat hurried visit to the University of
Notre Dame (South Bend) on the occasion of the Annual Exhibition, June 32,
The exercises consisted of Greek, Latin and English addresses, several pieces
by the Notre Baine University Brass Band, two overtures (“William Tell”
and “ Tancredi” by the orchestra), two dramatic performances by the Thespian
Society (the tragedy of “ William Tell ” and the comedy “ The Benefit of Hang-
ing”, and a repetition of the late Mr. Girac’s cantata composed for the Silver
Jubilee of Notre Dame University which occurred last year.
The cantata occupies about twenty minutes and contains two or three very
clever choruses and recitatives. *	*	*	*	* The orchestral
score was imperfectly represented in the absence of trombones, French horns,
kettle drums, without which a modern orchestra is scarce half made up. The
choruses were taken by the choir of about thirty (the sopranos being, of course,
boys) and gave admirable evidence of the thorough drill they have been sub-
jected to by the very capable instructor of singing, Prof. M. T. Corby. The
orchestra was too small to do much with the somewhat formidable overture to
“ William Tell,” especially as one of the two first violins was compelled to act
I as conductor much of the time. Still it is no small achievement to have an
orchestra at all, and we have no doubt that year by year the standard of exe-
cution will be elevated as the resources multiply, until grand symphonies by
the old masters will ring through the classic groves of Notre Dame. The prim
cipal first violin, Prof. Muhlberger, S. S. C., is a great enthusiast, and possesses
choice violins, one of which is a genuine Amati. The Brass Band played excel-
lently, and the dramas were very well put upon the stage and carried through
with spirit. We also took a look at the spacious and elegant buildings, saw
the big bell (the largest in America) which weighs fourteen thousand pounds,
takes four men to ring, has been heard a distance of sixty miles, they say, and
vibrates like the peal of an organ full five minutes after it has been struck;
saw also the library, the beautiful grounds, and sampeled the eatables.
On Wednesday, the 22d inst, the exercises opened with a grand entrance
march, finely rendered by the university band, after which followed an address
from the law department, by J. A. O’Reilly; the poem of the alumni, a grace-
ful, well-timed effort, by Prof. A. J. Stace, and a duet from Mendelssohn, by
Messrs. Riopelle and Mulhall. After the overture, “William Tell,” rendered
by the orchestra, came the dramatic success of the morning, “ The Upstart,”
63	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
presented by the young gentlemen of the St. Cecilia Society, of the Junior De-
partment. Following the dramatic entertainment came an address, “Home,
Sweet Home,” by W. B. Clarke; the Solo, “Saint a la France,” exquisitely
rendered by Prof. M. T. Corby; the oration of the alumni, by Prof. Paul Broder,
(a very fine address, but curtailed by the Professor in kindness to the over-
heated audience); the valedictory address, by A. W. Arrington, of Chicago.
Bishop Borgess, of Detroit, then addressed the students, briefly compliment-
ing them on the pleasing entertainment, and on their evident progress during
the past year ; after which, President Corby, in a few well chosen remarks,
hade them adieu until next year, and the large audience dispersed, to partake
of the plentiful banquet set out in the large dining-hall, and then, after a good-
by view of Notre Dame, to depart to their several homes. But we perceived
the University has but one drawback—no women disturb the classic retreat 1
A perfect paradise of bachelors—some of “ arts ” and all of nature !
“NOTRE	SCHOEA.STIC.”
This is the title of a neat little paper, published semi-monthly at the
University of Notre Dame. The chief object of this paper is to keep the parents
and friends of our students informed on the various subjects of study and dis-
cipline, as practiced at this University and at St. Mary’s Academy, and of the
progress and standing of their sons and daughters in these two Institutions.
For this purpose regular weekly reports are given, consisting of the names of
those who deserve by their good deportment to sit at the Tables of Honor, and
who by their perseverance and industry deserve special commendation from
their various professors and teachers. Other reports relative to the arrange-
ment of Classes, the promotion of the more talented and energetic students, etc.,
also find place in this paper, and keep parents and friends accurately informed
on all that concerns their children.
This paper also opens a field for aspiring young writers, wflio might other-
wise, through timidity allow their talents in this-respect to remain inactive;
while many articles of an instructive and literary character, from writers o
mature mind and ability, render the Scholastic a valuable publication for all
who desire variety and utility in their reading. Our little College paper at
present consists of eight large three-column pages, and as soon as a sufficient
patronage will justify its conductors to do so, it will be increased in size, and
thus rendered still more useful and interesting.
Terms : By mail, for one scholastic year (10 months'), $2 00.
To students residing at the College or Academy, one year, special terms.

of the University. We are, however, convinced, that many of our friends
would be pleased to have the privilege of endowing one or more of these.
Medals which would bear the name of the donor. Let, for example, $500 be
deposited, the interest of which would purchase one of the Gold Medals given
for first honors and would perpetuate the name of the donor, as a friend of
Education and a benefactor of the Institution. This is no new custom, but one
well known even in our American Colleges and Universities. In like manner
Professorships could be endowed, providing a salary of from $800 to $1500 per
annum. Colleges and Universities which are endowed by State or otherwise,
do not feel these wants, but a University like this, which has no endowments
whatever, must appeal to its friends for help, which no doubt will be promptly
rendered.

ANATOMY .A.:?™ MATEBIA MEDICA.
Young men desiring to study for the Medical profession will find oppor-
tunities to do so at Notre Dame. Yet, owing to the want of a sufficient museum
whereby this important branch could be thoroughly illustrated, the course of
studies in this department embraces principally Anatomy. The remainder of
the course is completed in so ne of our neighboring Universities. As a prepara-
tory course, that which is given here under Rev. L. Neyron, M. D., leaves noth-
ing to be desired.

MUSEUM.
The Museum has received valuable donations during the past year. A
collection of Minerals, procured especially for it, was seat as a present by
E. Teats, Esq., Colorado. Specimens of Geology were also donated by Mr. T-
Ewing, of Lancaster,. Ohio.
The Zoological collection is receiving yearly new additions through the
indefatigable energy of the Curator.
The Botanical collection is quite rich in foreign and native specimens.
The Herbarium of Thomas Gauvin, ex-President of the European Scientific
Congress, contains 4000 specimens.
COWSERVA-TOSY OE
The scholastic year 1869-70 numbers among its chief features the establish-
ment of the Conservatory of Music, wherein are received young men whose
proficiency in Instrumental Music is of a superior order. The Department of
Music at Notre Dame lacks nothing that can recommend it to the students. The
Faculty of Music is composed of first class Professors.
ASTRONOMICAL OBSSBVATORV.
A temporary Astronomical Observatory was erected during the course of
the past year, and the fine instrument presented by the Emperor Napoleon
located therein. The studies of the Class of Astronomy are now rendered
practically interesting.
FINE ARTS.
Drawing and Painting have been always favorite studies at Notre Dame,
and improvements will be made to render these studies more attractive during
the coming year. Casts, busts, and valuable paintings will be procured for the use
of the Drawing Class, directed by Prof. C. A. B. Von Weller and Bro. Albert.
LIBRARIES.
The Libraries contain some eleven thousand volumes, very carefully ar-
ranged by the Librarian, Rev. J. C. Carrier. Donations of books, especially
to the Law Library, will be thankfully received.

Of IIIS Institution, situated on the beautiful and picturesque banks of the
St. Joseph River, is everything that could be desired as a locality for a
Female Academy. All the branches of a solid and complete Education are
taught here. Music especially, both Vocal and Instrumental, and the Modern
Languages, form prominent features in the Course of Instruction.
Although particular attention is paid to the Religious Instruction of Cath-
olic pupils, yet pupils of all denominations are received, and, for the sake of
order, merely required to attend the public religious exercises with the mem-
bers of the Institution.
The Buildings are spacious and commodious, suited to the Educational
requirements of tlie day, and furnished with all Modern Improvemets. Every
portion of the building is heated by steam, and hot and cold baths are attached
to the sleeping apartments.
The Grounds are very extensive, beautifully adorned, and situated in that
charming seclusion which is so favorable to the healthful development of
moral, physical and intellectual powers.
The proximity of the two Institutions to each other is a great convenience
to parents having children at both, when they visit their sons and daughters.
