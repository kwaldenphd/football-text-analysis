The University of Notre Dame issues this, its fifteenth
annual Catalogue, under circumstances cheering and encour-
aging, beyond those of any previous year of its existence.
The course of study has been methodized anew, has
been greatly enlarged, and is, it is believed, rendered
fully adequate to the demands of the advancing culture of
the North-west; the corps of Professors and Tutors was
never before so numerous and efficient; to which may he
joined the scarcely less important consideration that each
succeeding year has witnessed large and expensive addi"
tions to the material facilities for imparting a thorough and
complete education.
The Literary Department, the only one as yet fully or-
ganized, is divided into a Preparatory School, in which is
given rudimental instruction up to the point where the
Student may profitably enter upon the course of an under
graduate; and a College proper where the full curriculum
of liberal studies requisite for graduation is pursued.
In the Preparatory Department, and in the lower Col-
lege classes, the usual catechetical or tutorial method of
teaching is adopted, the efficiency of which is largely pro-
moted by the systematic use of the blackboard in the reci-
6

tation room. In this stage of his education the utmost
pains is taken to ground the pupil thoroughly in principles,
to create and encourage a habit of self-reliant thought, and
to cater as little as possible for merely passive mind. In
the higher classes, as far as may be done with advantage
to the Student, the text-book is replaced by the Professor’s
own oral instructions. Already have been instituted
courses of lectures on Constitutional Law, on Logic, and
a course introductory to the study of metaphysics, on Eng-
lish Literature, and on Eloquence, in addition to those
occasional lectures which, from time to time during the
progress of the year, Professors find it necessary to give in
the several departments. ‘ The advocates of an education
more Christian than has hitherto prevailed in countries not
exclusively Catholic, will learn with pleasure that a course
of reading in Latin and Greek Patristic literature and elo-
quence, in the noble lyrics and hymnology of the Church,
and in Christian poetry generally, from Prudentius on-
wards, has been introduced among the studies of the two
last years.
The degree of A. B. will be conferred on such as shall
have completed in this institution the course of study pre-
scribed by the statutes, or, coming from other institutions
at least by the commencement of the senior year, shall on
examination be found prepared for the class to which they
apply for admission.
The degree of A. M. will be conferred on such of the
graduates in the first degree as shall, after leaving College,
have devoted full three years to professional, literary or
philosophical studies, and shall present to the faculty a the-
sis, or deliver an oration, on some subject relating to their
respective liberal pursuits.
NOTRE DAME UNIVERSITY.	7
Students who do not desire to graduate, may adopt a
partial or irregular course, fitting them for commercial life,
for civil engineering, &c., or for any pursuit outside of the
learned professions, which requires a special training.
Such a course would run parallel with the regular course,
and would include all the advantages, literary and other-
wise, which the institution offers to its inmates in common.
Special facilities exist at Notre Dame for the acquire-
ment of the French and German languages. Not only are
these languages taught very carefully by persons of ac-
knowledged competency, but many of the members of the
institution being natives of France and Germany, opportu-
nities at all times occur for conversation in these tongues.
There are in the College various societies of students,
formed for different objects—the St. Aloysius, a Literary
Society; St. Cmcilia, a Musical Association; the Confra-
ternity of the Nocturnal Adoration, the Arch-Confraterni-
ty, the Holy Angels’, and the Association for the Propaga-
tion of the Faith. There is also a Military Company com- -
posed of the larger students, who have regular parades,
the arms and accoutrements being furnished by the State.
The disciplinary government is mild, yet sufficiently en-
ergetic to preserve the most perfect order and regularity.
The morals and general deportment of pupils are assidm ’
ously watched over, and their comfort and personal habits
receive the same attention as if they were in the bosom of
their own families. Only conciliatory means of correction
are used, but if the student proves insensible to these, he
is promptly dismissed from the College.
Parents may rest assured that the utmost care will be
taken that their children comply regularly with their reli-
gious duties, and that no efforts will be spared in instruc-

ting them fully in the principles and obligations of their
holy religion.
Location.—The University of Notre Dame is situated
in the lovely valley of the St. Joseph, close by the banks
of that storied river of the North-west. It is in the midst
of a fine and proverbially healthy farming region, and by
means of two great trunk lines of railroad, one of them
passing within a mile of the College grounds, easily and
quickly accessible from every part of the country. At the
depot at South Bend omnibuses or private conveyances can
be obtained; and in the town itself there is a spacious and
delightfully ventilated hotel, where every comfort may be
enjoyed.
Among the peculiar advantages which Notre Dame pre-
sents, as a place of Education, may be noticed,
1.—Its Betieed Location.—At a time when solid stu-
dies are rare, when dissipations of every kind are thrown
in the way of the young student, and when morals are but
slightly watched over, it seems that every parent who de-
sires to secure to his son an opportunity of spending the few
years of his education usefully and profitably, and passing
safely the dangerous season of early youth, removed from
all the temptations of our large cities, should readily com-
prehend the advantage of placing him in such an Institu-
tion as Notre Dame. Here, the young student is under the
most watchful and paternal care—here he can apply him-
self, undisturbed, to his studies, under competent Profess-
ors—and, on moderate terms, he may acquire a solid knowl-
edge of everything to which he may wish to devote his at-
tention—here, also, his young mind breathes an atmosphere
of piety, the influences of which will hover around him
throughout his life.

:	2.—Its Northern and Healthy Site.—This is a point
especially worthy the consideration of Southerners—the
;	change of air and location having a natural tendency to
t	produce the most salutary effects on the constitutions of
i the natives of the Southern States.
:	3.—The Extensive Grounds oe the Institution.—If
I Students are here deprived of hurtful pleasures and dissi-
?
i	pations, they are amply remunerated by those delightful
।	and innocent amusements which the nature of the locality
:	so abundantly provides. The extensive forests surround-
,	ing the College give the best opportunities for hunting to
!	those who are fond of that sport; whilst the beautiful
,	Lakes, upon whose banks the University stands, afford
I
choice fishing grounds in summer, and almost uninterrupted
! skating during whiter.	'
i	4.—Care in Sickness.—Students, when ill, have not to
1 remain in the College rooms, but are transferred to the airv
and pleasant apartments of the Infirmary, where they are
attended by the visiting physician, and nursed with devo
ted care by experienced Sisters, who never suffer them to
be alone, but strive to supply the place of their absent
mothers.

About one mile west of the College, is beautifully located
on the banks of the river St. Joseph, and is everything that
could be desired as a locality for a Female Academy. It
is under the charge of the “ Sisters of the Holy Cross.”
All the branches taught in the best Female Institutions in
the country are taught here. The buildings are extensive,
land additions and improvements are daily progressing.
For further particulars concerning this Institution and its
various Departments, the public are referred to the Cata-
logue of the “Sisters of the Holy Cross,” of 1858-9.
