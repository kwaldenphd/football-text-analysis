HISTORICAL.
Iii building the University of Notre Dame, the founders
sought to make it a home from which the benefits of
Christian education might be spread to the youth of the
land. Realizing, however, that, to enter the university
proper, a certain standard of excellence must first be*reached,
it was decided that such a degree of excellence as was
required could be attained better here if a preparatory
school were maintained in connection with the university.
It has been found that, when students came here after
completing their preparatory course in High schools or in
academies, they would’ be qualified thoroughly enough in
- some studies, whereas in others they were rather deficient.
Thus a student that might enter as a Freshman in some
studies, might be two or three years behind in others, and
he 'would be held back to make these up. - But by making
the initial and.preparatory courses at an institution in which
the student can follow along to graduation in one of the
collegiate courses much time and trouble is saved and a
pupil will have a better foundation for his work. Since the
opening of the University therefore, it has been free to *
students desiring preparatory education as well as to those,
that desire to pursue more advanced studies. From, this
combined preparatory and academic school grew the sep- ■
arate schools, and eventually St. Edward's Hall was erected
as the junior part of the preparatory department of the
University. During the first years of its existence the
school was in the charge of lay teachers; but in 1863 the
Very Rev. Father Sorin, who during his lifetime took
great pride in this department, decided that it would be

more advantageous to have the pupils in the charge of
Sisters. Accordingly Mother M. Angela, the famous
foundress of the Order of the Sisters of the Holy Cross
in America, was entrusted with the organization of the
school as we have it to-day.
ST. EDWARD’S HALL.
St. Edward’s Hall is the preparatory department of
the University of Notre Dame. To this school, established
for the special care and training of boys under thirteen years,
the most scrupulous attention has always been paid by the
President of the Universitv. It is also known as the Minim
Department.
Thorough and comprehensive instruction in all the ele-
mentary branches of an English education is here imparted,
together with a rudimentary knowledge of Latin, French,
Spanish and German. Vocal Music, Elocution, Military
Drill, Physical Culture and Drawing involve no extra
charge. The pupils of this department are taught by the
Sisters of the Holy Cross, who are noted for their efficien-
cy as teachers. Some special studies, such as Elocution,
Physical Culture, Military Drill, Gymnastics and Debating,
are taught by regular professors of the University.
The boys are always under supervision. From the day
of their entrance they are made to feel' that they are not
strangers, but .the children of the house. Three Brothers
of the Holy Cross preside in the sleeping apartments,
gymnasium and natatorium; accompany them on their
walks; and, in general, see to them during the recreation
hours. The presence, however, of the Brothers is far from
being a restraint on the amusement of the boys; for while it
is the duty of the prefects to insist that their young charges
shall always keep within the limits of the strictest propriety,
8

they, at the same time, take part in all sports, organize
games, and do everything in their power to foster the love
of healthful exercise.
St. Edward's Hall is unique in the completeness of its
equipments. It affords the pupils the rare advantages of
the University and the tender care of the Sisters. The
fact that the boys come from the best families, and from
all over the country, and that among them are the sons of
’ former Minims, is sufficient evidence of the advantages
afforded by St. Edward’s Hall.
The Scholastic Year begins the first week in Septem-
ber and closes about the twentieth of June. Students are
received at any time during the year, and the expenses
for board and tuition commence with the date of their
entrance.

ST. EDWARD’S HALL.
DESCRIPTION.
St. Edward’s Hall is located in the north-east corner
of the University group of buildings, a little to the north
of the Academy of Music and east of the Main Building.
It is a large, four story, brick building, one-hundred-and-fifty
feet long and sixty-five feet wide. In the Chapel, the corri-
dors and the parlor are paintings by the celebrated Signor
Gregori. The various rooms in St. Edward’s Hall are large,
well lighted and well ventilated. The ceilings are sixteen
feet high. The building is heated throughout by steam,
lighted by electricity supplied with hot and cold water. No
fire is used in any part of the building. Bath rooms are
connected with the sleeping apartments. The equipment
is, in every respect, as thorough and as up-to-date as careful-
ness and a generous expenditure of money can make it.
One of the things that most readily appears to the eye of an
observer is the order and scrupulous cleanliness that is to
be noticed on all sides. Even in the play rooms, where it
might be expected that young boys might leave things in
a careless condition, everything is as neat and orderly as
one would find it in a well conducted home.
On the east end of the building is an annex, two hun-
dred and fifty feet long, which does not show in the cut of
the hall. It is divided into a library, game rooms, play hall,
gymnasium, athletic club rooms, clothes rooms, etc. Thus
it may be seen that the facilities offered to the young boys
for spending recreation hours in a manner most suitable to
their age and tastes are as complete as possible.

Fronting the buildings is St. Edward’s Park, which,
with its rare trees, plants and gorgeous flower beds, is con-
sidered the most beautiful portion of the University grounds,
which have attracted attention as the grandest college
grounds in the country. The cut gives but a small corner
of St. Edward’s Park, as it has been impossible for us to
get a photograph of the whole grounds. The hall, with its
annex, has a frontage on this park of four hundred feet.

EDUCATION.
The education imparted in St. Edward's Hall is prac-
tical and thorough. It combines the advantages of old
methods, which long experience has proved to be bene-
ficial, with the best that modern notions of education sug-
gest. It is intended to train the heart as well as the mind,
to form young gentlemen, who will be an honor to their
parents and to society. Every attention is given to the
moral culture of the students; and their general deport-
ment is equally the subject of unremitting care. Knowing
that the charm of refined manners is the aggregate of habits
acquired in youth, the teachers fail not, on all occasions, to
point out and take means to correct faults committed against
gentlemanty deportment. Instructions in politeness and
etiquette are given once a week.
St. Edward’s Hall welcomes to its advantages pupils
of every denomination; but anything like an attempt to
force the religious convictions of non-Catholics is carefully
avoided. For the sake of uniformity and the preservation
of discipline all the pupils are required, at stated times, to
attend divine services with the student-body in the College
Church. All, Catholics and non-Catholics, are taught to
appreciate moral worth. Surrounded as the students are
by all that tends to ennoble and elevate, it would seem
hardly possible that one should spend even a year at Notre
Dame without acquiring greater love and respect for all
that pertains to a nobler life.

ST. EDWARD’S HALL.
THE COURSES OF INSTRUCTION.
The courses of instruction in St. Edward’s Hall were
planned with a view to giving pupils a broad foundation
for commercial studies or for university education. They
include Christian Doctrine and Bible History, (for Catholic
students), Reading, Orthography, Geography, Arithmetic,
Grammar, Penmanship, United States History, Composi-
tion, Algebra, Elocution, Drawing, Music, Phonography,
Typewriting, Physical Culture, Military Drill, Latin, Greek,
German, French, Spanish and Spanish-English. On enter-
ing the student, the parents decide with the Prefect of
Studies the course the boy is to follow, and the studies are
taken up accordingly.
The students of the first-class complete the following
studies: Brook’s Normal Higher Arithmetic, Harvey’s
Grammar, Morton’s Advanced Geography, Beitzel’s Ad-
vanced Speller, McMaster’s History of the United States,
Reading, Penmanship, Latin, Algebra and Composition for
two sessions. So thoroughly do they master these studies
that it has been invariably found in the examinations held
at the end of the preparatory course to determine the eligi-
bility of students for entrance into the collegiate courses
that those boys who came from St. Edward’s Hall were
easily superior to the young men who had prepared them-
selves in other schools. Being thoroughly trained for every
line which they are to follow in the next years of their
college life, these ex-Minims take the lead at the entrance
examinations, hold it all through their course, and are fre-
quently the ones on whom class honors fall.
ST. EDWARD’S HALL.

THE COURSES IN MUSIC.
The department of Music is in the second story of the
building. It consists of a large room for vocal classes, and
a number of other rooms, each containing musical instru-
ments for lessons and daily practice.
Instructions on the piano, violin, mandolin, guitar,
flute, cornet and banjo are given by able teachers. Each
pupil devotes an hour daily to music, including a private
lesson of fifteen minutes. To secure that the pupils do not
waste their time, as they are apt to do when left to them-
selves, a Sister is on duty at all times to see that they prac-
tice faithfully. General vocal lessons are given once a week.
DEPARTMENT FOR LITTLE BOYS.
At the request of parents, who desire their children to
make their initial studies in St. Edward’s Hall and to
continue them at Notre Dame until completion, a separate
department has been opened for boys under seven years of
age. They have a special study hall, class rooms, sleeping
apartments, and dining room in which food, especially
prepared and suitable for them, is served. The hours for
sleep and study are arranged to suit their tender age. But
while their hours of study are few, it is remarkable how
rapidly these little boys progress. When they have com-
pleted their thirteenth year they are usually found to be as
far advanced in their studies as the ordinary boy of sixteen.

ST. EDWARD'S HALT.
SORIN CADETS.
The Sorin Cadets are divided into two companies under
the command of an ex-drill instructor of the United States
Army. The companies are armed with a light carbine rifle
weighing less than four pounds. These rifles and the other
equipment are kept in a room fitted up as an armory. The
drill, which is of a light nature, is practiced twice a week in
the large play hall; but in favorable weather it is conducted
outdoors. Great attention is paid at all times to the setting
up of boys. An upright and manly bearing is the result of
the drills which are, no doubt, beneficial to both mind and
body. Boys of the most efficient class, who show an apti-
tude to command, are selected and promoted to fill the dif-
ferent positions of non-commissioned officers. At the close
of the scholastic year a Gold Medal is awarded to the boy
who has the highest number of points to his credit for
proficiency and deportment.
DISCIPLINE.
Continued and varied experience in the care and
training of young boys has brought about the system of
discipline now enforced in St. Edward’s Hall. Certain
restrictions must necessarily be laid upon pupils of their
age, and rules of conduct must be formulated which they
must strictly obey. Yet every liberty that is compatible with
careful training, and every privilege conformable to their
proper development, is granted to the Minims. Those in

charge realize that childhood is the most impressionable
time of life, and that the effects of early training are lasting.
Therefore it is sought to influence the Minims by such
methods only as will develop in their youthful minds a love
for order and rightful conduct, a proper respect for parents
and superiors, and a taste for such habits as will bring
them honor in after life. Every care is taken to see that
they are kept from all that would in the least taint their
morals, and that they are taught to strive after such virtues
and manly habits as will make them estimable young men.
As in a well regulated home, recourse is had to kindness
rather than severity. The Sisters feel that they fill the
place of the absent mother. The discipline is thus more like
the regulation of an orderly home than like the strict man-
dates of a boarding school. To keep the pupils impressed
with the love and respect which they owe their parents,
they are required to write to them at least once a week.
As an incentive to keeping the rules, an honor system
has been established. At a conspicuous place in the hall a
Tablet of Honor is placed, on which are inscribed the
names of those whose conduct has been conformable to
all regulations and whose work has been satisfactory to
their teachers. There is great rivalry among the boys to
have their names appear on this Tablet. A gold medal is
also awarded at the end of two full years to those whose
deportment has been exceptionably good. As this fact is
made known to the Minim immediately after his entrance,
he generally endeavors to shape his conduct with a view
to receiving an Honor. It has been found that such in-
centives as these have been far more effectual toward the
development of character than would be corporal punish-
ment. This latter method finds no place in St. Edward’s
Hall, for seldom, if ever, is it employed.
ST. EDWARD’S HALL.
21
The Minims are kept within the line of duty by a
sense of honor and justice rather than by fear of punish-
ment. Among the many means of promoting emulation,
are Weekly Notes, Reports published in the Scholastic, Bi-
Monthly Bulletins, Annual Distribution of Premiums and
Gold Medals for excellence in studies.
The President of the University frequently visits St.
Edward's Hall; and once a month he examines all the
classes to ascertain the progress the pupils are making in
the different studies.
The order of the day in St. Edward’s Hall is as follows:
Rising at six-forty a. m., toilet, etc.; breakfast at seven,
after which a short time is allowed for recreation and exer-
cise; at half past seven studies and classes are begun and
continued without intermission until half past nine; from
half past nine until ten recreation is given and a luncheon
is served. At ten classes are again taken up and followed
until eleven forty-five; eleven forty-five, toilet; twelve, din-
ner, followed by recreation; from one until three, study and
class; three, recreation and luncheon; half past four until
half past six, study and classes; half past.six, supper fol-
lowed by recreation; eight o’clock, retiring.
From this it may be seen that the work has been ar-
ranged as judiciously as possible toward furthering mental
and physical development at the same time. The pupils are
never at work more than two hours at a time. This gives
them ample opportunity to take such recreation as boys of
their age require, and perhaps to this is due the fact that
they are so healthy and happy. The recreation and exercise
in the fresh air after each two hours of study unbind the
mind and prepare the boys to return to their work with a
freshness and vigor that does very much toward their
progress.

ST. EDWARD'S HALL
SOCIETIES.
There are two societies in the Minim department, that
of the Guardian Angels of the Sanctuary, which has for its
object to supply servers for the Church services, and the
Sorin Association which has been established with a view
to give the pupils a start in elocution and debating as early
as possible. This society is presided over by one of the
professors who finds it a pleasant duty to train these in-
teresting young speakers. Meetings are-held once a week
after school hours. These meetings are a source of pleasure
as Well as of profit to the young enthusiasts. Not infre-
quently are they honored at these'meetings by the presence
of some of the University officials who take pleasure in at-
tending, to encourage them and watch the development they
are making. The members prepare original compositions,
deliver declamations, are trained to debate,, etc. As a further
encouragement for this young literary society a gold medal
is annually awarded at commencement time to the one who
has done the best work, and who shows his merit in open
contest. This society has the honor of furnishing the
representative who delivers the greetings from St. Edward’s
Hall to the President of the University on President’s day.

THE CHAPEL.
The Chapel, with its beautiful altars, rare statues, im-
ported stained glass windows, pipe organ and rich paintings
from the brush of Signor Gregori, is a gem of art. The
students assemble for a few minutes, morning and evening,
in this chapel for their prayers.

THE MAIN STUDY HALL.
The main Study Hall for the more advanced pupils
in St. Edward’s is located on the second floor in the center
of the building. It is a large room, well lighted and well
ventilated, commanding a charming view from each of its
many large windows. The hall presents quite an artistic
appearance, being tastefully decorated with beautiful
statuary, rare pictures, potted plants, etc. • Besides the
pleasure the students derive from studying in this bright,
beautiful hall, their tastes are cultivated by coming in con-
tact with objects so refining.

Here the Sorin Association holds its meetings. It con-
tains a beautiful Everett Piano, and all the furniture
necessary to make of it a convenient and comfortable place
for society meetings. In one end is a platform which
serves the purpose of a stage. Back of this is a large
frescoe by Gregori. It is an historical picture showing the
founding of the University of Notre Dame.

THE REFECTORY.
The majority of the Minims take their meals with the
Carroll Hall students in the latter’s dining room. But the
younger boys and those whose health requires a special
regimen, have separate dining rooms in which food suitable
to their individual tastes is served.

THE CLOTHES ROOM.
The clothes room is an important apartment in
St. Edward’s Hall. In this each pupil has his wardrobe.
Sisters are constantly in charge. They attend to the mend-
ing, etc., see to the personal neatness of the boys, take charge
of the trunks on the arrival of the pupil, mark and take an
inventory of the clothing, etc., which they place in the
lockers assigned to him. The boys have free access to the
clothes room at all hours; and they receive from the Sisters
the clothing they may need from time to time. Clothing
is changed to suit the seasons, and it is the duty of one of
the prefects to see that the boys follow this rule. Often
when the temperature suddenly changes in one day, they
' may be made to change heavy clothes for light, or light for
heavy clothes. Underwear is changed once a week.
32
ST. EDWARD’S HALL.
THE LAVATORIES
are supplied with hot and cold water, located on the lower
floor near the clothes room so that they can be conveniently
reached at all times either from the campus, from the
clothes rooms, or from the athletic dressing rooms. The
Minims are obliged to make their toilet here before every
meal, and Sisters are present to assist and to see that it is
properly done. All are required to brush their teeth care-
fully. Baths are taken once a week or oftener as parents
may direct.

33
THE DORMITORIES.
The sleeping apartments are all commodious and well
ventilated. Each one is presided over by a Brother. The
most noticeable thing in connection with these dormitories
is the immaculate cleanliness that prevails all through. The
beds have springs with the ordinary mattress, and over this
is placed a hair mattress. Bedding is provided in abun-
dance during cold weather. There is nothing lacking to
keep the boys comfortable. Bath rooms with hot and cold
water are connected with the sleeping apartments.
34
ST. EDWARD’S HALL.
THE INFIRMARY.
So seldom is it that any of the boys of St. Edward’s
Hall is sick that no special infirmary has been found nec-
essary for them. When occasionally it happens that one
of them is indisposed he is put in charge of the Sisters at
the University Infirmary and is visited, if necessary, by the
house physician. In case of sickness the boy’s parents are
immediately notified.
Since the health of the students is of primary import-
ance, the sanitary regulations enforced are of the most
practical nature. Special attention is given to the choice
and to the preparation of food, to the hours for rising and
retiring, to meals, study, recreation, to the rules affecting-
personal regimen, etc. The pure air, the regular life, perfect
open plumbing, the extensive grounds, which afford abun-
dant opportunities for exercise,—all contribute to the
proverbial good health of the Minims.
The Different Apartments in the Annex to
St. Edward’s Hall.
The principal object the authorities had in adding this
annex was to furnish places where the Minims could spend
their recreation hours when the weather is too inclement to
permit them to be outdoors. On this account much atten-
tion was given to the furnishing of the
ST. edwaed's hall.
35
GYMNASIUM,
a room forty-eight feet long and twenty-eight feet wide,
thoroughly equipped with every apparatus which might be
used to advantage by the Minims. In it are to be found
running ladders, rings, punching bags, horizontal and
parallel bars, turning poles, climbing poles and ladders,
Swiss ladders, dumb-bells, clubs, weights, springboards,
mats, horses, pyramid frames, etc. This apartment is now
used merely as a practice room since the building of the
large University gymnasium, as the boys go there for
gymnastic instruction. Next in importance to the gymna-
sium is the

PLAY HALL,
a large room one hundred and ten feet long and thirty feet
wide. Here all such games as basket ball, indoor base ball,
hand ball, etc., are played, and here, in fact, is where the
the Minims spend many happy hours when the weather is
too severe for outdoor sports. The hall is also used as a
drill room for the Sorin Cadets. The
READING ROOM
is thirty feet long and twenty feet wide. This, like the game
room, is tastefully decorated with potted plants and pictures.
It contains a library of many hundred volumes, especially
suited to the age of the pupils. The books include the best
authors in travel, history, biography, poetry and fiction; as
well as bound encyclopedias, magazines, papers received
from home, etc. The Reading Room is accessible at all
recreation hours. The

everything in the line of games. As the boys have free
access to these four rooms during recreation they have ample
opportunities of satisfying their individual tastes.

in this room.

THE MINIMS’ CAMPUS.
The campus, which is set aside for the exclusive use of
the Minims, is a level eight acre field, and is directly north
of their play hall. It is located on the brow of St. Joseph’s
lake, thus commanding one of the best views of the many
splendid scenes at Notre Dame. This field is a place of
great activity during- those seasons in which outdoor games
may be played. There are several base ball diamonds on
which, during the warm weather in spring and summer,
organized teams battle for championship honors in the
national game and for the medals awarded to the champion
nine.
40
ST. EDWARD’S HALL.
Then there are four gridirons where enthusiastic foot'
ball players develop their muscles in the great college game.
Encircling the field is a track where the track athletes and
bicycle riders do their work. The campus is also well sup-
plied with swings, May-poles, turning poles, a tennis court,
a large toboggan slide for the winter, and many other
apparatus with which the Minims may spend their recrea-
tion hours in an enjoyable manner. That they take advant-
age of the opportunities afforded can readily be seen if one
makes a visit to their campus. Homesickness is almost
unknown among the boys. The new students become readily
acquainted with their class-mates and their surroundings,
and from the first join in the games and sports. They
realize that they are in a new world where they have more
freedom and enjoyment than they could possibly have at
home. Base ball suits, bats, balls, and masks are furnished
gratis.

ATHLETICS.
Young boys need a great amount of vigorous and
wholesome exercise when they are required to do much
mental work. Study is wearing enough on any person, but
for the youth, who does not directly see the benefit of it,
application to books is doubly tiresome. He measures great-
ness more by the standard of sports than by education and
culture. To satisfy his longings for games, his desire to
match his skill and strength with his fellows, he must be
given ample opportunity to engage in contests. Thus will
his mind be relieved of the strain that study would naturally
put upon it. It is evident that a suitable amount of play will
sharpen the. intellect and render its possessor much more
competent to work in a beneficial manner. Again play de-

velopes a strong constitution, physical strength, agility of
body and confidence in one’s own ability. This is particu-
larly true of young boys, who are so susceptible of training.
Bearing these facts in mind, the authorities of St. Edward’s
Hall have made every possible provision to give the boys
sufficient time for athletics. It must not be inferred, how-
ever, that they are permitted all play and no work. Only
during recreation times can there be any attention given to
the subject of games and athletics, and these are never
allowed to interfere in any way with class work. Every
game is encouraged at its proper time, but when the hour
for study comes all games must be stopped.
Base ball and football are the chief sports among the
Minims. In spring there are as many as eight different
nines competing, for the championship of the hall. The
rivalry among these various teams is very great. Toward

the close of the season the two teams with the best record
play a series of five games and to the winners of this series
go the honors. Each member of the team is presented with
a gold medal. In football the rivalry is equally as great,
except that the strongest team usually plays most of its
games with boys from Carroll Hall, and with junior teams
from South Bend.
The building in which the swimming pool is located
is a commodious one, ninety feet long, forty-five wide and
two stories in height. The pool itself is fifty-seven feet in
length, twenty-three feet in width, six and a half feet in
depth at one end, and gradually grades down to seven and a
half feet at the' other end. The water is lowered on days
reserved for the Minims. On the same floor as the swim-
ming pool are eighteen needle and shower baths, bath tubs,
and closets, all up-to-date. A student before using the
swimming pool must cleanse himself in one of these baths.
' In this way the sanitary condition of the pool is faultless.
The building is heated by steam, kept at 70 degrees Fahren-
heit, and lighted by electricity. A man is always in charge.
Boys who do not know how to swim are desirous to learn;
for here there can be no danger. They are taught by the
Brothers. And those who have that ability take advantage
of the pleasure. In this way the swimming pool is often
filled with a happy crowd of boys who swim and dive simply
for the pleasure it affords.
st. josepi-i’s lake.
In warm weather the Minims are allowed to go swim-
ming every day in St. Joseph’s lake. Of all sports
this is the one the young boys particularly enjoy. However,
they are never permitted to go unless in company with the
Brothers. There is absolutely no danger, and no accident
has ever occurred among the Minims. They cannot go
beyond certain posts, and care is taken that they do not
remain too long in the water. Any one affected by a cold or
who is otherwise indisposed is not permitted to swim in the
.. lake or in the natatoriuifl.

The Advantages of St. Edward’s Hall.
The advantages of having a separate department at the
University for boys under thirteen years of age are so many
and so evident that it would seem almost unnecessary to
mention them. In the first place, if parents are desirous
of having their sons sent away to school when they are
still of such tender age, they must fully realize that special
care and attention should be given to these young boys.
However, it would be a difficult matter to make special
provisions for them, unless they be kept alone and be under
the supervision of prefects and instructors that can devote
their whole time to caring particularly for them. It would
be practically impossible to make any deviation from the
ordinary curriculum in order to benefit them if they were
permitted to be among the other boys; for the discrimina-
tions in any department, as among men in the world, always
work unsatisfactorily.
Again the intimate association of such young boys
with older ones does not always lead to the best results.
Whatever they notice in their elders they will strive to imi-
tate, but it too often happens that they notice only the
rougher side of their companions' actions. Boys under the
age of thirteen years, it must be remembered, can not be
expected to use very great discretion or judgment in shaping
their actions, and the evil influence of one thoughtless per-
son may leave a lasting impression on their youthful minds.

ST. EDWARD’S HALL.
Another advantage in having the Minims by themselves is
this: their studies, their manner of spending recreation and
their tastes in general are very different from those
of the more advanced boys. They can do better in class-
work if they follow such lines as are specially planned
for them, and they will enjoy their games much better if
they are where they can play them without interference
from older boys. Life in St. Edward’s Hall is thus made
more home-like for them since the rules and regulations
are especially suited to their best interests. There are a
hundred and one little things that go to make up their
comfort and happiness, that could not be taken into account
if they were not in a separate department. They enjoy not
only the special privileges of their own hall but also those
of the older students—public lectures, concerts, games, etc.
The Minims are made to feel that they are the privileged
ones at Notre Dame. As has been already stated the Sisters
of the Holy Cross are in charge of St. Edward’s Hall. They
give the most scrupulous attention to the needs and com-
forts of the pupils in all that pertains to studies, health and
personal neatness. None better than they know how to take
the place of the absent mother in the training, the progress
and the happiness of those under their care.
When placing their sons at Notre Dame, parents find
great satisfaction in seeing that, if they have made a sacri-
fice in depriving themselves of their children’s company,
they are leaving them in a beautiful home surrounded by
every care and comfort, and, at the same time, affording
them an opportunity of laying a deep and solid foundation
for an education that will increase their usefulness and
happiness through life.

Notre Dame Scholastic.
Is the title of a neat 28-page paper, devoted to the
interests of the students, and published by them
at the University every week during Term time.
This journal opens a field for young writers who
might otherwise, for want of a proper medium,
allow their talents to remain inactive. It also
affords students an opportunity for practical exper-
ience in journalism. During seasons of special
interest at the University, The Scholastic is
published daily.
It will be the endeavor of the Editors during the
coming year to merit the encouragement given the
paper in the past, and the encomiums bestowed
■ upon it by the press in general.
The Scholastic will be sent to any address for
$1.50 per annum.
Address all communications to
The Notre Dame Scholastic,
Notre Dame, Indiana.

(One Mile West of the University of Notre Dame.)
Pupils who need primary education and those of tender
age, are here carefully prepared for the academic and
advanced courses. For the care and training of these
younger pupils there has been established a separate depart-
ment to which the most scrupulous attention has always been
paid by the Sisters in charge of the institution. Great care
is taken to see that these Minims have every privilege and
every comfort that is compatible with proper training.
