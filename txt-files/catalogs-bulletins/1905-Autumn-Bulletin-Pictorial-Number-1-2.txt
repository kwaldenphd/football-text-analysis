UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
The University of Notre Dame was founded in the
year 1842, by the Very Reverend Edward Sorin, the
late Superior General of the Congregation of Holy
Cross. In an act approved January 15, 1844, the Legis-
lature of Indiana gave the University power to grant
degrees. The beginning of this act is :
11 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State oj
Indiana, that Edward Frederick Sorin, Francis Lewis
Cointet, Theophilus Jerome Marivault, Francis Gouesse,
and their associates and successors in office, be, and are
hereby constituted and declared to be, a body corporate
and politic, by the name and style of the ‘ University of
Notre Dame du Lac,’ and by that name shall have
perpetual succession, with full power and authority to
confer and grant or cause to be conferred and granted,
such degrees and diplomas in the liberal arts and sciences,
and in law and medicine, as are usually conferred and
granted in other universities in the United States, pro-
vided, however, that no degree shall be conferred or
diplomas granted, except to students who have acquired
the same proficiency in the liberal arts and sciences, and
in law and medicine, as is customary in other uni-
sities in the United States.”

EQUIPMENT IN THE DEPARTMENTS OF BIOEOG Y,
GEOEOGY, AND MINERALOGY.
The Department of Biology, on the north side of the
second floor of Science Hall, consists of three large class-
rooms and laboratories properly ventilated and lighted.
There are also private laboratories set apart for post-
graduate students. All the class-rooms are furnished
with charts and models necessary in teaching the dif-
ferent courses. The arrangement of windows is such
that the rooms can be easily darkened so that a stere-
opticon and lantern slides on the subjects of Botany,
Zoology, and Physiology may be used.
The Laboratories are well equipped with compound
and dissecting microscopes, and in each room there is a
library of books pertaining to biological subjects. The
botanical laboratory contains twenty-four compound
microscopes and all the requisite accessories for work in
Vegetable Histology and Cryptogamic Botany. The gen-
eral laboratory of Microscopy, Histology and Embry-
ology is also supplied with compound microscopes and
the equipments indispensable in the courses mentioned
above.
The bacteriological laboratory is completely equipped
with compound, microscopes, incubators, sterilizers, and

THE MUSEUM .
connected with the departments described above, is well
arranged for convenience of study. The zoological col-
lection on the second floor at present fills sixteen large
cases and represents typical forms of all the orders and
genera of vertebrate and invertebrate animals. A large
collection of representative vertebrate skeletons has re-
cently been added to this part of the Museum.
The botanical collection, also on this floor, consists of
two complete Herbaria, one of the United States, the
other of Canada. There is also a second collection of
the woods and fruits of the United States, almost com-
plete.
The collections in Geology and Mineralogy occupy the
first floor. These collections are arranged in a series of
cases on each side of the building. In one series is a
carefully classified collection of minerals and ores. The
opposite series of cases contains a large geological col-
lection ; some of the specimens here are of the rarest
fossil remains of animal and plant life.
ENGINEERING HALL.
This building is situated directly south of Science Hall,
and is a large three-story brick building, well lighted and
heated. The two upper floors are given up to Chemistry
and Pharmacy. The general Inorganic, Organic and
Elementary Chemical laboratories are on the third floor,
while the second floor is 'mostly taken up with pharmaceu-
tical laboratories, a well equipped drug store, a lecture
room and a general stock room. Each laboratory is pro-
vided with ample hood accommodations, and each desk
is furnished with water, gas and suction.

trate and teach the practical methods of engineering.
The instrumental outfit consists of one surveyor’s transit,
two engineer’s transits with levels and vertical circles
attached to telescopes, one engineer’s wye level, and a
plane table with all the attachments, clinometers, chains,
tapes, etc.
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT.
The wood shop, machine shop and blacksmith shop
are on the first floor. The wood shop is supplied with
modern work-benches fully equipped with the smaller
tools necessary for carpentry, twelve lathes for turning,
a jig saw, a revolving planer and a circular saw, the
whole forming an adequate equipment for a thorough
mastery of joinery, scroll wrork and pattern making.
The machine shop contains two horizontal slide valve
steam engines which are used for experimental purposes.
The power for operating the machine shop is derived
from the electric station of the University, two ten-horse
power motors being used for this purpose, from which
power is transmitted to the various machines by a line
of shafting running the entire length of the building.
The latest improved lathes have been provided, nine in
number, varying from a five inch swing in the smallest
to a large engine lathe with sixteen foot bed having a
capacity for work twenty-eight inches in diameter. Two
drill presses, a large planer, a shaping machine and a
Brown and Sharp milling machine complete the outfit,
thus making the machine shop a model of its kind. The

blacksmith shop has the usual complement for teach-
ing, forging, annealing, welding and tool making.
In the foundry work the student is instructed in the
proper disposition of gates and sprues, the mixing of
sand, setting up and drawing simple and complicated
patterns and core making. This is supplemented with
lectures on the proper mixing and heating of cast iron
for the various purposes for which it is used.
In addition to the facilities afforded by the shops, the
engineering students have access to the steam and power
plants of the University which have been recently
remodeled and made to compare favorably with the best
contemporary practice. The main steam plant contains
two batteries of ten horizontal tubular boilers, aggregat-
ing 1200 horse power. In connection with the boilers is
installed the necessary testing apparatus as follows : — a
Worthing hot water meter for measuring the amount
of feed water, a feed water thermometer, for getting
temperature of generated steam, a throttling calorimeter
for ascertaining the quality of steam and an automatic
recording pressure gauge giving a continuous record of
the boiler pressure. Provision is made for finding the
temperature and pressure of the flue gases by means of a
pyrometer and draught gauge and for obtaining samples
of flue gas for analysis. These, with a Carpenter coal
calorimeter for determining the heating value of the fuel,
comprise a full and complete equipment for giving the
student an intimate knowledge of the practical part of
boiler management and testing. A Webster feed water
heater and purifier, two compound duplex pumps, two
vacuum pumps working on the heating system, two large
Worthington fire pumps 16 by 9 by 12 with a capacity of
1500 gals, per minute, with numerous separators, steam
traps, automatic reducing valves, etc., complete the
apparatus in the main steam plant. A McEwen high

the use of students during illness. The sick are nursed
by Sisters of the Holy Cross, and the University physi-
cian visits them daily.
THE GYMNASIUM.
The gymnasium which was burnt down in November,
1900, was replaced by a building 230 by 200 feet in
dimensions. The track-hall is now 100 by 180 feet on
the ground : it is used for indoor meets, winter baseball
practice, basketball and military drill. The gymnastic
hall is 100 by 40 feet and is furnished with a full set of
new apparatus ; below that are the offices, dressing-rooms
and showerbaths. Friends of the University and the
alumni contributed more than $3,000 to the fund for
re-building.
The Cartier Field is an enclosed field for athletic
games. There is a permanent grand stand near the base-
ball diamond and the cinder track, and a portable stand
near the football rectangle. The field contains ten acres
of ground, and is a gift to the University from Mr.
Warren A. Cartier, C. B., of the class of ’8'7.

DISCIPLINE.
Official bi-monthly reports of’ each student’s class
standing will be sent to parents and guardians.
The Faculty maintains that an education which gives
little attention to the development of the moral part of a
youth’s character is pernicious, and that it is impossible
to bring about this development where students are
granted absolute relaxation from all Faculty government
while outside the class-room. A young man must learn
obedience to the law by the actual practice of obedience,
not by mere appeals to honor.
Moreover, the quiet and concentration of mind that are
needed for collegiate work are not obtained except where
discipline exists.
Therefore the following regulations, shown to be
salutary by experience, are enforced at the University:
1.	No student shall leave the University grounds
without permission from the President or the person
delegated to represent him.
2.	Leave of absence will not be granted to students dur-
ing the term time., except in cases of urgent necessity. There
is no vacation at Easter.
3.	Students are required to report at the University
immediately after arriving at South Bend. This rule is
binding not only at the beginning of the scholastic year,
but at all other times when leave of absence has been

UNDERGRADUATE COURSES.
To be given during the Year 1905-6.
The recent establishment of a four years’ Course in
Architecture at Notre Dame University, following the
opening of the School of Pharmacy, and the revision and
expansion of the entire system of studies several years
ago, offer an opportunity of acquainting the alumni and
friends of the institution, as well as the Catholic public
generally, with what has been and is being done at
Notre Dame toward meeting the increasing demands of
the age upon the college, and keeping pace with the
progress of American institutions o'f higher education
generally. The brief account of the collegiate system at
Notre Dame which follows is supplemented by an exhibit,
in tabular form, of the principal undergraduate curricula,
as offered for the coming scholastic year 1905-6.
THE ELECTIVE SYSTEM AT NOTRE DAME.
The entire system of studies at Notre Dame is based
upon the principle of election of studies. The student,
once he is admitted as a Freshman, is free to select his
own course of studies, conformably to his natural liking,
the career in life he may have in view, or the determinate
intellectual bent developed during the secondary school
years. The curriculum which is made up of the tradi-
tional “Classics” holds, of course, the place of honor;
but it is frankly recognized that there are other studies
which, while scarcely less efficient for cultural purposes
than the “Classics,” lie closer to the predominant
activities and utilities of modern life. Hence, side by
side with the “ Classics,” leading to the traditional A. B.
ST. JOSEPH’S NOVITIATE.
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.	51
degree, there are other cultural curricula, open to the
student’s choice and leading to equivalent degrees.
This has been the main principle of the collegiate
system at Notre Dame almost from the very beginning.
More than forty years ago, the principle of election of
studies was accepted as the guiding rule in shaping the
academic growth of the institution. This is shown by
the fact that at that early date a curriculum of General
Science studies was set up alongside the ‘ ‘ Classics ” as of
equivalent value for the work of college education.
Since that time, one curriculum after another has been
added, as the college has grown and the demand for a
wider range of election has made itself felt from the
student body, until to-day, it may be confidently asserted,
no other Cathode college or university in the country
offers so rich and varied a field of choice to the -under-
graduate student.
THE STUDENT ASSISTED IN SELECTING HIS
STUDIES.
While the student is free to elect the course of studies
he is to follow, he has not, however, unlimited freedom
in this respect. The principle of election is necessarily
conditioned, in its practical operation, by the canons of
sound educational experience. “It is a fact of general
experience,” says President Wilson, of Princeton, “that
the undergraduate -student is not likely to make a
systematic choice of studies unless aided by more mature
judgments than his own, and upon the assumption that
the knowledge of men more mature than himself is a
safer guide to a consistent and serviceable choice than
his own untested tastes and preferences.” The elective
system at Notre Dame is a system of “ assisted election.”
There is a set programme of studies which, while afford-
ing ample range of choice, is sufficiently fixed to shield
52
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
the student from the inconsiderate impulses of his own
unripened judgment.
THE GROUP SYSTEM.
The programme of studies at Notre Dame comprises a
number of parallel groupes of studies leading to equiva-
lent baccalaureate degrees. Broadly speaking, the groups
divide themselves naturally into two general classes : the
cultural, or those which aim simply at wide-ranging
mental power and development; and the technical, or
those which make a high degree of practical as well as
theoretical skill, along the line of some strictly scientific
profession, an essential aim. To the first class — the
“ cultural”—belong five groups of studies ; the Classics,
English, History and Economics, General Science, and
Biology. To the second class—the “ technical”—belong
five groups of studies also ; Pharmacy, Civil Engineering,
Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and
Architecture, with, in addition, a short two-year, techni-
cal course in Applied Electricity and in Mechanical
Engineering.
To get a clearer view of the principle at work, let us
now take the first of these two general divisions, and
consider the five groups which we have called the
‘c cultural ’ ’ a little more closely. Each group, as a rule,
is made up of three kinds of studies ; studies common to
all the groups, studies proper to each group, and studies
that are elective. Thus, in the five groups we are con-
sidering, there are three studies which are common to
all the groups, — Christian Doctrine, Philosophy, and
English. In other words, these three subjects are re-
garded as indispensably necessary in the work of liberal
education at Notre Dame, and they are the only subjects
which are so regarded.
Besides these three common subjects, there are studies

THE STUDIO

55
proper to the several groups. Bach group has some
studies which are peculiar to itself; and are determined
by the special quality of mental power it is aimed to
develop. In the Classical Group, for instance, the studies
■ proper are, Latin, Greek and History. In the General
Science Group, the studies proper are the natural and
physical sciences, with mathematics. In the English
Group, they are higher English, French and German.
Again, there is more or less opportunity of election
allowed within a Group. Thus, in the Classical Group,
one elective, of five hours a week, is allowed in each year
of the course, except the Senior year. In the General
Science Group, the work of the lunior year is largely
elective, and the work of the Senior year almost entirely
so. The student may, at any time, with the permission
of the faculty, substitute one study for another in a
Group.
By these means, it is believed, there is provided for in
the programme of studies sufficient flexibility to meet
the most varied demands in the way of cultural training
that may be legitimately made upon the college, and, at
the same time, to meet and give due recognition to the
work of the secondary schools in preparing pupils for
college,
o
ADMISSION OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES.
It is one of the great advantages of the elective system
that it enables the college to effect a connection between
its programme of studies and that of any good high
school or secondary school, however much the school
may be influenced, in the making up of its curriculum,
by local or particular academic needs, requirements, or
ideals. It brings the secondary school close to the college,
and makes it easy for the boy to pass from one to the
other, as easy, almost, as if the school were an integral
56	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
part of the college. The college, in effect, places all good
secondary schools on the same plane as its own pre-
paratory school, and is thus enabled to draw from them
all without any academic difficulty.
The graduates of any public or private high school of
good standing, therefore, will not find it difficult to gain
admission to the University of Notre Dame. They will
receive full credit for any work done in the school. In
some cases, certificates of graduation will be accepted in
lieu of the University’s Entrance Examination. Graduate
students of high schools that are fully accredited to the
State Universities, will be admitted without examination
to the Ereshman year of any Group of studies along the
line of their high school course. The wide range of
election allowed at Notre Dame makes it easy for the
graduate of a good school, whatever the studies he may
have followed, to qualify for Ereshman standing in some
one of the many Groups of studies open to his choice.
ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS.
The entrance requirements vary somewhat according
to the character of the curriculum that the student is to
follow. Thus, Greek is required from classical students
only. Students who are to take the course in English
or the course in History and Economics, may offer in
place of Greek a corresponding amount of Erench and
German. Eor admission to the Engineering courses, more
mathematics is required than admission to the other
curricula.
In general, it may be said that the entrance require-
ments of Notre Dame do not differ substantially from
those of other large colleges and universities in the
United States. These requirements are fairly enough
represented by the Regent’s Examinations in New York,
or the examinations which have been given for several

years by the College Entrance Examination Board, the
certificates of either of which will be accepted as the
equivalent of the Entrance requirements of the Uni-
versity.
TABULAR DESCRIPTION OF CURRICULA.
In the following pages, the Groups of Studies which
have been described above, are exhibited in tabular form,
in such a way as to show the degree to which each one
leads, the studies of each year and term, and the number
of class-hours devoted, a week, to each subject. The
character and relative advancement of the courses given
in the respective terms is also indicated by the Roman
numerals prefixed to these courses in the University
catalogue; and alongside of the Roman numerals, in the
tabular statement, there is given the catalogue page on
which a full and detailed description of the course may
be had. It is to be observed that the page reference is
to the General Catalogue, and not to this Pictorial Num-
ber. With the help of this tabular statement, there-
fore, it will be very easy, should further information be
desired, to follow the description of the courses in the
University catalogue.

NEEDS OF THE UNIVERSITY*
Visitors to Notre Dame judge from the appearance of
the buildings and grounds that the University has no
need of money. It is, nevertheless, absolutely without
endowment, and its work is seriously hampered because
it has no resources except the fees of students. There
are two scholarships and the interest from these founda-
tions is used in educating and boarding two students.
There were in 1901 1,452 Catholic students in 6 per
centum of the non-Catholic colleges of America, and
very many of these will lose their faith, and all will be
weakened in that faith, because our people look upon
collegiate institutions as the property of private cor-
porations which are to be left to take care of themselves.
Notre Dame asks for scholarships for boys that can
not pay the expense of education, and who ‘therefore are
obliged to go to non-Catholic colleges to the detriment of
their faith. A foundation of §8,000 will educate and
board a student as long as the University exits. As one
bursar is graduated another can take his place. The
founder of the scholarship, of course, always has the
privilege of appointing the student.
We lack money for a library building, and for two
more dwelling-halls like Sorin Hall.
Foundations for scholarships are also a pressing need.
There is no Library fund for the purchase of new
books.
The names of benefactors will be given to all
foundations.

The Notre Dame Scholastic
Is a 28-page paper devoted to the interests of the stu-
dents and published by them every week during term
time. The journal is in the hands of a student board of
editors and students do all the writing for it. Work
done for The Scholastic is regarded as supplementary to
the theoretical work of the English courses; hence the
character of the articles,—essays on literary subjects,
biographical sketches, short stories, exercises in verse,
book-reviews, etc. As contributors are expected to pre-
pare their own copy for the press and to do their own'
proof-reading, they gain no small amount of practical
experience.
Although The Scholastic is published chiefly for the
sake of the students attending the University, their
parents and all former students will see things of interest
in its columns. Reports of the popular lecture course and
of events happening at Notre Dame and other colleges,
personal notices, athlectic notes, reviews of the work ,
done in the debating and other classes, find place in the
paper and keep parents and others informed about -
matters that concern their children and friends.
The Scholastic will be sent to any address for $1.50 per
annum.
