Commencement Exercises
Commencement exercises of the students of St.
Edward’s Hall was held Saturday morning, June 13.
A word of special praise is due to the Sisters in charge
of St. Edward’s Hall for the excellent character of the
exercises and the beautiful appearance of the Hall.
Without, St. Edward’s Park was one of Notre Dame’s
choice beauty spots, and within the corridors, rooms,
and the large study-hall, where the exercises were held,
were tastefully and beautifully decorated with bunting
and flowers. The last impressions that departing
Minims carried away with them to their city homes
or far-away summer cottages were surely bright and
happy ones.
Added grace and importance were given to these •
closing exercises by the presence of Rev. Father
Cavanaugh, C. S. C., a goodly number of the faculty,
and the parents of the children.
Father Cavanaugh, after awarding the prize medals,
premiums and certificates, addressed to the Minims an
affectionate, fatherly talk of appreciation and counsel.
In the course of his talk he spoke warmly in praise of
Father Sorin’s wisdom in early establishing the Minim
Department at Notre Dame, and recalled with pardon-
able pride the enthusiastic approval in regard to this
department expressed by the lamented President Harper
of Chicago University when on a visit of inspection at
Notre Dame.

Advantages of a Separate Department
The advantages of having a separate department
at the University for the boys under thirteen years of
age are so many and so evident that it would seem
almost unnecessary to mention them. In the first
place, if parents are desirous of having their sons sent
away to school when they are of such tender age, they
must fully realize that special care and attention should
be given to these boys. However, it would be a difficult
matter to make special provisions for them, unless they
be kept alone and be under the supervision of prefects
and instructors who can devote their whole time to
Bulletin of the University of Notre Dame
13
caring particularly for them. It would be practically
impossible to make any deviation from the ordinary
curriculum in order to benefit them if they were per-
mitted to be among the other boys; for discriminations
in any department, as among men in the world, always
work unsatisfactorily.	•
Again, the intimate association of such young boys
with older ones does not always lead to the best results.
Whatever they notice in their elders they will strive to
imitate; and it too often happens that they notice only
the rougher side of the actions of their companions.
Boys under the age of thirteen years, it must be remem-
bered, cannot be expected to use very great discretion
or judgment in shaping their actions, and the evil
influence of one thoughtless person may leave a lasting
impression on their youthful minds. Another advan-
tage in having the Minims by themselves is this: their
studies, their manner of spending recreation, and their
tastes in general are very different from those of the
more advanced boys. They can do better in class work
if they follow such lines as are specially planned for
them, and they will enjoy their games much better if
they are where they can play them without interference
from older boys. Life in St. Edward’s Hall is thus
made more home-like for them since the rules and
regulations are especially suited for their best interests.
There are a hundred and one little things that go to
make up their comfort and happiness, that could not
be taken into account if they were not in a separate
department. They enjoy not only the special privileges
of their own hall but also those of the older students—
public lectures, concerts, games, etc. The Minims are
made to feel that they are privileged students at Notre
Dame. The Sisters of Holy Cross are in charge of
St. Edward’s Hall. They give the most scrupulous
14 Bulletin of the University of Notre Dame
attention to the needs and comforts of the pupils in
all that pertains to studies, health and personal neat-
ness. None better than they know how to take the
place of the mother in the training, the progress and the
happiness of those under their care.
When placing their sons at Notre Dame, parents
find great satisfaction in seeing that, if they have made
a sacrifice in depriving themselves of the company of
their children, they are leaving them in a beautiful
home surrounded by every care and comfort, and,^at
the same time, affording them an opportunity of laying
a deep and solid foundation for an education that will
make towards usefulness and happiness through life.
