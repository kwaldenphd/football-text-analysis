HISTORICAL.
In building the University of Notre Dame, the
founders sought , to make it a home from which the benefits
of Christian education might be spread to the youth of the
land. Realizing, however, that, to enter the university
proper, a certain standard of excellence must first be
reached, it was decided that such a decree of excellence as
was required could be attained better here if a preparatory
school were maintained in connection with the university.
It has been found that, when students came here after
completing their preparatory course in High, schools or in
academies; they would be qualified thoroughly enough in
some studies, whereas in others they were rather deficient.
Thus a student that might enter as a Freshman in some,
studies, might be two or three years behind in others, and
he would be held back to make these up. But by making
the initial and preparatory courses at an institution in
which the student can follow along to graduation in one of
the collegiate courses, much time and trouble is saved and
a pupil will have a better foundation for his work. Since
the opening of the University therefore, it has been free to
students desiring preparatory education as well as to those
that desire to pursue more advanced studies. From this
combined preparatory and academic school grew the sep-.
arate schools, and eventually St. Edward’s Hall was
erected as the junior part of the preparatory department of
the University. During the first year of its existence the
school was in the charge of lay teachers; but in 1863 the
Very Rev. Father Sorin, who during his lifetime took
great pride in .this department, decided that it would be
more advantageous to ’have the pupils in the charge of

Sisters. Accordingly; Mother M. Angela, the famous
foundress of the Order of the Sisters of the Holy Cross in
America, was entrusted with the organization of the school
as we have it to-day.	.	■
ST. EDWARD'S HALL.
St. Edward’s Hall is the preparatory department of
the University of Notre Dame. To this school, established
for the special care and training of boys under thirteen
years of age, the most scrupulous attention has always
been paid by the President of the University. It is also
known as the Minim Department.
Thorough and comprehensive instruction in all the
elementary branches of an English education is here
imparted, together with a rudimentary knowledge of Latin,
French, Spanish and German. Vocal Music, Elocution,
Military Drill, Physical Culture and Drawing involve no
extra charge. The pupils of this department are taught
by the Sisters of the Holy Cross, who are noted for their
efficiency as teachers. Some special studies, such as Elo-
cution, Physical Culture, Military Drill, Gymnastics and
Debating, are taught by regular professors of the Uni-
versity.
The boys are always under supervision. From the
•day of their entrance they are made to feel that they are
not strangers, but the children of the house. Three
Brothers of the Holy Cross preside in the sleeping apart-
ments, gymnasium and natatorium / accompany them .on
their walks; and, in general, see to them during the
recreation hours. . The presence of the Brothers, however,
is far from being a restraint on the amusement of the boys ;
Tor while it is the duty of the prefects to insist that, their
young charges shall always keep within the limits of the
8
ST. WARD’S HATT.
strictest propriety, they, at the same time, take part in all
sports, organize games, and do everything in their power
to foster the love of healthy exercise.
• St. Edward's Hall is unique in the completeness of its
equipment. It affords the pupils the rare advantages of
the University and the tender care of the Sisters. The
fact that the boys come from the best families, and from
all over the country, and that among them are the sons of
former Minims, is sufficient evidence of the advantages
afforded by St. Edward’s Hall.
The Scholastic Year begins the first week in Septem-
ber and closes about the twentieth of June. Students are
received at any time during the year, and the expenses
for board and tuition commence with the date of their
entrance.	.

DESCRIPTION*
St. Edward’s Hall is located in the northeast corner
of the University group of buildings, a little to the north
of the Academy of Music and east of the Main Building.
It is a large, four story, brick building, one hundred and
fifty feet long and sixty-five feet wide. ’Tn the Chapel,
the corridors and the parlor, are paintings by the celebrated
Signor Gregori. The various rooms in St. Edward’s Hall
are large, well lighted and well ventilated. The ceilings
are sixteen feet high. The building is heated throughout
by steam, lighted by electricity, supplied with hot and
cold water. No fire is used in any part of the building.
Bath rooms are connected with the sleeping apartments.
The equipment is, in every respect, as thorough and as
up-to-date as carefulness and a generous expenditure of
money can make it. One1 of the things that most readily
appears to the eye of an observer is the order and scrupul-
ous cleanliness that is to be noticed on all sides. Even in
the play rooms, where it might be expected that young
boys might leave things in a careless condition, everything
is as neat and orderly as one would find in a well con-
ducted home.	.
On the east end of the building is an annex, two
hundred and fifty feet long, which does not show in the
cut of the hall. . It is divided into a library, game rooms,
play hall, gymnasium, athletic club rooms, clothes rooms,
etc. Thus it may be seen that the facilities offered to the
young boys for spending recreation hours in a manner
most suitable to their age and tastes are as complete as
possible.
Fronting thejbuildings is St. Edward’s Park, which,
ST. WARD’S HALT.
13
with its rare trees, plants and gorgeous flower beds, is
considered the most beautiful portion of the University
grounds, which have attracted attention as the grandest
college grounds in the country. The cut gives but a small
corner of St.. Edward’s Park, as it has been impossible for
us to get a photograph of the whole grounds. The hall,
with its annex, has a frontage on this park of four hun-
dred feet.

EDUCATION.
The education imparted in St. Edward’s Hall is
practical and thorough. It combines the advantages of -
old methods, which long experience has proved to be bene-
ficial, with the best that modern notions of education sug-
gest. It is intended to train the heart as well as the mind,
to form young gentlemen,who will be an honor to their
parents and to society. Every attention is given to the
moral culture of the students; and their general deportment
is equally the subject of unremitting care. Knowing that
the charm of refined manners is the aggregate of habits
acquired in youth, the teachers fail not, on all occasions,
to point out and take means to correct faults committed
against gentlemanly deportment. Instructions in polite-
ness and etiquette are given once a week.
- St. Edward’s Hall welcomes to its advantages pupils
of every denomination; but anything like an attempt to
force the religious convictions of non-Catholics is carefully
avoided. For the sake of uniformity and the preservation
of discipline, all the pupils are required, at stated times, to
attend divine services with the student-body in the College
Church. All, Catholics and non-Catholics, are taught to
. appreciate moral worth. Surrounded as the students are
by all that tends to ennoble and elevate, it would seem
; hardly possible that one should spend 'even a year-at Notre-
Dame without acquiring greater love and respect for all
that pertains to a nobler life.

THE COURSES OF INSTRUCTION.
• The courses of instruction in St. Edward’s Hall were
planned with a view to giving pupils a broad foundation
for commercial studies or for university education. They
include Christian Doctrine and Bible History, ( for Catholic
students), Reading, Orthography, Geography, Arithmetic,
Grammar, Penmanship, United States History, Composi-
tion, Algebra, Elocution, Drawing, Music, Phonography,
Typewriting, Physical Culture, Military Drill, Eatin,
Greek, German, French, • Spanish and Spanish-English.
On entering the student, the parents decide with the
Prefect of Studies the course the boy is to follow, and the
studies are taken up accordingly.
The students of the first-class complete the following
studies: Brooks’ Normal Higher Arithmetic, Harvey’s
Grammar, Advanced Geography, Beitzel’s Advanced
. Speller, History of the United States, Reading, Penman-
ship, Eatin, Algebra and Composition for two sessions.
So thoroughly do they master these studies that it has
been invariably found in the examinations held at the end
of the preparatory course to determine the eligibility of
students for entrance into the collegiate courses that those
boys who came from St. Edward’s Hall were easily
superior to the young men who had prepared themselves
in other schools. Being thoroughly trained for every line
which they are to follow in the next years of their college
life, these ex-Minims take the lead at the entrance exami-
nations,. hold it all through their course, and are frequently
the ones on whom class honors fall. .

THE COURSES IN MUSIC
The department of Music is in the second story of the
building. It consists of a large room for vocal classes, and
a number of other rooms, each containing musical instru-
ments for lessons and daily practice.
Instructions on the piano, violin, mandolin, guitar,
flute, cornet and banjo are given by able teachers. Each
pupil devotes an hour daily to music, including a private
lesson of fifteen minutes. To secure that the pupils do
not waste their time, as they are. apt to do when left to
•themselves, a Sister is bn duty at all times to see that they
practice faithfully. General vocal lessons are given once a
-week.
DEPARTMENT FOR LITTLE BOYS.
At the request of parents who desire their children to
make their initial studies in St. Edward’s Hall and to
continue thenTat Notre Dame until completion, a separate
department has been opened for boys under seven years of
age. They have a special study hall, separate class rooms
and sleeping apartments, and a dining room in which food
specially prepared and suitable for them is served. The -
hours for sleep and study are arranged to suit their tender
age. But while their hours of study are few, it is remark-
able how rapidly these little boys progress. When' they
have completed their thirteenth year they are usually
found to be as -far advanced in their studies as the ordinary
boy of sixteen.

SORIN CADETS.
The Sorin Cadets are divided into two companies
under the command of an ex-drill instructor of the United
. States Army. The companies are armed with a light car-
bine rifle weighing less than four pounds. These rifles
and the other equipment are kept in a room fitted up as an
armory. The drill, which is of a light nature, is practiced
twice a week in the large play hall; but in favorable
weather it is conducted outdoors. Great attention is paid
at all times to the setting up of boys. An upright and
manly bearing is the result of the drills which are, no
doubt, beneficial to both mind and body. Boys of the
most efficient class, who show an aptitude to command, are
selected and promoted to fill the different positions of non-
commissioned officers. At the close of the scholastic year
a Gold Medal is awarded to the boy who has the highest
number of points to his credit for proficiency and deport-
ment.	,
DISCIPLINE.
Continued and varied experience in the care and
training of young boys has brought about the system of
discipline now enforced in St. Edward’s Hall. Certain
restrictions must necessarily be laid upon pupils of their
age, and rules of conduct must be formulated which they
must strictly obey. Yet every liberty that is compatible
with careful training, and every privilege conformable to
their proper development, is granted to’ the Minims.
Those in charge realize that childhood is the most impres-
sionable time of life, and that the effects of early training

The Sorin Cadets.

are lasting. Therefore it is sought to - influence the
Minims by such methods only as will develope in their
youthful minds a love for order and rightful conduct, a
proper respect for parents and superiors,: and a taste for
such habits as will bring them honor in after life. Every
care is taken to see that they are kept from all that would
in the least taint their morals, and that they are taught to
strive after such virtues and manly habits as will-make
them estimable young men. As in a well regulated home,
recourse is had to kindness rather than severity., ~ The
Sisters feel that they fill the place of the absent mother.
The discipline is thus more like the regulation of an
orderly home than like-the strict mandatesofa boarding
school. To keep the pupils impressed - with the love and
respect they owe their parents, they are required to write
to them at least once a week. '
As an incentive to keeping the rules, an honor system
has been established. At a conspicuous place in. the hall
a Tablet of Honor is placed, on which are inscribed the .
names of those whose conduct has been -conformable to all
regulations and whose work has been satisfactory to their
teachers. There is great rivalry among the boys to have
their names appear on this Tablet. A. gold medal is also
awarded at the end of two full years to those whose deport-
ment has been exceptionally good. As this fact is made
known to the Minim immediately after his . entrance, he '
generally endeavors to shape his conduct with a view to
receiving an Honor. It has been found that such incen-
tives as these have been far more effectual toward the
.development .of character than would be corporal punish-
ment. This latter method finds no place in St. Edward’s
Hall, for seldom, if ever, is it employed. .	• .
The Minims are kept within the line of duty by a
sense of honor and justice rather than by fear of punish-
ment. Among the many means of promoting emulation,
st. hdward’s hath.
21
are Weekly Notes, Reports published in the Scholastic
Bi-Monthly Bulletins, Annual Distribution of Premiums
and Gold Medals'for excellence in studies.	.
The President of the University frequently visits St.
Edward’s Hall; and once a month he examines all the
classes to ascertain the progress the pupils are making in
the different studies	■	. :	.
The order of the day in St. Edward’s Hall is as fol-
lows: ... Rising at six-forty a. m., toilet, etc.; breakfast at
seven, after which a short time is allowed for recreation
and exercise; at half past seven, studies and. classes are
begun, and continued without intermission until half past
nine ;'from half past nine until ten, recreation is given and
a luncheon is served. At ten, classes are again taken up
and followed until eleven forty-five; eleven forty-five,
toilet; twelve, dinner, followed by recreation; from one
until three, study and class; three, recreation and lunch-
eon; from- half past four until half past six, study and
classes ; half past six, supper, followed by recreation ; eight
o’clock, retiring.	.
. Brom this it may be seen that the work has been
arranged as judiciously as possible toward furthering men-
tal and physical development at the same time. .‘The
pupils are never at work more than two hours at a time.
This gives them ample opportunity to take such recreation
as boys of their age require, and perhaps to this is due the
fact that they are- so healthy and happy. The recreation
and exercise in the fresh air after each two hours of study
unbind the mind and prepare the boys to return to their
■ "work with a freshness and vigor that does very much
■toward their progress. ; .	/

SOCIETIES.
There are two societies in the Minim department, that
of the Guardian Angels of the Sanctuary, which has for
its object to supply servers for the Church services, and
the Sorin Association which has been established with a
view to give the pupils a start in elocution and debating as
early as possible. This society is presided over by one of
the professors who finds it a pleasant duty to train these
interesting young speakers. Meetings are held once a
week after school hours. These meetings are a source of
pleasure as well as of profit to the young enthusiasts.
Not infrequently are they honored at these meetings by
the presence of some of the University officials who take
pleasure in attending, to encourage them and watch the
development they are making. The members prepare
original compositions, deliver declamations, are trained to
debate, etc. As .a further encouragement for this young
literary society, a gold medal is annually awarded at com-
mencement time to the one who has done the best work,,
and who shows his merit in open contest. This society
has the honor of furnishing the representative,who delivers
the greetings from St. Edward’s Hall to the President of
the University on President’s day.	.	‘

THE MAIN STUDY HALL.
The main Study Hall for the more advanced pupils in
St. Edward’s is located on the second floor in the center of
the building. It is a large room, well lighted and well
ventilated, commanding a charming view from each of its
many large windows. The hall presents quite an artistic
appearance, being tastefully decorated with beautiful
statuary, rare pictures, potted plants, etc. Besides the
pleasure the students derive from studying in this bright,
beautiful hall, their tastes are cultivated by coming in con-
tact with objects so refining.

THE REFECTORY*
The majority of the Minims take their meals with the
Carroll Hall students in the latter’s dining room. But'
the younger boys and those whose health requires a special
regimen, have separate dining rooms in which food suit-
able to their individual tastes is served.	.

THE CLOTHES ROOM.
The clothes room is an important apartment in St.
Edward’s Hall. In this each pupil has his wardrobe.
Sisters are constantly in charge. They attend to the
mending, etc., see to the personal neatness of the boys,
take charge of the trunks on the arrival of the pupil, mark
and take an inventory of the clothing, etc., which they
place in the lockers assigned to him. - The boys have free
access to the clothes room at all hours; and they receive
from the Sisters the clothing they may need from time to
time. Clothing is changed to suit the seasons, and it is
the duty of one of the prefects to see that the boys follow1
this rule. Often when the temperature suddenly changes
in one day, they may be made to change heavy clothes for
light, or light for heavy clothes. Underwear is changed
once a week.

THE LAVATORIES.
The lavatories are supplied with hot and cold water,
located on the- lower floor near the clothes room so that
they can be conveniently reached at all times either from
the campus, from the clothes room, or from the athletic
dressing rooms. The Minims are obliged to make their
toilet here, before every meal, and Sisters are present
to assist and to see that it is properly done. All are
required to brush their teeth carefully. Baths are taken
once a week or oftener as parents may direct.

TEE DORMITORIES.
The sleeping apartments are all commodious and well
ventilated. Each one is presided over by a Brother. The
most noticeable thing in connection with these dormitories
is the immaculate cleanliness that prevails all through.
The beds have springs with the ordinary mattress, and
over this is placed a hair mattress. Bedding is provided
in abundance during cold weather. There is nothing
lacking to keep the boys comfortable. Bath rooms with
hot and cold water are connected with the sleeping
apartments.

THE INFIRMARY.
So seldom is it that any of the boys of St. Edward’s
Hall is sick that no special infirmary has been found nec-
essary for them. When occasionally it happens that one
of them is indisposed he is put in charge of the Sisters at
the University Infirmary and‘ is visited, if necessary, by
the house physician. In case of sickness the boy’s parents
are immediately notified.
Since the health of the students is of primary import-
ance, the sanitary regulations enforced are of the most
practical nature. Special attention is given to the choice
and to the preparation of food, to the hours for rising and
retiring, to meals, study, recreation, to the rules affecting
personal regimen, etc. The pure air, the regular life,
perfect open plumbing, the extensive grounds, which
afford abundant opportunities for exercise,—all contribute
to the proverbial good health of the Minims.
THE DIFFERENT APARTMENTS IN THE ANNEX
TO ST, EDWARD'S HALL.
The principal object the authorities had in adding this
annex was to furnish places where the Minims could spend
their recreation hours when the weather is too inclement
to permit them to be outdoors. On this account much
attention was given to the furnishing of the
. ....... _	GYMNASIUM,	.
a room forty-eight feet long and twenty-eight-feet wide,

used to advantage by the Minims. In it are to be found
running ladders,. rings, punching bags, horizontal and
parallel bars, turning poles, climbing poles and ladders,
Swiss ladders, dumb-bells, clubs, weights, springboards,
mats, horses, pyramid frames, etc. This apartment is
now used merely as a practice room since the building of
the large University gymnasium, as the boys go there for
gymnastic instruction. .Next in importance to the gym-

drill room for the Sorin Cadets. The	.
'	READING ROOM
is thirty feet long and twenty feet wide. This, like the
game room, is tastefully decorated with potted plants and
pictures. It contains a library of many hundred volumes,
especially suited to the age of the pupils. The books
include the best authors in travel, history, biography,
poetry, and fiction; as well as bound encyclopedias, maga-
zines, papers received from home, etc. The Reading
Room is accessible at all recreation hours. The

As the boys have free access to these four rooms during
recreation they have ample opportunities of satisfying their
individual tastes.	'

contains the rifles and equipments of the Sorin Cadets. In

THE MINIM'S CAMPUS.
The campus, which is set aside for the exclusive use
of the Minims, is a level eight-acre field; and is directly
north of their play hall. • It is located on the brow of St.
Joseph’s lake, thus commanding one of the. best views of
the many splendid scenes at Notre Dame. This field is a
place of great activity during those seasons in which
outdoor games may be played. There are several base-
’ ball diamonds on which, during the warm weather in
spring and summer, organized teams battle for champion-
ship honors in the national game and for the medals
awarded to the champion nine.
Then there are four gridirons where enthusiastic foot-
40	ST. EDWARD’S HATT.,
ball players develop their muscles in the great college
game. Encircling the field is a track where the track
athletes and bicycle riders do their work. The campus is
also well supplied with swings, May-poles, turning poles,
a tennis court, a large toboggan slide for the winter, and
many other apparatus with which the Minims may spend
their recreation hours in an enjoyable manner. That they
take advantage of the opportunities afforded can readily be
seen if one makes a visit to their campus. Homesickness
is almost unknown among the boys. The new students
become readily acquainted with their class-mates and
their surroundings, and from the first join in the games
and sports. They realize that they are in a new world
where they have more freedom and enjoyment than they
could possibly have at home. Baseball suits, bats, balls,
and masks are furnished gratis.

ATHLETICS.
Young boys need a great amount of vigorous and
wholesome exercise when they are required to do much ,
■mental work. Study is wearing enough on any person,
but for the youth, who does not directly see the benefit of
it, application to books is doubly tiresome. He measures
greatness more by the standard of sports than by education
and cultufe. To satisfy his longings for games, his desire
to match his skill and strength with his fellows, he must
be given ample opportunity to engage in contests. Thus -
will his mind be relieved of the strain that study would
naturally put upon it. It is evident that a suitable amount
of play will sharpen the intellect and render its possessor
much more competent , to work in a beneficial manner.
42	ST. WARD’S HALT.
Again play developes a strong constitution, physical
strength, agility of body and confidence in one’s own
ability. This is particularly true of young boys, who are
so susceptible of training. Bearing these facts in mind,
the authorities of St Edward’s Hall have made every pos-
sible provision to give the boys sufficient time for athletics. .
It must not be inferred, however, that they are permitted
all play and.no work. Only during recreation times can
there be-any attention given to the subject of games and
athletics, and these are never allowed to interfere in any
way with class work., Every game is encouraged at its
proper time, but when the hour for study comes all games
must be stopped. '
■ Baseball and football are the chief sports among the
Minims. In spring there are as many as eight different
nines competing for the championship of the hall. The
rivalry among these various teams is very great. Toward
the close of the season the two teams with the best record
play a series of five games and to the winners of this
series go the honors. Each member , of the team is pre-
sented with a gold medal. In football the rivalry is
equally as great, except that the strongest team usually
plays most of its games with boys from Carroll Hall, and
with junior teams from South Bend.
The building in which the swimming pool is located,
is a commodious one, ninety feet long, forty-five wide and
two stories in height. The pool itself is fifty-seven feet in
length, twenty-three feet in width, six and a half feet
in depth at one end, and gradually grades down to seven
and a half feet at the other end. The water is lowered on
days reserved for the. Minims. ■ On the same floor as the
swimming pool are eighteen needle and shower baths, bath
tubs, and closets, all up-to-date. A student before using
the swimming pool must cleanse himself in one of these
baths. In this way the sanitary condition of the pool is
st. ward’s hall.	43
faultless. The building is heated by steam at 70 degrees
Fahrenheit, and lighted by electricity. A man is always
in charge; and when the Minims use the plunge they
are accompanied by their prefects.
ST. JOSEPH’S LAKE
In warm weather the Minims are allowed to go swim-
ming every day in St. Joseph’s lake. Of all sports this is
the one the young boys particularly enjoy. However,
they are never permitted to go unless in company with the
Brothers. There is absolutely no danger, and no accident
has ever occurred among the Minims. They cannot go

THE ADVANTAGES OF ST, EDWARD'S HALL,
The advantages of having a separate department at
tlie University for boys under thirteen years of age are so
many and so evident that it would seem almost unneces-
sary to mention them. In the first place, if parents are-
desirous of having their sons sent away to school when
they are of such tender age, they must fully realize that
special care and attention should be given to these young
boys. However, it would be a difficult matter to make
special provisions for them, unless they be kept alone and
be under the supervision of prefects and instructors that
can devote their whole time to caring particularly for them.
It would be practically impossible to make any deviation
from the ordinary curriculum in order to benefit them if
they were permitted to be among'the other boys;’ for
discriminations in. any department, as among men in the
world, always work unsatisfactorily.
Again, the intimate association of such young boys
with older ones does not always lead to the best results.
Whatever they notice in their elders they will strive to
imitate, but it too often happens that they notice only the
rougher side of their companions’ actions. Boys under
the age of thirteen years, it must be remembered, can not
be expected to use very great discretion or judgment in
shaping their actions, and the evil influence of one
thoughtless person may leave a lasting impression on their
youthful minds. Another advantage in having the
Minims by themselves is this : their studies, their manner
of spending recreation, and their tastes in general are very
different from those of the more advanced boys. They
can do better in class-work if they follow such lines as are

specially planned for them, and they will enjoy their
games much better if they are where they can play them
without interference from older boys. Life in St.
Edward’s Hall is thus made more home-like for them since
the rules and regulations are especially suited to their best
interests. There are a hundred and one little things that
go to make up their comfort and happiness, that could not
be taken into account if they were not in a separate
department. They enjoy not only the special privileges of
their own hall but also those of the older students—public
lectures, concerts, games, etc. The Minims are made to’
feel that they are the privileged ones at Notre Dame. As
has been already stated, the Sisters of the Holy Cross are
in charge of St. Edward’s Hall. They give the most
scrupulous attention to the needs and comforts of the
pupils in all that pertains to studies, health and personal,
neatness. None better than they know how to take the
place of the mother in the training, the progress and the
happiness of those under their care.	''
When placing their sons at Notre Dame, parents find
great satisfaction in seeing that, .if they have made a sacri-
fice in depriving themselves of their children’s company,
they are leaving them in a beautiful home surrounded by
every care and comfort, and, at the same time, affording
them an opportunity of laying a deep and solid foundation
for an education ’that will increase their usefulness, and
happiness through life.	.

Notre Dame Scholastic
Z/	-	w
It	.
Is the title of a neat 28-page paper, devoted to
the interests of the students, and published by them
at the University every week during term time.
This journal opens a field for young writers who
might otherwise, for want of a proper medium,
allow their talents to remain inactive. It also
affords students an opportunity for practical exper-
ience in journalism. During seasons of special interest
at the University, The Scholastic is published daily.
It will be the endeavor of the Editors during the
coming year to merit the encouragement given the
paper in the past, and the encomiums bestowed upon
it by the press in general.
The Scholastic will be sent to any address for
$1.50 per annum. .	;
