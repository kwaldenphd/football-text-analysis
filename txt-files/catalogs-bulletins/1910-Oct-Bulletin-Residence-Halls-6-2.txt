RESIDENCE HALLS
AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME
The University provides board and lodging for all
the faculty and students in its own buildings on
the campus. This arrangement draws professors and
students into close social contact and forms an ideal
college community.
There are two modes of student life at Notre Dame
—the common room system and the private room sys-
tem. Each has special advantages. In the common
room system the students study in a large assembly
room under constant supervision of a member of facul-
ty. They sleep in a high-ceilinged, well ventilated
common dormitory where the beds are screened by
curtains to secure privacy. Lavatories are provided
with stationary wash-stands having hot and cold run-
ning water, to each student being assigned a locker
for toilet articles. Recreation rooms are furnished
with billiard tables and pianos. Facilities for bath-
ing—shower, needle and tub baths and a swimming
pool 23 x 57 feet—are arranged in the University
natatorium directly in the rear of the lavatories. The
common room system is especially adapted to young
men who have not formed fixed habits of study or
whose general character is not well moulded. One
year of this manner of living is strongly recommended
for all students by the University administration.

UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME
For the private room system the University has
four Residence Halls known as Old College, Sorin,
Corby and Walsh. These form part of the group of the
University buildings, within short distances of one an-
other all on the campus. Cement walks lead from one
building to another. The Residence Halls are construct-
ed, as are the other buildings, of cream colored brick
and stone trimmings. Each Hall contains ample facili-
ties for resisting fire, and all are provided with devices
for escaping from a burning building. A night watch-
man within the buildings regularly patrols these
Halls, and another does duty around them on the
outside. No oil lamps, candles or any artificial
lights other than electric are allowed in rooms, and
smoking in the rooms is also forbidden. The Halls are
lighted throughout by electricity and heated by steam.
The Residence Halls vary in size. The average
floor space in single bedrooms is 8.6 x 13.9. There
are a number of double rooms in each Hall. In Walsh
Hall most of the rooms in the front of the building are
in suites, a suite consisting of a bedroom, study and
bath. The ceilings are ten feet high. All the rooms
have .outsid/e light and exposure. There are baths
and toilet rooms in all the Halls, and each has recre-
ation rooms for general use, in which are billiard,
tables and pianos.
The following furniture is provided for the rooms;
chairs, table, book-shelf, wash-stand, bowl, pitcher,
soap-dish, ward-robe, bedside rug, iron bed with spring
mattress, hair mattress, pillow, double woolen blanket,
quilt, bed-linen and counterpane. In double rooms
there are three chairs and double the number of other
articles. Students are at liberty to add any other
article of furniture they may desire at their own cost.

ADMISSION
The University reserves all rights in the assign-
ment of rooms and shall determine when they must
be vacated. Choice of room-mates must receive the
sanction of the University officers. An accumulation
of 300 demerits for violation of house rules or the gen-
era? rules of the University, any single serious breach
of discipline or continued lax of habits of study will
lead to the forfeiture of rooms. Rooms will be ready
for occupancy on the Monday preceding the opening
of the academic year, and must be vacated on the Sat-
urday following the annual Commencement.
Definite application for the reservation of rooms
should be made on May 1 on application blanks, a
“form which will be found on page 23. Later appli-
cations will be acted on in case rooms have not been
called for. No reservation will be made unless the
application is accompanied by a fee of fifteen dollars,
which is demanded as an earnest of good intention.
This fee will be applied toward defraying the charge
for rental in case the student occupies the room; it will
be forfeited by the applicant if for any reason what-
ever he fails to occupy his room on the latest date
open for reservations. No rooms will be held longer
than the date set for the opening of classes.
Graduate students and those of junior and senior
standing and such sophomore students as can be accom-
modated are assigned to Old College and Sorin Hall.
All sophomores who cannot be provided with rooms in
Sorin reside in Corby Hall. No room rental is charged
6
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME
to students of these four classes, the four hundred dol-
lar charge for board, lodging, laundry and tuition
covering the rent of a room for an academic year.
However, these upperclassmen may secure rooms in
Walsh by paying the difference between the rate for
a single room and the increased charges for room
rental in Walsh, due to greater convenience and more
elegant surroundings. A nominal charge of fifteen
dollars to cover the expense of the care of a room for
one year, is made to all upperclassmen. A special
rate is made to freshmen.	Attention is called
to the fact that only those students who have
completed all the preparatory studies — who have
“no conditions”—are entitled to the freshman rate.
Similarly only “unconditioned” sophomores get rooms
free.
RULES
All students living in Residence Halls are sub-
ject to the disciplinary regulations of the University.
Failure to observe these rules entails demerits which
are imposed according to the gravity of the offence.
For violation of the special regulations for the good
order and safety in Residence Halls demerits are also
given. When a student has reached three hundred
demerits he forfeits his room. The use of intoxicating
liquors will lead in every case to the forfeiture of a
room.
Each student will be responsible for the furniture
and the general condition of his room. Any damage
will be charged to him.
Meals are not permitted in the rooms. When
students are sick they will be cared for in the Univer-
sity Infirmary.

RATES
The rental charged for rooms, which are all pro-
vided with the necessary furniture enumerated above,
covers one academic year and includes heat, lights,
the care of the room, laundry of bed-linens and towels
and service of bed linens.
The prices are governed by the size of the rooms,
exposure and location.
The location of the rooms may be ascertained by
reference to the numbers on the floor plans. The
initial number of the room indicates the floor on which
it is located.
No rental is charged for rooms in Old College or
Sorin Hall, in which upperclassmen reside. A fee of
$15.00 for service must be paid in advance by all
students residing in Old College or Sorin Hall and by
sophomores who live in Corby Hall.
Suites for one student consist of a study, a bed-
room and a bath; those for two students are com-
posed of one large study, two bedrooms and a bath;
suites for four students comprise two large studies,
one double and two single bedrooms and a bathroom.
Each room in the suites has a door leading to the
corridor. The larger suites, may, therefore, be divided
into single and double rooms and into suites for one
student. Prices for rooms thus separated may be as-
certained by applying to the Secretary of the University.
Some few of the large rooms listed as single
rooms may be occupied by two students. When this
arrangement is made an additional charge of $15.00
for service is annexed to the price of the room.
The regulations governing the payment of Resi-
dence Hall fees are the same as those that apply to
8
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME
tuition fees.Payment shall be made in advance of occu-
pancy. A deposit of $15.00 must be made when a
reservation of a room is demanded. This amount is
deducted from the rental when the student takes pos-
session. It will be forfeited if for any reason a student
fails to take the room assigned to him.
